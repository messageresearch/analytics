without him amen aren't you glad it's not Christ bless your works and my works and your mama and your daddy and the church Christ alone that's the way we're righteous let's turn to Matthew 24 tonight Matthew Matthew 24 verse 26 through verse 28 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert so that could be Tucson or Judea or the Sahara but I want you to notice that Jesus is giving a warning about his coming and that there would be people that would try to point you to one location on the earth to where you have to be to be a part of his coming wherefor they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it not now the Lord Jesus was not mincing words friends and he believes his words had value amen so he's warning of us of a time before his coming that people would go pointing to a particular spot or a particular place and say now if you want to see the coming of the Lord you've got to be at Word of Life Church or you've got to be over here you've got to be over there notice this is the Lord himself for as a lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together notice Jesus didn't say chickens or vultures but Eagles aren't you glad you're part of an eagle message for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together now as it would be um Whenever two people would hear he the same sermon and one would leave the service and say well I heard this and this and this and another one say I didn't hear that I heard this and this and this and then another one would say that wasn't what I heard I heard this and this and this well now this is what Matthew wrote about this scenario Luke 17:34 listen the way that Luke wrote it I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed but now when you read the original the word men is not actually in the original text but it actually says there shall be two in one bed now you may wonder why would I say that well oh because homosexual Christians what a disgrace to even say such things like to take this scripture and prove that two men can be in the bed together but if you go to your original text you'll find out it does not say men at all I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other left if there's two men sleeping together they won't neither one of them be took the pastor's back home oh my one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left now listen how the Rapture is going to be so people would just be going about their daily activities so two at the grocery store to at Walmart to at Lowe's to at Home Depot whatever to in a family maybe sitting on the couch you know going to church together whatever they're doing one will be taken and the other one will be left now no doubt these are Associates or friends or family members or they might even go to the same church two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left now what I love about this is that Jesus does not make the elect to where that they're not working and they're not grinding and they're not fixing breakfast and they're not just going about their job you see what I'm saying they they didn't feel like that they they they couldn't be spiritual if they had a job you're not very spiritual if you don't if you don't work you don't eat I love the way that he sets this because he shows us that people would be going about their daytoday activities two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where Lord and amazing how different he wrote it than what Matthew wrote it where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is Matthew said carcass Luke said body wheresoever the body is fither will the Eagles be gathered together praise the Lord Brother Donnie how can I make sure that I'm going to be there well one thing of course you have to be in Christ Jesus another thing is you gather with eagles now so you can gather with them after a while you see you can't go to church with buzzards and chickens and expect to be gathered with Eagles at that day you can't belong to a denominational prostitute and be identified as a wise virgin it's totally impossible to be a wise virgin and a foolish virgin at the same time how many wants to be a part of that more than anything else in your life me too let's pray together Lord Jesus these great words that were spoken over 2,000 years ago for Millennia men have read these these scriptures taken text and given different titles to it some of sincerity some not some genuine God call men some not so much but father we have come here tonight that we could be prepared for this hour I don't think any anyone here in the right mind would want to fulfill that part of the verse of scripture about the one that was LIF oh Jesus I pray that our hearts our ears our minds would be open to the spirit of God that we would be able to be prepared for this hour that lays before us help us to see and believe that only a people with a perfect heart will ever leave this world people with perfect Hearts they hold no grudges they forgive they are peacemakers they love your word they love you oh God God I pray if there's one here tonight without a perfect heart may they realize the value of it father may it be their goal their desire Above All Things help us tonight father we ask in the name of Jesus and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated I realized to preach the coming of the Lord in the traditional Church way is what people expect when they hear these scriptures I know that it makes us quite unusual that we believe the coming of the Lord has so many aspects I'm not sure if you've ever looked at this before but in Matthew there 2427 Jesus said so shall it be at the coming of the son of man that Greek word there coming is parosa now it's sad that that word was used among a rank an element around our message that made basically a denomination out of it but yet it is a word that Jesus spoke and it can mean his Vis his Invisible Presence or it can also mean a Corporal return and the Lord Jesus we know spoke of a invisible coming as well as a visible one an invisible one would be for a a certain category of people those who are quickened by the spirit of God they are by God's presence known to be a mystical people they are mythical but they are also mystical now I know that word can be frightening because the devil uses it but a scarecrow shouldn't scare Eagles it should only scare crows now whenever we look at the coming of the Lord and the Rapture and the consummation of all the ages and the way that it's going to wind up with this great wonderful thing that we're anticipating every day of of our life we believe that it certainly will take more faith than has ever been in any other age and that faith that was once delivered to the Saints has been prophesy of course to be restored again in the last day with that would be a building and I know sometimes we may look at it and think what difference does it make if we go to church if we don't go to church what difference it make if we hear the word we believe the word why do your preachers keep saying listen to the tapes feed on the word what what what does that do well it's quite simple actually as you feed upon the word you actually become it which is the very reason Satan wants you so busy that you don't have time to read your Bible you don't have time to pray you don't have time to listen to tapes no more and I wonder if the things that are taking so much of our time are they actually worth it are they giving back to us things of Eternal value or are they things that just Rob us and make us more carnal more Earthly minded but it will truly be a special very unique people that will leave this world in a body change they are going to be a mystical people now watch's this in the message entitled perfect faith brother random says Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was so he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was but I remember he was still a mortal so it's like he was a mortal a human being get hungry get tired get weary have aches pains frustrations be troubled about issues in life feel the burdens of people all that sort of say and yet still live in a world of perfect Faith now watch he says if we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are we'd be a Mystic to the world a Mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then people then the people begin to say You' be a Mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Now isn't that peculiar they live in a world to themselves yet they're human like other humans they get hungry they get tired they get weary they can get sick frustrations even doubts can come in their minds fears oh my all kinds of of things like that yet at the same time from their soul they can live in another world that is totally unseen now what's this that's the way it is to all believers they're a Mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus Jesus lived in that world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say about this he says and they said why you talk in riddles we don't understand this how can this be you see they wasn't in the world that he lived in know isn't that strange they they ate with him they slept with him as they sleep on the ground and they they was around him more than anybody else and they knew after a while his mannerisms his vocabulary certain ways he would say things and they could learn that of course by repetition and watching him but yet Jesus lived in a world that they did not understand so he would say certain things and they'd say what did you mean what what what are you talking about and he said well Lazarus is asleep and they said well if he's asleep he's he's doing good and he said Lazarus is dead amen now first he spoke from his world now they were part of his ministry but they were not in his world yet let me say it again they were part of his ministry they had received power to cast out Devils heal the sick do all sorts of wonderful things but their souls had not been transported into his world yet oh God help us Lord they wasn't in the world that he lived in see they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him now listen what Webster this is a combination of Webster and Miriam and a couple of different dictionaries that I got this word the meaning of the word Mystic from a Mystic is a person who seeks by contemplation and self surrender to obtain Unity with or absorption into deity or the absolute so a Mystic then is one who seeks by contemplation they they think it's not just you know that it passes through their mind every fourth day or every sixth Sunday or you know whatever but by contemplation it's their heart it's it's where they live so they seek by contemplation and they know that just can't think their way through it but also selfs surrender to obtain Unity with or absorption into deity or the absolute or who believes in the spiritual apprehension of truths that are beyond the intellect and the church said now believe it or not I just defined every member that will go in the Rapture now this is not something that you try to make yourself odd and make yourself different it's not that at all a lot of us have already got that anyhow so we don't need more of that actually we need to get away from some of that nonsense someone who attempts listen to this last part someone who attempts to be United with God so how many wants to be a Mystic if you never did before a Mystic listen to this in Matthew 13:10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given now you see this is one thing that makes us so different of our comprehension and our belief about God even with the majority of the churches that would be in the tric Ci's area because we believe this is the way God's nature is that he will reveal himself to whom he chooses to and he will say things in such a way that some will not get it that's right and others will now if you don't believe that you don't believe what I just read from your very Bible so this puzzled the disciples why would it puzzle them they were not yet Mystics now listen to me carefully there is a vast difference between a Christian believer and a true disciple search the New Testament and see when you go to looking at those that were identified as disciples even some of the Pharisees believed but it did not call them disciples now our word disciple comes from the same root word that we get the word discipline from so a Believer can believe in the cross Believe In The Blood II even believe in the Holy Ghost believe in heaven Believe In Hell believe in all kinds of things and therefore that would make them in one sense a Believer because the word pistol which is where we get the word believe and Faith from actually means one of the meanings of that word is an intellectual face so from your mind somebody explains it to you and it makes perfect sense to you so a person that would believe they said oh yes I believe I I do I do I'm not saying that they don't but it does not mean that that person is a disciple because when they hear disciplinary word preached they will say nobody's going to tell me how to live nobody's going to tell me what to do nobody's going to tell me I can't cut my hair nobody's going to tell me that I can't wear makeup and I can't do this well you see that's what separates them from being a believer that believes in the cross to a daughter of God who wants to be disciplined by the word you see what I'm saying because they love the Lord Jesus and they want to be not only a believer in heaven and hell they want to be a disciple so they want their lives to be disciplined I hope that's what we've got here tonight that we want our lives to be disciplined by the word you follow me so far so whenever we hear the word preached and we see in our lives we're not quite matching up to that and just because we hear it say on Wednesday night doesn't mean that automatically it kicks in gear and starting right at the end of the service you automatically have it it may take you some time to be able to move up to that spot but by the grace of God you're going to do it because you are a disciple and when you hear the words you don't think that you're just sitting there listening to your pastor or brother Daryl or some other minister but you believe that God took that man's mouth and spoke through him to you and you took that personally as if it was the Lord Jesus himself now come on church now you know the prophet told us that that your pastor was God's angel that was sent to you y'all believe that so I wonder if we made an announcement now that come Sunday morning an angel of God will be speaking here behind the pulpit I wonder how many people if I didn't make it too clear now who that angel was they say Lord have mercy I wouldn't want to miss church if an angel's coming when your pastor is speaking to you that is an angel of God but yet people don't care to miss a little headache a little backache whatever why they simply don't believe what's been taught well come on now now what's the Lord Jesus as he speaks this to the disciples now remember they're not in this world yet but he's going to give them a little insight and they will recall it of course thank God Matthew wrote this down because he's the only one actually in the four gospels are quite rooted this way and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the Mysteries notice this word again that Jesus used it is muston Mysterion it is a hidden thing or a secret or a mystery or a religious secret confided only to to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals now remember this is the founder of the church himself really we have no right to tell him how he ought to make his church he is the designer of his church and it is him that is telling us in the future ages how the church will be so then there will be a group that will be initiated to them will be given the mystery on there will be another group that will only come to hang around the initiated they will not be a partaker of mystery on they will come to church they might get saved they might partak in communion you have a fellowship dinner after church they'll be there you know you have a youth service Serv whatever they will come but the Lord Jesus is the only one that can actually initiate us into the mysteries of God oh I'm so glad I'm in ain't you now watch this is something then confided only to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals oh my goodness you mean some of you all believe tonight sitting here that there are beings in this church that are more than ordinary morals am I'm one of them how many is one of them now listen as we go on the meaning of this word a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding so now the other part of that meaning actually separated categories of people the initiated and the non-initiated then the latter half of this meaning actually separates the part of you that has been initiated and the part of you that hasn't because there's an element of our human understanding that never has understood God and never ever will come on let's just say that that's exactly the truth there's things God says and things that God does I don't understand it you don't understand it and we probably never will as a mortal but we still believe him with all of our hearts and we trust him is that right I trust him this has been the secret of my life for many many decades that I trust him even when I don't understand what he is doing when he moves in a certain way and it seems to me that it's backwards that it does not make any sense I trust him even when I don't understand a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding a hidden purpose or counsel secret will the secret councils which govern God in dealing with the righteous which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to The Godly listen to this I thought this was awesome in the rinic writings which is the rabbis it denotes the Mystic uh oh here we go the Mystic or hidden sense now I know you may think brother Donnie this is far out out it really is way out but I I don't know if you know it yet but I hope the time I get done tonight it will help you to see that you already have a connection with the mystical of God you already have it you already have it you are identified with that Supernatural element many things of this last day message has already identified it watch's this and who is god let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it like a little white light huh little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo so there's no humans there's no Earth there's no universe but here is the mystical part of God what is it God giving birth to a son like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father what is it it's going to be the first visible manifestation of the invisible God and you don't remember it but actually you were there when he came out because in the beginning was the word that's what we just saw right there that was the beginning in the beginning was the word so what what is was it before the beginning it was the Eternal but the Eternal wanted to manifest himself so when every attribute every name that would ever be on the Lamb's Book of Life went out of God in the form of the son of himself notice that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word so God can never add anymore that was a complete volume of every word God would ever say and it went out of him in the form of logos so if you ever have eternal life you was in that logos when it went out of God that's why there ain't no Devils there ain't no sickness there ain't no besetting sin there ain't nothing that'll ever keep you away from that father God who loved you because you were there before you ever sinned you were there before you ever was born a mortal and started drinking and cussing and lying and running around remember all that sin that was not you in the first place that was not who you was you was identified there before you ever come to this Earth as a baby oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God that out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of god notice again in my commission he says I was baptizing in the Ohio river at the foot of Spring Street and I heard something speak and I felt something take a hold of me and I looked up and when I did coming down from Glory came this worldl coming down where I was at Courier Journal newspaper pack article of it and said a Mystic star appears over a local Baptist while baptizing in the river so here was the mystical part of God which was in him way back in the beginning now we see that mystical part showing up again when whenever our Prophet is baptizing the 17th person at the Ohio River what did the voice say as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming so don't you think it would be very fitting that the mystical would show up praise be to God I'd like to debate that brother Donnie I'd like to I ain't got no time for a bunch of these unbelievers well come on somebody oh my let them argue and fuss and debate and go on do whatever they want to do let us just move on closer to God and closer to God oh you know it's like the little old little old old squirrel that was out when brother Brandon was there shouting and worshiping God and he said it chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter days of Miracles has passed God don't do this no more that's all it is this is Chatter chatter chatter if they don't fear it why do they to spend so much of their time trying to defeat it but let me tell them no matter how much time what a waste of time it is to be able to try to disprove it and one day they're going to stand before God and God himself is going to let that Prophet step right out there and judge them come on Saints oh my so here comes a Mystic star so he said they couldn't make it out oh up to probably 10,000 people so I guess all 10,000 were deceived so all 10,000 people that was there actually didn't didn't see that it was just a figment of their imagination well praise the Lord you see why people that even set in message churches never connect with this message you've got to be born in the same world that the author who wrote it oh my oh probably 10,000 people saw it as it moved down where I was at and it went back up in the skies now watch this again in marriage and divorce now you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the sky the seventh Angels standing there come back and they opening of the Seven Seals watch what's taking place that is true rising of the sun and it went into the air and Life Magazine packed the picture Mystic something way in the Spheres where there could be no moisture where there could be no evaporation of anything 30 Mi High 27 Mi across coming right up from where those Ang Angels were oh but I would like to be there and I'd have to take my Polaroid and I'd have to have my iPhone I'd have to have this so are you going to do the same thing to make sure that Moses didn't write those Ten Commandments has anybody got a personal iPhone that you have a personal uh picture of God riding the 10 commandments what does anyone have a picture of Josh UA holding up his hand and stopping this movement which had been for maybe hundreds of thousands of years and the Bible says it was never such a day like it or since that God hearkened to the voice of a man that God called it he said Son stand still and moon hang now over the valley of aelon as we was there five or six years ago whenever our last trip was there and driving down the bus down through there and the guy gets on the microphone in the bus and said now right here is a very famous uh Bible stories I know you all believe the Bible and he said it was right in this General vicinity right here that Joshua had the Sun and the Moon to stand still well scientifically they said well that's totally impossible well it is for a scientific person but it's not for a Mystic it's not for a Mystic because we believe what we cannot understand we believe what we cannot even prove come on somebody what do you say we have church here tonight I cannot understand how God can call somebody whose body has went beyond acids and gases mind there's absolutely nothing left and yet he will speak and thousands times thousands will come forth in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and those of us that are alive our mortal bodies will be changed how is that possible that the spirit of God will move over me and my gray hair will go back to being Brown and my wrinkles will all vanish away Hallelujah and you will go back to being a young man or a young woman brother Donnie scientifically explaining I can't I can scripturally explain it I can messagely explain it but I'll never explain it to make an unbeliever believe it only the initiated can believe such a thing because I granted it seems to be an impossible event but our God Specializes in doing things that are totally impossible oh Hallelujah watch this Christ have been in his own word get used to the mystical you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers so forth well we better leave that alone here all these people come up missing and you say they don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there that's the way the Rapture is going to be now let me tell you what's ahead of you I have no idea what you're going to face tomorrow I have no idea what I will face tomorrow but there are some things that I can tell you about your future that are more certain than about anything else in this life by the word of God listen what's going to happen to you mystical people one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a Celestial body there'll be hide a hair or bones Left Behind it'll be trans transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space Glory dropping right out of space I've always been interested in space I used to watch the jeton whenever I was a kid some of y'all don't even know what that is do you some of you that laughed you watched it too ain't you uhhuh you give away your age yeah so there was something about him and that all get out there and fly around in space I've got a connection not with the Jetson but with space Oh Glory to God listen here what oh in a moment of time dropping out of space look at what it'll do taking home that we'll see all this going on now the Pentagon wondering about these lights and Mystic lights now you know in the last 10 to 15 years there was a law after the 60s and 70s but it's picked back up again Air Force pilots Delta Pilots different ones seeing it and they can't figure it out it can appear and disappear our f16s cannot keep up with them our f35s our F 22s cannot keep up with them so they follow them and they disappear what you reckon it is maybe trial runs on theophanies they call them UFOs I call them ifs identified flying theophanies now of course see this this is very strange right this is not the the church Naturals version of The Rapture no it's too mystical so the Pentagon wondering about these lights and Mystic lights and everything they're seeing in the sky you've seen the had one in the paper at Jeffersonville this week H that'd be a good place to show up isn't it get ready Johnson City Press get ready Elizabeth and star cuz we may be calling some down before long for a visit hallelujah oh I know you may not think you're worse nothing but heaven's got a great prize set on your soul oh my how Heaven values you and the paper in Jeffersonville this week and so forth a Mystic white so oh they don't know what that is but listen little children it's going to pick you up one of these days see see don't worry I don't mind telling you one thing I'm going to have to be changed if a light comes down and picks me up anybody here with me I'm going to have to be changed I'm not scared of heights I can get up in a ladder and I can work off of a boom and all that sort of thing but I did say a ladder or my feet on a boom but if something picks me up something picks me up in the middle of the air I mean here it comes right out of heaven and reaches right down and picks you up glory to God that sounds like that sounds like me amen it reaches down so he said don't worry don't worry amen hallelujah don't worry listen little children it's going to pick you up one of these days see see don't worry remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom friend there has never been a time like there is on the Earth right now with all this sexual perversion come on you might as well say Amen you know it's a truth it's unbelievable they don't realize they're fulfilling prophecy what if they fulfill it and don't know it what about us that want to serve him and want to please him don't you worry Little Children You are going to fulfill the word of your hour if they can fulfill the prophetic things that have been said about them and they don't even know it Ephesus prophesied and didn't even know what he was doing Joseph was giving up a type and a shadow of a coming Lord Jesus years and years after Joseph lived on the earth he didn't even know what he was doing what about us as the people of God that have a Bible and we have a prophet's message to be able to give us an Insight oh thank God we need to have confidence in the promise of the word of God we will not miss our Vision you imagine how brother bll must have felt that day when he looked and realized that he had on that green checkered shirt my sister bisc did not know she was getting ready to work toward prophecy brother bisc did not know when he fell in the water that day that was a word from God and yet the prophet knew it but he just kept it inside of his heart and he said the only thing troubles about me is he said there ain't nobody with a green checken shirt and he looks right there and brother bis go stands with that green checken shirt on they didn't get together and said now you do this and you do that and you do that now call call Sister you know so and and then sister B going to tell her to they no that's the way the Rapture will be you get up and fix breakfast you'll get up brothers and go to work some of you sisters will do this and that you children will go to school and the Lord will say today is your day in the vision oh praise be to God today is your day in the vision let me say this friends if K Cala whatever you want to call her if she was a woman God's Prophet saw in that Vision there ain't enough politics there ain't enough nothing to keep her out of there and she will walk right into it not even knowing about that prophecy but I'll tell you one thing as unbelievers they fulfill it what about us as Believers it's our heart it's our soul it's our desire to obey God and fulf his word is that not what you want it ain't no wonder Satan tries to assail us with so much trouble so much heartache so much difference in our life and so much difference in the church it's to beset your thinking away from the word of God Amen in this message perfect faith if you haven't listened to it in a bit Carol and I listen to it going to oh high and we listen to it coming back be a good one for you to listen to so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material bride material so whoever decided to make a handkerchief I don't mind telling you I am some kind of glad amen that they didn't use a piece of fabric that would say a grass sack or an a sheet of ASB bestus or something like uh ad0 grit sandpaper I'd be renewing my use ever service wouldn't I there is an appropriate material for the appropriate use now before long we had one yesterday when the mornings are going to start getting cool right and I'm a my metabolism is so high about burn up if I bat in my eyes I I tell Carol it's above 50 and I bat my eyes on the outside I go to sweating so I I I'm good right about 50° on up when I go outside just with a t-shirt on if I'm moving around but now I come over to spray some weeds and stuff around the church and I wasn't moving very fast so it was a little bit chilly so I had on my t-shirt underneath but I had on a long sleeve shirt now that t-shirt is the appropriate attire for certain temperatures well the bride is the only type of material that is appropriate to make the groom a wife with now when you take foolish virgin material they can be worldly they can be rough on the edges they never let you straighten them out they never really come to a dedicated consecrated full complete surrender in the Lord so they got bumps and ins and outs and ups and downs and all this that and other and the Lord Jesus is wanting a mature bride who loves him more than anything else in this world she's in this world but she's not of it and she will use it yes she will use the world but she is constantly watching that she does not become marred by the world that she's using every day so he had to cut out to make this bride he had to have a specific type of material and it would be a Word Perfect material that would be a perfect reflection of the man she would marry so he did not take a big big old piece of rough Humane material and get that bride at it I'm talking about before you come to the Lord I'm talking about how he looks at you when you reach your completion now he looks at you by his own ability and he sees what you are in Christ Jesus which is not what you and I see at all we see old lump of clay an old pile of dust that we did so discouraged who you ever get discouraged with yourself and you think you ought to be farther along and y'all to be doing better and y'all to know this and y'all to know that oh my I tell you we can be pretty discouraging to ourselves can we not but he doesn't look at that what he looks at is the finished product of what the material will come into so he can take that material and cut it out oh he'll let it be chopped out by the prophets and then he'll send the finishing tools and the finishing tools will come in the form of pastors and teachers and evangelists and and missionaries and he'll start working on them and honing them down if you could have seen this Lumber that some of the brothers started here with it was just all rough Sawmill Lumber splinters all over it rough as it could be and yet to be able to see what it's been transformed into what if you can look by by the eyes side of face and realize that's what the Lord Jesus sees about our life now watch's this there now you're getting into bride material see see see you're getting into rapturing condition so he says the words rapturing strengths rapturing Faith rapturing power watch this one rapturing condition now that means listen to this each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees that means for the Ley every individual walks in a world with God Alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shout of a doubt nowhere you walk right on now watch on down in that paragraph he says now you're coming into perfect face perfect Perfection that cannot fail that face never fails yes he wanted he was was a Mystic to them with his perfect Faith so is it now with those who have perfect face are a Mystic to others can't you see why there is an element of carnal Believers around this message for years they have looked for a supplement to the message that they felt like would bring them to a rapturing face that would bring them to a rapturing condition now remember it's all based upon supply and demand if there was no demand among the people for things that aren't always word based there would be no Supply that's and if there was a supply and there wasn't people that would follow it the supply line would automatically die of itself and it's amazing I mean a man can preach whatever and there will be somebody that'll believe him a man can go contrary to the scripture and contrary to the message of the hour and there will be an element I I Marvel at people I honestly do and the the things that preachers will stand and preach and people will leave churches you know oh my uh good word-based ministers it's been that way for years it happened in the days of Paul whenever Paul dealt with the Galatians and he said at one time you would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me and he said now have I become your enemy because I've told you the truth well why because the judaizers came from Jerusalem and they tried to convert the Galatians and they did some of them and they turned them a people who Paul led to the Lord Jesus and they with their cunning words of wisdom actually turned them people right against God's Prophet who come and brought the word to him in the first place don't you understand Satan has done the same thing on down through every Church age he's doing the same thing right now he will get people and many times are not even preachers they're businessmen or this and that and the other and they debate about this and all you can't prove that I couldn't find the article for this and that and the other well while you're spending your time looking for it we're enjoying the blessings of God over here now if you need an article go ahead and see if you can find it but while you're hunting for that I'm going to be hunting for more quotes that I can be able to preach people into a body change with I don't figure there's no newspaper article that I'm going to find that's going to enhance my face in God's promised word of this hour and the church said but you see for those who need that type of thing it's like they simply cannot trust they've got to be able to put their hands on they've got to be able to feel it oh I've got to have an eyewitness of was I've got to have an eyewitness now you're a lying hypocrite that's right I said you are a lying hypocrite because you're requiring something of this Prophet that you never required of naam that you never required of habac so you're going to wait till all of habac of's word come to pass before you believe he was a prophet because they all ain't come to pass yet there's prophecies that Isaiah made thousands of years ago that still have not come to pass so are we going to wait to see if they all come to pass before we believe he was a prophet you're backwards God lets prophecies come to pass in your day and that gives you Faith to believe and wait on the others that will come to pass maybe even after you've left the Earth well come on some of Isaiah's prophecies will not be fulfilled to the Millennium some of his prophecies and Isaiah 66 will not be fulfilled until the eth day Ezekiel 44-48 will not be fulfilled until the Millennium Temple is built in the Millennium now you going to wait till that's fulfilled before you see if Ezekiel was a prophet oh come on wake up but a real son or daughter of God they just have it they read the same books they listen to the same types it's evident people can set under the same Pastor go to the same church have the same Association and have the same fellowship and one it will be revealed to and the other one it will pass right over and they argue and they debate about it well Benny hen said this you know and Charles swend said that and so and so said this and so and so if you want to read Benny hen go right ahead maybe he's a hen for you hen but if you're an eagle I don't figure that Benny hen has got a whole lot to tell me Well Benny hen talked about William brandham so if you're going to listen to something Benny hen said go to what that hen said about an eagle but I got news for you there ain't no chicken going to be able to give me a diet where it's going to produce a Rapture in my soul I need to hear message Pastor I need to hear message evangelist I need to hear message teacher I need to hear the message prophet of God in order to build a faith in me to get me ready to meet my loved ones woo now now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that faith never fails yes he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa now this is 1963 so brother Brandon was saying that there was some people on the Earth even then that already had perfect Faith come on Saints they have perfect faith when was this preached August the 25th 1963 August the 25th 1963 so what about August of 2024 don't you see those elect were living right up as far as they could go now remember the rising of the sun hadn't been preaching Easter cell hadn't been preached yet Harvest Time hadn't been preached yet turn on the light hadn't been preached many sermons had not yet been preached by August the 25th 1963 and yet there was an element of people there that had already attained to perfect Faith which is what mature Faith so you ask God for something sometimes sometimes God says yes sometimes God says no sometimes God says wait a while and you still believe it amen how many's had it happen to you you still trust him oh you might get disappointed now anybody ever get disappointed when God says no anybody ever get disappointed whenever God says wait I sure that's the human element of us but our disappointment does not override the spiritual mystical part in our soul what is that friended that's born by the Breath of God Wow Let's stand praise be to God Amen I want you to listen to how this leads up and jariah a secret believer notice this date 1955 my how great it is to know that the anointing of the holy spirit that will take the church and the Rapture someday is present already there in 1955 and the seals hadn't been opened so an anointing was already here watch this I love this part end time evangelism the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture can't you see why Satan is going to do everything he can to pull you away from this message that's why all these scoffers in the last days had to raise to get you to question the validity of this message cuz if you listen to it with the question well I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure and trusted I'm not sure and trusted that's what it's all for to get you to question the validity and the authenticity of this prophet and his message you see that's what Satan done in the book of numbers to the people of Israel amen you remember the story of course Joshua and Caleb go 10 other spies come back and they come back with an evil report of God no of the land right they didn't say God's mean God's awful I tell what that God I'll tell you boy he's a man alive that God he is sorry he ain't no good it wouldn't saying nothing about God they were saying it about their supposed inheritance oh it's a big land oh it's up the inhabitants of the land thereof there ain't no way we can ever do it but K said wait a minute what are you talking about it's laying right before us it's ours let's go take it and where did that report come from well according to what Caleb said about it I preached it brother Paul Sunday night it come from among his Brethren you understand it ain't the Catholics it ain't the Baptists it ain't the method Methodist people rather that has tried to do so much damage to this message it's former message people our brethren Mama the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Oh my bring them back to the face of the fathers the Pentecostal part right how many wants the Pentecostal part the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore sayith the Lord that's the real event or end time evangelism end time evangelism is getting the bride ready or we're going to pray for sick that ain't bride sure well we're going to preach the foolish virgins if I foodish vir I'm going to do it if I can help a Baptist my goodness they may never Embrace this message I'll do whatever I can for everybody amen I'm going to say a kind word I'm going to pray for him I'll do whatever I can do that woman I told you about in Sams not long ago that woman had on pants a woman had cut hair I didn't say said look S I can't pray for you my faith will not allow it but I felt the spirit of God St me right there in Sams I figured I better obey him I told you was going to call an ambulance or get her a wheelchair whatever to C her out of there me and Carol went through the store getting the rest of the stuff we need and Carol said look at there we looked up between the aisles they wasn't that woman wasn't in a wheelchair and she wasn't a no C but she was walking out pushing that buggy out why the Lord God come down in Sam's amen hallelujah praise the Lord let your light so shine before men come on children let's let the Lord Jesus manifest himself don't you love him with all your hearts oh my let's let's bow our heads together if you would my my Lord Jesus Lord I pray tonight father help us if we have to go back and listen to it again or again God I pray you'd make it real to us father we're not trying to make ourselves unusual and peculiar and odd we will be odd enough when the new birth transforms us we will be a very unique and very strange people those of our families that aren't converted will not understand us I know Lord by some of my own family that think I'm too religious and I'm probably a religious crank and I'm a religious fanatic but I'd rather be a religious fanatic than a football or a baseball or a basketball or a denominational fanatic everybody's going to be addicted to something so I'm going to be addicted to Jesus help us Lord I don't want to try to make myself different and make myself odd Lord but I just believe that if we live with you in our hearts as the type of HST in the center of gravity everything we do we pray about we pray about where we live we pray about business ventures we pray about where we go to school we pray about friends that we have we pray about the company that we keep I'm convinced you would keep us from a lot of hurts and things in life if we would pray about them I'd rather have two or three good friends than 500 497 of them's going to break my heart lie on you or whatever you might have spared me of a lot of them I pray Lord that you would help us Lord Jesus May the elect of the Word of Life Church pull their eyes from mother father brother sister College High School careers or they'll do that on the side that's just side stuff but their main focus is Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not really strange that would be be odd and unusual to the world and odd and unusual to denominational people but what's really bizarre Lord yeah is whenever we're odd and unusual to folks who say they believe this message cuz we live and walk in a world that only the initiated understand Lord God as I sat Carol and I in a room the other day ministering to someone hundreds and hundreds of miles away from here sitting there just praying under my breast and waiting on you we sat there for a couple of hours just talking Carol was sitting there with me praying I'm sure and all of a sudden your presence hit me as I looked up it was like I could see it in the lights and I knew it was time so I Rose from my seat and went over prayed for the individual and your presence come down oh Jesus I know if we follow you we'll be laughed at ridicule made fun of Jesus I love you and I want to put you first help me father and how many young men young women maybe older ones as well you want to be what God has made you to be and remember keep in mind I'm not talking about you making yourself odd I'm just talking about you surrendering to the Lord Jesus and he uses you for whatever he's called you to do and remember he will never lead you contrary to his word he will never lead you contrary to do anything contrary to his scripture or what the teaching of his Prophet has told us and when you feel led to do something and either you find it yourself or it's sent to you by other people and they show you that what you feel led to do is contrary to scripture and the message of the hour leave that thing as fast as you can because you'll be given a period of Grace and if you override it you'll move out of the perfect will of God into the permissive will of God then you open yourself up to all kinds of demons oh Jesus Keep Me Lord Keep Me Jesus Keep Me true Lord help me Father Lord I know even in the realm of gifts your Prophet told us Satan can hand out them gifts them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls oh God how many have we seen down through the years that felt like they had a gift of God and watch what it leads to the people that it leads astray and even people say they believe the message and speaking in tongues and prophesying and telling people to leave their wives or their husbands and go be married to somebody else in the the church and saying thus sayeth the Lord dear God no Lord I will speak I think I can on behalf of this church we do not want any of them kind of gifts we want gifts that tell the truth that's contrary to your word oh Jesus we worship you tonight father Hallelujah thank you Lord can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus We Worship You Lord great awesome Mighty God may your mystical power come down among us tonight father heal those that are sick Lord several in our church are going through really difficult times father Lord you know the same with sister Tres we're believing you Lord God for your Mighty hand to move Upon Our sister's body Lord and I don't just pray for her I pray for her children I pray for brother Randy Lord I know that as a human he can't keep from being concerned and troubled Lord naturally about such a thing that doctors would say but father May that mystical part of us kick in Lord I pray for Brother Steve Nome tonight as well Lord you see surgery and Lord waiting on a pathology report you don't know what that report's going to say but even if it says something bad we already know another report and we choose to believe the report of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus as I sat and talked with him and his wife yesterday and heard their confession of Faith there in the hospital Lord and we had prayer you moved in a little little while and it text me later to let me know a couple of different things that they praying about and you moved by your great presence our brother able to go home today by the grace of God lord you see people who live in that realm and as I was listening to this perfect Faith sermon I stopped the tape and I I copied and paste it and sent it to Carol and told her to send it back to me so I could send it to Brother Steve sister tresa if you haven't read it brother Bram says it's something like this faith in your heart you believe God's word you're a Mystic and all that sort of thing the doctor could tell you you're going to die your respiration is gone your heart your blood pressure all that he mentioned several things and it'd say there's no hope for you you could life in that doctor's face face rather and he said you could be like Elijah as he was talking to them false prophets and so why don't you scream a little louder maybe he's gone on a hunting trip or a fishing trip you could life in the doctor's face because it has been revealed to you oh praise the Lord Jesus now friends if you're not there tonight don't be discouraged cuz we have a word from the Lord through this prophet and his message of the hour that there is a church in the making that is going to rise to this place Hallelujah just as the foolish virgin will rise to theirs as the Antichrist will rise to his you and I will rise to ours they're doing it without a surrendered will to God how much more can God do with us if we will surrender our all to him tonight they're doing it not even with the intention they don't even believe in God many of them they don't love him they're not doing it to fulfill his purpose God has put it in their hearts the Bible said to fulfill his will they don't even want to do it but he's put it inside their heart it's a power that overpowers them well if the spirit of Prophecy is that powerful to move on people that are agnostics and infidels and the spirit of Prophecy would drive them to obey God's word what about the spirit of love that moves upon bride material and that bride is crying day and light Lord Jesus I love you Lord I want to please you Lord forgive me Lord I I'm not where I want to be that's your petition that's your cry and you think you're not going to fulfill God's word hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus oh we worship you tonight father Lord move for the needs of your people Lord many that are sick and couldn't be here tonight in this service We join our faith together for him Lord as priests we come for you tonight on their behalf Lord we believe we will see Miracles we will see Miracles we will see the phenomenal power of God we will see what seemed like impossible because we are believers in your promis word lord and there ain't enough devils in hell to stop us from fulfilling our prophecy maybe there's a daughter of God tonight that's got on a green chcken shirt maybe there's a mama here tonight that's been asking God for healing asking God for salvation for her son or her daughter but she's veiled tonight in a green checkered shirt of Prophecy she's arriving right this very night for God to fulfill that promised word oh make it real to us Lord Jesus make it real to us Lord God I give my strength I give my energy I give my body I give my mind I give my spirit Lord God I ain't got much but whatever I've got I give to you Lord use it for your glory father how many will pray that prayer with me not right now do you mean it with all all your heart What About It young people you want the Lord Jesus to have your strength your mind your heart your soul what about it older people what about it ministers what about it deacons h hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus take us Lord take us Lord Jesus use our youth like never before Lord use our ministers like never before Use Me Lord God I pray like never before help us father that we can bring the anointed word to your people it's no wonder to me that we've even got message preachers that don't want to preach the message no more and they don't want to read no more and I'm thinking what are they thinking what are they thinking that they do not want to preach the message from their pulpits apparently they put more value on their own words than they do the value of God's Prophet but Lord Jesus as long as you give me strength and wisdom help me father to be able to preach the message of the hour I'm not called to read I'm called to preach I'm not called to P play I am called to preach the gospel and your Prophet said the highest form of the Gospel being brought is by the preaching of the word I have brought the highest form tonight that there is in the land lord and that is preaching of the word of God we receive it Lord Jesus as if you here were standing before us I receive it myself Lord as if it was you that walked out of that office with that iPad as if it was you that read those scriptures and that quotes I believe father your presence is that real I believe your presence and your anointing in this prophetic hour that we are living is so upon the Earth to anoint your bride material that we can say hallelujah that you are not just coming but you are here here you are here your presence is here to heal your presence is here to save your presence is here to deliver oh Lord God pass this way tonight father we love you Lord Jesus we worship you with all of our souls Lord God we magnify your name
