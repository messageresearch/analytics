here tonight have a pass and it's filled with many facts but Lord there's a truth that it's already been settled Lord your grace and mercy by sending us a a message in this hour Lord transformed our hearts changed our lives Lord and we're here tonight not because of anything that we had done any Merit of our own but father it's by your grace your mercy Lord your loving hand father reached down and you completely did away with the facts and Lord we're here today by your truth and we just God we ask this this evening that you'll just come and speak to our hearts Lord that you would be the voice behind the voice father it not be a man standing here to try to say anything that would help anybody personally but Lord may it be you to come and and just console the Heart Tonight Lord you you see the need here at the church you see what the church has been through the great Affliction but Lord we believe right now father that you're still God you're still on the throne and you're still much able tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think so we just Commit This service into your hand hands Lord and we just want to say thank you for it now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles we can be turning to 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 7 just want to greet you in the precious name of the Lord just say what a great honor it is to be here with you this evening you each of you have been in our prayers the church has been in our prayers the Reagan family the Parker family has been on our prayers you know there's churches as we have we're sister churches and yet there's a great bond between many of us and our churches and when you suffer we suffer and you've not suffered alone and sister Erica didn't go down and defeat but she's going to rise in Victory right and that's what we believe tonight the truth is she's already won the truth is between 6:00 and 9: in the morning she's going to come walking through these doors the truth is she's already waiting on us the truth is it ain't over yet God has to final save tonight and so we just we just want to want to greet you and just I'm glad to have my wife with me my daughter Rebecca was supposed to be here tonight but she kind of took a sickness from the camp and his home or back at uh the house there running fever but we want to thank brother Donnie for having us uh glad that he and sister kurl can get away and trust that they can get a time of refreshing after everything settles here and want to say thank you to brother Caleb and sister Ruth for having us they've taken us in like orphans but I'm going to tell you man I've been living like a king and house it's been wonderful I just told my wife said I sure hope we hadn't overextended our stay but we're we're greatly honored to be here and we bring greetings from our church our pastor brother Tim but if you have your Bibles here I want to speak to you tonight on this ain't going to be the end this ain't going to be the end you believe that tonight how many of you come to have church tonight now Brother Lou kind of gave a preface of how I preach so you know you've seen us uh I'm not going to be a berserk up here but we just want to say something that's going to encourage you but we find here in 2 Corinthians 4 and: 7 but we have this treasure this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death of for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present s us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man's outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and external weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you tonight you can have your seats sure enjoy the specials and the youth choir it's great to see the young people appreciate that great to see the young people tonight just worshiping the Lord I think we have seen a change in our youth in this message over the last maybe the five to six years we've seen a shift we've seen those that you know they didn't want to have anything to do with it it was the rules of does and don'ts but now there's been such a love affair and these young people are are just apt to get to every camp meeting they can I know for you got four kids like me you take out home loans and send them to these camps cuz it means that much to you but you know I just enjoy to see their Zeal for the Lord and so thankful for that we look here in Psalms 34 and: 18 the Bible says that the Lord is n unto them that have a broken heart and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord we become a Christian and our lives are committed to God it's not going to be a flowery better eats it's not going to be just you know cupcakes and and and pancakes and anything else and and things like that but we're going to go through hard times and even as churches we're going to face difficult moments but the Bible says the Lord deliver them out of them all we have a promise tonight that God will deliver God's not going to allow you to keep going down in that same path of Destruction God's not going to let your young people go down in destruction but we have a promise that God is is faithful and he's faithful to his word and he's faithful to his people that will uphold his word and we know that as long as we're in this world and long as we're in these bodies I don't know about you but these bodies ain't perfect yet but as long as we're in these this body this this decaying Humanity we're going to face trouble we're going to face hardships we're going to face many difficult times but though this outward man perish the Bible says the inward man is renewed day by day by day by day by day how are you renewed cuz you feed on the word of God day by day by day by day we're not trying to get in on our own marriage or what family we're born into or or what church we're attend no the inward man is renewed by the word of God that's why God sent us a prophet God sent us a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith so that the inward man would be renewed and draw strength from the word because he knows this is not how it [Applause] [Music] ends oh Hallelujah see there's going to be times and it feels like even here maybe for a local church you're feeling like it's trouble on every side yeah trouble on every side but the inward man is invigorated he's renewed and the Bible tells us I love how the Bible puts it we're troubled on every side that word trouble means to be squeezed how about how many of you have ever been squeezed you just you feel the pressure of this age you know some people are looking for a squeeze stupid I'm ain't looking for I'm looking to get out of the squeeze but people are looking for the squeeze to come and when the squeeze comes we know he's coming look church I don't know if you're de dumb and blind but the squeeze is here we're persecuted on every side the Bible tells us we're troubled we're squeezed we're in his grasp we're pressed hard but not distressed Oh Glory to God tonight we may be in a battle but we ain't lost to war yet we may be persecuted but God is still on our side the facts may be stacked against you but the truth is we've already won the truth is we serve a living God the truth is he's still on the throne Bible tells us that we're perplexed and that word perplex is filled with uncertainty sometimes how many sometimes you don't know which way to go you're praying for answers and answers are not there you're trusting and you're like Lord are you even hearing my prayer the Bible says we're we're perplexed we fill with uncertainty yet not in Despair and the word despair is at at a complete loss as those that have no Hope Oh church we got a hope we got our anchor steadfast and sure that's behind the veil let me tell you we got something to be glad about tonight we got something to worship God about tonight will you say brother Joe something just drastically happened to our church I understand that and I grieve with you but yet the word is still true God is going to see us through this God is going to see you you through this oh this ain't the end church this is only the beginning of great things for Word of Life Church bible would tell us that we're persecuted pursue from place to place follow around with menaces and curses and reproaches imprisoned and threatened with the severest of tortures I don't know about you but my I feel like that every day we're persecuted but not forsaken brother Jackie thank you Lord Brother Jackie even in your old age you may have been persecuted and you've been perplexed there's been times you didn't know which way to turn but God had never left you alone and you're still here as a mighty warrior still standing for this truth sa said well I'm going to take them I'm going to take them by this and I'll take him by that but the devil don't have the final say God has the final word God has the final say and he's here to T tonight it ain't going to end like that amen we've been cast down and that word there means to be thrown down dashed into pieces but yet not destroyed oh I love that not not ruined we don't lose that word destroyed there means to lose we don't lose Church why cuz God can't lose and though we're troubled on every side perplexed and persecuted and cast down the Bible never states that the believer is defeated right the Bible never states that we we go down and defeat we lose it's over that's not what the Bible says but to every contradiction to the persecution God said there's a promise of Resurrection God says there's a promise of a new day God says there's a promise that this is not how it end it ain't over until God says it's over and God's still on the throne he's still full of rich and mercy and Grace for you [Applause] tonight many times the adversary has Us in his grasp many times we're troubled amilies go through Cycles troubles in the home churches go through Cycles Seasons trouble come to churches it seems like the adversary wants to get you at your weakest moment when you've been in battle and you you smelt the breath of the enemy in your face grasp his hands upon you brother that's real when he whispers in your ear there's no hope for you you might as well quit you might as well stop while you even trying don't you understand you just wasting your time the pastor's time the church's time your family's time you're wasting their time but I'm here to tell you tonight you're not wasting time church God has called you for this oh let me just tell you like one back in 19 1979 there was a man by the name of John Paul Jones how many famili with John Paul Jones oh he was a he was a general there and he he sail the Great season this was during the Revolutionary War time and it was the battle at flambo and yet here he was little lone ship he was after the British army sometimes you may feel isolated sometimes you may feel all alone and he had 41 ships that were coming against him and he turned his boat to the broad side of the enemy ship and he blasted his two 18lb guns and when they blasted the the the guns blew up and blew a great big hole in the ship and the ship was was on fire and his ship was taking in water and it seemed like he was going down and the captain from the other ship said do you surrender he said I have yet begun to fight oh come on church tonight oh you may have been hit enemy hit just church and he come and put a hoing but I'm here to tell you tonight we have yet begun to fight we're standing tonight for the truth we're standing for healing we're standing for deliverance we're standing for thust sayith the Lord we're now backing up we're not giving in we're standing here we're going to fight to the Finish we're going to fight to the end see Satan wants you to surrender he wants you to give up and walk away in defeat brother Lance Parker called me this morning or this evening and he sent me a text the day before sister Erica passed away and he said this is her comment that stupid devil right here she is gasping for breath that stupid devil he knows that it ain't going to end like this and so that's where I took my text tonight it ain't going to end like this right no it look like it ends in defeat it looks like we're taking on water it looks like we're destroyed oh it looks like we're persecuted it looks like we're defeated oh but Church we're not persecuted we're not in this we're not forsaken it is not the end of the end we're just beginning to fight come on Word of Life this is the time you fight like you never fought before this is the time you gather together like a church body like you never had before this is a time that we were we come together with one resolve one determination whatever we're going to live and we're going to preach and we're going to stand for this word this is a time not to lay down your weapon this is a time to fight don't give up don't walk away this is a time to be greater committed to the cause this is a time to be more determined than ever to be Fearless sometimes you know what it takes to get Fearless a nice drink of whiskey you're like brother Joe what do y'all do down in Louisana well I'm going to go ahead and be honest we get drunk right oh there was a a bar on 1700 three Highway 371 called even like Tabernacle you can walk in there sober but oh let me tell you you get your a good drink of that Holy Ghost you get your a good drink of that man you feel like you're 10t tall and bulletproof like that little mouse fell in that wine jar just Goble Goble Goble go back down and drink more by the time that jar was empty he kep crawling out of that jar where is that old cat at anyway let me tell you where is that Old Devil at anyway we have just begun to fight this ain't the end this is just the beginning and we're coming together we're rallying together what for the final push for the final call for the great fight we're not going down in defeat but we're coming together the church body Satan wants you to think there's no chance of survival you know we find today reports are coming in over over and over this one went cancer that one went cancer and when you hear it fear just seems to grip us doesn't it fear begins to grip us but you know I'm determined to preach Faith like never before that God is still on the throne either God's word is truth or it's not either he's a Healer or he's not either he's a deliverer or he's not right either the prodical come home or they don't but I'm here to tell you I can testify that God is his word and his word never fails in the mouth of a Believer amen yes sir but Satan wants you to give up he wants you to surrender he don't want you to think there's any chance of survival he wants you to think that death is the only option he doesn't want you to fight but Winston Churchill would say it like this when his country was in the greatest battle of their life greatest conflict he said we shall defend our Island whatever the cost we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender maybe the devil's whispering in your ear surrender just give up walk away don't you see God don't keep his word I'm here to tell you we're going to fight for truth church let me just put in my own words tonight we're going to we're going to defeat in this message with everything that we got whatever the cost we're going to fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for our healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight for the supernatural we're going to fight for prayer L we're going to fight for alter call we're going to fight all devil here to tell you tonight we're going to fight it ain't going to end like you think it is there a great big church here that's all Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the power of God tonight we're not backing up it may appear that the enemy's winning it may many are sick diagnosis of cancer coming in left and right homes are being destroyed marriages are in shambles many have walked away from this message young people strung out on drugs right but it don't end like that I'm telling you Church it ain't going to end like that brother B Will Tell Us in the greatest battle ever fought he goes there you are he said it takes the word of God

strains right there's a lot of things you got to overcome as a young person yes sir a lot of complexes you got to overcome am I good enough am I pretty enough am I skinny enough well let me tell you you ain't going to ever be enough that's right because devil was going to keep putting something out there a little bit better a little bit skinnier a little bit better looking a little bit prettier come on oh but we're not basing ourself and our character and where God wants us on anything that the devil has to offer so you got to pull down and cut your way through complexes and cut your way through depression cut your way through those suicidal thoughts right right brother Andrew and I have done a lot of prayer lines in youth camps together a lot of you find a lot of times that they come in with depression and suicide begins to to attach itself to depression and you begin to work with that patient and work with that young person and you finally click to it and you find what the issue is and we we many times we have cast that thing off because we got a right to cast it off but Satan tells well it's going to end like this you're going to cut your wrist you're going to die there's going to be so many people come to your your funeral and oh you're going to be remembered so great that's how he wants you to think come on brother I don't want be on the other side looking down because I've done something stupid stupid but we find you got to cut your way through these things cut your way through all these things that trying to come against you the Bible Will Tell Us in Ephesians 6 verse 10 finally my brother be strong in the Lord Lord notice not strong in your own self not strong in in some man's Doctrine not strong in where you go to church not strong in this that other but be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might see put on the whole armor of God and there's no armor for the back there's no retreat for the believer there's no surrender for the believer it's a on full on battle full on war you got to face him head on we find here says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places then he says take onto us the whole armor of God that we may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day God has prepared us to stand in this day and he's given us the equipment by which we are to stand in this day take on this word notice we're wrestling it's a contest we're not wrestling with flesh and blood me and brother Andrew or me and brother Joe or me and this other brother we're not wrestling because maybe I'm just a little bitty pipsqueak I mean I'm 5'5 and and a half that's right give me a hand clap I went to the doctor about 3 months ago and they told me uh you're 5' 5 and a half I'm like what my whole life I've been 5 six and A2 they robbed me of an inch brother Daryl I'm going tell you what I'm getting my inch back come on yeah I just turned 48 not too long ago and older you get the shorter you get the lost I mean I lost my hair thank God I got my wits about me but we find that we're fighting against principalities against wickedness in high places we're fighting to get back in our position as Sons and Daughters of God and their Satan and his minions and devil after devil trying to keep you from getting back to your position Satan don't want you to recognize who you are but from the beginning in the mind of God you always was a Son of God you always will be a Son of God there ain't enough devils in hell can take that away and if that's the casee then it don't have to end like this it don't have to go down like this we can take our position take our Authority and take our rights to the word and back Satan in a [Applause] corner amen we find today that many Believers even Christians many Believers today they're wrestling against anxieties fears brother Andrew how many times you deal with anxiet and fear in prayer lines fear that I'm not going to be healed fear that I'm not going to be saved fear that I can't keep the Holy Ghost fear that I'm going to go down in the feet worried about this anxiety and all pressur it up we they wrestle against depression complexes demon oppression and see these are not flesh and blood battles because if they were Flesh and Blood battles we'd go out and get the best AR-15 we can buy man we' have an armor full we could take care of but these things that you can't just go out and buy some weapon no but God has provided you exactly what you have need of God has given us the greatest protection not only for a defense but God has giving you what you need for an offensive War you know what I think many times we pray and we oh God help us here and oh God help us there and when the enemy comes in or we're in the battle we're in the midst of the trenches it's always the bride playing defense I'm here to tell you tonight it's time that the bride takes the promises of God and goes on the offense the Bible says that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you so when you're in the midst of the battle he's right there when the when hell's all against you he's right there there's no way for the believer to go down in the feet so spray your shoulders back tonight and begin to press the devil I'm not backing up Satan I'm not giving up tonight I'm holding this word that faith is the promise healing is my promise deliver is my promise my kids are my promise my family is my promise my marriage is my promise I'm taking God in his word tonight it's my promise I'm not backing off of It Go on the offense for [Music] once but B tell us in putting on the whole armor of God he said we don't wrestle with toe holds flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual powers wrestlers see they practice on breaking toe holes and things he says but you don't break these toe holes no he says could you imagine a wrestler come out with his fingernails polished got his little jelly band on what would Jesus do he wouldn't be wearing a jelly band on oh I better watch out huh right I'm not at home brother Joe all got his fingernails polishes trunks on wearing shorts got his trunks on oh yeah we still believe in a closed line religion the last time I [Applause] heard he goes but you don't break these toes no coming out there with his fingernails polished trunks on with all kind of gold beads around it he goes look like a pretty good wrestler but that's just only intellectual see he hasn't got a hidden strength there that when the enemy gets a Toe Hold on him that he can just pull them out of it see his intellectual beads around him and everything don't make much difference so all of our intellectual means nothing if they're in the hidden power that's right you can know this Bible backwards and forwards you can know every quote backwards and forward but if there is no anointing behind it if there's no power behind it it ain't nothing but head knowledge let me tell you God you'll take that head knowledge and you go right to hell with head knowledge but God has given us an anointing in this hour God has given us a word in this hour and it's got to be more than intellectual understanding it's got to be a Supernatural anointing behind this word to make this word live to go out into the highways and the byways and catch young men by the name of Reed ball and bring them back to the house of God oh in an unexpected place in an unexpected way he goes into some old place to have breakfast not even his favorite place I think God's pretty on time it may not be in his favorite place but it was God's favorite place and God thought so much to come by there and he was just bit annoyed with the old man that begin to bring him the word you may be a little bit annoyed tonight with the young man that's bringing you the word right oh but God God's going to never lose it may look like he was going down in the feet drugs ravishing his life destroyed him pulled him out of the house of God his own daddy didn't want anything to do with him right don't bring your hide to my house I don't want to be around that but God said they don't have to end that way God said it ain't over yet God says I got the final say God says you come from God you come from my thoughts and if you come from my thoughts and that seed is on the inside I don't care how much dirt That Old Devil puts on you how much sin he puts on you whatever he it ain't going to stop that seed Oh Glory to God it ain't going to stop that seed that seed is coming up it's going to come up tonight Church somebody will take that word and believe it's for me it's for my young person it's for my child it's for my grandchild that word is saved today church if it could sa re ball it can save your child oh it ain't got to end that way God is still on the throne he's still full of Mercy he's still full of grace brother Reed where are you tonight yes sir sir I Ed your testimony about 3 weeks ago and I preached the message believe are have faith and believe and I want to tell you this I wanted to tell you in the back but I'm going to tell you right now in front of everybody I showed your testimony yours and your brothers talk to your dad beforehand to get the permission I said he's a bigger boy than I am I got to get permission he mean he said he likes to do Waits I'm like woo I know how big your daddy is told the church he can bench press our church but I showed your testimony at our church and I was preaching on have faith and believe a young man came up at the end of service he said brother Jose this is my third chance so re don't you think your testimony didn't reach somebody already it's done Touch Somebody Satan said he was going down Satan said it was over Satan said he took his family out of the house of God say that he'll never amount to anything he's going down in destruction but by somebody's testimony of a god who's rich in Mercy that young man came and fell on my shoulders and begin to cry his way back to Calvary and he's now serving serving God I'm telling you it ain't got to end the way the devil think and it ain't going to end the way the devil thinks God is rich in Mercy he's still on the throne he's still saving he's still delivering he's still healing he's still oh Hallelujah he's still setting free tonight and he wants you to know Church no matter what you're going through he's got it for says we're in a wrestling match wrestling not with fine dress intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with power and the promise of God which can break any hold on the devil that's right you're intellectual ain't got no power that devil fighting you that intellect that psychology it ain't going to break that toe hole but you take him back to this one time you take him back to to this where's sister Armstrong at is it Armstrong Jessica nope brother Tony's wife Tony big Tony y'all got a Tony here big Tony Tony stand up you're making me look bad I saw you the other day doing parking Tony MRA where's his wife at Angela right Jennifer I don't know these people's name I ain't never I'm not from here all right well they're on vacation but we're not we're in church so let's have church so a couple years ago at our youth camp just to give you another little testimony this is okay tonight at our youth camp it was Sunday morning after the all night prayer line prayer line went to about 1:00 in the morning I was exhausted I got into a bed about 2:00 I was up at 6:00 trying to get the sunrise service but you know I got a slogan call coffee before we pray I'm sorry I was in no mood to pray yet but she had a young girl out there and this girl was tormented and and so they come they said brother Joe sister McGraw needs you over there to pray for I'm like look I'm going to finish my coffee and I know this is going around the world this is it sounds awful awful doesn't it so I I I chugged it real quick and I went over there and be to talk to this young girl and sister Jennifer mgra was right there and we're kneeling down and I'm talking to her and she says you know her friend came in the prayer line night before she had a demon on her so me and my wife and sister lyia oy brother Aaron's wife were in the back we were working with this young girl and she's foaming out the mouth like a dog and this she's raring up and brother darl I'm tell you she was a h 100 times her strength she was a young 16y old girl I work with her for 45 minutes I was wiped out just trying to hold her down so we could pray and begin to begin to be able to cast that devil off and brother Matt McGary came back here and we just begin to work with her because he goes to her church and he knew some things and begin to deal with with anyway we got her to we got this devil cast off of her and I was like oh praise God well the next morning I go over there and this young girl goes to church with she was all nerved up I don't want to be like my friend I'm I'm scared I'm nervous I got all this anxiety I said well oh we'll just praying you can go back in service and enjoy the service it's a sunrise service so I go and lay my hands on her and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to speak I don't like you I said well good I don't like you either so I'm glad we got that settle and see the devil thought he was going to stay there he thought he was going to hide behind that he was going to scare me like I'm afraid of some Demon and I be to pray with her and I said look Satan you can't stay you're an unwelcome guest here you're a squatter here you can't remain here she don't want you here and by the authority of this word we cast you out and that thing left her and she went back inside rejoicing and praising God and she was just at our meetings and she still rejoicing and praising God what am I telling I'm telling you that God has the final say God has the final burden God has the final word your condition ain't too too far for God to move on tonight he's still on the throne Church brother will tell us he defeated Satan with it is written I didn't come up with some psychology to pray for that young girl I just laid hands on and prayed I just believed and you better know what you stand when you start fighting Toe to Toe with an enemy brother tell us the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions did y'all hear that on the job in the school in the car in church at your house in your quiet time the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime under any condition but it takes a hidden man of the heart oh let me get just keep moving on here woo yall a good crowd to preach to tonight Bible would tell us in Romans 8 they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh 8 and verse 5 but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now I know I'm sitting here talking to a bunch of cherubs y'all ain't never had a caral thought have you not us nope we're Word of Life JC yeah we got this thing covered up brother Joe look around no we got Colonel THS Church come on but the Bible says to be carnally minded see to be carnally minded is imity it's it's against God see it cannot please God but the the caral mind is imity against God but and we're told that that though that walk out through the spirit and that's what we want to get into tonight is the spirit we don't want to walk and come into church all worked up in our cality and in our minds and all the pressures of the world we're living in Leo DEA we're living in Satan's Eden and we hear wars and rumors of war and we're worried about Israel we worried about Ukraine and got all this on them M no that ain't our that's not our battle that's not for us to worry about God's got all that worked out but to be carnally minded is to the things of the flesh to give into the things of the flesh the propensities of our nature and we know that our nature is a fallen nature but God wants us to be spiritually minded to cater to the things of the word things of the Holy Ghost let God be able to speak to you through that still Small Voice so he can nudge you and you know that that's God you're not so consumed with the things of life and the Affairs of life that you miss the nudging of God Amen cuz I know just to be honest with you we all at some point in our walk have missed it and then Satan begins to work on your mind you missed it you missed a call of God you you should have prayed longer come on she would have just spent five more minutes 10 more minutes 30 more seconds if you have not given up God have done something see that's how he wants to get he wants to work on your carnality but see we our battle is not in the mind or it's not in the carnal the carnality of our mind but it's in our spirit realm Satan's trying to defeat us and try to to bring us down and we find here in Romans 12:1 Paul would tell us I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed and that word conformed there means to conform to the same power pattern to be not conformed to the world but to be transformed metamorphosed right you come in like a caterpillar chewing around you know brother J for climbing up that tree walking out on that Branch just chewing away caterpillar but then you you settle in a place oh yeah you settle in Johnson City Tennessee spending a cocoon in Word of Life JC and all of a sudden you've been there a year you've been there two years some of you been in that cocoon a long time you been you still in that cocoon but eventually what comes out of that cocoon is not the same thing that went in that cocoon oh a butterfly went in but a Son of God comes out a sinner comes in all tatted up drunk up Dred up but oh he been spun himself around the word of God and then got into a spirit spiritual atmosphere and he comes out a beautiful creature he comes out a real Son of God where the things of the of the world the things of the flesh no longer have a pull on him no longer have a desire in his heart anymore no why because why he's a different creature he's been transformed by the word of God he's been metamorphed by the word he's been changed by the word church let me tell you I know what I'm talking about when I was 21 years old I was headed to a devil's hell and a sinner great oh but God rich in Mercy came down and he said turn your car around I was trying to kill myself but God said it don't have to end that way I was out on all night drunk by 2:00 in the morning spirit of God I wouldn't I didn't grow up in a church didn't grow up in a message Church didn't grow up in a BAP my family was on drugs and things like that let me tell you it was an awfulness but there was a seed planted I said there was a seed planted I didn't know about that seed I didn't know that I come from God oh but through the memory of my father he be to share with me where I came from where I'm going and he came down one night about 2:00 in the morning and he said turn your car around I turned my car around I went home and up beside my bed and gave my heart to God let me tell you I ain't never taking it back oh I'm a Child of God tonight I'm a Child of God tomorrow I'll feel a child of God why because God said it don't have to end that way you don't have to kill yourself you don't have to go down in the feet you don't have to go down in the you're my child I'm coming by your way [Applause] tonight the natural mind notice 1 Corinthians 2 verse4 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him yes yeah neither can he know them because why they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we come on put your hand up we amen but we but we have the mind of Christ and let this mind that was in Christ be in you what was the mind of Christ he knew where he come from he knew what his position was he knew what his purpose was he knew what his calling was what am I telling you bride of Jesus Christ I'm telling you got to know who you are in this to you got to know that you come from God and you're going back to God and no matter what you face down here it don't have no hold on you because it can't

said there's no hope your wom is unfertile next slide now they got a little baby little baby girl Abigail touch her brother Joe why are you telling us this I'm trying to give you testimony I know you've been hurt I know you been shell shot but I'm here to tell you it don't have to end that way God has got testimony after testimony after testimony of his Saving Grace of his miraculous power and he's still here tonight to do it for you church to meet your need tonight God's able let me begin to wrap this up tonight next slide how many know what this is I know you're intelligent it's a chess board how many know what the main piece on that board is what is it it's the king the king is the main piece on the board and let me just tell you your king is the main piece chess it's a game of wit it's where you make moves to get your opponent to make moves it's to where you have to out strategize manipulate your opponent and sometimes you may have to make sacrifices brother Joe you may have to lose one of your pieces so that you can get your opponent into a position that you can Checkmate him see there is a story next slide how many have ever seen this picture this is called checkmate we find here there was a there's a story this picture once hung in the Lou Museum in France and there was a one day there was a group of people coming by to look at the the the museum look at all the nice artifacts and all the artwork and and in this certain group there was a grandm an international chess champion he came in and he looked at the Mona Lisa and just passed it on by and he he looked here at this picture he was in International chess champion and he begin to study and we look at this picture here and we see that we have Satan here on the left but before that we have a chess board that's being played on a coffin cuz Satan is in battle for your soul and we have a king who looks for loone and lost and we have an angel looking over his shoulder it's like there's no hope they're in despair the young king is in checkmate that's what the picture is called so this painting we find that the legend has it this man stood and he looked at this painting and he studied this painting and he watched this painting and we find in this painting we have a lion here with his paw on a skull of the previous victim because there's no Escape so Satan thinks and we see this red feather in his cap which is an ancient emblem of craftiness and cunningness and you look at the pieces of Satan his pieces he is his own King his Queen is a voluptious woman his pieces are anger malice all these different Pride false Su doubt and unbelief and we find the young man's pieces are peace love joy happiness goodness and all these pieces but when you look at this and you look at the pieces here Satan has a lot more pieces than the king there's a spider here who's making making its way to spin another web of snare for this young king to get his next victim so we look at all this and we see that Satan is after our soul right and every move you make plays into his hand and every move he makes can play into your hand so we find that we have we're in a we're in a chest chess match who's going to outsmart the next one they say that a a good chess player can make one move at a time one move ahead of a time or an average chess player can make one move ahead at a time a good chess player can make four to five moves ahead but a grandmas can make 20 moves ahead at a time so he knows you make this move then he's got these next 20 moves made and see that's how Satan does some of you get on that website and you make that move then he's got you boom bo b Bo boom and now you're spiraling down a word of pornography or you go to make this move and you click on believe the sign all of a sudden now you're down this spiral Road of unbelief and that God sent a prophet and that this message is true so Satan's always trying to outsmart he's trying to always blur the lines of black and white and make everything gray things that we used to wouldn't allow in our house now they're welcomed music that we used to would not listen to now we listen to novels and books and magazines that we used to not want to look at now we just allow our kids to feed on them and look at them you know it's not hurting anybody so that's the thing see Satan is looking for weaknesses he's looking for weaknesses and if he can weaken Word of Life Church by getting you to not believe that he's still able that God's still able to he heal he finds that weakness he'll slip in there and he'll begin to manipulate that and he'll begin to bring this one down and that one down and that one down and that one down so we find Satan is always thinking ahead and he'll get you sometimes to make bad choices now how many of you ever made a bad choice yes sir all right praise God I'm in good company he'll make you make bad choices based on your feelings based on your complexes based on fears based on worries based on regrets based on past history family strains well this is who I am I just have to do this no you don't see Satan loves to do that and to back you in a corner but see we find the Bible says or as my wife sung that song the facts may be stacked up against you tonight you may be in a serious battle Satan's going backed you up and say well there's no hope for you there's there's no use of trying there's no use even believing for healing there's no use even believing for deliverance you got to be stuck that way this is who you are it's your makeup but the truth is he's already won the battle right see the facts may be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side see the truth is that it's not the end of the story God's the one with the pen in his hand and he told your Prophet pick up the pin and write yeah pick it up this is what I want you to tell my bride that she's a lovely woman oh Church to let you know where you come from cuz he knew you would need a message like this in this hour when all Hells are selling you you can come back to this word and it'll be your anchor so as we find the facts is that we're troubled on every side but the truth is we're not distressed facts is that we're perplexed sometimes we we don't know which way to go but the truth is we're not in despair the facts is we're persecuted but the truth is we're not forsaken the facts are that we're cast down and many of us been cast down many of time but the truth is we're not destroyed we're still here Church we're still believing we're still plugging the law let me just tell you this when the devil is all gone and he's defeated you'll still be standing you'll still be here when when that healing is happened and Satan is defeated he's cast into that Lake of Fire we'll still be worshiping we'll still be praising God what did God tell job job where were you when I hung the foundations of the world where were you job when the sons of God shouted for Jo he was reminding job before the first Affliction before he lost his family before he lost his well that job you were in my thoughts and if you was in my thoughts there you will be in my thoughts now nothing

tonight to deliver He's Able tonight to do whatever you have need of it's not the end of the [Applause] story amen yes sir amen let's get back to the painting as we bring this to a close Grandmaster standing there he's looking at this picture and he's staring at it and he's looking at it and all of a sudden somebody may want to take that cell phone call Satan may be wanting to tell you something he's looking at this picture and he's in the L Museum and all of a sudden he says wait hold up a minute it's all wrong the curator of the museum came over there what's all this excitement about why are you so emotional he said the painting is wrong it's wrong get a hold of the author of the painting because it's title wrong the King has one more move what am I telling you tonight Church of God
