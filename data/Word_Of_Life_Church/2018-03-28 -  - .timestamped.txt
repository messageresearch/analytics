[4:09] a tape just a little bit ago brother
[4:11] Branham talked about a young man that
[4:12] had never got to see the ocean in his
[4:14] life and he was so excited so just
[4:18] overwhelmed the fact that he was gonna
[4:19] get to visit the ocean and he was
[4:22] walking along the shore getting ready to
[4:24] go down to the ocean he met an old man
[4:28] and the old man said son where are you
[4:30] going he said I'm gonna get to see the
[4:32] ocean for the first time in my whole
[4:34] life I'm so excited
[4:36] the old man he said I've sailed the seas
[4:39] I've seen this ocean my whole life I
[4:42] don't see nothing to get excited about
[4:44] brother Branham said the reason he
[4:46] didn't is because he had got used to it
[4:48] now I want to say that just to say this
[4:51] you and me as Christians as individual
[4:56] servants of the Lord we don't want to
[4:58] never just get too used to it his

[9:15] this morning a man praise the Lord
[9:21] well God is so good to us I'm gonna let
[9:23] you be CD for just a bit while we look
[9:25] at her prayer requests this morning
[9:27] brother West you've done a great job for
[9:29] us last night I want to say thank you
[9:31] daddy
[9:33] thank you for being obedient to the Lord
[9:36] and well God is just so so good to his
[9:39] church he is so good to us this is from
[9:41] brother Joel Moyer the family there in
[9:43] Ohio the rescue that we would continue
[9:45] remember them in prayer concerning court
[9:48] dates that the Lord would just intervene
[9:50] the state don't get custody of their
[9:52] children the attorneys they're asking
[9:54] that we would just pray on that behalf
[9:56] that the Lord would intervene and let
[9:58] everything work out according to his
[10:00] divine purpose we believe he's able to
[10:01] do that don't we amen
[10:03] when continue to remember brother Donnie
[10:05] in prayer this morning he's about the
[10:07] same this morning and believing God for
[10:09] complete healing also brother Don and
[10:13] sister Carol want to thank everyone for
[10:14] their prayers so let's pray for our
[10:16] pastor and his wife this morning that
[10:18] the Lord would just touch him let him
[10:20] let him be alright I know God God is
[10:23] able to do that and Satan likes nothing
[10:25] better than to throw a servant of God on
[10:27] the shelf and put him out of commission
[10:28] but I'm gonna tell you he don't have
[10:30] enough sense to know that while he's out
[10:32] of commission
[10:32] there's golden nuggets dropping into his
[10:35] heart that's gonna bless the children of
[10:37] God so we we know that we know that
[10:39] something good will come out of
[10:40] something bad don't we man but the key
[10:43] straighter is having an echocardiogram
[10:45] on Tuesdays wearing a heart monitor and
[10:48] they're asking that we would remember
[10:50] him in prayer as we pray today one
[10:52] remember sister Christine Baker in
[10:54] prayer having severe pain in her neck
[10:57] this morning so let's just remember her
[10:59] as we pray want to want to pray for
[11:02] brother Frank Williams this morning also
[11:06] his daughter daily both are very
[11:07] sickening the healing touch so let's
[11:09] remember those folks as we pray and I
[11:11] believe that's all of our our written
[11:14] request all the in spoken prayer
[11:16] requests if you have a need something
[11:17] you'd like for this group to pray about
[11:19] we're serving a prayer answering God and
[11:21] we know that we continue to believe that
[11:23] I told you last night the Lord has
[11:25] touched my body and I want to
[11:27] and thank him for it he just he pestered
[11:31] us to death but he's knows he's got a
[11:33] little time to work on us and the old
[11:35] burger man he likes to take his shots at
[11:37] God's people but I'm gonna tell you
[11:38] something we get we guess the Fargo that

[13:12] this morning god bless you
[13:16] so glad to have you here this morning
[13:18] also brother Brian Taylor a longtime
[13:21] streamer from the state of Alabama he's
[13:24] visited with us again this morning going
[13:26] to be giving us the song just a little
[13:28] bit and looking forward to that so we're
[13:30] just we've got a lot going on here this
[13:31] morning brother West come this morning
[13:33] take us to the Lord in prayer as we pray
[13:35] appreciate our brother don't leave Amen
[13:38] we love you buddy
[13:45] real quick before before we go to the
[13:48] Lord in prayer there's one rule for the
[13:51] camp that I need to go over really quick
[13:53] in case somebody hasn't prepared
[13:56] properly in years past you know there's
[13:59] dress code rules and everything we want
[14:01] to we want to look out for the safety
[14:03] and the modesty of our of our sisters
[14:05] and brothers when they go to camp and
[14:07] and there's always a few who go down
[14:10] there you know that the Lord hasn't
[14:14] really dealt with yet and he usually
[14:15] deals with them when they're down there
[14:16] though but there's a you know always
[14:20] somebody that just kind of wants to push
[14:21] the envelope a little bit and because of
[14:24] that sometimes the rules have to seem a
[14:25] little bit too the stricter side and
[14:28] some of the sisters had been going in in
[14:33] Tom's Paston and maybe wearing leggings
[14:35] to account for a skirt that was a little
[14:37] too short and wasn't quite modest enough
[14:39] so they they have had to make a rule
[14:42] that there's no leggings in order to
[14:43] ensure that the skirts would be long
[14:45] enough because they're looking out for
[14:48] the holiness of the of our sisters and
[14:51] and their and you know trying to protect
[14:54] them and they're also you know trying to
[14:57] look out for the the Spirit that we
[14:58] bring in among us when we're when we're
[15:01] worshiping there at the camp we wanted
[15:02] to be the Holy Ghost we don't want it to
[15:04] be a religious spirit or something like
[15:06] that we want to be the Holy Ghost and so
[15:08] this is a protection and holiness is is
[15:12] something you know that the people of
[15:13] God are known for so we you know a lot
[15:16] of people may be concerned you know
[15:18] about about not using the leggings or
[15:20] like well that you know as an extra
[15:22] layer of protection you know if they
[15:23] were to fall down or or something like
[15:25] that well that they're just wanting to
[15:27] ensure that the skirts are long enough
[15:28] to protect our sisters without having
[15:32] the need for leggings so that's why
[15:33] they're outlawed completely and I
[15:35] wouldn't want somebody to get down there
[15:37] and they brought a bunch and and they're
[15:39] not prepared and then they get
[15:40] embarrassed we just wouldn't want that
[15:42] you know so that's why I have to make
[15:45] this announcement but other than that
[15:47] the rules are all the same and we'll go
[15:49] over them we have several visitors
[15:50] coming with us and riding on the bus so
[15:52] we'll go over the
[15:52] rules and stuff that's that's not
[15:54] changed all those are about the same and
[15:56] we never have an issue with that anyway
[15:58] we always have the the best and young
[16:01] people in the world by far and I'm so
[16:04] proud of them and I don't want it to
[16:06] seem when we talk about rules and stuff
[16:08] I don't want to seem like we have young
[16:10] people that are rebellious or
[16:11] hard-hearted or anything these are the
[16:13] finest in the world and that adds the
[16:16] truth I'm not to say that cuz I love
[16:17] them okay let's let's go to the Lord in
[16:24] prayer father I thank you so much for
[16:30] the body of believers across the whole
[16:33] world Lord I can feel us growing closer
[16:35] together in your in your love Lord and
[16:37] in your presence daily I can feel us
[16:39] just getting closer and closer to you
[16:41] Lord there's there several prayer
[16:43] requests here our pastor is still laying
[16:45] in his sickbed Lord and Lord we know
[16:47] that he is already healed we know that
[16:50] everyone who submitted a prayer request
[16:52] to appear today in faith Lord is already
[16:55] healed father we're speaking to the the
[16:58] lying symptoms that are coming against
[16:59] him and we're rebuking them in the name
[17:01] of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're
[17:02] believing together as the body of Christ
[17:04] as the the broad of the Lord Jesus here
[17:07] on the earth we're believing Lord as we
[17:09] lay these at your feet that we can fully
[17:11] trust you to do away with these symptoms
[17:13] and to restore each one to health and to
[17:15] raise them up Lord you said you would do
[17:18] it and we believe it and that's
[17:19] something that we're not going to back
[17:21] down from we're not going to turn and
[17:22] run Lord but we're going to stand boldly
[17:24] in the face of Satan and we're going to
[17:25] say you don't have a chance you don't
[17:27] have a chance when you come against this
[17:29] broad because our groom is our protector
[17:32] and he is the greatest of all the hast
[17:34] of all and there is no name higher than
[17:36] that of the Lord Jesus Christ we worship
[17:38] You Lord we love you Lord we feel the
[17:41] dearness of your spirit as it draws in
[17:43] we feel the heat of your conviction Lord
[17:46] in our hearts and we thank you for it
[17:47] because that's love too and Lord Jesus
[17:50] we just thank you for your word we thank
[17:51] you for the servant who's back there and
[17:53] who's prepared and studied to bring the
[17:55] word to us today Lord and we're looking
[17:57] forward to how you're going to speak
[17:58] through that man and talk to our hearts
[18:00] today and and take us one step closer to
[18:03] the rapture father that's what we want
[18:04] we want to
[18:05] this place one step closer we don't want
[18:07] to leave here the same as we came in or
[18:08] worse than we came in but we want to
[18:10] leave here

[18:16] have the freedom to walk in among this

[32:13] about the Lord Jesus that he has a pool
[32:17] that he wants us to be with him when you
[32:21] think about in Jesus prayer as I've said
[32:25] so many times but I like that he always
[32:29] you know not my will but dime be doing
[32:32] he came to do the will of the Father
[32:34] but he asked one thing the only thing in
[32:36] his prayer John's 1724 think it is he
[32:38] said I will that where I am there you
[32:41] may be also he only asked one thing
[32:43] that's all they ever asked a father for
[32:45] one thing and that's your fellowship
[32:48] that's that's wonderful that's wonderful
[32:51] I appreciate him well praise the Lord

[33:23] cards and and and it's just been in the
[33:26] hand of the Lord you know I haven't had
[33:28] any really roadblocks setbacks no flu no
[33:32] pneumonia just it's just been really
[33:36] hard to just you know you just can't use
[33:38] your arms you just can't you know for
[33:40] the first six eight weeks you know I
[33:41] also had to kind of tie me down just
[33:43] don't do nothing you know but I'm
[33:46] getting a little bit of freedom now I
[33:47] can do a little bit Jim but as Jim Babb
[33:49] called me this morning he said brother
[33:51] Terry said I don't want you to be
[33:53] jumping off a platform just just go up
[33:56] there and just teach real quietly and
[33:58] you'll be okay I said I'm not making no
[34:01] promises but brotherwe actually did real
[34:07] good last night we appreciate that thank
[34:09] you
[34:14] I've had several people to ask me when
[34:17] you're gonna preach again on Israel I've
[34:19] got some more good things on this show
[34:20] but I've got to go as the Lord leads so
[34:24] what we have this morning is more
[34:26] important in Israel this is you that's
[34:29] you
[34:30] amen if you want to go home we want to
[34:33] go get ready to go home
[34:35] so actually I'm gonna preach this
[34:38] morning a little titled and we'll call
[34:41] it rapture ready but so well if you say
[34:44] I have wonderful rapture ready I mean
[34:46] he's going to preach he's going to teach
[34:48] us he's going to give us some deep
[34:50] revelation about the mystery of the
[34:52] seals of the thunders of the pools or
[34:54] some deep mysterious dark something
[34:56] other we've never heard before now I'm
[34:58] not going to tell you anything like that
[34:59] what I'm going to teach you this morning
[35:01] tell you this morning is why you don't
[35:02] have the Holy Ghost why you don't have
[35:08] the Holy Ghost
[35:09] those that who you don't have it they
[35:12] said well is anybody oh you know oh yeah
[35:14] yeah and why why is it so hard for
[35:18] people that struggle to get the Holy
[35:20] Ghost we're going to we're going to
[35:22] uncover the the issue by the grace of
[35:26] God okay because it's got it needs to be
[35:30] exposed and listen I'm I'm not a real
[35:32] smart man I've been a Christian about 44
[35:35] years I've been in a message about 35
[35:37] years I'm not a pro not an expert I'm
[35:39] not a theologian but I have been around
[35:41] the block a few times I know a little
[35:43] bit about what I'm talking about and I
[35:45] have actually been studying on this
[35:49] thought for for some time and just for
[35:53] the proper time to bring and what to say
[35:55] and trying to bring a composite of a lot
[35:57] of different things dealing with the
[35:59] Holy Ghost
[36:00] you can go if you have it listen you
[36:03] preach to message of what is the Holy
[36:05] Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for
[36:06] December 1959 whew the second one
[36:09] especially of what does the Holy Ghost
[36:10] given for if you haven't listed that one
[36:12] a long time go back and listen to it
[36:13] especially if there's any question your
[36:16] mind or anybody anybody it's very good
[36:20] young people it's very good turn with me
[36:22] to acts 19 verse 1 and 2
[36:26] and this is that this scripture here is
[36:30] course a very familiar scripture but I
[36:32] want to try to even the scripture 7
[36:35] bring out something that would provoke a
[36:37] little fault if we could x19 verse 1 and
[36:41] verse 2 now you ready to have church
[36:44] alright okay if you pull I'll try not to
[36:49] behave I won't be responsive
[36:53] acts 19 verse 1 now acts 19 was written
[36:59] of course about Luke and it was written
[37:01] about ad 58 okay so that's about 25 28
[37:05] 29 years since John the Baptist so
[37:07] listen and it came to pass that koala
[37:10] Paulus was at Corinth Paul of course you
[37:14] know during Paul's time Paul having
[37:17] passed through the upper coast came to
[37:19] Ephesus and finding certain disciples
[37:22] now they're not sinners they're
[37:24] disciples and he says certain disciples
[37:27] so that mean they were just that wasn't
[37:29] every disciple is up there but just
[37:31] certain ones and so it probably wasn't a
[37:34] great big group with just certain
[37:35] disciples as I said this was probably
[37:39] maybe 25 to 28 years after John the
[37:41] Baptist and he said to them have you
[37:44] received the Holy Ghost since you
[37:47] believed and he said unto them we've
[37:51] been in the message for 10 years and
[37:52] don't even know if we got the Holy Ghost
[37:56] [Applause]
[37:57] did I read that right oh I did I did
[38:03] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[38:09] you believed or you say well I that was
[38:12] just for those in the upper coasts of
[38:15] Ephesus back that no no no no have you
[38:18] received the Holy Ghost since you have
[38:20] believed actually this question is
[38:27] actually more needed today and I think
[38:30] it was back then
[38:31] I mean you know there were just certain
[38:33] disciples I mean look look I mean look
[38:37] at the young people that was that are
[38:39] raised in the message raising the
[38:42] message you know it's a real it's a it's
[38:45] a real struggle for young people because
[38:48] the race had a message now like my wife
[38:51] and I and many of you older people we
[38:52] actually were revelations 18:4 come out
[38:55] of her we were kicked out denomination
[38:56] we we heard the Eagle scream we was
[38:58] literally forced kicked out those raised
[39:01] in the message to them this is until
[39:03] they get a revelation this is just
[39:05] religion that's all it is I mean well we
[39:08] God sent a prophet wait you know it's a
[39:10] special but until you get a revelation
[39:12] it's just religion I don't care it
[39:15] doesn't you have to understand it's just
[39:17] religion it's no more than Methodists
[39:18] Baptists or nobody else unless you get a
[39:21] revelation because you're not going to
[39:23] go in old mom and daddy so it's it's
[39:27] really more needful today have you
[39:29] received the Holy Ghost since you have
[39:31] believed and what about people playing
[39:35] I'm playing Church I'm just gonna I'm
[39:38] not gonna pull any punches today okay
[39:40] I'm just gonna this is what the Lord
[39:42] laid on my heart and I'm gonna deliver
[39:44] it what about people leaving the message
[39:47] thought that that had to hold a ghost
[39:49] you you can't leave the message and how
[39:51] the Holy Ghost now they thought they had
[39:54] it I don't care if he's raised in this
[39:57] whatever have you received the Holy
[39:59] Ghost since you have believed let's bow
[40:02] our heads and pray Lord Jesus we're
[40:04] thankful for the reading of the word
[40:06] well thankful Lord that this scripture
[40:08] was put in here Lord they're just so
[40:10] abundance amount of thoughts and
[40:13] revelations
[40:14] it'll take eternity for you to to really
[40:17] reveal yourself to us that we might
[40:19] further know you and we'll never would
[40:21] never learn at all but Lord while we're
[40:23] here give us a little bit more
[40:24] understanding today hide me behind the
[40:27] cross Lord may you speak I've got some
[40:29] note scriptures and quotes here but I
[40:31] pray that you'll bring out the
[40:32] understanding give sense to the reading
[40:34] of the word may you know what the people
[40:36] to receive Lord and I thank you for
[40:38] healing my body so many times
[40:40] thank you so many times for healing my
[40:42] body and you've healed it many times but
[40:44] I really have thanked you so much and I
[40:46] appreciate it
[40:47] watch over us today bless our pastors
[40:50] strengthen him sister Carol give them
[40:51] grace today maybe when we leave the
[40:54] service for sake we can say it's been
[40:55] good to be in the house of God grant
[40:57] these things Lord we asking the lovely
[40:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:01] and everybody says amen you can be
[41:04] seated well the greatest experience a
[41:12] human being can have is receive a new
[41:14] birth not only says the greatest but
[41:18] it's the most important and it will
[41:20] absolutely absolutely will change a
[41:23] person's nature and it's actually a
[41:25] miracle if you could take a any kind of
[41:28] an animal you know a whole you and
[41:30] actually could change him to be a sheep
[41:34] which obviously we can't do that but if
[41:36] you could how can you take the nature of
[41:38] an end of that animal and make it a
[41:40] completely different nature but that's
[41:42] what God has done for us we were
[41:44] actually just animal beat groupies you
[41:46] know with it with a snake nature of
[41:48] follow nature and God changed that
[41:50] nature and make a totally different
[41:52] nature a christ-like nature I mean he
[41:55] changed our whole nature our focus our
[42:00] attitude our desires our speech our
[42:02] behavior outlook our disposition oh
[42:05] everything's been changed by numerous
[42:07] that's a miracle that's miraculous that
[42:09] God could do that for me and you and
[42:11] change our nature to make us wrap to
[42:16] really and to go in the rapture you must
[42:18] have the holy no option about it all the
[42:20] way those who have the Holy Ghost goes
[42:22] in a rapture and somebody said if you if
[42:25] if you not beat on the pulpit you
[42:29] probably will save your sternum bone
[42:31] there you probably won't break it if you
[42:32] just try not to beat the pulpit - I'm
[42:36] making no promises we must have the Holy
[42:41] Ghost without the holy goat listen
[42:42] without the Holy go where we are today
[42:44] so close to the rapture without the Holy
[42:46] Ghost you're headed for either the
[42:47] tribulation are you lost
[42:49] I mean what are the option you got those
[42:51] virgins
[42:52] remember the foolish virgins brother may
[42:54] have said they all thought they was
[42:56] under the blood but they weren't under
[42:57] the blood but they thought that they
[42:59] were so unless you're a sinner today and
[43:02] you know everybody in this building some
[43:04] have the Holy Ghost some don't have
[43:06] those goals it goes but unless you're
[43:07] sinner everybody thinks they have the
[43:09] Holy Ghost is this an important
[43:14] important subject and yet still I hear
[43:21] it often how do I know when I get it or
[43:23] how what will I do how will I act how
[43:25] how will I know I still hear that you
[43:27] know I'm still not sure that I have it
[43:30] so let's by God's grace try to at least
[43:33] settle that part of it this morning okay
[43:35] and worse than that worse than that
[43:38] there's some people that actually think
[43:42] that they have the Holy Ghost and don't
[43:43] have the Holy Ghost
[43:44] I say old brothers Harry don't don't
[43:47] tell me that mean that there's been at
[43:52] least a one preacher standing right here
[43:54] in this pulpit left the message we
[43:56] thought he had the Holy Ghost but
[43:57] probably been others people leave the
[43:59] message they don't have the Holy Ghost
[44:01] been around the message for years
[44:08] how many people who assumed they had to
[44:11] hold a ghost and left a message
[44:13] here's let's look at this first quote
[44:15] what the holy ghost what is the holy
[44:18] ghost upon this upon this place we wish
[44:21] you approach the subject now think is
[44:23] the outstanding subject of today what is
[44:25] the Holy Ghost what is it
[44:27] and now the reason I have taken these
[44:29] subject like this and you cannot and you
[44:32] cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit
[44:34] unless you know what it is and you
[44:36] cannot receive it if you know what it is
[44:38] unless you believe it's given to you and
[44:40] it's for you and then you cannot know
[44:43] whether you've got it or not unless you
[44:45] know what results it brings so if you
[44:48] know what it is and who it's to and what
[44:50] action it brings when it comes then you
[44:53] know what you've got it got when you get
[44:57] it and that would settle it okay in the
[45:01] token message now we read that acts 19
[45:03] one and two have you received the Holy
[45:05] Ghost since you believe now in the token
[45:08] 147 now the Spirit is a token you should
[45:12] be filled with the Holy Ghost not many
[45:14] days hence when the blood was shed the
[45:16] token was sent down on the day of
[45:18] Pentecost like a rushing mighty wind now
[45:21] listen to this next part that was the
[45:24] theme of every apostle that was have you
[45:29] received the Holy Ghost since you have
[45:31] believed many I'm was baptized by John
[45:36] or under John's ministry 25 or 28 years
[45:39] before that but the question was many of
[45:42] the disciples have you received the Holy
[45:44] Ghost since you have believed on the
[45:46] Lord Jesus amen now brother man preach
[45:50] what is the Holy Ghost 1959 and what is
[45:53] it given for but I'm gonna I'm gonna
[45:56] give you just about a two minute
[45:58] synopsis on what it is but then we want
[46:00] to go more into what I did how do you
[46:03] know what defects does that have and so
[46:06] forth and so on
[46:06] okay now and Luke 24:49
[46:11] Jesus told them go to you up the city of
[46:14] Jerusalem and and tarry until they
[46:16] receive power he didn't explain it he
[46:18] didn't hit tell him how long he would be
[46:20] there he said you just go
[46:21] there and wait and tail now that's very
[46:25] important wait and tail well you say
[46:27] after I come to the altar or wherever I
[46:29] give my heart to Lord how long will it
[46:31] be I don't know but you just wait until
[46:34] it's just got to be on tail there's no
[46:38] set amount of time it's just a tail but
[46:41] there's some reasons why it has to go
[46:43] until a further until and he says what
[46:49] is the Holy Ghost we found that what the
[46:50] Holy Ghost is it's a sign the chillness
[46:52] will we're given a seal of circumcision
[46:54] a sign it's a seal piece of 430 grieve
[46:57] not the Holy Ghost whereby you're sealed
[46:59] it's the Spirit of Christ in you that
[47:01] I'll be with you even in you it's a
[47:04] comforter I pray that followed he'll
[47:06] give you another comforter
[47:07] it's an advocate any man sin we have an
[47:09] advocate with the father
[47:11] it's our rest coming to me all your
[47:13] heavy and are heavy laden and I will
[47:14] give you a rest and then it's power you
[47:17] shall receive power after that the Holy
[47:19] Ghost will come upon you and now I just
[47:21] preaching the sermon or what is the Holy
[47:23] Ghost all those things that's what it
[47:27] that's what it is but you know it's also
[47:30] it's kind of like you know what it is
[47:32] these five or six things and it's more
[47:34] than that also but also one place
[47:37] brother Branham he talks about Holy
[47:39] Ghost it's kind of like electricity he
[47:41] said nobody knows yet what electricity
[47:43] is we can harness it we can see the fix
[47:45] a light bulb we can see the effects of a
[47:48] motor we can see the effects of your
[47:49] stove in your house whatever you
[47:51] conceive the effects of electricity but
[47:54] you tell me what it is what you say well
[47:55] it's current below what is current well
[47:57] it runs through the wire well I can't
[47:59] see what is electricity well I'll tell
[48:02] you one thing you might not can tell me
[48:04] what it is but when you get a hole in
[48:06] wires you know you got it
[48:10] [Applause]
[48:17] so it's good that you know what the Holy
[48:21] Ghost is but you better know if you got
[48:23] it that's the main thing so don't forget
[48:28] about that maybe maybe it's like
[48:30] electricity but maybe I can teach that
[48:32] to what it is but when you when it bites
[48:34] you you know it
[48:37] when it bites you you know it I mean
[48:40] they're being bit by electricity most of
[48:42] you mmm yeah yeah if you do it too
[48:45] didn't you
[48:49] amen you know we know what it is but now
[48:53] I want to ask here's the big question
[48:55] for those who don't have it for those
[48:59] who not sure that they have it and maybe
[49:02] for those that think they got it and
[49:04] really don't have it maybe you ought to
[49:05] think about that and then for those who
[49:07] do have it maybe it would be a
[49:08] confirmation my big question is if you
[49:11] don't have the Holy Ghost you want the
[49:13] Holy Ghost how bad do you want it how
[49:14] badly do you want the Holy Ghost
[49:17] well they say all brother Terry more
[49:19] than anything in the world really really
[49:22] how bad did the rich young ruler won't
[49:24] eternal life how bad did he want eternal
[49:30] life well to a point to a point but
[49:35] really that's your answer there there is
[49:37] rub Donna just preached here recently
[49:39] price and value you may think you mourn
[49:45] it more than anything but really how
[49:47] much do you really really want it
[49:52] leadership and he refused to be called
[49:54] the son of speaking of Moses refused to
[49:56] be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[49:57] because he esteemed their approach to
[49:59] Christ greater treasure than all the
[50:01] riches of the world he esteemed that
[50:03] watch what he done he followed up
[50:05] quickly he was cuss out stood out by his
[50:08] people the people that once loved him it
[50:11] might cost you everything you got
[50:16] it might cost you your home it might
[50:19] cost you your friendship it might cost
[50:22] you your stitching so party it might
[50:24] cost you your place in the kiwanis it
[50:27] might I don't know what it'll cost you
[50:28] but it'll cost you everything that's
[50:31] worldly or pertains to the world I can
[50:36] tell you that I don't know what it'll
[50:37] cost you but it's going to cost
[50:39] everybody something you say well it's a
[50:41] free gift it's true it it's a free gift
[50:44] you cannot purchase with a price of
[50:48] works that gift it is a free gift you
[50:52] can't buy it but you have to surrender
[50:54] to get it it'll cost you everything
[51:00] that's worldly or pertains to the world
[51:02] you'll have to separate yourself from
[51:04] everything that's worldly you have to do
[51:07] it now that's really that's one of the
[51:10] key things right there while many people
[51:12] don't receive the Holy Ghost you're not
[51:14] you have it really and then we're going
[51:15] to get into that a little bit more but
[51:17] as we just lay a foundation thing about
[51:19] this yeah I'm willing to get everything
[51:21] up really really if you don't have it
[51:28] and you're thirsting for it and it's for
[51:30] you it shows you there's something wrong
[51:33] somewhere it's not God Moses laid aside
[51:41] everything Moses laid everything aside
[51:44] and went to the desert with a stick in
[51:46] his hand
[51:46] amen days after days passed and wonder
[51:50] if he thought he made a mistake not many
[51:52] times people start out and say oh I'll
[51:54] do it
[51:55] glory to God I see it let somebody
[51:57] laughing you make fun of it well maybe
[51:59] probably I was wrong how badly do you
[52:03] want it well it's kind of like the
[52:06] little story of the chicken in the hall
[52:08] no no if you've ever heard a little
[52:09] story but the chicken in the hall was
[52:12] kind of going along one day and they saw
[52:13] that sign a sign out there and it said
[52:16] ham and egg breakfast and so you know
[52:20] ham and egg breakfast you don't ham an
[52:22] egg the chicken and the hog to help the
[52:25] war effort and the Hogs head to the
[52:28] chicken you know for you
[52:29] it's only a sacrifice but for me it's a
[52:32] total commitment you're gonna have ham
[52:41] that's a total commitment the chicken
[52:44] laying egg that's just how bad do you
[52:48] want it
[52:48] that's the quiz how bad do you want it
[52:53] your salvation is a free gift that's
[52:56] true but it costs you everything that's
[52:58] worldly to get it
[53:00] I'd like to think about this for a
[53:03] minute
[53:04] the and I'm just going to read this
[53:07] white quickly think about this the the
[53:09] guard of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
[53:11] what he's his life and his discipline
[53:14] what he's willing to give up just for
[53:17] that position all they get is a wreath
[53:18] and they're part of an elite group being
[53:20] the guard of the Tomb of the Unknown
[53:21] Soldier but this is what he has to his
[53:24] discipline his sacrifice he must be
[53:26] between 510 and 62 tall and weigh sighs
[53:29] cannot exceed thirty inches of the
[53:31] requirements of the guard he must commit
[53:33] two years of life to guard tomb living
[53:35] the barracks underneath the tomb cannot
[53:37] drink any alcohol or owner off duty for
[53:40] the rest of the lives they cannot swear
[53:41] in public for the rest of their lives
[53:43] cannot disgrace the uniform or the tomb
[53:45] in any way after two years the guard has
[53:47] given a wreath pen that is worn on the
[53:49] lapel signifying they served as the
[53:51] guard of the tomb there are only four
[53:53] hundred presently worn the guard must
[53:55] obey these rules for the rest of the
[53:57] lives will give up the wreath pen the
[53:59] shoes are specially made for very thick
[54:01] with very thick thick soles to keep the
[54:03] heat and cold from their feet remember
[54:05] this is 360 24/7 they guard the tomb
[54:08] there are no wrinkles folks lint on the
[54:11] uniformed guards dressed for duty in
[54:13] front of a full-length mirror first six
[54:15] months of duty guard cannot talk to
[54:17] anyone to watch TV all off-duty Thomas
[54:20] Pitt studying 175 notable people laid to
[54:23] rest at Arlington National Cemetery the
[54:25] guard must memorize who they are and
[54:27] where they're interred every guard must
[54:29] spend five hours a day getting his
[54:30] uniform ready for guard duty he's
[54:33] willing to do that just to be a 2-year
[54:36] assignment to be a guard at the Tomb of
[54:37] the Unknown Soldier what are you willing
[54:40] to give up and what would be discipline
[54:41] of your life just to receive eternal
[54:43] life
[54:43] how much is it worth to you is that
[54:46] where separation is a worth giving up
[54:47] everything is it worth that kind of a
[54:49] separation from the world is it worth
[54:51] that kind of a life to be able to to be
[54:52] different to be not like the world to be
[54:56] an oddball to the world is it worth like
[54:58] that you remember this is we're a royal
[55:00] priesthood we're a different people to
[55:01] procure you people did it we're talking
[55:03] about Bryden we're talking about bride
[55:05] members we're talking about a bride
[55:08] condition word bride and still we wonder
[55:12] why so many people struggle with even
[55:14] the Holy Ghost and why many even for
[55:17] weeks or months or years Wow my Wow Wow
[55:22] listen I don't want to hurt you but I
[55:24] want to tell you the truth brother I'm
[55:26] sitting in trial Tucson he said
[55:28] sometimes he lingers as he did in the
[55:32] night to Noah as he did in the days of
[55:34] Moses he did in all days but he never
[55:37] told the Pentecostal people go you up in
[55:38] the city of Jerusalem Jerusalem in 24
[55:41] hours I give you the Holy Ghost he never
[55:43] said that they didn't have any idea they
[55:45] didn't even know what it was going to
[55:46] get they just said I'm on you until you
[55:49] be endued with power that's all they
[55:50] told him and he said tarry there until
[55:54] you've been in dude with power from on
[55:55] high
[55:55] he never said one day to day ten days he
[55:58] said stay until your endued with power
[56:00] Lord they stayed there until the
[56:02] evidence spoke back through them that
[56:05] was the Holy Ghost of God they stayed
[56:07] there until so that's the key on tale
[56:13] but that's not all the key I want you to
[56:17] understand something about acts 2:38
[56:19] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[56:21] Christ for the Mists of sins and you
[56:23] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[56:25] I don't know if you've ever seen this
[56:27] quote before but I want you to think
[56:28] about this patmans vision I was in the
[56:31] spirit it isn't it just beautiful my
[56:33] love that could you just you could just
[56:36] call those words a hold of the Christian
[56:39] life if we're going to live as
[56:40] Christians we have to be in his his
[56:43] Spirit John was not talking about being
[56:47] in his own spirit that would not have
[56:49] brought these fishes it had to be in the
[56:51] Spirit of God it has to be the Spirit of
[56:53] God with us too
[56:54] all of our efforts are in vain Paul said
[56:56] our
[56:57] pray in the spirit i'll seen the sphere
[56:58] i'll live in the sphere if there's
[57:00] anything good that will come to me it
[57:02] has to be revealed by the spirit
[57:04] confirmed by the words made manifest by
[57:06] the results it bears as surely as john
[57:09] needed to be in the spirit holy spirit
[57:11] to receive these tremendous revelations
[57:13] from jesus fresh from jesus we need to
[57:16] be in the spirit to understand the
[57:17] revelations that god has given to us to
[57:20] live by in his word for the same spirit
[57:22] remember even faith is a revelation you
[57:25] got to have faith to be saved and even
[57:28] that's the revelation paragraph 44 look
[57:32] at it this way Oh too many read the
[57:35] Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent
[57:37] and be baptized every one of you in the
[57:39] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[57:41] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[57:43] of the Holy Ghost and just pass right on
[57:47] think about I want you to think about
[57:49] this quote they don't see it if they saw
[57:54] it by getting in the spirit they would
[57:57] know that if they want to receive the
[57:58] Holy Spirit
[57:59] they need to repent and be baptized in
[58:02] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then
[58:04] God will be duty-bound to fill his word
[58:06] fulfilled his word by filling them with
[58:09] the Holy Ghost they never get in his
[58:11] spirit the Holy Spirit or it would
[58:13] happen to them exactly as the word says
[58:16] they never get into his spirit pray to
[58:20] God for revelation by his Spirit that's
[58:23] the first step
[58:27] why is it and I baptizing many young
[58:30] people and that's all good and I will
[58:32] continue to do that but why is it I'm
[58:35] just playing okay I'm just playing why
[58:37] is it a lot of young people to baptize
[58:39] young why is it - 15 20 years later go
[58:42] back out in the world whatever to come
[58:44] back and then they want to get
[58:45] rebaptised and then later on then to get
[58:47] the Holy Ghost why I mean there's a
[58:51] reason why when we read the scripture
[58:59] repent be baptized the name of Jesus
[59:01] Christ from it and you see it's like we
[59:03] we want to thank well you're going to
[59:05] get it and within 5 minutes it doesn't
[59:07] say that
[59:08] it doesn't say that don't read that into
[59:11] it you could you could but most time
[59:15] they don't come that way and especially
[59:16] in Laodicea and there's reasons why and
[59:19] Laodicea there's so much pull of the
[59:22] world how badly do you want it it's for
[59:26] you and if your seed you're going to get
[59:29] in some time but why wait till you're 90
[59:31] years old he told him to tarry Jerusalem
[59:37] but just wait Intel and first you know
[59:40] now he told that whole group and you
[59:43] know he didn't tell him how long he
[59:45] didn't tell him how long the way but he
[59:47] told that whole group was at 500 whoever
[59:49] it was to go up the city of Jerusalem
[59:51] but only 120 obeyed what happened to the
[59:54] others only 120 obeyed not everybody
[59:58] obeys which brings us to another subject
[1:00:03] about this did the rich young ruler obey
[1:00:07] no no said go sell if you had don't
[1:00:12] label Warren it quite that bad did the
[1:00:15] Pharisees obey no did Judas obey no do
[1:00:22] the foolish over to foolish virgins obey
[1:00:24] they thought they were but no acts 5:29
[1:00:29] then Peter and the other apostles answer
[1:00:32] said we ought to obey God rather than
[1:00:34] man the God of my father's raised up
[1:00:38] Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree
[1:00:41] him hath God exalted with his right hand
[1:00:44] to be Prince and to be Savior for to
[1:00:47] give repentance to Israel and
[1:00:48] forgiveness of sins verse 32 and we are
[1:00:51] his witnesses of these sayings and so is
[1:00:55] also the Holy Ghost whom God has given
[1:00:58] to them that obey so there's something
[1:01:05] you got to do has nothing to do with the
[1:01:09] purchase price of salvation that's a
[1:01:11] free gift but remember the Lambs wife
[1:01:14] hath made herself ready
[1:01:17] you've got to do something you got to do
[1:01:21] something rest your life you've got it
[1:01:22] you have you've got to stay surrender to
[1:01:24] the ones you see you got the soul is
[1:01:27] burst into the New Kingdom you got ten
[1:01:29] outlets that's against you they're not
[1:01:31] born again see taste feel smell hear
[1:01:33] constant reason it matters a memory
[1:01:35] affection they're all against you
[1:01:36] they're not born again they're not
[1:01:39] redeemed they are against you so your
[1:01:42] souls got to tell the spirit what to do
[1:01:44] the spirits got to tell the flesh what
[1:01:45] to do and they all are rebelling against
[1:01:47] the soul because they're not redeemed
[1:01:50] so you it's one against ten which one's
[1:01:53] gonna win he gives the Holy Ghost it was
[1:01:58] given to them that obey know what about
[1:02:01] that wonder why you haven't received the
[1:02:04] Holy Ghost it's certainly not God's
[1:02:06] fault so it has to be your fault
[1:02:08] somewhere because if you have that
[1:02:10] thirst in your seat you're going to get
[1:02:12] some time the token jeffersonville all
[1:02:16] little people my brother's sister get
[1:02:18] under that token quickly see don't take
[1:02:20] no substitute don't don't don't don't
[1:02:23] don't do that see don't just imagine you
[1:02:26] stay there and tell you know that the
[1:02:29] token is applied until you're a whole
[1:02:32] the mind that was in crisis in you until
[1:02:36] all the nonsense of the world is gone
[1:02:38] see until the whole hearts desire is him
[1:02:43] see there then then you know then you
[1:02:46] know something is happening there's got
[1:02:48] to be a death
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:54] [Applause]
[1:02:56] you say well you know too many people
[1:02:59] that fall short they never truly fully
[1:03:02] sincerely repent that's the most
[1:03:07] critical thing I want to touch on that
[1:03:09] again remember I brought it out here
[1:03:11] several months ago but I want to touch
[1:03:14] on just a little short part of it John
[1:03:16] come preach and repent us for the
[1:03:18] kingdom of heaven his hand Jesus
[1:03:20] preached repentance for the kingdom of
[1:03:21] heaven his hand Peter preached for
[1:03:23] repentance repentance it's a it's a
[1:03:25] prepares is a process of death repent
[1:03:28] means to turn around about-face you're
[1:03:31] going this way now you going this way
[1:03:32] you're going this way now you turn

[1:06:47] everywhere John 12:24 verily verily I
[1:06:51] say unto you except a corn of wheat fall
[1:06:52] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[1:06:56] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:06:59] fruit all nature we're the same way long
[1:07:03] as that seed stays in a in a seed
[1:07:06] package somewhere you can have a little
[1:07:07] seed package of daffodils or whatever
[1:07:11] you know marigolds they might stay in
[1:07:13] that package

[1:07:21] got to be put in the right kind of
[1:07:22] better ground and they got a dying right
[1:07:24] then it can bring forth life amen
[1:07:27] that's right entail this place in the
[1:07:29] good ground it cannot and die and rot it
[1:07:32] can never bring forth life and you must
[1:07:34] be born again
[1:07:35] Jeff paragraph 73 you see what I mean
[1:07:39] now you are dead
[1:07:40] our souls are placed upon the divine
[1:07:43] judgment that's brass when our souls is
[1:07:45] placed upon an altar divine judgment
[1:07:47] what was the penalty death
[1:07:49] now even what I'm covering right now
[1:07:51] this is so important well I I have died
[1:07:55] really why is you had wise some of you -
[1:08:00] some of you live a questionable life you
[1:08:05] shouldn't say things like that it's it's
[1:08:07] it is what it is you're you are dead our
[1:08:13] souls are placed upon His divine
[1:08:15] judgment that's brass when our souls are
[1:08:17] placed upon the altar demands of what
[1:08:19] was the penalty death and when you lay
[1:08:20] yourself upon the altar of God which is
[1:08:22] pronounced death upon the sinner how can
[1:08:25] you raise from there alive in sin if God
[1:08:29] hasn't accepted the sacrifice is that
[1:08:31] clear now you die you actually are
[1:08:33] consumed and you're petrified there's no
[1:08:36] more left to you but just this form that
[1:08:39] you're standing in like the brass
[1:08:40] serpent like Christ was when he took his
[1:08:43] took him dead and cold off the clothes
[1:08:46] you're dead cause why your own God's
[1:08:48] altar of judgment what was his judgment
[1:08:51] when the judge surpasses the sentence
[1:08:53] what the sentence of this penalty was
[1:08:55] death you say well you're really
[1:08:57] laboring on death it's got to be that
[1:08:59] way you've got to die to receive life
[1:09:02] you've got to die you've got to run
[1:09:05] you've got to be willing to give up
[1:09:07] everything it's unlike Christ I don't
[1:09:10] care if you're 40 years old I don't give
[1:09:12] you 50 years old I don't care if you've
[1:09:14] been in the message 30 years
[1:09:20] as I say it there's many of middle aged
[1:09:24] and older people this fell away from the
[1:09:26] message they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:09:30] so don't tell me just because you're old
[1:09:33] everybody's got and everybody ain't got
[1:09:35] it
[1:09:36] they shouldn't you shouldn't preach

[1:09:40] to make it we are so close brother
[1:09:43] sister listen there's no need to be
[1:09:45] playing Church you must be born again
[1:09:50] paragraph 76 now your soul is laid upon
[1:09:52] the altar of God's breast judgment then
[1:09:54] God receives it now it shows that you
[1:09:56] haven't received it it if you're still
[1:09:58] alive in the world God never took it now
[1:10:01] you people talking about getting the
[1:10:02] Holy Ghost and how you have to wait so
[1:10:04] long here you are until God receives
[1:10:08] that sacrifice you have to wait so long
[1:10:10] here it is until God receives that
[1:10:13] sacrifice until it's late on his
[1:10:15] judgments there until his judgment has
[1:10:18] actually killed her senses killed your
[1:10:22] senses did you hear what I said
[1:10:25] killed your senses your five senses your
[1:10:29] 10 senses you might say well I'm going
[1:10:32] to turn a new page that ain't it well I
[1:10:35] know I used to smoke I'm going to quit
[1:10:37] that still isn't in and tell God
[1:10:39] Racine's that sacrifice on his brass
[1:10:41] altar the altar of judgment what is this
[1:10:43] judgment death that's the penalty the
[1:10:46] soul that sinneth that remaineth in that
[1:10:47] shield I don't care what you've done
[1:10:51] like Abraham until he had fully
[1:10:54] separated from light and unbelief and
[1:10:56] all doubt then God gave him the seal of
[1:11:00] circumcision that he had received his
[1:11:02] faith he had to separate he had to
[1:11:06] separate God receive Abraham's faith
[1:11:08] then he give him to the seal of
[1:11:10] circumcision brother man said in future
[1:11:12] home who said you don't accept God God
[1:11:14] accepts you because it's his attributes
[1:11:16] God's got to accept you what the parties
[1:11:18] got to accept is your faith because you
[1:11:22] have to have faith your faith has got to
[1:11:23] be a revelation that I am willing to die
[1:11:25] and surrender and dream transformed
[1:11:31] that's why maybe Jesus said to his
[1:11:33] disciples do you now believe after all
[1:11:36] this time do you now believe the seeds
[1:11:41] helpers instigated the enemy paragraph
[1:11:42] 31 now when we received Christ our
[1:11:44] Savior then if we're sincere in that
[1:11:48] then oh oh yeah it's up there then if
[1:11:56] we're sincere in that then if he put it
[1:12:01] if they're in sincerity Then There is
[1:12:03] obviously a possibility the person
[1:12:05] cannot be sincere there is a possibility
[1:12:09] then if we're sincere that then God
[1:12:12] gives us a sign that heareth has
[1:12:13] received our faith in Christ by giving
[1:12:16] us the seal of circumcision which is a
[1:12:19] Holy Ghost it was a natural back their
[1:12:21] spiritual today that's the seal of
[1:12:23] circumcision grieve not the host fear of
[1:12:25] God whereby you're sealed till the day
[1:12:27] of your redemption not to the next
[1:12:29] meeting but to the day of your
[1:12:30] Redemption that's right feasting for 30
[1:12:32] now that's how we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:12:34] 32 and now you say oh I'm a believer and
[1:12:37] gods never give you the Holy Ghost yet
[1:12:39] he's never recognized it I told you it's
[1:12:42] not God's fault it's your fault he's
[1:12:45] never recognized your faith yet maybe
[1:12:47] your faith is not to that point maybe
[1:12:49] your revelation not to that point you
[1:12:51] say well I just can't live it no you
[1:12:52] can't but when you make up you well you
[1:12:55] got to really choose your words
[1:12:56] correctly because we're talking about
[1:12:58] election here God broods and God puts
[1:13:00] that desire in there and you you know if
[1:13:03] you if you're God's seed he's going to
[1:13:04] put that thirst is going to be there but
[1:13:06] you still have to do your part what and
[1:13:09] what how well at what point are you
[1:13:12] willing to say okay I'm ready
[1:13:13] God knows that what you point you ready
[1:13:16] well maybe you get baptized you know and
[1:13:18] you say I'm ready to die I want the Holy
[1:13:20] goes well what maybe even maybe maybe
[1:13:23] maybe you go back in for a couple of
[1:13:26] years you still kind of worldly well you
[1:13:28] see did that cult God catch God by
[1:13:30] surprise God already knew so it's gonna
[1:13:33] be two years he's going back into the
[1:13:34] world he knew you wasn't ready
[1:13:37] but see when God recognizes your faith
[1:13:40] and he knows you're ready then that's
[1:13:41] what it comes because he knows down the
[1:13:43] road he knows that you're going to be
[1:13:45] two years of five years or six months or
[1:13:47] twenty years he knows that but he's not
[1:13:50] going to he's not going to see all that
[1:13:52] and tell him until the point which he
[1:13:55] knows what point you're going to be
[1:13:56] ready he says which is okay we just skip
[1:14:05] on down to paragraph 32 and now oh you
[1:14:07] say you never give you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:11] yet he's just he's never recognized
[1:14:13] you're just confessing that you believe
[1:14:15] but when all the daily I'm not saying
[1:14:17] you're not a believer now in a certain
[1:14:19] portion you are believer but when God
[1:14:21] has found favor you have Fedor found
[1:14:23] favor with him rather and he recognizes
[1:14:25] you to be his child and he knows your
[1:14:28] heart and sees your sincerity sees your
[1:14:33] sincerity
[1:14:34] he knows all things are cut away from
[1:14:36] you then then he seals you into the
[1:14:43] kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost proving
[1:14:46] to the world that he accepted what faith
[1:14:48] you profess to have it have in him get
[1:14:52] it now so there's got to be the part
[1:14:55] that you've got to play you've got you
[1:14:56] have to have that sincerity he knows
[1:14:58] well not you're ready really ready to
[1:15:00] die he knows well maybe it's going to
[1:15:02] take two years three years five years
[1:15:05] hope it don't but he knows at what point
[1:15:09] is okay he's ready why didn't God give
[1:15:13] Abraham the seal of circumcision the
[1:15:15] first year that he called him he had to
[1:15:17] because he wasn't ready yet he goes down
[1:15:21] he goes down to career I'm not to career
[1:15:23] goes down to Egypt the first time fate
[1:15:26] Road lies about his wife and so forth
[1:15:28] it's on like that and we'll give it I'm
[1:15:32] gonna give you a little grace in just a
[1:15:33] minute
[1:15:35] I won't give you a little grace in just
[1:15:38] a minute brother we're talking about
[1:15:40] bride material I don't want to miss it I
[1:15:46] don't even want to be foolish virgin
[1:15:48] I believe I'm called to be bride now God
[1:15:51] never sent me no special delivery letter
[1:15:53] you know certified letter but I believe
[1:15:56] by my faith and by my testimony your
[1:15:59] brother Bev said by the word of your
[1:16:01] testimony he said your testimony is your
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost by your testimony it's a sign
[1:16:05] to the world that you've really got
[1:16:06] something I believe that I have the Holy
[1:16:09] Ghost a word birth on my soul I believe
[1:16:11] I've been transformed sealed into the
[1:16:13] Keen I don't want to miss it that's what
[1:16:15] it means to me we're talking about the
[1:16:19] Lambs wife his sweetheart not flirt his
[1:16:21] wife we're talking about a word bride
[1:16:25] we're talking about those who separated
[1:16:26] from the world and unbelief we're
[1:16:28] talking about those that are chosen and
[1:16:30] if you are chosen and you have a thirst
[1:16:32] for God and that thirst is in there
[1:16:35] which you know what a thirst is it's a
[1:16:37] painful desire for God a painful desire
[1:16:40] a thirst is a painful desire a real
[1:16:44] thirst if you've got a painful desire
[1:16:46] you're going to wait until until until
[1:16:48] whatever it don't matter how long until
[1:16:51] like the story it did whichever preacher
[1:16:54] that was he said I'm going to stay in
[1:16:55] this cornfield you'll find my bones in
[1:16:57] this cornfield
[1:16:58] if you don't were filled me with the
[1:16:59] Holy I'm staying here a tail it's got to
[1:17:02] be on tail there's no other way has got
[1:17:04] to be a tail
[1:17:06] if you really desire you'll give up
[1:17:10] everything this carnal that's not godly
[1:17:13] paragraph 27 once the Holy Ghost now
[1:17:16] there's a vast difference between just
[1:17:18] the Christians and the Holy Ghost field
[1:17:20] Christian now you're going to get this
[1:17:21] from the scripture and place it exactly
[1:17:23] in the scripture the first lay there is
[1:17:25] a Christian I profess to be Christian
[1:17:27] but if this this mission has not yet
[1:17:30] been filled with the Holy Ghost he's
[1:17:31] only in the process of being a Christian
[1:17:33] see he is professed to believe it and
[1:17:36] he's working to it but God has not yet
[1:17:38] given him his spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:40] he's not yet reached that goal with God
[1:17:43] that God hasn't recognized yet this is
[1:17:47] not new material this is just the
[1:17:49] message have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:17:52] since you have believed we've been in
[1:17:57] message 50 years have you received the
[1:17:59] Holy Ghost since you have believed if
[1:18:03] not there's many people's been in the
[1:18:05] message for years that don't have the
[1:18:07] Holy Ghost we used to believe it if you
[1:18:11] could see the revelation of the seals
[1:18:13] and thunders and pools and this and that
[1:18:14] we used to believe that 30 years ago you
[1:18:17] got it you got the Holy Ghost and we
[1:18:20] found out that wasn't true brother it's
[1:18:24] the same thing brother man said well you
[1:18:25] said the the the Methodist we shouted
[1:18:28] they got up he said many didn't didn't
[1:18:30] have it well the Holy Ghost we spoke in
[1:18:31] tongues they said well we got it and
[1:18:33] many of you spoke in tongues it didn't
[1:18:34] have it you say I'm in the message the
[1:18:37] dependent me a lot of people say that in
[1:18:38] the message don't have it same thing
[1:18:40] bring it up to date remember the Holy
[1:18:44] Ghost is a sign it's a seal that's a
[1:18:46] comforter it's an advocate it is rest
[1:18:49] but remember when you talk about the
[1:18:52] seal let's talk about that just for a
[1:18:54] moment
[1:18:54] remember what brother been said about
[1:18:55] the boxcar oh the boxcar

[1:19:30] much where's Toulouse about things when
[1:19:34] the inspector Oh who's inspector Holy
[1:19:39] Ghost

[1:19:48] little loose in your prayer life a
[1:19:49] little loose about that temper a little

[1:20:37] trying to show you why some people
[1:20:40] haven't received the Holy Ghost yet say
[1:20:42] I don't want to hear that what he gonna
[1:20:43] hear it anyway but when he's found
[1:20:49] everything in his place inspector then

[1:20:54] make you flawless absolutely not

[1:23:14] glad about that Abraham first time he
[1:23:18] went down into Egypt lied about his wife
[1:23:21] said this is my sister and then you know
[1:23:22] in favor oh I'll take it from my wife
[1:23:24] you okay well then after after after
[1:23:28] Abraham gets a body change made by young
[1:23:32] again which is that his body changes the
[1:23:34] type of us receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:23:36] after he gets a body change Danny goes
[1:23:39] down to Greer and the King down there by
[1:23:41] the name of amulets and the same thing
[1:23:43] happens and you know he falls in love
[1:23:45] with this grandma that's now 18 and he
[1:23:47] said that's that's the one I've been
[1:23:48] looking for all of my life and says I'm
[1:23:50] gonna take her he said sure it's all
[1:23:51] right it's my sister go ahead take her
[1:23:52] because you know he was he was a little
[1:23:54] bit coward because he know it's gonna
[1:23:56] kill his hide if you know if he said
[1:23:57] anything otherwise say yeah go ahead
[1:23:58] they see see he and Sarah had coveted
[1:24:00] years and years ago if we ever get in
[1:24:02] trouble I'll say you're my sister
[1:24:03] because it was his half-sister they had
[1:24:05] made that covenant many many years ago
[1:24:07] when L started out but Abraham he's
[1:24:09] already been changed by yunk again
[1:24:11] signified as a type rather of receiving
[1:24:14] the hold and he still lied he lied about
[1:24:16] his life after he had received the Holy
[1:24:20] Ghost can you imagine a man lying
[1:24:22] purposely after
[1:24:24] even the Holy Ghost I can't imagine that
[1:24:27] well I did think about one instabuilder
[1:24:30] Brownlie at one time he said now a
[1:24:32] telephone rang and it was a tax case he
[1:24:34] said now he went out the door said to me
[1:24:36] today you tell him not here I'm not here
[1:24:37] he went outside he had the Holy Ghost
[1:24:41] brother Ram actually said I lied and he
[1:24:45] said you know I'm not trying to put
[1:24:47] words I mean he said I lied I told some
[1:24:49] wasn't true and he had the Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] now I'm not advocating lying but I'm
[1:24:57] going to tell you you probably going to
[1:24:59] lie if you've been born again you're
[1:25:05] probably going to lie
[1:25:06] you probably lied this year oh my but
[1:25:18] aren't you glad God to judge as a man
[1:25:20] according to the desire of his heart
[1:25:25] I'm so glad about that according to what
[1:25:28] this true hearts is true hearts desire
[1:25:31] in the was the Holy Ghost given four
[1:25:34] paragraph 56 and Jesus said they'd be so
[1:25:36] close together in the last days that
[1:25:38] would deceive the very elect impossible
[1:25:40] remember it's just the elected that will
[1:25:42] see it God calls election calls by
[1:25:44] election aren't you happy that you're
[1:25:46] one of them aren't you people here
[1:25:49] tonight knowing that something in your
[1:25:51] heart is tugging tugging something in
[1:25:55] you young people's hearts tugging
[1:25:57] tugging I want the Holy Spirit I want
[1:26:02] you Lord in my heart that's because God
[1:26:05] put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:26:07] before the foundation of the world he
[1:26:09] said that no man can come to me except
[1:26:11] said Jesus except my father has drawled
[1:26:14] him first and all that comes to me I'll
[1:26:16] give him/her to eternal life what is he
[1:26:18] turn what is eternal life the Holy Ghost

[1:29:44] rapture takes place somebody's going to
[1:29:45] be in school when the rapture takes
[1:29:47] place you be one that's got the Holy
[1:29:49] Ghost
[1:29:56] hey man and he brother BAM says and try
[1:30:01] but I want to get down a few more things
[1:30:03] he said ever birth is a mess
[1:30:05] I don't care if it's a top peak
[1:30:07] decorated hospital room ever births a
[1:30:09] mess remember the theme of ever apostle
[1:30:14] was have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:30:16] since you have believed it's very simple
[1:30:19] receiving a Holy Ghost which is
[1:30:20] receiving Christ as self same spirit
[1:30:22] that's the whole purpose of the New
[1:30:24] Testament which you'll notice this quote
[1:30:26] paragraph 19 what was the Holy Ghost
[1:30:27] given for paragraph 19 this is
[1:30:29] tremendous this whole purpose all that
[1:30:34] God was they poured into Christ all the
[1:30:36] Christ was he poured into the church why
[1:30:41] why now the purpose what was what was
[1:30:46] God's purpose in sending the holy spirit
[1:30:48] marked that down John 14 beginning the
[1:30:51] fourteenth verse in reading through the
[1:30:52] chapter of the bathe God's purpose we
[1:30:55] find here and send in the Holy Spirit
[1:30:57] was one purpose that God himself might
[1:31:02] dwell in his church and continue his
[1:31:05] plans through the church that God was in
[1:31:08] Christ continuing his plans through
[1:31:11] Christ out of Christ into the church
[1:31:14] continues work through the church it's
[1:31:18] very simple all that God was you know
[1:31:22] above us in the children of Israel
[1:31:24] illness in the pillow fire with us in
[1:31:27] Jesus now he wants to be in us above us
[1:31:30] with this in us well for him to continue
[1:31:34] his work because he said I've got to go
[1:31:36] away I'll send you another comforter
[1:31:37] he's got to leave he can't stay here
[1:31:39] with us he's got to go away what is it
[1:31:42] what is another comforter it's the Holy
[1:31:43] Spirit's the same spirit of Christ but
[1:31:46] it's not Jesus in flesh anymore
[1:31:48] it's that same spirit that he had coming
[1:31:50] back into the church so he so you you
[1:31:54] you could continue the work of the
[1:31:56] church as brother Donna's been preaching
[1:31:58] on the church yours continuation he is
[1:32:02] the beginning of the creation of God you
[1:32:03] are the continuation of the creation of
[1:32:06] God
[1:32:06] you have to have the Holy Ghost of being
[1:32:08] a but be to be qualified to continue the
[1:32:12] work of God in His Church you have to
[1:32:18] have the Holy Ghost he's not gonna he's
[1:32:21] not going to continue he's not he's not
[1:32:23] even gonna feel unclean vessel you have
[1:32:26] because you can't do it on your own
[1:32:28] you can't do it without the Holy Ghost
[1:32:30] there's one purpose God himself might
[1:32:33] dwell in the church and continue its
[1:32:35] plans through the church and you can
[1:32:37] only do it you think about the Lord
[1:32:38] about Apostle Peter when he went up into
[1:32:41] the Upper Room
[1:32:42] he was scared to death of the Jews they
[1:32:44] was persecuting his killing killing
[1:32:46] people he was scared of the Jews he was
[1:32:48] scared of the he was actually afraid of
[1:32:50] them why did it why did he deny the Lord
[1:32:52] Jesus you think he he denied because he
[1:32:54] was afraid he was afraid when he went up
[1:32:58] in the upper room he was afraid but when
[1:33:00] he came out of the upper ooh but that's
[1:33:01] afraid of him that's the difference
[1:33:05] before you get the Holy Ghost you might
[1:33:07] be afraid but well after you get the
[1:33:09] Holy Ghost the devil is afraid of you
[1:33:12] well that was good wasn't it
[1:33:14] then the brother man said when the
[1:33:16] weakest Christian gets on an easy frame
[1:33:18] makes a devil tremble that's the weak
[1:33:21] that's what about the strongest you're
[1:33:24] Abraham's role your face is your strong
[1:33:26] in faith I'm just almost getting where I
[1:33:30] can preach a little bit now on it's time

[1:33:43] Ghost and you know I mean your life

[1:36:01] so he's going to require much more of us
[1:36:05] than he did other Lutheran's or the
[1:36:08] Methodists because we walk in a greater
[1:36:11] life with a greater power with a greater
[1:36:14] a greater witness than they had now we

[1:36:19] resurrection

[1:37:20] would you want to give him the very best
[1:37:21] you have he saved the best for last he
[1:37:27] say the very best for last
[1:37:29] he said it's a prophet the greatest
[1:37:30] vindicated prophet that we've ever had
[1:37:32] on the face of the earth outside of the
[1:37:33] Lord Jesus brother Graham said he didn't
[1:37:36] he had more success in my ministry that
[1:37:38] he did in his own Jesus now not brother
[1:37:41] round me Jesus giving Jesus a credit
[1:37:43] more vindicated any other messenger the
[1:37:46] greatest message the seals and opens the
[1:37:49] revelation of truth all the wonderful
[1:37:51] things we are understanding and believe
[1:37:53] the very best and you want to play
[1:37:57] around with God not me brother not me
[1:38:01] for me and my house we're gonna serve
[1:38:04] the Lord for me and my house we're gonna
[1:38:09] serve the Lord

[1:38:18] week I don't know but we're that close
[1:38:20] and remembering I die I don't want to I
[1:38:26] don't want to I don't want to get into
[1:38:28] souls are now in prison but but he's
[1:38:34] expecting more of us we'll just leave it
[1:38:35] at that he's going to require much more
[1:38:38] of us than he did Lutheran's or the
[1:38:40] methods because we walk in a greater
[1:38:41] light greater power we have a greater
[1:38:43] witness of the resurrection more for
[1:38:45] more sure than a ham oh brother we are
[1:38:48] privileged people musicians why don't
[1:38:51] you come while I finish up live holy
[1:38:59] lifts Len live separated don't live a
[1:39:04] loose life give up the things the world
[1:39:07] it's not worth it it's not worth it I
[1:39:10] heard a person tell me I didn't go on
[1:39:13] path by come on musicians had a person
[1:39:15] tell me said well I'm gonna let my
[1:39:17] children grow up and let them make their
[1:39:20] own decision don't try it don't take
[1:39:22] them Church don't train them you know
[1:39:23] just let them grow up that's insanity if
[1:39:30] you think about it they don't even have
[1:39:32] a chance because they're born with a
[1:39:34] snake nature they're born already
[1:39:36] whipped you might say they're born come
[1:39:40] as rural speaking lies and if they've
[1:39:42] never told about God what chance do they
[1:39:44] have I mean outside of election maybe
[1:39:46] what chance did to have if you take him
[1:39:49] if you train train up a child away she
[1:39:50] go if you train him up right take him to
[1:39:53] church teach him have a godly home then
[1:39:55] he's still only got let's just say you
[1:39:58] know you told him right he's born wrong
[1:40:02] he has at least a fighting chance but if
[1:40:06] you know trying to put always to go what
[1:40:07] chance does he have no wonder brother
[1:40:10] Ram sent him outside of election now he
[1:40:13] said a child that's been taking his to
[1:40:16] church so just paraphrase now child has
[1:40:18] been raised up in the Lord got a 95%
[1:40:20] better chance to become a Christian than
[1:40:22] Wanda don't why because he's been
[1:40:25] right you take a baby that's born in
[1:40:28] America he's brand-new let's say I've
[1:40:30] used the example before you take him to
[1:40:32] Russia and then he says stays in Russia
[1:40:35] six years then you bring him back to
[1:40:37] America he went over Russia when he's
[1:40:39] six months old he says they're six years
[1:40:41] he comes back to America what language
