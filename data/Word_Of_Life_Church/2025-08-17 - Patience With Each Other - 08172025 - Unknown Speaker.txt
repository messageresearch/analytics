And most of all, Lord, that you can be here with us and make it what it is, Lord. That it can be a place where we come and worship you in spirit and in truth, Father.

Are you glad for that this morning? Give him one more good hand clap of praise. Amen. [Music] [Applause] I have stood for the gospel when it seemed I stood alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Through the heartache and frustration, kept my focus on the throne. So many times I have recall. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Savior's word so true. If you won't be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you won't be ashamed, &gt;&gt; I won't be of you. So I proudly stand until I see [Music] the face of the one. Say it to him, church. everything for me along with the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. Every battle that I've ever fought will fade from memory. I'll bow before his mighty throne and fall down on my knees. when the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. [Music] The road has not been easy. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. &gt;&gt; Times I've lost my way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So often I've stumbled searching for the light of day. circumstances all around me. I thought I'd surely fall. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When the whispering of doubt and fear told me you will lose it all like this. &gt;&gt; But he came with his amazing grace. Oh, and someday soon I'll have the chance to thank you face to face. Oh, when the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. Every battle that I fought, it'll fade from memory. I'll bow before his mighty throne. and fall down on my knees with a reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. We will join the millions. Every kind tongue and raise your voice. Every child of God that day will look upon you. When the heroes and the martyrs who died on the pagan show stand together, &gt;&gt; we'll all stand together and declare &gt;&gt; Jesus is Lord. &gt;&gt; He's Lord. Oh, when the reasons I'm standing stand in front of me. Every battle that I fought, it'll fade from me. Memory. I'll bow before his mighty throne and fall down on my knees. with the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me. I'll bow before his mighty throne. &gt;&gt; Yes, we will. And fall down on my knees. When the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me stands in front of me. Give the Lord a good hand clap this morning. God bless you. Hallelujah. You can have your seat this morning. Give our singers a nice hand as they get ready. [Music] Going through so many changes. [Music] What's the news for today? Somebody's hurt. Somebody's aching. [Music] Somebody's trying to find a way. A heavy heart can break your will. A troubled soul leaves time standing still. If you're hurting, please don't hide. Lift up your head. I'm on your side. When every mountain seems too high, when every river looks too wide, when my dreams are lost and see, Jesus rescues me. My faith is strong and carries me. Though sometimes we still believe. My life is built on his desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. I know you're looking for an answer, searching for some hope to hold. Empty hands leave you waiting and praying for a miracle. Jesus hears your every cry. He sees the walls that you can't climb. [Music] And he will heal your hurting soul and lead you safely to his home. Every mountain seems too high and every river looks too wide. When my dreams are lost and sea, Jesus rescues me. The strongest carries me. Sometimes we still believe my life is built on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. When every mountain seems too high, when every river looks too high, when my dreams are sea, that's when Jesus rescues me. My faith is strong and carries me. Sometimes the weak still. My life is built on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. My life is built on this desire. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. [Music] Sure been good to come back to my old home. It's been been many many years since I've come the beautiful church. My friends are growing up and getting gayheaded. I'm still still pretty young looking. So, um, you know, I was traveling and listening a little bit of the news and you hear about Russia and you hear about the things going on and and you hear about I've got lots of friends and some people have passed away recently. Over the last three, four weeks or five weeks, we've had three people pass away and the anxiety and the worry and the stress seems to be a day-to-day battle that we're fighting. But there is one man that came so that you don't have to worry. And he stands beside you every moment. If you know this song, sing it with me. Out on the water, storms raging high. The water surrounds them. They were troubled that night as fear filled their hearts. They thought that they would die. They failed to remember that the master was not. And he spoke the words. The winds all stood still. Even the waters obeyed his will and he called their storms just like he will mind if I just remember. He lives deep inside. So why should I worry? Why should I fear? And that very same Jesus stays always dear. And he lives in my heart. And he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. [Music] We read in the Bible how he walks within a light to their darkness when the way looks so dear. How great it would be to have his steps leading mine and to walk with the master all of the time. So when trials come and death seems so nice, you just call on his name and he'll get there on time. And when I'm in trouble and my body's in pain, all I have to do is call out his name. So why should we worry? Why should we fear the very same Jesus? He's standing so near. He lives in our hearts and he hears when I cry. I'll follow his name. Till the storm passes by. He read in the Bible, but he walked with them from light to their darkness. And their way looked so dear. How great it would be. Heavy steps leading mine to walk with the master all of the time. know which bios come and the death seems so nice. Just call on his name. He'll get there on time. And if you're in trouble and your body in pain, all you have to do is call his name. Why should I worship you? Sing with me. Why should I in that very same Jesus? He's always so near. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. Just call on his name till your storm passes by. Just call on his name till your storm passes by. [Music] [Music] [Music] As everybody's getting ready, we I think I speak for the whole choir when we say, "Help us worship him." We love It's a We love his song. And I'm so glad that I know a name that I can call out on. When I'm down in my lowest valley, it doesn't matter. He's always there for me. I know a name that can silence a roaring waves. I know a name [Music] that can empty out a grave. I know a name. It's the only name that saves and is worthy of all praise. I call you Jesus. I call you I call you healer. rising and reigning in power. Something comes out of the grave. Every time I call you Jesus, I call you. I call you savior. Worthy of glory forever. Something comes out of the grave. Every time I call your name, I have a king with dominion over death. He holds the keys in his holy nail scarred hands. He is the heel [Music] that has crushed the serpent's head. Our resurrected great I am. I call you Jesus. I call you. I call you healer. Rising and reigning in power. Something comes out of the grave. Every time I call you Jesus, I call you. I call you Savior. Worthy of glory forever. Something comes out of the grave. Every time I call your name, chains break, dry bones break. Every time I call your name, the gates of hell shake. Every time I call your name, chain break, drive awake. Every time I call your name, the gates I will shake every time I call your name. Oh, every time I call your name. Yeah. [Music] Where all death is now your sting? And where all great your [Music] Where are is now your st and where your victory dead things come alive. Dead things come alive. Dead things come alive in the name of Jesus. Dead things come alive.

Found my healing in the name of &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; I was healed in the name of &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Found my freedom in the name &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Found my breakthrough in the name &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I call you Jesus.

Something comes out of me &gt;&gt; every time I call your name. [Music] [Music] It's a good thing little David wasn't here. He'd have tore this church up, wasn't he? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; God bless. You can be seated. We have a baby to dedicate today. Mine and Carol's niece and nephew from Kentucky had a new addition to their family. So I bring them we dedicate to the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. [Music] Let's just bow our heads together. Heavenly fathers, my brother and sister and their children stand before you. We realize what a great heritage the children are. What a gift from God and you have what a responsibility from God as well. Dear Lord, I pray that you would just help Joe and Hope today that as they bring their little children up to you and try to rear them and teach them and the admonition of God. What a challenge it is for parents truly in this hour to want to instruct their children in the ways that please you. Every day we live, our nation, our world is getting darker and darker. But in reality, that's what makes our light shine so bright. Father, I pray that you'd just be with them, Lord. Dear God, this new little addition to their family, no doubt with his own unique personality and own makeup. We just pray, Father, that you'd help each of them to help each other. We know that a God-given family is a great gift to you. As a matter of fact, the first thing in heaven was not skyscrapers and banks and loan institutions. But father when you placed the garden and then you brought a man and placed him there and then out of that man you brought a wife. Your intention was to bring forth children by the spoken word from that union. But Lord, even though they forfeited that right, you've still made a way and we're grateful that you have. We dedicate this little life to you today, Father, for a life of service. Take him, I pray, Lord. take this little family, keep him in your grace, in your mercy, Father, in the name of Jesus we pray. Amen. Put him right to sleep. Bless you. [Applause] Can we stand together? What a privilege it is for us to be in the house of God today, isn't it? &gt;&gt; What a great honor the Lord has given us that we can be able to come together. Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. I want to speak to you today on patience with each other. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure this is probably not for anyone here but Carol and I. And we so appreciate y'all being patient while the Lord takes this entire sermon and deals with Carol and myself. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. Second Peter 1:2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. according as his divine power hath given us unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature. What greater honor could we have than to be partakers of the divine nature? Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge. And to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. Now, before I speak today, I just want to reiterate it to you again. This sermon today is not for everyone. As a matter of fact, it's only for a very very small handful of people around the world. There'll be an element of people that will hear it, desire to have it, but really will never attain to it because it's not for everybody. It's only for those who are ordained to be in the body of God and have the image of God. Other people can be Christians and they will be saved. But this message is more than just for saved people. &gt;&gt; Is it for you? &gt;&gt; It's for me. I'm one of them who may like to be remembered today as we pray and ask God's blessings on the word. Heavenly Father, I don't say those things lightly. And I realize, Lord Jesus, that if we have the desire to be conformed into this image, we're a very blessed people. For many people will be satisfied just in going to church. They can treat God's people awful. They can call them names. They can run them down. They'll live ungodly, dress ungodly, just do horrible, terrible things. And they won't realize until the bomb drops or they're caught in the tsunami or they're trying to survive after the earthquake hits. And then they begin to realize they've played church and they've missed opportunity after opportunity to align with your word already. Father, we can see by the signs of the time when you anointed your prophet to speak it in 1965 that that city of Los Angeles, it would be worse than it was in the days of last days of Pompei. At that time, scientists were saying that there would be a big one, but they were saying that it was impossible for part of the earth to break away and fall down into the ocean. But as we go on in time, they are saying scientifically more and more of what your prophet said decades and decades ago. And now the ring of fire is more active than it's ever been. And Lord, we saw heard the news of the one up in Russia. And from there it turned out great volcanic explosions, some that have been silent for hundreds of years. And the scientists are getting more terrified. But Lord Jesus, for those of us who are ready, we are not afraid. We are with great anticipation, longing for your coming. Help us today, Father, as we look into your word. May our lives be shaped into this image. In the name of the Lord Jesus we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Let's tap back for just a few moments if you don't mind. Patience first of all must be toward God and his promise. Peter when he writes this, no doubt it was quite a a great thing for him in his life when the spirit of God had revealed this to him. Not necessarily in the same way that some of the words come to Paul because Paul was a prophet and a church age messenger, but by inspiration, Peter Peter caught this element to be able to bring it to the people of God. And it was different than anything Peter had ever written. He wrote about the lamb. He wrote about experiences that he had. And he wrote about different things that God gave him about the conditions of the church and so on. But yet for him to be able to catch this was a pretty phenomenal thing of the image of the building blocks of God to be able to build God a body. For we know when the Lord Jesus came that he quoted back to the word and said, "Lo, it is written of me, a body hast thou prepared me." And again, lo, I come in the volume of the book. So the prophecies of the Old Testament were the building blocks not only of Jesus natural anatomy, of course, the natural body, but of the spiritual making. And God was making a bridegroom. So he made a bridegroom out of prophetic words. So what do you figure the bride will be? If the bridegroom was prophetic words, then in order to have a bride which will be of the same character, she must also be prophetic words. And then whenever Peter was able to catch this, I imagine that some of the brethren as they read this, they thought this is absolutely astounding. And remember, Simon Peter was an ignorant and an unlearned man. And yet the words that God gave him to use, this word patience, we've looked at it before. Steadfastness, characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly. Now remember, this is not something that Peter had naturally. We don't see what his story was. He wound up being a cursing preacher. So this certainly didn't define him. It didn't define him by his first birth. But no doubt by now he had already in seed form and it kept unfolding a little more and a little more and a little more to where he himself had already been experiencing these seven virtues and then the eights he was waiting on to cap him. Ecclesiastes 7:8 says, "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit." Anybody say amen to that promise? &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 2:6, who will render to every man according to his deeds, to them by patient continuence. Now even though this is a different English word, it's the exact same Greek word that Paul used or Peter used rather when he wrote about the virtues here. It's exact same word. So it means steadfastness, constancy, endurance. So here Paul takes the same thought now and writes and says to them who by patient continuence in welloing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life. Romans 12:12 rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation. Same Greek word but a little different meaning to this word. Endure, take patiently to preserve under misfortunes and trials, to hold fast one's faith in Christ, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation. Now listen what tribulation is. Affliction, trouble, anguish, burdened to be afflicted, oppressing together, oppression, affliction, tribulation, distress, straits. Sounded like my week this week. &gt;&gt; Sounded like any of your week or your day? Now notice this is what an element of people are going to tame to rejoicing and hope. patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer, instant in prayer. Now, we all have instant potatoes, instant coffee, instant this, instant that. But there are times in our life when we need to be instant in prayer. The wherefors and the thous and the this and that and the other. You ever get in a real, you know, in a real pickle in your life? and the wherefors and the thous and the thou hast not and thou hast and all that. You just lay aside all that religious vernacular and say, "Dear God, I need help." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Why? Cuz then you're calling out from your heart instead of trying to impress him or impress somebody else that's hearing you with the these and the thouss. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what? He knows what your heart is anyway. rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer. 2 Thessalonians chapter 3:5. And the Lord direct your hearts. I love the way Paul wrote this. Direct your hearts into the love of God. And I don't think this comes automatically just because you become a Christian. But God must give us divine direction for our heart to be directed into the love of God. Now a person can be directed into what they think is the love of God. But only God can direct us into his love because he's the author of that love. And the Lord direct, guide, make straight of the removal of the hindrances to come to one. Now, this is why we come to church that the spirit of God can be able to take I know preaching is foolishness. I know it every time I do it. That's what the Bible calls it through the foolishness of preaching. But God can take the foolishness of preaching and be able to take a gift in a man's life and be able to say things that you talked about coming to church or say things that you said yesterday or the day before and give you a direction. It may not be but three or four words and you'll sat there the entire service and you got the first three or four words and the rest of it you just worship with everybody else. But you knew God gave you a rama word from him. &gt;&gt; Now it's awesome whenever we will get the logos which is what I'm sharing with you right now. The logos which is the thought or the concept of God for the age. But God is so awesome that he will not only give us written logos, but he will use his anointed men which are gifted from the foundation of the world and send you in particular a Rama word. Now that Rama word isn't always one that is written, but remember Rama is that which Paul wrote about that the just shall live by faith and that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word. That's not logos. That is Rama. What is Rama? It is a word that is fitted in season for you in the time that you need it. I believe when we come to the house of God, that's what we ought to come for. So watch Paul as he writes that the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, which is agape, of course, and into the patient waiting for Christ. Now, the prophet says all different types of things about patient and patience and impatient and all that. I love this one in shalom when he says, "Some people says, "But brother Brandham, I've tried and I've tried, but wait a minute. Patience is virtue." Patience is Holy Spirit virtue. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. You say, "How can I wait any longer?" Listen to this deep answer. Just keep on waiting. How can I wait any longer? Just keep on waiting. When you've done all you can do to stand, then stand. Just stand. How am I going to do it? Stand. He said, "It's the truth." And it's the truth. He said it'll happen. How? I don't know, but it'll happen. He said so. He promised it. If he promised it, it's going to happen. That's all. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Events made clear by prophecy. I love this one as well. In this, the true believers in the word who accept it in that way believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promises in every one of them to be manifested in its age. waiting for the prophesied promises to be manifested in its age. Every believer has watched for it. Every believer that's been on their toes watching is the one that it's been revealed to. Now truly God unfolds that trust that we must have in him. And you know God knows exactly the divine order which we able need to be able to receive it. And truly, we'll never be able to have the right patience with one another if we don't have the right element and measure of patience with God. Now, dealing with God and dealing with our brothers and sisters, of course, is a total different thing in one way, but in another way, we are also measured by how we attribute our love to God by the way we treat one another. Now when you or I are mean to God's people or we will treat God's people bad, we don't look at it this way. But actually when you are mean toward a saint of God or you tell lies or you fabricate things against the children of God, you might as well have done it against the Lord Jesus. That's true. Now you see in our minds we think well I I treat him with so much devotion and so much love and I love him so much but I don't like his people. I don't like I don't like I don't like and somehow we separate that in our mind and think that's fine with God but I'd like for you to show me where that's at in the word &gt;&gt; and I'd like for you to show me that in the message of the hour. As a matter of fact, God and his people in that sense are inseparable. Many people will be lost not because they didn't believe on the cross, but because they treated God's people in the age they lived bad. Jesus said, "When you've done it to the least of these, my brothers, you have done it unto me." &gt;&gt; So, if I was you, I'd be nice to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course, I realize everybody ain't got that much kindness. They just got a little bit of it and they got already spread it out. I really feel sorry for those types of Christians, but we know there's all kinds of them. Now, notice that Jesus himself as God, he would have had this attribute of pre of patience in such a measure that you and I will never be able to attain to as an individual. But in the act of condescension when he come to the earth, now it wasn't that he wasn't royal and divine and holy. He was all of that. But what he did was he emptied himself of the measure of all of these things that he had as God and condescended into a form of a diluted or washed down measure of these things that we're talking about. So the Lord Jesus would have experienced patience with the people around him and with his disciples mainly in a more human measure than he would have in a divine measure. Now he would have dealt with love. He would have dealt with forgiveness. We know that he dealt with temptation in a human level and not in a divine level. Let me say this so you understand it. If Jesus overcomes sexual temptation as God, he can never understand what any of us go through as humans. &gt;&gt; If he overcome whatever it would be, the prophet said he was tempted by lying. He was tempted by drinking. He was tempted by women. And Paul said he was tempted in all points like as we are. 1949, the prophet tells us that Jesus suffered sexual temptation. But God cannot be tempted. So if Jesus was tempted as God, he never even felt it. It never bothered him. It never even come into his mind to even to start in the process of conception of sin. So when I go to him as a high priest, I'm basically wasting my time unless he suffered it as a man. You believe he did? So then whenever we look at that, he condescended from his great person of what he was. So he stepped down from the sheckiah which is what we would call in the English the shakina glory of God and he stepped down into a human form that as a little boy no doubt that Jesus learning to walk and he fell like every other little Jewish boy and his mama would have to come and pick him up and you know kiss his bruises and maybe Jesus would fall and bite his lip as he would fall and his mama would would get something on a cross and wet that and wipe the blood off of it and yet her soul wasn't redeemed whenever that blood would come off of Jesus' lips onto her hands. So Jesus would cry when he was hungry and Jesus would fall down and when Jesus first started learning how to walk, he would be like any 18-month-old boy or 2-year-old, he would fall and maybe bust his nose or whatever he would do. So it condescended to that level. Now whenever he receives the Holy Ghost, if he received the Holy Ghost in a way that is different from us, now remember that he was the predestinated seed word that God spoke. But he lived for 30 years in this life without the Holy Ghost. Without the Holy Ghost. Come on, somebody. I preached it to you enough. You should already know it. He lived 30 years in this life as a man without the Holy Ghost. So what does he receive? Now, one great difference of course was that he did not receive a portion. He received the fullness of the godhead. You and I receive a portion. But if our portion is not equivalent to give us the power to overcome, he's still unjust by demanding of me that I walk like him whenever he got all this great massive volume and I only got a little symbol full. So you see, he knows that even a symbol full can help me overcome just like all the heavens full can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So watch now. The Lord Jesus allowed himself to be in this realm of humanity and feel weary and no doubt people exhausted him. The people would be pulling on him and constantly wanting healing and deliverance and and this and that. And and no doubt Jesus as a man, he would look upon the people and feel so sorry for them as a human being. But he couldn't go in there and just at will heal everybody where he went to where they were sick. But we know that the man that was actually uh crippled and had been laying there for 38 years at the pool. And the Lord Jesus passed through the multitude. So there was crippled babies and little girls and little boys and blind children, blind mammas and daddies, all kinds of people, a multitude of people that were there. And the Lord Jesus meandered and worked his way around and worked his way around until he went to a man that had prostate trouble. Now, it wasn't going to kill him. He'd been laying there for many, many years. And it was evident that he had been, you know, in that sense, he was unlike many of the others that were there. Why did Jesus go to that one and pass all the rest of those? Cuz the father had showed him a vision. So what did he do? He submitted himself to the leadership of the spirit of God. So with him was all the power of God in him could not do as he so desired or as he willed it. Nevertheless, not my will but thy will be done. What makes us think we can? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was an example of obedience. Luke 2:52. And he went back home and submitted himself unto Joseph and Mary, of course, and grew in knowledge and in wisdom before God and man. You imagine the word, the logos. And the logos submitted himself to growing. Why didn't Jesus start preaching when he was a 12y old boy? I mentioned it to you the other day. Little David Walker, which is still alive. And he was a little assembly of God guy. And brother Bam actually said he was called to preach. And he started preaching about 9 or 10 years old, something like that. Had meetings everywhere. People come to the altar and get saved. Brother Bam said if the Pentecostal people would have rallied around that little boy's gift, it would have been phenomenal what God would have done. But he said because this one come out of a certain denomination, then the other people had to have one, too. So they had a little David and a little Bob and a little Jim and a little George and a little this and that and the other. And the little old boy just quit preaching. He's still alive today. Now you think why? Jealousy, jealousy. But yet Jesus allowed himself to feel like you and I would feel. Turn with me if you would to Mark 10:35. So Jesus had to have patience with the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, but he had to have a different patience from the same virtue of course, but manifested in a way to his disciples would in one way been more trying. Now watch in James 10:35. And James and John the sons of Zebedee came unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou should us do for us whatsoever we shall desire. Now, I want you to notice how childish they approach this. They're wanting him to agree to it before they even mention what they want. &gt;&gt; They should have known him better than that by now. Notice how they word it. Saying, "Master, we would that thou should us do for us whatsoever, whatsoever we shall desire," even before they stated it. Now, now watch Jesus. And he said unto them, "What would ye like you didn't know that I should do for you?" And they said unto him, Grant us that we may sit one on thy right hand and one on thy left hand in thy glory. Now that is a sign to us the highest position in the kingdom that is to come. Cuz they kept hearing him talk about a kingdom and a throne and all that. And they thought, you know what? He's told us whatever you ask in my name, I'll do it. and you've not asked anything in my name, so ask and I'll give it to you. Ask and you shall receive. Knock and it shall be opened unto you. Whatever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them. But every one of those promises have to be applied in the right way or you make the word of God, not the will of God. So they could have went to him with promises, but of course they knew he knew the word and they didn't feel like the word was actually important to quote him. So now the prevalent thing was their own desire. So apparently they had not learned yet that the cross must come before the crown. They had not yet learned that suffering comes before glorification. They had not yet learned that character must preede the right to reign. &gt;&gt; So they just thought it was just that simple. Just ask for. Now remember these two brothers were among the elite of the disciples. They were some of the best. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But even the best of God's people can have problems with pride &gt;&gt; and arrogance &gt;&gt; and wanting to be above their brothers and their sisters. &gt;&gt; Now notice Jesus response. Mark 10:38. And Jesus said unto them, "You know not what you ask." Can you drink of the cup I drink of? &gt;&gt; Boys, be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful what you're going to say. Watch them answer in their pride. I myself as a Bible reader, I wonder by answering this question in pride how much more they added to their own life. &gt;&gt; Because of their arrogance, I'm talking about elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But remember, they were elect without the Holy Ghost. Can you drink of the cup I drink of and be baptized with the baptism baptism that I'm baptized with? Now remember Jesus is likening the cup from the Old Testament silitude how that a cup was the prophet talked about it that he saw a cup with bitter drags in the bottom of the cup. So it would be a lot of life, a position in life, or it could be judgment that's meed out to you. So Jesus is asking them, "All right, boys, this is what you want. Now, let me ask you a question. Can you drink of the cup that I drink of?" And before he he lets them answer, he goes on and say, "Can you be baptized with the baptism that I'm to be baptized with?" Now he's not talking about water baptism, but he's talking about again the type of anguish and sorrow and the difficulty in life. I wonder how many things friends we have added to our self because of our pride. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now notice their response. And they said unto him, "We can." &gt;&gt; How in their right mind could they after hearing all the words that he had said, "Yes, whatever you bear, we can bear it right with you. Cuz we are so tough, man. We are the best ones you've got. And if anybody can handle it, we can. It ain't no wonder God hates that thing. &gt;&gt; You know where our spirit comes from? Hell. &gt;&gt; God hates arrogance &gt;&gt; and pride. &gt;&gt; And they said unto him, we can. And Jesus said unto them, "Ye shall indeed." I wonder how much easier John's life. John, John, the beloved John. How much easier. But because of his pride and his arrogance, his destiny was multiplied from this day on. Not so much the glory, but the cup, the bitterness, the dregs that was added to James and John's life. And Jesus said unto them, "You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of." You boys are certainly going to have it. And with the baptism that I'm baptized with, with all shall you be baptized. But you will get more trouble. You will get more anguish. You will deal with more stuff than you ever thought possible in your life. But you will not get the thrones you wanted. Lord have mercy. Children, think whenever we're asking God for selfish things and motives to feed our pride and our arrogance that God indeed may grant to us more trouble, more heartache, more suffering, more difficulty, and still not give you the main thing you asked for. They didn't ask for that. They didn't want more heartache. They didn't want more anxiety, brother Scott. But Jesus said, "You will have it. &gt;&gt; But in your arrogance, you wanted for the right hand throne and the left hand thrown." Well, I hate to tell you, boys, that ain't mine to give. &gt;&gt; But because of your pride and arrogance, you just ask for a whole lot more in life. Dear God, help us all. Anybody say, "Help me, Lord." Oh my. But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give. Can you imagine now? Here by chapter 10 in the book of Mark, Jesus is getting closer and closer to heading up to Jerusalem and be crucified. And here he's facing these horrific things. And all they've got in their mind is their position. What am I going to get out of this? If he's leaving, what am I going to become? You imagine them getting together and talking about way think about it, James. You reckon we should ask him? I think we should. I mean, who knows? He may give it to Peter. Lord have mercy. What in the world will the church be if Peter gets it? What will it be if if Jude gets it? What will it be if this one gets it? I'll tell you one thing. Don't you agree, brother, that we're some of the greatest preachers of the message? I do, brother. Amen. Glory to God. Ain't nobody got love for Jesus like we do. Look at you. You're constantly laying on his breast over there. And James, I mean, you're one of the great ones. Ain't we always in the inner circle of things going on? We are. Well, don't you think maybe that's a type that we're supposed to be some of the greatest preachers in the message and that a lot of the people around the message are going to start moving to our church and we're going to be a great gigantic mega church? &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, I just changed their speech to what some of the modern message preachers want. &gt;&gt; I don't want a mega church. &gt;&gt; I want a church full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; People who love God &gt;&gt; and love one another. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's 15 or500 or whatever it is. I want what God wants for me. &gt;&gt; I'm not asking for the throne on the left or the right. As a matter of fact, I ain't even asking for one &gt;&gt; cuz I'm afraid I might get in the flesh somehow and instead of getting a throne, I get a whooping. &gt;&gt; I ain't like some of you. God lets some of you get by with lying. &gt;&gt; Some of you can treat God's children like dogs &gt;&gt; and God let you get by with it. &gt;&gt; Makes me wonder if you're a son or daughter. &gt;&gt; God won't let me do that. You say, &gt;&gt; and to be honest with you, I'm glad I got marks all over me. &gt;&gt; God whoops me. Whoop any the rest of y'all or you just let you get by with all your stuff. Now watch how the Lord Jesus had to have patience and he said to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them. Oh my. For whom it is prepared. So Jesus didn't say there wouldn't be two great men that wouldn't get it. Great men. Maybe first church age messenger and seventh one. Who knows? Notice in verse 41 now. And when the 10 heard him, they began to be much displeased. You can imagine. So they do it. I mean, what's the matter with James and John? My goodness. In front of all the rest of the brothers. And they're all as jealous as they can be of one another. And they asked right in front of them. And boy, whenever the other 10 heard about it, then Mark says that they began to be much displeased. Look at this word. Have indignation to be indignant. &gt;&gt; So they didn't just get their feathers ruffled a little bit. They was in the flogging mood. &gt;&gt; They were indignant preachers. The first apostles of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; But you know what? This shows me this jealous reaction shows me they also wanted the same thing &gt;&gt; and they were terrified because they they thought they had been outmaneuvered. &gt;&gt; So instead of feeling sorry for their brothers, they were so mad. And you imagine Jesus with his patience. &gt;&gt; Boy, he could have preached these guys a sermon, couldn't he? Sit down, boys. It's time for the preacher to preach to the preachers. He's fixing to. Verse 42. But Jesus called to them and sith unto them, you know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them, but so shall it not be among you. But whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister. &gt;&gt; Wow. So you mean great and minister is not synonymous. &gt;&gt; But how come we think it is? &gt;&gt; Actually church, you're not called to serve me. I'm called to serve you. &gt;&gt; Every God called preacher is called to serve the people of God. &gt;&gt; You're not to make heroes out of them. You're not to make idols out of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you all could vote me out after this sermon today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I can't vote you out. &gt;&gt; God sure knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? Now we're, as I dealt with it Wednesday night, we'll pick it up again for a little bit more, maybe this coming Wednesday night. We're supposed to be a cult and a cult leader cannot be voted out &gt;&gt; because he is the leader. &gt;&gt; But yet you all can vote me out, the deacons, the trustees. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So what kind of cult is this &gt;&gt; to where that the cult leader can be voted out and the people can pick whoever? Brother Brandham himself said that if brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah witness doctrine and that's what the church wanted even brother Brandham couldn't stop it &gt;&gt; well praise the Lord &gt;&gt; now you see when we get in his proper perspective then we can see where reverence and honor and respect and servitude all goes together so then the men of God should be respected yes but their respect ed not as great and big and marvelous and wonderful, but they're they're to be respected because of their servitude to the body of God and also the master's use. &gt;&gt; Now watch. So Jesus says, "It shall not be so among you. Whosoever shall be great among you shall be your minister, and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all." How could he say this? Because this is what he done. This is what he done. For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister to give his life a ransom for many. &gt;&gt; You mean not everybody? &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; For many. Mark 9:33. And he came to Capernaum. And being in the house, he asked them, "What was it you disputed among yourselves, by the way? But they had held their peace." Well, Jesus knows how to shut us up, don't he? For by the way, they had disputed. Now, remember this is leading up to what we just read. They had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest. And he sat down and called the twel and saith unto them, "If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all." And he took a child and set him in the midst of them. So here's Dr. Simon Peter and Dr. John, Dr. James, and Dr. Jude, and Bartholomew and all the rest of them. And Jesus picks this little bitty old young and he said, "Come here, little fella." And Jesus just sets them right amongst them big preachers and he said, "Boys, right here's your example. Here's your example. Patience. I don't mind telling you I'm not glad God just gave me grace, but I'm glad after God saved me that God still had patience with me. I don't know about you in your walk, but I I still need God to have patience with me. Although I've been a saved most of my life, been preaching most of my life, but I still mess up. Anybody here still mess up and make mistakes and well &gt;&gt; well Carol honey &gt;&gt; I guess this sermon wasn't just for me and you. Bless your heart, little darling. Wow. There must be some more folks here just like us. I know there's some of you who come here and you're absolutely perfect and you just that's why you just don't like my preaching because you're so perfect and you're looking for a perfect preacher. Well, I hope you find him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know a lot of the ones around the world today and I've met a lot of them. All the nations of the world that I've been. I ain't never found one yet. Of course, it's possible there could be one out there. A perfect preacher with a perfect church. But I beg you, please don't move there because if you do, you'll mess up the whole thing. &gt;&gt; I don't like you. I'll tell you one thing. You beat that. You know what? That may be the kind of preaching you need to set under. Now watch Jesus humiliating them. Brother Rob, can you imagine the patience that Jesus had to have? He took a child and sent them in the midst of them when he had taken up in his arms and said unto them, "Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me. Whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me." And John answered, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name. He followth not us. And we forbade him. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't in our ranks of the message. And we just flat told him, "You don't belong in the message." &gt;&gt; Patience. Patience. Now, I want you to notice the reason that John says they done this. Do you think it was just by happen stance that Jesus called James and John the sons of thunder? Not the sons of life. Not the sons of God, but the sons of thunder. We've got a few sons and daughters of thunder in our church. Woo! Rumble, rumble, rumble. Oh my. So to me it is such a miracle to see what God did with this man who was transformed and turned into the most beloved disciple of the New Testament who started out as a son of thunder. &gt;&gt; There's hope for me sure as a world. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and say for the rest of you, there's hope for the rest of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Forbid him not, for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is on our part." But look at sectarianism. how it's already among the message 2,000 years ago. So maybe this brother was just doing on and you know he wasn't called by Jesus to be among the original 12 but he's out there and he heard about the message and he just had a burden to go do it. Lance and he just doing all that he knows to do it. Hey hey hey what's your papers? &gt;&gt; Did Jesus ordain you? We want to know. We want to see your baptismal certificate. Who who signed your baptismal certificate? Because Jesus signed ours. Jesus baptized us. Jesus personally called. Did Jesus call you person? [Music] &gt;&gt; Sectarianism already there on the apostles. &gt;&gt; God forgive us. Jesus is close to the end of his ministry. Now, those of you that are familiar with the setting of St. John 13. You know that whenever Satan enters into Judas and Jesus goes out, then Jesus begins to unveil mysteries in St. John 14:15, 16,1 17 on down through there only with the elect. So they move into a higher sphere of hearing him speak words that he never spoke when Judas was there. Because you know, God knows exactly what to say when Judas tops hanging around. Whenever they do finally pull away, then he'll really start talking to his bride. So this is where they are here in St. John 16:29. And his disciples said unto him, Lo, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee, By this we believe, that thou camest forth from God? And Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? You mean just now?" You finally caught it. I'm a few hours from the cross after three and a half years of hearing me teach and preach and live the word and walk the word. And you all are finally convinced. Thank God for patience. &gt;&gt; Now let's watch page 40 of Statue of a Perfect Man. The prophet said we should have patience with one another, too. See, one time we get so impatient with one anothers and we think we got to be like Moses. Moses had patience with the people and look what it caused them not to go over. See, if you're trying to do something like I've tried to get this message over to the tabernacle to see that each member of the tabernacle becomes this. Now listen at his desire that each member of the tabernacle becomes this. What what he's preaching stature of a perfect man. It's hard to do. I've tried to have patience. This is 33 years to have patience. &gt;&gt; And I've been the pastor of this church for over 37. And some of you that are visitors here today, maybe your pastor has been your pastor for 35 or 40 or however long. Preachers have to have patience, too. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people have to have patience with the preacher &gt;&gt; and God has to have patience with us all. &gt;&gt; Sometimes musicians have to have patience with the singers. Some singers know when to come in when the musicians will give an intro. Some don't need an intro. Some just hear the note and they're able to catch up. Other singers, they never know the synchronization of time. So whether it's a downbeat or an upbeat, whether they're supposed to come in on a flat or a minor or a major or seventh or a diminish, they don't even know. So then the the the musicians will constantly have to adjust and they're adjusting for the singer because the singer just can't get it. Although once they get started, they do a good job, but they don't know when to come in, they don't know when to go out, they don't know when to allow for the intro, the turnaround, and they're just meandering everywhere. and the brothers can be able to kind of cover up unless it's really bad. So what do they do? They need patience. &gt;&gt; Then the song leader needs patience with the congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the congregation needs patience with the song leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or song leaders maybe I should say. &gt;&gt; So no matter what position we hold, we all need patience with one another. But sometimes it's hard to do &gt;&gt; cuz we've all got different makeups and most all of us have got flaws. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now here, brother Brandham, I love I love his honesty. And he's just expressing it from a preacher's perspective. And he said to see each member of the tabernacle become this and it's hard to do. I've tried to have patience. This is 33 years to have patience. Women still bob their hair &gt;&gt; at Brandom Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Women still bob their hair just the same, but you have patience. Wait, you have to. If you ain't got it, don't try to build on this down here. So you imagine that women when he preaches marriage and divorce, he said he had people sitting there in his church that had been married three and four times following the prophet's message. remember seeing the vision or the dream rather that his mother had and him talking about the interpretation of it and the woman going up the three steps justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and she had on a big pair of high heel shoes and she gets up there and starts down that and the prophet told her you can't walk that road with them on &gt;&gt; yeah she pay no attention to him they don't know what he's talking about and she gets up there starts walking down through there and she gets tipsy and toppsy and all that sort of thing which he said the Bible prophesied in Isaiah that's the way they'd be and the woman gets up there walking down that road and she falls off the road and here she falls screaming and then he takes the analogy of that story and said it shows that Pentecostal women can be justified, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost and leave off one word and miss it. So you preach on love, you preach on forgiveness, you preach against splits, you preach against tight clothes, you preach against revealing dresses, [Music] &gt;&gt; and people do it anyhow. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced people's going to do what they want to do. &gt;&gt; And if that's so, that means I can. &gt;&gt; So I choose to live right. &gt;&gt; What about some of the rest of y'all? What do y'all choose to do? You want to live right? You want to rebel? You want to go to heaven? you want to be in the bride, it's up to you. Look, because people choose in the negative side and we focus so much on that. But there's also some choosing on the positive side. If preachers can preach, if they can choose to preach things that ain't right, that also means that I can choose to preach what is right. If preachers want to give half their all, that means I can choose to give him my all in all. Is that right, brothers and sisters? Amen. &gt;&gt; But it comes down to us having patience with one another and not running out because some people certainly know how to try our patience. Maybe I should say 42 Hail Mary before I go from this point on. You think I don't know. Notice he says even one time when that rebellious bunch of people had such impatience they had caused Moses to do something that was wrong. Yet when it come to the showdown, God got sick of their action. He said, "Separate yourself." And Moses, he said, "I'll kill the whole bunch and start a new." He throwed himself in the breach and said, "God, don't do it." what patience with the people that was rebelling against him. Now, what was that in Moses? Spirit of Christ. &gt;&gt; What is it in a pastor? Now, a pastor is going to need a measure of patience in a different way than an evangelist. Evangelist goes in, he preaches to people and he knows them by name, you know, and by face and so on. and he may have their phone number and they may text him for prayer and have a personal contact, but he goes in and preaches and he goes right back home and then next weekend is somewhere else and the next Wednesday somewhere else and somewhere else and somewhere else. But you know the prophet had a reason when he identified the pastor as being the ox of the team, &gt;&gt; the ox. Now, he wasn't talking about his smell, but he was talking about his strength, his ability to bear the load. The ox being the one that would be so burdened down, dealing with the same people week after week after week and their same shortcomings and their same problems and dealing with them for decades. &gt;&gt; Amen. and yet still be leaving God for them and having patience with them. I'm glad I don't know who's going to be saved cuz I got to be honest as a human being if I know this is ain't is ain't is ain't I'd probably just kind of hone it down a little bit narrower and the hints wouldn't get a whole lot from me. I'd focus on the his not the hints. Don't sit there and look at me like a bunch of angels. You do the exact same thing. So I'm glad I don't know who is and who ain't. Well, I look at it. I'm going to treat everybody as potential seed of God. If I'm going to error, I'm going to error toward nice. I'm going to error toward kindness and toward love and toward mercy. Come on, somebody. Everything I do, I do it as unto the Lord. That way, I never lose. Every individual that I counsel in my office where I show up at 5 in the morning or 7 in the morning or I stay till I can't hardly put one foot in front of the other after I preach under the anointing for an hour, hour and a half, whatever it is. I do it as unto the Lord. That way I never lose. Not one minute have I ever lost in talking to people. Not one minute have I ever lost in studying hours and hours. Not one minute have I ever lost in preaching something and watch people do the opposite because I'm doing it as unto the Lord Jesus. And I will be blessed for it. Is that right? You will be blessed for it if you live it and believe it whether or not everybody else does. And if you don't have that focus before you, you'll be so discouraged. You won't know what to do. Let me just say it to the musicians. Let me say it to the singers and the song leaders and the deacons and the trustees and the Sunday school teachers and all those that give and give and you study and sometimes the kids don't even show up. Don't you let that determine what you do nor how much effort you put into it. And you sing and you sing. Every time you stand up here, sing as if Jesus was sitting right there and Jesus was the only one in this church. Do it as unto the Lord. Preacher brothers, every sermon you preach, preach it as unto the Lord. Deacon brothers, everything you all do, do it as unto the Lord. Oh, I feel like preaching now. I wish somebody would help me. That way, we never lose. And what are we doing? We are allowing God to bring into us the measure of patience that he knows we need. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice this in the seeds not air of the shop. How will you know? How will the world know that you love Jesus? When we love one another, that's what the world will see. God sees your faith and the world sees your action. Love one another. Now be kind one to another. Talk with one another. Be patient. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With God &gt;&gt; with one another. 1 Thessalonians 5:14, I will exhort you, brethren. Warn them that are unruly. Comfort the feeble-minded. &gt;&gt; So remember me with this verse every time you read about it, okay? Comfort the feeble-minded. Support the weak. &gt;&gt; Be patient toward all of those in your intermediate family and then everybody else. Go off on all the rest of them. Surely Paul did not mean all. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Y'all don't believe that. No, no. They're living in the time of Roman persecution when their brothers are being hacked to pieces. &gt;&gt; Their children are being taken out of their message churches. And they would take sheep skins and wrap around their children's bodies and put them out in the coliseum. And then they would have a teenager or a 20-year-old message follower out there in front of them sheep and take a hook and he would lead these little children, five, six, seven, eight, nine years old. And that shepherd would tell them, "Now follow me and say this. And here would come them little message kids and they would be running in the coliseum and they'd turn in jaguars, leopards, lions &gt;&gt; and you see a Roman soldier on the street and you're to be patient with him, you'd feel like spitting on him, smacking him in the face, whatever. As I said friends, everybody can't attain to this. This is not for everybody, &gt;&gt; but it's for somebody. &gt;&gt; And I'm one of them bodies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when Neero had such a beautiful garden and yet he would take the Roman Christians and instead of having torches, he loved to walk in the garden in the nighttime. So he'd take part of our family members, brothers and sisters, and wrap their bodies and dip them in pitch tar t a r. And when it got dark, they would light them on fire two by two by two by two by two. And he would walk out in the gardens as they're screaming and hollering and their flesh is melting like wax on a candle. And you mean to tell me I am to have patience towards such people? Actually them type of people need more sympathy than those who are saved. Right &gt;&gt; now, let's let's look in reality here this morning that people that are lovable, people that have a human makeup and a nature about them and they're just really lovable and likable, they are going to tend to be the ones that more people will gravitate toward and ones that aren't so likable and aren't so lovable. I'm talking about their humanity now. We tend to just kind of stay away from it and give them space as if though they don't need love. But in reality, sometimes they need it worse &gt;&gt; than the one who is so lovable. &gt;&gt; Because that person is like a magnet. that lovable one, that personality, it just draws and people just love being around them and they just love they're they're so easy to love. Got anybody like that that you know of &gt;&gt; in your home? I mean in your house. You see what this is? The prophet says, "Were you ever around someone that you just love to be around?" And you had those people, what is it? It's become because of atmosphere that they create around them. And you've been nice people, but yet you couldn't &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; stand to be around them. Now, from this point on, everybody can take your hands and put on your face like this. And I will, too. and I'll finish the sermon with nobody looking at nobody. &gt;&gt; This is one thing, friends, I love I absolutely love about this message, the honesty of this prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. You've been in nice people, but yet you couldn't stand to be around them. It's their atmosphere. It's love. Love goes out deep. It does great things. And Jesus Christ is the love of God. Again, he says, "Now, did you ever see people, they were nice people, but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around?" So, he as he asks the question, then he answers it. So, you wonder why I do that sometimes? I'm following what the prophet did. Sure you have. Sure you have. You don't have nothing against them, but you can't stand to be around them. Then you've seen some person that's maybe a little old scrawny fella or a little woman bent over a wash tub, but you just love to be around that person. You just love them somehow. It's the atmosphere that they've got around them. The way they live, they create an atmosphere that you like to be into. That's lovely people to be with. Again, loving part. Now, do you realize being a son or daughter of God that you're a minor creator? Do you know you create the atmosphere that you live in? Do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in? Now remember all of us do this. It's totally unconscious to us every day. Every moment of the day we're pulsating. It's from the word that he used called dynamo. So it's a dynamo from within our being and we create this and we put it out. For some it's self-pity. For other it's it's anxiety and stress and they're just always so nervous and and you're perfectly fine that you get around them and next thing you know you're jerking and you're quivering and your lips are shaking and your fingers you know you think Lord have mercy. What in the world is the matter with me? It's because their dynamo was so strong they pulled you right into the dynamo of their own atmosphere and you become unnerved like them. And somebody said &gt;&gt; now he said do you know realize then that the atmosphere that you dwell in you influence somebody else what makes people act the way they do? What makes the drunks act like to be drunks? As my mother used to say the old proverb that I think it's southern here too. Birds of a feather flock together because they have things in common. As you live, so is your character mold you to what you are. Now, you've seen people that you just love to be around. Yet, they might not exactly be in your bracket of society. So, you're saying, well, by society and by how much we make and you know, these certain businessmen hang together and you know, these because of this and this. No, no. You see, atmosphere actually breaks over the brackets that we make. Come on &gt;&gt; now. Listen. Because the atmosphere itself prompt a person that is not trying to be a smart alec now are not trying to overpower others. Now you've seen people and you know as well as I do that when you get in their presence they are going to control somebody and that little gathering if it's the last thing they do before it's dismissed because it's something about them. They had this strong persona and they must conquer somebody while they're together. If it ain't nobody but a child or a helpless older man or woman or whatever it is, they will dominate somebody while they're gathered together. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Now notice he said yet maybe not exactly into your bracket of society and then they might be of a different &gt;&gt; race. Ah, so this goes beyond race, the color, the brown or the yellow, but there just something about that character that you just love to be in their presence because each person is a little dynamo of their own. Now, you know what a dynamo does, right? You know what a dynamo does? So, it generates. Now I can't explain the scientific ways of it but it it generates and it spins around and it's creating something. So they study it by velocity, gravitation, all kinds of things they use dynamos for and it spins out this something and it creates this element by which scientists are able to study relativity and all different kinds of things. And this is what each one of us have. Now there's sometimes there's people that's very misunderstood and that's the ones that are very very quiet. They're quiet and they have a hard time talking before people and they have a really hard time, you know, just being able to to express and they get around people and they get really really nervous. And then by them being so nervous, then it makes the other people they're around nervous and it makes it very hard for them to have very many friends. And yet people sometimes will look at that type of an individual and say, "I believe that person is just so stuck up. They are just so stuck up. They won't talk to nobody." And yet you and I can misjudge the dynamo that is reverberating from their personality because sometimes they can be similar and we're thinking they're stuck up when in reality they're just so nervous and they don't have confidence in their speech. And the more nervous they get and the more they try to talk, the more they mess up and then the more embarrassing it is for them. And then the next time they get around somebody else, they don't say anything at all cuz they're just so afraid that they're going to say something. And yet that dynamo within them is still spinning them and you get around them, you feel really uncomfortable and feel like you can't be yourself. &gt;&gt; Is there any of us here willing to try to help people when they get stuck in their dynamo &gt;&gt; to help them out of their hard times? Anybody here ever feel rejected or felt rejected in your life? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Me too. Most of my life. Even now, brother Donnie. Even now. It's not a good feeling, is it? &gt;&gt; It's not a pleasant feeling. Especially among your camaraderie. Now, you can understand from the world itself being alienated by them. Oh my. But God gives us the ability to be able to understand and look and say, "Okay, what would Jesus do if Jesus was here?" If Jesus was using my body, what would Jesus do to help me project an atmosphere that I can be able to reach out to people? Now, many times whenever I will have counseling after service, sometimes the only some people ever see me is whenever I'm out here preaching. And whenever you get under a certain anointing, I can't explain it to you, but other than this, when you get under the spirit of God, it will take over your body and it will use you in such a way. And you think that's my human makeup by the way the spirit of God is using it. And it ain't mine at all. I'm totally different from what you'll see because it ain't God anointing me. It's God anointing his gift. And then that'll take over. So sometimes whenever they'll come back in the office and they'll need a little bit of counseling, I can I can watch them. And I watch people and I study people and I I'll see their lips. If their lips are quivering a little bit and if they've got a handkerchief in their hand, I'll watch as they're going back and forth between their fingers or their leg is bouncing, their knee is bouncing or or they won't look at me in the face. Their eyes are going back and forth or up and down sometimes. And I will when I see that, I will try to say something to them to help them relax. I might even say something that's funny, you know, something like this. You can be calm, sister. I never have killed anybody yet. You know, I'm doing that for a reason. I'm not trying to be a jokester. I'm not trying to say something, but I can pick that up on them and see how they are. And then if I can get them calmed enough that I can pull them into my atmosphere to my atmosphere for them is I'm there to help them. Then if they can feel comfortable moving into that atmosphere and Carol can tell you that we have witnessed it thousands of times through the years. And she said, "Donnie, I wish so times, so many times I could write down what the spirit of God gives you." She said, "It was be so a blessing to people." And I feel the same way. Sometimes I'm sitting there, people asking me questions, I don't know a bit more the answer than the man in the moon, and all of a sudden in a split second, here will come the answer down. I feel like saying, "Pardon me while I go run for a minute." Because it was beyond my knowledge. It was beyond my understanding. But I've also seen it to where I would try to pull people into that environment and they sat there and they repelled against me, repelled against me, repelled against me. And the spirit of God that have questions, I got nothing from the Lord. I would try to say this and I'd stumble over the scripture and I'd stumble over the quotes and make the biggest mess ever was. You know why? because they were not receptive to the spirit of God. And we know that there's a right approach to every gift. That's the way God does. And if we as the children of God could understand, we have this dynamo. And that's why it does you good sometimes to break out of your little click that you're in when you feel like, well, you know what? When you Why do you stay in those clicks? Because you're comfortable. But sometimes it does us good to move out of our comfort zone to be able to reach out to others and say, "God, what could I do? Maybe that sister needs a friend. Maybe that young girl is feeling rejected and she doesn't doesn't feel like she's a part of the of the youth or whatever more." And God, it's amazing what God could do in our lives. You as children of God have the ability to create. &gt;&gt; Create. &gt;&gt; Now you can create anger. You can create temper. You can create turbulence, violence, fear, anxiety, nervousness. Why would any son or daughter of God want to create such hell? which is what that is. But remember, Satan loves human dynamos. &gt;&gt; And Christians can move under evil spirits. And that spirit will move over their being, capture their dynamo and start them in circulation to pulsate, to push out, to create. You know why? Demons cannot create. &gt;&gt; So they must use the works of a creator. Let's stand if you can get up. &gt;&gt; Wow. How many wants God to use your dynamo? &gt;&gt; Oh, forgive us, Lord. I wonder how many things friends in our walk with God that we've submitted our mouth, our attitude, our influence, all those sort of things. And instead of being an instrument that God could use, Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers." Do you ever notice there's no biatitude that said, "Blessed are the troublemakers." But Paul does tell us in the book of Romans, mark them &gt;&gt; which cause divisions among you. &gt;&gt; Mark &gt;&gt; divisions and contentions and have nothing to do with them. Mark them. And you realize if they don't get changed from that disposition, they will be marked by the power of the beast. Oh, patience. Give me more, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know some of you is absolutely scared death to even say that, ain't you? Because you've been going through so much stuff since I've been preaching this. But he's going to get you to you anyway. Will you ask for help or not? Look friends, whoever they are, whoever they are that leave this world as his bride, they will be so much like him that it will be in him in so much that the prophet could say she is him. Now, if you take 1 Corinthians 13, I challenge you to do it sometime. And when you go to reading about it and say, "Love is this. Love is gentle. Love is kind. Love is long-suffering. Love is love is love is." Leave love out just for this sample and put your name there and see how much out of that chapter that you can honestly say Donnie is patient. Donnie is kind. Praise the Lord. Don't you love him with all your hearts? Let's bow our heads if you would. Oh Jesus. No doubt every every believer here today [Music] has had the spirit of God to use you to where that he would give you a word for someone or an encouragement or a testimony or whatever and it just so lifted their heart and helps them. That's so awesome when God does that. We know. But then the downside is because of our human domino dynamo rather is accessible to both God and Satan. No doubt most of us could say, "Well, there's times to be honest that I got in the flesh and I wish I hadn't have said this and this and this to this person cuz I broke their spirit. I discouraged them. whatever it is that you done. You see, the spirit of God is wanting to so live in our soul that he brings our body, our spirit, our soul into complete control and total headship of the Lord Jesus. This will be the crowning of the bride in the last days. The finale of it will be your body changed back to a young man or young woman. But before you ever reach that, the spirit of God wants to control your spirit, imagination, conscience, memory, reason, affection, your flesh, see, taste, feel, smell, hear, the soul, self-will, all 11 of those elements to bring us under such control that we are a tabernacle of the living God. Not just Christians. Remember they were not called Christians at first. Jesus called them disciples. What is a disciple? One who can be disciplined by the teaching of the rabbi. That's a disciple. That's where we get our word discipline from. Disciplinary. All of that. The root word is disciple. Discipline. So that's where we get it. So Jesus wants disciples that can be disciplined. So they hear the word and they say, "Lord God, I want to measure up to that." Christians can hear the word and walk right out and say, "Huh, I ain't going to do that. He's crazy. You think I'm going to do that? I ain't giving that up." &gt;&gt; But a disciple can be disciplined. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us today can lift our hands before God and say, "Lord, remember me today, please. Lord Jesus, I raise both of my hands. Heavenly Father, I know that this type of a service is somber. It's a soularching service. And Lord, I pray you'd begin with me today. Not that I have priority over them, but to be the servant, to be the leader. I need to be right, Lord. If there's anything you see in me that displeases you, show me, Lord. There's anyone that I've harmed, anyone that I in the flesh have offended or wronged in any way with the hundreds of thousands of people that I've met over the years. Show me I'll make it right, Lord. Lord Jesus, I don't want to preach and do all kinds of different things in your name and to the kingdom of God and then stand before you that day and have great lacks in my life. I haven't been responsible for this, responsible for that. I didn't love right. I didn't have patience right. Father, I desire to be in your image, a son of God, a living image of the living God. And I'm not the only one here today, Lord. I believe there's hundreds of people here today that desire the same thing. But we say to you, be patient with us, Lord Jesus. Be patient with our message preachers the way you were with James and John. You see, we still have some that want to be the greatest. We still have some that you will use them and people will get healed in their meetings or they'll have great services and they just can't stand it. They have to brag about it and boast about it. Although they say they're giving testimony to you by the time they get done, we certainly have to wonder since they talk about themsel more than they did you. And Lord, if we're not careful, it's easy for us to judge and say, "Well, that person ain't got the Holy Ghost, and I ain't had nothing to do with them." We need patience. Lord, I pray that you'd help the youth here, Lord, and the adults, the young marriage, the singles. Lord God, be patient with us, Jesus. Only you know where patience runs into sfulness. And I know it can be a just a slight variation between the degrees, but give us wisdom to know, Lord. We want to be patient with our children. We want to be patient with our grandchildren. We want to be patient with our youth, but then we don't want to be to the spot to where we compromise and we think we're working under the virtue of patience when actually it's not patience at all. Satan is pulling one over on us. We need your help, Lord. Oh Jesus, help me, Father, as the pastor of the church. I don't know how much longer my life will be, how much more you'll have me to lead this flock, Lord, but how much every time I have, I want to lead them in the right way. I want to be the kind of man that I'll tell them the truth. Well, I know I can see it hurts them when I preach it and it tears me all to pieces. Carol would be a better witness of it than anybody else here. what kind of shape I get in on Monday. And I'll tell her, "Please don't leave me by myself today. Please, let's let's just get out and drive around. Let's do something." Because if I'm by myself today, it's going to be a bad day. Lord, it breaks my heart to have to preach hard and say sharp things, but I want to follow you, Jesus. I pray though it would be sharp that they can hear those sharp words from the love in my heart that I have for them. Mold us, Jesus. Take our deacon brothers, Lord. You know that they need a lot of patience dealing with your people. They have to put up with so many things, oh God, and so many things that they have to do. And Lord, then the brothers in the library and the brothers on the internet, they get one little glitch and people are calling from around the world and people are fussing and losing their temper and this and that because the internet messed up and people almost lose their religion sometimes whenever they break their signal, which expresses to me why they definitely need to be streaming if they lose their religion that quick. Help us all, Lord. to be more patient that we can add to our faith virtue to our virtue knowledge to our knowledge, oh God, these great attributes on and on and on until we are ready to leave this world. We worship you today, Father. Lord, we ask that you'd be mindful of Brother Larry Elliott today. you see got sick yesterday father before the wedding and we pray that you'd be with our brother had to spend the night in the hospital and Lord they're doing more tests and stuff on him today to try to figure out what happened be mindful of our brother Lord Carol and I left the the reception early yesterday to go to the hospital to visit brother Steve Nuome and his family there be mindful of our brother today Lord you see dear God that the doctors aren't given him much hope at all. But yet, Lord, we look beyond that and we're praying, heavenly father, that your mercy would be extended to our brother. Even now, we believe you can raise him up from that bed. But, Father, what we're concerned about and desiring and wanting is the will of God for our brother's life. We worship you today, Father. We love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Father. Harry, can we sing? I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Right now. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Can we just worship him just a little bit now? Let him let him just kind of take us up in his arms. You know, I've told you before about my two daughters, and they were natured, so different. Lis was so mildmannered and so easygoing. All I had to do basically to Lish was raise my voice and say Alicia Yavon. That's pretty much all it took. She never got a whole lot of spankings in her life. But now her baby sister, you see these five Parker people standing right over here? Every one of them's got the same look on their face cuz they knew that baby sister. And I had to wear her out, whip her over and over again. Daddy, how come you whip me? Why don't you whip Lish? I'll say you behave like Lish and you'll get less. Well, maybe there's some little Ericas in here today and your hide's been wore out spiritually by the word. You think, man alive, I'd like to go to church one service and not be preached on. Well, come on. Let that list come out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I can start just speaking to you lightly and say, "Little bride, straighten up." And y'all say, "Yes, yes, yes." Glory to God. Yes. Amen. But until you get there, little Erica, I'm going to do whatever I've got to do. &gt;&gt; Do I get weary after 37 years? I do. Do I get exhausted? I do. But I ain't giving up on you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I said I ain't giving up on you. And don't you give up on me cuz I'm a work in the making, too. Amen. We got we got a brother here that wants to be baptized today. He was rebapt He was baptized rather many years ago, but went down as many of us did in titles and he's wanting to be rebaptized today in the name of our Lord Jesus. But let us just worship a little bit now and just oh, just enter into his presence. Think about what what you've heard today. If you have to go back and listen to it two or three times, do that so you can be able to get it in your heart and realize what you are. Walk out of this building today knowing I am a creator as a son or daughter of God. God, help me to create the right things. I need you, Lord. Let's &gt;&gt; just close our eyes if you would. &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord, right now. [Music] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it time now, friends. &gt;&gt; I lift my hands. &gt;&gt; I lift my hands. bow my knee and worship at your throne. I need you Lord. I need you Lord right now with all your heart. Jesus, I need you all. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Need you right now. Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. Right now. [Music] I lift my hands, bow my knees, and worship at your throne. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. [Applause] [Music] as your bride. We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord, right now. We need you, Jesus. We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord, right now. Let your word live in us. We lift our hands. We bow our knees [Music] and worship at your throne. We need you Lord. We need you right now. Everybody on your heart. I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. I need you in my faith. I need you in my virtue. I need you in my knowledge, Lord. I do, Lord. Lord, I need you and my patience. Lord, I need you, my temperance. [Music] Hallelujah Lord. Father, we lift our hands and we bow our &gt;&gt; We bow our knees &gt;&gt; and we worship and your throne. We We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord. right now. [Music] We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord. Right now. Need you, Lord. We need you, Lord. Lord, right now we lift our hands, bow our knees and worship at your throne. We need you, Lord. Lord, we need you, Lord, right now. Oh, we [Music] Thank you, Lord. There you go. Praise the Lord. What a great honor to be able to stand and baptize according to the scripture. Imagine if Peter, Paul, the original apostles are standing here in this church today, how they would rejoice to see this great truth which they by the spirit of God were able to give to the church, knowing no doubt that it would be lost and be restored again in the last days. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for dealing with our brother. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus, to see him coming to the house of God and see him receiving of your word. We thank you for the work that you're doing in his life. No doubt, like all the rest of us, he needs a lot of work. But I believe you are so patient with your children. Now, Lord God, I pray for him today. Father, may the presence of God just be with him. Lord, I can baptize him in water correctly according to the scripture, but only you can fill every fiber of his being, Lord God, with your spirit. I pray you'd grant it to my brother today, Lord. Give him what he has need of to complete this journey in a way that's pleasing to you in Jesus name. Praise the Lord. God bless you, my brother. Such a privilege to be able to take you today in this watery grave. In the name of our bridegroom, I baptize you my brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. Amen. Certainly appreciate the word of the Lord this morning. Amen. Let's sing this little course as you're dismissed this morning. Shout to the Lord. Oh my Jesus, my savior. Lord, there is none like you. All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love. Oh my comfort, my shelter, tower of reuge and strength. Let every breath all that I am. Never cease to worship you. Shout to the Lord all the earth to sing. Power and majesty praise to the king. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. I sing for joy at the work of your hands. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. [Music] Oh my Jesus, my savior. Lord, there is none like you. All of my days I won't praise the wonders of your mighty love. Oh, you're my comfort, my shelter, tower of reuge and strength. Let every breath, all that I am never cease to worship you. Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty praise to the King. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. I'll sing for joy at the work of your hands. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. Oh, shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us sing. Power and majesty praise to the King. Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name. I sing for joy at the work of your hand. Forever I'll love you. Forever I'll stand. Nothing compares to the promise I have in you. Oh, shout to the Lord, all the earth. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music]
