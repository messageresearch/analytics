certainly we all can say to not we're not worthy of it are we certainly undeserving but he is so wonderful I had pretty much this weekend studied out to preach the direction that I was going to go and I'd Centro Michaels some pictures and some things that we was gonna look at but for those of you the others had sisters safe in his funeral last night a total little story I know shared again tonight with those who there wasn't there Tuesday morning I was awakened early before daylight and I just been praying that the Lord would give me the words to say that would be an encouragement to her family and something that would helps them and the Lord spoke three words to my heart and that was mercy walked in so that's what I spoke about last night and since Tuesday since that happened to me Tuesday I've I've just not been able to get over those words just that is you know it is sometimes the Lord just inspires your heart too so we've got a little bit of change tonight in the direction we're going to go we'll resume the heavens and the stars maybe next week for those of you that were in the funeral service last night you will hear a little bit of what you heard last night but it was a condensed watered-down shallow form that has to be said of course for people who don't understand what we understand but even at that he walked in a man his presence was certainly there so I want to speak to you tonight on mercy walked in Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light I mean I'd like to be remembered tonight as we pray over the word heavenly father we approach it and that was Thanksgiving in her hearts we're grateful Lord Jesus for all that you mean to us we thank you Lord for being so mindful of us our whole life thank you for visiting us and being with us and helping us Lord Jesus we again tonight need your help I know that we'll never be to where we don't need it and I know that that gives you reason and purpose of being you saw the hands of your children as they were uplifted Lord all of this place Lord there's so many that's sick and somebody that can't be here in church Lord you see all this flu and stomach stuff that's going on it's it's awful the Lord made your presence I pray just move for each one your God you see these cold days that we've had and Lord our brother Eugene Kennedy is setting out in the parking lot tonight Lord in his vehicle he's not able to be in church tonight it's not strong enough but he wanted to come and at least sit in the parking lot and last as long as he could and this cold may mercy walk it Lord God I pray Heavenly Father though our needs are many and great our God is greater than our needs we bring all these to you tonight Lord Jesus I sent here tonight I'm sure the most needy father God and a man to try to stand and speak the words of God the words of life what a notable task it is help me Jesus Lord I've been speaking since I was just an 18 year old boy but it still scares me and frightens me I think the older I get my dependency upon you it's great or and I feel less capable than I've ever felt in my life help me Jesus help me that I can get out of the way I'm a mercy walk-in speak to us tonight your word father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask the Saints said amen god bless you you may be seated I don't know exactly how cold it was the darkness must have been so dense and so thick there was no light no cosmic rays no sunshine that was able to penetrate the earth if there was a division between day and night darkness and leg I'm not sure that it was even where you could tell it because it's so covered the earth and it was so sick we know it hadn't always been this way but something had happened from verse 1 to verse 2 and had brought this change upon the earth so we know that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth period the Prophet said it could have been millions of years and then when we resumed that scripture we look in verse 2 and see that the earth was without form we know in Isaiah that he said he did not make the earth to be formless but he created it to be inhabited so something had happened in this pre-adamite world was it a domain that had been given to Lucifer and through his deceit and through his pride and arrogance the judgment of God had stricken it to such a place the scripture of course is silent but we know that God was not willing to let it stay in this kind of a place so mercy walked in mercy has many different ways by which the Almighty chooses to reveal mercy sometimes mercy is made manifest invisible signs and wonders sometimes it's actually veiled in humans sometimes it might come in something that would seem to be a negative saying but yet God's mercy whether it's revealed in mysterious form or in a very simplified form it'll always benefit those who receive it you and I certainly have to take Moses word huming the only one that was able to write about this instance quite this plain but we know enough about the character of God to see that mercy walked in my mind leaves from there and will move in time several thousand years after this instance of mercy we will move beyond the loneliness of man's primeval days on the earth will move past his time with God alone to his state after God had given him a helpmate and that helped meat being made inferior to him following the inclination of her flesh her reasoning her ability to sink and listening to the devil this man then must make a choice of what he will do the judgment of God could have justly come down to the Garden of Eden God could have once straight to the bush where Adam and Eve were hidden he could have come right behind the bush and pointed his finger and said I am going to destroy you you disobeyed my word you directly went opposite of what I told you Genesis 3:8 says and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called on the Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself o God what are you going to do this is your first son he's rebelled he's chosen his own way over your way his nature and this has now fallen he's going to blame you God for giving him this wife he will not even have a repentant attitude you know this already you know that he will not even admit to his full guilt you know what he has done he is not even not knowledgeable yet to know millions and millions of inhabitants on the earth yet even billions will suffer because of this decision what will you render to him oh just God Almighty 1 what will you render to this man because of this decision that he has made verse 21 tells us unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them why mercy walk did justice judgment righteousness all of that could have come he could have called them out from behind the bushes where they were hid in the naked state their trembling and shaking because they heard the voice of God and now their senses and let them know right and wrong and they were now in this state to where they felt so ashamed not so much the shame of their sin but ashamed other nakedness God could have walked down the garden with fiery eyes he would have want with gentlemen to execute judgment upon them but instead mercy mercy what if a friend I'll tell you tonight the more I look at it the more I realize the greatest times in my life and mercy has come my way it wasn't that I was worthy it wasn't that I deserved it really I deserved a whippin I deserved a rebuke I deserve something you understand what I'm saying God's mercy doesn't always come to us and we're so gentle and so kind and so sweet but when we need it most as when he does it best and it may be what others would saying all my I think of how that people have thrown us off and written us off and yet the mercy and the love of God goes beyond even sometimes when our friends would give to us and many times even what we would give ourselves you remember the story of David when the Prophet came to him and told him about how that the man had come in and wanted to feed his guests and he said well take his neighbor's lamb and feed him the righteous teaching of David the righteous thing that was in him said let this man die and the Prophet comes riding around and said you are the man all we know how that is we can stand on our righteousness when we think we're not to blame and we can pronounce judgment on this one and that one in the other one and sometimes we're just as long as they are only in different avenues but aren't you glad that God doesn't use your own mouth and shut you by the way you sometimes judge others but what does he do mercy will walk in and move upon your heart and forgive you even though you're not forgiving others in the days of Noah the world had got so horrible in the darkness and moved upon the face of the earth and the spiritual condition and moved upon the man to where God's Word said this in Genesis 66 it repented the Lord that had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them OMA but here is what God is going to do in the seperation between verse 7 and verse 8 but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord what happened before the flood came upon the earth mercy walked in to Noah's life and gave him a dispensation revelation that God was fixin to change the course of the world this time it was not mercy coming in the form of a man this time it was not God Himself walking in the form of theophany but it was mercy a man that come in the form of a revelation and that revelation was consistent was the Word of God for the hour in so much that the revelation was the Word of God for the hour and mercy walked in holliday a mercy walked in what may know it different from everybody else we know I'm reading about Noah even after the flood that Noah got out and got drunk truly nor was a man that was above the others but he had his problems I hope you can appreciate me tonight God's grace has called us out from Laodicea God's grace has filled us with the Holy Ghost God has opened our hearts to his word but we've still got our problems we've still got our humanity we've still got our shortcomings but what was it that brought God to us mercy walked in it was not because you were good I was good I was worthy it was because mercy came to us in a revelation of the last day of a message that the majority of the world has turned down and rejected [Applause] but mercy mercy walked in what I say walked in don't get in your mind that it's always a man on two legs sometimes it is but many times mercy comes in a mysterious form here the very thing that opened up Noah's hard to be quickened to receive what God was doing in that day not only Noah but the damned animals out there Noah couldn't speak camel language he couldn't speak donkey language he couldn't speak elephant language and giraffe language but the Spirit of God moved upon their hearts what was it while the Holy Ghost moving down through the garden or wherever they was out in the field and pulling out two cows and two giraffes and two monkeys and two baboon and two rhinoceros and whatever more what was it mercy walked in among them mercy of God can call on a dumb elephant can't God move on us dummies [Applause] hey man Genesis chapter 12 verse one would find a man by the name of Abram hallelujah raisin idolaters raise the heathen so god's in his father's god shop so history tells us now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing is he deserving is he worthy is he better than his father it is better than his brother is he better than other people around him mercy walk to him merci don't never get puffed up in your heart and think you're something great and you're something wonderful I don't care if you're a preacher if you're a gifted singer musician whatever you are it's the grace of God given to us mercy has walked into our hearts mercy has walked into this dispensation and open our understanding to be able to see and grasp and comprehend what billions of people will never have an inkling about oh my I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee will all families of the earth be blessed what was it that happened to this man mercy walked in mercy walked in oh my think of it now as him and Sarah they were all in there her womb was barren and his strength was gone in Genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre and he said in the tent door in the heat of the day amen and they were beyond childbearing they would be islands seem like the promise of God but mercy what is this hallelujah this time mercy I picked up a body down on the road God and two angels come right down the road and the prophet said he took them 16 elements and blew a body and an angel stepped into it and you blew another and he blew himself one what was it mercy walked into Abraham's tent Lord God children I hope you can understand tonight that same Lord God wants to walk light among us in this building that same Lord God will still walk right into the center of your life and take your troubles and your sickness and your holy let mercy walk in and have mercy Walsh in trouble we'll have to walk out in mercy won't say Amen shame disgrace in this hour we'll have to go [Applause] he lifts up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord my lord he saw three but he knew this only one my lord why mercy walked into his scent you can't hide God from the elect it makes no difference what for me manifests himself and they may stand around a little bit for a while and then they have to pray about it look at it but you cannot hide God from the elected come on children The Devil's house his best to keep God away from us but he will never do it that's right he cannot do it because we are part of God himself what was that that come up the tip that road that day and walked up the door mercy walked in mercy Abraham now did not need a tent revival Abraham did not need a good stirring up with a good convention of a bunch of singers he needed God in the flesh and it whatever you have neither that's what mercy will provide for your need oh praise God he said my lord if now I found favor in thy sight pass not I pray thee from that servant little little water I pray you be fetched can you imagine Abraham speaking to God theophany God and see often II in a human form he said God could you have lunch with me if you got enough time he could spare me a little lunch time where we get it he said y'all go ahead I've said I'll eat lunch with you well Lord we've got it what about a beef sandwich from some milk and Corey said that sounds good I'll eat it with Jenny bruh ham God eating a piece of cornbread God eating a steak sandwich God drinking milk out of the cow merci walk-in abrahan needed a little surge in his strength because God's fixin to change his body and mercy won't did little little water out throw you be fetched and wash your feet rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on and therefore or you come to your servant therefore you come to your servant I know you've come to eat with me you believe what you want tonight I don't think God's come to tickle our ears I don't think the world is you know we're Church on Saturday night and God something heaven somewhere no he's come here to eat with us he's come here to fellowship with us he's come here hallelujah table charts Wow no she's walked in this place tonight thank you Lord Jesus for there for her you come to your server and they said so do as that would have said first night and they send him where is Sarah my wife and he said the hole in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto the according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah to the matter of women therefore Sarah last was in herself but remember hood walked into the tent door mercy if had been judgment should have been dead right there had it been justice ship them dead rata come on church if judgment what it was the only thing that have come to us through this message many of us have been dead bird long time ago that's right if justice was the only thing that would have come with this mister brother Jim we wouldn't be alive in this place tonight but this message don't just bring justice and judgment it brings mercy it brings forgiveness it brings understanding it brings long-suffering it brings an understanding of an eternal law that he has for us that is not based upon conditions it's not based only of one your app it's just as good when you're up as when you are down it's just as strong and just as prevalent when you are in or whether you are Allah comes mercy Walt dead I'll send Marcie Walton [Applause] you imagine you'll imagine laughing at God Sarah lighter than herself sing actor I am whack so shall I have pleasure well my lord being old also on the Lord centered Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying so I'm sure it's a better child which mo sir anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return are the according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying god you're a liar you say how could she do that same way you did when God says he'll heal you but you say I'm not sure you're doing the same thing you're calling God a lot God said he'd never leave me but I feel like he has you're calling God a large wide Oh God kill you same reason he couldn't tell Sarah mouser walked in because you're deserving because the world it's because of who you're married [Music] [Applause] finally save Alleluia because it's who we marry our husband is our protector white backs would lift the direction of the prophet of God of the age his wife of course loved the world the things of the world Locke couldn't really control her she had a great influence on him Genesis 1915 when the morning Moroz the angels hasten Lord saying arise takes high wife and I two daughters which are here list I'll be consumed in the iniquity of Laodicea I mean of the city and while he lingered the men laid a hold upon his hand listen friends one walked in Sodom they depend on who you were you know how mercy walked in Sodom because a man upon the hill which had the Covenant he was standing merits an intercessor Lord God I hope you understand I'm fixing to say that mercy seat in heaven has never changed exactly it's always been in heaven but on the earth it changes locations well if it's a god it has changed locations from time to time from dispensation to dispensation come on Judith when the breach is opened up and manifesting can't you see why that God in the tight Esther became the mercy seat ain't you see that the bride called the names of your family call the names of your lost loved one pray for your children pray for your loved one it might be you Esther that God will hear the prayer through you you might be there merci [Applause] merci walked him to Sodom in the form of German I'm gonna bring it down past here angelic realm tonight so hope it don't shake but missus walked reject it miss and turn to what a pillar of salt why she rejected mercy and her husband had no covenant with God so God could kill his wife but God couldn't kill Abraham's wife well full mercy under the atonement of the Covenant was with Abraham humor what Abraham being a good man a great man a prophet of God but Abraham had his problems Abraham had his issues honey can be honest and I'd say I'm him and I get issues that's right Abraham lied about his wife when he goes down of course into the land it's Genesis chapter 20 verse 3 but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold behold Howard but a dead man for the woman Marcellus taken she is a man's wife but Abdul Malik had not come near to her and he said Lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this and God said unto Him in a dream yeah I know that thou did assist in the integrity of thy heart also was healthy from sinning against me therefore suffered are they not to touch her I thought restore the man his wife for he yes a prophet so a back slid profit has more sway with God than a righteous King which hasn't even done wrong come on take your hands and it'll help you get it then restores a man his wife for he is a proper how could that be mercy walked into Abraham's life and even when Abraham was wrong he's gonna pay for his wrong it ain't gonna say the cheering you're gonna do wrong and you buy with it cuz you're not but just because you do wrong does not mean that he loses his ownership of who you are Lord said if you could understand it mercy walked into your soul before you was ever a mortal being mercy walked into your name and wrote your name associated with him I'm the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world oh mercy done in time was connect what mercy depleted to you or give to you before the world ever began now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live you're a good hold on this man you're a good Methodist you're a good Baptist fella but I'll walk was this man I eat lunch with this guy whether not you like him mother not you say man he was one of God's picks [Applause] as far as a good man a man of integrity a man of honor a man of character a bit more equals a good man seemingly better bevel I didn't have the cabinet Massey had not walked into a Bimala soul and the dispensation of truths allied of God was on Abraham and even though Abraham wouldn't worry needed to be mercy never left him mercy walked in [Music] he shall pray for then thou shalt live if thou restore her not all your ties are your offerings or the churches you build all the preaching you do and everything else you do thou shalt surely die thou and all that are resigned so whether or not he lives is based upon height reached this prophet and his message why mercy walked into this man's life mercy walked in Abraham wasn't even looking for Abraham was not even asking for we didn't know how to ask for this brother Rob many of you was Baptist Methodist Pentecostal whatever you were and many of you were happy oh there was something down inside of you that longed for more but there was many of us that was happy where we were but there was some down inside of us that little Eagle of a seed it was reaching out it was screaming it was crying for something else what was it mercy walked into you and you took the breath of life you didn't even know God had mercy you didn't even know but when you took the breath of life that representation mercy walked into you [Applause] Abraham is on Mount Moriah his son is laying on the altar his hands are bound his feet are bound the knife is in his hand he's fixin to take his life within seconds it'll be finished but mercy walked in in the form of a ram genesis 22 11 in the age of the Lord called unto Him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham they said here am i Hani said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything of the humor now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou hast not withheld Dassin notice how the angel deals with it as if though brother David he went ahead and sacrificed him why because in his heart he did because seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son for me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his not his feet the horns in the church ages represent the church it was us who called Christ our Aries a ram in the thicket it was our knee our Dyer say that we were in clover the dog mercy after Jacob but soul and his brothers verse night deceived his blind daddy I imagine there must have been an element of feeling sad and feeling sorrow even if it wasn't just for being caught because Jacob at this time was certainly a rotten fella but election and walked into Jacob before Jacob knew this thing about election hang with me tonight election walked into you before you even believed in election election believed in you before it believed in it God believed in you before you believed in God God had a hold on you before you ever thought you got a whole ton God oh one day and I'm gonna hold him out rather than this any other woman said that's not even scriptural man don't even seek God as God seeking man notice in Genesis 28 10 and sheikha Pinal from Beersheba and one toward Haran is going now of course leaving his father's house to find a wife and he lied it upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the Sun was set and he took her the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down on the place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a letter set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it what was it mercy walked in to a deceiver a liar a man who had put on a costume and went in and deceived his blind daddy that he'll not be able to get the best luck oh brother Donnie he was going to get it that's right but it was never God's Way for him to get it that way I don't know what God would have done but it would have never been through deceit I believe he would have wound up with her somehow but the devil absolutely made him jump ahead of the program of God as he does us many times he'll try to get us ahead of the program of God and you imagine Jacob Devils is his entire life but instead of God leaving him there and say you rotten thing I don't want nothing to do with you I'll have nothing to deal with you mercy walked in in the form of a dream when God let down a ladder and he hooked the top part of that ladder up in heaven who was that ladder it was the Lamb of God and mercy won't ride into Jacobs dream mas I walked into Jacob sub-conscience mercy the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thou father and the god of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed verse 16 and Jacob await out of his sleep and said surely the capital L capital o capital R capital D is in this place mercy to a humble man to a man that was worthy to a man that was so kind and so gentle a man that had been so persecuted and man that had lived such a godly life come on children to a man that most people wouldn't even give him the time of day but mercy walked in because in this man was something that God could change you see we look at people and we judge them but to what they are today or what they've been for the last five or six years in you and I do not know within twenty minutes from now they could be a changed person think while all it takes his mercy to walk you and be able to strike and then the right way you think Jacob hadn't heard all this teacher I mentioned it to you when C not the Apostles had said under the very teaching of the Son of God himself but that teaching of the Son of God could not burst them along they knew they shouldn't lie they knew they should stand for him but the doctrine of the teaching of the Son of God could not keep their had had to be the Son of God in the form of the Holy Ghost living inside of their soul once that car had changed some forever he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God this is great what happened girl merci Jacob was gonna meet Esau Genesis 32 24 Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man was him until the breaking of the day what's coming what is set in the bushes see the shadows Jacob is scared not really certain what he saw was gonna do what's gonna be was response how is he going to trade him he said he saw he sees so sneaked up across the river there the forge a buck as he saw coming up to the bushes what is it now we are it not time something doesn't look scared out during the day you go there in the night and sounds and that sounds it's all more peculiar and strange to us your imagine him is this Aaron is out praying and he's going to ask God for help him and God to be merciful all the sudden something shaken the regress something moving I said he saw this house that you I'll take him for sending there trembling all of a sudden somebody reaches over and grabs a hold of him against him in a headlock Levi's daughter it wasn't he saw it was mercy glory to God a [Applause] saw it was mercy but mercy had to put the squeeze on him mercy had to work him over a little bit don't give up on your children don't give up on your husband but this time mercy come in like a sumo wrestler and grab the whole again lock it into British press 3:20 his arms that big around scrubby's old hair it might not have felt like mercy our Badger and the Jews did not feel like it was a tender hand of Jehovah when I comment and Stalin and muscle in he was doing what they were but you and I know it was the tender hand of Jehovah driving them back to what they needed to be how do you know sometimes when you get sick and afflicting you go through a terrible trial it's not the mercy of God letting something come upon you in order to bring out a character out of you that you yourself didn't even know that was there all I know we prefer all the healing and the signs and the miracle but I'm telling your friend those things sometimes mercy has to do this go to hurt us the wrestled and banlist him unto the breaking of the day you believe what you want I don't believe this man had wings I [Music] don't think Jacob but a very kay Dome of the sky brothers Jim if he reached up and grabbed ahold of a feather it was mercy in the form of a wrestler pretty good one at that and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollowly side and the Hollow Jacob Psalm was out of joint Jacob was a pretty good rafter himself as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakers and he said I will not I will not let thee go except thou bless me but this time he was convinced he wasn't from Japan but this time he was convinced he wasn't from the American wrestlers associations whoever this being was he had access to blessings and Jacob needed what he had hey man so now he's willing why was it mercy it won't be you see before he ever got blessed mercy had ministered an opening status to Jacob sighs and Jacob was able to see this being is more than a man what was that mercy walked in he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me verse 29 and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is if thou asked after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place Peniel for I have seen Jacob barely walked out you know what if you're stubborn and hard-headed and God has a hard time dating with you he may have to nearly break your leg break your neck break everything about your body you may have to climb out of here one of these day near broke to pieces but you can look at it with a ride to understanding mercy walked in mercy walked in I'm calling out but I'm a better man I'm a better man I'd rather crawl out by the mercy of God that walk out a proud man wind up going to hell come on Saint sometime God has to break our pride look at Paul what a man he was and he said you know all the things that he went through what was it because Paul's humanity still dealt without the Lord even allowing a thorn in the flesh to buffeting unless he should be exalted above measure if the tendency for arrogance is not there there's no need for God to ever let that be there what was it Paul began to recognize this thorn it's a mercy that walked into me if it had not been for that my flesh that have been exalted I would have got lifted up in the message can't you see sometimes God will let us be run down hated ridicule mercy walked into your life mercy walked into your life can I have a few moments that's good because today when the Lord started putting all this stuff together for me it was coming from every direction I was going back into eternity coming down through time wind up over in Revelation going back to Revelation chapter five going on back with Daniel I never had a message to come together in such explosive down on that value in my life I said Lord this is gonna be good not because I'm preaching because it's his word when Israel was down in the land of Egypt that's it is chapter 3 verse 1 Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father how the priests submitting and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush mercy walked in mercy walked in he had been silent for hundreds of years this gentleman is I thought Judy Garland 4 sacred hymn but mercy and what did he do mercy walked in a bush but when mercy walks out he'll not walk out by himself Lords of God a man may be looked and behold the bus farmer found the bush was not consumed the Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great shot what's mercy doing no Mercy's called it come and see come and see I don't now turn and see this great sight while the bush is not burned verse 8 now here the voice begins to talk to him out of the bush I am calm down mercy here is Mercy himself I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land into a good land and large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaan action they had touched in the Emirates and the parasites and the highlights and the jebusites now therefore behold a crowd the children of Israel is come unto me I've also seen the oppression look at the Egyptians press them come now therefore and I will send see mercy won't end Moses will tell Fabio never saw the pillar of fire we have no record that general versus all the pillar fire them means they saw it on the return back out in Horeb so who did they see in Egypt mercy mercy Moses God walked into the bush Moses walked out I am calm down Lord children I hope he didn't hear me or not I am calm down and I'm gonna send you so mercy walks into the pillar fired the pillar fire into the bush he walks out here comes Moses now you go you'd be my representation of mercy now Moses himself was not mercy Moses did not have mercy but Moses was a display of the mercy of God let me bring it on down and you're going to see where I'm going anyhow in the day that we're living in William Branham is not our mercy William Branham did not have mercy see but his coming to the earth was an advancement of God's mercy oh he was not mercy but he was a display of the mercy of God let me bring it on down a step further thirty years ago when the Lord sent a little video hillbilly from down in Kentucky Amen what was that mercy mercy when God laid somebody all on their heart to speak to you about the grace of God what was that mercy walked in I [Applause] didn't choke you too bad did it good now we're getting ready for the big staff I'm come down but I need your help come now therefore and I will simply unto Pharaoh that thou may bring us forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt can you go this with me so when Moses walks in among the camp of the Israelites were the words mercy go over that God is that Chucky when Moses walked in mercy walk why God City he was a gift of God's mercy people laugh at this message I laugh at Malachi for let him do whatever they want say whatever they want to us as believers we look at this prophet and his message as an outlet of God's mercy if not we could be a Pentecostal church tonight or a church across or a badness or whatever more while aren't with our mercy walk dear mercy walking what was it at that cabin that night only went on meant to pray I've come here to pray O God to get rid of all these evil things I don't want these around me and while I was down there praying a line appeared on the floor and a man stepped into the light about two hundred pearl olive colored skin is hair dark hanging down and said I've come to tell you a batch of could procure your birth I said so that's why I've come my brother Lou tell me this is of the devil you will be given three signs what was it mercy walked in brother Branham walked out Lord God Massey Walton and a young prophet of God walked out with a flame of fire in his heart [Applause] what was eight years ago when brother Calvin Ward sitting back I was in the hospital the doctor heard of giving him any hope of living at all and a heart attack but the Spirit of God anointed me now I walked in packing mercy in the few days Calvin what was it they got ahold to you when you was that I lost without God or what was it when you come up here with a sickness or disease and brother tale a hands on you or brother Daryl laid hands on you and you won't upset but mercy walked in and you walked out well ah God you may be in your tonight bound with oppression or whatever more but if mercy can walk in this place you can walk out them doors from the coal totally delivered by the power of God because mercy walked in and you can walk out help [Applause] the children of is have complained and griped numbers 21 five the people speak against God and against Moses wherefore if you brought us up out of Egypt to down the wilderness there's no bread neither is there any water our souls loveth this message this is my bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we've sinned we've spoken against the Lord and against thee pray until the Lord that he'll take away the Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for the people but sometimes prayer isn't enough mercy has to be revealed in a symbol and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a type of Christ you imagine what the devil must have thought when he was standing there that day and heard this mercy divine dispensation of Mercy given to the people of Israel and Satan thinking his man God what are you doing I am the type of the serpent I'm of always from the Garden of Eden on I'm always been identified as the serpent what are you doing God make the affari Serpent and settle upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it mercy will walk and he shall live oh how in the world can it be so you're out 500 yards or a quarter of a mile away from the camp and the serpent you final upon the fiery serpent poison venom then I'm never comin when you invite you to fill out firing up into your body and you've got to make a way you've got to get back to the camp the faster you run the faster your hearts pumping its pumping faster and faster and faster it's pumping more venom it's gonna make a circulations or your body but you're looking beyond that to the pulsation of faith my God is made away if I can get there and I can look on that pole I will be here why mercy walked in oh my lord but it wasn't just mercy that walked in that God wanted God wanted them to walk out God didn't just want me to preach this to you tonight so you can say boy that's a good sign God wanted mercy to walk in here and he wanted you to walk out heal he wanted you to walk out delivered [Applause] Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had been any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he is well so you're bitten on your hand your leg your foot whatever it was you're all swollen up the blood is running to the pain is so fierce it's just fury ating your body you can't stand it your mouth is so dry we'll just probably aspects of being bitten and you say your god I'm not gonna make of a son say yes I'm gonna make it why cause mercy walked in mercy walked in I don't understand what that symbol means I don't understand what I don't mean all I know is all I've got to do is look and belief what did they believe mercy walked in their camp and gave them a dispensation of mercy and a symbol if they could get there and believe they'd walk out heals let me have a few more minutes Moses is gone Joshua now is the leader yes a lot to contend with a lot to deal with how do you follow a man like Moses his tactics are going to be different as mannerisms are different way God's going to use him is different came to pass when Johnson was by Jericho he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn on his hand he didn't realize it yet but mercy walked him Just Cause mercy has a sword drone don't mean he's going to use it on you it may be going to night you with the sword his sword can be your courage and strength if you look at it in the right way but now you have to say this would be quite alarming so you're looking over against and you see this individual saying there looks like a man again no wings on his back so he doesn't look like an angel no feathers and none of that sort of thing but he looks over and this guy's got his sword drawn now listen what he said and he said he's so naughty Santa just shall win unto him and said unto Him or thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as a captain of the host of the capital L capital o capital R capital D a mine L calm guess what Mercy [Laughter] Mercy now walked in the camp oh brother dong did look like mercy ho yes it did this is the captain the Lord's host and he's not against you he's on your side Oh glory and Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto Him what saith my lord unto his servant mercy walked in and Joshua's fixing to walk out and the captain the Lord's host senator Joshua loosed a shoe from off that foot ah walking huh mercy walked in now he's gonna change his walk but it's gonna be a walk in humility you know yourself removing of the shoe in the Old Testament a sign of humility so now he's walked into the presence of Mercy in order to receive the full benefits of Mercy he's got to walk out in humility not in arrogance not in pride I've done this I've done that I'm angel of God I'm this and that on the other walk out of here Joshua in humility mercy walked in but you're gonna walk out changed Oh God can I go one more please and there happened to be predestinated seed in Jericho but she was a Gentile the dog there was no scriptures written about as far as what she knew because her identity was hidden the mystery of Christ which was hid in the heart of God but there was something pulling her even though there wasn't a written word I hope they don't stab me if Rahab could be pulled without a written promise Lord of Mercy these written promises ought to pull us over the top of ourselves these written promises are linear they pull us inside out this woman didn't even have a promise she didn't have a quote she didn't have a scripture she didn't have a bunch of tapes didn't have 1,100 some tapes to listen that she didn't have I said you know 35 let Sakurai's 612 she didn't have Psalm 69 12 she didn't have all these things that she could fall back hard all she had was a pulsation of something down inside of her that said you don't want I think mercy just walked into my house why would you say that mother darling notice what she asks for oh now there for a pray you swear unto me by the capital L capital o capital o capital T now when you get time sometime I'd like for you to sit down and do a study on this and then I want you to tell me how she being a Gentile knew this secret name of God who told her his name now this is not capital a little Oh little R little D this is the way Abraham knew him Jacob knew him this name was kept secret only among the elect oh there's the key swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness come to my father's house and give me oh she's a token believer lord have mercy oh my gosh oh there's a dog how does she know about this oh that she knows she didn't know she's gonna be my type and your type to talk about a token a message of the Exodus message a message of delivered a Gentile brownian to be part of the bride to which the seed of David would come to her give me a true token that she will save alive my father my mother my brother my sister's notice now the mercy seat in Jericho is now rehab but the mercy seat in heaven has not changed but the location on the earth look at it words that she's not even at you she's not even been a proselyte yet into the Jews face but what's she doing interceding for her father her mother ah blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy come on children it amazes me you know what people want to say we're so hard and we're so crazy there is more grace in this message than the bag does they even know anything about it there's more grace I'm talking about true grace there's more grace in this message and the Methodist the presbyterian once you really understand the program of God you understand we have our greater allotment and understanding of the grace of God than all these denominations put together they think we're cutting everybody out and cutting everybody out we understand Grace and a wider scope then all of them could ever be able to comprehend it look at her she knows that oysters for me I ain't worried about nobody else's me and me alone mercy won't there she walked out with mercy in her heart she walked out as being part of the mercy seat now she's gonna intercede for her family [Applause] my father my mother all my brothers my sisters and even all that they have [Music] and deliver our lives from death a woman woman what are you asking what are you staying here sound like to me you think the breach has been spammed between you and the Jews it sounds out to me that even though you're living in this Laodicean city of darkness something is struck or soul you think they should say oh just please save me if you'll do that that'll be pointed that'll be plenty she got such a baptism of the mercy of God that is spilled beyond her and she started asking for her daddy and her mom and her brothers and her sisters [Applause] and the man answered her that's where you get for yours you keep yours you lose it but if you'll give it up he'll give you his back in his place and he can never die if you add or not this our business it shall be when the Lord the Lord capital L capital o camp like everything has given us and then we will deal driving and truly I see mercy walked in she walked out everybody else's house is falling when Jericho is taking the walls are collapsing remember her house was up on top of the wall hers was the only one was special built-in message elevators now even though she might have been up on top and yet the scripture said the walls fell down flat hers in this case everybody else is cracking and reeling and calmer hers is going Wow mercy walked in she walked out don't you understand children tribulation is coming upon the heirs look at how shocked my good ones that look at the finest who came them how they're looking at don't you understand what that is it's a false hope because they're all my Trump stone this Trump's turn that is a false hope we know the money mark is going to follow that a stone but what's it going to do it's going to get a more drunk why are you are a part of it because mercy walked in and what are we waiting for to walk out with mercy [Applause] before this whole world falls before a bomb ever heads this way will be gone fare you well fare you well why because mercy walked in mercy won't you pull you out of that system and you're waiting now sometimes mercy walks in for salvation of the soul sometimes it walks in for a refreshing for healing for spiritual deliverance but don't never walk in without a divine purpose and call the Spirit of God from inside the ark called for Noah and his family to come in the ark mercy wall team Noah walked in was mercy and Noah walked back out to step out on the earth Oh Lord we have been called out of this world mercy has tread upon our hearts as it were the grace of God has opened our eyes we will walk out upon this earth one day when the atomic fire will cleanser and get it ready for the Miami as the Prophet says a question/answer 64 brotherly who was it that came out was Noah out of the ark those who win and they are quiz him oh you said brother don't you make it sound like you have to have this message to go on the rapture oh I'm sorry I'm just making it sound that way well let me make it more sure you ain't going in the rapture if you're alive in this day without this message oh I belong to a Baptist Church the Methodist Pentecostal Church they don't teach the message you've got to have a rapture message in order to be in a rapture and with no woman called except for the woman that Ellie's or was sent to and that was it you got to have this message to make a rapture France or you send the Baptist don't have mercy no no I'm not saying that at all but the allotment of mercy they got will let them say right here in tribulation and be judged the denominations the same way but you receive such a portion of mercy that the Lord God will not allow you to be here during the time of tribulation he loves you too much so one day when he leaves the mercy seat in heaven the corresponding part on the earth will begin to reflect the same thing he leaves the mercy seat it's time for you to leave here and whenever you leave mercy goes with you and the Gentile dispensation will be finished that's how much you are tied to the mercy seat of God so when you leave no more Gentiles will be saved then God will be dealing with Jews don't give up on your family now your prayers may be don't lonely ones that God hears that's right pray for him but mother don't know whether or not Brad hey friend you Mouse accept the fact all of our family ain't gonna be bribed no we can't make him bride only God does that that's not our choice that's his choice Abraham never did pray that lot would be a silver dollar like him but he just prayed that God would save him or have mercy on him and he was a saved penny but at least he was saved how was he saved through the intercession of Abraham praise God so if mercy has walked into you why don't you and mercy walk out and try to reach out an extending hand always marveled whenever I go out and preach in funerals and you have believers and unbelievers and make believers and all kinds of folks sitting there and I marvel I've preached funerals where there was hundreds and hundreds there police officers state troopers all kinds of people that was our celebrities and important people around the tri-cities area here and I marvel how the Spirit of God will lead you even in a direction to touch maybe a foolish virgins heart but you understand you have to be a surrendered vessel if you send up during your pride and arrogance bless God I'm only here to preach to the bride you're gonna miss many an opportunity maybe you could be a blessing to somebody as some came up to me life's not they sure didn't look like you all they sure what and Holderness looking but they come up and told me how blessed they were but what they heard I thought I sure would like to tell you some more of what I know but what was it mercy mercy extended to them and the way that they could receive it Oh Abraham seed let mercy be extended to you tonight what do you need healing oh I'm not sick No maybe you don't need it in your body maybe it's in your spirit can grudges own abilities and abilities rather to forgive can't put things behind you jealous or whatever more but mercy walk in and you and mercy walk out and you'll be healed touched delivered and we'd like to be remembered time before the Lord how many of you thank God - not for his word oh I they praise be to God let's just pray together Heavenly Father I know this has been very simple and I'm sure they are surprised the way I was surprised as you started overwhelming me with these things and just putting them together so fast that I could hardly keep up for support as I tried to lay down a little bit today and rest and I laid down on the couch downstairs and I couldn't even lay there I got up and put a fault down and then lay down again and got up and put another and down I'm so afraid I'd miss so I so afraid I'd miss a scripture quote that might be the very one that help wanted children tonight Lord God made me helpless you see each of our needs maybe there's some like Jacob they've not been so good maybe there's others Lord like Rahab maybe there's others Lord like David that got out of fellowship but let mercy walk after that prophet said whenever he prayed that prayer restore unto me the joy of our salvation he said David had lost his salvation but it lost his joy me mercy walk in if things have creeped in their lives lord help us out pray my mercy walk in Lord so we can walk out delivered praise God Lord I don't just pray for the visible audience but for those who've streamed tonight those who will go back and archive the service Lord Jesus may your presence I pray Lord may you come down among us your heart we're not going to tell you what to do and how to do it we're not going to tell you how to move we just want to tell you we're needy you see our needs or desires but mercy walk among us but mercy walk in and we'll walk out changed praise God praise God if you have a need to nap before the Lord nobody looking around please just slip your hand up just between you and the Lord don't have to tell your husband your wife your son your daughter sitting there near you just the Lord or did you see my need you see my need Lord I believe you directed brother Donnie this way to that father mercies walked in through the word tonight I want to walk out of here changed helped a different person I'm not worthy Lord I don't deserve it but mercy has walked in praise God thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight Lord God Oh blessed be your name father thank you for these simple simple stories and illustrations they've touched our hearts many of us since we heard him in some mystical yet Lord they're just as much alive tonight as they were when we heard him the first time 50 60 70 years ago because their trial praise God Oh hallelujah may mercy come in this place tonight in rewrite lives if there's a Rahab here who hasn't received the token may mercy walk through this place may she feel that quickening power glory be to God may she hang out the scarlet cord that's out of a window that the token is on display may mothers and fathers share tonight that had become disheartened because of children that have gone wayward from this truth Lord their hearts become so heavy and they begin to look at their own lives and wonder what have we done if we fail somehow have we done this or that why that they're not serving the Lord may mercy starts or hard tonight that they continue to call that daughter's name that son's name that husband that wife praise God they may be the mercy seat by which the token life will be displayed the call that person's name Lord Jesus help us I'm glad I don't know tonight father who's yours and who heart I'm glad I don't know when people cross the line I'm glad I don't know oh but Jesus we pray your to help us tonight to reach to those it's maybe so miserable Lord people we look at me think how in the world can God even deal with them but all it takes is mercy to walk in pray speak to God thank you Lord Jesus Lord Jesus we worship You Father thank you Lord as I mentioned it last night at the funeral thank you for mercy walking in to Stephanie's ratha Lord whether it was in a hospital or at home maybe after she'd been to visit the doctor I don't know exactly where it was but all I know is and Carol I walked into the hospital room to see or I could tell something had changed her she walked away from you Lord she treated you bad she hadn't done right she hadn't done what she's supposed to do some of the aisles of many no doubt they would have wrote her off but I
