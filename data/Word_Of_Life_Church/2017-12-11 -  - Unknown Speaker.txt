have church today y'all think you feel sad whenever you get a text or an email or you go to the website and say church has been canceled you ought to be in my situation here's to mourn the Lord woke me up about 2:30 started dealing with something about some of the things you're gonna hear this morning I got up as normal started study instead instead of pretty much all day as I normally do even after we cancel church I got so sad and so heavy and so depressed in my spirit I thought Who am I gonna tell this to I'm gonna blow up I know I'm weird I know that I've known that for at least the last five minutes I've known that I'm I love church friends I love the word I just don't you it's just this is not social to me it's it's my life I realized as we come into winter time we'll have to deal with these old snows and ice and whatever but I think I always just come together when we can Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse 9 the bride has gone out into the streets and after her delay of response to her Lord His mercy once again has been extended to her and he's fixing to find her while she's in this moment of slack and moment of being dilatory not responding to what he had asked and she tells the dollars of Jerusalem if you see my beloved tell him that I'm sick of love and verse 9 they respond back to her and say what is thy beloved more than more than another and beloved all thou fairest among women what is thy beloved again they say it more than another beloved that thou dost so charge us my beloved is white and ready the chiefest among ten thousand his head is as the most fine gold his locks are bushy and black as a raven his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters washed with milk and fitly said she does not see him as the wigged one who has come to bring judgment but she sees him as in his glorified body as it were when all the gray is gone his eyes are not a flame of fire coming to bring vengeance and judgment upon the earth but she sees the eyes of doves what does she see she sees not only her Lord but her lover I mean about to be remembered today in prayer before the Lord God bless you myself as well let's pray together Heavenly Father thank you so much that we could be able to have church today Lord how we're longing for that great day when all we'll be doing is having church would just be changed being your presence be there through the ceaseless ages never to leave again father Lord until that time arrives we keep pressing the battle the Lord we have many needs among us we have many folks that are in desperate situation Lord we're just asking Lord the Jesus it should be mindful of each one hundreds of hands worth lifted today no doubt the invisible audience there were as well we know that you Lord Jesus came to the earth that you might fully redeem us not just to save our soul but to bring peace and harmony there every aspect of our being the prey that should speak to us today from your word help me that I can get out of the way Lord anoint me joint two people maybe be able to leave here today and say did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way speak to us father we ask in Jesus name and the Saints said god bless you may be sitting there their terminology to him is something that all of us deal with every day of our life that is valium so they asked her what is your beloved more than so more than is a connection of two words which renders a value about which we decide if something is worth a price whenever you go to buy something to eat you'll do it here in a couple of hours you will set down with the restaurant you'll take the menu out and you'll look at it and you're called between maybe between chicken or pork or fish or beef and then you look at the beef and so I think I'll go with beef today well you look at a sirloin steak it's a certain amount you look at one that's a little better it's gonna be a little more depends on how much you want to spend and you will set there and you will evaluate that and think oh that's too much there's no allowable to pay that now there's no way you're going to convince me that a prime rib was the same price as a cheeseburger that most of us wouldn't eat it more often than what we do if you're going to convince me that a lobster tail is the same price as bubblegum I'm gonna call you a liar right out front because if we know that's not true the kind of car we drive the type of clothes that we wear type of shoes that we have most of our life is based upon these values of mores and so we look at how much they would want for a you know a steak dinner and it's say 1199 and then you could go on up and get one that's even better and even better a port a porterhouse or Delmonico or something like that and you say my goodness there ain't no way in the world I'm paying those 75 dollars for an old piece of meat I didn't want the whole hind leg I just wanted a little 8 ounce piece I ain't no way so what did you do you determined that it was not worth more than the amount that would you would have to shell out of your wallet or what you would have to put on a credit card so you decided that that sir was exactly what you wanted now you can act like it's what you wanted first choice if you want to but more Xan determines much of what we do in life now there's people here today I've driven some of you driven an hour and a half some of you a couple hours some three three and a half four hours you know there's there's many churches they passed on the way to church here today they could have stopped it many of those different churches but they determined and felt like that it was worse to driving farther because they would get more than they got by the church that was right down the road even though it was a church it had a preacher they had songs and might had a piano no Oregon but they felt like they would get more than that what they would get up there by driving a little farther you understand what I'm saying now whenever they ask this Shulamite the question of what is your it beloved more than another beloved they're placing to her the question of value the value of what is he more than other beloved's now they're not saying that he's the only one nor is she saying that he is the only one but she has this personal value was in herself that he is more valuable than anything else now you tell me how you love God and I'll look at the way you serve God and I'll tell you right quick ly on your consistency of that how you value truce how you value the Lord Jesus how you value the superior things of your life by what you give to them what you say really doesn't have much relevance its to what you really really do and how you react and how you respond now if you respond to the Lord and his word and you give him pretty much everything preeminence in your life not that that's the only thing that you do but he has the preeminence of that then to me I'm able to assume that that is the value that you determine his value is worth more than the things of the world you understand now whenever they are asked heard this very intimate question because they are overwhelmed by the way she has presented it to them now they've looked at her and they see that she's quite a notable woman she is quite unknowable person so now something is actually so happened to her being in His divine presence that it has changed her and increased her own value now by doing that she can do one of two things with that she can take that and allow that to be an element of pride which many people do they will allow the redemptive price for which it's been paid for them and they will turn it around in their mind and somehow assume that they are better than somebody else because the Lord Jesus paid this price for them and when you do you're on your way out you know he has increased our value but it was him that done it and not us because we're still worthless anyway as far as our humanity and there's nothing good about any of us false said there was nothing not any good at all than any of us and I'll say it for you the same way so we have no value other than the value what makes you and I so valuable is the value that he rendered by which he paid for us so if I had in my hands today say five drops of the literal blood of the Lord Jesus if his actual chemistry of the blood of the Lord Jesus we could prove it by DNA scientifically proven that it was a real chemistry the whole make up the creative blood of God never a blood that was ever like it never shall be again but it was a creative blood of God to flow through the humanity of the Lord Jesus and I could prove to you that it was the literal blood and yet I would say and I would say look at church would have gotten my hand today and y'all would set our oh my oh my brother don t be careful don't let it run down don't let it drop on the floor that in your body would step on it why because you would value that blood so much and probably we would tend to make an idol out of that blood because they sent wow that was so wonderful and it was and it was so great yet he valued you more than the chemistry of his own blood because he gave that for you now again keeping the value your clothes the value of what you're going to eat today the value of your house a value of your property the value of things that you do so we no matter what we say by our mouths our actions render the value of the qualities that are in our lives and people say oh I love God with all my heart I'll tell you what I love Church I love olive olive olive but just watch how they live and what they do and that will really tell you the price tag they have on it now no matter what they say you know words are cheap anybody say anything they want to but it's really the way that we live it's the same way with God now God could say I love you all so much and I feel so sorry for you and he could say that in heaven and do absolutely nothing about it we would question his his superiority of his judgment by saying he loved us so much and felt so sorry for us so what did he do he conned in sin to be kind of into a currency by which could be prayed or transferred to the value of us now there was no currency between divinity and humanity that would be able to pay our debt so God had to overhaul it God had to make our currency which would be accepted by God by man and where the devil would shut his mouth so there had to be a currency created by which justice would be met condemnation voice would be silenced and the innocent would be innocent for ever and ever and ever there was no currency that exists money gold silver trading whatever more barter no matter what you do there was no currency that exists to settle such a death so the great Elohim the Mighty One himself the Almighty he created a currency which would meet all three of these aspects and be able to resolve absolutely resolve our debt and free us from it and places so before him that even accuser would be dumbfounded he would make up Laos he would make up accusations but I'm going to come right down to your record is this clear it is whiter than the snow on our ground [Applause] because God developed a currency by which you could be bought as what the Redeemer is of course by which you would be bought back into the presence of God and the peace would be absolutely substantiated by the price that would be paid in so much that he would value you of a higher value than his own blood now humanly we might struggle with self and we would look at that and think my goodness you've got to be kinder the donee that we are worth more than his voice that's not me saying that that's him proving it about what he did understand his actions prove that he valued you more than he did his own blood more than he did his own life more than he did his own peace in his humanity because he gave that up for you so you were worth more than his blood so I ask you then if you really love him what should he be worth more than what if you really love him it's one simple word every same everything your pride your arrogance if need be you'll love him more than mama and daddy's and brothers and sister whatever more because that value that was paid for you once you or burst into the decibel of value once you are burst into that it brings an equation that God that we have should have had in the beginning but by pride were raised up to a spot people who think they're so high and so majestic and so wonderful they've never really been born again real no matter what they say because if you're born into the value of the costs of the blood it renders to you it takes away that element of the human pride and arrogance that we're all born with come on now priests women but yet and it brings you to a burst of humility humility is not just something that we put on and act like we're nobody and act like we're those you're not most have seen people like that and they said they're nobody there no count but we know they don't really mean that because they're not burst in humility by the value of the redemption but once you're burst into why would somebody preach the niccola's listen this is fresh right here Fred this ain't written down oh no no time and somebody hasn't either this morning but when we are burst into that it's not something that we have to try to put on it is the nature of our Birds and the Spirit of God brings in a natural humility about what's humanly we know we don't deserve in the first place but the way he looks at it we are worth more than his blood we are worth more than the price that he paid Oh does he have any regrets none whatsoever he'd do it all over again hey man I believe he'd do it for one myself that's exactly right now in that what does it do to her now that they see that there is a value in her then they are puzzled they're bewildered somewhat to say why would he mean so much to you what is the increase of his value and that you yourself are quite worthy now you're quite notable you've really been changed you're a different person that's inevitable that we can see that that you have been changed something has really really transformed you and you are so notable yourself why is he's so great but it is the rendered value by which he has paid for her that has increased her own value by divine revelation and she's not looking at it in herself and saying well I'm this I'm that the other I'm where I'm worth this and that not it is the value prayed that disbursed her in to the estimated value by which he gets her that she considered herself worth it today I was so lonely not she still looks and said I'm not worthy I'm not good enough and it never will be y1 that's borne of that you know what we'll have that until our body searches one of these days we're gonna walk up in the presence of God and the dollar signs and the values and the transcending of all that it'll totally be lifted and we would be birthed into a body that the element of unworthiness is no longer tired you bowing your head and feeling the shame and humble you think you're going to live for eternity in that kind of a party or that kind of a state I tell you here today you are not as long as this mortality is still bearing resemblance of that much Adam lost no doubt we will deal with it but when we get a body which matches our soul brother sister we will be elevated to that spot our soul desires this very day right now whenever they ask her what is your beloved more zan again the value she look they're looking at what she's give up for him what she's done for him and they can see that she has a greater than perspective than what they do now many people look at different things of life and people walk up on a Mercedes law and they say you know what I want that car well maybe man you'd be able to walk up on the Lama said what's a nice car but I think I'll go to the Volkswagen park I think I'll buy one over there why because out the value of the way will you look at it well a lot of folks look at church and the Lord Jesus the same way now they may want the kind of life in one way that you have they may want to walk with God so whenever you pray that God hears your prayer and answers your prayer but to give up what what they feel like they would have to give up they wouldn't consider it be worth more than you know they have to quit wearing this and looking like that in doing this and they can't say this no more and listen to this kind of music no more so they don't consider the trade all of the same so that other than oh no I don't want to be that way I can't live like that I respect him and you know they're okay and all that I don't have anything bad to say against them but to me it's not worse than Oh exactly now we've got to the price so we've got the price on side and then we put the value of all these things on the other side of the scale and then what do people do they consider the value and the cost of honest if this not worth it why would I want to come to church like here whenever you get burnt all the time and you get preach song and all that sort of thing when there's all kinds of churches will you go to and they smother you with butter and molasses and honey tell you how good y'all have sweets aha kinds y'all all of us is going to heaven in the first place it don't make no difference whether we live right or not well I know what I want to go to a church with a preacher preaches you visiting preachers Bernie up evangelist burn yet seem like every preacher that comes to this truth such on fire roshan then heats you alive and then sends you home and you come back for more than that service well you see some of you you come back repeatedly because you consider it worse more than more as an excess flesh you get in your will you consider the value of the word worse more than you going to a church so they're just gonna rub you on the head and Pat's you tell you how good you are now sweet chiming you know yeah in the first place but yeah you consider this I'm more value than you would by going to a church where they just rub you on the head so what do you do then you put that in one side of the cell you put the valve what you're getting on the other side and you say it totally outweighs it I am more than willing to go to a house of God where a pastor will preach to me the truth right other people look at the same thing and they say nope not me I couldn't handle a man like that I could not stand it so I'm going to another place of what they do that put the value of it one side and they put the word and the other psalmist said I can go to that church this is easy I've been there for six months he never preached something you better run like crazy if you've been to church three times in the last week you ain't got burnt I'll leave that church quick unless you showed up and they wouldn't have a meeting or something like that now that's that's understandable but if you go to the house of God you ain't preached on and you're living and Laodicea sorry rotten eggs I'm later to see his but there again it comes to value in the way that people look at now the Shulamite is being asked this great important question today she feels that the value of this question is so great that she's not sure that she should take it upon herself to be able to try to answer such a profound question it is a question which not only involves time but it goes beyond time as a matter of fact it goes further back than dinosaurs it goes further back than the geological ages of the Earth's past so she doesn't feel quite adequate to be able to answer this question simply based upon her Mirror emotional feelings that she would have for him though they are great but she would like your blessing and she would like your approval this morning to be able to answer this question from the word does she have your approval that she's going to answer with or without it but it's just nicer if y'all say yes what does your beloved mean more than another so if your Jesus greater more powerful than Allah is he what more can he do for you then a Muslim receives from his religion now we bring a know down in the Christianity so what does the message of the hour what would dis church this preacher this assembly give you more than a Baptist Church or a charismatic church or an apostolic church or a Church of God is there any difference really is there any difference is there any value that you would get more out of going to take the same amount of time to get up call me a hairbrush to take a shower you know all them sorts of things paint splatters lotions and whatever other people would do to be able to get ready take the same matter of time to tie your time same amount of time to put on your socks photos shoes they will come to the house of God so would you get any more out of coming to one place over another place and some of you drove for quite a ways is it going to be worse your value the amount of gas that it took the amount of effort that you had to put forth well that will depend upon the price and it'll depend upon what you get back in the place for the price paid right and then you're the one who will determine the value now we know how they are about value that we'll look at one thing people I wouldn't have that thing so now sir I bid fifty six thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars and you're cranking on say I want to see a first-class idiot they said that man bought

beginning and of course she's assuming light she's a woman so she came through so I'm gonna do it for Saint John 1 and 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now won't you notice how you've asked her about him not about them and her response is not poor ality she is not a trinitarian neither she to Lord she has one so in the beginning was the word now this is not Rhema but it is logos in the beginning was the logos and then of course she'd like to reiterate you verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his course on the only begotten of the father of course full of grace and truth that John goes on to say now what's in this Colossians chapter 1 verse 14 in whom we have redemption through his but not there his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created now if you want to know what value that he has what is he more's and Shintoism what is he more than Islam what is he more zan well this is where we're gonna get started all things were created by him [Applause] how many likes money God forgive all the rest these liars in the church today we need money I didn't ask you if you loved it I asked if you liked it we need it that money create all things do the stars have their origination can they trace it back to money what about pride arrogance education religiosity singing singing is wonderful we love singing going singing is wonderful music I love music but music never created all things what about your job what about your mama your daddy tell me what it is that you love most in this world that created all things well glory praise be to God no frizz this is the shopping season I say the shop will you the shop to a drop yeah the real shopping you don't understand everyday if you're alive you are shopping spiritually people go to church they are shopping they're looking for a deal they want to go to heaven all ma they want to get that with the least amount of resistance the least amount of trouble the least amount of praying they're looking for a heaven deal there are no heaven deals jesus said he was the way the truth of the life he come to him or you don't go far by him again it is singular not them we're all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for [Applause] [Music] pardon me can't you see why no time for you [Applause] he can create a flee a fire a net what is my beloved more than him he created all things all things in heaven all seams in the earth all things all principality all powers are created for him [Applause] listen to this I found this Adam Clarke was a theologian that lived many many hundreds of years ago mr. Modi said creation is the proper work of an infinite unlimited and unoriginal being possessed of all perfections in their highest degrees capable of knowing willing and working indefinitely unlimitedly and without control and as creation signifies the production of being were always absolute non-entity so it is necessarily implies that the create or acted off and from himself you see one of the difference between my Jesus and a lot of Christians Jesus is their Jesus is second-in-command he can't really make much of anything without his daddy's permission Papa can I do this Papa can I do that one that my Jesus is totally different than that my Jesus created All Saints [Applause] that's right he's more oh man he's more than enough for whatever I face in my life creation therefore is the work of him who is on originated infinite unlimited and eternal Jesus Christ is the creator of all things [Applause] therefore Jesus Christ must be according to the plain construction of the Apostles words truly and properly God as every effect depends upon its cause and cannot exist without it so creation which is an effect of the power and skill of the creator can only exist and be preserved by a continuance of that energy that first gave it being he didn't just make it and leave it like that all the stars are still upheld by his power the Sun the moon day night it's all kept by his power [Applause] now this man didn't live in Jeffersonville he was a Methodist born 1762 died 1832 this is the man age the man age when God was anointing the mind don't think you're the only ones that knows about God Colossians 1:17 and he is before all things and by him all things consist not just made by the field they still consider every sinner that got up today and started breathing the breath of her they owe that breath for the Almighty God [Applause] glory to God he upholds all things by the power of his word or as the scripture says the word of his power the stars in their constellation Orion Pleiades Arcturus they all have maintained their position by whom him who created it in the beginning he who set the pillars of the earth all glory to God Hebrews 1:1 God and sundry times and in divers manners spoken time pass under the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son but who notices whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's been the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power not the power of his word the word of his power when he had himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on her all glory to God now the chapter 2 verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man it became him for whom are all alpha Sophists are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons not sinners making them sons but bringing sons into glory banjo Tamara he shall save his people from their sins that was already his people before he came [Applause] that's my Jesus my Jesus is not what I hope somebody will be sir I hope somebody find out that in my beloved my beloved movie before the foundation the world [Applause] war it's a god not assistant obey the voice of the angel are not seen fit to we know the angel that read Moses was the angel of the Covenant which is Christ the Son of God or the logos that came out of God was the son of God now if you can find war two or three guy in the Godhead in the Old Testament then continuity should run truth that there be at least two or three in the new but if there's only one in the old since God didn't have a wife to have a baby by God produced the Sun out of his own being but it wasn't another person it was an extension of the original person himself now unlike our words the word of God is so different from ours because God's Word has substance it has traits it has characteristics it has power ours are fleeting changing so on and so on but not God's word in the beginning was the word but what was before the beginning it was of course the eternal so in the beginning was when God calmed in sin from eternity to give birth to a son but this son was not a human looking object by which God had come out of God's fear but it was the word or the logos it was not a man it was not an old man sitting up there and then out of the old man coming young man no it was a great eternal great white light and out of that great white like um a little white light which was the hope God it was God giving birth to a son that's a model as it is [Applause] the logos that came out of God was the son of God question answers on Genesis now notice until Wow I begin to see a little sacred light begin to form a little halo or something you can only see it by spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking the whole church or standing on a great banister and watching what God's doing and we get right down to the questions here and see how he brings it on no one has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called the Bible readers logos or the anointed or the anointing as I was going to say the part of God that began to develop into something so human beings could have a some type of an idea of what it was so it begin to develop out of the unseen tangible world into a tangible world where it would be physically seen he'll test varamyr when he comes from the invisible from that words cannot be seen to the visible to the tangible the tangible part is sonship [Applause] invisibility is the father visibility is the sonship God not to Lourdes the same God coming from the invisible rim 12 decibel Remini gives birth to himself [Applause] anybody see which wind of the devil went out of [Applause] the part of God that began to develop into something so human beings could have type of an idea of what it was oh please don't move your head poll tells of Zechariah chapter 5 verse 1 for we know if there's hearth they have said this time an uncle be dissolved we have a building of God not made me down sows you turn on the heavens eternal in the heavens if your theophany had a day it started it'll have a day inland unless of course it came from the invisibility into the visible and it was from the same eternal source that the logos came from so you couldn't say where did that it actually started it only Condon's sin from one form to another but it always was [Applause] it always one starts upon Jesus [Applause] now Jesus has not assigned the trash duty in heaven he's got to do the bad stuff and pick up after everybody he's the one who made everybody [Music] [Applause] can we go long I'm trying my best to be nice and y'all work y'all are doing really good from this point on I'm not sure it was a little like moving that was the Word of God now God gave him South birth which before there was every man Adam or air to make an Adam Jesus a glorify me Father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world you don't remember it nor do i but that one out of the eternal you come out with it John didn't say in the beginning was half the word a third of the word a tenth of the word but then the beginning was the word and if you'll ever be the word he was the word David notice in Hebrews how many remembers the teaching about the Godhead I went back and found God like the great rainbow with a different spirit how it was and then the logos went out of God which became the theophany and that was in the form of a man notice that the kind intention from the eternal as it comes into time that becomes more visible so God gives birth to a son and this form of the logo so why light that lighter becomes theophany look at his journey look at yourself comes from the eternal becomes the word later becomes a theophany that you often it then becomes a man in a man you come out of the eternal in the logos follow your siave they are waiting for you for we notice of the House of this Tabernacle Peter sob we have one already waiting I already raided why don't we like Farber the Dow when the theophany and the flash will become one [Applause] Moses in it passed by and the cleft of the rock then that theophany was absolutely made human flesh Christ so tell us Shulamite what is your Jesus different than a Baptist Jesus but Church of God Jesus oral a Church of Christ Jesus Lutheran unit area Presbyterian well my Jesus is not a third of the Godhead he is the Godhead in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead uh invisible becomes visible bodily Godhead invisible go

calls them all by their names he call us em all he tells the number and now on the known universe science is just a few months ago updated into others over 1 billion trillion that are in the visible universe and he calls them all the names at Jove red Johnny whatever [Applause] how can money compared to him how can pride compare to him how can the world compare to him they not even sure how many they are he made them all and told them all out there and knows how many of they are to the life's number and give them all a name if ever stars got a name you better believe you knows yours [Applause] [Music] Psalms 147 5 Christ is our Lord and of great power gives understanding it's infinite no one I love preachers I love great men of God I don't know a preacher yet that's ever made one star there's some great features in this message there's some great preachers this lived down through time sinky Calvin offs Feeny Paul James John Bartholomew brother Branham no matter who they are I don't know the one that ever made one star and threw it out there do you then why would I want to worship something that's inferior and trade off him who made every one of them and give him all money

don't understand some language I don't understand moon language I don't understand star language but I believe today they are praising me all night to the Sun somehow is his after penetrating and his ultraviolet rays are such in there somehow in the sun's language the Sun is praising the mighty God the moon when she comes out tonight she will be praising the mighty God when Pluto and Mars and Saturn and Eunice and all the trillions of stars come out tonight they will be praising the mighty God [Applause] can't you see what Satan down to the children of Israel once they come out in years actually got into their land they started worshipping the Sun the creation instead of the Creator why would you worship the Sun when you could worship Him who made many sons but its man's wife its man's lie so man will worship a gift to get around a pastor said preacher somewhere and Riley around the gift and follow the lover that gift and they fall in love with that more than they do the maker of the gift himself [Applause] praise Him Sun and Moon praise Him are you stars effect praise Him ye heavens of heavens and you waters that be above the heavens tell me how David knew there was water up there they didn't have the spaceships and stuff we've got today they didn't have telescopes so what we have today the anointing that was on David knew it without a telescope [Applause] notices let them praise the name of the Lord for he commanded and they were created not they commanded God the old man has already sent away saying maybe she'll make it worse you know what daddy that's a good idea if your same thing that I could help you do daddy I mean I'd be glad to but I know of course you you're the mighty God and I'm not I'm gonna I guess I'm not the mighty God I guess I guess I'm just a son I suppose and the Holy Ghost and here he's down below me his Thrones over here on the side if you need any help if there's anything that we can do just let us know I saw my beloved [Applause] my beloved look down through the circle of eternity and there was nobody there but God he was the only one [Applause] well the tribes of Indians years ago whenever we came to American took their place from them they called him the only one it was the white man who brought to them Christianity and divided up God he commanded and they were created out of what God didn't run down to Lowe's and Home Depot and Menards and buy up a bunch of Stardust in bags we went over to the the calcium aisle and the potash and the petroleum and the iron oxides and all these different things and God went to Lowe's and Home Depot and Randy's credit card up real high and come out there and had all this materials I'll take so much of this so much of that so much higher what the material come from all [Applause] and it didn't make him all the same he didn't make them all the same size remember the little nurse around we used to say when we were kids twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are up above well I don't wonder any longer my God made each one I'm within a certain element of a luminosity according to the gravitational pull inside of each one of these stars and the iron oxide and all that that they would have they would have a certain capacity to reflect more sunlight so he didn't make each one of them wear this exactly the same just like you don't preachers just like he don't Saints but he gives each one of a particular luminosity so that they're able to reflect the Sun because they don't have so we look at them and they sparkle and all mouths are so beautiful but what are they doing they're borrowing their life only to God relevant they do not have the ability our moon how beautiful she is but she is reflecting or bar-ilan it's the same with you and I the power of Christianity is reflected to us of the gospel of the Lord Jesus and he cast them about what what protractor what measuring tape is big enough to measure brother feel from one side of eternity to the other side did God use a square did God use a level that God use some type of great laser thing to be able to do it by his word [Applause] he has also established them forever never he has made a decree but shall not pass praise the Lord from the earth near dragons and all deeps glory to God this is not Jesus man is just now finding species and certain kinds of fish and creatures down in the depths of the ocean one reason is because they've never had the equipment to be able to go down in the depths of the sea because the deeper you go the more pressure is created on whatever vessel that you're in so now they're sending down robotic types of things that is built to withstand the pressure and they're finding all kinds of creatures down there that they never even knew was there but he knew they was there so then why should I make science my god when science still don't know hardly nothing why would I trade off education which is constantly changing why would I make education my god when it's constantly changing why not go to him who made it in the first place sure of your education sure thank God for what science will do until science goes contrary to the word [Applause] fire

earth of tilt on its axis and I saw job looked at that rat there and quoted that Bible can you imagine Adam looked at that when he come out whenever he come down and they even in the cool of the day

Ryan you're the one who made the Pleiades the seven sister you're the one who made the southern chambers the chambers of the south it is you it is you that's yours so you tell me you make money your idol can money by the belt of Orion can it make one your mama your daddy you get my point well what the world's a matter this bunch of crazy people then that we make all these other idols to put

than another I ain't got time to take it let's stand praise God praise God friends why would we put anything above him why would we make any idol then give it our utmost and our highest when he's the only one that deserves it Amen is this let me ask this question is this your Jesus this dis yo cheese have I described your husband who's yours some powerless weakling then they got enough power I'll tell you one thing that wasn't the Jesus Paul wrote about Paul said he created all things and I don't know that all things is created by him and for him whether they be principalities powers dominions or whatever they are the devil thinks he's something the devil ain't nothing gods have one who brought him in the beginning about creation he served God's purpose and the purpose is done he'll cease to exist that's my Jesus praise God praise God thank you Lord Lord I realize you are so great no wonder your prophet told us that if you had not condescended it would have blinded even the elected but thank you Lord for coming down to our level as we say condescension is such a great work as humans we think more of ascending ascending ascending it in gray or higher higher higher better better bigger bigger that's the way we think but to you condensation is such a great day for you to come into existence in the form of sonship it took an active condensation for you to come down to Abraham that day glory be to God and take up the body you spoke yourself a desk body and then two angels it was an act of condensation after you stepped out of that purpose and fulfill that mission you let that body go back to the dust of the earth and went right back and deteriorated into the elements when the logos became in human form he was on your way to gaining your first permanent human body glory to God the Prophet said it in future home this is my part of the earth and from this part I will redeem the rest of it but what was it an act of condensation when the Holy Ghost divided himself on the pillar of fire on the day of Pentecost an act of condensation Lord Jesus how great you are help us to move beyond our sinking of Great Great and stepping on people's heads to get higher and higher help us to realize that's the way the world sinks cosmos but our way up is down humility we love you Lord Jesus there was no one else like you though there be gods though there be idols though there's been religions Lord that had been down through the ages and Christianity certainly is not the only religion it's not the only one that claims their God did this and that and the other but were the only one with an open tomb we can plant back and say he was there in an act of condensation he condemned sin to death but he got up praise God who did our Jesus if the heavens praise you Lord right now the Sun is bright and so shining we can't even see the stars but they're still there but after a while on the Sun sets and it goes down as we call it then Lord the stars to start coming out Venus evening star which is the morning stars well she'll come out the first one to herald the night as she does the day then the others to start peeping out and they'll then express herself but even when we don't see them the praising you the worshipping men they have spun out in the universe for maybe millions of years glory to God how long is the Sun the great fireball been hanging there the moon glory be to God and we know bringing our son up next to the planet Betelgeuse it's like a head of a pen in comparison planets it's much larger much greater we get the son found favor in your eyes of all the trillions of stars in our universe there's one little speck of dust but you reflected by giving her a certain color that she had found heavenly favor you colored her in blue and blue is a heavenly God so when our space people go out and they point back and they take pictures of this planet what is her predominant color blue and they named her the blue planet her name is written in the Bible this is why she cannot be destroyed she is a redeemable attribute of God all glory to God our Lord Jesus if the Sun pressures on the moon how much more should we hear today Lord I'm not just talking about with volume and loudness necessarily but from her fear Dean Oh Lord God the only thing that's out of a cycle Pluto Mars Saturn Neptune Orion Pleiades all of them are in their original position it was only the planet that man was given his domain when the man fell the earth fell when will the Earth's come back when the man comes back even Lord Jesus your visit to the earth you did not bring Earth's for redemption back yet you purchased it but you did not bring it back because it was not just based on your acts alone it was based on yours revealed in us we can't hear it today but the earth the solar system is crying the earth is begging for redemption she's waiting for the sons of God to come to her place their place so she can get her place again then Lord God at the dawn of that seventh morning the Millennium was put on hold in the Garden of Eden for on the seventh day he rested but man called you out of your eaten your millennium so the millennium was put on hold it has been waiting and the cycle of God's great types this is wobbly do not go straight from the church ages into eternity the Millennium must be lived out glory to God Oh hallelujah Oh in the dawn of that seventh morning is the prophet called it when we will step out glory to God in the Millennium praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah who stepped out on the new earth after the end of moving destruction those who win in the ark was the prophet of God although there was other boats in that day but here's was the only one that was vindicated by God those that went in stepped out glory to God that's our Jesus we worship you today mighty God we do not worship you as the second person of some God here the second in command we worship you as the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace you who said you was the first in the last in the Old Testament it's the same one who said use the first and the last in the new not two first into lasts but the same one merged into time comes back out of time again and made his last first sin his first last earlier the Mady God the one in the Old Testament who said he was the Savior is the same one who record the voice in the New Testament that he
