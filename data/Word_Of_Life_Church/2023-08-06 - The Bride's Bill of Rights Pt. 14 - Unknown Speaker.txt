member of broken hearts he's the lifter up of those who are discouraged that's a reality we either believe him or we don't let us pray Heavenly Father there have been situations there have been individuals who have been brought to our attention who have needs great needs circumstances in their lives oh God but we've also heard testimonies of how you took a heart according to the doctor's reports according to their books according to their prognoses and all of these things that they know how to do and they're good at what they do Lord you took the little heart of this young baby and Lord you closed up every hole even the one that they say everybody has when they're born how does that happen other than you moving on the scene oh God we know you to be a reality we we we know you to be a very present help in the time of trouble so these needs as they call upon your name the name that's above every other name the name that stands when it is called demons themselves even tremble at that name Lord help us help these individuals that's with these needs understand the power that exists in the simple name of Jesus when that name is called something begins to happen I can't explain it I don't know how it all works but something happens when the saints call on the name of Jesus Christ there's power in our tongues there's power healing is already in our bodies oh God Deliverance is already within us so may we call you on the scene this day everything that said and done may it be For Your Glory and may you receive the preeminent spot in this place today Father everything

until you're going through it if we could sing like that whenever we've gone through trials wouldn't it be awesome would you stand up and just Let Her Fly most of us sit around like this why me Lord wowzy wowzy hmm but God's merciful to us in him one well to be thanking him every day for all the good that he's done every day we just kind of think well Lord when you're going to do this and when you're going to do that I've been waiting now for about 45 minutes I mean I prayed that prayer a while ago how long does it take you from the sound of us it's going to take a lot longer let us take a trip today what do you say let us walk into a room that is very very hot a room that is the temperature will be so excruciating that it'll be hard for you to breathe but what is going on in this room is going to be very essential and necessary for us to be what God wants us to be we're going to be looking into a great cauldron or a vat if you wish to call it that the temperature must be at least two thousand and twelve degrees for the process to begin go and go or is this getting too hot for you first Peter chapter 1 verse 6. we're in you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations that the trial of your face being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire may be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now listen what a compliment that Peter pays to those of us who've never seen him whom having not seen yet love in whom though now you see him not yet yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls praise God I may let you be remembered today as we pray heavenly father as we have our heads bowed in your presence Lord thank you for the service thus farther singing and the praise and the worship now we come to the breaking of the bread Lord we're praying that once again you would pass by this way and we would be able to see but the way the bread is broken that it was you who did it you have a marvelous way of doing that whether it's an African brother preaching or an Indian brother or whether it would be a brother from Europe different parts of the world but when the bread is broke it always has the signature about it if it's broken by you so we pray today that you take your word and break the bread of life to us that we can be helped by our gathering today Father I'm holding these prayer calls in my hands Lord and you see the needs your God desperate needs we're asking you that should move form father Lord I pray for Lance today you see dear God in the home in the bed and can't hardly move because of his back been bothering him for several days I pray in the name of Jesus that should move for him today father I want to thank you for giving Erica a good day yesterday she was able to get up and cook and clean some and do some things around the house we're just so grateful Lord God I told her last night this is only going to be one of many we're believing Lord God that you're going to completely turn it around and restore her father speak to us today Lord God In The Name of Jesus we ask and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated we certainly welcome each of you here today to the house of the Lord and let me call your attention back to verse 7. when Peter writes this and he says that the trial of your face being much more precious than gold now Peter didn't say that actually your face was more precious than God read it there if you'd like but he says the trial of your face isn't it amazing now we know that Faith there's no question about it but faith is more precious than gold but this is not the emphasis that Peter is placing on in this verse but he's making the comparison of faith and comparing it to Gold well how could that be well it's not just that Faith itself is compared to Gold but it's the transforming or the changing of the gold that Peter is comparing Faith to read it again with me that the trial of your face the trial of your face being much more precious than that of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire that it might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus Christ so the testing of our faith is worth more than gold but also worth more than the testing of gold now we know that there's been many many gold rushes down through time and there's something about gold man absolutely loves it no question about it he loves it and it is caused so many deaths and so much suffering and so many hardships if you've ever really looked at many of the gold rushes that have been down through time and you realize it was very few that ever got rich well who got rich in some cases more than anybody else was the guy who owned the general store because he jacked up everything that he had and a lot of people went there and they thought they was going to get rich and they left worse off than there were before they ever went and yet we know there's something about gold still to this day a lot of our Market is based upon the precious metals of the earth gold silver brass all kinds of things that are there and God puts him there he knew that man would use them but he also knew that man would abuse them so Peter is comparing and he wants the Saints then and us as well to see that as as worthy as gold was and during this time frame when Peter writes this uh gold was a great great thing and it's always been we know since man founded even the Book of Genesis before man ever started started mining gold the Bible mentions and God had Moses to write it down when he talked about the four rivers that come out of the Garden of Eden and he began to write to this one particular area and he mentioned it by name and he said the gold is great there so God even himself took note of this of what gold would actually be but when we're talking about spiritual goal of course it's a different thing it's not something you can go to a jewelry store and buy it's not something that you and I can mind it's not something that we can make but it's something that God starts molding in us and of course before it can be refined you first have to have something thing to begin with so when people find the ore and I've seen a little bit of it and and see little specks and little small pieces you know where they get it but yet it's not in its purest form whenever they go to digging it out now depending on how pure that you want to make it you can make it more pure and more pure but what actually does it is fire and temperature so you've got to run it through one process and then you let it cool and then you take it back again and then you're emptying more off and more on so Peter found a great parallel between gold and our face that is compared to it now ultimately says whenever you look at the natural gold of the earth it is absolutely and will one day be destroyed it will be annihilated all the metals of the earth that have such precious value now will one day one day rather be destroyed when the atomic bomb arms will bring this place almost to Total Annihilation there won't hardly be anything left but the Lord God will keep the frame and the frame will be refurbished now notice he says that gold no matter how valuable that it is that the trying of our face is even greater because gold can perish now you can bring it to a spot to where it can be destroyed it can be absolutely annihilating and gold being refined by fire is whenever the dross begins to rise now say it like this several years ago Carol and I stood in South Africa and we went to a gold mine and it was one that that pretty much mined everything out and what they were still doing is they was taking the the trailings of the of the great big piles of dirt now years and years ago they was only able to take out so much of the gold out of the trailings as they call it and but here's these humongous mounds of dirt and crushed up Stone but they found out that his man began to understand more about it that he could run that same dirt through another chemical process which has been highly refined and they were able to get more gold out of that pile of dirt they'd been Landing there some of it for a hundred years some of it for 110 years but yet running it through a different process they was able to take more and more gold so they had this pot of gold and it was setting over a molten fire it was fire that was so hot and the God that was standing there doing it there was a couple of them and they had to have these heat resistant suits in order to be able to work it because it would have burned their flesh totally off of their skeleton it was so hot so they had to be dressed in a certain way and then they would take and pour it inside of this pot now this particular gold had been used over and over and over and over and over again weeks on end and they bring people to that mine and show them the same thing over and over again and this particular Ore had been used multiple times and by the time we saw it it was about 99.9 percent pure but each time it was run through the process it was making it more pure more pure now it's beautiful as it was when it was taken out of the Earth but yet it had pyrite in it it had dirt in it it had other chemicals that had fool's gold which is pyrite and it had different things in it and in order to be able to bring the Purity out of the gold what they had to do was bring the temperature up higher and higher and higher in order to separate the impure from the pure so when the fire would get hot it would cause the impurities to begin to rise to the top now they would take then a little scoop of a thing I look like a little coupon of a thing and with a long on a Long Rod where it wouldn't burn them up and it would begin to rise to the top and they could take that off well then they would bring it a little bit higher and it would become more would come out and more would come out each one of those those dips was taking the impurities from the gold now the gold is able to take that type of heat but it takes that type of temperature to be able to separate the impure from the pure are you hearing me today now if God requires and God wants us to be broken as our brothers so beautifully sung the song if that's what it requires to make us to be like he wants us to be is it that really what we want in the bottom line now if if God could get us then and truly we have value in his eyes when he finds this as we are he found us lost he found us all muddled up in the sins of the world we had Fool's Gold we had dirt we had the office mess and stuff probably have very little goal in reality but we had enough that was worth running through the smelting process so God began to allow trials to happen now the dirt it doesn't take near as much heat near as much temperature so when we first got saved God started letting us be tried God turned the temperature up to about 50 degrees and boy we thought man alive I'm doing so good I'll tell you what I'm a sweating like I don't know what and I'm going through the test and the trial praise God and God reached down on there and got a little something out of you and said it over on the on the side and you said praise the Lord I'm on my way to canaan's land and God puts you in the furnace neck the week after that God to turn the temperature up to about a hundred and you sought glory to God I'm twice as strong as I was last week and truly you were and week after week trial after trial test after test God kept turning the temperature up it kept going higher and higher and your thoughts and your shortcomings and your impurities kept floating to the top now it takes the rising of the temperature in order to separate these things from yourself but you see those things are actually in the ground and molded in the ground but the gold was created now with iron ore with silver with many of the precious metals of the earth they've got a smelting process for each one it differs one to the other because of the chemical breakdown and the type the temperature that it takes to break it down but whenever it comes into the gold of God it's refined when the draw is removed now as I stood there and I looked at that and I watched that part of gold and whatever they'd put it over there and it was so hot and I moved as close as I could without being in danger because I've got boundaries around it because they don't want you to get hurt but as I looked at it myself I thought I've been there I've been there every child of God's been there and yet some of you maybe you're there today and maybe some of you just got out and God's got you over here in in the cooling Avenue of your walk as God now and God's given you a little bit of rest and he's kind of giving you a breather and he's helping you with good things I aren't we glad he does that to us we couldn't take it if you did in France but the mercy of God knows exactly where the breaking point is for each one of us and that's the way out of his Sovereign Grace that he does so then whenever a person's face now remember it's not you're shouting that's going to the fire and it's not even your emotion or you're jumping and we believe in all that do we not but yet it's not any of that that is actually being tried it's not even your ability to sing or not to sing it's not even your ability to memorize the word to quote the word no what Peter is focusing on is the trying or the testing of your faith now what's it for brother Donnie it's to prove to you and not so much to God because God done knows what you'll be when you come out but it's to prove to you the faith that you have now you see God will allow stress and pressure to come our way he will allow sometimes relationships things with people friends family church people God will allow a stirring of our relationships in order to let a little bit of unforgiveness or bitterness that we did not realize we had and God will turn that temperature up just a little bit in order to bring that out and you know what that'll do that will cause that unforgiving spirit that you have within you to rise to the top of your gold now I'll tell you one thing if you've never had any stress uh things to go along with relationships God bless you I'm praying for you because you're going to eventually like whether it's your mama and you or your daddy and you or your brothers and sisters or people you go to church with or your best friend or whoever we're going to have them that's just part of it does God keep those from us as his people he does not as a matter of fact God will let you go through more than anybody else in the world so stress will be able to deepen actually and strengthen a Christian's walk I know we don't want to hear these words but but it's the truth so in the words of job job said it this way in job 23 when he has tried me or tested me then I will come forth as gold now I'll put this up and I want you to read this with me on the process of how to refine gold so to refine gold he must be applied to force the impurities to the surface the impurities are called dross the temperature must reach 2 thousand one hundred and two degrees Fahrenheit oh Jesus now the sad part about it is God won't allow us to take this fireproof suit into the smelter so it's the people on the outside I mean that's the way it is the preachers sometimes they're standing up there with that fireproof suit on and they're burning you up ain't they I mean they are setting you on fire and they're smiling and laughing and having the biggest time ever was well he better not laugh much because he's fixing to go through the same thing so you see it's the people standing on the outside of that are the ones that are administering and they're doing the goal the very best thing that can be done for them so the temperature must reach 2102 degrees fahrenheit as the dross or the impurities rise they are removed and more heat is supplied now watch what happens whenever dirt will be able to be released I I didn't go into an in-depth study to find out the metallurgical value and what temperature that each thing can be released but let's just look at it this way and say that dirt can be released at say 750 degrees Fahrenheit so whenever seven if the goal reaches 750 degrees Fahrenheit and then the dirt comes out and said man I'm getting out of here whoa I can't take this no more I know if I'll go up to the top I know they'll set me free I know if I'll go to the top I'll get out of here do you realize that's the way a lot of folks do God and that's the way they do Church whenever difficulties come around the church what do some people do the first little trial they bail on you they jump out the first little test comes through and the church goes through a trying time and a testing time and people say I'm about ready to look for me in the other Church go ahead dirt go ahead you dirt bag go ahead you dross come on now somebody preach with me I don't know about you when it's all said and done I want to be left in the pot amen if God's got to keep cranking it up and cranking it up Lord you ain't running me off I've got good goals amen so we'll say them that the dirt begins to this metallurgical reaction begins to happen and the goal starts you know the goal is the gold is good now believe it or not the gold is good it says I like this I really enjoy this this is my spot this is where I am this is where I'm brought to my very best Clarity this is where I'm brought to what I really want to be now this is why our Humanity our makeup does not like trials because your flesh ain't gold Jesus Christ will never see himself in your human body right now the only way he will ever see himself when you are in a human body is the new one you get on the day of the change is that right now notice in when the temperature rises then we'll say the dirt releases first and the dirt will come up from the pot wherever it's coming from each one of those little things that sell inside the go it begins to release the dirt release the dirt release the dirt and the dirt will begin to come up to the top then the individual standing out there and it's got that little thing and you'll dip it over like this like a Little Dipper and you'll go to skimming around the top and he pours that dirt on the outside then no more is coming out because it's reached the max so they've got to crank it up a little more and then they'll they'll find floating up the top oh my goodness what's I see there oh wow what that looks like temper now I know there ain't nobody here ever been through that but I'll say for these sorry centers that stream these services so there comes a little temper up to the top of it and the man reaches in there and he grabs a hold to that he begins to skim that right off the top well they let it sit for a few more minutes no more temper raises so what do they do crank the temperature they go to crank and the temperature and then they let us sit there and sit there and have remember it's boiling it's a cooking it's a cooking that gold is just a cooking and ever to ever degree that they add to it that goal says come on I can take some more come on I can take some more the whole Glory but yet every impurity inside of there is screaming to get out the dirt wants out the temper wants out the intolerance the unforgiving spirit whatever it is it wants out and that ain't but half the story God wants it out now notice the process continues and continues and continuous heat is supplied and reapplied until the gold is pure the refiner knows the gold is pure when he looks into the gold and sees his clear reflection so then here the refiner is standing there and he got some dirt off the top it got some ironpara at all he got this all temper off anxiety stress worry materialism he began to keep on doing it over and over and then the man reaches over and he looks inside of there and he can see his own image in this pot of gold here it is it's now reached over 2 000 degrees and the gold is not screaming for Mercy the gold is not safe let me out let me out turn it down turn it down I can't take it no more the gold is in its Glory why because the refiner can see himself in the goal I wonder how clear you and I are reflecting the Lord Jesus today I wonder when he looks at us does he see just a very vague image not no doubt he sees a part of himself because he's done a great work in many of our Lives has he not so we don't want to belittle that but I wonder then by looking if he would be able to look at Donnie Reagan today and he would look at you and look at you and he would bend over into the pot would he see what would he see what do you see himself as such Clarity that he'd be able to see not my eyes but his would he be able to see not my facial features but his isn't that what we want more than anything in the world now you remember in the Bible when the Lord Jesus prayed for a man and he was actually blind and he prays for this man and whenever he does the man his eyes are partially touched and he says I see men as trees I see men as truth now it is strange that the Lord Jesus would have to pray for this man twice was it just that the man didn't have enough Faith to release it all at once or what was there a Divine Purpose to be honest with you I'm not sure but we can see that the work of God is a process so here the man he was not able to see men as they are but he looked out there brother Taylor and he saw men and they they looked real vague like he said man looked like trees sorta I I ca I can't make it out well I wonder if the Lord Jesus would be able to look in the vat of our life or the cupola of our life would he see us as people that love him people that want to go to heaven people that want to be right but that's not what he's looking for you see you'd be able to look in nearly every Church in this area today and he would find people that don't want to be lost he would be able to look and not say almost every Church in the whole state of Tennessee as far as even in the United States they was none of them probably went there today and so I'm going to church so I can go to hell I'm going to church so I can be deceived because I want to be lost nobody in the right mind would want that so they're going to church because they feel like they're going to get something there that will help them be ready for heaven probably everybody who doesn't go for that reason but we'll say the majority of them do so but he's not looking for those who just want to go to heaven because that's the old song says everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die and that's what we got to do is die to ourselves so if he was looking for that then he would look in the in the cupola of gold and he would say oh yes everybody in there nobody wants to be lost everybody in there wants to go to heaven everybody in there wants me to bless them oh they're wanting new cars they're wanting new homes and then preachers keep giving them the 13 principles of how to be a blessed man and the 14 principles of how to do this and the 19 principles on how to do that but he ain't just looking in the vet for that what he's looking for is to see himself himself and what every aspect of our life so when he was here he not only healed the sick and raised the dead but he also faced persecution he wants to see that in our lives so we are going to be persecuted that's part of being a child of God but what he wants to see is his image of behavior reflecting itself through us and our Behavior oh I heard the voice of God say an amazing thing this week absolutely overwhelmed me I was just alone praying talking to the Lord and I heard him say these three things walk like a prince roar like a lion and fight like a king wow walk like a prince roar like a lion and fight like a king so guess what that's what I'm going to do so God wants to see himself when we fight he wants to see himself whenever we're being under oppression of the enemy and persecuted so he's looking for himself in every aspect of our life and that is what this separates of course the bride from the church because the church wants simply a ticket to Heaven no requirement you don't have to do anything you don't have to dress a certain way behave a certain way and do whatever you want to do oh sure that's what they think Heaven's all about it's just to get everybody out of this place it fits that way in six weeks heaven will be turned back into a shape like Johnson City in no time won't it it won't be a fit place for a child of God to live so the refiner wants to be able to look over into the cupola of gold and to be able to see his own reflection now Malachi 3 tells us this but who may have died in the day of his coming who shall stand when he appears for he is like a Refiner's Fire a refiners fire like Fuller's Soap he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness so God works a similar process in the life of his people that a man would in refining go now you see what this goal will do is when the temperature begins to rise and it begins to release things that's actually become a part of it through the process of Creation in the earth now the gold didn't ask for the dirt the gold didn't ask for the Fool's Gold but it was actually formed there in the creation of the world the earth and the temperature begins to rise and it forces the gold to release this part that is not itself listen to me if you're a child of God adultery is not who you are if you're a child of God pornography is not who you are lying cheating drinking so on and so on that is not who you are somebody say Amen so what does God want God wants to be able to release that out of you so the real you can shine through so it will it will expose our weaknesses it will expose our faults oh goodness we none of us like that do we you're like yeah brother Brown told us he said the reason we go to church is to see our faults oh my goodness how many goals to church they can be preached on why did y'all even come today we go through trials so we can see what we are lacking what we need oh my notices so it exposes our weaknesses our faults our struggles our impurities do that when the heed is turned up and when the heat gets hot it is very uncomfortable in it oh my goodness I'll see some of y'all saying here and I know what phase of life you're in according to kind of how you're reacting in the service some of you is wrapped up in thermal blankets some of you are sitting there sweating which lets me know where you are in the cycle of life and so each one of us were able to go through these different things but myself I I can be able to tolerate heat better than I can cold now I've been to Canada and it's 40 minus 40. and whenever I get done preaching I was soaking wet and they would pull the the vehicle right up to the door I basically stepped out of the church door and the car was right there because there's a freedom that's afraid I'd freeze to death because of being so cold and yet then people stand outside with a long sister stand there with a long sweater hanging down like this minus 40 standing out there talking like you folks here would in 70 or 75. yeah their blood is like molasses so they're used to it they're used to it they can stand there and do it I don't like that kind of weather God never made that place for me polar bears and all that sort of thing they can have it as far as I'm concerned I can deal with heat a lot better but it's the same way when it comes to our flesh and our soul whenever the pressure goes to be turned on our flesh oh we'll cry and belly ache oh I didn't think Christianity is going to be like this I didn't know it was going to be so hard to go through that and the flesh will go on and on and on and the soul is saying Lord Purify Me Lord cleanse me Lord sanctify me and if your body could hear your soul you talking about getting into an argument they'd go back and believe you please shut up your ass can God to turn up the temperature and I'm about to die this heat is absolutely killing me exactly the idea exactly the idea that God wants to do so the process our process you say when will this ever end I'll tell you when it ends this process will end when we meet Jesus face to face now think of this every one of us are going to see him you're either going to be ready or not ready it's up to you but the process for the bride will end when we meet him face to face and he will be able to look directly in our face for the first time without a veil or a covering of the blood and when he looks in our face we will be so much like him he will be able to see himself in US it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him is that right is that what the word says for we shall see him as he is I don't want to add to what John said but there's also another side to that and he will see us as we is that's exactly right we're going to see him as he is and he's going to see us as he has processed us to be through all these things of life oh you know in one way I'm so glad that God hasn't made it to where that it didn't require a real difficult type of process I'm glad that he's made it this way because it truly separates those that really want to go from those that really don't want to go so you see purification may sound harsh and the process may seem very difficult he said well brother Donnie how long does this take depends on you it depends on how much junk you got in you it depends on how much trash how much Fool's Gold how much dirt how much Humanity well thank you Jesus it all depends on you and I and how quick we will allow God to take it out of our lives so without this process we will be left with our impurities we will be left you see this is why that they cannot make out that number that goes through the tribulation period now if these people are actually under the blood how in the world could they ever go into a tribulation period for purification but they think they're under the blood but in reality they are not they refuse the process to be cleansed ready for the Rapture now we know that's being saved and the Rapture is not the same thing she'll be gets saved by accepting him as our savior but in order to go on the body change we've got to be called out separated called out away from the world and this process is part of it and many people simply do not want it they don't not want to be told they have to separate from the world well you can't do this and you can't do that no more and you can't I ain't no purchase are telling me what to do bless God it ain't the preacher telling you no way it's the preacher only repeating the requirement for the Rapture I thought you wanted to go so you see the process takes out all of these impurities and the dross that's inside of us so you know God may allow them a a relationship a friend of yours or or a brother even in the flesh or a sister in the flesh and struggles May raise up and what will it do it will try you in a way that you've never been tried before and then if you've got the least bit of bitterness or an unforgiving Spirit down inside mixed with your gold and now of course every one of us are totally convinced that we are 14 karat through and through from the toenail to the top of our last little head right up on our head we are all 14 karat gold there's no question about that right I'm talking about our character our makeup by even our family is 14 karat that's why some of you think your kids are a bunch of angels around here and you don't even correct them well praise the Lord Brother Donnie you don't pass the new birth on to your kids well they don't pass a new birth on our kids by having Sunday school class or by preaching is that right they've got to get it theirself and they've got to be purified just like you and I are purified but we want to wind up the goals of God he's going to gather his treasures one day you see he's gone there to prepare a great beautiful place now those of you especially you sisters and you're saying you you think about getting engaged or some of you sisters that's already engaged and married and you get your eyes on a new ring and you go say well glory to God my husband's making more money now than he's ever made before and he got me this little ring whenever we got married and I love this little thing I really do but I wouldn't care to have something a little bit bigger say three-quarter or 1.1 or 1.3 or something like that and I wouldn't mind you know having the clarity a little bit better the four C's I wouldn't care to have the color just a little bit brighter mine is a j and I'd rather have something a little bit brighter I'd rather have the clarity a little bit and I'd rather have not any inclusion something but Diamonds the way they chart diamonds you understand that mine is an s i one and I'd rather not have that I'd rather just have you know just no inclusions and all to and I I'm not you know and whenever you go to the jewelry store and you talk to your husband said honey let's go into the mall and let's get one of them pretzels you like them pretzels don't you down there tomorrow oh I like them pretzels well let's go down there and he's just as gullible as he can be poor old Feller he don't realize that the jewelry stores right across the hallway there from the Pretzel store hey you ain't got no pretzels on your mind sister you got that big rock playing inside of that have you ever noticed and them jewelry case us how they've got them all lit up have you ever noticed whenever you walk in there I mean ever Sparkle is there I see some of y'all smiling you've done been there done that ain't you and they've got that thing laid up and as soon as they take it out and you put it on your finger but they also got some behind you but I'll tell you what you do you walk out of there into the mall itself and just get under the regular lights and what you're going to notice is a lot of that sparkle is no longer there now the Sparkle is still there but the light is not hitting it in the right way so myself whenever I bought a few of those things in the past and I go in there if I don't happen to have one in my pocket which I don't carry one around I will ask for a Jeweler's loop I mean that's what that is some of y'all know what it is I won't ask for a Jeweler's loot or whenever you do that always impresses them and say oh this old boy knows what he's talking about so I get a Jeweler's Loop and I put it up on my eye like this and I'll start doing the ring this way or whatever it is I'm looking at but calls us a certain distance that you want to get it from the loop to be able to bring out everything that's in it the fire well you see the the natural eye looks at him there's oh it's got maybe it's got two or three inclusions and the color is a is a g and it looks pretty pretty nice but when you go to pulling that Loop up and you go to looking at that ring this way and you find exactly the distance then you say oh my goodness there's that inclusion how is that well that was formed when God made it in the beginning it's carbon is all it is and it's a little bitty thing that's hidden until you get this little Jeweler's Loop now we love preaching long distance don't we preacher preach on me tell me tell me how good I am some of y'all rather I'd be plumbed back younger with you you'd rather I'd be way back maybe he'd rather I was out on the parking lot and preach to you but the Lord by the Holy Ghost will have a man of God anointed by the spirit of God and he's got a Jeweler's Loop and another and then another Lord have Mercy's got a pair of binocular it looks like and say Lord how'd that man know what we was talking about this morning at The Breakfast Table he didn't but the master does so what does it do it brings out our flaws it brings out our carbon our humanity and then God does it not to shame us God does that not to humiliate us God does that to bring it out so we can see what's there and then we can say okay I understand Lord while the temperature's been going up has the temperature been going up on any on your trials and your test of Life I'll tell you one thing it seems like every way you look and everybody you talk to has gone through something is that right and it seemed like the closer we get to the end of the way the more it is it must be going home time it must be going home time and he's cranking and cranking and cranking in order to let all the impurities to be able to boil to the top oh my goodness well I know we ain't going to be standing in line today to see who can be able to be cranked up first but I do want to be in line I don't want God to have to Baby me I don't want God to have to treat me like I'm a little old pansy sort of a fellow well I can't let Donnie go through much poor little Feller he's so weak you know he'll just get all broke down and everything that ain't what I want my reputation to be I'm not the first one today look and be thrown in the fire guarantee you that but if God in his wisdom allows me to go there I'm going to act like a prince I'm going to roar like a lion and I'm going to fight like a king oh man you see God wants us to be able to have peace in the time of such trials when they're going on so God is refining and removing the dross in our lives so we can be vassals for his glory now listen what the prophet said I was standing here not long ago by a big smelter and I noticed how hot that fire was and it just cooked and cooked and cooked now you can tell this is not smells or language what he's talking about but this is the best way he knew to describe it so we're standing there looking at that smelter and and it was just boiling apparently some bubbling and stuff coming out of it like that it cooked and cooked and cooked as a hotter it got and the dross and the metals and the gold he said to come to the top and they skimmed it off and that heat the fire a little hotter in this smelter and then they would make it boil more now a lot of us boil as a matter of fact some of us boil over but it's the kind that don't do us no good we get all anger and all upset and bowl over and lose our temper and then you got to go back and repent for something that you said you shouldn't have said preach brother Donnie but this ain't the kind of boiling that God does when God boils you he does a good job that's right that heat the fire a little hotter in the smelter and then it would boil more and that gets some more different stuff pyrite stuff out of it the first come up was the dirt like dirt and mud the necks come up and say oh I don't know something some quick notice what he calls this some quick silver quick silver that's what a lot of folks want man and they want to get saved tonight they want to preach tomorrow they're ready to pasture Church in three weeks they're ready to go on a singing to her Evangelistic touring missionary tour in about a month they want Quicksilver that only worked for Tom Toad and The Lone Ranger it won't work for you as a child of God God wants rid of quicksilver God wants rid of dirt oh my they come up and skim that off what it went right on down and the last thing they took out of it was pyrite that's Fool's Gold you know there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another ah now we're coming to Fool's goal there's a lot of things in people that try to fool one another when you're a Christian or acting like it anyhow but you let that Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything out and it takes all the fool's gold out of you you see there's no room for foolish virgin gold and the bride I don't want no Fool's Gold any y'all ever seen pyrite so many of you have so your wives you know what it is and yet there's been many a person that thought they struck it rich when they were digging in the hills of Arizona or Nevada or Utah or California or even in Alaska and they thought they had hit the mother lode but what they got was absolutely worthless notice he said you let the Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything out and takes all the fools gold out of you fools go many people go out west and they find some of it and they think they struck a gold mine it shines better than gold does but it's Fool's goal hasn't got no value to it look for him this is where a Leo to see is hidden laodicea is full of Fool's Gold and they look at their lives and they look at their churches and they look at their jobs and this and that and the other God blesses us don't boy that means he approves of us no it does no such a thing it does no such a thing the children of Israel they have been judged by God and said you'll not go into the land yet they never had to provide their food they never had to buy another pair of shoes never had to buy another change of clothes God blessed them so much and there was already pronounced they was lost don't judge blessings and say well that's God's approval here's God's approval of you God tries you and tests you oh God gives me a new car every now and then God does this God does that well he gives the Sinners their breasts he gives infidels they woke up today and say there is no God and God gave them the Breath of Life God gave them the right mind God gave them food to eat though they never thank him but the whole earth is living under the blessing of God is that right I don't want just His blessings I want this oh my notice dear Jesus it shines better than gold does but it's Fool's Gold hasn't gotten no value to it and now they cook that and they skim it all off and they just keep cooking and cooking it until it's pure gold boil down to nothing but 100 goal and that's the way God does in his church he pours the holy spirit in it and Cooks down here we go Church how many is ready for a cookout y'all invited to Word of Life Church every service we plan on having a cut down well you're serving brother Donnie elk bison you you're what's on the Fire and I'm on the fire with you oh my goodness well praise the lord well that's a sure way to build up her church right we will gain all kinds of people yeah you got to be kidding me people don't want to be cut down notice he says oh Lord till it throws all the worldliness and the differences and selfishness till it just boils it out of every individual that will come to him look at this on the latest in church but there is a gold of God First Peter 1 7 but there is this goal watch this goal now that he's going to parallel it to the trial of your faith being more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a christ-like character so the gold of God is not working signs the gold of God is Not performing Miracles we believe in that our God is moving Among Us brother Daryl and I have met with the youth here uh the other night on Thursday night David was able to stream the service while they were streaming the service somebody got healed somebody else got healed just by hearing testimonies of healing I love it don't you but that within itself will not get us through the gate if we don't have this kind of goal but never fear the bride will have this God the gold of God is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of flexion you see genuine faith is not just a value to you and I in this life but one day you will trade it for a Visage likened to the Son of God himself notice this Peter says it again and I'll repeat in reading it to you that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory so the trying of your face transfers and changes you and allows you to stand before the Lord Jesus when he comes at his appearing and you won't run you won't be afraid you won't be scared unlike his appearing that when you and I come back with him at the end of the Thousand Years and they will run and scream and holler for the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them but you and I will not run and scream why because we've done been cooked and re-cooked and re-cooked and boiled oh my until the dross of our Humanity our failures our our insignificant vanity that we all have so much of has been cooked to the very top and God allowed the skimmers to come and skim it off and when we stand there we will be a hundred percent pure gold deity deity whom having not seen you love and whom though you have not seen him yet believe him you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith notice this is when Faith Comes to its end when you receive the end of your face even the salvation of your souls notice the prophet he said so he told Abraham he's going to try him and give him trials and every Christian has to be tried Peter said thinking not strange beloved one fiery Trials come upon you for it's only done to prove your face that's more precious to you than gold now we realize people can say oh I believe God why sure I believe every word in that Bible until they're Tried by it how many people around our message have said that absolutely I believe I have a word of that until you preach something they didn't know he said or it don't apply to their situation then they don't believe it no more it's amazing how many preachers I'm finding friends it would shock you it would shock you how many preachers that I'm dealing with around the message that you sent them quote after quote after quote after quote I have to quote I have to quote scripture after scripture at the scripture I description and they won't even acknowledge them and say the word is right and I am wrong that's where we are I'm telling you you better get the good stuff you better get the good gold we don't want pyrite we don't want to stand in front of the light and Sparkle and turn around and act like but if it's not real gold it is worthless amen oh but I can sing I can jump I can preach that's good that's wonderful I'm glad you can but I want something inside of you that'll keep you that you'll look at this word remember the Holy Ghost will never lead you or I contrary to his word and if you or I do something wrong and a man of God shows us the word then the Holy Ghost in you or I will make us admit that word is right I did wrong I'm sorry I apologize and if what you've got don't make you do that you ain't got the Holy Ghost oh my listen to this look when you're sick sometime how is it that the righteous suffer wish we had a night to preach on it that how God does it for his own Glory and turns right back around and heals that I don't know if you caught the words in that verse brother Joe Harris sent me that song the other day that Harry and another Caleb just sung and our sanitary because I thought it's a beautiful song but I don't know if you caught the words just hearing at one time but it says if my story is For Your Glory if my story is For Your Glory and somehow it will please you for me to be broken then Lord that's what I want to be how many believe your story is for His glory well your story will contain all types of things ups and downs and ins and outs and you've got draws in you today no doubt your pastor still has dross in him no doubt every preacher sitting here today every Deacon every good sincere saint of God we still have dross but the difference between us and others is we say God get it out of me Lord get it out of me whatever he got to do God if I have to go through the fire and you got to crank her up get it out of me if you've got to keep cranking it up after that and you give me a little bit of a rest and you throw me back in so be it Lord let me be a strong servant of God let me be one that can be a soldier that will stand before the people of God in this last day the children of God don't need to see weak leaders they don't need to see weaklings in the Pulpit ready to quit and ready to give up I'll tell you the kind of man they need to see holy ghost film men that will still preach the word without compromise and say brother sister we can face it no matter what you're going through today I'm here to tell you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world darkness is under your feet cancer is under your fear cigarettes can be put under your feet alcohol can be put under your fear you are more than conquerors foreign that's how God does it for his own Glory turns it right back around and heals that and starts a testimony so God will allow something to come your way and it seems awful it seems so terrible and God will turn right around and heal you and bring the testimony out of that that can affect hundreds of people to God notice God takes his holy spirit takes the Christian the church and beats it with the gospel so let me tell you this today if you're a visitor you go to a church where they're not beating you you better change my brother don't I go I've been for years and years they don't never whoop me you're sitting under a false prophet no one hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth a preacher that ain't beating you don't love you the only beings in this building today that don't need to be beat are the babies that don't don't understand yet and the angels of God that are here all the rest of us need to Target out of us so notice it beats it with the gospel back and forth back and forth until it reflects Jesus and the Holy Spirit can see the works of Jesus going on in the church then things begin to go fine but there's too much Dross in the church today can anybody say Amen Lord I've got too much Dross too much Jaws in the church today too much now we're fine people we're the best in the world we're the cream of the crop but the church needs to make herself ready get ready let me knows it we need to make ourselves ready again how can overcome he that cometh to God must first be tested that only shows a true child then say he's tested when the test comes on you listen you can't overcome unless there's a test give to you wow how many wants a great testimony let's break down the word testimony t e s t i m o n y test I'm only and groanie and complaining oh that's that's what you all do too I say we want a great testimony do we know it do we want a testimony that we come out of this world Lord by your grace and we walk into heaven and them saints are saying where'd you come from I lived in the latest said they say Lord have mercy you mean you lived in that that worse there the worst day it's the worst day that ever human beings ever lived on the earth you live during that time frame I sure did how did you do it brother sister how did you do it by the grace of God oh Mom when we walk in there we don't want no T-shirt we don't want no T-shirt I survive Leo to see it we want to walk in our Overcomers do we not we want to walk in with a testimony by his grace we overcome the worst age that human beings ever lived on the earth we lived in the day can you imagine if some of our forefathers would have heard about television and Internet and pornography and all that stuff on a smartphone where all of that sin would be accessible just at the push of a button can you imagine some of our forefathers said Lord don't let me live in that age I wouldn't want to live in that age but God's got some young people God's got some young men some young women come on somebody preach with me God's got some people on the face of the Earth today are living in the middle of Hell itself there's Darkness all around us friends there's chaos everywhere we are not living in a paradise we are living in the middle of hell but by the grace of God we will overcome every devil the people of God will overcome every evil you young people can overcome you middle-aged people you can overcome us older people we can overcome not only can we shall how cook cook and more cook but brother Donnie I've been cooked my whole life I understand I was 12 when I got saved and I'm 67. you figure the mass I've been cooked my whole Christian Life especially since I come to the message and I'm enjoying it more than I've ever enjoyed it before praise God you know what it gets sweeter I'm getting closer the days are getting closer everyone will be look after there's no hope for this world the No Redemption for this world only the coming of the Lord Jesus where would we be was it not for him was our only hope what can they offer you what can they produce to you that will help you lay down at night and have peace nothing listen this and of course when the test is given it's given to see whether you can overcome or not Jesus said to him that overcometh the test everybody look this way please I want you to see one of the greatest things next to Salvation that is given to any of us the test is the greatest thing that has that ever happened to you can anybody say Amen yet or do you need to grow into that a little bit it don't seem like it does it it don't seem like it you say so because we don't understand how to make good gold we don't understand the process but God understands the process of making 100 percent called so he says I'm going to give Larry one of the best things I could get that boy can play at piano he can tickle them ivories I'm telling you what you don't have to even look at him he he cannot even hear a song before and go down there and play that thing I give him a great talent when I bless him be able to do that but I'm going to give him the greatest thing I could give him for than salvation I'm going to test him I'm going to let him have issues with his heart I'm gonna let the doctors even tell him I didn't hear him you're you're pretty close to dying you realize you could die when he had his episode here not long ago and they said you you could have died no he couldn't God wasn't done with him yet praise the Lord so what did God do that God gave him the test and God let him come on the other side of the test and then God turned the test into a testimony but he wouldn't had that testimony today could you see him sit there and raise his hand and give praise to God he would not have that testimony if the test had not come first don't lose strength Church don't lose your faith in the middle of the test know that God's given it to you so he can have honor and Glory out of your life your story is written for his glory your story has been lived out in this day for the glory of God it's not for us our story is not about us how people can read about our life and think boy they done this or that or the other no it ain't about that our story is written for his glory oh my let my story and your story be written for the glory and mercy of God the sand let me finish this quote Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that God is with us listen now when we're tested you see people that aren't being tried and tested there's something wrong our church never has no trouble well we're so happy God bless you enjoy it while you can because if you're a Church of the Living God it won't stay that way I don't care who your pastor is Jesus was the pastor of the 12 disciples he had the office church ever was they had troubles that arguing they had fuss and they had fight it's just goes with having churches and God is going to allow your church to be tested if it's a true church now if it's not if it's a shock church if it's just that type of church he don't even worry about it but if it's a True Church of the Living God he's going to let it be tested it's one good evidence to see that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God or tested and tried let me read the scripture to you and Peter beloved beloved think it not strange concerning what fiery not ashy not ashy fiery look at the meaning of the word a burning the burning by which meddles what a strange meaning of the word are roasted roasted and reduced by a figure drawn from a Refiner's Fire calamities or trials that test praise God praise God I want to be true you only true call me true do we want to be true because we know he and his wisdom will never allow more to come upon us the one he gives us strength to bear it maybe you find yourself there today and I know some of you do because I'm your pastor so I know some of the things that you're going through got a text Carol did yesterday from one of the families in our church and they're dealing with this certain issue and another issue with her son another issue with health and another issue with this and that so sent him a quote that's one of my favorites when I'm going through things it's from invisible Union the prophet said with the law of contrast he talks about how that we go through times in our life and it's seemed like it's a daytime then he said it'll switch on you and it'll be a night time and he said like we say it down south when it rains it pours how many said them days like that and you just say Lord I I can't take another day I don't know what to do Lord what in the world what is going on but remember Noah when it seemed like it couldn't go a day further put a rainbow in the cloud I don't mind telling you it makes me mad I'm so mad right now I could buy the Snicker bar right in the half that's how mad it makes me that the devil and his crowd stole our rainbow side huh and it we're that we're ashamed even refer to the rainbow we're afraid to even have one anywhere because we'll think people will think we're like them and the devil hijacked it he done the same thing to shouting he'd done the same thing about dancing the devil never started dancing the devil never started dancing God told Joe where was you when the morning stars sing together and the sons of God shouted for Joy the prophet said this up for a dancing in heaven before the foundation of the world dancing didn't start with the devil it started with God well come on somebody worshiping and loving and adoring that didn't start for the devil that's the way they do it concerts you probably read it the other day on your smartphone or your newspaper or whatever a Taylor Swift concert was being held out west they got so loud the people now the people got so loud and clapping their hands and screaming and hollering at her concert they caused an earthquake it showed up on the seismograph an earthquake well the devil ain't the originator of that Paul and Silas were Glory we ought not to get in our mind well these people I hear dance we came I'll tell you one thing well I danced out there in the world we'll get saved filled with the Holy Ghost change Partners keep right on Dancing keep right on dancing but you dance to different music now brother sister if anybody ought to have the joy of the Lord it ought to be the people of God it's just about going home time our troubles are almost over our burdens are almost passive oh Hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready the sparrow heads [Music] Heavenly Father you're the only one today who can look down on every individual heart see how much draws how much dirt how much pyrite is still mixed in with the gold may they not leave here today with the wrong picture in their mind it's not like you're trying our flesh and trying to get all the flesh out of our flesh there ain't no hope for our flesh it ain't redeemed it ain't saved it ain't never had the Holy Ghost not one day there's only one hope for our flesh and that is to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye or if we go by the way of the Grave we will raise up with a brand new flesh body what you're trying to separate from is the gold which is our character it's the way we treat people the way we treat your word the way we deal with one another that's our character it's our character I remember when I first come here years ago and I've been here for a couple years and the Lord you remember you placed it on my heart to preach character I don't think I'll ever forget it as long as I live brother Bill Hudson I thought I'd preach that and I was sitting with him and brother Calvin Brother JD some of the brothers he said brother Donnie I don't think I've ever heard that like that before that character as he called it that character of God every time after that if I get to be around him very long he'd bring that up again Lord we know it's an important thing so what you want to do is heat up in order to get flaws out of our character so if people treat us bad then how do we treat them if they're not nice to us how do we treat them back when the word is put to us and we show that we have been behaving wrong or believing wrong will we correct and say God forgive me I'm sorry I didn't know the word said that that's our character or will we just say well I feel that anyway which we know is the direction a lot of people go in this day you can show them what the prophet said show them what the scripture said well I feel led to go this way oh the dross in such a character Lord would you search each of us today and we're not trying to take a pitch for today Lord and say boy I wish so and so had been there today they sure needed to hear that I always so and so was there but Lord God we want to open our hearts and say Lord I was here I heard what was preached father I preached it and I'm opening my heart I want you to look at me Jesus I want you to look at me and see if there's anything in me that displeases you I don't care what it is I've been serving you most of my life preaching most of my life I don't want to miss it Lord I don't want to labor in vain till God look at me today search me help me father if there's any draws any power right any dirt not in my Humanity but in my character oh Jesus cleanse me cleanse me anybody here with me today you want God to do the same thing for you just raise your hand and open your heart to him now Lord help me maybe it's the way you treat your wife maybe it's the way it treats your husband maybe it's the way you treat your neighbor live behind beside you around you in your subdivision and a little loud or whatever mourn boy you just have a real attitude toward them each of us know we know what our weaknesses are our faults don't jump out of the pot friends don't jump out of the kettle when God cranks it up but just say God give me more grace share the other words to this verse of this song God instead of giving healing you gave her it Grace so the author of the song was referring to Saint Paul of course when Paul asks for healing but God didn't give him healing but he said my grace is sufficient so sometimes you ask God for healing and God gives healing other times you ask God for healing and God gives Grace at least for a month or two or six months Maybe and then the healing will come after a while but aren't you glad that he knows exactly what we need and if he's got a prolonged reason for where you are don't lose your face he's testing you he's done testified no doubt to the devil about you you and God's been fellowshipping God's got confidence in you praise the Lord help me Lord that all not falter or fail Lord Jesus help me father Lord God In The Name of Jesus would you move across this building today help each of us Lord May the gold of God be so purified in our lives whatever's lacking in me Lord whatever's lacking in these people some of the Home Folks some visitors Lord would you deal with us help us oh Lord when the temperature increases increases and it becomes hot and we become weary help us not to lose faith oh Grant it Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus May our character please your father hallelujah hallelujah we worship you today Lord God would you just lift your hands with me and just open your heart to him just let him search him praise the Lord praise the Lord we bless your name Lord God we worship you Jesus we don't want to be drunk on the things of the world father sometimes you might let a little financial crisis strike us so it will force materialism to the top of the pot so we can see I didn't realize how much I loved this world and it's things until I got that crunch maybe you'll let something really hit us maybe a cancer maybe a terrible sickness a disease that the doctor sets incurable and once it strikes us fear begins to come to the top of the pot we didn't even realize that fear was there until the doctor gave us that report and then all of a sudden we got afraid you allowed that test to come so it would force the Fear To The Top so you could Deliver Us from the fear oh we love you Lord I mean once after that look at me would you for today brother look at me you want that with all your heart let me tell you what faith for an individual can do also if you know as far as Erica's situation the doctors say they've got maybe one more thing they can try on her as far as they think she's in the last stages no hope this that the other but she told her mama this the other day she said Mama she said I I worry about myself sometimes she said why honey she said I worry because I'm not afraid and I wonder should I worry more because I ain't worried glory to God that's faith brother that's Faith sister so it does so something like with you brother there's something so to you and so changes you and makes you different why aren't we terrified do you understand that Russia has moved nuclear bombs to Belarus do you understand that Russia sent out four of their super bombers su-35s on Friday night the size equivalent to our B-52s which only carry nuclear warheads do you realize we sent one of our nuclear class submarines to South Korea look at Iran look at Israel Hezbollah fixing to attack from the north I like looking at Israel I got the Jerusalem Post app and I look at it every day about because what I see of Israel is they're like us so Israel has Egypt to the bottom they got Jordan over here they got Iraq over here they got Lebanon up here they got the Mediterranean over there they're totally surrounded totally completely surrounded and their estate about the size of New Jersey but do you believe that Israel will be destroyed you don't and why don't you believe that because God's word said it won't but if you've got that much faith for Israel you ought to have that much and more for yourself if God will not allow Israel to be destroyed what about his bride no matter what Satan does he cannot take you under God's purpose is finished Hallelujah what was you playing there singing let's just worship him a little bit can we I hate to take care of this service straight into the kettle so let's just get a little bit of worship in our hearts if you're there today don't be discouraged he loves you he loves you brother Eddie he loves you buddy God knows what you're going through brother Josh he knows what you're going through Lance Michael yes I forgot maybe just some more drugs Hallelujah Hallelujah let's just worship just a little
