We've seen a lot of death and sorrow and heartache, but Lord Jesus, on the other side of that, we've seen you come through so many times, Lord. You've been such an awesome God, Lord.

Somebody look at your neighbor and tell them he's faithful. &gt;&gt; When the reason that I'm standing stands in front of me, sing it, buddy. I have stood for [music] the gospel. When it seemed I [singing] stood alone through the heartaches and [singing and music] frustration and kept my focus on the throne so many times [singing and music] I have recalled. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Savior's word so true. &gt;&gt; Thank you [singing] Lord. &gt;&gt; If you won't be [music] ashamed of me. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I [singing] won't be of you. Thank you [music] Lord. Oh, I proudly stand till [singing] I see [music] the face of [singing] the one who gave everything for me. [music] [singing] Oh, with the reason that I'm standing [music] stands in front of me. Every battle [music and singing] that I fall will be from memory [music and singing] I bow before. &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it to him. Bow down [music and singing] my knees. Thank you, Lord. And the reason that I'm standing [singing] stands in [music and singing] front of me. The road [music] has not been easy. At times I've lost my way. &gt;&gt; Oh yes we have. &gt;&gt; So often [singing] I [music] stumble searching for the light of day. Oh yeah. Circumstances [music and singing] all all around me. &gt;&gt; I thought I'd surely [singing] fall when the whispering of doubt and fear lose [music and singing] it all. But he cares me by his amazing grace. Oh, [music] someday soon I'll have the chance to thank him. face [music and singing] to face. Oh, when the reason that I'm standing [music and singing] stands in front of me. [music and singing] Every battle that we fought, it'll fade from victory. [music] I bow before his might. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, we will. down on [singing] [music] my knees for the reason I'm standing [singing] [music] standing in front of me. [singing] [music] We will join the millions. [singing] Every [music] kindred tongue and raise and every [singing] child of God that day will [music] look upon his face. Praise the Lord. and [music] the heroes [singing] and the marters who got on the pagan soul. [singing] Glory [music] &gt;&gt; all stand and declare Lord Jesus [music] is Lord. [singing] [music] Oh, [singing] with the reason thou sh with all your heart [music] from me. For every [singing] battle that I fought will fade from [music] memory. I bow before his mighty throne and it fall down on [singing] my knees [music] when the reason that I'm [singing] standing [music] stand [singing] in front of me. Can you do that second verse again? [music] Brother Philip and the trio will come. The road has [music] not been easy. Times I've [singing] lost my way. So often [music] I stumble, searching for the [singing] light of day. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Circumstances [music] all around me. I thought I'd surely [singing] fall. Oh yes. When the whispering and doubt [music] and fear told me [singing] you were losing it all, you're going to lose it all. He came me with his [music and singing] amazing grace. Oh, someday [music] soon I'll [singing] have the chance to thank him face to face. And the reason [music] that I'm standing [singing] stand in front of me. Every battle [music] that I will fade [singing] from I [music] bow for his might down [music] with a reason that I'm standing [singing] standing [music] in front of &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; when he [music] stands in front of me.

Well, we're just glad to have them here. Brother Wes, if you and the the group ever how you've got your group put together, if you want to come on to the platform and be getting ready, somebody sent me a text that you was in town.

Good to have my my dad and my sister with me tonight and my family. I also have my nieces who should have sung tonight, brother Donnie, but uh uh I'm the one that has to go home with them so I won't force them to do that. They they're fighting some sickness. It's been going around. But aren't you thankful for those prayers that go forth for us. Amen. Amen. Some of us have been through some really hard times this year. We've lost some [music] folks. Amen. Just talking to brother Bobby telling me about the loss of his son. [music] Amen. Lost our mother-in-law this this year just a few months ago. [music] But God was with us through it all.

When we're in those uh mountaintop experiences, we [music] don't think about it as much, but when you're in the valley, you sure appreciate those things. Amen. So, this song, I hope, is a blessing to you. It's just real simple. Tonight, somebody's praying. I can feel it. [music] Somebody's praying for me. [music] Mighty hands [singing] are guiding [music] me to protect me from what I can't see. And Lord, I believe. [music] Lord, I believe [music] somebody's praying for me.

[singing] And Lord, I believe. [music] Lord, I believe. [singing] Somebody's praying [music] for [singing] me. Angels are watching. Oh, I can feel it. Angels are watching over [music and singing] me. There's many miles ahead till I get home. Still, I'm safely kept before your throne. And Lord, I believe. [music] Lord, I [singing] believe. Angels are watching over me.

Still I'm safely [music] kept before your throne. And Lord I believe. Lord I believe. [music and singing] Angels are watching over [music] me. There's [music and singing] many miles the wilderness where my pillow [singing] was a stone. And I've been [music] through the darkest caverns where no light has ever shown. Still [music] I went on cuz there was someone who was down [singing] on their knees. [music] And I thank you for all those people praying all [singing] those times [music] for me.

[music] Lord, [singing] I believe [music] somebody's praying for me. [singing] [music] [applause] grateful not only for the mercy of the Lord, but I'm grateful for a praying church family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just this four walls here, but people around the world that pray for us in the time of need and trouble. I know people make it without it. I just honestly don't know how they do. &gt;&gt; But they live every day without God in their life. They live every day without a praying family that's praying for them. But how we appreciate prayers of the saints of God, don't we? help us through so many various things that we go through in life. What a privilege it's been for us in 2025. Some of you may went down for the third time. You know, you went under water and you come back up and you went back down. You come back up and you went back down. You come back up. You think, "Oh Lord, am I going to make it?" And guess what? You made it. &gt;&gt; Here you are, the last day of 25. I personally hope they don't see the end of another year. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope the Lord comes. But if he does, we're still going to be victorious. Are we not? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As the people of God. Amen. It's great privilege for us to be together tonight. No place I'd rather be on the last night of the year than me being a church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Turn with me if you would tonight to the book of Isaiah, chapter 14, verse 12. We've been speaking about the [clears throat] the bride's diary. The diary was given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life to the man that she's going to be married to is also going to be part of her in inheritance. So believers are given gifts by our heavenly father to equip us for our new life and also for our journey. So, we have a new life here by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, a new walk with God, Christian life, and then we're also in a journey into that great heavenly city where there will be no sorrow, sadness, death, and all that. So when we open up the treasure chest and we look inside the chest that the father's given us as um Rebecca would have done when Elizer was sent to her and an angel of God for his coming and moved on her heart. So when we open the lid of our treasure chest and we look inside and we see all these wonderful things that our father has given to us. Now some of them may bring immediate joy. Some of them we look at them and we may not quite understand them. Others of them we look at them and we know by their presence that difficult times are going to be ahead. Because the father don't give you just anything without reason or purpose or motive or objective. Tonight, one of the things we're going to look at, and we've been looking at it for a few services, is with the angels of God. So, the angels of the Lord, our heavenly father has placed them along our journey to help us, but it's also a sign that we definitely are going to need them because they're not here just to decorate. They're not here just for you to look at, but they're here because your journey is going to need angelic visitation, angelic help. So, with that being said, let's read Isaiah 14:12. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning. Look at the meaning of the word Lucifer. The Hebrew word there is hel. Hel which is very close to one of the names for God in the Hebrew. Hel. Now look at the meaning of the word lightbearer, shining one, morning star. Wow. So Lucifer, that name means lightbringer, shining one, morning star. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer? Notice what Isaiah calls him, son of the morning. How art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thine heart. Now notice where sin began. It didn't begin on the earth. Wasn't drinking, smoking, lying, adultery, fornication, television. It wasn't any of that. But it actually begins right here. Now watch it. For thou hast said in thine heart, notice these two things that he's going to say over and over and over again. I will. I will ascend. Look at the Hebrew word Allah. Allah. In case you're still wondering where Islam come from. &gt;&gt; Allah. &gt;&gt; That's the name of their God. Allah &gt;&gt; ascend to go up climb to go up go up over go up over. So you're going to try to go over something or someone &gt;&gt; to go up over to extend of boundary. Now, this is what Allah means and this is what Islam wants to do. They'll never be allowed to do it, but this is what they want to do. They want to conquer the world, &gt;&gt; but they'll never be allowed to do it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Notice what it means. Extend of boundary to be exalted to lift oneself. So, Allah wants to be greater than the Almighty. But he never will be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. For thou has said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will. Again, notice his words. I will exalt my. So, it's all about I and me and mine and my. &gt;&gt; Can't you see why God hates that thing when it gets on his children? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you see where this comes from? &gt;&gt; From the devil. &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne. You say he's got one. He sure does. And he's worshiped by billions of people in this earth. &gt;&gt; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. Look with me at the meaning of this word kokab which means of Messiah's brothers. Huh? How in the world did the devil know the Messiah was going to have brothers? I will exalt my throne above the stars of Messiah's brothers. numerous progeny personification of God's omniscience. Now, this is what his sons are, personification of God's omnitions. And the devil said, "That's perfectly fine. You've got boys, you got sons, you got a church. I'll exalt myself above them and I'll rise above you. &gt;&gt; Well, he's doing a lot of bragging, ain't he? &gt;&gt; Well, I guess y'all know so far he ain't done it. &gt;&gt; And I hate to disappoint him. Well, no, not really. He ain't never going to. &gt;&gt; Now, notice, I will exalt myself above the stars of God. again his famous words, I will sit [snorts] upon the mount of the congregation. Now, wait a minute. Ain't that what we call people who go to church? Of course, I guess if you don't believe in going to church, then you're not called this. You're stay homers. &gt;&gt; I will sit also upon the mount. Notice what he wants as his own. The mount of the congregation. Again, look at the meaning of the word congregation. Appointed place, appointed time, meeting, sacred season, set [snorts] feast or a tent of meeting. So the devil wants a tent meeting. &gt;&gt; Now what you notice? He don't say nothing about a honky tonk, a bar, a brothel, &gt;&gt; a house of prostitution. He wants the congregation. And notice what direction he wants them in the sides of the north. the north. &gt;&gt; Now remember, he went to the north side of heaven and preached to the angels and deceived them. Now notice what he goes on to say in the congregation in the sides of the north. And I will again I will ascend above the heights [snorts] of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet, ah, I love verse 15. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell &gt;&gt; to the sides of the pit. Now, he wanted the sides of the north, but he gets the sides of the pit. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man? Not the God, not the great Allah, not the great mighty one. Is this the man? I want to be part of this verse right here one of these days. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to look down on him and say, "You mean that is what caused so much trouble. &gt;&gt; That was what caused all this issues around the world. Is this the man?" What humiliation that the elect of God will not look to him and honor him as a mighty one, but say he is less than a god. Is this the man that made the earth to tremble? THAT DID SHAKE KINGDOMS, that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, that open not the house of his prisoners. Wow. And may to be remembered tonight as we pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight for this opportunity, Lord, that's been given to us. With the songs that we've sang, with the reading of the scripture, we could close now in prayer and say, "It's been good to be in the house of the Lord." But we feel like you have something you want to say to us tonight, Lord. So, we open our hearts. May our hearts be fertile ground, Lord God, that your presence, your spirit may sew seeds and bring forth a harvest, a crop, the progeny of the Messiah's brothers. We know that your kingdom is under an onslaught by this enemy that we have read about tonight. But we read the last book of the Bible and we know we win and we know he is a loser. &gt;&gt; For that we're thankful tonight. Father, you see this prayer cloth that I have in my hand for one of the sisters here in our church, Lord, that has a need in her body. And you know exactly what it is, Father. And I'm just believing you tonight in the name of Jesus. May this situation come normal, dear God. Grant it. Speak to us from your word, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I don't mind telling you as just a man, I would be quite afraid to meet such a being that we have just read about. A being that stood at the right hand of God. a being that was actually God's right-hand man to fellowship. A being that was like God except he couldn't create. So he's not omnipotent, does not have omnipresence, lots of things that he does not have, but he does have the desire to be like God. and even made this proclamation before God himself. I want you to know, God, I'm going to be like you, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to have a throne, and I will exalt my throne above your boys, your sons, and I will wind up with the congregation in the sides of the north. I will be like you, God. So he wants to be like God. He desires to be like God. So he has no beings to help carry this out because he's not omnipotent on the mission. He cannot be at all places at one time. He can only be in one place at one time. So he needs something to help him carry out this worldwide desire. Now, Satan wanted to be like God and it caused sin. But we read about another man in the Bible that was a man after God's own heart and God give him credit for it. Isn't it amazing? One being wants to be like God out of selfishness. Another one wants to be like God out to bring glory and honor to God. And God testifies of that great desire. Look how close right and wrong really are. &gt;&gt; So this being raises up. Now sin actually began here and we know the prophet tells us that that the angels actually fell before the foundation of the world. So this was in the pre-atomite state before the world was ever brought into existence, the world as we know it. And it was there in that heavenly realms and we don't know how many spheres that there was of course cherubam, seraraphims, zoons, angels of different degree. And we know that Paul breaks also into this same Romans 2 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 13. if you'd like to read with me. And he said, "For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ." Now listen, this same anointing that started out in heaven by the time the apostolic age comes on the earth. 2 Corinthians written around 60- 62 AD. So by now on the earth, the devil has already started mimicking the work of God. Now he was not the first one to have apostles. God was. But after Jesus chose apostles, the devil said, "That's a great idea." So what did he do? He started having apostles, too. Jesus started having pastors, and the devil said, "That's a tremendous idea. I'm going to have them, too." Now watch, for such are false apostles. You see, they never had to use these terms together, false apostles, for several years, because Satan was learning the new program of God, and he didn't know what it was going to be like. So, he's watching as God unfolds in the New Testament age. And after he does it, then he goes right back to the very same thing that he did in the Garden of Eden. And that was to bring forth a twin which would mirror the original work of God. God called them apostles. Satan said, "I'll have false apostles." God had true men of God. Satan will have false men of God. God will have a church. Satan will have a church. So he just twin whatever that God did. Now watch how Paul said, "For such are false apostles deceitful workers." But I want you to notice what he says about these people that they are workers. Man, they work and work and work and work and work. But they're deceitful workers. You see, they're working, working all the time, doing something, doing something, doing something, doing something. But they've got a motive and an objective that is deceitful. And yet, it's amazing how many times workers like this will get inside a church or a family or a move of God. And boy, the people will flock to them and flock around them like crazy and they think they're the greatest people that ever was because they're all the time working, working, working, working, doing this and that and the other. But there's a motive about them that isn't just quite right. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the amazing part about this verse to me. transforming themselves, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. How is that possible? Now, right over here next to our pavilion, just right outside the door, we've got this substation. Now, some of the brothers here in Electric could tell you a whole lot more about it than I can, but I do know a little bit about transformers. And transformers have the ability to send certain voltage into one side of it and it can either step it up or it can take it down. Now, some of these things up here on the platform, you plug them into a 110 outlet and then they have a built-in transformer on the inside of it and it will reduce it to 3 volts, 12 volts, 9 volts, however the manufacturer decide to make it. And it has the ability. Now, if you plug that 12 volt inside of this 110, it's going to blow it all to pieces and fire is going to fly everywhere. But the transformer is able to change it into low voltage. Well, you can also put in certain voltage into a substation and it will come out multiplied, goes in several hundreds, come out thousands on the other side. Now, that's what transforming does. But these people actually have the ability to transform themselves into the apostles of Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Transforming themselves into. NOW, ARE they actually going in devils and coming out real apostles on the other side? No. But they look so real THAT PAUL SETS forth the analogy as if though these people they're false apostles are deceitful workers but YET THEY COME OUT on the other side of this transformation and many people will perceive that they are true genuine apostles. Now notice in verse 14, and no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. SO, SATAN, THE DEVIL, THE CAUSE OF ALL SIN AND WICKEDNESS and evil, can actually transform himself and appear as an angel of light. Ah, so this helps me see when I open the lid of our little treasure box from our father and I look on the inside and there's angels. This helps me to understand why I NOT ONLY NEED THE Bible and I not only need the prophets tapes and I not only need a pastor and an evangelist and a teacher and a church and the church said &gt;&gt; but I also need angels that will help me to be able to discern the difference between true apostles and false ones &gt;&gt; because they will be so close it would deceive the very elected if it were possible. SO THEN SATAN can actually transform himself into an angel of light. NOTICE AGAIN, THEREFORE IT IS NO great thing if read these words. Yes. &gt;&gt; What &gt;&gt; you mean the devil has preachers that are called his ministers? &gt;&gt; Wow. His ministers also be transformed as [screaming] the ministers OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. BUT WHAT IS THE TRANSFORMER? WHAT IS IT THAT FALSE preachers can run through some type of spiritual transformation and THEY WILL COME OUT ON THE OTHER side of that transformer and actually deceive good, genuine, sincere people &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY LOOK SO REAL. THEY CAN SOUND so real and they can be so close they would deceive the very elected if it were possible. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "THEREFORE, IT IS NO GREAT THING IF his ministers ALSO BE TRANSFORMED as the ministers of &gt;&gt; Wow. You mean they can run through the transformer and come out on the other SIDE AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE looking at a minister of righteousness and he's in this one category and you see another preaching boy you know he's straight from hell because he does this that and other. No, YOU SEE ONCE THEY RUN THROUGH A SUPERNATURAL power of transformation, don't you understand what that is? Demons. Oh, &gt;&gt; fallen angels. &gt;&gt; And a religious devil is seven times worse than any other devil. &gt;&gt; So, A DEMON CAN ACTUALLY PULL a preacher through the transforming. Now, thank God all preachers don't go through that. Even all non-bride preachers won't. But for those who will yield themsel and give their gift, their ability to talk or whatever more that they will yield to the I will. They will yield to I want this and I want that and I want to be big. And they're constantly moving and looking beyond the boundary of what God assigned to them by predestination. But it's never enough. IT'S NEVER ENOUGH. THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BE BIGGER. THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BE GREATER. THEY'VE GOT TO BE BIGGER than this man. Their church has got to be bigger. They'll steal. They'll lie. They'll cheat. They do whatever they have to do in order to make themselves greater and bigger. &gt;&gt; They just cannot stand their assigned boundaries. &gt;&gt; Don't you see, friend? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. How many wants to say where God put you? I don't care if it's this big around. I'd rather have that and be in the will of God than be something 10,000 times bigger and be totally after the devil. &gt;&gt; Oh my. THEREFORE, IT IS NO GREAT thing if his ministers also be TRANSFORMED AS THE MINISTERS of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works. Now look in Revelation 12:3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven. And behold, a great red dragon, great red dragon, having seven heads and 10 horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven. Now remember the prophet in 1957 when he was talking about the scripture and he said it was not that the devil had a long tale but it was the t a l e &gt;&gt; that he told those stars. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch. AND HE DID CAST them to the earth and THE DRAGON STOOD BEFORE THE woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born. Of course, the woman was Israel and the child was the Lord Jesus. Now, let's look back at this realm of the angels in second Peter 2:4. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, Lord have mercy, children, can you imagine these words? Angels that sin. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEINGS THAT WERE NOT BORN like we were. They were not born lost. They were not BORN OF SINFUL PARENTS. They were created holy, created righteous, created in the presence of God to live in a realm that's beyond what our minds no doubt can even comprehend. BUT THEN PETER SAYS, "FOR GOD SPARED not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to [screaming] hell." Now listen, I know it's the same English word as what you might think is Hades, but it's tartaro. Tartaro, THE DEEPEST abyss of Hades, the name of the subterranean region, DOULFUL AND DARK. SO GOD DELIVERED them now, not just into Hades, but into the deepest realm of the abyss. Now, are they on THE EARTH? OF COURSE THEY ARE. Are they STILL ACCUSING US BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD? THEY ARE. BUT THEY'RE SOULS. THEY'RE SOULS. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN THE ABYSS &gt;&gt; AND CAN never be redeemed. THIS IS WHY THEY WALK THROUGH DRY places seeking rest. &gt;&gt; They are tormented creatures. NOTICE HE CAST THEM DOWN TO HELL and delivered them oh God into chains OF DARKNESS WHICH IS MIST OR BLACKNESS USED OF the darkness of the nether world. SO THIS IS WHERE THEY'VE been delivered to into the realm or the sphere of darkness. Now I want you to notice that Peter when he talked about this him and Jude wrote several things that was very similar when it come to the realms of the regions of the lost. Jude in verse 6 he says and the angels WHICH KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. And the word estate is is principality or it is IT IS THE BEGINNING OR the commencement AND THAT WHICH SURPASSES ALL others in position and point of rank and honor and preeminence AND DIGNITY. SO THESE beings that Peter is referring to and Jude IS REFERRING TO WERE NOT BEINGS THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, SLITHERING UP OUT OF HELL AND my they were breathing fire AND THEY WERE HORRIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THEY BECOME. THAT'S NOT what they were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE OF dignity and rank around the throne of God. They were likened to the heavenly stars in honor and dignity. Now notice in the dignity THAT THEY DID NOT KEEP, THEY FELL FROM IT. NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ACCORDING TO WHAT Paul wrote, he said that there are elect angels which of course could NOT FALL. BUT THEN THERE WERE SOME THAT FATHER BROUGHT INTO existence which would be placed on probation. They would be created in high and high rank and there would be an order of divine hierarchy and protocol and even after they would fall away or backside if you wish to say it that way from their POSITION THEY WOULD STILL maintain a rank and a hierarchy. This is why McDaniel prayed and Gabriel was sent down. We looked at it a couple weeks ago and Gabriel COULD NOT GET THROUGH BECAUSE that demon over the kingdom there WAS ACTUALLY THOUGH HE WAS BACKSLID AND FALLEN FROM GOD'S PRESENCE. AND HERE WAS THE MIGHTY ANGEL GABRIEL. BUT THIS DEMON STILL had a rank THAT WAS SO HIGH GABRIEL COULD NOT break through. AND HE SAID HE STAYED THERE WITH HIM AND WRESTLED AND FOUGHT WITH THIS THIS FALLEN ANGEL, THIS DEMON POWER until Michael, which was one OF THE CHIEF PRINCES, CAME DOWN and he took on the battle AND THEN IT SENT GABRIEL ON DOWN. NOW THINK OF THE MIGHTY ANGEL GABRIEL AND A DEMON POWER WITHTOOD HIM FOR THREE WEEKS, 21 DAYS. OH, thank God for angels along our journey. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T NO WONDER SOMETIMES WHEN YOU PRAY. ANYBODY EVER FEEL THAT WAY? When you FEEL LIKE YOUR PRAYERS DON'T GO NO HIGHER IN YOUR HEAD, YOU EVER PRAY AND ASK GOD, "GOD, PLEASE MOVE. GOD, PLEASE DO THIS. PLEASE DO THAT." AND IT FEELS LIKE GOD'S A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM YOU. ANYBODY EVER felt that way? OF COURSE YOU HAVE. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH, FRIENDS? BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED TONIGHT. GOD STILL GOT ANGELS AND THEY'RE ON DISPATCH AND THEY'RE SENT OUT TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD IN the time of trouble. Hallelujah. You remember THE PROPHET TALKING ABOUT THE TWO WOMEN THAT COME AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE prayer line and he one of them of course had the issue with her stomach and the other one had a gorder AND HE SAID THEY KEPT ON BELIEVING, KEPT ON BELIEVING. Days went by, another day went by. You remember the story? The one cooked herself an egg and ate her kids oatmeal and all that. AND THE PROPHET TALKED about it and she run running over to her neighbor's house. AND WHEN SHE GOT INSIDE THERE, THAT SISTER of hers, SHE WAS SHAKING THE SHEETS BECAUSE THE TUMOR HAD FELL OFF. OH, glory to God. THE TUMOR HAD FELL OFF OF HER BODY. AND THE PROPHET SAID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WAS PASSING THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT MORNING. And he SAID, "IF THEY WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR FAITH, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GOT THEIR HEALING." OH MY. AND SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT BE WITHIN AN HOUR OF YOUR DELIVERANCE AND YOU'LL GIVE UP. OR YOU MIGHT BE WITHIN A DAY OR TWO DAYS. DON'T YOU GIVE UP. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT. YOU KEEP RIGHT ON FIGHTING. HALLELUJAH. THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE STILL ON DISPATCH TO THE SAINTS OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, help us. SO THEY WERE CREATED in perfect holiness and righteousness AND IN THE IN THEIR NATURE. There was a dignity and an honor that was given to them, DOMINIONS AND PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS. PAUL uses this, of course, in Ephesians and Philippians and a couple different places in THE NEW TESTAMENT. THEY BEHELD THE FACE OF ELOHIM. THEY STOOD RIGHT BEFORE THAT GREAT BRILLIANT LIGHT. THEY WALKED INTO HIS PRESENCE UPON HIM. THEY WALKED INTO HIS PRESENCE AND SAW THE THE CHRIST OF GOD, THE VISIBLE APPEARANCE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD. THEY STOOD THERE IN HIS PRESENCE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG, AND YET MADE a choice to turn and go away from him. NOTICE JUDE GOES ON TO SAY, "AND THE ANGELS WHICH KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST ESTATE, BUT LEFT their own habitation." THEIR OWN HABITATION. And the word rendered for habitation, it means THAT HEAVEN WAS THEIR NATIVE abode or THEIR DWELLING PLACE AND THEY LEFT IT BY SIN AND THEY BECAME dissatisfied with what God had given them. Are you kidding me? YOU BECOME DISSATISFIED WITH PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME DISSATISFIED WITH sinlessness and purity AND HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND YOU WANT TO BECOME A DEMON. &gt;&gt; Lord God, &gt;&gt; NOTICE SO THEY BECOME DISSATISFIED AND THEIR ABODE AND ON ON THE VOLUNTARY BASIS THEY WALKED AWAY FROM THEIR POSITION. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS? THIS IS THE BATTLE OF YOUR WAR OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU BECOME A CHILD OF GOD, IT'S FOR STAYING IN YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; STAYING IN YOUR PLACE IN CHRIST JESUS. STAYING IN THE PLACE THAT GOD'S ORDAINED YOU TO BE. OH, I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD PREACH WITH ME TONIGHT. AND SATAN WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HE CAN. IF GOD'S ORDAINED YOU TO COME TO THIS CHURCH, THE DEVIL WILL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO keep you AWAY FROM IT. HE'LL TELL YOU PEOPLE DON'T LOVE YOU. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU. THIS AND THAT AND THE OTHER. COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF YOU BELONG AMONGST A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM AND HE SAY THEY DON'T LIKE YOU. They don't want YOU HERE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? HE'S TRYING TO DO TO YOU WHAT HE WOUND UP DOING TO THESE ANGELS. HE TALKED THEM RIGHT OUT OF THEIR POSITION AND HE PREACHED TO THEM AND TOLD THEM, "LOOK, GOD DON'T NEED YOU. GOD DON'T LOVE YOU. GOD DON'T WANT YOU. YOU NEED TO REBEL AGAINST HIM. YOU NEED TO LEAVE. I I'M FIXING TO START ANOTHER GROUP OVER HERE. I'M GONNA START ANOTHER CONGREGATION. AND Y'ALL WANT TO COME AND JOIN TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; BY ATTEMPTING TO RISE HIGHER, or so THEY THOUGHT, &gt;&gt; OR BY QUITTING THEIR station or their post OF DUTY, &gt;&gt; THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXALT THEMSELVES under a new headship called Lucifer. Dear God HAVE MERCY. NOW THEY ARE RESERVED IN chains of darkness. Lord Jesus keep us father. NOTICE IN MATTHEW 25:41. THE LORD JESUS SAID, "THEN SHALL HE SAY UNTO them on the left hand, depart from me, you cursed into everlasting fire." Now the word everlasting here is anon, of course, and it means age plus age. He doesn't say eternal, but age plus age, everlasting fire prepared for THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. SO THIS REALM WAS NOT EVEN MADE FOR MAN. IT WASN'T EVEN made for man in THE FIRST PLACE. BUT WHEN MAN EXALTS HIMSELF ABOVE GOD'S WORD, YOU SEE THIS IS WHY THAT GOD, EVEN THOUGH many of them are not bride and THEY'RE NOT ELECT, BUT GOD OFFERS THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAVED AND THEY TURN IT DOWN. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, GOD SAID, "YOU'VE REJECTED my salvation. I'M OFFERING TO YOU. YOU'RE NOT EVEN ONE OF MY STARS. YOU'RE NOT EVEN ONE OF MY SONS AND DAUGHTERS. YOU'RE NOT EVEN AN ATTRIBUTE OF MINE." BUT I'M SAYING, "WHOSOEVER WILL JUST come on if you want to be delivered." THEY SAY, "NO, WE DON'T WANT to be delivered. We want TO GO TO HELL." &gt;&gt; WELL, GOD SAID, "ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S WHAT you want, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING." BUT I'M TELLING YOU, THIS PLACE WAS NOT CREATED FOR ONE HUMAN BEING. IT WAS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL, PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. &gt;&gt; But if it was created and had a beginning, &gt;&gt; it also has an end. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Thank God. NOW, YOU WOULD THINK, FRIENDS, THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THESE THINGS THAT THE FALL OF ANGELS FROM SUCH A PLACE OF preeminence would be a warning to human beings. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why isn't it &gt;&gt; WHY IS IT THAT HUMANS WILL LISTEN TO THIS STORY AND I MEAN JUST FREAK OUT, JUST TEAR THEM ALL TO pieces and turn right around and do the same thing. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice a strange parallel. Paul in 1 Timothy chapter 3:5 is talking about the office of a bishop which of course was a pastor AND PAUL IS GIVING the requirements for a BISHOP FOR IF A MAN NOT KNOW how to rule his OWN HOUSE AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT ONE of the requirements was that a pastor had to have his house subject to God not just the man but his CHILDREN HIS HOUSE BECAUSE IF HE COULDN'T RULE his own house, how could he rule the church of God? And Paul, OF COURSE, AND TITUS TALKED ABOUT THE MAN AND HE SAID THAT A PASTOR MUST BE BLAMELESS. THAT IS, YOU CANNOT SAY TRUTHFULLY THAT THIS MAN is running around with women or this man does this or this man lied or this man's done that. He's got to be a blameless position to hold that type of requirement. Is that your Bible? How many knows that your Bible? SO A MAN MUST BE BLAMELESS. AND HE SAYS, "HOW shall he take care of the CHURCH OF GOD? NOT A NOVICE." Now this is one that's immature, one that is not really developed into the right type of character and maturity that is needed for this type OF A POSITION. THIS IS why Paul says this less being lifted up with pride. Lifted up. NOTICE PAUL SAYS THIS GREEK WORD HERE TWOFOLD. HIGH MINDED METAPHORICALLY TO MAKE PROUD puff up with pride. RENDER INSULT TO BLIND WITH pride or conceit. to render foolish or stupid. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MEN THAT MOVE INTO a position like this in the strings that he uses this to describe only onefold of the five-fold ministry? &gt;&gt; He's not talking about evangelist. &gt;&gt; He talking about a teacher. &gt;&gt; Wonder why he only says this about a pastor. CUZ A PASTOR IS GOING to have a little kingdom. Sure. &gt;&gt; And if he's not careful, he'll think it's his. &gt;&gt; But if he's a real servant of God, he realize it ain't his kingdom. It's his kingdom. &gt;&gt; And if anxious to come in and preach at his church, AND THEY SAY, "WELL, THAT'S BROTHER DONNY'S CHURCH, AND THAT'S brother so and so's church, AND THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT people are saying when they say that, but in one way, that ain't the truth. IF THIS CHURCH IS MY CHURCH, we're in a mess of trouble. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. THIS OUGHT TO BE THE CHURCH OF THE LORD JESUS, and I am simply an undersheperd under the great shepherd himself. BUT FRIENDS, THE SAD THING ABOUT IT IS SOME PREACHERS, PASTORS THAT I'VE KNOWN, THAT'S EXACTLY the way they look at it. They are the head, they are the CEO, they are the boss. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Not a novice less being lifted up with &gt;&gt; pride. Pride he fall. I've read this ever since I've been a Christian and I never saw it until this week. lest he fall into condemnation of the devil. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO PREACHERS NOW WHEN THEY GO TO BEING LIFTED UP IN pride and arrogance? They're repeating the same thing &gt;&gt; that happened in heaven. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THEY PLACE THEMSELVES UNDER THE CONDEMNATION, the same condemnation &gt;&gt; of the devil. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE WORD CONDEMNATION. WHAT IT MEANS there judgment, DAMNATION IN a forensic sense. The sentence of A JUDGE, THE PUNISHMENT WITH WHICH ONE IS SENTENCED, PENAL JUDGMENT, SENTENCE A MATTER TO BE JUDICIALLY DECIDED, A LAWSUIT, a case in court. SO PREACHERS THAT BECOME EXALTED AND ALL LIFTED UP HIGH ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE AND ABOVE THE PEOPLE AND ON A PEDESTAL AND YOU'RE HERE TO SERVE ME, that's a life in the pits of hell. A God called man is here to serve you. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THE LORD JESUS WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE US THAT EXAMPLE. THAT'S why he washed his disciples feet. They didn't wash his. &gt;&gt; OH MY. NOT A NOVICE, LEST BEING LIFTED UP WITH PRIDE, HE FALL into the same the same condemnation of the devil. Wow. &gt;&gt; What a dangerous thing to be a preacher. &gt;&gt; What a dangerous thing. &gt;&gt; I've said it before and I'll keep saying it. If a man ain't called, it's one of the worst things that can happen to him. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. NOW, WHY WOULD an inexperienced man, you know, you know as well as I KNOW THAT THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE a novice as far as years, BUT THEY'RE A NOVICE in understanding. THEY'RE A NOVICE IN REVELATION. THEY'RE A NOVICE. WATCH THE decisions they make. AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETIMES OLDER men with novice decisions, which tells you right there, that ain't a LEADER YET. NOW, WHY A NOVICE? BECAUSE A NOVICE IS GOING TO BE weaker in knowledge and understanding, BUT THEY'LL BE STRONG IN THEIR PASSIONS. OH, I WANT TO DO THIS. OH, I WANT TO DO SOMETHING. OF COURSE, IT'S ALL FOR GOD. You know, IT'S ALL FOR GOD. OH, I OH, MAN. WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO YEAH, WE'VE GOT TO got to GOT TO. AND THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR DESIRES JUST OH, I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING. I JUST WANT TO DO something for the people. But they're immature in their graces and their virtues and they lack experience WHICH SHOULD CONSOLIDATE THEIR JUDGMENTS about matters that leaders are going to have to make. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, THEY'RE IN GREAT DANGER of selfexaltation. FOR NONE ARE SO proud as THE CONFIDENT THAT ARE ignorant and injudicious. In other words, they make stupid and foolish judgments &gt;&gt; decisions of how to do this and how to do that and how to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But yet they're so proud and so arrogant. Ignorance will do that to you. &gt;&gt; If the more you know about the word, the bigger you feel about yourself. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what books you're reading. But let me suggest a few for you. How can I overcome would be a good one. He that is in you would be another good one. Holy Ghost series would really be a good one. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE BIGGER WE BECOME, THE MORE DOMINANT THE GREAT GRAY. IT'S NOT THAT IT SHOULD BE. OH MY. THE LONGER WE GO IN GOD AND THE MORE WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE WORD, THE MORE IT SHOULD HUMBLE US, not exalt us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE HERE THE PROPHET SAID, "DID YOU KNOW THAT IN HEAVEN that the devil was God's right-hand man in the beginning? That Lucifer, the son of the morning, was given power. And the REASON THAT HE BROUGHT SIN INTO THE WORLD, HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOMETHING THAT GOD had created and perverted it back into AN EVIL THING WHICH STARTED ALL THIS TROUBLE IN THE BEGINNING. THEN GOD BACK BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD WAS EVER LAID WHEN HE'S SEEN WHAT SATAN DONE IN HIS PRIDE. NOW, the devil didn't GO OVER AND OPEN HEAVEN'S FIRST BAR. And he wasn't OUT THERE WORKING FOR WINSTON, you know, and say, "Hey, you want you want A CIGARETTE, ANGEL?" "YEAH, MAN. I always want to chew that tobacco." Man, a lie. Give me that amber. Oh, man. Alive. Ain't that awesome stuff running out your mouth? Pride. &gt;&gt; Pride. IN HIS PRIDE, HE WENT OVER IN THE NORTH AND SET UP A KINGDOM AND FOUGHT against Michael. Notice now Gabriel Gabriel knew better than to attack this angel. I want you to notice in different appearances of the angels of God in the scripture whenever they would even with Moses body they wouldn't SAY IN THE NAME OF ELOHIM IN THE NAME OF JESUS but they would say the Lord rebuke you the Lord &gt;&gt; rebuke you &gt;&gt; I want you to look and see what the blood of the Lord Jesus has done in the baptism of the Holy Ghost for sons and daughters of God that we can lay our hands on the sick, lay our hands on those that are full of evil spirits. And we can say, "In the name of Jesus, I adure you, come out of them." &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SEE WHAT GOD HAS DONE? DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS HAS DONE? FRIENDS, FOR 2,000 YEARS, THE KINGDOM OF GOD, THAT'S WHY HELL IS TORE ALL THE PIECES BECAUSE THEY'RE SONS OF GOD BACK ON THE EARTH AGAIN THAT CAN STAND IN THE VERY POSITION THAT GOD ORDAINED THEM TO BE. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THAT THE PRAYER OF A SON OF GOD WILL OUTWEIGH AN ANGEL MANY TIMES. WHY THE ANGEL DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY THAT A SON OF GOD DOES. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE THIS. HE SAYS THE RIGHT HAND man of almighty God was Lucifer the son OF THE MORNING THE FIRST GOD GRANTED HIM ALMOST co-workers with him he was a coworker partly equal WITH HIM ONLY SATAN COULD NOT CREATE GOD IS THE ONLY CREATOR but Satan TOOK SOMETHING GOD CREATED AND PERVERTED IT back into something else evil. THEN THESE FALLEN ANGELS, THEY START WORKING IN THE REALM OF DARKNESS. But now remember, they can appear as angels of light. You remember the prophet telling us about the church age messenger, don't you? That appeared to St. Martin and he said, "Martin, I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. Worship me." &gt;&gt; Had a crown on his head. St. Martin looked at him, looked at him, he said, "Martin, DON'T YOU KNOW ME? FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP ME. I'M YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR." And friends, you're talking about a demon. AND THAT DEMON WOULD TAKE ON THE name and THE IDENTITY AND SAY, "I'M THE LORD JESUS." AND PEOPLE THINK JUST THE THE NAME OF JESUS is some type of magical something. DEVILS WON'T SAY IT. YOU DON'T KNOW your Bible very well. IN THAT VISION, THAT DEMON SAID HE WAS THE LORD JESUS AND SAID HE WAS HIS SAVIOR. But thank God St. Martin knew his Bible. &gt;&gt; And he looked at him and said, "Get behind me, Satan. You got a crown on your head. The saints of God's going to crown the Lord Jesus." And that he SAID, "BOY, WOULDN'T THAT BEEN PENTECOSTAL BAIT? I'VE SHARED WITH YOU MANY DIFFERENT TIMES through the years that Carol and I AS WELL KNEW A WOMAN BACK IN PENTECOST AND AN ANGEL." SHE SAID AN ANGEL OF GOD WALKED IN HER BEDROOM ONE night and HER HUSBAND WAS THERE IN WITH HER IN THE BED AND WOKE HER UP. THIS ANGEL DID AND HANDED HER A BIBLE AND TOLD HER SHE WAS CALLED TO PREACH GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT ANGEL DISAPPEARED AND LEFT THAT BIBLE IN THE ROOM. IT WAS NOT THEIR BIBLE. IT WAS NOT A BIBLE THAT THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE. IT WAS NOT A BIBLE THAT ANYBODY EVEN KNEW where it come from. You know what that woman done? Started preaching. &gt;&gt; WHY? SHE TOOK AN EXPERIENCE &gt;&gt; over God's word. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; AN EXPERIENCE OVER GOD'S WORD INSTEAD OF JUDGING THAT DEMON. WHAT WAS IT, BROTHER MATTHEW? IT WAS A DEMON STRAIGHT FROM THE PITS OF HELL. BUT HE WASN'T BREATHING FIRE AND HAD A BIG LONG DRAGON TAIL. HE HAD A BIBLE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YOU IMAGINE A DEMON with a Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. [sighs] Luke 22:53. Jesus says, "When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me, but this is your hour and the power of darkness." John 3:19, "And this is the condemnation that light has come into the world. Men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil." St. John 8:12, then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world, and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. John 12:46, I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide abide. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S WHERE we were before he got a hold of our hearts. &gt;&gt; We were in that realm. Can't you can't YOU SEE THE PEOPLE of the world why they're doing WHAT THEY'RE DOING? WHY THEY'VE GONE INSANE? WHY THEY'RE CRAZY? &gt;&gt; WHY? They live darkness. They eat darkness. They drink darkness. They talk about darkness. THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS CONSUMMATED IN A SPHERE OF DARKNESS. AND WE LOOK AT THEM AND THINK, "WHAT IN THE WORLD'S THE MATTER WITH THEM?" AND THEY IN THE DARKNESS LOOK AT US AND SAY, "THEY'RE A BUNCH OF FANATICS." &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THEY LOOK AT US AND THEY THINK THEY'RE CRAZY. &gt;&gt; Romans 13:12, "The night is far spent. THE DAY IS AT HAND. LET US THEREFORE CAST OFF THE WORKS OF darkness and let us put on the armor of light. 2 CORINTHIANS 4:6. FOR GOD WHO COMMANDED THE LIGHT TO SHINE OUT OF DARKNESS. AMEN. HATH SHINED IN OUR hearts to give the light of the KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLORY OF God in the face of Jesus Christ. 2 CORINTHIANS 6:14. BE YOU NOT UNEQUALLY YOLKED WITH UNBELIEVERS? FOR WHAT FELLOWSHIP HATH RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH UNRIGHTEOUS? WHAT COMMUNION hath light &gt;&gt; WITH DARKNESS? EPHESIANS 5'8. FOR YE WERE [screaming] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES DARKNESS, BUT NOW &gt;&gt; ARE YE LIGHT IN THE LORD. NOTICE HE DOESN'T SAY YOU WERE IN DARKNESS, BUT YOU were darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were darkness. Hallelujah. But aren't you GLAD THERE'S A SEED LAYING DOWN INSIDE OF THAT DARKNESS? YOU DIDN'T REALIZE IT AT THE TIME. AND ALL THE LORD HAD TO DO WAS SPEAK JUST LIKE HE DID OVER THE EARTH. LET THERE BE LIGHT. AND THERE was light. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT NOW ARE YE LIGHT IN THE LORD. NOT IN THE LIGHT, BUT NOW ARE YE LIGHT in the Lord. Walk as children of light. EPHESIANS 5:11. HAVE NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE UNFRUITFUL works of darkness, but rather reprove them. EPHESIANS 6:12, FOR WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD, BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES. SAME WORD WE TALKED A WHILE AGO. WE'RE WRESTLING AGAINST DEMONS. THEY'RE RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. DEMONS, DEMON POWERS TRYING TO ANOINT YOU, GET YOU TO PULL AWAY FROM THE WORD, TRY TO GET YOU TO DOUBT GOD'S PROMISE, TRY TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE THE BAD DOCTOR'S REPORT OVER THE PROMISE OF THE WORD OF GOD, AND YOU'RE WRESTLING WITHIN PRINCIPALITIES. &gt;&gt; OH MY PRINCIPALITIES, AGAINST POWERS, against the rulers of the darkness of THIS WORLD. AGAINST SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH or heavenly places. COLOSSIANS 1:13, WHO HATH DELIVERED US FROM THE POWER OF DARKNESS, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. 1 THESSALONIANS 5:4. BUT YE, BRETHREN, ARE NOT IN DARKNESS THAT THAT DAY SHOULD OVERTAKE YOU AS A THIEF. YE ARE ALL CHILDREN OF LIGHT AND CHILDREN OF THE DAY. WE ARE NOT OF THE NIGHT NOR of darkness. Can the church say amen to them? &gt;&gt; FIRST PETER 2:9. BUT YE ARE A CHOSEN GENERATION, a royal priesthood, A HOLY NATION, A PECULIAR PEOPLE THAT YOU SHOULD SHOW FORTH. AH, you mean when we come to church, when we work, &gt;&gt; WHEN WE DRIVE OUR CAR, when we live our life, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW FORTH PRAISES. We're chosen to do that. &gt;&gt; A peculiar people that YOU SHOULD SHOW FORTH THE PRAISES OF HIM WHO HAS CALLED YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO his marvelous light. FIRST JOHN 2:8 AGAIN, A NEW COMMANDMENT I WRITE UNTO YOU. WHICH THING IS true in him and in you? I love that communion. THAT NEW COMMANDMENT is true in him AND IN YOU. BECAUSE THE DARKNESS IS PASSED, and the true light now shineth. HE THAT SAITH HE IS IN LIGHT AND HATETH HIS BROTHER is in darkness even until now. &gt;&gt; 1 JOHN 2:1. BUT HE THAT HATETH HIS BROTHER IS IN DARKNESS, AND WALKETH IN DARKNESS, AND KNOWETH NOT WHETHER HE GOETH, BECAUSE THAT DARKNESS had blinded his eyes. JUDE VERSE 4. FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN men who flew in. &gt;&gt; They crept. low, &gt;&gt; cunning, deceitful. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't notice me. I'm a nobody. I'm I'm nothing. I don't want anything at all. Just here for fellowship. For there are certain men crept in unawares, crept to enter secretly, slip in stealthily to steal in. And most of the time whenever they steal in, they'll steal out &gt;&gt; and steal what they can on the way out. &gt;&gt; Well, PRAISE THE LORD. BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN MEN CREPT IN OUT OF WARES. BUT NO, I love the way Jude says it. Now remember, Jude was the foster brother of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So he's raised in the same house naturally as Jesus was. But he never even mentions it. Strange. Boy, if it's a message preacher, he said, "I'm the brother of the Lord Jesus." Now, y'all need to hear me now. I'll tell you one thing. I fish with him. I hunted with him. I ate jelly with him. And I ate everything else. Y'all need to hear me because I'm the bishop. I reckon this it's all in the family. Ain't it? I mean, I'm a half brother of the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jew don't even mention it all. We wouldn't even know it if the other guys hadn't talked about it. That's the way a real true servant of God is. FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN MEN CREPT IN UNAWARES WHO WERE BEFORE OF OLD ORDAINED. &gt;&gt; The Lord just said, "Jude, write and pull the hide off of the devil. JUST LET THEM KNOW I'M THE ONE. I'm the one who ordained it." Woo! ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness. SO APOSTATES ARE VERY CRAFTY and subtle, clever ministers. Ministers who he's talking about and they will deceive the naive believers and they will use deception to make it acceptable. You see, evil would be way too easily understood in Saul, even by the simple, IF THERE WAS NOT SUBTLE MEANS BY which deceptive words and deceptive mannerisms. That's exactly what Satan's doing to the world right now. He's just getting them all right in to get them ready for one man leadership. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; OH MY. AND WHAT DO THEY DO? TURNING THE GRACE OF God into lasciviousness. Turning the grace of God into lasciviousness. So they turn grace and they take it around and say, "Well, you know, you you're going to do these things and you can't help it and you can't keep from it." And you know, it's okay. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Hey, as I said, tell you, we've got Christian drug addicts and we've got Christian drunks and we got Christian homosexuals and Christian this and Christian that. And you got these preachers. It's okay. You know, it it's it's sad to say, but we've got some of the message that's heading in the same direction. &gt;&gt; Well, I know you don't know it, but believe me, they are heading in the same direction. Well, God understands, you know, why you can't you can't do it this way. And you know, there's a certain man that I to several several years ago. said, "Brother Donnie, you're not my pastor, but I I really just like to to ask you some questions, and I know you'll be honest with me. I've done this and this and this, and I've lived this way, and I've done that way, and I want you to tell me, do you think I've got the Holy Ghost?" I said, "Absolutely not." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "I figured THAT'S WHAT YOU'D TELL ME." HE SAID, "BUT MY pastor has BEEN TELLING ME THAT I DO." &gt;&gt; Famous message preacher. So would somebody please stand to your feet and tell me what good the Holy Ghost is if it don't keep you from such nonsense and filth. &gt;&gt; Oh, pour it in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; NOTICE, YOU KNOW, SATAN IS SO CUNNING. LORD CHILLING, CAN YOU IMAGINE US WALKING OUT OF THIS BUILDING TONIGHT AND MEETING SUCH AN ENEMY on our own? &gt;&gt; I wouldn't walk out of this building. I just camp out right here. But you know what? If the Lord lets me live, I'm going to go through that door in a little bit. I'm going to put my coat on and I'm going to the house and I ain't going to go out and stick my head out the door and say, "Which way did he go? Which way did he go? Oh no. Oh no. The bad old devil. That mean old devil. Oh, he's going to do this, that, and other." No, that ain't the way I'm going. I'm watching. I say, "Look out, devil. Here I come. Here I come, devil. I DONE BEEN EQUIPPED BY THE WORD OF GOD." GOD DON'T JUST WANT THE PASTOR TO BE THAT WAY. GOD WANTS YOU LEOTY TO BE THAT WAY. I AIN'T TALKING ABOUT LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT IF TROUBLE SHOWS UP, MAKE TROUBLE REGRET THAT IT KNOCKED ON YOUR DOOR. IF TROUBLE COMES AND FEAR COMES AND DOUBT COME AND FRUSTRATION COME, MAKE [screaming] DOUBT GO DOWN TO HELL. OH, HALLELUJAH. CRYING, I MEAN, AND A WHIMPERING LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SAID, "BOY, I WISH I'D never went to her house. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love these next paragraphs here that we're going to read. And Christ the mystery. Love one another above everything. &gt;&gt; Love one another. No matter what the devil tries to say. You're all one great big sweet group now. But remember my warning. Satan won't let that stay that way. &gt;&gt; Has it happened? &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. HE'LL SHOOT EVERYTHING IF HE HAS TO BRING SOMEBODY in to make his target. He'll bring some critic or unbeliever in, set him down, cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things, and then he'll shoot. That guy was some kind of a poison stuff. &gt;&gt; And he'll start through the church with it. &gt;&gt; Friends, we've had one after another after another after another around this precious message around the world. And you know who a lot of them have been? Preachers. &gt;&gt; And Satan studied him and said, "Yep, he's like me." So he pulls his hammer back And the preacher barely even felt it. Barely even felt it at all because it so harmonizes with his own ego. &gt;&gt; And the devil shot a dart of poison in him and the poison starts running through his body, his nature, his soul, his makeup. &gt;&gt; Then Satan will put people around him and boy, they go to lifting him up. Boy, ain't nobody preaches what you preach. &gt;&gt; Boy, I'll tell you one thing. You got bigger miracles than anybody. Man alive. Ain't nobody can sing like you sing. Ain't nobody can shake that leg like you shake yours. LORD HAVE MERCY. I AIN'T NEVER seen nobody shake that leg that way. Oh boy. And that poison goes to running through him. And yeah, he's getting bigger and bigger. And then somebody else will come up to him. Oh brother, I've been around for 85 years around this message. I ain't never heard nobody preach like you. You're just this and that and the other and his head's getting so big it won't go through the double doors in the front. Why? The poisons &gt;&gt; kicked in. &gt;&gt; It ain't just preachers that does that. Singers can do it, too. &gt;&gt; Musicians can do it. &gt;&gt; You're gonna get me fired one of these days, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying. He'll shoot him. Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; AND CAUSE HIM TO FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU UNDER THE quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start to the church. Look, it's not just limited to a church. It can happen to a family. &gt;&gt; You watch one family member get OUT OF SYNC WITH GOD, IT CAN TEAR THAT WHOLE FAMILY ALL TO PIECES. ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN or a husband or a wife or a nephew or A NIECE OR WHATEVER IT IS, THEY GET ALL TORE UP AND OH MY THE WHOLE FAMILY JUST THEY THEY CAN'T GO TO CHURCH NO MORE. THEY'VE ALL GOT TO STAY HOME WITH THAT ONE AND THEY'VE OH LORD I DON'T WHAT WE'RE GOING TO OH LORD HAVE MERCY. OH LORD, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The devil got him in his sight &gt;&gt; and he's got a silencer on his gun. So he just goes, "Oh, &gt;&gt; that must have been a mosquito or in my case, a wasp." Smack. Oh, it's just a wasp. And then they start changing. &gt;&gt; The poison. And they go to hearing things. &gt;&gt; Boy, you've got so many views on YouTube. I go over there and check brother so and so and see how many he's got. &gt;&gt; What I saw our church has got more than anybody in this day and age. I'm not so sure that's too much to brag about. &gt;&gt; Cuz the more you're known, the bigger your target is on your back. &gt;&gt; Oh, DON'T TAKE SIDES WITH IT. DON'T YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ELSE. You stay right, loving &gt;&gt; and sweet and kind, which is the treatment against poison. &gt;&gt; Cuz you watch division and and and all these things that comes in a family or a church or a message community and it'll work the exact opposite of true love, forgiveness, fellowship, harmony. People that used TO BE THE BEST OF FRIENDS, once the poison starts circulating, they'll no longer even speak to one another. &gt;&gt; Families will be divided &gt;&gt; and separated. &gt;&gt; Used to go to the same church, say amen to the same preacher, shout, "Take communion together." Now they don't even want to be seen together. &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie. NOW NOTICE HE SAYS STAY RIGHT LOVING AND SWEET and kind one another and pray for that man that he'll be saved too. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; So you mean a man that's been shot with poison needs prayer &gt;&gt; that he'll be saved? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying he's not a Christian now, man or woman, whichever it is, but they need salvation from that poison, &gt;&gt; lest it kills them. &gt;&gt; Children, don't you understand why some of these people that have left the message and they're taking on such anger, such hatred? THEY HATE THE MESSAGE PREACHERS. THEY HATE TO PROFIT. THEY HATE THE MESSAGE. THEY'VE changed so much. &gt;&gt; But here's why. &gt;&gt; They've been shocked. &gt;&gt; They hate. They despise. &gt;&gt; Pray for them. &gt;&gt; AND NOTICE HE SAYS, "PRAY FOR THEM AND STICK TOGETHER. STAY WITH YOUR PASTOR. SEE, he's the shepherd. GIVE HIM RESPECTS. HE'LL LEAD YOU through cuz he's ordained of God to do so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know what becomes very difficult? When the pastor is the one that's been shot &gt;&gt; and then the pastor gets bitter or proud. Just depends on the toxine that the devil mixed in the shot. &gt;&gt; Anger won't work for every preacher. Pride won't work for every preacher. So, Satan mixes it up. Give them a little dose of this and a little bit of that and a little bit of that and a little bit of that and then oh must sweat me or something. Just tell me I'm too. And then the next service is different and the next one is different. Then he goes into THE VICTIM MENTALITY. EVERYBODY'S OUT TO GET ME. IT'S BECAUSE OUR CHURCH IS SO RIGHT. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES RIGHT. I'M PREACHING THE TRUTH. OH. I thought Paul said we don't preach ourselves. &gt;&gt; If you take men out of their own sermons, I'm not sure how much some of them would have to preach. &gt;&gt; I done this, I done that, or people's doing this against me or that against me. Why don't you tell me what Jesus has done? &gt;&gt; Won't you tell me how big my God is? Won't you TELL ME HOW BIG OUR GOD IS GOING TO HELP US TO OVERCOME? I I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT YOUR TROUBLES AND YOUR TRIALS. SURE, TESTIFY ABOUT IT EVERY NOW AND THEN, BUT TELL ME HOW BIG GOD IS THROUGH YOUR TROUBLES. TELL ME HOW BIG GOD IS THROUGH YOUR TRIALS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now watch the next paragraph. The prophet says, "Now remember that question mark congregation says &gt;&gt; amen." &gt;&gt; It's amazing though how many message people will remember the quote. But when it comes to the practicality of just following the above two quotes, they do the exact opposite. Something will come in their family, something will come in the church, and they'll side right with it. &gt;&gt; So say it. It shows how easy sheep are to be deceived. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost. But you're still a sheep. &gt;&gt; I do you remember that congregation says, "AMEN. THE ENEMY WILL COME." And when he does, &gt;&gt; you just cling that much closer together. &gt;&gt; And the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you. Now, you see the thing of it is none of us have a special pair of glasses or a magnifying glass to be able to look down in somebody's soul and say, "Serpent seed, seed of God, serpent seed, seed of God, seed of God, seed of God, serpent seed, serpent." They none of us can DO THAT. &gt;&gt; OH, SOME PEOPLE ALL THEY NEED is deliverance from the poison. &gt;&gt; AND THEY CAN BE YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR SISTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT TAPES ON THAT. YOU'VE GOT TAPES ON WHAT WE BELIEVE. YOU'VE GOT TAPES ON DISCIPLINE IN THE CHURCH. HOW WE BEHAVE OURSEL IN THE CHURCH OF GOD. HOW WE'VE GOT to &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; Now that's done up on the screen. I guess I'm gonna have to read it. Oh, &gt;&gt; wonder why we didn't cut that out and just kind of leave that out. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO COME TOGETHER &gt;&gt; AND SIT TOGETHER IN HEAVENLY PLACES. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; How about y'all reading these next FEW WORDS WITH ME? DON'T STAY HOME. [applause] IF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS A lot of the problem. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; God ain't in some FOLKS HEART. IF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART, YOU CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM DOORS. OH, GLORY. TO OPEN OUT YONDER AGAIN. AND YOU'RE TO FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR BROTHERS. IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT WAY, THEN I TELL YOU, IT'S time you got to praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see what fallen angels have done? &gt;&gt; Fallen angels have crept into every message that God ever sent on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Before that truth could go on and proclamate. I won't read it to you. I'll quote it to you. Before that truth could go on and proclamate fallen angels got into it. What? He said fallen Lutheran, fallen Methodist, fallen Pentecostals. Let's complete the sequence, shall we? Fallen message people. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus. Let's jump down here to paragraph 86 and we'll close. If the brother you think is a little wrong or the sister say, "Lord," don't never let the root of bitterness spring up &gt;&gt; cuz it'll affect him. It'll take the Christ &gt;&gt; right out &gt;&gt; of my life. &gt;&gt; Not drinking, friends. Not adultery. Bitterness. Bitterness against God. Bitterness against a preacher, bitterness against a brother or sister, family member, whatever. Bitterness will take the Christ right out of you. BUT BROTHER DONNIE, IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD. I know it's hard. But it's it's attainable. Or God would not have anointed his prophet to say this. &gt;&gt; If it was impossible, no. Ain't no way. I understand. Ain't no way you'll get hurt so bad. There ain't no way you can get let bitterness will take every one of you. No, there's a way that we can live and be hurt and wounded by great people. &gt;&gt; And then the opportunity is there. And remember angels of light and angels of darkness and they will come and anoint your bitterness. Remember Paul identified it well. He didn't call it a leaf, a branch. He did not call it bark, but he called it a root &gt;&gt; which is hid under the dirt. &gt;&gt; So it can be hid very deep. It grows and it grows. It's getting bigger and bigger. And the bigger it gets, the more of Christ, the anointed word life it squeezes out of your life. Oh Jesus, it'll take the Christ right out of my life. That poison acids of malice, jealousy, and hatred will take the Holy Spirit. right away from you. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of our message people are trying to live this message life and this kind of situation right here. &gt;&gt; Bitterness, jealousy, envy, strife, malice, and they don't understand why they can't live it. Because they've grieved their power out of their lives. &gt;&gt; They've grieved their power. You won't overcome this just by quotes. YOU WON'T OVERCOME THIS BY ATTENDING CHURCH. Your personal power is your baptism in you. And if Satan can cause you to do this, you'll grieve away your own power. And there you stand there quoting the word, quoting the word, quoting the prophet, quoting the prophet. [panting] [gasps] But you're getting so weak quoting the word the whole time. And you're thinking, "WHY AIN'T IT WORKING? WHY AIN'T IT WORKING? WHY AIN'T IT WORKING?" Because she ain't got no power. &gt;&gt; It's just logos. And it's not Rama word. And this is why people say, "I guess it ain't for me. &gt;&gt; I guess I'll just leave. I tried it. I did my best." No. If you don't keep bitterness out, you ain't done your best. &gt;&gt; Let's close. Notice this. I don't I don't I don't understand, friends. I honestly don't understand. Why don't our message preachers preach these things? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I know they're not deep. I know it's not convincing things. I I know people don't want this stuff. They want they want something that oh boy, everybody can leave. Oh my, just soaring in the heavens. I wonder sometimes if we had right down where we live if we couldn't soar higher after the meeting is over. the poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It will run him from the tabernacle here. &gt;&gt; Brother Random is at his own church. &gt;&gt; And now the tabernacle is sitting empty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can go for Wednesday night and have silent prayer. Wonder where the Holy Ghost is. &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost, Brother Skip, that used to discern their hearts and raise the dead and cast out devils. &gt;&gt; So, is that what you want for our church? &gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT WE MESSAGE PEOPLE WANT FOR OUR CHURCHES? &gt;&gt; That would just grieve the Holy Spirit away by these non deep things. &gt;&gt; It'll run him from the tabernacle. It'll kill the spirit of God or drive him from here. hurt your pastor, it'll do everything. Don't do that. Let's bow our heads together. My friends, we can't do this on our own. We can't do it by self-help books. We don't want to turn the message into self-help. And we come and educate oursel. We've got to have power to live this life. I don't want just power to cast out devils, power to lay hands on the sick and then recover. I want power to live this word. &gt;&gt; Make the word manifest in our lives. I'll probably I I'll not be a great guy. I'll never have too old to start having that type of ambition myself. If I can just let the Lord live some of these simple things I what I preach to you tonight, I'll be a happy person to stand before God, to love, to pray for those who despitefully use me, for those who tell lies on you, and that doesn't need the same way, to be able to turn the other cheek, to be able to pray for those that would actually kill me if they could, and yet feel compassion. passion for him in your heart. How many wants to be like that? That's the Lord Jesus, friends. That's the Lord Jesus. As we've been preaching on Sunday about partakers of the divine nature, that's what he wants us to have. So, the spirit of God in us will recognize Satan's poison darts. Oh, he's aimed these darts at me. Yes, sir. He's aimed them at me. You better believe he has. But God's given me a shield, and by his grace, he's helped me through the years. If it was not for the grace of God, friends, where would we be tonight? Some of you have been lied to. You've been mistreated by preachers. You've been treated awful. And yet, by the help of the Lord, you've not let it turn you and make you bitter. And you ain't got nothing to brag about on that. God has helped you. God has helped you. What good does it do if we quote the seals and the thunders and the church ages? We look down our noses at all the denominations and we have so much bitterness in our hearts and our homes, our churches. Brother Don, you don't know what people's done to me. You're right. I don't. And let me just say that other way around to you. You don't know what people's done to me either. I've been treated worse by preachers, I dare say, than probably about everybody here. Maybe Brother Benton because he's lived longer than I have. So what do you want me to do? Stand up and tell you about each one of them? Why should I waste my time about such? Let's move on. Let's pray for them. Let's love Jesus said, "By this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you love one another." And he said, "I give you a new commandment that ye should love one another as I have loved you." Actually, if you know your Bible very well, you know Leviticus, the law of the Torah, told them to love one another. But it told them to love one another as they love theirel. But Jesus commandment was new in this way. He didn't tell us to love each other as we love oursel. But he told us to love others as he loved. And he loved us more than himself. You see, this is the new commandment that we actually love others more than ourselves. So, we have a right to be angry. They said this about us and they run us down. We have a right to get back at them and a right to do this and that and the other. But as sheep, we forfeit those rights. Then we're loving like Jesus. Oh my. Heavenly Father, as we come to a close of a of another service and to another year in a few hours by the Roman calendar. And we know, Lord, that people will be making New Year's resolutions. And for many of them, they didn't even keep last year's. And they'll just make another one, and it'll be empty. And some of them will go out and get drunk tonight and they'll do all kinds of things and send out fireworks and but Lord, I pray the fireworks would be inside of us tonight. &gt;&gt; May there be explosions of new life and new light and new understanding, Lord, that we would have a greater desire in 2026 to be more like you. We long, Father, to be like you. As your prophet said, we long for those apostolic times moving among us. And he said, we see them, but we want more of them, but we don't just want to do signs and wonders. We want to love like you loved. We want to be able to forgive like you forgave. As a matter of fact, you forgave those Roman soldiers and they never even asked you to. You just said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do." I ain't talking about being soft pansies and cowards, but I'm talking about standing firm and solid. But when we've done that, we can take your behavior as our own. Lord, help us, Jesus. I need you too much, Lord, to be shot with Satan's poison and let it grow into bitterness or anger or strife or wrath or emulation. I need power in my life. Lord, I would be terrified to walk out these doors tonight just with my Bible under my arm and the quotes that I've committed to my memory. But it won't be but just a few more settings of the sun till my memory will start to leave me. And if I'm only serving and overcoming by memory, what will happen when I get older and I can't remember? But that power will never leave me even if my memory does. Lord Jesus, we need you tonight, Father. We worship you, Lord. We worship you, Lord Jesus. Can we just stand our feet? [snorts] How many by the grace of God to enter into this new year to be more like Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To forgive and love. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's any bitterness in you tonight, any jealousy, strife, whatever, let the Lord help you. You say, "But I can't do it. It's greater than me." Well, there's angels right here tonight in this building. &gt;&gt; We'll get to it. I'll show you where brother said that they was there to help. There was healing angels that was sent to bring people healing. Angels there to encourage angels to help do things that was beyond our human capability. So if it's greater than you tonight, there's angels of mercy. There's angels of God that can come. If demons can bring hate, don't you think the angels of God can help come and reverse that &gt;&gt; and help us that we can leave this place, not with a New Year's resolution that we cannot keep, &gt;&gt; but with just a sincere desire before God. Lord, I want to be more like you. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for my carnality. Forgive me for my failures in 2025. How many's had them? &gt;&gt; How many Megan, you reckon? All kinds of them, right? So, you figure in 26 we ain't going to have no more mistakes. Not unless the rapture takes place before 12:00. There ain't no way we're going to we're going to have them. &gt;&gt; But the thing's going to be how we're going to deal with him. We're going to make them right before the Lord &gt;&gt; and ask God to help us and strengthen us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you mind praying for each other? I shared a quote today that that I found where brother pro brother Brandham would said I wish you a blessful and happy and blessed new year and may God you know you be able to grow and all those things that that's what we want to wish tonight that God will help us to be better people more consecrated I pray you'd forgive me for my mistakes and my failures as your pastor, if I've done anything to you or said anything to you, I ain't apologizing for the word now. I ain't going to apologize for that. But if I've done something to you, I pray you find it in your heart to forgive me. I pray if there's a brother or sister here that has offended you or hurt you, that you'll find it in your heart to forgive them. Maybe there's someone in another state, another preacher, another church, or something another, and they treated you bad. I pray you can find it in your heart to be able to forgive them. For I'm reminded of the words of the Lord Jesus. For if you forgive not men or their trespasses, neither will your heavenly father forgive yours. And then the prophet when he reads that and he preaches perfect faith and he says, so we find then faith is based on forgiveness. Brother Joe, would you come and pray? Pray for saints. I'll go down and pray for you. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we know you to be so many things and &gt;&gt; the wealth of attributes which exist in who you are. During the times that we come and are faced with these circumstances of life that we think are impossible and uncsurmountable. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; we call on you tonight, oh God, to release those attributes unto us, Father. &gt;&gt; For Lord, our words are frail. Our abilities are limited. &gt;&gt; But oh God, we're seeking you to help us during these times, oh God. And &gt;&gt; Lord, as I was sitting here at the beginning of service, I couldn't help but think of Mary. Lord, just a young girl who received a visitation by an angel who were saying things to her that she couldn't quite understand. &gt;&gt; But oh God, &gt;&gt; that little girl in her youth, &gt;&gt; in her simple understanding, she simply gave the word you her body. And oh God, &gt;&gt; because of that surrender, because of that ability to say yes, Father, it changed the entire world. So Lord, that helps me to know that when we as believers, we as this little bride, this little girl bride, as I can say it that way, Lord, if we would simply submit and give to you our bodies, what you could do in our world, oh God, you can take and change situations and circumstances. And maybe there would be someone here tonight or by way of of streaming and we get the the message later. Father, they they not going to be able to uh go any further in the situation that's before them. And rightfully so in in looking at it with a human perspective, Lord. Truly, there is nothing more that they could do. So Lord, all that we can do, Father, all that they can do is simply say yes. Be it unto me, Lord, according to that word that we've heard tonight from the voice of your servant. So, Father, may we set aside everything that we thought that we had could do. May we set aside everything that we think that we are able to do and simply, Lord, lay ourselves prostate before you, Father God. Lord, saying that there's nothing in ourselves that we bring, but we simply cling to your cross. Oh God, forgive us, Father, of our failures. Forgive us of our weakness and why we're here in time. As our pastors already said, Lord, we're going to fail. We're going to make mistakes. But a just man, when he falls, a just woman when she falls, when she stumbles, when he stumbles, he picks himself up. She picks herself up, dust himself off, and they just go in the strength that only you can give, Father. So come and fill this room tonight, oh father, by your with your presence to do the impossible to speak, oh God, things that only you can speak. Oh God, forgive us, oh Lord. Come and receive us in that spirit. Lord, in that humility, Lord, we come humbly. We come quietly. We come reverently. Father, we come asking boldly just as Esther did that day. Lord, if you would say no, we're still going to come, oh God, because that's what you've told us to do over and over and over again. Lord, we're knocking. Lord, we're we're we're begging. Lord, we're looking unto you, the author and the finisher of our faith, the completer of everything that you have said that we would be. Father, grant it, Lord, through the very confession of our lips. Father, be it unto us according to your word. We love you. We thank you. We honor you. We adore you, Father. With our lips, we praise you, Father. &gt;&gt; When in the presence and company of angels here in this sanctuary, in this room, Father, we say this night, Lord, as we enter into a new year, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're asking that you would be the provider of everything that we have need of. We're asking that you would be the instructor of every avenue down which we would walk. We ask that you would be the the giver of of every question that we may have, Lord, in this coming year. If sickness is standing in our way, we've gotten a report from the doctor that we don't know what to do, Lord. We look unto you. You are the author. You are the finisher of all things. We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're standing in the need of prayer. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not my mother. It's not my father. It's not my sister. It's not my brother. But, Lord, it's me. once again letting you know that we have needs. Oh God, we're in need of you. May you just come, Father God, in the sweetness in your presence, Father, fill this place. &gt;&gt; May you just come and fill every fiber of our being. We submit it to you once again, oh God. Oh, lamb of God, we just love you and we thank you for what you're going to do. Granted, Lord, as the prophet has told us, Lord, we don't want to turn over a new leaf in the new year because the winds of time, the winds of life may come and blow that leaf over, but Lord, we're coming unto you, &gt;&gt; Lord. There may be a season &gt;&gt; in only the way that we know how. We thank you for the word tonight. And may it accomplish that that it set forth to do. &gt;&gt; We love you and we thank you. &gt;&gt; May we take &gt;&gt; Amen. We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, set our hearts on fire. I pray, Lord God. I need [singing] you. Oh, I need thee to church to be set on fire. Every hour I need thee. [singing] Oh, bless me now. My savior. [singing] I come [singing] to thee. I need thee.

In need strength for the new year, &gt;&gt; courage, &gt;&gt; faith, help. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed. Don't be ashamed to let your needs and your requests be known. &gt;&gt; Lord God, I need you more than ever. I need your wisdom to guide your people. I can't do it, Lord. Sometimes the burdens gets so heavy, Father. I think I can't do it no more. I think I can't have another interview. I think I can't call somebody in another country. I think I can't answer another email. I can't answer another text, another WhatsApp. Dear God, I get bombarded day in and day out. But yet, Lord Jesus, I can stand here tonight and testify. Not one time have you ever failed me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You sure can't say the same thing about me. I'm so glad, oh Lord, I can say about you. You are faithful. &gt;&gt; You are faithful and you have been all of my life. &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. How many loves him tonight with all your heart? Can we just raise our hands? Oh, thank God for the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; For the goodness of God. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Hallelujah. We worship you tonight, Father.

Lord Jesus, thank you tonight. Father, we're so grateful for your mercy to us. Father, may we take these things and ponder over them and think about them. Lord, we need your help, Father, to be able to manifest this word. We know the type of woman you take from this world in a rapture will speak of your own character. So if you take one person that's a liar, one person that's a trickster, one person that's a deceiver, a thief, that shows the type of God you are. Oh, sure. Islam can serve that kind of God because in their own book, it says that Allah himself lies &gt;&gt; and Allah himself tells them it's okay to lie. Well, that shows their God is not the God of truth. &gt;&gt; But you'll not take one liar, one thief, only the elect of God, those that are sanctified in your presence. That's the type of people we want to be. We hope and pray 2026 will be the year of the rapture. But if not, we'll still be faithful in 27 and 28 and 29 and on and on until it comes. We love you, Lord Jesus. Go with us now, Father. Be with us. Bring us back again Sunday if it be pleasing to you, Lord. We commit our lives to you now, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody will be happy over there. &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together as we go. Can you say, "It's been good to be in the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, there's a happy land of promise over in the great [music] beyond [singing] where the saved lovers shall soon glory share where the souls [music] of men shall enter and live on forever more. Everybody [music] will be happy. Oh, I said everybody [music] will be happy. Will be [music] happy. Oh, we [music] will shout and sing God's praise. Everybody [music] will be happy over there. [singing] Well, there will [music] no man praying and no mourning in that lamb for no burdens there will be for [music] us to bear. All the people will be singing glory, glory [music] to the lamb. Won't that be awesome? Everybody will be happy over there. [music] Well, everybody [singing] will be [music] happy. Will be happy. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat [music] [music] up here. [music] Heat &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; up here. Heat [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
