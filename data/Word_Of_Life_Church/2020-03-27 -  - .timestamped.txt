[11:47] [Music]
[11:52] [Applause]
[11:59] well I'm sure that we all certainly
[12:01] believe that tonight is closer than it's
[12:03] ever been before we can certainly look
[12:06] around and see all the things that are
[12:09] happening in the time that we're living
[12:10] most of us I'm sure did not think that
[12:13] would ever be having Church quite like
[12:15] this you'd be living your life at home
[12:18] if you're not able to go to work and
[12:21] able to go here and there only the Lord
[12:23] knows actually what the future holds but
[12:27] I'm so glad we may not know exactly ever
[12:29] twist and turn in the road well we know
[12:31] who holds our future we're sort of
[12:33] grateful for that we'll read together
[12:36] tonight Psalms 91 it seems to be so
[12:40] fitting for for where we are brother
[12:43] Daryl really ready or rather on Sunday
[12:46] and did such a wonderful job on it and
[12:48] someone had text me and said that they
[12:51] had streamed by the very coffee on
[12:53] Sunday morning and he had read Psalms 91
[12:57] and then streamed a little bit of
[12:59] brother Tim put them in Louisiana and
[13:01] the Timothy I think maybe had read
[13:03] Psalms 91 so we're gonna read it again
[13:06] tonight so apparently it's it's
[13:08] something that's very fitting for us we
[13:10] know that it's any portion of the Word
[13:12] of God of course it's wonderful and
[13:13] great but we believe that there's a
[13:15] season to God's Word and we're grateful
[13:18] for the brothers has come out to be able
[13:20] to make this available for those of you
[13:22] that are streaming out once and once
[13:24] that brothers are so appreciate you you
[13:26] coming out and we'll do this as long as
[13:28] as long as necessary to be able to get
[13:30] us through this time Psalms 19:1 one he
[13:34] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[13:35] Most High shall abide under the shadow
[13:38] of the Almighty I will say of the Lord
[13:41] he is my refuge and my fortress my god
[13:44] in him will I trust surely he shall
[13:47] deliver thee from the snare of the
[13:50] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[13:52] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[13:54] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[13:58] truth shall be thy shield
[14:01] buckler and verse five thou shalt not be
[14:04] afraid for the terror by night nor for
[14:07] the arrow that flies that day we're
[14:11] going to pray and we want to remember
[14:12] all these requests that brother Louie
[14:15] had mentioned I'm sure those of you that
[14:17] are streaming tonight you have different
[14:18] things and maybe your your your job
[14:20] situation is uncertain many many things
[14:23] but remember friends even in the time of
[14:26] great trouble our God is mindful of his
[14:29] people he knew this hour would come upon
[14:32] us we certainly did and it caught most
[14:34] of us I'm sure by surprise our nation is
[14:37] caught by surprise as well as the world
[14:39] is but it's not surprising to our Lord
[14:41] so let's just pray together Heavenly
[14:44] Father as we bow our heads or Jesus
[14:46] we're grateful Lord that we would have
[14:49] this opportunity to be able to call upon
[14:50] your name once again thank you for the
[14:53] brothers Lord that have been willing to
[14:54] assemble themselves together here
[14:56] tonight to be able to make the service
[14:58] available for all those that are
[14:59] streaming and Lord how our hearts longed
[15:01] to be able to see one another and it
[15:03] makes us feel very sad Lord we can't see
[15:07] our brothers and sisters and be able to
[15:09] meet here like this but father we just
[15:11] pray that you'd strengthen us and help
[15:13] us and Lord that you'd give us grace to
[15:15] were able to do it again Lord
[15:18] we thank you Father for your grace and
[15:20] mercy to us it extends even in trouble
[15:22] sometimes Lord these prayer requests
[15:24] that brother Louie read we ask that you
[15:25] be mindful of them tonight no doubt
[15:27] hundreds of them that were out across
[15:30] those that are streaming the service and
[15:31] we just pray that you'd be mindful of
[15:33] them Lord there's uncertainty in our
[15:35] country in our world
[15:36] uncertainty in our economy uncertainty
[15:38] in our jobs uncertainty ever will be
[15:40] look what we're so glad there's no
[15:42] uncertainty in our God
[15:43] well pray that should help us tonight in
[15:45] the service help me father to be able to
[15:47] get out of the way pray Lord that you
[15:50] just helped me to surrender myself to
[15:51] you that you can speak through me Lord
[15:53] to your children father we're hungry
[15:56] tonight even though we're not able to
[15:58] gather together so we normally do people
[16:00] sitting around their phones or tablets
[16:02] or computers wherever they are at work
[16:04] or at home and lord they're hungry
[16:06] they've got needs they've got something
[16:07] inside of them Lord so we pray that you
[16:10] just be mindful of us we know this is
[16:11] different for us
[16:13] but we're asking you that you would just
[16:14] compensate for the difference Lord and
[16:16] minister to us would your father in the
[16:19] name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen
[16:22] god bless you you can be seated you
[16:24] brothers thank you all so much I want to
[16:28] speak to you if you're just just a
[16:30] little while tonight on on this simple
[16:32] salt don't fear little sister most of
[16:36] you know the story you know where it
[16:37] comes from so I'll not really go into
[16:39] much detail of the story but it was one
[16:42] of a little girl and her brother and her
[16:43] family being down in in the caverns and
[16:46] the guide turns off the light and little
[16:49] brother sees it and the little girl
[16:51] starts screaming and going into
[16:53] hysterics the Prophet said but the
[16:55] little brother spoke up and said don't
[16:57] fear little sister there's a man here
[16:59] who can turn on the light I believe
[17:01] truly if there's an hour that we need to
[17:04] be conscious of that it is the hour that
[17:06] we're living in we a week or two ago
[17:09] you know whenever we started hearing
[17:11] more and more and more about this virus
[17:13] coming into our nation and affecting
[17:15] more and more people I'm sure that most
[17:17] of us saw oh well maybe it's hype maybe
[17:19] it's this that the other and no doubt a
[17:21] lot of it is high a lot of it is to
[17:24] scare and the fear and to me one of the
[17:26] greatest pandemics is fear itself and
[17:28] not the virus but yet I believe the Lord
[17:31] wants us to be sensible I believe he
[17:32] wants us to do everything we can if you
[17:35] read about the life of Martin Luther
[17:36] during the time of the great plagues is
[17:38] struck in their land while they were
[17:39] living also John Alexander Dowie many
[17:42] great people that have lived down
[17:43] through different time frames that have
[17:45] dealt with different pandemics it's been
[17:47] on the world they did everything they
[17:49] could
[17:50] they prayed they went to church they
[17:52] assembled when they forbid them to
[17:53] assemble they did not assemble but yet
[17:56] they done everything in their power to
[17:58] be able to keep on going with what the
[18:00] church was called to do and I believe
[18:02] that's what the Lord wants us to do as
[18:04] his body now whenever we look at where
[18:07] we are and we think you know what an
[18:08] occasion that it is for the Spirit of
[18:11] God within us to be able to rise to the
[18:13] our true - we all have needs we have
[18:15] needs right here tonight those brothers
[18:17] that are here all of you that are
[18:18] streaming their service no doubt you
[18:20] have needs but we know that our God is
[18:23] not bankrupt just because there's no
[18:25] doubt people now that's per
[18:26] than ain't parading years there's
[18:28] probably a message folks that are that
[18:29] are long in for the day when they can
[18:31] come back to Happy Valley no doubt we'll
[18:33] see a revival of backsliders but you
[18:35] know most of them you know sure how long
[18:37] they last but what I wanted to be is a
[18:39] revival for the real word born-again
[18:41] Christians and we know that sometimes
[18:43] the Lord will actually use tumult and
[18:46] trouble and times like this to be able
[18:48] to stir some of these people so I thank
[18:51] God for it whether you have to pull them
[18:52] out of the fire where they're able to
[18:53] come just by hearing the word and
[18:55] recognize it either ways fine with me
[18:57] but what I like to focus on tonight if
[18:59] the Lord would help us is these
[19:00] wonderful things in the scripture that
[19:02] David had experienced himself now
[19:05] remember David was the chosen of God and
[19:07] he was God's God's elected King but
[19:10] David was a man of many errors and he
[19:12] was a man of grave mistakes and David
[19:15] what we're going to read about tonight
[19:16] had experienced it himself in a very
[19:19] close proximity of his own life when
[19:22] David went to riding as we'll get to it
[19:24] about pestilence and terror and things
[19:27] that would come david had experienced
[19:29] that in his own life you remember who
[19:31] never david numbered the people and
[19:34] Satan moved on David's heart the Bible
[19:36] says and whenever Satan moved on him he
[19:39] moved on him to count the people of
[19:41] Israel now God had already told him
[19:43] don't count them you don't need to know
[19:45] how many they are because how many ever
[19:47] you've got I'm greater than all of that
[19:50] but yet he which was Satan moved upon
[19:53] David and David went out and they began
[19:55] to count the people as soon as he did it
[19:57] then the Spirit of God moved upon his
[20:00] seer and told him because you have done
[20:02] this you've disobeyed me then God gave
[20:04] him a choice of three things so I said
[20:07] I'll choose the mercy of God immediately
[20:09] a plague one out from the presence of
[20:12] the Lord now what's amazing is whenever
[20:14] David is the very man that actually
[20:17] calls this plague to come but when the
[20:20] plague come it never struck David but
[20:24] the Bible tells us 70,000 people of the
[20:29] children of Israel failed in one day now
[20:33] you say what a peculiar saying that God
[20:36] did
[20:37] but now you and I read this in the Bible
[20:39] and we think but that's not even fair it
[20:41] makes no sense all but you see we're
[20:43] reading it from this side of the book no
[20:46] doubt a lot about them seventy thousand
[20:48] people as hard-headed stubborn
[20:50] rebellious and just waiting for a time
[20:53] for the judgment of God to strike them
[20:54] you see god correlates all of his
[20:57] program together and David saw a
[21:00] thousand fault at one hand and ten
[21:02] thousand fall in his other head but it
[21:05] never even come nigh to David's dwelling
[21:09] so when David is going to write about
[21:11] this in Psalms 91 he's not just writing
[21:14] about something that he had not
[21:16] experienced and we all know how that is
[21:18] whenever we experience something I
[21:20] remember many many years ago whenever
[21:22] Carol and I Alicia the little girl four
[21:24] time Erica wasn't even born and we lived
[21:26] in the state of West Virginia and we
[21:28] lived up in a holler and we all think
[21:30] you have the hollers here no hollers
[21:32] like they had there and it was so far
[21:34] back in the hollers that the son never
[21:37] even hit the front porch Harry was there
[21:39] so he never remembers what it was it was
[21:41] so far back up in the sticks that the
[21:44] front porch was never touched by the Sun
[21:46] so you had a little bit of daylight
[21:48] right up here whenever that open window
[21:51] there in the trees but Larry might have
[21:52] been near that place and there was an
[21:54] abandoned coal mine right in front of it
[21:56] would report our car so I've been out in
[21:59] several weeks of services and come back
[22:01] in and the devil attacked my body one
[22:04] night it was a mysterious type of saying
[22:06] just hit me all of a sudden I got
[22:08] deathly sick I couldn't hardly breathe
[22:10] Carol finally helped me get to the bed I
[22:12] never didn't know exactly what it was
[22:14] and we was crying and praying calling on
[22:16] the name of the Lord nobody there didn't
[22:18] have cell phones of course and I told
[22:20] her I said get your Bible get your Bible
[22:22] and I want you to open up to Psalms 91 I
[22:25] don't want you to start reading it to me
[22:27] and her with a quiver in her voice and
[22:30] still crying and still shaking and she
[22:33] started reading what David had to say
[22:35] when she got down to about verse 7 or 8
[22:38] I said read it again she started reading
[22:40] it again there wasn't just but me and
[22:42] her
[22:43] unless that was there but all of a
[22:45] sudden somebody else entered into that
[22:48] room so whenever I read Psalms 91 it is
[22:52] very personal to me because I have
[22:55] experienced Psalms 19:1 in my own life
[22:59] and I'm sure many of you when you think
[23:00] about it you'll be able to say the same
[23:02] now what I'd like to do is to begin
[23:04] tonight if we could with first one and
[23:06] let's just break it down a little bit if
[23:08] we can he that dwelleth in the secret
[23:10] place of the Most High shall abide under
[23:14] the shadow of the Almighty now once you
[23:16] notice that in the promises of God that
[23:20] many of God's promises are based upon
[23:22] conditions some of them God gives you
[23:25] certain things it really has nothing
[23:27] relevant to whether you do anything or
[23:29] not but there's other conditions of God
[23:31] promises rather of God that come with
[23:34] conditions and this is one of them and
[23:36] the condition is the very force three is
[23:40] a number of God he that dwelleth in the
[23:43] secret place of the Most High now notice
[23:47] it's not him that goes in and comes out
[23:50] it's not him that visits on occasion but
[23:54] it is him that dwells look at this word
[23:56] it means to dwell or remain or sit or
[24:00] abide or have one's abode or to marry so
[24:06] this promise that is going to be made to
[24:09] us tonight now I think I've wanted you
[24:11] out there with the scare this in the
[24:13] land and the fear that's in the land I
[24:15] believe we all want this promise to be
[24:17] ours do we not we want to be kept and
[24:19] the time of pestilence we want to be
[24:21] kept in the type of horrific disease and
[24:24] military and we do not know how far this
[24:27] thing is going to go now I understand
[24:29] that some of the brothers around the
[24:30] message are trying to take this time and
[24:32] say the bride is in the tribulation
[24:34] period don't you believe that for one
[24:36] minute the bride is never going into a
[24:39] tribulation period
[24:40] they will never
[24:43] the Lord will take her he will allow
[24:45] trouble to come away and difficulty to
[24:48] come our way but the tribulation has not
[24:50] said Ian we get the rapture we do not
[24:53] get a tribulation period that's exactly
[24:57] right
[24:57] well God let us go through things
[24:59] certainly well but we are not in a
[25:01] tribulation period now David said he
[25:03] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[25:06] Most High so it's not every man then
[25:10] that actually dwells in the secret place
[25:13] and in reality it's not even every
[25:16] Christian now we've been through that
[25:17] enough to know that those that are
[25:19] called Christians are those that are
[25:20] saved but we're not just talking about
[25:22] being saved we're talking about heaven
[25:24] the token and being filled with the Holy
[25:27] Ghost so he that dwelleth in the secret
[25:30] place so he comes to God's house but he
[25:34] does not come and leave now unlike
[25:36] whenever the service is over here
[25:37] tonight the ten brothers of us or
[25:40] whatever it is it's here we will depart
[25:42] we'll say goodbye and we'll see you
[25:44] again Lord willing on Sunday and we will
[25:46] leave this house and we'll say well
[25:48] we'll see you again in the way for all
[25:50] of us to be gathered together but in
[25:52] reality those of us that are filled with
[25:54] the Holy Ghost
[25:55] never leave God's house because God's
[25:58] house is the mystical body of Jesus
[26:01] Christ and once you're baptized Ian
[26:03] you're there forever so David said he
[26:06] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[26:08] Most High don't you notice that he
[26:11] dwells in the father's house so there's
[26:14] some who worship in the outer court and
[26:16] there's some who come in to the second
[26:19] realm but this doesn't apply to them
[26:21] actually it's those who dwell in the
[26:24] secret place of the Most High he dwells
[26:27] and lives in the Holy of Holies so he
[26:31] lives where under the shadows of the
[26:33] cherubim over the mercy seat now
[26:36] remember this is where that
[26:38] it is going to apply this light of the
[26:41] word so he is not a stranger in the
[26:44] house of God this man this woman this
[26:47] boy this girl of Psalms 19:1 one it's
[26:49] not a guest in the house of God they are
[26:53] at home praise God
[26:56] they are not a guest in the house of God
[26:59] and we know how that is people come to
[27:02] our house and they're a guests and then
[27:03] many folks come here to this place of
[27:05] worship and they come and visit they'll
[27:07] never come back again they will be my
[27:09] goodness what kind of church is that and
[27:11] they come one time and never come back
[27:13] again
[27:13] some come a dozen times half a dozen
[27:15] time but this is not who we're talking
[27:17] about we're talking about those that go
[27:20] into the mystical body though they're
[27:22] baptized by the Holy Ghost and when they
[27:24] get there they are home they are no
[27:28] longer a visitor
[27:29] they are at home notice he said he that
[27:33] dwelleth in the secret place so what
[27:36] place would this severe well in the time
[27:38] of David wrote this David of course
[27:40] being a middle-eastern King himself and
[27:42] David would have practiced this was the
[27:45] people in his kingdom he would have
[27:47] practiced this with the emissaries of
[27:49] other kingdoms with those who would have
[27:52] come from different places and only
[27:54] those that David would have hand-picked
[27:56] would have been allowed to enter into
[27:59] the holy of Holy's or as it were as the
[28:02] inner sanctum of the palace now even
[28:05] David's 500 wives could not come at will
[28:08] and go into that secret place this was
[28:11] where the king himself went to get away
[28:13] from all the issues of the kingdom and
[28:16] they knew it was an unwritten law no one
[28:19] went there unless you were bidden by the
[28:22] king
[28:22] so David himself practiced this secret
[28:26] place and no doubt it must have dropped
[28:28] down in his heart that he realized God
[28:30] has this place God has a place like this
[28:33] whenever he was in there maybe David was
[28:35] dealing with administrative problems
[28:37] with this and there was a drought over
[28:39] there
[28:40] the waters running dry over here and
[28:42] there they're having problems over there
[28:43] David said I've just got to get away
[28:45] from it all and he went into its place
[28:47] and said nobody nobody bother me
[28:50] everybody leave me alone hit walk inside
[28:52] there and the curtain mud got behind him
[28:54] and there it was all my just for the
[28:57] peace just for a little bit of joy for a
[29:00] little while no worries no problem so it
[29:03] would only last for a moment but it was
[29:05] something that he needed must have
[29:07] struck his heart maybe a brother down
[29:09] walking in that one day after dealing
[29:11] with such situation and if the piece
[29:13] just covered over him and if the
[29:15] revelation struck his heart God has a
[29:17] place at this well David did not know
[29:20] the Holy Ghost David didn't understand
[29:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost all David
[29:24] knew was that there was a place there a
[29:27] tabernacle a crude place that he felt
[29:30] that he wanted to be there and he got
[29:32] his clothes has said the law would allow
[29:34] him to go but he knew he could never
[29:36] enter behind that veil but he said oh I
[29:38] want to I want to get behind there our
[29:41] shadows of priest
[29:42] I was out to kill the undead well I wish
[29:45] I could be there to be in the presence
[29:47] of God and he said all there's got to be
[29:49] a place there's got to be a place that a
[29:52] man can go that God calls him his secret
[29:56] place notices it is God's pavilion and
[30:01] words he hides his friends from harm
[30:05] those that dwell in this secret place
[30:08] now brother Daryl read this also on
[30:10] Sunday but I'd like to read it again
[30:11] Psalms twenty-seven and five I want you
[30:15] to notice now what's the links of this
[30:17] and who does what in the time of trouble
[30:20] he shall hide me now once you notice now
[30:25] who's doing this it's not us hiding
[30:28] ourselves it is not us seeking God and
[30:31] we were supposed to do our part now but
[30:34] if this is not us doing this it is God
[30:37] doing this I'm
[30:39] that Psalms 27 is what a background for
[30:42] the rapture the more I see the timer in
[30:44] the more I realize how perfect this
[30:47] Psalm really is and it begins out with
[30:50] trouble
[30:50] it begins out in verse 2 talking about
[30:52] difficulty we'll look at it later but
[30:54] you go right on down it's one verse
[30:56] after another after another trouble
[30:59] being everywhere well the Lord keep us
[31:03] brothers will he keep us you folks that
[31:05] are streaming a man he'll keep us
[31:07] notices in the time of trouble he shall
[31:12] hide me in his pavilion in the secret of
[31:18] his Tabernacle shall he high me notice
[31:23] again it's not as adding ourselves it's
[31:26] not us running scared
[31:28] it's an old god oh god what are we going
[31:30] to do I don't know what we're gonna do
[31:31] we're gonna be calm we're gonna trust
[31:33] him we're gonna wash our hands we're
[31:35] gonna do what we can do and we're gonna
[31:38] claim his promises that's right for it's
[31:41] not up to me to hide myself I can wash
[31:44] my hands he won't do that
[31:45] but it's not up to me to hide myself
[31:47] it's up to him it's up to me to believe
[31:51] that he will and claim his promise he
[31:53] shall hide me in his pavilion and the
[31:57] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[32:00] me he shall say me notice the three
[32:04] phases first pole second pole third pole
[32:07] all three of them saying the same thing
[32:09] as far as the power of the one who's
[32:11] doing the work it's the Almighty
[32:13] all we're doing is surrendering he will
[32:16] hide me in his pavilion he will have set
[32:19] me oh ma he was in the secret of his
[32:22] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[32:25] me on a rock and what is Iraq on the
[32:28] Bible a revelation he will set me
[32:32] on our revelation now we know the
[32:34] majority of the world they don't have a
[32:36] clue what the outcome of all this is as
[32:38] far as the numbers of the dead and so on
[32:40] neither do we but we know this if
[32:43] trouble comes our way our God will be
[32:45] with us am i saying every Christian will
[32:48] be descent from this thing that's coming
[32:50] I am NOT because we are human beings but
[32:53] I know this there is a difference and
[32:55] disciplinary action of a plague that
[32:57] comes from God upon the wicked and it is
[33:00] of a son or daughter of God who
[33:02] experiences the same thing because
[33:05] children of God are not getting it for
[33:07] disciplinary action but they will get it
[33:10] with a blessing they're coming out of it
[33:12] there will be a better person than what
[33:14] they was when they entered into it now
[33:16] the world does not have that promise but
[33:18] we do as is believed in children notice
[33:21] he said in the secret of his tabernacle
[33:23] chali hide me he shall set me upon a
[33:27] rock some thirty one twenty now shall
[33:30] hide them in the secret of thy presence
[33:32] from the pride of men
[33:34] thou shalt keep them secretly in a
[33:37] pavilion from the strife of tongues is
[33:41] there a Amen
[33:44] so that hear your life of worship it's
[33:47] actually what makes the obedient life
[33:50] that is put on display before the people
[33:53] now notice this the hidden life of
[33:55] worship and communion with God it's what
[33:59] makes possible the walk of faith that we
[34:02] live every day of our life notice not
[34:05] verse tune some snotty one I will say of
[34:08] the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress
[34:13] my god in him Oh hallelujah
[34:18] and I'll tell Fred it ain't good enough
[34:22] that he's your mama's gone ain't good
[34:24] enough he said daddy's God he ain't good
[34:26] enough he's your pastors God and I were
[34:29] living
[34:29] you need to know it's you're gone that's
[34:32] right I will say of the Lord I trust
[34:34] every one of us can say this tonight I
[34:36] will say of the Lord he is my refuge and
[34:40] my fortress my god in him will I trust
[34:44] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[34:48] snare of the Fowler and from the noisome
[34:51] pestilence to Pels mentioned here the
[34:54] snare of the Fowler and the noise and
[34:57] pestles of course both of these
[34:58] indicates a different type of Perak now
[35:01] remember David was a hunter and many of
[35:03] us are not even familiar ready with a
[35:05] sniper tower but it was a metaphor for
[35:08] evil plots or things that would come
[35:10] against us I mean know that the Fowler
[35:12] actually depending on what what type of
[35:14] bird that he was gonna hunt that he
[35:16] would study the bird itself and he would
[35:19] adapt the trap according to the nature
[35:22] of the bird now he is looking for a coil
[35:25] you would not go up in an eagle's nest
[35:27] and be able to lay the snare up there
[35:29] because the quail is not going to be
[35:31] there and it would be the same way if
[35:33] you're looking for a partridge looking
[35:34] for a grouse whatever more you would
[35:37] study the nature of that bird and then
[35:40] you would lay your snare according to
[35:42] that nature now we all can say Amen to
[35:44] this that the devil knows every one of
[35:46] our weaknesses he knows our nature's and
[35:50] he lays the snare for us according to
[35:53] our weakness for some people it may be
[35:57] you know one thing for others it'll be
[35:59] something different but the devil knows
[36:01] every one of us some folks call all the
[36:04] pieces one a time like this comes up and
[36:06] they just they just go to pieces and
[36:08] they shake and tremble and their faith
[36:10] just falls away and to them that's a
[36:12] great thing they're so kind of all
[36:14] praise God we're gonna go through it now
[36:16] remember they've got their weakness
[36:18] somewhere we all do and the devil will
[36:21] lay his trash
[36:23] according to your wings you see every
[36:25] child is custom-fit according to the
[36:28] nature of the one that is being tempted
[36:30] and he can tweak it and I'll trade just
[36:33] a little bit but David said no matter
[36:35] what he does the Spirit of God will help
[36:38] me and God will deliver me and the trap
[36:41] we know exactly what a foul would do
[36:43] that he would study the heart he would
[36:45] study the habit he will SETI the habitat
[36:48] he would study the die to what they
[36:50] would look for and certain ones would go
[36:52] underneath branches and they pick up
[36:54] little seeds and then pick up this and
[36:56] that in the other so guess where he's
[36:58] gonna put his snare he's gonna put it
[37:00] right where they feed right where they
[37:03] water well if they're scared of that
[37:04] area over there he's not gonna put it
[37:07] over there he will stay away from that
[37:09] area and he will lay the snare where
[37:11] they are comfortable with the things
[37:13] where they feel like well I'm okay I'm
[37:15] okay
[37:15] this is good this is my space I'm good
[37:18] and he will watch him and say oh okay
[37:20] right there's what we want to lay the
[37:22] snare but you know what the Spirit of
[37:24] God will help us even in our weaknesses
[37:27] aren't you glad now notice he says that
[37:31] God would be those that would come to
[37:34] those that would deliver them he said he
[37:37] shall deliver thee from the snare of the
[37:39] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[37:42] you know the human race since the fall
[37:46] of Adam in the beginning has never been
[37:48] exempt from disease and turmoil and all
[37:51] kinds of things I'm not sure a few
[37:53] things with him - not historically a
[37:55] pestilence is recorded as raging and
[37:59] Babylonia in AD 40 in Italy and 80-66
[38:04] and basta these took place before the
[38:07] destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD now if
[38:12] you look at the sequence of many of
[38:14] these events down through time we know
[38:17] that God uses actually will allow will
[38:21] allow Satan to move in the
[38:24] with plagues with diseases and even war
[38:28] and he will use them as a judgment but
[38:34] remember we're children if we're filled
[38:37] with the Holy Ghost God ain't want to
[38:39] turn that devil loose on us a man now
[38:43] what's this this one that struck in
[38:46] Babylon and 40 ad and the other one in
[38:50] 66 AD in Italy and then both of them
[38:53] full ran the destruction of Jerusalem
[38:57] and when you look at where we are in you
[38:59] think of this one and that one
[39:01] one plague has crippled the world one
[39:05] play has brought economic disaster to
[39:09] the world
[39:10] can you imagine want to be in the
[39:12] tribulation when there's one after
[39:15] another after another after another I
[39:17] knew already I didn't want to be here
[39:20] during the Tribulation Period I'm more
[39:22] that convinced now can you imagine what
[39:25] it's going to be like well today I'm so
[39:27] glad there's been a way made Jesus said
[39:29] pray you that for all ways that you may
[39:31] be accounted worthy to escape all these
[39:33] things that shall come to pass and stand
[39:35] before the Son of Man that is my prayer
[39:38] so a pestilence is a deadly disaster
[39:42] usually a disease which will be
[39:45] perpetuated through an entire community
[39:47] or it can be an island or a country it
[39:51] can be a contagion that is passed one to
[39:54] the other notice is the black deaths the
[39:56] bubonic plague of the 14th century wiped
[40:00] out the majority of the population of
[40:03] Europe resulting in the deaths of an
[40:08] estimated between 75 to 200 million
[40:13] people and who was on the earths at this
[40:21] time Martin no sir swingley and there
[40:28] you know what they had to deal with they
[40:31] had to deal with some of their people
[40:33] suffering
[40:34] so Luther said he would go through and
[40:37] fumigate the air and still pray and
[40:40] claim the promises of God while they
[40:44] were humans they're not exempt from
[40:46] sickness and difficulty and heartache
[40:49] and trouble can your bags in 75 to 200
[40:54] million of course they didn't have the
[40:55] dad and all that that we keep up with
[40:57] today one-fourth of the population of
[41:01] the civilized world perished and Europe
[41:05] alone reaching 25 million 25 million OMA
[41:15] the great pestilence of 1918 the Spanish
[41:20] flu
[41:20] what's wiped out people in the United
[41:23] States more than a nation loss in World
[41:26] War one it infected an estimated 500
[41:30] million people worldwide about 1/3 of
[41:35] the planets population and killed an
[41:38] estimated 20 million to 75 million
[41:42] victims including some 675 thousand
[41:49] Americans so it's our God greater he is
[41:56] yes it's our Holy Ghost greater then
[42:00] play then disease then the black deaths
[42:03] and whatever death
[42:04] absolutely right so what do we do in
[42:07] such times we claim the promise of God
[42:10] we do every thing we can do I do not
[42:12] believe face is foolish I believe faith
[42:16] is based upon the word I believe faith
[42:19] helps us to be able to guide us through
[42:22] such trouble sometimes I mean though
[42:25] many people think they have faith when
[42:26] they're absolutely foolish and wrap us
[42:29] with it Amen that's exactly right
[42:32] any of them will lose a life foolishly
[42:35] because of their perception of faiths
[42:38] but faiths never will lead you contrary
[42:41] to the Word of God if God leads you on a
[42:44] leprosy camp go right ahead God will
[42:47] take care of you if he leaves you there
[42:48] but if you go because of human
[42:51] selfishness and pride to prove what you
[42:54] are you better count your fingers and
[42:56] toes because you may lose them before
[42:57] you get back because you're going out of
[43:00] pride not by faith people will say
[43:03] during this time all bless God I'm going
[43:06] to church I'm proven my faithful first
[43:08] of all you're not cooperating with
[43:10] whatever our government is asked us to
[43:12] do you're also risking your own
[43:14] testimony before people because they
[43:17] can't go here and there and there and
[43:19] you're acting like you're better than
[43:20] they are and you're going to prove
[43:22] yourself you're proven that you're
[43:23] ignorant well amen should have made that
[43:28] amen tape a long time ago first service
[43:31] that will get everybody back we're going
[43:32] to have any men making tape amen
[43:35] now notice this if where we are in this
[43:39] age will we have millions of deaths I
[43:41] don't know that I'm not saying that we
[43:43] will I don't have a clue no more than
[43:45] any of you know but all I know is that
[43:47] God in the past has allowed such things
[43:50] to come upon the earth our eyes most of
[43:53] us are we praying more now when we pray
[43:59] over our food are we more sincere than
[44:02] just a habit
[44:03] are we mentioning things with sincerity
[44:06] I know it's sad for us too but we might
[44:09] as well just go ahead and admit to it
[44:10] and shake our heads and it's the truth
[44:12] because there's something about trouble
[44:14] that stirs us up there's something about
[44:18] it that shakes us it's a shame that God
[44:20] has to use such things but God knows how
[44:23] the human being is now what you notice
[44:27] this in the message the seven churches
[44:28] brother BAM said when the first world
[44:31] war that six trumpets sounded according
[44:34] Zach according to the time God's poker
[44:36] that exactly geographically fallen the
[44:39] seal before that and when the mystery
[44:41] was revealed in there for the baptism of
[44:44] the Holy Ghost how the church did not
[44:48] move up what's how he like insists that
[44:51] the mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[44:53] Ghost
[44:53] the church did not move uh and those who
[44:56] were moving refused to walk in the light
[44:59] and went back and the plague was opened
[45:03] at that time and pulled out upon the
[45:06] earth which was influenza influenza that
[45:14] killed all the people as it did the
[45:18] thousands times thousand now what he's
[45:21] referring to is the Spanish flu that we
[45:24] just read 20 to 75 million people and
[45:29] you mean God a loving wonderful faithful
[45:32] merciful God allowed that to happen why
[45:35] brother there are people refused the
[45:38] baptism of the holy ghost and some of
[45:41] those that had walked toward it started
[45:43] walking back and what did God do God
[45:47] allowed this now remember God does not
[45:49] create sickness God is not the ulcer of
[45:53] sickness the Prophet says that over and
[45:55] over again God is not the author of
[45:59] sickness he's not the author of disease
[46:01] but God will allow or our enemy I hope
[46:05] every one of you understand that Satan
[46:07] right now this is his type of day he's
[46:11] having a heyday he loves time cycler and
[46:15] can you imagine down in hell they are
[46:18] just they are having as we call it a
[46:20] revival the demons are frolicking
[46:24] they are so happy they love it when
[46:27] human beings are under fear they love it
[46:29] when human beings are under trauma and
[46:31] stress I read yesterday where a doctor
[46:34] here in our nation said he was more
[46:36] afraid of suicide and depression and all
[46:40] of that that's going to affect American
[46:42] people then he was the virus itself
[46:44] he believes that numbers of suicides
[46:47] will soar because it was so interrupt
[46:50] our way of life God made those social
[46:52] creatures that's alright we're not made
[46:54] just to hibernate by ourselves and
[46:56] there's something about it we love to
[46:59] get together as people but can you
[47:01] imagine them Dimas what kind of a dear
[47:03] demon would love to see people so
[47:06] stressed out but Satan loves this type
[47:09] of an opportunity but I've got news for
[47:12] that devil he may take a lot of people
[47:14] no doubt it'll affect our economy it'll
[47:16] throw it still place it will never occur
[47:18] break neither with the rest of the world
[47:20] but you know what I believe a bribe will
[47:22] come out on the other side we're going
[47:23] to be better people after this I believe
[47:25] we'll be closer to God I believe we'll
[47:27] be closer together
[47:28] I believe we'll appreciate our church
[47:30] like never before
[47:31] I believe we'll appreciate one another
[47:33] like never before I believe we'll
[47:35] appreciate life just being able to go to
[47:37] Walmart not be worried just they'll go
[47:39] stop at a restaurant
[47:40] and get a hamburger come on preacher and
[47:42] I believe that we'll be able to
[47:44] appreciate just the things of a lot more
[47:46] we take so much for granted Oh
[47:52] notice this from the New Testament we
[47:55] learn that God does not keep his people
[47:59] from all sickness and trouble we know
[48:02] that he does not even keep us from the
[48:05] valley of death but he keeps us from the
[48:07] valley of the shadow of death he does
[48:11] not keep us from death but he keeps us
[48:14] through this he does not keep us from
[48:17] dying but when we're going through death
[48:19] to us it's just a simple crossing over
[48:22] we're taking the taxi as it was it takes
[48:24] us on the other side it's only a few
[48:26] moments in any work time you get in sit
[48:28] down
[48:29] time to get out so you aren't even know
[48:31] that you've been there now to those that
[48:32] are going that are not ready of course
[48:34] it's a different time but remember the
[48:36] Lord Jesus and talking and referring to
[48:38] in the Book of Luke when he talked about
[48:40] those that would be killed and so on for
[48:42] his namesake
[48:43] and they would go through a great
[48:44] persecution and then Jesus says these
[48:46] words accompany along with that but not
[48:50] one hair of your head shall perish and
[48:52] he was talking about people that would
[48:54] lose their life for his calls it shows
[48:57] he looks at it in such a different way
[49:00] than we do we look on side oh no oh no
[49:03] if I succumb to this or that of the
[49:05] other I'm a loser people say oh he lost
[49:07] the cancer don't you say that about a
[49:09] child of God a child of God is a winner
[49:11] either way oh you say they never got
[49:14] their healing they did get their healing
[49:15] they got their healing from mortality
[49:17] that's exactly right sometimes we pray
[49:20] God will heal people of cancer and God
[49:22] said I want them to experience the real
[49:33] miraculous power of supernatural divine
[49:36] healing from another dimension hey man
[49:39] if we are the children of God when we
[49:41] goso everything as I said it's not
[49:44] punitive that God is punishing us it's
[49:46] not that God's trying to get even with
[49:48] us but as we looked at job that God has
[49:51] a lesson and the people of God will come
[49:53] through this with a lesson I believe
[49:55] there are people that will come out of
[49:56] this with great gold in our character
[49:58] meetings have had been cancelled all
[50:00] over the world all types of things have
[50:03] been shook up our world shook up us
[50:04] around us and sometimes as I said we get
[50:07] lazy and we need to be shook up but I
[50:09] believe we're gonna be shook up who
[50:10] knows this might be the life shaken
[50:12] before the change oh praise God notice
[50:16] in verse 4 that David said he shall
[50:19] cover thee with his feathers brother
[50:22] Daryl covered that so beautifully I'm
[50:24] not even gonna go the direction that he
[50:26] did because there's no need to it he
[50:27] just covered it so wonderfully he shall
[50:29] cover thee with his
[50:31] feathers and under his wings shalt thou
[50:34] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[50:39] buckler but I wonder if you felt of this
[50:44] verse of this way if this would have not
[50:48] been said by man inspired by the Holy
[50:51] Ghost it would almost be blasphemous
[50:56] that any mortal man would liken the
[51:00] almighty eternal elohim to a bird but
[51:10] god inspired david to liken him to a
[51:17] bird what do I see in this verse the
[51:22] condensation of the infinite Jehovah
[51:25] that he would allow my such transcendent
[51:30] condescension that he would allow
[51:32] himself to be likened to a bird that God
[51:37] would liken himself to an eagle or to a
[51:40] in the book of Matthew that when the
[51:43] Lord Jesus come on the air and he said o
[51:45] Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I gathered
[51:47] you together as a Hindu gather her brood
[51:50] even there he likens himself to a mother
[51:53] hen can you imagine the eternal
[51:57] condescended don't you see how much he
[51:59] loves us why would he say such a thing
[52:01] he didn't need to say it for himself he
[52:04] said it for us that we would be able to
[52:06] understand oh my that he would come down
[52:09] so low he would go beyond just the
[52:12] likeness of a man he'd gone to animal
[52:14] nature and say I'm like an eagle I'm
[52:17] like a here I'm like this Wow so you'd
[52:21] be able to grab ahold of it all praise
[52:23] God when I said right there son did her
[52:25] brother down preaching about that eagle
[52:27] and her watching her little babies down
[52:29] there I just see myself put my face on
[52:32] that Eagles head and I grabbed ahold of
[52:34] that eagle hallelujah I climbed mad to
[52:37] my own science was rot down on that
[52:38] feather than you why because to me
[52:41] that's the way Papa wants it to be I put
[52:43] my face right on that little eagle
[52:45] whenever that storm come I felt myself
[52:47] from the wind hit me right in the face
[52:49] but I wasn't afraid because I was a hold
[52:51] of Jehovah's way and I'll tell you I'm
[52:53] going to face this pandemic I'm gonna
[52:55] face it the way I faced everything else
[52:58] with my eye right on the promise of the
[52:59] Word of God I'll be going into the storm
[53:02] we're gonna run from it nobody ain't
[53:03] running we'll go right into it as the
[53:06] Spirit of God the leaders but we're not
[53:08] doing it and our pride in our arrogance
[53:10] and our might we are doing it in the
[53:12] power of the Lord how will we come
[53:14] through this with dots a thorn or how
[53:17] will we overcome it with touch saith the
[53:19] Lord
[53:19] how will we be hallelujah that God how
[53:22] will we all be on the other side we'll
[53:23] still does say it the Lord will go into
[53:26] it but saith the Lord in the middle
[53:28] we'll have thus saith the Lord on the
[53:30] other side we are God's attributes his
[53:38] spoken word children hallelujah well I
[53:43] was gonna say forgave me but angles say
[53:45] that I'm getting excited
[53:47] praise the Lord said he gathers chickens
[53:51] I would have gathered you notice your
[53:55] Luke 13 he said o Jerusalem Jerusalem
[53:56] which killest the prophets and stonest
[53:58] them that are sent unto thee how often
[54:00] would I have gathered thy children
[54:01] together as a hand as a hand just gather
[54:07] her brood under her wings David said
[54:11] he'll cover thee with his feathers under
[54:14] his wings shalt thou trust his truth
[54:17] shall be thy shield the shield and
[54:19] buckler protected the body's vital parts
[54:22] from the weapons of thrusts that were
[54:26] thrown at you from the enemy let the
[54:29] devil throw sickness at him throw
[54:30] disease that him throw depression let
[54:32] him throw whatever he wants to throw we
[54:34] are more than
[54:35] honkers before the dawn and we never
[54:37] been here before I totally agree with
[54:39] that but our Lord Jesus has been here
[54:41] before
[54:42] what about the saints of God that lived
[54:44] through the bubonic plague did he help
[54:45] him did he keep him by his grace
[54:47] certainly did and there was millions
[54:49] dying all over the earth the people of
[54:50] God but right there in the middle of it
[54:52] was her people have gone the Spanish flu
[54:54] of course there were weather people of
[54:56] God and the plagues in different times
[54:57] there were 2000 fallen on the left ten
[55:00] thousand on the right but David said
[55:02] Rother I stood in the middle of it and
[55:04] somehow the grace of God spared my life
[55:06] looking at it you think he was the very
[55:08] man that should have died that God said
[55:10] not so not so no one in riverdale he can
[55:13] wrap this with such inspiration your
[55:15] imagine standing down in the middle of
[55:17] it feeling your the very calls and
[55:19] people dying everywhere around you and
[55:21] he went out thirdly saw the angel of God
[55:23] and he said something for me something
[55:41] into the presence of God stopped the
[55:44] plague I believe we are to pray like
[55:48] never before for God's mercy I'm sure
[55:51] you are but I'm praying every day that
[55:52] God will help doctors biochemists and
[55:55] whoever more to be able to bring relief
[55:58] to the human race because the prophet of
[56:01] God did exactly the same thing when he
[56:03] was here notice this in verse 5 thou
[56:06] shalt not a man thou shalt not be afraid
[56:12] for the terror but 9 now we know there's
[56:16] something about night isn't it amazing
[56:19] that if a thunderstorm comes in the day
[56:21] there's there could be an element of
[56:23] fear but if that same thunderstorm would
[56:26] come of the same amount of wind same
[56:29] amount of lightning and the same amount
[56:31] of thunder why is it it seems more scary
[56:34] in the nighttime because of something
[56:37] about us as human beings and the night
[56:40] everything becomes different the night
[56:45] or even different I've been in the
[56:46] African bush honey and the night sounds
[56:49] in Africa they're just they're
[56:52] incredible they're awesome in one way
[56:53] and yet they're fearful I'm sitting in a
[56:55] place in Sim probably there whenever I
[56:57] was hunting one time and the guy told me
[56:59] said now you say over here but yourself
[57:01] was a block type of thing around top of
[57:03] little room maybe size some office or
[57:05] something like that and he said now
[57:06] don't get scared he said we see leopards
[57:08] around here and he said we see you know
[57:10] some different things but they only come
[57:12] out at night and he said oh I forgot to
[57:15] tell you don't have a lock on your door
[57:16] oh ok don't have a lock on the door so I
[57:21] finally did go to sleep and I woke up in
[57:23] the night but something like this well
[57:27] my heart's got as big as saucers now if
[57:30] I've heard that same noise in the
[57:32] daylight it wouldn't bother me near as
[57:34] much but there's something about
[57:36] darkness and David said I want to frame
[57:39] the night I'm gonna frame the night and
[57:42] I'm gonna catch the fears I'm gonna
[57:44] catch the Majan Asians I'm gonna catch
[57:47] the you know the unknown that's what's
[57:48] getting everybody right now it's the
[57:50] unknown it's the unknown where is it
[57:53] going oh how bad will it be here how bad
[57:55] will it be there will it get me will it
[57:57] get my momma will they get this it's the
[57:58] unknown and David said I'm gonna catch
[58:01] the unknown at the worst time in the
[58:03] nighttime and I'm gonna go ahead and lay
[58:05] it out by the inspiration of the Spirit
[58:07] of God and he said thou shalt not be
[58:09] afraid for the terror by night nor for
[58:13] the arrow that flies by the day so
[58:17] firestorms
[58:18] tempest enemies you imagine an enemy a
[58:21] bunch of men coming at you at the night
[58:23] time and they would lie in wait many
[58:25] times at night and they would attack at
[58:28] night you can't see them you don't know
[58:30] who's on your side who's against you and
[58:32] David must have been there he must have
[58:34] been there I felt I know what that's
[58:35] like I know what it's like when you're
[58:37] looking out there you're sinking who's
[58:39] on my side
[58:40] who's for me who's against me I can't
[58:42] see him I don't know what to do do I
[58:43] throw a rock or throw a javelin do I
[58:45] shoot an arrow do I wait do I leave
[58:48] I don't know what to do and David said I
[58:50] felt that feeling before I know that
[58:52] feeling I'm sure every one of us have
[58:54] felt the same way when the darkness oh
[58:56] man when we can't see they live around
[58:57] us and we wonder where he is but
[58:59] remember he's still in the ship
[59:01] sometimes you may not be able to feel
[59:03] him and you may go quiet on your buddy
[59:05] stealing it for a reason
[59:06] Oh hallelujah man nor for the arrow that
[59:13] fast bad the day brother shot from the
[59:15] bow of God or shot from the bow of the
[59:18] devil or shot from the bow of man oh you
[59:22] realize there's three different aspects
[59:24] about what's the bulk and come against
[59:25] you God in His mercy because of his love
[59:28] I'm ready just yesterday when brother
[59:30] Graham said that God sometimes well let
[59:32] a sickness come on an individual and he
[59:34] said just in order to draw him a little
[59:36] bit closer to it so he can kind of pull
[59:38] itto you up in his arms and were
[59:40] thinking that he don't like us we're
[59:42] thinking that he's rejected us and he
[59:44] spanking us but in reality many times it
[59:47] ain't that way at all he's actually
[59:49] pulling us a little bit closer because
[59:50] we'll we'll get real closer time and
[59:53] we'll snuggle up to him and he pulls us
[59:55] real close and goes to minister some
[59:57] real close intimate fellowship so
[59:59] sometimes God pulls a hair out of his
[1:00:02] bowl I'm gonna allow things to come our
[1:00:04] way
[1:00:05] other times he'll allow Satan to do it
[1:00:07] other times it'll be men and I'll shoot
[1:00:09] their hours of discontentment or their
[1:00:11] hours of gossip or arrows of this or
[1:00:13] that but David said it makes no
[1:00:15] difference who it comes from if it fires
[1:00:18] my day nobody comes from by God's grace
[1:00:21] I am going to live oh I love this in
[1:00:25] verse 6 nor for the pestilence that
[1:00:27] walketh in darkness oh my shrouded in
[1:00:33] mystery never remember they did not have
[1:00:36] biochemist they did not have
[1:00:38] laboratories microscopes when David
[1:00:42] wrote this yet they had plagues they had
[1:00:45] all kinds of things that deal with and
[1:00:46] it's mysterious to us now the
[1:00:49] coronavirus and all the other things
[1:00:51] that we do with it's mysterious and
[1:00:53] they're looking thank god they are
[1:00:55] looking I hope and pray God will let
[1:00:56] them find something but can you imagine
[1:00:58] how mysterious it must have been in this
[1:01:01] timeframe whenever things were coming
[1:01:04] they didn't know what to do and many of
[1:01:05] them it was the water that was causing
[1:01:07] it it was this and that and the other
[1:01:09] and they didn't know what to do it was
[1:01:11] veiled in mystery oh my but David said
[1:01:15] for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:01:17] darkness it stays hidden I don't know
[1:01:21] what to do listen is not our own
[1:01:24] president and his cabinet and many of
[1:01:27] the doctors saying that we are in a war
[1:01:29] a president is identifying himself as
[1:01:33] being a wartime president and you know
[1:01:38] doctors are saying we're in a war now we
[1:01:40] understand that actually a little bit
[1:01:42] better than what they did because we
[1:01:44] know what this is is a fourth dimension
[1:01:48] a fourth dimension visitation that has
[1:01:51] come from the demonic world and pressed
[1:01:54] its way now some they say started with
[1:01:57] some type of exotic plant or a brother
[1:01:59] now they're saying possibly in the wet
[1:02:01] markets of China which I've been there
[1:02:03] and seeing all that and they're saying
[1:02:04] now maybe possibly that it was about
[1:02:06] that someone they Batson in China and
[1:02:09] that actually they'd went to a wet
[1:02:11] market and it's someone that had made
[1:02:13] him sick and it come from that one
[1:02:15] person and we say how Satan does it time
[1:02:17] that exactly for the Chinese New Year
[1:02:19] them going out to visit and so if the
[1:02:21] Chinese fault they didn't bring this
[1:02:23] upon us intentionally many of those
[1:02:25] people have suffered greatly we don't
[1:02:27] bind them but yeah they were Satan time
[1:02:29] that exactly right
[1:02:31] so that them going out to visit here and
[1:02:34] there and down many Chinese live in
[1:02:36] Italy what did they do they want a broad
[1:02:38] brought it right back into their
[1:02:39] homeland and they're doing the same
[1:02:41] thing over and over again many
[1:02:42] international travelers what did he do
[1:02:44] at the end of World War one when the
[1:02:46] Spanish flu hit what was at the time
[1:02:48] that some of the boys was coming back
[1:02:50] home going here and now
[1:02:52] exactly how that it was time our enemy
[1:02:55] knows exactly what he is doing but so do
[1:02:59] we we are not ignorant concerning his
[1:03:02] chops and his devices and we are not
[1:03:05] ignorant that our God will move on our
[1:03:08] behalf he said I am Not Afraid even at
[1:03:11] the destruction that will waste at
[1:03:13] noonday if it comes in the night so big
[1:03:16] that comes in the noonday so being my
[1:03:18] God is grief all my God is greater than
[1:03:21] all of it verse seven a thousand a
[1:03:24] thousand shall fall at thy side which is
[1:03:27] your left there and ten thousand at thy
[1:03:32] right hand but it shall not it shall not
[1:03:38] come nigh ha see this is not talking
[1:03:45] about the battle this is talking about
[1:03:47] the pestilence that he just described in
[1:03:50] the verse before now this is a man
[1:03:53] without the Holy Ghost I wonder how
[1:03:56] close it could get to us and now shake
[1:03:59] our faith now whenever we read it on our
[1:04:03] apps and we read our news and see the
[1:04:05] little news clips on our phones and so
[1:04:06] on and we see their numbers most of them
[1:04:09] are faceless people they are stats to us
[1:04:12] no lifes name no first name no middle
[1:04:15] name the skin color we know nothing
[1:04:17] about them they're just a number but
[1:04:20] what if it was your neighborhood what if
[1:04:22] you sure community what if it's people
[1:04:24] in our church people in our message this
[1:04:28] is why I think we have to be careful and
[1:04:29] taking the quote when brother bem said
[1:04:31] they'll be plagues gone in the life
[1:04:33] station it'll fall on everybody without
[1:04:34] the Holy Ghost we've got to be careful
[1:04:36] and make sure that whenever we apply
[1:04:38] this if we know what we're doing because
[1:04:40] if somebody in the message gets this
[1:04:42] then what does that make us doing makes
[1:04:44] them putting the move without the Holy
[1:04:45] Ghost now whether or not this is that
[1:04:47] plague I do not know that plague will
[1:04:50] come because he said it will be here
[1:04:52] right notice it was so close that David
[1:04:57] comparing these numbers a thousand to my
[1:04:59] left
[1:05:00] 10,000 you're chose the devastation by
[1:05:03] the Lord that was made by such a plane
[1:05:05] and remember David experiences 70,000 of
[1:05:08] his own people dying right around him
[1:05:10] but God in His mercy spared him no
[1:05:12] wonder this man could write this with
[1:05:14] such conviction your Mattson hearing and
[1:05:17] seeing people screaming out of your own
[1:05:20] city and you yourself are the very cause
[1:05:23] of why this happened and God's grace
[1:05:25] God's providential good oh you say I'm
[1:05:27] not worthy you saying David was worthy
[1:05:29] you saying David had done any good thing
[1:05:32] he was the very man that had caused it
[1:05:34] it was a picture of God's grace so I
[1:05:37] understand it all I don't but I know one
[1:05:39] thing he is merciful and that's one
[1:05:40] thing I was sure appreciate about it the
[1:05:43] special Providence of God he said it
[1:05:45] will not come nigh thee but you will be
[1:05:49] safe you'll feel protected oh I believe
[1:05:52] that there's ever a time that we need to
[1:05:54] not do that just physically but we need
[1:05:57] to know that we know that we know that
[1:06:00] our soul is sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:02] now I know I mentioned to you they were
[1:06:03] going to have a prayer line Lord will
[1:06:05] and we're going to do that cuz I felt
[1:06:06] led to do so whenever we come back we'll
[1:06:08] have it now remember the prayer line
[1:06:09] it's not just gonna be for the sick
[1:06:11] bodies the prayer line will be for those
[1:06:13] who need to be saved the prayer line
[1:06:15] will be there for those who need
[1:06:16] strength and the wall it'll also be for
[1:06:18] those who need the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:20] Ghost as a matter of fact the Prophet
[1:06:22] tells us the Apostolic way of receiving
[1:06:25] the Holy Ghost is to have hands laid
[1:06:27] upon you I can't never see where that
[1:06:29] was ever changed no this is all about
[1:06:32] mother darling well what if what if
[1:06:34] someone our church gets it what what if
[1:06:36] what if you get it what if somebody gets
[1:06:37] it oh well ma does that mean you don't
[1:06:39] have the Holy Ghost they don't mean
[1:06:41] there's such thing around does that mean
[1:06:44] God didn't watch over you no no what if
[1:06:47] some unbeliever dies with it
[1:06:49] God did watch over him no that doesn't
[1:06:51] mean that many of God's children died
[1:06:54] was diseases all kinds of different
[1:06:57] things but we get something different
[1:07:00] out of it than what the normal Joey here
[1:07:02] gets from he does his family gathers
[1:07:05] around him and all he was a good old guy
[1:07:06] done this and that and the other all but
[1:07:08] you see we have promises aren't these
[1:07:10] now
[1:07:11] thing happens by chance it all happens
[1:07:15] for some reason the grace of God is
[1:07:19] right again he says I don't believe that
[1:07:22] anything happens to a Christian by
[1:07:29] chance
[1:07:29] I think it's ordained of God because
[1:07:34] jesus said he would make all things work
[1:07:38] together for good to them that love him
[1:07:43] praise God
[1:07:46] so what am I gonna do wash our hands and
[1:07:48] keep on believing I will do everything
[1:07:51] that's in my power I said you that
[1:07:53] Sunday board it I trust God but also
[1:07:56] lock my doors and I leave the house it's
[1:07:58] not that I don't trust God it's so many
[1:08:00] people in the community where I live I
[1:08:01] don't trust so you know what I trust God
[1:08:04] I have insurance I trust God have
[1:08:07] insurance on the car right I trust God
[1:08:10] with all different kinds of things and
[1:08:11] there's things that I do to be able to
[1:08:13] perpetuate in my life as long as I'm
[1:08:15] here I'm going to enter this and I have
[1:08:18] entered it exactly in the same way am I
[1:08:21] gonna watch am I gonna stay keep my
[1:08:23] social distance well I'm gonna do my
[1:08:25] best to be able to do that and if
[1:08:26] anybody sneezes I'm dropping everything
[1:08:28] I'm gone and I'm out of the store yeah
[1:08:30] whatever you gotta do to protect
[1:08:31] yourself now I realize there are people
[1:08:33] that look at that and they struggle well
[1:08:35] that's not my problem
[1:08:36] that they don't understand real faith
[1:08:38] you see the prophet of God himself when
[1:08:41] he was going overseas he said my arm is
[1:08:43] sore this morning because of shots that
[1:08:47] I had to take the yellow fever son and I
[1:08:50] the government requires it though
[1:08:54] brother Branham never told us oh yeah
[1:08:56] this is a persecution against the church
[1:08:58] this is not a persecution against the
[1:09:01] church the last time I checked the NBA
[1:09:04] was not a religious organization the
[1:09:08] Masters being canceled down in Georgia
[1:09:10] is not a church persecution now friend
[1:09:13] don't being doming nuts no don't don't
[1:09:15] done this don't be foolish during this
[1:09:17] time this
[1:09:18] is not a persecution against the church
[1:09:20] if this is a persecution against the
[1:09:22] church I'd be one of the first ones to
[1:09:24] say we're not doing it we're gonna come
[1:09:26] here anyhow this is not a persecution
[1:09:28] against the church people can't work
[1:09:30] people can't go here they can't go there
[1:09:33] oh but what if it comes out of it well
[1:09:35] if it comes out of it we'll deal with it
[1:09:37] then but that ain't what it is now and
[1:09:39] whenever we try to represent it that way
[1:09:41] when you're doing something falsely and
[1:09:43] telling a lot we need to tell the truth
[1:09:46] oh I'll see some beyond it brother
[1:09:48] Donnie you better make sure what you see
[1:09:49] it's based upon the word and if you're
[1:09:52] in a profit you don't know a bit more
[1:09:53] about it than I do
[1:09:54] so let's just follow what God said and
[1:09:57] this just behave ourselves in the line
[1:09:59] of duty and the brother says amen notice
[1:10:04] this again thanks there to be you were
[1:10:06] all pre-planned by God nothing that
[1:10:09] happens by chance was God he knows all
[1:10:13] about it's all pre plan praying for many
[1:10:16] generations a man back so that you could
[1:10:22] be here tonight now here we are and God
[1:10:24] knew this Wednesday night that be one
[1:10:28] two three four five six seven eight nine
[1:10:30] ten that I can see in this place which
[1:10:35] normally there's hundreds and hundreds
[1:10:36] and you know we are we're still in shock
[1:10:39] why we didn't know the plan we're still
[1:10:43] trying to figure it all out oh my
[1:10:45] goodness how long is this going to go
[1:10:47] I don't know if I could jump up here and
[1:10:48] read the plan to come back down and tell
[1:10:50] you but since I don't know what the plan
[1:10:51] is we'll just have to play it out Bay
[1:10:53] but day by day but I do not believe that
[1:10:56] this is how passive God said oh no I
[1:10:58] can't keep my children this coronavirus
[1:11:00] it's awful it's hard for this bigger
[1:11:02] God can stand that ain't my god I said
[1:11:06] that ain't my god
[1:11:07] my God's bigger never devil a lot of
[1:11:09] hell he's bigger than ever disease shame
[1:11:10] he's bigger than all of it put together
[1:11:12] a notice in verse eight only with thine
[1:11:17] eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[1:11:20] reward notices when God allows a plague
[1:11:25] to come upon the earth which is his
[1:11:27] righteous judgment it is reward to the
[1:11:31] wicked but when his children get sick it
[1:11:35] is not a reward for wickedness it's not
[1:11:38] punitive at all it's educational now we
[1:11:43] don't like going to that school but we
[1:11:45] all got to go I know we want to be tardy
[1:11:47] on them hard trial days and on them hard
[1:11:49] test days but we've all got to have them
[1:11:51] because I've seen in myself many many
[1:11:53] times when people get sick and maybe the
[1:11:55] last six months six weeks two months of
[1:11:58] the life and see little things that
[1:11:59] needed to be tweaked see this may dried
[1:12:02] and watch them and they call this
[1:12:03] brethren
[1:12:04] maybe that sister and just fix little
[1:12:06] things here and little things and them
[1:12:08] setting in church every time you have
[1:12:09] Church and somehow another they never
[1:12:11] did it they never fix it or no that
[1:12:13] never struck home but all of a sudden
[1:12:16] they're laying on their deathbed and
[1:12:17] this little saying I've had many of them
[1:12:19] to call me by the bedside another wife
[1:12:21] or the husband to go out the room
[1:12:23] brother Donny I need to make this right
[1:12:25] I said this about you I've done this I
[1:12:27] should have done that sure brother
[1:12:28] sister I understand and maybe live an
[1:12:30] hour maybe live 30 minutes maybe live
[1:12:33] you know however long from that time but
[1:12:35] it takes sometimes things like that what
[1:12:38] do we do we know we're facing it and we
[1:12:40] search every avenue of our life we
[1:12:42] search every room of our life we search
[1:12:44] every motive look a brother's whenever
[1:12:46] we think about it all you streamers
[1:12:48] tonight what's the most important to you
[1:12:50] tonight your money or your freedom and
[1:12:54] food and toilet paper and bottled water
[1:12:59] and things now who'd ever thought tolet
[1:13:02] paper would have such value why because
[1:13:07] people are scared to this whoever solved
[1:13:10] that should walk to Kroger
[1:13:11] Food City and the shelves would be empty
[1:13:14] our America don't you see what this is
[1:13:17] done I'm great scientists our great
[1:13:20] nation that's so full of pride
[1:13:22] she's humbled once again we can't
[1:13:25] control it Kenneth come on America you
[1:13:28] think you did or will Roz will be
[1:13:30] greater
[1:13:31] that's who America is but remember one
[1:13:35] of these days she'll meet her doom
[1:13:38] I'm so glad God has made a way for us
[1:13:41] don't you appreciate it so much
[1:13:43] notice what David said you'll receive
[1:13:45] and closure momentarily only with thine
[1:13:47] eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[1:13:50] reward of the wicked because thou has
[1:13:56] made the Lord which is my refuge even
[1:14:01] the most high the annotation or thou
[1:14:09] praise you have made the Lord your home
[1:14:18] you're in father's house praise God this
[1:14:22] is why the Prophet said that the blood
[1:14:24] was applied over the door for the lair
[1:14:27] because the name was on the door so when
[1:14:30] you'd come in not like Irish today on a
[1:14:32] mailbox outside but they would write the
[1:14:34] name on the door on the doorpost either
[1:14:37] hear the lentil going across the top and
[1:14:39] they'd write the name so when he said
[1:14:41] apply the blood when they applied the
[1:14:42] blood they applied the blood to the name
[1:14:44] or the entrance and he said the house of
[1:14:47] God is the name of Jesus Christ the body
[1:14:50] of God were baptized into that body and
[1:14:53] the blood is applied to the name
[1:14:56] what is the name not Reagan not Bayley
[1:14:58] not blevens it is the name of Jesus
[1:15:01] Christ and there we are safe but return
[1:15:04] does that mean we won't have trouble no
[1:15:05] no no no it doesn't mean that we're free
[1:15:07] from trouble but it means in our trouble
[1:15:10] we are safe in our trouble the world is
[1:15:13] not say don't you understand there's
[1:15:15] such a difference even what was also
[1:15:17] less trouble and we have trouble to say
[1:15:19] sure we
[1:15:19] but they are in turmoil in their trouble
[1:15:22] they are lost in their trouble can you
[1:15:25] imagine the world it's never not in our
[1:15:27] lifetime is it ever felt this lost and
[1:15:30] then America many people the world are
[1:15:32] so proud they can't stand it when they
[1:15:35] lose control and they're out of control
[1:15:37] they can't control the money market they
[1:15:40] cannot control the stocks the bonds they
[1:15:42] can't control their health they're out
[1:15:43] of control but I have rest you know you
[1:15:48] could have rest in that not because I've
[1:15:50] got control but because my daddy helps
[1:15:53] control I'm in my father's house the
[1:15:59] blood is not a tape oh my the token is
[1:16:03] not a tape of some of the unbelievers
[1:16:05] around the message I'd like to make it
[1:16:07] the blood of Jesus Christ the life that
[1:16:10] was in that boy is our token the baptism
[1:16:13] of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:13] that's what keeps us safe so if I go
[1:16:16] through trials I'll come out on the
[1:16:18] other side of that trial I'm more
[1:16:20] blessed man than I was before I went to
[1:16:22] here if I go through hardships I'll come
[1:16:24] out on the other side my faith stronger
[1:16:28] let's stand brothers god bless you and
[1:16:33] we read verse 10 while you stand there
[1:16:35] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:16:39] shall any plague come not not dwelling a
[1:16:46] security in the midst of Evil's a peace
[1:16:50] in the midst of storm safety amidst
[1:16:57] desolation these are our promises we
[1:17:02] claim them
[1:17:03] oh brother done what if we get sick what
[1:17:05] kind of anyway we climb them right on
[1:17:08] through it because he will be with us
[1:17:10] and our sickness and our trouble and our
[1:17:14] disparity of life he will help us
[1:17:17] through this time that B Valley all of
[1:17:19] your brothers and sisters I know your
[1:17:21] hearts are broken
[1:17:21] I left my little clean at home a while
[1:17:24] ago so sad and just feeling so
[1:17:26] despondent many of you I'm sure you feel
[1:17:28] the same way tonight
[1:17:29] some of the brothers are going to be
[1:17:32] able to meet with ten people in their
[1:17:34] sanctuary and maybe ten oh when the
[1:17:36] fellowship hall and you know be able to
[1:17:38] manage it that way
[1:17:39] because they have a small congregation
[1:17:41] time we get that done this thing will be
[1:17:43] done past anyway so I figure we just go
[1:17:46] through it as best we can and it'll make
[1:17:49] a stronger when we come out on the other
[1:17:51] side y'all won't y'all just be chomping
[1:17:55] at the bits for the next time we're able
[1:17:57] to come and you set here in the house of
