[Music] [Applause] activities foreign [Music] I know it may sound simple but it's more than I can explain there's no other words to tell you than to say God's been good in my life I've been blessed beyond my wildest dreams as I go to sleep each night by my side he's always good we don't know [Music] when I cried those bitter tears oh but I found his arms around me as I face those darkest fears I've had more games than losses [Music] and his grace [Music] [Music] [Music] by my side is this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] as I go to sleepy tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] I sit through it all [Music] God's been good [Applause] has he been good to you we sing this around here a lot but let's sing Nobody Loves Me Like You Love Me you know brother Brown talked about how God was like a diamond that had so many different facets but one God's been good to me and I'm glad he's been good too I mean I know he loves me that he's been good to me but one thing I love about God is is he let me understand that in this age of laodicea when they don't want to be corrected God loves his people so much he corrects them and his people love him back for correcting him so when brother Downey has to come out and preach hard to us and preach all over us then I'll say thank you Lord for loving me Nobody Loves Me Like You Love Me Jesus I standing on your amazing [Music] I worship you as long as I am breathing God you are faithful and true Nobody Loves Me Like You [Music] know more I see you when the sunrise every morning it's like a picture that you paid it for me a love lettering in the sky [Music] stories Lord I could have had a really different stories but you came down from heaven to restore say [Music] leave my life everybody now with all your heart [Music] oh Nobody Loves Me Like You Love Me Jesus Christ [Music] breathing Gods you are faithful and true Nobody Loves Me Like You and a lot of body Loves Me Like You Love Me Jesus [Music] I am thank you Nobody Loves Me Like You thank you Lord Nobody Loves Me Like You Do [Music] thank you Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord I'll go ahead and give him a hand he's worthy of it thank you Father thank you Father praise the Lord let me knows that's the truth a mama's love can be a great thing a Father's Love friends that are as faithful as they can be but nobody can love you like Jesus turn with me tonight the book of Romans if you would Romans chapter 12. verse 4. Romans 12 4. for as we have many members and one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another now God made Islands there's some beautiful islands in the world I've seen some but God never made a human being to be one islands are made out of dirt volcanic pumice and all that sort of thing islands are not intended to be made out of flesh and blood Satan is the one who makes Islands out of people so that people will pull away from the body and then when they get in trouble they have nobody to help them because they're an island so listen what Paul said so we being many are one body and one body in Christ every one members of one another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith now listen how gifts will operate so if a person has prophecy they can only prophesy according to the proportion of faith that is given to them or Ministry let us wait on our ministering so a person who feels like they're called to preach in the first trip they want to make is Johannesburg or Durbin South Africa or something like that they're contrary to the scripture unless of course they're from Durbin Jesus had his disciples to start at home yeah that's right so Ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teaches on teaching or he that exhort us on exhortation he that give us let him do it with simplicity so now we move from gifts as far as ministerial gifts and things like that then we move into people that are gifted by God to be able to give things other than spiritual Administration let him do it with simplicity he that rule us so here's position holders in the church he that rule us with diligence he that show us Mercy with cheerfulness I'm a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray God bless you hold your needs your requests on your heart father we're so honored tonight that we once again could be gathered together Lord in this place that we have built dedicated for saving for healing for deliverance or worship for prayer it's not gathered as an arena it's not gathered so that we could come for entertainment it's a place of worship and when you were here you said it is written my house shall be called a House of Prayer so we've not come to look at one another's hats want another shoes one another's garments but we've come to worship we're going to worship when we feel like it we're going to worship when we don't we're going to worship when we're well we're going to worship when we're sick because this is not a house of when you feel like it it is not a house of just when you are well it is a house of worship and prayer and exhortation so when we enter these doors we're going to pray we enter we're going to praise we're going to worship we're going to do everything we can to be able to make a difference we want hell to know we've had church tonight we want the angels of God to know that we had church and we want you to know when we showed up at church we didn't sleep through the service we didn't barely make it through but we were participators so father we're asking tonight in the name of Jesus take the service take the word Lord you see this prayer cloth that I have in my hand father brother Michael Bayless was a granddaughter with her eye Lord you see this child Lord or I Crossing and still not quite right Lord whenever I think of that of course I think of brother random's little girl and your God ever across that child that come across the platform was healed but also think of something closer to my heart many years ago as I stood in Alabama and laid hands on a little boy about 14 years old whose eyes were so crossed poor little fella couldn't even read but I saw you by your great miraculous power straighten his eyes right there in that service also think of my dear wife as she stands here tonight and she'll drag out the picture every now and then whenever she was little and her eyes were so terribly crossed glasses on father we know you straighten out eyes so we're praying over this prayer calls tonight in the name of Jesus may this child's eyes be straightened out speak to us tonight from your word father in the name of Jesus we ask him and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated aren't you glad to be a part of the body of Christ not only a part of the body of Christ but part of a local body wherever it is for your visitors whether it's tonight wherever it is that you go or some of you that are streaming and I know there's many that stream that don't have a midweek service so wherever it is that God has placed you in that assembly that God has given you a responsibility people I don't think still look at church quite right they almost look at church like a grocery store or a place to shop so if they prefer Ross above TJ Maxx then all of a sudden they change their preference to Target and then they go there it's sort of the way people look at church you know they just choose it on some of the strangest things I hear from message people some of the strangest most bizarre reasons for leaving One Church to go to another I mean it just absolutely will blow your mind some of the things that people say and it makes me realize that a lot of folks don't understand what church is for and really what you're supposed to choose your church by and the reason that you go to this particular church or another church wherever it is but first of all it should be that the presence of God is what is drawing you now God is the only one that can put us into the mystical body which is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then there is local assemblies and we thank God for them around the world that are there as a station a soul-saving station they're there to strengthen to elect and I've been privileged by the grace of God to stand and preach in many of them around the world and it's always it's always such a blessing because when you go you find every one of them are unique having standing in different parts of Africa and Kenya and Tanzania Zimbabwe Uganda South Africa and every one of them even though you all might categorize them as being merely Africans every one of them are different you go from you go from Brother Commodities church and Nairobi which is made up a lot of people who live from the rural areas and they'll come there and work and they will attend that church but yet their family may be back out here and there and there and then you go out in some of the rural areas and it'll be a little bit different you go over to Tanzania different different National Spirit there so they're just a little bit different go to Zimbabwe different again same way with with the states then you go to Mexico and you find a lot of the churches there been to several of them there going to South America Central America you go there a little different and you sing and that each one of us tend to sing that our church is the church God uses as the example but let me just let you in on a little bit the churches in South America don't even sing like us they don't act like us you know now the Holy Ghost moves on somebody it'll move the same way but some of you would be totally surprised if you would go in Latin America and you'd find their music don't sound nothing like ours at all it don't sound absolutely nothing like it you go to Guadalajara go to that part of Mexico and then you go down to Venezuela's I've been my brother George Smith several times and then you go to Africa every one of them is a little bit different and yet no doubt every one of them feel like that in the Millennium will all sway just like them everybody will move back and forth and everybody will do because that's what we tend to think and that's what we believe no doubt most of the people The Word of Life think that in the Millennium everybody been worshiping just like us but I don't agree with you all as a matter of fact I believe that it'll be diverse as it is here in this life that people will be made different and God made them that way and we were to do ourselves and other people a great Injustice whenever we want to use our church or our personal preference of a church and we use that that as the example church but when you read the New Testament and I'd like to take each one of them churches sometime and take every one of them by name the Ephesian church the laodicean church everyone in the Church of thessalonica and every one of them and show you the characteristics and the traits of those churches and the issues that were in those churches and you'll find out that what none of them exactly the same way because God makes them different and God calls them and makes them up from a colitos scope of the world and you come as people that were Greeks that were Phoenicians people from Cappadocia people from Jewish background people from Heathen background all kinds of different things and whenever they would come and get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost they would still bring an element of their Humanity with them now the Corinthian Church was a very gifted church it was one of the most gifted churches that we know about in the New Testament but yet they were a church with lots of problems not every church has its problems and the the Ephesian church was totally different they were one of the deeper churches in the New Testament but yet they still had their problems and Paul had to write to them husbands on how to love their wives well you'd think a deep Christian would know that but apparently some of the deep Brothers of Ephesus didn't know how to love their wives right and some of them deep women in the Ephesian Church didn't know how to obey theirs and then some of the children in the Deep Ephesus Church didn't know that they should obey their parents and they didn't know that they should respect them so as you read the New Testament what you see is the diversity and God absolutely loves to diversify his body now he did it in the natural makeup of the body and he also did it in the spiritual makeup now think of all the preachers that you have heard since you've been saved and you think of how diverse they are now look at the special meetings that we have to have brother Tim of course brother Ron and Brother David all three of them great brothers that love God that have been such a benefit to the bride and yet all three of them as different as they could be and the way they preach in the way that they Minister even in the way that they would be able to pray for people in the prayer line but aren't you glad God Don't Make ever preacher exactly the same way well God doesn't make the laity the same way either and God doesn't actually allow our trials and our tests to be the same way either now God let every one of his members now all of them that come this same way that all be bound with alcohol that all be bound with cigarettes and that all be bound will save a pornography then all of them got delivered and that's all that every one of God's children ever ever dealt with and God would save them all deliver them from smoking deliver them from alcohol and deliver them from porn well then what about all the rest of these sins out here that his bride would never conquer so what did God do God let his seed fall among heathens thank God I was one of them God let his seed fall among church people and fall here and fall there they were born under different strains under different things and they come from all these different backgrounds some of them will overcome porn some will overcome drinking some of them never drunk A Drop in their life some of them never smoked a cigarette in their life and they was as lost as everyone of them people that did so God would bring them from all different backgrounds that he could show by his grace he could save her drunk as well as he could a church member that was just as much Bound for hell as the drunk was and yet God allowed it to be so that his his grace would be able to reach to every one of them and redeem them all and then when they are redeemed they come to the spirit of God and then they find a church now the Corinthian Church of course was the one that God spoke to Paul and said I have much people in this city now he was there for about 18 months one of the longest places that he was in the New Testament brother sister this man had his hands full at that church now some of these were former prostitutes in the house of worship at a starting some of them were former prostitutes and the worship place that come from Demopolis some of them oh Lord some of the things that they did I I'm not even eloquent enough to be able to describe it to you tonight it would be 45 x rated that's how bad it was and yet God had some of them people that was his all they had to do save them fill them of the Holy Ghost but yet they brought an actual element with them you see sin itself is also very Diversified now it would probably surprise some of us here tonight to know some of the sins and some of the background of the saints that are here and you'd say you used to do that oh yeah I used to ride a Harley I was one of them guys you know so I said oh no no no surely not and I'm going to say well my goodness I've never done nothing like that well I've done this and that oh my goodness you mean you've done that you was caught up in that sort of thing yeah well that's the way God does Satan diversifies in a similarity the way that God does so if what a throne is sin that Satan had was just a Harley's and and chopper motorcycles and he had people with long hair and leather jackets while for long there wouldn't be enough cows to make leather out of but you know what Satan's got tastes for the affluent upper class Satan's got sin for the white collar he's got sand for the blue collar he's got sin for the no caller because why he diversifies sin at just the same way God diversifies the measure of Grace then God also diversifies the administration once we are saved and brought into the body now we know we all have preference I do I'll be honest with you those brothers that minister to me better than others do and I have preference I've got to be honest there's preachers that I get more out of what they say than I do others but I'm going to be honest also and say it to you this way I have never went to church and ever even when I was in Pentecost never did I go to church that I did not at least get a little something out of that service even if that preacher was not really my favorite preacher I are one that I really struggled in trying to understand you know the way you would lay it out and I'm sitting there I'm just I'm trying to think okay where in the world is he going with this and I'm sitting there and he's done what beyond the horizontal rainbow and he's standing over here with no one the art and I'm still trying to figure out your grandma and saying what in the world is that man even talking about but I've wounded if you'll go and you're really opened up and that's a god-called man that you'll be able to get something out of what he's got to say I don't believe the Lord wants us to come to the house of God and leave empty-handed but does that mean that individual will be one of your favorite preachers probably not but yet God has them for all different reasons and all different purposes now the the Corinthians Church seem to have a great explosion of spiritual gifts I know it's all types of administration I imagine they had all kinds of preachers they had all kinds of tongue talkers they had people that was prophesying that as people there was no doubts and Visions having dreams all kinds of things like that now you wonder why would God empty so much out of that church and yet we don't have any other record in any of the rest of the churches that Paul ever dealt with any gift issues at the other churches yeah brother Branham said they had gifts and those other churches too so somehow they had learned an understanding of how to be able to catch the administration and make them work effectively for the body but there was still a lot of selfishness because the big portion of the Corinthian Church was gentiles hahaha gentiles so they had a lot of problems with jealousy and measuring one another now the problem will always be when we will measure ourselves by ourselves okay so then when we are the measuring tape then we will measure ourselves by our view and we will also measure others by our view now don't sit there and look at me like you know what I'm talking about and if you this ever visited another church or you some of you just come back from camps and you went here and there and there and they do the same in a certain way and they do the music a certain way and the preacher will preach a certain way or maybe you go to another church and say wow we don't do that in our church all you see you know what you do you drug out your measuring tape boy I wish they'd do this all right brother Louie but you know what there's only one by the Louie since they're going to say and thank God for that there's only one no matter where you go you know there'll be only one Pastor like that one song leader like that and God knows how to do it that way but we can't help as humans from being that way but what we can help is allowing that to dominate what we get out of the service I'm measuring everybody else by our opinion and our thoughts because you know what they might have some quotes to be able to prove or scriptures the reason they do it this way that you aren't aware of and then you're sitting there singing oh my goodness and you're you're driving the measuring tape out of your heart and I'll tell you one thing we just cut it to 30 minutes and that's as far as our special singing goes and they won 47 and a half now I've got a problem with that tonight you know so we we do it all the time I'm not sure of how much aware that we really are and the Corinthian Church must have been really bad measuring tape people because in the way that Paul all had to deal with them but let's be gracious to them because from the time that first corinthus was written by the time second Corinthians was written which was a few years had elapsed there was a great change in this church now termite me to First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 12 and watch Paul now as he's going to bring bring them a great Parable and he's going to use a parabolic symbol and he's going to type it like the human body to help them to see how diverse their human body is and maybe God would use this no doubt Paul fell inspired I believe he did to be able to use the human body and the human anatomy to be able to show the Corinthian Believers that as they were diverse and they had different functions in the spiritual body that even though God mirrored that by the natural body so he said as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one on body being many are one body so also is Christ now watch so he starts with the natural man and he will take just the Big Image first before he breaks it down now he says as the body is one so here I stand tonight as one you're sending those one I'm sitting there and yet I have all these different members all these different things I've got all these cells and all these things in my body that do all these different things but yet when you call Donnie all of them will answer under what one voice so I am only one person yet I've got all these systems that are at work inside my body I've got the emphatics I've got the lungs I've got all these other things that are working or when they're properly functioning what a wonderful saying a human being really is and yet all it takes is for one of them to get out of sink and get out of order and it can disrupt the whole anatomy of the human being depending upon the value of that system and it's the same way in the body of Christ now watch in verse 13 He said for by one Spirit are they all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many now watch what he's doing as a preacher he's laying a platform he's laying something out and he wants them to get a generic View and get a foundation okay Paul so what are you saying all right I'm trying to tell you that as you are a human being so is the mystical Body of Christ and as you've got fingers and you've got Knuckles and you've got sinew and tissue and sails and blood and you've got all these different things in your body yeah you are one a body and that's the way Christ is now he wants them to see because they're having problems being able to keep the order of his strength because why they're measuring each other by themselves so some would say have a gift and they would be a vocal gift we'll say it was speaking in tongues and they would speak in tongues and oh might might just make the hair raise up on the back of your neck and they were surely inspired by God to do it and then maybe someone else would interpret or someone else would prophesy because tongues of course a person standing there they're not even to do that before the congregation unless they'd be an interpreter so maybe that one would speak in tongues and there was no interpreter but someone with the gift of Prophecy would be able to stand up and they would say this this or this and then someone else said and I said well I've never spoken tongues I've never prophesied apparently there's having some issues because the gifted people were looking down on the rest of the people that they thought were not gifted I'm thinking boy you're not very spiritual actually the truth of it is some of those gifted people were not very spiritual because in their sinking they were sinking that the gifted people in the spiritual sense were the only ones that were gifted but that's not true every person that is saved is gifted amen now yours may not be publicly it may not be to stand up and speak or speak in tongues but every one of you are called for a purpose I don't care who you are I don't care how little and how small you think you are you are called to minister to the body of Christ in one way or another now they were having a real hard time because they were so lifting up the spiritual ones so say even among the ministry apparently by the way that Paul had to deal with it so some of the ones that would say were more anointed than others let me know there's preachers like that there's preachers and they don't move around a lot they don't jump a lot and they just stand there and they speak and they can be just as anointed as the manners roaming and running around and jumping and all that hey I'll thank God for both of them but you know what I doubt very seriously that the Lord Jesus preached out brother Daryl I doubt very seriously the Lord Jesus preached out Brother David solar I doubt he preached like me the Bible said he set I'd opened his mouth and precious words come out of his mouth now could we have handled that could we have handled a man that would sit and teach so what what is it that gets our attention you see if we're not careful because we're born under a certain gift and many of you have been it's like your spiritual birthmark or your burst past it will always have an impact on your life the preacher or the ministers by which you were spiritually burst under and it will do something to you and there's people that I have a connection with around the world and always will through eternity because God used my Ministry to bring them to a new birth those others that brother Daryl is born every God call man that's the exact same thing and they will be identified with them and you can't help that there's a bond between you and that individual it's basically Indescribable there's just something about it and yet that does not mean that that's the only preacher for you but that gift and that style may make an imp friend upon you and you will always lean toward a certain way now some of you come from different churches maybe and whenever you finally arrived where God wanted you it was that Ministry that made that imprint on you totally transforms you totally changing well the truth of it is because that's when you got the Holy Ghost but whenever God does that it actually does something to you and changes your nature now this is what had happened to some of the Corinthian people they had been burst under a certain thing and many of them no doubt were just as emotional when they were Sinners oh that's what gets me is a lot of folks that you know that they they're a certain certain way and if you'd follow them back to their life they were that boy pretty much when they was a sinner but they want to attribute it toward us all right so they got the Holy Ghost but if they'll really recall themselves and they'll remember how they were when they got saved they were the life of the party when they was going to parties and what are they now the life of the party in church well praise the lord well they want to attribute that to all being spiritual no it's not always because they are spiritual it's because of their natural makeup now the Corinthian Church boy they was really having a struggle now Paul wants to bring it down to this simple way he said if the body for the body is not one member but many now you imagine their attention as it's coming out to themself their human anatomy and they might when they heard this preacher when they saw it in the writing that Paul had given to them and then they began to realize well I can see that I can see that what if my whole body was a hand wouldn't that be weird so can you imagine up here before you tonight was a walking five-fingered six foot 160 some pound man well not actually a man but a hand wouldn't that be strange are you imagine when Paul by the spirit of God begin to get their attention and I thought now that would be really really bizarre if I was just a walking hand well that's the way some folks are spiritually because they feel like they are all they need so they don't need a pastor they don't need a church they don't need one another whatever they think they are in Christ they think they're the entirety and they're an island well first of all that's contrary to the Bible second is contrary to the message now watch the way Paul says it's something that's really weird I mean how preachers can can type certain things like like Paul's fixing to do if the foot shall say okay now look I realize I'm not as smart as some of y'all all right but if any of you all ever seen a talking foot in this strange that Paul would take the anatomy and say something that was not even realistic this is not going to happen it never has happened and never will happen you believe God led the man to use this now wonder why because the spirit of God knew that would be something about taking the anatomy of a human being and being able to make the connection that would send a spiritual message that would reverberate for two thousand years I wonder how many times this has been preached on since Paul wrote it I wonder how many saints of God around the world their eyes have come open when their Pastor or an evangelist or a teacher or a prophet begin to deal with this in the word wonder why well if they're normal every one of them have a hand and a foot now every one of us do not have the gift of Prophecy ever one of us do not see Visions every one of us may not have spiritual dreams every one of us may not prophesy or do this or that or the other so why didn't God use that God wanted this man to use something that the majority of the people could be able to look at on their own and say wow if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body now I want you to notice now the lowest member of the body speaking to a more exalted member of the body I want you to notice now your hand and your foot if you're normal so you've got five fingers five toes it's the only two that Paul uses that have a miniature reflection in each other five five ones and one extreme and the other is an ocean now maybe some of you all think you have pretty feet that's one thing I've yet to see now maybe I've never seen yours but you know the foot now let's let's look at the foot the lowest part of us the part that takes all the weight the part that smells the part that aches the part that bears the load day in and day out the part that most of us never let others see I say this time here tonight but sandals on I see a few but very few and yet the hand look at the hair a member of humility now I've never been a barefoot guy I'm glad I didn't live in the days of Jesus because I couldn't handle sandals I don't own a parent I wouldn't have a pair I don't care what they cost you couldn't give them to me because I ain't worried them I'm a tender foot I always have been I do good to get them go to the bathroom back to the bed at night I wear shoes God made shoes you a better friend though you want to the Bible says let your feet be shot with the preparation of the Gospel not just not with souls and sandals and all that shoes shoes and the last year and a half as you know I've been meeting with this plantar fasciitis I'm always appreciated my feet they took me a lot of places but oh how I've appreciated them in the last year and a half when they weren't hurting now for those of you that know what that is it's that plantar on the bottom of your foot which comes up like this goes up the back of the ankle a little bit and it gets stretched and strained I have got enough inner Souls sent to me from people around the world that I think I'm going to open up a shop and I thank you all for sending them because I've tried every one of them God knows it I've had shoes sent to me from Amazon from people in Canada from people in the states and I thank you for every prayer I've got alongside of what's my insert place I'm opening up a shoe place as well because people heard me talk about it and they love me and they want to try to help me get some comfort well I wonder if we couldn't learn from that so we look at our hand and it is the part that is most expressive now I suppose that I could learn to walk on my hands I might be a little bit old for that though now you think you could learn to walk on your hands some of you don't think he's some what you think it might be top heavy the other way around or something are you worried about that well people do right how many you've got these fingers which are longer than your toes I suppose you could do it but it would not be an order because God made you to stand up this way and to walk on your feet but yet the feet the feet are Saul misunderstood so abused and you don't already think that much about them unless they go to hurt me and then you baby them and you pet them oh man one brother now I I don't I don't remember but he'll remember I'm sure you'll hear you hear me because he streams us up in the Midwest and he sent an email to the library and he said tell brother Donnie I had it and I went to a podiatrist and he told me to try these inserts which I bought them and tried them but he also told me to get a foot massager and he gave me the name of it and I got it let me set this way I've got two of them because it was basically the only thing that I found that really helped me and it really did help me I used it today as a matter of fact so my feet have got more attention in the last year and a half than they have the last 67 years but the only reason they've got attention was because they were hurting some days when I was over here laying Stone and I'd leave five six seven o'clock whatever I go home I had to call Carol one day to help me get out of the truck because I couldn't get out of the truck I couldn't walk I couldn't walk I saw like this she had to help me get in the house but normally I would just jump out of the truck and walk in there and now think of sometimes the members of our assembly and the members of the mystical body that sometimes we may tend to look down on the weaker ones or ones that we saw all you know they're just big babies they need attention over this or that or the other but maybe they're going through a real hard time I don't mind telling you my feet have got more attention in the last year and a half than my hands well except for a while ago and I cut my thumb and my finger and then I needed some attention because it's pouring the blood so the Deacon had to bring me some Band-Aids but what do we do whenever we have something that's going on all of our Focus goes to that particular part so I'm standing in there and I cut my finger on the little Rim under the the sink there so I turn the water on blood pouring out everywhere got blood on the sink blood on everything so what I do I change my attention from my feet to my finger well that didn't just do it once I'm so accident prone I cut this finger and I cut this thumb so it's difficult for me so what did I do all of my attention was aimed toward what the hurt parts how many knows what I'm saying well you understand that if we're not careful we will tend to magnify the strengths oh look at this great man look at this great woman they're so strong and I said what about songs oh my oh my goodness you can't believe how babyfied they are they're just pansies they're this and that and the other well maybe they need you to help them maybe they need you oh my how long will it how long should we how long would it be your advice that I should take care of my feet should I give my feet a deadline and if you don't straighten up hey I'm sick of this you understand that Left Foot Right Foot I'm sick of this stuff I'm single wearing insoles in my shoes I'm tired of it I'm sick of sitting down on my foot massager for three and four hours at a time I'm giving you till next week and if you don't straighten up well come on help me now what should I do am I going to take them off am I gonna buy some Woodlands am I am I going to get some concrete wonder what am I going to do you know what I'm going to do the same thing you do if it was yours you're gonna baby them you're gonna love on them you're going to pet them you're going to rub them you're going to vibrate him you're going to massage them you do whatever you got to do to get them babies well so you can be able to walk around and maybe dance a little bit if you feel like it maybe shouting on the devil's head how long will you do it as long as it takes so I say if we do our feet that way our hands that way our head that way our shoulder that way I say we ought to feel that way about the body of Christ so if we've got weak members how long do we deal with them we deal with them until we are changed that's how long we don't give them six months and then we'll throw them away no we are here to lift you up we are here to help you [Applause] oh my so the lowest member of the body which contacts the Earth constantly looks up to The Honorable part and says now listen there's my foot's in it hey hand I'm not you every time he preaches he gets up there and does all this stuff and if you tie his hands he couldn't say a word he's like most pictures he couldn't say nothing if his hands is tight nobody never looks at me nobody ever even knows I'm hardly attached to his legs except they just seem walking around they don't nobody ever look at me like they look at you when he makes all these symbols and Counting and all they are you get all the attention don't you you get all the attention what do I get plantar fasciitis so because I don't get the attention I'm quitting I beg you don't give up on me now oh my goodness it sustains the whole weight of the body very best raping you look at think what a miracle our feet are outside is 10. about that long maybe something like that I want you to look at all the weight all the structure that it supports every day of my life it has done so for 67 years I ain't had to have new new feet hadn't had to replace them and had to go back and trade them in get another pair they've done this ever since I was born and I took my first step so here they move they stabilize me they support me they get no glory to be honest with you I don't remember really I don't recall how long it's been since I even thanked him for it y'all think I should I wonder if the church is not made up well really I don't have to wonder I know it is the church is made up like this in the mystical body there are people that are the support in the natural Church body there are people that are the support I'm not telling me just financially but they're there they're faithful they help stabilize everything they may never be called up here to pray because they'd be so tongue-tied and so embarrassing or tell them what they'd say they'll never want any type of Limelight they'll never want to be able to get up in front of nobody but you can depend on them when the pastor stands up and looks out they're there unless there's something bad going wrong either thy ever service they're just there oh my thank you feet thank you feet [Laughter] Hallelujah thank God for the feet that have been around the world for 2 000 years that have supported the Gospel of Jesus Christ and give it its stability oh my God so the humble speaks to the more honorable which is the closest one that resembles itself is it amazing what a contrast between the five and the five this one does not bear my weight this one does not carry the load it's the one that gets more Glory but I'm glad I don't have two feet here and two feet here that would really be bizarre right can you imagine trying to eat with a foot feeding you can you imagine how now the defeat cannot survive without the hands now remember in this it's the ministry in this is the deacons or every person that's in the body of Christ every one of you finds your identity somewhere in the spiritual parallel of the anatomy of the body of Christ so the civility of the church and those that are able to stand there and then you have the legs which are The Columns of support and then you have all of it joined together minds of great mystical Body of Christ is joined the same way so can we really say well we don't need you we don't want you we don't want you or can you say or should you even say they don't need me I'm not important you should never say that you should never let that lie come out of your mouth because that's what it is you're not supposed to lie you are needed in the body of Christ you are needed if God has made you a part of this church you are needed in this church whatever God places you now watch Paul says if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I find it amazing as brother Branham would travel around it of course he would preach and call us sins most churches was not big enough to be able to hold his crowd so they would contact different pastors say go to Phoenix and they'd contact him let him know he was coming and then them pastors would bring their people in and that's what made up the meeting and brother brought him over and over again whenever he would go to operate in the gift and then praying for the people he would call the pastors to come up and it's amazing when you go to studying this how many times he repeats this and he said now a lot of evangelists come to town and he said they want you to think they're the main one he's having these pastors right here are just as called of God to pray for the sick as I am now what's he doing a stronger one is giving the weaker looking ones their proper place in the gospel now you see this as part of the imagery of the strong to help the weak I found it I just did a search on this not long ago and it was amazing how many times over and over and over again I quoted to tell you not long ago that he said he stood at the end of a prayer line in one particular place and he put the Pastors in front in front of him and he said by the time the majority of the people got to him they were already healed why because God honored the prayers of those passions now why did he do that none of them pastors would ever be what he was he was what the eyes The Seer none of them pastors that ever did that and he said now your pastor won't do this he said because there's only one to a generation and the church said and he knew they would not do that but he wanted to give them their proper position not only the eyes of the preachers but in the eyes of the congregation you see some preachers lost to go around and project like that they are greater than all the rest of the pastors oh my that man needs an understanding himself don't but that was not the spirit this message was delivered in it was delivered in the spirit that the prophet had his position but he himself said he would not make a good pastor he was not a good pastor he said and he never would make one but he said there are those that God has called to be such so he did not do away with the pastors did not do away with the Evangelist but he placed them and then the greater gave the honor to the weaker you see every Pastor is always weaker than the prophet of the age praise the Lord absolutely and will never go up as high as he did not intended to and it's up to those who are higher elevated to be able to look to the feet and say look feet we need you you are important to us you may not have as many miracles and some preachers no doubt feel like the feet in the body of the mess they feel like nobody hardly knows them they've never preached a convention and never will and certain certain ones are the ones that preach you know all the conventions around the message but always supposed to look at these other brothers that's never invited for such and say well they don't amount anything well I'll tell you one thing I'm not going to do that because we are absolutely breaking God's word when we will take the hands and point the hands down to the feet and say you're not important oh yes they are important you sit here tonight brother sister every young person in this church is important you're important to God and you're important to us every young sister every young man every middle-aged man every elder man and woman come on church say Amen with me everyone that God gives us to be a part of this assembly you ought important to us and if God made you a part of our assembly we need you just like you need us and don't you to get discouraged and say well it's a big church they don't need me big bodies do big bodies need feet do big people need feet do skinny people need feet do middle-sized people need feet well I guess we all need feet don't we so whether you're a little church or a medium-sized church or a big church we need every member that God put us together with [Applause] oh my God oh help us Jesus because I am not the hand the instrument of communication and action that liberally imparts and nourishes the body remember the Homer Longoria says he wished God would have put his Mouse right here so when he sat down at the table he could just rake it straight in the brother Homer buddy you look really strange with your belly talking hahaha now look at the hands we have hands in the church we have hands in the ministry of the body look at all this symbolism it's absolutely awesome when you look at it right but is everybody a hand some people they could just get in there and they just go to doing things like wow I wish I could do that I wish I'd be able to do that well somebody's got to be a big toe brother well wouldn't that be some of you it's a big toe in the body I don't say right now that none of you want to be that you'd rather be the thumb right watch how your fingers were parallel to them toes and yet God made every one of us a gifted us with certain things and the worst thing we can do is sit there and compare ourselves to so-and-so they get blessed so much they shouts it like every time they go to church they worship and I just struggle and struggle and but keep on struggling keep right on pressing keep right on pressing Little Lily till you'll get up out of that old muck in that pond and you'll shine as bright as that one the shouts and screams and Hollows come on somebody you'll be able to do exactly what God wants you to do because your place in the body for a reason now watch this one does so many more works than the foot look what the hands can do the hands can break eggs my hands can you know take stuff and and work don't you just love to watch people do stuff with their hands I think it's just something about just mesmerizing well me anyway you know they just wow how do they do that you watch guys and I sit down in Arizona several years ago brother Ron Peterson this wife Carol and I and there's a guy there's an artist studio and he made these Bronze Statues and he would take and do these things in Motley clay and he was putting them together and just took a ball of something another clay and he would take this and transform it into a horse and he would take and shape the hoof now brother Ron Peterson's daddy was a jockey actually and he won the Santa Maria whatever saying and whatever it's called one of them deals out there he was a jockey so he knew Mickey Rooney and all them guys well by the Ron looked at that and he said buddy he said you mind if I tell you something about that horse he said no go ahead they said well I'm Cowboy he said my daddy was someone said oh your daddy was so-and-so yeah he said I knew about your daddy he said you've got that horse falling wrong now the horse is coming to him the rider was on his back and this guy had him falling in the wrong way he said he'll never fall that way he'll fall this land that way why won't this stand in there that God grabbed a hold of that leg of that horse and the man of his own next minute is gone so he took brother Ron's advice so brother Ron from his memory and from being around horses all of his life this guy probably never even been on the back of a pony more likely so he was just doing what he saw but he was a man who knew who knew and it totally transformed the image of that image that he was trying to make on that horse simply because a man walked in there at the right time now no doubt he would have went right on and made it and made it totally wrong and people would have paid because those things were thousands of dollars a piece when he made them and they would have said isn't that great every one of them would have been wrong and probably nobody never even noticed him unless they've been a cowboy and a cowboy to look inside that's one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in my life a horse don't follow that way that old bow-legged Cowboy walking there said what in the world he'd do them that fur I never seen nothing like out why old Joe would never fall that way and that sat here like we're not careful that's the way we are we're building this beautiful image of this and that and the other but we don't want to do what somebody else says we want to build it the way the Lord Jesus says and the Lord Jesus has got feet and legs and eyes and hands and tongues and ears he's got all that in the body and every one of them are important to him praise God notice in verse 16. under the ear shall say again something that's not going to happen if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body it's the telephone out of the body well you say brother Tony that's crazy I know it is just as crazy for some of us to say what we say well I'll never be a big Diss and a great big doubt and I'll never I don't guess I'm really important uh-huh so your ear just talk to your eye so the ear oh don't you love your ears I mean not necessarily maybe the shape of ears are funny I mean people's ears everybody's ears you so you ever notice people's ears I'm not let me not getting that people have different shapes some are long some tilt backwards Little Joe for any one of the reasons he carries this microphone around because you can't keep on these on his ears because the way his ears slant back you can't already make one of them fit so it just gets in a big strength and drops something right down there and forget the ears so everybody's ears is not exactly the same but yet if they're normal and they function properly what a blessing they are well where would we be tonight if we didn't have ears we wouldn't be able to enjoy the birds women be able to enjoy singing we wouldn't be able to enjoy music only feel the vibration as you come into our body how much we would miss by the ear but if the ear got this mentality well I can't read and I thought I couldn't read the ear is not supposed to read all right some of y'all looking at me funny I'm gonna let my ear read this next scripture well come on now you said you wasn't the eye you wanted to be like the eye so go ahead makes just as much sense for somebody that you're trying to take somebody else's place in the body but whether they're big pointed flat round fat whatever they are where would you be in your life without them some of you that's getting older you know how it is what what'd you say of course one of the first things you should start making excuses that's thinking heater so loud I can't hear nothing well the engine the traffic is so loud out there okay here's nothing no more go ahead and admit it buddy you're getting old Lord God children it's one thing to lose your hearing sense of hearing naturally what's even worse than that it's when people become dull of hearing spiritually and you try to tell them what the word says and tell them what the message said what what okay here you can't hear you may always be able to hear the voice of God and if the ear shall say because I'm not the eye the organ that receives the sounds what a tremendous saying the eardrum is remember the Little Stirrup you saw it like whenever you went to school and they showed you all them little Parts on the inside it's incredible isn't it how those those vibrations can come in there and hit that ear and it just absolutely incredible what God made and yet be able to hear it and your eye been able to look and sing and sing it upside down and turning it back where it's supposed to be totally incredible how God made us the greatest cameras they've ever made and still haven't made one equivalent to the human eye because the DPI how the eye can differentiate between the colors how the eye can get the clarity how the eye can do all of that and science try to make cameras and other cameras and James Webb's telescope and all that and my little eye can beat him they spend billions of dollars sending it out there to take pictures and God stuck one inside of your head that's better than anything they've ever come up with what a great thing God made and we need eyes in the body people I don't need a pasture but you do you need a man on the Watchtower to say watch out the devil's coming watch out watch out be careful watch out people say oh I don't need nothing I'm down inside the walls yes you do God puts a man in the Watchtower and he's listening and he's hearing and he's watching and he's seeing and say wait a minute there's a dark time coming everybody make ready get ready we're fixing to leave this world oh my God so the ears say to the eye I don't have the ability to see I guess there's no name even go back nobody needs me yeah we did yeah we do let me tell you I have a special admiration friends we're brothers in this message many of them have stood and preached to 20 and 30. for years of their life to stand before a Congregation of several hundred they'll never bail out to do it and if we're not careful we'll tend to look down so well I guess God couldn't trust them as much I guess they're not very trustworthy I admire those men don't you brother Darryl brother Daryl travels sometimes 12 and 14 hours flying or driving to preach to ten 15. 20. of course you know brother there whenever he gets her when the crowd was real small of course he just stands there and reserves his energy and doesn't say very much because there's not very many no he preaches with all of his might well brother Downs never got to preach the convention over Ruth brother Dales never got to preach a convention in South Africa he's never got to preach the thousands at one time so some people look at brother Daryl they kind of looked down at him I'll tell you one thing they're going to have a hard time send before the Lord one day because they measure Everybody by themselves when thousands times thousands of people will walk up and stand with brother Daryl that got saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost heals miracles signs wonders all kinds of things come on Church oh you don't hear him talking about it much I've been trying to encourage him to share more things with you because I want you to know how God is moving among us and you're looking for a great evangelist or a great this or that or the other open your eyes we have them I said open your eyes we have them they're in our ranks they're in our midst we don't need television preachers to tell us about God we don't need to reach outside the message to get into the direct contact of God we've got it we've got it but sometimes we don't see it because of what we identify great is oh my God it's amazing how each one of these that Paul uses when he shows this parallel and it says if the Earth shall say because I'm not the eye I am not the body now he makes the statement then he asks the question is it therefore not of the body verse 17 if the whole body were an eye let's say something always looking at me funny there a while ago whenever I took one of them individuals made it but I got that from the Bible wouldn't it look weird to have a six foot eyeball standing up here one great big apple I said that's spooky brother Donnie yeah it is spooky and that's what people try to do to the ministry they want to take one aspect of the minister they want to take the prophets aspect of the ministry which is the eye and say that's all you need well come on now oh yeah that's what the tape only people do that's what they want they want the eye only that's all they want they don't want nothing else but the eye but you don't have a body without having all of it put together so it's the same thing well brother Don is my favorite preacher and if he ain't preaching I just ain't going I believe I've got a slight headache that might be the best time for you to go brother I might be preaching every day [Music] you see Satan wants to hone us into one preacher and then all he's got to do is bring something between you and that one and you no longer believe in Preachers at all oh somebody preach when they deny you see thank God for the eyes thank God for the lips thank God for the ears thank God for the hands thank God for the feet praise the Lord Church do we need them all are you glad we've got them all not only natural but in the spiritual body let me find a place to close if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole body were hearing where the smelling a bless the heart some people that's all they have is a big eye except it's not e-y-e you got it what if the church consisted only of the imminent lightbringers which are preachers so what if the church consisted only of preachers no Leia tell loud so you don't preach on preacher level and talk on preacher level because preachers study on a different level than led to them and they talk different so where would be the laity that would live it so if it was all laity and no preacher don't you see it makes no sense so what do we need every one of them that God put in the body Wendy organ players piano players guitar players y'all really needed one of them right now you need bass guitar players and we need all of this but everybody who's so talented can't be on the platform at the same time so it's hard sometimes to play second fiddle there's been more people leave the church church is I should say over that fact right there than probably you'd want to know because they don't get to play enough so they go somewhere else I thought we went to church what was was fed the most oh where'd I got that at I mean I just listened to tapes and stuff like that so I'm used more over here I'm used more of an eye I can be uh and I thought we went to church where we get fed the most [Applause] well everybody know but God has set the members every one of them in the body in the way that it pleased everybody that was in the body because God didn't want to make nobody mad or in us and so God see free whenever we question where we are and what we are heart we're questioning him so if he made you a foot and you've got an issue with being afoot you don't have a problem with me you don't have a problem with the eyes or the ears or the hands you have a problem with him who puts you there because you're thinking I know I could be there I'm so somehow I could be able to take this and stick it there I can't take my foot now let me take my what y'all saying you don't like it what if I did this now you're laughing but I wonder how many of us have tried to do the same thing with ourself I'm sick and tired I'll be in a foot and if God Made You the little toe this little pig went to the market so the pig stayed home but if God puts you on there and you're important to us and I hope after this service tonight will be more important to each other than we've ever met and if we see something dropping along the Wayside and we see some getting discouraged with us owl that I'm wrong let them let them drop off the side no no we pray we reach out who knows how many more God's got out here that needs to be saved needs to be filled with the Holy Ghost the last one might be sitting on a bar stool tonight in Johnson City and their name is on the book what if it's the last one that'll ever be in and make the bride and when that one man or woman comes in they get filled with the Holy Ghost they might walk back down the back and it might be a woman dressed so ungodly that us men couldn't even look her way her hair may cut off like she may have lipstick on it may look absolutely terrible but down inside of her heart might be a seed of God we might not even want to get our hands dirty to lay hands on her but I'll tell you brother if God can get a hold of her and transform her won't it be wonderful if God can get a hold of a man and he smells like alcohol and marijuana and everything else but down inside of their laying a seed of God and we may look at him say plural saying probably just a serpent seat Well I don't have that microscope that you have I'm going to treat him as a potential bride member I'm going to treat them come on now I think we ought to treat the people out here it's a potential seed of God because we don't know if they are if they ain't but if we think that every everybody we run into is lost and not saved more than likely we're not going to try to reach out to them we won't even be kind to him we won't even explain a little bit of the love of God but if we'd say you know what that might be a seed that might be a germatized seed of God even if it ain't to see the god it might be a foolish virgin you might be the one that will lead them to the Lord they may not go in the Rapture but you'll stand there and be identified with them through eternity the prophet said somebody that you lead to Christ their name will be identified with you forever forever they'll be identified with you all you feet ears eyes nose mouth kidneys gallbladder livers blood cells whatever else you are stand to your feet praise the Lord and if they were all one member where or the body but now are they many members yet one body as I said before it's not just my responsibility or the responsibility of the Deacons to just watch out for one another and if you notice somebody's not been to church for a few Services text them call them hey missing you in the house of God you okay you're going through a trial you're going through something just want to let you know you're loved is there anything that I can do to help you don't you love him you love him if we love him right we'll love his members now let's be honest and Frank tonight there's people in our church and people in other churches that you will never be best buddies with because we Clash our human nature clashes and our human makeup but the prophet said maybe there's a certain brother you know there's just something about him you just don't want to be around him but he said if you hear something happens to that man your heart breaks why the love of God binds you together for your human makeup might Clash but the new birth ties you to one family one economy one purpose and that's the body of Christ I'm glad we're part of the body here aren't you but we aren't the only parts there's Parts all over this world I'm just glad we're a little part the spirit together before we offer a word of prayer I wonder men women boys girls each of you you say Lord I want to be a better member of this church I want to be a better member of your body I want to be mindful more mindful of my brothers and sisters maybe I've overlooked some of the feet here at the church some of the legs The Columns the strength maybe some Lord I've thought you know what they're so weak thou to just grow up but maybe they need help maybe they need to to help them through that plantar fasciitis or a time of weakness or stress or whatever it is let's not get rid of them let's not throw them out praise the Lord Lord I pray tonight that should begin with me dear Jesus if there's one of yours that I have ever treated wrong there's one of yours that I've ever been impatient with Lord I pray and forgive me Lord if there's one of yours whether it be a man woman boy a girl preacher or whatever it would be Lord that I haven't taken the proper attitude or the proper amount of time Forgive Me Lord I pray you'd search our hearts tonight all across this building Lord and those that are streaming the service Lord Jesus may we walk out of here with a different view about one another in a different view about ourselves maybe some are struggling with feeling that they're apart trying to find compatibility maybe they're looking for friends in the church and trying to find ones that they can buddy up with us would say and we know that's not just young people but that can be older people as well Lord I pray that you would help us to be able to realize that in order to function properly we need everybody that you've sent here Lord and that's all we want I've never pulled on people I have never done it all the years that I preached and I'm not going to start doing it now I want everybody here that you want here I want every sheep that you've ordained to be in my pastor but I ain't looking for nobody else's sheep because I refuse to be a sheep stealing preacher I don't I don't go around traveling around trying to pull on people or trying to make our church larger by doing such but Lord I do want everyone that you want so I pray you would help us father that we can do our part Lord may we the next time the Devil comes to us and well I don't know if I'm a part or not I don't know nobody even knows this nobody Lord may we may we come back to this service tonight I'm not like brother someone's on I'm not like sister so-and-so nobody ever even calls my name I never get no recognition help us to realize we're like the talking foot the talking ear the talking ah Lord God we need to know where we belong we need to know we're in Christ Jesus it was you who called us not a man it was you who called us not a preacher it was you who beckoned on our souls not Mom or daddy but the spirit of God you're the one who's placed Us in the body and then we cannot be run off that's the kind of Christians I want here Lord those that the word of God will not run off as we go on in time I realize more and more we've had a bunch of people sitting in our church and in message churches around the world that really don't believe this message they believe Parts bits and pieces but they do not believe this message Lord God I pray we won't turn out that way I pray you would give us an ear to hear give us hands to work the works of God give us feet Lord that can be shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace oh Lord may we be everything you've ordained us to be father that we can serve you and serve your people and serve the body Lord for we are called for this purpose Hallelujah we worship you tonight Lord oh Jesus May ever man woman boy and girl may they realize tonight they have a place a place and no one can take it a position and no one else can fill it and lord they're called to a post of Duty and if they're not at their post of Duty and a war breaks out what happens someone gets injured someone gets killed Lord they know how it is in the military if you're assigned to a certain post and you're not there and the enemy sees you're not there and the enemy uses that as a weak spot and comes in then they catch them people they're supposed to been on that post and they court-martial them some of them they send to prison and the Civil War days they shot them because they left their post of Duty so it's an important thing Lord to be where you've placed us we're not Church Hoppers that we go here and there and jump over here and jump over there we want to be at our post father because it ain't just a preacher depending on them it may be that person sitting around them that person sitting behind them that person sitting near him oh Jesus may we realize each of us have a responsibility and we're going to answer to you for that responsibility Lord help help the Word of Life Church to know I'm not the one who holds this place together it's not the deacons it's not the other ministers that are here it's all of us help every lay member to realize they have an awesome responsibility in this church the pastor's wife the deacons wives all these sisters all these brothers every young person no one can take their place oh thank you Father thank you Father We Worship You Lord can we just raise our hands once again now notice what you're raising not your feet your hands so say the Bible tells you they don't tell you to raise your feet but lifting up holy hands it never says that about the feet and then amazing even in the scriptures and you go to looking at it the glory that's given to the hands but look at the shame that is brought upon the hands if the hands are well and they don't go up so how many of you have to be begged to raise your hands so then that thing which should be an instrument of Honor then turns in to a reproach because you won't lift them in the presence of God Amen amen all my as long as I've got them and I've got strength in my arms I want to lift them up I know y'all think I'm crazy anyhow but let me just tell you I worship the Lord at home I worship the Lord man I'm down in the basement I worship the Lord whenever I'm driving down the road I raise my hands it's a common thing to me I do it every day of my life I pray every day I worship him every day I talk to him every day I love him every day I've got to walk with him every day mine ain't twice a week so it ain't unusual for me to worship Him you say you sure do worship him a lot I'm only doing here what I do every day of my life I worship him every day I I don't have that kind of religion where I only worship Him in church I worship him everywhere I love him don't you I love him someone obey his word again tonight I want to lift up these hands think some of you used to hold cigarettes between them fingers you used to hold a bottle of whiskey or wine or alcohol or something like that in them hands but tonight they're called holy hands and you can raise them up in the presence of God and say Lord I love you with your mouse take your body now take your body your feet standing in there supporting you your legs your Columns of stability while you're standing and your hands appear the top part receiving the honor raising your hands up before the presence of the Lord but don't send our mute now but tell them how you love it so what are you doing you're using all these different parts of your body to worship god well see that's the way God wants the church to be so God wants Harry to sing yeah God wants Harry to sing he wants Brother Lou what he's saying these young people that God appearance son-in while ago didn't they do a great job but God don't just want them to sing some of you might not be special singers but you can still make a Joyful Noise to the Lord with all of your heart if a whale can sing certainly by the Charles you can if a bird can be able to sing and some of them may not be able to sing very good either I don't understand bird songs I don't know if they're on key or not but they sing with all their little hearts and they Worship the Lord so what they do they take what God gave them so let's take our feet let them stabilize our body Let The Columns of our stability our legs hold us up our torso what will we do and then we'll use our brain our intelligence and we will tell the rest of our body I want you to raise your hand so so what goes up it goes up well they can't do them without the brain it can't do that without the cerebral policy or the system going up through the spine there up to the nurse sending the message out comes right out then your optic nerve says I and it comes out Lord Jesus I love you I love you then you've got your hands you've got your arms you've got the Sid news you've got the tendons and all that every minute of it's operating for one purpose to what worship God I love you Lord I love you and you're not here sometimes you want to stand there with your eyes open and then other times for whatever reason you just want to close your eyes so another part of your body will send a message to your eyes close your eyes so just on the call oh Jesus I love you I love you Lord I worship you oh Jesus and then someone say oh yes so just help your eyes praise the Lord so the whole body just centered oh I love you Lord I love you lord well that's what happens to the individual well what do you say if it happens to that one that one that one that one that one that one hundreds of us moving in this body and we're just praising loving worshiping oh Mom however service ought to be filled with the Unison of the body why say we do it yeah sing something for us here so let your feet stabilize you your Columns of stability hold your body out either with your eyes closed or open than the signal from your brain and all of a sudden you send it out and three quarters of a second it sends the message and you defy gravity you defy gravity lifting up holyhead Paul even says to the scripture even goes on to say lift up those hands which hang down and that countless which looked down Let It Be uplifted there's something about lifting your hands something about lifting your countenance lift up your heads for your
