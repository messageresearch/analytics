[44:41] want to go
[44:44] can you say that Lord if I'm if you want
[44:47] me broken

[46:10] [Music]
[46:14] maybe this is what it takes
[46:18] feel you near me
[46:21] if I'm better broken
[46:25] I have peace and knowing

[46:33] in the wisdom
[46:36] of God
[46:38] and if I'm better hurting
[46:43] you are more than Worthy
[46:49] of the
[46:49] praise I can give from a broken heart
[46:56] [Music]
[46:57] if my story's For Your Glory
[47:02] then I know it's for my goodness
[47:09] if I'm better broken
[47:14] foreign
[47:15] I'll be broken for you
[47:26] I have heard
[47:30] but now I see your Mighty hands
[47:34] you are working
[47:37] beyond what I can understand
[47:41] [Music]
[47:43] are you alone
[47:48] are worthy of my praise

[48:09] and if you want me in pieces
[48:15] still alive and I will trust
[48:18] [Music]
[48:20] I'm better broken
[48:23] I have peace in knowing
[48:29] that I'm living in the wisdom of God
[48:36] and if I'm better hurting
[48:40] you are more than Worthy
[48:46] of the praise I can give from a broken
[48:51] heart
[48:54] if my stories For Your Glory then I know
[49:01] it's for my goodness
[49:05] if I'm better broken
[49:08] [Music]

[49:38] I'll be broken
[49:41] for you
[49:46] thank you
[49:48] [Applause]
[50:04] beautiful song
[50:07] beautiful words to say
[50:10] until you're going through it
[50:13] if we could sing like that whenever
[50:15] we've gone through trials wouldn't it be
[50:17] awesome
[50:18] would you stand up and just
[50:22] Let Her Fly
[50:24] most of us sit around like this
[50:28] why me Lord
[50:30] wowzy wowzy
[50:34] hmm
[50:38] but God's merciful to us in him
[50:41] one well to be thanking him every day
[50:43] for all the good that he's done
[50:46] every day
[50:47] we just kind of think well Lord when
[50:49] you're going to do this and when you're
[50:51] going to do that I've been waiting now
[50:53] for about
[50:54] 45 minutes I mean I prayed that prayer a
[50:56] while ago how long does it take you
[50:59] from the sound of us it's going to take
[51:01] a lot longer
[51:03] let us take a trip today what do you say
[51:07] let us walk into a
[51:10] room that is very very hot
[51:14] a room that is the temperature will be
[51:17] so excruciating that
[51:20] it'll be hard for you to breathe
[51:23] but what is going on in this room is
[51:25] going to be
[51:27] very essential and necessary
[51:30] for us to be what God wants us to be
[51:33] we're going to be looking into a great
[51:35] cauldron or a vat if you wish to call it
[51:38] that
[51:39] the temperature must be at least two
[51:42] thousand and twelve degrees
[51:45] for the process
[51:47] to begin
[51:50] go and go or is this getting too hot for
[51:53] you
[51:54] first Peter
[51:56] chapter 1 verse 6.
[51:59] we're in you greatly Rejoice though now
[52:01] for a season if need be you are in
[52:04] heaviness through manifold Temptations
[52:08] that the trial of your face being much
[52:10] more precious than of gold that perishes
[52:14] though it be tried with fire
[52:17] may be found unto praise and honor and
[52:19] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[52:23] now listen what a compliment that Peter
[52:25] pays to those of us who've never seen
[52:27] him
[52:28] whom having not seen yet love
[52:33] in whom though now you see him not
[52:37] yet yet believing
[52:40] you rejoice with joy unspeakable
[52:44] and full of Glory
[52:47] receiving the end of your faith
[52:51] even the salvation
[52:54] of your souls
[52:56] praise God I may let you be remembered
[52:58] today as we pray
[53:01] heavenly father as we have our heads
[53:03] bowed in your presence Lord
[53:05] thank you for the service thus farther
[53:09] singing and the praise and the worship
[53:12] now we come to the breaking of the bread
[53:15] Lord we're praying that once again you
[53:18] would pass by this way
[53:20] and we would be able to see but the way
[53:23] the bread is broken
[53:25] that it was you who did it
[53:28] you have a marvelous way of doing that
[53:30] whether it's an African brother
[53:31] preaching or an Indian brother or
[53:33] whether it would be a brother from
[53:36] Europe different parts of the world
[53:39] but when the bread is broke it always
[53:42] has the signature about it if it's
[53:45] broken by you
[53:47] so we pray today that you take your word
[53:49] and break the bread of life to us that
[53:52] we can be helped by our gathering today
[53:54] Father I'm holding these prayer calls in
[53:57] my hands Lord and you see the needs your
[53:59] God desperate needs we're asking you
[54:02] that should move form father
[54:04] Lord I pray for Lance today you see dear
[54:07] God in the home in the bed and
[54:09] can't hardly move because of his back
[54:11] been bothering him for several days I
[54:13] pray in the name of Jesus that should
[54:15] move for him today
[54:17] father I want to thank you for giving
[54:18] Erica a good day yesterday
[54:21] she was able to get up and cook and
[54:24] clean some and do some things around the
[54:27] house we're just so grateful Lord God
[54:31] I told her last night this is only going
[54:33] to be one of many we're believing Lord
[54:36] God that you're going to completely turn
[54:38] it around
[54:39] and restore her father
[54:42] speak to us today Lord God In The Name
[54:44] of Jesus we ask
[54:46] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[54:49] you may be seated we certainly welcome
[54:51] each of you here today to the house of
[54:53] the Lord and
[54:57] let me call your attention back to verse
[54:59] 7. when Peter writes this and he says
[55:02] that the trial
[55:04] of your face
[55:06] being much more precious than gold
[55:11] now Peter didn't say that actually your
[55:13] face
[55:15] was more precious than God
[55:17] read it there if you'd like
[55:19] but he says the trial
[55:22] of your face
[55:25] isn't it amazing now we know that Faith
[55:27] there's no question about it but faith
[55:29] is more precious than gold but this is
[55:31] not the emphasis that Peter is placing
[55:35] on in this verse but he's making the
[55:38] comparison of faith and comparing it to
[55:41] Gold well how could that be well it's
[55:44] not just that Faith itself is compared
[55:47] to Gold but it's the transforming or the
[55:50] changing of the gold that Peter is
[55:54] comparing Faith to read it again with me
[55:56] that the trial of your face the trial of
[55:59] your face being much more precious than
[56:03] that of gold that perishes though it be
[56:06] tried with fire
[56:10] that it might be found unto praise and
[56:12] honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus
[56:16] Christ so the testing of our faith is
[56:21] worth more than gold but also worth more
[56:25] than the testing of gold
[56:28] now we know that there's been many many
[56:31] gold rushes down through time and
[56:33] there's something about gold man
[56:35] absolutely loves it no question about it
[56:37] he loves it and it is caused so many
[56:41] deaths and so much suffering and so many
[56:45] hardships if you've ever really looked
[56:47] at many of the gold rushes that have
[56:49] been down through time and you realize
[56:52] it was very few that ever got rich well
[56:54] who got rich in some cases more than
[56:56] anybody else was the guy who owned the
[56:59] general store because he jacked up
[57:01] everything that he had and a lot of
[57:03] people went there and they thought they
[57:06] was going to get rich and they left
[57:07] worse off than there were before they
[57:10] ever went and yet we know there's
[57:12] something about gold still to this day a
[57:15] lot of our Market is based upon the
[57:17] precious metals of the earth gold silver
[57:19] brass all kinds of things that are there
[57:22] and God puts him there he knew that man
[57:25] would use them but he also knew that man
[57:27] would abuse them so Peter is comparing
[57:30] and he wants the Saints then and us as
[57:32] well to see that as as worthy as gold
[57:36] was and during this time frame when
[57:37] Peter writes this uh gold was a great
[57:40] great thing and it's always been we know
[57:43] since man founded even the Book of
[57:44] Genesis before man ever started started
[57:47] mining gold the Bible mentions and God
[57:50] had Moses to write it down when he
[57:52] talked about the four rivers that come
[57:54] out of the Garden of Eden and he began
[57:56] to write to this one particular area and
[57:59] he mentioned it by name and he said the
[58:01] gold is great there so God even himself
[58:05] took note of this of what gold would
[58:08] actually be but when we're talking about
[58:10] spiritual goal of course it's a
[58:13] different thing it's not something you
[58:14] can go to a jewelry store and buy it's
[58:17] not something that you and I can mind
[58:19] it's not something that we can make but
[58:21] it's something that God starts molding
[58:23] in us and of course before it can be
[58:26] refined you first have to have something
[58:28] thing to begin with so when people find
[58:31] the ore and I've seen a little bit of it
[58:33] and and see little specks and little
[58:36] small pieces you know where they get it
[58:38] but yet it's not in its purest form
[58:41] whenever they go to digging it out now
[58:44] depending on how pure that you want to
[58:47] make it you can make it more pure and
[58:49] more pure but what actually does it is
[58:52] fire and temperature so you've got to
[58:55] run it through one process and then you
[58:58] let it cool and then you take it back
[59:00] again and then you're emptying more off
[59:02] and more on so Peter found a great
[59:05] parallel between gold and our face that
[59:09] is compared to it now ultimately says
[59:11] whenever you look at the natural gold of
[59:14] the earth it is absolutely and will one
[59:17] day be destroyed it will be annihilated
[59:21] all the metals of the earth that have
[59:23] such precious value now will one day one
[59:25] day rather be destroyed when the atomic
[59:28] bomb arms will bring this place almost
[59:31] to Total Annihilation there won't hardly
[59:34] be anything left but the Lord God will
[59:37] keep the frame and the frame will be
[59:40] refurbished now notice he says that gold
[59:44] no matter how valuable that it is that
[59:47] the trying of our face is even greater
[59:51] because gold can perish now you can
[59:54] bring it to a spot to where it can be
[59:57] destroyed it can be absolutely
[1:00:00] annihilating and gold being refined by
[1:00:03] fire is whenever the dross begins to
[1:00:07] rise now say it like this several years
[1:00:10] ago Carol and I stood in South Africa
[1:00:12] and we went to a gold mine and it was
[1:00:14] one that that pretty much mined
[1:00:17] everything out and what they were still
[1:00:19] doing is they was taking the the
[1:00:21] trailings of the of the great big piles
[1:00:23] of dirt now years and years ago they was
[1:00:27] only able to take out so much of the
[1:00:30] gold out of the trailings as they call
[1:00:32] it and but here's these humongous mounds
[1:00:35] of dirt and crushed up Stone but they
[1:00:38] found out that his man began to
[1:00:40] understand more about it that he could
[1:00:42] run that same dirt through another
[1:00:45] chemical process which has been highly
[1:00:48] refined and they were able to get more
[1:00:50] gold out of that pile of dirt they'd
[1:00:53] been Landing there some of it for a
[1:00:54] hundred years some of it for 110 years
[1:00:56] but yet running it through a different
[1:00:59] process they was able to take more and
[1:01:02] more gold so they had this pot of gold
[1:01:04] and it was setting over a molten fire it
[1:01:08] was fire that was so hot and the God
[1:01:10] that was standing there doing it there
[1:01:12] was a couple of them and they had to
[1:01:14] have these heat resistant suits in order
[1:01:17] to be able to work it because it would
[1:01:20] have burned their flesh totally off of
[1:01:23] their skeleton it was so hot so they had
[1:01:26] to be dressed in a certain way and then
[1:01:29] they would take and pour it inside of
[1:01:32] this pot now this particular gold had
[1:01:35] been used over and over and over and
[1:01:39] over and over again weeks on end and
[1:01:43] they bring people to that mine and show
[1:01:45] them the same thing over and over again
[1:01:47] and this particular Ore had been used
[1:01:50] multiple times and by the time we saw it
[1:01:54] it was about
[1:01:56] 99.9 percent pure but each time it was
[1:02:01] run through the process it was making it
[1:02:05] more pure
[1:02:06] more pure now it's beautiful as it was
[1:02:10] when it was taken out of the Earth but
[1:02:12] yet it had pyrite in it it had dirt in
[1:02:16] it it had other chemicals that had
[1:02:18] fool's gold which is pyrite and it had
[1:02:21] different things in it and in order to
[1:02:24] be able to bring the Purity out of the
[1:02:27] gold what they had to do was bring the
[1:02:30] temperature up higher and higher and
[1:02:33] higher in order to separate the impure
[1:02:37] from the pure so when the fire would get
[1:02:40] hot it would cause the impurities to
[1:02:44] begin to rise to the top now they would
[1:02:47] take then a little scoop of a thing I
[1:02:50] look like a little coupon of a thing and
[1:02:52] with a long on a Long Rod where it
[1:02:54] wouldn't burn them up and it would begin
[1:02:56] to rise to the top and they could take
[1:02:59] that off well then they would bring it a
[1:03:01] little bit higher and it would become
[1:03:03] more would come out and more would come
[1:03:05] out each one of those those dips was
[1:03:08] taking the impurities from the gold now
[1:03:11] the gold is able to take that type of
[1:03:14] heat but it takes that type of
[1:03:17] temperature to be able to separate the
[1:03:19] impure from the pure are you hearing me
[1:03:22] today now if God requires and God wants
[1:03:26] us to be broken as our brothers so
[1:03:29] beautifully sung the song if that's what
[1:03:32] it requires to make us to be like he
[1:03:35] wants us to be is it that really what we
[1:03:37] want in the bottom line
[1:03:39] now if if God could get us then and
[1:03:43] truly we have value in his eyes when he
[1:03:46] finds this as we are he found us lost he
[1:03:50] found us all muddled up in the sins of
[1:03:53] the world we had Fool's Gold we had dirt
[1:03:56] we had the office mess and stuff
[1:03:58] probably have very little goal in
[1:03:59] reality but we had enough that was worth
[1:04:02] running through the smelting process so
[1:04:05] God began to allow trials to happen now
[1:04:08] the dirt it doesn't take near as much
[1:04:10] heat near as much temperature so when we
[1:04:13] first got saved God started letting us
[1:04:15] be tried God turned the temperature up
[1:04:18] to about 50 degrees and boy we thought
[1:04:20] man alive I'm doing so good I'll tell
[1:04:23] you what I'm a sweating like I don't
[1:04:25] know what and I'm going through the test
[1:04:27] and the trial praise God and God reached
[1:04:30] down on there and got a little something
[1:04:31] out of you and said it over on the on
[1:04:33] the side and you said praise the Lord
[1:04:35] I'm on my way to canaan's land and God
[1:04:38] puts you in the furnace neck the week
[1:04:40] after that God to turn the temperature
[1:04:42] up to about a hundred and you sought
[1:04:44] glory to God I'm twice as strong as I
[1:04:47] was last week and truly you were and
[1:04:50] week after week trial after trial test
[1:04:53] after test God kept turning the
[1:04:56] temperature up it kept going higher and
[1:04:59] higher and your thoughts and your
[1:05:01] shortcomings and your impurities kept
[1:05:04] floating to the top now it takes the
[1:05:07] rising of the temperature in order to
[1:05:10] separate these things from yourself but
[1:05:13] you see those things are actually in the
[1:05:16] ground and molded in the ground but the
[1:05:19] gold was created now with iron ore with
[1:05:22] silver with many of the precious metals
[1:05:24] of the earth they've got a smelting
[1:05:25] process for each one it differs one to
[1:05:27] the other because of the chemical
[1:05:29] breakdown and the type the temperature
[1:05:31] that it takes to break it down but
[1:05:33] whenever it comes into the gold of God
[1:05:36] it's refined when the draw is removed
[1:05:39] now as I stood there and I looked at
[1:05:42] that and I watched that part of gold and
[1:05:44] whatever they'd put it over there and it
[1:05:47] was so hot and I moved as close as I
[1:05:49] could without being in danger because
[1:05:51] I've got boundaries around it because
[1:05:53] they don't want you to get hurt but as I
[1:05:55] looked at it myself I thought I've been
[1:05:58] there I've been there every child of
[1:06:00] God's been there
[1:06:02] and yet some of you maybe you're there
[1:06:04] today and maybe some of you just got out
[1:06:07] and God's got you over here in in the
[1:06:10] cooling Avenue of your walk as God now
[1:06:12] and God's given you a little bit of rest
[1:06:14] and he's kind of giving you a breather
[1:06:16] and he's helping you with good things I
[1:06:18] aren't we glad he does that to us we
[1:06:21] couldn't take it if you did in France
[1:06:22] but the mercy of God knows exactly where
[1:06:25] the breaking point is for each one of us
[1:06:27] and that's the way out of his Sovereign
[1:06:29] Grace that he does so then whenever a
[1:06:32] person's face now remember it's not
[1:06:35] you're shouting that's going to the fire
[1:06:37] and it's not even your emotion or you're
[1:06:40] jumping and we believe in all that do we
[1:06:42] not but yet it's not any of that that is
[1:06:45] actually being tried it's not even your
[1:06:48] ability to sing or not to sing it's not
[1:06:51] even your ability to memorize the word
[1:06:53] to quote the word no what Peter is
[1:06:55] focusing on is the trying or the testing
[1:06:59] of your faith now what's it for brother
[1:07:01] Donnie it's to prove to you and not so
[1:07:04] much to God because God done knows what
[1:07:06] you'll be when you come out but it's to
[1:07:09] prove to you the faith that you have now
[1:07:12] you see God will allow stress and
[1:07:15] pressure to come our way he will allow
[1:07:18] sometimes relationships things with
[1:07:21] people friends family church people God
[1:07:24] will allow a stirring of our
[1:07:27] relationships in order to let a little
[1:07:30] bit of unforgiveness or bitterness that
[1:07:34] we did not realize we had and God will
[1:07:37] turn that temperature up just a little
[1:07:40] bit in order to bring that out and you
[1:07:42] know what that'll do that will cause
[1:07:44] that unforgiving spirit that you have
[1:07:47] within you to rise to the top of your
[1:07:51] gold now I'll tell you one thing if
[1:07:54] you've never had any stress uh things to
[1:07:57] go along with relationships God bless
[1:07:59] you I'm praying for you because you're
[1:08:01] going to eventually like whether it's
[1:08:03] your mama and you or your daddy and you
[1:08:05] or your brothers and sisters or people
[1:08:08] you go to church with or your best
[1:08:10] friend or whoever we're going to have
[1:08:12] them that's just part of it does God
[1:08:15] keep those from us as his people he does
[1:08:17] not as a matter of fact God will let you
[1:08:19] go through more than anybody else in the
[1:08:21] world so stress will be able to deepen
[1:08:25] actually and strengthen a Christian's
[1:08:29] walk I know we don't want to hear these
[1:08:31] words but but it's the truth so in the
[1:08:33] words of job job said it this way in job
[1:08:35] 23 when he has tried me or tested me
[1:08:39] then I will come forth as gold now I'll
[1:08:43] put this up and I want you to read this
[1:08:45] with me on the process of how to refine
[1:08:49] gold so to refine gold he must be
[1:08:53] applied to force the impurities to the
[1:08:56] surface the impurities are called dross
[1:08:59] the temperature must reach 2 thousand
[1:09:03] one hundred and two degrees Fahrenheit
[1:09:08] oh Jesus
[1:09:10] now the sad part about it is God won't
[1:09:13] allow us to take this fireproof suit
[1:09:17] into the smelter
[1:09:19] so it's the people on the outside I mean
[1:09:22] that's the way it is the preachers
[1:09:23] sometimes they're standing up there with
[1:09:25] that fireproof suit on and they're
[1:09:27] burning you up ain't they I mean they
[1:09:30] are setting you on fire and they're
[1:09:32] smiling and laughing and having the
[1:09:34] biggest time ever was well he better not
[1:09:36] laugh much because he's fixing to go
[1:09:38] through the same thing so you see it's
[1:09:41] the people standing on the outside of
[1:09:43] that are the ones that are administering
[1:09:46] and they're doing the goal the very best
[1:09:49] thing that can be done for them so the
[1:09:52] temperature must reach
[1:09:55] 2102 degrees fahrenheit as the dross or
[1:09:59] the impurities rise they are removed and
[1:10:04] more heat is supplied
[1:10:06] now watch what happens whenever dirt
[1:10:09] will be able to be released I I didn't
[1:10:12] go into an in-depth study to find out
[1:10:14] the metallurgical value and what
[1:10:16] temperature that each thing can be
[1:10:17] released but let's just look at it this
[1:10:19] way and say that dirt can be released at
[1:10:22] say 750 degrees Fahrenheit so whenever
[1:10:25] seven if the goal reaches 750 degrees
[1:10:28] Fahrenheit and then the dirt comes out
[1:10:30] and said man I'm getting out of here
[1:10:32] whoa I can't take this no more I know if
[1:10:35] I'll go up to the top I know they'll set
[1:10:37] me free I know if I'll go to the top
[1:10:40] I'll get out of here do you realize
[1:10:41] that's the way a lot of folks do God and
[1:10:44] that's the way they do Church whenever
[1:10:46] difficulties come around the church what
[1:10:48] do some people do the first little trial
[1:10:51] they bail on you they jump out the first
[1:10:54] little test comes through and the church
[1:10:56] goes through a trying time and a testing
[1:10:58] time and people say I'm about ready to
[1:11:00] look for me in the other Church go ahead
[1:11:01] dirt
[1:11:03] go ahead you dirt bag
[1:11:05] go ahead you dross come on now somebody
[1:11:08] preach with me I don't know about you
[1:11:10] when it's all said and done I want to be
[1:11:13] left in the pot
[1:11:15] amen if God's got to keep cranking it up
[1:11:18] and cranking it up Lord you ain't
[1:11:19] running me off I've got good goals amen
[1:11:22] so we'll say them that the dirt begins
[1:11:25] to this metallurgical reaction begins to
[1:11:27] happen and the goal starts you know the
[1:11:30] goal is the gold is good now believe it
[1:11:32] or not the gold is good it says I like
[1:11:34] this I really enjoy this this is my spot
[1:11:38] this is where I am this is where I'm
[1:11:41] brought to my very best Clarity this is
[1:11:45] where I'm brought to what I really want
[1:11:47] to be now this is why our Humanity our
[1:11:51] makeup does not like trials because your
[1:11:54] flesh ain't gold Jesus Christ will never
[1:11:57] see himself in your human body right now
[1:12:01] the only way he will ever see himself
[1:12:04] when you are in a human body is the new
[1:12:06] one you get on the day of the change
[1:12:09] is that right now notice in when the
[1:12:12] temperature rises then we'll say the
[1:12:14] dirt releases first and the dirt will
[1:12:16] come up from the pot wherever it's
[1:12:18] coming from each one of those little
[1:12:20] things that sell inside the go it begins
[1:12:22] to release the dirt release the dirt
[1:12:24] release the dirt and the dirt will begin
[1:12:26] to come up to the top then the
[1:12:28] individual standing out there and it's
[1:12:30] got that little thing and you'll dip it
[1:12:32] over like this like a Little Dipper and
[1:12:34] you'll go to skimming around the top and
[1:12:36] he pours that dirt on the outside then
[1:12:39] no more is coming out because it's
[1:12:41] reached the max so they've got to crank
[1:12:43] it up a little more and then they'll
[1:12:46] they'll find floating up the top oh my
[1:12:48] goodness what's I see there oh wow
[1:12:51] what
[1:12:53] that looks like temper
[1:12:57] now I know there ain't nobody here ever
[1:12:59] been through that but I'll say for these
[1:13:00] sorry centers that stream these services
[1:13:02] so there comes a little temper up to the
[1:13:05] top of it and the man reaches in there
[1:13:07] and he grabs a hold to that he begins to
[1:13:09] skim that right off the top well they
[1:13:11] let it sit for a few more minutes no
[1:13:13] more temper raises so what do they do
[1:13:15] crank the temperature they go to crank
[1:13:18] and the temperature and then they let us
[1:13:20] sit there and sit there and have
[1:13:21] remember it's boiling it's a cooking
[1:13:23] it's a cooking that gold is just a
[1:13:27] cooking and ever to ever degree that
[1:13:29] they add to it that goal says come on I
[1:13:32] can take some more come on I can take
[1:13:35] some more the whole Glory but yet every
[1:13:38] impurity inside of there is screaming to
[1:13:42] get out the dirt wants out the temper
[1:13:46] wants out the intolerance the
[1:13:48] unforgiving spirit whatever it is it
[1:13:51] wants out and that ain't but half the
[1:13:53] story God wants it out
[1:13:55] now notice the process continues and
[1:13:58] continues and continuous heat is
[1:14:02] supplied and reapplied until the gold is
[1:14:06] pure the refiner knows the gold is pure
[1:14:10] when he looks into the gold and sees his
[1:14:15] clear reflection
[1:14:18] so then here the refiner is standing
[1:14:21] there and he got some dirt off the top
[1:14:23] it got some ironpara at all he got this
[1:14:26] all temper off anxiety stress worry
[1:14:28] materialism he began to keep on doing it
[1:14:31] over and over and then the man reaches
[1:14:33] over and he looks inside of there and he
[1:14:36] can see his own image in this pot of
[1:14:40] gold here it is it's now reached over 2
[1:14:43] 000 degrees and the gold is not
[1:14:45] screaming for Mercy the gold is not safe
[1:14:48] let me out let me out turn it down turn
[1:14:52] it down I can't take it no more the gold
[1:14:56] is in its Glory why because the refiner
[1:15:01] can see himself in the goal
[1:15:06] I wonder how clear you and I
[1:15:08] are reflecting the Lord Jesus today
[1:15:13] I wonder when he looks at us
[1:15:16] does he see just a very vague image not
[1:15:20] no doubt he sees a part of himself
[1:15:22] because he's done a great work in many
[1:15:25] of our Lives has he not so we don't want
[1:15:27] to belittle that but I wonder then by
[1:15:30] looking if he would be able to look at
[1:15:31] Donnie Reagan today and he would look at
[1:15:33] you and look at you and he would bend
[1:15:36] over into the pot would he see what
[1:15:39] would he see what do you see himself as
[1:15:42] such Clarity that he'd be able to see
[1:15:45] not my eyes but his would he be able to
[1:15:48] see not my facial features but his isn't
[1:15:52] that what we want more than anything in
[1:15:53] the world now you remember in the Bible
[1:15:55] when the Lord Jesus prayed for a man and
[1:15:58] he was actually blind and he prays for
[1:16:00] this man and whenever he does the man
[1:16:03] his eyes are partially touched and he
[1:16:06] says I see men as trees
[1:16:09] I see men as truth now it is strange
[1:16:11] that the Lord Jesus would have to pray
[1:16:13] for this man twice was it just that the
[1:16:16] man didn't have enough Faith to release
[1:16:17] it all at once or what was there a
[1:16:20] Divine Purpose to be honest with you I'm
[1:16:22] not sure but we can see that the work of
[1:16:24] God is a process so here the man he was
[1:16:28] not able to see men as they are but he
[1:16:31] looked out there brother Taylor and he
[1:16:32] saw men and they they looked real vague
[1:16:35] like he said man looked like trees sorta
[1:16:38] I I ca I can't make it out well I wonder
[1:16:41] if the Lord Jesus would be able to look
[1:16:44] in the vat of our life or the cupola of
[1:16:47] our life would he see us as people that
[1:16:50] love him people that want to go to
[1:16:52] heaven people that want to be right but
[1:16:55] that's not what he's looking for you see
[1:16:57] you'd be able to look in nearly every
[1:16:59] Church in this area today and he would
[1:17:01] find people that don't want to be lost
[1:17:03] he would be able to look and not say
[1:17:05] almost every Church in the whole state
[1:17:07] of Tennessee as far as even in the
[1:17:09] United States they was none of them
[1:17:11] probably went there today and so I'm
[1:17:12] going to church so I can go to hell I'm
[1:17:14] going to church so I can be deceived
[1:17:16] because I want to be lost nobody in the
[1:17:18] right mind would want that so they're
[1:17:20] going to church because they feel like
[1:17:22] they're going to get something there
[1:17:24] that will help them be ready for heaven
[1:17:26] probably everybody who doesn't go for
[1:17:28] that reason but we'll say the majority
[1:17:30] of them do so but he's not looking for
[1:17:32] those who just want to go to heaven
[1:17:34] because that's the old song says
[1:17:36] everybody wants to go to heaven but
[1:17:38] nobody wants to die
[1:17:40] and that's what we got to do is die to
[1:17:42] ourselves
[1:17:44] so if he was looking for that then he
[1:17:46] would look in the in the cupola of gold
[1:17:48] and he would say oh yes everybody in
[1:17:50] there nobody wants to be lost everybody
[1:17:52] in there wants to go to heaven everybody
[1:17:54] in there wants me to bless them oh
[1:17:55] they're wanting new cars they're wanting
[1:17:57] new homes and then preachers keep giving
[1:17:59] them the 13 principles of how to be a
[1:18:01] blessed man and the 14 principles of how
[1:18:03] to do this and the 19 principles on how
[1:18:06] to do that but he ain't just looking in
[1:18:07] the vet for that what he's looking for
[1:18:10] is to see himself himself and what every
[1:18:13] aspect of our life so when he was here
[1:18:16] he not only healed the sick and raised
[1:18:19] the dead but he also faced persecution
[1:18:22] he wants to see that in our lives so we
[1:18:25] are going to be persecuted that's part
[1:18:27] of being a child of God but what he
[1:18:29] wants to see is his image of behavior
[1:18:31] reflecting itself through us and our
[1:18:35] Behavior oh I heard the voice of God say
[1:18:37] an amazing thing this week absolutely
[1:18:40] overwhelmed me I was just alone praying
[1:18:42] talking to the Lord and I heard him say
[1:18:45] these three things walk like a prince
[1:18:48] roar like a lion and fight like a king
[1:18:54] wow walk like a prince roar like a lion
[1:18:57] and fight like a king so guess what
[1:19:00] that's what I'm going to do
[1:19:03] so God wants to see himself when we
[1:19:06] fight he wants to see himself whenever
[1:19:09] we're being under oppression of the
[1:19:11] enemy and persecuted so he's looking for
[1:19:14] himself in every aspect of our life and
[1:19:17] that is what this separates of course
[1:19:19] the bride from the church because the
[1:19:20] church wants simply a ticket to Heaven
[1:19:22] no requirement you don't have to do
[1:19:24] anything you don't have to dress a
[1:19:26] certain way behave a certain way and do
[1:19:27] whatever you want to do oh sure that's
[1:19:29] what they think Heaven's all about it's
[1:19:31] just to get everybody out of this place
[1:19:32] it fits that way in six weeks heaven
[1:19:35] will be turned back into a shape like
[1:19:36] Johnson City in no time won't it it
[1:19:38] won't be a fit place for a child of God
[1:19:40] to live so the refiner wants to be able
[1:19:43] to look over into the cupola of gold and
[1:19:46] to be able to see his own reflection now
[1:19:49] Malachi 3 tells us this but who may have
[1:19:52] died in the day of his coming who shall
[1:19:54] stand when he appears for he is like a
[1:19:57] Refiner's Fire a refiners fire like
[1:20:01] Fuller's Soap he shall sit as a refiner
[1:20:05] and a purifier of silver and he shall
[1:20:08] purify the sons of Levi and purge them
[1:20:11] as gold and silver that they may offer
[1:20:14] unto the Lord an offering in
[1:20:15] righteousness so God works a similar
[1:20:18] process in the life of his people that a
[1:20:22] man would in refining go now you see
[1:20:25] what this goal will do is when the
[1:20:28] temperature begins to rise and it begins
[1:20:30] to release things that's actually become
[1:20:33] a part of it through the process of
[1:20:35] Creation in the earth now the gold
[1:20:38] didn't ask for the dirt the gold didn't
[1:20:40] ask for the Fool's Gold but it was
[1:20:42] actually formed there in the creation of
[1:20:44] the world the earth and the temperature
[1:20:46] begins to rise and it forces the gold to
[1:20:49] release this part that is not itself
[1:20:53] listen to me if you're a child of God
[1:20:55] adultery is not who you are if you're a
[1:20:58] child of God pornography is not who you
[1:21:01] are lying cheating drinking so on and so
[1:21:04] on that is not who you are somebody say
[1:21:07] Amen
[1:21:08] so what does God want God wants to be
[1:21:10] able to release that out of you so the
[1:21:13] real you can shine through so it will it
[1:21:17] will expose our weaknesses it will
[1:21:20] expose our faults oh goodness we none of
[1:21:24] us like that do we
[1:21:26] you're like yeah brother Brown told us
[1:21:28] he said the reason we go to church
[1:21:30] is to see our faults
[1:21:33] oh my goodness
[1:21:35] how many goals to church they can be
[1:21:37] preached on
[1:21:40] why did y'all even come today
[1:21:44] we go through trials so we can see what
[1:21:48] we are lacking what we need oh my
[1:21:52] notices so it exposes our weaknesses our
[1:21:55] faults our struggles our impurities do
[1:21:59] that when the heed is turned up and when
[1:22:01] the heat gets hot it is very
[1:22:03] uncomfortable in it oh my goodness I'll
[1:22:06] see some of y'all saying here and I know
[1:22:08] what phase of life you're in according
[1:22:10] to kind of how you're reacting in the
[1:22:12] service some of you is wrapped up in
[1:22:13] thermal blankets some of you are sitting
[1:22:16] there sweating which lets me know where
[1:22:17] you are in the cycle of life and so each
[1:22:20] one of us were able to go through these
[1:22:22] different things but myself I I can be
[1:22:25] able to tolerate heat better than I can
[1:22:27] cold now I've been to Canada and it's 40
[1:22:30] minus 40. and whenever I get done
[1:22:32] preaching I was soaking wet and they
[1:22:34] would pull the the vehicle right up to
[1:22:37] the door I basically stepped out of the
[1:22:38] church door and the car was right there
[1:22:40] because there's a freedom that's afraid
[1:22:42] I'd freeze to death because of being so
[1:22:44] cold and yet then people stand outside
[1:22:46] with a long sister stand there with a
[1:22:49] long sweater hanging down like this
[1:22:50] minus 40 standing out there talking like
[1:22:53] you folks here would in 70 or 75. yeah
[1:22:56] their blood is like molasses so they're
[1:22:59] used to it they're used to it they can
[1:23:01] stand there and do it I don't like that
[1:23:04] kind of weather God never made that
[1:23:06] place for me polar bears and all that
[1:23:08] sort of thing they can have it as far as
[1:23:09] I'm concerned I can deal with heat a lot
[1:23:12] better but it's the same way when it
[1:23:14] comes to our flesh and our soul whenever
[1:23:17] the pressure goes to be turned on our
[1:23:19] flesh oh we'll cry and belly ache oh I
[1:23:22] didn't think Christianity is going to be
[1:23:24] like this I didn't know it was going to
[1:23:25] be so hard to go through that and the
[1:23:27] flesh will go on and on and on and the
[1:23:31] soul is saying Lord Purify Me Lord
[1:23:34] cleanse me Lord sanctify me and if your
[1:23:38] body could hear your soul you talking
[1:23:40] about getting into an argument they'd go
[1:23:42] back and believe you please shut up your
[1:23:44] ass can God to turn up the temperature
[1:23:46] and I'm about to die this heat is
[1:23:48] absolutely killing me exactly the idea
[1:23:53] exactly the idea that God wants to do so
[1:23:57] the process our process you say when
[1:24:00] will this ever end I'll tell you when it
[1:24:01] ends this process will end when we meet
[1:24:05] Jesus face to face
[1:24:08] now think of this every one of us are
[1:24:10] going to see him you're either going to
[1:24:12] be ready or not ready it's up to you but
[1:24:14] the process for the bride will end when
[1:24:17] we meet him face to face and he will be
[1:24:20] able to look directly in our face for
[1:24:23] the first time without a veil or a
[1:24:26] covering of the blood and when he looks
[1:24:28] in our face we will be so much like him
[1:24:32] he will be able to see himself in US
[1:24:37] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:24:39] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:24:42] shall be like him is that right is that
[1:24:44] what the word says for we shall see him
[1:24:46] as he is I don't want to add to what
[1:24:49] John said but there's also another side
[1:24:51] to that and he will see us as we is
[1:24:54] that's exactly right we're going to see
[1:24:56] him as he is and he's going to see us as
[1:24:59] he has processed us to be through all
[1:25:02] these things of life oh you know in one
[1:25:05] way I'm so glad that God hasn't made it
[1:25:07] to where that it didn't require a real
[1:25:10] difficult type of process I'm glad that
[1:25:12] he's made it this way because it truly
[1:25:14] separates those that really want to go
[1:25:17] from those that really don't want to go
[1:25:20] so you see purification may sound harsh
[1:25:23] and the process may seem very difficult
[1:25:26] he said well brother Donnie how long
[1:25:27] does this take depends on you
[1:25:30] it depends on how much junk
[1:25:33] you got in you
[1:25:35] it depends on how much trash
[1:25:37] how much Fool's Gold
[1:25:40] how much dirt
[1:25:42] how much Humanity
[1:25:45] well thank you Jesus
[1:25:47] it all depends on you and I and how
[1:25:50] quick we will allow God to take it out
[1:25:53] of our lives so without this process we
[1:25:57] will be left with our impurities we will
[1:26:00] be left you see this is why that they
[1:26:02] cannot make out that number that goes
[1:26:04] through the tribulation period now if
[1:26:06] these people are actually under the
[1:26:08] blood how in the world could they ever
[1:26:10] go into a tribulation period for
[1:26:12] purification but they think they're
[1:26:14] under the blood but in reality they are
[1:26:17] not they refuse the process to be
[1:26:20] cleansed ready for the Rapture now we
[1:26:22] know that's being saved and the Rapture
[1:26:24] is not the same thing she'll be gets
[1:26:26] saved by accepting him as our savior but
[1:26:28] in order to go on the body change we've
[1:26:30] got to be called out separated called
[1:26:33] out away from the world and this process
[1:26:35] is part of it and many people simply do
[1:26:38] not want it they don't not want to be
[1:26:40] told they have to separate from the
[1:26:42] world well you can't do this and you
[1:26:44] can't do that no more and you can't I
[1:26:46] ain't no purchase are telling me what to
[1:26:48] do bless God it ain't the preacher
[1:26:50] telling you no way it's the preacher
[1:26:52] only repeating the requirement for the
[1:26:54] Rapture I thought you wanted to go
[1:26:56] so you see the process takes out all of
[1:26:59] these impurities and the dross that's
[1:27:01] inside of us so you know God may allow
[1:27:04] them a a relationship a friend of yours
[1:27:08] or or a brother even in the flesh or a
[1:27:10] sister in the flesh and struggles May
[1:27:13] raise up and what will it do it will try
[1:27:16] you in a way that you've never been
[1:27:18] tried before and then if you've got the
[1:27:21] least bit of bitterness or an
[1:27:24] unforgiving Spirit down inside mixed
[1:27:27] with your gold and now of course every
[1:27:28] one of us are totally convinced that we
[1:27:31] are 14 karat through and through from
[1:27:33] the toenail to the top of our last
[1:27:35] little head right up on our head we are
[1:27:37] all 14 karat gold there's no question
[1:27:39] about that right I'm talking about our
[1:27:42] character our makeup by even our family
[1:27:44] is 14 karat that's why some of you think
[1:27:46] your kids are a bunch of angels around
[1:27:48] here and you don't even correct them
[1:27:50] well praise the Lord Brother Donnie you
[1:27:52] don't pass the new birth on to your kids
[1:27:55] well they don't pass a new birth on our
[1:27:57] kids by having Sunday school class or by
[1:27:59] preaching is that right they've got to
[1:28:01] get it theirself and they've got to be
[1:28:03] purified just like you and I are
[1:28:05] purified but we want to wind up the
[1:28:08] goals of God he's going to gather his
[1:28:10] treasures one day you see he's gone
[1:28:12] there to prepare a great beautiful place
[1:28:15] now those of you especially you sisters
[1:28:17] and you're saying you you think about
[1:28:19] getting engaged or some of you sisters
[1:28:21] that's already engaged and married and
[1:28:23] you get your eyes on a new ring and you
[1:28:25] go say well glory to God my husband's
[1:28:28] making more money now than he's ever
[1:28:29] made before and he got me this little
[1:28:31] ring whenever we got married and I love
[1:28:33] this little thing I really do but I
[1:28:35] wouldn't care to have something a little
[1:28:37] bit bigger say three-quarter or 1.1 or
[1:28:39] 1.3 or something like that and I
[1:28:42] wouldn't mind you know having the
[1:28:43] clarity a little bit better the four C's
[1:28:46] I wouldn't care to have the color just a
[1:28:48] little bit brighter mine is a j and I'd
[1:28:50] rather have something a little bit
[1:28:51] brighter I'd rather have the clarity a
[1:28:53] little bit and I'd rather have not any
[1:28:55] inclusion something but Diamonds the way
[1:28:57] they chart diamonds you understand that
[1:28:59] mine is an s i one and I'd rather not
[1:29:02] have that I'd rather just have you know
[1:29:04] just no inclusions and all to and I I'm
[1:29:07] not you know and whenever you go to the
[1:29:08] jewelry store and you talk to your
[1:29:09] husband said honey let's go into the
[1:29:11] mall and let's get one of them pretzels
[1:29:13] you like them pretzels don't you down
[1:29:14] there tomorrow oh I like them pretzels
[1:29:16] well let's go down there and he's just
[1:29:18] as gullible as he can be poor old Feller
[1:29:21] he don't realize that the jewelry stores
[1:29:24] right across the hallway there from the
[1:29:26] Pretzel store
[1:29:27] hey you ain't got no pretzels on your
[1:29:30] mind sister you got that big rock
[1:29:31] playing inside of that
[1:29:34] have you ever noticed and them jewelry
[1:29:36] case us how they've got them all lit up
[1:29:38] have you ever noticed whenever you walk
[1:29:40] in there I mean ever Sparkle is there I
[1:29:43] see some of y'all smiling you've done
[1:29:45] been there done that ain't you and
[1:29:46] they've got that thing laid up and as
[1:29:48] soon as they take it out and you put it
[1:29:50] on your finger but they also got some
[1:29:52] behind you but I'll tell you what you do
[1:29:54] you walk out of there into the mall
[1:29:56] itself and just get under the regular
[1:29:59] lights and what you're going to notice
[1:30:01] is a lot of that sparkle is no longer
[1:30:03] there now the Sparkle is still there but
[1:30:06] the light is not hitting it in the right
[1:30:08] way so myself whenever I bought a few of
[1:30:11] those things in the past and I go in
[1:30:13] there if I don't happen to have one in
[1:30:14] my pocket which I don't carry one around
[1:30:16] I will ask for a Jeweler's loop I mean
[1:30:19] that's what that is some of y'all know
[1:30:20] what it is I won't ask for a Jeweler's
[1:30:22] loot or whenever you do that always
[1:30:24] impresses them and say oh this old boy
[1:30:26] knows what he's talking about so I get a
[1:30:28] Jeweler's Loop and I put it up on my eye
[1:30:30] like this and I'll start doing the ring
[1:30:31] this way or whatever it is I'm looking
[1:30:33] at but calls us a certain distance that
[1:30:36] you want to get it from the loop to be
[1:30:38] able to bring out everything that's in
[1:30:40] it the fire well you see the the natural
[1:30:43] eye looks at him there's oh it's got
[1:30:44] maybe it's got two or three inclusions
[1:30:47] and the color is a is a g and it looks
[1:30:49] pretty pretty nice but when you go to
[1:30:51] pulling that Loop up and you go to
[1:30:54] looking at that ring this way and you
[1:30:55] find exactly the distance then you say
[1:30:58] oh my goodness there's that inclusion
[1:31:00] how is that well that was formed when
[1:31:02] God made it in the beginning it's carbon
[1:31:04] is all it is and it's a little bitty
[1:31:06] thing that's hidden until you get this
[1:31:09] little Jeweler's Loop now we love
[1:31:11] preaching long distance don't we
[1:31:13] preacher preach on me tell me tell me
[1:31:16] how good I am some of y'all rather I'd
[1:31:18] be plumbed back younger with you you'd
[1:31:20] rather I'd be way back maybe he'd rather
[1:31:22] I was out on the parking lot and preach
[1:31:23] to you but the Lord by the Holy Ghost
[1:31:26] will have a man of God anointed by the
[1:31:28] spirit of God and he's got a Jeweler's
[1:31:30] Loop and another and then another Lord
[1:31:32] have Mercy's got a pair of binocular it
[1:31:34] looks like and say Lord how'd that man
[1:31:36] know what we was talking about this
[1:31:38] morning at The Breakfast Table he didn't
[1:31:40] but the master does
[1:31:42] so what does it do it brings out our
[1:31:45] flaws it brings out our carbon our
[1:31:47] humanity and then God does it not to
[1:31:50] shame us God does that not to humiliate
[1:31:53] us God does that to bring it out so we
[1:31:56] can see what's there and then we can say
[1:31:59] okay I understand Lord while the
[1:32:01] temperature's been going up has the
[1:32:03] temperature been going up on any on your
[1:32:05] trials and your test of Life I'll tell
[1:32:08] you one thing it seems like every way
[1:32:09] you look and everybody you talk to has
[1:32:12] gone through something is that right and
[1:32:15] it seemed like the closer we get to the
[1:32:17] end of the way the more it is it must be
[1:32:20] going home time it must be going home
[1:32:23] time and he's cranking and cranking and
[1:32:26] cranking in order to let all the
[1:32:28] impurities to be able to boil to the top
[1:32:34] oh my goodness well I know we ain't
[1:32:37] going to be standing in line today to
[1:32:39] see who can be able to be cranked up
[1:32:40] first but I do want to be in line I
[1:32:43] don't want God to have to Baby me I
[1:32:46] don't want God to have to treat me like
[1:32:48] I'm a little old pansy sort of a fellow
[1:32:49] well I can't let Donnie go through much
[1:32:51] poor little Feller he's so weak you know
[1:32:53] he'll just get all broke down and
[1:32:55] everything that ain't what I want my
[1:32:57] reputation to be I'm not the first one
[1:32:59] today look and be thrown in the fire
[1:33:01] guarantee you that but if God in his
[1:33:03] wisdom allows me to go there I'm going
[1:33:05] to act like a prince I'm going to roar
[1:33:07] like a lion and I'm going to fight like
[1:33:09] a king
[1:33:10] oh man you see God wants us to be able
[1:33:13] to have peace in the time of such trials
[1:33:16] when they're going on so God is refining
[1:33:19] and removing the dross in our lives so
[1:33:23] we can be vassals for his glory now
[1:33:25] listen what the prophet said I was
[1:33:27] standing here not long ago by a big
[1:33:29] smelter and I noticed how hot that fire
[1:33:31] was and it just cooked and cooked and
[1:33:34] cooked now you can tell this is not
[1:33:36] smells or language what he's talking
[1:33:37] about but this is the best way he knew
[1:33:40] to describe it so we're standing there
[1:33:42] looking at that smelter and and it was
[1:33:45] just boiling apparently some bubbling
[1:33:47] and stuff coming out of it like that it
[1:33:49] cooked and cooked and cooked as a hotter
[1:33:51] it got and the dross and the metals and
[1:33:53] the gold he said to come to the top and
[1:33:56] they skimmed it off and that heat the
[1:33:58] fire a little hotter in this smelter and
[1:34:00] then they would make it boil more now a
[1:34:03] lot of us boil as a matter of fact some
[1:34:05] of us boil over
[1:34:08] but it's the kind that don't do us no
[1:34:10] good
[1:34:11] we get all anger and all upset and bowl
[1:34:13] over and lose our temper and then you
[1:34:15] got to go back and repent for something
[1:34:17] that you said you shouldn't have said
[1:34:18] preach brother Donnie but this ain't the
[1:34:21] kind of boiling that God does when God
[1:34:23] boils you he does a good job
[1:34:26] that's right that heat the fire a little
[1:34:29] hotter in the smelter and then it would
[1:34:31] boil more and that gets some more
[1:34:33] different stuff pyrite stuff out of it
[1:34:35] the first come up was the dirt like dirt
[1:34:38] and mud the necks come up and say oh I
[1:34:40] don't know something some quick notice
[1:34:42] what he calls this some quick silver
[1:34:45] quick
[1:34:47] silver that's what a lot of folks want
[1:34:49] man and they want to get saved tonight
[1:34:50] they want to preach tomorrow they're
[1:34:52] ready to pasture Church in three weeks
[1:34:54] they're ready to go on a singing to her
[1:34:55] Evangelistic touring missionary tour in
[1:34:57] about a month they want Quicksilver that
[1:35:00] only worked for Tom Toad and The Lone
[1:35:02] Ranger
[1:35:03] it won't work for you as a child of God
[1:35:05] God wants rid of quicksilver God wants
[1:35:10] rid of dirt oh my
[1:35:13] they come up and skim that off what it
[1:35:15] went right on down and the last thing
[1:35:17] they took out of it was pyrite that's
[1:35:19] Fool's Gold you know there's a lot of
[1:35:22] things in people that try to fool one
[1:35:25] another
[1:35:26] ah
[1:35:28] now we're coming to Fool's goal there's
[1:35:31] a lot of things in people that try to
[1:35:33] fool one another when you're a Christian
[1:35:35] or acting like it anyhow but you let
[1:35:38] that Holy Ghost go to Boiling everything
[1:35:40] out and it takes all the fool's gold out
[1:35:45] of you you see there's no room for
[1:35:47] foolish virgin gold and the bride
[1:35:50] I don't want no Fool's Gold any y'all
[1:35:53] ever seen pyrite
[1:35:54] so many of you have so your wives you
[1:35:56] know what it is and yet there's been
[1:35:58] many a person that thought they struck
[1:36:00] it rich when they were digging in the
[1:36:03] hills of Arizona or Nevada or Utah or
[1:36:05] California or even in Alaska and they
[1:36:08] thought they had hit the mother lode but
[1:36:11] what they got was absolutely worthless
[1:36:14] notice he said you let the Holy Ghost go
[1:36:16] to Boiling everything out and takes all
[1:36:18] the fools gold out of you fools go many
[1:36:21] people go out west and they find some of
[1:36:23] it and they think they struck a gold
[1:36:26] mine it shines better than gold does but
[1:36:31] it's Fool's goal hasn't got no value to
[1:36:34] it look for him this is where a Leo to
[1:36:36] see is hidden laodicea is full of Fool's
[1:36:41] Gold
[1:36:42] and they look at their lives and they
[1:36:44] look at their churches and they look at
[1:36:45] their jobs and this and that and the
[1:36:47] other God blesses us don't boy that
[1:36:49] means he approves of us no it does no
[1:36:51] such a thing it does no such a thing
[1:36:54] the children of Israel they have been
[1:36:56] judged by God and said you'll not go
[1:36:59] into the land yet they never had to
[1:37:01] provide their food they never had to buy
[1:37:03] another pair of shoes never had to buy
[1:37:05] another change of clothes God blessed
[1:37:07] them so much and there was already
[1:37:08] pronounced they was lost
[1:37:10] don't judge blessings and say well
[1:37:13] that's God's approval here's God's
[1:37:15] approval of you
[1:37:16] God tries you and tests you oh God gives
[1:37:20] me a new car every now and then God does
[1:37:21] this God does that well he gives the
[1:37:23] Sinners their breasts he gives infidels
[1:37:26] they woke up today and say there is no
[1:37:28] God and God gave them the Breath of Life
[1:37:31] God gave them the right mind God gave
[1:37:33] them food to eat though they never thank
[1:37:35] him but the whole earth is living under
[1:37:38] the blessing of God is that right I
[1:37:40] don't want just His blessings I want
[1:37:43] this
[1:37:46] oh my
[1:37:48] notice
[1:37:49] dear Jesus
[1:37:51] it shines better than gold does but it's
[1:37:55] Fool's Gold
[1:37:57] hasn't gotten no value to it
[1:38:00] and now they cook that and they skim it
[1:38:02] all off and they just keep cooking and
[1:38:05] cooking it until it's pure gold boil
[1:38:08] down to nothing but 100 goal and that's
[1:38:12] the way God does in his church he pours
[1:38:16] the holy spirit in it and Cooks down
[1:38:20] here we go Church
[1:38:23] how many is ready for a cookout
[1:38:32] y'all invited to Word of Life Church
[1:38:36] every service we plan on having a cut
[1:38:40] down
[1:38:42] well you're serving brother Donnie elk
[1:38:45] bison
[1:38:46] you
[1:38:49] you're what's on the Fire
[1:38:52] and I'm on the fire with you
[1:38:54] oh my goodness well praise the lord well
[1:38:57] that's a sure way to build up her church
[1:38:58] right we will gain all kinds of people
[1:39:00] yeah you got to be kidding me
[1:39:03] people don't want to be cut down
[1:39:07] notice he says oh Lord till it throws
[1:39:11] all the worldliness and the differences
[1:39:14] and selfishness till it just boils it
[1:39:17] out of every individual that will come
[1:39:19] to him
[1:39:21] look at this on the latest in church but
[1:39:23] there is a gold of God First Peter 1 7
[1:39:25] but there is this goal watch this goal
[1:39:27] now that he's going to parallel it to
[1:39:28] the trial of your faith being more
[1:39:30] precious than of gold that perisheth the
[1:39:33] gold of God is a christ-like
[1:39:36] character so the gold of God is not
[1:39:38] working signs
[1:39:41] the gold of God is Not performing
[1:39:43] Miracles we believe in that our God is
[1:39:45] moving Among Us brother Daryl and I have
[1:39:48] met with the youth here uh the other
[1:39:49] night on Thursday night David was able
[1:39:52] to stream the service while they were
[1:39:54] streaming the service somebody got
[1:39:55] healed somebody else got healed just by
[1:39:58] hearing testimonies of healing I love it
[1:40:01] don't you but that within itself will
[1:40:04] not get us through the gate if we don't
[1:40:05] have this kind of goal but never fear
[1:40:08] the bride will have this God
[1:40:11] the gold of God is a christ-like
[1:40:13] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:40:16] of
[1:40:18] flexion
[1:40:21] you see genuine faith is not just a
[1:40:23] value to you and I
[1:40:25] in this life
[1:40:27] but one day you will trade it
[1:40:31] for a Visage likened to the Son of God
[1:40:34] himself
[1:40:36] notice this Peter says it again and I'll
[1:40:38] repeat in reading it to you that the
[1:40:40] trial of your faith being much more
[1:40:41] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:40:43] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:40:45] found unto praise and honor and Glory so
[1:40:49] the trying of your face
[1:40:51] transfers and changes you and allows you
[1:40:56] to stand before the Lord Jesus when he
[1:40:59] comes at his appearing and you won't run
[1:41:03] you won't be afraid you won't be scared
[1:41:06] unlike his appearing that when you and I
[1:41:10] come back with him at the end of the
[1:41:12] Thousand Years and they will run and
[1:41:15] scream and holler for the rocks and the
[1:41:17] mountains to fall upon them but you and
[1:41:21] I will not run and scream why because
[1:41:24] we've done been cooked and re-cooked and
[1:41:28] re-cooked and boiled oh my until the
[1:41:31] dross of our Humanity our failures our
[1:41:35] our insignificant vanity that we all
[1:41:38] have so much of has been cooked to the
[1:41:41] very top and God allowed the skimmers to
[1:41:44] come and skim it off and when we stand
[1:41:46] there we will be a hundred percent pure
[1:41:50] gold
[1:41:51] deity
[1:41:54] deity
[1:41:57] whom having not seen you love and whom
[1:41:59] though you have not seen him yet believe
[1:42:01] him you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:42:04] full of Glory receiving the end of your
[1:42:07] faith notice this is when Faith Comes
[1:42:11] to its end
[1:42:15] when you receive the end
[1:42:18] of your face
[1:42:20] even the salvation
[1:42:23] of your souls
[1:42:25] notice the prophet he said so he told
[1:42:27] Abraham he's going to try him and give
[1:42:30] him trials and every Christian
[1:42:32] has to be tried Peter said thinking not
[1:42:34] strange beloved one fiery Trials come
[1:42:37] upon you for it's only done to prove
[1:42:40] your face
[1:42:42] that's more precious to you than gold
[1:42:45] now we realize people can say oh I
[1:42:47] believe God why sure I believe every
[1:42:49] word in that Bible
[1:42:51] until they're Tried by it
[1:42:53] how many people around our message have
[1:42:55] said that absolutely I believe I have a
[1:42:58] word of that until you preach something
[1:42:59] they didn't know he said
[1:43:01] or it don't apply to their situation
[1:43:03] then they don't believe it no more it's
[1:43:06] amazing how many preachers I'm finding
[1:43:08] friends it would shock you it would
[1:43:11] shock you
[1:43:12] how many preachers that I'm dealing with
[1:43:14] around the message that you sent them
[1:43:16] quote after quote after quote after
[1:43:18] quote I have to quote I have to quote
[1:43:20] scripture after scripture at the
[1:43:23] scripture I description
[1:43:27] and they won't even acknowledge them
[1:43:30] and say the word is right and I am wrong
[1:43:34] that's where we are
[1:43:38] I'm telling you you better get the good
[1:43:40] stuff
[1:43:42] you better get the good gold
[1:43:44] we don't want pyrite we don't want to
[1:43:47] stand in front of the light and Sparkle
[1:43:49] and turn around and act like but if it's
[1:43:51] not real gold it is worthless
[1:43:55] amen oh but I can sing I can jump I can
[1:43:57] preach that's good that's wonderful I'm
[1:43:59] glad you can but I want something inside
[1:44:02] of you that'll keep you that you'll look
[1:44:04] at this word remember the Holy Ghost
[1:44:06] will never lead you or I contrary to his
[1:44:10] word and if you or I do something wrong
[1:44:13] and a man of God shows us the word then
[1:44:15] the Holy Ghost in you or I will make us
[1:44:18] admit that word is right I did wrong I'm
[1:44:21] sorry I apologize and if what you've got
[1:44:24] don't make you do that you ain't got the
[1:44:27] Holy Ghost
[1:44:30] oh my
[1:44:32] listen to this look when you're sick
[1:44:34] sometime how is it that the righteous
[1:44:37] suffer wish we had a night to preach on
[1:44:39] it that how God does it for his own
[1:44:42] Glory
[1:44:43] and turns right back around and heals
[1:44:46] that I don't know if you caught the
[1:44:48] words in that verse brother Joe Harris
[1:44:50] sent me that song the other day that
[1:44:51] Harry and another Caleb just sung and
[1:44:53] our sanitary because I thought it's a
[1:44:55] beautiful song but I don't know if you
[1:44:57] caught the words just hearing at one
[1:44:58] time but it says if my story is For Your
[1:45:03] Glory
[1:45:04] if my story is For Your Glory and
[1:45:09] somehow it will please you for me to be
[1:45:11] broken then Lord that's what I want to
[1:45:14] be how many believe your story is for
[1:45:16] His glory well your story will contain
[1:45:19] all types of things ups and downs and
[1:45:22] ins and outs and you've got draws in you
[1:45:25] today no doubt your pastor still has
[1:45:28] dross in him no doubt every preacher
[1:45:31] sitting here today every Deacon every
[1:45:34] good sincere saint of God we still have
[1:45:36] dross but the difference between us and
[1:45:39] others is we say God get it out of me
[1:45:42] Lord get it out of me whatever he got to
[1:45:45] do God if I have to go through the fire
[1:45:47] and you got to crank her up get it out
[1:45:49] of me if you've got to keep cranking it
[1:45:52] up after that and you give me a little
[1:45:53] bit of a rest and you throw me back in
[1:45:55] so be it Lord let me be a strong servant
[1:45:58] of God let me be one that can be a
[1:46:01] soldier that will stand before the
[1:46:03] people of God in this last day the
[1:46:06] children of God don't need to see weak
[1:46:08] leaders they don't need to see weaklings
[1:46:10] in the Pulpit ready to quit and ready to
[1:46:12] give up I'll tell you the kind of man
[1:46:14] they need to see holy ghost film men
[1:46:16] that will still preach the word without
[1:46:18] compromise and say brother sister we can
[1:46:21] face it no matter what you're going
[1:46:23] through today I'm here to tell you
[1:46:25] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:46:28] that is in the world darkness is under
[1:46:30] your feet cancer is under your fear
[1:46:33] cigarettes can be put under your feet
[1:46:35] alcohol can be put under your fear you
[1:46:38] are more than conquerors
[1:46:47] foreign
[1:46:50] that's how God does it
[1:46:53] for his own Glory turns it right back
[1:46:56] around and heals that
[1:47:00] and starts a testimony
[1:47:03] so God will allow something to come your
[1:47:05] way and it seems awful it seems so
[1:47:08] terrible
[1:47:10] and God will turn right around and heal
[1:47:12] you and bring the testimony out of that
[1:47:15] that can affect hundreds of people
[1:47:19] to God
[1:47:21] notice God takes his holy spirit takes
[1:47:23] the Christian
[1:47:25] the church
[1:47:26] and beats it
[1:47:29] with the gospel so let me tell you this
[1:47:30] today if you're a visitor you go to a
[1:47:33] church where they're not beating you
[1:47:35] you better change
[1:47:39] my brother don't I go I've been for
[1:47:40] years and years they don't never whoop
[1:47:42] me you're sitting under a false prophet
[1:47:46] no one hurt your feelings but I want to
[1:47:47] tell you the truth
[1:47:49] a preacher that ain't beating you don't
[1:47:51] love you
[1:47:54] the only beings in this building today
[1:47:56] that don't need to be beat are the
[1:47:59] babies that don't don't understand yet
[1:48:01] and the angels of God that are here all
[1:48:04] the rest of us need to Target out of us
[1:48:13] so notice it beats it with the gospel
[1:48:17] back and forth back and forth until it
[1:48:20] reflects Jesus and the Holy Spirit can
[1:48:22] see the works of Jesus going on in the
[1:48:24] church then things begin to go fine but
[1:48:27] there's too much Dross
[1:48:29] in the church today can anybody say Amen
[1:48:31] Lord I've got too much Dross
[1:48:33] too much Jaws in the church today too
[1:48:36] much now we're fine people we're the
[1:48:38] best in the world we're the cream of the
[1:48:40] crop but the church needs to make
[1:48:42] herself ready
[1:48:44] get ready let me knows it we need to
[1:48:47] make ourselves ready again how can
[1:48:49] overcome he that cometh to God must
[1:48:51] first be tested that only shows a true
[1:48:54] child then say he's tested when the test
[1:48:57] comes on you listen you can't overcome
[1:49:01] unless there's a test give to you wow

[1:50:14] ever lived on the earth we lived in the
[1:50:16] day can you imagine if some of our
[1:50:18] forefathers would have heard about
[1:50:20] television and Internet and pornography
[1:50:23] and all that stuff on a smartphone where
[1:50:25] all of that sin would be accessible just
[1:50:28] at the push of a button can you imagine
[1:50:30] some of our forefathers said Lord don't
[1:50:32] let me live in that age I wouldn't want
[1:50:34] to live in that age but God's got some
[1:50:36] young people God's got some young men
[1:50:38] some young women come on somebody preach
[1:50:41] with me God's got some people on the
[1:50:43] face of the Earth today are living in
[1:50:45] the middle of Hell itself there's
[1:50:47] Darkness all around us friends there's
[1:50:50] chaos everywhere we are not living in a
[1:50:53] paradise we are living in the middle of
[1:50:56] hell but by the grace of God we will
[1:50:59] overcome every devil
[1:51:01] the people of God will overcome every
[1:51:04] evil you young people can overcome you
[1:51:08] middle-aged people you can overcome us
[1:51:10] older people we can overcome not only
[1:51:13] can we shall
[1:51:18] how
[1:51:19] cook
[1:51:21] cook
[1:51:23] and more cook
[1:51:25] but brother Donnie I've been cooked my
[1:51:27] whole life I understand
[1:51:30] I was 12 when I got saved
[1:51:32] and I'm 67.
[1:51:35] you figure the mass
[1:51:37] I've been cooked my whole Christian Life
[1:51:40] especially since I come to the message
[1:51:43] and I'm enjoying it more than I've ever
[1:51:45] enjoyed it before
[1:51:47] praise God you know what it gets sweeter
[1:51:50] I'm getting closer the days are getting
[1:51:53] closer everyone will be look after
[1:51:54] there's no hope
[1:51:56] for this world the No Redemption for
[1:51:58] this world only the coming of the Lord
[1:52:00] Jesus where would we be was it not for
[1:52:02] him was our only hope
[1:52:04] what can they offer you what can they
[1:52:06] produce to you that will help you lay
[1:52:08] down at night and have peace nothing
[1:52:14] listen this and of course
[1:52:18] when the test is given
[1:52:20] it's given to see whether
[1:52:23] you
[1:52:25] can overcome or not
[1:52:27] Jesus said to him that overcometh
[1:52:30] the test
[1:52:33] everybody look this way please
[1:52:38] I want you to see one of the greatest
[1:52:40] things next to Salvation
[1:52:42] that is given to any of us
[1:52:46] the test is the greatest thing
[1:52:50] that has that ever happened
[1:52:54] to you
[1:53:00] can anybody say Amen yet or do you need
[1:53:02] to grow into that a little bit
[1:53:05] it don't seem like it does it
[1:53:08] it don't seem like it
[1:53:11] you say so because we don't understand
[1:53:12] how to make good gold
[1:53:14] we don't understand the process
[1:53:17] but God understands the process of
[1:53:19] making
[1:53:20] 100 percent called
[1:53:23] so he says I'm going to give Larry one
[1:53:26] of the best things I could get that boy
[1:53:28] can play at piano he can tickle them
[1:53:30] ivories I'm telling you what you don't
[1:53:32] have to even look at him he he cannot
[1:53:34] even hear a song before and go down
[1:53:36] there and play that thing I give him a
[1:53:38] great talent when I bless him be able to
[1:53:39] do that
[1:53:41] but I'm going to give him the greatest
[1:53:43] thing I could give him
[1:53:45] for than salvation
[1:53:50] I'm going to test him I'm going to let
[1:53:51] him have issues with his heart
[1:53:53] I'm gonna let the doctors even tell him
[1:53:56] I didn't hear him you're you're pretty
[1:53:58] close to dying
[1:54:00] you realize you could die
[1:54:03] when he had his episode here not long
[1:54:05] ago and they said you you could have
[1:54:07] died
[1:54:08] no he couldn't
[1:54:09] God wasn't done with him yet
[1:54:15] praise the Lord
[1:54:19] so what did God do that God gave him the
[1:54:22] test and God let him come on the other
[1:54:24] side of the test and then God turned the
[1:54:26] test into a testimony
[1:54:30] but he wouldn't had that testimony today
[1:54:32] could you see him sit there and raise
[1:54:33] his hand and give praise to God he would
[1:54:36] not have that testimony if the test had
[1:54:38] not come first don't lose strength
[1:54:40] Church don't lose your faith in the
[1:54:42] middle of the test know that God's given
[1:54:44] it to you so he can have honor and Glory
[1:54:47] out of your life your story is written
[1:54:50] for his glory your story has been lived
[1:54:53] out in this day for the glory of God
[1:54:56] it's not for us our story is not about
[1:54:59] us how people can read about our life
[1:55:01] and think boy they done this or that or
[1:55:03] the other no it ain't about that our
[1:55:05] story is written for his glory oh my let
[1:55:09] my story and your story be written for
[1:55:12] the glory and mercy of God
[1:55:16] the sand
[1:55:20] let me finish this quote Peter said that
[1:55:22] our trials are worth more to us than
[1:55:25] precious gold it's a testing time it's
[1:55:28] one good evidence
[1:55:31] to us that God is with us
[1:55:34] listen now
[1:55:37] when we're tested
[1:55:41] you see people that aren't being tried
[1:55:43] and tested
[1:55:44] there's something wrong
[1:55:47] our church never has no trouble well
[1:55:49] we're so happy God bless you
[1:55:52] enjoy it while you can
[1:55:54] because if you're a Church of the Living
[1:55:56] God it won't stay that way I don't care
[1:55:59] who your pastor is Jesus was the pastor
[1:56:01] of the 12 disciples he had the office
[1:56:04] church ever was
[1:56:05] they had troubles that arguing they had
[1:56:07] fuss and they had fight it's just goes
[1:56:09] with having churches
[1:56:11] and God is going to allow your church to
[1:56:13] be tested if it's a true church now if
[1:56:16] it's not if it's a shock church if it's
[1:56:18] just that type of church he don't even
[1:56:20] worry about it but if it's a True Church
[1:56:22] of the Living God
[1:56:23] he's going to let it be tested
[1:56:26] it's one good evidence to see that God
[1:56:28] is with us when we're tested for all
[1:56:30] children of God
[1:56:34] or tested
[1:56:36] and tried
[1:56:39] let me read the scripture to you and
[1:56:40] Peter beloved beloved think it not
[1:56:42] strange concerning
[1:56:47] what
[1:56:48] fiery
[1:56:49] not ashy
[1:56:52] not ashy
[1:56:54] fiery
[1:56:55] look at the meaning of the word
[1:56:57] a burning
[1:56:59] the burning by which meddles
[1:57:02] what a strange meaning of the word
[1:57:05] are roasted
[1:57:08] roasted and reduced by a figure drawn
[1:57:12] from a Refiner's Fire calamities or
[1:57:15] trials
[1:57:17] that test
[1:57:21] praise God
[1:57:25] praise God
[1:57:27] I want to be true
[1:57:30] you only true
[1:57:33] call me true
[1:57:36] do we want to be true
[1:57:40] because we know he and his wisdom will
[1:57:42] never allow more to come upon us
[1:57:44] the one he gives us strength to bear it
[1:57:49] maybe you find yourself there today and
[1:57:50] I know some of you do because I'm your
[1:57:52] pastor so I know some of the things that
[1:57:53] you're going through
[1:57:55] got a text Carol did yesterday from one
[1:57:57] of the families in our church and
[1:57:58] they're dealing with this certain issue
[1:58:01] and
[1:58:01] another issue with her son another issue
[1:58:05] with health and another issue with this
[1:58:08] and that
[1:58:10] so sent him a quote that's one of my
[1:58:12] favorites when I'm going through things
[1:58:13] it's from invisible Union
[1:58:15] the prophet said with the law of
[1:58:16] contrast
[1:58:17] he talks about how that we go through
[1:58:19] times in our life and it's seemed like
[1:58:21] it's a daytime
[1:58:22] then he said it'll switch on you and
[1:58:24] it'll be a night time
[1:58:26] and he said like we say it down south
[1:58:28] when it rains it pours
[1:58:33] how many said them days like that
[1:58:35] and you just say Lord I I can't take
[1:58:38] another day I don't know what to do Lord
[1:58:40] what in the world what is going on
[1:58:43] but remember Noah
[1:58:46] when it seemed like it couldn't go a day
[1:58:48] further
[1:58:51] put a rainbow in the cloud
[1:58:53] I don't mind telling you it makes me mad
[1:58:57] I'm so mad right now I could buy the
[1:58:59] Snicker bar right in the half
[1:59:01] that's how mad it makes me that the
[1:59:04] devil and his crowd
[1:59:07] stole our rainbow side
[1:59:18] huh
[1:59:23] and it we're that we're ashamed even
[1:59:25] refer to the rainbow we're afraid to
[1:59:27] even have one anywhere because we'll
[1:59:29] think people will think we're like them
[1:59:34] and the devil hijacked it
[1:59:37] he done the same thing to shouting
[1:59:40] he'd done the same thing about dancing
[1:59:43] the devil never started dancing
[1:59:48] the devil never started dancing
[1:59:50] God told Joe where was you when the
[1:59:53] morning stars sing together and the sons
[1:59:55] of God shouted for Joy the prophet said
[1:59:57] this up for a dancing in heaven before
[1:59:59] the foundation of the world dancing
[2:00:00] didn't start with the devil it started
[2:00:03] with God
[2:00:04] well come on somebody
[2:00:06] worshiping and loving and adoring that
[2:00:09] didn't start for the devil that's the
[2:00:10] way they do it concerts
[2:00:12] you probably read it the other day on
[2:00:15] your smartphone or your newspaper or
[2:00:17] whatever
[2:00:18] a Taylor Swift concert
[2:00:21] was being held out west
[2:00:23] they got so loud
[2:00:25] the people now the people got so loud
[2:00:29] and clapping their hands and screaming
[2:00:31] and hollering at her concert they caused
[2:00:35] an earthquake
[2:00:38] it showed up on the seismograph an
[2:00:41] earthquake
[2:00:43] well the devil ain't the originator of
[2:00:46] that Paul and Silas were
[2:00:52] Glory
[2:00:57] we ought not to get in our mind well
[2:00:59] these people I hear dance we came I'll
[2:01:01] tell you one thing well I danced out
[2:01:03] there in the world we'll get saved
[2:01:04] filled with the Holy Ghost change
[2:01:06] Partners keep right on Dancing
[2:01:08] keep right on dancing but you dance to
[2:01:10] different music now brother sister if
[2:01:12] anybody ought to have the joy of the
[2:01:14] Lord it ought to be the people of God
[2:01:16] it's just about going home time our
[2:01:20] troubles are almost over our burdens are
[2:01:23] almost passive oh Hallelujah let us be
[2:01:26] glad and rejoice for the marriage of the
[2:01:30] Lamb has come and his wife has made
[2:01:34] herself ready
[2:01:40] the sparrow heads
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:47] Heavenly Father
[2:01:50] you're the only one today who can look
[2:01:52] down on every individual heart
[2:01:55] see how much draws
[2:01:58] how much dirt
[2:02:00] how much pyrite
[2:02:03] is still mixed in with the gold
[2:02:07] may they not leave here today with the
[2:02:09] wrong picture in their mind
[2:02:11] it's not like you're trying our flesh
[2:02:13] and trying to get all the flesh out of
[2:02:14] our flesh there ain't no hope for our
[2:02:17] flesh it ain't redeemed it ain't saved
[2:02:20] it ain't never had the Holy Ghost not
[2:02:21] one day
[2:02:22] there's only one hope for our flesh and
[2:02:25] that is to be changed in a moment in a
[2:02:27] twinkling of an eye or if we go by the
[2:02:30] way of the Grave we will raise up with a
[2:02:33] brand new flesh body
[2:02:35] what you're trying to separate from is
[2:02:38] the gold which is our character
[2:02:42] it's the way we treat people
[2:02:44] the way we treat your word
[2:02:47] the way we deal with one another
[2:02:50] that's our character
[2:02:52] it's our character
[2:02:55] I remember when I first come here years
[2:02:56] ago and I've been here for a couple
[2:02:58] years and the Lord
[2:02:59] you remember you placed it on my heart
[2:03:01] to preach character
[2:03:05] I don't think I'll ever forget it as
[2:03:07] long as I live
[2:03:08] brother Bill Hudson
[2:03:10] I thought I'd preach that and I was
[2:03:12] sitting with him and brother Calvin
[2:03:14] Brother JD some of the brothers
[2:03:16] he said brother Donnie
[2:03:18] I don't think I've ever heard that like
[2:03:20] that before
[2:03:22] that character as he called it
[2:03:25] that character of God
[2:03:29] every time after that if I get to be
[2:03:31] around him very long he'd bring that up
[2:03:33] again
[2:03:35] Lord we know it's an important thing
[2:03:38] so what you want to do is heat up
[2:03:41] in order to get flaws out of our
[2:03:44] character
[2:03:47] so if people treat us bad then
[2:03:50] how do we treat them
[2:03:53] if they're not nice to us how do we
[2:03:56] treat them back
[2:03:58] when the word is put to us and we show
[2:04:00] that we have been behaving wrong or
[2:04:03] believing wrong
[2:04:04] will we correct and say God forgive me
[2:04:07] I'm sorry I didn't know the word said
[2:04:08] that
[2:04:09] that's our character
[2:04:11] or will we just say well I feel that
[2:04:13] anyway
[2:04:15] which we know is the direction a lot of
[2:04:17] people go in this day
[2:04:19] you can show them what the prophet said
[2:04:21] show them what the scripture said well I
[2:04:23] feel led to go this way
[2:04:27] oh the dross
[2:04:29] in such a character
[2:04:31] Lord would you search each of us today
[2:04:33] and we're not trying to take a pitch for
[2:04:35] today Lord and say boy I wish so and so
[2:04:37] had been there today they sure needed to
[2:04:39] hear that I always so and so was there
[2:04:42] but Lord God we want to open our hearts
[2:04:44] and say Lord I was here
[2:04:46] I heard what was preached father I
[2:04:49] preached it and I'm opening my heart
[2:04:52] I want you to look at me Jesus
[2:04:55] I want you to look at me and see if
[2:04:57] there's anything in me that displeases
[2:04:59] you
[2:05:00] I don't care what it is
[2:05:02] I've been serving you most of my life
[2:05:04] preaching most of my life
[2:05:06] I don't want to miss it Lord
[2:05:08] I don't want to labor in vain
[2:05:11] till God look at me today search me
[2:05:15] help me father
[2:05:17] if there's any draws
[2:05:20] any power right
[2:05:22] any dirt not in my Humanity but in my
[2:05:25] character
[2:05:27] oh Jesus cleanse me
[2:05:30] cleanse me
[2:05:33] anybody here with me today you want God
[2:05:35] to do the same thing for you
[2:05:39] just raise your hand and open your heart
[2:05:41] to him now
[2:05:42] Lord help me
[2:05:45] maybe it's the way you treat your wife
[2:05:47] maybe it's the way it treats your
[2:05:48] husband
[2:05:49] maybe it's the way you treat your
[2:05:51] neighbor
[2:05:52] live behind beside you around you in
[2:05:54] your subdivision and a little loud or
[2:05:57] whatever mourn boy you just have a real
[2:05:59] attitude toward them
[2:06:01] each of us know we know what our
[2:06:03] weaknesses are our faults
[2:06:05] don't jump out of the pot friends don't
[2:06:07] jump out of the kettle when God cranks
[2:06:09] it up
[2:06:10] but just say God give me more grace
[2:06:13] share the other words to this verse of
[2:06:16] this song
[2:06:17] God instead of giving healing you gave
[2:06:20] her it Grace
[2:06:21] so the author of the song was referring
[2:06:24] to Saint Paul of course when Paul asks
[2:06:27] for healing
[2:06:28] but God didn't give him healing but he
[2:06:30] said my grace is sufficient
[2:06:33] so sometimes you ask God for healing and
[2:06:36] God gives healing
[2:06:37] other times you ask God for healing
[2:06:40] and God gives Grace
[2:06:42] at least for a month or two or six
[2:06:44] months Maybe
[2:06:45] and then the healing will come after a
[2:06:47] while
[2:06:48] but aren't you glad that he knows
[2:06:50] exactly what we need
[2:06:52] and if he's got a prolonged reason for
[2:06:55] where you are don't lose your face
[2:06:58] he's testing you
[2:07:01] he's done testified no doubt to the
[2:07:03] devil about you
[2:07:05] you and God's been fellowshipping
[2:07:08] God's got confidence in you
[2:07:11] praise the Lord
[2:07:13] help me Lord that all not
[2:07:16] falter or fail
[2:07:19] Lord Jesus help me father
[2:07:23] Lord God In The Name of Jesus would you
[2:07:26] move across this building today
[2:07:28] help each of us Lord
[2:07:31] May the gold of God be so
[2:07:36] purified in our lives
[2:07:39] whatever's lacking in me Lord whatever's
[2:07:42] lacking in these people
[2:07:44] some of the Home Folks some visitors
[2:07:47] Lord would you deal with us
[2:07:50] help us oh Lord
[2:07:52] when the temperature increases increases
[2:07:55] and
[2:07:56] it becomes hot and we become weary
[2:07:59] help us not to lose faith
[2:08:03] oh Grant it Lord God I pray in the name
[2:08:05] of Jesus
[2:08:08] May our character please your father
[2:08:12] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:16] we worship you today Lord God
[2:08:20] would you just lift your hands with me
[2:08:22] and just open your heart to him just let
[2:08:24] him search him
[2:08:27] praise the Lord
[2:08:29] praise the Lord
[2:08:32] we bless your name Lord God we worship
[2:08:35] you Jesus
[2:08:37] we don't want to be drunk on the things
[2:08:39] of the world father
[2:08:41] sometimes you might let a little
[2:08:42] financial crisis strike us
[2:08:45] so it will force materialism
[2:08:48] to the top of the pot
[2:08:51] so we can see I didn't realize how much
[2:08:54] I loved this world and it's things
[2:08:59] until I got that crunch
[2:09:01] maybe you'll let something really hit us
[2:09:04] maybe a cancer maybe a terrible sickness
[2:09:07] a disease that the doctor sets incurable
[2:09:11] and once it strikes us
[2:09:13] fear begins to come to the top of the
[2:09:15] pot
[2:09:16] we didn't even realize that fear was
[2:09:19] there until the doctor gave us that
[2:09:21] report
[2:09:22] and then all of a sudden we got afraid
[2:09:25] you allowed that test to come so it
[2:09:28] would force the Fear To The Top
[2:09:31] so you could Deliver Us from the fear
[2:09:36] oh we love you Lord
[2:09:39] I mean once after that look at me would
[2:09:41] you for today brother look at me
[2:09:43] you want that with all your heart
[2:09:46] let me tell you what faith for an
[2:09:49] individual can do
[2:09:50] also if you know as far as Erica's
[2:09:52] situation the doctors say they've got
[2:09:54] maybe one more thing they can try on her
[2:09:57] as far as they think she's in the last
[2:09:59] stages
[2:10:00] no hope
[2:10:02] this that the other
[2:10:05] but she told her mama this the other day
[2:10:07] she said Mama
[2:10:09] she said I I worry about myself
[2:10:12] sometimes she said why honey she said
[2:10:14] I worry because
[2:10:16] I'm not afraid
[2:10:19] and I wonder should I worry more because
[2:10:21] I ain't worried
[2:10:25] glory to God
[2:10:28] that's faith brother
[2:10:30] that's Faith sister
[2:10:32] so it does so something like with you
[2:10:35] brother
[2:10:36] there's something so to you and so
[2:10:39] changes you and makes you different why
[2:10:41] aren't we terrified
[2:10:43] do you understand that Russia has moved
[2:10:46] nuclear bombs to Belarus
[2:10:50] do you understand that Russia sent out
[2:10:52] four of their super bombers
[2:10:56] su-35s on Friday night
[2:10:59] the size equivalent to our B-52s
[2:11:03] which only carry nuclear warheads
[2:11:07] do you realize we sent one of our
[2:11:09] nuclear class submarines
[2:11:15] to South Korea
[2:11:18] look at Iran look at Israel Hezbollah
[2:11:21] fixing to attack from the north
[2:11:25] I like looking at Israel I got the
[2:11:26] Jerusalem Post app and I look at it
[2:11:28] every day about because what I see of
[2:11:31] Israel is they're like us
[2:11:33] so Israel has Egypt to the bottom they
[2:11:36] got Jordan over here they got Iraq over
[2:11:39] here they got Lebanon up here they got
[2:11:42] the Mediterranean over there they're
[2:11:44] totally surrounded
[2:11:47] totally completely surrounded and their
[2:11:50] estate about the size of New Jersey
[2:11:54] but do you believe that Israel will be
[2:11:56] destroyed
[2:11:57] you don't and why don't you believe that
[2:12:01] because God's word said it won't
[2:12:03] but if you've got that much faith for
[2:12:05] Israel you ought to have that much and
[2:12:07] more for yourself
[2:12:09] if God will not allow Israel to be
[2:12:12] destroyed what about his bride
[2:12:15] no matter what Satan does he cannot take
[2:12:18] you
[2:12:20] under God's purpose is finished
[2:12:26] Hallelujah
