blame you even though you didn't make the mountain move you must have known that in time I'd get so much closer to you as I climb because you gave me strength when I was weak because you never lost your faith in me I love you more than I did before cuz when I needed you you were there D to pull me through I love you still though I don't understand your will because you've been so faithful to me Lord I love you [Music] more without some rain nothing would grow without some pain how would we ever know that our tears break your heart and that's when you hurt the most I'm finding every time you hold me close I love you more than I did before cuz when I needed you you were there to pull me through I love you still though I don't understand your will because you've been so faithful to Lord I love you more than I did before cuz when I needed you you were there to P me through I love you still though I don't understand your will because you've been so faithful to me Lord oh because you've been so faithful to me Lord I love you [Music] more and many's been through those times the analogy that brother BR used is quite amazing about the Shepherd that sometimes he when you get a little a little bit of rebellious or stubborn or something that he has to take up that sheep and break that leg so he can give you a little bit more affection and tender care I woke up early this morning before daylight and that quote I didn't thought about it in quite a while but he was talking about the Holocaust and all the Jews and he's said talking about people misunderstanding it and so on and he uses these terms to describe it the tender hand of Jehovah the tender hand of Jehovah it sure wouldn't look tender would it because we look at everything from this side in time try to understand it all that way but when if he out there in eternity and you look back this way everything would look so much different our loved ones that pass and go on to the other realm and we try to figure what are they thinking what are they doing um do they feel sadness do they feel what do they feel and it's perfectly normal for us of course looking at it from that perspective because that's all we know but can you imagine if he was a hog and one day he was changed from a hog to a human being all you never done was eat slop your whole life rooted with your nose and just stunk like a hog eat like a hog acted like a hog and then one day you stepped out of that pig pin and all of a sudden you were a human being and you thought thoughts that you'd never knew a being could even think you could talk you could laugh you could express such emotions but a hog just don't express if you can multiply that now by millions of times you can imagine one of our brothers and sisters and when they leave this realm and it's actually a birth to them really they born into that body and they have eyes ears they have things similar to us but it's like being born into a brand new world can't you see why you'll never be satisfied here cuz you know it's there I'm so thankful to God that he allowed our church AE messenger the first one and the seventh one to be able to get a glimpse and actually a visitation into a Heavenly realm go there and come back and tell us what it was like praise the Lord and to think in that Dimension it's not 20 ft from where we are about the heights of this ceiling here something like that and if you've been born again you've got a body waiting there for you I can't talk about it too much cuz I don't want to live in this one no longer why would we is it a privilege to be together tonight to be able to serve the Lord Jesus let us read tonight if you would in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself listen to program of God whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass herb yielding seed after his kind the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good how many he has a request before the Lord tonight sister Janny lemman also wanted a a prayer call for a need that she has so let's just take these to the Lord heavenly father I want to thank you first of all that we didn't get snowed out where we could have church some maybe on their roads wasn't able to make it or uh just out of precaution they didn't want to be here tonight and we just thank you Lord that we were able to have it so hopefully even though they couldn't be here physically they can be able to stream we'll go back and archive the service but for those of us that are here we're here to have church we've sung we've prayed now we're praying over the word we're expecting to hear from Heaven tonight dear God if that will happen there will have to be a phenomenal miracle that will take place you will have to take a human being and be able to anoint the gift that you placed in that human being and somehow capture it and hopefully be able to say what's on your heart tonight things that you have given us for our day that would help us to be a better people help us Lord to be able to have the seed in ourself for truly this is your plan and your program father I pray for our sister Janet lhan you see Lord facing this surgery and we're praying that You' just be with our sister may it go well we're praying also for the other sick and The Afflicted Lord and our church family we're praying also Father for brother Randy Willis and uh their family at the passing of sister Tron uh we just pray that you'd Comfort their hearts the funeral service tomorrow night um help me Lord I pray and help this family bring Comfort to them in the days and weeks and months that are to come we commit the service to you tonight father in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated now with the help of the Lord tonight will change a little bit in the direction that we've been going on the law of sewing and reaping dealing mainly with us and we'll change it tonight by the help of the Lord into the original s and the Original Seed Creator which we know of course is not us and it's not the devil and it's not Angels but it's God now I realize that for the age that we're living that many people have taken it upon thems to attack the message and attack the messenger and they feel like of course they're called to do all of that and they would like to portray to us that brother brandom was a man that was a deceiver and a liar and he was a man that was trying to lead people to hell and I guess as I hear some of these things and read some of them in the in the the past few years that has surfaced that I realize that those people that want to make that charge and that accusation apparently even those that was around the message for a long time and then turned away as a dog does to its vomit and a hog dust or watering in the M that apparently they never listened to very many tapes when they were supposedly in the message and they never caught something that the bride C is whenever they listen to those texts because if they did they would realize I've been around deceivers before I've been around Hypocrites before most of you all have I've been around people before that were Liars that were deceivers they were intentionally trying to deceive people it's not that they were deceived and then deceiving but they were actually knowingly trying to deceive people and there's certain things that you watch and that you learn about deceivers and that's what lets me know that most of these people that are making the charges against God's Prophet they don't have a clue about what deceivers really are because dece deceivers put on a front of course they never let you see the real them they never let you know their true motives and their true objectives so they put on a front because they are under satanic inspiration so Satan can cause his ministers to appear as Ministers of righteousness Jesus says in the gospels that they will come in the last days and they will actually be wolves but they will wear sheep's clothing but if you're around an individual like that long enough eventually you'll hear the wolf growl and the wolf always has a different smell than a sheep and eventually the wolf smell will project out of the sheep clothing but whenever I listen to the tapes of of brother brandham and I read this message what I see is not a man that is trying to deceive people and first of all himself be lost and wind up standing before God and answering for deceiving hundreds of thousands of people what I see and what I hear is a man that loved God so much and loved the people of God so much and a man that would confess his wrongs give to us his shortcomings tell us regrets in his life tell us that the Holy Spirit called him a liar tell tell us that he listened to his mother-in-law instead of listening to God which was the worst mistake he'd ever made in his life he said and that that day he would stand before God and answer for many many Souls now that's not like the language of the deceivers and the tricksters that I have personally known praise the Lord so whenever I listen to this I myself I don't have to have a guard up that I've got to be so careful because brother randam is trying to deceive me and he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes tricksters don't pull the wool over your eyes they pull the wool over their wolf hide so that you will think that they are a sheep you know whenever I hear him make statements I I'm fixing to read to you tonight I believe it's from the heart of a sincere man that loved God as I said and loved his people and knew what his responsibility was in this age so he didn't look at his position as one lightly that he could lead people astray lie to people make up lies you know all these sort of things that he's being accused of in this this day and I find it so amazing that all of these people that are doing that they can do it very easily since he's gone but I wonder how many of them would have done it to his face that would be a different story wouldn't so now I laid that foundation so you'd be able to um understand this quote that I'm going to read to you see now why I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I have planted for the body see now why I have been so zealous for the kind of seed that I have planted for the body so now what what do you hear when you hear a man making these statements what I hear is a man that knows he has a great awesome responsibility and that he's been called to a spot unlike hardly anyone else that's ever lived especially no one in this age now I realize every God call man is responsible for the seed that he's going to seow but there is no way me any other brother in this message will answer for what brother brandham will have to answer for now listen as I read it to you again see now why I have been so zealous of the kind of seed that I have planted for the body now notice his motive his objected his sensitivity to the call so he realizes that he is responsible for millions of people he's going to answer to almighty God from millions of people now the setting is of course March something like that I think March uh let me look here uh yes March the 18th 1962 so this is approximately two years after he's went beyond the curtain of time and come back he heard all those voices of those people telling him that they were resting on his teaching yeah and he said if Paul's group goes in mine will because what Paul taught I taught the same thing and those millions of voices screamed out we are resting on that I believe I was identified there then and I can say the same thing tonight I am resting it's not my call to stand brother ROM's teachings a scripture hit me today right as I was setting studying before I come to church and I I I wasn't even looking in that direction but I I could hear it it may seem strange to you but I could hear it and it was reverberating I was sitting there my laptop in my lap and I could hear it reverberating like like the Reverb was turned up really really loud and it was I could hear it in the distance and it said as Jen's and jambre with stood Moses so were these men in the last days and I saw oh my goodness so janies and jambre with stood Moses now it's amazing that Paul wrote that and would call their names since the Bible doesn't say what their names were now for those that want to check God's prophit of this day by the scripture if you don't do Paul the same way you're a hypocrite on Genesis Exodus numbers Leviticus Deuteronomy Kings Samuels Chronicles none of the Old Testament books mention their names where did did Paul get that as janies and jamre and the meaning of his name is foaming healing foaming healing and the other one was a soothsayer but they with stod Moses and I I thought oh my goodness and it just becomes so real to me I I actually pull my laptop another window open I have about 3 6 9 12 I have about 12 Windows something like that going at one time now you know why I'm so weird that I can be able to multitask my processor is a multitasker so I pull that scripture up and and in Timothy to look at it and click on the meanings of the words and that word har withstood with stod which was to rebel against and question his authority and I thought oh my here we are that it's not just Pentecostal preachers the denominational preachers but we actually have message preachers that are withstanding the authority of God's Prophet questioning what he preached on this what he preached on that withstanding his authority now listen as he he knows that he's going to answer to God so what is brother renom doing you see now why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed not just to seow anything but the kind of seed that I have planted for the body now this is a man that knows his responsibility so he's sewing this seed and has been for years Caroline I were talking last night and I told her I said you know it's really phenomenal when you think about what God did because God took a man that was uneducated as far as the world would would say and a man that whenever you look at some of his notes and we have some of them back there in a case in the library and you'll read his handwriting and his spelling and his use of nouns and pronouns and adverbs and adjectives and so on and you you read it there and and you say Lord I mean it it breaks my heart I've seen these notes for years and years brother George sister Rebecca made me copies of some of them years ago just to let me have them and and read them and I I look at them and I read them and it breaks my heart because he couldn't spell he didn't know good [Music] grammar and God said that's my choice aren't you glad the Common People heard him gladly now when you think that God as I was telling her last night would choose such a man but I told us to think about it that God from the time the message started being recorded in 1947 into 1965 a span of 18 years being recorded on magnetic tape then books started being printed and so on and things that was uttered and preached was part of the mystery of God which had not been uttered since the foundation of the world and not from some Harvard Professor not from some Theologian who graduated from Bob Jones University you imagine some of the preachers that sat behind him whenever they'd hear him use his grammar and his Linguistics and all of his ability and this and that and the other and they would probably laugh and snigger but I wonder how they snickered when the angel of God come down and told them their secrets of their hearts oh I hope that we never get so smart in all our intellect now you realize where we are in the message we have been around so long we actually are producing message theologians we've got several of them several message theologians and theology is not always bad but whenever they become so theological that they want to start correcting the very man that the message come through this old boy has a problem I hope you do now think God gave that respon responsibility to one man and this our age at the ending of the Omega stage of the Bride will be one of the greater challenges that preachers will have because they will have studied and studied and accumulated the message and accumulated the quotes and accumulated Greek and Hebrew and the linear dictionary and on and on and on and on and on we can go and if they're not careful they will become so confident in their own studies even some I know writing their own commentaries on different books writing their own commentaries of this and that and the other why because they feel like they have an opinion they feel like they have something that should be given to the bride you think the preacher is just writing it for his wife oh my notice but whenever a man realizes his position and can operate in that category and this is where the Prophet was that I planted for the body the rains going to fall pretty soon now listen to these words I mean the real rain now during this time frame is when the lighter rain is still ongoing and remember part of this came from up in Canada I've been there to where and actually preached in a church there to where the latter rain in the early days started so they started laying hands on preachers and sending them out and said you're in a Apostle you're a missionary you're this that the other and they tried to Rally around brother brandham now listen this that move was not just on the theological side but it was actually a supernatural move with tongues interpretation prophecy it was not on the side of theology but it appeared to be a great Supernatural move but it didn't go very long until they started having men that were heads and this and that and the other and they even tried to get brother brandom to be a part of it and they were going to Rally around him now look what Satan was doing Satan had done known the prophet of God would never go that way and make an organization himself so he tried to put men around him that would make an organization and I don't mind telling you that's still ongoing to this very day that's right now the light of rain the prophet mentions about it several times and he said out of this message will not come a denomination they said you Brethren from Canada you remember he refers to it for many many years and he said they tried to form a denomination there years ago and he said it just basically fell apart but they still tried now watch what he's so zealous over I mean the real rain because the lot of rain is still being talked about now in 1962 I mean the rear ring and it's got to have seed to fall on I hope I live to see it do you understand now it will be the Living Word as it was in the beginning the spoken word of God have his power for it is him in his own body working his own way amen all right now if that quote will ever come to pass there would have to be seed sown for the light of rain to fall upon it so remember God doesn't just tell us so kindness so generosity so forgiveness so this out of the other God himself abides by his own law this is why you never find almighty God ever sewing denominational or hybridized seed God will only sow Original Seed which is spoken word because it will multiply and reproduce itself so God could not in this last day be able to produce an Omega bride by taking leot of Pentecost and rewing that seed again under the ministry of Malachi 4 and said well I I'll just I'll just change it a bit I I'll just polish it up a little bit and I'll let the pro take that same seed and reso it and then it'll produce a bride no 1906 was hybridized Luther was hybridized Wesley was hybridized so God had to have a sewer on the earth that would be a Prelude to the Rapture there could be no rapture on the seeds that had been sown up through this pyramid by time it left the First Foundation they were trinitarians they believed in women preachers they believed in eternal hell you might on nod your head most of us believed a lot that same stuff so God could not let the light of rain or rapturing face fall on a heart that was baptized entitles in this and called it the Omega bride cuz the alpha bride was baptized in the name but after that then what did they do they lost the name and then they were baptized and titles so God could not take the title baptism and sews that and then the rapturing face fall on that and then the bride coming up and saying well where where's the other two where's the other two well well there ain't two more oh really oh oh I I I I I thought there was three there was three different ones the Omega bride don't believe in three she believes in one so you can see why then when the SE would come he would seem so controversial so he would start from the seed of The Serpent and go all the way way to the messenger now that's a quote so he would go from the seed of The Serpent and go all the way to the messenger he would deal with the blood The Mercy Seat justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he would deal with all of that because it must be rewn an original true format because because the godhead had become so hybridized which started way back in the first age you know some of those men there I've read some of their writings some of them that got off of the original past and they begin to question what Peter James John Paul and those Brothers begin to teach well by the time it comes in Isaiah and 3:25 ad they have done God that aryanism and then they've got the other school of Sal and they meet and go to hashing and out a bunch of theologians didn't bit more have the Holy Ghost than this desk has got it and they were led by the intellect of their mind and they started hybridizing the word of God and then they done away with water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus they quit casting out Devils they quit Healing The Sick they quit ministering the power of God notice he says oh my as God is sending him on the earth it will be The Living Word as it was at the beginning the spoken word of God have his power for it is him in his own body working his own way now I mentioned it to you Sunday but let me go back through it again tonight that Christ was actually the seed that Eve should have given birth to Christ he was that son that should have come through Adam by the spoken word and Eve would have given birth to him now watch's this again the spoken words orinal City if you aren't listen to it again brother Donnie I've heard that three times yeah me too in the last two days so let me just tell you uh I I I've listened to it day before yesterday and finished it up started again yesterday and finished it up started it again today and I told care I said you know it's so amazing to me because I just heard it I've heard it twice this week and I'm on the third time and I said I've heard the exact same tapes the exact same words and I'm constantly copying and cutting and pasting and sending myself the email of the quotes and I'm thinking Donnie where were you where were you when this was being played that's the kind of message that we have friend it's constantly unfolding where we are you I've listened to it till three time well by the time you get 250 times you might understand a little bit about what's been said now listen this Jesus is the word made manifest he and his word is one the same now what was he look he was that seed now watch I'm going to I'm going to bring some some paragraphs together here so whenever you see these dots in front of that that means I took part of this out to put these paragraphs together he was that se that Eve should have produced so she had the opportunity to give birth to Christ the word but instead she chose to give birth to Cain the bastard Cain the mongrel Cain the hybrid can you imagine looking at those two sons and thinking that you would choose King over Christ we look at it well because every one of us are face with that same choice you see you yourself are a woman in Ty and you will e either give birth to Kain or to Christ what will be your son's name well praise the Lord if I got a choice I choose Jesus anybody in here with me I choose Jesus forget Cain I don't want no Cain no no no I didn't see what that produces so he was the seed's son the son of Life the son of Li now watch he was the seed that Eve should have produced do you get it Eve should have produced did you get it he was the seed that Eve was to produce but she hbrd it by disbelieving God's word so he was the seed do you understand Christ if Luther would have stayed with that he could have produced that Methodist could have produced it Pentecost could have produced it the early fathers of this message when many of them oh my that's why we've had so many different bride revivals and and moves and the Thunder move and the perusia move and this move and that move don't you see the same thing is going on that happened in the Garden of Eden if some of these men that were around brother brandham if they would have stayed true to the word but what did they do this and had to go off this way and build him a kingdom that had to go that way and build him one this and had to go another way and build him another they're doing exactly the same thing that Eve done in the Garden of Eden and look at their children look at the seven Thunder children I preached to some of them look at their Revival what do they have left a bunch of emotion screaming hollering shouting and many of them live lives like Devils absolutely unbelievable some of the stuff that I know about that move that's absolute filth a Baptist would not live the way some of these people around these moves live why because they are born dead they come from the womb of that move a dead child can't you see why we don't want to be raganit we don't want to be pites or Spencer ites or Ward ites or Brites we want to be holy ghost fill Sons and Daughters of God oh my Hallelujah [Applause] notice so here was oh it's it's hard for our minds to comprehend or at least mine why would anyone choose Cain over Christ so he was that that seed and the only way that life could be in the reproduction of life life had to come through that seed now remember whose seed is in itself self so God gives Adam the first seed son upon the Earth the ability not just was in his natural Anatomy but by giving him the book of redemption Adam did not contain our soul our theophany was in his body but it would have been that we would have been spoke into existence by that word hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and yet instead of Adam and Eve going that way then Eve of course opted for the can route now notice life had to come through that seed and that seed had to die talking about Christ in order to spread out the life so where was that Christ Seed where was it in the Garden of Eden but brother Donnie where was it in the book and the Holy Spirit to germatize that seed word was there in the garden he's here tonight in our garden he's here to germatize the seed word inside of us if we'll let him but now remember we cannot make it live on our own our intellect our knowledge our theology will never do it there's only one way for the word to live and the spirit of God must Quicken that word and give it life notice again the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was to water the seed man wasn't made to die he's made to live but hybriding brought life or he said death rather she hybrid now you now you deny the serpent seed then I'll ask you what's these funeral services about why are we having another funeral tomorrow night why are the saints of God fighting s sickness disease and some will go by the way of the Grave because even though you have the Holy Ghost in your soul your flesh is harbored oh I know you love it and some of you almost worship it and make an idol out of it it's the greatest enemy you'll ever have don't never think cuz you look in the mirror and boy you're every every woman's dream of what a woman should look like and some of you Brothers think you're you're just every a woman's greatest desire of a man look beyond that old outside thing and realize that what's looking back at you is a sorry low down rasal and ain't nothing but a hybrid and the greatest enemy you'll ever have in your life and Word of Life said amen now watch he said every one of us are hybrid from the original that's the reason we're constantly dying I love it when he says it y'all to hear him on tell but oh God God screams out something like that oh God there's a germ of life come from the real seed that God proved it was his seed he rose him up again you see it proved Oh Glory to God hallelujah that all the Old Testament prophets that lived and died but yet their bodies went to the dust of the Earth why because their body was not the seed but the Lord God raised up his son because he was the seed he proved he was the seed by resurrecting him he'll prove his sons and daughters are the seed by raising them from the dead for those of us that are alive and remaining we still living and a death bound body but he will prove who we are too by raising us from the dead on Rapture morning oh thank you Lord Jesus that through that life that's going over the Original Seed like was given to Eve over his real church it's bringing forth life again through the birst through the womb of his bride so listen to me Eve the first one was in the Garden of Eden and the serpent met her quoting the message of that day he didn't quote her Luther's gospel he didn't quoted the law of Moses but he was quoting the message pertaining to that day in the Garden of Eden so listen Eve that same old devil is still around come on somebody it ain't going to be some Church of Christ or some Nazarene that's going to try to lead away many of the message people but it has been preachers that have in part quoted the word of this day but they're very selective they pick out the parts they like well I don't think I don't think we need this I don't think what are they doing withstanding Moses again oh my well praise the Lord now notice how is it going to come it cannot be produced through the womb of denominations why listen to me they're defiled oh my that's the reason God manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word The Germ word itself the seed word The Germ word itself The Germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed you get it he was The Germ word of God the germ is the spirit The Germ is the water and Jesus had to be broken open there in order for the seed to let force in life to water other seed which is you and I that was coming now remember the prophet in laying this out I'm still spoke a words Original Seed he's trying to convey to the people of the Brandon Tabernacle there and also to the world he said I want my brothers to know why I've preached what I preached why I've stood Where I Stood and maybe they will understand it a a little bit better now this is where he's coming from that he's sowing a seed and has SED a seed so the rain would fall on it and not produce a church not produce another isusa stre not produce another priest going up and putting the 95 thesis on the Catholic Church door but Sons and Daughters of God filled with the Holy Ghost now listen to me great words had been uttered prior to these years but when the spirit of God told him to pick up his pen and write and he said I thought God what am I going to tell him oh Lord what am I going to tell him help me to know what and he said when the spirit of God told me to pick up the pen and after I wrote it and laid the pen down and I read it he said right there it was there was the answer now the spirit of God wrote this and pick up your pen and write Malachi 4 is a gerti word of God but Malachi 4 at this time has not yet been fulfilled he said now this is March of 62 yet he had been ref referring to Malachi for for years but it was like a manifestation prophetically he was talking about it but it was awaiting a manifestation but oh it's so awesome when you go to the seals and he goes to talking about Malachi 4 and the anointing of the Elijah and all that coming back on the earth and he said I can't say too much about it cuz it's just happened so Malachi 4 behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet oh I realize there's all types of theologians that want to explain that away from us they've done come way too late to try to take Malachi 4 away from me come on somebody amen Jesus talked about a prophet coming on the last day Malachi talked about one coming in the last day I've studied it I've looked at it for years and years I ain't found no other Ministry on the face of the earth that could ever halfway Third Way 10% way ever even match up to be able to fulfill those Prophecies of God's word come on somebody say amen and when you look not only at the signs the Wonders the supernatural but you look at the seed that he was so burdened to bring it was not to produce a following it was not to produce an organization it was not to produce and he knew he said when I'm gone these tapes will be played for Years After I'm Gone 1965 he said I see my end out there 56 so he knew he was not going to live on so what was so important to him have word that the bride coming down through the time even after he left would be able to feed on that word and the preachers would be able to preach that word waiting for the lighter rain hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus now watch it's the germ that come from the sea he is the word of God made perfectly manifest he is correctly the son from the first Adam was the son that was promised through Adam to continue on the human race so Jesus was to be Adam's son I figured this had wake some of you all up even though you're deep sleepers can you imagine he was to be Adam's son Amen brother Donnie how in the world because God wanted son friendship I love the analogy that the prophet uses in future home he said he loved fatherhood so in order to become a father he had to become a [Laughter] son in order to become a father notice the title of that sermon the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride God wanted to become a human being and if Adam would have stayed in his place he would have allowed himself to be brought through the God of this Earth Lord children can't you see why that Christ seed must come through his body in the day and hour that we're living in yeah it must come through his body glory be to God hallelujah he is correctly let me read that again some looks on some of y'all's face I might not I might need to rad it and reread it the son from the first Adam was the son that was promised through Adam continue on the human race and Eve hbed to the serpent and brought forth a generation of bastard children born to death without life and Jesus come and was that seed he proved it everything Adam lost Jesus was see it he is the correct Eve would have finally brought that child forth this is why a real child of God Can Face man's greatest fear yes a son or daughter of God Can Face man's greatest fear and life at it and say to death you are not my master but I am yours come and get me and take take me across the river hallelujah hallelujah come and get me and take me across the river Glory why because they passed already from Death unto life my thank God Eve would have finally brought that child forth oh message people message people you will finally bring forth the Christ if you wait right you'll give birth to the child of your dreams if you're only wait you imagine as a woman in the garden of egyp and Eve would look and see the male the female donkey the male the female horse the male the female and no doubt the reproduction was already happening there amongst them and her looking out and seeing cuz God spoke it that everyone bring forth of its own kind so it was happening all around her except it wasn't happening to her and being a woman you see your little girls and never those little bitty tiny things playing around with baby dolls nurturing that little old thing and you know playing with that doll and talking to it and naming it and changing his diaper and feeding it and this and that and the other what is it it's that nature in that little girl of yours and there Eve was waiting waiting waiting when when oh my but she got in a hurry and Satan played upon her anxiety to bring to pass God's word she was not anxious to sin she was not anxious to defile herself she was not anxious to Forfeit her rights and hours she was anxious to fulfill her purpose what was it the prophet said God gave her to her husband to reproduce himself so she would look at him and she knew within herself was this desire to be a mother she didn't quite understand it but it was all about timing listen to me second Eve your faithfulness your Purity to the anointed word or your straying from the anointed word will be based upon one simple thing timing timing will you wait for God to fulfill his promised word or will you allow men around the message to hybridize and make a conglomeration of a little bit of Baptist and a little bit of Pentecost a little bit of this and a little bit of the message and mix it all together and what have you got a big pot full of mess I'll tell you what you got or will we wait it's one of the hardest things for human beings to do ain't it we got instant mashed potatoes we got push button microwaves we got push button cell phone we got Siri everywhere we got Alexa everywhere I mean my we want something from Amazon within order it within three hours you'll be get it tomorrow and that's the way we want the rapturing faith that's why we want our walk with God we want all seven virtues and we want to by least Sunday morning please if you don't mind Lord put me at the head of the list and God knows that and Satan knows it Sarah wanted to be a mother so bad and by her desire she bypassed God's program God never said Abraham oh my [Music] Hagar but she got ahead of the program of God oh my Eve would have finally brought forth that child notice this now on page 32 now what happened here's the word God that spoke the word to multiply and replenish the Earth it couldn't find a place to land finally this word caught into the womb of a virgin so Satan tricked Eve with the timing and what felt like her great desire that was motivating her friends look at what a demon that we are dealing with that will play on our very desire to have a move of God to have a Revival we saw it didn't we brother Larry oh we saw it so much in Pentecost people hungered and CRA if you've got in your mind a lot them Pentecostal people was a bunch of idiots and a bunch of ignoramuses and they didn't want no move of God that shows you never was around some of the ones that we was around cuz some of them people wanted to move a God I'm talking about they would say 7 Days 10 days 14 days I've done it myself it's a week he can't even hardly walk go put up tents and and and preach and fast and pray till you're so weak you think you're about to die why because I looking for Devils because I was looking to be something I wanted God I wanted God to come on the scene that's why I was doing it that's why I did it that's why I spent years and oh my running on the road and preach 30 something nights in a row one time down in Louisiana close out down there go Indiana the next night be up there and then record an album after that meting was over 30 some days in a row why was I doing that because I was hungry for God but what did I settle for bunch of jumping running screaming holling walking the backs of pews come on don't tell me that wasn't Supernatural don't tell me I didn't see things that weren't Supernatural didn't we hey some of you that was in p because you saw some real genuine things and it wasn't that they was looking for demons they was not saying oh Satan come Satan come and bewitch us all know they was praying and calling on the name of the Lord but Satan slipped in a mongrel a hybridized something now watch this and the spoken word Again original see that's why what's the matter with the Pentecostals today they're manufacturing something they can't wait oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery amen tears to manufacture something what does it bring Force like it did the first time the first bride they couldn't wait she brought death through a bastard born child which we all are children of so when you look in the morning sis and think I pretty you are in the mirror and you young men strike that pose of yours and flex your bustles call yourself what you are don't cuss but here's a quote you know [Laughter] if we really believe this we treat this a whole lot different come on we baby it we Pat it some of you men PRM in front of a mirror for 45 minutes what in the world you apparently see something about yourself that I sure don't see about me my nose is crooked cuz I broke it when I was in PE and jumped on a trampoline and broke my nose my ears is big and floppy and my hair is ugly I don't know why in the world Carol even married me you want me start on you now brother Timothy Hallelujah Y'all Scared death think you want me to dismiss right now now watch oh thank you Lord but God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original Sons and Daughters of God see there you are the life sperm of Eve never happened it never did why she mingled it and kept it away you see what happens friends when we h abiz and it don't take that much all we have to do is add just a little bit of Le to see into this message we just got to add a little bit of modernism just a little bit to make it go over a little bit better let's just leave out some of these quotes like I've read here tonight with all this plain flat talk and brother Donnie but oh my goodness you know that that that that could really be offensive I know it can be offensive it's intended to be sometimes you got to get us a little bit angry at the Devil angry at herself angry at the world that we're in to realize there's only one way out of here that's a new birst amen oh my instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it God promised to multiply but they had to wait until God's time that's what's a matter today they don't want to wait God's time so the sperm of Eve never happened hybrid to Satan's lie his lovely bride became polluted and so has Christ's bre the bride what made her become polluted Adam's bride now because she never stayed with God's word listen this quote is absolutely astounding to me the reason that Adam's bride never did Bear right the life child the life child is because she disbelieved God's word is that right say amen amen congregation replies amen congregation replies amen congregation replies amen congregation replies the reason and Jehovah's wife was put away or his bride was because she rejected God's word the prophet it's a serious thing friends it's a serious thing when we go to rejecting the teaching of God's Vindicated servant amen that's one of his laws remember you can only serve God on Earth as those who are ordained and Vindicated and sent by God come down on the earth and interpret God's word to you she rejected God's word the prophet is that right the reason that Christ bride oh my goodness you mean there's people that are actually called bride don't you'all remember me praying that preaching that to you years and years ago the rejected bride oh it's been my goodness I don't even know how many years ago it's been I preached it over North Carolina at a meeting over there I thought some of them preachers was going to die of Suffocation I mean they whenever I took the message and took the scripture and showed them that there is a category of people called the rejected bride just because you're called bride don't mean you'll ever be called wife in Revelation his bride his wife has made herself ready I don't want to just be bride I want to be wife come on children yes there's been all kinds of Ages that bride could be attached to them by association but before he could ever get to knew them Eve was Adam's bride but he never knew her as his wife until after she was with child mom Christ's bride is put away in divorcement because she has rejected the word of God like Eve did like the rest of them did exactly all all all polluted their husband couldn't get to them it was already pregnated before their husband got to them oh God I don't think I've ever heard a tape of all the ones that I've listened to to where he coins this term and uses it so many times in one sermon this is a six-hour sermon he preaches it on Sunday morning divides their break for lunch and come back Sunday evening and preaches it again but where just there's just something here about it's hit him in a way to realize where he's at to realize where the church is at to realize where the bride is the responsibility that he's got it must have been a tremendous thing to be able to deliver but also knowing there'd be people around the world that would turn him down like never before after he preach this and that sounds like a deceiver to you if he's want deceive more people compromise leave this out don't say that don't say them things that'll get you hated don't say them things that people will turn away from you oh God if that ain't a pitiful sight think of a young man coming to a woman and find her with seed of some other man in her what a saying that's what God done that's what Adam done that's what Christ has done do you understand that same thing has happened in our own ranks some of the people that were called out by the message of Malachi 4 and Paul said I have jealousy over you as a Godly jealousy but I fear less as the serpent who beguiled Eve you know would corrupt you from the Simplicity which is in Christ why in the world would he fear why would he fear he said I have begotten you because them people he was writing to was a begotten bride but they were not wife right that's the most dangerous time after the begettal will she stay faithful during the time of the betral generally lasted about a year so Paul had betroll them to Christ but he said I fear but he said I desire to presentent you so the betral is a separate Deed from the presentation all the people in this age that hate God's prophet boy are they going to be awful awful sad and weeping and crying on that day when they walk up before the Judgment seat and standing there by the judge will be the message preacher and message people and God's Prophet sending there to judge them so all their YouTube posts all their videos all their books that they've written all this and that and the other will be flashed right across the screen and there they'll be with their lies and their false charges and accusations come on somebody and it'll be there to meet them oh oh my think of it Paul said I fear I'm afraid for you all why because you could be in a spouse bride and become pregnant that's what every one of these man-made moves whether it come from New York or from Trinidad or from Ohio or all the different places that it's come from South Africa here and there and there wherever it's come from including Jeffersonville and every one of these things watch it after it's to pull a bride a people that have been espoused by this message and brother REM tells him in question answer 64 oh don't let me down children don't let me down don't let me down said brother renom what can I do he said live a Chase virgin life what's he speaking to an espouse bride oh just stand together oh my let me not close out leaving you on that part but let's read this quote and we'll pray and let you go I don't want to hold you too late tonight now watch the true bride Hallelujah there's going to be one why she's predestinated she won't be denominated because she's predestinated that sounds like the good words to a song to me she won't be denominated cuz she'll be predestinated she don't have to worry about some denomination she's already predestinated to take the place like Mary I want you to get this now and don't fail are you ready say Amen congregation replies amen when Christ come to his bride she'll be like a virgin like Mary was for God will not bring Christ through a womb of a neither will he bring the bride God bless you Saints you love him with all your heart you want to be this amen I do to God bless you let's pray together and we'll we'll let you go heavenly father I pray that you'd Help the People Lord help me I realize I'm a seed Seer every preacher here tonight's a seed Seer every one of us are in our lives every day but preachers are twofold and humanly in their own life and then also in the Pulpit help us father to sew the right seed for the right Harvest dear God In The Name of Jesus go with us we don't want to just be bride oh that's what our terminology is bride bride bride bride but we want to become wife wife for you will never seow your seed in the womb of a prostitute keep us free from the seed of man including message Preacher Man help us father I pray go with your children now Lord watch over them in the cold tonight I pray in Jesus name God bless
