[7:55] i was just discussing with

[8:01] one of the hardest times that this
[8:02] church has faced in many years
[8:06] a lot of people sick we've had we've
[8:09] suffered terrible losses and
[8:12] lord we've we see the saints in
[8:14] afghanistan i was talking with brother
[8:16] harvey about about that and it just
[8:18] struck home you know that
[8:20] they have no protection now
[8:23] from the government and they could rush
[8:25] in at any minute and just take their
[8:26] lives and
[8:28] that's just like satan lord he's just
[8:29] such a coward
[8:31] he's just such a coward
[8:33] your people who are meek and gentle and
[8:34] sweet and loving
[8:36] and kind and forgiving
[8:39] lord and they they walk around as
[8:41] vessels of your spirit lord
[8:44] and the devil is just
[8:47] so afraid of of us
[8:50] he's so afraid
[8:52] and he tries to hit us when we're down
[8:54] lord and
[8:57] he doesn't realize that you never leave
[8:59] us and you never forsake us when we're
[9:00] going through the hardest times of our
[9:02] life you did not leave us
[9:04] you did not forsake us but you you came
[9:06] and you not only comfort us but you live
[9:08] in us you
[9:09] you never you never leave us alone we
[9:12] always have you lord i don't understand
[9:15] how the other people in this world are
[9:17] even making it lord how they can even
[9:18] stand it
[9:20] we have you you're so precious to us and
[9:23] you help us through all of these things
[9:25] lord and you bring us comfort
[9:27] we have times of sorrow we have times of
[9:29] mourning lord but we also have victory
[9:32] and we have a love in us that
[9:34] that just
[9:36] it just quelches all all the fires lord
[9:39] that the devil tries to start and it
[9:41] brings us peace
[9:43] in the midst of all these troubles we
[9:45] have peace

[24:47] to all familiar markers
[24:50] of the mercies i have known

[24:59] but it's more than a cliche
[25:03] there's no better way
[25:05] to tell you
[25:07] than to
[25:09] say
[25:13] my god's been good
[25:18] in my life
[25:22] i feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams
[25:27] when i go to sleep each night
[25:30] and though i've had my share of hard
[25:33] times

[27:19] that i can say
[27:21] is this
[27:25] my god's been good

[34:11] the presence of the lord
[34:13] to be able to come and
[34:14] just be able to minister to us
[34:19] amen
[34:21] we're so thankful that the lord is
[34:23] moving for his people and doing doing
[34:25] wonderful things and
[34:27] i really believe that
[34:30] what we're going through now is simply
[34:32] going to prepare our hearts
[34:34] for a great big thing he's fixing to do
[34:37] right down the road
[34:40] and our walks and in our lives
[34:43] you know god has a way of doing things
[34:45] to
[34:46] thin down and shake us and
[34:49] help our faith
[34:50] because he's got something greater he
[34:52] wants us to do
[34:54] now for my past me and you we want to
[34:57] continue to search for greater things
[34:59] than god never reach well i guess i've
[35:01] reached it i'm totally satisfied with
[35:04] what i am i think there's more
[35:05] revelation
[35:06] a closer walk with god a greater
[35:09] understanding for absolutely every
[35:10] person in this building tonight don't
[35:12] you
[35:13] so that's what i'm looking forward to
[35:15] see what the lord's going to do we're
[35:17] going to pray and i'm not sure
[35:19] what what all brother joel has mentioned
[35:21] but we want to continue to remember
[35:22] brother jim babb of course on the
[35:24] hospital once seen yesterday i was able
[35:26] to pray with him had a little bit of
[35:28] movement yesterday actually
[35:30] in his eyes and uh things none today
[35:34] but until the lord says different we're
[35:36] going to just conti continue to pray for
[35:38] him claim a miracle and believe the lord
[35:40] is going to move is that right
[35:41] you say but it's so far gone could be
[35:43] called lazarus to the pulpit tonight and
[35:45] ask him how far gone can you be before
[35:47] it's too late
[35:49] my name is lazarus he said
[35:52] also brother tim airwood had to be
[35:55] readmitted back to the hospital and
[35:57] they're treating him i was able to
[35:59] go see him as well and
[36:01] talk with him sister connie a little bit
[36:02] yesterday and have prayer for him and
[36:05] brother george is handing me this
[36:06] request please remember the wiggins
[36:09] family sister sherry's mom passed away
[36:11] in her sleep earlier this week so we
[36:14] want to remember them how many of you
[36:16] have a need and request on your heart
[36:18] tonight
[36:20] i believe the lord is mindful of every
[36:21] one of them yours might seem so small
[36:24] that you think my goodness with
[36:26] everything that's going on
[36:27] but i really hate to even ask the lord
[36:30] let me not remind you of a lady possum
[36:34] who resided
[36:36] in indiana
[36:38] and she had a real need one day
[36:40] she didn't have a bible to know that
[36:42] malachi 4 was even on the earth
[36:45] but somehow another the spirit of god
[36:48] led her to elijah's house
[36:51] now i'm not sure if there are any
[36:52] blessed possums but that one was a
[36:55] blessed possum
[36:57] can you imagine how many human beings
[36:59] went by his house laughed at him
[37:00] ridiculed he made fun of him called him
[37:02] a false prophet and everything in the
[37:04] world and god sent a dumb
[37:06] animal and that dumb animal was able to
[37:10] receive so you know what people can call
[37:12] us dummies
[37:13] if they want to
[37:15] as long as i'm getting what i need from
[37:17] god i really don't care
[37:19] you could have told that possum that he
[37:21] was a false prophet you could have told
[37:23] that possum that's a cult don't you go
[37:25] to that house this you think should have
[37:27] paid any attention to you
[37:29] she got what she needed and she walked
[37:31] out of the yard and turned back as if to
[37:33] say thank you and went on her merry way
[37:37] so if god can deal that with a dumb
[37:39] possum he can deal with him with a dummy
[37:41] like me
[37:42] any more damage here tonight can say the
[37:44] same sometimes it's not our how dumb we
[37:47] are that's our disgrace it's because we
[37:49] think we know so much
[37:51] so let's take our needs our requests
[37:52] before the lord right now
[37:55] father we love you so much we are so
[37:57] grateful lord that we could have this
[37:59] time to be together again tonight father
[38:02] a little unusual for us on thursday
[38:04] night but i just hated not to be able to
[38:06] have church in the midweek we need it so
[38:09] bad
[38:10] lord i i want to
[38:12] mention father these requests and
[38:14] brother joel i'm sure has already
[38:16] mentioned several but brother jim babb
[38:18] and you see lord the condition of our
[38:20] brother
[38:21] but father we're just asking you for
[38:24] your mercy until you take him or you
[38:27] tell me otherwise to quit praying this
[38:30] way i'm going to keep on praying and
[38:32] keep on asking and keep on believing
[38:35] father that you're going to move for our
[38:37] brother lord you know as i stood by his
[38:39] bedside yesterday and i walked in there
[38:42] no one there with me just by myself and
[38:44] i watched him lord for a minute or so to
[38:47] see if there was any movement there was
[38:48] nothing at all
[38:50] then i laid my hand on his shoulder and
[38:53] i started talking to him and i started
[38:55] telling him how much we loved him how
[38:56] much we appreciated him that we was
[38:59] praying for him sister linda for scotty
[39:01] lord and his eyes began to move a bit
[39:04] and i saw some expressions in his face
[39:06] and i knew he was hearing me
[39:08] so lord god
[39:10] i pray today father in the name of jesus
[39:13] may you move for our brother tonight
[39:14] lord
[39:16] dear god if it's your will to take him
[39:17] we would by no means
[39:19] want to hold him here in that body that
[39:21] he's held in but father god until you're
[39:24] done with him we're not going to let him
[39:27] go not only him but none of the rest of
[39:30] ours
[39:31] father we pray also for brother tim
[39:32] erwood you see lord his need and father
[39:35] is feeling some better today and we're
[39:37] grateful for that we're just believing
[39:39] you that you're going to continue to
[39:40] strengthen his body and help him lord we
[39:42] pray for the wiggins family you see
[39:44] sister sherry's mom lord to just sit
[39:47] back in a chair to take a nap
[39:49] oh my
[39:50] she awoke in a brand new land
[39:54] lord i pray that you just be with the
[39:55] family and help them comfort their
[39:57] hearts lord god we pray during this time
[40:00] in the name of the lord jesus and the
[40:02] saints said amen amen god bless you
[40:06] let's turn to that to uh
[40:08] first corinthians chapter 14.
[40:14] now i woke up this morning really really
[40:16] dizzy
[40:17] my eyes was dancing in my head
[40:20] and actually they were dancing so much
[40:22] that my eyes crossed and i had to put my
[40:25] hands over my eyes
[40:27] until that would pass
[40:29] so i might hang on to this tonight while
[40:32] i'm preaching
[40:33] but i'm not going to let it hinder me
[40:36] so don't you
[40:37] let it hinder you
[40:39] because i know
[40:40] what the lord had put on my heart
[40:43] and i saw you stinking
[40:45] rotten
[40:46] lowed down
[40:48] sorry scumbag of a devil i know why you
[40:52] don't want me to go to church because
[40:53] you don't want me to preach what the
[40:55] lord's given me
[40:57] but i'm here he's here and you all are
[41:00] here
[41:01] so i say
[41:03] we have church
[41:04] praise the lord
[41:10] first corinthians 14 6.
[41:13] now brethren
[41:16] if i come unto you speaking with
[41:18] tongues what shall i profit you
[41:22] except i shall speak to you either by
[41:25] revelation or by knowledge
[41:29] or by prophesying
[41:31] or by doctrine
[41:34] and even things without life giving
[41:37] sound
[41:38] whether pipe
[41:39] or harp
[41:42] except they give a distinction
[41:45] in the sounds
[41:46] how shall it be known what is piped
[41:50] or harped
[41:51] so
[41:52] if a person would take a pipe or a heart
[41:55] or an organ or a guitar or a piano and
[41:58] they just kept hitting one note over and
[42:01] over
[42:02] and over and over again i'll tell you
[42:04] what it's going to do to you the same
[42:06] thing it does to me drive me nuts
[42:11] i love c but not by itself you
[42:14] see there's a difference between a note
[42:18] and a chord
[42:19] and a chord is an accumulation of
[42:21] several notes together
[42:23] so paul is here using this and saying
[42:26] unless there would be a distinction in
[42:29] the note from one key to another from
[42:32] one note to another an octave then
[42:35] there's no way to tell amazing grace how
[42:37] sweet the sound has saved a rich like me
[42:40] i once was lost but now i'm found but
[42:42] now blind i could see but let's add the
[42:45] distinction
[42:47] amazing grace
[42:50] how
[42:51] sweet
[42:53] the
[42:55] sound
[42:56] what is that distinction so the octave
[42:59] changed
[43:00] now paul said unless it gives a
[43:02] distinction in the sounds how shall it
[43:04] be known what is piped or harped
[43:08] for if the trumpet
[43:10] give
[43:11] an uncertain sound so a sound that has
[43:16] not been
[43:17] talked
[43:18] a sound given distinctions and you are
[43:21] aware of the distinction
[43:24] who shall prepare himself to battle
[43:29] from those scriptures i want to speak to
[43:30] you tonight for just a bit
[43:32] on a time
[43:34] of uncertainty
[43:36] may the lord bless his word you may be
[43:38] seated
[43:44] let me start it out with this quote
[43:47] there is uncertainty on every hand
[43:52] everywhere you look in national affairs
[43:55] it's uncertainty
[43:57] the big four meetings now you look at
[43:59] this and you see that this was 1955 so
[44:02] there were four great powers at the time
[44:05] that the prophet was saying this and
[44:07] they would have their meetings and they
[44:10] would discuss this and discuss that in
[44:13] world peace and so on and so on so it
[44:15] was called
[44:16] the big four and he said they come
[44:19] together and they write out declarations
[44:22] but there's an uncertainty
[44:25] whether the other side will keep their
[44:29] pledge or not and that amazing here we
[44:32] are in 2021
[44:34] and people are exactly the same as they
[44:36] were in 1955.
[44:38] it's uncertainty in everything you look
[44:43] at but one thing
[44:45] that's in christ
[44:47] that's one thing that you can be assured
[44:51] that's certain now let's let's look if
[44:54] we can tonight
[44:56] at a few things in our time that are so
[45:00] uncertain we have just seen a
[45:03] catastrophic event that has happened
[45:06] under the direction of our leadership of
[45:09] our government and that is in the land
[45:12] of afghanistan we've seen and dealt with
[45:15] 20 years of war
[45:17] a trillion dollars that have been spent
[45:20] countless of lives that have been lost
[45:23] people's bodies have been maimed people
[45:27] have lost uh limbs and sight and
[45:31] not even counting the psychological
[45:33] battles that many of those uh armed
[45:36] personnel would deal with for the rest
[45:38] of their life
[45:40] and tonight there is definitely an
[45:43] uncertainty in thee in the land of
[45:46] afghanistan because of the way our
[45:49] government handled this uh we are
[45:53] tonight the laughing stock of the world
[45:57] and you can imagine with the afghan
[45:59] people as the taliban is now taking over
[46:04] every every aspect of life in
[46:07] afghanistan oh we know that our
[46:10] president on july the 8th was asked the
[46:13] question do you think the taliban will
[46:16] come into ultimate control of
[46:19] afghanistan no
[46:21] i do not
[46:22] because the afghan army is 300
[46:28] 000 strong that's exactly the way
[46:30] expressed it
[46:32] 300 000 strong and they have an air
[46:35] force and they have this and that and
[46:38] the other and the taliban is only 75
[46:42] 000 people
[46:44] but here we are tonight because of that
[46:47] that makes his words even more uncertain
[46:51] than they were before and they were
[46:53] pretty uncertain with a lot of people
[46:55] so here we have thousands of u.s
[46:58] citizens that are there in afghanistan
[47:02] tonight
[47:03] we are not even sure if they will get
[47:06] out now we're dealing with a lot of
[47:07] trouble we know here and you probably
[47:09] saw the pictures and the videos as well
[47:12] that when these c-17 transport planes
[47:15] were coming into the tarmac and actually
[47:17] heading out and you had hundreds and
[47:20] hundreds of afghan people that were
[47:23] holding on to the sides and holding on
[47:26] to the landing gear and some of them
[47:29] actually held on as these c-17s took off
[47:33] into the air and the pictures were taken
[47:35] of their bodies as they were falling out
[47:38] of the sky
[47:40] human remains were actually found
[47:43] closed up in the landing gear why one
[47:47] word
[47:47] uncertainty they were uncertain what
[47:50] would happen to them
[47:52] when the taliban comes in
[47:54] so they felt like they might have a
[47:57] better chance can you imagine a human
[47:58] being being so desperate brother joel
[48:01] they would hang on to a wheel of an
[48:04] airplane that's going to wind up being
[48:06] 40 000 feet 42 000 feet but they were so
[48:10] desperate and what they knew was coming
[48:13] they thought surely they would not let
[48:15] me die they're americans they have a
[48:17] heart they have feeling and yet not only
[48:21] have we treated the afghans that way but
[48:24] we have many of our own citizens that
[48:26] are there i saw video today of a united
[48:29] states citizen and was pleading for help
[48:32] pleading for the american people to
[48:35] reach out to their congress and their
[48:37] senate that they would not be left there
[48:40] why because they are uncertain of the
[48:44] homeland that they belong to
[48:46] they are uncertain of the leadership
[48:49] that we have in the white house now
[48:51] don't get quite on me already they are
[48:54] uncertain of how they're going to be
[48:56] treated they are uncertain of how will
[49:00] they be alive by the time the
[49:02] reinforcements get there or will they be
[49:04] forgotten oh they were promised it will
[49:07] not be like it was at the bay of pigs
[49:10] there will not be any helicopters that
[49:12] will come in and land on the rooftops
[49:14] but of course if you've seen it you saw
[49:17] it happen in 1971 whatever it was and
[49:20] you saw the similar picture now in 2021
[49:24] so what does that create uncertainty
[49:27] there is uncertainty about the
[49:30] atmosphere of the earth there is
[49:33] uncertainty about the climate change
[49:36] there is uncertainty about floods on the
[49:40] east side of the united states and
[49:43] droughts on the west there is
[49:46] uncertainty because we have just
[49:48] recorded in july the hottest months that
[49:51] has ever been recorded since they've
[49:53] been keeping records
[49:55] so we've got ice that's melting here and
[49:58] there and there and some say oh don't
[50:00] worry about it don't pay no attention to
[50:02] it so you go to youtube and you click on
[50:05] it and you go to studying and you'll
[50:06] find some people say oh it's terrible
[50:09] it's terrible and you'll find others
[50:11] with another explanation and you don't
[50:13] know which one to believe
[50:15] well praise the lord so what does it
[50:18] produce an element of uncertainty well
[50:22] i'm not sure if you know it or not but
[50:24] in the last couple of years over a
[50:26] million people have had to relocate in
[50:30] the middle east leaving places like
[50:33] syria and babylon iran iraq different
[50:35] places like that and the main reason was
[50:38] not because of persecution it was not
[50:41] because that the government was actually
[50:44] out to get them but it was a shortage of
[50:48] water because rivers are running dry
[50:51] lakes are running dry
[50:54] and evaporating just this past week the
[50:57] united states government to have
[51:00] proclaimed a drought status on the
[51:03] colorado river
[51:05] affecting lake mead and lake powell for
[51:08] they have reached their lowest levels
[51:10] since it was whenever they were built
[51:13] now that don't affect us you think back
[51:15] here oh but you're very wrong you see
[51:18] the thought that one source of water the
[51:21] colorado river actually takes care of
[51:24] seven states and part of mexico and 40
[51:29] million people get their water to
[51:32] survive from the colorado river now it's
[51:35] not just drinking water but it is also
[51:38] your strawberries that come from
[51:40] california it is your onions it is your
[51:44] lettuce it is this and this and this
[51:47] just this year thousands and thousands
[51:50] of acres of farmland that had to lay in
[51:52] the fertile valleys of california had to
[51:55] lay their idol because they did not have
[51:58] enough allocation of water to be able to
[52:01] grow their crops where are you and i
[52:02] gonna see it at the grocery stores so
[52:05] what is it it is an uncertainty and
[52:09] you're farmers i saw one the other day
[52:11] on youtube actually and it was a fourth
[52:14] generation farmer and their great
[52:17] in them had moved there back in the
[52:18] 1800s and they'd farmed that land and
[52:21] dug ditches and so on to be able to
[52:23] irrigate the land and now this farmer
[52:25] sang with all these thousands and
[52:27] thousands of acres but they're not sure
[52:30] what they're going to do they're going
[52:32] to have to go out of business because
[52:35] there is an uncertainty about the water
[52:38] and we look at california with all the
[52:40] fires that are going on right now you
[52:43] know it of course also when you look in
[52:45] siberia as i saw it day before yesterday
[52:49] the largest fire now on the on the hope
[52:52] entire planet covering thousands and
[52:54] thousands of acres and everywhere we
[52:57] look whether it's from the east or the
[52:59] west it is uncertainty that's going on
[53:03] everywhere
[53:04] it is uncertainty about the fires what
[53:07] are we going to do thousands of
[53:09] structures have been destroyed in
[53:12] california and the last few weeks now of
[53:14] course you know whenever it does this
[53:16] and then when the rains come then it
[53:18] allows all the wash off to come off of
[53:21] there and then it comes to the
[53:23] tributaries and the streams so that
[53:25] creates another problem and then we look
[53:28] at the world powers people are so
[53:31] uncertain and they just don't feel safe
[53:34] well it's china what's china going to do
[53:37] and what's russia going to do and what
[53:39] about iran isn't it amazing that america
[53:42] shut down her embassy in afghanistan but
[53:45] iran did not have to shut thirst down
[53:48] nor did china have to shut theirs down
[53:50] nor did russia have to shut theirs down
[53:53] because they are in cahoots together now
[53:57] think of it it's all all getting ready
[54:00] for america to appear in a very weak
[54:05] vulnerable state to embolden our enemies
[54:09] it to embolden even those that hate us
[54:12] and would love to attack us love to
[54:14] absolutely annihilate us and it also
[54:17] makes us look weak not on inside of our
[54:19] enemies but also in the sight of our
[54:22] allies our allies are running us down
[54:26] because of what has happened in this
[54:29] latest scene in afghanistan and to be
[54:31] honest with you they ought to because
[54:34] many many lies will be lost because of
[54:37] it and yet what was it because of the
[54:40] faltering of our government can't you
[54:42] see friend what it is the whole world
[54:44] around us is falling and crumbling away
[54:48] it must give way to a brand new kingdom
[54:52] and yet what is the producer among the
[54:54] american people our president that many
[54:58] so loved and so thought would turn
[55:01] everything around you had to be a little
[55:02] bit worse thinking in the first place if
[55:04] you hear him talk a little bit and why
[55:06] they kept him here they kept him here
[55:08] for a reason don't you figure because he
[55:10] didn't have no sunscreen didn't want him
[55:11] to get sunburned it was because he was
[55:14] hiding his ability but what is it now
[55:17] now we're stuck with it well you look at
[55:19] who's the vice and you think my goodness
[55:21] what shall we better off with him or her
[55:23] but you know that this must come and
[55:26] watch our enemies look at him they think
[55:28] they are so weak they are so vulnerable
[55:32] and it must embolden our enemies russia
[55:36] wouldn't be something to be in some of
[55:37] their inner circle meetings and hear
[55:40] them as they are talking about us and
[55:42] our leader the leader of the free world
[55:46] our president is not just to lead to the
[55:48] united states but he's known around the
[55:50] world no matter who he is in the white
[55:52] house is known as the leader of the free
[55:55] world if this is the leader of the free
[55:57] world freedom is in trouble
[56:00] and what does it produce it produces
[56:04] uncertainty and yet it leaves something
[56:07] and uncertainty creates doubt and it can
[56:10] create fear oh but i'm so glad tonight
[56:14] that the bride of christ has an absolute
[56:17] and that is christ the word
[56:20] oh you imagine living in this world and
[56:23] people not knowing what the answer is
[56:26] and people looking on the powers of
[56:28] america it's hard to believe really that
[56:30] we've changed this fast in seven months
[56:34] under this new presidency what has
[56:37] happened and how america has eroded to
[56:40] where that we were energy free and
[56:43] selling all this all and this now the
[56:45] other now we have to beg the old nations
[56:48] to be able to sell to us it's amazing
[56:50] how things can happen so fast oh but i'm
[56:54] so glad that the bride of christ is
[56:57] getting ready every day of her life i'm
[57:00] uncertain too about politics i'm just
[57:03] not certain which one's going to be it's
[57:05] going to this or that or the other i'm
[57:07] uncertain about this and that when it
[57:09] comes to the natural realm but i'm so
[57:11] glad i've got a certainty in my soul
[57:13] tonight
[57:15] notice this the prophet goes on to say
[57:17] you've got to have the certainty of
[57:19] anything to know whether it's right or
[57:23] not so what does that leave us in
[57:25] whenever we don't have a certainty about
[57:28] something well i don't know i don't know
[57:30] if this is right or that's why i'm just
[57:32] confused and that's exactly where the
[57:34] majority of our world is now we're
[57:35] living in a day of great uncertainty we
[57:38] all know that the day of uncertainty and
[57:40] the time of uncertainty i don't believe
[57:42] there was ever a time since it first
[57:45] began back in the garden of eden when
[57:48] sin come in and broke eternity into time
[57:52] i do not believe there's ever been a
[57:54] space of time with so much uncertainty
[57:58] now can you imagine this one was 1960.
[58:02] here we are 61 years or whatever more
[58:05] later what would he say now brother dave
[58:08] if it was uncertain in 1960 what about
[58:12] 2021
[58:15] oh my oh my i do not believe there's
[58:18] ever been a space of time with so much
[58:21] uncertainty as today because there's not
[58:23] even one hope left in the natural world
[58:27] today so no matter which way you look
[58:30] dealing with our situation to where we
[58:33] are in the present time dealing with
[58:36] diseases and sicknesses and you know all
[58:39] the epidemiologists saying to this and
[58:41] one say to that and one say something
[58:44] else and this and went to college 18
[58:45] years this and went 14 years and they're
[58:48] saying opposite things they say which
[58:49] one do i follow which one do i do we've
[58:52] got baxters and anti-vaxxers and
[58:55] massacres and end time actors and then
[58:57] they'll come to the same church you know
[58:59] well one don't believe this and one
[59:00] believes in that some still don't
[59:02] believe covetous real they still think
[59:04] it's made up believe me i've buried
[59:06] enough people to know it is real
[59:09] is it lies is it politics oh yes all
[59:12] that's attached to it but friends this
[59:14] virus itself is a killer that's right
[59:18] notice this now let's take something
[59:20] else he said that's uncertain just so
[59:23] many things jobs is uncertain i was
[59:25] thinking about this whenever i'm
[59:26] studying on this how different now
[59:28] whenever brother branham was here about
[59:30] jobs but now we've got jobs but we've
[59:33] got too many lazy people that don't want
[59:35] them because our government is paying
[59:37] them to stay at home
[59:40] my goodness you've got we hire signs at
[59:43] wendy's at mcdonald's everywhere five
[59:45] thousand dollar sign on bonus you gotta
[59:48] be kidding me working at a drive-through
[59:51] and they're gonna pay you five thousand
[59:52] dollars sign on bonus we're giving this
[59:55] and we're giving that but what is it
[59:57] it's an uncertainty and look eventually
[1:00:00] them checks are gonna stop
[1:00:02] somebody's gonna have to pay this big
[1:00:04] bill when we're writing all this money
[1:00:07] well come on somebody somebody's gonna
[1:00:09] have to take care of all this our
[1:00:11] government can't do it remember the same
[1:00:14] government that's doing all this are the
[1:00:16] same ones that just made these decisions
[1:00:18] about afghanistan so if you think you
[1:00:20] can trust them look at their record and
[1:00:23] you'll realize there's a bunch of liars
[1:00:25] a bunch of thieves and they ain't got no
[1:00:27] business being there in the first place
[1:00:29] so let me point you in the direction
[1:00:31] tonight that we can look it's not toward
[1:00:35] the white house it's not toward any
[1:00:37] place on this earth our vision should be
[1:00:40] toward the lord jesus
[1:00:45] oh my
[1:00:47] he said you can have a good job you sink
[1:00:49] and the next day the boss comes around
[1:00:52] and gets somebody else and kicks you out
[1:00:54] and puts somebody else in so it's
[1:00:56] uncertainty of your job let's think also
[1:01:00] home life is uncertain divorce might as
[1:01:03] i was looking at the stats on this how
[1:01:05] it's increased around the world in the
[1:01:07] last few years even during the time of
[1:01:10] covet more people are
[1:01:12] found for divorce more people have been
[1:01:16] all kinds of things one after another
[1:01:18] after another because people have been
[1:01:21] forced to live at home and they realized
[1:01:23] they didn't love that man they married
[1:01:25] that woman they're married after all
[1:01:26] they was having to spend more time with
[1:01:28] them on normal work basis they just
[1:01:30] spent a couple hours a day and now
[1:01:31] they're shut up in the same house and
[1:01:33] they say you know what i don't like this
[1:01:35] guy so you know lawyers have been taking
[1:01:37] advantage of it and putting up
[1:01:39] advertisements on youtube and facebook
[1:01:42] and this and that divorce lawyers
[1:01:44] because it shot through the roof oh you
[1:01:47] got them crooks that take advantage of
[1:01:49] everybody's heartache and trouble and
[1:01:51] what is it home life is uncertain and
[1:01:54] we've got to a place that our government
[1:01:57] wants to tell us how to raise our
[1:01:59] children
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:03] that's right they want to tell us how to
[1:02:06] raise our children what we can do and
[1:02:09] what we cannot do and how we can do this
[1:02:12] now another don't tell me friends i just
[1:02:14] got a call the last few days from one of
[1:02:17] our great great people from jmc you know
[1:02:21] all this and this deal over to med
[1:02:23] center and moana talk to me about why we
[1:02:26] preach this and preach that and the
[1:02:28] other and that a certain person didn't
[1:02:30] want to live this way and comply that
[1:02:33] way and it's really harmful for their
[1:02:35] health and they don't need to do this
[1:02:37] and that and the other one me to
[1:02:39] compromise on what we believe to be the
[1:02:43] truth and then try to bring a little bit
[1:02:45] of threat to you well you want to be
[1:02:47] held accountable i said do you want to
[1:02:49] be held accountable you want to be held
[1:02:51] accountable if we give in on this part
[1:02:53] and then we give on something else and
[1:02:55] something else and you stand before god
[1:02:58] are you willing to answer for that
[1:02:59] person so thank you sir have a good day
[1:03:03] that phone call didn't equip but what do
[1:03:05] they want to do they don't want to just
[1:03:08] let you live the way you think you want
[1:03:10] to live the government wants to be able
[1:03:12] to control us and tell us what we can do
[1:03:15] cannot do will they do the hindus that
[1:03:17] way of course not well they do the
[1:03:19] muslims that way of course not but it's
[1:03:22] the conservative christians that have a
[1:03:24] standard for the word of god come on
[1:03:27] somebody preach on it enough but why
[1:03:29] does it make it it makes it uncertain oh
[1:03:32] my
[1:03:33] it makes the times that we live
[1:03:35] uncertain it makes church life now i
[1:03:38] hate to say it this way but i might as
[1:03:40] well church life is uncertain for a lot
[1:03:42] of folks you know they just don't
[1:03:44] understand what in the world is going on
[1:03:46] well i'll be the first one to admit to
[1:03:48] you i don't understand all that's going
[1:03:49] on either i i never realized that we
[1:03:53] would go through such things as we have
[1:03:55] been over the last year and has it been
[1:03:58] tough yes it's been tough on you it's
[1:04:00] been tough on me tough on the ministry
[1:04:01] been tough on all of us but i realize
[1:04:04] also at the same time as difficult as
[1:04:06] it's been i just heard today that some
[1:04:09] of the churches in the philippines have
[1:04:11] not been able to assemble together and
[1:04:14] have church for 18
[1:04:16] months
[1:04:22] so it's not been so bad for us
[1:04:25] after all has it
[1:04:27] and we didn't like it because we had to
[1:04:28] stream
[1:04:30] we didn't like because it was 10 or 12
[1:04:31] of us i didn't either i didn't like it
[1:04:33] but can you imagine not being able to
[1:04:36] meet together for 18 months you imagine
[1:04:39] brother fred how uncertain that you
[1:04:42] would be in the supernatural realm and
[1:04:44] then satan throws all these thoughts hey
[1:04:46] i thought you said god loved you god
[1:04:48] knew this was going to come and you're
[1:04:49] supposed to go to church well why did
[1:04:51] god let all this happen well i just i
[1:04:53] have to answer oh blabber mouse back and
[1:04:55] say i don't have a clue but me and you
[1:04:57] ain't on speaking terms so i'm not
[1:05:00] wasting my time talking to you i'll just
[1:05:02] talk to father and say father i don't
[1:05:04] understand but i know it's all gonna
[1:05:06] work for our good somehow i don't
[1:05:08] understand why we was not able to have
[1:05:11] church i don't understand why but don't
[1:05:13] you imagine friends in the times of the
[1:05:15] early martyrdom and you think we've lost
[1:05:18] several out of our church many people
[1:05:20] around the world have died during this
[1:05:22] time of the covenant with saying wow
[1:05:23] what a terrible saying but can you
[1:05:25] imagine a selling carol come to church
[1:05:27] tonight in the days of the martyrdom and
[1:05:30] whenever they would come and attack the
[1:05:31] churches in in corinth or in rome or
[1:05:34] thessalonica wherever it was and the
[1:05:36] romans would come and get them and
[1:05:38] crucify them and beat their brains out
[1:05:40] and all the horrible things they would
[1:05:41] do and maybe annihilate an entire church
[1:05:46] an entire church
[1:05:48] in a couple of days take an entire
[1:05:51] church to the coliseum of rome
[1:05:54] and there lose the pastor the deacons
[1:05:57] the all ever ever member of the church
[1:06:00] and the church be totally eradicated
[1:06:04] you imagined by the john it must have
[1:06:06] been in their humanity and they think
[1:06:09] god what is going on how could this be
[1:06:12] your will lord lord we do not understand
[1:06:15] and it went on and on all that i love
[1:06:17] the way the book of acts says it the
[1:06:19] bible says that the churches had rest so
[1:06:23] god let them be tried and he let them be
[1:06:26] tested and then god gave them a season
[1:06:29] of rest i don't know about you i'm
[1:06:30] hoping it's right around the corner for
[1:06:32] us
[1:06:33] but god knows exactly what to let
[1:06:36] families and churches and ministries go
[1:06:39] through we believe his word he'll never
[1:06:41] let more come upon us than what we are
[1:06:44] able to bear how he believes that
[1:06:46] absolutely as the saints of god we do
[1:06:49] what's this problem the prophet said let
[1:06:50] us take home life it is uncertain you
[1:06:53] don't know what's happened to the moral
[1:06:55] fiber of our women brother branham betty
[1:06:59] if you was here today you'd really ask
[1:07:00] that
[1:07:02] divorce is on the move why it's terrible
[1:07:05] well you see the divorce courts are
[1:07:06] crowded where girls and boys will marry
[1:07:09] and live together have two three kitties
[1:07:11] or something like that and they'll
[1:07:12] separate and go out and marry another
[1:07:14] marry another marry another marry
[1:07:16] another
[1:07:18] oh my goodness
[1:07:21] oh children what what will it be if the
[1:07:24] lord tarries
[1:07:25] a few more years
[1:07:27] do you realize that 72 percent
[1:07:30] of black children in america
[1:07:33] are born
[1:07:34] without a father in the home
[1:07:38] hispanics
[1:07:40] indians whites it's not just in one race
[1:07:44] but over the whole spectrum
[1:07:47] raising them in a home and many times
[1:07:49] they don't even know who their father is
[1:07:52] because the way the mother lived
[1:07:55] and what is that going to do
[1:07:57] it's going to make them uncertain it's
[1:08:00] going to put well they don't know if
[1:08:01] they can trust a man they can't trust a
[1:08:04] woman they can't trust this and it's
[1:08:06] getting about that way anymore when it
[1:08:08] comes to church people don't know who to
[1:08:10] trust well i don't think trust this one
[1:08:11] he says this this one says that but it's
[1:08:14] uncertainty everywhere you look
[1:08:18] unless you're looking up this way
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:21] now don't look up here and think you can
[1:08:24] find the certainty your soul needs ah
[1:08:27] i'm just as much a human as you are i i
[1:08:30] misunderstand things just like you do
[1:08:33] and sometimes i've been in the dark
[1:08:34] about what we've been going through just
[1:08:36] like you have but look in the same
[1:08:39] direction i'm looking follow me as long
[1:08:41] as i follow christ and this is where my
[1:08:43] eyes are
[1:08:44] up this way
[1:08:45] now watch this the brother said the
[1:08:47] uncertainty of home life the uncertainty
[1:08:49] of job the uncertainty of war the
[1:08:51] uncertainty of churches my it's amazing
[1:08:55] how many thousands of churches have
[1:08:58] folded up
[1:09:00] during covet
[1:09:02] thousands of churches that no longer
[1:09:06] even have church
[1:09:09] why it's so uncertain and for some of
[1:09:12] them that are open they've lost so many
[1:09:15] people they're having to rent out part
[1:09:17] of their building for daycare or for
[1:09:20] offices or this or that or the other to
[1:09:22] be able to keep the electricity bills
[1:09:24] paid and part of the overhead
[1:09:27] it's so uncertain don't you see what the
[1:09:31] world needs
[1:09:32] the world needs
[1:09:34] a messiah
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:37] the whole thing is setting up everywhere
[1:09:40] all around the globe they need a
[1:09:44] superman
[1:09:46] oh and the devil's got one right in the
[1:09:48] making
[1:09:49] this is going to fall apart and that's
[1:09:51] going to fall apart and that's going to
[1:09:53] fall apart and all mine when the bride
[1:09:55] is going up then here will be the man
[1:09:58] that'll step right in and said children
[1:10:00] i'm the man you've been looking for
[1:10:02] i will cross craft to prosper which is
[1:10:05] prosperity of course merchandise and
[1:10:07] manufacturing i will do this and i will
[1:10:10] do that and the world will swoon after
[1:10:12] him and they will follow him straight to
[1:10:15] the gates of hell oh brother donna i'm
[1:10:17] worried about it don't worry about if
[1:10:18] you got the holy ghost you ain't going
[1:10:20] to be here nowhere
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:22] notice this he said you just can't
[1:10:24] evaluate it hardly because there's no
[1:10:28] way to evaluate
[1:10:32] what a experience
[1:10:34] in the holy ghost is
[1:10:36] to a membership
[1:10:38] of a church
[1:10:40] now he's comparing church membership to
[1:10:43] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:45] there ain't even no comparison
[1:10:48] there's no comparison whatsoever and it
[1:10:51] is not uncertain
[1:10:54] praise god
[1:10:56] notice he said we live in a day
[1:10:59] of uncertainty can you imagine in the
[1:11:02] times of martyrdom and persecution and
[1:11:05] the church did not have
[1:11:07] retrospectibility the way we do today
[1:11:10] and we can look back and see when the
[1:11:12] prophet wrote to us the seals by the
[1:11:13] inspiration of god that god was sowing a
[1:11:16] seed down into the ground paul never
[1:11:19] said that paul never said look children
[1:11:21] don't worry there's another bride that's
[1:11:23] going to come up the omega bride 2 000
[1:11:25] years down the road and you're the alpha
[1:11:27] bride and you've got to be buried in the
[1:11:29] dirt of denomination so the omega bride
[1:11:32] can come out of those systems and bring
[1:11:35] forth the very same crop you did now but
[1:11:38] instead they've just wondering oh lord
[1:11:40] what's going on oh god so you go to
[1:11:42] church
[1:11:43] and you lose your life for going to
[1:11:45] church
[1:11:46] you go to the house of god and you and
[1:11:48] your wife are arrested
[1:11:50] and somebody else gets your children
[1:11:52] you're torched you're fed to lions you
[1:11:55] think they didn't have some uncertainty
[1:11:57] you think they didn't say god what what
[1:11:59] is god i never realized me serving you
[1:12:02] lord that i would deal with this i don't
[1:12:04] understand lord i don't understand and
[1:12:07] oh brother sister i'll tell you one
[1:12:08] thing when satan can see that
[1:12:10] uncertainty in our heart he loves to
[1:12:12] attack that avenue well what about this
[1:12:15] and what about that and how come this
[1:12:18] and what about that and you might as
[1:12:20] well just go and say him to it much of
[1:12:22] it we are not going to understand we
[1:12:24] just have to commit it to god and say
[1:12:26] lord you work it all out according to
[1:12:28] your good pleasure
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:30] my notice he said we live in a day of
[1:12:32] uncertainty we live in a day when
[1:12:33] there's everything almost that we can
[1:12:36] put our hands on and the natural
[1:12:39] is uncertain
[1:12:41] oh my goodness
[1:12:45] so here we are
[1:12:47] we thought
[1:12:49] we was coming out
[1:12:52] of a pandemic
[1:12:55] we didn't realize
[1:12:58] that there was going to be
[1:13:00] variance
[1:13:02] we saw when we went through some of you
[1:13:04] in july and august and may and whatever
[1:13:07] it was in 2020
[1:13:09] my praise god we got that behind us
[1:13:13] and by then we already was pretty much
[1:13:16] convinced we couldn't really trust our
[1:13:18] government
[1:13:20] and we sure can't trust china
[1:13:23] don't you love the way china does things
[1:13:24] i mean if this actually did come out
[1:13:26] from the wuhan uh place there
[1:13:29] they send it to us
[1:13:30] and then they start making masks and
[1:13:33] send them to us
[1:13:34] wow ain't that cute
[1:13:39] and i told carol a month or so ago i
[1:13:41] said if you notice how many more masks
[1:13:44] that there are and it seemed like they
[1:13:46] were dying down and you wasn't seeing
[1:13:48] them nowhere and i told her i said i
[1:13:50] sure hope that ain't a sign
[1:13:52] of things that are to come
[1:13:54] and then here you go we get another
[1:13:56] variant oh but now they're so cool with
[1:13:59] those masks because now what they're
[1:14:01] doing is color coordinating the mask for
[1:14:03] the ladies so if you have the blue polka
[1:14:06] dot desk so i say erica's got on and
[1:14:08] then they're they're so nice and cool
[1:14:10] because they're making that that mask to
[1:14:12] match that dress now isn't is that not
[1:14:14] that fashion or what
[1:14:16] do you think friends do you think then
[1:14:19] that they tell us it didn't happen by
[1:14:21] mistake and you are going to believe
[1:14:23] that
[1:14:24] you are going to believe that whenever
[1:14:27] our surgeon general stood and said the
[1:14:29] masks are useless they are useless
[1:14:34] the same man said just a couple of weeks
[1:14:36] ago and said oops we made a mistake we
[1:14:38] shouldn't have said that so was he right
[1:14:40] then or right now i wore the mask i
[1:14:43] sanitized my hands i've done everything
[1:14:45] like i was supposed to do and got
[1:14:47] covered anyway
[1:14:48] did it make much difference i don't know
[1:14:50] if it made any difference or not other
[1:14:52] than smothering me to death the whole
[1:14:53] time i wore the crazy thing
[1:14:56] you think i like mess you're crazy
[1:14:58] there's only one masked man that i used
[1:15:00] to like and that was zorro when i was a
[1:15:02] kid but i have grown up so i don't like
[1:15:05] him on me i don't like him on you well
[1:15:08] come on and then we come to the vaccine
[1:15:11] and then oh my we've got message people
[1:15:13] that are fussing and fighting in
[1:15:15] argument and this and that and the other
[1:15:18] and we've got the vaccers and the
[1:15:19] message and the anti-vaxxers in the
[1:15:21] message and each one of them has got
[1:15:23] their little debits you know well they
[1:15:25] can be able to click on youtube or this
[1:15:27] doctor that doctor depending on which
[1:15:29] way you lean and which way you want to
[1:15:31] go towards and the bottom line is there
[1:15:34] is just as much uncertainty now as it
[1:15:37] was when it started months and months
[1:15:39] ago what shall we do brother donnie pray
[1:15:42] saints
[1:15:43] pray with all of us we cannot trust our
[1:15:47] government we cannot trust even a lot of
[1:15:50] our health care people they're pushing
[1:15:52] people out of there you know it as well
[1:15:54] as i do they've got so much on their
[1:15:57] hands there's no way people are getting
[1:15:59] the care they need
[1:16:01] because they can't give it to them
[1:16:04] it's uncertain
[1:16:06] i sure wouldn't want to go to a hospital
[1:16:08] right now i don't mind telling you
[1:16:13] well hallelujah
[1:16:17] praise god
[1:16:19] why it's uncertain and then this this
[1:16:22] great doctor that's got this degree i
[1:16:23] was reading some of them to carol last
[1:16:25] night which trained brother ron spencer
[1:16:27] services i was reading some things out
[1:16:28] of carol and this guy was so-and-so the
[1:16:30] immunologist so and so and so and so and
[1:16:32] so and so on he had so many things i
[1:16:34] just added a few myself and i called him
[1:16:37] reseology and s'moreology and all that
[1:16:39] other stuff too because i thought man a
[1:16:41] guy with that many degrees he needs a
[1:16:42] couple more so carol was just sitting
[1:16:44] there of course laughing at me and then
[1:16:46] he said one thing and then i pulled up
[1:16:48] another one with all these degrees
[1:16:49] behind his name and he said the exact
[1:16:51] opposite now you're saying which one was
[1:16:53] right rhysology or s'moreology
[1:16:59] what does it produce for those of you
[1:17:02] that would even want to know where would
[1:17:04] you look for an answer of truth
[1:17:12] well brother donnie i trust the
[1:17:14] statistics which ones
[1:17:16] whose or cdc's
[1:17:19] or wuhan's
[1:17:23] what is it friend
[1:17:25] it's a time
[1:17:26] it's a time
[1:17:28] of uncertainty
[1:17:30] now i'm not telling you not to be
[1:17:32] concerned about such things i think
[1:17:33] these things are important to us and i
[1:17:35] think each of us have to make the
[1:17:37] decisions about what we do and all this
[1:17:40] stuff of life oh my i hope you
[1:17:42] understand the reasons that i've even
[1:17:44] asked for mask and this and that and the
[1:17:45] other it's not to make life hard on you
[1:17:48] it's to protect you i love you
[1:17:51] if that be one person that we could stop
[1:17:53] from getting i'd do everything i could
[1:17:56] to stop one person believe me i don't
[1:17:58] want to lose another one i prayed and
[1:18:00] prayed and prayed and stood by those
[1:18:02] that were gasping for breath if there's
[1:18:04] one thing i could do to stop one of you
[1:18:07] from being there you better believe i'm
[1:18:08] going to do it whether you understand me
[1:18:10] or not or whether you think i'm
[1:18:12] overboard or not that's entirely up to
[1:18:14] you but when i stand before god i will
[1:18:17] give an account for trying my best to
[1:18:19] spare you this hell
[1:18:23] and people are still
[1:18:24] uncertain well
[1:18:27] i don't know
[1:18:28] you're going to get the one shot or the
[1:18:30] two
[1:18:31] i ain't getting neither one of them
[1:18:32] things and blessed things i'll tell you
[1:18:34] one thing them straight out of the pits
[1:18:36] of hell they'll most shot by them things
[1:18:38] they just come up with them somebody
[1:18:40] else said no
[1:18:41] they've been working on this technology
[1:18:43] for 20 20 years that's a bunch of lies
[1:18:45] you can't believe them liars
[1:18:49] and there you go
[1:18:51] and you was ready to pull into walgreens
[1:18:53] and make your appointment
[1:18:56] and then you pull back out and say thank
[1:18:57] you jesus
[1:18:58] thank you jesus
[1:19:02] and then you hear of these stats and
[1:19:04] these things you're saying oh maybe i
[1:19:05] should do it you say no it's the devil
[1:19:07] that's the devil trying to talk me into
[1:19:09] it
[1:19:11] children it's sad where we are
[1:19:13] now you're laughing but you know it's
[1:19:15] the truth
[1:19:16] some of our own people don't know what
[1:19:18] to do and don't you ask me because i
[1:19:20] ain't gonna tell you
[1:19:22] i'll tell you the same thing i've told
[1:19:24] everybody else around the world that's
[1:19:25] asked me you asked god
[1:19:27] you asked god what you ought to do and
[1:19:29] you're getting a shot which one you
[1:19:31] ought to give you ask god and he'll
[1:19:34] never tell you're wrong
[1:19:38] oh hallelujah so there's uncertainty in
[1:19:41] science scientifically prove this and
[1:19:44] this and this and this
[1:19:45] and then six months later scientifically
[1:19:47] prove this and this and this
[1:19:50] and i guess it depends on which side of
[1:19:52] the six months you are whether you're
[1:19:53] saved or not
[1:19:56] so what do you do you're so uncertain
[1:19:57] you don't know what to do and then you
[1:19:59] got people in the message preachers that
[1:20:01] are preaching that the vaccine is the
[1:20:04] mark of the beast
[1:20:06] how can a message preacher be so
[1:20:07] ignorant
[1:20:09] you ought to study the message y'all
[1:20:11] just have to make them the vaccine is
[1:20:13] not the mark of the beast the mark of
[1:20:16] the beast is denominational
[1:20:16] denominationalism
[1:20:20] well praise the lord
[1:20:22] and then you've got others that say oh
[1:20:24] my this certain certain woman she got
[1:20:26] the vaccine and when she walked by a
[1:20:28] computer her name splashed up on there
[1:20:31] and her address
[1:20:33] and her social security number
[1:20:35] oh lord
[1:20:40] it's probably more dangerous for you to
[1:20:41] go out here and get in your car
[1:20:43] and pull out on this highway which i
[1:20:45] won't miss none when we get away from
[1:20:47] here
[1:20:49] and we worry and fret do you understand
[1:20:51] the prophet of god said the worst thing
[1:20:55] satan can ever put upon you is fear
[1:20:59] [Music]
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:02] someone was telling me the other day
[1:21:03] they heard the different things about
[1:21:04] people who get the covet and the
[1:21:06] different things that lead to mortality
[1:21:08] about it and there's talking about this
[1:21:10] and that and the other you know and the
[1:21:11] second most important thing that this
[1:21:13] board of doctors was saying that they
[1:21:16] felt like was one of the worst things
[1:21:17] that could happen to people was fear
[1:21:21] fear i thought yeah that's what their
[1:21:22] prophet said all those years ago fear
[1:21:25] and people are terrified oh i believe we
[1:21:28] should be cautious yes i believe we
[1:21:30] ought to wash our hands i believe we
[1:21:32] ought to do whatever we can do but
[1:21:34] friends don't live under the fear of
[1:21:36] this thing our lives are not in the
[1:21:39] hands of the devil they are in the hands
[1:21:42] of almighty god if we don't believe that
[1:21:44] we might as well quit serving
[1:21:49] hallelujah
[1:21:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:57] a time
[1:21:59] of uncertainty notice he said we live in
[1:22:01] a day of uncertainty and living today
[1:22:03] almost everything you put your hands on
[1:22:05] the natural it's uncertain so much
[1:22:07] uncertainty till the nations are quaking
[1:22:10] uncertainty in our national security
[1:22:13] there's no nation safe anymore
[1:22:16] to be the victims to russia by midnight
[1:22:19] tonight now you imagine this is 1961.
[1:22:23] what could they do now
[1:22:25] or either being bits it depends on what
[1:22:28] russia
[1:22:29] wants to do about it
[1:22:31] what did that last angel's message say
[1:22:35] listen to this carefully
[1:22:37] when he crossed
[1:22:39] the three angels
[1:22:41] babylon has fallen is fallen and become
[1:22:45] the habitation
[1:22:46] of every unclean spirit
[1:22:49] that's exactly where it's at sure
[1:22:52] we have no security
[1:22:54] in our nation don't you see that third
[1:22:57] angel's message
[1:22:58] has already sounded
[1:23:01] doom has done been pronounced on babylon
[1:23:05] and she will finally be blowed to bits
[1:23:08] i don't care who we put in the white
[1:23:10] house it will make no difference
[1:23:12] something's worse than others we know
[1:23:14] that but it don't matter who we put in
[1:23:16] there they will never change it
[1:23:19] the message of the angel has already
[1:23:21] come forth babylon is fallen
[1:23:24] it's faulty it's uncertain everywhere
[1:23:27] uncertainty there's no way there's
[1:23:29] uncertainty in your job uncertainty in
[1:23:31] politics uncertainty in the democrat
[1:23:34] party uncertainty in the republican
[1:23:36] party uncertainty in all the parties
[1:23:40] well friends if you think this is just
[1:23:42] an america you need to open your eyes a
[1:23:44] little bit look in france

[1:23:50] in france which is a very liberal nation
[1:23:52] compared to us

[1:23:56] mandates of this and that and the other

[1:25:25] i get ready to leave tonight it'll tell
[1:25:27] me exactly how long it's going to take
[1:25:28] me to go home and it'll be right unless
[1:25:31] i go through taco bell and get a taco so
[1:25:33] if they can do that how much more are
[1:25:36] they listening are they watching just in
[1:25:39] case you feds are listening this sermon

[1:25:43] saved and get the holy ghost for this
[1:25:45] whole thing blows apart
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:52] well don't you want them saved
[1:25:56] hallelujah
[1:25:58] well all you say the democrats are do it
[1:26:00] we can well see what they've done
[1:26:02] and we can well see what happened when
[1:26:04] the republicans had it don't you
[1:26:06] understand neither party can turn it
[1:26:08] around
[1:26:09] it's doomed and damned
[1:26:13] oh my
[1:26:14] notice the prophet said in the church
[1:26:16] it's also uncertainty how can we have
[1:26:18] about 900 different organizations and
[1:26:21] every one of them differ one to the
[1:26:23] other and fussing one or the other how
[1:26:25] can a poor laity know what to do how can
[1:26:29] the people know where to stand and what
[1:26:31] does it make uncertain well my mama was
[1:26:34] a baptist but then she married a
[1:26:36] methodist and then my uncle was a
[1:26:38] pentecostal so i'm a pentecostal myth a
[1:26:40] heck of alcoholic bad catholic uh i
[1:26:43] don't know what i am that's right they
[1:26:44] really don't know where they fit they
[1:26:47] don't know where they're blocked well
[1:26:48] one's just as good let's see him if my
[1:26:50] daddy was a pentecostal and my mama was
[1:26:52] a baptist does that mean i'm a baby or a
[1:26:55] penny baby or a method
[1:26:57] i don't know what i am anymore i don't
[1:26:59] want him i can tell you what i am a word
[1:27:02] born holy ghost filled heaven bound
[1:27:05] christian so ain't got no group i
[1:27:07] identify with as far as the nomination
[1:27:09] but i want to know that i'm certain i
[1:27:12] want to know that i can be certain when
[1:27:14] i die that i have made peace with my god
[1:27:17] and i've done everything that i know to
[1:27:20] do
[1:27:22] oh praise the lord
[1:27:29] let me jump down to the last quote here
[1:27:31] we'll close you've done good thank you
[1:27:37] look at this in the absolute in phoenix
[1:27:40] what the christian needs today
[1:27:44] in this atomic age
[1:27:46] and this time of uncertainty
[1:27:49] you need something besides just an
[1:27:51] experience
[1:27:53] of joining church
[1:27:55] you need an anchor
[1:27:57] an absolute
[1:27:59] that you know
[1:28:00] because churches will fail
[1:28:03] people will fail
[1:28:05] but christ cannot fail now i want you to
[1:28:07] notice
[1:28:08] how your prophet what he pointed us to
[1:28:11] as the absolute
[1:28:14] and if we point to anything different
[1:28:16] from him we're not saying what he said
[1:28:20] now notice because churches will fail
[1:28:23] people will fail but christ cannot fail
[1:28:25] he's he's the absolute
[1:28:28] to
[1:28:29] the believer
[1:28:31] and if christ is your absolute you're
[1:28:35] tied to him and if he is your absolute
[1:28:40] and you're tied to him then you're tied
[1:28:43] to
[1:28:44] the word
[1:28:45] well politics is uncertain that's right
[1:28:48] churches are uncertain that's right but
[1:28:50] if you have got a place that you can tie
[1:28:52] look we don't want to be tied to a
[1:28:54] doctrine in this message i don't want to
[1:28:57] be tied to jeffersonville i don't want
[1:28:58] to be tied to some church in louisiana
[1:29:01] some church in alabama i want to be tied
[1:29:04] to the lord jesus
[1:29:06] now watch he's going to tell us how
[1:29:08] we'll know
[1:29:09] if you're tithed there or not
[1:29:11] now this tells whether you've got the
[1:29:14] right absolute or not c
[1:29:16] if you can read in that scripture
[1:29:20] something that christ has ordained or
[1:29:23] commissioned us to do
[1:29:26] such as lay hands on the sick or preach
[1:29:29] or you know whatever christ has
[1:29:31] commissioned us to do
[1:29:32] and because of some twisting around
[1:29:36] and if someone would tell you
[1:29:39] that was for the disciples or someone
[1:29:42] else
[1:29:44] you don't hold on to that then christ
[1:29:48] is not your absolute
[1:29:50] so someone tells you that brother
[1:29:52] branham was all of the fivefold ministry
[1:29:54] and we don't need any more preachers
[1:29:56] their absolute is not christ
[1:29:59] according to the seventh angel
[1:30:02] well well well he's the same yesterday
[1:30:04] and forever except we don't believe in
[1:30:06] miracles and we don't believe in well
[1:30:07] your absolute is not christ how could
[1:30:09] you be tied to christ when your life
[1:30:12] being saved by god is a miracle and you
[1:30:15] not believe in miracles how could a
[1:30:17] miracle not believe in other miracles
[1:30:21] oh praise god friends right here's a
[1:30:23] problem many of our folks christ is not
[1:30:26] they're absolute
[1:30:30] well praise god
[1:30:32] then christ is not your absolute that
[1:30:36] person
[1:30:38] who led you
[1:30:40] out of the way
[1:30:44] is
[1:30:45] your
[1:30:46] absolute
[1:30:49] oh my but if that word christ still
[1:30:53] holds see
[1:30:54] then he's your absolute we mustn't let
[1:30:58] anything stir us out of the way
[1:31:01] of the word
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:05] and the church said
[1:31:08] covet 19
[1:31:10] vaccers
[1:31:11] anti-vaxxers massacres anti-massacres
[1:31:15] churches anti-churches
[1:31:19] make sure you've got a thai post
[1:31:23] please don't misunderstand me when i say
[1:31:24] this your typos cannot be your memory in
[1:31:28] quoting scriptures some people think
[1:31:31] that's their typos them quoting you'll
[1:31:33] get to a spot you'll lose your memory
[1:31:35] but if christ is in your soul even when
[1:31:38] your memory is gone brother tom you've
[1:31:40] still got that top host in the soul
[1:31:43] don't make your toe oh well brother
[1:31:45] branham is my absolute i can understand
[1:31:47] where you're going i can understand
[1:31:50] where you are going
[1:31:52] but the man himself that you are calling
[1:31:54] his name
[1:31:55] told us to make christ our absolute yes
[1:31:59] we take his teachings and we believe as
[1:32:01] it was in the days of paul when they
[1:32:03] took that that it was a prophet's word
[1:32:04] that's right but and when you come to
[1:32:07] this you cannot get brother branham in
[1:32:10] your soul
[1:32:11] then this doctrine that doctrine this
[1:32:14] man that man there's only one person
[1:32:16] that can get in your soul and that's
[1:32:19] christ jesus or the devil
[1:32:23] make christ your absolute and if you get
[1:32:26] the holy ghost in your soul don't you
[1:32:28] worry you'll have the right balance with
[1:32:30] the message
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:34] can we stand together
[1:32:37] thank you lord jesus
[1:32:48] hallelujah
[1:32:51] thank you lord jesus
[1:32:54] thank you lord jesus
[1:32:57] aren't you glad in this day of
[1:32:58] uncertainty
[1:32:59] we have an absolute
[1:33:02] a tied post to our souls
[1:33:05] we'll always have these things of life
[1:33:06] friends
[1:33:07] he said brother tony you didn't answer
[1:33:09] on these questions exactly right
[1:33:12] exactly right
[1:33:14] i am not to be
[1:33:16] the person that you come to and has the
[1:33:18] answer you run from any man that has all
[1:33:21] the answers for your life he's lying to
[1:33:24] you
[1:33:26] even the prophet of god couldn't answer
[1:33:28] everything everybody asked
[1:33:30] there's only one that can do that and
[1:33:31] that's almighty god
[1:33:34] but this is something about it whenever
[1:33:36] we're uncertain about this and that and
[1:33:38] the other can you imagine the world out
[1:33:40] here now
[1:33:41] many of them don't know what to believe
[1:33:42] they don't know which way to go they're
[1:33:44] not sure about our peace are we going to
[1:33:46] have any peace what about our money what
[1:33:47] about our rights what about this what
[1:33:49] about that what about that
[1:33:50] and every one of them feeding on one
[1:33:52] source of the news and then someone else
[1:33:54] feeds feeding on another source and then
[1:33:55] they they talk and they hash it all out
[1:33:58] oh my goodness and if they don't have an
[1:34:00] absolute and really know where this
[1:34:02] thing's going to end can you imagine
[1:34:04] when they lay down at night
[1:34:06] how troubled they must be
[1:34:10] but tell me how good does it feel
[1:34:12] when you lay down at night
[1:34:15] and you tell the lord how much you love
[1:34:17] him and how much it means to you
[1:34:19] and you go to drifting off and your
[1:34:22] alpha brain waves begin to change and
[1:34:23] then they'll go into that straight line
[1:34:25] and then going into the deeper sleep
[1:34:28] and you lose consciousness
[1:34:30] and it's such a wonderful thing to know
[1:34:33] as our sister that out in arkansas just
[1:34:36] sat down back in the recliner
[1:34:38] to take a little rest
[1:34:40] she got a little rest all right
[1:34:43] praise god
[1:34:45] if there's something that brother west
[1:34:46] we go home tonight we lay down
[1:34:48] our eyes are never open again in this
[1:34:50] mortal body
[1:34:51] but we've got an absolute
[1:34:53] we've got an absolute
[1:34:55] my absolute friends is not doctrines of
[1:34:57] this message
[1:34:59] don't you understand why i blessed that
[1:35:00] so much we are not going to be in
[1:35:03] eternity discussing serpent seed we are
[1:35:06] not going to be in eternity discussing
[1:35:08] the seven seals or the seven thunders
[1:35:10] what we're going to be doing in eternity
[1:35:13] is worshipping our lord god
[1:35:16] our savior our messiah
[1:35:18] our master
[1:35:19] this is why i don't understand people
[1:35:21] that don't want to worship him now i
[1:35:22] don't understand that i think what are
[1:35:24] they going to do for eternity
[1:35:28] ought to burst something in us
[1:35:30] that makes us want to love him and
[1:35:32] worship him
[1:35:34] with all of our hearts
[1:35:36] oh praise god
[1:35:40] lord jesus it
[1:35:42] makes us look about
[1:35:45] lord and we hear it
[1:35:47] from one to the other to the other
[1:35:51] lord our
[1:35:52] president told us
[1:35:54] just a little bit ago
[1:35:57] that if we would get vaccinated
[1:36:00] we would not
[1:36:02] we would
[1:36:04] not
[1:36:06] get covet
[1:36:09] but of course now we know
[1:36:11] that is not true
[1:36:13] and we truly want to give medical
[1:36:15] science
[1:36:16] they are learning as they go we know
[1:36:18] that
[1:36:19] and we will allow them that
[1:36:22] but which one do we believe this one
[1:36:24] says this and can scientifically prove
[1:36:26] it and this one says that
[1:36:28] oh god we're so grateful
[1:36:31] that we have something certain tonight
[1:36:34] our king
[1:36:35] our savior
[1:36:36] our resurrected lord
[1:36:39] and you left us your word
[1:36:41] to be able to lead us to that blessed
[1:36:43] place
[1:36:45] oh thank you heavenly father
[1:36:48] so in uncertain times
[1:36:50] we're so thankful that we have
[1:36:53] an absolute
[1:36:54] and that absolute will guide us
[1:36:57] so father i'm sure
[1:36:59] some of these here lord they're looking
[1:37:00] at various decisions in their life and
[1:37:02] they don't know what to do many of them
[1:37:04] trying to decide on this and decide on
[1:37:06] that
[1:37:07] we see the protest around america
[1:37:09] because of schools and lord i'm wanting
[1:37:11] to mandate our kids to wear them and
[1:37:13] scientists has not been able to really
[1:37:15] say will it damage their lungs would it
[1:37:17] hurt their lungs and some say oh it's
[1:37:19] crazy to say such a thing and others say
[1:37:21] no no it's legitimate we need to
[1:37:23] research this and check into it so there
[1:37:25] again it makes us uncertain
[1:37:28] oh jesus pull us up next to yourself
[1:37:31] would you lord
[1:37:32] during these troublesome times
[1:37:35] whisper into our ear and let us know
[1:37:38] you still love us
[1:37:40] you still care for us father
[1:37:42] thank you lord jesus
[1:37:45] father we're just asking you that you'd
[1:37:46] move for your children around the world
[1:37:49] lord this covet thing took us all
[1:37:51] totally by surprise
[1:37:53] we never ever saw anything like this
[1:37:56] would ever come
[1:37:57] and not just affect the population of
[1:37:59] the earth but affect
[1:38:01] all the churches and all your ministers
[1:38:03] there's not a minister lord hardly
[1:38:05] around the earth that i know
[1:38:07] that's not been affected by this thing
[1:38:08] or a church
[1:38:10] but yet you knew it lord
[1:38:12] is this all part of
[1:38:14] bringing a desperation to us
[1:38:18] you told us through your prophet that if
[1:38:20] we didn't get desperate we'd miss it
[1:38:24] and yet you told us
[1:38:26] we couldn't get desperate within
[1:38:27] ourselves
[1:38:29] so we're in a fix almost says that we're
[1:38:31] a catch-22 that we got to be desperate
[1:38:34] and we can't be desperate on our own
[1:38:37] but you sure know how to turn up the
[1:38:38] pressure to make us desperate
[1:38:41] so father i pray you'd help each of us
[1:38:43] lord
[1:38:44] in uncertain times
[1:38:46] that we can be so grateful when we lay
[1:38:49] down on our beds tonight that we can
[1:38:51] have a certainty in our hearts if
[1:38:53] there's anyone here or anyone under the
[1:38:55] sound of my voice it's heard this
[1:38:58] service it's not in the visible audience
[1:39:00] that those are not ready to meet you
[1:39:03] may they find that certainty
[1:39:05] that absolute vindication of the
[1:39:08] resurrection of the lord jesus in their
[1:39:11] life and the evidence will be they can
[1:39:14] say amen
[1:39:16] to every word of god
[1:39:18] they will let no one explain it away no
[1:39:20] one devalue it because they have been
[1:39:23] born by the breath of god himself
[1:39:26] oh jesus thank you for such an absolute
[1:39:29] and troublesome times
[1:39:31] father i pray for those
[1:39:33] lord we don't get one buried till we
[1:39:36] have just a few days and then another
[1:39:38] lord we still want to remember
[1:39:40] those that have lost loved ones lord the
[1:39:43] term lost you know what i mean when i
[1:39:45] say that father and our terms they're
[1:39:47] not lost when we know where they are
[1:39:49] but they're lost from our presence or
[1:39:51] away from our presence we know different
[1:39:54] ones are still grieving father we pray
[1:39:57] that you'd be with them
[1:39:59] comfort them with us lord them children
[1:40:01] them grandchildren widowers father
[1:40:04] oh jesus may your grace move upon each
[1:40:08] heart
[1:40:09] i was reminded today thinking about it
[1:40:13] it's similar as it been in ages gone by
[1:40:17] when the inquisitions was going on and
[1:40:19] the martyrdoms was taking place
[1:40:22] you veiled
[1:40:23] a gathering time of many of your
[1:40:25] children
[1:40:27] and you let them go under a martyrdom or
[1:40:29] an inquisition in spain or wherever it
[1:40:31] was
[1:40:33] this time
[1:40:34] you wanted to call a bunch of your
[1:40:36] children home
[1:40:37] and you veiled it or allowed them to go
[1:40:40] oh it looked like you think why in the
[1:40:42] world when the lord just let them go to
[1:40:43] sleep that's the way we're looking at it
[1:40:46] death to you is so different from us it
[1:40:48] doesn't really make any difference
[1:40:49] whether they go by covet or a car wreck
[1:40:51] or just go to sleep in a chair the bible
[1:40:54] says
[1:40:55] in your sight
[1:40:57] in your sight the death of your people
[1:41:00] of the saints is precious
[1:41:03] because they catch that taxi
[1:41:05] and they span that bridge
[1:41:07] and they're burst onto that theophany
[1:41:09] body
[1:41:10] oh lord god comfort every heart would
[1:41:12] you lord
[1:41:13] bring peace i pray father
[1:41:16] we love you jesus with all of our hearts
[1:41:19] thank you lord god
[1:41:21] i mean he loves him with all your heart
[1:41:23] can we just worship him a little bit
[1:41:25] before we go i know you got to work
[1:41:26] tomorrow and stuff but
[1:41:27] can we just worship him just a little
[1:41:29] bit
[1:41:30] but the door maybe and come sing that
[1:41:31] song about the storm that you sing
[1:41:35] be discouraged why should i be
[1:41:37] discouraged
[1:41:41] when you sung on this sermon you preach
[1:41:46] praise god for an anchor amen
[1:41:49] to know the gospel makes that certain
[1:41:51] sound that we can rest our souls on
[1:41:54] thank god that he in this hour we're
[1:41:56] living in such confusion and such
[1:41:57] uncertainty he has spoken to us friends

[1:43:00] the waters around them had troubled
[1:43:04] their mind
[1:43:06] with fear in their hearts
[1:43:09] they thought they might die
[1:43:12] but they failed to remember
[1:43:16] the master was not
[1:43:19] he spoke the words
[1:43:22] and the winds all stood still
[1:43:25] even the waters
[1:43:28] obeyed his will

[1:44:22] way seemed so dear

[1:44:28] to have my footsteps in here

[1:44:56] all i have to do
[1:44:58] is
