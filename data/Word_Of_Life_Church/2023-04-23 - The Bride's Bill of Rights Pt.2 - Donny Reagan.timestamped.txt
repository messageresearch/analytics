[42:33] time
[42:35] Jesus Christ
[42:46] [Music]
[42:47] Jesus Christ
[42:50] [Music]
[42:56] thank you
[43:02] praise the Lord
[43:04] what a great honor in our life to be
[43:07] able to worship Him and love him
[43:10] I know there's lots and lots of people
[43:12] that worship but yet we don't want to
[43:15] just worship we want Worship in spirit
[43:17] and Truth
[43:19] Saint John 4 of the Lord Jesus
[43:21] introduced something that had never been
[43:25] said and quite phrased the way that he
[43:28] did it and that was that the true
[43:30] worshipers would worship God in spirit
[43:33] and in truth which is totally impossible
[43:36] for the Jews to do all they had was the
[43:39] law the legal side
[43:41] so the spirit of the word they didn't
[43:43] even have it
[43:45] I think that God wanted to make a way
[43:47] that true worshipers would be able to
[43:50] come not only with the truth we want the
[43:53] truth right but also have the spirit of
[43:56] Truth this is something that people
[43:58] don't realize I think sometimes that
[44:00] both truths and error have spirits that
[44:04] motivate them
[44:05] so there's a spirit of Truth and there
[44:08] is a spirit of air if you ever talk to
[44:09] people before and you show them
[44:10] scriptures and you show them quotes and
[44:12] things like that and it seems like it
[44:14] makes no difference at all when you get
[44:17] done talking tom they believe exactly
[44:19] the same thing they did before you say
[44:22] why in the world can't you see that
[44:23] that's what the Bible says that thought
[44:25] the message says I know I know I know
[44:27] but I still believe this and this and
[44:29] this makes you feel so sorry for what
[44:31] does me
[44:32] because you realize that they're hearing
[44:34] the truth but they don't have the spirit
[44:36] of the truth that goes with it all let's
[44:40] let's just about here together and
[44:41] worship him a little bit
[44:43] Heavenly Father we
[44:45] are gathered here today with
[44:47] Thanksgiving in our heart and we're just
[44:49] so thankful Heavenly Father for all the
[44:52] many things that you've done for us we
[44:54] thank you forever trial that you and
[44:57] your wisdom allow to come our way we
[44:59] thank you Lord for the testings of life
[45:02] we thank you Lord Jesus that your people
[45:05] will be a tried people that will be far
[45:08] above rubies and gems and gold and
[45:11] things like that we know sometimes it
[45:13] might be difficult for us as we go
[45:15] through them Lord hearing from people
[45:17] around the world almost every day and
[45:19] prayer requests for this and that and
[45:21] some of them so desperate and so serious
[45:24] and you don't move form Lord there's no
[45:26] way for them to come out of it and yet
[45:28] we hear you move and you turn right
[45:30] around and turn that trial and that test
[45:32] into a testimony
[45:34] we're so thankful that we're serving a
[45:36] living God today
[45:38] we desire heavenly father as we come
[45:40] here to assemble ourselves together
[45:42] today set aside this Resurrection
[45:44] morning that we might be able to praise
[45:47] and adore and love and worship you but
[45:50] we come also Lord with needs desires and
[45:53] requests in our hearts Lord Jesus we're
[45:56] concerned of family members maybe
[45:58] friends or going through hard times or
[46:01] sick or whatever it is we also have our
[46:03] own needs today maybe some are standing
[46:05] here discouraged about many things of
[46:08] Life they don't know what they're going
[46:09] to do about this or that but we believe
[46:12] you're mindful of us so we're calling on
[46:14] Your Great Name we ask you today Father
[46:17] that you would help us help me that I
[46:19] can get out of the way Lord that I can
[46:21] just surrender among him and
[46:23] instrumentality to you you can use me I
[46:26] need you Lord Jesus although I've been
[46:28] doing this since I was just a boy of 18
[46:30] years old I still realize what a
[46:33] desperate thing it is for a man to stand
[46:36] and to say he's speaking on God's behave
[46:39] help me Father help me give me the words
[46:42] Lord Jesus of life
[46:45] speak to each heart today heal the sick
[46:47] encourage those that are weary granted
[46:50] father we pray in Jesus name
[46:53] amen watch it around just shake hands
[46:55] just so I tell them it's good to be in
[46:57] the house of the Lord
[47:00] hey man just move out of your place our
[47:02] little bit and just tell them it's it's
[47:03] good to be in the house of the Lord
[47:05] praise the Lord I'm just glad you're
[47:08] here
[47:09] I've heard people say well I'd rather be
[47:10] here and be in the jail
[47:13] my goodness you mean that's the best we
[47:15] can do
[47:16] you'd rather be here and be in prison
[47:18] right
[47:19] I'd rather be here than any place else I
[47:21] know of on earth except for heaven
[47:26] amen there is no better place I don't
[47:29] think for us to be able to be gathered
[47:30] together than the house of God
[47:33] let's turn today
[47:35] again to the Book of Mark if you would
[47:37] chapter 16. I want to speak to you again
[47:41] today the Lord helping us on the bride's
[47:45] Bill of Rights
[47:48] how many of you have looked this week on
[47:51] what your Bill of Rights is as far as
[47:53] naturally some of you probably stand
[47:54] there last week and you thought oh my
[47:56] goodness I'm an American citizen I don't
[47:58] even know what's mine anybody look
[48:00] none of you don't care okay all right
[48:02] all right
[48:04] okay so you don't even care my iPad here
[48:07] is kind of going crazy I've had one of
[48:09] the office mornings that ever was so I
[48:13] figure the Lord
[48:19] I got to church and realized I didn't
[48:21] have a belt on so
[48:24] call my son-in-law and have him drop me
[48:25] a belt by
[48:27] then I get up my iPad's going absolutely
[48:29] nuts so that's a really good sign
[48:34] also I'd like to announce today that
[48:36] Sister Kate bitten and brother Taylor
[48:39] Shockley got engaged this week so we
[48:42] want to wish them a congratulations
[48:50] Mark chapter 16 verse 17.
[48:54] and these signs might every now and then
[49:00] just in the apostolic age or in the
[49:03] first few years
[49:05] these signs shall follow them that
[49:09] believe
[49:10] in my name shall they cast out Devils
[49:13] they shall speak with new tongues
[49:16] they shall take up serpents if they
[49:18] drink any deadly thing it shall not harm
[49:21] them they shall lay their hands on the
[49:24] sick and they
[49:27] shall recover Luke chapter 10 verse 19.
[49:32] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[49:36] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[49:40] power of the enemy
[49:42] and nothing shall by any means
[49:46] hurt you and the church said amen amen
[49:50] God bless you you may be seated
[49:53] let me remind you again today of what
[49:56] your Bill of Rights is as far as an
[49:58] American citizen
[50:00] the Bill of Rights guarantees the
[50:01] liberty of the individual and Limits The
[50:03] Power of government and judicial and
[50:06] other proceedings
[50:08] the U.S Bill of Rights was ratified in
[50:12] 1791.
[50:14] and it guarantees among many other
[50:17] things the rights of free speech now
[50:20] this is the first amendment to the
[50:21] Constitution they later identified it as
[50:24] the Bill of Rights and this is what they
[50:27] wanted to call it so it was granted to
[50:29] us in
[50:30] 1791 freedom of speech freedom of
[50:34] religion and trial by jury there were
[50:38] initially 10 amendments in this and they
[50:42] called it the Bill of Rights since then
[50:45] since 1791 there have been 17 more
[50:50] amendments that's been added to that
[50:52] some states of course all states have to
[50:55] gather together have a ratification vote
[50:58] to be able to make it happen but as I
[51:00] begin to read this this week and I'm
[51:02] going to go through all 27 to tell you
[51:04] what they are but as I read what they
[51:07] were and I looked down at them and I
[51:10] thought how that they had progressed as
[51:13] we know whenever I our nation become
[51:16] separate from England and we had to
[51:18] fight in war and be able to get our
[51:21] Liberty then our founding fathers wanted
[51:24] to have a government that would be
[51:26] different than what it was in England
[51:28] they had under the power of the crown
[51:30] the king could do or clean pretty much
[51:33] whatever they wanted to do to the
[51:35] commonwealths or the constituents in
[51:37] their Kingdom but our fathers when they
[51:40] came here and they fought and they was
[51:42] able to establish a kingdom or a nation
[51:46] like this which had never been anything
[51:48] like it on the earth before I love it
[51:51] myself don't you
[51:52] well those of you that don't reckon you
[51:54] leave I mean you can go to Switzerland
[51:56] or somewhere but it to me it's it's one
[51:59] of the greatest Nations on the earth
[52:01] even in its darkness and the chaos
[52:03] that's around it and no doubt they
[52:06] thought it would never last because it
[52:08] was something that had never quite been
[52:11] seen But I personally believe it was the
[52:13] spirit of God that moved on our founding
[52:16] fathers and anointed them to be able to
[52:19] give us this which another Nation had
[52:21] never given to its peoples uh one reason
[52:24] I believe is because God knew the United
[52:27] States would be a principal part down
[52:31] Through the Ages from that time on
[52:33] especially ending up at the end time
[52:35] that the U.S would be a principal part
[52:38] an evangelization of the world
[52:41] especially with the message of the hour
[52:43] now God could have done whatever he
[52:45] wanted he could have chose Germany he
[52:47] could have chose France but yet one day
[52:49] whenever we look back and realize what a
[52:52] great part part that the United States
[52:54] has played in bringing the message of
[52:57] the hour now what brother random would
[52:59] have been in Ugandan or brother Branham
[53:01] would have been in Kenya now myself it
[53:03] wouldn't make no difference to me
[53:04] whether the man was black white pink or
[53:06] yellow was polka dot stripes on it it
[53:08] wouldn't make no difference to me
[53:09] because I personally have no problem
[53:11] with race I don't care what color a man
[53:13] is but yet God allowed this Prophet to
[53:16] be born out of this nation now we know
[53:19] that she's one of the most wealthy
[53:20] nations in the world and all the gross
[53:22] national product and all the things that
[53:24] are there she's not doing too good right
[53:26] now and we don't deaf as she's doing
[53:27] going down but if God would have allowed
[53:30] our Prophet to been born and some of the
[53:32] poorest Nations around the world so Dan
[53:35] which is now facing look like the major
[53:37] Corruption of a Civil War and even our
[53:40] embassies now having to be the people
[53:41] emptied out this very day and we know
[53:44] that this type of unrest has been of the
[53:47] third world countries so how would the
[53:49] message have ever gone out but God chose
[53:52] this nation now he didn't just choose
[53:55] her that she would be one of the most
[53:57] wealthy in all the world he didn't just
[53:59] cheers her so she would be able to
[54:01] dominate the world as a superpower and
[54:03] she's done that for many years although
[54:06] she's losing that image right now and
[54:08] our enemies well understand it but yet
[54:11] God chose her to me for a greater
[54:13] purpose than just the money and the
[54:16] wealth and the superiority that she
[54:19] would gain over the years but God had a
[54:21] purpose in this nation and being able to
[54:24] spread forth the gospel now we know that
[54:27] Wesley even coming from England but yet
[54:30] John Wesley come to the United States
[54:31] and got a great lot of influence and a
[54:34] great lot of learning of course because
[54:36] of the things that he went through so
[54:39] going back home then Wesley was able to
[54:41] take part of the American Experience
[54:43] back home with him and it helped
[54:46] finalize what the second work of Grace
[54:49] would be presented to the world again
[54:51] God could have chosen in England if he
[54:53] wanted to but God chose America now it
[54:57] to me it's not just a happenstance but
[54:59] God himself ordains that well now we
[55:02] know that the message has crossed the
[55:04] English Channel twice and God of course
[55:07] chose different parts of the world by
[55:09] which he would progress his truths and
[55:12] in the end time Satan moved his
[55:14] headquarters to the West the western
[55:17] side of our own nation which was of
[55:20] course from Hollywood now Satan would do
[55:23] that then Satan had a little bit of
[55:25] insight to what God was going to do now
[55:29] if Satan knew that God was going to have
[55:31] chosen Europe if God was going to have
[55:34] chosen Africa Asia whatever more to lead
[55:37] the world and the majority of the Gospel
[55:40] would come out of that I guarantee you
[55:42] Satan would be his headquarters it'll be
[55:44] set up today in Beijing or in Tokyo or
[55:47] wherever it was around the world why did
[55:50] Satan choose Hollywood why did Satan
[55:53] moved to the West Coast because somehow
[55:56] he had an insight into the Divine
[55:59] Providence of God that God was going to
[56:02] use this nation and from this nation
[56:05] would come the prophet of God but not
[56:08] only the prophet but years after he was
[56:11] gone but out of this nation God would
[56:14] use the churches and the ministry and
[56:18] even coming from Jeffersonville that out
[56:20] of there would spearhead not only the
[56:23] prophet himself but the prophet's
[56:26] message now how we thank God for the
[56:29] prophet himself but most of us never
[56:32] even got to see the man is that right so
[56:35] what do we hold on to the message that
[56:38] God gave the man well how do we know the
[56:41] message well thank god it's not just by
[56:44] Uncle so and so said so and so and my
[56:47] grandpa said so and so but God knew that
[56:51] it must be that the message would be put
[56:54] into book and to tape into MP3 into
[56:58] digital format I'm grateful for that
[57:00] myself now you know where a lot of this
[57:03] spearheaded from our own country a part
[57:06] of it our own church where did it come
[57:08] from a lot of those that if it would
[57:11] have been dependent on many of the
[57:13] brothers and sisters from the third
[57:15] world countries we would still be many
[57:18] many years behind which means a lot of
[57:21] us would be more spiritual regress than
[57:24] what we are because we have to have the
[57:27] word in order to feed on the word well
[57:30] I've got the Holy Ghost yeah and the
[57:32] Holy Ghost itself feeds on the word of
[57:35] the hour
[57:36] so we must have it so where does a lot
[57:39] of The Works come from now I don't know
[57:41] if you understand this or not but even
[57:43] in a lot of the conventions Around The
[57:45] World God has chosen to use a lot of
[57:48] American Brothers now that's not to to
[57:50] demoralize or to do away at all with any
[57:53] of the other brothers in the other parts
[57:54] of the world but for whatever reason God
[57:56] has chosen this place and to me had this
[58:00] nation been founded as a communistic
[58:03] country had it been founded as an
[58:06] imperialistic country or a country under
[58:08] a monarchy our restrictions of Liberty
[58:11] and tribal and so on could have been
[58:14] greatly affected so our founding fathers
[58:17] were led by the spirit of God you
[58:19] believe that I believe that God allowed
[58:22] them even with man government and
[58:25] Enterprise and I know you may not like
[58:27] it but let me tell you something I
[58:28] prefer it way way more than I would
[58:31] socialism and God knew there would have
[58:34] to be people around the message that he
[58:36] could bless financially that they would
[58:39] be able to help propagate the message so
[58:42] if all of us would have been people that
[58:45] just lived from hand to mouth as we say
[58:46] and we go from paycheck to paycheck that
[58:49] I wonder how far the message and the
[58:52] churches and books and so on and so on
[58:54] how far would it have reached around the
[58:57] world because a majority of us could
[58:59] have never done that so God actually
[59:01] allowed people that was pretty witty
[59:04] when it would come to business and they
[59:06] would be able to get out there and make
[59:07] all kinds of money but they wouldn't
[59:09] keep all of it for theirself but they
[59:12] would have a burden to be able to print
[59:14] and to be able to make mp3s and CDs and
[59:18] so on and so on and so on why because
[59:20] God wanted to get the message out to
[59:23] reach the bride around the world had it
[59:26] been in a nation where we could have not
[59:28] done that under Socialism or under some
[59:31] other type of control other than
[59:33] democracy then it could have been so
[59:36] hindered so the angels of the Lord when
[59:40] they go about manipulating over the top
[59:42] of the political schemes of Satan and
[59:45] then every age that he's always been
[59:47] there God ordained that our nation be
[59:50] birthed and founded on the principles of
[59:54] democracy I know we don't talk that much
[59:56] about it and y'all are probably thinking
[59:58] what in the world is wrong with brother
[1:00:00] Donnie that he's talking about democracy
[1:00:02] I want to open your eyes this morning
[1:00:04] you ought to thank God you live in a
[1:00:06] free Nation
[1:00:08] not only for your own Liberties and for
[1:00:10] your own freedoms but because of our
[1:00:13] freedoms and our liberties God has been
[1:00:16] able to use people from the east coast
[1:00:18] to the West Coast of this nation the
[1:00:20] North and the South to be able to
[1:00:22] propagate this truth in order to bring
[1:00:25] in the last sea now being friends with
[1:00:27] preachers around the world and when us
[1:00:30] preachers get together we will often say
[1:00:32] it this way that the last seed will be
[1:00:34] one of the most expensive Endeavors
[1:00:37] that's ever been accomplished on the
[1:00:39] face of the Earth because it will take
[1:00:41] such an Outreach to reach them in the
[1:00:44] darkest parts of Africa it will take the
[1:00:47] spirit of God and God may send one man
[1:00:49] over here and the trip May cost five
[1:00:51] thousand dollars another man over there
[1:00:53] and a trip May cost ten thousand they
[1:00:55] may not win words to Christ they may win
[1:00:58] one person one person in Sumatra whose
[1:01:01] name is on the Book of Life maybe a half
[1:01:04] a dozen in Indonesian some in Hong Kong
[1:01:06] and some here there and and there and if
[1:01:09] there was not people that God had
[1:01:11] blessed to be able to support the work
[1:01:13] we would never get out of here but thank
[1:01:16] God that he moved upon Thomas Edison
[1:01:19] John Quincy Adams a lot of our founding
[1:01:22] fathers thanked God for people like
[1:01:24] Daniel Boone and people like that that
[1:01:26] was able to blaze this oh we get in our
[1:01:29] car and drive across the Interstate we
[1:01:31] don't think nothing about these guys
[1:01:33] walking around but I'm grateful for
[1:01:35] every one of them that did it they
[1:01:37] risked their life now you believe
[1:01:39] whatever you want to believe I believe
[1:01:41] it was the spirit of God driving those
[1:01:43] men why were they not satisfied with 13
[1:01:46] colonies why were they not satisfied
[1:01:49] when they moved into 13 states why must
[1:01:52] they keep pushing pushing pushing I'm
[1:01:55] glad they pushed because there's some
[1:01:56] seed going to be in California there was
[1:01:59] some seed going to be in Arizona some
[1:02:01] seed in Utah some seed in Oregon some
[1:02:04] seed in Washington I'm glad you see
[1:02:06] God's people that really catch the
[1:02:09] vision of the hour they are always
[1:02:11] Visionaries among them and they're never
[1:02:14] satisfied with their little four walls
[1:02:16] and their little 25 or 30 and their
[1:02:19] congregation because they believe God is
[1:02:22] a god of the whole universe and that
[1:02:25] God's got people around everywhere and
[1:02:28] he wants to reach them well I don't know
[1:02:29] about you I still feel the same way
[1:02:31] today if God wants to reach out my
[1:02:34] brother Jack better than sitting here
[1:02:36] and been in some of their most remote
[1:02:38] parts of the world able to go out and
[1:02:41] preach the gospel paddle up and
[1:02:43] downstreams that would scare most of us
[1:02:45] to death but why would he do it because
[1:02:47] God ordained him and God gave him the
[1:02:51] ability and then God gave means
[1:02:53] financially of people that would be able
[1:02:55] to support it to carry it out thank God
[1:02:58] for our American Bill of Rights
[1:03:02] but let me say
[1:03:03] oh how grateful I am as a U.S citizen
[1:03:07] that I have the rights so far that I can
[1:03:10] stand here today and preach from the
[1:03:12] dictates of my heart you can sit there
[1:03:15] and say Amen to it is that right and yet
[1:03:18] there's many nations around the world
[1:03:21] that do not have this Liberty today they
[1:03:23] cannot do it the government will not
[1:03:25] allow it and yet many of them can be
[1:03:28] thrown in jail but thank God as for
[1:03:30] right now we still have these rights and
[1:03:32] as much as I love them but they would
[1:03:35] fail in comparison to compare to what
[1:03:38] the Lord God has given us as his people
[1:03:41] now not only are we saved and not only
[1:03:45] are we Sanctified but God has given us a
[1:03:49] Bill of Rights as we believe being the
[1:03:52] elect and the bride of Christ that
[1:03:54] supersedes Beyond just salvation oh how
[1:03:58] grateful we are for salvation how
[1:04:00] grateful we are for the power of the
[1:04:02] blood and the power of the Cross but yet
[1:04:05] we know it to a real elect member of the
[1:04:08] body of Christ that the cross is the
[1:04:11] bridge that takes you across the Gap and
[1:04:14] the cavern by which the mercy of God
[1:04:17] opens up as Paul said that there would
[1:04:19] be an entrance opened up now to many
[1:04:22] salvation is all they want that's as far
[1:04:25] as they will ever go will they be saved
[1:04:27] they will they will come up to the
[1:04:28] tribulation period they will be purged
[1:04:31] and the roads will be made clean and
[1:04:33] white washed of course by the person of
[1:04:35] the tribulation period but to the elect
[1:04:37] of God to Abraham's seed Abraham was
[1:04:41] never satisfied just living over in a
[1:04:44] poor land the land of the chaldees and
[1:04:46] the land of Earth and why not stay there
[1:04:48] why leave and walk all of them hundreds
[1:04:50] of miles remember he couldn't call an
[1:04:52] Uber he could not call you all to come
[1:04:55] and pick him up but the man must walk he
[1:04:57] must walk through difficulties and
[1:04:59] trials and tests as you and I must walk
[1:05:02] this thing will not be easy for us can
[1:05:05] we say Amen it will not be handed to us
[1:05:08] on a silver platter but you know what
[1:05:10] the people of God have never expected
[1:05:12] spiritual handouts they've never really
[1:05:15] expected everything to be handed to them
[1:05:18] on a silver platter but they are willing
[1:05:21] to fight for it they are willing to face
[1:05:23] hell they are willing to face opposition
[1:05:26] and trouble and sad times and resentment
[1:05:29] they're willing to go for whatever they
[1:05:32] have to go through in order to stand for
[1:05:34] Jesus Christ and his word anybody with
[1:05:37] me today
[1:05:38] I want you to think now if our father's
[1:05:41] been led by the spirit of God and you
[1:05:44] know for many years that they would set
[1:05:46] a seat there and when they signed the
[1:05:48] Declaration of Independence and they
[1:05:51] sent that chair there for who the Unseen
[1:05:54] guest almighty God oh what a time it was
[1:05:57] when they prayed what a time it was in
[1:06:00] our nation whenever they would begin the
[1:06:03] Congress and so on and so on even have
[1:06:05] it printed on our money so far in God we
[1:06:09] trust well for the most of those that
[1:06:11] that passes through their hand they
[1:06:12] don't even believe that in the first
[1:06:14] place because they don't even trust in
[1:06:16] God what surprised me eventually if they
[1:06:19] don't try to take it away but you know
[1:06:21] what that does not change our liberties
[1:06:24] as the people of God and I hope you
[1:06:27] understand what I'm fixing to say that
[1:06:28] really on our side in Christ's
[1:06:31] providential Army it is the conquered
[1:06:34] that's really the conquerors it's the
[1:06:38] conquer hurt that's the real conquerors
[1:06:41] on Satan's economy it's the conquerors
[1:06:45] that become the conquered it's the very
[1:06:49] opposite of what Christ says you see in
[1:06:51] order for us to be able to conquer in
[1:06:54] this day we ourselves must be conquered
[1:06:57] what do you mean brother Donnie we've
[1:06:58] got to be conquered by Christ himself
[1:07:00] but those out here in the world
[1:07:03] politicians preachers churches whatever
[1:07:05] more that are not conquered by the love
[1:07:08] of the Lord Jesus and the whole lives
[1:07:11] and beings given to him they themselves
[1:07:13] will be conquered by the Great conquer
[1:07:16] Christ oh I don't want him conquering me
[1:07:18] that way II Thessalonians tells us in
[1:07:21] the last day that he will come as a
[1:07:23] flaming sword will come out of his mouth
[1:07:25] John Simon Revelation 1 8 and the
[1:07:28] Sevenfold personage of his glory and
[1:07:31] there was a great sword as it was coming
[1:07:33] out of his mouth and with it he will
[1:07:35] slay the Nations I want to be slave it
[1:07:39] right now I want my nature my desires
[1:07:42] anything that's unlike the Lord Jesus
[1:07:45] anybody understands I want to be
[1:07:47] conquered by him now but I want to be
[1:07:49] conquered by his love I don't want to be
[1:07:52] conquered by his wrath you send the
[1:07:54] tribulation period Christ The Mighty
[1:07:57] conqueror will come again and he will
[1:07:59] conquer but he will not conquer by love
[1:08:02] but he will conquer by his own judgment
[1:08:05] and Justice I don't want that myself if
[1:08:08] you choose that it's up to you but I
[1:08:10] want the mercy of God so in that the
[1:08:13] Lord God unlike our founding fathers
[1:08:16] once the government had been established
[1:08:18] for a few years and they go from 1776 to
[1:08:21] 1791 then they begin to realize there
[1:08:24] were certain things that they left out
[1:08:26] of the original Constitution and they
[1:08:29] wanted to make sure because it's like
[1:08:31] they were learning as they went as our
[1:08:33] lawmakers still to this very day want to
[1:08:36] try to bring up amendments I'm not sure
[1:08:38] if you know it or not but there's
[1:08:39] actually been hundreds of amendments
[1:08:42] that comes before our Congress and the
[1:08:45] body of lawmakers and actually sometimes
[1:08:47] every year there will be a hundred or
[1:08:49] more that they will try to add to the
[1:08:52] Constitution now they still have the
[1:08:54] power you know to be able to amend the
[1:08:57] Constitution so they call it an
[1:08:59] amendment well you know since they have
[1:09:01] the power and our government is
[1:09:03] controlled by the devil and control for
[1:09:05] the most part by wicked men all they've
[1:09:08] got to do is make another amendment here
[1:09:10] and an amendment there and they make one
[1:09:12] and then they override the second one
[1:09:14] which is your right to bear arms or
[1:09:17] they'll make another amendment which
[1:09:19] will override your very first one which
[1:09:21] is the freedom of speech the freedom of
[1:09:24] religion come on now church so they have
[1:09:26] the power to amend to it but I'm so glad
[1:09:30] that our God didn't have to rethink his
[1:09:33] amendments I'm so glad that it didn't
[1:09:35] say well you know why I'm kind of
[1:09:36] learning a little bit more about these
[1:09:39] human beings I'm learning a little bit
[1:09:40] more about this situation so I think I'm
[1:09:43] kind of going to change my program I'm
[1:09:46] on how to make it a little bit different
[1:09:47] because now I realize laodicea is going
[1:09:50] to be so bad and it's going to be so
[1:09:52] indifferent I started my church out the
[1:09:54] way I wanted it but I realized I ain't
[1:09:57] going to work in the last days I'm going
[1:09:59] to have to make an amendment to my
[1:10:01] original clause and to my original Bill
[1:10:04] of Rights because really I sorted it out
[1:10:06] to be an Apostolic church I started out
[1:10:09] to where everybody would have the Holy
[1:10:11] Ghost but I realized that later to see
[1:10:13] it's going to be so bad I'm going to
[1:10:15] have to change all that and I I'm not
[1:10:17] going to have my sons to be able to
[1:10:18] preach on wholeness anymore because
[1:10:20] women won't want to live it and Men
[1:10:22] won't want to live it and it's going to
[1:10:23] be so bad and the power of the devil is
[1:10:25] going to be so strong that I'm just
[1:10:27] going to have to accept into my kingdom
[1:10:28] every liar ever drunk every hormone or
[1:10:31] ever Thief
[1:10:34] well that's the way a lot of people
[1:10:35] preach it today that God has lowered his
[1:10:38] standards God ain't Lord his we lowered
[1:10:42] ours
[1:10:44] we'll praise the Lord
[1:10:46] so with our Bill of Rights then there
[1:10:50] are guarantees that come with it but
[1:10:53] there's also of course responsibilities
[1:10:54] and there's also a knowledge that is
[1:10:57] required of us so if someone comes
[1:11:00] against us and the government tries to
[1:11:02] pursue us and they want to bring uh you
[1:11:04] know us as before Jerry or court trial
[1:11:06] or whatever more it would pay us to know
[1:11:09] our rights you agree with me so what if
[1:11:12] then the enemy our enemy Satan himself
[1:11:14] he tries to attack us on our bill of
[1:11:18] divine rights but yet we don't know
[1:11:21] what's in it so what's mine well I don't
[1:11:24] know I mean I'm a Christian so isn't
[1:11:25] that enough no if that's all you'll know
[1:11:28] he will exalt what he knows above what
[1:11:31] you know and he'll take what's
[1:11:33] rightfully yours away from you
[1:11:36] so don't you say well you just make
[1:11:38] common sense for us as the people of God
[1:11:40] to want to know what is ours so whenever
[1:11:44] the enemy or may I say the government of
[1:11:48] Satan wants to come against us now you
[1:11:50] realize that these things were set up
[1:11:52] and ratified so that our government
[1:11:54] would be under control this is why of
[1:11:56] course it is divided into the three
[1:11:58] branches instead of having a monarchy
[1:12:00] like a king So a king was over the money
[1:12:02] he was over the judicial system he was
[1:12:04] over a bit of it but our fathers wanted
[1:12:07] to break it up into three separate
[1:12:09] dominions or bodies and they would have
[1:12:12] checks and balances by which they would
[1:12:14] check out each one so the presidential
[1:12:16] aspect can only go so far the executive
[1:12:19] branch Congress controls the prosperous
[1:12:22] strings and boy they ain't doing a very
[1:12:24] good job with it are they them strengths
[1:12:25] is way out of hell and then we've got
[1:12:27] the judicial side of it so each one of
[1:12:30] them checks out the other well most of
[1:12:32] us we just say here today we don't show
[1:12:34] what our rights are and we're saying
[1:12:35] well if I ever get trouble I guess I'll
[1:12:37] Google it I guess I'll look at it I
[1:12:39] guess I'll do that well you know in the
[1:12:41] natural sense that might hold you over
[1:12:43] now hopefully you'll none of you will
[1:12:45] ever have to look up your Bill of Rights
[1:12:48] and you'll never be prosecuted in a
[1:12:50] wrong way but I wonder how many people
[1:12:52] in America are done so every year
[1:12:56] framed oh brother Donnie with him in a
[1:12:58] free Nation free from what look around
[1:13:01] friends our nation is busted our nation
[1:13:04] is more divided than it's ever been our
[1:13:07] nation is at War within itself our
[1:13:10] enemies perceive it our enemies look at
[1:13:13] Korea looking around look at China look
[1:13:16] at what they're doing what's it a sign
[1:13:18] of a weak leader in the White House and
[1:13:22] wickedness and among the nation itself
[1:13:24] my goodness here we go but yet I would
[1:13:27] like the devil to know as long as I'm
[1:13:30] here as your pastor I want a group of
[1:13:33] people here who know their rights as
[1:13:36] children of God
[1:13:41] I want you to be able to know that if
[1:13:44] sickness comes your way that you'll be
[1:13:46] able to know you have a god-given right
[1:13:50] to be able to call for the Elders of the
[1:13:52] church and they can lay hands on you and
[1:13:55] you will be delivered that if oppression
[1:13:59] comes your way that you know you have a
[1:14:02] right I don't have to live this way I
[1:14:05] don't have to live sad all of my life I
[1:14:08] don't have to live down depressed and
[1:14:10] weary I can have joy in the midst of
[1:14:13] trouble I can be happy even in the
[1:14:16] middle of the biggest test I've ever
[1:14:18] been through in my life
[1:14:22] you know it's the people of God if we do
[1:14:25] not know our rights Satan will push us
[1:14:28] around as the prophet said it over and
[1:14:30] over again that we live so far beneath
[1:14:34] our god-given privileges he called it
[1:14:37] and what is a privilege a privilege is a
[1:14:39] right when it becomes endorsed now you
[1:14:42] see it's part of our inalienable rights
[1:14:46] as American citizen now you may not even
[1:14:48] if you have some type of legal situation
[1:14:50] you may not be able to even afford an
[1:14:53] attorney and you couldn't go down there
[1:14:54] and get some guy in Elizabethton or some
[1:14:56] in Johnson City but if you cannot afford
[1:14:59] one in your Bill of Rights there is a
[1:15:03] provision for you to be able to have
[1:15:06] legal representation well you see I
[1:15:09] could not afford an attorney that would
[1:15:12] go before the presence of almighty God
[1:15:15] for me I couldn't afford one neither
[1:15:17] could you that was not enough money
[1:15:19] there was not enough merits there was
[1:15:21] nothing I could ever do or you could
[1:15:24] ever do to be able to get an attorney so
[1:15:27] the court appointed me one the Divine
[1:15:31] Court in heaven aborted me an attorney
[1:15:34] who was it the judge himself became our
[1:15:38] attorney so he knew we would never be
[1:15:42] able to have a way to stand against the
[1:15:44] powers of Darkness so he come to the
[1:15:46] Earth in order to become our attorney
[1:15:49] that he could set us free from the
[1:15:51] bondage of sin praise the Lord and then
[1:15:54] after that he didn't sit down and stop
[1:15:57] and say okay now I've saved you all
[1:15:59] y'all just try to go through life as
[1:16:01] best you can and you'll struggle here
[1:16:02] and there and don't call on me because
[1:16:04] I'm really busy I'm making a lot of
[1:16:06] streets of gold and I'm making Gates
[1:16:08] apparel and I got a lot of things to do
[1:16:10] up here in heaven but you understand the
[1:16:12] gates of pearl have already been home
[1:16:14] the streets have gone now according to
[1:16:16] what the prophet tells us in 1965 before
[1:16:19] he left the Earth the gates of pearl had
[1:16:22] already been created streets of gold had
[1:16:25] already been made and actually the
[1:16:28] inhabitants of that City the angels of
[1:16:31] God are awaiting breathlessly for us as
[1:16:35] the people of God to come into that
[1:16:37] place so it's not like that he's there
[1:16:39] still working on the city apparently
[1:16:41] according to what the prophet saw it
[1:16:43] must have already been done so it's been
[1:16:45] done since 1965. praise the Lord and
[1:16:49] it's been waiting for you and I as the
[1:16:52] people of God now think whatever the
[1:16:54] Lord God called us to himself that he
[1:16:57] wanted to equip us now how many of you
[1:16:59] kids spent all your school years in the
[1:17:01] first grade
[1:17:05] huh
[1:17:07] I mean some of you wasn't 17 years old
[1:17:09] and still in the first grade wow
[1:17:12] well why would we want to do that
[1:17:14] spiritually
[1:17:16] why would we want to grow no further in
[1:17:19] the knowledge of God why would we be
[1:17:22] totally satisfied and just talking about
[1:17:25] the blood and we're saved and we're
[1:17:27] saved and we're saying hey I've been
[1:17:29] saved most of my life but I need more
[1:17:32] than that to be able to fight the devil
[1:17:34] I've got to know my rights somebody help
[1:17:38] me to know what my rights are what's
[1:17:41] given to me as a Believer just salvation
[1:17:44] alone so I hunker down and let the devil
[1:17:47] kick me and stalk me and treat me like a
[1:17:50] piece of trash and then I waste your my
[1:17:53] whole life and I die and I saw off into
[1:17:55] heaven so that's what salvation done for
[1:17:58] me salvation purchased me from the
[1:18:01] devil's hand and then he leaves me on
[1:18:03] the side of the road as it was being a
[1:18:05] homeless child of God an aimless child
[1:18:08] of God a child of God with no motive a
[1:18:11] child of God with no purpose a child of
[1:18:14] God but no desire to never move one step
[1:18:17] further than just getting saved I'm
[1:18:20] sorry but that's not who I am well no
[1:18:23] I'm not sorry either I am called of God
[1:18:25] to venture off my brother Donnie you're
[1:18:27] an old man you don't have to tell me
[1:18:29] that I know that already but I'm
[1:18:31] wondering right now how much more higher
[1:18:34] Heights there is for me in Christ Jesus
[1:18:36] I wonder how much more by the Harvard
[1:18:39] that we can understand by the grace of
[1:18:41] God anybody with me
[1:18:43] how many once more
[1:18:46] you know what that proves there's more
[1:18:48] for you
[1:18:51] let us go to some of our rights this
[1:18:53] morning Matthew chapter 3 verse 11.
[1:18:57] notice what the Bible says here I indeed
[1:19:01] John the Baptist baptize you with water
[1:19:02] into repentance but he that cometh after
[1:19:05] me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm
[1:19:08] not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you
[1:19:12] with the Holy Ghost and West ashes
[1:19:19] oh okay so we we don't practice Ash
[1:19:21] Sunday here
[1:19:24] we practice fire Sunday
[1:19:26] fire Wednesday fire Monday in the youth
[1:19:29] service fire Thursday on the youth
[1:19:32] service we don't practice ashes we want
[1:19:35] fire
[1:19:37] what is Isis it's a sign of World fire
[1:19:40] was well my grandpa told me how they
[1:19:43] used to do this and that my mother told
[1:19:45] me they used to have a move of God but
[1:19:47] that ain't going to do us no good well I
[1:19:50] remember boy boy I remember when I was a
[1:19:53] little boy we used to have a fire we
[1:19:55] don't believe in Ash Sunday we want fire
[1:19:58] here at our church now is this our right
[1:20:03] you answer me is this our right
[1:20:08] do we want our children to have the same
[1:20:12] Holy Ghost and Fire that fell on the day
[1:20:16] of Pentecost or do we want them just to
[1:20:19] have an ash experience
[1:20:23] I don't he shall baptize you with the
[1:20:26] Holy Ghost and with fire so it's going
[1:20:29] to be something that's going to baptize
[1:20:31] you in to a Dynamo of fire that fire was
[1:20:35] in you will motivate you it will clean
[1:20:38] you it will keep you all praise the Lord
[1:20:40] notice Saint John 14 16 I will pray the
[1:20:44] father and he shall give you another
[1:20:46] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:20:50] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:20:54] the world cannot receive now if there's
[1:20:57] a sinner here in the building today we
[1:20:59] certainly welcome you to the service and
[1:21:01] we will offer if you need prayer we'll
[1:21:03] certainly do that for you that you can
[1:21:05] receive Christ as your savior but what
[1:21:08] Jesus is talking about here brother Paul
[1:21:10] is not that a sinner can come up and
[1:21:13] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:15] Jesus said the world cannot receive this
[1:21:18] but the sinner comes up and receives
[1:21:21] Christ as safe your repentance and then
[1:21:25] he's baptized for remission of sin then
[1:21:27] that makes him a candidate for the right
[1:21:30] of the indwelling presence of God God
[1:21:33] will not get in a sinner's heart so the
[1:21:36] sinner must be saved Sanctified baptized
[1:21:41] amen and then God wants to come in him
[1:21:45] now listen he says but ye know him now
[1:21:49] he tells us why the world cannot receive
[1:21:51] it too because it sees him not neither
[1:21:53] know it's him but ye know him for he
[1:21:56] dwelleth with you which was the Lord
[1:21:58] Jesus and shall be in you now he's going
[1:22:02] to change from the son of man form to
[1:22:04] the Son of God for him which is the
[1:22:06] spirit Holy Spirit notice I will not
[1:22:09] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:22:13] so here is our comforter Saint John 16
[1:22:15] 13. how be it when he the spirit of
[1:22:18] Truth is come he will guide you into
[1:22:21] just enough truth to get you saved and
[1:22:24] then all the rest are true so it won't
[1:22:25] really matter
[1:22:29] all truth so every person who truly has
[1:22:32] the Holy Ghost will have a hunger for
[1:22:36] Ultras
[1:22:40] he will guide you into all Truth for he
[1:22:43] shall not speak of himself but
[1:22:45] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:22:47] speak and he will show you things to
[1:22:50] come again Acts 2 38. then Peter said
[1:22:54] unto them repent and be baptized every
[1:22:57] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:59] for the remission of sins and you
[1:23:03] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:07] now is this a right
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:11] well I'm not sure it's for me now you
[1:23:14] know what you're allowing you're
[1:23:15] allowing your enemy to talk you out of
[1:23:19] your right to the Holy Ghost
[1:23:21] well I'm not good enough that's not what
[1:23:24] he said well I've done a lot of things
[1:23:26] wrong he knew that the first part of
[1:23:28] that verse covers what you've done wrong
[1:23:30] the first part of that verse covers
[1:23:33] being born in sin it covers your lying
[1:23:35] it covers all that sort of thing and
[1:23:37] then the first part of the verse opens
[1:23:39] up a way for the second part of the
[1:23:42] verse that you can receive the gift of
[1:23:45] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:46] you know brother Brown talks about it
[1:23:48] there tonight actually had the service
[1:23:49] in 1959 on the Holy Ghost series and he
[1:23:53] talked about his sister Dolores and how
[1:23:55] that she went up to pray and pray
[1:23:57] praying at home and she's telling her
[1:23:58] brother Brandon about you know when
[1:24:00] she'd go to pray for the Holy Ghost how
[1:24:02] she'd get tired if she'd get sleepy or
[1:24:04] all kinds of things would happen what he
[1:24:06] said well that's the devil that's the
[1:24:08] devil trying to stop you now we do not
[1:24:10] believe we have to come to an altar and
[1:24:12] tarry as we say all it takes is Us
[1:24:16] opening our heart and the spirit of God
[1:24:18] getting everything out of the way and
[1:24:20] you acknowledging anything that's wrong
[1:24:22] in your life so the Holy Ghost can fill
[1:24:25] you how long do I just say there brother
[1:24:27] Donnie 10 days five days five minutes
[1:24:29] would be a long time if you really read
[1:24:31] it
[1:24:32] you understand it don't take God five
[1:24:34] minutes to give you the Holy Ghost it
[1:24:36] don't take him a minute as long as he
[1:24:38] comes to and expects the boxcar and he
[1:24:41] sees that everything is laid out of the
[1:24:43] way and then he fills us with the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost pulls the door down slams itself
[1:24:48] puts the seal on the door and says
[1:24:50] you're good to go boy you're good to go
[1:24:52] girlfriend get right on to Heaven you're
[1:24:54] good all the rest of the journey
[1:24:57] but yeah I wonder how many of our people
[1:24:59] sitting here today and they don't feel
[1:25:01] like they have the Holy Ghost well why
[1:25:03] well I've tried and I've tried and I've
[1:25:05] tried I get so discouraged it's your
[1:25:07] right so what if you stand outside and
[1:25:09] the police officer stands out aside I'll
[1:25:11] tell you what you would send their
[1:25:12] worship and God you ain't allowed to do
[1:25:14] that well according to who sir according
[1:25:16] to me I say you can't do it so you're
[1:25:18] going to say well okay I won't come back
[1:25:19] to church no more all right well I don't
[1:25:21] worship no more or are you going to
[1:25:23] stand there and say you know what our
[1:25:24] pastor just told us about the
[1:25:26] ratification of the Bill of Rights I see
[1:25:28] about American citizen I know what my
[1:25:31] rights are as a matter of fact if you
[1:25:33] tell me I can't worship I think I'll
[1:25:35] turn right around and go back in and
[1:25:37] just go ahead and scream and holler
[1:25:38] right now to prove to you I know this is
[1:25:42] my rights and this is my church and this
[1:25:46] is my Lord Jesus and it is my time to
[1:25:49] worship
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] or would you get in your car and say
[1:25:54] well that policeman told me I couldn't
[1:25:56] do it I mean he's a policeman he had a
[1:25:58] 9mm stuck on his side he had a badge on
[1:26:00] he had a bulletproof vest he had a fancy
[1:26:03] cap on top of his head I mean his
[1:26:05] clothes was just armed decreasing the
[1:26:06] British leg he out of one of them cop
[1:26:08] cars there's a real siren and a real
[1:26:10] horn and everything I don't care how
[1:26:11] real it is your own Bill of Rights tells
[1:26:15] you that you have a right to freedom of
[1:26:17] religion look if you want to believe
[1:26:19] Humpty Dumpty is God the American Bill
[1:26:22] of Rights gives you that right you've
[1:26:24] got it right as an American citizen if
[1:26:26] you want to preach Humpty Dumpty is
[1:26:28] coming for you the second time that's up
[1:26:30] to you a policeman cannot stop you how
[1:26:32] much more should we as the people of God
[1:26:34] we're not preaching a bunch of fables
[1:26:37] we're not preaching a bunch of Disney
[1:26:38] makeup but we're preaching the word of
[1:26:41] God that God himself has proven over and
[1:26:45] over again should not we as the people
[1:26:48] of God stand shoulder to shoulder and
[1:26:51] say it is I right to worship God it is
[1:26:54] our right to live for him it is our
[1:26:57] right to be the saints of God it is my
[1:27:01] right to be his bride everybody
[1:27:07] oh my goodness I wonder how far this
[1:27:10] promise goes then
[1:27:12] verse 39. for the promise
[1:27:15] is unto you
[1:27:18] and two
[1:27:21] ah
[1:27:24] as many even as many as the Lord our God
[1:27:31] shall call
[1:27:33] how many of us called by God
[1:27:35] ah you've got to write to the Holy Ghost
[1:27:42] but you'll fight discouragement you'll
[1:27:44] fight weakness you'll fight all kinds of
[1:27:46] things but you got to keep on hammering
[1:27:48] and then believe it they will not move
[1:27:51] out of your way just because you say
[1:27:53] I've got a promise it's in my Bill of
[1:27:56] Rights and you think the devil is just
[1:27:57] going to swoon
[1:28:02] you think the devil's just going to grab
[1:28:04] his kerchief and rub his brow and say oh
[1:28:08] I'm Blown Away
[1:28:10] they have told me their bride oh demons
[1:28:15] let's go back to Hell let's just go back
[1:28:17] down and leave them alone because now
[1:28:20] that knucklehead preacher stood up there
[1:28:22] and told them they've got a Bill of
[1:28:24] Rights and they say now because he's
[1:28:26] told them they're going to turn hell
[1:28:28] upside down no we know better than that
[1:28:31] we know we'll fight to do it but we are
[1:28:34] going to turn hell upside down we just
[1:28:37] ain't going to do it in a day but we
[1:28:39] will do it as a matter of fact I'd like
[1:28:41] to remind the devil today when he exists
[1:28:44] no more we will still be shouting and
[1:28:46] praising God through eternity when there
[1:28:49] is no more cancer when there is no more
[1:28:52] sadness or depression when there is no
[1:28:55] more discouragement you and I will
[1:28:58] always be in the presence of God but
[1:29:01] it's because we stood for our rights
[1:29:04] down here
[1:29:07] notice women in Ephesians 1 13. in whom
[1:29:11] you also trusted at you that you heard
[1:29:14] now watch watch the the Divine protocol
[1:29:17] of the new birth
[1:29:19] and whom you also trusted actor that you
[1:29:21] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:29:25] your salvation in whom also after that
[1:29:30] you believed you were sealed with the
[1:29:33] Holy Spirit promised oh my goodness you
[1:29:35] mean you didn't get it when you believed
[1:29:38] you understand that makes the majority
[1:29:40] of Christian preachers today false
[1:29:44] subscribe
[1:29:46] because they teach their people they got
[1:29:48] it when they believe that's not the way
[1:29:50] Paul believed it this is all right
[1:29:52] brother Joel Brown this is our
[1:29:55] inalienable right to have it just like
[1:29:58] this
[1:29:59] that's our young people believe after
[1:30:02] whoever's here today believes then you
[1:30:04] have a right to the Holy Ghost it's your
[1:30:07] inalienable right oh thank God well let
[1:30:11] me just go ahead and bring down one more
[1:30:13] I've got time for another one
[1:30:15] there's one right here that's a very
[1:30:17] controversial right
[1:30:19] uh and I understand why because Satan
[1:30:23] would love to make a mimic of Christ's
[1:30:26] Church but it's the right to be like the
[1:30:31] original Church
[1:30:35] because like begets like
[1:30:39] so it is our right to have Word of Life
[1:30:43] Church to be and the pattern of the
[1:30:47] original church and Acts 2.
[1:30:51] and they believe it
[1:30:53] notices from the church age book I know
[1:30:55] you're familiar Lewis an unchanging God
[1:30:58] but unchanging ways what he did at the
[1:31:01] first he will have to keep on doing
[1:31:04] until it is done for the last time how
[1:31:08] many believes that
[1:31:09] so once God ever started in the
[1:31:12] dispensation of Grace dealing with the
[1:31:15] first human being out to the Cross then
[1:31:18] God has to deal with every other human
[1:31:20] being from that stand of time right
[1:31:23] there in 33 A.D on up to 2050 2075 21 30
[1:31:28] 28 90. however far it goes as long as
[1:31:32] the apostolic age is going on God has to
[1:31:35] deal with every one of them the exact
[1:31:37] same way if they are part of his body
[1:31:41] now if they are a church then that's a
[1:31:44] different category at all for sure
[1:31:46] notice this he says oh my when God did
[1:31:50] it the first time you let's keep on
[1:31:52] doing until the last time there will
[1:31:54] read it
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:59] though well
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:03] why do message people
[1:32:06] want to change
[1:32:08] that's a shame it taught years ago
[1:32:10] denominations to be the only one that
[1:32:12] wanted but not anymore a lot of our
[1:32:14] message folks want to change it
[1:32:17] which is so sad so surprising really
[1:32:20] because Satan knows that there's a word
[1:32:23] that is returned the face back to the
[1:32:26] original Apostolic fathers you see we
[1:32:29] must be Tried by that word after we've
[1:32:32] been restored
[1:32:34] we could not be faithful bride if we're
[1:32:36] not or you sound like they're going to
[1:32:37] say oh I believe it then the Lord Jesus
[1:32:39] so as soon as every member believes it
[1:32:41] I'll take him out of here oh no they'll
[1:32:43] believe it and then they'll be tried to
[1:32:46] say if they still believe it after the
[1:32:48] trial
[1:32:49] well praise the Lord I'm going to be
[1:32:51] found standing sin I still believe the
[1:32:53] same thing
[1:32:54] I still believe now notice there will
[1:32:56] never be a change apply that to the
[1:32:58] church ages the kind of man that God
[1:33:01] chose for the first church age and how
[1:33:03] God manifested in that man's Ministry
[1:33:05] would be the example of all other ages
[1:33:09] what God did in the first church age he
[1:33:12] wants to do in all other ages and that
[1:33:15] includes ours
[1:33:17] now we know exactly from the word which
[1:33:20] was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the
[1:33:22] first or the original church was founded
[1:33:25] how that God manifested himself in her
[1:33:27] the word can't change or be changed
[1:33:31] because the word is God
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:36] thus what the church was at Pentecost
[1:33:42] is the standard
[1:33:45] this is the pattern there is no other
[1:33:50] pattern
[1:33:52] glorious no matter what the scholars say
[1:33:57] now on the church age book was written
[1:33:59] there wasn't heard any message callers
[1:34:02] but it was all Baptist Methodist Church
[1:34:04] Christ Church of God and all that sort
[1:34:05] of say but now we've been around so long
[1:34:08] with the message that we've got message
[1:34:11] Scholars
[1:34:14] now what is a scholar it's a person who
[1:34:16] studies and studies and applies
[1:34:18] themselves and studies the word so now
[1:34:20] we've got message Scholars saying what
[1:34:23] the denominational Scholars said in
[1:34:27] 1965. I'll tell you one thing I sure
[1:34:30] hate to know that was my identification
[1:34:31] I'm lined up with lining up with
[1:34:33] denominational preachers
[1:34:35] well praise the Lord call me Pentecost
[1:34:37] if you want to I'd rather be called
[1:34:38] death in church Christ
[1:34:42] than an anti-word
[1:34:46] discussed now he says there is no other
[1:34:49] pattern my mama God so then manifested
[1:34:53] himself and there's no other pattern God
[1:34:56] has not changed the pattern what God did
[1:34:58] at Pentecost says to keep right I don't
[1:35:00] do until the age is closed though the
[1:35:03] scholars may tell you the apostolic age
[1:35:07] is over
[1:35:11] what
[1:35:13] don't believe it ah don't believe it
[1:35:17] such a statement is wrong on two
[1:35:20] accounts first of all it is wrong to
[1:35:22] suppose that there aren't any more
[1:35:23] Apostles just because the original 12
[1:35:26] are dead an apostle means a sent one and
[1:35:30] there are many sent once a day but
[1:35:32] they're called missionaries as long as
[1:35:35] men are being called and sent forth with
[1:35:37] the word of
[1:35:40] there is
[1:35:42] an Apostolic age
[1:35:48] you mean right here today
[1:35:50] in April 2023
[1:35:54] there is an Apostolic age
[1:35:57] going on
[1:35:58] how many of us glad to be Apostolic I
[1:36:01] told my denomination on that I'm talking
[1:36:04] about original
[1:36:05] Apostolic Doctrine
[1:36:08] praise the Lord as long as men are being
[1:36:11] called and send for us with a Word of
[1:36:13] Life there is an Apostolic age going on
[1:36:15] secondly they refer to an age of
[1:36:18] manifested holy ghost power has been
[1:36:21] over since the Bible has been completed
[1:36:24] this is untrue now of course a lot of
[1:36:27] the message callers they say well you
[1:36:29] know what God can't do it no more
[1:36:31] because brother Branham in here oh I
[1:36:33] guess I didn't realize Hebrews 13 8 was
[1:36:35] brother Branham
[1:36:37] I thought Hebrews 13 8 was Jesus my bad
[1:36:40] I guess huh oh I thought that's what my
[1:36:43] Bible said here I've been reading the
[1:36:44] scripture for almost all of my life and
[1:36:46] I thought my Bible said Jesus Christ the
[1:36:50] same yesterday today and forever not
[1:36:52] William Branham not on the Neville not
[1:36:55] Paul not Peter not James but Jesus
[1:36:57] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:37:00] forever
[1:37:03] notice he said there's not one scripture
[1:37:06] that suggests but many conclusively
[1:37:09] state otherwise yours are proof both of
[1:37:12] these charges are false oh
[1:37:16] so now he relates to this to being a
[1:37:18] charge
[1:37:20] so someone is standing here making a
[1:37:24] charge like a legal statement
[1:37:29] so you all if you worship
[1:37:32] if you sing if you clap your hands and
[1:37:35] your pastor prays for people and they
[1:37:38] shout and some of them may even fall out
[1:37:41] you all are a bunch of Pentecostals
[1:37:45] and you know Donnie Reagan has always
[1:37:48] been a Pentecostal
[1:37:51] it's a matter of fact one of the great
[1:37:52] leaders of the message years ago said
[1:37:54] that I was the greatest enemy that the
[1:37:57] message had
[1:37:59] I thought no I wouldn't look at you send
[1:38:01] me the message had I was one of the
[1:38:04] greatest enemies the devil ever had
[1:38:07] how many wants to be one of them how
[1:38:10] many wants to be an enemy to the devil
[1:38:13] do it oh all your sense because she was
[1:38:16] in Pentecost oh no let me tell you
[1:38:18] something if I what I saw in Pentecost
[1:38:21] that I see some real stuff yes I did but
[1:38:23] I also saw the office bunch of false
[1:38:25] stuff it ever was and I don't want none
[1:38:27] of that I don't want none of that that
[1:38:29] was off the word but that is only a
[1:38:32] Satan trying to make a scarecrow to put
[1:38:35] in front of people and you know as well
[1:38:37] as I know all it takes is two three
[1:38:40] people in a church and you watch them
[1:38:42] get in the flesh a little bit and get
[1:38:44] out of the way and it will hinder the
[1:38:46] move of God because others will sit
[1:38:48] there and say oh no oh no oh no you mean
[1:38:50] you are going to let somebody with an
[1:38:53] overzealous desire hinder you from
[1:38:56] worshiping god brother Donnie have you
[1:38:58] ever seen people in the flesh yep I sure
[1:39:00] have I've seen them get in the flesh
[1:39:02] I've seen them do things they shouldn't
[1:39:04] have done but the prophet of God said
[1:39:06] he'd rather have a little bit of
[1:39:08] wildfire than no fire at all if you've
[1:39:12] got Wildfire you can't aim it down but
[1:39:15] if you ain't got nothing but ashes
[1:39:21] you know what you do when you blow on
[1:39:23] ashes you blow them away
[1:39:27] foreign
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:34] well I'd rather not get in the flesh
[1:39:37] honey I hate to be the one to tell you
[1:39:40] but you've been in the flesh since the
[1:39:42] day you took your breath
[1:39:44] I'm worried about getting out of it not
[1:39:45] getting in it
[1:39:48] oh well I'll tell you one thing I've
[1:39:50] seen some of the people and I've been
[1:39:52] streaming some of the services here and
[1:39:54] there and down Lord have mercy them
[1:39:56] people screaming holding them people
[1:39:58] down to use Camp they was jumping in a
[1:40:00] shouting somebody told me they even had
[1:40:02] speaking in tongues going on down there
[1:40:04] yeah I was on a block and I do not
[1:40:07] apologize I do not apologize that God
[1:40:10] heal the sick I do not apologize that
[1:40:13] God changed the life of some of those
[1:40:16] young people I do not apologize that God
[1:40:19] gave some of them the Holy Ghost I do
[1:40:21] not apologize that lives were changed or
[1:40:24] some of them in the flesh yes they were
[1:40:27] but at least they were worship Him and
[1:40:29] they didn't think they was in the casket
[1:40:36] some people come to church and they're
[1:40:37] like an Egyptian
[1:40:42] they're mummified
[1:40:48] any y'all ever seen them mummies up
[1:40:49] close man you talking about a pitiful
[1:40:51] deal I don't scan three or four thousand
[1:40:54] years old laying there oh my goodness
[1:40:57] standing there holding their scepter or
[1:40:58] whatever War just laying there like that
[1:41:00] they ain't gotta move about them at all
[1:41:02] it reminds me of some of these dead
[1:41:04] dried Church of God my church members
[1:41:07] that ain't got no move of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:09] they ain't fell a chill in 30 years they
[1:41:12] ain't felt a twitch they ain't felt
[1:41:14] nothing my goodness inside to the night
[1:41:16] that God's saved and they want to point
[1:41:18] their finger at somebody that's trying
[1:41:20] to do something for God why was somebody
[1:41:22] who would give me this morning we've got
[1:41:24] our rights let me tell you something
[1:41:26] friend on the day of Pentecost the Bible
[1:41:29] didn't say that they come out of their
[1:41:31] sitting like this
[1:41:34] what's that
[1:41:36] what is that
[1:41:40] you imagine them looking and said these
[1:41:42] men are drunk
[1:41:50] Glory
[1:41:53] imagine no fits Fritz rather when
[1:41:56] brother Brown needed a skunk
[1:41:59] and he come up on that wood pile where
[1:42:00] that skunk was
[1:42:02] I know Francis our equivalent and
[1:42:04] shaking so oh
[1:42:06] I don't want to do it I don't want to do
[1:42:09] it you imagine what old Fritz had done
[1:42:10] by the jacket brother remember looked at
[1:42:12] him and went
[1:42:15] French to look back and said is that all
[1:42:17] you've got labored and fought all hell
[1:42:19] to bring you a sermon
[1:42:20] and what you do is sit there or not
[1:42:28] some of you get wild do this
[1:42:35] well Glory
[1:42:38] I don't mind I'll tell you sometimes I
[1:42:40] feel bad like a dog but I could use a
[1:42:43] little encouragement every now and then
[1:42:44] but I don't want you to send me that
[1:42:46] text when I'm preaching I want you to
[1:42:48] say go ahead get him come on brother
[1:42:51] Donald preach I'm with you I'm behind
[1:42:54] you come on tell the truth preach the
[1:42:57] word preach Deliverance so my daughter
[1:42:59] can get the Holy Ghost preach the power
[1:43:02] of God so my son can get the Holy Ghost
[1:43:04] so my baby can be healed so this cancer
[1:43:08] can get out of my body oh Hallelujah it
[1:43:12] is all right
[1:43:13] it is all right
[1:43:19] if you take the word Pentecost out of
[1:43:22] this message you are taken away from
[1:43:25] what God's Prophet taught
[1:43:33] until he stops calling the Pentecostal
[1:43:37] message and Power
[1:43:42] say it with me will not cease
[1:43:48] [Applause]
[1:43:53] what the church had at Pentecost
[1:43:56] is her
[1:43:59] inalienable right
[1:44:01] [Applause]
[1:44:11] this is what the word a Navy bill right
[1:44:14] means
[1:44:15] and alienable right
[1:44:17] refers to the rights
[1:44:19] that cannot be surrendered
[1:44:22] sold or transferred to someone else
[1:44:28] Hallelujah I want you to have your
[1:44:30] blessing but you ain't getting mine
[1:44:32] well Paul I want you to have yours
[1:44:33] brother Jim I want you to have yours but
[1:44:35] you ain't getting mad I'm a little bit
[1:44:37] selfish when it comes to the blessings
[1:44:39] of God I want everything that's got my
[1:44:41] name wrote on it
[1:44:43] oh praise the Lord I'm not going to go
[1:44:45] through God's list I don't want to do
[1:44:46] this I don't want to shout like that I
[1:44:48] don't want to jerk like that I'll say
[1:44:49] Lord pour it out or if I need a jerk
[1:44:52] maybe I need to jerk some of the
[1:44:53] nonsense out of me if I need to shout
[1:44:55] maybe I need to kill some of my pride I
[1:44:58] want everything that's mine
[1:45:02] now listen this is your right not only
[1:45:05] it's a church body but as an individual
[1:45:08] it's a your neighborhood right to refer
[1:45:10] rights
[1:45:12] that cannot be surrendered sold or
[1:45:15] transferred to someone else especially a
[1:45:19] natural rights such as the right to own
[1:45:20] property however these rights can be
[1:45:23] transferred
[1:45:25] with the consent
[1:45:30] of the person possessing
[1:45:33] the rights
[1:45:37] so Island Haley Bill writes hell cannot
[1:45:41] take them
[1:45:42] demons cannot take them the only one
[1:45:46] that can transfer your inalienable
[1:45:49] rights

[1:46:03] and get on high blood pressure medicine
[1:46:07] my family it's in my DNA
[1:46:10] my whole family has been bothered by
[1:46:13] lust

[1:46:21] website my grandpa done it my daddy done

[1:46:39] from pornography you forfeited your
[1:46:42] right to be healed you forfeited your
[1:46:46] right to have peace that passes

[1:47:25] look at your future you've got to look
[1:47:28] at your destiny you've got to look at
[1:47:30] the promise of God as an inalienable
[1:47:34] right
[1:47:38] yeah

[1:48:57] a Holy Ghost Field marriage and a holy
[1:48:59] ghost filled family and a home on this
[1:49:02] auspense and I believe God wants our
[1:49:03] homes to be a little touch of Heaven I
[1:49:06] don't think it's pleasing to God when
[1:49:07] parents argue I don't think it's facing
[1:49:10] the God but husbands and wives get into
[1:49:12] big debates oh oh here we go again and
[1:49:15] arguing and fussing and fighting you are
[1:49:18] relinquishing your right to a peaceful
[1:49:20] home
[1:49:22] right
[1:49:24] thank you
[1:49:26] sir
[1:49:31] so y'all meeting him at the lawyer's
[1:49:33] office tomorrow

[1:49:45] that Rascal again I'll tell him if you
[1:49:47] bother me again I'm calling the cops on
[1:49:49] you because I go to church with some
[1:49:51] police Brothers ah you see we ain't just
[1:49:54] got a promise we bought a power of
[1:49:57] enforcement that boy may come back to
[1:49:59] your house the next day that man may
[1:50:01] knock on your door hey you didn't show
[1:50:02] up knowing furthermore I ain't done if
[1:50:04] you don't get out of here I'm calling
[1:50:06] 9-1-1 on you right now so you see the
[1:50:08] prophet of God teaches us in the
[1:50:10] restoration of the Bride Tree in 1962
[1:50:12] the there is a power to enforce what
[1:50:15] God's given us and a lot of that
[1:50:17] enforcement is going to be based upon
[1:50:19] your Authority as a believer that you
[1:50:22] recognize I don't have to bow down with
[1:50:24] this devil I do not have to give in to
[1:50:26] this devil I've got a right come on Holy
[1:50:29] Ghost back up your word back up your
[1:50:31] word I don't have to deal with this
[1:50:33] bunch of nonsense
[1:50:44] huh
[1:50:47] let's finish this quote can we
[1:50:49] Hebrews 2 1-4 therefore
[1:50:52] we ought to give the more Earnest tea to
[1:50:54] the things which we have heard
[1:50:56] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:50:58] for if the word spoken by Angels would
[1:51:01] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:51:03] Disobedience to the word received it
[1:51:05] just spoken by the Lord and was
[1:51:07] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[1:51:09] God also bearing them Witness
[1:51:12] both for signs and wonders and diverse
[1:51:16] gifts diverse Miracles and Gifts of the
[1:51:18] Holy Ghost according to his will that
[1:51:22] original church was not organized
[1:51:25] by men it was led by the Holy Ghost
[1:51:29] it wasn't very big it was hated and
[1:51:32] despised it was oppressed it was
[1:51:35] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[1:51:38] God it stayed with the original word
[1:51:41] pattern
[1:51:42] because of the unchanging God but
[1:51:44] unchanging ways we can go back to the
[1:51:46] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:51:48] ACT of God and then judged by that that
[1:51:51] is your standard brother sister
[1:51:53] this is how it's done the true church
[1:51:57] will always
[1:52:01] try to be like
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:05] [Applause]
[1:52:08] the original
[1:52:10] at Pentecost the true church of today
[1:52:14] will try to approximate that early first
[1:52:19] one
[1:52:20] oh praise the Lord is there anybody here
[1:52:23] that believes this
[1:52:29] you have to work
[1:52:31] from the original jump down in there
[1:52:34] about three quarters of the way in there
[1:52:35] as light begets like the true church
[1:52:38] will always be the one that tries to
[1:52:40] follow in the steps of her Founders Act
[1:52:45] Pentecost and her Messengers will follow
[1:52:48] the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to
[1:52:51] the first church age it is as simple and
[1:52:55] that wonderful
[1:52:57] it is that simple and that wonderful
[1:53:01] is it wonderful to you
[1:53:06] my brothers and sisters
[1:53:08] I present to you today
[1:53:11] another portion
[1:53:13] of your bill
[1:53:15] of Rights
[1:53:28] Hallelujah
[1:53:31] Miss Bauer heads together
[1:53:41] Lord Jesus
[1:53:44] we thank you for your word
[1:53:49] I don't mind saying and being honest
[1:53:52] it would be much easier
[1:53:55] if we just said well you know what
[1:53:58] it's just a lot of trouble
[1:54:01] and it's a lot of work
[1:54:03] to kick against the system
[1:54:07] it's just
[1:54:08] it just ain't worth it
[1:54:10] so we compromise here and we compromise
[1:54:14] there and we say well you know
[1:54:16] maybe we are a little emotional maybe we
[1:54:19] are a little upset
[1:54:21] we just get nervous and getting worked
[1:54:24] up
[1:54:25] so maybe we all need to settle down a
[1:54:28] little bit when we go to church we
[1:54:29] we don't do no worship we don't do no
[1:54:32] clapping of our hands and maybe that'll
[1:54:35] encourage the preacher to go from an
[1:54:37] hour 15 or hour 20 or whatever it is
[1:54:40] down to about 10 minutes
[1:54:42] and we've got this nice big Fellowship
[1:54:45] Hall on the other side
[1:54:46] and we'll start having less church time
[1:54:49] and more basketball time
[1:54:52] and more Fellowship time
[1:54:54] and we'll start bringing maybe donuts
[1:54:57] and coffee
[1:54:58] so we can all go over there and talk
[1:55:01] about how much we owe how much we own
[1:55:04] how much will worse
[1:55:08] it might be easier on the flesh
[1:55:10] but Lord we know in the long run that is
[1:55:13] the way of death
[1:55:18] our building our facility
[1:55:20] is not designed with fellowship with one
[1:55:24] another being the main principle
[1:55:26] it's fellowship with you
[1:55:29] and your presence
[1:55:31] where you can change our lives
[1:55:36] that first church died animals tore
[1:55:39] their guts out of them
[1:55:40] many of them their heads were chopped
[1:55:42] off
[1:55:44] they were treated awful
[1:55:46] slaughtered some said and then Paul
[1:55:49] quoted it slaughtered his sheep
[1:55:53] but they held true
[1:55:55] who are we then to go sliding in and
[1:55:58] this Carefree age of laodicea
[1:56:01] wanting to be burden free and
[1:56:03] trouble-free
[1:56:05] Lord God I don't
[1:56:08] I'm not a fool I'm not asking for
[1:56:10] trouble to come my way
[1:56:12] but neither am I asking for asking for
[1:56:14] trouble to come my way
[1:56:16] but neither am I asking for a flower bed
[1:56:18] of ease
[1:56:20] how could I stand up and look at men
[1:56:23] like Paul
[1:56:24] how could I stand up Lord and look at
[1:56:27] those of men
[1:56:28] how can some of these politicians
[1:56:31] how could those who are in the White
[1:56:34] House in Congress and Senate
[1:56:36] stand before John Quincy Adams Thomas
[1:56:40] Edison what would those men say about
[1:56:43] our leaders today
[1:56:45] that are nothing
[1:56:47] but compromisers
[1:56:50] whatever the people want let them have
[1:56:52] it give it to them
[1:56:53] oh how our forefathers would roll over
[1:56:56] their grave as we'd say
[1:56:59] well what about our forefathers of the
[1:57:01] face
[1:57:02] Peter James John Paul
[1:57:05] what about our own church AIDS messenger
[1:57:09] how would he feel to walk into churches
[1:57:12] and a lot of them don't even believe in
[1:57:14] Preachers no more
[1:57:16] those many of them that do believe in
[1:57:18] Preachers don't believe that Jesus is
[1:57:20] the same I wonder if brother Branham
[1:57:22] could come and preach a sermon and ever
[1:57:24] Message Church
[1:57:25] if he would indict the denominations or
[1:57:28] indict us
[1:57:32] help us Lord God
[1:57:35] help us Lord God
[1:57:38] we want to be like that true church
[1:57:42] oh the times have changed if Peter and
[1:57:45] James would walk in this place today
[1:57:47] they'd be overwhelmed I'm sure
[1:57:49] David walk in brother Tim's Church many
[1:57:51] churches around the world that have
[1:57:54] their own building on their own property
[1:57:57] they would no doubt say what is all this
[1:57:59] stuff
[1:58:00] they'd see them screams and the words
[1:58:02] there
[1:58:03] look at these instruments and say what's
[1:58:05] that big long black thing oh Paul that's
[1:58:07] a piano
[1:58:09] what's that other thing it's it's an
[1:58:10] organ what's them things are beaten on
[1:58:13] there's drums
[1:58:15] what's that thing with them six strings
[1:58:18] it's a guitar
[1:58:20] but I hope they would be one thing they
[1:58:23] would identify with
[1:58:25] are preaching
[1:58:27] our Saints
[1:58:28] living right dressing right saying Amen
[1:58:32] to the word
[1:58:33] no doubt Paul might in one way feel
[1:58:35] uncomfortable being in a church this
[1:58:38] size and among this many people
[1:58:40] since at the Crete Corinthian Church and
[1:58:43] the church at Ephesus
[1:58:45] average would run between 12 and 20.
[1:58:49] they might feel uncomfortable getting up
[1:58:51] here to stand before all these people
[1:58:53] today
[1:58:54] but I hope it feels so comfortable
[1:58:56] looking out there and preaching about
[1:58:57] the deity of Christ and send these young
[1:58:59] people raised in their hands and saying
[1:59:01] praise God
[1:59:03] I hope you look around at some of us in
[1:59:05] our 40s 56s in one of them more and we
[1:59:07] would react the same way the Holy Ghost
[1:59:10] fell on them there at the upper coast of
[1:59:12] Ephesus when he went there and said how
[1:59:14] are you all baptized I said oh John
[1:59:15] baptized this he said that won't work in
[1:59:17] this day you got to be baptized in the
[1:59:19] name of the Lord Jesus and when he
[1:59:20] baptized them then laid hands on them
[1:59:22] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:59:24] I hope Paul would feel so comfortable
[1:59:26] that he could say you know you've gone
[1:59:28] people here today any of you older
[1:59:30] people need the Holy Ghost
[1:59:31] and Paul could lay his hands on him and
[1:59:34] watch the Holy Ghost fall on and refresh
[1:59:35] like it did two thousand years ago
[1:59:37] that's the kind of church we want Lord
[1:59:40] hallelujah we're not looking for some
[1:59:42] spot in the Johnson City Press new
[1:59:44] church built look at the fancy pictures
[1:59:46] look at the pretty lights look at this
[1:59:48] we don't care if our picture ever gets
[1:59:49] in the newspaper we don't care Lord God
[1:59:52] if anybody thinks it's the most
[1:59:53] beautiful building what difference does
[1:59:55] that make to us we wanted to be a place
[1:59:57] where the Holy Ghost is welcome
[1:59:59] we want it to be a place for the angels
[2:00:02] of God can come down and walk among us
[2:00:04] Lord
[2:00:05] oh Jesus it's our right our inalienable
[2:00:10] right
[2:00:11] I for one will fight for it
[2:00:15] I will fight hell
[2:00:17] I will fight false Doctrine
[2:00:20] give me strength give me wisdom
[2:00:24] give me courage Lord
[2:00:26] Hallelujah
[2:00:28] how many would raise your hand with me
[2:00:30] here today and say Lord
[2:00:31] let me stand
[2:00:33] I may not be a preacher but Lord let me
[2:00:36] stand behind the men of God that are
[2:00:38] fine
[2:00:39] I'll swear allegiance to Jesus Christ I
[2:00:43] pledge my allegiance to the Lamb of God
[2:00:47] Hallelujah I will stand and forfeit my
[2:00:50] rights to be a laodicean
[2:00:52] I will forfeit my rights to dressing
[2:00:55] acting and behaving like the world
[2:00:58] I will pledge my allegiance to the Lamb
[2:01:01] of God
[2:01:03] Lord help me as long as I can as an
[2:01:05] American citizen
[2:01:08] I was never able to serve in our armed
[2:01:10] services
[2:01:11] yet many of our people have
[2:01:14] Lord may I say to them I thank them
[2:01:17] today not only those that are alive but
[2:01:19] those who gave and paid the ultimate
[2:01:22] sacrifice
[2:01:23] they gave their life yet many of them
[2:01:25] lived but they come home scarred for
[2:01:28] life
[2:01:29] trauma all kinds of things they still
[2:01:31] deal with to this day Lord we give
[2:01:34] credit to those today for doing that
[2:01:37] not only those who fought in our armed
[2:01:39] services but Lord God those men of God
[2:01:42] that have fought for the truth how we
[2:01:44] long to stand there and Shake Luther's
[2:01:46] hand Wesley's hand knocks Calvin many of
[2:01:49] those men at that day that stood there
[2:01:52] father to Proclaim what truth they had
[2:01:54] so we'd be able to stand here today and
[2:01:56] say that we are a people who have a
[2:01:59] restored face
[2:02:00] we worship you Lord Jesus
[2:02:03] what about our children are we willing
[2:02:05] to stand beside Paul and Luther and
[2:02:08] Wesley and Knox and many of those men
[2:02:11] that gave their lives for the cause oh
[2:02:14] my I want to be something when we stand
[2:02:15] there that day and the people of this
[2:02:18] age will stand there with the prophet of
[2:02:20] God of our age and he will present us as

[2:08:32] of the world but now they're holy hands
[2:08:35] because they're cleansed by the fire of

[2:08:53] Him for just a little bit before we go
[2:08:56] oh Jesus we worship you father let's
[2:08:59] sing a little something hey can we just
[2:09:01] worship him a bit I know we gotta we got
[2:09:04] a memorial service later this evening
[2:09:05] precious a little bit for time but I
[2:09:07] believe we've got time to be able to
[2:09:08] Worship the Lord a little before we go
[2:09:10] remember Jesus said his house will be
[2:09:13] called a house of prayer is that right
[2:09:16] but we know it's also a place that there
[2:09:19] the prophet said for God and his people
[2:09:22] are worshiped together
[2:09:25] God and his people are worse you said
[2:09:29] what
[2:09:30] worship together
[2:09:32] what do you mean by that statement
[2:09:34] Brother Don it's quite simple if you
[2:09:36] understand what worship is you see it
[2:09:38] used to be in the wedding vows and the
[2:09:40] ancient English wedding vows by which
[2:09:42] some of your great-grandparents and
[2:09:44] maybe even some of your grandparents
[2:09:45] were married by
[2:09:47] with thee my body I the worship
[2:09:52] so the mate making it by The Vow when
[2:09:54] they would stand there they was giving
[2:09:56] their body to their husband or wife and
[2:10:00] there you understand what God does God
[2:10:02] comes Among Us and God gives us of his
[2:10:06] own body word and he's saying my bride
[2:10:09] this is me take of me
[2:10:12] learn of me take me this is who I am and
[2:10:16] this is who I want you to be and God's
[2:10:19] saying I'm giving myself to you this is
[2:10:21] what worship is it's not just screaming
[2:10:24] and hollering God ain't raising his
[2:10:25] hands to you God is Not bowing giving
[2:10:28] you obeisance that's not all worship is
[2:10:30] but worship is sure raising your hands
[2:10:33] and praising him but worship is you
[2:10:35] saying with my body I the worship not
[2:10:40] only on Sunday morning but tomorrow next
[2:10:43] day and next day and next day and you
[2:10:45] keep him before you and it helps you to
[2:10:47] not do things that you ought not do
[2:10:49] because you realize your body Belongs to
[2:10:52] the Lord your body is the temple of God
[2:10:55] so with your body you worship almighty
[2:10:59] God he turns right back around and what
[2:11:01] does he do pulls his bride up close to
[2:11:04] him he says sweetheart I love you you're
[2:11:07] mine I bought you I'll ordain you I
[2:11:11] called you you understand what he's
[2:11:12] doing he is relating to you and cooing
[2:11:16] and making love to you
[2:11:19] oh my
[2:11:21] can we just take a few moments now
[2:11:24] brother Branham after being down at
[2:11:26] brother Charlie Cox's house in 1956 and
[2:11:28] brother Charlie showed me the power line
[2:11:31] where this happened there was a driveway
[2:11:33] that pulled right up in brother
[2:11:34] Charlie's house and there was a power
[2:11:36] line that was right over the top of that
[2:11:38] driveway
[2:11:39] and brother Branham had seen two doves
[2:11:41] two turtle doves and they were sitting
[2:11:43] out there on that power line and they
[2:11:45] had their little necks wrapped around
[2:11:46] one another brother random had been down
[2:11:48] there in 1956 so he goes to Brooklyn New
[2:11:52] York and he also comes back to
[2:11:54] Jeffersonville and he begins to preach
[2:11:56] about them doves and they were sitting
[2:11:58] there on them lines he said making love
[2:12:01] to one another and he said how God
[2:12:03] searches for cold starchy hearts that he
[2:12:07] can be able to make love to that God
[2:12:10] wants to come and break that old
[2:12:12] hardness about us and break that old
[2:12:15] starchy Cole sing about us and God take
[2:12:18] his neck and wrap around ours
[2:12:21] and cool to you brother Charlie said
[2:12:24] them little doves had sat there and the
[2:12:26] male would
[2:12:31] cool
[2:12:32] and the little female would sit there
[2:12:34] and say
[2:12:39] no she didn't do that but you know what
[2:12:41] she done cool
[2:12:46] so the male would coo and shuku back
[2:12:50] well I don't know how what you think
[2:12:51] about this service today but I think
[2:12:53] he's been cooing to us
[2:12:56] what do you say we go back
[2:13:00] let's wrap our neck around his
[2:13:03] just take a few minutes before we go and
[2:13:05] sing
[2:13:07] just worshiping I'm not asking you to
[2:13:09] run jump scream holler shout jump over
[2:13:12] the pews turn the seats down backwards
[2:13:16] just wrap your neck around here Jesus I
[2:13:19] love you
[2:13:21] have I told you today how much you mean
[2:13:23] to me
[2:13:25] a couple months me and Carol will be
[2:13:26] married for 50 years
[2:13:28] but you know what I still tell her
[2:13:30] you're the most special person
[2:13:33] I counseled a young couple last Sunday
[2:13:35] Carol was in North Richmond I looked
[2:13:36] over to him and told him
[2:13:38] one of the most important things about
[2:13:39] marriage is learning to communicate to
[2:13:41] be able to keep that harness together
[2:13:43] even when you're facing difficult times
[2:13:45] and I said there ain't nobody in the
[2:13:47] world I would rather spend the rest of
[2:13:49] my life with I have absolutely this many
[2:13:52] regrets for marrying her as a 16 year
[2:13:55] old girl
[2:13:57] and I would marry her again
[2:13:59] if I was 16.
[2:14:02] why I love her but you know what I just
[2:14:05] didn't tell her that when we got married
[2:14:07] a man and woman driving down the road
[2:14:09] and they've been married for a long long
[2:14:10] time and things got a little tough
[2:14:11] between them
[2:14:12] and she said you realize you ain't told
[2:14:15] me that you loved me in a long time and
[2:14:16] said I told you I loved you one moment
[2:14:17] when I married you if it changes I'll
[2:14:19] let you know
[2:14:20] that's about the way a lot of folks feel
[2:14:22] about Jesus well I told him I loved him
[2:14:24] when I got saved how many more times
[2:14:26] does he want to hear it what about 85
[2:14:28] trillion
[2:14:29] he wants to hear it every day of your
[2:14:31] life he wants to hear it all through the
[2:14:34] day all during the day oh my Lord I love
[2:14:37] you but I told you today I love you have
