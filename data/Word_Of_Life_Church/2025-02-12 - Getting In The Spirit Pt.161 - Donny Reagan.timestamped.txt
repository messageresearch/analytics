[32:07] Mighty
[32:09] God thank you Lord
[32:12] Jesus what an awesome privilege is for
[32:14] us to be gathered together on Wednesday
[32:16] night how many loves church on Wednesday
[32:18] night
[32:23] amen thank the Lord let's turn to Psalms
[32:26] if you would tonight Psalm 126
[32:32] verse5 thank the Lord for his Mercy to
[32:35] us and his
[32:36] grace as much as we would like to
[32:39] understand and comprehend his
[32:42] greatness I would imagine for the most
[32:44] of us we still know so very little about
[32:48] him and our understanding would be so
[32:52] small a comprehension of it and not only
[32:56] to look at big and numbers and how big
[33:00] the universe all that sort of thing but
[33:03] greatness is expressed in humility not
[33:07] just in size and numbers I'm so grateful
[33:10] we know in that way Psalms 126
[33:15] five they that
[33:18] sow in
[33:21] tears shall reap en Joy
[33:28] okay so here is a type of
[33:33] sewing that can be in
[33:36] sadness sorrow now we've been talking
[33:39] about sewing seed for the rain to
[33:43] come now we would think well depending
[33:47] on the mood we sew it in that would be
[33:51] the same mood we reap it in it's not the
[33:55] mood that it reproduces but it's the
[33:58] seat notice how David says this they
[34:01] that sow in tears not you're not sewing
[34:06] tears but you're
[34:08] sewing in
[34:11] tears they that sow in tears shall
[34:16] reap in Joy so it doesn't say they that
[34:20] sow tears will reap Joy it's
[34:26] impossible now if you'll think about a
[34:29] lot of our life and our walk before the
[34:32] Lord it describes it right here in this
[34:35] verse so many things that we have to go
[34:37] through as Christian so many things that
[34:39] we deal with sorrow sickness difficulty
[34:42] trouble even sometimes from friends that
[34:45] we have to part from because of sin or
[34:50] something there just breaks your heart
[34:54] but yet you are sewing in tears but
[34:58] sewing righteous
[35:00] seed and whenever you reap that
[35:04] righteous seed you will not reap it back
[35:07] in tears but you will actually reap it
[35:10] back in
[35:12] Joy if we could keep this in mind
[35:15] through the hard things we go through I
[35:17] think it make it easier for us they that
[35:20] sow in tears shall reap in
[35:24] Joy he that goeth forth
[35:28] and
[35:29] weepeth
[35:31] bearing precious seed now again notice
[35:35] David in this verse he's not saying that
[35:38] the Weeping is the seed it's the
[35:43] demeanor of the swer so he's describing
[35:47] an emotion that the so is
[35:51] having you mothers and fathers know
[35:53] whenever you have to correct your
[35:55] children whenever you would have to say
[35:57] say something to someone that you really
[35:59] love and it might it might really be
[36:01] painful and it might really hurt so how
[36:04] do you sow them typ ay sometimes you
[36:07] have to sew him in tears but you keep in
[36:10] mind he reward you in the right way he
[36:14] that goeth forth and weepeth bearing
[36:17] precious
[36:19] seed shall doubtless come again
[36:23] with
[36:25] rejoicing bringing his
[36:29] sheaves bringing his
[36:32] sheaves with him which is a cycle of
[36:36] maturity so you seow it sometimes in
[36:39] heaviness a preacher SWS seed many times
[36:44] in
[36:44] tears he SWS correction in heaviness and
[36:50] sorrow but he believes that God will
[36:53] turn that around and that he one day
[36:56] will reap
[36:58] with
[36:59] rejoicing praise the Lord is't that
[37:01] awesome scriptures he that goeth forth
[37:03] and weepeth bearing precious seed shall
[37:05] doubtless come again with rejoicing
[37:09] bringing his sheaves so all that he SED
[37:13] was not in vain so he went out with seed
[37:16] and when he comes back he comes back
[37:19] with those sheaves bringing in the
[37:22] mature
[37:23] Harvest Galatians 6 the scripture that
[37:26] we've been reading for several service
[37:27] is Galatians
[37:29] 6:7 be not deceived God is Not mocked
[37:32] for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he
[37:36] also
[37:38] reap for he that sth to his flesh shall
[37:41] of the flesh reap corruption but he that
[37:44] sth to the spirit shall of the spirit
[37:48] reap life
[37:50] Everlasting now let's read if you would
[37:52] from a little sermon that brother randam
[37:55] preached called the era of God's
[37:56] Deliverance from shreport
[38:00] 1956 and he's talking about Ahab and
[38:03] Jezebel a few paragraphs above that and
[38:06] he said Elijah had told him how he was
[38:10] going to die and what God was going to
[38:12] do because he was wicked and how that
[38:18] Jezebel was going to be fed to the
[38:24] dogs now we know enough about God to
[38:28] know God would have never allowed this
[38:31] to
[38:32] happen unless there was something really
[38:35] really bad about these
[38:38] people so the dogs are going to lick
[38:40] your
[38:42] blood and they will turn right around
[38:45] and eat Jezebel's
[38:48] flesh which is unusual for dogs wild
[38:52] dogs yes the tame dogs that live in a
[38:55] city so they leave her hand and parts of
[38:58] her feet is what they eat now how how
[39:02] could she
[39:03] reap such a
[39:05] harvest because of her attitude to God's
[39:09] people and remember the nail that
[39:12] finished it all was her treatment to
[39:15] nabos which was not a preacher not a
[39:18] prophet not a high priest just a man
[39:22] that had a garden and a house an
[39:25] inheritance in a certain part of the
[39:27] city and Ahab wanted it and he said no
[39:31] this this is my inheritance you keep
[39:34] that in mind when sickness attacks you
[39:36] when the devil tries to rob your home
[39:39] peace Joy this and that you let him know
[39:42] that's your inheritance in Christ Jesus
[39:44] amen nebal standing for that inheritance
[39:47] finally cost him his life now notice
[39:51] what what God did how that Jezebel was
[39:54] going to be fed to the dogs because she
[39:57] did the evil thing that she had done and
[40:01] remember my
[40:03] brethren and
[40:05] sisters you'll
[40:07] reap what you
[40:10] sow you well that's God's law that's
[40:15] God's law of nature now brother Donnie
[40:18] does it apply to elect and
[40:21] non-elect it does y it sure does now
[40:26] this law does not change
[40:28] election it does not change the power of
[40:32] salvation but it is the law of God that
[40:35] what you sow you will reap so don't get
[40:38] in your mind well I'm bride I'm ordained
[40:39] I'm predestinated I can do you know
[40:41] pretty much and God will deal with me in
[40:43] a different way and where was it you got
[40:45] that
[40:46] at you need to find that man that told
[40:49] you that lie and tell him to quit lying
[40:51] to
[40:53] people right I mean like to be remember
[40:56] tonight as as we pray have a couple of
[40:59] prayer claws one for brother George
[41:02] Hamlin who's been dealing with a pretty
[41:04] bad cough now for several months and um
[41:08] had another scan and he still got some
[41:10] pneumonia in his lung also Brother Louis
[41:12] wanted us to pray over one for brother
[41:15] Keith beanan he's in a real real
[41:18] desperate
[41:19] situation um needing a liver transplant
[41:23] so we want to pray for them as well
[41:24] tonight how many has an unspoken request
[41:27] something you want to present before the
[41:28] Lord with all your
[41:30] heart Heavenly Father we thank you for
[41:33] the reading of your
[41:35] word dear Jesus we desire tonight that
[41:38] we might be better equipped when we walk
[41:43] out these doors than we were when we
[41:45] came in that we might understand a
[41:50] little bit more about who we are and
[41:53] where we are in time why you are so
[41:58] meticulous about the seed that we seow
[42:02] and if we could only look at it in the
[42:04] right way that you aren't just trying to
[42:07] warn us of the seed that we sow but you
[42:11] are conveying to us your own
[42:15] nature so this is why you are so
[42:19] particular over men that you will call
[42:22] to preach the word and you're even more
[42:26] particular
[42:27] about men that you will call to
[42:31] interpret the word because every
[42:34] preacher is not called to be an
[42:37] interpreter of the word for the age but
[42:41] that is assigned to a certain Church age
[42:45] messenger then those others go out from
[42:48] under them and then they preach what
[42:52] those Church AIDS Messengers have been
[42:54] given because you also follow this same
[42:59] law and you knew whatever type of seed
[43:04] you sowed that's what type of harvest
[43:08] you would reap so if you are
[43:12] responsible for seing all of the
[43:16] denominations then you sir are to blame
[43:21] for the Havoc that they have wrought on
[43:23] the
[43:24] Earth but we know you would never seow
[43:28] such a
[43:29] thing and help us to see father now it
[43:32] is our time after the message has been
[43:35] brought now we will be hit by an
[43:39] onslaught of
[43:41] demons to see if we will
[43:45] hybridize our message from God the way
[43:49] all the other ages have done father you
[43:53] see these prayer calls I have in my hand
[43:54] tonight dear God minister to to the
[43:57] needs of these my brothers speak to us
[44:00] from your word father in the name of
[44:02] Jesus amen God bless you Saint you may
[44:05] be
[44:10] seated we know that it's a Divine Law of
[44:15] God
[44:16] to follow those ones that God has
[44:22] called to interpret his word
[44:27] now keep this in mind you can
[44:30] only serve God on
[44:34] Earth as Those whom God has
[44:38] called to interpret that word to you
[44:44] which does not include your
[44:47] pastor which does not include your
[44:51] favorite
[44:53] evangelist every preacher is not called
[44:57] to
[44:59] interpret the word of God that's given
[45:02] to the office of a Vindicated Prophet
[45:06] amen and the Word of Life said that's
[45:09] not given to you Ley it's not given to
[45:12] me I do not have the right nor the
[45:15] authority nor the understanding to
[45:19] interpret God's word it's not my place
[45:23] it's not my place to do so it's not the
[45:25] place of many of the men
[45:27] around the message who are doing it now
[45:31] they take the word well I think it means
[45:33] this and I think it means that and I
[45:36] don't think this no longer applies I
[45:38] think this was for another time now you
[45:41] realize what they're doing they are
[45:43] interpreting the word to those who
[45:47] follows them but on what
[45:50] right do they establish that on well
[45:55] because they preach Maybe for 45 years
[45:59] that's not qualification enough maybe
[46:01] because they've been preaching since
[46:03] they was 18 years old that's not
[46:06] qualification enough either you've got
[46:09] to be a
[46:11] godall Vindicated Prophet to divinely
[46:16] interpret the word of God a theologian
[46:20] is not good enough a preacher is not
[46:23] good enough a teacher a missionary
[46:27] a pastor or no one else other than a
[46:31] Vindicated Prophet so it's one of God's
[46:36] laws that we will serve God on Earth as
[46:42] those who are sent to us interpret that
[46:45] word then we will answer to God on how
[46:50] close that we stick to that Vindicated
[46:55] message of the hour that we lived in now
[46:58] this is where that people have always
[47:02] messed up it's when God would give his
[47:06] word and then they would begin to reason
[47:08] many of them wait till after the
[47:10] messenger of course is gone uh they
[47:13] would many of them would never confront
[47:15] him to his face they knew better but
[47:17] it's answer that he's gone and then
[47:20] times change and people change and they
[47:25] feel like because time changes and
[47:28] people change that somehow we need to
[47:33] re-evaluate
[47:35] resin and reapply the message of the
[47:38] hour that we live now we don't think
[47:41] well it's not that it's not the same
[47:43] message of the hour but we just need to
[47:46] resink it and maybe we don't need to so
[47:50] strictly adhere to what has been
[47:53] delivered maybe we've become too legal
[47:56] to it and maybe it's not really that
[47:58] necessary and all you see there is when
[48:02] we start listening to the spirit of
[48:05] antichrist to get us to hybrid what God
[48:10] has given to us either with a message
[48:15] that has been in the days gone by and we
[48:20] will hybridize it with a past message or
[48:25] we will hybrid it with someone else's
[48:29] opinion in the present day that we live
[48:33] in either way it produces a hybrid
[48:37] product now remember God's word will
[48:40] never hybridize as far as God is
[48:44] concerned now what happens is that
[48:47] people will they will
[48:50] sew to the
[48:53] wind and then they will re
[48:57] a wh wind so they will sew to the wind
[49:02] that's a scripture in case you don't
[49:04] know it he Hosea
[49:07] 8:7 for they have swn the wind and shall
[49:13] reap the
[49:15] Whirlwind so they
[49:18] sewn the wind and reap a whirlwind now
[49:22] they might have sown to something that
[49:25] was very gentle and we know it's how a
[49:28] breeze can be boy don't we appreciate a
[49:31] nice cooling breeze here in East
[49:33] Tennessee when it's about 90 in the
[49:36] shade and about 85% humidity and a
[49:39] little breeze will come up and it goes
[49:41] to blow on that sweat rolling down your
[49:44] cheeks and it feels just like an air
[49:46] conditioner don't it and we think man
[49:49] how good that breeze feels and a lot of
[49:51] people that's the way they seow the
[49:55] hybridization of the word they don't sew
[49:58] it to a tornado but they sew it to a
[50:02] gentle easy Breeze that just simply
[50:07] blows across their face or we'll say
[50:10] across their church service and it's a
[50:13] breeze that is so gentle and so nice but
[50:18] it will never come back in the same
[50:21] speed or Ratio or velocity that it was
[50:25] sewn in so it's sewn in a gentile Breeze
[50:30] that is so nice and so comforting but
[50:34] you know what's amazing is it comes back
[50:38] in the form of a
[50:41] whirlwind so what does it do it always
[50:46] magnifies now that's good in both the
[50:50] right but it's bad when it comes to the
[50:52] wrong now some preachers you know they
[50:55] they really have an issue and a problem
[50:58] whenever they're sewing seed and
[51:01] whenever they're preaching if people
[51:03] aren't just running and jumping and
[51:06] screaming and and don't get me wrong I
[51:08] like amens I like to know that the
[51:10] people are being blessed but I also
[51:13] realized this principle right here that
[51:16] if if I will seow even if it's under the
[51:20] influence of a gentle breeze that it
[51:24] will come right back in this same build
[51:26] in in the form of a whirlwind maybe a
[51:29] week or two or maybe a month later cuz
[51:33] God's word don't
[51:34] lie now this is actually a Hebrew
[51:39] proverb of course it was more amongst uh
[51:41] peoples of this time than it was with
[51:44] the Hebrew but we could relate to it
[51:46] because of them so it was a a proverbial
[51:50] uh manner of speech so it was signifying
[51:54] the taking also of a lot of work and a
[51:58] lot of preparation and sewing it to
[52:01] something that was invisible so now all
[52:04] of our lifetime all of us have felt
[52:07] breezes and winds and yet we've never
[52:10] been able to grab a hold of it we've
[52:13] never been able to harness it we've
[52:16] never been able to put it in a bag or
[52:20] open your car door as the breeze is
[52:22] coming through and you let the breeze
[52:25] come into your car door and you slam the
[52:27] car door you say I got it I got
[52:30] it no you can't tame it you can't catch
[52:34] it but yet people in the negative sense
[52:37] they will spend so much labor and sew it
[52:41] toward something that is passing and
[52:44] fleeing call a wind and then what's
[52:48] worse than that is they'll come right
[52:50] back and reap a whirlwind which will
[52:53] always bring more devastation and
[52:57] destruction than they ever deemed
[53:00] possible so it pays us to sew the right
[53:03] seed don't it so if if tonight is one of
[53:06] them quiet type of sewing deals I I'm
[53:09] good with that as long as y'all just bat
[53:11] your eye every now and then or just wave
[53:14] your hand to the breeze I know we're on
[53:16] the same page all right because I know
[53:19] God's word will not return to him void
[53:23] so the wind is an empty creature in
[53:28] respect to things that are solid and
[53:32] things that we could touch made of at
[53:36] atoms and molecules and structure and
[53:39] all that sort of thing so it comes
[53:41] through and it's gone and how do you
[53:44] know whether you've ever been touched by
[53:47] the same wind or not so the wind that
[53:50] passed your face when you were a three
[53:52] or four year old child and then when you
[53:55] were 21 the the wind come past again was
[53:58] it the same one that touched you by the
[54:00] Skip and you're three or four well when
[54:02] you're 30 the wind hits you again when
[54:04] you're 40 hits you again when you're 50
[54:06] hits you again is it the same one we
[54:09] know very little about it don't we yet
[54:12] sometimes people will sow so much to
[54:15] something that they know so little about
[54:18] and then when it comes back it never
[54:21] comes back and that Gentile small Breeze
[54:25] type of say but it can tear their home
[54:28] all to pieces it can tear their marriage
[54:31] all to pieces and they simply solded a
[54:35] little something maybe looking at a
[54:38] sister in the wrong way or a brother or
[54:41] just saying a little something that
[54:43] wasn't quite right y'all can say Amen
[54:46] right here if you want to and yet it
[54:49] just started with a small little
[54:51] something never never meant nothing bad
[54:54] maybe hand a sister a bottle of cake or
[54:56] something you're sitting at a restaurant
[54:58] or a salt shaker or Pepper or whatever
[55:01] more and by mistake you just simply
[55:03] touch your hand and from there it starts
[55:06] something right here and it may start
[55:09] the same thing and Herman so you sew to
[55:12] something that was unseen you sewed to
[55:16] something and it may be a month it may
[55:19] be two and then you think about it and
[55:22] then you may see her church and speak to
[55:25] her or you know whatever more however
[55:27] that it comes about and then before long
[55:30] it begins to pick up and it's picking up
[55:33] velocity and momentum and the breeze is
[55:36] building more and more and before you
[55:39] know it you have got a full-fledged
[55:42] tornado or a cat five hurricane on your
[55:46] hands and yet you were the one that swld
[55:50] for that thing to come through now you
[55:53] see but I take this also on the posit
[55:56] positive side that as long as I preach
[55:58] the word of God the message of the hour
[56:01] with the right attitude the right time
[56:03] the right season everything like that uh
[56:05] you may look at and think brother Donnie
[56:07] is it doing any good I'm sewing to the
[56:10] wind but I'm looking for that hurricane
[56:13] called The Rapture and it's coming by
[56:15] after a while and it may look small now
[56:18] it may not look like there's a whole lot
[56:20] going on it may look like oh my we're
[56:23] just coming to church and we're just
[56:24] kind of playing along and the Breeze is
[56:26] coming along and we're sewing seed and
[56:28] we're clapping our hands and oh
[56:30] everything seems good and we're doing
[56:32] all right but you see I've got my eyes
[56:35] on something more than the sewing time
[56:38] I'm waiting for this cat five which is
[56:41] gr a c e j s u s f AI t h I'm looking
[56:46] for this cat five that is going to carry
[56:49] the bride out of here in a moment in a
[56:52] twinkling of an eye because if I keep
[56:55] sewing this seed
[56:56] it will not fall to the ground it will
[56:59] come to pass is that right so a person
[57:04] will not merely reap what they sow but
[57:08] it will be greatly multiplied so if
[57:11] people sow Folly and in vanity natur
[57:14] just going to be so much worse and it
[57:17] will be in such a violent devastating
[57:20] way in the way that it will return so
[57:25] when it comes back you see it's an
[57:27] emblem of rest it didn't start out that
[57:30] way now if people would see what the
[57:33] wrong seed they're sewing if they could
[57:35] see the outcome down the road there a
[57:37] month or two or three or a year or two
[57:40] most of the people would never do it
[57:42] that way but Satan always hides that end
[57:45] result now it's amazing because he not
[57:48] only tries to hide the end result for
[57:50] The Sinner but he also wants to hide the
[57:54] end result for the child of God he wants
[57:57] us to focus on our sickness he wants us
[58:01] to focus on our trouble on our pain on
[58:04] our Agony he does not want us to see
[58:08] that us sowing the seeds of reading our
[58:11] Bible sewing the seeds of coming to
[58:13] church when you really didn't feel like
[58:16] coming tonight you didn't feel like
[58:18] Clapping Your Hands you didn't feel like
[58:20] praising the Lord but you se de seed
[58:23] anyhow and you worship God he'll try to
[58:26] to hide from you the reward of that seed
[58:30] of you worshiping God when you didn't
[58:32] feel like it he knows if you do that
[58:35] you're sewing seed and he'll try to keep
[58:38] that from you by you sewing that seed
[58:41] God's going to turn around and bless you
[58:43] a hundred times over because you offered
[58:46] to God a sacrifice of praise and you
[58:50] worshiped him when you didn't feel like
[58:52] doing it you would have felt better off
[58:55] physically if if you have stayed home
[58:57] it's much easier now to stream of course
[59:00] it's a lot easier for people to can sit
[59:02] home kick back in the recliner uh get
[59:05] him a a big bowl of sugarfree ice cream
[59:08] and get him some sugar-free chocolate
[59:10] cake and then drink a double espresso on
[59:13] top of that and sit there and a men and
[59:15] me from their recliner or they can sit
[59:17] there on their couch and just kind of
[59:19] hang out and they rub the dog on the top
[59:22] of the head and the cat on the top of
[59:23] the head and then they say Amen they
[59:26] throw me an amen through the radio or
[59:28] through the to the monitor of course us
[59:31] message people don't have TVs but we've
[59:33] got a Sanctified version of it and we
[59:35] got a monitor and they don't pull come
[59:38] on now and they don't really put nothing
[59:40] into the service and it's much easier to
[59:43] stay home but I'll tell you one thing

[1:01:56] this is
[1:01:57] 1959 so it went from the flapper to A
[1:02:01] Chorus girl then of course between the
[1:02:03] chorus girl and now we've had a couple
[1:02:07] of more
[1:02:08] generations and look what they are yeah
[1:02:12] and if time goes on what will they
[1:02:15] become oh my what's her daughter going
[1:02:18] to be you see what you do bear something
[1:02:22] upon
[1:02:23] listen do you see single young people
[1:02:28] understand that what you do will affect
[1:02:32] your children do you married mothers and
[1:02:36] fathers realize things you do the way
[1:02:39] you behave the way you act the way you
[1:02:42] talk your attitude toward church can
[1:02:46] affect your children and even your
[1:02:50] grandchildren now you men that feel like
[1:02:53] you can sneak around and get on your
[1:02:55] phone and look at things that's indecent
[1:02:57] and ungodly and you say well all I got
[1:03:00] to do is ask God to forgive me but you
[1:03:02] realize that you may be doing something
[1:03:06] for your young Sons that's right do you
[1:03:10] understand what you may be doing to your
[1:03:12] young Sons you sisters in the same way
[1:03:16] of doing things that are not right you
[1:03:18] said well I I just repent and I ask God
[1:03:20] to forgive me yeah and God will forgive
[1:03:22] you but the angels of God don't go up
[1:03:25] there and rub up all of those seeds that
[1:03:27] you've swn they've been sown
[1:03:32] now praise the
[1:03:34] Lord notice this see what you do bears
[1:03:39] something upon your
[1:03:45] generations to follow
[1:03:51] you sin does to three are
[1:03:57] for
[1:03:59] generations and righteousness death live
[1:04:04] right it'll do something to your
[1:04:09] children to follow
[1:04:12] you now do you understand you're not
[1:04:14] just doing it for
[1:04:17] yourself oh I would to God we would have
[1:04:19] heard this years ago many of us when we
[1:04:21] were younger it might have helped I'm
[1:04:23] sure it would have helped us and some
[1:04:25] some of our kids might have turned out a
[1:04:27] lot
[1:04:29] different why because message people do
[1:04:32] not believe this that's
[1:04:35] why they do not believe this element
[1:04:40] that the prophet
[1:04:41] taught it's just another one that
[1:04:43] they're adding to the list that's all I
[1:04:47] still believe it
[1:04:50] myself now notice livide it'll do
[1:04:53] something to your children that follow
[1:04:55] you on on keep living right doing right
[1:04:59] separating yourself from the things of
[1:05:01] the world and live Godly in the present
[1:05:05] world for Christ Jesus so you understand
[1:05:09] that things can be handed
[1:05:12] down to your children or even your
[1:05:16] grandchildren that's right promiscuous
[1:05:20] living can be handed
[1:05:24] down to two and three
[1:05:27] generations
[1:05:29] epilepsy can be passed down or brought
[1:05:33] on because a
[1:05:36] grandparent does something disobedient
[1:05:39] to God's
[1:05:42] word now most of us would do everything
[1:05:46] within our power to keep our children
[1:05:49] from Evil and wrong Would we not what
[1:05:53] any of you parents tonight want your
[1:05:56] children to get
[1:05:59] epilepsy would you want any of your
[1:06:02] children to get to burcul losis or
[1:06:05] cancer or or anything like that you said
[1:06:07] oh you know i' take every vitamin
[1:06:09] possible if I could get a shot somehow
[1:06:12] and they would promise me that if I got
[1:06:14] this shot I would not pass that cancer
[1:06:16] cuz it runs in my family I'd get that
[1:06:19] shot I'd do it twice a year if that's
[1:06:21] what they recommended and you do that
[1:06:24] naturally but but what about the
[1:06:26] spiritual things you don't
[1:06:30] do now listen the prophet said all
[1:06:32] diseases come from direct or indirect
[1:06:37] cause from
[1:06:39] sin now not may be sin in your
[1:06:43] life but sin in your parents
[1:06:47] life
[1:06:51] inherited sin in your parents life
[1:06:59] inherited now as I said I realize
[1:07:01] there's an an element of message people
[1:07:03] that don't believe that but the last
[1:07:05] time I checked as far as I know we are a
[1:07:08] true message church right we believe the
[1:07:11] teaching of the message you believe that
[1:07:14] could be possible God said so I will
[1:07:17] visit the iniquity upon the children and
[1:07:20] the children's children to the third and
[1:07:22] fourth generation scripture yeah amen
[1:07:27] and now if you're dealing with sin now
[1:07:29] maybe you never
[1:07:31] sinned but there might be a sin that
[1:07:34] your father
[1:07:36] did your grandfather did and he said he
[1:07:40] visit the iniquity of the parents upon
[1:07:43] the third and fourth
[1:07:47] generation you understand one reason why
[1:07:50] now that we're several Generations in
[1:07:53] the message we've got people in our
[1:07:55] church that are second and third and
[1:07:58] some fourth generation message
[1:08:01] followers now can you imagine what it's
[1:08:04] going to be if the Lord carries for some
[1:08:07] of our message children and
[1:08:10] grandchildren what they are going to be
[1:08:13] dealing with in the days that are to
[1:08:15] come because of their grandparents
[1:08:19] attitude and their parents' attitude
[1:08:22] toward the word the message the prophet
[1:08:27] the other aspects of the
[1:08:33] ministry and by the way you do you are
[1:08:37] cutting out the past for your
[1:08:43] children and your
[1:08:46] grandchildren would any of us
[1:08:49] willingly be so
[1:08:52] cruel to do such a thing
[1:08:57] that you would stubbornly and hardheaded
[1:09:00] say I'm going to do it I don't
[1:09:05] care oh
[1:09:07] my now watch this oh help us tonight
[1:09:11] Jesus speak to us now maybe you never
[1:09:15] sin but there might be a sin that your
[1:09:17] father did your grandfather did and he
[1:09:20] said it visit the iniquity of the
[1:09:22] parents upon the third and fourth
[1:09:25] generation now keep in mind that all
[1:09:27] this is is Satan understanding the law
[1:09:32] of God so he doesn't have to actually
[1:09:37] make people worse in every
[1:09:40] generation all he had to do in the
[1:09:43] Garden of Eden was cause one woman to
[1:09:46] walk away from the program of God and
[1:09:49] her husband to love her so much that he
[1:09:52] would willingly walk out of the paradise
[1:09:55] of God for her
[1:09:56] sake then by the time it comes down of
[1:10:00] course to Cain which was not fathered by
[1:10:03] Adam and then when it comes from there
[1:10:05] when the two Bloodlines are still
[1:10:08] separate up to Genesis chapter
[1:10:11] 6 and we see what happened after that
[1:10:16] that the sin became greater and greater
[1:10:18] so whenever it come across on the flood
[1:10:21] the serpent did not have to show up
[1:10:24] again in Noah's Garden or Noah's
[1:10:28] Vineyard or somewhere near around Mount
[1:10:31] Ararat where they come out of the Ark
[1:10:35] and the the serpent had to begal another
[1:10:38] woman but you see the Bloodlines had
[1:10:41] crossed in Genesis 6 sons of God saw the
[1:10:44] daughters of men that they were fair and
[1:10:47] they took unto them women not even
[1:10:50] married to them just living with them
[1:10:52] and once the bloodline was crossed then
[1:10:55] in the ark was the mixture of the mixed
[1:11:00] blood and the mixed seed line prior to
[1:11:03] that there was two separate lines I hope
[1:11:06] this don't stagger you but Adam was not
[1:11:10] a devil after he fell in the Garden of
[1:11:16] Eden Adam never was a devil never could
[1:11:20] be a devil he was a fallen Son of
[1:11:27] God Adam did not have murder in his
[1:11:31] heart after he fell Abel never had
[1:11:36] murder in his heart though he was born
[1:11:39] by sex desire come on now how could Abel
[1:11:44] had murder in his heart and he was a
[1:11:47] direct descendant from Adam which was a
[1:11:50] direct descendant from God so Satan knew
[1:11:54] his accomplishment was never be brought
[1:11:56] to pass just by getting to Eve but he
[1:12:00] had to mix him two seed lines Lord
[1:12:02] children listen to me tonight that's
[1:12:05] exactly what he's done in every age try
[1:12:07] to mix in two seed lines down through
[1:12:10] time I'm talking about now just the
[1:12:12] physical part yes in Genesis but now the
[1:12:15] mixture is in the spiritual seed lines
[1:12:19] so what did he do cross the bloodline
[1:12:23] there in Genesis 6 then what do we find
[1:12:26] we don't find Adam ever getting drunk we
[1:12:29] don't find Abel ever getting drunk we
[1:12:31] don't find Seth getting
[1:12:34] drunk but who is the first one written
[1:12:37] in the Bible that got
[1:12:40] drunk
[1:12:43] Noah
[1:12:46] Noah what in the world
[1:12:49] happened what happened then we find
[1:12:52] Moses a murderer
[1:12:55] Jacob a
[1:12:56] deceiver where did it come from the
[1:12:59] mixing Of The Bloodline so if Jacob
[1:13:03] would start out being a deceiver and
[1:13:05] then Jacob is going to have all these
[1:13:08] boys and look at what they turned out to
[1:13:11] be now Satan all he had to do was step
[1:13:15] back and let the law of sewing and
[1:13:18] reaping kick in so Jacob so deceit and
[1:13:23] lies and treachery and then look at his
[1:13:26] son look at Reuben his firstborn went
[1:13:28] and laid with his concubine look look at
[1:13:31] Simeon and Levi look at the different
[1:13:33] things that these boys done how did D so
[1:13:36] Satan had to get on more work had to
[1:13:38] work harder No all he had to do would
[1:13:41] just stand by and watch the garden come
[1:13:44] up it's the same way with us it's the
[1:13:47] same way with us as a church it's the
[1:13:50] same way with us in the spiritual sense
[1:13:52] as it is in the natural sense Satan is
[1:13:55] not like Satan's working over time boy
[1:13:57] I'm going to have to hurry I'm going to
[1:13:58] have to hurry no sin is so multiplied
[1:14:02] all he's got to do is sit back and just
[1:14:03] watch people if God did not intervene
[1:14:07] man would annihilate
[1:14:11] himself I know a lot of people that
[1:14:13] don't understand Malachi 4 they don't
[1:14:15] understand why we have to have it but if
[1:14:17] you read it real good with a real
[1:14:20] understanding you will see that God said
[1:14:23] he would send Elijah in the last day
[1:14:27] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[1:14:33] curse God sending Elijah to you and I
[1:14:37] not only help Oh Glory to God bring us
[1:14:41] back to
[1:14:42] reconciliation of the end time message
[1:14:46] but it saved the Earth from being cursed
[1:14:49] by God God's prophets are intercessors
[1:14:55] oh Hallelujah can I go on tell me go on
[1:15:00] brother
[1:15:01] Donnie thank you now your own mouth is
[1:15:04] against
[1:15:05] you now what so it might be a a sin that
[1:15:09] your father did or your grandfather
[1:15:12] notice again in Mighty conquer but if
[1:15:15] the little fell if there's something in
[1:15:17] the family now watch he talking about a
[1:15:20] sickness even in a child if there's
[1:15:23] something in the family that the
[1:15:25] families
[1:15:26] done that caused this maybe it was for
[1:15:29] the glory of God maybe it was something
[1:15:31] they done maybe it's a sin of someone
[1:15:35] else their
[1:15:38] grandparents he said he' visit the
[1:15:40] iniquity of the children to the third
[1:15:43] and fourth generation I don't know but
[1:15:46] whatever it is God can reveal it now
[1:15:48] watch there's a child there before him
[1:15:50] that has an Affliction and brother
[1:15:53] random is saying the Poss abilities of
[1:15:55] what it could be that it might be for
[1:15:58] the glory of God of course in St John
[1:16:00] 9:31 we know that or it could be that a
[1:16:03] grandparent did something wrong and it
[1:16:06] was not made right he said I don't know
[1:16:10] so what's he waiting on he's waiting on
[1:16:12] Clarity from the father to know how to
[1:16:16] handle this watch's this again in
[1:16:19] Hebrews your attitude towards
[1:16:23] Christ was will make a great
[1:16:28] impression on what your children will
[1:16:34] be do you understand tonight if it was
[1:16:37] not for the grace of
[1:16:39] God some of the lives that many of our
[1:16:42] parents have lived there ain't no
[1:16:44] telling what in the world we'd be that's
[1:16:47] right come on say
[1:16:50] Amen my mom and daddy never knew the
[1:16:52] truth of the message of the hour so what
[1:16:54] did they sow they SED Pentecost that's
[1:16:56] all they know to
[1:16:58] do many of you your parents weren't even
[1:17:02] Christians and they've done this and
[1:17:04] that and the other and you think God
[1:17:06] what what what in the world am I going
[1:17:08] through and you want to blame God many
[1:17:10] times for the trials and things you're
[1:17:12] going through that if we had a prophet
[1:17:14] here' be able to point out to us it
[1:17:16] ain't God trying you it's because your
[1:17:18] daddy did this and your mama did that
[1:17:21] and your grandma did that and your
[1:17:23] grandfather did that but you what Satan
[1:17:25] wants to do he always wants to point
[1:17:28] everything bad that you go through up
[1:17:31] this way so you'll blame
[1:17:33] god well come on somebody I've done come
[1:17:36] to realize a lot of what I go through
[1:17:39] ain't really got a whole lot to do with
[1:17:41] my father it's got more to do probably
[1:17:43] with my mama and my daddy and my grandpa
[1:17:47] and my uncles and my aunts Lord have
[1:17:49] mercy it's a wonder I am an absolute
[1:17:51] outright Heathen it's the grace of God
[1:17:54] that I'm saved tonight I'm going to say
[1:17:56] it for the rest of you little angels
[1:17:58] that think you're so sweet and so
[1:18:00] honeyfi if it wasn't for the grace of
[1:18:03] God there wouldn't be a one of us in
[1:18:04] this building that wouldn't be nothing
[1:18:06] but a rotten sorry Outcast a bunch of
[1:18:10] unbelievers come on church or a bunch of
[1:18:13] cold dead church members but the grace
[1:18:15] of God has intervened on our behalf not
[1:18:19] because we're worthy not because we are
[1:18:22] deserving but amazing Gra Grace how
[1:18:25] sweet to
[1:18:28] sound oh
[1:18:31] my Lord
[1:18:34] Jesus help us
[1:18:36] father oh Lord God listen you young
[1:18:40] people today I don't know whether you
[1:18:42] come to this church or whether you come
[1:18:45] you young boys and girls did you
[1:18:48] realize the things that you're
[1:18:53] doing if there is another generation
[1:18:56] your children will be
[1:19:02] judged for what you
[1:19:05] do but you see it's this idea of leer de
[1:19:08] seea I do what I want to do what I do
[1:19:12] don't affect nobody you just
[1:19:21] lied it does affect other people
[1:19:29] praise the
[1:19:31] lord well after this service tonight we
[1:19:33] ought to have some of the best people in
[1:19:35] Carter County and Washington and
[1:19:37] Sullivan and unoy and every other County
[1:19:40] in Tennessee my goodness just for the
[1:19:43] sake of wanting to make it easy on your
[1:19:44] kids I wish my parents had made a little
[1:19:46] bit easier on
[1:19:48] me y'all believe this right okay all
[1:19:52] right now notice oh my Lord did you
[1:19:56] realize the things that you're doing if
[1:19:58] there's another generation your children
[1:20:01] will be judged for what you do hav you
[1:20:05] no respect or
[1:20:07] decency you girls out here wearing these
[1:20:10] little old shorts and things around you
[1:20:12] know that's reflecting on your
[1:20:19] daughter so there was some of these
[1:20:21] little girls young women that he was
[1:20:23] talking to wasn't even married yet they
[1:20:27] didn't even have no
[1:20:30] kids but they were setting the pattern
[1:20:33] for the what the girls was going to
[1:20:36] do now friends who would have ever
[1:20:39] thought who would have ever thought that
[1:20:42] in the United States of
[1:20:44] America that we would come to a spot to
[1:20:47] where that our L leaders in our
[1:20:49] government would put tampons in a men's
[1:20:53] bathroom right
[1:20:55] yeah who would have ever thought that
[1:20:57] this transgender thing and I I'm sure
[1:20:59] that you've noticed it that for several
[1:21:02] years it was a gay lesbian deal that was
[1:21:05] the preeminent thing but if you noticed
[1:21:08] in the last few years what is actually
[1:21:10] dominated over the top of that is
[1:21:13] actually the transgender move there's
[1:21:15] actually some of the gay and lesbian
[1:21:17] people that really don't go along with
[1:21:20] this transgender thing because it's
[1:21:23] overshadowed
[1:21:24] their
[1:21:25] move it's actually overshadowed it and
[1:21:29] they really don't like it so I mean you
[1:21:32] got a man that walks into a woman's
[1:21:34] bathroom you've got a man that wants to
[1:21:37] put on a pair of boxing gloves that's
[1:21:39] born a biological males he his former
[1:21:42] legs look like a gorilla and his chest
[1:21:45] look like a gorilla and he had a big old
[1:21:47] husky voice like that and I he's squeaky
[1:21:50] like this and he wants to get out there
[1:21:52] and find a girl in the rain you love all
[1:21:55] down
[1:21:56] scoundrel you you can't beat a man
[1:22:00] in your game so you got to get in there
[1:22:03] whoop up on a
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:09] woman and our government from the White
[1:22:12] House Down will answer to almighty
[1:22:17] God for what they've brought our nation
[1:22:19] to not only America but the world come
[1:22:23] on don't get quiet on me
[1:22:26] Church Lord have mercy if we go on a few
[1:22:29] more years what will it
[1:22:33] be Whoever thought you would go into a
[1:22:36] Walmart or Lord of Mercy even worse than
[1:22:38] that going to a restaurant and the thing
[1:22:41] comes up to take your order with pink
[1:22:47] fingernails and you can tell by looking
[1:22:49] at it what it
[1:22:52] is don't start try to look at me like
[1:22:54] yall are ignorant that they're around
[1:22:55] Tri Cities
[1:22:57] everywhere but of course we can't say
[1:23:00] nothing about it ah I don't fit in that
[1:23:03] category I still can say something about
[1:23:06] it cuz I'm called to preach the
[1:23:10] gospel
[1:23:13] amen oh I know all the pronouns and we
[1:23:17] don't like the he and the she and this
[1:23:18] and that my Bible tells me male and
[1:23:23] female create did he them and call their
[1:23:27] name Adam there is only two genders in
[1:23:31] the Bible I don't care what the
[1:23:33] scientists say I don't care what the
[1:23:36] Democrats say or the Liberal Republicans
[1:23:40] say according to almighty God there's
[1:23:43] only two genders and that's male and
[1:23:46] female anything other then that is a
[1:23:50] perversion and will go to hell
[1:24:03] so can you imagine two gay men adopting
[1:24:06] a child or two lesbian women adopting a
[1:24:10] child and raising a child in that type
[1:24:13] of
[1:24:14] environment and what will that child be
[1:24:17] and the other one and the other
[1:24:20] one it's not too hard to tell God's
[1:24:23] original seat
[1:24:26] cuzz God's original can always reproduce
[1:24:29] itself after its own kind so let's put
[1:24:33] two lisbians together and let them
[1:24:35] fulfill Genesis one let every seed bring
[1:24:38] forth after its kind or let's put two
[1:24:41] men together and let them reproduce
[1:24:43] let's put two transgenders or 42
[1:24:46] whichever way you want to do it and
[1:24:48] let's watch them reproduce God's word
[1:24:50] they cannot and they never will amen
[1:24:54] well
[1:24:55] glory to God and right in the middle of
[1:24:58] hell right in the middle of all this sin
[1:25:02] and debauchery that's going on God is
[1:25:05] saying I will produce a bride that will
[1:25:09] stand upon my word out of Leia out of
[1:25:14] Darkness that people don't even know if
[1:25:16] they're a man or a woman anymore and
[1:25:18] they're mutilating little five and six
[1:25:21] year old kids what in the world is wrong
[1:25:25] with this nation the damn nation of God
[1:25:28] awaits it come on Sheldon somebody say
[1:25:31] Amen Let hell know where you stand
[1:25:34] tonight let Heaven know where you
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:25:50] stand well if I get killed after this
[1:25:53] service it's been good knowing you
[1:25:55] all if this is my last sermon to preach
[1:25:59] I guess I can go out with a blaze of
[1:26:00] glory can
[1:26:02] I your children will be judged for what
[1:26:05] you
[1:26:07] do haven't you no respect or decency you
[1:26:11] girls out there wearing these little old
[1:26:12] shorts and things around you know that's
[1:26:15] reflecting on your
[1:26:17] daughter did you know your
[1:26:20] grandmom was a
[1:26:22] Flopper and your
[1:26:25] mmy this is Harvard terminology in case
[1:26:28] you didn't know it your mamy of course
[1:26:32] girl that's the reason you're a strip
[1:26:34] teas
[1:26:37] today certainly what will your children
[1:26:41] be God said it visit the iniquity of the
[1:26:44] parents upon the children and their
[1:26:46] children to three and four generation
[1:26:48] now let's not leave it out yonder what
[1:26:50] about our message
[1:26:52] churches preacher start start adding
[1:26:54] here and taking away there oh and the
[1:26:56] first generation they may not see much
[1:26:58] of a fact but watch the second
[1:27:00] generation some of them younger men
[1:27:02] sitting in these message churches to
[1:27:04] start hybridizing the message of the
[1:27:05] hour take away a little he and take away
[1:27:08] I told you the other day I sat down and
[1:27:10] started just making a list of different
[1:27:12] preachers that I know of and churches
[1:27:13] that I know of in the message that don't
[1:27:15] preach this the way the prophet taught
[1:27:17] it and they don't preach this the way
[1:27:19] the prophet taught it and that the way
[1:27:20] the prophet taught it I thought Lord
[1:27:22] have mercy what's it going to be what's
[1:27:24] it going to be for the young preachers
[1:27:25] sitting there in their church and they
[1:27:27] hear their their grandpa or their uncles
[1:27:29] or you know whoever it is teaching it
[1:27:31] and then them young guys are going to
[1:27:33] get up and they're always going to do
[1:27:34] less they're always going to add more or
[1:27:37] take more from it what's it going to be
[1:27:39] if the Lord carries another 10 or 15
[1:27:41] years will Holiness be accepted in the
[1:27:43] message churches will we even want the
[1:27:46] new birth anymore or will we want to
[1:27:48] just a cold dry-eyed confession well I
[1:27:50] believe God sent a prophet every devil
[1:27:53] in hell believes
[1:27:54] you've got to be born again you've got
[1:27:57] to be filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:59] that nature of the world has got to
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:10] dieo did you realize my brother every
[1:28:14] time you do that which is
[1:28:19] right that will be
[1:28:22] visited on your
[1:28:26] children now see this is not just SE the
[1:28:28] negative
[1:28:29] side it's SE the positive
[1:28:36] side simply friends all God wants you to
[1:28:39] do it's just change the things you're
[1:28:42] doing learn how to use his law for yours
[1:28:46] and your children and your
[1:28:48] grandchildren's
[1:28:50] advantage it's going to work whether or
[1:28:53] not you think about it it's going to
[1:28:55] work either way but Brother David we
[1:28:58] have a
[1:28:59] choice we have a choice brother na we
[1:29:02] have a choice my brothers and
[1:29:05] sisters which way do we want to use this
[1:29:07] law of
[1:29:11] God my
[1:29:13] my I might have to cut it short tonight
[1:29:16] I'm not sure if y'all can take his full
[1:29:17] term to that or not and people today the
[1:29:20] teenagers out in high school with beer
[1:29:22] parties and drink
[1:29:25] and living and little girls living in
[1:29:26] adultery and little boys and things like
[1:29:29] that what kind of a generation's coming
[1:29:32] up after this what makes these little
[1:29:34] girls act like
[1:29:36] that their
[1:29:38] mommy was a
[1:29:41] flaer their grandmam was a chorus girl
[1:29:45] and he said he'd visit the iniquity of
[1:29:46] the parents upon the children and
[1:29:48] children's children to the third and
[1:29:50] fourth generation what can you expect
[1:29:55] anymore you would not believe some of
[1:29:58] the
[1:29:59] stories that I have heard from some of
[1:30:01] our sisters who are in public school
[1:30:04] what they see and what they have to deal
[1:30:07] with I'm talking about teachers and
[1:30:09] those that work in cooking and so on and
[1:30:11] so on
[1:30:15] unbelievable where does it come from
[1:30:18] their mothers the
[1:30:21] grandmothers brother Donny does it apply
[1:30:24] spiritual it
[1:30:26] does so Abraham went and fought a war
[1:30:29] one day on the direction of
[1:30:32] God and he comes
[1:30:35] back to his tent to refresh
[1:30:39] himself and here this man
[1:30:43] being Supernatural person shows up by
[1:30:47] the
[1:30:48] name of
[1:30:51] MDC and served Abraham
[1:30:55] communion and Abraham paid him
[1:31:00] tithes and
[1:31:02] God allocated him paying
[1:31:06] tie to
[1:31:11] Levi out of Abraham came Isaac out of
[1:31:15] Isaac came Jacob out of Jacob came
[1:31:19] Levi fourth
[1:31:22] generation and it was this if though
[1:31:25] L paid
[1:31:27] ties to
[1:31:31] MDC praise be to
[1:31:34] God so friends we don't want to do right
[1:31:37] just for the natural reward now we're
[1:31:39] not just doing right for
[1:31:42] ourselves we're doing right for our
[1:31:44] future posterity if there is none I want
[1:31:46] to do it if there ain't no
[1:31:48] tomorrow but when you think of it this
[1:31:51] way that what I do the way our church
[1:31:53] goes the way you all go can affect
[1:31:56] future
[1:32:00] Generations oh
[1:32:03] my what you do if there is a coming
[1:32:09] tomorrow if you have a great
[1:32:13] grandson your action
[1:32:16] today will determine what he'll be then
[1:32:25] wow a great
[1:32:31] grandson watch this in the rising of the
[1:32:34] sun he's talking about the seal the
[1:32:36] spirit of God and the abstract coming
[1:32:38] back on the title deed when the Holy
[1:32:40] Ghost come it was the abstract that
[1:32:42] everything against me whether my mother
[1:32:44] done it my father done it my grandmother
[1:32:47] done it like this epileptic child I
[1:32:51] prayed for a few minutes ago
[1:32:54] that come through from the
[1:32:59] grandparents the epilepsy fell
[1:33:04] down
[1:33:07] upon the
[1:33:16] child if God don't
[1:33:20] stop
[1:33:22] Humanity the Earth
[1:33:25] will be
[1:33:28] annihilated the Bible tells us a Child
[1:33:30] Left to
[1:33:32] itself will bring its mother
[1:33:36] shame
[1:33:38] right so if preachers quit spanking
[1:33:43] people and leave the children
[1:33:47] sheep to go back to the Book of Judges
[1:33:49] and every man does that which is right
[1:33:52] in his own eyes
[1:33:55] I cannot imagine what word of life would
[1:33:57] turn
[1:33:59] into in a few years I cannot imagine
[1:34:03] what evening like Tabernacle in Len
[1:34:05] Louisiana would turn into Lighthouse for
[1:34:09] Jesus all these other churches around
[1:34:12] the world if men of God would let up on
[1:34:16] preaching
[1:34:17] hard and just let the people do whatever
[1:34:20] they want to do and let them start
[1:34:22] sewing and sewing you understand all
[1:34:25] these people that have pulled away from
[1:34:26] the
[1:34:27] message you understand what they're
[1:34:29] doing it's not just what they're doing
[1:34:31] to
[1:34:32] themselves it's what they're doing to
[1:34:34] their
[1:34:35] children and their
[1:34:38] grandchildren so these folks have pull
[1:34:40] away from the message in life of brother
[1:34:42] RAM and call him a false prophet and
[1:34:44] call you and I all these terrible things
[1:34:46] that they call us can you imagine what
[1:34:47] the children are going to call us I can
[1:34:50] tell you for the people around the
[1:34:51] message that don't believe in Preachers
[1:34:53] you'd not believe some of the preacher
[1:34:55] jokes I have heard from the tape
[1:35:01] people and say they're following brother
[1:35:03] brandham brother brandham never seed any
[1:35:05] such Tommy
[1:35:07] rot but can you imagine what the
[1:35:09] children are going to be and what their
[1:35:11] grandchildren are going to
[1:35:18] be let's
[1:35:21] stand if you ain't able you and just
[1:35:24] said to her while I
[1:35:26] finish y'all okay can you can you get up
[1:35:30] kind of leaned against a chair there and
[1:35:31] get your balance there you go brother
[1:35:32] Rob just put both hands there bu Sister
[1:35:35] Sarah put your arm around him there and
[1:35:37] kind of help him a
[1:35:39] little oh
[1:35:41] my
[1:35:43] woo I brought about 48 pages to church
[1:35:46] tonight cuz I just thought was going to
[1:35:48] Breeze through this bad part first I
[1:35:50] didn't realize he was going to slow me
[1:35:52] down to Grandma gear on on this not even
[1:35:54] let us get to the good
[1:35:56] part so apparently either somebody here
[1:36:00] present or somebody streaming this
[1:36:03] needed to hear this really emphasized on
[1:36:15] tonight now Lord well in this is the
[1:36:18] direction we'll go next Wednesday night
[1:36:20] spoken words Original Seed God made
[1:36:22] every seed after its kind that's
[1:36:27] his then when he made his Man In His
[1:36:31] Image was a
[1:36:33] seed of his
[1:36:35] word and when Jesus has made flesh the
[1:36:39] Flesh of the word of God and when we
[1:36:42] receive the word of God then we become
[1:36:46] God's
[1:36:48] word in our
[1:36:51] flesh see the church
[1:36:54] should
[1:36:55] be in that
[1:36:59] condition so you see what the bride will
[1:37:01] be when God brings her to the finale at
[1:37:04] the end time out of her Union with
[1:37:07] Christ Jesus and the progeny out of that
[1:37:11] Union you what it'll produce the
[1:37:13] resurrection and the next phase will be
[1:37:16] the
[1:37:17] Millennium it will bring forth of its
[1:37:21] kind seed
[1:37:24] word don't you love
[1:37:27] him let's bow our heads
[1:37:33] together oh
[1:37:37] Jesus I'm sure there's more people in
[1:37:39] here tonight other than
[1:37:43] myself that wish we would have heard
[1:37:45] these types of
[1:37:47] things years
[1:37:51] ago we would have sowed a lot different
[1:37:56] Lord father we cannot go backwards and
[1:38:00] tear out any bad seed or any
[1:38:04] wrongdoing but what we can do father
[1:38:09] is so so many good
[1:38:12] seeds that they just overwhelm our
[1:38:17] garden Lord as a preacher I realize I
[1:38:19] have such a responsibility as every
[1:38:22] other preacher does but especially
[1:38:25] pastors evangelists come in and they
[1:38:28] have an influence
[1:38:31] surely I noticed it when I was in
[1:38:33] Pentecost that the mainstream of what it
[1:38:36] seemed like with the groups anyway that
[1:38:38] we were
[1:38:39] with the men of the hour seemed to be
[1:38:42] like the traveling
[1:38:44] evangelist and they were the ones that
[1:38:46] people would go here so
[1:38:49] much when I came to the message and been
[1:38:52] in it now for over 40
[1:38:55] years and especially noticing in the
[1:38:57] last 5 years or so that seems to be the
[1:39:01] aspect of the ministry now that is so
[1:39:04] shaping the mindset of the
[1:39:07] message it's not evangelist like it was
[1:39:10] in
[1:39:11] Pentecost but it's more so the
[1:39:14] pastors and especially if they stream or
[1:39:17] Facebook or YouTube or whatever it is
[1:39:19] that they
[1:39:21] do and then they are the one on who
[1:39:23] begin
[1:39:24] to
[1:39:27] shape the mindset of the
[1:39:29] people and then as many Youth Services
[1:39:32] as we have and we get some of these
[1:39:35] traveling pastors that will travel
[1:39:36] around and they want to bring their
[1:39:39] agenda to the
[1:39:41] youth and they are reshaping the
[1:39:44] minds of the
[1:39:47] youth and they're
[1:39:49] changing the aspect of the message the
[1:39:52] focus
[1:39:55] God I pray you'd help each each
[1:39:58] preacher to realize we have to answer to
[1:40:03] you so if I were to die tonight and this
[1:40:07] church will go on because I believe it's
[1:40:08] your
[1:40:09] church and I'm totally replaceable I
[1:40:12] know
[1:40:14] that so then whoever would step in here
[1:40:17] Lord they would have a maybe a different
[1:40:20] burden a different Vision somewhat but
[1:40:22] surely the people would not put a man in
[1:40:24] here unless they felt like it was a man
[1:40:26] saying what God's Prophet
[1:40:29] said but the leaders are the ones that
[1:40:32] can shape the direction that we go if
[1:40:36] people could only
[1:40:37] realize how they need to pray for their
[1:40:41] leaders way more than they
[1:40:44] do but dear God not only for the
[1:40:48] preachers but the single men that are
[1:40:50] here
[1:40:51] tonight the things that are doing if you
[1:40:54] T and they get married in a few years
[1:40:56] and to their Union you gr a little
[1:40:59] boy through four years that little boy
[1:41:02] start picking up certain things may
[1:41:05] every young man here tonight realize
[1:41:08] what he's doing the way he's living the
[1:41:10] habits that he has can affect his
[1:41:15] children
[1:41:17] grandchildren and even great
[1:41:21] grandchildren oh Lord God
[1:41:25] that's why I believe that there will be
[1:41:27] a
[1:41:28] bride that will be just as true to this
[1:41:31] word as your Prophet was when he
[1:41:33] preached it years and years
[1:41:36] ago because the seeds that were sown
[1:41:40] were pure unadulterated bride
[1:41:43] word so it come from one generation to
[1:41:46] another we've had all kinds of men and
[1:41:48] all types of ideologies rais up and it's
[1:41:51] evident what we produced it's evident
[1:41:55] because they're more like the man who
[1:41:56] founded this new move and they're like
[1:41:58] him and like this man and that man and
[1:42:00] another man and they make Idols out of
[1:42:02] the
[1:42:03] preachers Lord we don't want to make no
[1:42:05] Idol out of no
[1:42:06] preacher we want you to be the only one
[1:42:09] that we
[1:42:11] worship so father help us to look at it
[1:42:14] tonight in a double way that as a church
[1:42:18] we're sewing
[1:42:20] seeds but as individuals
[1:42:23] these sisters and they may not totally
[1:42:26] understand well why can't I wear this
[1:42:27] and why can't I dress this way why can't
[1:42:30] I do that and what's wrong with me just
[1:42:32] cutting my hair a little bit I've still
[1:42:34] got long hair what difference would an
[1:42:35] inch make or or two inches what
[1:42:37] difference would would just a little bit
[1:42:39] of makeup Mi she don't
[1:42:41] realize that she may start out with a
[1:42:43] little bit but her daughter will wear
[1:42:47] more and then a granddaughter will wear
[1:42:51] even
[1:42:52] more so a young man will look at a
[1:42:54] website that's not becoming to a Son of
[1:42:56] God to look at and he may well you know
[1:42:59] it's okay I've got it under control and
[1:43:01] then he gets married and he has a son
[1:43:03] and his son goes to feed him this pull
[1:43:06] it's Indescribable to him he don't even
[1:43:08] know why he's feeding it toward things
[1:43:10] that are not right I wonder if his daddy
[1:43:13] ain't to blame for
[1:43:16] it help us
[1:43:19] Jesus help us
[1:43:21] Jesus but when we also come back to the
[1:43:24] positive side of this to know Satan has
