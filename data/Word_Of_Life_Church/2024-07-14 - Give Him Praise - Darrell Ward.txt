[40:01] recounting of what God has done for us
[40:04] praise and thanksgiving go hand in hand

[40:21] morning that's true friends we don't
[40:23] serve a dead God we don't serve a god of
[40:25] wood we don't serve a god of someone's
[40:27] imagination but we serve the Living God
[40:29] today amen who can do all things who can
[40:32] do great things who has never forgot one
[40:34] promise that he's made and the prophet
[40:36] of God said he can't make a promise that
[40:38] he's not able to keep this morning
[40:40] that's the god that we serve today no
[40:42] matter what the world does no matter the
[40:43] condition of the world no matter what
[40:45] Satan tries to do we serve a God who can
[40:48] not fail amen amen the Bible says this
[40:52] or the prophet says this in the message
[40:53] of pma's vision he said have you ever
[40:55] noticed how the world gets into the
[40:57] spirit of the things that are in the
[40:59] world they go to their ball games their
[41:01] sporting events and their dances they
[41:04] dinner they enter into the spirit of it
[41:07] they don't sit there like a
[41:09] Wallflower or old dried up sticks they
[41:13] enter right into the fill of things and
[41:16] become a part of things and let me say
[41:18] this morning that's my desire I just
[41:20] don't want to come to church and be a a
[41:22] spectator but I want to come and be a
[41:25] participator I just don't want to come
[41:26] and see what's happening I want to come
[41:28] because I am what's happening is that
[41:31] all right this morning I want to come
[41:33] and get into the spirit of things I want
[41:34] to be a part of things that when I leave
[41:36] here I can say I sweated as much as the
[41:38] preacher I Ain mad as much as the
[41:40] preacher I got involved as much as the
[41:42] preacher because I want to be a part of
[41:44] it amen like the men that come to church
[41:47] one time he was deaf and and he was Dumb
[41:48] and they asked him in Braille he was
[41:50] blind and he he couldn't hear they said
[41:52] why do you even come to church why do
[41:54] you even bring your Bible and he
[41:56] answered back he said because I want the
[41:58] devil to know whose side that I'm on and
[42:00] when I leave this building this morning
[42:02] I want the devil to know whose side that
[42:04] I am on Amen I want even to know that I
[42:06] lift my voice to praise my God to let my
[42:08] God know I thank you for healing me I
[42:10] thank you for saving me I thank you for
[42:12] all that you've done for me amen the
[42:15] world goes to ball games they scream and
[42:17] they shout and they jump and they beat
[42:19] each other on the head and they do c
[42:24] wheels and it's sad to say but
[42:26] Christians It Go the ball games will act
[42:28] the same way and then come to church and
[42:30] set like they're
[42:32] dead but I say if you can do it at a
[42:35] ball game you really ought to be able to
[42:36] do it in
[42:40] church
[42:42] amen
[42:44] amen amen they enter right into the fill
[42:46] of things and they became a part of it
[42:48] oh God let me become a part of it he
[42:51] said but oh how they hate the
[42:53] Christians think of that for getting
[42:56] into the Spirit of God's word they call
[42:59] us
[43:00] Fanatics Holy Rollers there is nothing
[43:03] that they won't do to show their
[43:08] disapproval right their hatred and
[43:12] there's nothing that they won't do to
[43:13] show their hatred and their disapproval
[43:16] so you know we're living in a time of
[43:18] political correctness when everybody
[43:20] wants to be politically correct so you
[43:23] know if us getting into the spirit of
[43:25] worship and US praising God and us
[43:27] lifting up our voices and and that
[43:29] offends them maybe we should
[43:32] just settle
[43:34] down just look at one another and Nod
[43:37] our head every once in a while and so
[43:39] they'll still know we're
[43:40] alive sir you think that's what we are
[43:42] to do well here's what the prophet said
[43:44] to do okay when they show their hatred
[43:46] and their disapproval here's what the
[43:48] prophet said to do he said ignore
[43:50] it ignore that you can expect it knowing
[43:54] where it's coming from on
[43:57] so what are we supposed to do just go on
[43:59] and get into the spirit of worship our
[44:02] spirit is clean it is fresh it is real
[44:05] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[44:08] full of the joy of the Lord the
[44:12] Christian ought to be just as exuberant
[44:14] and full of his pleasure in the Lord as
[44:15] the world is when it savors and delights
[44:17] in its pleasure both Christians and the
[44:20] world are
[44:23] human both have emotions
[44:27] amen oh yes you do amen you may sit dead
[44:31] in church but you hit your big toe going
[44:33] to bed you do have
[44:35] emotions oh yeah you do I know that's
[44:37] true amen both have emotions the
[44:40] difference is the Christian's heart and
[44:42] emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory
[44:44] and his love while the world satisfies
[44:48] the flesh that's right and let me say
[44:50] that's what I I'm I'm talking about this
[44:51] morning I'm not talking about something
[44:53] that satisfies the flesh I'm not talking
[44:55] about something that'll goore of the
[44:57] flesh I'm not talking about something
[44:59] that just works on my emotions you say
[45:01] well what are you talking about I'm
[45:02] talking about just loving to love
[45:05] God just to thank him and love him and
[45:07] rejoice because there is no God like our
[45:11] god oh you say let me tell you the
[45:13] devil's going to try to tell you that
[45:15] you're going to get into the flesh but
[45:16] listen to me I ain't worried about
[45:18] getting in the flesh I want to get out
[45:20] of
[45:21] it amen oh you know you're just going to
[45:24] get into the flesh you're just going to
[45:26] get caught up you're just going to be a
[45:27] fanatic or if you praise God before
[45:29] there's one sign of healing then you're
[45:31] lying because you're really still sick
[45:34] Bo let me tell the devil this morning
[45:36] he's the liar and whether I have a
[45:39] symptom or whether I don't have a
[45:40] symptom it has nothing to do with my
[45:42] healing I'm not healed because I feel
[45:44] like it I'm not saved because I feel
[45:46] like it come on somebody but I am saved
[45:48] according to God's word this
[45:52] morning amen well if you testify if you
[45:55] praise God for your healing you still
[45:56] got symptoms you're lying no that's just
[45:58] the devil trying to dampen down your
[46:00] spirit that's trying the devil just
[46:02] trying to cool you off but I say just go
[46:04] on and get into the spirit of worship
[46:06] just start praising God for all that
[46:08] he's done for
[46:10] you oh let me be like Joshua who March
[46:13] through on the walls of Jericho before
[46:15] one rock ever fell out of that wall they
[46:17] were shouting the
[46:19] victory shouting the victory why because
[46:22] he was looking at the Unseen it was a
[46:24] promise that God made am well the wall
[46:27] was so thick and the wall was so high it
[46:30] don't matter how thick it is it don't
[46:32] matter how high it is if God has
[46:33] promised the victory you get the victory
[46:37] amen he wasn't looking at the walls he
[46:40] was looking at the promise that God made
[46:43] oh I say this morning how much can you

[46:58] evidence but solely based upon the word
[47:00] of
[47:01] God Amen walking around shouting the
[47:05] victory because God gave the promise and
[47:07] his promise cannot fail amen when you

[47:15] begins to pulsate I am the Lord who
[47:18] heals all thy diseases how many
[47:21] diseases how many then when the doctor
[47:24] says it's incurable who's right who's
[47:26] wrong
[47:28] God's always
[47:30] right amen I'm the Lord who heals all
[47:33] thy diseases when you can see that not
[47:36] with the eyes of your
[47:37] head but with the eyes of your heart
[47:40] when you look with the eyes of your
[47:42] heart everything else just weakens away
[47:45] but you've got to get into the spirit of
[47:47] the
[47:50] word if you don't get into the spirit of
[47:52] the word you don't see nothing you'll
[47:54] see your symptoms you'll see your
[47:55] problems but if if you can get into the
[47:58] spirit of the word the spirit that wrote
[48:01] that word if you can get into that
[48:03] Spirit it will reveal that word that's

[52:26] the prophet said I believe there
[52:27] wouldn't be one feeble person Among Us

[52:51] live this message I say why not us are
[52:54] we Believers are we the children of God
[52:57] did he give us the promise then what are
[53:00] we worried about well the doctor said
[53:02] this and the doctor said that but they
[53:04] can't be wrong but God's word is always
[53:09] right why not us why not
[53:13] now David was anointed by a great
[53:17] prophet
[53:18] Samuel to be
[53:21] king God sent a prophet with a message
[53:24] to David to tell David who he was and
[53:28] what he was going to
[53:29] do don't that sound kind of familiar God
[53:33] sent a prophet messenger with the
[53:35] message to tell David who he
[53:37] was and what he was going to
[53:42] do oh God now David I was looking I
[53:47] never realized I just got to thinking I
[53:48] was looking but most Scholars say David
[53:50] was between the ages of 10 and 15 year
[53:53] old when Samuel anointed
[53:57] him it was just a
[54:00] kid now this kid David as brother Jeremy
[54:04] sang about a youth a boy stands before a
[54:09] Giant
[54:10] Goliath who is 9 foot 9 in
[54:18] tall and Saul tells
[54:21] David he said you're just a youth his
[54:25] own is old leadership trying to
[54:29] discourage him from standing on what God
[54:32] told
[54:34] him on sa said look look look just calm
[54:37] down you you're just a youth you're
[54:39] you're a kid and this man here he's been
[54:42] a warrior since do you see his
[54:46] [Music]
[54:47] trophies he's a champion he ain't just a
[54:50] fighter he's a champion he's got
[54:53] trophies and he's been a warrior since
[54:56] his Youth and you are just a
[55:00] youth but the giant that stood before
[55:03] David didn't see the god that stood
[55:06] behind
[55:07] him if he
[55:09] did if he did Goliath would have been on
[55:11] his
[55:14] knees for God do said to David you would
[55:17] reign as king and David said how can I
[55:21] die by the hand of a giant as a boy and
[55:24] still reign as a king right it's
[55:27] impossible you can't do both so what did
[55:30] David do he didn't look at the fear he
[55:33] didn't look at the size he didn't look
[55:34] at the ability he didn't look at the
[55:36] warrior he didn't look at the situation
[55:39] he looked at God's
[55:41] word that God sent a prophet with a
[55:44] message to tell me I would reign as king
[55:47] and God has sent a prophet with a
[55:48] message to tell you you are the bride of
[55:51] Christ
[55:57] oh God how simple but how
[56:01] great amen so what did David do he took
[56:05] God at his word as far as the word was
[56:08] concerned Goliath was
[56:11] defeated before the battle ever
[56:16] started David said the Lord is my
[56:18] strength and my shield my heart trusted
[56:21] in him I am help therefore my heart
[56:23] greatly rejoice and with my song and
[56:26] with my song I will praise Him David
[56:30] also said I will call on the Lord who is
[56:32] worthy to be praised so shall I be saved
[56:36] from my
[56:38] enemies I will call upon my God who is
[56:42] worthy Hallelujah to be praised and so
[56:45] shall I be saved from my enemies amen
[56:50] well I tell you brother darl if I was
[56:52] wealthy I'd praise God if I had no
[56:54] worries I'd praise God if I was healthy
[56:57] I'd praise God well those are all good
[56:59] things to praise God for I'm sure amen
[57:02] every one of those is a good reason to
[57:04] give God praise but the only problem
[57:07] with that is the Bible says let
[57:09] everything that hath breath praise you
[57:12] the Lord then what does that tell me let
[57:15] the sad man yes sir let the happy man
[57:19] let the poor man well it get too many
[57:22] amens out of that let the rich man let
[57:25] the sick man let the Healthy Man let the
[57:28] man on the mountain let the man in the
[57:30] valley let everything young and old male
[57:33] and female let everything that have
[57:35] breath regardless of the condition you
[57:38] find yourself in let everything praise
[57:41] ye the
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:45] Lord Brother darl is there any scripture
[57:49] in the Bible that gives me a right not
[57:51] to praise
[57:52] God well I'm glad you asked that
[57:56] because there
[57:58] is if you want an excuse not to praise
[58:01] God there is a scripture for
[58:07] it you believe
[58:09] me so if you don't want to praise God I
[58:13] do have an excuse for you you'll find it
[58:15] in Psalms
[58:16] 115 verse 17 and the Bible says the dead
[58:22] praise not the Lord okay
[58:30] neither do any that go down in
[58:33] silence amen so if you ain't breathing
[58:36] this morning you're
[58:38] excused but if you're
[58:40] breathing
[58:42] right and you want to obey
[58:46] God I don't feel he never said did you
[58:48] feel
[58:50] it if you've got breath the Bible said
[58:53] praise ye the Lord
[58:57] let me tell you this morning I've come
[58:59] for one purpose I ain't come to complain
[59:01] I didn't come to find fault I didn't
[59:03] come to sleep I didn't come to sit on
[59:05] the
[59:06] Pew but I come for one purpose this
[59:09] morning like those mag who said they
[59:11] traveled over two years they went over
[59:13] mountains they went through valleys they
[59:15] took the chance of being robbed but they
[59:17] said we have seen his star and we have
[59:21] come to worship Him and I've come for
[59:24] one purpose this morning not to be seen

[59:38] praise the

[1:06:44] his presence for the Bible said he
[1:06:46] inhabits the praise of
[1:06:49] Israel God inhabits the praise of his
[1:06:52] people and when we begin to praise him
[1:06:54] it is a gate in into his
[1:06:59] presence
[1:07:01] Hallelujah with your backs against the
[1:07:03] wall and it seems there's no way through
[1:07:06] and Satan's got you cut off I want you

[1:07:17] gate and step through into his
[1:07:23] presence amen

[1:07:29] like sometimes you know people they'll
[1:07:31] pray almost to their breakthrough and
[1:07:34] then they stop but if you'll just press
[1:07:36] on and get into the spirit it becomes so
[1:07:39] different when you
[1:07:40] pray amen a lot of times I put on soft
[1:07:43] music because it creates an atmosphere
[1:07:46] and it's all about getting into to that
[1:07:49] atmosphere it's a gate that you can step
[1:07:53] through amen
[1:07:57] amen you say you got look at Paul and
[1:08:02] Silas they were in
[1:08:04] prison they were cold hungry sore beaten
[1:08:10] blooded
[1:08:13] chained
[1:08:15] amen come on and Silas might have said
[1:08:19] pa what are we going to
[1:08:22] do and Paul you know he looked around
[1:08:26] he might have said something you know
[1:08:28] this looks like a good place to have
[1:08:35] church because you see whether you're on
[1:08:37] a mountain or whether you're in a prison
[1:08:39] a Son of God can worship God
[1:08:44] anywhere the Bible says to appoint unto
[1:08:46] them that mourn and Zion to give them
[1:08:48] Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for
[1:08:51] mourning the Garment of Praise for the
[1:08:53] spirit of heaviness that they may be
[1:08:55] called the Trees of Righteousness that
[1:08:57] the planting of the Lord that he might
[1:09:00] be
[1:09:01] glorified a Garment of Praise for
[1:09:05] heaviness and here they are cold hungry
[1:09:08] beaten
[1:09:09] blooded and Paul might have said give me
[1:09:13] a seed for
[1:09:16] Christ I'm one of them I'm one of them
[1:09:20] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:09:23] them I'm one of them
[1:09:26] I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can
[1:09:29] say I'm one of
[1:09:32] them about three cells down you know
[1:09:35] some prisoner with the Grumps that hey
[1:09:38] don't you know we're in prison don't you

[1:09:47] bit we got to be moreful a little
[1:09:50] bit s m said my goodness Bo we offended

[1:10:23] that where with s
[1:10:28] what is that God said that's
[1:10:31] Paul and that's
[1:10:33] Silas and one would say what are they
[1:10:37] doing God said look they're cold they're
[1:10:41] hungry they're beaten they're blooded
[1:10:44] they're bruised they're rejected they're
[1:10:47] in jail and they're
[1:10:50] chained would said my
[1:10:53] God what are they doing and God said
[1:10:57] they're having
[1:11:03] church now there's just something about
[1:11:06] family Harmony I mean that's what they
[1:11:08] tell me I don't even know what Harmony
[1:11:10] is but that's what they tell me and so
[1:11:12] you know Silas being a little
[1:11:15] whiny come on he probably saying
[1:11:19] tener Paul being the church age
[1:11:21] messenger you know he probably sang Lead
[1:11:26] and worwood said to God what are you
[1:11:28] going to do and God said you know I'm
[1:11:30] enjoying that so much I think I'll just
[1:11:32] go down sing
[1:11:35] Bas and God came
[1:11:39] down God came down to receive their
[1:11:41] praise and that great thunderous voice
[1:11:43] it began to shake and the chain came off
[1:11:46] and the doors came come on somebody they
[1:11:48] begin to praise God oh Hallelujah in
[1:11:52] prison change and bleeding Stripes Paul

[1:12:23] chainsen and they will fall
[1:12:26] in Jesus
[1:12:28] name we bless your name we bless your
[1:12:32] name several year ago I was in a meeting
[1:12:35] as a young girl was a cutter she had
[1:12:37] scars all over her
[1:12:39] arms was in this
[1:12:42] meeting and she wanted to worship God
[1:12:44] the spirit of God was moving in the
[1:12:45] congregation I believe it was a youth
[1:12:46] camp if I remember right and she said
[1:12:48] Lord I Want To Worship you but I'm
[1:12:50] ashamed of these scars and she said a
[1:12:52] voice spoke to her and said raise your
[1:12:54] arms and give me praised and the sister
[1:12:56] testified that when she raised her arms
[1:12:58] to worship God the scars came off of her
[1:13:01] arms that's the God we Ser you may be
[1:13:04] sitting here with scars in your life but
[1:13:06] praise to our God it can erase the Scars
[1:13:08] come on somebody there is nothing that
[1:13:11] our God Can
[1:13:14] Do Not only is a gate for
[1:13:19] entrance it is also a gate of Defense it
[1:13:22] keeps things out
[1:13:27] out ain't that something that praise can
[1:13:29] actually keep things out so wouldn't it
[1:13:31] make sense if praise could keep the
[1:13:34] devil out that he would try to
[1:13:36] discourage you from praising
[1:13:40] God come on and how many times do we
[1:13:42] fall for that come on
[1:13:46] now but a gate of Praise is actually a
[1:13:48] gate of
[1:13:50] Defense now listen to this I know you
[1:13:52] think I'm crazy but listen to this let's
[1:13:55] say thanks be to God you believe you
[1:13:57] believe me to be a servant You Must
[1:13:59] Believe now Sister cuz you realize your
[1:14:01] condition you've got cancer and you're
[1:14:03] not going to live long unless God
[1:14:04] touches you isn't that right come here
[1:14:06] my sister kind heavenly father let thy
[1:14:09] mercies be shown un the woman may she go
[1:14:12] from here ton not normally and well I
[1:14:15] condemn this enemy with this church and
[1:14:17] these believing people in the name of
[1:14:19] Jesus Christ may it leave her amen amen
[1:14:24] then he says this yes God bless you
[1:14:26] Sister go happy now rejoicing thanking
[1:14:30] God just believe it's gone from you now
[1:14:33] it's gone from you now but when it goes
[1:14:37] out it'll come back again but if you
[1:14:41] just keep thanking the lord if you just
[1:14:43] keep saying Thank You Lord if you just
[1:14:45] keep on
[1:14:46] rejoicing it can't come back then you
[1:14:51] see you're giving God praise
[1:14:57] it'll go out but it will try to come
[1:14:59] back but if it finds you thanking God if
[1:15:02] it finds you giving God
[1:15:05] praise it can't come back
[1:15:09] then so your praise is a defense gate
[1:15:13] that'll keep the enemy from coming
[1:15:17] back thank you
[1:15:19] Lord your your praise to God is a
[1:15:23] defense against s
[1:15:26] and think about it how it must please
[1:15:29] God that while we are yet in trouble we
[1:15:33] begin to give him
[1:15:35] praise the Bible said oh let not the
[1:15:37] oppressed return to shame let the poor
[1:15:39] and the needy praise thy name not wait
[1:15:43] till we're fully recovered not wait till
[1:15:45] we're fully delivered why we're yet poor
[1:15:47] why we're yet in need we can still call
[1:15:50] on his name we can still exalt him we
[1:15:52] can still give God praise we can praise
[1:15:55] him in the morning we can Praise Him in
[1:15:56] the noon time we can Praise Him in the
[1:15:58] evening time we can Praise Him in the
[1:16:00] car we can Praise Him in the closet we
[1:16:01] can Praise Him in church we can praise
[1:16:03] him at work come on
[1:16:04] [Applause]
[1:16:11] somebody think about it just praise him
[1:16:16] well I want to wait till the condition's
[1:16:17] just right
[1:16:20] why just start praising
[1:16:23] him listen what what is Satan going to
[1:16:25] do to a man that every time he afflicts
[1:16:29] him that man Praises God that much
[1:16:33] more Satan hits you with a punch and
[1:16:36] knocks you into the second row and you
[1:16:37] get up and start praising
[1:16:41] Jesus he said this man's lost his mind
[1:16:44] he has he's got the mind of
[1:16:48] God think about that every time he hits
[1:16:51] you with trouble you praise God that
[1:16:53] much more
[1:16:57] oh God don't look at your
[1:17:00] symptoms look to your
[1:17:02] god look to God if you look at your
[1:17:05] symptoms that's all you'll ever
[1:17:08] see if you look to the CT scan that's
[1:17:10] all you'll ever
[1:17:14] see but just look to
[1:17:18] God just look to
[1:17:20] God just start praising him he'll bring
[1:17:24] that child in just start praising he'll
[1:17:26] bring that wife in just start praising
[1:17:31] him but Satan so wants us to see the
[1:17:36] symptoms and I'm telling you they can be
[1:17:39] really
[1:17:40] real yes they can but I think about
[1:17:45] symptoms Jonah comes to my
[1:17:48] mind now if there's anybody that ever
[1:17:51] had
[1:17:52] symptoms it was Jonah
[1:17:56] this man was swallowed by a
[1:17:59] fish anybody here ever been swallowed by
[1:18:01] a
[1:18:02] fish Jonah was swallowed by fish and can
[1:18:06] you imagine here he is in the belly of a
[1:18:10] great fish first of all can you imagine
[1:18:13] the
[1:18:15] smell and second of all the prophet said
[1:18:18] when a fish eats and its belly's full it
[1:18:21] goes right to the bottom of the ocean
[1:18:23] and lays there
[1:18:25] so here was a man who was thrown
[1:18:28] overboard by the men he was on the boat
[1:18:31] with into the ocean in a storm and a
[1:18:34] fish swallows him and goes to the bottom
[1:18:37] of the ocean thought woo well that's
[1:18:39] pretty good I wouldn't mind having
[1:18:41] another one of
[1:18:46] them can you imagine the
[1:18:48] smell and not only that everywhere he
[1:18:51] looked was Well's belly
[1:18:55] he didn't even have a cell
[1:18:57] phone
[1:18:58] Amen in the belly of a great
[1:19:03] fish but did he
[1:19:05] quit did he collapse in
[1:19:08] despair no Jonah said I cried by reason
[1:19:14] of my Affliction unto the Lord amen I
[1:19:18] wonder sometimes if God don't allow
[1:19:20] things to come so we'll cry out to him
[1:19:24] I Cried unto the Lord by the reason of
[1:19:27] my
[1:19:28] afflictions and he heard
[1:19:34] me out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[1:19:38] thou heardest my voice if God can hear
[1:19:42] Jonah cry out of the belly of a
[1:19:46] well in the bottom of the ocean can't he
[1:19:49] hear your cry seting in the house of God
[1:19:54] but you see the symptoms never silenced
[1:19:58] Jonah's voice right in the midst of his
[1:20:01] trial he started praising God Jonah said
[1:20:05] in 2:9 I will sacrifice unto thee with
[1:20:07] the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay
[1:20:09] that that I have vowed salvation is of
[1:20:12] the Lord right in the midst of the
[1:20:15] greatest difficult or trial of his life
[1:20:17] Jonah began to lift his voice to God he
[1:20:19] begin to cry out to God he begin to
[1:20:21] acknowledge the god of Salvation he
[1:20:23] begin to acknowledge God in his praise
[1:20:26] yes sir and that great fish at the
[1:20:28] bottom of the ocean with a belly full of
[1:20:30] a 6' 200 lb man just said there there

[1:20:35] so good I wouldn't have another one of
[1:20:36] them man I am so
[1:20:38] full and Jonah begins to cry out to God
[1:20:41] and when Jonah begins to cry out to God
[1:20:43] all of a sudden that that great fish
[1:20:45] just sitting there just
[1:20:50] a Jonah begins to cry out
[1:20:53] w f said oh my god I've swallowed a Holy

[1:21:43] ocean cannot it take care of that fear
[1:21:46] and that Gloom and that doom and that
