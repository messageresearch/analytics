[7:59] privilege it is once again to come to
[8:01] the house of the Lord. Had a tremendous
[8:04] time here Wednesday night. How many of
[8:05] you enjoyed the word of the Lord? God is
[8:07] so good. And we just we appreciate his
[8:10] divine presence. We appreciate the
[8:12] blessings that he bestows upon us
[8:14] because we know that without him, we're
[8:16] absolutely nothing. Right? How many of
[8:18] you realize that you are six feet of
[8:21] dirt, five feet of dirt, 4 foot of dirt?
[8:26] That's what we are. Yeah, because we in
[8:29] ourselves are, brother, we're nothing.
[8:32] But with Jesus Christ, we're the apple
[8:34] of his eye. Somebody say, "Thank you,
[8:37] Jesus." Are you glad he lives in your

[10:57] many prayer requests. Brother Joe Harris
[10:59] is going to come and pray over the
[11:01] prayer request this morning. He has some
[11:03] announcements that he wants to make
[11:05] concerning uh vacation bible school.
[11:08] Want to remember sister Christine Baker

[11:12] sickness. uh special petition before the

[11:53] home maybe tomorrow, but we certainly
[11:55] want to pray for brother Rocky that the
[11:57] Lord would just continue to uh give him
[11:59] healing in his body. We know that God is
[12:02] able and want to remember Blair Henley

[12:24] prayer today. All our local folks that
[12:26] are suffering with different types of
[12:28] sickness. uh don't have a request for
[12:30] them, but we certainly want to hold them
[12:32] in our heart and ask the Lord to be
[12:34] mindful of all their situations, right?
[12:37] All the unspoken prayer requests, if you
[12:39] have a need today, we just commit all
[12:41] these things unto the Lord. Brother Joe,

[14:57] brother Rob's group that will be there.
[14:58] So um I'm the bearer of bad news.
[15:01] Sometimes you ride the bus, sometimes
[15:04] you ride under it.
[15:06] So you guess where I rode. So, but if
[15:10] you will remember all that, we sure
[15:11] appreciate it. And thanks for brother
[15:13] Michael and all the Sunday school
[15:15] teachers that's putting that together.
[15:17] So, if we can, we go before the Lord,
[15:20] take these
[15:21] needs. Heavenly Father, we're so
[15:23] grateful, Lord, for another time to come
[15:25] to sit under your word, Lord. Lord,
[15:27] we're so grateful that we can bring our
[15:29] needs before you, Lord. we could lay
[15:31] them at your feet knowing, Father, that
[15:33] no matter what happens, if they get if
[15:35] they get worse or symptoms or
[15:37] circumstances, we know, Lord, if we
[15:38] placed them at your feet, Lord, that
[15:41] your will would be done. We're believing
[15:43] that this morning. You you've seen the
[15:45] request that was written, the hands
[15:46] that's raised, Lord, and some needs are
[15:48] greater than others, Lord, but they're
[15:50] all great in your sight. So, we pray
[15:52] that you would have your way this
[15:54] morning, Father. Lord, as the word comes
[15:56] forth, I know our brother's prepared,
[15:57] Lord. Lord, I know he nervous. I've been
[16:00] there, Father. I I know that feeling,
[16:02] Lord. And I pray, Father, that you would
[16:04] set him aside for service, Lord. May
[16:06] there not be any in this service that
[16:08] would come from any single person that
[16:10] would hinder the move of your Holy
[16:12] Spirit this morning, Lord. Lord, if
[16:14] we've come for any other reason but to
[16:15] receive your word, Lord, we've come in
[16:17] vain this morning, Lord. I pray, Father,
[16:19] that you would anoint him. Anoint the
[16:21] music, anoint brother Louie, the
[16:22] musicians, Father, anoint us to worship
[16:25] and give you praise this morning, Lord,
[16:26] for you are worthy of all praise. We
[16:29] thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen.
[16:34] God bless you. Amen. Users, if you want
[16:38] to come at this time, receive the
[16:40] morning tithing offering. You give us
[16:42] unto the Lord. Let's sing an old song of
[16:44] the church. Uh, now I know most most of
[16:48] you are geared or especially a lot of
[16:51] our young people, we're g you're geared
[16:54] toward uh
[16:56] 88.3 contemporary and that's all right.
[17:00] There's some good contemporary stuff,
[17:02] but us old folks, we like songs of the
[17:06] church, some of them. And uh some of
[17:10] them are good, too. So whatever you're
[17:12] geared to, you join the old folks this
[17:14] morning, young people saying come and
[17:17] died.
[17:18] Will you do that with me? Paul 88.3
[17:23] wizard. Praise the Lord. I pick on him a
[17:26] lot, but I love him to death. Praise the
[17:29] Lord. God is so good to us. He wants us
[17:32] to come and dine. I heard brother
[17:34] Brandon on the tape. He was
[17:36] complimenting uh he was debating and
[17:39] complimenting
[17:40] uh the
[17:41] chef that had prepared a meal for
[17:45] him and he said he hadn't eaten a solid
[17:47] meal in a couple of days but that meal
[17:50] that that chef set before him he was so
[17:54] complimentary. Now we're not here to eat
[17:56] natural food today but we have come to
[17:58] dine.
[18:00] We'll have a we'll have a table spread
[18:02] here just in a few minutes. Now, it
[18:04] might be broccoli and don't you don't
[18:07] like broccoli. Our pastor don't like
[18:10] broccoli. Although we did see him with a
[18:13] piece of it in his mouth here not long
[18:15] ago, but anyway, that's we'll not go
[18:18] there. It might be turnups. Some of you
[18:20] don't like turnups. Might be cabbage.
[18:23] But whatever God's got spread for us
[18:25] here just in a little while, let's come
[18:28] and dine. They're going to be some good
[18:30] stuff. There going to be some stuff that
[18:32] you might ponder over and you might lay
[18:34] it aside and you'll think, "Well, I'll
[18:36] I'll chew on that or I'll I'll eat that
[18:38] later." But God's going to give you
[18:40] something that you can take home with
[18:42] you today. How many of you come to
[18:45] receive? What's the rest of you come
[18:47] for? How many of you come to receive?
[18:50] It's not too hard for you to raise your
[18:51] hand if some if somebody ask you a
[18:53] question, is it? How many of you come to
[18:55] give something
[18:57] back? We're going to give him our praise
[18:59] and our worship. Is that right? How many
[19:01] of you feel like he's he's worthy of
[19:03] whatever you give him this morning? How
[19:05] many of you feel like he's more worthy
[19:07] than what we're going to give him this
[19:09] morning? He's worthy of
[19:11] everything. I'm worthy of
[19:13] damnation. This old Louis ble right
[19:16] here, this old house. But in the side of
[19:18] me, there's a great king living and he's
[19:21] worthy of all the praise that I could
[19:22] ever give to him. Give him one more good
[19:24] hand clap of
[19:26] praise.
[19:29] [Music]
[19:31] Raise it
[19:33] one. I
[19:35] think we're going to get the key worked
[19:37] out. Let me see what key that would be
[19:40] in
[19:45] accordance. Jesus has a table will
[19:48] spread where the saints of God are fed.
[19:52] He invites his chosen people come and
[19:57] die with his mana
[20:00] heth and supplies our every need. Oh to
[20:05] sweet us up with Jesus all the
[20:09] time. Come and dine. The master call
[20:13] come and
[20:15] dine. You may feast at Jesus table.
[20:23] He who fed the
[20:25] multitude turned the water into wine.
[20:29] Through the hungry call now come and
[20:34] die. The disciples came to land. Thus
[20:39] obeying Christ command for the master
[20:43] called to them come and die.
[20:47] There they found their heart's desire.
[20:51] Bread and fish upon the fire. Thus he
[20:55] satisfies the hungry every
[20:59] [Applause]
[21:01] [Music]
[21:03] time. Oh, sounding
[21:06] [Music]
[21:10] good. Sing it.
[21:16] Turn the water into
[21:23] wine. Oh, soon the lamb will take his
[21:27] bride to be ever at his side. All the
[21:32] host of heaven will symbol
[21:36] be. Oh will be a glorious sight. All the
[21:41] saints in spotless wine and with Jesus
[21:45] they will peace
[21:49] eternally. Come and dine. The master
[21:52] callth. Come and
[21:55] die. You made peace at Jesus table.
[22:03] He who fed the
[22:05] multitude turned the water into wine. To
[22:09] the hungry calleth now come and
[22:14] dine. Oh come and dine. The master
[22:18] callth. Come and
[22:21] dine. You may feast at Jesus table.
[22:28] He who fed the
[22:33] multitude to the hungry calleth down.
[22:37] Come and
[22:39] die. Now soon the lamb will take his
[22:43] bride to be ever at his side. All the
[22:48] host of heaven will assemble
[22:52] be. Oh it will be a glorious side. All
[22:57] the saints in spotless wide and with
[23:00] Jesus they will peace
[23:06] [Music]
[23:09] eternally. Thank you Lord.
[23:18] He who fed the
[23:21] multitude turned the water into wine. Do
[23:25] the hungry call. Now come and
[23:33] die.
[23:35] Hallelujah. Wouldn't take nothing from
[23:37] the journey. Amen. Let's sing this
[23:40] another old
[23:41] song that's been sung for years and
[23:43] years and years, but I like it. It says,
[23:46] "I wouldn't take nothing from a journey
[23:47] now. How about you? I wouldn't trade
[23:50] what we're living for right now for all
[23:53] that the world could offer. Would you?
[23:55] You've got more than anything the world
[23:57] can give you. I promise you that.
[23:59] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Give
[24:01] him one more good hand clap of praise
[24:03] this
[24:07] morning. Well, it wouldn't take nothing
[24:10] for my journey now. Got to make it to
[24:13] heaven somehow. Though the devil tempts
[24:16] me, tries to turn me
[24:20] around. He's offered
[24:23] everything, all the wealth I want.
[24:26] Worldly fame if I could still wouldn't.
[24:29] Nothing from my journey
[24:32] now. No, I wouldn't take nothing from my
[24:36] journey now. Got to make it to heaven
[24:39] somehow. Though the devil tempt me,
[24:42] Christ will turn me around.
[24:46] He's offered
[24:48] everything, the wealth I want, worldly
[24:52] fame. If I could still, I wouldn't take
[24:54] nothing for my journey
[24:58] now. I started out traveling for the
[25:01] Lord many years ago. Brother Paul, y'all
[25:04] come
[25:06] [Music]
[25:12] on. Then I would humble
[25:17] down. I'd say thank you, Lord. I
[25:20] wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[25:23] now. Wouldn't take nothing for my
[25:26] journey now. Got to make it to heaven
[25:30] somehow. Though the devil temp me, tries
[25:33] to turn me around.
[25:37] He's offered
[25:39] everything, all the wealth I want in
[25:42] worldly fame. If I could still, I
[25:44] wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[25:47] now. No, I wouldn't take nothing for my
[25:52] journey now. Got to make it to heaven
[25:55] somehow. Though the devil tempts me,
[25:58] tries to turn me around.
[26:02] He's offered
[26:04] everything. All the wealth I want and
[26:07] worldly fame. If I could still, I
[26:10] wouldn't take nothing from my journey
[26:12] [Applause]
[26:13] [Music]
[26:16] now.
[26:17] Amen. Praise the Lord. You can be seated
[26:20] this morning. Give our singers a nice
[26:22] hand. Sister Anna, I don't know if she's
[26:24] in ready or not, but she'll come on to
[26:26] the platform and be getting ready to
[26:28] sing.
[26:45] [Music]
[26:59] I wasn't There on Eden's darkest day
[27:03] when Satan called and sin obeyed and
[27:08] left behind the scars of fallen
[27:13] man. Even though all the years have come
[27:18] and gone, the line between the right and
[27:22] wrong tries to keep us from God's
[27:26] perfect plan.
[27:29] I could blame it on
[27:32] Adam and say I never had a
[27:36] chance and lay the case for all my
[27:40] failures on some broken
[27:44] circumstance and say I'm a
[27:48] victim as if it would set me
[27:51] free when the truth is just as close as
[27:56] Calary
[27:58] where Jesus went because he wanted
[28:03] me to rise above
[28:11] even. He didn't just call me to a higher
[28:16] place, a better life, a deeper faith,
[28:21] and leave me just to find it on my own.
[28:28] He didn't just say I was forgiven then
[28:33] to go on living in my sin. Even though
[28:38] the father must have
[28:42] known. I could blame it on
[28:46] Adam and say I never had a
[28:50] chance and lay a case for all my
[28:54] failures on some broken
[28:57] circumstance and say I'm a
[29:01] victim as if it would set me
[29:05] free when the truth is just as close as
[29:10] Calary where Jesus And because he wanted
[29:17] me to rise above
[29:25] Eden in my ache for
[29:28] holiness, I feel the pull of all that
[29:32] makes me human.
[29:35] And there are days with
[29:38] everything
[29:41] within was to blame it on
[29:45] Adam and say I never had a
[29:49] chance and laid a case for all my
[29:54] failures on some broken
[29:57] circumstance and say I'm a
[30:01] victim as if it will set me
[30:05] free when the truth is just as close as
[30:10] Calary where Jesus went because he
[30:14] wanted
[30:17] me to rise above
[30:24] Eden. I want to rise above Eden.
[30:35] [Applause]
[31:00] [Music]
[31:15] Blessed are those who run to him, who
[31:18] place their hope and confidence in
[31:23] Jesus. He won't forsake
[31:28] them. And blessed are those who seek his
[31:32] face, who bend their knee and fix their
[31:35] gaze on
[31:38] Jesus. They won't be
[31:42] shen. Come on and
[31:44] praise
[31:46] the Lord with
[31:50] me. Sing if you love his name.
[31:55] [Music]
[31:57] Come on and
[31:59] lift
[32:01] your voice with me. He's worthy of all
[32:08] our
[32:15] praise. Blessed are those who walk with
[32:18] him, whose hearts are set on
[32:22] pilgrimage with Jesus.
[32:25] They'll see his
[32:29] glory. And blessed are those who die to
[32:33] live. Whose joy it is to give it all for
[32:39] Jesus and for him
[32:43] only. Oh
[32:46] Jesus. All for your glory.
[32:51] Come on and
[32:53] praise
[32:55] the Lord with
[32:58] me. Sing if you love his
[33:05] name. Come on and

[33:09] your voice with me. He's worthy of all
[33:16] our praise.
[33:20] Come on and
[33:21] bring
[33:23] your
[33:25] [Music]
[33:27] offering. Sing if you've known his

[33:40] hands. He's worthy of all our praise.
[33:47] [Music]
[33:53] Bless God in the
[33:55] sanctuary. Bless God in the fields of
[33:58] plenty. Bless God in the darkest valley.
[34:03] Every chance I get, I'll bless your
[34:06] name. Bless God when my hands are empty.
[34:10] Bless God with the praise that calls me.
[34:14] Bless God when nobody's watching. Every
[34:17] chance I get, I'll bless your name.
[34:21] Bless God when the weapons for me. Bless
[34:24] God when the walls are falling. Bless
[34:28] God cuz he goes before me. Every chance
[34:32] I get, I'll bless your name. Bless God
[34:35] for he holds the victory. Bless God for
[34:39] he's always with me. Bless God for he's
[34:43] always worthy. Every chance I get, I
[34:47] bless your
[34:50] name. And every chance I get, I bless
[34:54] your
[34:57] name. And every chance I get, come on
[35:01] and
[35:03] praise
[35:04] the Lord with me.
[35:09] Sing if you love his
[35:14] name. Come on and

[35:18] your voice with me. He's worthy of all
[35:25] our
[35:27] praise. And come on and

[35:49] hands. He's worthy of all our
[35:56] praise. Come on and
[35:58] bring

[36:05] Sing if you've
[36:07] known his
[36:10] grace. Come on and
[36:13] lift up your holy
[36:17] hands. He's worthy of
[36:21] all our
[36:24] praise. Yes, he's worthy of
[36:28] all our praise.
[36:33] [Music]
[36:42] We appreciate your
[36:45] song if you will. Brother Joel Brown's
[36:48] going to come and bring us the word of
[36:49] the Lord. Certainly going to pray for
[36:51] our brother. We love Brother Joel Brown
[36:53] and his family, don't we? They mean a
[36:55] lot to our assembly. Let's sing a little
[36:56] chorus as he prepares to come. It gets
[36:59] sweeter as the days go by.
[37:02] Can you really say that from your heart?
[37:05] It gets sweeter as the days go by. The
[37:07] older you get, the sweeter it gets.
[37:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's sing it
[37:12] together if you will. It gets
[37:16] sweeter as the days go
[37:20] by. Oh, it gets
[37:24] sweeter as the moments
[37:28] fly. His love is
[37:31] richer,
[37:34] deeper,
[37:35] fuller,
[37:37] sweeter. Oh, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter
[37:41] as the days go by.
[37:45] Oh, it gets sweeter.
[38:00] [Music]
[38:07] [Music]
[38:14] [Music]
[38:21] Huh? Guess what I didn't do? I forgot to
[38:24] press that button, didn't I?
[38:31] Well, is that good? There we go. I am
[38:34] extra nervous today. I have to let you
[38:36] know. And when I get nervous, I forget
[38:38] things. I've I walked out and almost
[38:40] forgot my notes this morning. And I
[38:43] forgot my Bible. I forgotten my tie
[38:45] before. I've been on the road. I
[38:47] forgotten my shoes and my belt.
[38:50] And one time I forgot a
[38:52] flight. It's just so nervous and and
[38:55] just um and that haunts me to this day.
[38:57] And that's been years ago. And I think
[38:59] about that just about every time I go
[39:00] out to preach. I know I'm probably going
[39:02] to forget something.
[39:04] Um, but it's good to be in the house of
[39:06] the Lord this morning. Amen.
[39:09] When the music
[39:12] fades and all is stripped
[39:16] away and I simply
[39:21] come longing just to
[39:26] bring something that's of
[39:29] worth that will bless your heart.
[39:37] I'll bring you more than a
[39:41] song. For a song in
[39:44] itself is not what you have
[39:48] [Applause]
[39:51] required. You search much deeper
[39:56] within through the way things appear.
[39:59] You're looking into my
[40:06] heart. I'm coming back to the heart of
[40:12] worship. And it's all about
[40:16] you. It's all about you,
[40:20] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[40:26] made it. When it's all about
[40:31] you, it's all about you,
[40:37] [Music]
[40:40] Jesus.
[40:43] Yeah. King of endless
[40:46] [Music]
[40:47] words. No one could
[40:50] express how much you deserve.
[40:55] [Music]
[40:59] Though I'm weak and
[41:02] poor, all I have is
[41:05] yours. Every single
[41:11] breath. I'll bring you more than a
[41:16] song. For a song in itself is not one.
[41:22] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord
[41:26] Lord. You search much deeper
[41:30] within through the way things appear.
[41:34] You're looking deep down into my heart
[41:40] soul. I'm coming
[41:43] [Music]
[41:44] back. Could we start today where we left
[41:48] him? How about it, friends?
[41:51] It's all about him, not about your
[41:55] problems. I'm sorry, Lord, for the
[41:59] mess that I
[42:01] made. And it's all about
[42:05] you. It's all about you. One more
[42:09] time. I'm coming back to the heart of
[42:15] worship.
[42:16] Oh, it's
[42:18] all about you,
[42:23] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the
[42:28] mess messes that I made when it's all
[42:32] about you.
[42:36] Yeah,
[42:39] Jesus. It's all about you.
[42:43] It's all about
[42:46] you. It's all about you. Sing it with
[42:50] me. It's all about
[42:53] you. It's all about
[42:57] you. It's all about
[43:01] you. It's all about
[43:04] you,
[43:07] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the mess.
[43:12] the things that I made. And when it's
[43:15] supposed to be, it should be all about
[43:19] you,
[43:21] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the
[43:26] thing that I made it.
[43:31] Oh, all about you,
[43:36] Jesus. Give the Lord a
[43:39] hand. Hallelujah.
[43:43] Hallelujah. He's
[43:45] worthy. He's
[43:47] worthy. May he fill this place this day.
[43:51] May he come and do something wonderful
[43:53] today.
[43:56] Amen. If you have your adoption papers,
[43:58] turn with me to St. John
[44:03] 10:10. Amen.
[44:07] The evidence of who you are lays within
[44:09] the pages of the word of God.
[44:14] You may be able to go back and get your
[44:16] birth
[44:17] certificate and be able to tell who your
[44:19] mama is, who your daddy is, the day you
[44:22] were born, the time you were born, all
[44:25] of these things. But the identification
[44:28] of who you really are is in the word of
[44:30] God.
[44:32] Amen.
[44:33] Amen. Amen.
[44:36] St. John
[44:38] 10
[44:41] 10. The thief cometh not, but for to
[44:45] steal and to kill and to
[44:51] destroy. I am come that they might have
[44:54] life and that they might have it more
[44:59] abundantly. As we bow our heads and turn
[45:02] our hearts and attention toward heaven,
[45:06] let us
[45:07] pray. Heavenly
[45:10] Father, as the oldtimers used to say, we
[45:14] bow our heads in the lumps of our
[45:17] shoulders and look unto the dust from
[45:19] whence we
[45:22] came. Lord,
[45:24] dust, that's all that we are.
[45:28] But yet, we'll tend to these old bodies
[45:30] as though they're something as though
[45:31] they're going to live
[45:33] forever. We thank you for our place in
[45:36] the building today. And we're in
[45:39] expectation of what you're going to
[45:42] do. Lord, I know not who's here, but I
[45:45] know that there are believers here,
[45:48] there are unbelievers here, and there
[45:51] are makeelievers here.
[45:54] And so, Lord, through the power of your
[45:56] word and through the administration of a
[45:58] gift that you place within
[46:02] me, there's a lot to do
[46:04] today. There are lives that are wrecked.
[46:09] There are situations in those lives that
[46:12] seem
[46:13] impossible because as I was just saying
[46:16] in the song, Lord, using another word
[46:18] and apologizing to you for the mess that
[46:22] I
[46:23] make. So Lord, I know that there are a
[46:25] lot of messes assembled here
[46:28] today. And Lord, they may have tucked
[46:30] their Bible under their arm and we've
[46:33] got all sanctimonious and we've been all
[46:35] holy. We've been all righteous. We've
[46:38] been
[46:39] okay. But Lord, there's something about
[46:41] the discerning power of your word. It
[46:45] tells us that it cuts deeply. It cuts to
[46:48] the very marrow of the bone. And Lord,
[46:52] the beauty of it is it cuts coming and
[46:54] going just to remind us that there's
[46:57] some changes that we need to make.
[46:59] There's a little higher that we need to
[47:00] live. There's a little few more things
[47:03] that we need to get out of our lives.
[47:04] And Lord, I'm not here to to bring a
[47:06] message so so much such as that, Lord,
[47:08] to browbeat or anything, but but Lord,
[47:10] there's something about your presence
[47:13] when it comes, Lord, we realize that
[47:15] we're unholy. We're we're incapable.
[47:17] We're nothing in your sight,
[47:19] Father. So, we're simply standing in a
[47:23] position, Lord, to receive from you and
[47:26] nothing else. We're bringing it back to
[47:29] what it really, really matters is to
[47:31] you. I pray that you will strike a heart
[47:33] today. That you would change a life,
[47:35] Lord. Starting from my position where I
[47:37] am today from the pool pit all the way
[47:40] to the back, Lord. If there'd be some in
[47:43] the in out in the vestibule or wherever
[47:45] they may be, Lord, in the nurseries, oh
[47:47] God, come and do something, oh great
[47:50] Jehovah, that will make us different
[47:52] than who we were when we stepped foot in
[47:55] these doors. We're nothing, Lord,
[47:57] without you. We thank you, Lord, for all
[47:59] that you've done. We pray that you be
[48:01] with our pastor in his absence wherever
[48:03] he may be this day. Be with him and his
[48:05] precious wife. And Lord, just guide them
[48:08] and protect them and keep them. And may
[48:10] the anointing that rests, Lord, in his
[48:12] life, may it continue. And may you
[48:14] continue to use him as a as a fire brand
[48:16] to bring this word around this world.
[48:19] And we thank you for the ministry here,
[48:20] the people here at Word of Life and what
[48:22] it stands for around the world. We give
[48:24] you all praise, honor, and glory. And
[48:26] it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[48:28] Amen. You may have your seats. As I
[48:31] said, I'm extra nervous today. And
[48:35] truly, and it it's a it it's a an
[48:40] awesome place to to be, not just here,
[48:43] but here. This is a a tremendous place
[48:46] to be today. And maybe you're here and
[48:49] you didn't come with any particular
[48:52] expectations, but I'm here to let you
[48:54] know, get some before you leave. Amen.
[48:58] And I usually mention this when I when I
[48:59] minister. The prophet tells us back in
[49:01] the message, "Hear ye him." He says, "We
[49:03] must be inspired by the word of God
[49:05] that'll bring God to his word and blend
[49:07] them together and make it do and act
[49:09] like it did in the days of old." So
[49:10] there has to be something that you do
[49:12] today. Not just sit and look at me.
[49:14] Amen. Not even just sit and listen to
[49:15] me, but grab a hold of this word.
[49:19] This word will change you. Amen. These
[49:21] are things that you know, but we I'm
[49:23] going to stir you up by way of
[49:24] remembrance today.
[49:27] St. John
[49:28] 10:10. If I could give it a title and
[49:30] and bring a little direction and and
[49:32] it's going to be all over the place. I'm
[49:34] going to just go and tell you now
[49:35] because I can only be who I am.
[49:38] If you're expecting anybody else, oh
[49:40] well, you going to be sorely
[49:41] disappointed
[49:42] today. You said, "Well, I visiting from
[49:45] out of town. I thought Brother Donnie
[49:46] was going to be here." Oh
[49:49] well, guess what? Yes,
[49:52] sir. Oh,
[49:54] well. Harboring a
[49:59] fugitive. As I thought about this, I I
[50:01] thought I can get some of the brothers,
[50:02] the the the uh police officers here in
[50:05] the church. They could, you know,
[50:06] probably do a better better job than I
[50:08] could in in in borrowing that title.
[50:11] But, you know, I I just I thought too of
[50:13] how Brother Brandham was just walking
[50:14] through the woods one day and he saw a
[50:16] cigarette butt, an old discarded
[50:18] cigarette, you know, thinking man's
[50:19] filter. And and so many times I pick up
[50:21] a few little words and little things
[50:23] along the way and it just inspires me.
[50:25] But, but harboring a fugitive, St. John
[50:27] 10:10. Somebody say 11:45 for me. 11:48.
[50:33] 11:48. Y'all help me. I'm going to call
[50:35] on you. Help me to remember. Is that all
[50:37] right? I'll forget because I I've got
[50:40] I've got a lot to just share with you.
[50:41] Not that I think I'm anything but just
[50:43] to share it with you just to inspire
[50:44] you. But harboring a fugitive St. John
[50:46] 10:10, the thief cometh not but for to
[50:48] steal and to kill and to destroy. I am
[50:51] come that they might have life and that
[50:52] they might have it more abundantly. That
[50:55] word steal means to take away by theft.
[50:59] So the thief has come to take something
[51:01] away. He's stealing something. He's he's
[51:03] a thief.
[51:05] Elementary today. Elementary always for
[51:09] me. To steal, to kill. That word means
[51:13] to sacrifice, to slay, to kill. Watch
[51:16] this. To kill the pascal lamb. The
[51:20] enemy's come to steal and to to kill and
[51:23] to destroy. That word destroy means to
[51:25] put out of the way entirely. The devil's
[51:28] desire is to get rid of you.
[51:33] Even if you have just a little bitty
[51:35] teen tiny ounce of God in you or
[51:39] understanding or revelation in you, he's
[51:41] out to steal and to destroy that. He's
[51:44] out to get you.
[51:47] Hear me. To abolish, put an end to ruin,
[51:51] render useless. Wow. The devil wants to
[51:55] make you useless. To kill. To declare
[51:58] that one must be put to death. that
[52:01] stinker here. He's trying to declare
[52:03] that you need to die when he's the one
[52:06] that knows where he is
[52:09] headed to de to devoid or give over to
[52:14] eternal misery. But that word kill going
[52:17] back and picking that up just a moment
[52:19] to to to the uh to to to kill the pascal
[52:23] lamb. Now the pascal lamb as we know was
[52:25] the the sacrificial lamb. It was the
[52:27] lamb at the first Passover on the eve of
[52:30] the Exodus from Egypt. And they took
[52:32] that blood and what did they do? They
[52:34] struck the doorpost, the mantel of their
[52:36] of their home. So the devil is wanting
[52:39] nothing more than to kill the power of
[52:42] the token in your life. Hear me.
[52:47] through situations, through
[52:49] circumstances, through conditions,
[52:51] through the trials and the upheavalss of
[52:53] life. He's wanting to destroy your
[52:56] pascal lamb. He's wanting to kill that
[52:59] lamb. And not for the purpose of a
[53:01] sacrifice to give unto God,
[53:04] but to destroy you so you won't worship
[53:06] God.
[53:09] Follow me in my simplicity, please.
[53:12] Amen. That word thief is a Greek word.
[53:15] It means klepus, an embezzler, a pilfer.
[53:19] It's where we get the word
[53:22] kleptoomaniac.
[53:24] Huh? But he's come to persecute, to
[53:27] treat us, to treat you so cruy, so
[53:31] unfairly that you forget who you are.
[53:36] You get so tied up in this in self.
[53:39] Amen.
[53:41] H
[53:42] he's wanting nothing more. But but we're
[53:45] harboring a fugitive saints. Now a
[53:48] fugitive is a person who is running away
[53:51] or hiding in order to avoid
[53:56] arrest. We know these things to avoid
[53:59] arrest or p
[54:01] prosecution. They have violated the law
[54:04] in some way. That's what the devil did.
[54:06] Again, I'm just using a simple type
[54:08] here.
[54:09] They have taken someone else's property.
[54:13] This identity belongs to you. Amen. God
[54:18] has given you a a a true position and
[54:21] place and and within his economy.
[54:25] And the devil's trying to take it away
[54:27] from you to take that understanding to
[54:29] take that revelation to take your
[54:32] position avoiding capture. This fugitive
[54:35] capture by authorities evading arrest.
[54:38] Now you have a criminal and then you
[54:40] have a fugitive. And and a criminal is
[54:42] someone who has committed a crime or who
[54:45] has been convicted of a crime. They're
[54:47] already in jail. But a fugitive,
[54:49] although still a criminal, he's evading
[54:52] arrest.
[54:55] The devil wants you to think that he's
[54:59] okay hanging out in your mind,
[55:02] in your body.
[55:06] In your spirit.
[55:08] He wants you to think that he's okay.
[55:11] The fugitive is on the run. And many
[55:14] times with a fugitive, we heard the we
[55:16] have heard the expression, he's armed
[55:18] and dangerous, so be on the lookout.
[55:22] Is that right? Yeah.
[55:24] And there are legal consequences to
[55:26] breaking the law. And the the the
[55:29] choices of this fugitive, their
[55:31] decisions and their actions have caused
[55:33] them to be called a fugitive, to be
[55:36] placed in this category. So once, give
[55:38] me just a moment to to just build a
[55:39] little bit of a foundation. Again, I'm
[55:40] I'm going to be everywhere, but once the
[55:42] criminal becomes a fugitive, it
[55:44] significantly impacts the person's life
[55:47] and it triggers more severe legal
[55:50] actions. No, not just a criminal, but
[55:52] they become a fugitive because they're
[55:54] continuing to do more things that's
[55:56] compounding their conviction. They're
[55:59] they're doing more things that's
[56:00] compounding the charges that are coming
[56:02] against them.
[56:05] if they just say, "I'll surrender. I'll
[56:06] go to jail and deal with it." But no,
[56:08] the devil's stupid. The devil's dumb. He
[56:10] keeps on coming and he keeps on doing
[56:12] and he keeps coming back and he keeps on
[56:14] doing things. He keeps on destroying
[56:16] your mind. He keeps on raging in your
[56:18] body.
[56:20] Amen. Bringing his shadows around. Just
[56:24] a few weeks ago, as you know, I was I
[56:26] was suffered with with with uh the
[56:28] shingles and and and my it was pain some
[56:30] pain. I've been sicker before, but I not
[56:33] not known pain like this. But it it
[56:35] progressed. It got worse. And one day
[56:37] I'm just one day I thought maybe I was
[56:39] having a stroke. I went to the ER and I
[56:41] I was and and I began to get to the
[56:43] point where I just stopped looking at at
[56:45] stuff about shingles because it began to
[56:47] mess with my mind. And I'm not a person
[56:48] that worries and things like that. But
[56:50] but I got to the point where I'm
[56:51] thinking, what if I'm one of those
[56:53] cases? The devil. The devil. What if I'm
[56:55] one of those cases where I don't get
[56:57] better and I have the the effects of
[56:59] this forever?
[57:01] God. And I was down one morning real
[57:04] early. I couldn't sleep. It's so And it
[57:05] was in my It was in my face, in my ear,
[57:07] in my mouth. Every it was just awful.
[57:09] But I couldn't I couldn't lay on my my
[57:11] my pillow at night and just the the pain
[57:13] in my head. And I I was up early where I
[57:15] couldn't couldn't sleep. And I was just
[57:17] down praying and and I wasn't praying
[57:19] and and and asking God to to heal me,
[57:21] touch me, all of those things. I was
[57:23] just thanking God for who he was and for
[57:25] what he's done. Just in that that spirit
[57:26] of worship. And as I was closing out my
[57:28] prayer, I said this. The little spirit
[57:30] of the Lord just dropped in on me and
[57:31] spoke these words. Father, I said, "Let
[57:34] may every shadow that I see today be
[57:37] you." Because the the devil was coming
[57:40] in with his shadow, making me think this
[57:42] is going to be your case. This is going
[57:44] to be your condition. Oh boy.
[57:46] Cuz hey, the the devil has a presence
[57:48] too, saints. Now, y'all cute folk, y'all
[57:51] know I love you.
[57:55] To think that you don't believe that the
[57:57] devil has a presence. He does. He does.
[57:59] He does. He comes in and he brings his
[58:01] shadows. But my declaration was, "Lord,
[58:04] may every shadow that I see today be you
[58:07] and not the devil."
[58:10] So I got up from that prayer and from
[58:12] that time I haven't even thought
[58:13] anything about what the devil tried to
[58:15] bring.
[58:17] And you know what the thing is? I still
[58:19] have little little little moments where
[58:21] I have a little bit of pain. That don't
[58:23] mean anything to me. Huh? Yeah. My let
[58:27] me let me let me let me go
[58:30] on. Genesis
[58:33] 4:10 says, "And he said, what hast thou
[58:35] done?" Talking about Cain in the garden.
[58:37] "The voice of thy brother's blood cried
[58:39] unto me from the ground." Verse 11, "Now
[58:42] art thou cursed from the earth, which
[58:44] hath opened her mouth to receive thy
[58:46] brother's blood from thy hand. When thou
[58:47] tillest the ground, it shall not
[58:49] henceforth yield unto thee her strength.
[58:51] A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be
[58:53] in the earth." And Cain said unto the
[58:56] Lord, "I'm
[58:58] sorry, Father. Forgive me for what I
[59:01] did. I'm so sorry." And then then the
[59:02] tears begin to fall and the snot runs
[59:05] out of his nose. This the sorry, you
[59:08] won't find him doing that at all.
[59:13] What does he do? He immediately says,
[59:15] "My punishment is greater than I can
[59:17] bear." He's more worried about the the
[59:19] the the punishment that he's going to
[59:21] receive than what he did.
[59:25] That's the truth. Yes, sir.
[59:30] That's a good place to say amen. Amen.
[59:36] And behold, thou has driven me out this
[59:38] day from the face of the earth. Verse
[59:39] 14, Genesis 4. And from thy face shall I
[59:41] be hid, and I shall be a fugitive and a
[59:43] vagabond in the earth. And it shall come
[59:45] to pass that everyone that findeth me
[59:47] shall slay me. Now, Cain was fully aware
[59:51] of the fact that he was not going to be
[59:54] liked because of what he had done. Fully
[59:57] aware of it because why? He said, "My
[59:59] punishment is greater than I can bear."
[1:00:00] He was aware that he was not going to be
[1:00:03] liked. Because he said, "Everyone that I
[1:00:05] meet, they're they're going to look down
[1:00:06] on me." So, who are they? Who who are
[1:00:08] these people that's going to look down
[1:00:10] on? Mom, dad, his family. That's all
[1:00:12] that there was at that time. That's
[1:00:14] right.
[1:00:16] His family harboring a fugitive. Genesis
[1:00:20] 4:11-2, judgment is placed upon Cain, he
[1:00:24] becomes cursed in his soul, he becomes a
[1:00:28] vagabond in his body and he becomes
[1:00:31] unprosperous in his labors. Y'all know
[1:00:33] the scriptures? Yeah. Because of sin,
[1:00:35] because of transgression, because of
[1:00:37] violation, because he broke the law,
[1:00:41] become a fugitive and a vagabond. He
[1:00:44] says, "Everyone that findeth me shall
[1:00:45] slay me." And we know many times often
[1:00:48] it is family and friends and those who
[1:00:51] are closest to the guilty to that
[1:00:53] fugitive who provides refuge for them.
[1:00:56] We know of cases and hear in the news
[1:00:58] and all of these things. Come to find
[1:00:59] out they they they done ran to grandma's
[1:01:01] house.
[1:01:04] Hiding in the basement.
[1:01:07] Well, honey, come on in. Grand grandma
[1:01:09] don't even know what what he just did.
[1:01:11] What she just did. Come on in, baby. you
[1:01:13] are you hungry?
[1:01:19] And they just kick back. Huh? But
[1:01:23] eventually the spirit of the Lord comes
[1:01:26] for you. You cannot get comfortable
[1:01:28] where you are. Amen. You cannot get
[1:01:30] comfortable in the condition, Joel
[1:01:32] Brown. You cannot get comfortable in the
[1:01:34] condition that you're in.
[1:01:36] You shouldn't be comfortable with that
[1:01:38] ailment in your body. No. Mm- You're
[1:01:41] harboring a fugitive,
[1:01:44] trapped in your own mind. You come to
[1:01:47] church and you can't even wait raise
[1:01:49] your hands because you feel guilty.
[1:01:51] Today is the day of your salvation.
[1:01:56] The word of God has come today to bring
[1:01:58] you deliverance. Amen.
[1:02:02] The message I will
[1:02:07] restore. Here in the beginning, Cain was
[1:02:09] a worshshiper, a believer. Why brother?
[1:02:11] You said if a man believes on the Lord
[1:02:13] Jesus Christ correctly. That's right.
[1:02:15] But Cain was a believer. He came to
[1:02:17] worship God. And not only that, but he
[1:02:20] was a great contributor to the church.
[1:02:23] Watch this. He made sacrifice to the
[1:02:26] church. He built a garden where the
[1:02:28] cherubam was with the sword perhaps at
[1:02:29] the east side of the gate. Now they
[1:02:32] perhaps both boys come there and built
[1:02:34] an altar or a church, a worshiping
[1:02:36] place. And Cain built just as good an
[1:02:38] altar and perhaps a more prettier altar
[1:02:40] than
[1:02:41] Abel. And he came with his gift and he
[1:02:44] worshiped God just the same as Abel did.
[1:02:47] And if God only requires faith in him,
[1:02:50] worshiping him, a membership in a
[1:02:52] church, a sacrifice, listen how the
[1:02:54] prophet places this. If this is all that
[1:02:56] God requires, faith in him, worshiping
[1:02:59] him, a membership in a church, a
[1:03:01] sacrifice, why today we call that a
[1:03:04] renowned Christian. Oh yeah. Oh my
[1:03:07] looking the part, playing the part,
[1:03:09] singing the part, preaching the part.
[1:03:12] We would call that a renowned Christian.
[1:03:15] But how far we are off from the word of
[1:03:17] God. That man was a worshipper. He
[1:03:20] didn't come in vain. He wanted his soul
[1:03:24] saved. He come with a sincerity of heart
[1:03:27] and laid down to find favor with God.
[1:03:31] So the prophet many times he he talks
[1:03:35] about how you know if I had the spirit
[1:03:37] of John Dillinger in me and and the
[1:03:39] spirit of an artist and all of these
[1:03:40] things. And so this this this this guy
[1:03:43] he's coming and he he is playing the
[1:03:46] part. He has a spirit of worship on him.
[1:03:49] He has a spirit and ability to to create
[1:03:52] an atmosphere. Yeah. Uh-huh. So, you
[1:03:54] would expect if he is under that that
[1:03:57] type of spirit, if he he that he would
[1:03:59] express the attributes of that that he's
[1:04:01] under, but we find out as we know the
[1:04:04] simplicity of it, he was under another
[1:04:05] inspiration, another spirit that wasn't
[1:04:08] of God. We notice the first sewer of the
[1:04:09] seed of discrepancy was branded the
[1:04:12] devil. And we know it was in Genesis 1.
[1:04:14] and and and anything that sws
[1:04:16] discrepancy contrary to the written word
[1:04:18] of God or puts any private
[1:04:20] interpretation to it is the seed of
[1:04:22] discrepancy and God will not honor it.
[1:04:25] He can't do it. It won't mix. It
[1:04:27] certainly will not. It's like mustard
[1:04:28] seed. It won't mix with anything else.
[1:04:31] So harboring a
[1:04:34] fugitive under both state and federal
[1:04:36] law is a criminal offense that occurs
[1:04:39] when someone knowingly assists a person
[1:04:42] who is trying to evade arrest or
[1:04:46] prosecution by hiding them, providing
[1:04:48] shelter or otherwise abiding, aiding
[1:04:51] their escape
[1:04:54] knowingly. You know who the devil is.
[1:04:58] You know what the devil is capable of.
[1:05:00] Yeah. Harboring a fugitive,
[1:05:03] giving place and opportunity and space
[1:05:06] for the devil to do what he's going to
[1:05:08] do.
[1:05:13] Harboring a fugitive. Now, the law
[1:05:16] declares that you must be aware that the
[1:05:18] person you are helping is a fugitive.
[1:05:20] Well, come on in, baby. You
[1:05:23] hungry? Grandma didn't know. Yeah, but
[1:05:27] you do.
[1:05:29] I do.
[1:05:31] Right.
[1:05:33] The law says you must be aware that the
[1:05:34] person you were helping is a fugitive.
[1:05:36] Meaning they are wanted by law
[1:05:37] enforcement for a crime cuz we know we
[1:05:40] we we're on Facebook and we're on TikTok
[1:05:42] and we're on the news and all these
[1:05:44] things and we're we're aware of what
[1:05:46] what Was it WJHL? I don't even know the
[1:05:48] local news station. WJHL, we know what's
[1:05:51] going on and we we saw that. I saw him
[1:05:53] on the news. I saw that picture. I know
[1:05:56] you've been to church time and time. I
[1:05:58] know this is simple. We've been to
[1:05:59] church time and time and time again. We
[1:06:01] know who the devil is. We know what he
[1:06:03] looks like. We know what he's done. But
[1:06:05] yet, we invite him in and give him an
[1:06:07] opportunity and space to hang out in our
[1:06:09] house.
[1:06:11] Harboring a fugitive. Today is the day
[1:06:14] of salvation. Today is the day you can
[1:06:16] be free.
[1:06:19] You say, "Well, Brother Joe, I wish I
[1:06:21] was coming through my favorite
[1:06:22] preacher." Well, wait till your your
[1:06:24] favorite preacher gets here to stand
[1:06:26] here. But by that time, you may be
[1:06:28] eternally lost. You may have crossed
[1:06:30] that line that you won't have another
[1:06:31] opportunity to make it back.
[1:06:34] [Applause]
[1:06:36] Isaiah 14:13 says, "For thou hast set in
[1:06:38] thine heart, I will ascend into heaven.
[1:06:40] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:06:42] of God. I will sit also upon the mount
[1:06:44] of the congregation in the sides of the
[1:06:46] north." You know very well aware of what
[1:06:48] the devil has declared that he wants to
[1:06:50] do. Isaiah 14:14 goes on to say, "I will
[1:06:53] ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[1:06:55] I will be like the most high. Yet thou
[1:06:57] shalt be brought down to hell to the
[1:06:58] sides of the
[1:07:00] pit, harboring a fugitive, providing
[1:07:03] shelter, offering financial assistance.
[1:07:09] Is that right? Yes, sir.
[1:07:14] Aiding
[1:07:15] escape, misleading law enforcement. You
[1:07:18] come to the house of God and you hear
[1:07:20] that word go forth and you say, "Well,
[1:07:22] no, God. Uh no, he's not here. Oh my.
[1:07:28] Amen. H lying to law enforcement.
[1:07:32] But you know what? Ultimately, you're
[1:07:34] lying to yourself.
[1:07:37] Hear me, young people, young boy, young
[1:07:39] girl, hear what I'm saying today. You
[1:07:42] are harboring a
[1:07:44] fugitive and you're very well aware of
[1:07:46] it.
[1:07:48] You know, you've been taught,
[1:07:51] yeah, I don't like this, Brother Joel.
[1:07:53] We see you.
[1:07:55] Bye. I don't think the deacons have
[1:07:58] called for the doors to be
[1:08:02] locked. My preacher did that the other
[1:08:04] day. He was at a big convention. I think
[1:08:06] like 4,000 people or so, whoever it was,
[1:08:08] and he was taking up an offering and he
[1:08:10] didn't get enough. So, he tells the
[1:08:12] deacons, "Lock the
[1:08:14] doors." Cuz people begin to go out. They
[1:08:17] begin to leave. He's telling them, "Lock
[1:08:19] the doors. Close them. I'm going to do
[1:08:21] that." But providing shelter for this
[1:08:24] this slicker, offering financial
[1:08:27] assistance. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You give
[1:08:29] the devil you you give him your your
[1:08:31] your money, your your financial
[1:08:32] assistance. You put gas in that car and
[1:08:34] you go to places you shouldn't be going.
[1:08:40] Okay. Okay. I'm have to find me a place
[1:08:43] to hide to preach.
[1:08:45] knowingly assisting someone that you
[1:08:48] know is a fugitive. Genesis 3 and 6,
[1:08:51] we're going to get somewhere after a
[1:08:52] while. And when the woman saw that the
[1:08:54] tree was good for food, and it was
[1:08:55] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
[1:08:57] desired to make one wise, she took the
[1:08:59] fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave
[1:09:00] also unto her husband with her, and he
[1:09:02] did eat. So what was the serpent doing
[1:09:06] exactly? What what what was he up to?
[1:09:10] What was this
[1:09:13] fugitive tending to do? He wanted within
[1:09:17] Eve, he wanted to have a place, a place
[1:09:21] to stay in an attempt to hide long
[1:09:24] enough so he could eventually have full
[1:09:27] control.
[1:09:29] Yes, sir.
[1:09:32] That's what he's up to today. How much
[1:09:34] more simple does it get than this? He
[1:09:37] said, "Brother Joel, preach me a seal.
[1:09:39] Preach me a thunder. I am.
[1:09:43] The thunder is the voice of God. Did you
[1:09:45] not hear that thunder roll through the
[1:09:48] building? Are you not hearing those
[1:09:50] seals fly open as this word is going
[1:09:53] forth?
[1:09:55] It matters not who is coming through. If
[1:09:57] that brother is standing in that gift
[1:10:00] and he's declaring the word of God, that
[1:10:02] is the voice of God to you at that
[1:10:05] moment.
[1:10:11] I've been here with you long enough for
[1:10:13] you all to know I don't have anything to
[1:10:14] give you. I don't have any I don't have
[1:10:17] any big fancy mansion, no fine
[1:10:20] car, have no big bank account. I don't
[1:10:23] have any any personality, anything like
[1:10:25] that. But I want to bring to you today
[1:10:27] the word of God. I want to stir you up
[1:10:29] in such a way that you will realize that
[1:10:31] I need to get deliverance today. Who are
[1:10:34] you? Where are you today?
[1:10:36] Come on, brother, sister. Where are you?
[1:10:39] What condition are you in? You are in an
[1:10:41] environment and in a place where you can
[1:10:44] receive deliverance
[1:10:46] from that very thing that's binding you
[1:10:49] that's keeping you captive in your
[1:10:52] home. And all the while that he's there,
[1:10:55] that he's hanging out, he's eating your
[1:10:57] food. He's using your time. You become a
[1:11:01] captive in your own home. Every time the
[1:11:03] doorbell rings and every time the
[1:11:05] there's some knock at the door. Every
[1:11:07] time you hear the word go forward, that
[1:11:09] knock on the door, you don't want to
[1:11:11] move. You get still and you're peeping
[1:11:13] out the blinds. A captive in your own
[1:11:16] home. Why? Because the fugitive is
[1:11:18] there. And you know that if you keep
[1:11:21] that fugitive and and and long enough
[1:11:23] that you're going to be just as guilty
[1:11:25] as the fugitive
[1:11:27] because you've been harboring a
[1:11:29] fugitive. It's time, prodigal. It's time
[1:11:32] to come back home,
[1:11:36] little lady at the well. It's time you
[1:11:38] realize who you are and who it is that's
[1:11:41] speaking to you. There's eternal life
[1:11:43] inside of you. I don't care where you've
[1:11:45] been. I don't care what you've done.
[1:11:47] There's equality of eternal life in you.
[1:11:53] My you can't even
[1:11:56] be can't even be yourself
[1:11:59] anymore. Amen. What happened to you?
[1:12:03] Where's the joy? Where's the excitement?
[1:12:05] Where's the jubilation?
[1:12:08] I know for some of you, you done got
[1:12:10] this fine church, this nice pretty
[1:12:11] church, and you done
[1:12:14] got, you
[1:12:16] know, I know. Yeah, I
[1:12:21] know. This thing's going to be dust one
[1:12:23] day. Yeah. A bunch of a bunch of rubble.
[1:12:26] That's right. So this this fugitive
[1:12:29] reasons for fleeing. Fugitives typically
[1:12:32] flee to avoid being arrested. They have
[1:12:35] they flee from being charged with a
[1:12:37] crime or facing court proceedings. And
[1:12:39] remember, they're armed and dangerous.
[1:12:41] The devil is armed and he's dangerous.
[1:12:45] Now, we know that there are some people
[1:12:46] sometimes they don't even know that that
[1:12:48] fugitive is in their storage shed out in
[1:12:49] their yard. Have no clue.
[1:12:52] Not
[1:12:53] guilty.
[1:12:55] But when you know that that fugitive is
[1:12:58] hanging out in your crawl space. Yeah, I
[1:13:01] pointed then the crawl space is down
[1:13:03] here.
[1:13:08] But you know,
[1:13:10] you know what I'm talking about. I'm
[1:13:12] only here to bring this word of God to
[1:13:14] let you know there is an opportunity for
[1:13:16] you today. Yes, sir. You think, well,
[1:13:19] well, Brother Joel, I come to a big
[1:13:21] church and nobody shook me up. I don't
[1:13:22] care. Raise your hand if nobody shook
[1:13:25] your hand. I'll come to you now and
[1:13:27] shake it. If that's what you need, I
[1:13:28] will come and do it.
[1:13:32] If that's all that it takes, if that's
[1:13:34] the excuse, if that's the whispering lie
[1:13:36] that you've allowed that fugitive to
[1:13:39] tell you, let's settle it right now.
[1:13:41] Let's settle it today.
[1:13:44] You better say, "Brother Joe, I've got
[1:13:45] my life. I'm young. I've got my whole
[1:13:47] life ahead of me." Settle it today. Your
[1:13:49] day could end today.
[1:13:54] You may have lived the rest of your life
[1:13:56] when you eating that biscuit this
[1:13:58] morning. Think about
[1:14:03] it. Ham and eggs could have been your
[1:14:06] last
[1:14:09] meal. Cup of coffee, an expensive cup of
[1:14:12] coffee at that from Starbucks may have
[1:14:14] been your last
[1:14:15] drink. That's real.
[1:14:18] That's reality. Yeah. Harboring a
[1:14:23] fugitive. Being a fugitive can lead to
[1:14:26] serious legal consequences, including
[1:14:28] additional charges for fleeing,
[1:14:30] potential loss of of rights, like the
[1:14:32] right to appeal, and harsher sentences.
[1:14:34] I'm here to let the devil know because
[1:14:36] of what you've done, you don't have a
[1:14:37] right to appeal. Amen. You don't have a
[1:14:40] right to claim your case. You don't even
[1:14:42] have a right to speak. So, I'm saying
[1:14:43] today, shut up, devil. And that's what
[1:14:46] you have to do today is shut the devil
[1:14:49] down.
[1:14:51] Go ahead and call 911. He's in my house.
[1:14:54] Father, I need you to come and get him.
[1:14:57] I'm calling
[1:14:59] 911. Calling Jesus on the
[1:15:04] scene. Don't be afraid to pick up that
[1:15:07] phone and call him. If you call on
[1:15:09] Jesus, he will answer prayer. That's
[1:15:12] what the old saints used to sing long
[1:15:14] ago.
[1:15:16] Yeah. If you call on him, he will be
[1:15:18] there.
[1:15:20] Amen.
[1:15:22] Cuz I I I came across this just the
[1:15:24] other day, and you may be familiar with,
[1:15:25] maybe even read it and may have heard it
[1:15:27] before, but you can't ask God to heal
[1:15:30] you and then stay loyal to what's
[1:15:32] killing you.
[1:15:35] Say amen right there.
[1:15:38] You can't ask God to deliver you. You
[1:15:40] can't ask God to take something away.
[1:15:42] And then you remain loyal to that very
[1:15:44] thing that's killing you over and over
[1:15:47] and over. He's come to steal. He's come
[1:15:49] to kill. And he's come to destroy. But
[1:15:51] yet you're saying, "God, deliver me."
[1:15:56] We get so scrupled up, saints. Today is
[1:15:58] your day of salvation. I don't know who
[1:16:00] you are. I don't know where you are. I
[1:16:02] don't know what's going on. But today is
[1:16:04] your Some of you sanctified folks should
[1:16:06] be behind me.
[1:16:09] I am ready to get out of here. Brother
[1:16:11] JD, I'm ready to go. And we're not going
[1:16:14] till that last one is in. Where are
[1:16:16] they? What am I doing to try to find
[1:16:19] them?
[1:16:20] What are you doing to try to find them?
[1:16:23] James 4:7 says it simply this way.
[1:16:25] Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[1:16:28] Amen. Period. But that's not all. Resist
[1:16:33] the devil and he will flee from you.
[1:16:36] Amen. How simple is that?
[1:16:42] That word resist means to set oneself
[1:16:45] against. I don't need to call the
[1:16:47] pastor. It doesn't say submit yourself
[1:16:49] to God and call brother Donnie.
[1:16:52] Call mama. Call daddy. It says submit
[1:16:55] yourself therefore to God. Resist. Set
[1:16:58] yourself against the ws of the enemy.
[1:17:03] You set your you roll the stone away. He
[1:17:05] said, "Brother Joel, I'm tired. I'm
[1:17:06] weary." You still roll that stone away.
[1:17:09] You resist the devil. And the word of
[1:17:12] God says he will flee from you. That
[1:17:14] either means what it said, Brother
[1:17:16] Keith, or it doesn't. That's right.
[1:17:19] You're either going to believe it or
[1:17:20] you're or you won't.
[1:17:25] My He has come to steal, kill, and
[1:17:29] destroy. the message of the
[1:17:31] resurrection. The prophet says that that
[1:17:34] that there's a good oldfashioned Holy
[1:17:36] Ghost sent revival men back to believing
[1:17:38] the word of God that God will take care
[1:17:40] of us like he did in the days of old.
[1:17:44] God will do exactly what he said he
[1:17:47] would do. He's more than able. Even if
[1:17:50] you're standing in the way, he's still
[1:17:52] more than able.
[1:17:54] Setting up a a a wall of resistance,
[1:17:57] he's still more than able. M that God
[1:18:01] will take care of us like he did in the
[1:18:03] days of old. He will take care of us
[1:18:04] today. Do you believe that God will take
[1:18:06] care of us? What we need today is
[1:18:08] another refilling. Yeah. Another like
[1:18:12] the disciples. Some of you trying to
[1:18:14] test an Watch this. Some of you trying
[1:18:17] to test an experience or trust it that
[1:18:19] they had 10 years ago.
[1:18:23] Some of you trying to test and use an
[1:18:25] experience of what you got last Sunday.
[1:18:29] H prophet goes on to say that you had 10
[1:18:32] years ago. That's all right. But what
[1:18:34] about today?
[1:18:37] The disciples about 3 or 4 days after
[1:18:39] they received the Holy Ghost went back
[1:18:42] and got in one accord and began to pray
[1:18:45] again. You said, "Brother Joel, I've
[1:18:47] already prayed about that time and time
[1:18:49] again." Well, pray again. Yes.
[1:18:52] Huh? Oh my. You get away from all this
[1:18:56] here. Dignity. This big fine fancy
[1:18:59] church. Finally. I'm so glad we got a
[1:19:02] big fancy church. I can prove to you
[1:19:04] that dignity, the devil is the papy of
[1:19:07] every bit of it. Oh my.
[1:19:10] So you putting so much confidence and so
[1:19:12] much whatever in the in the new
[1:19:14] building. He's saying the devil's the
[1:19:16] papy of your
[1:19:19] inspiration. So brother Fred, where does
[1:19:21] that put us? and everything than what
[1:19:24] Michael had. He went over and set him up
[1:19:27] a
[1:19:29] kingdom. And that's what polluted
[1:19:31] heaven. See, if he stayed there and God
[1:19:33] kicked him out, he's been def dignifying
[1:19:35] the church ever since. It's the truth.
[1:19:37] God doesn't dwell in dignities. He
[1:19:39] dwells in simple, sincere hearts. Amen.
[1:19:45] Harboring a
[1:19:47] fugitive, a prisoner in your own home.
[1:19:50] While he's camped out, eating your food,
[1:19:53] taking your time, what's happening to
[1:19:55] you? You're getting weaker and weaker
[1:19:59] and weaker and he's getting stronger.
[1:20:04] Harboring of fugitive saints.
[1:20:07] The call. The call today is just as it
[1:20:12] was
[1:20:13] then. You stay with that word. Stay
[1:20:16] behind that word, Eve. Stay behind that
[1:20:19] word.
[1:20:21] That's your protection. That's your
[1:20:23] defense. Watch that word because the
[1:20:26] word contains mysteries that only the
[1:20:29] initiated are going to
[1:20:31] understand. The word contains mysteries
[1:20:33] that only the initiated is going to
[1:20:35] know.
[1:20:37] Matthew
[1:20:38] 13, Jesus had began talking to a group
[1:20:41] of people and he began to talk about the
[1:20:42] the the parable of the swer and he would
[1:20:44] talk in parables as as we know and the
[1:20:46] the disciples get with him later and
[1:20:47] they begin to question him about that.
[1:20:50] So Jesus tells his disciples and Jesus
[1:20:53] is telling you today he said it this way
[1:20:56] if I can place it this way forgive me
[1:20:57] for a moment. Jesus said, "I have gifted
[1:21:01] you. I have given you an understanding
[1:21:03] of the mysteries of the kingdom. I've
[1:21:06] handed you this gift to where you can
[1:21:09] understand the mysteries of the
[1:21:10] kingdom." He says, he goes on to say,
[1:21:12] "I've confided in you these things to
[1:21:15] you because you have been initiated into
[1:21:17] the kingdom."
[1:21:20] You are not just ordinary mortals.
[1:21:26] Somebody should have said amen. In fact,
[1:21:29] the whole church should have said amen.
[1:21:32] So, but Joy, you trying to pull amens
[1:21:34] out? No. You, if that don't fit the way
[1:21:36] you feel, then sit there and look at me.
[1:21:39] But I'm going on with Jesus.
[1:21:43] We've been given this priceless gift
[1:21:46] because we are not just ordinary
[1:21:48] mortals. What did the prophet say? I no
[1:21:50] longer call you church, but I call you
[1:21:52] what?
[1:21:53] bride.
[1:21:55] That's a particular significant
[1:21:57] designation far beyond anything
[1:22:02] that church signifies. So keep your eyes
[1:22:05] on the word. I always think when I when
[1:22:06] I think along these lines, I think about
[1:22:09] Elijah, Elijah and Elisha watching that
[1:22:12] word, keeping his eyes on that word.
[1:22:15] Every time that that Elijah would tell
[1:22:17] Elijah, "You stay right here. Stay right
[1:22:19] here. I'm going to Jordan. I'm going I'm
[1:22:21] I'm I'm going uh here, going there,
[1:22:23] going to Jericho, going to Jordan. Every
[1:22:25] time he would try to get him to stay
[1:22:28] right there, he said, "No, no, no, no,
[1:22:29] no. As long as I'm living, as long as
[1:22:32] God is living, all of these things, I'm
[1:22:34] still going to follow you. I'm going to
[1:22:36] stay right with that word."
[1:22:39] There was something about that word that
[1:22:41] captivated Elisha's heart. That's right.
[1:22:44] It was so real to him. Why? because a
[1:22:47] mystery had he had been initiated into a
[1:22:50] mysterious
[1:22:52] kingdom. He didn't care what his friends
[1:22:54] were saying. In fact, each time they
[1:22:57] would come to these cities, Jericho,
[1:22:59] Jordan, all these all all these these
[1:23:00] different places, each time in Bethl,
[1:23:03] each time they would get there, the the
[1:23:04] Bible says the sons of the prophets
[1:23:06] would come out and say, "You you you
[1:23:08] know that this guy that you're
[1:23:09] following, he's going to die."
[1:23:12] What does what does he say? Yeah, I know
[1:23:14] it, but I'm still following that word.
[1:23:16] Right. And some of these little
[1:23:18] knuckleheads around this message today,
[1:23:20] the prophet has died. We know this. But
[1:23:22] they're expecting him to. They don't
[1:23:24] believe he's dead. Really? Huh?
[1:23:26] Nonsense.
[1:23:29] Tuck in your pocket. Do whatever you
[1:23:30] need to do with it. But the mystery
[1:23:33] became manifest to
[1:23:36] Elisha. He became initiated in the
[1:23:39] eternal being expressed in
[1:23:44] time. the mystery of the eternal being
[1:23:48] expressed in time. He caught a hold of
[1:23:50] that and he kept his eyes on that
[1:23:53] prophet because he had been given a
[1:23:55] promise and he believed the words of
[1:23:57] that prophet. And the evidence of the
[1:24:00] promise gave him both power and
[1:24:02] authority. Yeah.
[1:24:05] I know that's just a simple sentence,
[1:24:07] but it's a lot packed in that.
[1:24:09] It gave him power and authority because
[1:24:12] when it came time for him to go back
[1:24:14] down to the Jordan and cross back over,
[1:24:16] he took that mantle. And I just imagine
[1:24:18] him there when he goes up when when
[1:24:20] Elijah goes up that he's just there
[1:24:22] just, you know, he's seeing that mantle
[1:24:24] fall. He's just wanting to catch it.
[1:24:26] Wherever I need to be, whatever I need
[1:24:28] to do, whatever position I need to be
[1:24:30] in, I want to be where the glory is
[1:24:31] going to fall on me. I want to be where
[1:24:33] this manifested word is falling on me. I
[1:24:36] don't care about daddy. I don't care
[1:24:38] about mom. I don't care about my
[1:24:39] friends, but wherever this word is
[1:24:41] falling, Lord, please fall on me.
[1:24:47] I'm under expectation. I want this
[1:24:51] word. Now, somebody that's harboring a
[1:24:54] fugitive, they don't even come out of
[1:24:55] their
[1:24:56] house. The devil don't want you to be,
[1:24:59] that fugitive does not want you to be
[1:25:01] where the word is fallen. He don't want
[1:25:03] you to receive that word. He wants to
[1:25:04] keep you captive still. Everybody w
[1:25:07] raise their hands and worship the Lord.
[1:25:09] I don't understand that. I don't get
[1:25:12] it. I was at a funeral one time. Friend
[1:25:16] of my wife had passed away. We we went
[1:25:18] to the funeral. I think the guy he was
[1:25:20] Presbyterian. I don't remember what he
[1:25:22] was. He was confused. We'll just say
[1:25:25] that. And he was talking about he and
[1:25:28] his wife were were worship leaders at
[1:25:29] their church. and you know and and he he
[1:25:32] talked about how and he even when he was
[1:25:35] singing he raised his hands about like
[1:25:36] this and I
[1:25:37] thought you a worship leader and that's
[1:25:40] all you can
[1:25:42] do and so when I saw him talking to him
[1:25:46] after the
[1:25:47] service I told him he didn't know what I
[1:25:50] was up to I said raise your hands a
[1:25:53] minute he got him up like this I said
[1:25:57] ah you can get them a little higher
[1:26:01] Huh?
[1:26:04] It was in him. He just didn't know it.
[1:26:07] He just didn't have anybody to ask him
[1:26:09] the right questions.
[1:26:12] So, let me ask you the question. What
[1:26:13] are you going to do today with this
[1:26:15] salvation? What are you going to do with
[1:26:17] this word?
[1:26:20] When the word come to that little woman,
[1:26:22] the little Senician woman and she came
[1:26:24] and and and she she was coming to Jesus
[1:26:26] and we know Jesus called her a dog. If
[1:26:28] you look at that word, that word, it
[1:26:29] says that she came and she worshiped
[1:26:31] him. And that word just means that that
[1:26:34] that that kissing the hand or licking
[1:26:36] the hand of a dog like a dog does its
[1:26:39] master. So she came in a way that that
[1:26:42] signified who she was. But yet Jesus
[1:26:45] responded to her in the way that she
[1:26:47] came to him.
[1:26:49] If you think you're little, that's all
[1:26:51] you get. Huh?
[1:26:54] We've been called to a greater word,
[1:26:56] saints. Amen. You can be humble all day
[1:26:59] long if you want to, but I want to be
[1:27:02] wherever God has these blessings flowing
[1:27:04] and everything that he has for me. I
[1:27:07] want it all.
[1:27:09] Here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up.
[1:27:13] Come and fill me. So, if he if I'm going
[1:27:16] to come to Jesus today, I don't want to
[1:27:18] so much just come at him and worship in
[1:27:20] the way of a little dog. I want to come
[1:27:22] and worship him that that everything
[1:27:24] that I have is free for him to feel.
[1:27:28] Everything that I've got, I want him to
[1:27:30] have it.
[1:27:32] Because one day, this old voice is going
[1:27:34] to be silenced. If time ticks on, this
[1:27:36] voice will lose its strength and won't
[1:27:38] be able to to sing as hard, sing as loud
[1:27:41] and preach as loud and strong. But one
[1:27:43] day, one day, everything that I've given
[1:27:47] every my life for will come into
[1:27:49] fulfillment
[1:27:51] into its fullness. So I say, what about
[1:27:55] today? Harboring a fugitive, I've got to
[1:27:58] hurry. Amen. Luke 4:18, the spirit of
[1:28:01] the Lord is upon me because he has
[1:28:03] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:28:04] poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[1:28:06] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:28:08] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:28:10] the blind. To set at liberty them that
[1:28:13] are bruised, them to set at liberty
[1:28:15] those that are trapped in their house
[1:28:17] because they've been harboring a
[1:28:19] fugitive.
[1:28:21] This word has come today to set you
[1:28:23] free, to give you sight, to set you at
[1:28:26] liberty. That word bruise means to
[1:28:29] break, break in pieces, shatter, smite
[1:28:35] through. 1949, I was not disobedient to
[1:28:38] the heavenly vision. The the prophet,
[1:28:39] I'm going to just read real quick
[1:28:40] through some of these things that that
[1:28:43] some of the healing lines. If you bear
[1:28:44] with me just a moment, I'll be I'll be
[1:28:46] done
[1:28:47] shortly. That's a good place for an
[1:28:52] amen. I know y'all just being nice,
[1:28:54] y'all. Word of life,
[1:28:57] folk. I've been with you long enough to
[1:29:00] know y'all just being nice. Brother
[1:29:03] Donnie be back shortly. He'll be back
[1:29:05] after a
[1:29:07] while. But you you got to deal with this
[1:29:10] whole spare tire till he gets back.
[1:29:12] Little donut Joel Brown.
[1:29:15] I look funny. I may feel and be a little
[1:29:18] funny on the ride, but guess what? I'm
[1:29:20] going to get you there.
[1:29:27] You don't think about that old spare
[1:29:28] till you need it, huh? You pull it out
[1:29:31] the trunk, it's all covered in dirt and
[1:29:34] a lot of times it's still flat. Got to
[1:29:37] pump it up before you put it
[1:29:39] on.
[1:29:41] Amen. But the prophet begins to to speak
[1:29:44] to a man that's come through the line.
[1:29:46] He has a tumor in his back and he says
[1:29:49] because of the condition that he's in,
[1:29:50] it's causing him to be nervous and he's
[1:29:53] had this condition for 30 years. 30
[1:29:56] years and begins to pray for him. He
[1:29:58] says, "Our heavenly father, we love you
[1:29:59] tonight and we believe that thou art now
[1:30:01] near to make whole our brother, breaking
[1:30:03] forth into the power of the enemy that
[1:30:05] has bound
[1:30:07] him and make him a new after practically
[1:30:10] all of his life. He's been bound by the
[1:30:13] power of the enemy harboring a fugitive.
[1:30:16] You've been bound practically all of
[1:30:18] your life with that thing, whatever that
[1:30:21] thing is." Wow.
[1:30:25] And this has been tested by many doctors
[1:30:27] and yet cannot help the man any. And he
[1:30:29] comes tonight, Father, to try his faith
[1:30:31] in thee, to try his faith. Try God's
[1:30:36] faith today. I'm just going to borrow
[1:30:38] some little thoughts, expressions as
[1:30:39] he's as he's using them. Thou knowest
[1:30:42] all things. How'd he do? You're a
[1:30:44] stranger to me also. I do not know you.
[1:30:45] Never seen you in my life. But God knows
[1:30:47] you. He knows all about you. Do you
[1:30:49] believe me to be his prophet? Well, if I
[1:30:51] be his prophet, then he will reveal your
[1:30:53] trouble like he did the woman at the
[1:30:54] well. You believe that? Now, just a
[1:30:56] moment. You've been in an awful
[1:30:58] condition of
[1:31:01] something. Some of you sitting here
[1:31:03] looking at me today. You've been in an
[1:31:05] awful condition of
[1:31:07] something. You've consulted. You can't
[1:31:10] even They can't even tell what's wrong
[1:31:12] with you. I see the doctor shake his
[1:31:14] head and say he couldn't
[1:31:16] understand. And y'all know how
[1:31:18] egotistical doctors can be, especially
[1:31:21] those cardiac
[1:31:23] guys, whatever that's
[1:31:26] for. And here's what it is. There's some
[1:31:28] kind of they're finding something about
[1:31:30] your urine. Isn't that right? Isn't that
[1:31:32] true? Isn't there pus or something got
[1:31:35] in the urine? Is that right? Yeah. And
[1:31:36] they can't tell where it's coming from.
[1:31:39] Come here, sister. Oh, God, be merciful.
[1:31:41] Satan, you might have hid from them
[1:31:43] doctors, but you can't hide from God.
[1:31:47] He knows right where you are. The word
[1:31:50] going forth today, harboring a fugitive.
[1:31:52] The word, he knows exactly where the
[1:31:55] devil is hiding. That's right. In fact,
[1:31:58] you know what room he's in. You know
[1:32:01] what which tile to pop out to get his
[1:32:03] attention.
[1:32:05] Is that right?
[1:32:09] Go to the seller the seller door. Are
[1:32:11] you hungry? Do you need something to
[1:32:12] eat? Harboring a fugitive. That snooker
[1:32:15] is going to take you down. His desire is
[1:32:17] to steal, to kill, and destroy you.
[1:32:21] We're calling 911. We're serving a
[1:32:24] warrant on the devil today.
[1:32:29] God knows right where you are. Come out
[1:32:31] of the woman in the name of Jesus
[1:32:32] Christ. Good evening, lady. You believe
[1:32:34] with all your heart you're trying,
[1:32:35] aren't you, sister? Yes, ma'am. Well, do
[1:32:37] not fear. You're s you're surprising
[1:32:39] yourself. There's been a time in your
[1:32:40] life where where you've been hindered. H
[1:32:44] where you you've had lots of trouble.
[1:32:46] You you've tried to have you've tried to
[1:32:48] have faith. You belong to the holiness
[1:32:50] people, the Pentecostal people or
[1:32:51] something. Isn't that right? I've seen
[1:32:53] you in the services where you're
[1:32:54] rejoicing and you're embarrassed. Watch
[1:32:56] this. And you're embarrassed sometimes
[1:32:58] when you're when you're you're trying.
[1:32:59] He's talking about suffering from
[1:33:01] tuberculosis. You cough a whole lot. And
[1:33:04] many times, watch this. Many times this
[1:33:06] fugitive in her home, many times you
[1:33:10] pretend that it's something else.
[1:33:14] her coughing a lot. She'll pretend it's
[1:33:15] something else instead of trying to
[1:33:17] admit that it's tubercular.
[1:33:20] Yeah.
[1:33:22] Well, honey, what's going on? What's
[1:33:23] wrong? Nothing. Yeah. Nothing. Nothing's
[1:33:28] wrong.
[1:33:29] You better admit that devil. Oh, what
[1:33:32] he's doing to you. You better find
[1:33:34] somebody to talk
[1:33:37] to. I know. Amen.
[1:33:40] It's just so old so Joel Brown harboring
[1:33:42] a fugitive
[1:33:44] and you're embarrassed sometimes you you
[1:33:45] you you cough a whole lot. Many times
[1:33:48] you pretend that it's something else
[1:33:49] instead of trying to admit that it's
[1:33:50] tubercular. You won't have to do that no
[1:33:52] more. Lady, this is going to be the hour
[1:33:54] for you to be healed. Come here. You
[1:33:55] believe me as God's servant. Almighty
[1:33:57] God, author of life, give grace to our
[1:33:59] sister tonight. Seeing her heart
[1:34:01] breaking down here. That thing was
[1:34:03] breaking down her heart. You're going
[1:34:06] back in there pulling out things in her
[1:34:08] life. Satan, I come in the
[1:34:10] representative name of Jesus Christ, the
[1:34:11] son of God. You've hid from doctor and
[1:34:13] all, but you can't hide from God. Amen.
[1:34:20] Amen. Almighty God, I've seen your light
[1:34:22] God testifying of his gifts flash around
[1:34:24] this woman. I believe that's the hour
[1:34:25] here of her healing sincerely and
[1:34:27] humbly. The spirit of God has moved in
[1:34:29] upon the woman. And oh Lord God, creator
[1:34:31] of heavens and earth and author of
[1:34:33] everlasting life. You said the prayer of
[1:34:35] praise shall save the sick and God shall
[1:34:38] raise them up. And oh, as I pray for the
[1:34:40] sick, I ask you, dear God, to move this
[1:34:43] tonight and heal this poor woman. May
[1:34:45] these headaches that's hurting her and
[1:34:47] bothering her and how, listen, how she's
[1:34:49] tried in every way that she could to get
[1:34:52] rid of it.
[1:34:54] You've tried and you've tried every
[1:34:57] which way to get rid of this thing.
[1:34:58] Today is the day of your salvation.
[1:35:02] I'm not here. here. I don't have the the
[1:35:03] gift, the discerning to tell talk about
[1:35:05] in your life. I'm not I'm not saying all
[1:35:07] of that. But what I'm saying is this.
[1:35:09] That word, this word is coming forth to
[1:35:11] let you know you don't have to stay in
[1:35:13] that condition. You don't have to harbor
[1:35:15] this fugitive any
[1:35:17] longer. That fugitive has broken the
[1:35:20] law. He's broken everything about this
[1:35:22] word that you can think
[1:35:24] imaginable. And he's in your house. It's
[1:35:26] time for him to go.
[1:35:31] H you've had some trouble too, haven't
[1:35:34] you? Ladies sitting there with a little
[1:35:35] red jacket on sitting right there.
[1:35:37] Doctors don't even know what's wrong
[1:35:38] with you. One says you got something
[1:35:39] wrong with your lungs and one says
[1:35:41] something wrong with your stomach. Isn't
[1:35:42] that right? They're all wrong. I'm not
[1:35:45] reading your mind, but you were sitting
[1:35:46] thinking about that then and wondering
[1:35:48] what would take place. Why don't you
[1:35:50] just raise up? Watch this. Why don't you
[1:35:52] just raise up and say, "Lord Jesus, I
[1:35:54] accept you as my healer." Amen.
[1:35:58] these conditions rumbling around in
[1:35:59] their mind, in their bodies, in their
[1:36:02] spirit, all of these things. All that
[1:36:04] you have to do today is just raise up
[1:36:06] within you and say, "Lord Jesus, help
[1:36:09] me."
[1:36:12] Amen. Cuz all of these things, you don't
[1:36:14] know what it is, and you've been here,
[1:36:15] and you've been there, done all of these
[1:36:17] things, and you've had all these tests,
[1:36:18] all of these probes. Why go to another
[1:36:21] doctor when you can receive healing
[1:36:22] today?
[1:36:24] Hallelujah.
[1:36:26] M I remember just a few weeks ago I was
[1:36:29] down in South Carolina and I I'd
[1:36:31] forgotten about it actually and and the
[1:36:33] sister I was talking to her after
[1:36:34] service and she was telling me, "Brother
[1:36:35] Joel, you know, when you was here last,
[1:36:37] she she was on oxygen. She had an oxygen
[1:36:39] tank with her." And again, I'd forgotten
[1:36:41] about I'd forgotten who she was and but
[1:36:43] she didn't have her oxygen tank anymore.
[1:36:45] And she was telling me had all these
[1:36:46] medications that she was no longer on.
[1:36:48] Why? Because she believed God.
[1:36:51] When the prayer was prayed, the hands of
[1:36:53] faith were laid upon our sister. She
[1:36:55] received what she believed that she
[1:36:57] could have. Amen.
[1:37:00] And it brought deliverance to her. She
[1:37:01] was no longer pulling a tank of oxygen
[1:37:04] to breathe. That's good. Praise the
[1:37:06] Lord.
[1:37:09] Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] Amen. Inner man. And now to obey his
[1:37:13] word, I lay my hands on yours. And in
[1:37:15] the name of Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:37:16] God, I loose this heart trouble as his
[1:37:19] representative. And now, Satan, you
[1:37:22] who've bound her and trying to take her
[1:37:24] to the grave yet aged. But our God
[1:37:26] doesn't look at age. And I come to serve
[1:37:29] a warrant on you as a representative of
[1:37:33] Calvary, as God's agent. And you cannot
[1:37:35] stay in this house any longer. You have
[1:37:37] to move
[1:37:38] out because it's the Holy Spirit, the
[1:37:41] detective of God who's here. And your
[1:37:43] secret places are
[1:37:46] revealed serving a war. That's what I
[1:37:48] want to do today. that fugitive that's
[1:37:50] in your home. I've come to serve a
[1:37:53] warrant. As a representative from God
[1:37:56] himself, I'm here to serve a war.
[1:37:58] There's somebody in your house. I'm here
[1:38:01] for the devil today. All right.
[1:38:08] My
[1:38:12] goodness. A resurrection.
[1:38:16] How can you expect to have a
[1:38:18] resurrection when there's been no death?
[1:38:24] If anybody ask you where I'm going, you
[1:38:27] sing that song and you worship is great.
[1:38:30] Anybody ask you where where are you
[1:38:32] going? I'm going up yonder, but you
[1:38:35] haven't died out to the things of the
[1:38:37] world. Right?
[1:38:39] Is that right? I came across something I
[1:38:42] want to share this with you just just
[1:38:43] just briefly.
[1:38:46] There was a a gentleman. He was an
[1:38:50] attorney. Um,
[1:38:53] and he's in the the the Guinnesses Book
[1:38:55] of Worlds Record is he's he had won the
[1:38:57] most successful lawyer. His name is uh
[1:39:00] uh Sir Lionel Luck. As a defense
[1:39:02] attorney, he won 245 murder trials in a
[1:39:05] row either before a jury or an on
[1:39:07] appeal. He died in 1997 97 at the age of
[1:39:10] 93 83 rather after a distinguished
[1:39:12] career. So he he he was success
[1:39:15] successful lawyer, one of the most
[1:39:17] successful lawyers. And so the the
[1:39:19] question was put to him, did Jesus
[1:39:21] really rise from the dead? And they knew
[1:39:24] if anybody through his skill and his
[1:39:26] success as being a an attorney would be
[1:39:29] able to answer that question. He came
[1:39:32] back in all of his his his his findings.
[1:39:34] He said it this way. He said, "I say
[1:39:36] unequivocally that the resurrection of
[1:39:39] Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it
[1:39:41] compels acceptance by proof, which
[1:39:44] leaves absolutely no room for doubt."
[1:39:48] There you go. So then this gentleman by
[1:39:51] the name of Dr. Gary Habermas, he's a
[1:39:53] leading expert on the evidence of the
[1:39:55] resurrection. And we won't even open our
[1:39:57] Bible up and read about the
[1:39:59] resurrection. And here this guy, he's
[1:40:01] devoted his
[1:40:02] life to studying about the resurrection
[1:40:05] to find evidence of the resurrection. He
[1:40:07] says it this this way, but uh um uh is a
[1:40:10] leading expert on evidence of the
[1:40:12] resurrection and the author of the case
[1:40:13] of the resurrection of Jesus. He
[1:40:15] received his PhD those that matters. He
[1:40:17] received his PhD from a secular
[1:40:19] university on the resurrection. He wrote
[1:40:20] his dissertation on the resurrection.
[1:40:23] Several years ago, he had a two-day
[1:40:24] debate with Anthony Flu. Watch what this
[1:40:26] guy does, what he what he's all about.
[1:40:28] He's a leading atheist on the
[1:40:34] resurrection. Five independent judges
[1:40:36] heard the debate. Four of them after
[1:40:38] hearing the cases of both atheism and
[1:40:40] Christianity said the case for
[1:40:42] Christianity was the most compelling.
[1:40:44] And Habermas won the debate. And when
[1:40:47] Dr. Habermas was asked, why do you spend
[1:40:49] so much of your life studying the
[1:40:51] evidence of the resurrection of Jesus?
[1:40:54] He said this. This so stirred me.
[1:40:58] Brother Don talks about those little
[1:40:59] spells he about has in his basement. I
[1:41:01] about have me
[1:41:02] one. He said, "Every shred of evidence
[1:41:05] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is
[1:41:08] also evidence of my eventual
[1:41:11] resurrection."
[1:41:14] And this was a God that does not believe
[1:41:16] what we believe.
[1:41:18] So every ounce of every speck of
[1:41:20] evidence that he could find proved to
[1:41:23] him was more evidence to him that he
[1:41:25] would eventually receive his
[1:41:27] resurrection.
[1:41:30] So we go into the article that I was
[1:41:32] reading goes into and talks about how
[1:41:34] Jesus dies. I said there can be no
[1:41:36] resurrection if there is no death
[1:41:38] because it's important to establish how
[1:41:40] the g gathering evidence of how Jesus
[1:41:43] died and and we just went through the
[1:41:45] season of of Easter. But happy Easter. I
[1:41:48] didn't get a chance to tell you then,
[1:41:49] but Easter is every day. So, how did
[1:41:52] Jesus die? After Jesus's trial, trial in
[1:41:56] which he was convicted of blasphemy
[1:41:58] because be because uh
[1:42:00] uh because he claimed to be God, he was
[1:42:04] sent to trial. Medical experts like Dr.
[1:42:07] Alexander Meatherall have studied the
[1:42:09] crucifixion from a medical perspective
[1:42:10] regarding what happened to Christ and
[1:42:12] others in the first century which when
[1:42:14] when they were foggged by a Roman
[1:42:15] centurion. Jesus was tied to a post
[1:42:19] harboring a fugitive. Now let me tell
[1:42:22] you the reason why you can be free
[1:42:23] today. Let me share these things with
[1:42:25] you. Tied to a post and beaten with a
[1:42:27] leather whip that had embedded in it
[1:42:29] sharp jagged pieces of sheetbone and
[1:42:31] balls of lead. The whip was brought down
[1:42:33] on his bare back, shoulders, and legs.
[1:42:35] First, the metal balls would create deep
[1:42:38] contusions and bruises which would then
[1:42:40] be broken open by later
[1:42:42] blows. The whip cut through the skin and
[1:42:45] there was profuse bleeding and in some
[1:42:47] cases the spine itself was exposed. Dr.
[1:42:51] Mether said Jesus's back would have been
[1:42:53] left hanging in ribbons.
[1:42:56] This one who gave his life. This one who
[1:42:58] went to Calvary. This one that we say we
[1:43:01] adore. This one that we sing about, that
[1:43:03] we worship, that we give our time and
[1:43:05] come and hear what the man of God has to
[1:43:08] say. Hanging in ribbons a mass of
[1:43:11] bleeding and torn tissue. Jesus would
[1:43:14] have been in serious to critical
[1:43:16] condition even before the crucifixion
[1:43:20] started.
[1:43:23] The Bible tells us Jesus wasn't able to
[1:43:26] carry his own cross to the crucifixion
[1:43:28] site. And now you know
[1:43:32] why. Even before he began the journey up
[1:43:35] that
[1:43:36] hill, he was at the point of
[1:43:40] death. Spikes 5 to seven inches long
[1:43:43] were first driven through his wrist.
[1:43:44] Harboring a fugitive. There's a large
[1:43:47] nerve that runs down your arm into your
[1:43:49] wrist. The spike that was driven through
[1:43:51] his wrist would have crushed the nerve.
[1:43:53] So intense was the pain of crucifixion.
[1:43:56] There was no word to describe the
[1:43:59] intensity of this
[1:44:01] pain. They had to invent a word to
[1:44:04] describe that pain. The word
[1:44:07] excruciating in Latin means out of the
[1:44:13] cross. So you say, "I was in
[1:44:15] excruciating pain." Oh no, you were not.
[1:44:18] I was in some pain the other day,
[1:44:21] but not like this.
[1:44:24] This one who gave his life. This one
[1:44:27] that's here today. This one that has
[1:44:28] come because you invited
[1:44:31] him. This one that decided to come
[1:44:34] because of your invitation to fill the
[1:44:36] room where you came. This this is what
[1:44:39] he did for
[1:44:41] you. Now Christ was hoisted vertically
[1:44:44] on the
[1:44:44] cross. Think about this. Your back is a
[1:44:47] bloody mass of tissue and you're
[1:44:49] scraping it up against the wood wood
[1:44:51] cross. You've got spikes in your feet
[1:44:52] and you push up to exhale. So there's a
[1:44:55] constant pushing up and down until
[1:44:57] exhaustion would set in. I won't read
[1:44:59] all of it. It just goes through several
[1:45:01] years ago. This this guy Gary Habermas
[1:45:04] um oh let's see. My
[1:45:07] goodness, I'm getting if the Romans
[1:45:09] wanted to hurry death, they would
[1:45:12] shatter the shin bones with a steel
[1:45:14] mallet. That of course meant you
[1:45:16] couldn't push up
[1:45:17] anymore. Your lungs would slowly fill
[1:45:20] with carbon dioxide and you would die.
[1:45:22] That's just what happened to the two
[1:45:23] thieves who were being crucified on
[1:45:25] either side of craw of of of Jesus.
[1:45:29] Medical evidence indicates that the
[1:45:31] spear was thrust between his ribs
[1:45:35] puncturing puncturing the sack
[1:45:37] surrounding his heart and the heart
[1:45:39] itself. Then four Roman experts who
[1:45:42] killed for a
[1:45:44] living declared officially that Jesus
[1:45:48] was
[1:45:49] dead. The truth
[1:45:51] is the truth is nobody came down from
[1:45:55] the cross alive in the first
[1:45:58] century. Not even Jesus
[1:46:02] Christ. The
[1:46:04] evidence of a resurrection is in a
[1:46:08] death.
[1:46:12] There was a song, a message song written
[1:46:14] years
[1:46:16] ago. If you're looking to rise, rise in
[1:46:19] the morning, you better get ready in the
[1:46:21] evening
[1:46:22] time. If you're looking for the voice,
[1:46:25] the voice of the resurrection, the voice
[1:46:27] is in the bride.
[1:46:30] Before you can receive that
[1:46:32] resurrection, you have to die out. Yeah.
[1:46:36] You have to give an opportunity for the
[1:46:38] authorities to come
[1:46:40] in and take that old booger
[1:46:43] captive. Today is the day of your
[1:46:47] salvation. Manifestation of the
[1:46:49] resurrection. Merciful father, watch
[1:46:51] this. As I stand with my hands laid upon
[1:46:54] the place that Satan has come
[1:46:56] to in the form of medical terms called
[1:46:59] TB, but thou can remove him, Father.
[1:47:02] Doctors may fail, but thou cannot fail.
[1:47:04] You can hide from the doctor, Satan, but
[1:47:06] you can't hide from God. You're exposed.
[1:47:09] Come out of the woman in the name of
[1:47:10] Jesus Christ. Leave her. May she be
[1:47:12] well. Blessings on you, sister. Go on
[1:47:14] your way in peace now. Rejoice and give
[1:47:16] Jesus Christ praise and glory is my
[1:47:18] prayer. Well, anything that Satan's put
[1:47:21] upon you as the musicians would
[1:47:23] come. Anything that Satan has put upon
[1:47:26] you in the way of sickness or whatever
[1:47:28] it
[1:47:30] is, every bornagain person has an
[1:47:33] abstract
[1:47:36] warrant, has a warrant from
[1:47:39] God. And the Holy Spirit is here to put
[1:47:41] any devil out.
[1:47:45] any
[1:47:46] devil. A devil of
[1:47:48] doubt, a devil of depression, a devil of
[1:47:52] suicide, a devil of
[1:47:54] discouragement, a devil of cancer.
[1:47:59] Amen.
[1:48:03] You have been given a warrant from
[1:48:06] God. Is that right?
[1:48:09] He was wounded for our transgressions,
[1:48:11] as we just read. In fact, he was more
[1:48:13] than
[1:48:15] wounded for our
[1:48:17] transgressions. With his
[1:48:19] stripes, and what stripes they
[1:48:23] were, we are
[1:48:27] healed. But you've got to go over and
[1:48:29] take
[1:48:34] it. The path to
[1:48:37] salvation, the way to deliverance is so
[1:48:39] simple.
[1:48:42] We complicate it.
[1:48:46] We delay it by our apprehension.
[1:48:50] We think, "Well, I'll I'll do it
[1:48:51] Wednesday night or I'll do it Sunday."
[1:48:53] What about today?
[1:48:56] What about
[1:48:58] today? Why are you
[1:49:01] waiting? You've been You were raised in
[1:49:03] this church. You were raised around
[1:49:06] godly things. You were raised in a
[1:49:08] Christian environment. Mom and dad were
[1:49:10] sure to keep you in that environment.
[1:49:12] Keep you around those
[1:49:14] things. Freely give your life to Jesus
[1:49:17] Christ
[1:49:20] today. What is it? You've been given
[1:49:22] that
[1:49:23] warrant. That fugitive is in your
[1:49:28] home. There's no need for him to stay
[1:49:30] there. Amen. Right.
[1:49:34] In fact, he's wanting to give you
[1:49:37] himself more than you'll ever know.
[1:49:40] These are things I know that you know.
[1:49:43] But the simplicity of the gospel is the
[1:49:46] pulsation of who I
[1:49:47] am. I don't want to be such that I
[1:49:50] complicate it to where well you know God
[1:49:52] said
[1:49:54] and the prophet said and they may not
[1:49:57] even know anything about what a prophet
[1:49:58] said. But if I can take my life and
[1:50:01] express what the prophet said without
[1:50:03] even saying the prophet said then that
[1:50:06] that will change so much. I want to live
[1:50:09] that way around my wife, my kids, my
[1:50:11] friends, my
[1:50:13] co-workers, the people at Lowe's, and
[1:50:17] that god forsaken place of Walmart.
[1:50:21] Wherever I go, I want to be Jesus
[1:50:23] Christ. Yeah. Amen.
[1:50:27] Amen. Do you love him? Yes. Isn't he
[1:50:31] wonderful? How about it, friends?
[1:50:42] How long are you going to continue to
[1:50:44] hold on? How long are you going to allow
[1:50:46] that condition to keep you a prisoner in
[1:50:50] your own home to where you can't be you?
[1:50:53] The joy that you once had. Restore that,
[1:50:56] Lord. The joy of salvation, the joy of
[1:50:59] coming to church, the joy of reading
[1:51:01] your Bible, the joy of praying, the joy
[1:51:03] of just being joyful. Amen. We live in a
[1:51:07] dark age as we know and and and the hell
[1:51:09] has enlarged itself. We know these
[1:51:11] things. But if we are the light, then
[1:51:14] let's be the light. Yeah. Amen.
[1:51:18] Time
[1:51:20] after time,
[1:51:22] I went
[1:51:25] searching for peace in some void.
[1:51:33] I was
[1:51:35] trying to blame all my
[1:51:40] ills on this world
[1:51:43] I was in.
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:51] surface
[1:51:53] relationships had used
[1:51:56] me till I was done
[1:52:04] in. And all the while
[1:52:10] someone was
[1:52:13] begging to free me from sin. Stand with
[1:52:18] me as we
[1:52:20] sing. He was
[1:52:25] there
[1:52:28] all all the
[1:52:32] time. He was
[1:52:36] there
[1:52:39] all the
[1:52:43] time waiting.
[1:52:51] in
[1:52:55] life. He was there. He's waiting for
[1:52:59] you. Won't you come and accept it? How
[1:53:03] about it? Never again. Sing it with me.
[1:53:07] Wo now.
[1:53:10] Never again will
[1:53:13] I go look
[1:53:17] for it's
[1:53:19] fake. It's just a
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] farce. Now that I
[1:53:27] have the
[1:53:29] answer, my life
[1:53:32] is just
[1:53:35] starting to rise.
[1:53:41] Oh,
[1:53:43] sharing each day with
[1:53:46] him is
[1:53:49] like a cup of fresh fresh life.
[1:53:58] And oh
[1:54:00] what I miss
[1:54:02] because he's been right there where you
[1:54:06] left him waiting
[1:54:08] all the time. Sing it done to him.
[1:54:13] Oh, he was
[1:54:17] there
[1:54:20] all the time.
[1:54:25] He was
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] there.
