[20:10] foreign
[20:12] [Applause]
[20:28] making plans that address change
[20:32] just a few moments ago before I come out
[20:35] I heard of one of our
[20:36] Brothers over in South Africa and his
[20:40] wife were heading to church today
[20:43] it's an automobile accidents pastor of a
[20:45] church
[20:46] he's
[20:48] moved on to Glory today
[20:50] changed his address
[20:52] when it all comes down to it no matter
[20:54] what we own why much we're worth the
[20:58] value of our property or anything like
[21:01] that when it comes to that time
[21:03] the only thing really matters is we're
[21:05] ready in it
[21:07] I trust that's our desire today
[21:10] we welcome you today
[21:12] the first official service
[21:14] Word of Life Church of Johnson City
[21:27] who had a little open house here
[21:29] Wednesday night but I guess officially
[21:30] we wasn't allowed to do that
[21:33] we actually had permission but we didn't
[21:35] have written permission but I got the
[21:37] certificate of occupancy I pulled out of
[21:40] the parking lot at the municipal place
[21:41] in Johnson City at 4 58 on Friday
[21:44] evening they close at 5.
[21:47] like everything else has been with this
[21:49] project we've done it's been to the
[21:51] right down to the last wire of
[21:53] everything
[21:55] but thank the lord we got it today so we
[21:57] can officially shout jump sing praise
[22:00] the Lord cry make an alder call
[22:09] whatever the Lord leads us to do today
[22:11] I trust this will be the beginning of
[22:14] many great times that we'll have
[22:16] together as the people of God
[22:18] we're grateful for it
[22:21] each of you I know are grateful to not
[22:24] have to go back to the Holiday Inn
[22:26] I'm grateful for the Holiday Inn as a
[22:29] place as a hotel but for a church and
[22:31] not so much but
[22:34] um each cold day I was sitting back
[22:37] there or night no heat so I sent back a
[22:41] freezing to death with my coat on
[22:44] so this morning I went in and had a
[22:46] really nice warm steady back there so
[22:50] many of you have complained of course
[22:52] your back hurt them with those seats and
[22:53] all that it was uncomfortable so I'll
[22:56] tell you what we have to do all them
[22:58] excuses we've got my last layer massage
[23:00] today
[23:01] so if y'all don't worship I'm gonna
[23:03] think oh
[23:05] so let's lay us out all of our excuses
[23:08] now I hope everybody's looked around
[23:09] everybody look around
[23:11] just look around
[23:13] say all that
[23:14] okay now you've seen that
[23:17] was helping our hearts to the Lord
[23:19] to see what he has for us today
[23:22] I believe we're living in a great hour I
[23:24] want you a great time
[23:26] turn with me if you would to the Book of
[23:28] Genesis chapter 4.
[23:33] I thought I knew what I was going to
[23:36] speak about today
[23:37] in our first service
[23:40] but about 10 minutes after nine
[23:43] the lord caught me up is what he had in
[23:46] his mind already
[23:48] I don't understand exactly why Desmond
[23:51] that way doesn't it went a lot I don't
[23:53] know if I'm that hard to hit it or what
[23:55] so needless to say I was a basket case
[24:00] um so I trust that you'll be able to
[24:02] make sense of it all today
[24:05] Genesis chapter 4 verse 1.
[24:08] and Adam knew his wife and she conceived
[24:11] and bear Cain
[24:13] and said I have gotten a man from the
[24:15] Lord
[24:17] she again bear his brother Abel and Abel
[24:20] was a keeper of sheep notice the
[24:23] difference in their occupation Abel was
[24:25] a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller
[24:30] of the ground
[24:32] and in process of time it came to pass
[24:35] that Cain brought the fruit
[24:37] of the grounds an offering unto the Lord
[24:42] and Abel he also brought the firstlings
[24:45] of his flock
[24:46] and of the fat thereof
[24:49] and the Lord had respect unto Abel
[24:52] notice the order the Lord had respect
[24:54] unto Abel
[24:57] and to his offering
[24:59] not his offering first
[25:02] but to him
[25:04] the Lord had respect unto Abel and to
[25:07] his offering but unto Cain again the
[25:11] person first instead of the offering but
[25:14] unto Cain and to his offering
[25:17] he had not respect
[25:19] and Cain was very Ross
[25:23] and his countenance fell
[25:27] we're going to Bow our heads together
[25:28] today I wonder how many would like to be
[25:30] remembered before the Lord and God bless
[25:32] each of you
[25:35] Heavenly Father we want to say with
[25:38] gratitude in our hearts
[25:40] we're so glad to be able to be gathered
[25:44] here today
[25:46] after many many plans and
[25:49] many many hours of work and so many have
[25:52] done so much Lord and we are thankful
[25:55] for each one for what they have done
[25:59] now Lord we're able to
[26:01] officially have our first service
[26:04] we're just so grateful today
[26:06] we're not coming to present a nice place
[26:09] we thank it that it is a nice place but
[26:12] we know that if we were here in a a
[26:15] brush Harbor or in the tent or we was
[26:18] gathered out under a tree
[26:20] Lord you would still be there because
[26:23] where your people are joined together is
[26:25] where you desire to be Lord Jesus we're
[26:28] asking you that you would help us today
[26:31] help me to get out of the way help me
[26:33] that I can be able to surrender myself
[26:36] father help the people to be able to
[26:38] receive from you
[26:40] granted Lord God I pray Heavenly Father
[26:43] for him
[26:45] brother retiefs family there in South
[26:48] Africa Lord it was your time to call our
[26:51] brother home today and heading to church
[26:55] and I imagine there's hundreds and
[26:57] hundreds of our brothers and sisters
[26:58] there their Pastor being taken and they
[27:01] are Weeping and crying and so sad now
[27:06] just trying to figure out what they will
[27:08] do and so on so we pray that you would
[27:11] be with them today Lord that you would
[27:13] comfort them another one of your
[27:15] children is made it safely across the
[27:18] Divide
[27:19] we ask you Lord that you would be with
[27:21] them help us now fathers we Endeavor to
[27:24] look into your word for it's in the name
[27:26] of the Lord Jesus we ask you
[27:29] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[27:32] you you may be seated
[27:38] I don't
[27:40] know thank you
[27:46] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[27:49] accepted worshipers
[27:52] accepted
[27:54] worshipers
[27:57] it must have been
[27:59] quite an awesome thing
[28:02] unlike what we're experiencing here
[28:04] today to where we've got a new facility
[28:08] of our own and feel like we've been kind
[28:10] of in the Feast of Tabernacles for the
[28:11] last four months we've been you know
[28:13] booths and here and there and there and
[28:15] whatever we can make best of but I think
[28:18] in all that there was still a reason for
[28:19] all that
[28:21] but our scene opens with the two first
[28:26] worshipers outside of the garden gate
[28:31] they both had been taught by the same
[28:34] parents
[28:36] they hadn't quite heard all the story
[28:39] that it brought them out of the Garden
[28:41] of Eden
[28:43] you see their parents were not quite
[28:46] honest with them
[28:48] they were not taught that it was blood
[28:50] that brought them out
[28:52] they were not taught exactly what their
[28:55] mother had done
[28:58] but yet God has a way of making himself
[29:00] known to his own whether you are taught
[29:03] the truth or not
[29:05] he will get the truth to you
[29:07] I think we all can say Amen to that
[29:10] because that's pretty much where all of
[29:11] us were
[29:12] and yet it was a an occasion that must
[29:17] have been a happy one it must have been
[29:19] both of them had come to a spot to her
[29:22] for whatever reason we have no account
[29:24] that they had done this before that had
[29:28] done this prior to this particular
[29:30] setting if they had Moses did not take
[29:33] account of it and it must have been
[29:35] something that they were given a notice
[29:38] on as it were Maybe by their father
[29:41] maybe directly by God we don't know for
[29:43] sure but somehow they both knew it was
[29:47] time for them to worship they knew it
[29:50] was time for them to come to the best
[29:54] they knew as an altar now remember
[29:56] neither of these boys had actually been
[29:59] inside the Garden of Eden all their life
[30:03] all they had known was living outside
[30:06] the garden gate
[30:08] so I can imagine they would walk up
[30:10] there from time to time and they would
[30:13] get close to where the cherubims were
[30:15] and they would see the flaming fire on
[30:18] both sides and they would feel an
[30:20] element of fear remember they had been
[30:23] born totally different than the way
[30:25] their mother and father had come into
[30:27] the Earth and they themselves had now
[30:30] been born with fear they'd been born
[30:33] with an element of trauma they had been
[30:36] born with an element of nervousness and
[30:39] all that sort of thing Adam created
[30:41] fresh from the hand of God didn't know
[30:43] what that was like neither did Eve but
[30:46] their boys did so you can imagine them
[30:49] as they would come near this big
[30:51] beautiful gate and they would ask why
[30:55] can we know not no longer go inside of
[30:58] that didn't you say you used to live
[31:00] there oh yes we used to live there we
[31:02] used to live there what was that lie oh
[31:05] boys it was it was more than you can
[31:08] comprehend yeah you you just cannot
[31:11] imagine what it was like to be inside of
[31:15] that place the great animals would come
[31:17] up to us and the birds would fly upon
[31:20] Papa's shoulder and they'd clue to him
[31:22] and he would name them the dinosaurs
[31:25] would come through the paradise of God
[31:27] there was no harm there was just as
[31:30] gentle as a little kitten and they would
[31:33] tell them over and what was it what was
[31:35] it that brought you all out well we will
[31:38] not go into the details of that that is
[31:40] not really something that we want to
[31:42] talk about it's not really something
[31:44] that we want to share with you boys
[31:46] maybe maybe maybe sometime later we'll
[31:49] tell you about it but yet on this
[31:51] particular time it had come a time for
[31:54] them to go to worship
[31:57] you see there's something about the
[31:59] heart of every individual whether they
[32:01] even believe in God or not there's
[32:04] something in them that caused them to
[32:07] worship and they will worship something
[32:09] they'll either worship God they'll
[32:11] worship a piano they'll worship a
[32:13] building they'll worship an idol they'll
[32:16] worship their wife themselves their
[32:18] mother their father it's in all human
[32:21] beings to worship some worship movies
[32:24] some worship their phone they worship
[32:27] social media they're more in contact
[32:29] with that than they are with God so
[32:31] that's what they worship so everybody
[32:33] will worship something now whether these
[32:36] boys had never worshiped God before or
[32:39] not the Bible doesn't really say but yet
[32:42] it opens up with this particular
[32:44] occasion to where that they are both
[32:47] notified they are made known that it's
[32:51] time for them to go to church as many of
[32:54] you no doubt today you knew we were
[32:56] going to have her first service and I
[32:58] woke up I don't know how many times
[33:00] during the night I woke up I don't know
[33:02] how many times during the morning kept
[33:05] looking over at my clock I've got one
[33:06] over on a dresser there kept looking at
[33:09] it looking at it scared to death so it's
[33:12] going to miss the first service which
[33:13] would be bad for the pastor wouldn't it
[33:15] so I'm looking at the clock okay I've
[33:17] got four more hours I've got five more
[33:19] hours whatever more and then finally you
[33:22] know it rolled around thought okay I got
[33:24] to get up so I was anxious needless to
[33:27] say and I Carol said you sleep very good
[33:29] off and on you she said well I was
[33:32] waking up going back to sleep waking up
[33:34] I was watching the clock yeah I said yes
[33:36] same here so it must have been a similar
[33:40] thing for them in that they were very
[33:43] anxious to know what to do it must have
[33:46] been very singular in that both of them
[33:49] had their own approach and only one of
[33:53] them is going to be accepted now you
[33:56] know God is obligated to make his way
[33:59] known to sincere Hearts oh I love him
[34:02] for that don't you and he wants to make
[34:04] himself known to those who are even out
[34:08] of his economy by election if they would
[34:11] only open their hearts and humble
[34:13] themselves to the way of the elect God
[34:17] would accept them as well but we're
[34:19] fixing to see the first setting where a
[34:22] hard-headed stubborn mortal on the earth
[34:25] refuses to listen to God
[34:29] and he also refuses to take advice and
[34:32] counsel from one who is more revelated
[34:35] than himself now that's always hard for
[34:39] one human being to do to another and yet
[34:42] this is the setting that we have today
[34:45] so the Bible then tells us that Cain had
[34:49] brought Adam knew his life and she
[34:51] conceived and barricade and said I've
[34:53] gotten a man from the Lord and she again
[34:55] bear his brother Abel and Abel was The
[34:58] Keeper of the sheep so we see their
[35:00] vocations are totally different now
[35:02] originally Man In The Garden of Edom he
[35:05] did not paint for a living He was not a
[35:07] plumber he was not an electrician he was
[35:10] not a computer scientist but man was
[35:12] actually a gardener so all man really
[35:16] had to do was to watch and just take
[35:19] care of what God had given Adam never
[35:22] had to make any plants and never had to
[35:24] hybrid any plants he never had to come
[35:27] up with any sort of new product it
[35:29] simply take care of what God gave him
[35:32] and Adam failed in doing that so he's to
[35:35] watch it and to keep it and yet because
[35:38] of his Disobedience now he's put out and
[35:42] everything is gone away with of what he
[35:44] knew in the Garden of Eden and now he's
[35:46] on the outside in the city-state as it
[35:50] were of the region still called Eden but
[35:53] no longer able to walk inside the garden
[35:57] so his boys are going to as they were
[36:00] identified they are going to come up and
[36:03] be able to worship now we know already
[36:05] there was something totally different
[36:07] about Cain we know that his nature was
[36:10] different than different seed lines and
[36:13] now he's going to reflect where he's
[36:15] from by how he goes to church
[36:19] now listen what the Bible says in the
[36:22] process of time it came to pass that
[36:24] Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[36:27] and offering to the Lord now there would
[36:29] not seem unusual to a carnal-minded man
[36:33] of the world because this is all he knew
[36:36] this is what he done so he tilled the
[36:39] ground he was as what we would say today
[36:41] was a farmer and Adam himself had now
[36:44] moved outside of the garden gate and he
[36:47] also no doubt had started tilling and he
[36:50] had done many various things but somehow
[36:52] there was a difference in this in that
[36:55] Cain is going to use this his occupation
[36:59] his job as a means to come to worship
[37:03] God now notice his first error is that
[37:07] he believes his Works will get him favor
[37:11] in the eyes of God let me tell you right
[37:13] now it will never do it there's only one
[37:17] thing that will make us accepted and God
[37:19] God's eyes and that is we accept first
[37:22] God's provided way for our day
[37:25] other than that we're lost now but Cain
[37:28] he has this idea now we know that they
[37:32] were taught the prophet tells us over
[37:33] and over again they were taught that it
[37:36] was fruit that brought them out of the
[37:38] garden of Edom so all he's doing is
[37:42] simply bringing back what he was taught
[37:45] so he was taught it was fruit so what's
[37:48] he do he brings maybe beautiful
[37:50] vegetables and fruits and plants and as
[37:53] I said he must have had a little bit of
[37:55] a warning an inclination and he has an
[37:58] idea that he's going to have a little
[37:59] bit of time to prepare this so he
[38:01] brought forth maybe his best cantaloupes
[38:04] his best tomatoes his best cucumbers his
[38:08] best corn and his best of this and that
[38:10] and that and we'll just say later
[38:12] variety out before the presence of God
[38:15] and they come near to where this altar
[38:18] was at the garden gate now they never
[38:20] ventured to go exactly where it was but
[38:23] as close as they felt comfortable in
[38:25] going
[38:26] and while he lays it there and opens up
[38:29] in all almighty God I bring before it to
[38:33] you the very best that I have I have
[38:37] labored I have sweated I have done this
[38:40] and I have done that you understand
[38:42] where I'm going I have done something
[38:44] else and God I pray that you will take
[38:48] all this work of my hands
[38:52] and while he's doing it I hear a ruckus
[38:57] I hear a noise
[39:00] I hear something that is so different
[39:04] than what he is doing
[39:07] and I look as I'm standing there with
[39:10] them
[39:11] and I see Abel
[39:15] now whenever Eve named Cain
[39:20] she said I have gotten which is acquired
[39:24] I have gotten a man from the Lord now
[39:28] that that's the King James version
[39:31] but if you look in other versions you'll
[39:34] find out she said I have gotten a man
[39:37] with
[39:38] the Lord
[39:41] not from him
[39:43] but she actually believes she had been
[39:47] with God
[39:50] and the product of that Union
[39:53] was Cain
[39:56] and we know of course they were Twins
[39:59] and Cain was first being the firstborn
[40:01] and then Abel was born and she calls him
[40:06] vained
[40:09] vain
[40:11] shortness of life
[40:13] not very valuable
[40:18] I don't want you to just look this
[40:20] morning at two ancient names of the
[40:23] scripture but I want you to identify
[40:26] yourself
[40:28] with these two boys because in reality
[40:31] all of our life's story is written here
[40:34] in Genesis 4.
[40:36] there is a part of you that was the
[40:39] firstborn
[40:41] your flesh
[40:43] and the second born is your able
[40:47] which is your seed
[40:49] your soul
[40:51] the firstborn is always the one that
[40:54] wants to be the boss
[40:57] and you know what our cane will do his
[40:59] best to kill our able
[41:02] but don't let your cane kill your Abel
[41:07] you've got control over that cane
[41:10] that's right
[41:12] so Cain was the first one notice the
[41:16] order so he's the firstborn he has the
[41:18] birthright he has as it would be the
[41:21] order of the priesthood he's the one
[41:24] that would have the first approach to
[41:26] God seemingly
[41:28] and yet he comes first and he's allowed
[41:31] to be there before the altar of God and
[41:33] the presence of God as close as he could
[41:35] come and then Here Comes Abel
[41:39] and Abel I can see him as he gets a
[41:41] little a little lamb without a spot or a
[41:44] blemish and now we know this is totally
[41:47] contrary to what his father taught him
[41:50] his daddy and his mother told him over
[41:52] and over again it was fruit it was fruit
[41:55] that brought us out of the garden of
[41:57] Edom we ate the wrong thing we ate an
[42:01] apple we ate a pomegranate we ate you
[42:03] know we ate the wrong thing and of
[42:05] course that's why God told them to put
[42:07] clothes on because they ate an apple
[42:10] well as it's been said if eating apples
[42:13] makes people realize they're naked we
[42:15] better buy a whole bushel of them
[42:18] and go to Walmart start passing them out
[42:20] maybe some folks will start putting more
[42:22] clothes on
[42:23] but we know it was not an apple it was
[42:26] Disobedience to God's word
[42:28] and here comes Abel and he has a lamb
[42:33] and he tied a grapevine because there
[42:36] was no rope so he tied a grapevine
[42:39] around that Lamb's neck and he's pulling
[42:42] it to his altar
[42:44] and here is ableist or he's coming with
[42:48] tears and he said all emotional and all
[42:52] worked up and as he's coming and and
[42:55] Cain is just finishing his prayer
[42:57] remember Cain was a very religious man
[43:00] as a matter of fact the prophet tells us
[43:02] he was much more religious than Abel
[43:05] ever was
[43:07] to be honest with you I don't want to be
[43:09] religious I want to be right
[43:12] eousness is not necessarily being
[43:14] religious but righteousness is having
[43:17] rights standing with God I ain't worried
[43:20] about being religious today and I don't
[43:22] want to bring any of you to religion so
[43:24] much I want to bring you to Christ Jesus
[43:27] so you can be righteous before his
[43:30] presence is that what you want with all
[43:32] your hearts
[43:34] so Abel comes now and came maybe just
[43:38] finishing up maybe holding his hands a
[43:40] certain way and his elbows laying it on
[43:43] me all turn you know fixing his face to
[43:46] where that it was what he thought was an
[43:48] identification of sincerity and bringing
[43:51] it to almighty God and God did not say a
[43:56] word
[43:57] God did absolutely nothing
[44:01] there was no Heavenly reaction
[44:05] to Cain's offering
[44:09] so here comes Abel and he's pulling this
[44:13] little lamb and the Little Lamb
[44:22] an able pulling on him and pulling on
[44:25] him
[44:26] and the dust kicking up from his legs
[44:29] and here he comes tears running down his
[44:32] cheeks
[44:34] knowing that he's already accepted
[44:36] before he offers it to God
[44:39] Hallelujah you see how can you say that
[44:42] he hadn't even he hadn't even broke the
[44:44] blood cell of the Lamb he knew he was
[44:46] accepted because God gave him the Divine
[44:49] approach
[44:51] you see before he ever offered the lamb
[44:54] God accepted him and he accepted the
[44:58] lamb because of who he was
[45:01] he accepted the person the worshiper now
[45:06] we know that being Sunday of course that
[45:08] all over the world today already in
[45:11] Australia New Zealand and Asia and
[45:14] Africa in different parts of the world
[45:16] people have already went to their Sunday
[45:18] service and their seven eight hours
[45:20] ahead of us some of that farther away
[45:22] depending on the International Date Line
[45:24] where they cross it and they've already
[45:26] had their Sunday morning service and
[45:28] they've worshiped God and they've
[45:30] offered their praise and but I wonder
[45:32] how many of them the Lord God actually
[45:35] accepted
[45:36] you see people say well whatever I get
[45:39] him he will he will take it no no he
[45:41] won't he will take only what his
[45:45] provided way says he will take he's not
[45:48] like you and I to well we're saying well
[45:50] if I get up and I give God this so that
[45:52] God will take it God said no I simply
[45:54] will not refuse I will refuse whether
[45:57] you're offering if you don't come my
[45:59] provided way
[46:01] now you imagine by this time that kind
[46:03] of came is standing there and he's
[46:05] looking at his brother and he's thinking
[46:07] what in the world is the matter with him
[46:10] you little Holy Roller you loud outfit
[46:14] where is your church order where don't
[46:17] you know how to worship oh but he does
[46:19] but he's so different from His Highest
[46:22] brother that his half-brother is looking
[46:24] at him and trying to figure out what in
[46:26] the world is going on now remember this
[46:29] is a very religious man so Abel the
[46:33] scripture says abroad of the firstlings
[46:35] of the flock and of the fact thereof and
[46:37] the Lord had respect unto Abel first and
[46:43] to his offering not the other way around
[46:45] it wasn't that God looked at the
[46:48] offering and said okay the offering is
[46:50] good so I accept the offering and now I
[46:52] accept you God accepted Abel and on that
[46:56] basis he accepted his offer you said
[46:58] well how can that be how was it
[47:01] had already proved his approval of Abel
[47:04] by giving him a divine revelation
[47:08] now there was no Bible in that day
[47:10] remember no Genesis Moses is writing
[47:13] this hundreds and hundreds of years
[47:15] after actually thousands of years after
[47:17] that it took place so there was no
[47:19] written bible there was no table there
[47:22] was no prophets there was nobody there
[47:24] there was no church there was no Pastor
[47:27] even his mother and father taught him
[47:29] wrong but God wanted to make sure he
[47:32] knew the right way to worship you see
[47:35] God is obligated to his own to bring the
[47:38] way of righteousness to his own I'm so
[47:41] grateful for that today where would you
[47:43] and I be today friends had it not been
[47:45] for that was anybody in here taught
[47:47] wrong besides me I tell you the more I
[47:50] realize about God the more I realized
[47:52] how much I didn't even know about God
[47:54] and God by his grace brought us to his
[47:57] truth and it was not because of the
[47:59] truth I knew that brought me to him that
[48:02] it was because of this truth I was born
[48:05] of his bone and spirit of his spirit and
[48:07] life as a his life I was part of him
[48:10] before I ever even knew I was part of
[48:12] him so he accepted that on Abel and he
[48:17] gives him a divine revelation I tell you
[48:20] we may be poor people we may be
[48:22] middle-class people we may be lower
[48:24] class people but if we're sitting here
[48:26] today and God has given to us a
[48:29] revelation of who he is and who we are
[48:32] and where we're going and what it's
[48:34] going to take to get there we ought to
[48:36] be one happy group of people
[48:40] praise the Lord
[48:43] oh my
[48:46] now
[48:48] the story turns
[48:51] we've got Abel in verse 4 which is
[48:55] accepted
[48:57] Watch What Happens in verse five but
[48:58] unto Cain until his offering
[49:01] he had not respect God doesn't even
[49:04] answer Cain he doesn't even say anything
[49:06] about Cain's offering until after Abel
[49:10] offers his
[49:13] so now this is going to place Cain in
[49:16] bad light but not just in the eyes of
[49:19] God
[49:21] not just because of God
[49:24] but because of his brother
[49:27] his brother made him look like a bad
[49:32] person
[49:36] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[49:38] not respect and Cain was very Roth
[49:43] and his countenance failed
[49:46] now Moses had a reason for writing that
[49:49] in those terms
[49:51] so Cain comes up to the altar and he has
[49:55] the smile as it was this this appearance
[49:58] of knowing that he's going to be
[50:01] accepted so he comes oh my must have
[50:04] just been so upbeat he was so happy all
[50:07] praise God God's going to accept me
[50:10] today I'm going to be able to walk into
[50:12] his presence and maybe who knows who
[50:14] knows God may even let me back inside
[50:16] the garden gate Mom and Daddy's told me
[50:19] that it's him there and they told me how
[50:20] great it was maybe God will let me back
[50:23] in and he's coming with such
[50:25] anticipation and he's so excited and it
[50:28] must have been a look upon his countless
[50:30] it was just beaming with joy and Yuri
[50:34] standing the whole time and then a
[50:36] little bit of something affects him as
[50:38] his brother comes and he's still
[50:39] standing there hopeful that God's going
[50:41] to let him back in and then when God
[50:44] when God performs a miracle
[50:48] and sends down a streak of fire out of
[50:52] heaven
[50:53] and consumes Abel's offering
[50:57] Theo De cushy Theo De Cushing
[51:01] God looked intently on Abel's offering
[51:05] God didn't just look at it but God
[51:08] looked with such intentness
[51:11] That Fire come out of Heaven is the word
[51:15] theodicishing Fire come out of Heaven
[51:18] from the presence of God and ignited
[51:22] that lamb and God burn it up
[51:28] but God made not a move
[51:32] when Cain
[51:34] offered his
[51:37] so here is the Holy Ghost and Fire
[51:41] praise the Lord
[51:43] identified with Abel's offering
[51:47] this is why I still believe in the Holy
[51:49] Ghost and Fire not the Holy Ghost and
[51:52] Ashes
[51:53] I don't want just ashes of what we used
[51:56] to have anybody say amen I don't want
[51:58] just ashes well we used to do this and
[52:01] we used to praise God we used to worship
[52:04] God shame on you if you just used to do
[52:07] it you ought to do it now more than
[52:09] you've ever done in your life
[52:11] we got more to praise him for we got
[52:14] more to thank him for
[52:17] but you can imagine now so the prophet
[52:20] tells us this when the Harvest Time by
[52:22] revelation of the word God's word before
[52:24] it was even written you see God's word
[52:27] was already allocated in the heavens and
[52:29] God has never had a new thought God has
[52:31] never even spoken new word so every page
[52:34] of the scripture every book of the Bible
[52:37] every word that every Prophet would ever
[52:39] say was already in the mind of God
[52:41] before the foundation of the world and
[52:43] that's why God by Revelation would deal
[52:45] with these prophets in this Supernatural
[52:47] Majestic form that God would convey from
[52:50] his own mind something he wanted them
[52:53] prophets to catch and they was of direct
[52:55] contact oh my from the presence of God
[52:58] straight to their soul how in the realm
[53:01] of vision the fourth dimension they were
[53:03] able to go into that realm and God would
[53:05] project it was such a perfect channel
[53:07] that Satan could never get into it
[53:10] unlike you and I well I feel led to do
[53:12] this and I feel that and we've all felt
[53:14] led to do a lot of things that turned
[53:16] out to be the devil well go ahead and
[53:18] say Amen you have but when God wanted to
[53:21] secure a way that was so infallible he
[53:25] chose a prophet and he chose the means
[53:27] to project his time by the way of vision
[53:29] it was so perfect it could not be broken
[53:32] that's why when a prophet would say thus
[53:34] saith the Lord there are enough devils
[53:37] in hell to stop it from happening is
[53:39] that right this is where we hang our
[53:41] soul today
[53:42] so when God projects this before there
[53:45] was ever any prophets God projects this
[53:47] Revelation straight to the heart of Abel
[53:50] and Abel does this all according to the
[53:52] revelation of God
[53:54] and now God vindicates it
[53:58] it's not enough for you and I to say I
[54:00] believe God with all of my heart
[54:02] we need the sign of our exception
[54:07] which is what mother Donnie the token
[54:10] the Holy Ghost and Fire
[54:13] oh well I I picked out my Pew here in
[54:15] the new building I'm going to be there
[54:17] every time you have a service that's my
[54:19] sign I'm a Believer no that's just being
[54:21] faithful to your post of Duty you're
[54:23] supposed to be at your post of Duty is
[54:25] that right but that does not mean that
[54:27] God has accepted you God wants to see
[54:31] the token on display in every life and
[54:34] God doesn't want it to be just by well I
[54:37] join a church I sign a book I attend the
[54:39] church I believe every word the prophet
[54:41] said that's just being able to read God
[54:43] wants that stamp of approval on your
[54:46] soul and on my soul that we have passed
[54:49] from Death unto life when did the fire
[54:52] come and consume the lamb after the lamb
[54:56] was dead when do you and I get the Seal
[54:59] of the Holy Ghost on our soul what our
[55:02] first nature is dead we are no longer
[55:06] just church members we are no longer
[55:08] trying to live right well I'm going to
[55:10] turn over a new Leaf it takes more than
[55:13] turning over a new Leaf I'm going to try
[55:15] to be a good person I went to the
[55:18] library yesterday brother Donnie and I
[55:20] checked out how to be a better Christian
[55:22] and I've got a whole library of
[55:25] self-help books you might as well start
[55:27] a fire with them because they'll never
[55:29] get you to heaven there's only one way
[55:31] you can ever get there and that is by
[55:34] God's way accepting what God did and God
[55:38] accepting you has given you the baptism
[55:41] of the Holy Ghost
[55:45] you can hold that token in Satan's face
[55:49] and say back off devil
[55:53] cancer gets a hold of your body you can
[55:55] hold your token and say turn me loose
[55:58] [Applause]
[55:59] Satan grabs a hold of one of your kids
[56:02] or your husband or your wife you can
[56:04] hold that token before you and say Satan
[56:07] take your hand off of my daughter take
[56:10] your hand off of my son
[56:21] well wouldn't this be the natural thing
[56:22] to do so you got confidence in your
[56:24] daddy
[56:26] so-called
[56:27] your confidence in your mama
[56:30] they tell you it was an apple
[56:32] so what do you do you go to an apple
[56:34] tree
[56:35] you pull down a red delicious a Golden
[56:38] Delicious you pull down the Fiji you
[56:41] pull down this one you pull down that
[56:42] one you someone I'm not sure exactly
[56:44] what Apple it was but I'm just going to
[56:46] offer God all these fruits and I'm going
[56:48] to polish them they are going to be so
[56:50] beautiful
[56:51] I'm gonna throw in a few cantaloupes
[56:53] maybe a watermelon who knows some figs
[56:55] I'm going to make God so overwhelmed
[56:58] there's no way God will be able to turn
[57:01] me down I'm going to buy the Widow Some
[57:03] Coal I'm going to buy some groceries for
[57:06] some good people and I'm going to do
[57:07] this and that woman I get up to heaven
[57:09] there ain't no way God will turn me down
[57:11] he will if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[57:15] he will if you don't come his provided
[57:17] way
[57:18] is that right Saints
[57:21] you see the Hebrew word that Moses chose
[57:24] to use that I found this amazing it was
[57:27] a look that was so keen and Earnest and
[57:31] a penetrating glance
[57:34] penetrating glands
[57:37] and then the Theologian theodosian in
[57:41] the the Greek translator in the second
[57:42] century use this this word that I've
[57:45] been claiming to you and it means to be
[57:48] kindled or set on fire
[57:51] or ignite it
[57:53] I hope that's what the Lord God does to
[57:56] every member of this church
[57:58] all many of you have had the Holy Ghost
[57:59] for years and years but I dare said we
[58:02] could probably take a refilling this
[58:04] morning
[58:06] I want you to notice tournament in
[58:08] Hebrews if you would chapter 11 verse 4.
[58:11] and Paul catches this sometime years
[58:14] later after this and he said by faith
[58:16] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[58:21] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[58:25] witness that he was righteous
[58:30] God testifying of his gifts
[58:34] and by it being dead yet speak us I
[58:39] notice him so Abel's Abel's blood had a
[58:43] voice
[58:45] so Abel's blood had a voice Abel was
[58:50] dead Paul said being dead yet speaketh
[58:54] what what was it that spoke the blood
[58:57] had a voice
[58:59] and Moses when he takes the account of
[59:03] course he doesn't pull it through the
[59:05] cross but Paul is identifying that there
[59:08] was something more than just a natural
[59:11] fruits and vegetables something more
[59:13] than an animal but supernaturally God
[59:17] had given this man a witness and he
[59:20] obtained this from God that he was
[59:23] righteous that's offering isn't this
[59:25] what it's all about being accepted you
[59:28] know it's not only for church people but
[59:30] the majority of the people in the world
[59:32] they want to be accepted so why did they
[59:36] dress a certain way why do they do a
[59:38] certain thing why do they hang around
[59:39] certain people because they want to be
[59:42] accepted in that group of people is that
[59:44] right no it's not necessarily wrong to
[59:47] want to be accepted I think we all do
[59:49] but it depends on who you were wanting
[59:52] to be accepted by
[59:55] most of you probably feel that way do
[59:57] you not today I've always wanted to be
[59:59] accepted most of my life and yet there's
[1:00:01] always been categories of people I have
[1:00:04] never been accepted in and there will
[1:00:06] always be that now I realize as I've
[1:00:08] gotten older that my category of people
[1:00:11] that I want to be accepted in has also
[1:00:14] changed so I don't want to be accepted
[1:00:16] in the upper echelon of America I do not
[1:00:20] want to be accepted in the great people
[1:00:22] of the world what they would call great
[1:00:23] but what I desire to be accepted in is
[1:00:27] by almighty God and by his children I
[1:00:30] don't figure there's any higher category
[1:00:32] of people on the Earth than the seed of
[1:00:35] God did anybody say Amen to that and yet
[1:00:38] many of you young people know what it's
[1:00:40] like you may want to hang around a
[1:00:42] certain group of our youth or you may go
[1:00:44] to a youth camp and you say oh I like to
[1:00:47] make friends with them and no matter how
[1:00:49] hard you try it seems you're not
[1:00:51] accepted maybe your clothes aren't nice
[1:00:53] enough or you don't come from my nice
[1:00:55] enough family and it really bothers you
[1:00:57] because you're not accepted or I would
[1:00:59] to God that we was that concerned about
[1:01:02] being accepted by God like we are people
[1:01:05] we go to church with and people that we
[1:01:07] will meet at a young Youth Camp or maybe
[1:01:09] a certain chat or something on Facebook
[1:01:12] or Instagram and you say well nobody's
[1:01:14] invited me to join that chat nobody will
[1:01:17] let me be a part of well I'll tell you
[1:01:19] today almighty God is right here in this
[1:01:22] building and if you're not saved and you
[1:01:24] don't know him he is making you the most
[1:01:27] awesome offer you would ever be able to
[1:01:29] give and that is to be accepted into
[1:01:33] beloved to be accepted Hallelujah in the
[1:01:36] body of Jesus Christ and to be accepted
[1:01:39] in the Rapture and the change
[1:01:43] oh my
[1:01:46] God oh God help us
[1:01:49] unto Abel and his offering
[1:01:52] notice accepting the person
[1:01:56] before accepting the gift
[1:01:59] notice this the prophet tells us Cain
[1:02:02] maybe it's all they're just as pretty
[1:02:04] prettier than Abel's well of course it
[1:02:07] would have been prettier because you
[1:02:09] would lay out the fruits and the
[1:02:11] vegetables maybe you know use a little
[1:02:14] bit of greenery one of the good things
[1:02:16] for broccoli
[1:02:17] wow use broccoli for decoration and
[1:02:20] parsley you know and some of that stuff
[1:02:22] and then you lay it all out and you just
[1:02:24] decorate it so beautifully and then
[1:02:26] you'd have something real real beautiful
[1:02:28] and outstanding in the middle of it and
[1:02:30] then you lay all these other things
[1:02:32] around there you come and say oh God I'm
[1:02:35] so impressed myself wow look what I've
[1:02:38] done look at what I've done
[1:02:41] and then your brother comes up and he
[1:02:43] builds his altar
[1:02:45] maybe out of Refuge Stone it's not
[1:02:48] pretty at all it's not beautiful
[1:02:52] he takes that lamb and he doesn't have a
[1:02:55] knife as we would today but a sharp rock
[1:02:57] with an edge on it maybe a piece of
[1:03:00] flint or something and he goes to hack
[1:03:02] it
[1:03:08] not a little love uh
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:14] the blood is getting in its and it's
[1:03:17] throat and it's choking
[1:03:20] the hot blood spewing out all over
[1:03:22] Adam's or Abel's clothes
[1:03:26] oh God
[1:03:28] the blood all over the altar
[1:03:31] and your can stands King I cannot
[1:03:34] believe him
[1:03:36] he thinks that's Church
[1:03:39] he thinks that's the way you're supposed
[1:03:42] to behave in church
[1:03:46] afraid we've still got a few Canaanites
[1:03:48] hanging around us
[1:03:50] oh my anybody go to cry and go to
[1:03:52] standing up and raving their hands to
[1:03:54] the Lord they think there's something
[1:03:56] wrong with you well we think the
[1:03:57] opposite we think there's something
[1:03:59] wrong with you if you don't want to do
[1:04:00] it oh my god there ought to be something
[1:04:03] inside of us that wants to praise the
[1:04:06] Living God
[1:04:10] you imagine as Abel realizes this lamb
[1:04:13] is dying in his Stead
[1:04:15] the slam is taking his place and the
[1:04:19] tears now trickling out of his eyes
[1:04:21] mingling with the blood of the lamb and
[1:04:23] there he stands an absolute mess he
[1:04:27] looks like a butcher
[1:04:30] a picture
[1:04:32] how could anyone with love
[1:04:35] butcher this innocent
[1:04:42] he wanted to be
[1:04:44] accepted
[1:04:49] it friends as you're a pastor I want you
[1:04:52] to love me
[1:04:54] I want you to love me I want you to
[1:04:56] appreciate the good things God does to
[1:04:59] us
[1:05:00] but if ever one of you turned me down
[1:05:03] turn your back on me out to this service
[1:05:05] and say we don't want you no more
[1:05:09] we wanted to use you just long enough
[1:05:11] till you had finished this building and
[1:05:13] now we've got somebody else in mind
[1:05:18] now that would be painful to me
[1:05:20] it would break my heart
[1:05:23] but more than you accepting me
[1:05:26] I want him to accept
[1:05:30] when you and I come to Crossing that
[1:05:33] Great River
[1:05:34] Called Death
[1:05:36] mama won't be there Daddy won't be there
[1:05:39] even the pastor can't be there
[1:05:41] just a little while ago and our brother
[1:05:44] over in South Africa a few hours ago got
[1:05:47] ready to cross the sun couldn't be there
[1:05:49] his wife couldn't be there she was in
[1:05:52] the automobile listen
[1:05:53] but she's in the hospital in intensive
[1:05:55] care
[1:05:56] but when it come to crossing over
[1:05:59] the only one that could be with him was
[1:06:01] the Lord
[1:06:03] oh he was known around the world a man
[1:06:06] of Honor reputation among many many
[1:06:08] people in South Africa of course and in
[1:06:11] different parts of the world
[1:06:13] and yet none of those people saying well
[1:06:16] accept him Lord accept them that's not
[1:06:19] enough our brother would have to have
[1:06:21] the fire
[1:06:23] you see us when God looks upon the
[1:06:27] sacrifice you see people many of them to
[1:06:29] this face who cannot understand why the
[1:06:31] Lord Jesus had to suffer the way that he
[1:06:33] did the wrath of God was being taken out
[1:06:37] again on the Lamb of God this time not a
[1:06:41] four-legged lamb but a two-legged Lamb
[1:06:43] with a soul you see that four-legged
[1:06:46] lamb of Abel did not have a soul so the
[1:06:50] innocency of that lamb could not come
[1:06:53] back into Abel but when the Lamb of God
[1:06:56] died on the cross blade him and weeping
[1:06:59] and crying my God my God why hast Thou
[1:07:03] forsaken me what was it he was making a
[1:07:06] way so we could sit here this morning in
[1:07:08] the month of February 2023 and some of
[1:07:12] us being our background drunks and
[1:07:14] adulterers and idolaters and liars and
[1:07:17] Among Us and everything else you
[1:07:18] can imagine but here we set today with
[1:07:21] the spirit of God cleansing our soul and
[1:07:24] ways in our hands before almighty God
[1:07:27] and God saying I accept you I accept
[1:07:31] your worship I accept your praise
[1:07:34] because I accept you
[1:07:41] oh
[1:07:43] notice the prophet goes on to say in the
[1:07:45] bottom part of this quote God Vindicated
[1:07:47] Abel by consuming
[1:07:50] his sacrifice
[1:07:53] so God consumed
[1:07:56] able sacrifice
[1:07:59] then what Abel has is the token so God
[1:08:03] didn't let the fire go over unable and
[1:08:05] lick all the blood
[1:08:07] off of Abel but Abel has the chemistry
[1:08:11] all over him
[1:08:13] you imagine he must have looked like a
[1:08:16] mess wonder what you and I would have
[1:08:18] thought brother Larry that Dave had been
[1:08:19] standing near and see this guy must say
[1:08:22] where have you been
[1:08:24] where have you been to the
[1:08:26] slaughterhouse
[1:08:27] no I've been to church
[1:08:32] blood all over his hands brought all
[1:08:34] over his clothes blood all over his face
[1:08:36] all mingled together with tears and he's
[1:08:38] shouting a little bit as he goes back
[1:08:40] rejoicing praise God praise God you're
[1:08:43] saying what in the world are you so
[1:08:44] happy for because God received me and
[1:08:47] because God accepted me God accepted my
[1:08:50] sacrifice and the Reason God accepted my
[1:08:53] sacrifice because it was the right one
[1:08:55] he made it known to me what he would
[1:08:58] accept I simply carried out what he said
[1:09:00] Lord friend we expect to be
[1:09:02] misunderstood we expect to be lifetime
[1:09:04] ridicule made fun of him but really in
[1:09:07] reality that don't matter what matters
[1:09:09] is we know when it's all said and done
[1:09:12] we will be accepted by the Lord God
[1:09:15] because we accept his atonement for our
[1:09:19] sins
[1:09:19] [Applause]
[1:09:24] oh my so here we are in church
[1:09:28] this one guy shouting around happy
[1:09:30] praising God
[1:09:32] and this other person's getting mad in
[1:09:33] church
[1:09:35] still happens don't it folks get mad in
[1:09:37] church
[1:09:39] but I became unto his offering he had
[1:09:42] not respect and Cain was very Ross now
[1:09:47] notice the order again that God didn't
[1:09:49] accept the person so it doesn't accept
[1:09:51] the sacrifice
[1:09:53] do you want to do all these good works
[1:09:56] in vain
[1:09:57] do you realize many people is going to
[1:09:59] stand before the Lord that day and he
[1:10:01] will look at them and say depart from me
[1:10:03] you worker of iniquity I never knew you
[1:10:05] yet they will say I cast out devils in
[1:10:08] your name
[1:10:09] I built churches I I preached I sang I I
[1:10:13] was on the field for years and years
[1:10:15] I've done this and they say that's not
[1:10:17] what I accept
[1:10:18] I don't even know you
[1:10:22] Lord God help us
[1:10:27] notice this word Ross it means to be to
[1:10:30] be hot
[1:10:31] Furious
[1:10:33] burn
[1:10:34] to become kindled fixed
[1:10:39] vexation
[1:10:41] Furious
[1:10:42] so this is what Cain got from going to
[1:10:45] church on Sunday morning
[1:10:50] so he went in office oh man he was in
[1:10:52] the best mood that ever was and he goes
[1:10:53] in there and this is what he turns into
[1:10:55] Furious burn become angry become Kindle
[1:10:59] go out the back door and slam the door
[1:11:01] I'll never go back there again
[1:11:04] church and yet here we are rejoicing and
[1:11:07] worshiping God for the truth
[1:11:09] it still happens does it not
[1:11:12] so Cain now being so upset
[1:11:17] and his countenance false
[1:11:20] not Moses of course was in in a secret
[1:11:24] place with God we'll say in the cleft of
[1:11:26] The Rock when God reveals this to him
[1:11:30] and Moses must have like other prophets
[1:11:32] saw it by Vision people want to know why
[1:11:35] we believe the Bible is so infallible
[1:11:37] and how could these men that were not
[1:11:38] even there record these events as if
[1:11:41] though they were there well because to
[1:11:43] us the way we believe it they were there
[1:11:46] they were transported back in time I
[1:11:50] believe Moses myself walked right there
[1:11:52] in the Garden of Eden it's also believed
[1:11:55] the prophet of this age also by Vision
[1:11:57] was able to go back in the Garden of
[1:11:59] Eden as he preaches about it and said
[1:12:01] that he was beside myself last night and
[1:12:04] I come to myself and beside myself and I
[1:12:07] saw Adam and Eve remember him talking
[1:12:09] about that he also said the same thing
[1:12:11] about seeing the five comings of Elijah
[1:12:13] this is why it was so real to them by
[1:12:16] Vision they were actually carried back
[1:12:19] in time to see it
[1:12:22] and he sees two people in church wasn't
[1:12:25] a very big church at all but they had a
[1:12:27] big split over it
[1:12:29] so one of them gets mad one of them says
[1:12:31] glad one of them gets angry and one of
[1:12:33] them gets under a murdering Spirit and
[1:12:35] the other one gets killed by one church
[1:12:37] service
[1:12:39] notice the prophet said Cain wanted to
[1:12:41] be religious and he went made his own
[1:12:43] religion and when he did he brought it
[1:12:45] before God something like this here's
[1:12:47] the best of God this is all I can do
[1:12:49] about it now take it or leave it or if
[1:12:51] that ain't the attitude of the Leo to
[1:12:53] see you today God I ain't coming your
[1:12:55] way don't you tell me how to dress don't
[1:12:57] you tell me what to do don't you tell me
[1:12:59] this or that I won't come no more and
[1:13:01] we'll do this or that or the other why
[1:13:03] people want their own man-made religion
[1:13:07] oh God have mercy on us
[1:13:11] Lord have mercy take it early oh yeah he
[1:13:14] wants his own way that's the way he came
[1:13:16] did I heard the brother say it the other
[1:13:18] day and I shared it with several
[1:13:19] different Minister friends of mine that
[1:13:21] the prophet said man does not want to be
[1:13:24] told what to do he wants to be his own
[1:13:29] boss
[1:13:31] anybody here like that besides me
[1:13:34] rest all you Liars get up and pray
[1:13:36] through
[1:13:39] man wants to be his own boss well I
[1:13:43] think and I believe and that's what I
[1:13:45] want to do yeah you see that's your boss
[1:13:47] talking
[1:13:48] that's right
[1:13:49] notice this he believes his own ideas
[1:13:53] will get him in that's what he's saying
[1:13:56] says his own way so this is the nature
[1:13:59] of the Earthly man to come up with an
[1:14:02] Earthly religion so notice where his
[1:14:04] religion came from the Earth
[1:14:08] he was a tiller of the soil
[1:14:11] you see this is what many of us do so
[1:14:14] much of we till our soil we baby our
[1:14:18] soil we fertilize it we feed it we give
[1:14:22] it what's it what it wants oh my
[1:14:25] goodness if it don't like hard preaching
[1:14:27] we just change churches don't we if it
[1:14:29] don't like this and that we just do
[1:14:31] whatever wants so we nurture it and we
[1:14:33] love it
[1:14:34] oh don't you love yourself aren't you
[1:14:37] just absolutely no sister look at me
[1:14:39] like I'm aware don't sure you do you
[1:14:42] love yourself you have this built in you
[1:14:44] called self-preservation an element of
[1:14:47] that God gave you that but Satan anoints
[1:14:50] it to where we make idolatry out of it
[1:14:53] and then we will bring our Sacrifice
[1:14:55] from the toil of the soil
[1:15:02] here I am God what do you think
[1:15:06] am I just awesome or what
[1:15:09] am I about the greatest son you ever
[1:15:11] made on Earth
[1:15:12] I know you're setting our life in it
[1:15:14] maybe but if we could hear the way we
[1:15:15] talk and think about ourselves sometimes
[1:15:17] it might scare you
[1:15:22] Cain was more religious
[1:15:25] than Abel was he done more for the Lord
[1:15:29] he says
[1:15:31] than Abel did WOW done more for the Lord
[1:15:36] done more for the Lord
[1:15:39] than Abel did
[1:15:42] and the Lord said unto King Genesis 4 6.

[1:17:48] going to do it well you've got to write
[1:17:49] to the pillar of fire just I Abel did
[1:17:52] so the spirit of God coming inside of
[1:17:54] you can have a few more minutes
[1:17:57] turn with me to the book of First Kings
[1:17:59] chapter 18 verse 21. and Elijah came
[1:18:03] unto all the people and said
[1:18:05] how long hold she between two opinions
[1:18:08] if the Lord be God follow him
[1:18:12] if Baal then follow him
[1:18:15] and the people answered him not a word
[1:18:18] oh don't you love it when the word shuts
[1:18:20] the mouth of the devil then sat Elijah
[1:18:23] unto the people I even I only remain a
[1:18:27] prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets
[1:18:29] are 450 men
[1:18:32] and the odd still ain't good
[1:18:34] for baal's Prophets
[1:18:37] one against 450 the odds still ain't
[1:18:39] good let them therefore give us two
[1:18:42] Bullocks and let them choose one Bullock
[1:18:44] for themselves I cut it in pieces and
[1:18:46] lay it on the wood and put no fire under
[1:18:49] and I will dress the other block and lay
[1:18:52] it on wood and put no fire under
[1:18:55] and call ye on the name of your gods
[1:18:59] and I will call on the name of the Lord
[1:19:03] and the god that answers by fire
[1:19:06] not by books not by ashes not by
[1:19:10] intellectual conception but the god that
[1:19:13] answers my fire
[1:19:16] let him be God
[1:19:18] praise the Lord
[1:19:21] and all the people answered and said it
[1:19:25] is well spoken they will regret that
[1:19:28] agreement
[1:19:29] it is well spoken and Elijah said of the
[1:19:33] prophets of Baal Choose You One by Lord
[1:19:35] for yourselves and dress it first for ye
[1:19:38] are many now you be little guys you know
[1:19:41] bless your little hearts you need all
[1:19:42] the all the help you can get so y'all go
[1:19:44] ahead and start first and call on the
[1:19:46] name of your Gods but put no fire under
[1:19:50] and they took the block which was given
[1:19:53] them and they dressed it and called on
[1:19:55] the name of Baal from morning even until
[1:19:59] noon now here they start early in the
[1:20:01] morning their morning began that sits
[1:20:03] o'clock so they start in the morning
[1:20:05] third hour the day was nine o'clock
[1:20:07] they're still calling now noon time
[1:20:10] comes six hour of the day they'll still
[1:20:11] calling
[1:20:13] foreign
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:23] man I imagine they had some singers I
[1:20:25] imagine they had some choir directors I
[1:20:28] imagine they brought out the minstrels
[1:20:30] and the tambourines and they was a
[1:20:32] harping and they was a jumping around
[1:20:33] and there was a dancing oh does anybody
[1:20:36] feed it oh yes brother I feel it I want
[1:20:39] Bales fixing to come well five after
[1:20:42] nine
[1:20:44] it still hadn't showed up
[1:20:46] 10 out of 10 he hadn't showed up we'll
[1:20:48] have him after 11 he hadn't showed up 12
[1:20:50] out to 12. he hadn't showed up
[1:20:53] guess what
[1:20:55] they showed up
[1:20:57] cause there is no real God named Veil it
[1:21:02] is a figment of man's imagination
[1:21:05] idolatry
[1:21:07] in the form of demons
[1:21:10] oh yeah
[1:21:12] mama
[1:21:15] now watch O Brother Elijah
[1:21:19] now Oh They'll hear us but there was no
[1:21:22] voice
[1:21:23] nor any of that answered
[1:21:26] and they leaped upon the altar which is
[1:21:30] made clear to God they're getting
[1:21:32] Pentecostal bailouts
[1:21:35] so now they move and they jump up on the
[1:21:37] altar glory to God hallelujah I feel it
[1:21:40] I feel
[1:21:41] you know I'm not making fun of the real
[1:21:42] spirit of God but look how emotional
[1:21:45] they got the friend we want more that
[1:21:47] emotion does emotion come with it yes
[1:21:49] and if your religion ain't got no
[1:21:52] emotion you better bury it
[1:22:00] now watch the spirit of Elijah
[1:22:02] you see it tends to go with the Elijah
[1:22:06] spirit
[1:22:07] that people who are under it tend to
[1:22:10] ridicule and make fun
[1:22:11] of dead religion
[1:22:17] and he came to pass at noon not Elijah
[1:22:21] mocked them
[1:22:24] and said
[1:22:25] cry aloud
[1:22:27] for he is a god
[1:22:30] either he is talking
[1:22:33] or pursuing
[1:22:36] or he's in a journey
[1:22:39] or maybe he's asleep
[1:22:44] oh my goodness and you can imagine
[1:22:46] you've got 450 false prophets there and
[1:22:49] you got one little bitty old skinny
[1:22:50] armed guy standing there by himself
[1:22:52] little bitty oh God that the world
[1:22:54] absolutely hated despise him and yet he
[1:22:57] gets so bold and he stands up there and
[1:23:00] ridicules notice what he's doing look at
[1:23:02] all these things that he's doing he is
[1:23:04] absolutely identifying this Theory as
[1:23:08] something that is false now of course he
[1:23:10] could not say this about his God cry
[1:23:12] alive for he is a God either he is
[1:23:14] talking which means he cannot hear and
[1:23:17] talk at the same time even I can do that
[1:23:21] and I'm certainly not a God so they're
[1:23:23] supposed to be a purity Beauty God look
[1:23:26] what he's doing to that God he is
[1:23:29] stripping him down to size
[1:23:36] either he's talking
[1:23:39] or he's pursuing as a god he's out there
[1:23:42] after somebody I'll be right back to my
[1:23:44] godship in a few minutes I'm after
[1:23:46] somebody every whole whole tide over
[1:23:47] there I'll be back in a few minutes
[1:23:50] because he can't do two things at once
[1:23:52] I'll tell you how big my God is if he's
[1:23:55] got millions of Christians all over the
[1:23:57] world that live from different time
[1:23:59] zones and the all different different
[1:24:00] zip codes and every one of them's got to
[1:24:02] have prayers answered uh you won't get
[1:24:04] my prayer you won't get yours or you
[1:24:06] won't get yours or theirs every one of
[1:24:08] us will get the right answer at the
[1:24:10] right address at the right time because
[1:24:12] our God can multitask he is the original
[1:24:16] multitasker Hallelujah he can talk he
[1:24:19] can listen he can do all this at one
[1:24:21] time because he is Elohim
[1:24:29] now that Elijah goes real low
[1:24:32] and he says
[1:24:36] he just went to sleep up here in heaven
[1:24:38] on you guys
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:47] snoring so loud y'all may have to get
[1:24:49] really loud to yourself hey
[1:24:55] prayer Adventure he sleepeths and must
[1:24:57] be awake
[1:25:00] and after they cried aloud
[1:25:05] I want you to listen what people do
[1:25:07] under demonic Force
[1:25:10] they go to
[1:25:12] cutting themselves
[1:25:15] God never ask his children
[1:25:18] to cut themselves for him
[1:25:22] God don't specialize in cutting he
[1:25:23] specializes in healing cuts
[1:25:28] so now they're getting so wrapped up so
[1:25:31] they're jumping they're screaming and
[1:25:32] lodging and making them Madam all you
[1:25:34] imagine they're so mad they're Furious
[1:25:36] they're sweating and they're slobbing
[1:25:38] and they're spitting it must have been
[1:25:40] one mess and your Elijah said well call
[1:25:43] him a little louder
[1:25:45] I call under God go ahead and call it
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:53] I can't go ahead curse me by your gods
[1:25:56] that don't exist
[1:26:01] cut themselves out to their manner with
[1:26:04] knives
[1:26:05] and lancets kill the blood gosh
[1:26:10] out of
[1:26:15] and it came to pass from midday was
[1:26:17] passed they prophesied oh Lord
[1:26:23] so now they jump they screamed they've
[1:26:24] hollowed they've cut themselves with
[1:26:26] knives and lenses and now they start
[1:26:28] prophesying
[1:26:31] they prophesied until the time of the
[1:26:33] offering of the evening sacrifice you
[1:26:35] imagine Paul Elijah he probably went
[1:26:37] over and took a break about two o'clock
[1:26:38] having an evening siesta
[1:26:41] he's probably just absolutely wore out
[1:26:43] with all this nonsense I know exactly
[1:26:45] how I feel sometimes sometimes you just
[1:26:47] get wore out with a nonsense of people
[1:26:49] you just wish people would get really
[1:26:51] sincere with God and to see what God
[1:26:54] will do let's quit playing Church let's
[1:26:55] hide Church we've got a great place to
[1:26:58] have church what do you say we just
[1:26:59] aren't having churches we've got a great
[1:27:02] building that the spirit of God can move
[1:27:04] a moment we've got a lot of needs we've
[1:27:06] got a lot of sick boats let's just start
[1:27:08] having Church let's just let the Lord
[1:27:10] God move amongst
[1:27:18] foreign
[1:27:21] came to pass on the midday was passed
[1:27:24] they prophesied to the time of the
[1:27:25] offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:27:27] there was neither voice
[1:27:30] nor any to answer
[1:27:33] nor any
[1:27:34] that regarded
[1:27:37] Elijah said unto all the people come
[1:27:40] near unto me and all the people came
[1:27:41] near unto him and he repaired the altar
[1:27:44] of the Lord
[1:27:46] Elijah Ministry is a restoration back to
[1:27:48] the original he didn't Glenn are
[1:27:50] entirely all trip and say we don't need
[1:27:51] the altar no more it was a restoration
[1:27:53] back to the altar
[1:27:55] that was broken down who broke it down
[1:27:58] bunch of these false prophets
[1:28:00] and Elijah took 12 Stones according to
[1:28:03] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:28:04] Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:28:06] came saying Israel shall be thy name
[1:28:09] and with the stones he built an altar in
[1:28:12] the name of the Lord he made a trench
[1:28:15] about the altar as great would contain
[1:28:18] two measures of seed and put the word in
[1:28:22] order you see God ain't scared of order
[1:28:24] as long as this divine order
[1:28:27] divine order allows you to still worship
[1:28:29] God divine order still allows you to
[1:28:32] praise the Lord come on don't get scared
[1:28:34] to order what we don't want is man-made
[1:28:37] order I love divine order
[1:28:40] oh man
[1:28:42] cut the Bullock in pieces and lay him on
[1:28:44] the wood and says fill for Byram no what
[1:28:49] you're putting water on the sacrifice
[1:28:52] and water on the wood
[1:28:56] feel for balance with water and pour it
[1:28:58] on the burnt sacrifice on the wood and
[1:29:01] he said do it the second time and they
[1:29:03] did it the second time and he said do it
[1:29:05] the third poll
[1:29:09] y Hallelujah
[1:29:13] and they did it the third time and the
[1:29:16] water ran the water ran round about the
[1:29:21] Altar and filled the trench also with
[1:29:25] water
[1:29:27] it looked like to a a man in his human
[1:29:30] mind would think what are you doing you
[1:29:34] want the driest kindling you want the
[1:29:36] driest wood and if God don't do it you
[1:29:39] can be able to sneak over there rub it
[1:29:41] hard enough maybe a light on its own man
[1:29:43] you're making it totally impossible for
[1:29:45] this move to be anything other than God
[1:29:47] Ah that's exactly what we want you see
[1:29:50] we're not interested in a Reagan move
[1:29:52] we're not interested in a Ron Spencer
[1:29:55] mover a Tim Pruitt move or any other
[1:29:57] man-made move we want a move of God
[1:30:00] Almighty we don't want to move over just
[1:30:03] stirred by this preacher and that
[1:30:05] creature and that preacher goes home and
[1:30:07] you lose your Revival I want a Revival
[1:30:10] when I'm a thousand miles from brother
[1:30:12] Ron Spencer I'm 2 000 miles from another
[1:30:14] 10 foot I can still be in Revival
[1:30:17] because the Revival is down inside of my
[1:30:21] able I don't have to get around a
[1:30:23] preacher to have Revival I want to stay
[1:30:26] in Revival ball I want to stay on fire
[1:30:37] can you imagine this oh well
[1:30:39] we might as well shut the doors now down
[1:30:41] we're running
[1:30:43] this is going to be a huge embarrassment
[1:30:48] and it came to tight to pass at the time
[1:30:51] of the offering
[1:30:53] of the evening
[1:30:55] sacrifice
[1:30:58] so here it was at the evening time
[1:31:02] that Elijah the prophet came near and
[1:31:04] said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and
[1:31:08] Israel
[1:31:09] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:31:11] God and Israel
[1:31:13] and that I am thy servant and that I
[1:31:16] have done all these things
[1:31:18] at Thy Word
[1:31:21] Hear Me O Lord hear me
[1:31:23] that this people may know that thou art
[1:31:26] the Lord God
[1:31:28] the thou has turned
[1:31:31] oh no
[1:31:34] turned their heart back again
[1:31:38] ain't that what Malachi 4 said
[1:31:41] in the last days said Cindy Elijah and
[1:31:44] he would turn the hearts back brother
[1:31:46] Jerry and here is Elijah the Old
[1:31:48] Testament identifying with the same
[1:31:50] thing Lord turn their hearts back to
[1:31:53] what the original Apostolic teaching of
[1:31:57] the Bible
[1:31:58] so here is Elijah Oh Glory that thou has
[1:32:03] turned their heart back again then
[1:32:06] oh wow so he didn't have to go to nine
[1:32:09] o'clock at night 12 o'clock and then one
[1:32:11] o'clock and then three o'clock the next
[1:32:12] day and five o'clock the next day but as
[1:32:14] soon as the man of God spoke about
[1:32:16] restoration face
[1:32:19] then the fire of the Lord fell
[1:32:23] and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:32:28] wood
[1:32:29] and the stones
[1:32:31] I am the Dust
[1:32:33] and lift up the water
[1:32:36] that was in the trench
[1:32:39] that's my God
[1:32:41] I said that's
[1:32:43] my God
[1:32:50] against all the odds oh but you see the
[1:32:54] move wasn't over yet I'm all close and
[1:32:56] when all the people saw it they fell on
[1:32:58] their faces and they said the Lord he is
[1:33:01] the god the Lord he is the god and
[1:33:05] Elijah said unto them take the prophets
[1:33:08] of Baal give them a big social security
[1:33:10] check and sign them up on Medicare and
[1:33:13] Welfare
[1:33:17] let not a one of them escape and they
[1:33:19] took them and Elijah brought him down to
[1:33:21] the brook his Sean
[1:33:23] good Lord what a thing for a man to do
[1:33:25] and slew them there
[1:33:30] and accepted worshiper
[1:33:33] let me just read another scripture in
[1:33:35] the New Testament Matthew 15 22 and
[1:33:38] behold the woman of Canaan came out of
[1:33:40] the same coast and Cried unto him saying
[1:33:44] have mercy on me O Lord
[1:33:46] thou son of David
[1:33:49] my daughters grievously Vex with the
[1:33:51] Devil
[1:33:52] but he answered her not a word
[1:33:54] and his disciples came and besought him
[1:33:57] saying send her away
[1:34:03] so what if one of the deacons had met
[1:34:04] you at the door this morning said look
[1:34:06] sir you're not welcome here today
[1:34:09] or told one of you ladies you're not
[1:34:11] welcome here we don't know you we ain't
[1:34:13] never seen you before you're not welcome
[1:34:14] oh I can imagine you'd have stomped out
[1:34:17] of here you'd have had it on Facebook
[1:34:18] before you ever pulled out of the
[1:34:20] parking lot you would have called the
[1:34:21] Johnson City Press Elizabeth and Starry
[1:34:23] said that church up there I'll tell you
[1:34:25] one thing I went up there and I
[1:34:30] the disciples
[1:34:33] telling Jesus would you get rid of this
[1:34:35] woman
[1:34:38] she cries after a she is nothing but a
[1:34:42] pest
[1:34:44] she's aggravating us to death
[1:34:49] but he answered and said I am not sent
[1:34:52] but unto the lost sheep of the House of
[1:34:55] Israel
[1:34:57] and you're a gentile dog
[1:35:01] but she would not take no
[1:35:05] not even from Jesus
[1:35:09] the prophet says about the this woman
[1:35:11] she had so much faith
[1:35:13] even Jesus himself couldn't run her off
[1:35:16] Lord God let me be that kind of man
[1:35:19] but maybe that kind of person no two
[1:35:21] young people want to be that kind of
[1:35:22] young people
[1:35:27] but notice this verse
[1:35:29] then
[1:35:30] came she
[1:35:33] and worshiped him amen
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:41] he turned her down his disciples said
[1:35:43] you know already treated her bad that
[1:35:46] didn't change her
[1:35:48] she said I'm going to be accepted I'm
[1:35:50] getting what I need
[1:35:52] and somehow it dropped in her heart
[1:35:54] key is worship your way through this
[1:36:00] worship your way through this resentment
[1:36:03] worship your way through this rejection
[1:36:06] shouldn't have a scripture there named
[1:36:08] nothing but somehow it just dropped
[1:36:10] there I want to praise him I'm going to
[1:36:12] praise him what I feel like it I'm going
[1:36:14] to praise him when I don't I'm going to
[1:36:16] crack my hands on the hands as hard I'm
[1:36:18] going to let my voice when I'm hoarse
[1:36:20] I'm going to worship him let it be said
[1:36:23] about us then Donny came and worshiped
[1:36:27] him then Brenda came then Carol came
[1:36:29] then Carrie came then you came and
[1:36:33] worshiped him and so moves his heart
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:40] then came she
[1:36:44] and worshiped him saying Lord
[1:36:48] help me
[1:36:50] but he answered and said it is not me to
[1:36:52] take the children's bread
[1:36:55] cast it to you
[1:36:57] you're a dog
[1:37:01] and she said amen
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:07] I'm a dog
[1:37:09] there's two Greek words that are used
[1:37:10] for the word dog
[1:37:12] whenever Jesus said dog he used the one
[1:37:15] word which means a big dog
[1:37:18] but when she answered him she used the
[1:37:20] other Greek word used for dog which
[1:37:22] means
[1:37:23] little dog
[1:37:28] Jesus is so humbled her
[1:37:31] but she went down beneath the humidity
[1:37:34] that he placed upon him
[1:37:38] and she said that's right
[1:37:40] I know I'm a dog
[1:37:43] I have no right I had no claim
[1:37:45] but my little girl
[1:37:47] needs your touch today Lord God
[1:37:53] I say to you
[1:37:55] my little girl
[1:37:57] back there in that office
[1:38:00] needs the touch of the same master
[1:38:07] maybe some of you here today
[1:38:09] near the touch of that same Master you
[1:38:12] know so I'm not where are they of course
[1:38:14] you're not I'm not either
[1:38:17] but let's worship Him
[1:38:19] let's worship Him
[1:38:21] let's get a hold to this heart
[1:38:25] and you won't be able to tell us no
[1:38:28] You're My Healer yeah Hallelujah
[1:38:31] you're my provider
[1:38:33] you're my savior you're my king
[1:38:36] you're my everything
[1:38:38] I don't feel like praising you I don't
[1:38:40] feel like worshiping you but I'm going
[1:38:42] to do it anyhow I mean that's what I'm
[1:38:43] saying
[1:38:45] truth Lord
[1:38:47] yet the dogs he did the crumbs which
[1:38:50] fall from their master's table
[1:38:52] then Jesus answered and said unto her o
[1:38:56] woman
[1:38:57] great
[1:38:59] is thy face
[1:39:01] be it unto thee even as thou
[1:39:06] wilt
[1:39:09] Lord have mercy children
[1:39:12] this is one of the few times when Jesus
[1:39:15] in the New Testament places the outcome
[1:39:17] of the scenario
[1:39:19] in the hands of the believer
[1:39:34] oh woman greatest thy faith be it unto
[1:39:36] thee even as thou wilt
[1:39:41] but they don't reckon how she willed it
[1:39:43] the last words of the verse tell us
[1:39:49] and her daughter
[1:39:53] was made whole
[1:40:01] from that very hour
[1:40:04] why
[1:40:06] she
[1:40:07] willed it
[1:40:09] so
[1:40:17] now she would have willed that it waited
[1:40:19] till tomorrow until next week until next
[1:40:21] year
[1:40:22] that's exactly the way it would have
[1:40:24] happened
[1:40:25] brother Jim within her being
[1:40:27] dog a gentile social humiliated so
[1:40:30] embarrassed don't you see what real
[1:40:31] Faith does it goes over the top of
[1:40:33] humiliation and says I've got a need
[1:40:37] I'm desperate
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:59] accepted worshipers how many of them I
[1:41:02] got here today
[1:41:03] what do you feel like you've met God's
[1:41:05] requirement
[1:41:06] God has testified back to you you
[1:41:08] believe God will hear your prayer
[1:41:11] what do you have neither
[1:41:13] you need to move in your home
[1:41:16] moving your marriage moving your
[1:41:17] finances
[1:41:19] what do you believe what can you believe
[1:41:21] for
[1:41:22] he's only limited to what our faith
[1:41:26] if we limit him well he saved me he's
[1:41:28] saying that's all I want all my you've
[1:41:31] got a whole arcade the prophet said of
[1:41:34] all the good things of God what do you
[1:41:35] need remember
[1:41:37] I'm past 60 and I'm getting old and and
[1:41:40] all these those things supposed to just
[1:41:41] be on old people once you get Social
[1:41:43] Security and all that stuff my Bible
[1:41:45] tells me I worship of all things that I
[1:41:46] must prosper from being held even as I
[1:41:48] so prosperous I don't even believe in
[1:41:50] Divine Healing I believe in Divine
[1:41:51] health
[1:41:54] show me somewhere in the scripture where
[1:41:55] the scripture says I have to have
[1:41:56] rheumatoid arthritis
[1:41:58] show me somewhere in the scripture so
[1:41:59] whenever it says I get old I have to
[1:42:01] have Alzheimer's show me where it says
[1:42:03] it oh but it runs in my family but
[1:42:05] you've got another family tree
[1:42:08] Hallelujah you've got another family

[1:43:09] Lord Jesus
[1:43:11] we approach it today with our needs and
[1:43:13] our hearts
[1:43:15] our requests are burdens
[1:43:18] these Believers had their hands one laid
[1:43:20] upon the other
[1:43:22] some needing to move in their homes some
[1:43:24] in their marriage some of their children
[1:43:25] wayward
[1:43:26] maybe their finances
[1:43:28] whatever it is Lord God in the name of
[1:43:31] Jesus
[1:43:32] May the spirit of God I pray
[1:43:35] move amongst your people
[1:43:39] help us father that we can believe the
[1:43:41] promise of your word
[1:43:44] that Gentile woman didn't even have a
[1:43:46] scripture
[1:43:47] she did not have one scripture to base
[1:43:49] her faith on
[1:43:51] but somehow she believed she was in your
[1:43:53] presence
[1:43:55] and you couldn't run her off
[1:43:58] one of the very few people in the New
[1:44:00] Testament
[1:44:01] that was attributed this great Saiyan
[1:44:04] you have great face
[1:44:08] we don't even know her name
[1:44:10] we don't know nothing about our family
[1:44:12] tree
[1:44:13] but what we know is
[1:44:15] she had great faith
[1:44:18] Lord God let that be said about us
[1:44:22] when we die we may not leave much
[1:44:25] our Legacy will be very small no doubt
[1:44:27] the world will hardly even know he was
[1:44:29] ever here
[1:44:31] but Lord God may you testify of Our
[1:44:33] Lives
[1:44:34] that we pleased you father
[1:44:36] because these Believers have their hands
[1:44:38] laid one upon the other
[1:44:40] in the name of Jesus May the healing
[1:44:43] virtue of the Lord Jesus Christ go
