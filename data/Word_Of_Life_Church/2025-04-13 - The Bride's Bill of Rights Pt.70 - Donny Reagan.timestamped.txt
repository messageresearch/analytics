[13:27] these things unto our Lord. Want to
[13:29] continue to remember brother Alan
[13:31] Butcher as we pray today that God would
[13:33] just comfort his heart. had his wife's
[13:35] service yesterday and and got some phone
[13:37] calls last night about the quality of

[13:42] brother Donnie conducted that service.
[13:44] And I thank God that God's placed great
[13:47] gifts among us and we get to be part of
[13:50] that. Aren't you glad about that this

[13:56] we? You're
[14:01] Amen. You love the Lord. Amen. Let's go
[14:05] to him. Heavenly
[14:07] Father, we love you so much, Lord
[14:10] Jesus. Our hearts, Lord, are so full
[14:14] with your mercy and your grace, Lord.
[14:16] And it's so good to know, Father, that
[14:19] no matter what we go through,
[14:22] Lord, Lord, we're we're beyond the the
[14:27] the understanding that if we had money,
[14:30] we could fix it. If we had more friends,
[14:32] we could fix it, Lord Jesus. You're all
[14:35] that we need, Lord. And we're so
[14:36] thankful, Father, that you've given us
[14:38] that revelation,
[14:40] Lord. Lord, we're not depending
[14:42] on anything but you, Lord. There were so
[14:46] many requests, Lord. I was sitting back
[14:47] there thinking, there's so many
[14:49] desperate needs,
[14:50] Father. But Lord
[14:52] Jesus, we're not wavering in our belief.
[14:56] We're strong in the faith knowing,
[14:58] Father, that all things are possible
[15:00] with you, Lord. And each one of these
[15:03] requests, Father, we bring before your
[15:05] throne, Lord, like we're singing boldly,
[15:07] Lord, able to come before your throne
[15:10] and just lay them at your feet, knowing,
[15:11] Lord Jesus, that you're mindful. And not
[15:14] only are you mindful, Lord, but you
[15:15] care, Father. We love you. We thank you
[15:18] so much for it, Lord Jesus. And we're
[15:20] we're so looking forward to hearing the
[15:22] testimonies and the and the and the
[15:24] reports back of how you worked, Lord, in
[15:27] a miraculous way, Father.
[15:30] Lord Jesus, we haven't forgotten, Lord,
[15:32] that it's a miracle, Lord, for you even
[15:35] saving us, Lord. So, you're not a God
[15:38] that's beyond miracles, Father. We pray
[15:40] that you just move in each and every
[15:42] one, Lord. And and Lord, not only in in
[15:44] in health condition do we depend on you,
[15:47] Lord, but there's many needs here today,
[15:50] Lord, spiritually, Father, there's many
[15:52] that need you, Lord. There's many that
[15:54] need a deeper walk, a better
[15:56] relationship with you, Lord. Myself
[15:58] included, Father, and you're here to
[16:01] answer those calls, Father. We bring
[16:03] them before you, Lord. We we love you
[16:05] and we thank you, Father. May we give
[16:07] you all the praise and the glory and the
[16:09] honor, Lord. May we be participants,
[16:11] Lord. Not ones that just be hearers of
[16:14] the words, but doers, Lord. And we know
[16:16] that you said to praise you and lift you
[16:18] up, Father. We're going to be doers
[16:19] today, Father. We love you. We thank you
[16:22] for it, Lord. We're just so looking
[16:23] forward to your word. We thank you for
[16:25] it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[16:29] brother John. God bless you. Ushers, if
[16:32] you want to come at this time, receive
[16:34] the morning tithe and offering, you give
[16:35] us unto the Lord. Once again, have any
[16:37] visitors with us? We want to say God
[16:39] bless you. Glad you could be here. All
[16:41] you home folks, you're looking good this
[16:43] morning, too. God bless all of you.

[20:39] Give the Lord a good hand clap this
[20:40] morning. You can be
[20:42] seated. Got a couple of real good songs
[20:45] for you today. By special request,
[20:47] Brother Justin's going to and sing his
[20:50] song. And Brother Caleb, I think's got
[20:52] something he's going to say about his
[20:54] song this morning.
[20:58] And just before we sing, we want to be
[21:00] sure to to dedicate this brother Alan
[21:02] Butcher and not only him, but all of our
[21:05] shutins. You know, they have a special
[21:07] place in my heart. My par my
[21:09] grandparents, they're unable to come.
[21:11] And I think about them a lot. They're
[21:14] pillars not only of this church, but of
[21:16] the bride of Christ. Although they're
[21:19] weak and and frail and not able to get
[21:21] to church, they they still are mighty
[21:25] prayer warriors for this message. And I
[21:28] I'm thankful for them.
[21:30] And we know the best is yet to
[21:33] [Music]
[21:42] come. Sometimes I fall.
[21:48] to my knees and
[21:53] pray. Come Jesus,
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] come. Let today be the
[22:04] day. Sometimes I
[22:10] feel like I'm going to break.
[22:15] [Music]
[22:17] But I'm holding
[22:21] on to a hope that won't
[22:28] fade. Come Jesus,
[22:31] [Laughter]
[22:33] come. We've been waiting so
[22:39] long for the day you
[22:42] return to heal every hurt and ride every
[22:51] road. We need you right
[22:57] now. Come and turn this around.
[23:03] [Music]
[23:04] And deep down I know this world isn't
[23:10] home. Come Jesus,
[23:16] come. Come Jesus, come.
[23:23] There'll be no
[23:27] war and there'll be no change.
[23:34] When Jesus
[23:39] comes, let the day be the
[23:45] day. You'll come for the
[23:49] [Applause]
[23:51] weak, the strong just the
[23:54] [Music]
[23:57] same. and all that
[24:00] [Music]
[24:02] believe in the power of his
[24:09] name. Come Jesus,
[24:14] come. We've been waiting so

[24:50] home. Come Jesus,
[24:53] [Laughter]
[24:55] come. Come Jesus,
[24:58] [Music]
[25:01] come. One day he'll
[25:06] come and we'll stand face to face.
[25:14] Come and lay it all
[25:19] down. Cuz it might be
[25:23] [Music]
[25:25] today. The time is right
[25:31] now. There's no need to
[25:37] wait. For your past will be watched.
[25:44] A rivers of
[25:48] [Music]
[25:49] grace come Jesus
[25:55] come. We've been waiting so
[26:00] long for the day you

[31:05] every
[31:08] healing I leave it in your hands. And
[31:12] all my f
[31:14] you, Lord. I can leave it in your hands.
[31:20] Amen. I can leave it in your
[31:24] hands, Lord. I
[31:27] can leave it in your hands.
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:43] Stand
[31:50] together. Only the Lord knows
[31:54] today what every one of you have on your
[31:57] heart. Amen. what needs you have, what
[32:02] petitions, what
[32:04] questions, what misunderstandings that
[32:06] you
[32:08] have. It would probably overwhelm us as
[32:11] mortals if we would try to share it with
[32:13] each other and try to help people find
[32:16] the answers for the questions of
[32:19] life. But I'm so glad today that when we
[32:22] are overwhelmed by what life can
[32:25] produce, that we can trust him.
[32:28] Aren't you? Amen. I don't always
[32:31] understand. And to be honest with you, I
[32:33] don't ask to understand. What I ask for
[32:36] is the ability to trust what I don't
[32:39] understand. And what he wants me to
[32:42] understand, I believe that he'll give it
[32:43] to me. And if he doesn't, then I know
[32:46] there's a reason for it. And I believe
[32:48] if we approach it that way, then God
[32:52] will always help us. Amen. Let's uh read
[32:55] today if you would from second Peter
[32:58] chapter 1 verse 2. We certainly count it
[33:00] a privilege to be gathered together
[33:03] again here today in the house of the
[33:05] Lord. And um we're going to read the
[33:09] scripture here and then we'll pray.
[33:13] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[33:15] through the
[33:17] knowledge through the knowledge of God
[33:21] and of
[33:22] Jesus our Lord. through the knowledge of
[33:26] God and of Jesus our
[33:28] Lord, according as his divine power hath
[33:32] given unto us all things that pertain
[33:35] unto life and
[33:38] godliness through the
[33:41] knowledge. Wow. Well, Peter sure
[33:43] mentioned this word knowledge, didn't
[33:46] he? He must have felt like that the
[33:48] knowledge of God was a very important
[33:50] thing to our walk with God.
[33:53] through the knowledge of him that has
[33:55] called us unto glory and virtue, whereby
[34:00] are given unto us exceeding great and
[34:02] precious
[34:06] promises, that by these you might be
[34:10] partakers of the
[34:13] divine
[34:14] nature, having escaped the corruption
[34:17] that is in the world through lust, and
[34:20] beside this, giving all
[34:21] diligence add to your faith's virtue.
[34:26] And as we've been looking at the meaning
[34:27] of this word, it's ministered
[34:29] nourishment to supply, furnish,
[34:33] ministered unto or assisted. So assist
[34:37] each of these virtues in your life. You
[34:39] can't produce them, but you can assist
[34:42] them to where they will grow.
[34:45] Add to your faith virtue, and to
[34:48] virtue
[34:50] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[34:54] and to temperance patience, and to
[34:58] patience godliness, and to godliness,
[35:01] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[35:04] kindness,
[35:06] charity. How many like to be remembered
[35:08] today as we pray?
[35:10] Certainly like for you to remember
[35:12] brother Allan Butcher and his
[35:15] family. Carol and I was down yesterday
[35:17] in Murphreey'sboro for the funeral
[35:20] service there and u certainly good to
[35:23] see our brother and his different family
[35:25] members. Also got to see couple of
[35:28] brother Dan and Sister Judy Dyer's
[35:31] daughters and it u brought back
[35:34] memories. I don't mind telling you. I
[35:36] said during the funeral home
[35:38] and Brother Dan's daughter was telling
[35:41] me that Brother Dan had been seeing
[35:44] Sister
[35:45] Judy. She said, "Daddy, what color is
[35:48] her hair?" Brother Dan, he's he's in his
[35:53] mind a little bit, you know, not quite
[35:55] like he was. And of course, the last
[35:57] time he saw her, her hair was silver
[36:00] gray, but he said jet black.
[36:08] She said, "There's no worries." I said,
[36:10] "No,
[36:11] ma'am." I started crying. She said,
[36:13] "Patt me on the shoulder. You okay?" I
[36:15] said,
[36:16] "Yeah." I said,
[36:17] "But every sheep that I lose, it goes
[36:21] across on the other side. It seems to
[36:23] take out a part of my
[36:26] heart. And I'm getting more and more
[36:28] over there than what we have left here.
[36:32] But I'm just so grateful that God's made
[36:35] a way for us to get there, aren't you?
[36:37] So, I know brother Allan would
[36:39] appreciate our prayers that God would
[36:41] just be with them and the family and all
[36:44] of those of you that have a need and a
[36:45] request today. We also want to pray over
[36:48] prayer cloth for Sister Evelyn Wiggins
[36:50] today. She's uh since she had CO, she's
[36:53] had pneumonia several times and several
[36:56] rounds of antibiotics and they can't
[36:59] seem to knock that devil. But we want to
[37:01] remember our sister today that God would
[37:04] just be be mindful of her. Let's pray
[37:07] together if you
[37:11] would. Our gracious father, we love you
[37:14] so much
[37:16] today. I'm so happy Lord to know that
[37:20] death is not the end of it
[37:23] all. how miserable and how sad this life
[37:26] would be if we just lived 50, 60, 70
[37:30] years old. Sister Carol, lived to be 90.
[37:34] But yet, how short of a span of time
[37:38] that that would be if we just lived to
[37:39] be 90 years old and then at the end of
[37:43] it, we die like an animal. Our body goes
[37:47] back to the dust. Our spirit breaks up
[37:50] when we die. And that's all that there
[37:53] is
[37:54] left. We're so grateful that when you
[37:56] were here, you said, "Let not your heart
[37:59] be troubled. You believe in God, believe
[38:03] also in me, for in my father's house are
[38:07] many mansions. If it were not so, I
[38:10] would have told you. I go away to
[38:13] prepare a place for you. And if I go
[38:15] away, I will come again and receive you
[38:17] unto myself, that where I am, there you
[38:21] may be also. Lord Jesus, we're gathered
[38:24] here today, not that we could see one
[38:26] another, though that's
[38:28] good. We're gathered here, Father, not
[38:31] just to visit with one another, and
[38:33] that's nice, too. Well, we've come that
[38:36] we might receive something from you, our
[38:40] shepherd. something that would help us,
[38:42] Lord, in our journey that we could be
[38:46] ready whether death would come to us by
[38:51] a disease or an automobile accident or a
[38:55] heart attack or whatever more. We want
[38:57] to be ready to face man's greatest fear,
[39:01] death.
[39:03] we can be able to look it in the face
[39:06] and say, "You are not my master, but I
[39:10] am yours." And all it can do is take us
[39:13] across on the other
[39:15] side. Father, we pray for brother Allan
[39:18] and his family that you'd help them,
[39:20] Lord, and strengthen them during this
[39:22] time, Father. Dear God, we pray for our
[39:25] sister Evelyn Wig Wiggins with this
[39:28] prayer cloth. Lord, you see that after
[39:30] this CO struck her body and this after
[39:34] COVID thing has been there for
[39:36] persistent, but Lord, we believe faith
[39:38] is stronger than pneumonia and COVID.
[39:42] So, would you move forward? Lord, the
[39:44] hands of the people raised today is
[39:47] signifying needs and we're asking that
[39:50] you'd help them. No doubt I'm the most
[39:52] needy one that there is here today. For
[39:56] it's come my lot again to stand before
[39:58] your people, to try to speak words to
[40:02] them that'll help them, encourage them,
[40:04] give them guidance. Help me, Jesus. Shut
[40:08] my mouths to anything that would
[40:09] displease you. May I be anointed with
[40:12] your presence, Father, to bring
[40:15] something that will help them today. We
[40:17] pray in Jesus name. And the saints said,
[40:21] "Amen." Amen. God bless you. You may be
[40:24] seated.
[40:35] I've stood in
[40:37] different
[40:39] churches,
[40:41] synagogues,
[40:43] temples, been in Hindu
[40:48] temples, churches that were built in the
[40:51] second, third, and fourth century.
[40:54] in
[40:56] Jerusalem,
[40:58] Europe, different parts of the world
[41:01] that people have built and dedicated a
[41:05] building to their
[41:07] God. Whether it was idol
[41:10] worshippers or
[41:12] Christians, I've stood in different
[41:15] places that were hallowed. Few years
[41:18] ago, Carolyn and I were able to go to
[41:20] the
[41:21] Vatican and stand there and look at the
[41:24] different things that were built.
[41:26] breathtaking as far as
[41:29] architecture. See the paintings in the
[41:32] cyine
[41:33] chapel did by Michelangelo himself
[41:37] laying on his back and a
[41:39] scaffold and laying there for months and
[41:43] painting the great hand of God. There
[41:48] the image of
[41:49] Adam go from one place to another,
[41:52] temples, places of worship.
[41:56] I've stood in little small buildings.
[41:59] The church I started down in Kentucky in
[42:03] 1982, it was an old post office which my
[42:08] aunt used to be the postmaster there.
[42:12] And it was about the size
[42:14] of oh half of this section right here
[42:19] maybe. Oh, it was pretty rustic and
[42:22] pretty rough.
[42:24] But yet we gathered there. I was a
[42:26] Pentecostal preacher and started this
[42:28] Pentecostal church. Little did I know
[42:32] that in less than a year, the Lord would
[42:36] have moved me into a not just a new
[42:39] place, but into a new sphere of his word
[42:44] and a new place of understanding.
[42:48] I sat several years ago on the platform
[42:50] which was a piece of
[42:52] plywood which was raised up in a city in
[42:56] Africa and there was somehow a
[43:00] mischuling that we were supposed to have
[43:03] a school place but they had crossed
[43:07] their wires somehow and uh they had
[43:10] another church group there which had
[43:11] about 30 people maybe something like
[43:14] that so they would not forfeit this
[43:17] massive room which they didn't need for
[43:20] 800 to a,000 people believing the word.
[43:24] So we gathered on the outside and they
[43:27] made a makeshift platform, set a few
[43:30] blocks up where I would be above the
[43:32] people a little bit the people could see
[43:34] me. And under this great tree there in
[43:39] Kenya, we had
[43:42] church. All the different places where
[43:44] I've been around the world in tents as I
[43:47] was in Nairobi, Kenya several years ago
[43:50] and uh 5,000 people the estimated
[43:54] gathering there in those meetings. And
[43:58] what I've took notice is that no matter
[44:00] where God's people are gathered
[44:03] together, he shows up.
[44:06] It don't have to be nice carpet on the
[44:08] floor and really nice chairs for you to
[44:11] sit in and a beautiful building, a nice
[44:14] structure, really nice music, a nice
[44:17] sound system where everybody can be able
[44:19] to hear heating or air conditioning,
[44:21] whichever we need. But he said,
[44:24] "Wherether there are two or three
[44:26] gathered together in my name, there will
[44:29] I be in their midst."
[44:32] And I always marvel at that seeing that
[44:35] no matter where we are, as I stood
[44:38] several years ago in India and several
[44:41] thousand people gathered there in in the
[44:44] building where we were, I had an
[44:46] interpreter to my left, one to my right,
[44:50] and about 15 to 20 out in the
[44:53] congregation, four to 5,000 people
[44:56] there. And I would say something, if you
[44:59] can imagine me preaching with two
[45:00] interpreters. So I would say something,
[45:02] the guy on the left would say it in his
[45:04] language, the guy on the right would say
[45:06] it in his language, and then I would try
[45:08] to remember where I stopped the last
[45:11] time and he would pick it up and all
[45:12] those other people that were out there
[45:14] in their own language. But you know
[45:17] what? I I found there was
[45:20] Jesus. Amen. And then gather in little
[45:23] bitty old places in a little small place
[45:26] called
[45:27] Elderat and gathered there was just a
[45:30] little small group of people gathered
[45:33] here and there around the world. And
[45:36] what I noticed is that no matter if the
[45:39] building is beautiful or
[45:42] pitiful, if it's awesome or humble, that
[45:46] if we are gathered for the right reason
[45:49] and the right purpose, that he shows up
[45:52] to meet the needs of his people.
[45:56] And when I think then that God does not
[45:59] just want it to be great altars overlaid
[46:03] in gold and royal diadems and silver and
[46:07] amethyst and pearls and so on and so on,
[46:11] which the way that a lot of people think
[46:13] that God wants it. But if it can be so
[46:16] humble and so small and yet the presence
[46:20] of God will always show up, then it
[46:24] helps me to be able to relate why that
[46:28] God would want to live in my body
[46:34] and why God would want to live in your
[46:37] body. Now, I've still got a picture of
[46:40] that little post office building where
[46:43] the Lord put it on my heart to start
[46:45] that church down there in Kentucky years
[46:47] and years ago. And then in the spring of
[46:50] 82, 83 rather, we we finished up the
[46:54] church that is there now where brother
[46:56] Luther Dishman is the pastor. And it was
[46:59] so much nicer and you know, really nice
[47:02] air and heating and so on. And yet
[47:05] whenever we moved there, the presence of
[47:08] God was no greater there than it was in
[47:11] that little post
[47:13] office. And as I mentioned it a few
[47:15] weeks ago, March the 27th in
[47:19] 1983 when the Lord introduced to us and
[47:23] had me to stand there and speak about it
[47:26] that God had sent a prophet in the last
[47:29] days with a message. That was March 27,
[47:32] 1983. Then in May of
[47:36] 1983, I I went to to the bank, borrowed
[47:39] some money, went to Jeffersonville,
[47:41] bought books, tapes, pictures, all the
[47:44] things that pertain to the message that
[47:46] I could afford to buy at that time. And
[47:50] within that length of time, from March
[47:52] to May, I didn't go out to preach
[47:54] nowhere else. My Pentecostal friends
[47:56] didn't want me back. I didn't know any
[47:59] message people. So I just stayed at home
[48:02] and buried myself in the word of the
[48:05] hour. So from March to May, Brother
[48:09] Charlie Cox, the first time he come to
[48:11] visit our church, I preached on the
[48:13] coming of the son of
[48:16] man. And we saw that we were probably
[48:20] the last ones that were to come into
[48:24] this message.
[48:25] Now, I'm glad I was born under that
[48:30] urgency because I wonder today if I
[48:33] would have been able to look forward and
[48:35] see myself in Johnson City, Tennessee,
[48:39] and I would have seen myself preaching
[48:41] before this this size of a congregation,
[48:44] which I would have probably thought it
[48:46] was a nightmare.
[48:48] But if I would have seen that and I
[48:50] would have seen somehow the year and the
[48:52] date, I wonder would I have got into it
[48:55] with the urgency that I did when we did
[48:58] back there, Harry, all those years
[49:00] ago. But God knows exactly how to burst
[49:04] each one of us in under the amount of
[49:09] urgency. And when we look at these
[49:12] virtues here, I want to point out to you
[49:15] today by the help of the Lord that every
[49:17] one of us may have a different boundary
[49:22] or perimeter of these virtues. And
[49:26] probably one of the worst things that we
[49:28] can do after believing that they're real
[49:31] and they're for us is to measure our own
[49:35] degree by somebody else. Well, I want
[49:38] the face of this brother or I want the
[49:41] virtue of that one. Now, this is the
[49:44] reason I lay this out about the
[49:45] synagogues and the temples and the
[49:47] churches and so on and so on is to show
[49:50] you that God does not measure us by each
[49:56] other. Now, whenever we gather together,
[49:59] of course, in that day, it'll be a
[50:01] phenomenal day, a great day of worship.
[50:04] But yet when John was carried away into
[50:07] the eighth day and John said, "I saw no
[50:13] temple, I saw no temple." Which was
[50:18] amazing to John because John felt like
[50:22] that heaven would be a place of worship,
[50:25] but it would not be confined to one
[50:28] particular place. Now in the millennium
[50:30] of course Ezekiel 44 through48 shows to
[50:34] us the millennium temple which will be
[50:36] the seventh dispensation of time and
[50:39] it'll be the the sacrificial time in
[50:42] memory only. But when we come to the
[50:44] eighth day there will be no temple there
[50:49] will be no blood. There will be no
[50:51] sacrifices. It will be a perfect time of
[50:55] worship. Now remember, when our souls
[50:58] enter into the eighth day already here
[51:00] in time by the baptism of the Holy
[51:03] Ghost, that's why we don't have to wait
[51:06] to be in church for God to hear our
[51:10] prayers. As a matter of fact, I do a
[51:13] whole lot more praying out of church
[51:15] than I do in church. Don't you? I pray
[51:19] every day of my life, multiple times
[51:21] during the day. Don't you? So I pray
[51:24] more out of church than I do in church.
[51:28] So whenever we come to church actually
[51:31] it's not for prayer and emphasis on
[51:35] prayer alone. Now to the Old Testament
[51:38] people much of what it was was that. But
[51:41] in the to us of what God has done we
[51:44] don't spend all of our time in prayer.
[51:46] Now if we're going to have a prayer
[51:46] meeting of course we would. But church
[51:48] service is more than about prayer. It's
[51:52] about singing. It's about worship. It's
[51:55] about prayer requests. It's about
[51:57] responding to the word. Right? You
[52:00] understand what he's doing? He's getting
[52:02] us ready for that great heavenly time
[52:05] when we're not going to spend hours and
[52:09] hours and hours in prayer.
[52:13] Think of it. You will not be
[52:16] praying in heaven any longer.
[52:20] You will not spend countless of hours
[52:24] alone with God in your mansion in your
[52:28] prayer closet praying. There will be no
[52:32] need for prayer.
[52:35] There will be I'm going to shock you. No
[52:37] need for the blood to stand between you
[52:41] and father god.
[52:44] You understand that part of these things
[52:46] that are our deepest treasures in time
[52:49] are only for time in heaven. We will not
[52:54] need faith.
[52:56] We will not need healing. We will not
[53:00] need miracles. Come on, somebody. We
[53:04] will not need many of the things that we
[53:08] need now because our father has given
[53:11] them to us for this great need that
[53:14] we're in right now. But when we get
[53:16] there, faith will actually become sight.
[53:22] You'll no longer need faith. Oh God, I'm
[53:24] trusting you. I'm trusting you. There
[53:26] won't be no need for trust once you get
[53:29] there. There will be no need for prayer
[53:31] lines. There'll be no need for
[53:33] preachers. There'll be no need for
[53:35] Sunday school. There'll be no need for
[53:38] many of the things that we have now. But
[53:41] God gives them to us now for our benefit
[53:45] and for our help to bring us along until
[53:48] the more perfect day comes. So Isaiah
[53:51] said that before they even call, I will
[53:56] answer. So before you could even ask for
[53:59] it, it'll already be
[54:02] yours. But now until that time arrives,
[54:06] our father has given us so many things
[54:09] that he knew were expedient and
[54:12] necessary for us. So when we look then
[54:14] at the virtues that Peter sold by the
[54:18] spirit of God described to us and then
[54:21] when the prophet picked it up in the
[54:23] stature of a perfect man and we've read
[54:25] it several times and I'll highlight it
[54:27] again for you today if you don't mind.
[54:29] When we put the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:32] in, that brings the faith of Jesus
[54:35] Christ, the virtue of Jesus Christ, the
[54:39] knowledge of Jesus Christ, the
[54:41] temperance of Jesus Christ, the patience
[54:45] of Jesus Christ. Now think that these
[54:48] virtues that God is working on now in
[54:51] our temples. So think of it this way
[54:55] that of of the great places around the
[54:58] world by which saints of God have
[55:00] gathered. They've gathered all over
[55:03] India. They've already done that because
[55:05] they're ahead of us in the time zone.
[55:07] They've already gathered. There's little
[55:09] churches here and there and there
[55:12] Zimbabwe and in Kenya. And many of them,
[55:15] oh my, they would be so humble. Yet the
[55:18] presence of God met them. And the
[55:20] anointed servants of God, they gathered
[55:23] there and they preached and brought to
[55:25] the saints of that area what they needed
[55:29] to hear. And what they needed to hear
[55:32] might be somewhat different than what we
[55:34] need here today in Johnson City. Is that
[55:36] right? Brother Tim Puit no doubt is is
[55:39] there with his saints and they've
[55:41] gathered together an hour behind us in
[55:43] their time and he he's already getting
[55:46] ready and prepared to to bring what God
[55:49] has placed on his heart. All the
[55:51] brothers around the world and yet their
[55:54] needs might be different and so will it
[55:57] be in their measure by which God will
[56:00] bring them in their walk with God. Now,
[56:03] will I need more faith than many of you
[56:07] will in my walk with God? I will. Will I
[56:10] need more virtue? No doubt I will. But
[56:13] if the Lord carries and lets me live
[56:16] long enough and I will get old enough to
[56:19] where I can no longer preach, no longer
[56:21] have prayer lines, and no longer have
[56:24] those sort of things. No doubt the
[56:26] measure of the things that I'm required
[56:29] now. I will no longer need that same
[56:32] measure because God brought me to my
[56:35] heights. And then the need of those
[56:37] things will taper off because I will no
[56:41] longer need them in my walk with God.
[56:44] You understand? So each of you will have
[56:47] that place by which God sets the
[56:49] standard for your life. And you may
[56:52] think, Lord, what what will when will I
[56:54] ever get there? When will I ever achieve
[56:57] that place and accomplish that place?
[57:00] Well, I believe that God knows how to
[57:02] progress each of us. So, is it necessary
[57:05] that all the brothers around the world
[57:07] this morning in the message are
[57:08] preaching all the virtues? No, it isn't.
[57:11] But apparently, it's necessary for us at
[57:14] Word of Life Church. Now, maybe others
[57:17] around the world have gone through a lot
[57:19] of sickness in the church and and God's
[57:21] anointing their brothers there to preach
[57:23] on faith and on healing and on miracles
[57:26] because that's where they are. And then
[57:28] in other churches around the world,
[57:30] they're going through different types of
[57:32] things. Maybe it's an external
[57:33] persecution or it's something that's
[57:35] happening maybe in the community and
[57:37] they're going through a lot of
[57:38] persecution. So God will anoint the
[57:40] servants of God to bring what is
[57:43] absolutely necessary for that body. I'm
[57:46] glad he's so mindful of us. And we know
[57:49] then that he alone has the capability of
[57:52] being able to move a body around the
[57:54] world. It would blow our minds if I can
[57:56] say it that way today to think of
[57:58] Almighty God being able to bring every
[58:01] congregation around the world and there
[58:03] are thousands of them facing all
[58:06] different types of obstacles and things
[58:08] in life and the Lord God able to bring
[58:11] all of them together at the peak time
[58:13] before the rapture and bringing every
[58:16] one of them that are alive and remaining
[58:18] to the spot where they need to be. You
[58:21] know what? it would overwhelm us to
[58:23] think about doing it and all we can do
[58:25] is commit all of that outworking to the
[58:27] presence of God. Aren't you glad? But
[58:30] whenever I look at it, this is what I
[58:32] want to be here this morning for you and
[58:34] I as the people of God that the Lord
[58:37] will help us arrive at our position of
[58:40] where we need to be for us. Now, are we
[58:43] going to be a little bit different?
[58:44] Maybe brother Ron Spencer up the road a
[58:46] few hours, brother Tim Puit up the road
[58:49] or down the road rather, brothers over
[58:51] this way, brother Wilson down the road
[58:53] and different churches that are around.
[58:56] We want to be what God wants us to be to
[58:59] meet in that stature of what God places
[59:03] us to be. Do I want to be like brother
[59:05] Tim? My goodness, no. I mean, that guy's
[59:07] a preacher. I'll never be able to preach
[59:09] like that. I tease him sometimes. to
[59:11] say, "When I grow up, I hope I'm a good
[59:13] preacher like you, but in reality, I
[59:16] don't want to be like him because I want
[59:18] to be what God made me." Can you all say
[59:21] amen? So, it should be the goal of every
[59:24] child of God here today. If I was a
[59:27] preacher that God only ordained me to
[59:29] preach a dozen times a year, I'd rather
[59:33] be in the will of God and preach those
[59:35] dozen times a year than to be out there
[59:38] trying to get in this church. and trying
[59:41] to get in that church and trying to open
[59:44] doors for myself so people would be able
[59:47] to know what a great preacher I am. I'd
[59:49] rather preach 12 times a year and be in
[59:51] the will of God than preach 512 times a
[59:55] year and have a reputation that I'm
[59:57] trying to push and promote myself. And
[1:00:00] the church said, "So it ought to be with
[1:00:02] you the same way." Maybe some of you led
[1:00:05] to here today, you can never say one
[1:00:07] time you've ever laid your hands on
[1:00:09] anybody with cancer and watched God
[1:00:12] perform a miracle. Maybe you can never
[1:00:15] say you've ever laid your hands on
[1:00:17] somebody with cross eyes and watch God
[1:00:20] straighten them out. Maybe you can never
[1:00:22] say that you've laid your hands on
[1:00:24] somebody in the middle of a heart attack
[1:00:27] and watch God stop it. Well, that don't
[1:00:30] mean you're not a Christian. That don't
[1:00:31] mean that your faith is not exactly at
[1:00:34] the level that the Lord God wants it to
[1:00:37] be for you. And you may look at somebody
[1:00:40] like brother Daryl or other brothers
[1:00:41] that have such a great faith and a great
[1:00:44] walk with God and you say, "I'm nothing
[1:00:46] compared to them. You're not even
[1:00:48] supposed to compare yourself to him."
[1:00:51] Now, it's the same when it comes to our
[1:00:53] faith, our virtue, our knowledge, our
[1:00:56] temperance, our patience, our godliness,
[1:00:58] our brotherly kindness. Now I want you
[1:01:00] to notice that when the prophet goes on
[1:01:01] with this he says in page 28 now when
[1:01:04] they begin to say well we don't have to
[1:01:06] accept that today you do have to it must
[1:01:09] be the scriptures cannot lie there are
[1:01:12] no private interpretation the Bible said
[1:01:15] you just believe it the way it's written
[1:01:16] there and you've got to have these
[1:01:18] things and the only way you'll ever be
[1:01:20] able to have them is to have heavenborn
[1:01:24] knowledge. So then heaven-born knowledge
[1:01:27] is not going to school. You'll never get
[1:01:30] it by going to ETSU. You'll never get it
[1:01:33] by going to Harvard. You'll never get it
[1:01:35] going by by Bob Jones. You'll never get
[1:01:38] heavenborn knowledge by going to some
[1:01:40] school. But it exactly as the prophet
[1:01:43] described it,
[1:01:44] heaven. Heaven. I realize there's an
[1:01:48] element of people in our ranks and they
[1:01:50] almost despise knowledge. We should not
[1:01:53] despise godly knowledge. Now the thing
[1:01:56] is that we never wanted to be just human
[1:01:59] knowledge disguised as the twin of
[1:02:03] heavenly born knowledge. Now what's God
[1:02:06] wants to give to us this measure of
[1:02:10] knowledge? Will yours be equivalent to
[1:02:12] that maybe of a minister? Maybe not.
[1:02:15] Will mine ever be equivalent to that of
[1:02:17] the prophet? Never will. And I don't
[1:02:19] want it to be. But I do want it to be up
[1:02:22] to what God wants me to be because I'm
[1:02:26] going to face him as an individual. I've
[1:02:28] shared it with you before that when I go
[1:02:30] on hunting trips with some of the
[1:02:32] brothers here at the church and and
[1:02:33] brother Daryl and I and brother Daniel
[1:02:35] Ball was at a place a few years ago in
[1:02:37] Illinois and brother Daryl come up to
[1:02:39] check on me in the room where I was
[1:02:41] staying. So he come in and there I'm
[1:02:43] sitting. I've got a laptop in my lap.
[1:02:45] I've got an iPad sitting here and I've
[1:02:47] got another iPad sitting down here and
[1:02:49] I'm on vacation. Y'all see me when I
[1:02:51] ain't now. I'm on vacation and I've got
[1:02:54] the laptop. No, you know what I was
[1:02:56] doing? I studying three different things
[1:02:58] at one time and then you all understand
[1:03:01] why I'm confused sometimes. So, I was
[1:03:03] looking at three different things and
[1:03:05] brother Daryl just come in and kind of
[1:03:07] laughed and chuckled. You know, Brother
[1:03:08] Daryl's sense of humor and said,
[1:03:10] "Brother Donnie, if I studied as much as
[1:03:12] you do, it would drive me crazy." But if
[1:03:15] I didn't study as much as I do, it would
[1:03:18] drive me crazy. So you understand,
[1:03:21] Brother Daryl does not feel intimidated
[1:03:23] because he don't study as much as I. Nor
[1:03:27] do I think, well, I'm a nut, then I'm
[1:03:28] crazy. What in the world is the matter
[1:03:30] with me that I have to study so much.
[1:03:32] But I've got to do what God puts upon my
[1:03:36] heart in order to get me out of the way.
[1:03:38] I learned it years and years ago. I want
[1:03:40] to fill my spirit with the word. fill my
[1:03:44] spirit with a message so when I get up
[1:03:47] then the spirit of God's all got all
[1:03:49] this ammo to use.
[1:03:51] Amen. Now, so each one of us, one of the
[1:03:54] worst things that we can do then is
[1:03:56] compare ourselves to each other. Now
[1:03:58] look at this heavenborn knowledge.
[1:04:00] Again, he says, "Now there be another
[1:04:02] thing on this knowledge that we might
[1:04:04] speak of, godly knowledge. Has the Bible
[1:04:08] in the last day lost its meaning?" Now
[1:04:11] what we of course know that that's what
[1:04:12] many people are preaching today. Has the
[1:04:15] Bible lost its meaning? See a lot of
[1:04:17] people tell you that that the Bible
[1:04:19] doesn't exactly mean that. If God
[1:04:22] watches over me, I love this analogy and
[1:04:26] corrects me in my sin. And if I'm a son
[1:04:30] of God, he does that. He does you that
[1:04:32] way. Sons and daughters of God, when you
[1:04:35] do anything wrong, he corrects you. Then
[1:04:37] if God is so particular about you that
[1:04:41] he watches over you and corrects you,
[1:04:44] how much more has he his word? How many
[1:04:48] knows he does that to you? Now if God
[1:04:51] watches over you and will not let you
[1:04:54] get by with something then that can give
[1:04:56] us confidence that God has watched over
[1:04:59] his ruler, his ruler, his image spoken
[1:05:03] word that we would be able to follow his
[1:05:06] word and would be able to say absolutely
[1:05:09] I can put my confidence and my trust in
[1:05:12] that word. God would not give this word
[1:05:14] to me if it was not something that we
[1:05:17] could believe in. And the church said,
[1:05:20] so the continuation of that is still
[1:05:22] ongoing today that God corrects us when
[1:05:26] we are wrong. Now he said, I believe in
[1:05:29] genuine Holy Ghost knowledge. He repeats
[1:05:32] himself. Holy Ghost knowledge will
[1:05:34] always punctuate the word with amen. So
[1:05:40] Holy Ghost knowledge will always
[1:05:42] punctuate the word with an amen. But
[1:05:44] what's amazing is, you know, out
[1:05:47] traveling about and going here and there
[1:05:48] and preaching that you can stand up and
[1:05:50] quote the scripture and you can also
[1:05:53] quote the message and there will be
[1:05:55] people that will sit there and look at
[1:05:57] you and they will not say amen. Not
[1:06:00] because, you know, they're trying to be
[1:06:01] reverent or don't want to miss it, but
[1:06:03] simply because they don't believe what
[1:06:05] you just told them. Now, you say, are we
[1:06:08] in that late of an hour that people will
[1:06:11] not punctuate the word? And God don't
[1:06:14] want us just to punctuate it, of course,
[1:06:15] with a verbal amen, but he wants there
[1:06:18] to be a lived amen out of our
[1:06:21] lives. Now, watch. The Holy Ghostborn
[1:06:25] knowledge will always punctuate the word
[1:06:28] with an amen. So, it will never come
[1:06:30] back and say, "Well, that don't apply in
[1:06:32] our day." That was for another day. That
[1:06:35] was in the 60s when the prophet was
[1:06:37] here. And that was in maybe maybe up to
[1:06:39] the early part of the 70s, but it's no
[1:06:41] longer needed in this day. That's not
[1:06:44] Holy Ghostbornne
[1:06:45] knowledge. Now notice when you get these
[1:06:48] things that seem to contradict
[1:06:50] themselves in the Bible, you sit down
[1:06:52] and study it and prayerfully like that
[1:06:55] and the first thing you know the Holy
[1:06:57] Spirit begins to move in and after a
[1:06:59] while you see it ties together. There
[1:07:02] you got it. That's knowledge.
[1:07:06] And the church said, Amen. How many
[1:07:08] wants that kind of knowledge? I don't
[1:07:11] want the kind of knowledge that it will
[1:07:13] say, "Well, now I I I I don't believe
[1:07:15] that's true. I don't believe that that's
[1:07:18] applicable to our day. I I I believe
[1:07:19] that was for another day." I don't want
[1:07:21] that kind of knowledge. I want the kind
[1:07:23] of knowledge that'll say, "If God said
[1:07:25] it, that settles it." If God said it,
[1:07:29] that settles it. Knowledge not worldly.
[1:07:33] It reasons. any kind of worldly
[1:07:36] knowledge reasons. You see, but faith
[1:07:39] has no reason. God reveals to you a
[1:07:41] certain certain thing going to happen.
[1:07:43] Every scientist in the world could say
[1:07:46] it's contrary. It could not happen. You
[1:07:49] believe it anyhow. All right. Now,
[1:07:51] knowledge, not worldly knowledge. It's
[1:07:54] it's amazing that he keeps emphasizing
[1:07:56] this. Now, remember, he's not preaching
[1:07:58] this to the denomination. He's not
[1:08:01] preaching it to the world churches, but
[1:08:03] he's preaching it to his own tabernacle.
[1:08:06] Wonder why? Wonder why. You ever wonder
[1:08:10] why that there in
[1:08:11] 1965 when he said that there was two
[1:08:14] spirits and he said one of them is
[1:08:17] worshiping by science, education, and
[1:08:20] knowledge. And the other one is
[1:08:22] worshiping by revelation of the word of
[1:08:24] God. 1965, last year of his life. And he
[1:08:28] says both of them are in this tabernacle
[1:08:32] this morning.
[1:08:34] So they had already started
[1:08:37] reathering to the new fountain of God's
[1:08:40] truth. So both
[1:08:43] spirits was now gathering and there were
[1:08:46] men sitting right there in that
[1:08:48] tabernacle that that morning that years
[1:08:51] later would become the man-made leaders
[1:08:55] that would start trying to guide the
[1:08:57] message people. this way and that way
[1:08:59] and that way. Come on, somebody.
[1:09:02] Oh yeah. The spirit of God knew what he
[1:09:04] was talking about. Now watch. He said,
[1:09:07] "But it's heavenly knowledge and
[1:09:09] heavenly knowledge." When God is the
[1:09:11] fountain of all knowledge, God is his
[1:09:13] word. Then if you've got heavenly
[1:09:15] knowledge, you believe the word
[1:09:19] and you reason anything by the word. Now
[1:09:22] that's the kind of knowledge that we
[1:09:25] want to add on top of our foundation of
[1:09:30] faith and virtue. Now godly knowledge
[1:09:33] not only gives us response say when we
[1:09:37] are questioned about why do we believe
[1:09:39] this and this and this which is where a
[1:09:41] lot of us always go well I'm I want to
[1:09:43] know more. I want to know more so I can
[1:09:46] be able to answer because the Bible
[1:09:47] tells me to answer. That's really good.
[1:09:50] But that's not just what we're always
[1:09:52] talking about. But you see, there is a
[1:09:54] knowledge that appertains to the will of
[1:09:57] God for your life, which is probably
[1:10:00] where most of us struggle the most. It's
[1:10:04] not about there's a heaven, there's a
[1:10:06] hell, there's election, there's
[1:10:07] predestination, there's fornowledge. You
[1:10:09] know, we believe in this and this and oh
[1:10:11] yes, I I know all that. I know all that.
[1:10:13] But that's not what I'm talking about
[1:10:15] this morning. You see, when you ask God
[1:10:18] for something and you don't get it and
[1:10:22] God says
[1:10:24] no and your life doesn't turn out in the
[1:10:27] way you thought it would, you see there
[1:10:30] is where we need an element of the
[1:10:33] knowledge of God for our life about the
[1:10:36] will of God for our life. Now listen,
[1:10:39] knowledge and understanding isn't the
[1:10:41] same thing.
[1:10:43] So when God drops a little portion of
[1:10:46] his knowledge for your life, it doesn't
[1:10:50] mean you understand
[1:10:52] it, but it means you know he's in
[1:10:57] control.
[1:11:00] So when you ask for God to do this or do
[1:11:04] that and God says absolutely not, no, I
[1:11:08] will not do it.
[1:11:11] Notice in Isaiah chapter 55 about God's
[1:11:15] way versus our ways. Isaiah 55:84, "My
[1:11:19] thoughts are not your thoughts."
[1:11:23] Ain't you glad, man? If God's thoughts
[1:11:26] was no more than mine, we'd be serving a
[1:11:28] puny God. For my thoughts are not your
[1:11:31] thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
[1:11:37] saith the Lord. So then how can we
[1:11:39] understand everything that God does
[1:11:42] pertaining to our life? Whenever his
[1:11:45] ways are so much higher, his thoughts so
[1:11:48] much greater. For as the heavens are
[1:11:51] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[1:11:54] higher than your ways, and my thoughts
[1:11:59] higher are my thoughts than your
[1:12:01] thoughts. So his ways are so far beyond
[1:12:05] our ways. his thoughts greater than our
[1:12:08] thoughts. So, here we are in time and
[1:12:10] we're trying to understand when things
[1:12:12] happen around us and about our life and
[1:12:14] our loved ones or our church or whatever
[1:12:16] it is and we're trying to comprehend it
[1:12:18] and we just we we can't put it together.
[1:12:21] We look at it from where? Our thoughts,
[1:12:23] our ways, our understanding, our
[1:12:26] capability, our perception of what we
[1:12:28] think the will of God is. And God's
[1:12:31] looking way beyond that and said, "No,
[1:12:33] but you're missing this and that and the
[1:12:35] other." And what does God give us
[1:12:37] sometimes by his
[1:12:39] mercy? A little bit of knowledge.
[1:12:47] You see, I myself have
[1:12:51] had a little bit of that recently.
[1:12:56] Notice in Jeremiah
[1:12:58] 29:11, "For I know the
[1:13:02] thoughts that I think towards you, saith
[1:13:05] the Lord, thoughts of peace
[1:13:09] and not of evil,
[1:13:12] to give
[1:13:13] you an expected end."
[1:13:18] Do we believe that?
[1:13:21] Even when things go different than what
[1:13:23] we think, Is this scripture still true?
[1:13:28] But now you see what we will need
[1:13:30] whenever things will go contrary to what
[1:13:33] Jeremiah
[1:13:34] 29:11 what we think it means. What do we
[1:13:38] need to help us? Well, actually we need
[1:13:42] faith. But faith ain't
[1:13:44] enough. And virtue that would be very
[1:13:48] helpful. But we need a little bit of
[1:13:52] divine knowledge of God. Yes. Divine
[1:13:56] knowledge to help us to
[1:13:59] understand this scripture is still true
[1:14:02] even when he says no.
[1:14:05] Let's read if you would in Colossians
[1:14:08] chapter 1 verse 9. Now, I'm going to go
[1:14:11] here in a few moments with Paul and his
[1:14:14] thorn in the
[1:14:15] flesh. And how Paul needed not just
[1:14:19] faith, not miracles, but he needed
[1:14:24] knowledge. Knowledge. And this is what
[1:14:28] God shared with him about his situation.
[1:14:31] Colossians 1:9 For this cause we also
[1:14:34] since the day we heard of it do not
[1:14:36] cease to pray for you and to desire that
[1:14:39] you may be
[1:14:41] filled with the
[1:14:43] knowledge of his will.
[1:14:48] Okay. So not just be filled with the
[1:14:51] knowledge of his word.
[1:14:55] not be filled with the knowledge of
[1:14:57] Greek words and Aramaic words and Hebrew
[1:14:59] words and Webster and all of that, but
[1:15:02] the
[1:15:04] knowledge of his will.
[1:15:08] Now, we know that
[1:15:09] our our messenger that we want to look
[1:15:13] at, Paul, the great apostle, he had many
[1:15:17] many great visitations from God. Angels
[1:15:21] of the Lord would talk to him and appear
[1:15:23] to him.
[1:15:25] And then he said, "I knew a man about 14
[1:15:29] years ago, whether in the flesh or out
[1:15:32] of the flesh, I cannot
[1:15:35] tell. But such and one was carried up
[1:15:38] into the third
[1:15:41] heavens." And he saw and heard things
[1:15:44] which was not lawful for a man to utter.
[1:15:49] It must have been beyond anything he had
[1:15:52] ever
[1:15:53] experienced in his
[1:15:57] life. Now, let me shock all
[1:16:00] you. That experience would
[1:16:04] absolutely
[1:16:07] ruin his earthly
[1:16:10] ministry if
[1:16:12] God and his infinite
[1:16:15] wisdom did not give him a thorn.
[1:16:22] I was down by on my knees at the end of
[1:16:24] the house the other day pulling out some
[1:16:27] weeds and I reached down laying there on
[1:16:30] the ground. There was a weed. Now there
[1:16:31] was a barberry bush there and I knew
[1:16:34] better than to get my hand into that
[1:16:36] thing. But the wind had blowed a little
[1:16:39] piece of that dead barberry bush that I
[1:16:41] did not see and it was entangled in that
[1:16:45] live weed.
[1:16:47] So, no. So, when I reached down to grab
[1:16:50] a hold to that weed to pull it up out of
[1:16:53] the landscaping there in the end of our
[1:16:57] house, I got the barberry bush at the
[1:16:59] same time. Now, I'm still carrying that
[1:17:03] little thorn right there in my son. I
[1:17:06] told Carol driving down to to the
[1:17:08] funeral of Sister Carol and I said in a
[1:17:11] very very small small way I know what
[1:17:15] Paul was dealing with was a thorn in the
[1:17:18] flesh. Now it's amazing because those
[1:17:21] thorns I don't know if you're familiar
[1:17:22] with them or not. Your landscape
[1:17:23] brothers do of course. They are so tiny
[1:17:26] and they're so small. They're smaller
[1:17:28] than a than a blackberry thorn. They're
[1:17:30] so much smaller than a a thorn on a
[1:17:32] rose. They are so tiny and they are so
[1:17:36] sharp and they can go inside of you and
[1:17:39] break off just like that. And oh my, you
[1:17:42] talking about a pain. I'm going to have
[1:17:44] to tackle this thing when I go back home
[1:17:46] this evening because as I'm rubbing my
[1:17:48] other thumb over the top of this thumb,
[1:17:51] I'm feeling that thorn. You see, I'm
[1:17:54] feeling it. So, I took a blade and I
[1:17:56] tried to scrape over it. And uh
[1:17:58] eventually I'm just going to have to
[1:18:00] face the music and get a really sharp
[1:18:02] needle and dig down in there. But what
[1:18:04] happens is I will have to make the hole
[1:18:07] three to four times bigger than the hole
[1:18:10] actually was when the thorn went in. So
[1:18:13] there's something about a thorn that God
[1:18:16] allows to attach to our flesh. It can go
[1:18:19] in so easy and be so hard to get out.
[1:18:23] And it can be so painful when you're
[1:18:26] there and you'll forget about it. As a
[1:18:28] matter of fact, I'd forgotten about it
[1:18:30] yesterday. I was under the pressure
[1:18:32] preaching a funeral and I always get
[1:18:33] tore up when I'm under that. So I I'd
[1:18:35] basically forgotten about it until this
[1:18:38] morning whenever I got up and I was
[1:18:40] going to wash my face and all that sort
[1:18:42] of thing and picked up a washcloth and
[1:18:44] what I did. Ah, you got it. I rad it
[1:18:47] across that thumb and it reminded me of
[1:18:51] its presence. Yes, sir. Now, can you
[1:18:53] imagine God allowing a thorn in Paul's
[1:18:57] flesh because God knew this heavenly
[1:19:01] visitation would ruin
[1:19:06] his earthly ministry
[1:19:10] without a thorn. Yeah.
[1:19:14] You see, God alone knows how to share
[1:19:19] the supernatural realm with his
[1:19:22] children. He knows how much to give us.
[1:19:26] He knows how much to let us step from
[1:19:29] the natural into the supernatural and
[1:19:32] merge into that supernatural. And it's
[1:19:35] no problem while we're there. It's just
[1:19:37] when we come
[1:19:39] out and how will we view
[1:19:42] ourselves when we come out and what will
[1:19:46] that do to
[1:19:48] us? It's evident it's destroyed many
[1:19:53] people. Many people would have been
[1:19:55] better off had they
[1:19:57] never had a very deep indulgence into
[1:20:00] the supernatural realm
[1:20:03] because it's destroyed them.
[1:20:08] But if we seek the face of God according
[1:20:12] to his wisdom. Now remember the prophet
[1:20:14] tells us in harvest time that Satan can
[1:20:16] hand out these supernatural gifts by the
[1:20:19] handfuls.
[1:20:22] And angels, Satan's demons can appear as
[1:20:26] angels of light because Satan himself
[1:20:30] can dress the same way. Satan is the
[1:20:34] king of costumes. Yeah.
[1:20:38] Now watch. Paul said, "Lest I should be
[1:20:41] exalted
[1:20:43] above
[1:20:45] measure through the
[1:20:49] abundance of the
[1:20:53] revelations."
[1:20:56] Wow. That was given to me a thorn in the
[1:20:59] flesh.
[1:21:01] I don't know if you remembered or not,
[1:21:02] but I preached a sermon to you years and
[1:21:04] years ago. Thorns and
[1:21:08] Revelations. Well, that don't seem to go
[1:21:10] together, does it? But it does if you're
[1:21:12] a son.
[1:21:15] If you're a son. Now, why would God ever
[1:21:19] allow a man to go into such a sphere,
[1:21:22] such a
[1:21:24] realm, knowing it would cost
[1:21:27] him the rest of his
[1:21:31] life, he would never be the same
[1:21:35] Paul seeing what he saw. I can't
[1:21:38] imagine, the prophet said, if he went to
[1:21:39] the first heaven and Paul was carried up
[1:21:41] to the third, he couldn't even imagine
[1:21:42] what he saw. Can you imagine a man going
[1:21:45] into that realm and being there in the
[1:21:47] presence of God? Yet when he come out of
[1:21:50] that realm, God said,
[1:21:53] "Paul, I hate to do this to you,
[1:21:58] but even though you're a man filled with
[1:22:00] the Holy Ghost, you are still living in
[1:22:03] a human temple that can be contaminated
[1:22:07] with pride
[1:22:10] and
[1:22:11] arrogance." cuz not another man in the
[1:22:14] entire New
[1:22:16] Testament ever saw what Paul
[1:22:21] saw. Now I want you to listen what he
[1:22:23] says. There was given unto me a thorn in
[1:22:25] the
[1:22:25] flesh, the messenger of
[1:22:29] Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
[1:22:35] exalted above measure. You mean all of
[1:22:38] this was brought? Now remember, Paul
[1:22:40] hadn't done anything. It wasn't that he
[1:22:42] had told, you know, told a lie. It
[1:22:44] wasn't that he was stealing people's
[1:22:45] money. It wasn't that he was after
[1:22:47] somebody's wife. None of that. This
[1:22:50] happened because of what God gave him.
[1:22:56] God showed him this great abundance of
[1:22:58] things and he will pay for the rest of
[1:23:01] his life.
[1:23:07] Oh my. So God gave him the messenger of
[1:23:10] Satan or allowed the messenger of Satan
[1:23:12] to come and buffet me. Buffet. So it
[1:23:15] would it would hit him and knock him
[1:23:17] down and then he'd struggle and have to
[1:23:20] get up over the top of it and then he'd
[1:23:22] have victory over it for a while and
[1:23:24] then it would buff it. You know what the
[1:23:26] word buffet means? Don't it's to hit, to
[1:23:28] smack, to
[1:23:30] hit. So this demon
[1:23:34] demon a messenger from
[1:23:39] Satan.
[1:23:41] My for this thing I besought the Lord
[1:23:46] thrice three
[1:23:48] times that it might
[1:23:51] depart from me. draw away, to remove, to
[1:23:55] go away, to depart from anyone, to
[1:24:00] desert, withdraw from
[1:24:03] one. And he said unto
[1:24:06] me, "My
[1:24:09] grace is
[1:24:12] sufficient." So Paul asked for
[1:24:16] deliverance and got grace.
[1:24:19] Yes sir.
[1:24:22] Now remember the prophet tells us it was
[1:24:24] his
[1:24:26] eyes after seeing the pillar fired. Then
[1:24:29] his eyes were never quite the same
[1:24:31] again. So he would have to write
[1:24:33] sometimes using great big old letters.
[1:24:36] So if you would have got him and said,
[1:24:37] "My goodness, look at the size of them
[1:24:39] letters." You know, they probably look
[1:24:40] about like that screen right there. And
[1:24:42] it's because Paul couldn't see.
[1:24:46] So he's trying to write them and he have
[1:24:48] to race it out and try to and he said
[1:24:50] you see by my own hand have I written
[1:24:52] this large letter. So he was talking
[1:24:54] about it was a big book but it was a big
[1:24:56] old gigantic letter. So his eyes would
[1:24:58] become real runny and pus coming out of
[1:25:01] his eyes and him trying to sit there and
[1:25:04] write. Now you imagine the man who wrote
[1:25:06] the most of the whole New Testament
[1:25:09] and fighting with his eyes. Wouldn't it
[1:25:11] seem to you and I that it would have
[1:25:13] been better that God would have
[1:25:14] afflicted some other part? God knows how
[1:25:17] to let these things happen to us.
[1:25:20] Now, I want you to notice now Paul is
[1:25:23] praying three times. God, let this thing
[1:25:26] leave me in the name of
[1:25:28] Jesus. Go away from me, you evil thing.
[1:25:31] You're out of the pits of hell.
[1:25:35] So God
[1:25:37] says, "I'm not going to deliver
[1:25:41] you. I'm going to give you
[1:25:46] grace." Now, what is God sharing with
[1:25:50] Paul? Divine
[1:25:53] knowledge about the will of
[1:25:56] God for his life.
[1:26:01] He hasn't given him virtue. He hasn't
[1:26:04] given him more godliness. He hasn't
[1:26:05] given him brotherly kindness. I mean,
[1:26:07] this this has nothing to do with
[1:26:08] brotherly kindness. It has to do with
[1:26:10] him. Him. God, I could serve you so much
[1:26:14] better. I could write better. The
[1:26:16] brothers could read it better. If you
[1:26:18] just heal my God, please deliver me of
[1:26:21] this
[1:26:22] thing. Now, let me ask you, would it
[1:26:25] hindered your faith this morning if Paul
[1:26:26] would have walked out here to
[1:26:28] preach and one of our deacon brothers or
[1:26:31] me? I would I would have to go over to
[1:26:32] the door and take him by the hand and
[1:26:34] now be careful here, brother Paul. Be
[1:26:35] careful that brother. Watch that. Watch
[1:26:37] that chair. And I'd lead him over here
[1:26:39] and he'd come up here and say, "Brother
[1:26:41] Donnie, kind of help me here. How's this
[1:26:43] pullpit made?" Well, it's sort of a half
[1:26:45] a circle. Brother Paul, you just get
[1:26:48] right there in the middle of it and
[1:26:50] you'll be good either way. You got two
[1:26:51] feet or so on the other side, both sides
[1:26:53] of you. You can walk out. It's about 18
[1:26:55] inches wide, something like that, maybe
[1:26:57] a little less, and you'll be really
[1:26:59] good. And there's a rail out in front of
[1:27:00] you. It's okay, brother Dian. I'm really
[1:27:02] having a hard time seeing the people
[1:27:04] this morning. And some of you alls was
[1:27:06] sick and you heard that God used this
[1:27:08] man to lay hands on the sick and they
[1:27:09] recovered. Would you have enough faith
[1:27:11] to be able to say, "Brother Paul, would
[1:27:13] you pray for me or would you look at him
[1:27:14] and say, "How in the world can a man
[1:27:16] who's supposed to have so much faith
[1:27:17] can't even see
[1:27:21] and you come up here for prayer and I
[1:27:23] have to take brother Paul's hands and
[1:27:25] no, here, brother Paul, it's it No, it's
[1:27:26] not that person, brother Paul. Oh, I I I
[1:27:28] I I can't see him real good, brother.
[1:27:30] Which one is it? It's this brother here.
[1:27:32] Okay. Would that shake your
[1:27:35] faith? Would that hinder your faith of a
[1:27:38] man that could speak to a woman that was
[1:27:40] possessed of a demon, of a spirit of
[1:27:42] witchcraft and idolatry, and cast that
[1:27:45] devil out of her and he himself have to
[1:27:48] be let out.
[1:27:56] Sometimes friends, we need divine
[1:27:59] knowledge of the will of God for our
[1:28:01] lives.
[1:28:05] And he said unto me, my grace is
[1:28:07] sufficient for
[1:28:08] thee. To me, this is one of the most
[1:28:11] awesome scriptures in the New Testament
[1:28:14] after salvation, the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:16] Ghost. For my
[1:28:19] strength is made
[1:28:23] perfect in
[1:28:28] weakness. Now, I want you to listen to
[1:28:30] his
[1:28:31] response. God, I can't believe you're
[1:28:34] doing this to
[1:28:35] me. Are you kidding me? I've been
[1:28:38] shipwrecked for you 14 days in in the
[1:28:41] deep without what I see on the side. I'm
[1:28:44] going through all this and another and
[1:28:45] this is your
[1:28:47] response. I simply ask you to give just
[1:28:50] a little bit of your power that I've
[1:28:52] seen you do all these marvelous things
[1:28:53] and you say
[1:28:55] no. I ask for healing and you say no.
[1:28:58] I'm giving you
[1:29:01] grace. You see grace don't just apply
[1:29:04] when you're a sinner.
[1:29:06] As a matter of fact, you'll need a whole
[1:29:08] bunch more of it every day of your life
[1:29:09] to help you go through your trials of
[1:29:11] life.
[1:29:12] You understand what gets you through the
[1:29:14] things of life? Grace.
[1:29:16] Oh, come on now. Grace.
[1:29:20] Oh my. Now listen is his
[1:29:24] response. Most gladly.
[1:29:32] Therefore, I will I rather
[1:29:37] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:29:40] of
[1:29:42] Christ may rest upon
[1:29:46] me. So, he ain't going to belly ache. He
[1:29:49] ain't going to cry. He ain't going to
[1:29:51] blame God. He ain't going to go
[1:29:53] questioning God all the time. And he
[1:29:54] said, "Fine. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[1:29:58] Jesus."
[1:29:59] Amen.
[1:30:01] Listen friend, that was not virtue.
[1:30:04] That was not brotherly kindness. What
[1:30:05] was it? God gave him a portion of his
[1:30:09] own
[1:30:11] knowledge about what he's going through
[1:30:14] and it helped him to face it. Did he
[1:30:18] understand it, Lance? Maybe not. He
[1:30:20] don't say anything about understanding
[1:30:22] it. But God departed to his son an
[1:30:26] element of divine knowledge about the
[1:30:28] will of God. You imagine, brother John,
[1:30:29] when God shows him this, if I take this
[1:30:32] away from
[1:30:33] you, you'll become exalted above Peter,
[1:30:37] James, John, Bartholomew, Matthew,
[1:30:39] Thaddius, all these brethren because
[1:30:41] Paul, I'm telling you, they ain't nobody
[1:30:43] ain't nobody in the New Testament or
[1:30:45] ever going to walk where you walked by
[1:30:46] seventh angels going to come on the
[1:30:48] earth. And I'll let him see the first
[1:30:50] heaven, but I've reserved this special
[1:30:51] visit for you only. Not another mortal
[1:30:54] will ever see it. But God, I got the
[1:30:57] Holy Ghost. But God, I'm a son. I'm a
[1:31:00] church age messenger. But Paul, you're
[1:31:01] still a human being.
[1:31:05] And you'll fight pride and arrogance
[1:31:09] and feeling like you're more gifted
[1:31:12] than your brothers.
[1:31:15] Your ministry is greater, more profound.
[1:31:21] Oh my goodness.
[1:31:23] Well, welcome to the Thorn Church.
[1:31:29] Let me be honest with you today. If God
[1:31:33] if God would answer my prayer and remove
[1:31:35] the thorns out of my
[1:31:37] life and he would see down the road
[1:31:39] somewhere, I would become arrogant and
[1:31:41] proud. I pray to God he never pulls a
[1:31:44] one of them. And I'm going to go and say
[1:31:47] it for you because some of you are too
[1:31:48] big of a chicken to say it. I pray never
[1:31:50] takes the thorns out of your life
[1:31:52] neither. Sometimes thorns is your boss.
[1:31:55] Sometimes thorns might be your young
[1:31:56] ones. Sometimes thorns might be this or
[1:31:59] that or the other. But the Lord God
[1:32:01] knows exactly which is worse worth the
[1:32:03] most to you to be thornree or have
[1:32:07] thorns in your life and it be the divine
[1:32:09] wisdom and knowledge of God. That's
[1:32:11] right. Oh my. So Paul asked, "Let this
[1:32:16] leave me. Depart from my body, Satan, in
[1:32:20] the name of Jesus. Get out of here."
[1:32:25] And God said, "No,
[1:32:29] but instead of deliverance, here's
[1:32:32] grace." God, I don't want
[1:32:35] grace. I'm a sign preacher. I'm a
[1:32:38] miracle preacher. I'm a healing
[1:32:39] preacher. I want to be an example.
[1:32:43] How can I be an example of a of a gifted
[1:32:46] preacher
[1:32:48] when I can't even see who I'm preaching
[1:32:50] to sometimes?
[1:32:54] Well, actually, Paul, you're a greater
[1:32:55] example.
[1:33:01] My
[1:33:02] grace. So the Lord answered his
[1:33:07] prayer not by removing the
[1:33:10] thorn but by giving grace
[1:33:15] to bear it
[1:33:18] the
[1:33:19] assurance. I know about it, Paul.
[1:33:23] I'm with you.
[1:33:26] But trust me, okay? Trust me.
[1:33:30] If I pull this
[1:33:32] thorn, you'll be
[1:33:35] exalted. But Jesus, I love you. Of
[1:33:38] course you love me, Paul. That's your
[1:33:40] soul saying that. But your
[1:33:43] body cannot be trusted. Amen. I hope
[1:33:48] somebody's hearing me today.
[1:33:51] Now, humanly, we tell, well, it be
[1:33:53] better for the calamity to be gone, for
[1:33:54] all that to be taken away from him. But
[1:33:56] our father knows best. And the church
[1:34:00] said, "Amen." Now, I want you to notice
[1:34:03] as Paul goes on in this and he he
[1:34:07] reaches this spot and he says, "The Lord
[1:34:10] says, "My my grace is
[1:34:13] sufficient." And Paul in his mind, it it
[1:34:16] releases something to him. And he says,
[1:34:20] "Okay, well, I'll glory." Now you
[1:34:21] understand what he's writing here is an
[1:34:24] excerpt from a word of
[1:34:27] knowledge from God about his
[1:34:32] life. So weakness is
[1:34:35] strength if
[1:34:37] Jesus is in it.
[1:34:41] Weakness is
[1:34:43] strength if
[1:34:45] Jesus is in it. Remember Gideon and his
[1:34:48] 300 and their pitchers and and remember
[1:34:51] David's sling and Moses rod and on and
[1:34:54] on and on we go. Now, let me read it
[1:34:57] read to you
[1:34:58] again. Paul's experience in
[1:35:04] heaven could have
[1:35:06] ruined his
[1:35:08] ministry on earth.
[1:35:14] Now, you may think it's foolish, and you
[1:35:15] may think it sounds very simple, but I
[1:35:20] honestly don't think that
[1:35:23] preachers should try to just travel
[1:35:26] overseas and go here and go there and do
[1:35:29] this and open doors because they think
[1:35:31] they should do it.
[1:35:34] I know of a man in this message that
[1:35:36] went to a certain
[1:35:38] country several years
[1:35:40] ago and after the visit to that
[1:35:45] country, he changed that
[1:35:48] man. He has never been the same. Not in
[1:35:52] a good
[1:35:57] way. It changed
[1:35:59] him. It changed him.
[1:36:03] Oh, you mean God God would do
[1:36:07] that? You see, our capacity, our walk
[1:36:10] with God is
[1:36:11] ordained in a certain spot. Remember
[1:36:15] brother Brandham having to go to brother
[1:36:16] Neville and he said the Lord spoke to
[1:36:18] him early one morning. I don't remember
[1:36:20] now for 2 or 3:00 something like that in
[1:36:22] the morning and the Lord said go to
[1:36:25] brother
[1:36:26] Neville. Now this is question answers
[1:36:29] where the prophet is dealing with the
[1:36:30] gifts. Now, Brother Neville was speaking
[1:36:33] in tongues or interpreting or
[1:36:34] prophesying over people. And he said
[1:36:37] that the Lord told brother Random to go
[1:36:39] to him and tell him. He said, "Because
[1:36:42] the people will pull you into a spot and
[1:36:45] having you say things that is not
[1:36:48] right." Oh,
[1:36:52] why? Because people want to hear it that
[1:36:55] way.
[1:36:57] And you know what they do? They will
[1:36:59] pull preachers into a spot. Well, I feel
[1:37:02] this and and I see that and I I I think
[1:37:05] this and and and and the Lord says this
[1:37:07] and the Lord says that. Now, come on.
[1:37:10] Don't get any quieter on me than you
[1:37:11] already are. Amen. But you know what
[1:37:14] it'll do? It'll pull preachers then into
[1:37:17] the flesh and they'll go to saying
[1:37:19] things that the Lord don't say. And you
[1:37:22] remember this. God does not lie. Amen.
[1:37:26] And if God says something's going to
[1:37:28] come to pass, it's going to come to
[1:37:30] pass. And Word of Life Church said,
[1:37:33] "Amen." Now, you see what happens when
[1:37:36] men and I I I've seen it so many times
[1:37:39] myself through the years when men may
[1:37:41] start out with a good impression, you
[1:37:44] know, and and then hit then a miss and a
[1:37:46] hit and then a miss and they with a good
[1:37:48] desire to be able to help the people of
[1:37:50] God to build their faith and then it's
[1:37:52] wrong here and then it's wrong there.
[1:37:54] Then you get a life here devastated by
[1:37:57] discernment so-called that wasn't even
[1:37:59] true. Things that were said that were
[1:38:02] not even true. Oh, believe me, I'm still
[1:38:05] dealing with some of the effects that's
[1:38:07] going on around the message right now of
[1:38:10] people who have been told certain
[1:38:12] things. As a matter of fact, one young
[1:38:14] lady that was told a certain thing and a
[1:38:17] prayer line about drove a poor thing
[1:38:20] nuts. Her mother and father had to wind
[1:38:23] up taking her to an insane asylum
[1:38:28] because a message preacher told her
[1:38:29] something that was not right.
[1:38:33] You mean God does that? Come on,
[1:38:35] somebody. God don't lie.
[1:38:40] But you see what it does? It causes men
[1:38:43] and they pull toward a certain way
[1:38:46] because why? People want it. They wanted
[1:38:50] it from the prophet whenever he would do
[1:38:53] the discernment. Then he said, "Now I'm
[1:38:54] going to rest myself for a while." And
[1:38:56] the people would come across the
[1:38:58] platform and you can notice their
[1:39:00] expectation. It would stop dropping down
[1:39:03] and their faith would drop down. Said,
[1:39:04] "No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. He's
[1:39:06] still here. He's still here. Hey, look
[1:39:07] at this woman here. She's got so and so
[1:39:09] and so." And then he'd do a couple three
[1:39:11] of them and boy, their faith would go
[1:39:13] through the roof again.
[1:39:16] The angel of the Lord had to rebuke him.
[1:39:20] Now, come on now. Get quiet on me. The
[1:39:23] angel of the Lord hadn't appeared to him
[1:39:25] in 6 months. And whenever he did appear
[1:39:28] to him in 1947, he tells us about it.
[1:39:31] And he said the angel got on him, in our
[1:39:33] words, rebuked him because he was
[1:39:36] spending too much time on miracles.
[1:39:40] How in the world can you spend too much
[1:39:43] time on miracles? But apparently you
[1:39:44] can. I love miracles, but we're not
[1:39:48] going to take the rapture by miracles.
[1:39:50] We're going to take the rapture by the
[1:39:52] word. Come on, somebody. Over and over
[1:39:56] again, the prophet as with Moses 1960,
[1:39:59] listen to it yourself. And he said that
[1:40:01] he had pointed the people toward the
[1:40:03] sign instead of the city itself. And
[1:40:07] it's the same thing in the day and hour
[1:40:09] that we're living in. And if we're not
[1:40:10] careful, all we're going to produce is a
[1:40:12] bunch of sign seekers. And if they can't
[1:40:14] tell me my name or or tell me what
[1:40:16] dentist I go to, I know what dentist I
[1:40:19] go to still. Thankfully, in 10 years,
[1:40:22] check with me. You might have to let me
[1:40:23] know and help me. But as of this
[1:40:25] morning, I know my dentist's name, my
[1:40:28] doctor's name, my savior's name, my
[1:40:30] church name, my name, my wife's name,
[1:40:33] and luckily most of you all. I still
[1:40:35] know your name. But tell me something
[1:40:37] that'll get me closer to Jesus. Don't
[1:40:40] try to pull on my flesh, but give me
[1:40:43] something that'll make me more like
[1:40:46] [Applause]
[1:40:54] him. So what did God
[1:40:58] do? God
[1:41:00] dropped this element of knowledge. I I I
[1:41:03] find this to be so amazing to me because
[1:41:06] this man had wrote things that no other
[1:41:08] man had written in the New Testament by
[1:41:10] the time he writes this 2
[1:41:12] Corinthians. So it wasn't Godhead. It
[1:41:14] wasn't water baptism. It wasn't the
[1:41:16] deity of God. It wasn't about any of
[1:41:18] those things. But one of the greatest
[1:41:21] excerpts of knowledge that he ever
[1:41:24] received was about
[1:41:28] himself. About himself.
[1:41:33] And we wouldn't think it was good news,
[1:41:36] but he's acting like he won the
[1:41:39] lottery. I mean, he was acting, "Oh my
[1:41:41] goodness, this is
[1:41:43] wonderful. This is glorious." And they
[1:41:46] probably thought, "He's crazy. Poor guy
[1:41:48] drove him. It's drove him
[1:41:53] over. Do you understand why God did
[1:41:55] this?
[1:41:57] He would have become so
[1:42:00] proud and so
[1:42:04] arrogant. This must have been an extreme
[1:42:07] situation. Watch this in question
[1:42:10] answers. Satan was the original
[1:42:12] archangel of God. He once dwelt in the
[1:42:15] heaven. He was once the greatest person
[1:42:18] in the
[1:42:20] heavens outside of God.
[1:42:26] So your enemy at one
[1:42:29] time was the next person
[1:42:33] to
[1:42:38] God. He was God's right-hand
[1:42:42] man to
[1:42:44] fellowship. So if God wanted to
[1:42:46] fellowship with anybody, he fellowship
[1:42:49] with Lucifer.
[1:42:52] Lightbringer. That's what the word means
[1:42:54] before his
[1:42:58] fall. So he was God's right-hand man to
[1:43:04] fellowship, day star,
[1:43:07] lightbringer, the one who stopped the
[1:43:10] approach.
[1:43:12] Isaiah in charge of the music department
[1:43:16] in heaven. Thy tablets and thy harps
[1:43:19] were formed in thee the day that thou
[1:43:22] hast created and thy
[1:43:25] pipes thouast been in the garden of God.
[1:43:28] Every precious stone was thy covering.
[1:43:30] The sardis, the topaz, the carbuncle.
[1:43:32] You'll notice the stones of his
[1:43:36] coverings are the foundations of the
[1:43:38] cities that you're going to.
[1:43:41] Heavenly colors and stones.
[1:43:44] Notice he was God's right-hand man to
[1:43:46] fellowship and he got puffed
[1:43:49] up in his
[1:43:53] heart. And isn't that just the way that
[1:43:56] people get today? To me, this is one of
[1:43:59] the saddest quotes and question
[1:44:02] answers. Let God just bless a fella and
[1:44:05] put a little confidence in him and he
[1:44:08] gets to be a knowit-all.
[1:44:12] He's got to start an organization or
[1:44:14] he's got to do something that's
[1:44:16] different. And then the prophet quotes
[1:44:18] this scripture, "How art thou fallen
[1:44:20] from heaven, oh
[1:44:22] Lucifer?" Listen, this church, it breaks
[1:44:26] my heart every time I read this. God has
[1:44:29] a hard
[1:44:31] time. Can you imagine God having a hard
[1:44:34] time with
[1:44:36] anything? But when it comes to us, Yes,
[1:44:40] sir. When it comes to
[1:44:42] preachers, God has a hard time trying to
[1:44:46] get somebody he can deal
[1:44:49] with that'll stay
[1:44:52] humble. Not start off humble,
[1:44:56] but stay humble
[1:44:59] and meek and stay in the place until God
[1:45:02] calls him to do something. Do you
[1:45:04] believe that? Amen. A man that God can
[1:45:08] bless and he'll still keep himself a man
[1:45:13] and not be an
[1:45:14] angel or a God.
[1:45:19] Don't you see? Since Satan whispered
[1:45:21] that to Eve that day, you shall be as
[1:45:25] God's.
[1:45:29] That's exactly what he's done. He's done
[1:45:30] it in our ranks. How many have we seen
[1:45:33] this rise and fall around us? Why? They
[1:45:37] can't stay humble. They want to be an
[1:45:40] angel or a
[1:45:41] god. So, their ministry has to be above
[1:45:44] everybody else. Have to have this and
[1:45:45] that and the other. Nobody has what we
[1:45:47] have in our church. You better watch
[1:45:49] that whispering devil. Don't you never
[1:45:51] allow that evil thing to come in this
[1:45:54] church. Come on, somebody.
[1:45:57] Amen. And if we're the only church
[1:45:58] that's got the move of God, there's
[1:46:00] something bad wrong somewhere. If I'm
[1:46:02] the only man that's preaching the truth,
[1:46:04] there's something bad wrong somewhere.
[1:46:07] There is a bride of Christ around this
[1:46:12] world. Don't never let that thing get a
[1:46:15] hold of us.
[1:46:20] Oh Lord
[1:46:21] God, as soon as man gets blessed and he
[1:46:24] has a little something given to him, he
[1:46:27] wants to become a
[1:46:29] god. He wants to become an
[1:46:32] angel. He wants to become some great
[1:46:36] person. Now this is the way we notice
[1:46:38] when they're becoming a great person in
[1:46:40] their own eyes. what I do. Me and me and
[1:46:48] mine. That's the wrong
[1:46:51] attitude. God's
[1:46:54] hunting for
[1:46:57] somebody. I never read this quote,
[1:46:59] Brother Dave, that I don't think about,
[1:47:00] Brother Johnson, when we was over with
[1:47:02] the church and y'all been the church for
[1:47:04] for a few
[1:47:05] years. Now, I read this at the closing
[1:47:08] of a sermon and everybody was standing
[1:47:11] up and from those of you that remember
[1:47:13] Brother Johnson, he couldn't see, so he
[1:47:15] had his hands on the back of the pew in
[1:47:17] front of
[1:47:18] him. And I read this quote and he said,
[1:47:22] "God's hunting for somebody that he
[1:47:24] could bless and pour out his blessings.
[1:47:26] And the more he's blessed, the littleer
[1:47:30] the man will become." And I can still
[1:47:32] see it in my mind today. Every time I
[1:47:35] read this quote, I see it. So, Brother
[1:47:37] Johnson is standing here with his hands
[1:47:39] on the pew and whenever I said Lillard,
[1:47:42] he hunched down. Hunch down. Hunch
[1:47:51] down. But you see, it's not in
[1:47:54] this to operate that way.
[1:47:57] It's in this to operate this way.
[1:48:00] Higher, higher, bigger, bigger.
[1:48:05] greater greater then man starts stepping
[1:48:08] up on chairs then chairs ain't high
[1:48:11] enough so he'll step up on the organ and
[1:48:14] he'll step up on the Lesley then he'll
[1:48:16] get a 6ft ladder an 8ft ladder a 12ft
[1:48:19] ladder
[1:48:23] and he keeps getting higher higher
[1:48:26] higher till he gets to a spot that he
[1:48:29] can look down on
[1:48:30] everybody around
[1:48:46] God's hunting for somebody who he can
[1:48:48] bless and pour out the blessings. And
[1:48:50] the more he bless, the littleer the man
[1:48:53] will
[1:48:54] become. This is phenomenal.
[1:48:57] You'll never get more of
[1:48:59] God until you
[1:49:02] become
[1:49:05] nothing. You've got to belittle. This is
[1:49:09] the
[1:49:09] key. You've got to
[1:49:12] belittle
[1:49:15] yourself. Keep yourself
[1:49:17] small in your own
[1:49:20] eyes. If anybody's going to toot the
[1:49:22] horn, let it be other people tooting
[1:49:25] your horn. Yeah.
[1:49:26] But with some
[1:49:28] folks, they don't give anybody else an
[1:49:30] opportunity to toot their horn because
[1:49:32] they're tooting it so much theirel. So
[1:49:35] he that tootethth his own horn toot in
[1:49:37] an abundant measure so that his horn may
[1:49:39] be toot us.
[1:49:41] Donnie 32 and3.
[1:49:43] So we've got a lot of folks that are
[1:49:45] tooting their horn or blowing their horn
[1:49:46] how great they are, how great the church
[1:49:48] is, how great our ministry is. We're
[1:49:50] greater than everybody else. Do you
[1:49:51] understand what we're doing?
[1:49:55] Don't do preach yourself that way.
[1:49:58] Please don't do it.
[1:50:03] You've got to belittle yourself. He that
[1:50:05] will exalt himself, God will obey. He
[1:50:08] that will humble himself, God will
[1:50:10] exalt. You've got to get little before
[1:50:12] you can get big. Listen to this. And
[1:50:15] you'll never be big in your own self.
[1:50:21] And you'll only be as big as
[1:50:24] God will be big in you.
[1:50:31] Let's stand. Or maybe I should say
[1:50:34] kneel.
[1:50:39] Most gladly.
[1:50:43] Therefore, Hallelujah.
[1:50:46] Will I rather glory in my
[1:50:52] infirmities? Count it a
[1:50:55] privilege to be
[1:50:58] afflicted if my
[1:51:01] trials may testify the grace of
[1:51:06] God. Anybody here beside me say, "Lord,
[1:51:09] I need help."
[1:51:12] How many of y'all glory in trials? How
[1:51:14] many of y'all have your greatest Holy
[1:51:15] Ghost fit? I mean, just shouting and
[1:51:17] dancing, glory to God. Hallelujah. When
[1:51:20] you're going through something, most of
[1:51:21] us ain't even got a hala, much less a
[1:51:23] hallelujah.
[1:51:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:30] Now, notice his infirmities are not his
[1:51:34] corruptions. His infirmities are not
[1:51:37] personal sins, besetting sins, but it's
[1:51:40] things that God is allowing him to go
[1:51:43] through to keep him humble.
[1:51:46] Isn't it amazing that God shared with
[1:51:48] this man this word of knowledge that was
[1:51:52] so
[1:51:53] profound? It changed his life for the
[1:51:57] rest of his
[1:52:01] life. Oh
[1:52:03] my. What about you
[1:52:06] today? Let me just read some of this to
[1:52:09] you quickly. I'll pick it up again, Lord
[1:52:12] willing, when I get back
[1:52:14] from from Switzerland. But who
[1:52:17] knows? It might be my last sermon I ever
[1:52:20] get to preach to you again anyway. So,
[1:52:21] I'm going to give it my all.
[1:52:24] Therefore, I take
[1:52:29] pleasure and
[1:52:31] infirmities. Pleasure. Be well pleased,
[1:52:35] think good, to do willingly, to be
[1:52:39] ready, to be favorably inclined
[1:52:45] towards. Therefore, I take pleasure in
[1:52:48] infirmities. infirmities, weakness,
[1:52:51] disease, sickness, one of strength to
[1:52:54] bear trials and troubles, in
[1:52:58] persecutions, in distresses. Oh my, in
[1:53:04] reproaches. Reproaches is hurt, harm,
[1:53:08] holiness, a wrong springing from
[1:53:10] insolence, injury
[1:53:12] inflicted by the violence of a temptist.
[1:53:17] What in the world happened to this man?
[1:53:20] Knowledge.
[1:53:24] Does it make sense? Yeah. Does it make
[1:53:26] sense? Yes. Don't just get in your mind.
[1:53:28] Oh, guess what quoting scriptures is
[1:53:30] quoting the message boy? No. Sometimes
[1:53:32] it's just a little bit of knowledge.
[1:53:35] I told you that I'd received a little
[1:53:38] bit of this. I
[1:53:41] have. It pertains to Erica.
[1:53:46] I've received some knowledge from the
[1:53:49] Lord, not
[1:53:51] understanding, but
[1:53:53] knowledge that our God makes no
[1:53:56] mistakes. Yeah.
[1:53:58] He knew the pain that would be brought.
[1:54:01] He knew the sadness in our hearts. He
[1:54:04] knew what we would feel.
[1:54:07] But his ways are higher than the heavens
[1:54:10] above the earth than our ways. Yeah. and
[1:54:12] his thoughts. Do you know what that's
[1:54:15] done for
[1:54:16] me? It's released to me a strength to
[1:54:20] help me to deal with it. Does it dry my
[1:54:23] tears?
[1:54:25] No. No. Actually, yesterday when I
[1:54:27] preached Sister Carolyn's
[1:54:29] funeral, I started crying
[1:54:32] again. And I told him, I I don't know
[1:54:35] who all has met Sister Carolyn
[1:54:38] yet, but I kind of have an idea.
[1:54:41] A little lady about that tall, long
[1:54:44] blonde hair, already couldn't run and
[1:54:47] screaming to her, her precious
[1:54:50] sister cuz she loved her so
[1:54:54] much. Did I rejoice and say, "Glory,
[1:54:57] hallelujah, to God." No. I choked up and
[1:55:00] couldn't hardly talk. Tears running down
[1:55:03] my eyes. Embarrassing,
[1:55:05] humiliating. A preacher ain't supposed
[1:55:07] to preach a funeral act like that. I
[1:55:09] don't care.
[1:55:12] If it bothers me the rest of my life,
[1:55:14] let me share you the knowledge that I've
[1:55:16] shared with it. People's lives have been
[1:55:18] changed by Erica's life been taken from
[1:55:23] us. I've heard from people all over the
[1:55:25] world who've been
[1:55:26] helped, preachers telling me, "Brother
[1:55:29] Donnie, you'll never know what it's done
[1:55:32] to see you stand there behind the
[1:55:33] pullpit and be strong." That's right.
[1:55:37] Because I understand it. No.
[1:55:40] because I've got a word of knowledge
[1:55:46] that I think she's going to be well. I
[1:55:48] did. The Lord never told me that. Ain't
[1:55:51] nothing you can ever say I ever said he
[1:55:52] did. You can ask my family. The Lord
[1:55:54] never one time ever told me he's going
[1:55:56] to hit her. I just believed he would.
[1:56:01] And I prayed more than three
[1:56:03] times. Paul three prayed three times and
[1:56:06] got an answer of grace. We prayed
[1:56:08] hundreds and hundreds of times for
[1:56:09] Erica.
[1:56:11] We also got an answer of grace. He took
[1:56:14] her from this life and ended her
[1:56:16] suffering
[1:56:18] and placed her in that word formed
[1:56:21] body that I'm waiting every day to see
[1:56:23] step in my house.
[1:56:28] Do I understand?
[1:56:29] No. Cuz the way I look at it, her baby
[1:56:33] girls need her now more than they've
[1:56:35] ever needed her. Her husband needs her
[1:56:38] now more than ever. Her mama, her
[1:56:41] sister, her sister-in-law, her in-laws,
[1:56:44] her mother-in-law, her father-in-law,
[1:56:46] many of you
[1:56:48] saints. And least and last, her
[1:56:54] daddy. Karen, I was walking into a store
[1:56:57] the other day and here come this little
[1:56:58] bitty old tiny girl. One of the cutest
[1:57:00] of those things you ever seen. and she
[1:57:01] had on had this umbrella and it was
[1:57:03] sitting right on top of her head like
[1:57:04] this and it was raining and she was
[1:57:07] packing that little umbrella and her and
[1:57:09] her
[1:57:10] mama. Immediately I went back to my
[1:57:12] little girl at that size.
[1:57:16] But you know what? Not one time if I got
[1:57:19] mad at God and said, "God, why? Why?"
[1:57:24] That would be beneath me to do that.
[1:57:30] cuz I trust him. Amen.
[1:57:34] And we'll understand it better.
[1:57:41] Sister Linda, it'll make more sense
[1:57:42] after a while. Sister Linda Nunley,
[1:57:46] it'll make more sense. Many of you
[1:57:49] standing here today, it'll make more
[1:57:51] sense after a while.
[1:57:53] But we lay upon our foundation of
[1:57:56] virtue,
[1:57:57] knowledge of God, about the will of God
[1:58:00] for our
[1:58:02] lives. I don't mind telling you, I don't
[1:58:04] like the position God places me in
[1:58:07] sometimes. I wish I could be the the
[1:58:09] kind of preacher around the message that
[1:58:11] everybody liked. Some preachers are that
[1:58:14] way. Everybody loves them. Nobody says
[1:58:17] anything against them. I'm the guy that
[1:58:19] packed guns for them.
[1:58:23] In reality, they pack guns
[1:58:27] looking for the opportunity to shoot me.
[1:58:30] I don't like that feeling.
[1:58:32] I'm hated, rejected, been talked about
[1:58:34] like a dog. Say, I blasphemed the Holy
[1:58:37] Ghost. But you know what? God dropped
[1:58:38] some knowledge in my heart a few years
[1:58:39] ago. It's part of who I am. So, you know
[1:58:43] what I'm going to do? Keep right on
[1:58:44] going.
[1:58:46] And I'm going to pray for them who want
[1:58:47] to kill me. I'm going to pray for them
[1:58:49] that despitefully use me. Now what about
[1:58:51] you
[1:58:53] as a son or daughter of God? What if
[1:58:56] God's chosen you to maybe suffer more
[1:58:59] than somebody else? Not have more
[1:59:01] miracles in your life, but more
[1:59:03] affliction. What if God's chosen you to
[1:59:06] be laughed at? Maybe more so than than
[1:59:08] other people. Will we take that as part
[1:59:11] of his will?
[1:59:13] How many needs knowledge today about
[1:59:15] your life?
[1:59:19] Let's bow our heads if you
[1:59:23] would. Praise the
[1:59:27] Lord, Lord Jesus. No doubt some of them
[1:59:30] here today
[1:59:31] and they're wondering in their
[1:59:33] mind, why do I have to go through this
[1:59:36] and why do I go through that and why do
[1:59:38] I have to deal with this?
[1:59:40] And maybe some whose loved ones have
[1:59:43] been taken while others have been
[1:59:44] spared.
[1:59:48] I've seen you heal people that weren't
[1:59:50] even really full word
[1:59:53] believers. And yet, I've seen you take
[1:59:55] others. And I realize by you sharing
[1:59:58] part of this knowledge with
[2:00:01] us that you could never use that person
[2:00:04] whose faith is
[2:00:06] weak to prove your
[2:00:09] greatness to say no to
[2:00:12] them because it would destroy them.
[2:00:16] Paul found such favor in your
[2:00:19] sight that he could hear and see things
[2:00:22] that was unlawful for a man to utter.
[2:00:24] Unlawful where? Unlawful on the
[2:00:29] earth. And yet you would allow the
[2:00:31] messenger of the devil to buffet him for
[2:00:33] the rest of his
[2:00:36] life. But you shared with him something
[2:00:39] that helped change his life. and he
[2:00:43] started gloring in
[2:00:45] infirmities. Now Lord, I'm sure some
[2:00:47] people believe here today trying to
[2:00:49] ponder in their mind, okay, so what I'm
[2:00:50] going through, is that God allowing it
[2:00:53] to happen or is it a trick of the devil?
[2:00:55] And truly, each of us need to find that
[2:00:58] for
[2:00:59] ourselves. I don't want to pray anything
[2:01:02] away from what I'm dealing with if
[2:01:04] you're allowing it to be there. But
[2:01:06] neither do I want to accept anything
[2:01:08] from the devil if he tries to mimic it.
[2:01:12] and say it's you. So it takes your will
[2:01:15] in our lives again. And when you drop it
[2:01:18] down there in our hearts and you give us
[2:01:22] grace, if you give us grace for the
[2:01:24] trial, then it will be your grace that
[2:01:27] sees us through. But if you anoint our
[2:01:30] knowledge by our faith and somehow we
[2:01:33] just believe this is not you trying us,
[2:01:36] it's the devil trying to rob us. then
[2:01:39] that affliction, that disease, that
[2:01:41] sickness, whatever more can leave right
[2:01:45] here today in this service. Amen.
[2:01:48] So, Father, what we want is your
[2:01:52] will. And I know when we pray it that
[2:01:55] way with sincerity, we know there's an
[2:01:57] element of the will of God that is
[2:01:58] frightening for us as mortals. Amen.
[2:02:01] Probably not a Christian here today that
[2:02:02] hasn't been saved very long that has
[2:02:05] dealt with the frightening will of God
[2:02:08] at times. Oh, there's times the will of
[2:02:11] God can be so joyful and so
[2:02:15] wonderful. But there's also an element
[2:02:17] of the will of God that can be fearful
[2:02:19] and frightful and we don't see it and
[2:02:22] don't understand it.
[2:02:25] So today, like Paul, we pray for grace.
[2:02:29] If you and your wisdom have allowed us
[2:02:31] to go through certain things, Lord, and
[2:02:33] you're not going to remove it, but
[2:02:36] you're going to give us
[2:02:38] grace, then I pray for myself. I pray
[2:02:41] for these people today. Oh God, give us
[2:02:44] that grace that we need to bear.
[2:02:47] Lord, help us that we we're not
[2:02:50] Christian grumblers and Christian
[2:02:53] complainers and we're just constantly
[2:02:56] fussing and just arguing against the
[2:02:58] will of God and complain over this and
[2:03:01] that and the other. We need help today,
[2:03:04] Lord, to that place that Paul did where
[2:03:07] he could glory in his
[2:03:10] infirmities. But we see why he could do
[2:03:13] it.
[2:03:14] You gave to him a knowledge of the will
[2:03:17] of
[2:03:19] God. His eyes still festered
[2:03:22] up. Who knows what? He used the modern
[2:03:25] remedies of the day. And no doubt
[2:03:27] everybody in the brother had a cure for
[2:03:29] him. They'd bring this oil and this herb
[2:03:31] and eat this three times a day and shake
[2:03:34] this and twist that and do this and that
[2:03:37] and the other. Paul no doubt would be
[2:03:39] courteous to him. but he'd already
[2:03:42] received a word from you. My grace is
[2:03:47] sufficient, oh
[2:03:49] Jesus. I know this sermon today has not
[2:03:52] been deep and profound and marvelous and
[2:03:54] all that sort of thing, but I believe if
[2:03:57] we can get it, it will change our lives
[2:04:02] from this day
[2:04:04] forward. And we will never be the same
[2:04:07] people as we were prior to today.
[2:04:12] We worship you, Father.
[2:04:15] Come, Lord
[2:04:18] Jesus. No doubt there sons and daughters
[2:04:21] that's praying today about your will,
[2:04:23] about this, and about
[2:04:25] that. Help us,
[2:04:28] Father. Give us your will, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:33] If it be thy will, Lord, for me to go
[2:04:36] across the
[2:04:38] sea, help me to be
[2:04:41] willing to say
[2:04:43] yes, Lord. You know, the older I get, I
[2:04:47] don't want to go
[2:04:48] nowhere. I certainly don't want to fly
[2:04:50] across the
[2:04:51] ocean. I'd rather just stay here and
[2:04:54] preach to my church and enjoy my my
[2:04:56] children, my grandchildren, enjoy my
[2:04:59] church people.
[2:05:02] But Father, help me to be willing to do
[2:05:04] what you want me to
[2:05:05] do. Help every young man, every young
[2:05:08] woman when they're picking their
[2:05:10] vocation in life and trying to find your
[2:05:14] will. Help them to be willing to say
[2:05:17] yes. Every man, woman, boy, or girl
[2:05:21] that's here, those that are streaming
[2:05:22] the
[2:05:23] service, help us, Lord
[2:05:25] Jesus. Can we raise our hands together?
[2:05:31] How many is that what you want today
[2:05:32] with all of your
[2:05:34] heart? Maybe some of your parents, some
[2:05:36] of your
[2:05:38] grandparents, no matter your age, but
[2:05:40] still the will of God for the rest of
[2:05:42] your life is such an important
[2:05:47] thing. Sing it for us,
[2:05:50] Harry. Let's just open our hearts now to
[2:05:52] the Lord. Lord, I need knowledge of your
[2:05:56] will
[2:05:57] today. Should I go here? Should I go
[2:05:59] there? Should I do this? Should I do
[2:06:02] that? Help me, Lord, to be willing to
[2:06:06] say
[2:06:08] yes. Oh
[2:06:12] Jesus, use
[2:06:15] me. Oh Lord,
[2:06:19] don't refuse me.
[2:06:23] For
[2:06:24] surely there's a work that
[2:06:29] I can
[2:06:34] do.
[2:06:35] Hallelujah. And even
[2:06:39] though it's
[2:06:42] humble, master, help my
[2:06:46] will to crumble.
[2:06:51] Oh, the cost be great at our
[2:06:56] world. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[2:07:00] Jesus. I'll stand for thee, Jesus. I'll
[2:07:04] stand for thee, dear
[2:07:09] Jesus. Oh, death may
[2:07:13] come my way.
[2:07:17] I'll spread the
[2:07:19] gospel
[2:07:21] to the
[2:07:23] fallen
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:29] here. And if it be thy will,
[2:07:36] Lord, to go
[2:07:39] across the sea.
[2:07:44] Lord, help me to be
[2:07:48] willing
[2:07:50] to say
[2:07:55] yes.
[2:07:57] Oh
[2:08:00] Jesus, use
[2:08:03] me. And
[2:08:06] oh, don't refuse
[2:08:11] me.
[2:08:12] Surely
[2:08:14] there's a work that I can
[2:08:23] do. Oh, and even though it's
[2:08:30] humble, Lord, help my will to
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:38] crumble.
[2:08:39] Though the cost be
[2:08:43] great, I work for
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:50] you.
[2:08:52] Oh
[2:08:55] Jesus, use
[2:08:58] me. And
[2:09:00] oh,
[2:09:02] don't refuse me.
[2:09:06] For
[2:09:07] surely there's a work that I can
[2:09:17] do. Oh, and even though it's
[2:09:25] humble, Lord, help my will to crumble.
[2:09:34] Although the cost be great, I'll work
[2:09:40] for
[2:09:46] you. I'll stand for you, dear Jesus.
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:09:53] Though death may come my
[2:09:59] way, I will spread the
[2:10:03] gospel to the
[2:10:07] fallen here.
[2:10:14] And if it be thy will,
[2:10:20] Lord, go across all the sea.
[2:10:27] Lord, help me
[2:10:30] to be
[2:10:32] willing
[2:10:33] to say
[2:10:39] it.
[2:10:40] Oh
[2:10:44] Jesus, use
[2:10:46] me. And oh Lord,
[2:10:50] don't refuse me.
[2:10:54] Oh,
[2:10:55] surely
[2:10:57] there's a world that I
[2:11:02] [Music]
[2:11:06] can and
[2:11:09] even though it's
[2:11:13] humble, Lord help my will to crumble.
[2:11:20] [Music]
[2:11:22] Oh, though the cost
[2:11:26] degrade our work for
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:36] you. And where he
[2:11:41] leads me,
[2:11:45] I will
[2:11:51] follow. Lord, where you
[2:11:56] lead
[2:11:58] me,
[2:12:01] I will follow.
[2:12:07] Where you
[2:12:11] lead me,
[2:12:14] I will
[2:12:17] [Laughter]
[2:12:20] follow.
[2:12:21] I go with
[2:12:26] him. With him.
[2:12:29] [Music]
[2:12:34] all the
[2:12:38] way. I can
[2:12:42] hear my
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:47] Savior calling.
[2:12:51] [Music]
[2:12:52] I can
[2:12:55] hear my
[2:13:01] savior
[2:13:02] calling. Lord, thank you Lord God. I can
[2:13:09] hear my
[2:13:13] savior calling.
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:20] Take
[2:13:21] thy cross
[2:13:25] and
[2:13:29] follow.
[2:13:33] Follow
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:41] me. And I
[2:13:44] want what you
[2:13:47] want for
[2:13:51] me, dear Lord.
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:57] Whatever,
[2:14:01] wherever
[2:14:03] it may
[2:14:06] [Music]
[2:14:10] lead. Cuz I
[2:14:13] know that you
[2:14:16] know what's
[2:14:19] best, my love.
[2:14:23] And I
[2:14:25] want what you
[2:14:28] want for
[2:14:32] me. Hallelujah.
[2:14:35] Oh, I
[2:14:37] want what you
[2:14:40] want for me.
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:48] The
[2:14:49] course may
[2:14:52] lead through
[2:14:56] storm
[2:14:58] weather or the
[2:15:01] place is
[2:15:04] near and far.
[2:15:10] Oh, when the
[2:15:13] times may
[2:15:16] bring me
[2:15:20] sun
[2:15:22] days on
[2:15:25] close or
[2:15:29] distance
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:34] shore, but I
[2:15:37] want what you
[2:15:40] want for
[2:15:43] me. Hallelujah. Dear
[2:15:46] Lord,
[2:15:49] whatever,
[2:15:52] wherever
[2:15:54] it may
[2:16:00] be. Cuz I
[2:16:03] know that you
[2:16:06] know what's
[2:16:10] best, my
[2:16:13] Lord. And I
[2:16:15] want what you
[2:16:19] want for me.
[2:16:25] Oh, I
[2:16:27] want what you
[2:16:30] want for
[2:16:37] me. His strength is
[2:16:43] perfect when our
[2:16:46] strength is gone. Oh, let's sing this
[2:16:50] together
[2:16:52] now. He will carry carry
[2:16:56] us
[2:16:58] where we
[2:17:00] can
[2:17:02] carry
[2:17:06] on. Yes, Lord. Praise him. Praise in his
[2:17:11] power. Further
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:15] away he becomes
[2:17:22] strong. His strength is
[2:17:30] perfect. His strength is
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:36] perfect. Look at it. Oh, think about the
[2:17:39] words now. I can do. I can do all
[2:17:44] things.
[2:17:46] Yes, Lord Jesus. Through Christ. Through
[2:17:49] Christ who gives me strength.
[2:17:55] But sometimes I wonder what
[2:17:59] he can do through me.
[2:18:05] Lord
[2:18:07] Jesus. Yes.
[2:18:10] No great
[2:18:12] success to
[2:18:16] show, no
[2:18:18] glory of my
[2:18:22] own. Yet in my
[2:18:25] wings, he is
[2:18:29] there to let me.
[2:18:32] I
[2:18:33] know. I
[2:18:36] know. His strength is
[2:18:41] perfect when our
[2:18:45] strength is
[2:18:47] gone.
[2:18:50] Hallelujah. He will carry
[2:18:54] us when we
[2:18:58] can carry on.
[2:19:05] raised in his
[2:19:11] power. The
[2:19:13] weak may become so
[2:19:19] strong. His strength is
[2:19:26] perfect. His strength is perfect.
[2:19:31] [Music]
[2:19:37] Hallelujah. Would you do me a favor?
[2:19:39] Would you just lay your hand over on the
[2:19:41] person standing by you and we're going
[2:19:42] to offer a word of prayer. Those of you
[2:19:45] that are streaming, would you do
[2:19:47] likewise in your homeless?
[2:19:50] Lord Jesus, we have a feeling for our
[2:19:53] brothers and sisters here
[2:19:55] today. No telling what they're going
[2:19:57] through, what they're dealing with, Lord
[2:19:59] Jesus. And we don't want to leave this
[2:20:01] place today without doing everything
[2:20:03] that we can to try to minister one to
[2:20:07] the other. So Lord, we believe that is
[2:20:10] as believers that we have the presence
[2:20:13] of God living in us. So now we have our
[2:20:16] hands one upon the other. We pray for
[2:20:19] that brother, that sister, that child,
[2:20:21] that elder that we have our hand on. If
[2:20:24] they need healing, bring it, Lord. if
[2:20:27] they need encouragement, strength, maybe
[2:20:30] they need a little bit of that divine
[2:20:32] Holy Ghost knowledge from the will of
[2:20:34] God about their life. Maybe some have
[2:20:37] great questions in their life and it's
[2:20:39] stumbling them right now and they don't
[2:20:41] know what to do. May you reveal to them
[2:20:45] your will,
[2:20:46] Lord. And if you say deliverance, we'll
[2:20:49] say amen. If you say grace, we'll still
[2:20:53] say amen because you know what's best,
[2:20:57] Lord.
[2:20:59] Would you minister to your children now,
[2:21:01] Father,
[2:21:02] in the name of Jesus Christ?
[2:21:05] And the saints said, "Amen." Praise be
[2:21:08] to God. Oh, can we give the Lord Jesus a
[2:21:12] great hand clap for
[2:21:17] praise? We worship you, Lord. We bless
[2:21:20] your
[2:21:22] name.
[2:21:23] Hallelujah. We've got a little brother
[2:21:25] that's been asking his mother and father
[2:21:27] about being
[2:21:29] baptized and going to ask if they'll
[2:21:32] bring him up now. We'll go up and bapt
[2:21:33] baptize him. And uh Lord willing, Carol
[2:21:36] and I'll be leaving Tuesday around noon
[2:21:38] or so, something like that. Uh flying to
[2:21:41] Switzerland. The meetings will start
[2:21:42] there on Friday. uh be Friday evening,
[2:21:46] two on Saturday, two on Sunday, one on
[2:21:48] Monday, and then u we'll be coming back
[2:21:51] Lord running on Tuesday. So, brother Tom
[2:21:54] Ray will be there ministering, brother
[2:21:56] Wayne Lawson and myself. So, we
[2:21:58] certainly desire your prayers. It's kind
[2:22:01] of a unique situation there because
[2:22:02] there'd be people there from Europe and
[2:22:05] Africa and all different places. So, you
[2:22:06] have an interpreter on the platform,
[2:22:08] then you have about five or six in a
[2:22:10] little room kind of off to the side back
[2:22:12] there with headphones on. So pray for
[2:22:14] them as well cuz it's live streaming and
[2:22:16] they're recording it. Uh brother David
[2:22:18] told me the other day wanted to talk to
[2:22:19] me that uh for the first time since
[2:22:21] they've been having these meetings
[2:22:22] they'll have an Arabic interpreter
[2:22:25] because the message is reaching u
[2:22:28] different previous Muslims.
[2:22:33] [Applause]
[2:22:41] So between you and I, they come from
[2:22:43] following a false prophet to following a
[2:22:45] true one. That's right.
[2:22:48] So pray for us, would you?
[2:22:51] Don't ever forget this. I love you all
[2:22:53] my heart. Yes, sir. Love you. Pray for
[2:22:56] us. We'll see you, Lord, whenever
[2:22:57] whenever we get back.
[2:23:00] Amen. Thank you.
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:13] I'm nothing without you. Is that
[2:23:19] deep? Well, take these
[2:23:23] hands and build them
[2:23:27] up. For I have not the strength to
[2:23:31] praise you near enough.
[2:23:35] See, I have
[2:23:38] nothing. I have
[2:23:43] nothing without
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:49] you. And take my
[2:23:54] voice and pour it
[2:23:58] out. Let it sing the songs of mercy I
[2:24:03] have found.
[2:24:06] For I have
[2:24:09] nothing. I have
[2:24:13] nothing without you.
[2:24:17] [Music]
[2:24:20] And all my
[2:24:25] soul
[2:24:27] needs is all your
[2:24:31] love to cover me. So all the
[2:24:40] world
[2:24:42] see that I have
[2:24:47] nothing without you.
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:54] and take my
[2:24:58] body and build it
[2:25:02] up. May it be broken as an offering of
[2:25:07] love.
[2:25:10] For I am
[2:25:13] nothing. I am
[2:25:17] nothing without
[2:25:23] you. And all my
[2:25:29] soul
[2:25:31] needs is all your
[2:25:36] love to cover me. So all the
[2:25:44] world will
[2:25:46] see and I have
[2:25:49] [Music]
[2:25:51] nothing without
[2:25:57] you. Turn right around. There you go.
[2:26:01] See him right there. You okay?
[2:26:06] What a great privilege it is.
[2:26:09] This has been going on for over 2,000
[2:26:13] years. People stepping into water,
[2:26:16] ponds, lakes,
[2:26:19] baptistries, water, and all different
[2:26:22] conditions and all different colors to
[2:26:24] take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:26:27] Christ. It always does my heart good
[2:26:29] whenever I see our children, something
[2:26:32] dealing with them. I love it when
[2:26:34] something deals with them. Don't you?
[2:26:36] the presence of God. Heavenly Father's
[2:26:39] my little brother. Been talking to his
[2:26:42] mom and dad. Wanted to be baptized. It's
[2:26:46] a big step for a little 11year-old boy.
[2:26:49] I remember, Lord, I wasn't much bigger
[2:26:51] than this whenever I gave my heart to
[2:26:54] you. Sad to say, I was baptized in
[2:26:57] titles. It was many years later before
[2:27:00] he ever revealed to me the truth of your
[2:27:03] name. What a privilege my little brother
[2:27:05] has today to be able to be baptized the
[2:27:09] same way they were in the book of Acts.
[2:27:11] Lord, I can baptize him in water, but
[2:27:13] only you can fill his soul with the Holy
[2:27:16] Ghost. This is the commandment of your
[2:27:18] word, the prescription that was given to
[2:27:20] us. I pray, heavenly father, as I
[2:27:23] baptize him, may you take him into your
[2:27:25] great being and envelop him in your
[2:27:27] presence. Father, fill every fiber of
[2:27:30] his being with the Holy Ghost. keep him
[2:27:32] faithful and true. I pray in Jesus
[2:27:36] name. Amen. My little brother, in
[2:27:40] obedience to God's word and your
[2:27:42] profession of faith, I baptize you in
[2:27:44] the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:27:56] Christ. Amen. Let's just sing this as we
[2:27:59] go this morning. will take my
[2:28:04] time here on
[2:28:08] earth. Let it
[2:28:11] glorify all that you are
[2:28:15] worth. For I am
[2:28:19] nothing. I am
[2:28:23] nothing without you.
[2:28:28] [Music]
[2:28:30] And all my
[2:28:35] soul
[2:28:37] needs is all your
[2:28:41] love to cover me. So all the
[2:28:49] world will
[2:28:52] see that I have
[2:28:57] nothing without you. And all my
[2:29:05] soul
[2:29:07] needs is all your
[2:29:11] love to cover me. Peace. So all the
[2:29:20] world
[2:29:22] see that
[2:29:24] I am
[2:29:27] nothing without you.
[2:29:31] Take my
[2:29:34] time here on
[2:29:38] earth and let it
[2:29:41] glorify all that you are
[2:29:45] worth. For I am
[2:29:49] nothing. I am
[2:29:53] nothing without you.
[2:30:00] And all my
[2:30:05] soul
[2:30:07] needs is all your
[2:30:11] love to cover me. So all the
[2:30:20] world will
[2:30:22] see that I have
[2:30:27] nothing without you.
[2:30:31] And all my
[2:30:35] soul
[2:30:37] needs is all your
[2:30:42] love to cover me. to all the
[2:30:50] world.
[2:30:52] See that I have
[2:30:57] nothing without
[2:30:59] you and all my
