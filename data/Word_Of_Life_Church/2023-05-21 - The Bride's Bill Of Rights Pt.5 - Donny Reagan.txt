blessing and the whole wide world will see [Applause] his ways are wonderful we don't always understand them we don't always contemplate why he's doing what he's done and when he does what he does we've learned to trust him that way and know that he makes absolutely no mistakes and did a wonderful privilege for us to be able to be gathered together here today in the house of the Lord and to be able to come and worship and receive and not only get from him but give back to him many people have it one-sided when they come to church well I need this and I need that and I need something else well you figure he needs today I think he needs to hear from us that we love him so much and we're trusting him and we're longing for the day when we're going to be changed and I want him to be a part of this service not only just giving but being able to receive yeah God bless you if I get this crazy I appeared to work boy it's going to be one of them kind of services I can see already look out devil God bless you and we are here it was working perfectly fine before I came out yeah it's okay Matthew chapter 7. verse 7 and 8. hmm get me that other one I reckon I'm going to start carrying three of them yeah whatever that's right we do whatever we need to do don't we Matthew chapter 7. verse 7. all right this is the words of the Lord Jesus now thank you ask and it shall be given unto you so I asked for another app iPad and I got one ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asks us not everyone that asks one time and that was it but ask us you're just continuing to ask for everyone that asks us receiveth he that seeketh not salt one time in past tense but he that seeketh findeth and to him that Marcus which is continually Lord I need this amen sometimes you ought to keep right on knocking sometimes you might have to knock a few Devils on the head while you're knocking but you just keep on knocking right because we're persistent he that notice to him that asketh everyone that asketh receiveth he that seeketh findeth to him that knock us it shall be opened I love the way that Jesus said this and remember this was an Aramaic whenever he said it and the words was that to him that is constant at the throne of grace who continues knocking at the door of Mercy will have no denial will have no denial but it shall be opened to him and you'll have entrance into the holiest of holies know this again in Matthew chapter 17 verse 20. and remember these aren't my words now these aren't the words of some man but exit the words of the Lord Jesus himself to his people Jesus said unto them we read this Wednesday night because of your unbelief will really I say unto you remember they couldn't cast out the devil and that asked the Lord Jesus why so he answers them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as of a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hints to Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you I guess the question is this do we actually believe this is true you actually believe it's the truth or would we say well I've tried that and it didn't work well I know another person who tried it and didn't work that has nothing to do with his word his word is always right John chapter 16 verse 24. hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full how many knows what that's like to experience it whenever God answers a prayer and it just it just does something to you I mean a lot to be remembered today as we pray and approach the word Heavenly Father we love you so much we're so grateful Lord for the opportunity that we can be gathered together today Lord Jesus we thank you your God we bring before you our needs our desires our petitions but that's only part of the reason that we're here today we're here to minister to you because you are our husband Our Redeemer Our Savior you have done so much for us if you never answered one more prayer we have enough to thank you for for eternity but we believe you're going to keep right on answering and get right on moving because as we go on our needs seem like they become greater and greater and the things we Face become greater but we believe your power is greater than anything we'll ever face speak to us today help me Lord to be able to get out of the way I need you so much help me Lord Jesus I pray it's in the name of the word we ask it amen God bless you you may be seated again I'd like to speak to you today on the brides Bill of Rights as I look around this darkened world that we're in every day you see pain stress anxiety sin sickness evil rottenness of the world corruption you see people that are so Bound by things of the world and they live their life from day to day and just simply try to exist until they get to a spot to where they think it just ain't worth living anymore and they take their life or they go out and take the lives of others and then have their lives taken by police officers which is such a sad thing to end your life in such a way and go out of this world into the presence of God lost and yet on the other hand I look at people that are Christians people that love God people that serve him go to church live right do things that are right pay their tithes have a faithful attendance to a church somewhere they love the Lord Jesus they clap they clap their hands and singing's going on they actually sing and then they just participate in worship and yet some of those are just as bound in their own way with either sins or shortcomings and when I look into the word is what the Lord has provided for us as his people I don't mind telling you it breaks my heart because if all he would have done would have purchased salvation for us and said now from this point on I won't heal you I won't deliver you I won't give you anything else but I just give you a one-way ticket and then don't ask me for anything else that would in itself would be enough to be thankful for would it not but when we look at the full coverage of benefits that he said in his word of what he wants us to have and then we see so many people that fall so short of what God wants them to have I wonder how it makes him feel as I look at it as just a mere mortal man like the rest of you humans are and if it breaks my heart seeing people fall short of what God intended for them to have I wonder how much more it makes him as if though he only made a way for us to be saved and basically live the rest of our life with some Sadness and Sorrow and such heavy burdens as if though he paid no price for that we act sometimes as if though Our God has no promise of Joy he has no promise of overcoming and of Deliverance and yet it is one of our our rights as the people of God to be able to to overcome I may believe that so the Lord doesn't just want us to survive I don't want to be a Survivor no I I just I just don't want to be a Survivor I want to be an overcomer I want to be a conqueror praise the Lord not only do I want to be I am now I hope there's more of you and I believe there are setting here with me today and you could raise your hand and say I am too by God's grace but yet there may be people here this morning and maybe some of you that are overcoming in certain capacities of your life and yet you're defeated in other capacities of your life to me to be a Christian and to live a defeated life it's so sad I deal with some all the time and my Journeys around this world praying for people even counseling with pastors and with preachers and ministers and hearing the things that preachers themselves will deal with and hearing that preachers sometimes themselves live less than a Victorious Life it's a sad scenario especially when we think that our God purchased the full benefit look friend we don't just have liability we've got full coverage he didn't just say okay you're saved and then that's the end of it we've got full coverage as a matter of fact David said he Lotus me daily with his benefits I think that uncovered everything that we will ever need from the day we get saved to the day we leave this world but yet how is it then that so many are able to be a Christian and have a walk with the Lord today brother Donnie yes they have a walk with the Lord and they love the Lord and he loves them and yet they're living here when he wants them to be up here and I forget living where maybe some great man of God some Prophet like our prophet of the age none of us will never live they will never have the Walkers God he had were not ordained to I don't want that myself I want what God ordained for me to have that's my personal possession maybe some of you will have something with God I could only dream about well I'm not going to be jealous because you do I just want to have what's got my name on it that's what I want for me and if it is mine I don't understand why that I shouldn't have it what about you and I believe according to the word that overcoming is one of those rights that God has given to us and yet it is something we will have to fight for every day of our life now when I mention overcome maybe in your mind you'll go here there and there you'll think of certain people well I know brother so-and-so you know he's dating with maybe smoking or so-and-so's dealing with uh they have a problem with drinking or they're having a problem with this or that or the other it's not just always that some of the greatest things that I've found that people can deal with and they need to overcome it's things that are hidden so deep within themselves hardly nobody else even knows they fight it but yet they find it nonetheless it can be interferes that are so interwoven in their spirit in things that happen to them whenever they were children it can be trauma that was induced to them by someone else and they didn't even do anything themselves to cause it and can be so heavy inside out of them and they're afraid to let anyone even know anything about it and yet they deal with it day by day or week by week you know I don't believe the Lord Jesus wants us to deal with such nonsense I believe he's sure today to set us free from such if we will allow it now overcoming is a great thing it can be a temper it can be anger it can be resentment either toward someone you love someone you go to church with or what's even worse resentment toward God you see many people and God will take a loved one or God won't hear a prayer the way they prayed him and the way they thought God should answer they will start with a little bit of an attitude and it will build and build over time until it becomes such a resentment toward God that quit praying they quit talking to him they quit going to his house and the next thing you know they've got a real issue and if they let it go far enough they'll eventually backslide and turn so against God they will hate him with such a degree the same degree that they loved him before because they never overcome that resentment and it's not just that it can be toward God but it can be toward people I dare say there's not a person here today that has not been hurt let down used abused betrayed whatever words we want to use to describe that we have all been affected by other people how many have we we've been let down we've been disappointed sometimes it can be family members it can be close friends it can be a preacher it can be whoever a deacon a trustee whoever that we have respect for and Satan will try his best to turn that inward on you you see Paul use the word when he defined it well about bitterness and Paul described this bitterness not as a tree not as a plant but he described it as a root so the Bible then identifies this as a root of bitterness and where does the root grow a root grows deep within the Earth it can be there for years and years nobody ever even know it's there but the person who has it and then all of a sudden it'll begin to shoot up out of the ground though it's been in their heart for a long long time bitterness against a husband bitterness against a wife and truly when we are hurt deep it takes the spirit of God to help us but let me just give you a warning if you do not let the spirit of God help you deal with bitterness and be able to get an attitude out of your heart it will zap your Victory before God but brother Donnie you don't know how deep I probably don't and you don't know how deep I've been hurt either if I could lay my heart before you here today it's not like you'd see great volumes of love and great volumes of the miraculous probably what you'd see more than anything would be the scars the pain all that I've been through as a Christian and I don't stand you're alone if I could see your heart I probably wouldn't say great renowning miraculous things I will no doubt see disappointments and hurts maybe in a wife maybe in a husband one that you trusted so much and yet you were so let down but it's up to you and I with what we do with that resentment we can let it control us or we can be honest with God and say God this thing is bigger than me and if you don't help me I can see already it's going to destroy me but I do not want to destroyed destroyed by this devil I want it under my feet is anybody listening to me this morning now you may sit there today and you might smell a brother and you get around him and you know he's got a problem with smoking that don't take much discernment does it it don't take much discernment if you see a little color between his fingers or a little Amber or still running out of his mouth or his Aqua Velva did not quite hide the cigarette smoke you know that person it's easy to see they have a problem maybe someone who gets real wrong and they lose their temper and they I say things they shouldn't say it's really easy for us to see that individual but sometimes it's the one that Harbors that root of bitterness that is so deep and resentment that is so deep no one knows it at the church nobody even knows it but their family does the wife does the husband does their closest intimate friends and yet when they are by themselves or with someone they think they can trust they get so angry and they will pound and they will Express such resentment yet if I would walk up they would squelch that resentment and bury it again deep Beneath The Human Side but you can only hide that for so long and to me many times those people are in worse shape than the man who's smoking cause he knows pretty much everybody knows but he keeps coming to church and if you're here today and you have a problem of smoking hey keep on coming back right here's where you can get Deliverance of that Oh you mean you want me to come absolutely I want you to come I figure your chances of getting delivered are way better of here than you are sitting at the house I figure whatever you're dealing with today your chances of getting touched by the presence of God and delivered a much greater being setting here that you are well I ain't going to go till I get everything took care of and let me know how that works for you I don't mind telling you I want this place to be like an ER I want this church to be like a hospital we want the lame the blind the halt the the smoking the marijuana the addicts whatever they are we want them to be able to come here and get set free this is not a place for only The Godly and only the holy well when you get good enough you can come to our church no when yours low down this rotten scumbag of the earth that's the kind we want to specialized in writing you to the Lord Jesus and being able to cast that spirit away from you and watch him take drugs out of your life and alcohol out of your life and bitterness out of your life and resentment out of your life and fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say our master place it in the bride's Bill of Rights the right to overcome he said these words in Saint John 16 33. these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation and everybody said amen but be of good cheer I have overcome the world now what I find amazing about this is he hasn't even died he has not went to the cross he has not been whipped he's not went to Hades and took the keys away from the Devil but he says I have already overcome now do you understand who's saying this it's not just the sonship of God but it's God himself the sonship the humanity is dreading the cross it is dreading the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews it was heard in that he feared now I want you to catch this as he says it be of good cheer I have overcome now I'm not going to but I have overcome the world so not only did he go before us but he did it for us not only before us but for us so when we're looking at something that seems like it's absolutely unsurmountable it is so great how can I ever survive this one I've been through a lot of things you might say but how in the world will I ever survive this one my word to you today is be of good cheer he has overcome the world now notice this he tells us this and John remember the same man who wrote this in chapter 16 verse 33 also wrote to us again in first John chapter 5 verse 4 and 5 and told us that we also would be Overcomers notice he says I have overcome the world so the Serene confidence and assurance that our lord Jesus has in what he's fixing to face calmly calmly with Serenity and Assurance as God as God I'll tell you we fight too many of our battles as a human when most of the time we need to fight them as deity we will get defeated by fighting our battles as human beings because Satan will scare us to death by using our reasoning he will use this person's word in that person's word and a doctor's report and whatever more and the News you listen to every day there ain't hardly nothing anymore on the news it's even encouraging are they you can't hardly go to anywhere any news station or whatever app you have on your phone it's all bad it's all discouraging it's all disheartening but let me tell you there is the greatest news that's ever been in the earth and that is the Gospel of Jesus Christ because the word gospel means the good news amen notice so he's looking at deaths in the face he's looking at suffering like no human being has ever suffered he's looking at the spirit of God the Father to leave him in the Garden of Gethsemane he's looking to be turned into a goat not a sheep a goat he's looking to be cursed in the eyes of God he's looking to be rejected by God and yet he says be of good cheer I've overcome the world only God could behave such Behavior no other way immortal could face such things and still say be of good cheer I hope somebody's going to hear me this morning this is the way I think we should fight our battles that we don't just fight them as mere mortals but we look at them as who we are Sons and Daughters of God and say it's bigger than me it's bigger than my family it's bigger than her church it's bigger than all of all of us put together but it ain't bigger than our God for greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world be all good cheer I have overcome the world [Applause] notice in Romans chapter 12 verse 21 that Paul says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good you see the Lord is not telling us to turn the other Chief and pray for them that despitefully use and all those blessed scriptures just in order to make us look like something that we're not but here is the key to overcoming evil you actually overcome it with good so if someone says something bad about you you don't overcome it by saying three times as much bad about them as a matter of fact the evil just took your Victory how do we overcome evil we actually overcome evil with good first John 2 13 I rather unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I I love the way John categorically brings it breaks this up in speaking to them I know a lot of people say well we shouldn't have youth services and we shouldn't just specify certain things to the youth you need to re-read your Bible because as a matter of fact they did just that notice I write unto you young men now why not just say it to everybody in general why would John specifically say I write unto you fathers which no doubt would have been older men because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have ye have overcome the wicked one now here John wanted this to be noted in the New Testament so that it would be an encouragement not only to the young men of that day but to the young men in the days of the church ages and I trust here today that some of our young Brothers can say if God helped them people and they were having their heads cut off they were having their bodies burned at Stakes they were being reviled and persecuted fed to the Lions brought before the Roman citizens and the Colosseum and I stood there many years ago went to the catacombs in Rome and see where the saints of God gathered together for church and think John was writing this around 93 94 A.D so during this time was when the persecution was going on and John wasn't just writing to old people because that Apostolic he feeds in church didn't have people 75 and above it had young men filled with the Holy Ghost it had young sisters filled with the Holy Ghost and John wants to acknowledge them notice he said I write unto you little children because ye have known the father I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because ye are strong that's the kind of young man we want in our church is it not I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one may I say to our young Brothers here today whether you are single or maybe you're a young man that is married you can take hope looking at your brothers which have lived before you but Brother Don who they didn't face what I did that's exactly right and you don't face what they did either we were able to come here today drive up in our vehicle and come to have church if you want to come back later and fellowship in the fellowship hall you can do so if we want to come tomorrow and the next day and the next day so far we still have our rights to be able to do it but can you imagine them every time they gather together under the emperor oh my that they would put out and edict anybody gathering in the name of Jesus they can be arrested and there was young men who risked their lives to go to the catacombs and say the devil will not keep me out of church I wonder if the state of Tennessee would pass such a law it is against the law to go to church to Word of Life Church I wonder how many of you sitting here today would be here well I'll raise my hand as the first one I will I will I will anybody else be with me why because we are of the same caliber of people amen they could not shut them up in the first stage they cannot shut them up in our age because we are the same caliber we are Overcomers oh my notice John goes on to say in verse chapter 4 verse 4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world when I also face facts there will be things that we will face and it will be even greater than what our human ability you may be a scholar of the message you might be a theologian of the message and when a preacher goes to start quoting a quote you can finish it for him and you might quote it more accurate than he does for God but yet at the same time you will not overcome just by your knowledge of quoting scripture John never said your Overcomers because you memorize what I wrote and you memorize what Matthew wrote but he said you are an overcomer because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world we want our church to study the word read the word write listen to tapes hear the preaching of the word but the main aspect I want you to have today is to get the Overcomer inside of you and when the Overcomer lives inside of you he will feed on the word he will Empower you he will overcome using your own body because the Lord Jesus is an overcomer whether he's in his body or your body or your body or my body he is an overcomer I love this in first John 5 4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world I want you to notice he doesn't say maybe I'm praying they will perhaps they will but they do who whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world look at this word nikhail which means conquer Prevail get the victory to carry off the victory oh I love them days don't you I love it when you grab a hold of that victim you just carry it off notice this and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our shouting even our emotion our dancing our feeling what victory is it that overcomes the world what faith so when you feel him or whether you don't Faith still says I'm a winner either way now notice who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is not was is the Son of God notice again in Revelation chapter 2 verse 7 coming down to the church ages and God offered each age a reward now we're very fortunate in one aspect you may not consider yourself fortunate to be living in this last day but you are because in every age God gave them a reward now the last stage gets the accumulation of all seven the first age will get a great reward the second and third and fourths on them and now we're living in the last stage and it will be the accumulation of all the rewards of the church ages handed to the Believers in this day now you say oh that's wonderful well what that means is you're fighting seven times more than what they fought in other ages but we're more than able to do it notice he that has an ear Revelation 2 7 let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcome Thomas well I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God now this was the reward promised to the Ephesian age this is also my reward this is your reward now what you notice as it changes them from there and we come to the second Church age to have a different reward so the Ephesian age was not promised the reward of the second Church age notice how divided that it was verse 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says and the church is he that overcome us shall not be hurt of the second death notice how important overcoming is to God you see there will be no one that will go in the Rapture unless they are living an overcoming life friends this is not an option like power lend us on your car this is not an option well do you want an MP3 player or do you not want to do you want this and don't want that no this is absolutely a requirement the Overcomers are the ones that will be crowned and set with the Lord Jesus in order to be bride we have to be Overcomers well what have I got to overcome the greatest thing you will ever overcome is yourself because no brother Donnie it is smoking noise it's this another no it's not smoking no smoking is not a sin smoking marijuana is not a sin drinking is not a sin there's only one sin and that's unbelief and the reason people do the above is because they don't believe what the word says about it so where does it all come look they could you could live around cigarette factors you could live next door to those taverns every way you would turn but if you've got the Overcomer inside of you you can walk right by him and say you curse it think it behind me in the name of Jesus you can walk by him or brought the Lambert whether east west north and south but if you've got the overcoming on the inside there ain't nothing that's going to stop you but if you ain't got an overcomer you might live right down Paradise Avenue where Paradise Avenue intersects hope Pope Avenue and you're living right next door to Peace Valley but if you ain't got the comforter on the inside of you you won't be able able to overcome I know I shouldn't do this I should not do this friends it's going to take more than US sighting up her mental attitude I don't need to do this I don't need to do this it's going to take a power inside the bride in this last day to be able to not only look sickness in the face but look death itself in the face and say death give way give way death you cannot stop us as the people of God we are more than conquerors yeah I know you know this and believe it but I believe with all of my heart there's people sitting right here today that will not die you see we're not just going to look hepatitis in the face cancer in the face or some other sickness but one day you will look death itself right in the face and say I thought you had me didn't you Now You See Me Now you don't let gas itself right in the face hey you can't have me I'm gone I'm out of here what is a headache compared to that what is cancer compared to that what is high blood pressure low blood pressure oh my goodness Lazarus had no blood pressure so if God can take care of the no blood pressure attitude I figure he can take care of a low blood pressure attitude he can take care of high blood low blood no blood because he is the great creator look again in verse 17 he that half a deer let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh well I give to either the hidden Manner and give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man know us notice us now Noah saving he that receive it the accumulation of each Church age now as we come down notice he's not saying to him that shouts to him that runs to him who screams the loudest to him who hollers not even to him that works miracles not even to him that lays hands on the set notice one word one word that God uses the same in every Church age and basis the reward of every Church age on one word one only overcome overcome how many wants to be an overcomer listen how important not to him that raises the dead not to him that works miracles and Jesus said they'll stand before me that day and say I cast out devils in your name he'll say oh I'll say to them depart from me I never even knew you that ain't it friends we believe in that we believe God shouts we believe God anoints people to worship and run and praise God but you and I know my goodness I pray for enough of them and prayer lines all over the world so no they come through and you pray for them and they shout and run jump and fall out and three or four weeks are right back in somebody else's prayer line praying for the same thing that I prayed for them for before why we need more than prayer lines we need more than just getting our emotions all worked up and then coming right back what we want is people that can live Victorious overcoming lives and look the devil in the face and say I'm sick and tired of you stealing my victory I'm sick and tired of you stealing my joy you're stealing my peace with God give it back give it back in the name of Jesus verse 26 he that overcometh and keep us my works wow well what about his words sure you're going to keep his words wonder why I said works who keep us my works we don't want to be all mouths oh I believe this I believe I believe I believe I'll say I'll say I say works must accompany what we believe and everybody said he that keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations again chapter 3 verse 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white Raymond and I will not blott out his name out of the book of life you mean a person could have their name in The Book of Life and get it blotted out this is part of my reward he will not blot out my name oh praise God I don't want to just lay hands on the sick I've done that for decades I've seen Miracles my goodness believe me I've never shared with you one inkling of what I've seen God do but you know one reason I don't talk about it more because I know what stuff does like that to people they want to start following this they think they got to get to this man and that man and something I just read Carol a quote last time where brother Branham says it's not the certain man praying for you it's you within yourself having faith and believing God oh my notice this God's reward to the elect I will confess his name before my father and before his angels to who the shelter the jumper the preacher overcome do you understand there will be countless of preachers that'll have their name removed an angel will stand there and blot out their name now they're they're writing this as if they were doing that day they did not have paper and stuff of course the way we did so they would take part of the ink and blot out they would take a heavy dose of the ink and go over the riding there and blot out that oh what a terrible saying to stand there and your name it was sad when you walked up and now you're standing there and it's gone why it was blotted out oh Lord God but for those that overcome he said I will not blot out your name as a matter of fact I will confess your name can you imagine the Lord Jesus speaking your true word name before this eternal one on the throne and he will turn to the myriads maybe Millions times millions of angels and he will say to them look at my daughter so and so she was an overcomer here is my son whatever your true word name is I want you all to see my son glory to God glory to God Lord children if that's the only reward I got that'd be enough to fight every devil out of hell up with it can you imagine by the nation sat in there and the Lord Jesus confesses our name before the father and tense of those myriads of angels and said what to introduce to you my word son my word daughter how are they here master how did they get here they overcome they lived in that Wicked sinful Dark Age of laodiceem there was a rottenness and Corruption everywhere and that overcome and they stood for me now I'm standing for them and I want all of heaven to know silence photos silence what I speak their name in the Lord Jesus would speak your name my son so and so glory to God give me that brother notice in Revelation 3 12 him that overcometh so I may in the temple of my God a pillar yeah sort of like the two in Solomon's when Solomon erected his Great temple and God gave him the pattern to follow according to what David had saw and there's two big massive pillars as you come into the entrance the whole building held up on these pillars Jesus says to him that overcomes I will make you a pillar in the house of my God and he shall know more go no more out and I will ride upon him the name of my God in the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will ride upon him my new name to what category of people one Overcomers I think by the Paul we take it too lightly to overcome France it well boy that's something it's not just something it's everything you see if we don't overcome all of our running all of our knowledge all of our shouting all of our preaching all of our signs what will that be worse if we don't overcome Revelation 3 21 now here's the promise the seventh promise but remember you get all consecutive of them put together one through seven to him that overcometh all I grant to set with me and my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father and his son Revelation 21 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son what could be greater than that I love this in the church age book and I know you're familiar with it in the layout of sin Church age page 360. now what are we to overcome that is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how you see so much of the time we focus on what uh I've got a pornography problem I've got temper I've got resentment I've got your focusing on what not how if we can ever learn how it won't be no difference what the problem is you'll know how to handle it and some of you can overcome this and that in the other but you keep focusing on the what instead of letting the same principle of the house that lets you overcome all these other 57 things in your life you're letting and you're naming that can't you see the power of naming can't you see the power of naming something the Lord Jesus has your original word name written in heaven but he cannot give that to you now it would not match your existence and time it would not match your body but there you will get your new name due to you not new to him look at the power of naming so he said well my habit my this my that quit naming that devil don't look at what look at how it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome this is the logical for notice it does not matter so much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome in Matthew 4 where in Jesus it's tempted of the devil listen Carefree these words beautiful absolutely beautiful he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only not by the anointing the Bible doesn't mention nothing about Jesus feeling anything he overcome by the word notice now they were so they were so made for him no one else could Satan even use this against them so the prophet I'm so glad that he allowed this to be said this way he overcame the personal Temptation don't you understand why Satan knows us so well it probably scare us to death if we knew how well he knew us and he has your Temptations and tests so personalized he knows you to the T but we know him too we're not ignorant concerning his devices notice this he overcame the person of Temptations of Satan by Satan I'm saying rather by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Edom lust of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell and direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word notice next paragraph and his own personal life these words are astounding to me contending with himself was contending with himself now I want you to think Jesus recognizing that his flesh was now a Target and Satan was trying to pull on his Humanity and Jesus must defeat himself so his Temptations were not well this drinking problem and this woman problem and this he never focused on what but he focused on who and how you mean the Lord Jesus the blameless sinless Son of God yes but remember the prophet makes them astounding statements about that human body and he says even the Flesh of Jesus could not glory in the presence of God oh I know it took some of you Jesus owners but it's time you get choked down you'll never see yourself right if you don't see him right look at him but small their children he had to contend with himself Jesus had to speak to Jesus and say Jesus you've got to obey the word but Jesus said to Jesus I don't want to I don't want to die I don't want to suffer Jesus the deity had to speak to Jesus the humanity and said you're going to obey me I'm here for this reason I'm here for this purpose you're going to the coast I don't want to even prays a prayer that he knew the father would not and could not answer if it be thy will let this cup pass from me I'm so glad father God didn't answer that prayer in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame obedience to the word and Hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayers and supplication was strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death so Jesus mother Joel is crying he's crying and calling calling Spirit God I'm begging please don't let me go through this I you don't make me face this please thank you Oh Glory to God supplications a strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him so the savior his crime for the father to save him from being a sinner no from dying and becoming sin don't make me do it don't make me do it please don't make me do it I beg you but that he was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared can you imagine the Lord Jesus being so afraid brother Jackie Jesus fearing maybe he'd already seen it read the book of Isaiah 53 and many of the other places and he could imagine himself hanging on the cross all my bones they stare at me they laugh at me they put out their lips at me he saw them or he saved himself he can he saved the other let him save himself the Bulls of Bayesian Compass me about Psalms 22 it's proceed your great Shepherd psalm read it you see it was the victory of Psalm 22 that led him to the Sheepfold of Psalm 23. maybe reading in the scripture and imagining in his mind how can a mortal face this I can do it I just can't again I can't face it can you imagine when Satan heard him say it I'm afraid I hope you don't misunderstand me but I'm so glad he allowed himself to feel that how many ever gets afraid in life just get afraid let's get afraid afraid of the unknown sometimes afraid of the known afraid of things that around you not certain house that's going to turn out and how is this going to be you just get afraid but don't forget when you do you could go to High priests and say Jesus I'm so afraid I'm so afraid of today I'm just afraid of today I'm afraid I'm going to fall again I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of that I need a high priest who can understand me you can answer back and say son I know that feeling I understand the feeling of fear let me take you on a journey when I was on The Garden of Gethsemane I was shaking I was trembling I was in such profusion of prayer that the capillaries broke in my in my forehead in my bloodstream entered entered into the sweat glands and I sweated great drops of blood you see it was not just out of thinking of hell it was not of that but I was so afraid of the pain I was afraid of the agony I was afraid of being left alone I was afraid I feared so I understand anybody here have fears besides me but don't you guys got a high priest that we can go to and you say Lord I'm afraid you're afraid why no longer if I get down at that Altar and get saved you ain't got the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost but even though he was deity in that body it did not did not take away the humanity and the fear oh Lord God though he was a son yet learned he obedience of the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word of God now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he's been living that word not just talking about it but living it your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of setting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride that's the stronger the king is shared with the queen because she's United to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that throne I mean it wants to be part of that one can I have a few more minutes Paul says in Romans 8 37 day and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I love this word it means to be more than a conqueror to gain a surpassing Victory literally in the translation it means this we are super conquerors amen super conquered why we're part of a super race we belong to a super sign to a supersede and we're going to a super City divide designed by a super almighty God so we are not just barely conquerors but we are super we are conquerors on spiritual steroids we are super conquerors I want to just say this to you our face is not destroyed our hope is not gone our love is not diminished our sight is not blinded our intuition from the presence of God we are more determined now than ever before because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world we will bear the glory because we bear the shame we will set with us in him and the throne because he can try us now and not treat us like a bunch of babies and you see friends here's the key we conquer when we learn to conquer ourselves Romans 5 2. Paul says by whom oh shall we have access by faith unto this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory not only so but we glory in Tribulation Lord have mercy we Glory and tribulation knowing that tribulation workers patience I didn't put the rest of this down but I quote it for you tribulation workers patience patience experience experience hope hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us we don't just endure tribulation we don't just endure trying but we glory in them why because we know we have found favor in the eyes of God oh my we are so far from being conquered by them they do us much good well brother Donnie always knew you're crazy now I know you've flipped over well I hope that I have I hope I get so far out of my mind that I have the mind of Christ that I'll get to a spot I'll believe what he said if you don't if you don't if you don't it won't make no difference I'm going to take him out his word Hallelujah second Corinthians 2 14. now thanks be unto God which always calls us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place or if you only could catch that listen what this man is saying he calls us always calls us to Triumph in Christ and make us manifest the Savior or the incense the incense of his knowledge by us in every place you see the imagery Paul chose to use you know Paul was a very a very typologist of a guy and he used so many images I love his images because he looked at himself here at the church as a trophy of God's victory and he said what I'm doing and what you brothers and sisters are doing we are the sweet aroma of his victory because he conquered us then he will take us and Conquer others through us praise be to gospel Paul considered himself as a conquered trophy of Christ's Victorious power now remember by this time when he writes second Corinthians he's back in jail again and he goes from one jail to another from one city to another but Paul sees himself as part of the triumphant entry of Christ himself into this city so here Paul would come and say me and Jesus have come to take over praise God now he's quoting the triumphal entry of the Romans Oh Glory to God you see they would lead them about so the Romans would conquer the Greeks the Athenians whoever they would conquer they would get many of the mighty celebrities of the city and then they would take incense and they would run before the Chariots and the incense was the introduction Oh Glory to the Victorious March so here was thousands times thousands of Roman citizens and they're lined up across the streets and they knew today was a triumphal entry because they had took God they had took Britain they had took this and that and the other and they would stand there and they'd smell the aroma and the incense and Paul said can't you all say what I'm doing God's having me thrown in one jail after another and we know when he got down there in Philippi and he got to the mother places God let him be able to lead people to the Lord Jesus you imagine was Paul down there and that one Roman guard according to history Paul LED one Roman god to the Lord Jesus and the man had a new birth about the baptism of the Holy Ghost what did God do God allowed this man to carry the incense of a resurrected life for the Lord Jesus inside there and there was a Roman Heathen about like a Tennessee Heathen or a Kentucky Heathen or an Eleanor Heathen or a Virginia either and the Lord God allowed this man's life such a sweet smelling savior of the Lord Jesus and that Roman said they tell me you're a preacher I've got all kinds of Gods smelling all the time but you smelled it I mean you you act different than my priest still the bride does all glory to God glory to God let me give you a little history one Pompeii triumphed over Africa his Chariot was drawn by elephants when Mark Anthony conquered his Chariot was drawn by lions when Helio gaboulos conquered his chariot was led by tigers when Aurelius had conquered his Chariot was led by deer isn't it amazing all animal nature which seemed unable to conquer but you see by Conquering the elephant can you imagine hooking up elephants to a chariot they could take a big trunk of theirs pick you in the Chariot and the whole thing and throw you however far they wanted to but yet you are showing your conquering Power by having these massive elephants pull you a little 160 or 70 pound man don't you understand why the Lord Jesus is going to allow his people to be a conquering tried people we are his victory Hallelujah it will not be great cherubs that'll lead his Chariot it will not be Mighty archangels that will be the crescendo of his victory it'll be little Housewives it'll be young men that were so Bound by drugs and alcohol Bound by pornography and this and that and the other and they even looked at himself and said I'm totally hopeless I've been in this situation for so long but the Conqueror got a hold to their life and then he'll it hits you and I up by the glory of God and say Lead Me Now oh Hallelujah take my name take my power he don't want you to just do it in heaven he wants it to do in the workplace where you are let the Lord Jesus chain us to his chariot say take me to the masses take me to the Lost not a tiger not a lion not an elephant a man born in sin a woman born in sin Changed by the power of God and Horn into harnessed up to the buggy of the word of God for the end time I told you years ago when I was in South Africa and I'll close to this in Durban but the name you now do which is an Indian brother Durbin has a large large concentration of East Indian people and there were thousands times thousands and thousands of those people there for one of those great Hindu festivals and they would have little small groups maybe eight or ten over here eight or ten over there and eight or ten over there had a little tiny uh timbering type things symbols little tiny things they go to plan them things and going back and forth neighbors dancing and carrying on off us ever was and there's one particular person that's all gathering around telling me what they're doing this man is going to be the man that they're going to hook a buggy to they have 33 million gods and goddesses so they would stand there and they'd dance and dance and dance all of a sudden this guy that they're going to hook him up to he'd let our blood curdling scream brother nammy said he's now ready they would start out with a big long pen like this start weaving it through his tongue poking a hole in his tongue that's sticking out of his mouth that take fish hooks brother Ram talked about it they'd take fish hooks and hang apples and grapefruit and hang them all over his body then they'd take two big long grab Hooks and put right in the back this man's back like this take his skin and put it up and feed this hook through his back and then run ropes to the back of this man and him pulling this Carriage representing this deity I saw some of them the weight of that carriage and it would tear a hole Plum out in their skin leave a big old place blood running down their bodies for what false gods idolatry but who was the best representation of them so-called deities their constituents who's the best representation of a conquer of an overcomer the day we're living here it may not always be a man it may be a woman it may be a little daughter of God that's attacked by this or that or the other and yet the Lord God uses hers we look the other night at Tabitha and what a life little Tabitha dork has had God hooked her up to his buddy to display himself oh friends forget about well if I can be this person give me that big buggy give me what difference does it make what size it is my goodness if I ain't got enough trust in the Lord and if I ain't got enough reputation that he has to tie me up to a little red flower wagon y'all know what them are don't you man they're antique now a little video guys about that big if that's all he can tie me up to all buried I'll pull it I'll pull it with all my strength I'm in the same parade as the big guys I'm in the same parade of the Mighty Warriors who's pulling tons and tons and tons and they say look at poor little brother Donnie he just got that little Radio Flyer wagon that's all right Jesus matched me up to that wagon I'll pull it with all my might about it Hallelujah Lord Jesus to him that overcome us what about it man women boys girls your temper bitterness sexual sins whatever it is it's not what that's how how do I overcome by the word he said but brother Donnie the Lord Jesus wasn't tempted by marijuana I know that he wasn't tempted by pornography I know that but there's only three ways a human being can be tempted that's the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life so he faced the channel of Temptation that every Mortal would ever face and he overcome the channel not the what he didn't have to face pornography he didn't have to face marijuana he overcome the channel and said do as I do let me hook you up to the buggy take me on the job with you let them smell the aroma of Christ in you the hope of glory let them sense that your life has been changed praise the Lord praise the Lord and he would say to the Lord Jesus today Lord that's the greatest desire of my heart to be an overcomer would you just stand to your feet those of you that that's your desire we don't want to just raise our hand today if we want to stand so it doesn't really matter what it is but how how do I do it I do it by the word [Music] oh I want to do so much for God I I want to do something for god brother darling well let me tell you how to do it the way to do something for God is that God help you overcome yourself [Music] that's the ones he uses to conquer is the conquered in the Kingdom of Christ the conquered are the conquerors and the kingdom of the devil those who are not conquered are the conquered ones they will never overcome their self and Satan in the end gets them all and the last one to be destroyed and that burning fire will be Satan himself maybe for millions and millions of years he will burn and turn and toss and be haunted but eventually he himself will be destroyed and when there is no more devil you will still be shouting the Praises of almighty God you the one that looked like you could never overcome you the one that it seemed you would never be able to face it and the liar who told you that no longer exists and you are praising the Lord God for eternity Hallelujah we've been made more than conquerors oh the cars in this life oh yes we are we've been made
