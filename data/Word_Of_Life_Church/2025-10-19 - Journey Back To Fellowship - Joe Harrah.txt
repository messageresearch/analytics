I can't say how much that I was just out in the world and nobody like most of these people and you just called me for some reason. I don't know. But I'm so thankful to have this message delivered to me, revealed to me, Lord. God, let may that you speak through the pastor or the minister this morning and reveal more of your word to us. And these people who sick and afflicted, Lord, as they go through life, as we get older, we're going to have these problems. But Lord, it was said that Satan puts it on us, but you take it off.

Do you believe that with all your heart? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Give him one more good hand clap of praise if you love him. [Music] High upon a mountain from where he ascended, the angel of the Lord declared that it would be. He said, "Don't you stand here grieving cuz there's one that lives in life come back just like you might [Music] I believe a trumpet sounds [Music] [Music] and he's going to split the sky. I believe he's coming back like he said. When God believe that time is nearing and that will soon see his appearance. Oh, this could be the hour. Oh, this could be eternal day. Amen. When the bride from every nations, she starts to lose gravitation in the middle of the air. He calls away. And I believe he's coming back like he said. I believe a trump is going to sound so loud. He'll raise her between the armen. He's going to split the sky. I believe he's coming back like he said. Oh, and I believe that the time is nearing when we'll soon see his appearing. Oh, this could be the hour. I wish this would be the day when the bride from every nation we start to lose earthly gravitation in the middle of the air because away I believe he's coming act like he say. I believe the trump is going to sound so loud. You resurrect that day twle. [Music] [Music] [Music] He will sweat. He's going back like he said just like he said. [Applause] [Music] Oh, give him another good hand clap of praise. He's worthy. Thank you, Lord. You can be seated this morning. Give our singers a nice hand as they get ready to sing. [Music] [Music] This is the moment where everything turns. Didn't think I would see it. Was hard to believe. Heaven crashes to earth. I've read the stories of all that you've done. Parted the sea and set captives free. Never thought I'd be one. I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. [Music] I am the living proof of what the Lord has done. [Music] may call it crazy, but they can't take away my story. Cuz I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. [Music] They said I wouldn't make it, that I should give up. [Music] But they didn't know that the God that I serve is more than enough. He can move mountains. He can make broken beautiful. I never run out of hoping. I run to the God of Mirales. I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. I am the living proof of what the Lord has done. They call me crazy, but they can't take away my story. Cuz I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. [Music] Look what the Lord has done. Look what the Lord has done. Oh, the enemy did what he could, but the Lord, he has used it for good. Oh, look what the Lord has done. Oh, look what the Lord has done. When a thief tried to steal and destroy, the Lord gave me a more joy. Yeah. I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. I am the living proof of what the Lord has done. They call me crazy, but they can't take away my story. Cuz I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. Cuz I am a living, breathing, walking testimony. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Come on. [Music] [Applause] You can't seem to hide the hurt written on your face. You're broken inside. Longing for love's embrace. It might be a while before you smile. I know cuz I fought that fight and weeping may endure for the night, [Music] but it's almost morning. Joy will replace the tears. Calm all your darkest fears. It won't be long till the dawn. Tomorrow is another day to live free of all your pain. So don't give up on your faith. Cuz it's almost a morning. I've been where you are. I've had my heart break, too. I've cried in the dark. [Music] I can relate with you. And I have prayed to see the sun break free while the storm was still inside. So when your darkness consumes the guiding light, remember it's almost morning. Joy will replace the tears. Calm all your darkest fears. It won't be long till the dawn. Tomorrow is another day to live free of all your pain. So don't give up on your faith. Cuz it's almost morning. It's almost morning. Joy will replace the tears. Calm all your darkest fears. It won't be long till the dawn. Tomorrow is another day to live free of all your pain. Oh, don't give up on your faith cuz it's almost morning. No, don't give up on your faith cuz it's almost morning. Hey, [Applause] [Music] Well, aren't you glad it's almost morning? Sometimes I look around and I see the world, the condition it's in. It makes me want to go on home. Sing this old song with me. Somewhere just across the Jordan River is a place of everlasting joy and peace. [Music] where the tree of life is moving there forever. [Music] And a crown of life is waiting there for me. Sing it with me. That sounds like home to me. Like where I want to be. There'll be no tears to fear lies again. The hills will let go with the story. As we sing of his grace and glory, where the saints of God will be, there sounds like home to me. [Music] [Applause] They say there's mages there inside the city. A crystal river blows right by the tree of life. There no pain, no disappointments can hurt us. is the best part. And Jesus Christ himself will be the light. Sing it with me. And that's like where I want to be. There be no tears to feel. eyes again. The heels let go [Music] as we sing of his grace and glory where the saints of God will be. That sounds like home to me. [Music] where the saints of God will be. That sounds like home to me. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. Love Brother Terry Tidwell. Now, I know a lot of you going to ask me after church, why didn't you not ask Sister Linda Ardell to sing? Well, I tried and she's a a poor voice this morning, she said. But she did say that the next time she came through, the Lord willing, she'd give us at least two songs. So, we're going to hold her to that. Amen. Let's stand to our feet this morning. But Joe's going to come bring us the word of the Lord. We certainly want to pray that the Lord just be with our brother and give him words that would feed our soul and give us exactly what we have need of. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Let's sing a little course this morning. It won't be long. Will you let &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that? It won't be long. &gt;&gt; It won't be long. [Music] We'll soon be leaving here. [Music] It won't be long. We'll be going home. No, it won't be long. No, it won't be long till you leave here. &gt;&gt; It won't be long. [Music] We'll be going home. [Music] Count the years as months. Say it to him, church. Count the months as we [Music] count the weeks as days. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, &gt;&gt; we'll be going home. Oh, now it won't be long. No, it won't be long. We'll soon be leaving. We're going home. It won't be long. It won't be long. every home [Music] and we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. How many you believe him with all your heart? &gt;&gt; We shall be like him. &gt;&gt; When he comes, we shall be like him. Any day now we'll be going home. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; No, it won't be long, church. It won't be long. We'll soon be leaving here. It won't be long. No, it won't be long. We'll be going home. Oh, it won't be long. No, it won't be long. We'll soon leave here. It won't be long. [Music] We'll be going home. Amen. Pray that's what we're all longing for. &gt;&gt; You know that it's what we're going to talk about this morning is is the way. This place that you we've longed for. God's made a provided way for that this morning. So, if you have your Bibles, you'll turn into the scriptures with me to John 14. It's good to see everybody this morning. It's good to see Brother Ken and Sister Linda. They're like family and brother Terry and Sister Vicki. Brother Terry's probably been one of my best encouragers and supporters since I've started ministering. And um it's it's been a real, you know, struggle sometimes to, you know, feel like you're doing what helping people or doing the what God called you to do. And then you get people like brother Terry just encourage you all the time. And brother Terry, I I appreciate it. So hopefully we give you something this morning that'll be a blessing to you. And nothing new, simple as always. But you know, the Lord put this on my heart in back in July and I've studied all week on it and I've been told several times in my mind that it ain't going to go over good. So &gt;&gt; I'm hoping it does. &gt;&gt; It will. &gt;&gt; So if you read your open your Bibles there, John 14 1-7. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. And whether I go, ye know, and the way you know. And Thomas said unto him,"Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way?" And Jesus said unto him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful, Lord, that you've met us here this morning, Lord. We feel your presence here this morning, Lord. And Lord, we we don't want to grieve that away, Lord. We don't want to do anything, Father, that would grieve the Holy Spirit, Lord, that would, as your prophet said, send him off somewhere to to sit on a a limb or wait for us to make it right. Lord, we want our lives checked up with the word, Lord. We want to lay everything aside, Father, that we can receive. Lord, you know every need here. Lord, if every need in here was different, Lord, you can still bring one message and meet every single need. Father, that's that's how great you are. &gt;&gt; Lord, they haven't come here to hear me this morning, Father. They've come in need and and I can't meet one single need here this morning, Father, but you can. I pray that you would set me aside, Lord, cuz Lord, if you don't, I'm going to stand up here and make a mess of this. But Lord, you said that where two or three are gathered in my name, there I would be in the midst, Lord. And that's what we're counting on this morning, Lord. That we could all get out of the way. You could have preeminence. you can walk up and down these aisles, Lord, and touch hearts and touch lives. We're believing you for that. We thank you for it and we welcome you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. We're going to read that in also in Matthew 7. Thank you, buddy. 13 and 14. Enter ye in at the straight gate. For wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be which go in there, because the straight is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. And I want to read in the token what brother Brandham says in the token. Israel's slain lamb was was God's requirement. Jehovah required a slain lamb, an innocent substitute. As we've been through in the week gone by, that God when he makes a decision, he never changes it. And he made a way. His first thing that he did when man had fallen, he made a way for him uh back. If he never wanted to redeem him, he made a decision that saved man by the blood of an innocent one. And he has forever done the same thing. He has never changed it. No place will God ever meet any worshipper only under the blood. That's his only place. And what I want to title this this morning is the journey back to fellowship. And we we we look at this, you know, and and we know that God has made a way back. So if God made a way back, there had to be something to go back to. We see we say he made a way back to for for Adam and he made a way back for for mankind. And we look that and but when we look at that and we look at proverbs, you know, in Proverbs um 14:12, it says there's a way that seemth right unto a man that seemth right. &gt;&gt; But he says at the end thereof is the ways of death. So that is the age we're living in. We we we have people that are are going their way because it seems right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But it's not the way. &gt;&gt; Proverbs says this is a way. It seems right. and and the people, you know, you you you see it even the message. We can say you see it in the denominations. We got so many denominations. Why do we have denominations? Because it seemed right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It seemed the way. &gt;&gt; You can't tell these people that they're not sincere in what they believe in. You can't tell these people they're not going to heaven. &gt;&gt; They and in their hearts and their minds, they they feel like they have found the way, &gt;&gt; but the end thereof is death. &gt;&gt; Let's bring it on down to the message. They have found a way that seems right. &gt;&gt; It seems right to stay home and push play. &gt;&gt; It seems right to stay home and stream because you worked hard. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; It seems right. &gt;&gt; It's convenient. &gt;&gt; Man is always looking for convenience. always looking for for a way to do something that that is convenient for them. That's that's why people live the way they want to believe. They we don't need a prophet nowadays. We we don't we don't need a pastor nowadays. We don't need a way. It's convenient for their life. &gt;&gt; They want a message. They they want a a church and a message and a pastor that will give them what fits their life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And it all leads to death. &gt;&gt; It leads to death. This is not the way. Brother Brandham said in the Bible says that God gave one provided way, one and one only. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in a provided way of approach to fellowship. As soon as man falls, finds that he has fallen, he tries to make himself a way to approach God. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, I want to make myself feel good for what I've done wrong. &gt;&gt; They're looking for for peace. They're looking for for something to confirm them that to validate them that even though you're living wrong, I want to be validated that this is not so wrong. &gt;&gt; We we've heard the prophet talking about searing your conscience. People do it so long. They do it so many so many times after they the Satan convinces them over and over you're in the right way. You're you're doing it right &gt;&gt; and they it sears their conscience and and it's no longer there. You can no longer convince them they are going wrong &gt;&gt; because their conscience has been seared, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't want I I do not know man no harm, but I feel I'm just about as good as the other man. I keep the golden rule. That wasn't God's program. In order to restore fellowship again, God made a provision right there in the garden that if there would be any other provision better, God would have made it. &gt;&gt; If God said, brother B said, if God said there was something better than this way, what was his way? Something had to die. &gt;&gt; Something had to die. An innocent life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was God's provided way. That's why you're all here today. That's why you're filled with the Holy Ghost because you came God's provided way. You accepted the blood of an innocent one. &gt;&gt; This was God's way. &gt;&gt; But God made the other provision, the only basis of restoration to that blessed eternal fellowship that was through the blood of an innocent victim. God made a way back to fellowship. But you have to understand what how God is looking at Adam and Eve in the garden. God's way came about because God had a conditional covenant with Adam and Eve, &gt;&gt; a conditional covenant. This had conditions. &gt;&gt; Just like you as parents tell on your you tell your kids, if you do this, I'm going to do this. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ground you. I'm going to do this. I'm going to take this from you. Whipping never worked for my kids. You take their cell phone from them or their video games. They begged you for a whooping. That's when you know it's working. Yes, I did. I did spank my kids a time or two. &gt;&gt; But he told tells Adam and Eve, "This is conditional. If you eat thereof that day you die, &gt;&gt; something had to die. God had to make a provision. If it had not been for you, where where would we be today if God had not made a way of grace for you and I? If you could sit and think of everything you've done, everything in your life, so many things you're ashamed of, if God hadn't made a way of grace, if God hadn't made a provision for you to take that which you had done and placed it on somebody else. &gt;&gt; Well, where did he place it? He placed it on the way. &gt;&gt; It's no longer yours. &gt;&gt; It's not yours. That thing you keep reminding yourself of all the time. That thing, Lord, you you repent for it all the time. You repent. Lord, forgive me for this. Forgive me for doing that. &gt;&gt; Why are you doing that? &gt;&gt; It's no longer yours. &gt;&gt; It was placed in the way. He was placed and we'll get to in a minute, but if you read the word way in there, the Greek word means one of the words is journey. God became the journey. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the way. I am the highway and I am the journey." &gt;&gt; You're not making this journey. This ain't you. You could never make it. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I am the journey. &gt;&gt; I'm making the journey for you." &gt;&gt; Our minds can't comprehend. There was no way that we would be able to live under God with a conditional covenant. So when he makes this, brother Brandon said he makes this unconditional covenant with Abraham. He tells Abraham this includes your royal seed. &gt;&gt; Which is you. &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; You didn't find the way because God said my condition with you, my my covenant with you is unconditional. The way found you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You didn't find the way. You had nothing to do with it. You was happy doing whatever you were doing. &gt;&gt; But the way came across you cuz it's there was something inside of you. You didn't know it. There was something inside of you trying to get back to what you were in in the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said you were in the thought of God before the foundation of the world. That's what makes you a part of God. Can you you imagine you have a thought and you go out here you think well that's a part of me cuz I thought that our minds can't comprehend that but God says if you were ever in my mind for one split second you are part of me &gt;&gt; you don't brother Ram said you don't remember it but you were there but there's something in here that deep calling to the deep is pulling you out trying to bring you back &gt;&gt; that's the Hey, this is the way to fellowship. God's provided way &gt;&gt; in uncertain sound. You came from where? You go to where? You came out of eternity. You stepped into a little space called time. You go out of time into eternity. What you are in your soul as you go out, the same you'll be. And Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. This is the ending of time. There will be no more of one of these days. We come out of eternity. Stepped into a little time space here and stepped out of time, back into eternity. We was before there was a world. Then we come into the world and we go out of the world, back into the unknown to us. It's unknown to us. We we we we have a a seventh day messenger come and tell us where you were before time ever was. If you're only a part of time, you can never go back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can never go back. If you wasn't there before, God took that little slot of eternity and he pushed it out. He pushed it out. When did he push it out? Genesis 1. In the beginning, &gt;&gt; because eternity doesn't have a beginning. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have a day it started. It doesn't have a day it ended. But when God said in the beginning when God said let there be he pushed out a little slot of eternity a little loop as it were and pushed it out and called this time. So we we we look at the 146 John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life. No man cometh unto the father but by me. It's a way, a traveled road, a journey. Everyone has to come this way. All the prophets had to come this way. All the martyrs had to come this way. We're no exception. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter who you related to, whose church you go to. It matters if you was there before God pushed time out &gt;&gt; because time, you're on two journeys. I shared this with brother Rob a couple weeks ago. You're on two journeys. You're on a journey in life and you're on a journey spiritually. If you're true seed, if you came from eternity, the thought of God at some point in your life, it doesn't matter where you're at. You might not even be here this morning. You may be laying drunk somewhere. But if your true seed of God, them journeys will meet up. &gt;&gt; It's impossible not to. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, when when you recognized this this word was eagle food, you heard from your theophony. What was that? That was them two journeys meeting up in the middle of the way &gt;&gt; and it turns you back on your journey to fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; You you you don't have to wait till you get back to on the other side. When I get to heaven, I get to have fellowship with God. The way brought you to fellowship today, &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had to come this way. though they went under the the to the grave under the the the blood of bulls and goats. That didn't give them eternal life. The the blood of bulls and goats didn't bring them back to God. &gt;&gt; It covered their humanity, their sins that they committed for that time. &gt;&gt; There still had to be a way come for them. Last night, the other other night, I was I was praying because I was battling for for like Monday and Tuesday. I've been studying this and I was really battling it. This is just not going to go over. Lord, just help me. And I know that's the devil. I I I do. and and and I was praying, Lord, help me give me something Wednesday when I go to Wednesday to give me confirmation that this and brother Donnie preached all over some of this and that just settled in my heart. But the things he was talking about there and when he started talking about the the the journey through time and and all that and he started talking about Paul's day and Luther's day and and how things dropped out of eternity into time and I got to thinking about that, you know, he and brother Donnie was talking about how everything didn't drop in in that Paul in Paul's day. Seven seals didn't drop into Paul's day. No, &gt;&gt; what did what what what did he gave? He dropped eternal faith and strength for the for the the people of that day in the in the first church age. God takes it out of out of time. I mean out of eternity and and drops faith, God's faith, God's strength, God's power because what was getting ready to happen? They were getting ready to be martyed. They're getting ready to be hunted and killed for what they believe in. And God drops faith in their in out of eternity into time. &gt;&gt; Yes. When we look at this journey, each church age, God drops a little bit more of himself, which is his word. God is his word. He drops it out of t out of eternity down into time. &gt;&gt; John West Luther's, he drops sanctification out of eternity and put it into time. &gt;&gt; The just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Sanctification hadn't come yet. John Wesley comes along. God drops sanctification from eternity into time. You are cleaned. You are washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As if you never done it. &gt;&gt; But God didn't stop there. In this leodysian church age, he takes a seventh angel messenger, the spirit of Elijah out of eternity and drops it into time. &gt;&gt; Because that spirit of Elijah is eternal. &gt;&gt; God gave it different ages. Spirit of Elijah, &gt;&gt; it's eternal. If it wasn't, who knows where we'd be today? The spirit of Elijah, what do you come do? Turn the the hearts of the children back to the fathers. God says, "I'm dropping this out of eternity." And what's going to happen is everything that you got in Paul's day, everything you got in Luther's day, everything you got in Wesley's day, I'm going to tie all those loose ends together. This is the way. In 63, the seals were dropped out of eternity into time. Why? You needed him for the way. &gt;&gt; You needed him for the Can I explain the seven seals? I can't even start. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not a scholar. I don't know stuff. Stuff that that that I I I feel like I I've got to read and study and then after I read it and study it, I forget it. &gt;&gt; I have to trust when I come up here. I have to trust in him because y'all be getting a mess. &gt;&gt; Y'all would just get a total mess &gt;&gt; because I I don't have memory retention. Now, I can remember names and and people I I arrested 20 years ago. I don't know why I remember junk like that. &gt;&gt; I could see him in Walmart. I arrested him 15 years ago. &gt;&gt; Why? What benefit is that? &gt;&gt; Have no clue. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to this, I I can't remember. But I know what's in here. And that's that's the deal with God says it ain't if you understand it. Do you believe it? Brother Donnie preached that here a few weeks ago. It's not about you got to understand every little word, everything that said it's all the knowledge you get. Do you believe it? Do you have the spirit to believe that you're in the way? &gt;&gt; Paul's saying, "I've been on a journey. I fought the fight. I fought the a good fight. I have finished my course. Paul finished his course. We're You're on a course. That's the term that used a course. This is this is a way. This is a direction. This is something you have to plug a GPS into right here. You got a GPS. And the and and the pastor that stands up here is not a woman with a British accent, &gt;&gt; but he's still telling you directions. &gt;&gt; You go here, when you get up here, you take a left turn. And when you go this way for about three or four years, you take a right turn. &gt;&gt; Why? It's directions on the way. God's not going to put you on the way and not tell you how to go. &gt;&gt; He's not going to put you in a certain place and not explain to you this is what I need to go. But what he's going to say, what is God's directions for you and me on this way? Follow me. &gt;&gt; Let me do it for you. &gt;&gt; Don't get out ahead. There's so we we get in so much trouble all the time because we get so far ahead of God. We we we feel like we we need to help God. How many's ever helped God before? &gt;&gt; Oh man, I help him so many times. He ain't thank me one time. &gt;&gt; I help him all the time. And whenever I help him, I end up redoing what I had to wanted him to do for me. &gt;&gt; That's just the nature, a human nature. I can do it. I can do it. I remember so many times I've asked God, "God, would you fix this? Would you do this? Would you do this? And if it ain't done by the end of the day, I got this. I don't know why I bothered you, God. I've got this." That ain't the way God works. God, when when you have a need, God says, "You lay it down. You give it to me. &gt;&gt; You You can't trust yourself with your own needs. &gt;&gt; We You You can't trust humanity. Why did Why Why did you have to be filled with the Holy Ghost? Because you can't trust yourself. &gt;&gt; I can't anyway. &gt;&gt; But look at Paul's journey. We look at Paul says, "I have finished my course. I' I've fought a good fight." But yet when we look at the back end of Paul's life through human eyes, you say, "No, Paul, you you didn't fight a good fight. You were killing God's people. You were prosecuting them." How could you say that? The way found him. &gt;&gt; The the way found him on the road to Damascus, the sinful life that he was living and his eternal life met up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they met up. That was the point of intersection for Paul. We and we're all going to have it &gt;&gt; if you're a seed. But that's where Paul his his journey through life the time and his journey to eternity met up on the road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; So why did why does Paul refer to this as a fight? &gt;&gt; If Jesus is the way, this should be so easy. He said let there be and a big world came. &gt;&gt; He said let he healed cancer. &gt;&gt; Why? Why is this so so hard? It's the way why why did he have to fight? &gt;&gt; I want to go I'm going to jump. Let me read this quote. Now in the beginning Christ identified the same in all generations. That's when time started when eternity broke into time. Now after a while time comes back into eternity. Of course time is eternity too. It's a but time is aotted space. That's the way only thing we know is inches and yards and miles and figures but that's nothing to God. He don't have no time. &gt;&gt; So we look at I want to I want to look at the I'm going to jump ahead and then I'm going to jump back if you'll give me a minute. But Jesus tells tells them narrow is the way. Narrow. We're we're thinking it's just real. We got to turn sideways to get into it. That ain't what Jesus mean. Go look up the word narrow. Means distressed. It's hard. It's tough. &gt;&gt; It's a fight. Amen. Th &gt;&gt; this way is not easy. Why did he say few there be that find it? &gt;&gt; Few there be. &gt;&gt; It's it's narrow. You've got to fight. You look at the things that you go through in your life. You wake up in a battle. You go through the day in a battle. &gt;&gt; You come home and lay down in a battle. Everywhere you go, it's a battle. It's either getting on you, it's getting on your wife, getting on your kids, and it's it's always something. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're seed. You're not going to be without those days. You're not exempt. You're you're not exempt from a fight. &gt;&gt; You're you're not exempt from hard times. You're not exempt from from mistakes. You're not exempt from from failures. &gt;&gt; But one thing that should be reassuring to you is while you make them mistakes, make them failures. You're in the way. &gt;&gt; You're on your way back to fellowship with him with God. And then the way is the only thing that will bring you there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Satan wants you to focus on those things. That's why he wants you to stumble. He knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; He knows what you believe. &gt;&gt; He watches your life. He knows it needs you living it. So man has always wanted a way back to God, &gt;&gt; but they've wanted to set their own journey. This started with Cain, right? &gt;&gt; Cain found his own way. He found a way that seemed as right. &gt;&gt; How many knows why Cain and Abel were making sacrifices? I'll read a quote that I never saw before. Maybe y'all have why they were making sacrifices. Brother Bram said Abel had a revelation that it required blood. But what was he given this sacrifice for? Why was he sacrificing? Just as Cain and Abel, they also came together in a clash. Them being brothers, both of them of the same mother Eve. We found out they realized that they were mortal. They realized it. We're just human beings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they had been put out of life, out of the garden of life, and they were both trying to find a way to get back in there. &gt;&gt; There was something in there that they wanted. &gt;&gt; That's the same desire God placed in you &gt;&gt; that makes you want to get back in there. &gt;&gt; What are you offering? Are you offering a way that seemth right or are you taking the way with all the hardships, the trials, &gt;&gt; the faults, the failures? Are you taken that way? Brother Bram tells us in fellowship of 56. It's not up there, brother. But but God turned and saw his children leaving the garden and he couldn't stand it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This hurt God. &gt;&gt; God God didn't didn't cast him out. Say, "Okay, y'all get out. I'm going to make a better way. I'm I'm going to make a way. This is just all part of my plan." God loved them. Yeah, &gt;&gt; God hat God loved the fellowship that he had with them. &gt;&gt; This this this was was was God's own creation that that he spoke over and now they're leaving the garden. And God goes on a journey to become the journey. We look at man leaving the garden and and when man leaves the garden, he goes on a journey himself further and further into sin. If you haven't got the hints by now, you're on a journey. &gt;&gt; There's not a single person in here that's not on a journey. &gt;&gt; You're on a journey to something. &gt;&gt; You're on a journey to one of two places. And it depends on on your desire. Depends on you what's in here. So we we look at that God cast him out of the garden and and and and we now he he offered a substitute for their for their sin and and innocent blood and he cast him out of the garden and and humankind mankind goes on a journey. And as God watches them on this journey, they're getting further and further away from God. We follow Cain's seed through the Bible and and how how the and we even look into the children of Israel as they we we'll get on that in a minute how they got further away from God and and re read when you read the Old Testament. This king did evil inside of the Lord and this king ways were evil and man got further and further and further away from God. But God's journey never stopped. &gt;&gt; God went on a journey to make a way back. That's what God's desire was was to make a way back for man. &gt;&gt; That's God's desire for you to make a way back &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Even when you fall, you make mistakes. We get cold every we all get cold and indifferent in our walk &gt;&gt; because sometimes we we find ourselves leaning on this life journey a little more than we do on this eternal journey. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but there had to be a way. And God goes on a journey because God's greatest desire, God had one desire to go on this journey. Bring man back to fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's God. That's all that's God's ever asked from us. That's all that God's ever ever ever ever wanted from you. Fellowship. Now, that is so deep. &gt;&gt; I don't know how we get a recipe for that. How we we get a something drawn up to how we find what God wants. It's so simple. You've missed it. &gt;&gt; God's way that he that he prepared for you was back to fellowship. He wants to talk to you. He wants to spend time with you. Sometimes we we do all the talking. &gt;&gt; Oh, I found the way. Now I can find out everything. I I can I can give him everything I need. I have need of this. I need a better job. I need more money. I need my bills paid. I need healed. All those things are good. But do we ever let him talk to us? &gt;&gt; You know, when I was studying this and and brother Harry sings that song, stay. I don't want you to go. When I was studying this, I brother got to thinking, does God ever say that to us? &gt;&gt; We we say to God, "God, please stay. Don't go. Don't leave. I want to worship you a little longer. I Does God ever say it to us?" Does God whenever the minister's done and you want to get up and go, you got things to do and God just fed you from heaven. He gave you words of life. &gt;&gt; And you got to hurry and get out. &gt;&gt; He provided a way. He's provided a way from the worst thing that's ever going to come on this earth. This world hasn't seen anything yet. &gt;&gt; And God provided you a way of escaping. You got to hurry up and go make sure you don't miss kickoff. You got things you got to do. My shoulder hurts. I don't feel like raising my hand. How did his feel? &gt;&gt; He raised his for you. &gt;&gt; And he was the way. This is the way that he prepared for you. And it hurt a little bit. &gt;&gt; Bible says he was in agony. So much grief, so much pain. His sweat was his drops of blood. It's the way it ain't It ain't easy. It It It ain't attractive. It ain't cool. But it's his way. It is for a short season. You know, I was I was sitting this and Jennifer had played the song a few weeks ago. Tommy Bates singing, "Heaven will be worth the journey when I get home." You could take one little just eternity. Think of eternity. But Ram says, "You you would praise him for for millions of years." And he said, "And it's like time never moved." Time never moved. We think of that. Look at the journey. You you you look at your mistakes. You look at your failures and you you get so down and depressed. You think nobody likes you. &gt;&gt; You want to move away because these people don't like you. That little portion of nobody liking you is only just a little few seconds compared to the time you'll spend with him. &gt;&gt; If nobody likes you, so what? Amen. &gt;&gt; He does. &gt;&gt; If people are talking about you and things you've done this and that ever, who cares? &gt;&gt; Who cares? It's only a short a short short time compared to what you're earning for it. &gt;&gt; Is it not worth it? Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be around God's saints &gt;&gt; because somebody in the church don't like you. I I don't know why I'm going this way. &gt;&gt; You don't want to fellowship with the same people. Believe it or not, you are in God's mind with them. &gt;&gt; You were with them. You fellowshipped with them in God's mind. &gt;&gt; And God just pushed out a little slot of time. just a little slot of time and put you together in that as well. But you don't like them now. Help us people. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; you if you can look at the world that we're living in, I've had people that don't even go to church tell me time's about over. How much more should we see it that we already have our sights on eternity? &gt;&gt; We see it unfolding. &gt;&gt; You've had you've had a 7th day messenger come down here and tell you in 65. I don't know how it can get much worse. &gt;&gt; But you've been placed in the way. You've been placed on a journey. And he says, "I'll be your journey. Forget about people not liking you. Forget about people talking about you. Forget about your faults and mis mistakes. Those are mine. I take them from you. Stay in the way. This is the only way you'll journey back to fellowship. &gt;&gt; This is God's journey. God goes on a journey. The only way for God to bring man back to fellowship was for God himself to step into that little loop of time that he pushed out. He pushed this this little loop of time out and God himself steps into it. Brother Jackie, he stepped into time. He had people talk about him. He had people make fun of him. &gt;&gt; So anything that you go through on your journey through time, he's been there. &gt;&gt; He's done it. But Brandham said in sign 62, he knows that he came from somewhere, but he wants to find his way back. Adam really expressed that the first man on the earth after finding that he had fallen from grace. He tried to take his own intelligence and make a way back to God without atonement. That's why we we have people nowadays that are thinkers. They're thinkers. That's why they've left this word. &gt;&gt; They got to thinking about it. &gt;&gt; They got to using this portion that was created in time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Instead of the portion that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Why? They probably weren't there. They're using the only faculty they have &gt;&gt; to understand this word. The only faculty. If they weren't there, you can't understand the mind of God if you weren't there. &gt;&gt; And you didn't have a messenger come and and when he broke open the seals reveal it to you. If you weren't there, you're not going to get it. &gt;&gt; You're not going to understand it. &gt;&gt; I still don't understand it. this does. &gt;&gt; Only thing I understand about it that it's it's a part of me and I'm a part of it. &gt;&gt; And when it goes, I'm going with it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the the word of God will not return to God void. &gt;&gt; When that seven the the revelation, the seven seals returns back to God in eternity, I'll return with it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you don't understand it." It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter &gt;&gt; what I understand. &gt;&gt; What matters is am I a part of it? &gt;&gt; Is it a part of me? Because that's the way. Is is the seven seals the way? No. No. You have to understand him by knowledge. No. It's the spirit that gave him the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God. when God spoke it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to jump here. Brandon says in the unfailing re realities of the living God, this is a long quote and I apologize. In 60, what can you give? God re will receive what you'll give. But he wants all of you. If you just want to give him a couple minutes in the morning when you get up, he'll take it. If you want to lay your head down on at night on the pillow, and I've been guilty. I've been guilty laying my head down on the pillow. Lord, thank you for a day and before you even say, "Amen, you're asleep." But guess what? He took it. &gt;&gt; He took it. Anything that you give him, he'll take. God is not a God that says, "Okay, if if you're not going to give me everything, if you're not going to pray for me 24 pray with 247, because the Bible says pray without ceasing, if you're not going to do this, if you're not going to talk spiritual all the time, all this, I don't want nothing. That's not our God." Understand this. When when when we look at how how God came down and became flesh, God understands every aspect of your life. &gt;&gt; The humanity part, he knows you have things to do. He know that there's there's hobbies and things that you enjoy. We need those. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet did it. That's why he go hunt and fish and and throw football with his boy in the in the backyard. There's things that you do and God understands that. It's not all about I I can't get in if I don't if if I'm not talking about the word all the time. He wants every bit of you. He wants all. He wants everything you are. He wants your life. He wants your testimony. He wants every minute you live. He wants you to live right, act right, talk right, do right. He wants everything perfectly surrendered to him that he can lead you and guide you and put you into places where he wants you to go. led of the spirit. But people today say, "Now wait a minute. If my pastor preaches over 20 minutes, ours does. We don't mind." Brother Bram says, "I've heard that many a time. I've seen good pastors turned away from churches because the deacon board said, "Look here, Reverend. We hired you to come here and we never hired you to come here and blast us all morning. We want we've set the time of 20 minutes. The bell rings, you better be through. This is one of my favorite quotes in this script in this sermon. I like to have a church like that once. I'd like to have the privilege to tell them what I think about them and what the word says about them. Why? If it took all day, just keep on preaching. Y'all know me. I won't be here all day. If it took all day, just keep on preaching. God wants a complete surrender. Do you believe that God wants surrender? How can God show you realities before you surrender him to him? You've got to surrender. We looking at the children of Israel. Well, you know, it's it's so typical the their the children of Israel's journey types so much in in our life in the last day that how the God called them out. There's so many things about the the children of Israel that I don't understand. This is a God that works sa supernatural things in their lives and and and God sends them out calls them out of Egypt. And look at all all the things when they were go how they they watched what God did in in Egypt all the way down to the firstborn. Supernatural things turn the river to blood. All the lice, all the flies, the frogs, everything. They watch supernatural things of God and God calls them out of of Egypt and now they're on their way to the promised land or on their way. The problem was they didn't stay in the way God provided and they come to the Red Sea and the the problem that I have with this brother Keith is whenever they they come up to the Red Sea, they forgot everything God did. &gt;&gt; They forgot it. &gt;&gt; Everything. They begin to murmur and complain, "God's brought us here to die. God God's" and And they begin to say, "How we long to go back and and take the leaks and the garlics of of Egypt?" And God sends him on a journey, and he feeds them mana and quail all the way their entire journey. But I want you to understand something, and I think I mentioned this at brother David Solers's church here a few weeks ago. Every firstborn that had the token applied never made it in the promised land when they put the blood over the doorpost because God's going to save the firstborn. The daddy could have been a firstborn. The mama could have been a firstborn. Could have been a firstborn in all the firstborn. Bible says all the firstborn and they never went in. They never went in the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just because you got anointed, just because you you felt God move in your life and you jumped and you screamed and you shouted and you run around the church and you spun around and you did this all this stuff. Just because you did all that mean you're that don't mean you have the Holy Ghost. What was the promised land? It's type of our Holy Ghost today. They had to go through the river of Jordan to get to the promised land. Who took the promised land? The new man. &gt;&gt; The new man. &gt;&gt; God raised up another generation. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing in in your life. This new man, this man that makes mistakes, don't have the Holy Ghost. You repent and turn away to God and you you come to the River Jordan as a type and get baptized and a new man comes out &gt;&gt; and receives the promised land. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's God's provided way. Why did they, you know, and they tell us when you look at the map, the journey to to the promised land from Egypt was three or four days. &gt;&gt; Their way of doing things took them 40 years. &gt;&gt; A lot of the times we we the things that we find in our life that are hindering us, that are holding us back, is because we're going our own way. because we we we look at the way that we feel like God pulling us to do something and we won't do it because we think it's too hard. I challenge you this morning to accept God's way one time. I don't care how how hard it is. Accept it one time. He'll never put you in a way that he won't take you through. &gt;&gt; He never will. &gt;&gt; If God says this is the way I'm going to go, he'll lead. He'll go first. I'm going to start winding down here. When I was studying this, you know, I got to thinking, what if we're on this journey? We're on this journey and we're going through our everyday life and all of a sudden God pushes pause. God pushes pause on everyone's life and shines a spotlight on where you're at. In other words, look at yourself. Makes everybody turn and look at you as you on your journey. Are you where you feel like you should be? Are you can you honestly take this word? take this message and it line up right where you're at. &gt;&gt; God's spotlights on you or are you off somewhere? Cuz on this way there's Satan has laid a lot of little exits. &gt;&gt; He's laid a lot of ways for you to get off. And you might, well, I'm on the way. I'm still on the way. This, you know, &gt;&gt; have you took a little exit to unforgiveness overlook? Right? Bitterness bypass. We want to call it that. If you have hard feelings towards somebody or you've gotten cold because you you you more the more church you miss, the easier it gets. &gt;&gt; You're missing or are you coming and you're just not eating? So this is this this God's spotlight is on you this morning. And I if we want to call this is a checkup time. Are you where you need to be? If God says, "Okay, I've pushed pause. Tomorrow I'm stopping time. We're going to eternity." So if if God says it's time for you to return back, the only way you're going to return back is if you're in the way. In the way, not a way. So will will he find you ready or is there things in your life that you need to change first? &gt;&gt; Lord help us. &gt;&gt; You know when you read the scripture and it says he's even Jesus told the disciples Jesus says I don't even know when he's coming back. It just amazes me that people can give dates on when God's coming back when Jesus said I don't even know &gt;&gt; in the twinkling of an eye. And if you say, "Well, I'm going to wait for a loved one to come back, and as soon as I've seen them, it'll be too late." Then, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The resurrection is already taking place, then it's too late. &gt;&gt; So, we we we look at our lives and we think, are we ready? Is is our lives checked up and where need to be? That's why we come in here on Sunday. That's that's why we come in on Wednesday. That's why we come to upper room and brother Robs on on Monday. That's why we come to check up. You've got too much going on to go to youth service anymore. You worked a hard day. You're not giving that to me and Brother Rob. You're giving that to God. &gt;&gt; They're giving that to each other. As much as you've done unto the least of these, you've done unto me. There's there's some people I don't mean to they're my kids. They'll forgive me. But then there might be somebody that that hasn't been in a long time or it's never been and and God has ordained you to be there to be a testimony &gt;&gt; and you decide to go to eat Japanese with your friends. It's checkup time. &gt;&gt; You know, I I was gotten to I love the youth. They know I do. They're my heart. I when brother Donnie asked me to to do that I I was like I don't know how that's going to go but now I wouldn't trade it for nothing. I would I wouldn't trade it. We you talked to brother Rob other even the youth you you've seen lives changed in our youth. Youth get stronger. Yes. Some fall away but guess what? They're coming back. You know, I was I want to head down to closing here, but I was thinking when I was studying this and I got to thinking about moms with the youth and there's nobody that prays for her kid to get in the way like a mom does. It father a father can't don't have that that certain special something in here like a mom does. Why do you think she's called the fifth gospel? She feeds them. When they eat this word, they come in on Sunday. They're on their cell phone. They're thinking about this, that, and the other. But when they go home, they got a mom that's living it. They got a mom that's in the way. And I got to thinking about my mom and I, you know, we grew up a home where my mom would read us Bible stories and stuff. We we didn't we had the tapes playing in our home. I could never say nothing about the the way my parents raised me. I had a mom and dad that loved me that took care of us and showed us the right way. But when I was thinking of this, and I hope I can get through this, I remember we moved around a lot. Some of the schools we went to, we got free lunches. Other schools we went to, we didn't. And my mom, Lord, she'd get up every morning, pack us up, feed us breakfast, pack our lunch. And we were poor. We didn't know we were poor because most all her friends were poor. As a kid, you don't know you're poor. But she'd put our lunch in a little brown paper bag and I might had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, bologoney sandwich, maybe a sandwich bag of chips in it. Then I'd go to school and I go sit down with my friends. They had these Batman lunch boxes and not thermoses with soup in it, pudding, cake, brownies, bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches. There were times I didn't even bring my bag out. I was ashamed. My little paper bag. I didn't throw it away. You know why? Cuz my mom packed it. I wasn't thrown that way. You know where I ate it? I was hungry. When I got on that bus home, I got on that bus home. I opened that bag and I ate what my mom made me. You say, "Brother Joe, what do you what's why are you saying that?" Because I want to talk to you moms a minute. You moms that got kids that ain't here. And you're praying for them. You have fed them for 19 years. You've packed their lunch for 19 years. It ain't cool where they're at. That lunch you packed them don't fit in. They just don't fit in. But I'll promise you this. I promise you, they ain't going to throw it away. They'll never throw it away. They're going to eat it on the way back. everything you've packed for them for 19, 20, 18 years, it doesn't matter. They'll eat it on the way back because that food's eternal. And if there's something in here and that son or daughter of yours that is eternal is going to get hungry for that, &gt;&gt; it's going to get hungry. You can't throw away God's food. That's why you entrusted mothers to pack it. Let's stand together. You know, maybe you've gotten to a place where you can't find where you're at in your journey. You can't find joy in your journey. can't find peace. You know, you you look at the world today and there's so much depression, so much anxiety, so much everything. People are just, you know, in in in in law enforcement. I mean, over over at the college, we we we have programs that's set up to um so many mental health programs, students get anxiety and depressed over grades and over this and and we've got to we've got to help them. We've got to seek therapy for them and and all this and send them here and send them there. It's rampant. The mental battle that that we fight is is rampant. And and sons and daughters of God, you're you're not so you're subject to that as well. &gt;&gt; Satan puts that thing in our life, too. He puts depression there. He brings anxiety and and and bitterness and all kinds of things in our in our life that we we say we can't deal with it. There's there's no more joy. God never planned destined this journey you're on not to have joy in it. &gt;&gt; He never destined anything we do in our life to not have peace. &gt;&gt; There's things that you go through. I know many of you have lost loved ones and you know only it's it's hard if you've never been in your shoes. It's it's hard for you to say, "Well, I I know what you're going through." You can't. But what you could do is pray God brings peace upon them because Satan will use that. Satan will use the humanity to bring them down. &gt;&gt; So how do we get joy when the children of Israel come out on the other Red Sea? They didn't have joy on this side, brother Harry. But when they come through on the other side, the joy returned. What God had wished is they had joy on this side. When they walked up and seen that Red Sea, they should have started rejoicing. We know what our God can do. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are in his way. We're on our journey to the promised land. We're on our journey back to him. How can you not find joy in that? Amen. &gt;&gt; How can you not find peace and comfort in that? That that that God is bringing you someplace that is eternal. &gt;&gt; But we use our our our little human brain sometimes just to focus on the things that bother us, the things that we're going through. And God says, "I want to give you joy." As I've I've said it here before, you you when you look at Job, the greatest thing that I love about Job is when the scripture tells tells us that he says,"I know that in the I know that he is God and he could do all things." Job was just like halfway through his trial. Then he was still on the ash heap. He began to praise God because he finally realized God opened his eyes not to you're on the ash heap, not that you're covered in boils, not that you've lost everything. He gave him a re revelation that brother Brandham said he handed Job his binoculars, God's binoculars, and let him look ahead 4,000 years and he saw Calvary. So Job says it doesn't matter what I go through here. That's I've gained that. That is my redeemer. &gt;&gt; That's my journey back to fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we we would have more worship. We would have more praise. We would have more joy. If &gt;&gt; we would look at where we're going instead of where we're at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we look at he's the way. I'm not the way. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. If you have a need this morning, I know I do. I I want to be found in the way. You say you you say, "Brother Joe, I'm I find myself off to one side or the other so many times. If God's put you in the way, if God has ordained you and put you in the way, I promise you, you're going to make it back to fellowship. It's impossible not to. But sometimes we we we see these side exits so many times in our lives, little things that Satan puts in there, and maybe you took one of them. We know besetting sins is a real thing. You've got something in your life that you can't get rid of or you're trying to get rid of. Hold that before the Lord. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, this morning we want you to be able to pause, as it were, our journey through life. And if the spotlight was to shine upon us, Lord, we would be right in the middle in our way to eternity, centered on the word, Lord, lacking nothing. Lord, that's our desire. Lord, we know that human frailty so many times comes into play and we might slip off one side or the other, Lord, but you as you lead us as you are the way, you are the journey, you pull us back into the middle. Lord, touch every life here, every heart. Father, if there's someone here, Lord, that's that that's slipped away and got out of sight of this this this journey, Lord, I pray that you would pull them back. Lord, we know that in in as eternity, Lord, in in in this last day of Leo, not only did you drop your messenger into this age, Lord, you didn't only drop a message that would turn the hearts of the children back to the forefathers, Lord, but you also dropped healing in this age. You dropped deliverance in this age, Lord. You dropped redemption. You dropped salvation. You dropped joy and praise and worship in this age, Lord. Lord, may we reach out and grasp a hold of that, Father. Lord, may we sing praises, Lord, as we return back to eternity. Father, may our praise not be lacking. May our worship not be lacking, Father, in any way. &gt;&gt; Touch each heart, Lord. Touch each desire here this morning, Father. I pray that you would. How we love you and we thank you for it, Lord. Thank you for being here this morning, Lord. Thank you for helping me, Lord. I know I jumped around a lot and missed so much stuff, Lord, but your will is always perfect. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's let's worship him a little bit. Brother Harry, go if you want to sing something. If you have a need, we'll pray for you. Thank you for being so attentive this morning. I really appreciate it. [Music] I know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord. And I'll know what time it is because time stood still. Bies [Music] were healed [Music] and families restored [Music] because we stayed here [Music] in the presence of the Lord. No one had to say a word. Couldn't even make a sound.

We appreciate what brother Joe had to say for us. [Applause] Let's just sing this song. I don't want to say we'll sing it as we go because it's hard to leave when it's when it feels like this. Let's sing uh I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Let's just worship him a little bit. We're not going to get to come back until Wednesday night. Let's just let it sink in for a little bit. Amen. When the music fades and all is stripped away and I simply come, longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless your heart. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking in to my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. But it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. King of endless worth. No one could express how much you deserve. Oh, though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours. Every single breath. Oh, I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. [Applause] [Music] You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking in to my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Oh, it's all about you. Lord, it's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. Oh, it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Lord, it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made. Oh, it's all about you. Lord, it's all about you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. We'll just sing us old song as we go. Every time I get up here, I think of this song cuz I'm going on with my Jesus just the same. It doesn't matter what's going on. I'm going to go on with him, man. We'll sing this as we go. God bless you. Have a safe travels home and have a good week. We'll be back here on Wednesday night. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going on with my Jesus just the same. I'm going on my Jesus just the same. Well, you may false accuse me and scandalize my name, but I'm going on with my Jesus just the same. Well, the narrow way is a straight way. It don't have no cooks to be. I got to go on with my Jesus. I know he's my best friend. When the enem is all around me, tears fill my eyes. I bow down on my bended knees and I rise up with a smile and tell them I'm going on my Jesus just the same. Yeah, I'm going on my Jesus just the same. You can't false accuse me, scandalize my name, but I'm going on my Jesus just the same. Some people may laugh and talk about me when I shout, but there's one thing for sure. I know what I'm shouting about. No, Satan tries to stop me. put stumbling blocks in my way. I stand up for my arms and these are the words I say. I tell them I'm going on with my Jesus just the same. Well, I'm going on with my Jesus just the same. You may false accuse me and scandalize my name, but I'm going on with my Jesus just the same. Well, I'm going on by Jesus just the same. Oh, I'm going on by Jesus just the same. You may false accuse me, scandalize my name, but I'm going on my Jesus just the same. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
