praise God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus let's bow our heads together if you would loving father we are so thankful today that we know the inspired words to the song it's more than just a Melody it's more than harmonic Voices That Could blend together but it's the message that it carries that Rings true to us today that you are faithful and you are true and we believe Lord that you're coming for a people who match your character so then that means we must also be faithful and true Lord as we approach your word today we seek your help and your Your Divine counsel we know Lord Jesus for anything to be accomplished out of the service that'll be of Eternal value it'll have to be you that does it so we are no more than just instruments that we present ourselves here today no more than this microphone or this organ or piano or guitar which are mutes within themselves but once someone who knows what they're doing takes them then they can take those keys or those strings things that make such beautiful music come out of it so today oh great father would you take our lives our bodies Our Minds our souls into your hands May something beautiful wonderful come out of our lives today we love you father with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen don't you just love him I mean not just love going to church but just Lov him amen amen 1 John chapter 3 verse 11 it's a privilege for us today to be gathered together in the house of God isn't it recognizing that the Lord Jesus has promised whether this two or three gathered together in my name I will be in their midst I'll be there to speak to them and be able to to minister to their needs we're so grateful for that knowing that we've not come today just to a ritual or a routine or well just something you do one Sunday you go to church to a worshipper it's not just something you do amen it's something that you are it's a part of your your identification uh let me say this also before we read today maybe some of you probably several of you have noticed that brother Jack y hasn't been U at his post of Duty as far as Deacon and there's no no problem with brother Jack as far as that sort of thing but brother Jack's just want to take a little bit of a sabatical r rest in other words he figures that being a deacon for 40 some years he wants to rest a little bit I'm not sure why he wants to rest after 40 some years but anyway it does so m him's talked about it and brother Jack's just going to uh take a little bit of a sabatical from it and he's not resigning we're not getting nobody to replace him and there ain't no sin so don't get your old mind wondering about something like that but he just going to be on a little bit of a rest and then we'll re-evaluate it after a while as a matter of fact and I got to thinking about taking sabatical I thought man I've been preaching most of my life maybe I deserve one turned 57 last week and been preaching since I was 18 so that's a long time isn't it amen I'd like to say we appreciate all of our deacons our trustees all the officers here at the church and you know go ahead get my out there's much more to making a Church worked in the preacher that's right there's so much that goes on behind the scenes that so many people do and uh I'd like to say that we appreciate everybody that does what they do here 1 John chap 3: 11 now listen what I want to speak to you today how terrible is hate how terrible is hate 1 John 3: 11 for this is the the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous Marvel not Brethren if the world hate you we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death and whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him now this does not mean now a person who has murdered someone in sin that this is an unpardonable sin but John is saying that no murder with hate in his heart currently can have eternal life living in him may God bless his words you may be seated hate is one of the invisible sins of the heart that sometimes people can keep for years and years sometimes it can be there for decades and it can hide there are many sins of the heart of course some sins are more visible to the outside and people do them and other people notice them and see them or hear them if they're words that they say actions that they do but there are some sins that are actually sins of the heart and a person could keep it so disclosed for such a long time and hardly nobody but them and God maybe they're real close intimate family or friends would ever know that it's there now hate tends to be one of those types of sins yet there will be things that will for those who have the extreme cases of it that will be able to Manifest this hate it's sad to say but we're living in a world that is full of hate we have racial hatred we have cultural hatred we have all kinds of hatred and no matter how much that we would try to educate the people into loving one another and to being understanding and don't you know don't hate people because we're of A different race or of a different color or even of a different Creed we will never accomplish that there will be no real peace until the Prince of Peace comes back to the Earth in spite of all the education we've got more educated people on the Earth than we've ever had we've got more millionaires and more billionaires than has ever been and yet there is more hatred there is more despising of people because of you know all these different things than there's ever been no doubt on the earth because because there's more people on the Earth and yet we're we're making more sense this is not right we shouldn't do this we shouldn't do this we shouldn't do and the more we talk about it the more people do it because the power to release people from hate is not just convincing them that they shouldn't do it they must be another life which will come into them to release them from the hold that hate has on their life cuz it is a powerful emotion it is a very powerful thing that has been on the human race since after the fall of Man in the very beginning now Adam was not the originator of hate even after the fall it was not in Adam to hate it was not in Adam to murder it was not in Adam to do many of the vile things that we see that are being done in this day it was just not in him even after the fall but yet hate is a thing that can lay uh so embedded in a person's life people can hate preachers they can hate Church they can hate family members they can hate all kinds of different things and yet it can lay there and they can be so quiet about it because they learn to a degree to control it and they learn to make it almost expressionless with on the outside just in themsel it's not they Maul over it constantly but eventually it will come out because it is the type of thing that requires manifestation now what we' like to look at today is how that this can be inside of a person's heart for some people it's very visible depending on how agitated they become notice notice the words of the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5: 21 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill will be in danger of the Judgment now this is actually emerging of The Commandments that God gave to the children of Israel but it's merged with an oral tradition by the Jews now the latter part of this is actually the merging of that tradition because the Ten Commandments says one of The Commandments Thou shalt not kill but the merging of the Jewish fathers and their Traditions was whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment now Moses never said that the Torah never says it but yet they merg that into with the teaching of the law but now watch Jesus he's going to go a step further than that but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the Judgment now he has the authority because he is God God gave the Ten Commandments but here is Christ which is God's representative on the earth the Son of God as we call it and he was the one that was given Authority so he makes an amendment as it was to what God had said now why because Grace is going to magnify many things that were in the law and we know that many times people certainly of the wrong conception of Grace because they think Grace accept Grace well Grace only let you get by with more grace Grace magnifies many things now watch jesus takes it now a step further he's going to bring it to the inside of man where the law dealt more on the outside that if a man killed a man and we know of course by the uh the Avenger of blood and all that the Cities of Refuge that if a person killed another person and they did not intentionally do it then there were cities set up all over Israel and they could flee to that and there they would be able to hide but they must stay there the rest of their life life or until the death of the high priest then they would be released to go from that City of Refuge or until the Avenger of blood had died and yet it was all set up because of innocent people and to protect those that accidentally killed a man if they were working together and your axe head flew off and hit another man in the head and yet there was no grief there was no Strife between you it was proven hey this man didn't do it wrong but still he was not relieved from that he had to go to be able to live in this other city but now then it must have been actual Murder by which a person was held responsible but Grace is now coming in and with Grace is coming a magnification of the heart the intent of the heart what lays in the heart and things that can be hid in the heart that would never come out the truth of it is there are multiplied thousands times thousands of murderers that are alive in the Earth today but they've never murdered anybody because they're afraid of the law amen or they wouldn't want their name in the paper but the spirit of hatred is so firm in their hearts that in the eyes of God God would accredit murder to them now I hope you're going to listen to me and you're going to say Amen every now and then now watch the Lord Jesus he brings it he Compares verse 21 you've heard that was said by them of old time Thou shalt not killed whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment now the New Covenant what's it what it's going to do but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raaka shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hell Fire now even if you murdered a man in the Old Testament it did not NE necessarily mean that you were in danger of hail fire that you was going to go to the gehenna but here the law is now ending and Grace is coming on the earth and Grace actually brings a magnification to many of these things now you imagine this must have been overwhelming as they're hearing this so Jesus actually goes back to the murderous act being carried out from the secret which was the intent of the heart now for those that would just be moved upon in a rage you know even our law looks at the same thing whether it's homicide first degree murder second degree murder whatever it is they look at it according was it a rage of anger was it premeditated did you plan into it was it something that happened and out of a rage you just did it according if they can prove it one way or the other will be your judgment but here the Lord Jesus says for a man just to be mad at his brother without a cause and the Greek word there is very explicit and how that it says a justifiable cause not just something you get mad at somebody but if you actually get angry with your brother and if if it's over a trivial matter that really you have no right to get angry over Jesus says that you're in danger that you come in Conflict to where you can be judged now you know there was two tribunal judges given to the children of Israel and that was three rather there was three and then there was 21 and then there was 72 according to the how severe the thing was that you had done if it was a minor type thing You' go before three judges if it was more severe he'd go before 21 if it was the severest of all you'd go before the Sanhedrin which was 72 but now here Jesus brings the intent of the heart and showing that with this new covenant with Grace with Mercy with love with forgiveness with pardon with all of these things that we are required of more God does not let us get by with more because we're under grace he requires more of us but it's not more under legalism it's more from the heart because the heart is to have a new King on its throne that's right now watch he says if a man would be angry with his brother which is of course in the heart where God looks now most people may not even know that you would be angry with this man or this woman or this boy or girl but it would be what it would be a secret sin of the heart and maybe you would walk away and you'd never say anything you wouldn't lose your temper nobody would even know but yet from that it become the bursting point from that anger they hurt you feelings embarrass you they humiliated you whatever but you begin to think over it and think over it and Maul over it and on and on and on until that turn into a hatred and then you find yourself having very ill feelings and very ill thoughts toward that individual and thoughts that actually frighten you and yet nobody may not know it but you see God knows it so he looks on the very intent of the heart and that's where many problems I'm afraid friends lay and we realize that many people get overcome and they'll kill somebody or do bodily damage or injury to them and then they you know the truth is find out well really I've harbored this thing for a long long time I should have let it go I should have let it go let me tell you today do not let hate build up in your life it is contrary to God God hates sin but God loves The Sinner God it's not God's will that any should perish but that all should come to repentance no matter how mean they are how Wicked they are how vile they are that's how much he loves humanity and if we are his offspring should not we love them in the same perspective we cannot love them of course in the same quantity because he is the whole volume of eternal love but you take what measure of love that you and I have oh I want to love like God I do too but I don't have all of the Eternal realm of God's love but if you'll take my love when it buts and you'll be able to put it under a microscope and take it into a spiritual laboratory it'll have the same characteristics that Father's Love does it just won't be the same amount now so Jesus says that if a man is angry with his brother without a cause or if a man says Raa now to us this word means absolutely nothing but to the Jews now look what it means Rea is empty senseless empty-headed man a term of reproach used among the Jews in the time of Christ that was a Syriac word that came from the Syria that begin to merge into the Jewish language so it was a word that they would use to one another and there are several different examples in the historical writings of Joseph and other Jewish writers where that puts it in a setting where you can understand a little better but they would look at someone they would call them a senseless fool a blockhead you ain't got no sense you're stupid you're an idiot and yet they were not saying the truth so this is not a foolish man of course is one that we know that would lack wisdom this is not the setting by which Jesus is youing using this but it is someone out of anger someone out of hatred someone out of Vengeance that is calling people names amen well y'all sure are C already my I wonder how much name calling we doing this message that we'd be better off to stop most of it praise the lord well Glory y'all going to get quiet on me Ain you it's all right we're going to we're going to preach anyway now notice Jesus goes a step further he said I say unto you that whosoever is angry with this brother without a cause shall be in danger of the Judgment now notice in danger of the Judgment whosoever shall say to his brother Reika shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hellfire now look at this this is not saying to a people because Jesus said to those even of his disciples thou fools and slow of heart why are you so of heart to believe but Jesus is using the same word in a total different application now notice what the word would mean in in this day if you were there and hear Jesus say that so it comes from the Greek word nabal which is a wicked reprobate destitute of all spiritual or Divine knowledge in other words it would be a name that we would attach to people that we don't like or people that we disagree with and we strip them of absolutely all Christianity we take away from them they're not even Justified they're not even saved they don't even know nothing about God and when we do that to individual we are in danger of Hell ourselves why we're moving in the place of God Amen now just because a person's an error or they would disagree with you or I it doesn't mean you're not a Christian it doesn't mean that God hasn't done a work in their heart but Jesus is showing they showing that the extremity by which people can grow in hatred and the extremity that they would Express this and become so vinant that they would actually deny any work of God in this individual's life in other words God has not done one thing for you you're nothing you are worthless God's never saved you God's never Sanctified you now what you're doing you're taking into your hands and you're becoming God and now you're judging God himself and you're saying God has done nothing for that individual When God says yes I have too woo oh my for a man any man to decide and say you are worthless don't you see friend whenever we would move to this degree then we are presuming to look at this person's soul and say you are not savable you are not even worth fooling with there's only one being that knows that and that's God now we might say if people continue to go on as they are they're going to wind up in hell that's one thing but for you to say this individual that IND indidual or me to say that individual is serpent see there ain't none of us know that there's one person that knows and we get in trouble when we go to attaching names and certain things to people and speaking out their Destiny when we don't even know our own we believe by faith by grace through faith we're saved you sure don't know anybody else's oh my Jesus says under the law you had to literally kill a man but in my kingdom anger in the heart to such a severity I will judge it as murder now look at the letter part of this verse I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the Judgment whosoever shall teach his brother Rea shall be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hell Fire now look at this Hellfire the Greek is the gehenna of fire the term gehenna arose from the valley of henm which is south of Jerusalem where the Canaanites burned human sacrifices to molok after the return of the Jews from the Captivity they made it a place of defilement where they The Refuge of the city was strong and burnt bur garbage done now up to this time when the the ancient he Heathen Canaanites they offered human sacrifice in the valley of geham or hen so it become this word of gehen so Jesus says that whenever a person would say this and go to this degree with her brother I can't you see he is identifying that the two are in the same move this is a brother so they're in the same move and they're confessing the same thing but one gets it odds with the other and then that one which is at such odds will totally strip the other one of anything toward God at all they're lost they're a devil they're a Judas they're a serpent seed friends we're walking on Dangerous Ground when we do that now you know have to raise your hand but I want you to look back and think about your lives when folks have crossed you how many times have we been guilty of doing such things now there is a place to where you move from attacking that individual to where you are attacking the work of God in that individual's life and when you're saying they are serpent seed and yet their name might be on the Lamb's Book of Life so you're saying one thing and God's saying something else just because they're living this way now don't mean they'll be doing that tomorrow in 24 hours they could be repented of everything they said and then what about you said about them the day before well praise the Lord now watch this Jesus turns and speaks to the Jews in St John 8: 38 I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father now keep this in mind now he's the only one that could be able to speak words so personal not generic now I could say that in a generic way but when I go to putting names and you are your father the devil you're of your father of the devil you're your I have no right to do any such thing unless the spirit of God would reveal to man I hope he never does cuz I don't want to know who's saved and who is lost but preaching it in generic terms so where it would be if people continue on this way and if they do this and this and this they're going to be lost we can say it that way but to say that any of us know another's individual Destiny we are lying right but it just so happened Jesus knew I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father uhoh here we go now I realize this would could be considered hate speech today but you and I believe it's the anointed words of God they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said unto them if Abra if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now ye seek to kill me now who are these people robbers Bandits Highwaymen priests Levites Jews praise the Lord you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham if y'all are Abraham's kids you sure are acting a lot different than him now if we claim to be the progeny of this message are we acting the same way the messenger brought in the same Spirit he brought it in now you see this thing of murdering and killing did not just surface itself here in St John 8 it was something that be to brood among the Pharisees and the scribes and all of them for quite some time it was something that might have been very very secret in their hearts but then it became very vocal now watch they're going to prove who their father is by the manifestation of the direction that they're going watch this in Matthew chapter 26 verse 59 now the chief priests and elders and all the councel sought false witness against Jesus to put him to death now remember no murderer has eternal life abiding in him now it was not the radicals it was not the because Jesus was tur up all the prostitute houses it was not all the beer makers and all the scotch makers and they're against Jesus cuz Jesus is preaching against whiskey and alcohol but it was the chief priest and the Sanhedrin and the counsel all the great religious leaders of the day but now their hate for Jesus has moved into this open vicious cycle that they are seeking to kill him I don't want to alarm you don't want to shock you there's folks in the message it's exactly the same way Matthew 271 and when the morning was come all the chief priests and Elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death now if the leaders is doing that you can imagine what the L folks is going to do Mark 14:1 after two days and the Feast of Passover of unle bread and the chief priest and the scribes sought how they might take him by Craft remember the word subtlety the serpent was the most subtle of all the Beast of the field part of the characteristics of the word subtle is craftiness now hear the nature of their father is being reflected into them by the way they're going about doing it and the ultimate goal is to kill Jesus Christ amen why hatred hatred St John 12:10 but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death now Lazarus is a walking Miracle right Jesus raised him from the dead and there's a lot of folks around in the community that knew it he was a walking miracle and now they want to kill a walking Miracle not only the miracle maker can't you understand why the devil hates you if you're a child of God he not only hates the miracle maker he hates the miracle he hates the supernatural that God Is Right in your life oh my you might question me on this Theology and I might not have the answer you might question me on this point of Doctrine I might not have the answer but if you want to know am I a miracle I have the answer yes sir I may not be able to explain this date and line this up with this and that up with that but I know one thing I have been changed by the power of God I have been changed and I not only me but there's hundreds sitting here this morning that are Miracles that have been changed by the power of [Applause] God all poor old Lazarus done was just got up he wasn't trying to cause no Revolt he wasn't doing nothing I mean he just laying under the grave rotten nose done fell in him and he wouldn't bother nobody just causing a stink was all but yet here they are they're hat it is so grown now notice starts out with Jesus and now it goes beyond Jesus and it goes to those that are recipients of his miracles remember in St John nine when the man that was healed had been blind for all those years and they come and said hey get away from Jesus don't have nothing to do with him said this man's a sinner he said this is a marvelous thing whether he's a sinner or not I don't know but this one thing I do know whereas I was buying now I see now I save and they said any man that confesses that Jesus is a prophet or whatever more will show out so they asked his mom and daddy hey your son's in the message what do you think about it I'm afraid he's messed up I don't know what to think about him anymore you know why they feared the Jews they saw they saw how this anger was vented toward anybody this St but Jesus Christ friends let me tell you something I thank God for a coming Rapture because I realize if it wasn't for the rapture we would be the very first ones killed in the tribulation period my goodness if the wants to get out to the foolish virgin and there's nothing compared to the elect bride can you imagine the anger he would vent towards you oh my but the Lord Jesus won't allow him Hallelujah he'll catch away his bride this able will not be killed at K's [Applause] [Music] alar watch this back to St John 8:41 Jesus says you do the deed of your father yes sir then said they to him they kind of agreed together and know we'll burn his head we be not born of fornication your mother was with with child with you for her and Joseph was ever married we know your background you illegitimate thing you born in forn he only married her to save her hi she was a rotten that means you're an illegitimate excuse me for saying this way bastard that's what the Bible calls it and you out here trying to tell us something we're not born in fornication like you are we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love [Applause] me may I take the words of Jesus and say that to you if God is your father no matter how much you differ with me you will love me you can't hate me and be a Christian no way now you might not agree with my ways you might not agree way I bring this that that is nothing to do with me if I'm wrong then your great love will love me and pray for me that you cannot hate me or anyone else if God is your [Applause] father if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded force and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word now Jesus is very politically correct right Jesus didn't want to hurt nobody's feelings right ye are of your father the devil oh my Lord now remember he could say that as an individual personalization of this and look right done inside of their soul and know this Truth for you and I to say this as an individual generically in a group we might can say people that do this and this and this and this but for us to look at people's soul and their Destiny and say they're of the devil none of us have that right to do so well praise the Lord now in all reality if you would have looked at me before I got saved and I would look at you before you got saved I can in all reality say your nature is of the your father the devil your body might been of a dire or Reagan or a walker or whatever more but your nature was contaminated and evil and you were by Nature children of wraths even as others I'd love if I could have been to stand there and watching the disciples you imagine how embarrassing that some of Jesus sermons must have been for them and one place Jesus said said some pretty strong words and J and then they come and said Lord don't you know you offended them and Jesus said oh I'm so sorry I probably shouldn't have said that cuz we' have got a bigger offering forgive me Jesus said ever plant my father is I planted will be rooted up now watch you are of your father the devil now Jesus is going to teach us that in this that Satan is a fallen being he will show us two great points of this about Satan in that originally he was in the truth and then he fell from the truth which is how he became a fallen being in that he went from one extreme to another Isaiah says Thou Art the anointed cherub and I have set thee so he was the protector through the Throne of God if any other inferior angel came to approach the throne of God they must come through the protector the original Archangel of God so he was the one who protected the Cherub he protected God's presence and God's Throne this was his original position but he fell from that as the protector of Truth unto the the very opposite to become the father of Lies now this is how far he went friends don't be amazed when folks backside away from the word and how in 6 months time or even less they can turn from one going this way to go that way the very thing they loved and would give their life for now they hate it vinant can't you say why now notice Jesus says you're of your father the devil you have the temper the disposition the nature the maker now not this not seed wise as far as genetic reproduction if they' have had DNA in that day they could have took their DNA and rent it all the way back to Abraham of course so could Ishmael so could Esau you are influenced by him you imitate him you are therefore his children my my I wonder what Peter was doing about now bomu you know the others that were more tender and gentle looking for a place to run these are the main men of the move of the day be like going to the religious headquarters and just saying y'all are the devil y'all doing the lust of your daddy the devil notice in St John 838 Jesus verifies it again I speak that which I have seen with my father you do that which you have seen with your father now then in verse 44 it says you're of your father the devil and the lust of your father the desires or the Wishes the lust notice how one they were you know what makes this so amazing to me if people can be so in unison with the devil that they fulfill his lusts cannot the people of God be in such Unison with the Lord God that they do his wants not lust cuz he don't have lust but if people can be in such harmony with God that what Satan lust for people actually carry out they're living out his lusts my if Sinners can do that and church people can do that to the devil I want to turn around and be the opposite and say my father let me do do your will let me do what you want me to do oh my the lust of your father notice Jesus now having the ability to look at their Destiny and their soul and see where they come from and say it prophetically the lust of your father you will do there's no question about it you're going to do it you're going to kill me as Cain killed Abel at his altar so will you kill me at my altar amen Lord Jesus you're of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning amen now who was it that he killed who did Satan kill whenever he failed and we know that the battle in heaven with the angels took place actually before the foundation of the world before the Earth was ever created the universe it expanded into the universe Satan made his fall then but he didn't kill Angels but yet Jesus calls him here and says that he was a murderer from the beginning how who who did he kill what did he do now look at this in the sense of through his son he murdered Abel but yet he was a murderer before then he was a murderer in the beginning when time had broke down out of Eternity and come down on this planet called Earth and when God had placed his children in the Garden of Eden to walk by his provision of his love and grace then Satan's desire was to be able to receive them and lead them into what death how would you like to stand before God at the white Throne judgment and answer for the death of every human being that ever lived on this Earth there was no death until Satan introduced it right now watch Jesus calls him a murderer from the beginning a murder so his first work on the earth to try to intercept Adam and Eve's position and bring them to a spot of what death not only inject himself into the human race and we know that was one of his plans but he wants to bring death he's the only one that can Institute it death is not what God wanted for anyone but Satan is the one who wanted to bring death so God actually he the Lord Jesus and he attribut Satan to being a murderer from the beginning Lord Jesus God had said in Genesis 2:7 and the day you eat thereof that day you shall die but God did not give the channel God did not give the means was not necessary all God needed to do is give a warning notice the devil deceived them first parents and they became subject to death now Jesus said he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth now he was in the truth he Abode not in the truth so he was in the truth and chose to leave the truth God didn't make him stay no more than a will me or you if we want to leave that's entirely up to us but we will suffer the consequences if we do now he Abode not in the truth so then once he left the truth he became deprived of all of the good and godly attributes which were in him in the beginning now the the book of Isaiah tells us again that thou was created perfect till iniquity was found in thee now iniquity is not a seed of creation that God planted in him like a virus on a computer that on a certain day at 12:01 in the morning you know that thing would kick in it is not that way that would make God the author or the creator of sin but he placed Satan on on the ability of having a soul where he could choose right from wrong what he wanted to do and Satan by his own choice decided to leave the truth he decided to leave the Pavilion of God's headship he decided to leave his most noble great position and remember he was the great outstanding cherub and him and Michael broke out in a war in heaven and when he fell away from the truth and he changed from being this Godly character of a creative being which was not given to him of course by by by labor and all that that you and I have but it was given to him by creation so his power his Persona his everything that he was that God had created in him but it was created for a season created to have a terminating Point by which that point could turn and he could go the other way it was not Eternal it was not Eternal yet thou was created perfect until iniquity was found in thee oh anointed cheriff I have set thee so and yet one day he makes up in his mind this is the origination of sin it did not began in the Garden of Eden it did not begin with a serpent but sin actually began in heaven in the heart of a great [Music] Angel and it began with what television station was it what television station did Satan have in his heart what cigarette what fifth of whiskey uh unbelief Pride arrogance that's the base root of sin friends oh my and he had all these Godly holy things but once he chose to not abide in the truth and he moves over here into another realm the beginning or the establishment of a new kingdom than all of these good holy Godly things that were created in him for a season now they are all forfeited amen now he becomes a murderer amen now at one time he worshiped oh ad elov all these wonderful things that he did now he looks at God and say I hate you I hate you I'll get you I'll destroy you and if I can't get you I'll get your kids I hate you come on isin't it amazing people that can love you so much this week hate you so much next week you see where that Spirit comes from amen God Don't Love You hat hate you this week and then love you next week and love you next week and hate you next week as a matter of fact God don't hate God hates sin but God does not hate individuals praise the Lord now watch it then Satan Abode not in the truth so he was deprived of all good which was given to him by the creative hand of God now Jesus says he Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him now notice though he's in the truth while he's there in the presence of God but he has a created position it's not that the allocation of that position was given to him by virtue of his own character but it was created in him we may vote a person into to be a politician of being this and that and the other and we have you know we have confidence in them that they will do this and so and thus and so but we really don't know what they'll do till they get in the position and then once they get in the position then they turn why because many of them never had that character in the first place of honesty and integrity or if they did have it they thought it was better to be corrupt instead of really being a true politician now Satan never had that Godly character within himself but Michael is different whoa glory to God many of these other angels of God the elect angels of God they were totally different they did not just have a created position and that was subject to loss don't you see how people can be saved and they can be saved for many years and wind up going to hell why because they was given something that was not part of who they were but the elect of God they're not giv something that's separate from who they are they're giving themselves Hallelujah they are giv what they are the [Applause] word if you're given something that is not you you can lose it if you're giv something something that is not part of who you are you can lose it but if you are giv yourself how can you ever lose yourself if you're given part of your identity and the word how can that ever be taken from you Lord Now watch how Jesus strips him down I'm imagine the devil must have been fighting mad about in the middle of this verse he had never been disclosed like this before Jesus says it was a murder from the beginning and ab bod not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own oh my goodness own the word own is plural and it means of the things that appropriate to him or belong to his nature so when he speaketh of a lie he speaketh of his own nature God don't deceive God Don't Lie God don't doing those things but Satan loves to why that's what he is a liar I want you to think now who is it that ties to talk you out of all your Victory a liar who is that tries to tell you God don't love you a liar who is that tried to tell you you ain't going to make the Rapture a liar and a murderer why do you even listen to him I don't understand why in the world we even give him the time of day he is a liar he is a murderer he is a deceiver he don't care for you he hates you and it's all right for you to hate the [Applause] devil oh my goodness you imagine these priests are standing there oh Lord they didn't even have blood pressure pill in them days I can't imagine how they were so upset you're of your father the devil and the lust of your father you'll do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth now remember he ain't just talking about the devil but is epitomizing them by describing their father you understand this is what made him so mad oh my oh he said because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie speaketh of his own for he is a liar a liar every lie that was ever told ow it owes its origination to Satan amen I challenge every person that's in under the sound of my voice today if you get absolutely nothing else out of what I speak get this one simple principle in your mind Satan is a liar his credibility has been known for thousands of years to be a liar walk out of these doors today with one simple thing in your heart Satan is is a liar but God is truth so why listen to a liar and not listen to truths now watch Jesus he is a liar and the father of it the first lie that was ever told was told by him every lie that's ever been told since comes from his alarp now once then as John picks this up in 1 John 3:12 he said not his Kain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and remember John was standing there when Jesus was preaching these words to the scribes and the Pharisees and Sadducees it was already believed among the Jews before Jesus ever preached it that Cain was of the serpent but probably the understanding wasn't quite as clear till Jesus came and really took the cover off now here John is going to go a step further as Cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother now let's look at this word slw it means to slay Slaughter butcher to put to death by violence mortally wounded the word John used in this place properly means slaughtered and butchered by cutting the throat or the jugler notice the violence notice how he moves into this it's as if though another being has got a hold of him that's right he's not just killing him to get rid of him he is butchering him yes he is and where did this hatred start in church let's catch the setting of it they were taught by their mother and father when they come out of the Garden of Eden that it was fruit Prophet tells us that several places maybe one day Abel was out there and he was thinking about going to church and offering a sacrifice to God and he thought what should I take should I take blueberries or raspberries or apples or pomegranates or what should I take I love God was all in my heart and I want to please him amen and all of a sudden Abel was Smoked by divine revelation and the voice of God either spoke to him or showed it time en Vision abble it wasn't apples you were born in your mother's Blood by your father's blood it was sex able but that's not what they've taught you wrong they haven't told you all the truth Abel boy you folks are quiet don't you remember that sermon I preached many many years ago my father taught me wrong oh God but Lord if so you me I I've got I've got to take this this lamb to church but when I want past my mama and my daddy they'll know I know yeah so you imagine imagine Adam and Eve in church and they're worshiping praising God here comes Abel which Eve named him Abel and a lesser name that she named Cain she named Cain acquisition appointed one I've got from the Lord an able as worthless or one of not as much value so naturally he wouldn't have much sway anyhow but here he comes to church yes and God revealed to him get a grape vine and tie around its neck so he gets the grap Vine and he ties around the Lamb's neck and Yuri comes dragging it to church and Eve looks at Adam and Adam looks at did you tell him no I never told him how did he know to get a lamb he wasn't there that day when God come down and kill a lamb and but are you sure you didn't tell him I promise I never told him nothing God says I told [Applause] him I told him he's mine I'm obligated to tell him so here he comes that little [Music] L here's Kane waiting his turn he has all of his fruits his vegetables he's labored he's sincerely labored over and worked over here comes Abel tears out of his eyes oh Jehovah Jehovah Adam and Eve stand there mix emotions how are we going to explain this I don't have no idea how did he found out I don't know it must have been God told him Lord since it was only me and you and God there had to be God but Abel was so caught up in the Revelation he didn't pay no attention to the whispers [Applause] so by Revelation he reaches down builds his alar grabs a little lamp lays it down on the alar I don't [Music] eloh eloh yah oh yah takes the sharp [Music] Rock the hot blood spewing out of his neck all over his hands yeah his arms the Lamb's wo bathed in Blood and over here stands his half brother yes you smart ell no you think you're something don't you why can't you just be like everybody else why do you always have to be so different he stands there and say I don't know Elohim ad and all of a sudden inspiration strikes him and he feels to move back and give a little space and when he does a pillar of fire comes down and Strikes the altar burns up the sacrifice goes back up into heaven I don't I I don't I I don't I hallu he just backs over and sits down weeps shakes Quivers amen he heard his lamb dying speaking in tongues he still got that blood on him he smells it physically it's almost making him sick but it isn't that that makes him sick it's the acknowledgement of his sin he was born after the fall but now it's kan's turn and he comes to church with an attitude he don't like the music this is too loud he don't like this he don't like that bless God I'm they fixing to run the church my way I'm fixing to bust it [Music] up but you imagine he's anger he's hat hated hating able but he comes and he brings all of his fruits he comes down he kind of has a change you know like a hypocrite does kind of changes and oh he's mow sincere and so much drama lays the cantaloupes here and the Watermelons there and the pomegranates and the apples and the lies and the flowers and my just takes so much time able still God thank [Music] you thank you praise the Lord but that Revelation also showed him who his half brother was for the first time in his life now he understands why he looks so different and acts so different and has a different temperament amen but Cain just kind of lays it aside for a little bit goes his ritual do all the things that he does praise calls on adoni Elohim Jehovah all these great terms that he was taught since a child and he waits for the pit of fire but there's no move no move of God no peep from Heaven no matter no sound no wind nothing so he has to walk away from church without divine Vindication what he does you imagine looking at Abel you you had to show off didn't you little smart Alec God come to him later and said Cain what's wrong yes right if thou doest well will not thou be accepted if not sin crouth at the door yes that's a wild Savage Beast the Jews say that Cain spoke to Abel a few weeks thereafter and said he said let's go out into the field that we may talk and as he pulled him out into the field then his Vengeance begin to grow and his hatred begin to boil and he picks up a rock first and hits him in the head addles him then he takes another and he takes one with a sharp edge and cuts his throat acting out what he saw able do to his lamb he butchered he butchered his brother I hope you can receive it right the butcher already started on his altar in church Lord Jesus let me close not as Cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him what was the cause what was the reason what was the occasion John answers himself because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous let me read to you a couple of commentators so you'll see we're not the only strange ones down through time that have believe some of these things his work the sacrifice which he offered up which though it was not evil to the matter and substance yet was so being being offered by an evil mind with a hypocritical heart and without faith in the sacrifice of Christ was unacceptable to God John Gil 1684 and wherefor slew he him what could induce a brother to dip his hands into his brother's blood when his brother was righteous and he was wicked and the seed of the wicked one which was in him and induced him to destroy his brother because the seed of God the divine nature was found in him Adam Clark the difference between Cain's offering and Abel's offering was faith and faith is always based on the revelation of God it seems clear that God God must have given definite instructions concerning how he was to be worshiped and Cain rejected God's word and decided to Worship in his own way that shows his relationship to Satan for Satan is always interested in turning people away from the revealed will of God the devil's ye hath God said Genesis 3:1 was the beginning of trouble for king's parents yeah and all of mankind we are not told by what out sign the Lord accepted Abel's sacrifice and rejected Caines it may be that he sent fire from heaven to consume Abel's sacrifice of an animal and its blood but we are told the results Abel went away from the altar with God's witness of Acceptance in his heart Lord Jesus this is what we want but Cain went away angry and disappointed but God warned Kain that sin was crouching at the door like a dangerous beast but promise if Cain would obey God like Abel did he would enjoy peace instead of heeding God's warning Cain listen to Satan's voice and plotted to kill his brother out of what hatred his Envy was turned to anger and hatred he knew that he was evil and that his brother was righteous rather than repent as God commanded him to do he decided to destroy his brother centuries later the Pharisees did the same thing to Jesus and Jesus called them two children of the devil Satan is the prince of this world and he controls it through murder and lies how horrible to live on the same level as Satan the Bible Exposition commentary Matthew pool 1600s and when he was more devil likee than such a temper as C's was whose hatred was of his brother break out into actual murder upon no other account because his brother was better than he which showed him to be of the wicked one of the serpent seed I plan on seeing brother Matthew P in the Rapture Cain love not as Cain who s he could love God but he could hate his brother yes sir and be acceptable how can a man say he loves God whom he has not seen and hate his brother whom he has seen Stand Together 1 John 3:14 we know that we have pass pass from Death un life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother Abid Us in death he that love us not his brother abideth in death this is my affirmation out of this I will not hate people I will hate sin I will hate wrong and I will stand against it till the day I die but I will hate no individuals though they differ with me as far as the East is from the West I will even watch and guard the way I turn my dislike you know brother R said it this way said you might say I sure don't like brother Neville I sure don't like this brother or that brother he said but you let something happen to that brother amen and he said it breaks your heart right cuz you stood at the table of the Lord together he said here and took communion and broke bread and that is your brother right to me that is the balance perfect love will never make all of us love one another's ways I don't even like all my own ways how am I going to like yours come on be honest you're deceived if you like all your ways if you think everything about you is so Crist out you need to you need to come back up and let let me pray for you we don't like our own ways many of them much less other people's ways but perfect love helps us to look beyond that and look at what God is doing and not say Reika to that brother or thou fool you're not even saved you don't even have the Holy GH you're not even part of this message friend we're saying dangerous stuff amen and the sarcasm that goes into and that that spirit that can get on us can do just like it did John it'll go right back to the word you want us to call fire down to Heaven that's what Elijah done uhoh what have we done we've done some of the same things Jesus did we've turned and called people you're your father the devil that's what Jesus said bless God I can do the same thing not unless you know exactly that they are you see what we've done and enmity and anger and hatred and we've hid behind scriptural examples for TR to call a man a senseless fool and say God has done nothing in your life you know nothing about God but I wonder what God would say about that man God might have up a construction sign on the outside under construction Chief Architect God chief designer God Chief Builder God you're ripping down the under construction sign you say you're going to hell and God said no he ain't he's mine he may not be where I want him to be but he's on his way and I'm going to fulfill it I'm convinced most of us would be so much better off if we'd do probably about 98% less talking be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to rest I'm figuring out more and more and more why brother B said the apostles were men a few words how many foolish things have I said said how many foolish things have you said well some of you nodded I guess the rest of you thought all of yours was okay God help us am God help us how many wants help today me too let's pray together Lord Jesus these are serious matters Lord It's matters of the heart it's even more serious Lord than physical needs a person may be here today with something devastating going on their body and we could pray for them they could be healed and yet next week Satan would attack them in another way so they can get healed and get sick and get healed and get sick but if we can ever move into that realm of Eternity there's no turning back we're yours forever doesn't mean that we automatically go into that full statue but it means we're on our way and there'll be no turning back lord I pray you'd forgive me today no doubt I have said in my short span of life that I've been allowed to live on this Earth no doubt I have said some very foolish things no doubt I have charged people wrong no doubt I've presented truths even in the wrong way I ask you to forgive me for anything that I have misrepresented or said about any person forgive me Lord help us I pray Lord Jesus each of us to be more more aware of what we say how we say it how it comes out of our mouths and to know that out of the heart you said out of the heart precedes murder and adultery fornications all these things it begins in the secrets of the Heart Lord search each of us from the front to the back may your Holy Spirit I pray bring us face to face with ourselves if there's anybody here today that hates anyone deliver them Lord but I know in order for us to be delivered we have to be willing to be delivered help us to understand maybe the mere conception of what we think hatred is many of us would think it'd be a man going in somebody else's house and killing them or a man raping a woman or killing a child or running over someone that that's the extremity of it but yet whenever John chose the Greek word to use for hatred a man that doesn't love his brother he chose a compound word which meant just didn't love them and then the extremity of that one that would try to do them character damage or bodily damage help us to see Lord God when we don't love someone that is put under the same category as hate and we know love has degrees there's no way we're going to look at the world out here and the way they live and act and do and love them with the same degree of love that we will love saints of God and yet Lord I took car as I was going home last night it's amazing that sometimes we can get along better was people of the world than we people of the faith and she said yeah I can see that cuz them we saying well they don't know no difference they hurt us they do us wrong whatever and we're more forgiving sometimes of them than we are our brothers but Lord Jesus we know the real test of Christianity is herein shall men know that you are my disciples not because you love the world not because you're understanding with Sinners but because you love your brothers you knew what you were saying you knew that'd be one of the greatest challenges that would face us as human beings totally impossible for us to achieve to it but what's impossible with us is possible with you help each of us today Lord can we just raise our hands children we have our hands raised Lord God in your presence I say to you today Lord and I'm not ashamed to say it before these people and people that are hear this service all different parts of the world I'm not ashamed to say I need a greater depth of Love Lord I need to grow I need to grow I don't want to just grow and understanding of deep things I want to grow in love Lord I don't want to hate I've never been a violent mean type of a person anyway but Lord a person can be a very humble so-called thought to be person and still Harbor hatred in their heart which is the beding ground or the cradle for murder help us Lord Jesus if a man can look on a woman and lust after her and commit adultery in her heart yet never touch her his wife may never know it the woman's husband may never know it nobody ever know it but you know it and you attribute it to being adultery in his heart then a person can hate from their heart and really have the same influence to murder in their heart nobody might not know it but you know it Lord search our hearts search our hearts for anything that's contrary Lord no wonder David said it so many many years ago his prayer and Psalms about his secret sins Lord Jesus it's not all the time conniving and sneaking around and hiding behind closed doors necessarily but it's those things that's there that nobody knows but us and you Lord Jesus no wonder this is the Capstone no wonder this is the finale of the whole thing love Hallelujah Lord Jesus oh we worship you Lord God thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah say this with me Saints I will I will attain to attain to perfect love perfect love I will I will have perfect love have perfect love before the Rapture Glory that ain't just words if

begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but should have everlasting life 1 John 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God because laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren John 3:16 was said before the cross 1 John 3:16 was written after the cross amen so the effect can take place that now Cain Cain killed his brother but Jesus come to die for his now when Jesus love come in us then guess what we would die for our brothers why would we find that hard to believe how many of you have got family who died in the service to have the liberty for our country Navy Army seals whatever it was patriotism they died for their country have you they died for their country I had a first cousin who was killed in Vietnam many of you have had uncles and this and that and the other and they gave their life for their country when a plague breaks out doctors and nurses risk their own life to go in among sick when they might be contaminated themselves and they risk their own life to try to save Humanity why they really called to do that a captain it is part of his endowment and his responsibility that he will stay on that ship if he's the very last one to save the life of his crew and the people that's on that ship what if a captain would do that what about us for our brothers you love him you love one another you love one another you love one
