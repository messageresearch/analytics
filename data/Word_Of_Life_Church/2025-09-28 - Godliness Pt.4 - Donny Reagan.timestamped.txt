[8:28] blessing from being here. We're going to
[8:29] be hearing a song from one of our
[8:31] visitors here just in a little bit.
[8:33] Brother Matt Garrett, I believe you'll
[8:34] bless your heart. And all of our
[8:37] streamers are locally and around the
[8:39] world. We want to say God bless those
[8:40] folks as well. Let's give our visitors
[8:42] and our streamers a real good hand this
[8:45] morning.
[8:48] Praise the Lord. Well, we had a good

[8:52] You appreciate the word of the Lord. It
[8:53] gets better all the time, doesn't it?
[8:55] Amen. We say that, but I I mean that.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; It really does. I want to look at our
[9:00] prayer request this morning. Brother
[9:01] Brad Gilbert in severe pain. Uh lower
[9:06] back all the way down in his legs. Just
[9:09] can't get any relief whatsoever. and
[9:11] he's really asking that we would
[9:13] remember him in prayer, that God will be
[9:16] mindful of him. Uh, Brother Rocky uh
[9:19] called me yesterday, wanted me to turn
[9:21] in a prayer request for Sister Teresa uh
[9:24] going to Knoxville on Tuesday for uh
[9:27] different tests and they're just
[9:29] checking some things out on on her
[9:31] behalf. So, we want to remember her as
[9:33] we pray that the Lord would be mindful.
[9:35] Brother Greg Robbins says he wants to
[9:37] thank the Lord and the prayers of his
[9:39] saints. He had his surgery and is not
[9:42] having any pain at all and he wants to
[9:45] thank the Lord for that. So, praise God.
[9:47] Chase Hughes says, "Prayers for my niece
[9:50] Gabby. Been having seizures." They're
[9:52] asking that we would remember her as we
[9:54] pray. Want to pray for Adam Wampler
[9:56] having a lot of health problems. Brother
[9:58] Dan Hughes sends that in. We just commit
[10:01] that to the Lord. And this is a
[10:04] testimony of healing from Sister Caitlyn
[10:06] Gagnan. Uh as she's going through her uh
[10:11] pregnancy, had a lot of just a lot of
[10:13] complications, a lot of things going on.
[10:16] But she she was prayed for on Wednesday
[10:19] night. But Friday when she went back to
[10:21] the doctor, she had zero symptoms. She
[10:24] wants to thank you for your prayers and
[10:26] ask you to continue to pray for a safe
[10:29] delivery. Amen. Praise the Lord. God's
[10:32] good, isn't he? We thank the Lord for
[10:35] that. Praise the Lord. This Ruth Louise
[10:37] Jackson is requesting prayer for
[10:39] healing, asking for prayer for a group
[10:41] of young ladies in her area. So, let's
[10:43] remember that. Tiffany Mark said, "I
[10:45] would appreciate your prayers in regards
[10:47] to my job situation. The Lord knows all
[10:50] about it and may his will be done."
[10:53] And we have another prayer request for
[10:55] brother Brad Gilbert. Can you please
[10:56] continue to keep me in prayer? Aphib has
[10:59] been going on for over a week. May the

[11:15] treated for. He just asking that we
[11:17] would continue to remember him in prayer
[11:20] that the Lord would just be mindful.
[11:22] Just asking he he says that thank you
[11:24] for your prayers. They are appreciated
[11:26] very very much. So, we certainly want to
[11:28] remember brother Glenn in prayer as we
[11:30] pray.
[11:32] A man by the name of Tyler, 28-year-old,
[11:35] has a tumor uh on his right ear, just
[11:38] been married for four months. They're
[11:39] asking that we would remember that
[11:41] prayer request. Sister Barbara Grabley's
[11:43] relative that was involved in a
[11:45] motorcycle accident, got to come home,
[11:48] still having some issues with his
[11:49] hearing, but the doctors are calling it
[11:52] a miracle. So, we want to thank the Lord
[11:54] for that. And we have an urgent prayer
[11:56] request for Robbie Garland. That's
[11:59] sister Sandy Bagget's brother. This
[12:02] really, really needs a touch from the
[12:04] Lord. You know, you get to a place in
[12:06] your life that uh you can do all you can
[12:10] do, but ultimately it's in God's hands.
[12:13] And we want to just put Robbie in God's
[12:15] hands. God's able to fix everything
[12:17] that's wrong. Do you believe that this
[12:18] morning? You have an unspoken prayer
[12:20] request, something you'd like for this
[12:22] group to pray about. Let's sing a little
[12:24] bit more of that song. Give me another
[12:25] verse of that, Brother Harry. We go to
[12:27] the rock. Aren't you glad we've got a
[12:29] source to go to? Somebody say, "Praise
[12:32] the Lord." Give him another good hand
[12:34] clap of praise this morning.
[12:38] Where do I hide?
[12:42] Till the storms are all passed over.
[12:47] to
[12:50] when the winds of sorrow threaten. Is
[12:54] there a refuge? Hallelujah.
[12:58] In this time of tribulation,
[13:02] when my soul needs consolation, brother
[13:06] John.
[13:08] Oh, I go to the rock of my salvation.
[13:14] I go to the stone the builder rejected.
[13:18] Run to the mountain where the mountain
[13:25] the earth all around me is sinking sand.

[13:52] Father, we certainly do appreciate you,
[13:55] Lord.
[13:56] Father, it's so good to know that we
[14:00] have a place that we can go to, Father.
[14:03] That we know your name and you're right
[14:05] there, Lord, and you care about us,
[14:07] Lord.
[14:08] heard so many testimonies this morning,
[14:10] Father, of of how you've come on the
[14:12] scene, Lord. And we know that anything
[14:15] good in our life, Lord, whether we
[14:18] perceive it as good or not, is it comes
[14:20] from you, Lord, because we're in your
[14:21] hands. We we so thank you and we love
[14:24] you for it, Lord. There's no one like
[14:27] you. There's no way, Lord Jesus, that I
[14:30] would ever want to walk away from you,
[14:32] Lord. And I know that's the desire of
[14:33] the people, Father. We're so thankful
[14:35] for for you, Lord, and we love you. We
[14:38] thank you for the testimonies, Lord. And
[14:40] not only the testimonies we heard, Lord,
[14:42] but the ones that we will hear, Father.
[14:45] We believe, Lord Jesus, that you have a
[14:47] mighty hand. And you're really concerned
[14:49] about every one of us, Lord. And Father,
[14:52] not only for healing of our bodies, but
[14:54] also spiritual healing, Lord, and
[14:56] healing of the mind, Lord Jesus, and
[14:58] financial healing. Whatever the people
[15:00] have need of, Lord, you're mindful of
[15:01] it, Lord. We lift it up and we we give
[15:03] you all the praise and the honor and the
[15:05] glory, Lord. And Lord Jesus, we're here
[15:08] to hear to to be healed, Lord, maybe
[15:10] more spiritually, Father, and and we
[15:12] want to hear from you today, Lord. And
[15:14] we're we're counting and fully
[15:16] believing, Lord Jesus, that that you hid
[15:19] in a gift, Lord Jesus. And that gift is
[15:22] the Holy Spirit, Lord. And I pray that
[15:24] you would just speak to us, each and
[15:26] every one, Lord. We love you. We thank
[15:28] you for it. Be with each and every part
[15:30] of this service. We give you all the
[15:31] praise and the glory in Jesus name.
[15:34] Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John. God bless you.

[15:39] come at this time, we'll receive the
[15:41] morning tithe and offering. You give us
[15:43] unto the Lord once again if you're
[15:44] visiting. God bless you. We're so glad
[15:46] to have you. Let's sing a song this
[15:48] morning. We like I like to I like to
[15:49] help brother Harry and I know you do too
[15:51] sing this song. When the reason that I'm
[15:53] standing stands in front of me. Going to
[15:56] be quite an event, isn't it? Amen. Let's
[15:59] sing about it.
[16:01] I have stood before the gospel
[16:05] when it seemed I stood alone
[16:09] through the heartache and frustration.
[16:13] Kept my focus on the throne.
[16:17] So many times I have recalled the
[16:21] Savior's word so true.
[16:24] If you won't be ashamed of me, I won't
[16:29] be you. So I'll proudly
[16:34] stand until I see
[16:37] [Applause]
[16:39] the face of the one who gave everything
[16:45] for me.
[16:48] When the reason that I'm standing
[16:53] stands in front of me,
[16:56] every battle that I fought will fade
[17:00] from memory.
[17:05] I'll bow before his mighty throne and
[17:09] fall down on my knees.
[17:14] When the reason that I'm standing
[17:20] stands in front of me.
[17:25] [Applause]
[17:27] Hallelujah.
[17:30] The road has not been easy. That's
[17:33] right. At times I've lost my way. So
[17:37] often I stumble
[17:41] searching for the light of the day.
[17:44] circumstances all around me. Thank you,
[17:48] Lord. I thought I'd surely fall
[17:52] with the whispering of doubt and fear. I
[17:55] tried to lose it all, but he caring
[18:04] grace.
[18:07] Someday soon I'll have the chance to
[18:11] thank him face to face
[18:16] with a reason that I'm standing
[18:20] stands in front of me.
[18:24] Every battle that I fought will paid
[18:28] from memory.
[18:33] I'll bow before his mighty throne. Yes,
[18:36] we will fall down on my knees
[18:42] when the reason that I'm standing
[18:48] stands in front of me.
[18:54] We will join the millions.
[18:57] every kindred tongue and race
[19:01] and every child of God
[19:05] will look upon his face
[19:10] when the heroes and the martyrs who died
[19:14] on the pagan sword.
[19:20] We'll all stand together and declare
[19:26] Jesus is Lord.
[19:31] Thank you, Lord.
[19:34] When the reason that I'm standing
[19:38] stands in front of me,
[19:42] every battle that I fought will fade
[19:46] from memory.
[19:50] I want to bow before his mighty throne.
[19:54] Thank you, Lord. Fall down on my knees
[20:00] with the reason that I'm standing,
[20:04] [Applause]
[20:06] stands in front of me.
[20:11] I'll bow before his mighty throne and
[20:15] fall down on my knees
[20:21] with a reason that I'm standing.
[20:27] Stands in front of me.
[20:34] and he stands in front of me.

[24:15] fall.
[24:18] And all those lonely roads that I have
[24:22] traveled on,
[24:25] there was Jesus.
[24:29] [Music]
[24:32] When the life I built came crashing to
[24:36] the ground.
[24:37] [Music]
[24:39] When the friends I had were nowhere to
[24:43] be found,
[24:46] I couldn't see it then, but I can see it
[24:50] now.
[24:53] There was Jesus
[24:55] [Music]
[25:00] in the waiting, in the searching, in the
[25:04] healing and the hurting like a blessing
[25:09] buried in the broken pieces.
[25:14] every minute, every moment where I've
[25:18] been and where I'm going. Even when I
[25:22] didn't know it or couldn't see it,
[25:27] there was Jesus
[25:30] [Music]
[25:35] for this man who needs amazing kind of
[25:39] grace
[25:42] for forgiveness at a price I couldn't
[25:46] pay.
[25:47] Oh, I'm not perfect, so I thank God
[25:52] every day.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; There was Jesus.

[26:03] in the waiting, in the searching, in the
[26:07] heing and the hurting. Like a blessing
[26:12] in the broken pieces.
[26:17] every minute, every moment, where I've
[26:21] been and where I'm going. Even when I
[26:25] didn't know it or couldn't see it,
[26:30] there was Jesus on the mountains, in the
[26:35] valleys.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; There was Jesus
[26:40] &gt;&gt; in the shadows of the alleys.
[26:44] There was Jesus in the fire.

[27:13] In the waiting in the searching, in the
[27:17] healing and the hiding like a blessing
[27:22] in the broken pieces
[27:27] every minute, every moment where I've
[27:30] been, where I'm going, even when I
[27:35] didn't know it, I couldn't see it.
[27:39] There was Jesus.
[27:46] There was Jesus.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; There was Jesus.
[27:54] There was Jesus.
[27:58] [Music]
[28:16] Amen. It's good to be here tonight. But
[28:18] today,
[28:20] I always throw Larry, Brother Larry,
[28:21] under the bus. We never get to practice.
[28:23] So, y'all pray for us. Amen.
[28:36] [Music]
[28:42] There's a lighthouse
[28:44] on the hillside
[28:49] that overlooks
[28:52] life scene.
[28:55] And when I'm tossed, it sends out a
[28:59] light.
[29:02] A light that I might see.
[29:09] And the light that shines in darkness
[29:14] now
[29:15] will safely
[29:18] lead me home.
[29:22] Cuz if it wasn't for that lighthouse,
[29:29] my ship would sail no more.
[29:34] And I thank God
[29:37] for the lighthouse.
[29:42] I owe my life to him.
[29:48] For
[29:49] Jesus
[29:51] is the lighthouse
[29:56] and from the rocks of sin.
[30:01] He has shown a light
[30:06] around me
[30:09] that I might clearly
[30:13] see.
[30:14] that if it wasn't for the lighthouse.
[30:22] Tell me, where would this ship be?
[30:28] [Music]
[30:32] Now everybody that lives around us,
[30:39] they say, "Tear that old light house
[30:43] down."
[30:46] You know the big ships, they don't sail
[30:49] by this way anymore.
[30:52] There's no use in that old thing
[30:55] standing round.
[30:59] But my mind goes back to that stormy
[31:04] night
[31:05] when just in time
[31:08] I saw the light.
[31:12] You know it was a light from that old
[31:16] lighthouse
[31:19] that stands there on the hill.
[31:24] And I thank God
[31:28] for the lighthouse.
[31:32] I owe my life to him
[31:38] for
[31:40] Jesus
[31:41] is the lighthouse.
[31:46] And from the rocks of sin,
[31:51] he has shown a light
[31:56] around me
[31:59] that I might clearly
[32:03] see that if it wasn't
[32:08] for the lighthouse.
[32:12] Tell me, where would this ship be?
[32:21] [Music]
[32:29] [Applause]
[32:35] I don't know about you, I'm so grateful
[32:37] for the lighthouse today.
[32:41] In this world of such darkness and
[32:43] trouble,
[32:45] where would we be without Jesus and his
[32:48] mercy to us? Now, I'm not just talking
[32:51] about the Jesus
[32:53] that a lot of churches have made. I'm
[32:56] talking about the scriptural one.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; The one who is the word. Yes.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest mistakes that people
[33:04] in this day have been and are making is
[33:09] separating Jesus from the word.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; And remember, if your Jesus will leave
[33:15] the word, he's not the Jesus of the
[33:17] word.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; He always stays with his word because he
[33:22] is the word.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Is it a privilege for
[33:26] us to be gathered together here today?
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Won't you just turn and check somebody's
[33:30] in? Tell them. Good to see you in the
[33:32] house of the Lord today.
[33:34] Good to see each of you in the presence
[33:35] of the Lord in the house of God with the
[33:38] saints of God.
[33:41] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:44] Let us turn to second Peter chapter 1 if
[33:47] you would today verse two. We want to
[33:50] speak again today about godliness. I
[33:53] trust everybody wants to be more like
[33:54] God.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:59] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[34:01] through the knowledge of God and of
[34:03] Jesus our Lord. According as this divine
[34:06] power hath given unto us all things that
[34:10] pertain unto life and godliness, through
[34:13] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[34:16] to glory and virtue, whereby are given
[34:19] unto us exceeding great and precious
[34:21] promises, that by these you might be
[34:24] partakers of the divine nature. Now
[34:28] remember this scripture here as we're
[34:30] going to go into into just in a few
[34:33] minutes but it will tie with this.
[34:35] Partakers of the divine nature having
[34:39] escaped the world that is in the world
[34:42] the excuse me having escaped the
[34:44] corruption that is in the world through
[34:45] lust. And beside this, giving all
[34:48] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[34:51] to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
[34:54] temperance, and to temperance patience,
[34:58] and to patience godliness.
[35:01] Now, I want you to notice the seventh
[35:03] one, which we probably won't reach
[35:06] today,
[35:07] but look at the seventh one. And to
[35:10] godliness,
[35:12] brotherly kindness.
[35:14] and to brotherly kindness, charity,
[35:17] which is eight. Of course,
[35:21] I believe, and I'm sure that you do as
[35:22] well, that our father laid all these out
[35:26] to the by the spirit of God to Peter. I
[35:29] find it amazing, though, that the very
[35:32] last one before charity, the capstone,
[35:35] is brotherly kindness.
[35:39] Now, that would be something that a lot
[35:40] of people would think, well, that would
[35:42] be so easy to do, really.
[35:45] I wonder in our ranks and our church and
[35:49] our families if we aren't being tried by
[35:53] the lack of this very virtue right here,
[35:56] &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness.
[35:59] And it will be the one when you reach
[36:02] that place and it is fluent in your
[36:06] life,
[36:07] it will be the one that God will cap off
[36:11] right on top of that.
[36:15] Now, I'm sure that you've noticed it
[36:16] already in reading these
[36:19] miracles,
[36:21] signs,
[36:23] wonders,
[36:24] emotion, shouting, running, jumping, all
[36:27] of that. None of those are even
[36:30] mentioned in this.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; We believe in that, don't we?
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Faith brings brings that, of course, if
[36:37] we believe it. But isn't it amazing that
[36:39] God builds the individual not out of
[36:42] those things?
[36:44] Not even out of some of the things the
[36:46] churches make it out of and then message
[36:48] people what they make it out of. But God
[36:51] picked those things which he knew would
[36:52] be absolutely essential. Why? This is
[36:55] his own nature.
[36:58] This is his own nature broke down into
[37:00] us. And Jesus knowing of all these great
[37:04] things and making brotherly kindness
[37:07] which is the virtue of our age.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Remember when the prophet
[37:13] draws it out on the pyramid form, then
[37:15] he puts the virtues and church age
[37:16] messengers and the dates and all that
[37:18] and right on the very top, the very last
[37:21] one before charity is brotherly
[37:23] kindness.
[37:26] Help us, Lord. Amen. How many like to be
[37:30] remembered today? Not only for that, but
[37:32] other things as well in your life. Amen.
[37:34] Let's just pray together.
[37:37] Heavenly Father, we thank you once again
[37:40] that we could be gathered together,
[37:42] Lord, in this place.
[37:44] Dear God, we are grateful so much for
[37:47] the light in the evening time. And we
[37:51] know, Lord God, that it was the light
[37:53] that dispelled the darkness in the
[37:55] beginning. And we know, Father, that
[37:57] your prophet tells us that when the
[37:59] words were spoken there in Genesis, let
[38:02] there be this, let there be that.
[38:05] Father, that he believed the sun, the
[38:06] moon, and the stars were already into
[38:09] creation whenever the spirit of God
[38:11] said, "Let there be light." And there
[38:13] was light. And then the light drove the
[38:15] darkness from the earth. So, the light
[38:17] was already there, but the darkness just
[38:20] need to be dispelled by the light. I
[38:23] believe, Father, that it's been that way
[38:25] ever since. That truth is here. Truth is
[38:28] around us. Truth is present. We just
[38:32] need the darkness to be pushed away that
[38:34] the light can shine through us. We stand
[38:37] here today, Father, with many needs in
[38:38] our hearts. People with needs in their
[38:40] bodies, in their homes, maybe on their
[38:42] job, their finances. See the prayer
[38:45] clause that I have in my hands. Father,
[38:46] I'm asking you that you'd be mindful of
[38:49] these needs today as I preach with them.
[38:51] May your presence, Lord God, go and meet
[38:53] the needs. Help me, Lord, that I can get
[38:56] out of the way, that you can speak
[38:57] through me, Father, in the name of the
[39:00] Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:02] And the saints said,
[39:03] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[39:08] I went down Friday afternoon
[39:11] um to the men's meeting down in Newport,
[39:14] Tennessee, and I supposed to spoke there
[39:17] last night, but brother Barry took me
[39:20] into consideration
[39:22] and and um changed it around so I could
[39:25] be there on Friday night so I wouldn't
[39:27] be so exhausted preaching there last
[39:30] night and driving back tonight. So, had
[39:32] a wonderful service with the brothers
[39:34] there and that's still ongoing today.
[39:36] We're grateful for what the Lord um is
[39:39] doing there. All men gathering there at
[39:41] that place. And it's just quite quite
[39:45] wonderful whenever you look and see that
[39:46] men men there from Germany, from India,
[39:49] from Pakistan, from New York, from
[39:52] Georgia, from just different places. U
[39:55] brothers that had come together to be
[39:57] able to find more of what they could be
[40:00] in in the house of God. I I personally
[40:04] believe that our church, ours and every
[40:06] other church, is no stronger than the
[40:08] families that make up that church. It's
[40:11] the same way with the men, men of the
[40:13] family. The woman has a great position,
[40:15] a godly position that God gives her. But
[40:18] God needs men in the church that are
[40:20] stable. Men in the families that are
[40:22] stable, men that can lead their families
[40:25] and guide their families in the way of
[40:27] godliness. And the church said,
[40:29] &gt;&gt; "Amen." The word husband, I've shared it
[40:31] with you many years ago. The word
[40:33] husband actually comes from the two
[40:35] words blended together, which is
[40:36] houseband. Houseband.
[40:39] So, it's something that binds the house
[40:41] together. God knows exactly what he's
[40:44] doing. And since I've come back home,
[40:46] the brothers been sharing with me
[40:47] different things that's been going on
[40:49] down there. Some of our brothers from
[40:50] here are there today. And we're grateful
[40:53] for that. Also, Brother Biscll's
[40:56] homegoing memorial service will be going
[40:59] on in Cloverdale today. So, we want to
[41:01] remember them. They've done had just a
[41:04] family uh graveside there, but also the
[41:07] the bigger services there. So, we know
[41:09] that they're rejoicing today also
[41:11] mourning for his loss of course taken
[41:14] from them. Ultimately, each of us are
[41:17] heading in this direction to where that
[41:21] one day our lives will be ended. And
[41:24] whether it is by the rapture or whether
[41:26] it is by this familiar door that many of
[41:29] our loved ones have already faced called
[41:31] death. I don't mind telling you I have
[41:33] mixed feelings about death. I hate
[41:36] death. But at the same time, I know
[41:38] death is necessary sometimes in order to
[41:41] bring on the next cycle of life. We're
[41:44] in that cycle of course here in the
[41:46] mountains in East Tennessee. And we can
[41:48] see the leaves that they are falling
[41:50] from the ground. Thousands of them,
[41:52] millions of them yet to fall. We see the
[41:54] walnuts covered up our driveway out
[41:56] here. Believe it or not, I blowed all
[41:57] them off the other day and there wasn't
[41:59] one of them left. But when the wind come
[42:01] through, it blow them all all there.
[42:02] Now, what's that's a sign of? That's a
[42:05] sign of the harvest cycle. So, we could
[42:07] look at all of that and look at our own
[42:09] lives and realize that some of us are
[42:12] like that as well. Our leaves are
[42:14] beginning to turn. Our strength is no
[42:16] longer quite what it was. Maybe the, you
[42:19] know, the brilliance of our mind is
[42:21] becoming a little bit edgy. And and in
[42:23] our mind, we think we're the same as we
[42:25] were as 20 until you get that basketball
[42:27] and go into playing against some of
[42:29] these 18-year-old boys and your muscles
[42:31] will let you know tomorrow you're not
[42:33] the same as you were. It's the same with
[42:35] you sisters. You may look and think,
[42:37] well, I I'm the same. I can still do
[42:38] this. And up here, you think you can,
[42:41] but until you start doing it and then
[42:43] you realize, what in the world happened
[42:45] to me? What in the world? It had sneaked
[42:47] up on that. Actually, it didn't sneak up
[42:49] on you. It's been creeping upon you for
[42:51] many, many years. And for some of us,
[42:53] it's finally arrived. Some of you old
[42:56] people, can y'all say amen?
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Wake up and say it, and then you can go
[42:59] back to sleep.
[43:01] But we realize that this is the cycle
[43:04] that has been for thousands and
[43:06] thousands of years. But we believe and
[43:09] we hope and we pray that we are at the
[43:12] end of that cycle. I don't know that we
[43:14] are. It may go on another generation,
[43:16] may go on another hundred years.
[43:18] Honestly, don't see how it could. But we
[43:20] want to prepare our homes, our lives,
[43:23] our church as if though that there would
[43:25] be a tomorrow. So, we don't want to live
[43:28] our lives just so much in in the rapture
[43:30] state of mind that we don't even plan.
[43:33] We don't even try to instill godliness
[43:35] in our children. We want to be able to
[43:37] impact them in such a way that if the
[43:40] Lord would tar and I would die, go by
[43:42] the way of the grave and y'all would
[43:44] vote in someone else and the deacons
[43:46] will all die and the trustees will all
[43:48] die, the song leaders will all die and
[43:50] it'll be another generation, then
[43:52] another generation. We want there to be
[43:54] people, our young people, that are
[43:56] embracing the truth that we believe
[43:59] right now, not by second-handed
[44:01] religion, but because they actually see
[44:04] it for themsel by revelation. And we
[44:06] know it's important that we teach our
[44:08] children, but it's also important that
[44:10] we as parents pray for our children,
[44:13] that God will help them to get it, not
[44:16] just by repetition of hearing it by me,
[44:18] the youth leaders in Sunday school, but
[44:21] that God will reveal it to them. And the
[44:24] church said,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; now John wrote to them. He wrote to the
[44:27] to the elder men. He wrote to the young
[44:30] men. He wrote to the sisters. And he
[44:32] divided it because of the categories
[44:34] that they were in. And we know that God
[44:37] does that. And we know that this
[44:39] actually is an attribute of God to this.
[44:42] Now, Peter when writing this, I don't
[44:44] believe that he just kind of sat down
[44:46] one day and thought, you know what? I I
[44:48] need to write this epistle. I I decide
[44:50] I'm going to write the first and the
[44:51] second one. Let me think what could I
[44:53] write about now cuz I want to outdo the
[44:55] rest of the brothers that have written.
[44:57] So, what could I write that would make
[44:58] me outstanding? No. That part about
[45:01] Peter had already died when he got the
[45:03] Holy Ghost.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. So, I believe
[45:06] that he prayed and he felt, "Well, Lord,
[45:09] I I I don't want to just write it
[45:10] because I was with you, but I want to
[45:13] write something that would be a
[45:14] benefit." Aren't you glad that these men
[45:16] obeyed the spirit of God and wrote these
[45:19] things? Where would we be, friends,
[45:21] without our Bible? Thank God the spirit
[45:24] of God moved upon Matthew and Mark and
[45:27] Luke and John. And you realize that
[45:29] Matthew, you know, was there with him,
[45:31] but Luke was not there with him. Luke
[45:33] was was trained up and he was a Jew but
[45:35] he was a well a scholar and Luke come
[45:38] back years later and wrote the book of
[45:41] Luke. He was not even there when these
[45:42] events happened. He was not even there
[45:44] whenever Jesus raised the dead and
[45:46] healed the sick. But Luke come in
[45:48] afterwards and Luke is also the same one
[45:50] as you know that wrote the book of Acts.
[45:52] So where did he get this information
[45:54] from going around talking to the
[45:57] different people? I thank God for every
[45:59] one of those books. I am so grateful
[46:01] that God gave them to us to us. But yet
[46:04] we know that it's more than just reading
[46:06] it. No doubt the Bible has already been
[46:08] read in New Zealand and Australia across
[46:11] the international dine and it's already
[46:13] in Zambia and Zimbabwe and Kenya and the
[46:16] Ivory Coast and all over the world.
[46:17] They've already had their Sunday morning
[46:19] service and now they've went home and
[46:21] and it's been read on and it's been
[46:23] preached in every denominational church.
[46:26] No doubt the Bible has at least had a
[46:28] had a text taken from it. And yet it's
[46:30] the same Bible that we've had for many
[46:32] many years, the King James version, 1611
[46:35] version, and how long it's been upon the
[46:37] face of the earth. And yet, if that's
[46:39] all we need is just the preaching of the
[46:42] Bible, then my question would be, how
[46:44] come the rapture did not take place
[46:47] after the first New Testament books were
[46:49] written? If everything we need to take a
[46:52] rapture is in the New Testament alone,
[46:55] why was there not a rapture after it was
[46:58] finally put together and the final books
[47:00] were added to it, which would have been
[47:02] around 96 AD, then if just having the
[47:05] New Testament and reading it and
[47:07] believing that it was the word of God,
[47:10] then the rapture should have taken place
[47:11] around 96 AD at the latest 97 AD. So why
[47:16] didn't it happen? Why was it that people
[47:19] kept on reading the Bible and then the
[47:21] Bible got lost away of course by the
[47:23] Catholic Church and wanted to drown it
[47:25] out and then in the reformation God
[47:27] ordained that the printing presses come
[47:29] on the scene and God could have had tape
[47:31] players then if he' wanted to.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. He could have had radio.
[47:35] He could have done it whatever he
[47:36] wanted. But God started it out with the
[47:38] primitive form of bringing the word
[47:41] because that's where the revelation was
[47:43] at that time. So Luther didn't catch the
[47:46] the revelation of the seven thunders. He
[47:48] didn't catch it about the opening of the
[47:49] seven seals. They were just coming out
[47:52] of such terrible, terrible darkness. And
[47:54] God started it in its infancy form. And
[47:58] then God used the means of science by
[48:01] which he's going to now paste the
[48:02] revelation of his word. And what does he
[48:04] use? A printing press. And then people
[48:07] start writing. And for many of them, it
[48:09] was very, very primitive. And you've
[48:10] seen no doubt printings or pictures of
[48:12] them of what type that they were. And as
[48:15] sites begin to advance the revelation of
[48:17] the word begin to advance with it. And
[48:19] here we are past the printing press.
[48:22] Most of them don't even use them
[48:23] anymore. The last time I visited the
[48:25] voice of God, they had actually sold
[48:28] their big prints, their big presses.
[48:31] Massive. You cannot imagine how large
[48:34] those things were. I mean, a printing
[48:36] press the size of this whole section
[48:38] right here, maybe even a little bit
[48:40] bigger. A piece of machinery that's
[48:43] absolutely overwhelming because
[48:45] everything has gone digital. So, they
[48:48] don't even print books there anymore at
[48:50] all. And yet, it's moved to a time and
[48:53] science has so advanced. And God,
[48:55] wouldn't God be something then to let
[48:58] science advance that far? And here we
[49:00] are. We're still way back in that
[49:02] primitive form of 2,000 years ago and
[49:06] we're still repeating the same Bible
[49:07] stories of Noah and Moses and Jonah and
[49:11] Zachchariah and Zachcharias and all of
[49:13] that. We love to hear those stories, do
[49:16] we not? But God also updates his
[49:20] revelation and the influence of his
[49:23] light to match the day and the time. I
[49:27] believe with all of my heart that we as
[49:29] the people of God need to hear more than
[49:32] just the story about Moses. I believe we
[49:35] need to hear more than just about Peter
[49:38] for s, you know, unable to walk on the
[49:40] water. I believe we need to hear gospel
[49:43] preaching of the age and the hour and
[49:46] the time and the dispensation that we
[49:49] are living in.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Now, it's going to
[49:52] take something to produce a rapturing
[49:55] faith. Look friends, I'm 69 years old.
[49:57] I've been reading this Bible since I was
[49:59] 12. I've been reading my Bible since I
[50:01] was 12 years old. And when I come to the
[50:04] message, I did not fall out of love with
[50:06] my Bible and just say, "Somehow you do
[50:08] away with the Bible because you're in
[50:09] the message." I love my Bible now more
[50:11] than I've ever loved it in my life.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Because to me, the message makes the
[50:16] Bible so real. You know, Brother Ram
[50:18] talked about it and rever said right
[50:19] beyond that mountain over there when he
[50:21] was in Phoenix and he said right beyond
[50:23] that mountain, he said whenever them
[50:25] angels come down, he said it made this
[50:27] Bible a brand new book. We did not need
[50:30] a William Brandom version of the Bible.
[50:33] We did not need a Lutheran version. Now,
[50:36] if you study the Islamic religion, you
[50:38] know that the Quran that what did he do?
[50:41] He come from the angels and so on and so
[50:43] on and they gave him all these new
[50:45] writings. What did the Mormons do? Well,
[50:48] the Mormons done exactly the same thing.
[50:50] So, Moroni supposedly come down and
[50:53] revealed to Joseph Smith and gave him
[50:55] all these plates of gold that were hit
[50:57] up in upstate New York. And then after
[51:00] he translates from off those plates of
[51:02] gold, those plates of gold disappear.
[51:04] Hogwash. I said hogwash. And the Quran,
[51:08] all the things that it says about this
[51:10] and that and the other, an absolute
[51:12] bunch of nonsense. You understand that
[51:15] his last wife, his last wife was a
[51:18] six-year-old girl.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Study the Quran and find if it's a
[51:24] religion of peace.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; It's a religion of immorality and death.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; You imagine a man marrying a
[51:32] six-year-old girl and then he
[51:33] consummated the marriage with that
[51:35] little girl when she turned the age of
[51:37] nine.
[51:40] And our bunch of sorry, rotten
[51:43] politicians in America want to embrace
[51:46] that as a religion of truth. It's from
[51:48] the pits of hell.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:56] Come on. It ain't no prophet of God. A
[52:00] prophet of God would cry out against
[52:02] such nonsense. Why do you think that his
[52:05] followers in this day rape and molest
[52:07] and do all they do? They're following
[52:09] the teaching of their prophet because
[52:11] that's the way he lived. You know why we
[52:14] forgive people? You know why we love
[52:16] people? You know why we pray for people?
[52:18] We're following the teachings of our
[52:20] prophet. Amen. He never taught us
[52:23] immorality. He never taught us to live
[52:25] like the devil. Let's have church this
[52:27] morning. What you say? He never taught
[52:29] us to live ungodly evil. He never taught
[52:32] us to do wrong. He taught us to live a
[52:35] godly, holy, sanctified life. Come on
[52:38] somebody. What was it that he told us in
[52:41] the church age book that his desire was
[52:44] to be able to build not for one reason
[52:46] or second rather would he have the
[52:48] people come and follow him but that the
[52:51] people would be able to have a
[52:53] relationship with God. That's exactly
[52:56] what our prophet wanted. Oh sure there's
[52:58] people around the message and made a
[53:00] cult out of their aspect of it. But
[53:02] don't you identify this prophet's
[53:04] message with a cult because it's not.
[53:07] It's a restoration back to the original
[53:09] word that people would be saved,
[53:12] sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost.
[53:15] Love God, love their neighbor, love
[53:17] their enemy, pray for them that despite,
[53:19] oh, I feel like preaching today. Why?
[53:22] Because God wants a church that will be
[53:25] identified with him.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[53:30] &gt;&gt; you see, in order to do this, God must
[53:32] go beyond the ordinary means of man.
[53:35] Now, watch godliness as a prophet as I
[53:37] read it to you when I first started
[53:38] preaching this that he had to look
[53:40] through several dictionaries to even
[53:42] find the meaning of godliness. And he
[53:44] said he finally found one that said it
[53:46] meant to be like God. So, we'll take it
[53:48] that way. That that means to be like
[53:51] God. So, godliness, what all does it
[53:53] involve? Well, it means to be like God
[53:56] in the attributes that human beings by
[53:59] the spirit of God living in them will be
[54:01] able to project. There's things about
[54:03] God, of course, we can never do and God
[54:05] don't expect us to. But God wants us to
[54:08] embrace the height of everything that a
[54:11] bornagain son or daughter of God can be
[54:14] able to do. And will they have their
[54:16] mistakes? They will. Will they have
[54:18] their shortcomings? They will. But
[54:20] they're still displaying godliness even
[54:23] when they do wrong cuz they'll come back
[54:25] and say, "I'm sorry." A real son or
[54:28] daughter of God can admit when they're
[54:30] wrong and they can ask for forgiveness.
[54:34] Only stubborn, hellbound church members
[54:37] can never admit they're wrong. I wish
[54:39] somebody would preach with me this
[54:41] morning. I know some of you all don't
[54:42] like to admit that you're wrong. And
[54:44] I'll tell you, you better repent and get
[54:46] that demon off of you cuz you'll never
[54:48] walk down streets of gold if you don't
[54:50] get rid of that hard-headed, stubborn
[54:53] thing that you can't admit that you're
[54:55] wrong. Go to God and ask him to forgive
[54:57] you. Go to your neighbor, ask them to
[54:59] forgive you. Lord have mercy. John the
[55:01] Baptist anointing must be in here today.
[55:04] If we ever expect to walk down the
[55:06] streets of gold, we're going to have to
[55:08] humble oursel and our pride. We're going
[55:11] to have to humble oursel and our
[55:13] arrogance. And when you're wrong, admit
[55:15] you're wrong. Be a big man. Be a big
[55:18] woman. Come on, somebody. I ain't
[55:20] talking about your size. I ain't talking
[55:22] about your bank account. I ain't talking
[55:24] about how many acres you own and how
[55:26] many houses you got. I'm talking about
[55:29] having faith and virtue and knowledge
[55:32] and temperance. And here we are looking
[55:34] at godliness to be like God.
[55:38] Yes,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; sir.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah. Our God is a phenomenal
[55:43] God. Then you ought to reflect a
[55:45] phenomenal work of the grace of the
[55:48] supernatural God in your life. Our God
[55:50] is a God of love. Then you being godly
[55:53] ought to be a Christian of love. Our God
[55:55] is a God of faithfulness and you ought
[55:57] to be a faithful Christian. Our God is a
[56:00] God of purity. Then you ought to walk a
[56:02] pure and a holy life. Our God is a God
[56:05] of perfection and you also ought to walk
[56:07] as Jesus said, "Be ye therefore perfect
[56:10] even as your father which is in heaven
[56:12] is perfect." Our God is a God of
[56:14] sincerity. Our God is a God of truth.
[56:17] Our God is a God of light. There is no
[56:19] darkness in him at all. And there should
[56:21] be no darkness in our life, no darkness
[56:24] in our behavior, no darkness in our
[56:27] business dealings, no darkness in our
[56:29] Christianity. We ought to be a people
[56:32] that are like God. You ought to get up
[56:35] like God. You ought to lay down like
[56:37] God. You ought to work like God. Amen.
[56:40] You ought to be like God in your
[56:42] dealings. Be like God in your comingings
[56:44] and your goings. when you're going in,
[56:46] when you're going out, when you're up,
[56:48] when you're down, may God be able to
[56:50] reflect himself in each of our lives. I
[56:54] don't know. I tell you one thing. I
[56:56] think it would be phenomenal if every
[56:58] person of this assembly would get such a
[57:00] craving and a hungering, a desiring to
[57:03] be more like God. Don't worry about
[57:05] trying to be like the Joneses or the
[57:07] Reagans or the Smiths or whoever more.
[57:10] Make your example Jesus Christ. Well,
[57:13] they've got a fine car. I've got to have
[57:15] one. They've got a boat and an RV and a
[57:17] this and a that and the other. Forget
[57:19] what they've got. What you want is faith
[57:22] and virtue and knowledge and temperance
[57:25] and oh hallelujah. All these attributes
[57:27] of almighty God. We're talking about a
[57:30] peaceful people this morning that can
[57:32] live the kind of life that will be
[57:34] raptured in a moment in the twinkling of
[57:37] an eye. If not, this message ain't going
[57:39] to do us one bit of good. If all we've
[57:41] got is a head knowledge. If all we've
[57:43] got is a head religion and we can quote
[57:46] the Bible and quote the prophet and
[57:48] think we're something, what good does it
[57:50] do if we don't live the Bible and live
[57:52] what the prophet of God taught us?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Who was that for?
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Our God is a
[58:08] supernatural God. Then in order to be
[58:12] godly,
[58:13] you must become a supernatural being.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; A supernatural
[58:22] being, which is a natural being modified
[58:26] by supernatural power.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Now, man broke into this years and years
[58:32] ago and made Superman and Batman and the
[58:37] X-Men and all this. you know, it's
[58:38] changed down through the ages. So, they
[58:41] made Hollywood characters. Now, I I I
[58:44] know that many of you all, of course,
[58:46] were sanctified when you were children
[58:47] and you never watched television, but I
[58:49] wasn't. We was raised in a home to where
[58:52] we had television. It's what we did all
[58:54] the time. And and so I watched Superman
[58:57] and I became Superman. I mean, I I would
[59:00] take a whatever and wrap around me. I
[59:02] become a Tarzan. We'd go down in the
[59:04] woods, uh, Harry and I, and the rest of
[59:06] our siblings, and we'd cut grape vines
[59:08] and and we'd go down through there, and
[59:09] I'd squall and yell, "Oh,
[59:13] oh boy.
[59:15] I'd become Superman and Batman, and I'd
[59:18] fly through the woods with my cape
[59:21] trailing in the back. I wasn't one bit
[59:23] stronger than I was before I put the
[59:25] cape on. But one of one day, aren't you
[59:27] glad we found a real man or a real one
[59:30] found us and he gave us a power that
[59:33] truly made us supernatural. You see,
[59:37] there's something in humanity. If there
[59:39] was not those types of things would
[59:42] never go over. People want super
[59:44] characters. Our kids still will fall
[59:46] back on that. They want super
[59:48] characters. Many of you moms, if you're
[59:50] not careful, you will come somehow to
[59:53] this identification that you're to be a
[59:55] super mom and a super cook and a super
[59:58] house cleaner and a super washer window
[1:00:00] person. And you dads are supposed to be
[1:00:03] super this and super that and super
[1:00:05] something else. In reality, your kids
[1:00:08] ain't wanting a super dad. They're
[1:00:09] wanting a dad that'll love them. A dad
[1:00:12] that'll be able to pray with them at
[1:00:13] night. A dad that will be able to read
[1:00:15] to them and tell them about Jesus. a dad
[1:00:17] that'll be big enough to pull him in his
[1:00:19] arms. I wish somebody would preach with
[1:00:21] me. I reckon if I'm going to have to
[1:00:23] have church this morning, I have to do
[1:00:24] it by myself.
[1:00:26] Come on. They don't want super moms that
[1:00:29] can be able to go to the moon and back
[1:00:31] by lunch. They want a mom that can
[1:00:34] understand their trouble. They're not
[1:00:36] looking for a mom that can be a Wonder
[1:00:38] Woman. Come on, children. They want a
[1:00:40] mom that'll understand them. They want a
[1:00:42] mom that will love them even if they
[1:00:44] have questions about the message. Come
[1:00:46] on, somebody. Amen. We don't need super
[1:00:49] youth leaders in our church. We need
[1:00:51] youth leaders that are led by the spirit
[1:00:53] of God. And our youth can come to them
[1:00:56] when they have questions about the
[1:00:58] message or questions about this. Amen.
[1:01:01] Oh, hallelujah. You don't need a super
[1:01:03] preacher. It's already too late. You
[1:01:05] don't know that anyhow. You ain't got
[1:01:07] one. You don't need one. But you need
[1:01:09] preachers and men of God and mothers and
[1:01:12] fathers that can live a life before you
[1:01:15] that'll so grasp a hold of your life
[1:01:17] that you can see them in their
[1:01:19] weaknesses. You can see them in their
[1:01:21] trials. And you know they're struggling
[1:01:24] and you know they're going through a
[1:01:25] hard time, but you also see them get up
[1:01:28] and punch that devil right square in the
[1:01:30] face. And you know many times when
[1:01:32] they're doing it, they're not doing it
[1:01:34] on feeling. They're not doing it on
[1:01:36] emotion. They're doing it because
[1:01:37] they're called to do it. I'm called to
[1:01:39] preach whether I feel one speck of the
[1:01:42] anointing or not. This morning, I'm
[1:01:44] called to cast out devils. I'm called to
[1:01:46] lay hand on the sick. And I'm going to
[1:01:48] do it till I draw my last breath. If the
[1:01:51] Lord lets me live, you not only am I
[1:01:53] called, but you are called to live this
[1:01:56] word. You're called to get up in the
[1:01:58] morning when you don't feel like getting
[1:02:00] up. You're called to get your children's
[1:02:02] lunch back and ready. You're called to
[1:02:05] be able to be an example. Mothers,
[1:02:07] you're called to be an example. Fathers,
[1:02:09] oh, don't feel like it. You're called to
[1:02:11] do it even when you don't feel like it.
[1:02:13] When you don't feel good. The deacon
[1:02:15] brothers, the trustee brothers, the
[1:02:17] musicians, the song leaders, you're
[1:02:19] called to come here and put your best
[1:02:22] effort forth to play your organ, Harry,
[1:02:24] with all of your heart. Play your piano,
[1:02:26] brother Larry. Play your instrument. You
[1:02:29] deacons, do your bed. You're called to
[1:02:31] come here, saints of God, and put forth
[1:02:34] every effort that you have. Clap them
[1:02:36] hands. Raise them hands to God. Lord, I
[1:02:39] love you. I'm called to clap my hands.
[1:02:42] I'm called to raise my arms to God. Why?
[1:02:46] I want to be like God. I don't want to
[1:02:48] just be a church member. I don't want to
[1:02:51] be a person that just hangs on. Well,
[1:02:53] let me get through Sunday. I ain't
[1:02:55] wanting to get through Sunday. I'm
[1:02:57] wanting to sail through Sunday. And I
[1:03:00] can't wait till Wednesday. Hallelujah. I
[1:03:02] don't want to just barely hang on. I
[1:03:05] don't want a t-shirt that says I endure
[1:03:07] Leodosia. I want to walk up there as an
[1:03:10] overcomer. I want Hallelujah to the lamb
[1:03:14] of God. I don't want to go by myself,
[1:03:16] but I want to look behind me and see men
[1:03:20] and women, hallelujah, that have stood
[1:03:23] for this word and say, Lord God, give us
[1:03:26] strength to be faithful.
[1:03:35] And you know as well as I know we cannot
[1:03:38] do this on our own.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; We must have a supernatural something
[1:03:45] within us that has changed us
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; to make us compatible with godliness
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; to be like God.
[1:03:58] Hallelujah.
[1:04:00] So let me just share with you today
[1:04:05] who you are
[1:04:07] and go tell my disciples a prophet said
[1:04:10] I have men everywhere across the country
[1:04:12] sometimes criticizing me about divine
[1:04:15] healing. Why my brother? How could I
[1:04:17] keep from believing in divine healing
[1:04:20] when it's the very nature of the Holy
[1:04:22] Spirit? Every man that's born of the
[1:04:26] spirit of God will have to believe in
[1:04:30] the supernatural.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; God is supernatural.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; The attribute of godliness will embody
[1:04:40] supernatural and pass that trait down to
[1:04:44] you
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; if you're born again. Every man that's
[1:04:48] born of the spirit of God will have to
[1:04:50] believe in the supernatural because he
[1:04:53] listen because he is a part of God. He's
[1:04:59] an offspring
[1:05:01] of God.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; An offspring of God. Aren't you glad for
[1:05:06] that today? An offspring of God. You
[1:05:10] look Now I say I look You look like your
[1:05:13] daddy. You got a nose. They tell me, "I
[1:05:15] got a nose like dad. I got a mouth like
[1:05:18] dad." Why? He's my father. I got a right
[1:05:21] to look like him. Hallelujah. Then if
[1:05:23] God is my father, I have got a right to
[1:05:27] believe in the supernatural because I'm
[1:05:31] born of the supernatural spirit. Now
[1:05:35] friend, it is a great great error on our
[1:05:38] part to think that the supernatural is
[1:05:41] only divine healing or miracles or
[1:05:44] somebody having a vision or somebody
[1:05:46] having a dream. God wants every day of
[1:05:49] our life to be lived from a supernatural
[1:05:53] realm. But as I said it down to you the
[1:05:55] ministers or the men's meeting down on
[1:05:57] Friday night. You're going to have many
[1:06:00] more non-miraculous days in your life
[1:06:04] than you are miraculous days. There may
[1:06:07] be days and we lead into weeks and
[1:06:10] months before you in between miracles
[1:06:12] before you'll see one miracle and then
[1:06:14] another and then another. That don't
[1:06:16] mean you don't have a supernatural walk
[1:06:19] because every day you get up and live in
[1:06:22] this dark age and you have your right
[1:06:25] mind at the end of the day. How many
[1:06:26] still does have your right mind? Some of
[1:06:28] you.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Rest of you crazy.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, that makes sense why I
[1:06:33] preach. I'm preaching to crazy people.
[1:06:36] How many's got your right mind? All
[1:06:38] right. Thank God y'all found it. Praise
[1:06:39] the Lord. Every day you do that, you
[1:06:42] have lived a supernatural life. And the
[1:06:46] supernatural power of God was on display
[1:06:49] as that man raised his voice to you and
[1:06:51] accused you of doing something that
[1:06:53] wasn't right. And something within you,
[1:06:56] though your first nature may have raised
[1:06:59] up, but something inside of you overrode
[1:07:02] that first nature and calms you right
[1:07:04] down, you had a supernatural moment in
[1:07:07] your everyday walk with God. and you're
[1:07:10] looking for miracles. Well, you don't
[1:07:11] have to look any further. Right here is
[1:07:13] one right here standing before you. I am
[1:07:16] a miracle. I'm a saved man. I'm a
[1:07:19] sanctified man. I'm a man filled with
[1:07:21] the Holy Ghost. There's miracles sitting
[1:07:23] all around you right by you. Come on,
[1:07:25] saints. And believe me, it will be those
[1:07:28] miracles that walk down streets of gold.
[1:07:31] There will never be a miracle in the
[1:07:34] sense of divine healing or a blinded man
[1:07:37] receiving his eyes in heaven. There
[1:07:40] won't be no blind people in heaven. But
[1:07:42] the miracles that walk down streets of
[1:07:45] gold, that is the miraculous that God
[1:07:47] wants to display.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my, you look like your daddy. He
[1:07:52] said, I've got to believe in the
[1:07:54] supernatural because I'm born in the
[1:07:57] supernatural spirit. That makes a
[1:08:00] supernatural
[1:08:02] being out of me.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That makes a supernatural being out of
[1:08:10] me. So God is supernatural. In order to
[1:08:12] be godly, I've got to become
[1:08:15] supernatural. And I have.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And you have, too, if you got the Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost. How many's got the Holy Ghost?
[1:08:21] Well, you're supernatural. Inwardly,
[1:08:23] outwardly, I'm a man of clay. You're a
[1:08:26] man of clay. But inwardly when you're
[1:08:29] born of the spirit of God, you become a
[1:08:32] supernatural
[1:08:34] being in there. You become a
[1:08:38] supernatural being in there. Can you
[1:08:42] imagine when the resurrection takes
[1:08:43] place and and the rapture is called?
[1:08:46] Therefore, if you have died and entered
[1:08:47] into the theophony, what happens? The
[1:08:49] theophony brings the that redeemed body
[1:08:53] down to the earth. Now, notice what
[1:08:55] happens here. that the theophony of
[1:08:57] those that have died and entered into
[1:08:59] the theophony that they're coming down
[1:09:01] to the earth and they're going to meet
[1:09:03] the redeemed body. But if you are here,
[1:09:07] you take the redeemed body to meet the
[1:09:10] theophony. You who you who the
[1:09:15] supernatural being on the inside of you
[1:09:18] for that supernatural element will
[1:09:21] change your mortal body.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. If God could change a
[1:09:27] drunk to a preacher, if God could change
[1:09:30] a woman of ill fame and move in that
[1:09:33] woman's life and make her a daughter of
[1:09:36] God and a saint of God, cannot that same
[1:09:38] God reverse this body right back to a
[1:09:41] young man. Sure, he can. So, the
[1:09:44] supernatural is already present in our
[1:09:46] soul.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Now, notice John says it this way in 1
[1:09:51] John chapter 12. But as many as received
[1:09:55] him, to them he oh my gave he power to
[1:10:00] become to become. Now this word become
[1:10:04] is to come to pass. So they are a
[1:10:07] prophetic thought in the mind of God.
[1:10:11] And the power of God released to them
[1:10:14] brings his thought of their new birth to
[1:10:17] pass. and they come to pass at an altar
[1:10:20] or at a, you know, wherever it is they
[1:10:22] get saved at. And they become sons and
[1:10:26] daughters of God. And they're changed
[1:10:28] from just a natural being only to a
[1:10:31] supernatural being in a moment, in a
[1:10:33] twinkling of an eye. You've already had
[1:10:36] a twinkling of an eye experience at your
[1:10:39] new birth. And you're waiting for the
[1:10:41] whole glory to God. You're waiting for
[1:10:43] the one in your body to catch up with
[1:10:45] the revelation in your soul.
[1:10:47] Notice this. But as many as received
[1:10:49] him, to them gave he power to become the
[1:10:54] sons of God, even to them that believe
[1:10:57] on his name, which were born not of
[1:11:01] blood, not of the will of the flesh. So
[1:11:04] where was it that you decided you wanted
[1:11:06] to be saved? You're not born again by
[1:11:09] your own will. Not according to the
[1:11:10] Bible. You're not not of the will of the
[1:11:13] flesh. Notice this. Not of the will of
[1:11:16] the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
[1:11:20] of God.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; So all of you that are human beings
[1:11:27] today that are born, you asked your
[1:11:30] mother and father to bring you into the
[1:11:33] earth, right?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; You told your mom and dad that you
[1:11:37] wanted to be immortal.
[1:11:40] Well, now that's the way people make the
[1:11:42] new birth.
[1:11:44] They tell God they want to be born
[1:11:46] again.
[1:11:47] They tell God when they want to be born
[1:11:49] again.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; They want to sin. They want to live this
[1:11:52] way. They want to do that way. And then
[1:11:54] they tell God, "Okay, God, I've decided
[1:11:56] I want to be a Christian now."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And how's that working for you?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But you see, to them who believe on his
[1:12:06] name, to them he gave power, excuse you,
[1:12:09] to become the sons of God. Now it says,
[1:12:12] "Which were born not of blood, nor of
[1:12:15] the will of the flesh, nor of the will
[1:12:17] of man, but of God." I'll tell you, when
[1:12:20] you got born again, when your father
[1:12:22] moved on your heart, and you may, some
[1:12:24] of you may have dug your fingernails in
[1:12:26] the back of that pew or in the back of
[1:12:28] that padded chair right there, and you
[1:12:30] didn't want to come, but something got a
[1:12:32] hold to you, and it wouldn't let you go.
[1:12:34] And you don't want that same thing that
[1:12:36] got a hold to you when you got saved is
[1:12:38] the same thing that's got a hold to you
[1:12:40] down through life. and you said, "I
[1:12:42] ain't going back to church. I can't do
[1:12:44] it another day." And all of a sudden,
[1:12:46] something grabbed a hold of your neck
[1:12:48] tie and said, "Boy, you're going to the
[1:12:50] house of God." Dollar mind, you're
[1:12:53] living right. You're going to serve me.
[1:12:55] You're going to be right there faithful.
[1:12:57] Oh, but Jesus, I don't want to. I'd
[1:12:59] never ask you if you wanted to. It was
[1:13:02] me who called you. It was me who
[1:13:05] ordained you. I chose you before the
[1:13:08] foundation of the world. Get up. Get
[1:13:10] your clothes on and get to the house of
[1:13:13] God.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Y'all need might need to do a diagnostic
[1:13:27] test on these u unfrosted strawberry
[1:13:32] pop-tarts that I eat before Sunday
[1:13:34] morning.
[1:13:37] I don't know if there's double portions
[1:13:39] of Jim Sang in there or what in the
[1:13:41] world.
[1:13:44] Notice this again. The prophet says that
[1:13:46] if you do not believe in the
[1:13:48] supernatural,
[1:13:50] you haven't been born again.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You see all these church members in the
[1:13:59] day we're living that don't believe in
[1:14:01] the supernatural and a move of God. Even
[1:14:03] some of them around the message. You
[1:14:05] know why they don't? They're not born
[1:14:07] again.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. To be godly, you've got
[1:14:14] to be born of God.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Because when you're born again, you
[1:14:23] become a son of God. Being a son of God,
[1:14:25] you're a nature of God. Now, remember
[1:14:27] what we read, partakers of the divine
[1:14:29] nature. And then when you take on the
[1:14:31] things and you want to see the moving of
[1:14:35] God, you want to see the moving of God
[1:14:39] and see God move, don't we?
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Don't we want to come to church and see
[1:14:44] God move among our people and move in
[1:14:47] the services and move on our young
[1:14:49] people? We don't want to just come to
[1:14:51] church and sit there and do our religion
[1:14:53] and go back home and be as bad as we
[1:14:55] were when we come. But, Brother John, we
[1:14:57] come desiring and we're praying, "God,
[1:15:00] move today. Lord, move on the sick.
[1:15:02] Lord, move on the lost. Move on them,
[1:15:05] Lord."
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You heard the testimony, I'm
[1:15:08] sure, the other night of our sister
[1:15:10] Batman. And she had those cataracts on
[1:15:12] her eyes. You heard that, right? And she
[1:15:14] come up for prayer and the spirit of God
[1:15:16] moved for him. The next morning, they
[1:15:18] were gone. That's what I'm talking
[1:15:19] about. I'm talking about a move of God,
[1:15:23] friend. You know, no preacher can do
[1:15:25] that. I don't care who it is that it
[1:15:26] don't just limit it to divine healing.
[1:15:29] It will move in your soul. It will help
[1:15:31] you lay aside that habit that you've
[1:15:33] dealt with for years and years. And you
[1:15:36] may be wound up as tight as an 8-day
[1:15:38] clock. And at the drop of a hat, boy,
[1:15:40] you could just ball people out. And the
[1:15:42] Holy Ghost reaches inside of you and
[1:15:44] takes that old ungodly temper out of
[1:15:46] you. But you know what he does? He gives
[1:15:49] you something back in this place.
[1:15:50] Temperance.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] You cannot have temper and temperance at
[1:15:58] the same time. But if you'll let go of
[1:16:01] your temper, God will baptize you into
[1:16:03] the virtue of temperance and it will
[1:16:06] change you. And every day you will be a
[1:16:09] walking miracle because people say, "I
[1:16:12] know him. I know her." It runs in their
[1:16:15] nature to be matter and a hornet. What
[1:16:17] in the world happened to them? They got
[1:16:19] born of God. They're born of God. They
[1:16:22] act like God. and talk like God
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; because you're his son made in his image
[1:16:35] and you're born of his spirit. You're
[1:16:37] part of him and you've got faith
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; for anything.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Everybody buckle up.
[1:16:49] 1 John 3:8 3:9 rather whosoever
[1:16:55] is born of God
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; does not commit sin
[1:17:04] and
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; this word commit is practice
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; they're not sin practicers
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; now remember this is not eliminating
[1:17:13] your human mistakes that nature that
[1:17:16] made you practice sin is gone
[1:17:20] Now you're a new creature in Christ
[1:17:21] Jesus and you mess up. Boy, you better
[1:17:23] believe there's something inside of you
[1:17:25] that makes you feel bad. Ain't that
[1:17:26] right?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad it does?
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:17:32] practice sin. The Greek verb there used
[1:17:35] in the present tense implies ongoing
[1:17:39] action. So it's a repetitive something
[1:17:42] that you by nature. You by nature. Now
[1:17:47] remember, each one of us have human
[1:17:48] tendencies that are left in our humanity
[1:17:51] even after we're born again.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God on the throne room
[1:17:56] of our heart will help us to bring those
[1:17:58] things subject to the word. But if it is
[1:18:01] an ongoing thing daily, ongoing ongoing,
[1:18:04] and you cannot overcome it, you need a
[1:18:06] deeper experience with God. For he that
[1:18:09] is born of God do not commit sin, for he
[1:18:12] cannot sin. For the seed of God remainth
[1:18:15] or abideth in him. Oh glory. Whosoever
[1:18:19] is born of God does not commit sin. For
[1:18:22] his seed which is his nature remainth in
[1:18:26] him. He cannot sin because he is born of
[1:18:32] God.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Give us them miracles right there Lord.
[1:18:41] Oh my
[1:18:44] beloved. 1 John 4:7, let us love one
[1:18:47] another, for love is of God. Everyone
[1:18:50] that loveth is born
[1:18:54] of God
[1:18:56] and knoweth God. First John 5:4, for
[1:19:00] whatsoever
[1:19:02] is born of God overcometh the world.
[1:19:07] Don't you understand why people can't
[1:19:09] overcome?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand the majority of the
[1:19:12] church today, the songwriters are having
[1:19:14] to write songs about that's what the
[1:19:15] blood is for. That's what the blood is
[1:19:17] for. Boy, you can't live right. You
[1:19:19] can't overcome. You can't do this. So
[1:19:21] God give the blood knowing you're just a
[1:19:23] you're just an old sinner saved by
[1:19:26] grace.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; I was a sinner, but I ain't no more.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I know Bill and Gloria Gazer had good
[1:19:38] intentions when they wrote that song,
[1:19:40] but it's not written in the light of the
[1:19:43] end time message.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; If you're still a sinner, you're lost.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. According to John,
[1:19:50] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:19:53] sin. For the seed of God remainth in
[1:19:56] him, therefore he cannot sin.
[1:20:00] [Applause]
[1:20:02] Woo!
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Deacons, go ahead and call 911.
[1:20:08] There's going to be demons hopefully
[1:20:10] laying gasping for breath all over the
[1:20:12] pews here after church is over today.
[1:20:14] Let the devil come and collect the dead
[1:20:16] bodies while we're shouting on top of
[1:20:19] them. Hallelujah.
[1:20:22] Notice in 1 John 5:18, we know that
[1:20:26] whosoever is born of God
[1:20:31] sinnth not.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Now friends, it comes down to one plain
[1:20:35] and simple fact. Do we believe this word
[1:20:37] is the truth?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; But he that is begotten.
[1:20:49] Now remember Jesus tells us in John
[1:20:52] 3:16, "For God so loved the world that
[1:20:54] he gave his only begotten son." I
[1:20:57] mentioned to you the other night and
[1:20:58] some of you rolled your eyes at me when
[1:20:59] I said it. I said Jesus was the only
[1:21:02] begotten son at that time
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; cuz he ain't the only one now.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Not according to the Bible. Notice now,
[1:21:10] oh my, we know that whosoever is born of
[1:21:13] God sinnth not. But he that is begotten.
[1:21:17] Don't you understand the first seed son
[1:21:19] was begotten of God so that he could
[1:21:21] have a whole family of begotten sons and
[1:21:24] daughters. God didn't just want one. He
[1:21:27] the prophet said he ordained a world a
[1:21:29] world of sons and daughters of God. Can
[1:21:31] you imagine one of these days the oceans
[1:21:35] will be removed from the earth? 2/3 4th
[1:21:39] something like that of our of our earth
[1:21:41] is covered in water. We care some of the
[1:21:42] days. You said, "Where in the world's
[1:21:44] all them people going to live?" I said,
[1:21:45] "The oceans are going to be gone."
[1:21:47] Notice John said he saw no more sea.
[1:21:50] Now, this is unusual for John because
[1:21:52] he's born and raised right near the
[1:21:53] Mediterranean, which borders the country
[1:21:56] of Israel. So, John looked around and
[1:21:58] when he sees the vision, he's looking
[1:21:59] down and he sees that Jerusalem is
[1:22:01] basically what the Jews call the navl of
[1:22:03] the earth, the belly button of the
[1:22:05] earth. And from there, John looked and
[1:22:07] he saw the city, New Jerusalem,
[1:22:08] descending from God out of heaven, 1,500
[1:22:11] miles, which means geographically, the
[1:22:13] very center point of the top of the
[1:22:14] pyramid, which set right on the very
[1:22:16] center part of Jerusalem. And he looked
[1:22:18] over this way and he said, "How in the
[1:22:21] world can that city set up there?
[1:22:22] Where's the Mediterranean Sea?" And John
[1:22:25] looked at and said, "It's gone.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; The Mediterranean is gone." Well, if he
[1:22:30] casts our sins into the sea and we're
[1:22:33] actually brought back to a state of
[1:22:34] perfection, he's got to get rid of the
[1:22:36] sin holder, don't he?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Don't need no sea. The oceans are here
[1:22:44] because of currents and thermals. Look
[1:22:46] at the hurricanes that's brewing right
[1:22:48] now in the Atlantic. Two of them they're
[1:22:50] suspecting going to be down there. Oh,
[1:22:52] one of these days there'll never be
[1:22:54] another one. Why? You won't need the
[1:22:57] Atlantic. You won't need the Pacific.
[1:22:59] then it'll come back as it was in that
[1:23:01] original state. Glory to God.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah. John didn't say he didn't
[1:23:05] see rivers. He didn't say he didn't see
[1:23:07] streams, but he saw no more sea. Why?
[1:23:10] There be no need of the sea. It will be
[1:23:13] gone.
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:22] We know that whosoever is born of God
[1:23:24] sent not, but he that is begotten of God
[1:23:30] keepeth.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say it?
[1:23:39] Now, wait a minute. I thought the same
[1:23:41] Bible said we're kept by the power of
[1:23:43] God. One and the same.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? Those of you that
[1:23:50] are born again, you are keeping yourself
[1:23:53] from the control tower of the soul.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You're keeping yourself. Not, oh, I'd
[1:24:02] love to run around on my wife. Oh,
[1:24:04] somebody take a picture of me. Shores
[1:24:06] the world. Oh my goodness. Brother Rob
[1:24:08] did one morning again said, "Well, I'll
[1:24:10] tell you one thing. I sure is a pretty
[1:24:11] woman over there. Man, I'd love to have
[1:24:13] her, but somebody tell Sarah shores the
[1:24:15] world. She had divorced me and kicked me
[1:24:17] out of our house and take that fancy new
[1:24:18] car I've got that drives itself. Oh my
[1:24:21] goodness. And Harry and saying, "Boy, I
[1:24:22] tell you one thing. I wish I could cheat
[1:24:24] on my taxes cuz I could get more money.
[1:24:26] That's sorry government. They don't need
[1:24:28] my money. No way. I think I'm going to
[1:24:30] leave this out and leave that out." But
[1:24:31] a man that's born again has got a divine
[1:24:33] government down inside of his soul.
[1:24:36] Amen. It's not what you can do and get
[1:24:38] by with Oh, there ain't nobody around
[1:24:40] looking. Ain't nobody around, but
[1:24:42] there's always one looking up this way.
[1:24:44] And you see, we don't have to do it by
[1:24:46] fear. We do it by divine control. Again,
[1:24:49] I say you're looking for a miracle. Do
[1:24:51] you understand what happens in you every
[1:24:53] day of your life? You brothers living
[1:24:55] out here in the world and the women are
[1:24:57] stripping their yourself off and doing
[1:24:58] what they're doing. You know, I'm always
[1:25:00] love the warm summertime. I love the
[1:25:02] warm weather. But I'm going tell you,
[1:25:03] the worse the world gets, the glider
[1:25:05] more I'm enjoying winter time. At least
[1:25:07] they got to put on some more clothes to
[1:25:09] stay warm. But you look around,
[1:25:11] brothers. What is it that keeps
[1:25:12] yourself? Oh my goodness. I better not
[1:25:14] look at that woman Lindsay will get me
[1:25:16] if I do. I better not look at that
[1:25:17] woman. Carol will get me. It ain't based
[1:25:19] upon Carol getting you. It ain't based
[1:25:21] upon Chrissy getting you. It's based
[1:25:23] upon a divine power of God, a
[1:25:26] supernatural movie. And your eyes as a
[1:25:28] human might go that way, but the control
[1:25:31] tower says, "Nope. Don't do that, boy.
[1:25:34] Don't do that. You'll get in trouble.
[1:25:35] Pull them eyes right back around. A
[1:25:38] miracle just happened inside of you
[1:25:41] because you are made to do that humanly.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for me when this anointing
[1:25:54] waters off after a while.
[1:26:01] He that is begotten of God keepth
[1:26:04] himself
[1:26:07] or herself.
[1:26:10] And that wicked one
[1:26:14] touches him
[1:26:16] not.
[1:26:22] As a prophet's heaven, you're sealed by
[1:26:23] the Holy Ghost and hidden by God in
[1:26:26] Christ. For the devil to get a hold of
[1:26:28] that soul, he'd have to be your brother.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He'd have to cross the bloodline and get
[1:26:32] saved. Ain't no other way the devil can
[1:26:34] get saved. Notice this. In the law
[1:26:36] having a shadow, a man must be born
[1:26:39] again by the spirit of God. And then the
[1:26:41] spirit of the creator himself comes into
[1:26:43] the individual and claims relationship
[1:26:46] as sunship. You see it? Then that person
[1:26:51] is an offspring
[1:26:54] of God.
[1:26:58] Again, yes, sir. God's on the instance
[1:27:01] of delivering anything, he'll make a
[1:27:02] way. When there's no way, he makes a
[1:27:04] way. Any man that believes in him
[1:27:06] believes the same thing. He has to. He's
[1:27:07] a part of God. He's an offspring
[1:27:11] of God.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; He's a son of God or a daughter of God.
[1:27:18] He can't do anything else because God's
[1:27:20] right in him. He's just a portion of
[1:27:23] God.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what your new birth
[1:27:26] is? It's your portion of God.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Once you get it,
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; it's always yours.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; When our saints pass down the curtain of
[1:27:39] time, they take that portion of God with
[1:27:42] them into their theophony.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. One day the spirit of
[1:27:47] God by the law of life will release this
[1:27:50] portion of God in me and in you. And
[1:27:53] this portion of God in us that's helped
[1:27:55] us to live right will then kick over
[1:27:58] into the cycle of transforming our
[1:28:00] bodies.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And you may be standing there combing
[1:28:03] your hair if you got any left, brushing
[1:28:05] your teeth or picking them up out of a
[1:28:06] cup, whichever one you do on the morning
[1:28:08] time. and uh and and you're standing
[1:28:11] there rubbing the polyen off of your
[1:28:13] teeth and uh and uh getting your hair
[1:28:15] situated, you know, or whatever it is
[1:28:17] that you're putting in contacts or or
[1:28:19] washing your glasses. And all of a
[1:28:20] sudden, what all them all them signs of
[1:28:22] mortality and all of a sudden, glory to
[1:28:25] God, there you look and there there's
[1:28:27] mama in the bathroom with you. There's
[1:28:29] your daddy. There's your uncle. There's
[1:28:30] your brother. Except they're not 60
[1:28:32] years old or 70 years old. They're
[1:28:34] actually younger than you are.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know it won't be long.
[1:28:39] You're going to be changed by the power
[1:28:41] of God. What is it? That power is in us
[1:28:44] this morning, children. If it was not
[1:28:47] for the law of God, we would every one
[1:28:50] of us create our own private world and
[1:28:54] go out there and live on it and say no
[1:28:56] trespassing.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It's a good thing we ain't got that
[1:29:02] power cuz we'd be further apart than
[1:29:03] what we are now. Some of y'all would had
[1:29:06] to flew in from your own planet for
[1:29:08] church and you'd said, "It's too far to
[1:29:10] go to church. I'm way out here. You know
[1:29:11] how many ever light years out? We'll
[1:29:13] just stay home and stream."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We're in the image of God. God is
[1:29:22] a creator. That's the reason that you
[1:29:24] can believe God could heal a person
[1:29:27] because God
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; is in you.
[1:29:34] If a man's born of the spirit of God,
[1:29:36] he's an offspring
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:29:41] And that part of God is in him.
[1:29:46] And he believes every word that God says
[1:29:48] or materialize. And so that makes him
[1:29:51] part of God. The Holy Spirit and the man
[1:29:55] makes him part of God. So God is
[1:29:58] supernatural and that part of God in us
[1:30:02] will make us believe in the supernatural
[1:30:06] which in turn makes us participating
[1:30:10] of godliness in a divine way. Only those
[1:30:15] who have this within them come from
[1:30:17] their soul. Now there's many people with
[1:30:19] intellectual faith can say, "Oh yes, I I
[1:30:21] believe God can heal the sick. I I
[1:30:23] believe God can do that." But they
[1:30:25] themselves are not truly born again. But
[1:30:27] they will run up on something eventually
[1:30:29] that they not sure God can take care of.
[1:30:32] But there ain't ne nothing that a son or
[1:30:34] daughter of God that's born of the Holy
[1:30:36] Ghost will ever face that they can't
[1:30:38] believe their God is bigger than it all.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And even if he wills not to, they still
[1:30:42] praise him because they said, "Well, I
[1:30:44] know he could. He just didn't want to.
[1:30:46] It just wasn't his will." So they're not
[1:30:47] defeated whether he does it or whether
[1:30:49] they don't. Oh, hallelujah. Why? because
[1:30:52] they are supernatural
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; from the soul. Notice again, I believe
[1:30:57] that man when he's born of God, he
[1:30:59] becomes the son of God. The supernatural
[1:31:01] power of God dwells in him.
[1:31:06] We have a supernatural God. We have a
[1:31:09] supernatural life. We have I believe
[1:31:13] that many that's born of the
[1:31:14] supernatural spirit believes in the
[1:31:16] supernatural. Listen, it's your
[1:31:18] supernatural realm. We got a
[1:31:21] supernatural resurrection. We got a
[1:31:24] supernatural heaven. Oh, praise the
[1:31:27] Lord. We'll have a supernatural rapture.
[1:31:31] I believe the whole thing is built
[1:31:34] around the supernatural. Then why,
[1:31:36] children, could we not believe that God
[1:31:39] could heal us when we're sick? Why would
[1:31:41] we believe God cannot deliver us of a
[1:31:44] besetting sin that we've been fighting
[1:31:46] for years?
[1:31:48] Yes.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; If a man's born of the spirit of God, he
[1:31:53] believes in the supernatural.
[1:31:56] He can't help it.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So, does it sound like to you that he's
[1:32:08] sitting around trying
[1:32:13] What are you doing? I'm trying to
[1:32:14] believe. I'm trying to believe. If
[1:32:16] you're born of the spirit of God, you
[1:32:18] can't keep from believing.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; You can't keep from believing even when
[1:32:23] it makes no sense why godliness is
[1:32:27] displaying itself in the supernatural
[1:32:30] realm of your soul.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; A man born of the spirit, he believes in
[1:32:38] the supernatural. He can't help it
[1:32:40] because he's
[1:32:43] the son of God.
[1:32:47] That's the reason tonight we've got so
[1:32:49] many old cold formal indifferent god
[1:32:53] forsaken
[1:32:55] backsliden churches
[1:32:57] because men and women are not born of
[1:32:59] the spirit of God. They have no taste
[1:33:05] of God.
[1:33:09] Lord, don't never let our church become
[1:33:10] that.
[1:33:12] You've got to get the man right in his
[1:33:15] heart first
[1:33:18] before he can believe.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; He ain't got nothing to believe on.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice that he
[1:33:27] doesn't just say with
[1:33:30] that. He has nothing to believe with. He
[1:33:32] has nothing. Two parts. Nothing to
[1:33:35] believe with and nothing to believe on.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; We mean on. It's a deposit of God in
[1:33:44] your soul and on that is where you stand
[1:33:47] and it brings the wis.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Thank you Lord. He
[1:33:52] ain't got nothing to believe on. He
[1:33:54] ain't got nothing to believe with. But
[1:33:56] you take any divine promise in your
[1:33:59] heart and say that's my personal
[1:34:01] property. It belongs to me. I am a
[1:34:05] believer and accept it on that basis.
[1:34:07] And watch what it'll do. It'll make
[1:34:09] cancers move. Have we seen it with our
[1:34:12] own eyes? It will make cancers move.
[1:34:15] It'll make blind eyes come open. It'll
[1:34:18] make cripples walk. It'll make the deaf
[1:34:20] hear. I know what I'm talking about. For
[1:34:23] I put it to a test to an experience now
[1:34:25] for years and years around the world.
[1:34:28] And the whole world knows about it.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hang on a few more minutes on
[1:34:39] this ride, shall we? Deity itself
[1:34:43] lives in every believer.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Every man that's born of the spirit of
[1:34:50] God is a part of God. No wonder he
[1:34:54] believes in the supernatural. No wonder
[1:34:56] he can believe in anything. Why is it in
[1:34:58] him is a portion of God wrapped up in
[1:35:01] that mortal body. Oh, hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:35:05] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:08] Let me skip on Daniel down here in the
[1:35:09] inner veil. Let a man or a woman that
[1:35:11] don't believe in the supernatural, let a
[1:35:13] man or woman that can't believe the days
[1:35:14] of miracles, let them hide behind the
[1:35:17] holiest of holies and the veil
[1:35:21] of God's son.
[1:35:25] Here's the veil
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; that must drop behind you.
[1:35:32] Oh.
[1:35:34] Oh, Lord. When I found this Friday, I
[1:35:36] was sitting standing. I thought, "Lord
[1:35:37] Jesus, how have I missed this?" When the
[1:35:40] veil of God's son
[1:35:44] will drop between them and the world,
[1:35:49] this is why you cannot go back to the
[1:35:51] world because the veil
[1:35:55] God
[1:35:56] is standing between you and the world.
[1:35:59] There's no way back. You have no desire
[1:36:01] to go back anyway.
[1:36:06] God's son fell between you
[1:36:10] and the holy
[1:36:12] and the holy place.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:20] And the veil of God's son will drop
[1:36:24] between them and the world. And less
[1:36:26] than 24 hours, they'll believe every
[1:36:30] word of God's word is the truth. less
[1:36:34] than 24 hours. Well, I sure don't
[1:36:36] understand people that's been around for
[1:36:37] 24 years and they still don't believe
[1:36:39] it. Or 34 years or even four years. Come
[1:36:42] on, somebody. If we ever get in there
[1:36:45] and let the veil of God's son drop
[1:36:47] behind us, oh my, before the breaking of
[1:36:50] another day, we will be a changed person
[1:36:53] and the devil will be screaming down in
[1:36:56] hell. Oh no, another one. Oh no, another
[1:36:59] one. Another one born of God. another
[1:37:03] offspring of God.
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:13] And if anyone that knew that God always
[1:37:16] dwells
[1:37:18] in supernatural because God himself
[1:37:22] is supernatural and his children which
[1:37:25] are his offspring
[1:37:28] is the nature
[1:37:30] of their father.
[1:37:33] They also believe in the supernatural.
[1:37:37] So if they cannot believe in the
[1:37:39] supernatural, then the spirit of God
[1:37:43] is not in them.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Dominating
[1:37:49] dominating
[1:37:51] their life.
[1:37:57] God
[1:37:59] is supernatural. Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; And this supernatural power just ain't
[1:38:07] limited to the preachers in the message.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; It's in every son or daughter of God.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Don't make no difference how color your
[1:38:16] skin is, how much money you got, your
[1:38:19] wealth has nothing to do with that.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; It has to do with almighty God
[1:38:24] depositing, quickening the seed in you
[1:38:26] by the spirit word. And he pulls you in
[1:38:30] behind the veil. His son. So his son is
[1:38:33] standing there. Lord have mercy. His son
[1:38:37] is standing there between you and the
[1:38:40] world.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; You'll never be a sinner again.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Truly, there is a point of no return.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Esau reached that place. He could never
[1:38:54] come back. A nation reached that place.
[1:38:58] in 1956.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. They think revival is going
[1:39:03] to break out because of Charlie Kirk,
[1:39:05] not a God-given revival.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Revival don't come by a man being
[1:39:10] assassinated because he stand for what
[1:39:12] he thinks is right.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Revival comes by the son of God paying
[1:39:16] the price already.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Some of you Republicans,
[1:39:19] don't get mad at me. Revival is not
[1:39:21] brought by Charlie Kirk. It ain't
[1:39:22] brought by Donnie Reagan. It ain't going
[1:39:24] to be brought by Ron Spencer. Revival
[1:39:25] comes when the sovereign God sends
[1:39:27] revival.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And revival for America is over and done
[1:39:31] with.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; But I don't believe a revival for word
[1:39:34] of life is done. I don't believe where
[1:39:37] the revival for Donnie Reagan is done. I
[1:39:39] believe I can live in that presence of
[1:39:42] God and I can hallelujah while the world
[1:39:44] is dying. And a lot of the message folks
[1:39:46] may want to die, but it don't mean that
[1:39:48] we decide to die. It simply means we
[1:39:51] have a an oasis in the middle of the
[1:39:54] desert. Are we in a dry time? Yes, we
[1:39:56] are. But I believe our church, our life,
[1:40:00] our glory to God, our message can be an
[1:40:02] oasis in a dry, barren desert. What
[1:40:05] about it, children? Do you want to
[1:40:07] wander around in the desert? Or do you
[1:40:09] want a revival in your soul that stirs
[1:40:12] you to the love of God that stirs you to
[1:40:15] virtue and brotherly kindness and the
[1:40:17] love of God and make you so much like
[1:40:20] Jesus that when Jesus come he will take
[1:40:23] you in the rapture?
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:44] Hallelujah.
[1:40:47] Oh, glory to God.
[1:40:54] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:40:57] to be like
[1:40:59] God.
[1:41:03] Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:17] Let's bear us together.
[1:41:31] Oh God,
[1:41:34] heavenly father.
[1:41:38] Oh Jesus, we need you so much today.
[1:41:40] Lord,
[1:41:46] I pray for every man, woman, boy, and
[1:41:48] girl that's
[1:41:51] in this visible audience, but for those
[1:41:52] also, Lord, that are streaming or we'll
[1:41:55] go back and archive this service.
[1:42:00] Lord, I believed it for a long time
[1:42:03] that one reason a lot of folks around
[1:42:04] this message have such a hard time
[1:42:06] overcoming
[1:42:08] is because they've never yet entered
[1:42:09] into that secret place.
[1:42:13] They believe the message.
[1:42:15] They believe this prophet was sent from
[1:42:17] you and they want to go to church and
[1:42:19] they want to pay their ti and they want
[1:42:20] to do a lot of good things.
[1:42:24] But still, there's something there,
[1:42:26] Lord, that hinders them from living the
[1:42:30] completely surrendered life that they
[1:42:33] want to.
[1:42:35] I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus,
[1:42:40] you, that great pillar of fire who come
[1:42:42] down on the day of Pentecost,
[1:42:45] may you come into this place today.
[1:42:48] Lord God, we believe you're the same
[1:42:50] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:42:53] We know what happened on the day of
[1:42:55] Pentecost was not just just for Peter
[1:42:59] and James and Mary and those 120 on that
[1:43:02] day, but we believe it's for you and
[1:43:05] your children, them that are far off,
[1:43:06] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:43:08] call.
[1:43:10] Now, we know we have no other record
[1:43:13] in the New Testament
[1:43:15] when the Holy Ghost fell on any other
[1:43:17] people
[1:43:19] that they actually saw the pillar of
[1:43:21] fire dividing itself.
[1:43:24] We have no other record in the book of
[1:43:26] Acts
[1:43:29] that tongues of fire set upon each of
[1:43:31] them.
[1:43:32] It happened that one spot and as far as
[1:43:34] we know historically and from the
[1:43:36] scripture, it never happened quite like
[1:43:39] that again. which shows us the
[1:43:41] significance
[1:43:43] was not them visible licks
[1:43:46] but rather the invisible licks
[1:43:49] which went inside their soul.
[1:43:54] So when it fell at Cornelius's house,
[1:43:57] when it fell when Paul went to Ephesus
[1:43:59] there and preached at the upper coast of
[1:44:01] Ephesus, when it fell in the different
[1:44:04] places, there's no no scripture
[1:44:06] mentioned that visible licks of fire set
[1:44:10] upon them,
[1:44:12] but they received the Holy Ghost, which
[1:44:15] is the invisible licks of fire.
[1:44:19] So, Father, it don't hap have to happen
[1:44:21] exactly today for us where we'll see
[1:44:24] licks of fire in everybody's head. If
[1:44:26] you want to do that, sure, you can do
[1:44:27] that.
[1:44:29] But we know one thing. The main thing we
[1:44:31] need is them invisible licks to come
[1:44:34] down inside of our soul
[1:44:37] and deposit the supernatural God
[1:44:39] himself.
[1:44:41] It won't eliminate our battles. It won't
[1:44:43] eliminate our trials,
[1:44:45] but it'll give us astronaut power from
[1:44:49] within our soul
[1:44:51] to deal with him in a way that we never
[1:44:53] knew was possible.
[1:44:58] Oh Lord Jesus, we're not living in the
[1:44:59] horse and buggy days.
[1:45:02] If these people were to leave service
[1:45:04] today and have to stop by a gas station
[1:45:05] to get gas for their vehicle
[1:45:08] and they would see an Amish guy or a
[1:45:10] Menite guy
[1:45:12] and there he was in his buggy and his
[1:45:14] horse and he had his his horse's mouth
[1:45:17] open and he had that gas pump
[1:45:22] that we put in our car stuck in that
[1:45:25] horse's mouth.
[1:45:27] We'd want to report that guy for animal
[1:45:29] abuse.
[1:45:31] Why? Wrong fuel for the wrong power.
[1:45:36] What will he have? He'll have a a bag
[1:45:38] where he can put over his head with oats
[1:45:40] in it. The power matches the animal.
[1:45:45] Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] Luther's lived his day. The days of
[1:45:49] buggies is over. Airplanes,
[1:45:52] Pentecostals,
[1:45:54] them days are over.
[1:45:56] Now we're in the days of astronauts.
[1:46:01] But Lord, we'll never be able to put
[1:46:03] this spaceship into the air if we just
[1:46:06] hang a bag of oats on it.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Or even Lord, if we try to take regular
[1:46:11] gasoline
[1:46:13] and put it in the spaceship, it'll never
[1:46:15] fly. So our our spacecraft cannot be
[1:46:19] powered with Pentecostal gasoline.
[1:46:23] It must be
[1:46:26] rocket fuel.
[1:46:28] Rocket fuel.
[1:46:31] Oh, petrol works fine for our cars, our
[1:46:34] trucks.
[1:46:35] Yeah, it works fine. It's what it's made
[1:46:37] for.
[1:46:39] It worked fine for Pentecost, the
[1:46:40] restoration of gifts. But a repeat of
[1:46:43] that is not going to bring the bride the
[1:46:44] revival she needs.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; we've done seen what your prophet has
[1:46:49] told us about them gifts. He said,
[1:46:50] "Where there's gifts, there's confusion.
[1:46:53] And where there's gifts, they bring
[1:46:56] division.
[1:46:58] I hate to say it, Lord, but I saw it
[1:46:59] when I was in Pentecost. I'm seeing it
[1:47:01] again in the message. It's divided us.
[1:47:04] Preachers weren't even preaching no more
[1:47:06] together. Preachers won't hardly speak
[1:47:08] to one another. What's divided us? Who
[1:47:10] ever thought it? It would be the gifts
[1:47:12] again.
[1:47:14] Preachers that used to be so close and
[1:47:16] their church is so close, but not no
[1:47:18] more. Why gifts divided us?
[1:47:22] The prophet told us the reason why.
[1:47:25] He said, "If we lay aside all the gifts
[1:47:27] till we get perfect love, then the gifts
[1:47:30] would come after the perfect love and
[1:47:33] would have perfect gifts."
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; So instead of seeking for perfect love,
[1:47:38] we've sought after the gifts because we
[1:47:39] got impatient.
[1:47:41] It's a it's a righteous desire. We want
[1:47:43] to move with God, but we want it so bad
[1:47:47] that we've overstepped the steps up the
[1:47:50] pyramid. and preachers preaching against
[1:47:52] one another, taking texts and preaching
[1:47:54] against this preacher and that preacher
[1:47:56] and this church and that church and
[1:47:57] bashing one another.
[1:47:59] And Lord, you know how we need each
[1:48:01] other in this day.
[1:48:04] It's divided young people. It's divided
[1:48:06] families. It's divided friends. It's
[1:48:08] been friends for years. Why? It's not
[1:48:11] being manifested in perfect love. Error.
[1:48:15] I see this. I saw that. The Lord told me
[1:48:17] this. The Lord said that. The Lord said
[1:48:19] that. And then the law these the Lord
[1:48:21] says ain't come to pass which we know
[1:48:23] you never say anything that don't
[1:48:24] happen.
[1:48:27] Oh God help us.
[1:48:29] Lord began with the preachers.
[1:48:32] As I sent Carol a quote yesterday where
[1:48:34] brother Bram said I'm not pointing this
[1:48:35] to the leoty now talking about that. He
[1:48:38] said but it's the preachers fault.
[1:48:41] It's the preachers.
[1:48:43] Help us preachers Lord God.
[1:48:46] Help us, Father,
[1:48:49] that we can be so filled with your power
[1:48:52] that we'll not only pray for the sick,
[1:48:55] but we'll love those that speak against
[1:48:57] us
[1:48:59] with a perfect love.
[1:49:02] Praise be to God.
[1:49:06] Would you mind laying your hand on that
[1:49:08] person standing beside you there?
[1:49:13] Hallelujah.
[1:49:17] How many will say before God, no one
[1:49:19] looking around now, please with your
[1:49:21] uplifted hand, Lord,
[1:49:24] I need more of you in my life. I need
[1:49:28] more of these virtues, Jesus.
[1:49:30] Oh, you've answered prayers for me.
[1:49:32] Father, I've seen this and that and the
[1:49:33] other, but Lord, I I know I don't have
[1:49:35] the love that I need.
[1:49:38] I don't have the patience that I need. I
[1:49:40] don't have the brotherly kindness, the
[1:49:41] godliness.
[1:49:43] I see after this today, Lord, I I I need
[1:49:45] to live in a more supernatural realm.
[1:49:48] I've been trying to overcome these
[1:49:50] things in my life. I've had the wrong
[1:49:51] understanding, but I need to let your
[1:49:54] power from within me dominate my life.
[1:49:59] So, all I need to do is let go and let
[1:50:02] God,
[1:50:04] heavenly fathers, who have our hands
[1:50:06] laid one upon the other.
[1:50:09] I'm praying for all of them today, Lord.
[1:50:11] I wouldn't have the physical strength to
[1:50:13] be able to pray for all of them. But I
[1:50:16] pray, dear God, that you'd go. May your
[1:50:18] anointing and your presence be able to
[1:50:20] minister through the hands of these sons
[1:50:22] and daughters of yours
[1:50:25] as they're praying for one another.
[1:50:27] Lord, maybe some of them have struggled
[1:50:29] with this besetting sin or this wrong or
[1:50:32] this sickness or whatever it is that
[1:50:34] they're dealing with in their life and
[1:50:35] they wondered, but today they've heard.
[1:50:38] They have heard something. It's going to
[1:50:40] be a key to the door in their life. Lord
[1:50:43] Jesus, we need you like never before. I
[1:50:46] confess it before you, Father. I once
[1:50:49] was young as David said. Now I'm old.
[1:50:52] But Lord God, I'll have to say I've
[1:50:54] never seen you not fulfill your word.
[1:50:58] But Lord, even though I'm an old
[1:50:59] preacher, an old man,
[1:51:02] I'm still not to the place that I can't
[1:51:04] be taught and I can't learn and I can't
[1:51:08] be corrected.
[1:51:09] So, Father, I desire to know more about
[1:51:12] you, Jesus. I want more of you through
[1:51:15] my life. Lord, I thought when I got to
[1:51:18] be an older man, everything would be a
[1:51:20] lot easier. I'm under more stress and
[1:51:23] pressure and pull and everything in the
[1:51:25] world than I've ever been in my entire
[1:51:27] life. Lord, talking to some of the
[1:51:29] preachers down at the men's meeting the
[1:51:31] other night, just hearing them and them
[1:51:33] the same way, dealing with some of the
[1:51:35] same stuff. And we know it's around the
[1:51:37] world and your children here today would
[1:51:39] say the same thing. They're dealing with
[1:51:41] so many things in their home, on their
[1:51:43] job, in school. Oh Lord, we need you
[1:51:45] like never before. Father, we realize
[1:51:48] what we're dealing with is a
[1:51:50] supernatural on the other side. What's
[1:51:52] causing all this rebellion? What's
[1:51:54] causing all this protesting in our
[1:51:56] nation? What's going on, Lord? It's the
[1:51:59] manifestation of the supernatural on the
[1:52:02] other side. pre-tribulation anointing is
[1:52:06] coming on the earth.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Lord. And here the United Nations
[1:52:10] meeting just this week in New York City.
[1:52:13] And when Benjamin Netanyahu got up to
[1:52:15] give his speech, a great mass of those
[1:52:19] representatives from the around the
[1:52:20] world got up and walked out. And the
[1:52:24] majority of those nations voted to give
[1:52:27] statethood to a Palestinian state. And
[1:52:30] then this morning I read where 47
[1:52:34] of our politicians here in America,
[1:52:36] Democrats,
[1:52:39] pleading with our president to recognize
[1:52:42] a Palestinian state. I don't care. I
[1:52:44] ain't Democrat and Republican. Makes no
[1:52:46] difference to me. It's just the fact of
[1:52:47] it. What is it, Lord? It's the
[1:52:50] pre-tribulation anointing that's coming
[1:52:52] on the earth
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; to come against Israel.
[1:52:57] And as we watch them so we can see the
[1:52:59] bride. Lord, sometimes we pray and read
[1:53:02] our Bible and it seems our prayers go no
[1:53:04] higher than our head. We read our Bible
[1:53:07] and we struggle and we struggle. Lord,
[1:53:10] oh, it's so much easier and we get so
[1:53:12] much more out of our smartphone than we
[1:53:14] do the Bible. Oh yeah, we're addicted to
[1:53:16] our phones. It can't ding or buzz or
[1:53:19] whistle or whatever it does and we have
[1:53:21] to grab it immediately and look at it.
[1:53:23] And yet we have your Bible on our
[1:53:25] phones. And do we look at it? Help us,
[1:53:28] Lord God.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord Jesus, in this hour.
[1:53:34] Father, we desire to be a supernatural
[1:53:37] people
[1:53:39] that overcomes by this great power
[1:53:42] living in us. We know, Lord, the
[1:53:43] difference between this inward life and
[1:53:46] the anointing is so vast. You never
[1:53:49] overcome by the anointing on you. You
[1:53:53] overcome, oh hallelujah, by that great
[1:53:56] virtue of who you were and what was
[1:53:58] there in your commission and in the
[1:54:01] promise given to you in sunship. If you
[1:54:04] would have overcome with the anointing,
[1:54:07] then you could have never overcome death
[1:54:09] cuz your prophet tells us in forsaking
[1:54:11] all that the anointing left you in the
[1:54:14] garden of Gethsemane. You did not die
[1:54:16] feeling it. You felt it. All right?
[1:54:19] pain, agony,
[1:54:21] sorrow. Oh Jesus, help us today. Father,
[1:54:25] I pray.
[1:54:26] We love you, Lord God.
[1:54:29] We worship you, Jesus.
[1:54:32] Can we just raise our hands, saints? In
[1:54:34] the presence of the Lord,
[1:54:37] there sing something. Let's just worship
[1:54:39] him now. Close your eyes.
[1:54:42] Open your heart. Maybe God
[1:54:45] spoke to some of you today and helped
[1:54:48] you to realize
[1:54:50] you do not have the Holy Ghost in your
[1:54:52] soul.
[1:54:54] You thought maybe for a long time you
[1:54:57] did or maybe you've questioned whether
[1:54:58] you did or not. But maybe you've heard
[1:55:01] something that let you know
[1:55:04] you're missing something.
[1:55:07] You're missing something.
[1:55:11] Hallelujah.
[1:55:14] You can receive it right here today.
[1:55:18] It's not necessary for you to come to
[1:55:20] the altar. You can if you wish to, of
[1:55:21] course. Well, I'm going to tar for the
[1:55:24] Holy Ghost. You don't need to.
[1:55:27] You don't have to tar.
[1:55:29] that God do is open your will
[1:55:32] and give everything you are to him and
[1:55:36] let him move from your spirit if that's
[1:55:38] where he is
[1:55:40] over into your soul
[1:55:43] and make you one of his offspring this
[1:55:45] morning.
[1:55:47] Hallelujah
[1:55:49] Jesus, we worship you, Lord God.
[1:55:54] Father, I can preach to them. I can pray
[1:55:56] for them. I can counsel them. I can try
[1:55:58] to do everything I can. But now this
[1:56:01] moves out of the hands of any man.
[1:56:05] This moves even out of the the desires
[1:56:08] and the wishes of their pastor. Oh, I
[1:56:10] want every one of them to be filled with
[1:56:12] the Holy Ghost. Every young person,
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; I want their lives so dominated by the
[1:56:18] spirit of God.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; But I can't give it to no one.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, would you come down, Father?
[1:56:27] as you did there on the day of
[1:56:29] Pentecost, as you did at the upper coast
[1:56:30] of Ephesus, as you did at the household
[1:56:33] of Cornelius.
[1:56:36] Hallelujah.
[1:56:38] Father God, fill your people.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe with all of my heart
[1:56:44] there's people who genuinely here have
[1:56:46] the Holy Ghost, but maybe they feel like
[1:56:49] I do today. Lord, they need to refill
[1:56:50] him.
[1:56:52] Oh Jesus, we know the apostles gathered
[1:56:54] there just not not long after the Holy
[1:56:56] Ghost fell initially and they gathered
[1:56:58] and prayed and here you come again.
[1:57:01] Oh God, I pray for those who have the
[1:57:03] Holy Ghost. May there be a refilling, oh
[1:57:06] Lord,
[1:57:08] praise be to God. For those who need
[1:57:11] healing, oh yes, may the healing virtue
[1:57:14] flow through the bodies.
[1:57:16] We worship you, Lord God.
[1:57:20] We worship you, Lord God.
[1:57:23] Whatever you have in need of now,
[1:57:25] friends, open your hearts to the Lord
[1:57:28] Jesus.
[1:57:30] Just tell him what you need. Lord, I
[1:57:31] need a refilling. Lord, I I need the
[1:57:34] Holy Ghost. Lord, I I need I need
[1:57:36] healing in my body. Lord, I need a move
[1:57:39] in my finances. You see, Father, we're
[1:57:40] we're in a we're in a mess. I need to
[1:57:43] move, Lord. Lord God, I need to move in
[1:57:46] my my walk with God. Lord, I I haven't
[1:57:49] felt anything for a long time. I'm
[1:57:51] getting I can't feel empathy. I can't
[1:57:53] feel sympathy. I can't feel the presence
[1:57:55] of God. It's like I'm just numb. Lord,
[1:57:58] pass by my way today, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:58:05] Hallelujah, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:08] We worship you, Lord God. We magnify
[1:58:10] your name, Father.
[1:58:13] Lord, this presence we worship you.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Come today, Lord Jesus, I pray.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Touch the hearts of your children. Lord,
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; give us that which we have made. Oh,
[1:58:25] Lord. We need this more than our our our
[1:58:28] meal that we're going to eat after a
[1:58:30] while.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; We need this more than our car, more
[1:58:33] than our house.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Even more than our jobs.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. I pray in the name of
[1:58:39] Jesus.
[1:58:41] Lord, some of them lost their joy.
[1:58:44] Restore their joy today, Lord. Some of
[1:58:47] them, Father, to burden down with the
[1:58:48] things of life. Help them, Lord God.
[1:58:51] Lift them, dear Jesus.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord God.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Father.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; We bless your name, Lord God.
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's love him, saints. Let's just
[1:59:09] love him together.
[1:59:13] Thank you, Lord Jesus. We worship you,
[1:59:15] Father.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. Let the angel of the
[1:59:21] Lord move to this place today, Lord God.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May sickness see him stand
[1:59:28] in there and back off. May disease see
[1:59:32] him stand in there and back off. May the
[1:59:34] blood of the Lord Jesus come through
[1:59:36] this place today, Father. Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] May oppression leave the children of
[1:59:41] God. May sadness leave them today,
[1:59:45] Father, in the name of Jesus.
[1:59:49] I bless you,
[1:59:51] your hand.
[1:59:55] Do it, children. Do it. Give yourself to
[1:59:59] him. Don't give him half of yourself, a
[2:00:02] third of yourself. Give him your all.
[2:00:08] You can use me, Lord. Give myself away.
[2:00:12] Hallelujah, Jesus.
[2:00:15] Oh,
[2:00:18] I give myself
[2:00:20] away so you
[2:00:24] can use me. Take my heart.
[2:00:30] Take my life
[2:00:34] as
[2:00:36] a livinging
[2:00:38] sacrifice.
[2:00:42] All my dreams
[2:00:46] and all my plans.
[2:00:51] Lord, I place
[2:00:54] him in your hands.
[2:00:58] I give myself away.
[2:01:02] Sing it out, children. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:01:06] I give myself away
[2:01:10] so you
[2:01:12] can use me. I give myself
[2:01:18] away.
[2:01:23] I give myself away
[2:01:26] so you
[2:01:28] can use me. Here I am.
[2:01:35] Here I stand.
[2:01:39] Lord, the rest of my life
[2:01:42] it's in
[2:01:44] your hands.
[2:01:47] Lord,
[2:01:49] I long
[2:01:52] to see
[2:01:55] your
[2:01:56] desires
[2:01:59] be revealed
[2:02:01] and healing.
[2:02:03] I give myself
[2:02:05] away or just love him. Just love him
[2:02:09] all. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; You can use me. I give myself
[2:02:21] away.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I do, Lord. I give myself
[2:02:29] away
[2:02:30] so you
[2:02:33] can me.
[2:02:37] We got this prayer request here for
[2:02:39] Sister Linda Jablonska. She was taken to
[2:02:41] Sycamore Scholes to get checked out for
[2:02:43] blood pressure dropping and dizziness.
[2:02:47] Let's join together right now for our
[2:02:48] sister.
[2:02:50] Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord
[2:02:52] Jesus, you see dear God what this is
[2:02:56] with Sister Linda. We're praying for our
[2:02:58] sister right now. Lord, we agree
[2:03:01] together as the saints of God. And we
[2:03:03] pray move for her, Lord. We don't just
[2:03:06] pray that you would eliminate the
[2:03:08] symptoms, but rather you would go to the
[2:03:11] cause. Whatever's causing this low blood
[2:03:13] pressure in the name of Jesus, may it
[2:03:17] leave her now. Father,
[2:03:19] in Jesus name, I give myself away.
[2:03:29] I give myself away
[2:03:33] so you

[2:19:11] so much stuff just in that one little
[2:19:14] experience that she had. She couldn't
[2:19:16] remember your name.
[2:19:20] So she went back to the preacher who was
[2:19:22] still there
[2:19:25] and she said, "Sir,
[2:19:28] I I experienced something that night and
[2:19:31] something changed me,
[2:19:34] but I can't remember the name of the one
[2:19:37] you told me died for me. Would
[2:19:41] you tell me his name again?

[2:20:12] and worshiping and blessing your name
[2:20:15] while we live through the ceaseless
[2:20:17] ages. And there will be no time.

[2:20:27] We love you today, Lord Jesus.
