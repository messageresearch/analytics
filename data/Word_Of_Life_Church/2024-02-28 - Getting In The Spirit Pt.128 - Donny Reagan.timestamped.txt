[34:18] well if he said that
[34:20] 1964 you wonder what it is now in
[34:24] 2024 it ought to be the very hope of
[34:27] what we live for every day of our life
[34:29] shouldn't it praise the Lord let us U
[34:33] read in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 if you
[34:35] would
[34:37] tonight I guess we're still on brother
[34:39] Joe brother Rob for the question answers
[34:41] tomorrow night at 7 7:00
[34:44] okay um 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse
[34:52] 24 for our comely Parts have no need but
[34:56] God has
[34:57] tempered the body
[35:00] together tempered to mix together
[35:04] co-mingle to unite cause several parts
[35:10] to combine into an
[35:13] organic
[35:15] structure which is the body to unite one
[35:19] thing to another but God has tempered
[35:23] the body together having given more
[35:26] abundant honor to that part which
[35:30] lacked if the lacking Parts could be
[35:33] able to accept that how smooth
[35:36] everything would truly be now Paul's
[35:39] taking the Natural Body the anatomy of
[35:41] the human body and running a parallel to
[35:44] the spiritual body of Christ notice in
[35:47] verse 25 that there should be no Schism
[35:52] division rent metaphorically it's a
[35:55] division or A dissension now the reason
[35:59] that God would give more abundant honor
[36:01] to the part which is uncomely is to
[36:03] equal out so that it wouldn't cause
[36:07] Schism or division in the body in other
[36:10] words no big eyes and little use and
[36:15] this one's really important and this one
[36:17] sort of kind of important and that one
[36:19] ain't important but if we could realize
[36:21] that God places them there actually
[36:24] diversity to me expresses the Great
[36:26] greatness of God we will always have
[36:29] diversity you say in heaven absolutely
[36:32] In Heaven There Will Be
[36:34] degrees in
[36:36] heaven you didn't know that well the
[36:38] prophet said that word for word just
[36:40] what I told you degrees in heaven but
[36:43] you see the part about degrees that
[36:47] bothers us now will not be there there
[36:51] will be degrees in heaven there always
[36:53] has been and always will be and all of
[36:55] that in heaven the part that that
[36:56] bothers humans about it now will be
[36:59] missing so everybody will be fine with
[37:03] it I guarantee I I could ask you tonight
[37:05] what do you think the ideal temperature
[37:07] will be in
[37:09] heaven and some of you all are at a very
[37:11] dangerous time in your life right
[37:15] now temperature wise I'm talking about
[37:18] and some of you would probably think oh
[37:20] dear God I hope it's at least
[37:23] 58 58 others of You Are pass that time
[37:27] in your life and you're hoping it's
[37:28] going to be 75 and some of you thinking
[37:30] it's going to be 80 me and Carol was
[37:32] talking about it yesterday and I told
[37:33] you know the thing of it is whatever
[37:35] it's going to be it'll be absolutely
[37:37] perfect and what's amazing is nobody
[37:42] will
[37:43] complain wow forget the gates of pearl
[37:47] forget streets of gold there'll be
[37:50] nobody complaining nobody arguing nobody
[37:54] debating nobody fussing won't that be
[37:57] awesome it's almost more than what we
[37:59] can
[38:00] imagine but I really believe that there
[38:02] can be this Unity of the spirit of God
[38:04] and among the people before we get there
[38:07] let's read this scripture we Clos that
[38:09] with last Wednesday night Romans
[38:11] 16:17 now beseech you Brethren mark them
[38:15] which cause divisions and offenses
[38:18] contrary to the doctrine which you have
[38:22] learned and avoid them no doubt Paul
[38:25] hated and absolutely hated to have to
[38:29] deal with these things Corinthian Church
[38:31] was a was a church that was had so many
[38:34] issues and problems but in
[38:38] reality if it had not have been there
[38:40] and God never caused him but God took
[38:43] the problems in the Corinthian Church
[38:46] and if it had not been for Paul dealing
[38:48] with them in that church we would not
[38:50] have some of these things through the
[38:53] entire New Testament he doesn't mention
[38:56] the Ephesian church galatian church
[38:58] church at Philippi church at
[39:00] thessalonica it's not mentioned anywhere
[39:03] else so God didn't cause it but God took
[39:06] it and caused this Apostle to be able to
[39:09] write things that's still an answer to a
[39:12] lot of the things we deal with today a't
[39:14] that
[39:16] wonderful we're going to pray please
[39:18] pray for juli and Ivy he passed out at
[39:20] work today went to the ER and is now
[39:22] home they did test but didn't find
[39:25] anything so continue to pray for him how
[39:28] many else has a need a request T that on
[39:30] your heart before the
[39:31] Lord Heavenly Father we love you so much
[39:35] we're so thankful Lord
[39:37] Jesus what I just spoke about there for
[39:39] a moment Lord what a perfect place lays
[39:43] before
[39:44] us this world even in its Fallen state
[39:49] is an awesome place to live it can be so
[39:54] beautiful the flowers the trees the
[39:57] animals all the things that you made the
[39:59] heavens the constellations the Stars the
[40:03] universe what an awesome world you have
[40:06] made so we know it's not because of the
[40:10] lack of Beauty and the lack of the hand
[40:13] of the Creator but it's the sin of man
[40:17] dear God how we long for the day when it
[40:19] will be fully redeemed father that all
[40:22] the things that trouble us will be taken
[40:25] away Lord Jesus May every one of us be
[40:29] ready for that hour father we pray for
[40:32] brother Julian tonight that you'd be
[40:34] mindful of him Lord you see what
[40:36] happened to him today and we're praying
[40:38] father there'll be no evil that will
[40:39] come of this you saw the hands that were
[40:42] uplifted signifying different types of
[40:44] needs and requests would you be mindful
[40:47] of them I pray father that you'd help me
[40:49] to get out of the way father speak
[40:51] through me tonight in the name of Jesus
[40:54] we ask and the Saints said said amen God
[40:57] bless you you may be seated read with me
[41:00] now again if you would back in in 1
[41:04] Corinthians where Paul goes on to say
[41:07] about the body 1 Corinthians
[41:10] 12:26 and whether one member suffer all
[41:15] the members suffer with it or one member
[41:20] be honored all the members Rejoice with
[41:25] it now whenever we look at this and we
[41:28] think of what a miraculous thing that
[41:31] that can be that God by a Unity that is
[41:35] beyond any human human Unity could ever
[41:40] produce now we'll take our church
[41:42] tonight we'll use it as an example so we
[41:45] have people from different cultures
[41:47] different backgrounds different
[41:49] ethnicities different racial backgrounds
[41:52] and all that from different religious
[41:55] backgrounds even and yet if God could be
[41:59] able to take each of us and bring us to
[42:02] a place that we would be as they were in
[42:05] the day of Pentecost in that one Accord
[42:07] and with the one mind which was given to
[42:10] us by the Lord what a great thing God
[42:12] can do well then you multiply that by
[42:15] hundreds and thousands of churches that
[42:18] are around the world made up just like
[42:20] ours some of them larger some of them
[42:23] smaller but coming from different parts
[42:25] of the the Earth different religious
[42:28] backgrounds different natural
[42:30] backgrounds and all of that affects who
[42:33] we are so some of us if you'd get in our
[42:36] vehicles after church and some of you
[42:38] would resume the music you were listen
[42:41] to on your way to church some of you
[42:43] it's going to be country gospel some of
[42:45] it it's going to be maybe a little bit
[42:47] more of a modern flare some of you might
[42:50] have a little bit of classical some of
[42:51] you ain't going to have none because you
[42:53] don't care for music no way so can you
[42:55] imagine now you're bring all them people
[42:57] together and you've got all these
[43:00] musicians and their makeup is different
[43:02] song leaders are different special
[43:04] singers are different and then you will
[43:07] sit there and well I really like hearing
[43:09] brother so and so and I really like
[43:11] hearing sister so and so because the
[43:13] style they sing I just like that so well
[43:16] but you know what God made every one of
[43:19] us to be just a little bit different and
[43:22] when we can move beyond our own personal
[43:26] taste well I like this and I like that
[43:29] but so do the other people sitting
[43:31] behind you they have their own life and
[43:34] the ones in front of you and maybe even
[43:36] the one sitting beside you they have
[43:38] their own life so they like a preacher
[43:40] that preaches a certain way and others
[43:42] say I can't understand him he talks too
[43:45] fast um and others say he takes so long
[43:48] to say it come on man say it get it out
[43:52] spit it out and others say Oh Glory to
[43:55] God I just like somebody in the middle
[43:58] and you think how in the world could it
[44:00] ever be that God would bring us all
[44:03] together but he does and he will even
[44:06] greater because this is what he wants to
[44:09] do to bring that unity in such a place
[44:13] don't you understand why Unity is such
[44:15] an important thing to God because it's
[44:18] something the kingdom of Hell will never
[44:23] achieve Satan can have an element of
[44:26] political Unity until you cross your
[44:28] politics and then they fall apart and
[44:30] they can have a religious unity to a
[44:33] certain degree God will produce a unity
[44:36] in his body that the kingdom of Hell
[44:39] cannot even come close to producing
[44:43] ain't that wonderful and God can be able
[44:45] to make people that would be so
[44:48] different from one another but notice
[44:50] how Paul says this that whether one
[44:53] member suffer all the me members suffer
[44:57] with it now that could be a a more of an
[45:00] agreeable tone maybe than what the
[45:03] latter part of this verse would say or
[45:05] one member be honored now I found it as
[45:09] being a pastor that a lot of times
[45:11] sickness and trouble and heartache and
[45:14] despair and sadness and things like that
[45:16] can many times bring people closer
[45:20] together then honor will so if one
[45:24] person is honored in the church
[45:27] especially if it's a preacher or one is
[45:29] more gifted or one is getting more
[45:34] recognition how many people get jealous
[45:37] of people's
[45:39] suffering any of y'all ever got jealous
[45:41] of somebody having a
[45:43] migraine you ever get jealous of anybody
[45:46] having a kidney stone well I tell you
[45:47] right now if you do it's a sign you
[45:49] ain't never had
[45:51] one you ever get jealous of anybody
[45:53] having back paint well shoot I heard
[45:56] this down in their back that makes me so
[45:58] jealous I I can't stand it I'm just
[46:01] wanting that so bad ain't it amazing we
[46:04] don't get jealous of that we don't get
[46:06] jealous of Trials we don't get jealous
[46:09] of testing but we do get jealous of
[46:12] honor and praise and you know one being
[46:16] lifted up but a real true unity in the
[46:19] body can treat honor with the same love
[46:23] and respect and the exact same channel
[46:27] as it can if you hear that brother's
[46:29] sister is down in their back or they're
[46:31] having a physical issue and you oh God
[46:34] oh God please please help them why are
[46:37] we more touched with sadness why are we
[46:40] more touched with pain than we would be
[46:44] with honor is't that something because
[46:47] I'll tell you what it was that that
[46:49] caused Satan's fall in the beginning it
[46:53] was not that he was jealous of God in
[46:56] the sense of God well he knew he
[46:58] couldn't make stars and he knew couldn't
[47:00] create a universe but he wanted to be
[47:02] like him so he said in his heart I will
[47:05] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[47:08] want you to notice he never said I'll
[47:10] exalt my stars above the stars of God he
[47:13] didn't have none and couldn't make none
[47:16] how come he didn't say I'll exalt my
[47:17] Earth above God's Earth he didn't have
[47:20] an earth so he had to take what God made
[47:23] but he did have a strong so what he
[47:26] wanted to do was exalt himself and
[47:29] that's where a lot of this pride and all
[47:31] this sort of thing comes from and
[47:33] jealousy boy I don't know why I'm
[47:35] preaching on this this ain't even in my
[47:36] notes tonight I guess I probably should
[47:38] follow it though you reckon and people
[47:40] wanting recognition of this and that and
[47:43] the other and you find jealousy can be
[47:45] so hard I love the way this early church
[47:49] writer maybe you've never heard of his
[47:51] name before
[47:52] costum costum said said an early church
[47:56] writer when a thorn enters the hill the
[48:00] whole body feels
[48:03] it and is
[48:05] concerned the back
[48:08] bends the belly and the thighs
[48:12] contract now listen at the inside
[48:15] Brothers you don't have it so don't
[48:16] don't look for it uh the back will bend
[48:19] so a thorn enters the hill and whenever
[48:23] it does the bat will be Bend well the
[48:27] back can't bend and the thighs and the
[48:30] belly try to go against them so what do
[48:33] they do this bends which pulls the
[48:36] muscles in your back and these here will
[48:40] contract so they are tightening up in
[48:43] order to allow the back to bend what
[48:46] good would it do for the back to try to
[48:48] bend if these muscles just say I ain't
[48:50] doing it I ain't doing it I ain't doing
[48:52] it I get tired of doing that I get tired
[48:54] of doing that but but what does it do
[48:56] the brain sends the command to the back
[48:59] and the muscles in the back begin to
[49:01] expand and these muscles here from the
[49:04] same control tower in the brain will
[49:06] cause them to be able to contract
[49:09] together in order to allow you to bend
[49:12] now it said the back is concerned and
[49:15] the back will bend the belly and the
[49:16] thighs contract the hands come forward
[49:20] now look at what's happening all
[49:23] instantaneously one working with the
[49:26] other so the back will bend the belly
[49:28] muscles and all that will contract which
[49:31] allows the Torso to bend over and then
[49:33] the hands will begin to reach forward
[49:36] what forward to try to pull that thorn
[49:39] out of the hill now listen to the
[49:41] Insight that this man had to draw out
[49:44] the thorn the head
[49:46] Stoops and the eyes regard the affected
[49:51] member with intense gaze so a little
[49:56] tiny Thorn enters into the foot and all
[50:00] these things start taking place what is
[50:03] that that's a body that's in unison
[50:07] that's a body now the pain isn't in the
[50:10] back and the pain is not in the belly
[50:13] the pain is not in the arms the pain is
[50:17] not in the fingers the pain is not in
[50:19] the eyes but all of the body is reacting
[50:23] in such a way to bring relief to that
[50:27] one little tiny spot that has the thorn
[50:32] isn't that awesome now notice this in 1
[50:35] Corinthians 12: 27 now ye are the body
[50:39] of Christ and members in particular so
[50:43] we're baptized by one Spirit into one
[50:46] body but yet we do not leave lose our
[50:50] particular identity so we will not all
[50:54] be the same hair color in heaven will
[50:56] not all be the same size will not all be
[51:00] the same color we will not all be
[51:02] exactly the same and look exactly the
[51:05] same God is not going to have a copy
[51:07] machine and just keep copying one after
[51:09] another after another all of us look
[51:11] exactly alike that will not be and yet
[51:14] God does the same thing here in this
[51:17] mystical body on the earth and even in
[51:20] Ministry and gifts so God will have some
[51:23] that lean more toward the intellectual
[51:26] side Paul did a a great man of great
[51:28] wisdom and understanding but he did not
[51:30] lean toward the intellect to lead him he
[51:33] let God let the spirit lead his
[51:36] intellect yet Peter was more of a
[51:38] Firebrand type of preacher Andrew a
[51:41] prayer Warrior so God had this diversity
[51:44] inside the body and each one of them
[51:46] found what God wanted them to be now the
[51:50] the mystery of it all is God being able
[51:52] to bring us into that real spot notice
[51:55] what he said now ye are the body of
[51:58] Christ all the members together and
[52:00] members in particular you see true
[52:03] Christians that are truly Born Again of
[52:06] the spirit of God and have the Holy
[52:08] Ghost now listen to these words
[52:09] carefully a true Christian born of the
[52:12] spirit of God and they have the Seal of
[52:15] the Holy Ghost they actually manifest
[52:19] the personal
[52:21] presence the personal presence
[52:25] of Jesus Christ every Christian does not
[52:30] have the ability to manifest the
[52:34] personal presence now that is a Greek
[52:37] word that Paul used in in the New
[52:39] Testament several different places and
[52:41] you've heard it it started a camp many
[52:43] many years ago in our ranks called
[52:45] perusia and what that means is there's
[52:48] two different words that was used for
[52:50] the coming of the Lord one of them was
[52:53] the physical appearing the Corporal
[52:55] appearing and the other was the personal
[52:59] presence appearing now every child of
[53:02] God that is filled with the Holy Ghost
[53:05] has something special about them which
[53:08] is not themsel now as the people of God
[53:12] we can't brag on that because it's not
[53:15] something we prayed for it's not
[53:17] something we fasted for it's something
[53:20] that our father gave us by inheriting
[53:23] his divine nature and that's why
[53:26] sometimes that people will get around
[53:28] members of the Bride real true members
[53:30] of the bride and they'll say there's
[53:32] something different about you where do
[53:34] you go to church there's something
[53:35] different what is it that's different
[53:37] about you I'm fixing to tell you what
[53:40] that is that's the personal presence of
[53:44] the Lord Jesus himself deposited in the
[53:48] female form of him on the earth now
[53:53] Christians denominational Christians
[53:55] other types of Christians do they have
[53:57] something with the Lord absolutely can
[54:00] they say I was lost and God saved me
[54:02] absolutely can they say God deliver me
[54:05] of drinking absolutely but do they have
[54:07] that personal
[54:09] presence I'm not talking about emotion
[54:12] now I'm not talking about just running
[54:14] and jumping and we believe in all of
[54:16] that but there is a personal presence of
[54:20] Christ that is in every member of his
[54:23] body so this is his personal presence
[54:27] among men in Christ was the Incarnate
[54:31] God in the bride his elect body is the
[54:36] Incarnate Christ today so no doubt there
[54:40] was a special something about the Lord
[54:43] Jesus for those who were sensitive
[54:46] toward god brother Charlie Cox told me
[54:48] one time that when brother Brandon would
[54:50] come down hunting and they'd go out
[54:52] hunting squirrels and he'd have squirrel
[54:53] blood all over his clothes and his beard
[54:56] would be all grow out certainly didn't
[54:57] look like a preacher didn't look like a
[54:59] prophet but they'd go in them stores
[55:01] maybe after that hunt on the morning to
[55:03] get them a sandwich or something like
[55:04] that them old guys sitting around
[55:06] whittling y'all know what widdling is
[55:08] that sit around on the front porch
[55:09] whittling and talking spitting Amber out
[55:12] the side of their mouth and whenever
[55:14] brother Brandon would walk by there was
[55:16] just something about him an aura a
[55:19] presence those of you there's some here
[55:21] tonight that was actually around him so
[55:23] they could probably witness that too us
[55:25] and there was something special and no
[55:27] doubt we will never have what God
[55:30] allowed him to have but I believe as the
[55:33] people of God he desires his personal
[55:36] presence to be so expressed out of our
[55:39] lives that people know there's something
[55:43] different about you as a child of God I
[55:46] mean knows what I'm talking about and
[55:48] you've experienced it yourself now
[55:50] whenever that happens to us we do not
[55:53] need to be as if the so we've got
[55:55] something to be happy about ourselves
[55:57] but we should be happy that it is
[56:00] speaking out of Us and other people are
[56:03] able to sense it now how in the world
[56:07] born we born into this world lost
[56:09] unregenerate away from the presence of
[56:11] God could God ever get us back to that
[56:14] spot so we had to be redeemed back to
[56:17] our place in Christ now not before uh
[56:21] the world began of course in the mind of
[56:23] God as a thought alone but well God
[56:25] wanted us to come to substance as he
[56:28] wanted to come to substance himself I
[56:31] love the way the prophet says in future
[56:32] home that he thought about himself as
[56:35] being a human and he transmitted that
[56:39] down to become Jesus so here was this
[56:43] this primary thought of God which was
[56:46] the logos and God thought of himself as
[56:49] being a human now he didn't think of
[56:52] that of course in the form of the early
[56:54] stages of the of the dawn of creation
[56:57] but there was a manifestation of a time
[57:00] limit by which that thought would
[57:02] Express itself had he thought of that
[57:04] initially then he would have come out of
[57:06] the realm invisible and he would have
[57:08] manifested himself in the human body way
[57:11] back Yonder in the eons of Ages ago but
[57:13] he thought about that with a time frame
[57:17] on that thought and you're exactly the
[57:19] same way you see even though we were in
[57:21] the mind of God in the mind of the
[57:22] Eternal but God had a time frame on the
[57:26] span of your life so there was a time
[57:28] frame attached to you as being the
[57:31] thought of God you follow me God thought
[57:33] of the Earth the same way and we know of
[57:36] course that the Angels actually fell
[57:38] from heaven before the Earth was ever
[57:40] brought into existence so they fell
[57:42] before the foundation of the Earth and
[57:43] the Earth is one of God's attributes so
[57:46] how is God then going to get us back to
[57:48] that place to where we wouldn't just be
[57:51] thoughts but we would actually be manif
[57:54] ested thoughts expressed in a human form
[57:58] now you know the Plan of Redemption is
[58:00] so wonderful and yet there's Parts about
[58:02] it that is so mysterious turn with me if
[58:04] you to Revelation
[58:07] 5:1 I saw in the right hand of him that
[58:09] sat on the throne a book written within
[58:13] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[58:16] Seals now here John is carried up into a
[58:19] vision now remember things in a vision
[58:22] aren't always as they appear now watch
[58:25] what this is going to happen and how
[58:28] when we just jump down to verse let's
[58:30] let's look at verse six and I beheld and
[58:33] lo in the midst of the throne and of the
[58:36] four beasts and in the midst of the
[58:38] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[58:41] now John is carried up into a dimension
[58:44] and the prophets of course would see
[58:46] their Visions in the fourth dimension
[58:48] light matter time signs where the
[58:50] unbeliever goes where the believer goes
[58:52] and where God Is So in that Realm of the
[58:54] four fourth dimension that's the realm
[58:56] of Television Through The Ether Wes so
[58:58] in that realm a prophet could break into
[59:01] there and he would see something it
[59:03] might be a symbol it might he might see
[59:05] a sheep and it might be represent wool
[59:08] it might represent a lamb so he actually
[59:10] needed an interpretation of that Vision
[59:13] so I want you to notice now John sees
[59:16] and he said behold and I lo in the midst
[59:18] of the throne and of the four beasts so
[59:22] here was a throne setting and there was
[59:24] four beasts and in the midst of the
[59:27] elders so this is going to identify a
[59:31] certain time frame of when this is going
[59:34] to take place so there's four beasts
[59:37] four creatures and there was also Elders
[59:42] midst of the elders and there stood a
[59:45] lamb as it had been slain so now this is
[59:49] not before the pre this is this is not
[59:52] the pre-incarnate status of the Lord
[59:54] Loos this is not what was Before the
[59:58] Throne of God before Humanity notice
[1:00:01] when John breaks into this he says there
[1:00:04] stood a lamb as it had been slain so
[1:00:08] here John picks up in this stage of the
[1:00:11] vision but this Vision according to the
[1:00:14] time slaught would actually have been
[1:00:17] after the crucifixion and the
[1:00:20] resurrection of Our Lord so here it was
[1:00:23] that this lamb as it had been slain now
[1:00:27] notice the time frame having seven horns
[1:00:30] and seven eyes well what is that that's
[1:00:32] the church ages of course so when John
[1:00:35] looks and sees um this this is very
[1:00:39] important of course in the book of
[1:00:40] redemption because God wanted to make
[1:00:42] known what our inheritance was I realize
[1:00:44] there's an element of people that say
[1:00:46] they follow the message and they say
[1:00:47] they believe the message yet they see no
[1:00:49] importance of preaching from the opening
[1:00:51] book they see no importance at all and
[1:00:54] and setting on the seals they say no
[1:00:56] value whatsoever of bringing it from
[1:00:58] that way I'd like to know how in the
[1:00:59] world you think you're ever going to
[1:01:01] produce a rapturing faith preaching the
[1:01:03] same Bible stories that's been preached
[1:01:05] for 2,000 years and trying to bring a
[1:01:07] rapturing faith it never it didn't
[1:01:09] Rapture him 2,000 years ago it ain't
[1:01:11] going to Rapture you tonight it's going
[1:01:13] to have to be preached oh yes we'll
[1:01:15] still preach the same Bible stories but
[1:01:17] we will preach some Bible stories
[1:01:19] through an open book in order to bring
[1:01:22] the true reality of where we are in this
[1:01:24] in
[1:01:25] time now I I remember preaching some
[1:01:27] along this line a couple years ago and I
[1:01:29] remember a preacher that really got
[1:01:31] upset at me he was actually sitting in
[1:01:32] our church whenever I dealt with it and
[1:01:34] I saw that look come across his face and
[1:01:36] I knew right then he didn't like the
[1:01:38] direction I was going but it wasn't what
[1:01:40] I was saying was wrong it was just his
[1:01:43] understanding was so shallow he didn't
[1:01:45] even know where I was coming from so he
[1:01:47] took it all to one side and made a mess
[1:01:48] out of of course but I want you to
[1:01:50] notice how that when John sees this and
[1:01:52] he sees this land and as it had been
[1:01:55] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:01:58] and remember the seven horns are the
[1:02:00] power of the Lamb revealed in the seven
[1:02:03] Church ages so this is not John is not
[1:02:06] seeing the vision of this before the
[1:02:08] foundation of the world but it's in the
[1:02:11] time frame it's during the dispensation
[1:02:14] of the church ages seven horns seven
[1:02:17] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[1:02:19] sent forth into all the Earth and he
[1:02:21] came and took the book out of the right
[1:02:25] hand of him that's set upon the throne
[1:02:28] they say brother Donnie what in the
[1:02:29] world has this got to do with us finding
[1:02:31] our position because these are the only
[1:02:34] people right here that will ever find it
[1:02:38] the others will go from church to church
[1:02:40] they'll go from Doctrine to Doctrine and
[1:02:43] they'll they'll be drunk on the wine of
[1:02:45] the they will be drunk on the
[1:02:49] tribulation pre-tribulation anointing
[1:02:52] they will have no understanding no need
[1:02:54] the necessity of it will never Strike
[1:02:56] their soul to be ready for the ultimate
[1:02:59] which is the body change they will go
[1:03:01] right on thinking everything's fine I go
[1:03:03] to church I belong to church my name is
[1:03:05] on the book which means the more to God
[1:03:07] than nothing but yet those who really
[1:03:10] once they that God calls their name from
[1:03:13] that book and they catch the identity
[1:03:16] and they heard their name call and they
[1:03:19] heard from their theophany which by the
[1:03:22] way you can't hear from your theophany
[1:03:25] if you don't have one and those who have
[1:03:28] one is that theophany is the word made
[1:03:31] manifest and that lines up appropriately
[1:03:35] with the horn and the eye in the age
[1:03:38] that you live in so notice now whenever
[1:03:41] John sees this and he's breaking into
[1:03:43] this vision and verse 7 he said he came
[1:03:47] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:03:49] of him that set upon the throne now
[1:03:51] remember God is not a man God Is Not a
[1:03:55] Human Being God is a spirit but this is
[1:03:59] a vision so things can appear in A
[1:04:03] Vision in a vision form which does not
[1:04:07] mean they're in a reality
[1:04:09] form I'm sorry you didn't know brother R
[1:04:11] said that but remember when the seals
[1:04:14] come open when John writes about them
[1:04:16] here in Revelation they was opened up in
[1:04:19] a vision form but the prophet said how
[1:04:22] much more would it be in the seals in
[1:04:25] the reality form so there is a vision
[1:04:28] form and a reality form and John is
[1:04:31] seeing this in a vision so it was not
[1:04:34] like God was an old man sitting on the
[1:04:36] throne and there was Jesus his little
[1:04:38] boy and this little boy come up and took
[1:04:41] the book out of his Daddy's Hand it's a
[1:04:44] vision it's a vision and he came and
[1:04:47] took the book out of the right hand hand
[1:04:50] of him that sat upon the throne and when
[1:04:53] he had taken the book the four beasts
[1:04:55] and the four and 20 Elders now remember
[1:04:58] four and 20 Elders 12 from the Old
[1:05:01] Testament 12 from the new so what are we
[1:05:03] talking about after the
[1:05:07] crucifixion I want you to listen
[1:05:09] carefully now the Lord
[1:05:12] Jesus could not do
[1:05:15] this at the
[1:05:19] cross this could not be
[1:05:23] fulfilled at the
[1:05:26] cross now listen to me carefully the
[1:05:30] blood the deaths the burial the
[1:05:33] resurrection there had never been
[1:05:35] anything like it and there still hasn't
[1:05:38] been but this book was not opened after
[1:05:42] the blood was shed after he died and was
[1:05:46] buried even after he raised
[1:05:50] again now remember Redemption has
[1:05:53] multiple
[1:05:54] stages absolutely the blood was
[1:05:58] essential but the blood alone did not
[1:06:02] loose the Seven
[1:06:04] Seals the resurrection there had never
[1:06:07] been anything like it before but his
[1:06:10] resurrection did not loose the Seven
[1:06:15] Seals look friends what a day we live in
[1:06:18] what a privileged people we are to live
[1:06:20] under the administration of an open book
[1:06:23] at the end
[1:06:25] time I think of it even after his
[1:06:28] death's burial and
[1:06:31] Resurrection the book still had not been
[1:06:37] opened oh
[1:06:40] my notice what happens here and when he
[1:06:44] had taken the book The Four beasts and
[1:06:46] the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the
[1:06:48] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[1:06:51] golden vials full of odor which are the
[1:06:55] prayers of the Saints now look how your
[1:06:58] prayers are actually stored up in vials
[1:07:02] in
[1:07:03] heaven and whenever this come open
[1:07:06] notice when the lamb takes the book and
[1:07:09] then there there's this reaction in
[1:07:12] heaven that the Beast fall down before
[1:07:15] him and the 4 and2 Elders fall down
[1:07:16] before him and whenever they do they
[1:07:19] bring these vials full of the prayers of
[1:07:22] the Saints oh my thank you Lord and
[1:07:26] these prayers were like odors like the
[1:07:29] incense in the Old Testament and they
[1:07:32] had been stored up these prayers and
[1:07:35] whenever the lamb takes the book it
[1:07:38] releases the prayers of God's people
[1:07:43] what are they praying for Redemption
[1:07:46] Resurrection Rapture body chains last
[1:07:49] member to come in so they can leave
[1:07:52] Hallelujah
[1:07:55] thank you Lord God and they sung a new
[1:07:59] song saying thou AR worthy to take the
[1:08:01] book and to open the seals there were
[1:08:03] for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us
[1:08:06] to God by thy blood now who is this
[1:08:08] that's singing this song this is the
[1:08:10] redeemed that have experienced this name
[1:08:14] calling out of the open book and it's
[1:08:17] redeemed us to god notice by thy blood
[1:08:21] how were they redeemed and now notice
[1:08:23] the curious mystery of redemption is
[1:08:26] being worked out right now by this
[1:08:28] mysterious creature that John looked at
[1:08:31] and saw by Vision it's still being
[1:08:34] worked out tonight there might be 500
[1:08:36] left there might be a thousand there
[1:08:38] might be a 100,00 who knows but whenever
[1:08:41] the last name is called and finished and
[1:08:44] the Mystery the of redemption is done
[1:08:47] then the lamb will take for the human
[1:08:52] counterpart of the book
[1:08:55] book you understand that he took the
[1:08:58] book out of the
[1:09:01] eternities and broke the
[1:09:03] seals but there is a human counterpart
[1:09:07] of that
[1:09:09] book on the
[1:09:12] earth glory to God thou wer worthy to
[1:09:17] take the book and to open the seals
[1:09:19] thereof for that was slain so what are
[1:09:21] they doing they're giving
[1:09:22] acknowledgement and
[1:09:24] recognition that this has been after he
[1:09:27] was slain so when did he take this
[1:09:33] book I want you to notice what they keep
[1:09:37] saying about him what attribute title
[1:09:41] they keep using
[1:09:43] lamb
[1:09:45] lamb
[1:09:46] lamb don't you understand why this could
[1:09:50] not happen on the cross
[1:09:54] because a
[1:09:57] goat cannot
[1:09:59] take that
[1:10:07] book
[1:10:09] Hallelujah he went
[1:10:12] there as a
[1:10:15] lamb but he
[1:10:17] died as a
[1:10:22] goat a goat
[1:10:24] could not take the
[1:10:28] book look at the lamb goat imagery in
[1:10:33] our lord
[1:10:34] Jesus why would he take that imagery
[1:10:38] upon
[1:10:40] himself because his
[1:10:43] wife bore that same
[1:10:47] imagery he was a lamb first and become a
[1:10:51] goat you were a goat nature
[1:10:54] and become
[1:10:56] alive Hallelujah don't you see what he
[1:10:59] does John said behold not the goat of
[1:11:02] God the Lamb of
[1:11:09] God now notice what these people are
[1:11:12] saying friends don't you understand this
[1:11:14] is us by theophonic representation of
[1:11:17] the presence of God and has made us unto
[1:11:20] our God Kings and Priests and we shall
[1:11:24] reign on the
[1:11:27] Earth but how is this made possible for
[1:11:30] us to be in the family of
[1:11:35] God he must take our
[1:11:39] sin people have no problem with Jesus
[1:11:43] becoming a lamb but I'll tell you what
[1:11:44] will make them sick to their stomach
[1:11:47] even some of the message folks when you
[1:11:49] preach the real truths he wasn't just a
[1:11:52] lamb
[1:11:54] he become a
[1:11:58] goat that's all right you can hold your
[1:12:00] amen so I read you the quotes and then
[1:12:01] you can say Amen
[1:12:05] then a lamb took the
[1:12:08] book not a
[1:12:10] goat hanging on that
[1:12:14] cross he
[1:12:16] became a
[1:12:22] goat
[1:12:24] and never did anything
[1:12:27] wrong don't you remember Leviticus 16
[1:12:31] don't you remember in the several
[1:12:32] different places when God gave
[1:12:35] them the sacrifices and the Order of the
[1:12:39] sacrifice one would require a bulock
[1:12:42] another would require a
[1:12:45] lamb but on certain days and in certain
[1:12:49] occasions there must be a coat
[1:12:55] on the day of atonement there was two
[1:13:00] goats they would cast lots the priest
[1:13:04] would they would cast lots upon the
[1:13:08] goats one goat was
[1:13:11] killed and the other one the sins of the
[1:13:14] people were
[1:13:15] transferred the priest would lay his
[1:13:18] hands on the head of the goat and trans
[1:13:23] their
[1:13:25] sins now you imagine you've been
[1:13:27] standing there that day and you never
[1:13:29] saw no sin go on the head of that goat
[1:13:31] but you had to believe that somehow that
[1:13:35] priest could transfer not only your sins
[1:13:38] the sins of the entire
[1:13:41] nation were transferred on the head of
[1:13:44] that goat one goat was killed and the
[1:13:47] other one was took by a clean man which
[1:13:51] had washed his garments and met certain
[1:13:53] Str anent requirements given by
[1:13:56] God and the man would go out into the
[1:13:59] Wilderness he didn't kill the goat but
[1:14:03] he turned the goat
[1:14:05] loose and the Goat would wander out
[1:14:08] beyond the camp of the people of
[1:14:12] God until those
[1:14:15] sins would actually
[1:14:18] kill that
[1:14:20] goat some of them would live for days
[1:14:22] some of them live for weeks but
[1:14:25] eventually you're talking about a
[1:14:27] strange bizarre thing you've got this
[1:14:30] goat out there roaming around in the
[1:14:32] wilderness there was nothing physically
[1:14:34] wrong with him there was no heart issues
[1:14:37] no liver issues the whole issue was
[1:14:42] sin and the sins of all of these
[1:14:45] thousands and hundreds of thousands and
[1:14:47] millions of people was on this goat and
[1:14:49] he was wandering around and wandering
[1:14:52] around and many of the theologians down
[1:14:54] through the church
[1:14:56] ages many of them said that goat in the
[1:14:59] wilderness was the
[1:15:02] devil God sent us a prophet in the end
[1:15:04] time to straighten out that false
[1:15:06] teaching and let us know both of those
[1:15:10] goats were our Lord Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ
[1:15:15] hallelujah hallelujah so he must
[1:15:19] die and then he must go into the
[1:15:23] Wilderness called
[1:15:29] Hades I know friends this Nery chokes us
[1:15:32] to
[1:15:33] death when he gave his life on the cross
[1:15:38] he died the death of a
[1:15:46] sinner and he had never done one thing
[1:15:50] wrong notice the prophet here says
[1:15:53] living dying buried Rising coming and
[1:15:55] the scriptures in the Old Testament at
[1:15:56] the sin offering when they got two goats
[1:15:59] and these goats Jesus represented both
[1:16:02] of them and they represented him rather
[1:16:04] and one goat was killed and the other
[1:16:06] the sins of the nation was placed upon
[1:16:08] this goat
[1:16:10] called not the scape
[1:16:13] lamb the scape
[1:16:16] goat and the Goat had to go out into the
[1:16:19] Wilderness to die to be out there alone
[1:16:23] amongst the
[1:16:24] Beast
[1:16:26] Jesus had to be that
[1:16:30] goat I want you to notice he was a lamb
[1:16:34] he was a
[1:16:36] sheep but he was made
[1:16:40] goat for you and
[1:16:47] I dear
[1:16:51] God that would we being
[1:16:56] goat might
[1:16:58] become
[1:17:01] sheep so if we were goat a fallen
[1:17:06] nature he could not have fully redeemed
[1:17:09] us if he would have just come down to
[1:17:11] the level of
[1:17:13] lamb oh and Moses beat that brass years
[1:17:18] and years and years before this and hung
[1:17:20] it up on a pole what a stumbling block
[1:17:23] it must have been to some of the people
[1:17:25] of Israel that day when God said Thou
[1:17:27] shalt make no graven image and yet that
[1:17:29] Prophet stood there and took a hammer
[1:17:31] and beat that brass and beat it into a
[1:17:33] serpent why a
[1:17:35] serpent why a serpent don't you
[1:17:38] understand the Lord Jesus became that
[1:17:41] serpent on the
[1:17:44] pole on
[1:17:51] goasa Brother Don I can't stand it when
[1:17:53] you make him that low you know why
[1:17:55] tradition won't let you go that low if
[1:17:58] the devil can keep that head from you
[1:18:00] you'll never have the full understanding
[1:18:02] of the Redemption that he's paid for
[1:18:05] you I didn't bring him this place he
[1:18:09] brought
[1:18:10] himself I didn't bring him here you
[1:18:12] didn't bring him here the prophet of God
[1:18:14] never brought him there he brought
[1:18:16] himself brother Joe to that
[1:18:21] place
[1:18:27] he was made goat for you and I that we
[1:18:31] being goat might become she sheep we
[1:18:34] being Sinners guilty of death subject to
[1:18:37] death and sold out under condemnation
[1:18:39] yet Christ become me that I through his
[1:18:43] grace might become him a Son of God
[1:18:48] seated at the right hand of God in glory
[1:18:53] Lord have
[1:18:56] mercy so he become me that I might
[1:18:59] become him he took my place as a goat
[1:19:03] that I might become a
[1:19:07] sheep he goes on and said that I said a
[1:19:09] few moments ago he become we were
[1:19:12] goats he become goat
[1:19:16] goat for us he becomes
[1:19:20] sin for us that's the reason had to be
[1:19:23] punished the way he was because all of
[1:19:27] our sins were placed upon him and there
[1:19:29] he had to Bear them away in his own body
[1:19:35] to
[1:19:36] Calvary and me know the anointing left
[1:19:39] him in the Garden of
[1:19:41] Gethsemane he walked into the Garden of
[1:19:44] Gethsemane Son of
[1:19:47] God with the Incarnate father in
[1:19:50] him he walked out of that that same
[1:19:54] garden and the anointing left
[1:19:57] him and there was a
[1:20:01] transfer a
[1:20:04] transfer you see it was in a garden
[1:20:08] meaning Millennia
[1:20:09] before that the first Son of God made
[1:20:12] his
[1:20:13] choice to Forfeit his right as a Son of
[1:20:17] God to redeem his
[1:20:20] wife now it's another Garden
[1:20:23] with The Real Son of God forsaking all
[1:20:27] the prophet tells us in 1962 in Phoenix
[1:20:30] he
[1:20:31] forsook his
[1:20:34] sunship don't you see reconciliation and
[1:20:37] Redemption what it is Adam forsook his
[1:20:39] in the Garden of Eden the Lord Jesus
[1:20:42] forsook his In The Garden of
[1:20:45] Gethsemane what was it for both of them
[1:20:48] the love of a
[1:20:51] woman i' like to pre preach that to you
[1:20:53] sometime for the love of a
[1:20:57] woman Hallelujah the Lord Jesus forsook
[1:21:01] his
[1:21:02] sunship he walked in there the fullness
[1:21:05] of the godhead bodily oh he walked in
[1:21:08] there the manifestation the attributes
[1:21:10] of God the alpha all the great things
[1:21:12] that he was and he walked
[1:21:14] out a
[1:21:18] goat with your lying your drinking your
[1:21:21] adultery your smoking my
[1:21:23] our
[1:21:28] Abominations walked into the howling
[1:21:31] Wilderness of humanity burying our
[1:21:35] sins and as great as that
[1:21:38] was he could not take the
[1:21:41] book because John did not see a
[1:21:46] goat walk Before the Throne of God and
[1:21:50] say give me that book
[1:21:55] he was
[1:21:57] cursed in the eyes of
[1:22:01] God cursed is everyone that
[1:22:04] hangeth on a
[1:22:07] tree how many's ever done something
[1:22:10] wrong and you feel so bad so filthy so
[1:22:13] awful and you do that with one sin on
[1:22:18] you it's hard for our minds to imagine
[1:22:21] isn't it the sins of the entire world
[1:22:25] every murder every
[1:22:27] abortion Every curse word everything
[1:22:30] that was ever
[1:22:32] been brother Rob I don't see how he made
[1:22:34] it I don't see how he walked out of
[1:22:37] there he must have been
[1:22:39] so bore oh just bearing our our sins and
[1:22:43] our our our sorrows and just so weighted
[1:22:45] down and felt so guilty and felt so
[1:22:50] dirty and felt so
[1:22:54] filthy remember on the cross he didn't
[1:22:56] say my father my
[1:22:59] father why is th forsaken
[1:23:02] me but my
[1:23:05] God my
[1:23:08] God why he forfeited
[1:23:12] sunship in the
[1:23:15] garden so I could stand before you
[1:23:18] tonight as a Son of God so you could sit
[1:23:22] here say Amen to the word as Sons and
[1:23:25] Daughters of
[1:23:38] God we were goats he become goat for us
[1:23:42] he become sin for us that's the reason
[1:23:44] he had to be punished the way that he
[1:23:47] was because all of our sins were placed
[1:23:50] upon him and there had to he had to Bear
[1:23:53] them away in his own body to Calvary a
[1:23:56] reproach a
[1:23:59] disgrace sinfully hanging
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:04] there the Lord Jesus become a
[1:24:09] reproach he was a
[1:24:17] disgrace
[1:24:19] sinfully
[1:24:21] sinfully hanging there
[1:24:25] naked stripped
[1:24:29] bleeding and listen this last word
[1:24:34] bleeding
[1:24:36] bleeding my God my
[1:24:40] God why Thou forsaken
[1:24:44] me he did not die the death of a
[1:24:48] righteous
[1:24:51] man
[1:24:54] he died the death of a
[1:24:56] sinner so for those of us who have to
[1:24:59] face death we can face it as a son or
[1:25:03] daughter of
[1:25:05] God and say death you ain't got no hold
[1:25:08] on
[1:25:10] me why because he
[1:25:15] become a
[1:25:18] God no wonder heaven was an
[1:25:23] explosion in Revival when he took that
[1:25:27] book CA from Heaven's point of view this
[1:25:32] was such a tremendous act the most
[1:25:36] Sublime thing in
[1:25:38] scripture because from their view they
[1:25:41] see what he
[1:25:43] did we have it watered down through
[1:25:45] denominational this and that and the
[1:25:47] other come on somebody I think we really
[1:25:50] need to look at it tonight in full full
[1:25:52] scope of what it was he was God and
[1:25:55] become man that was a great condensation
[1:25:58] but he had to go further he had to go
[1:26:01] from being man to become a
[1:26:04] sinner he was a logos and he became a
[1:26:07] human being he was the Lamb of God as
[1:26:10] John so identified him Behold the Lamb
[1:26:13] of God which taketh away the sins of the
[1:26:17] world but he could not Remain the lamb
[1:26:21] identity
[1:26:23] he had to take on that
[1:26:26] identity of a
[1:26:33] goat now remember this book that John
[1:26:37] saw whatever was in this book was so
[1:26:42] important that it went from the hands of
[1:26:45] Adam in the Garden of
[1:26:48] Eden back to the original owner
[1:26:52] it could not be stored in the courthouse
[1:26:55] of
[1:26:57] Heaven it could not be stored in the
[1:27:01] library you know God has a
[1:27:04] library K's
[1:27:07] names there's also books in there in his
[1:27:11] Library called The Book of
[1:27:14] remembrance but this book couldn't go
[1:27:17] there this book was so important it had
[1:27:21] to go back into the hands of him who sat
[1:27:25] on the
[1:27:29] throne now watch in Revelation
[1:27:33] 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:27:36] down from heaven clothed with the cloud
[1:27:39] and a rainbow was upon his
[1:27:41] head and his face were as it were the
[1:27:44] Sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:27:48] fire and he had in his
[1:27:51] hand a little
[1:27:54] book would you notice now the size of
[1:27:56] this book it was a little
[1:28:00] book
[1:28:02] open so the size is
[1:28:07] determining what he's
[1:28:09] Gathering so it's not all the names of
[1:28:12] the billions of people that have lived
[1:28:14] on the face of the Earth and he's coming
[1:28:16] to call their names cuz no doubt it
[1:28:18] would be big
[1:28:20] books but this book
[1:28:23] specified a particular
[1:28:27] need a particular
[1:28:29] purpose now this is the same
[1:28:33] one that we saw in Revelation
[1:28:36] 5 but now he's changed his
[1:28:41] appearance he's appearing in a form
[1:28:44] which
[1:28:45] matches Revelation
[1:28:48] 101 now his garments remember it wasn't
[1:28:52] an actor so he's changing his
[1:28:54] garments the garments that he wore in
[1:28:57] Revelation
[1:28:59] 5 would not be
[1:29:01] fitting for Revelation
[1:29:05] 10 so he changed his garments according
[1:29:09] to the scene and what the ACT is calling
[1:29:13] for I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:29:16] from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:29:18] Revelation 5 doesn't mention nothing
[1:29:20] about that and a rang bow was upon his
[1:29:23] head Revelation 5 doesn't mention that
[1:29:25] and his face were as the sun and his
[1:29:28] feet as pillars of fire and he had in
[1:29:32] his hand a little book now
[1:29:35] notice John specifically
[1:29:38] notices the status of this book he
[1:29:42] noticed that it was small and he noticed
[1:29:46] that it was
[1:29:48] open so something had happened in
[1:29:51] between Revelation 5 and Revelation 10
[1:29:55] what was that Revelation
[1:29:57] 6 so when the lamb opened the seals when
[1:30:01] he started opening them the mystery of
[1:30:04] what was on the inside the letters
[1:30:07] written inside of there the mystery was
[1:30:10] made known so when he appears in
[1:30:13] Revelation 10 he notices that the book
[1:30:17] is open which means the Seven Seals had
[1:30:21] been tore off the
[1:30:25] backside so remember it was in the form
[1:30:28] of a scroll like this when the prophet
[1:30:30] preached it he said if it was one of our
[1:30:32] modernday books it would be like straps
[1:30:35] around it so there'd be seven straps
[1:30:38] around it but and then of course they
[1:30:40] would have a scroll and they would roll
[1:30:42] it up and then they'd put something
[1:30:44] around it and they would put a seal the
[1:30:46] king's seal or a magistrate seal or you
[1:30:48] know somebody in the court whatever it
[1:30:50] was they take hot wax and they'd pour
[1:30:52] onside that scroll paper and they'd roll
[1:30:54] it together and they'd pour the hot wax
[1:30:56] and then they'd take their seal which
[1:30:58] would either be on a an amulet type of
[1:31:00] thing wore around their neck like a
[1:31:02] necklace or it would be on a on a on a
[1:31:04] ring so they would take that and they'd
[1:31:06] heat it up and they'd put that seal
[1:31:08] inside of there then that was to
[1:31:11] delivered to whoever it was delivered to
[1:31:13] and that seal better not be broken it
[1:31:16] had to remain sealed so whenever the man
[1:31:19] received it then he would take it and he
[1:31:21] would pop that seal what was it breaking
[1:31:25] the wax so he would break that seal and
[1:31:29] then he would unroll the document and he
[1:31:32] would start reading the contents because
[1:31:35] it was sent for the eyes of a certain
[1:31:38] individual now the man carrying it or
[1:31:40] the whole train or whatever it was it
[1:31:43] was not intended for them they were just
[1:31:45] Messengers but it was intended for the
[1:31:47] one that was sent to can't you see why
[1:31:49] in each Church age that he said unto the
[1:31:51] Angel of the Church of Ephesus right
[1:31:54] unto the angel of the Church of so on
[1:31:56] and so on right so God gives to them the
[1:31:59] mystery of the revelation of their age
[1:32:02] by the spirit of God the Holy Ghost
[1:32:04] breaks that seal opens the mystery and
[1:32:07] makes it known this is why the prophet
[1:32:09] said one of those Angels Came each day
[1:32:12] can you imagine what a phenomenal thing
[1:32:13] was happening in 1963 when each one of
[1:32:16] those angels one of them came each day
[1:32:19] and made known the mystery to the
[1:32:22] seventh angel on the earth the mystery
[1:32:25] which was made known only to them so
[1:32:27] nobody else in the church age knew the
[1:32:29] fullness of it and God had to send those
[1:32:32] seven theophonic
[1:32:34] beings in those you imagine the angels
[1:32:36] of God hovered around that Tabernacle in
[1:32:39] in March of 1963 can you imagine the
[1:32:42] angels of God hearing things that had
[1:32:45] not been uttered many of those things
[1:32:47] since the foundation of the world and
[1:32:49] don't you know demons was in there too
[1:32:51] and why some of these people in the
[1:32:52] message don't want to preach this
[1:32:54] message it's more than I can comprehend
[1:32:56] this was so important to God that Angels
[1:32:59] were gathered around that place Angelic
[1:33:02] visitation like had never been on the
[1:33:09] earth he had in his hand a little book
[1:33:12] open and he set his right foot upon the
[1:33:15] sea and his left
[1:33:18] foot upon the
[1:33:20] Earth
[1:33:22] verse eight now you know verse three
[1:33:24] there already cried with a loud voice
[1:33:26] let's jump down here to eight verse
[1:33:30] eight now the Declaration is made that
[1:33:33] time shall be no
[1:33:36] more but I want you to notice in this
[1:33:38] 10th chapter something happens
[1:33:42] now to a goat which was a goat but had
[1:33:46] now become a
[1:33:47] lamb because the man who took the book
[1:33:50] which was a lamb become a a goat and
[1:33:53] turn back into the lamb
[1:33:56] stage Oh Glory to God don't you
[1:33:59] understand what Jesus was the goat was
[1:34:01] part of the
[1:34:04] ACT he wasn't goat first he become
[1:34:08] goat you were only goat because you was
[1:34:11] in a fallen nature but you were sheep
[1:34:13] before the foundation of the
[1:34:18] world and the voice which I heard from
[1:34:20] Heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:34:24] go and
[1:34:26] take the little book which is
[1:34:29] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:34:32] standeth upon the
[1:34:34] sea and upon the Earth this is the same
[1:34:38] book that the heavens had been searched
[1:34:40] the Earth had been searched and no one
[1:34:42] was found
[1:34:44] worthy Jesus was the missing
[1:34:47] link as the serpent is the missing link
[1:34:50] between the Animal Kingdom and the human
[1:34:53] Kingdom Jesus was the missing link
[1:34:57] between the Divine Kingdom and
[1:35:00] Humanity don't you see Satan only copied
[1:35:02] what God did there was a missing link
[1:35:04] there where did he get that imagery from
[1:35:06] somehow he was able to see it from the
[1:35:08] foundation of the world back there when
[1:35:10] God created him when Michael was no
[1:35:12] doubt there and he was able to pick it
[1:35:14] up somehow and he thought this is what
[1:35:16] I've got to do I've got to have a link
[1:35:18] God's got one I need
[1:35:20] one
[1:35:22] here was the
[1:35:23] Leake and the
[1:35:25] Leake took the
[1:35:28] book and tore the seals off and opened
[1:35:31] it but don't you see he didn't open it
[1:35:34] for himself right he opened it for
[1:35:42] you don't you understand there would
[1:35:44] have never been a general
[1:35:47] Resurrection there would have never been
[1:35:49] a general Resurrection a Rapture could
[1:35:52] have never
[1:35:53] been if the book had not been revealed
[1:35:57] that's right in Revelation
[1:36:00] 10 they had his
[1:36:03] blood they had proof of his resurrection
[1:36:05] there was men still alive that saw him
[1:36:08] dead and saw him alive
[1:36:14] again they had the blood which had
[1:36:16] purged them thank God for the blood
[1:36:18] don't we thank God for the blood we
[1:36:20] needed every day of Our Lives but don't
[1:36:23] you understand the opening of the book
[1:36:26] it's a part of the Plan of Redemption
[1:36:28] just like the blood just like the cross
[1:36:30] just like the resurrection so why leave
[1:36:33] that part
[1:36:36] out this has to do with our
[1:36:39] inheritance after we're washed in the
[1:36:42] blood this has to do with us seeing who
[1:36:46] we
[1:36:47] are oh if the church could recognize who
[1:36:50] she is he says and one day she will and
[1:36:54] the Rapture will go not
[1:37:00] come he didn't say the Rapture will come
[1:37:03] but the Rapture will go am when she
[1:37:06] recognizes who she is and it's amazing
[1:37:08] because he didn't say when she
[1:37:10] recognizes who I am well I hope we have
[1:37:14] I hope we've recognized Malachi for of
[1:37:16] him but that would in itself has not
[1:37:17] produced The Rapture yet don't you
[1:37:20] understand it's not enough for us to
[1:37:22] recognize Malachi 4 we've got to see who
[1:37:25] we are we've got to see who we are in
[1:37:28] the body well I'm a singer I'm a
[1:37:31] songwriter I'm this that the other
[1:37:32] that's good but who are you and what are
[1:37:36] you I'm not talking about just your
[1:37:38] natural call in line one day my
[1:37:40] preaching will cease one day there'll be
[1:37:42] no more preaching in heaven but what
[1:37:44] will I be when I get to heaven and
[1:37:47] express Son of God that was there in his
[1:37:49] thinking before the found of the world
[1:37:52] and brought back in a human body and
[1:37:54] when it's all said and done there will
[1:37:56] be those thoughts in his mind manifested
[1:37:58] in flesh eternal life in human bodies
[1:38:03] can you imagine Eternal eyeballs can you
[1:38:06] imagine Eternal eyelashes Eternal
[1:38:08] fingers Eternal toes eternal glory to
[1:38:12] God hallelujah what a day of wa just
[1:38:15] children of God but we must take the BK
[1:38:19] we've got to eat it
[1:38:29] now I want you to notice what happens to
[1:38:32] John in verse n and I
[1:38:38] went I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:38:43] him give
[1:38:46] me the little
[1:38:49] book what in the world happened to this
[1:38:51] man from Revelation 5 whenever John
[1:38:54] heard everything in heaven everything
[1:38:55] else weeping and crying and no man was
[1:38:57] found worthy and John looks and say My
[1:38:59] my what in the world's going to happen
[1:39:01] but something happened to him oh
[1:39:05] children this is what I want to happen
[1:39:08] to
[1:39:10] us then we can look and realize Papa
[1:39:15] give me the
[1:39:17] buck give me my P
[1:39:22] of who I
[1:39:27] am then surely we will be able to say
[1:39:30] not just
[1:39:31] quote I and my
[1:39:35] father are
[1:39:43] one and I went into the angel and said
[1:39:45] unto him give
[1:39:47] me the little book John are you out of
[1:39:50] your mind
[1:39:53] an angel couldn't even have this it
[1:39:55] couldn't John could not walk up and take
[1:39:59] that book in Revelation
[1:40:01] 5 but the
[1:40:03] mediator humanized the
[1:40:07] reception of the
[1:40:09] book The ability to receive the book for
[1:40:13] any human being was when God changed his
[1:40:17] currency from Divine to Human
[1:40:21] so it was not a theophonic hand that
[1:40:24] reached forth and took it out of the
[1:40:26] hand of him that sat on the throne in
[1:40:28] Revelation 5 it was not an
[1:40:31] angel it was God's Own
[1:40:37] Humanity so here was the
[1:40:40] breach the
[1:40:42] breach that reached up and took the book
[1:40:45] when he took
[1:40:47] it it ain't no wonder the rest of them
[1:40:49] was shouting and jumping and and they
[1:40:51] said glory to God I get my portion I get
[1:40:55] my chance to take it to here was the
[1:40:59] missing link between the book and the
[1:41:09] pride and I went unto the angel and said
[1:41:12] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:41:13] said unto me take
[1:41:16] it take
[1:41:18] it and eat it up
[1:41:22] and it shall make thy belly
[1:41:25] bitter but in thy mouth sweet as
[1:41:29] honey and I took the little book out of
[1:41:32] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:41:35] was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon
[1:41:38] as I had eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:41:41] notice the prophet said he had a little
[1:41:43] book that John had to eat and when he
[1:41:45] did he got it into his belly and it was
[1:41:47] bitter but in his lips it was sweet when
[1:41:49] you have to digest it then it gets
[1:41:52] bitter everybody against you everybody
[1:41:55] telling you you're a holy rer you're
[1:41:57] this or that or the other you're off in
[1:41:59] your head it's hard to digest it but
[1:42:03] when you're testifying of his glory it's
[1:42:06] sweeten your lips how many's been there
[1:42:08] and done there it's sweeten your lips
[1:42:10] that's all but when you stand up in a
[1:42:12] meeting you say glory to God oh when
[1:42:14] you're going down through that great
[1:42:15] Siege it's hard but then when you're out
[1:42:17] there in that great Siege you can
[1:42:19] testify of it then it's sweet in the
[1:42:22] lips that's this
[1:42:24] book of
[1:42:27] redemption do you understand what it
[1:42:29] comes into you but divine
[1:42:31] revelation and you eat of this word of
[1:42:35] God don't you understand it's going to
[1:42:37] be sweet and bitter mixed together amen
[1:42:41] but you're testifying of what John
[1:42:43] testified it shows that the lamb has
[1:42:46] given you your portion of the book
[1:42:55] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:42:57] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:43:00] and tongues and
[1:43:03] Kings so you see we too needed the book
[1:43:07] to become
[1:43:08] open to us in this
[1:43:11] day why brother Donnie so we would know
[1:43:15] the
[1:43:19] contents my goodness we spent years and
[1:43:21] years and years certain the goodness
[1:43:24] we're further up the road than when we
[1:43:25] friends come to the message aren't we
[1:43:27] aren't we what do we want to do we don't
[1:43:30] want to make great men you know Idols
[1:43:32] out of them and that well we want to eat
[1:43:34] the
[1:43:35] B so you can come to your place I can
[1:43:39] come to mine we can find who we are in
[1:43:42] Christ
[1:43:44] Jesus so we can call for the
[1:43:48] resurrection I know I know it's just
[1:43:50] going to choke some some of you that
[1:43:51] prophet of God said one day you will
[1:43:54] speak your own body you will call your
[1:43:57] own
[1:43:58] body if you've died and entered into the
[1:44:01] into that sixth Dimension you will call
[1:44:03] for your own
[1:44:09] body now we see in this seven seal book
[1:44:12] it is the mystery of redemption it's a
[1:44:14] book of redemption from God now all the
[1:44:16] Mysteries at this time should be
[1:44:18] finished at the sounding of this
[1:44:21] messenger and here's the angel on Earth
[1:44:23] and another Angel Mighty messenger came
[1:44:26] down see the angel was an earthy Angel
[1:44:28] messenger But Here Comes one down from
[1:44:30] heaven a rainbow Covenant only
[1:44:34] Christ it could be just exactly like it
[1:44:38] was in Revelation the first
[1:44:40] chapter notice so that he takes on the
[1:44:43] imagery of Revelation 1 not Revelation
[1:44:47] 5 you see friends this is what cleanses
[1:44:51] us as we walk in the light as he is in
[1:44:57] the
[1:44:58] light as he is in the light and the
[1:45:01] light will change from one phase to
[1:45:03] another from one Brilliance to another
[1:45:05] from one Effy of Glory to another and we
[1:45:09] must find him and when we find him we'll
[1:45:12] be able to be identified with him and if
[1:45:15] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:45:17] light then we will have Fellowship one
[1:45:19] with another and no that ain't you and
[1:45:21] your wife and that ain't you and your
[1:45:22] brother John is relating fellowshipping
[1:45:25] between you and God we will have
[1:45:28] Fellowship one with another as we looked
[1:45:30] at it Sunday ohar we will have
[1:45:32] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:45:34] blood of his son Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:45:37] us from all sin don't you see why we
[1:45:39] must come to our spot that's what
[1:45:42] cleanses us Keeps Us ready for the
[1:45:44] Rapture I'm not talking about people
[1:45:47] supposing they're under the blood
[1:45:49] there'll be millions of them that think
[1:45:51] they're under the blood but all they've
[1:45:52] got is a chemistry in their mind they've
[1:45:55] got a paint in their mind but they've
[1:45:58] not found Jesus in the light of this day
[1:46:01] they're Found Jesus in the light of
[1:46:04] 2,000 years ago I've got to find him in
[1:46:07] the light of
[1:46:08] 2024 in order for my sins to be
[1:46:12] purged if not I will meet him as a
[1:46:16] filthy foolish
[1:46:19] virgin
[1:46:20] don't you understand why the bride must
[1:46:22] be harmonizing with the light of the day
[1:46:25] the releasing of your
[1:46:28] sins is identified under the
[1:46:31] administration of the son of
[1:46:37] man and the bridegroom's
[1:46:40] call will come right through this
[1:46:42] message I know it may seems staggering
[1:46:45] to some of you but there are men who say
[1:46:48] they believe this message
[1:46:50] that
[1:46:52] preach that people can be in a
[1:46:55] denomination and go in the Rapture even
[1:46:58] be in the Catholic church and go in the
[1:47:01] Rapture why do we need this message
[1:47:04] then why waste our time reading it why
[1:47:08] God's going to let everybody and their
[1:47:09] brother go in and dress like everything
[1:47:11] in the world and pray to St Cecilia and
[1:47:14] pray to marry what the Bible says there
[1:47:17] is one mediator between God and man that
[1:47:20] the man Christ
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:30] Jesus notice the Seven Seals he says has
[1:47:33] the book seal the book is absolutely
[1:47:36] sealed do you see it the book is
[1:47:37] absolutely a sealed book under the Seven
[1:47:39] Seals is broken it is sealed up as Seven
[1:47:41] Seals now that's different from the
[1:47:43] seven Thunders this is the Seven Seals
[1:47:45] on the book and the book The Seals will
[1:47:48] not be
[1:47:49] released until the
[1:47:51] message of the seventh
[1:47:54] angel Paul never mentioned Seven
[1:48:03] Seals why don't some try to look at me
[1:48:05] funny he
[1:48:08] never Paul never mention seven
[1:48:13] Thunders he preached the cross he
[1:48:15] preached the blood he preached
[1:48:17] Redemption through reconciliation God
[1:48:19] never show Paul there was no need for it
[1:48:23] he's Liv in the first church
[1:48:25] age so God did not allow the book to
[1:48:28] become open even after Jesus went to
[1:48:32] heaven in the first church
[1:48:35] age it was
[1:48:37] saved for your
[1:48:41] day I don't blame the devil if I was him
[1:48:43] I'd fight this message too I if I was a
[1:48:46] devil I'd hate this message I'd hate
[1:48:48] every message preacher this really
[1:48:50] preaching as that is I do everything in
[1:48:52] the world I could to stop them but guess
[1:48:55] what devil you ain't going to stop us
[1:48:57] because this didn't start with us it
[1:48:59] didn't start with me it didn't start
[1:49:01] with you it started with the Lord God
[1:49:03] before the foundation of the world let
[1:49:05] me just say there ain't enough demons
[1:49:07] out of hell to stop this message there
[1:49:10] ain't enough websites there ain't enough
[1:49:12] Liars there ain't enough people trying
[1:49:14] to accuse a prophet of God this message
[1:49:16] will be standing when the world is on
[1:49:19] fire
[1:49:21] Hallelujah I don't know about you
[1:49:23] tonight friend I thank God for the
[1:49:25] messenger of Malachi 4 I thank God for
[1:49:29] this end time message it's going to be
[1:49:31] the very thing that's going to change
[1:49:33] our
[1:49:41] bodies the seals will not be released
[1:49:43] into the message of the seventh angel
[1:49:45] let's
[1:49:47] stand so you see we're presuming but the
[1:49:49] genuine revelation of God will be made
[1:49:52] perfect and that sounding and Vindicated
[1:49:55] truth that's exactly what the word said
[1:49:57] the mystery should be finished at that
[1:49:59] time the seven sealed book remember it
[1:50:02] was closed in Revelation the 5th chapter
[1:50:06] and in Revelation the 10th
[1:50:07] chapter it was opened now we're going to
[1:50:10] see what the book says about how it
[1:50:15] become
[1:50:16] open and it's not made known until the
[1:50:19] lamb takes the book I remember not the
[1:50:22] goat do you understand he could not do
[1:50:24] this at the
[1:50:26] cross the actor's garment was a goat not
[1:50:31] a
[1:50:32] lamb if he would have tried to went
[1:50:35] Before the Throne of God he would have
[1:50:37] been thrown out that's right of the
[1:50:39] presence of
[1:50:40] God but he wouldn't do it cuz he knew
[1:50:44] his
[1:50:46] position and just like with ours there
[1:50:49] comes hardships
[1:50:50] and difficulty but I guarantee you one
[1:50:52] thing there ain't not one member of the
[1:50:54] bride of Christ has ever been through
[1:50:57] what our lord Jesus went
[1:51:00] through ain't that right we were in the
[1:51:03] cess poool of sin and our Way's been up
[1:51:06] from the time he saved us but his way
[1:51:10] was come down hated criticized ridiculed
[1:51:13] lied forsaken by men and then turn right
[1:51:16] at the very end and father God the
[1:51:18] spirit for suck him and let him die
[1:51:23] sinner this horrible death in order to
[1:51:27] redeem
[1:51:28] us so if you're here tonight and you
[1:51:30] still got a goat nature you don't have
[1:51:33] to have it
[1:51:36] anymore you can become converted right
[1:51:38] here for this service
[1:51:40] sins he become a goat so you could
[1:51:44] become a
[1:51:46] lamb so if you're stubborn and
[1:51:48] hardheaded nobody don't be nothing well
[1:51:51] whether or not you want to admit it I'm
[1:51:52] going to go admit it for you got a goat
[1:51:53] nature you're stubborn you B this bad I
[1:51:56] don't believe that I don't believe that
[1:51:57] well get a l am nature and you'll
[1:52:00] believe every word God
[1:52:03] spoke praise
[1:52:05] God oh
[1:52:08] my let's jump down here to the brothers
[1:52:11] the
[1:52:12] conference title there in two song as
[1:52:15] you people that Shear has had the tapes
[1:52:17] on the Seven Seals when the lamb come
[1:52:19] forth to claim his Redemption what he
[1:52:21] had redeemed time was finished then he's
[1:52:24] working in it now doing the work of
[1:52:27] redemption but someday he walks from the
[1:52:30] sanctuary to take up the book of
[1:52:34] redemption that he's
[1:52:37] purchased with his own
[1:52:41] blood so there's a vision Visionary
[1:52:45] image of this taking a book and there's
[1:52:48] the reality form of taking the
[1:52:52] book Oh Glory to God and remember it was
[1:52:56] not the taking of the book that
[1:52:58] purchased it it was the blood it was not
[1:53:00] the resurrection from the dead that
[1:53:02] purchased it all of this steps into the
[1:53:05] Redemption you understand so we can't do
[1:53:07] away with any of
[1:53:08] them then the hour is over he comes
[1:53:11] forth then to claim what he has redeemed
[1:53:14] oh I got to read one more is it okay
[1:53:17] that's good cuz how was going to anyway
[1:53:18] but it just makes it nicer when yall say
[1:53:20] Amen listen to
[1:53:23] this now you see the
[1:53:25] seals when he was in his mediatorial
[1:53:28] work back there redeeming but someday he
[1:53:31] comes
[1:53:32] forth to get this
[1:53:36] book oh that he's redeemed and all
[1:53:41] that's in this
[1:53:43] book would be
[1:53:47] him for that's the believer
[1:53:53] the
[1:53:54] words in the
[1:54:00] book so in Revelation 5 in symbol form
[1:54:03] he takes the book from the
[1:54:06] eternities Revelation 10 it gives it to
[1:54:11] John and our age the seals are tore off
[1:54:15] the Mysteries made
[1:54:17] known can't you see how one leads in
[1:54:19] into the other into the other and then
[1:54:22] the last taking of the
[1:54:25] book is when your body's
[1:54:28] changed I love this one choss the
[1:54:30] mystery oh I absolutely love it someday
[1:54:34] he comes forth to get this book now
[1:54:35] notice someday he comes this this is not
[1:54:38] fulfilled friends someday he comes forth
[1:54:41] to get this book that he's redeemed and
[1:54:44] all that's in this book would be
[1:54:48] him for that's the
[1:54:51] believer wow it makes it sound like you
[1:54:54] and
[1:54:55] him are
[1:54:59] are the
[1:55:01] same oh I guess that's what he meant
[1:55:04] when he preached it the rising of the
[1:55:05] sun this are seal she is
[1:55:12] him you see we ain't got it
[1:55:15] yet y'all just stand there like a bunch
[1:55:17] of
[1:55:18] Baptist
[1:55:20] when it hits you about 3:00 in the
[1:55:21] morning you'll tear the sheets off your
[1:55:23] bed you go to running and screaming your
[1:55:25] wife will be dialing 911 say honey what

[1:55:41] this right here you ain't going in no
[1:55:48] rapture
[1:55:51] I read at the SE where brother man was
[1:55:52] talking about priest studying for Sunday
[1:55:55] and he said as priests we come to
[1:55:57] sacrifice and Worship the Lord and
[1:55:58] praise him and he said you let the devil
[1:56:01] tell you you're too
[1:56:02] tired you're too tired and he said you
[1:56:06] keep letting him do that he will take
[1:56:09] you to
[1:56:12] hell you imagine by you letting the
[1:56:15] devil tell you that you're too tired to
[1:56:18] worship God and you keep listening to
[1:56:20] him and you'll let him take you to
[1:56:24] hell I thought wow that is serious is it
[1:56:28] not let me close all that's in this book
[1:56:31] would be him for that's the believer the
[1:56:33] words in the book The
[1:56:35] Believer is the words in the book so
[1:56:37] friend it's not that in the book is the
[1:56:39] name Janet
[1:56:41] pay and um um Harry Reagan and Joe Hara
[1:56:47] and Donald Reagan Jr that's not my real
[1:56:51] name I've got a word
[1:56:55] name but the mystery of my life me
[1:56:59] coming to the Earth July the 9th
[1:57:03] 1956 starting on my journey back to full
[1:57:07] Redemption get saved at
[1:57:10] 12 get immersed in water in titles wrong
[1:57:14] way I would get the gift of the Holy
[1:57:17] Ghost I would speak in tongues
[1:57:19] I would start preaching at 18 all of
[1:57:22] that was right there the mystery of my
[1:57:25] life he would speak to me as I would
[1:57:27] cross Wolf Creek
[1:57:29] Dam audibly out of the backseat of the
[1:57:32] vehicle I was riding in and tell me
[1:57:34] about a predestinated plan and there's
[1:57:36] more light I didn't even believe in
[1:57:40] predestination what was it the mystery
[1:57:43] of my
[1:57:44] life oh glory to
[1:57:47] God and all that's in that he come for
[1:57:50] this book of redemption whose names are
[1:57:53] written on that
[1:57:55] book before the
[1:57:58] foundation of the
[1:58:02] world can I please read one
[1:58:07] more the church is a predestinated
[1:58:10] church every name that was ever put on
[1:58:11] that book Jesus came to redeem and when
[1:58:14] that last's name is
[1:58:17] redeemed the book is closed
[1:58:20] he didn't intend that no one be lost but
[1:58:22] his for knowledge let him know who would
[1:58:23] be lost therefore he could predestinate
[1:58:26] and their names are put on that book and
[1:58:28] when that book of redemption is closed
[1:58:29] and sealed with Seven Seals while he's
[1:58:31] been worked out by the mysterious powers
[1:58:34] of God and someday when that book of
[1:58:36] redemption is finished the lamb takes it
[1:58:39] then that last name is called off that
[1:58:43] the lamb comes forward to call for what
[1:58:46] he has
[1:58:47] redeemed that's his
[1:58:49] church and I believe the time is close
[1:58:53] at
[1:58:54] hand and everybody
[1:58:58] said let's B it
[1:59:07] together dear Lord
[1:59:12] Jesus heavenly father as we have our
[1:59:15] heads
[1:59:15] bowed to the dusts of the Earth from
[1:59:18] whence our body were
[1:59:21] taken we realize this flesh is not the
[1:59:25] real
[1:59:29] us as I listened to a minister the other
[1:59:32] day Lord as he was sharing with
[1:59:34] me some of the experiences that he' been
[1:59:39] through his wife that he' been married
[1:59:41] to for 21 years he went to church on
[1:59:44] Sunday morning and she wasn't feeling
[1:59:47] good
[1:59:48] so his two children came back after
[1:59:53] church to check on
[1:59:54] her she was expecting twin
[1:59:58] boys when they come back they find their
[2:00:02] mama laying in the kitchen floor
[2:00:06] dead they called their
[2:00:09] daddy he comes in there tore all to
[2:00:11] pieces of
[2:00:13] course shaking quivering
[2:00:17] crying and he said brother Donnie God
[2:00:19] let me see a
[2:00:22] vision and he said I saw my wife leave
[2:00:26] out of her
[2:00:28] body and I saw two young men leave out
[2:00:33] of her as
[2:00:38] well so the brother lost his wife and a
[2:00:42] set of twin
[2:00:43] boys in the same
[2:00:47] day yet Lord God God you knew their
[2:00:50] names before the world ever
[2:00:53] began as you know our
[2:00:57] names no doubt the mystery of our life
[2:01:00] contains much Sadness and
[2:01:04] Sorrow we have
[2:01:06] disappointments heartbreaks
[2:01:10] misunderstandings and your will will
[2:01:12] inflict Upon Us sometimes pain and
[2:01:18] sorrow
[2:01:20] but it's only for a fleeting moment for
[2:01:23] as Paul said I reckon that the present
[2:01:26] sufferings of this time are not worthy
[2:01:28] to be compared to the glory which shall
[2:01:31] be revealed in
[2:01:33] us at that
[2:01:36] day
[2:01:39] Hallelujah Lord Jesus help us to be
[2:01:43] faithful if there's a one here tonight
[2:01:45] Lord
[2:01:47] that have not heard their name called
[2:01:50] from that book I don't mean that they
[2:01:52] heard a a voice call some kind of
[2:01:57] name but it was something that got a
[2:01:59] hold to
[2:02:00] them might have been sitting on a bar
[2:02:03] stool they might have been out in a barn
[2:02:04] somewhere just got through milking the
[2:02:06] cows they might have been sitting in a
[2:02:08] Baptist Church Pentecostal Church
[2:02:10] whatever
[2:02:11] more but it was like something Beyond
[2:02:14] them was calling them to a place higher
[2:02:17] than they ever knew
[2:02:21] Lord God I want to say tonight I thank
[2:02:23] you so
[2:02:25] much that as human beings you have
[2:02:28] allowed us as your
[2:02:31] people to express your personal
[2:02:34] presence in this day that we live what
[2:02:38] an honor to have a gift is a wonderful
[2:02:42] thing to be able to sing for you a
[2:02:44] wonderful thing to be able to preach
[2:02:48] awesome but we know there'll be many
[2:02:50] people that will do those things and
[2:02:52] stand before you in Matthew 24:24 and be
[2:02:55] judged and be
[2:02:57] lost but if one ever is granted that
[2:03:00] personal
[2:03:02] presence of Jesus Christ and his
[2:03:05] being that is his part of the book of
[2:03:10] life for everything that was in the book
[2:03:14] was
[2:03:15] you so the Book of Life is the mystery
[2:03:19] of your new married
[2:03:24] life
[2:03:27] Hallelujah for we know that our name was
[2:03:30] actually placed in that
[2:03:32] book when your name was no doubt yours
[2:03:37] was the first one in the
[2:03:41] top of the
[2:03:44] page and the prophet said when your name
[2:03:46] was spoke there so out hours was spoken
[2:03:49] to
[2:03:51] existence before the foundation of the

[2:04:20] bride what she needed to hear what she
[2:04:23] needed to see what she needed to
[2:04:28] rejoicing the sad part about it is
[2:04:30] Father it helps us to realize there's
[2:04:33] people who set in our own church people
[2:04:35] who set in message churches around the
[2:04:38] world and they would sit under the
[2:04:40] preaching of an open book for years and
[2:04:43] turn and walk away and go to some
[2:04:45] denominational vomit or go to some
[2:04:49] hybrid so-called message
[2:04:52] guy they prove thems
[2:04:56] Unworthy of eternal
[2:05:01] life How could a person ever walk away
[2:05:05] from the open Book of Revelation 10 when
[2:05:08] they have been invited by the mighty
[2:05:10] Angel
