[40:20] live so that if we are to leave that
[40:25] very day we can leave every everything
[40:28] intact everything in order cuz the truth
[40:32] of it is we never
[40:33] know when we'll be our last
[40:36] day so we want to have everything taken
[40:40] care
[40:41] of you see how we are as Mortals we have
[40:45] our shortcomings our failures our
[40:48] mistakes but we're so glad as your
[40:51] Prophet has taught us that when we lay
[40:53] down at
[40:54] night that we can be able to tell him
[40:58] we ask him to forgive us for anything
[41:00] that we've messed up during the day and
[41:02] anything that we've done that's
[41:03] displeased
[41:05] him and then we can feel like that at
[41:08] the close of the day we've done our
[41:12] best and we know Lord that if we are
[41:15] trusting in you and believing in your
[41:18] report then when we stand before you
[41:21] that day it will be written and said
[41:25] about us the way it was about
[41:28] Abraham that he believed
[41:32] God and it was imputed unto him for
[41:36] righteousness
[41:37] sake may that be every one of our
[41:40] testimony Lord Jesus because we know our
[41:42] flaws and our
[41:44] mistakes would certainly outweigh any
[41:47] good we would ever do if there's not a
[41:51] mediatorial value that will step between
[41:55] us and our Humanity
[41:58] that wouldn't be a human ever be
[42:00] saved but you knew that so you made a
[42:04] way and we are so
[42:06] grateful we pray for the Phillips family
[42:09] tonight Lord and the church family and
[42:12] all the friends that knew brother Jerry
[42:14] and for sister Linda were asking that
[42:16] you'd be merciful to her and help her
[42:18] Lord during one of the greatest losses
[42:21] in her life and now dealing with this
[42:23] physical pain herself Lord Jesus would
[42:26] you be be mindful of each of them Lord
[42:28] the other needs that were uplifted here
[42:30] tonight signifying by the hand being
[42:32] raised would you move for them Lord help
[42:35] us as we look into your word father we
[42:39] are such a needy people but we bring all
[42:41] our needs our petitions our requests
[42:44] before your throne and we leave them
[42:46] there with you knowing that you know how
[42:49] to take care of each one of them in the
[42:51] name of the Lord Jesus we
[42:53] pray amen God bless you
[42:58] isin't it good to be in the house of the
[42:59] Lord yes what a privilege it is for us
[43:02] to be gathered together once again let's
[43:04] turn to Revelation chap 10 verse one if
[43:07] you
[43:09] would Revelation chap
[43:12] 10 verse
[43:14] one one of my favorite subjects in
[43:18] studying and and uh talking about is
[43:24] redemption because I see God and in so
[43:28] many ways of not only human life but in
[43:32] nature and how that God
[43:36] redeems and that God will let the leaves
[43:39] fall off of a tree the
[43:42] potass calcium all the nutrients that's
[43:45] there in the leaves will fall off and
[43:48] the roots in a matter of time will pull
[43:50] them right back down into the ground and
[43:53] the leaves will come back up again in a
[43:56] new form
[43:58] that's Redemption God does the same
[44:01] thing of course for human beings for
[44:04] everything that serves his purpose there
[44:07] is a resurrection to it Revelation 10
[44:11] verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel
[44:14] come down from heaven closed with a
[44:17] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[44:21] and his face as it were the Sun and his
[44:26] feet as pillars of fire now notice the
[44:29] Raymond he's dressed for the
[44:34] occasion this look and this appearance
[44:38] would not have worked on
[44:41] Calvary this look and this appearance
[44:45] would not have worked before
[44:48] Pilate but it works in Revelation
[44:52] 10 and he had in his hand a little book
[44:57] open now remember the same book in
[45:00] Revelation 5 but the book was closed in
[45:03] Revelation 5 but now it's opened and he
[45:07] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[45:11] left foot on the earth and cried with a
[45:16] loud voice as when a lion roar us and
[45:21] when he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[45:26] their voices
[45:28] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[45:30] their voices I was about to Rite now
[45:33] remember John heard what they said it
[45:37] was not a mystery to John because when
[45:39] they thundered he heard exactly what
[45:42] they said so he gets his pen his scroll
[45:45] paper there and he's going to write it
[45:47] down but he said I was about to write
[45:50] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[45:52] unto me seal up those things which the
[45:55] seven Thunders uttered and write them
[46:00] not and the angel which I saw stand upon
[46:03] the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[46:06] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[46:09] liveth forever and ever who created
[46:12] heaven and the things that therein are
[46:15] and the earth and the things that
[46:17] therein are and the Sea and the things
[46:20] which are therein that there should be
[46:22] time no longer so it's the Declaration
[46:26] of a Heavenly angel that says time is
[46:31] running out so it's a dispensational
[46:34] change of something that's fixing to
[46:36] happen but in the days of the voice of
[46:39] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[46:43] sound the mystery of God want you notice
[46:47] that John didn't put this in plural form
[46:51] the
[46:52] mysteries of God but the mystery
[46:57] of God should be finished as he hath
[47:02] declared to his
[47:04] servants the prophets may the Lord bless
[47:07] his word you may be
[47:12] seated I realize for many down Through
[47:16] the Ages Revelation 10 has been much of
[47:19] a mystery within itself as Revelation
[47:24] the entire Book of Revelation is to many
[47:26] but yet we believe that God has promised
[47:30] in the last days that he would make
[47:32] known those things which was necessary
[47:36] to be able to produce a faith that will
[47:39] lift us into a Rapture in Revelation we
[47:43] find the deity of God we find the
[47:47] Sevenfold personage of God as he reveals
[47:50] himself starting in chapter one and then
[47:53] chapter 2 we move over chapter three we
[47:56] begin in the the church ages chapter 4
[47:58] we see where it's the end chapter 5 the
[48:02] little book is there in the hands of him
[48:04] that set on the throne and then we keep
[48:07] coming till we arrive to Revelation chap
[48:10] 10 with a a significance of something
[48:14] that God had not shown in the previous
[48:18] chapters and we've been looking at the
[48:20] book of Ru and how it parallels to
[48:23] Revelation 5 and also Revelation 10
[48:27] because we are a people of redemption
[48:30] and we are a people that are living we
[48:33] believe in the closest stage that has
[48:37] ever been to the Redemption of our
[48:40] bodies I think it benefits us as the
[48:42] people of God to look into the word that
[48:45] we might be able to find out who we are
[48:49] and what's prophesied for us so God
[48:52] could have great prophecies and yet if
[48:55] we lived in those a that day when those
[48:58] prophecies were supposed to come to pass
[49:01] if we were not aware of what God had
[49:05] promised for the season we could live
[49:08] much of our lives and we could go to
[49:11] church we could participate in religious
[49:14] services and believe that there was a
[49:16] god there was a Heaven There was a hell
[49:19] there was a devil there was good there
[49:21] was right there was wrong there was evil
[49:23] and so on but if we were not illuminated
[49:27] to our age in which God had promised
[49:31] certain things now we know what one of
[49:33] the reasons why that the Jews so missed
[49:36] him 2,000 years ago because they had
[49:40] taken the promises of what they felt
[49:43] like applied to the Messianic coming so
[49:46] they took Genesis 3 where God himself
[49:49] said that he would raise up a seed it
[49:52] would bruise the serpent they took the
[49:54] Messianic prophecy of psms they took the
[49:57] Messianic prophecy of Hagi 2 they took
[50:00] the Messianic prophecy of Zechariah 7
[50:04] Zechariah 14 Jeremiah 23 they took the
[50:08] prophecy of Malachi 3 they took so many
[50:11] of those things and they put them
[50:14] together in a way they thought that he
[50:17] was going to come but the problem was it
[50:20] was according to their thinking and not
[50:23] God's thinking so when God sent a forun
[50:27] which was Isaiah 40:3 we better know
[50:31] this man as John the Baptist also the
[50:33] fulfilling of Malachi 3:1 and the first
[50:36] part of Malachi 4 and when God did that
[50:39] instead of them becoming Anointed with
[50:43] the anointing that was on John they
[50:46] stayed with what their church had to say
[50:49] and what their forefathers had to say
[50:52] because after all it had been handed
[50:54] down to them from their fathers and
[50:57] their fathers and their fathers and who
[51:00] is this guy he was a man that was very
[51:03] odd very unusual clothed in Camel's hair
[51:08] and he ate Locust and Wild Honey a very
[51:11] strange sort of a guy and had no you
[51:14] know no really no approval of the
[51:17] Sanhedrin he was not a Pharisee he was
[51:20] not a a scene he was not a zealot they
[51:23] really didn't know where he belong as a
[51:25] matter of fact they sent some people
[51:26] people one day and said you know our our
[51:29] overseers sent us to find out who are
[51:32] you anyway and and where do you come
[51:34] from and where do you get the authority
[51:37] to do these things that you're doing he
[51:40] answered them simply by the scripture
[51:43] and they walked away just as blind as
[51:46] they were before they came to it because
[51:49] they did not catch the anointed word for
[51:53] the hour they were living now John was
[51:56] sent to forun this coming Messiah that
[51:59] had been prophesied about for thousands
[52:02] of years but if you don't catch the
[52:05] Forerunner I wonder how many that miss
[52:09] the Forerunner that will catch the true
[52:12] message when it arrives so those who
[52:16] minimize the value of the Forerunner in
[52:20] every age of God how many of them
[52:23] identify with the true Messenger most of
[52:25] them don't so we can see the value of us
[52:29] as the people of God that if God foran
[52:33] his second coming with one with the
[52:37] spirit of Elijah on him again also
[52:42] prophesied by the same Prophet Malachi
[52:45] that prophesied of the first Rong that
[52:48] forerun his first coming I believe we
[52:51] better
[52:51] listen we better pay attention or we
[52:56] will become like that age 2,000 years
[52:59] ago so they went to the temple they went
[53:03] to the synagogue they offered the turtle
[53:06] does the pigeon the lamb the Pascal lamb
[53:09] they they took the cedar they all those
[53:12] rituals and routines and they kept the
[53:15] Passover they kept it to the letter all
[53:17] of that they done and yet they crucified
[53:21] the Lord Jesus Christ now he did not
[53:25] come without a war
[53:27] and his Advent was so great I want you
[53:30] to notice how that God will categorize
[53:33] his word it's not for every event that
[53:37] God will send a forerunner now as far as
[53:40] we know Moses never had a forerunner
[53:45] Joshua never had a forerunner Jeremiah
[53:48] never had a forerunner Ezekiel never had
[53:52] a forerun so when God sends a for Runner
[53:57] before a messenger we better pay
[54:00] attention because it's something
[54:04] extraordinary even above and beyond
[54:08] someone like Moses Joshua Zachariah
[54:12] Malachi Hagi of all of them prophets you
[54:16] understand what I'm saying none of them
[54:18] had a forerunner before them so when God
[54:21] sent a forerunner to the Earth the
[54:24] people should have known by that
[54:27] Forerunner it was something that had
[54:29] never been since the dawn of time that
[54:33] God had ever sent a forerunner to a
[54:36] prophet before the people should have
[54:39] known that if God is going to do that
[54:43] then it must be something of Great Value
[54:46] and importance a coming of a prophet
[54:49] himself is so important to God because
[54:52] he is the very mouthpiece of God himself
[54:55] and then for God to forun it must have
[54:59] been such value in the eyes of God and
[55:03] what did they do to him well of course
[55:05] they said he was crazy they did not
[55:07] believe him they ridiculed John they
[55:10] made fun of him and so if they did that
[55:12] to the Forerunner it should not be an
[55:15] unusual thing that when the main
[55:18] attraction was reveal that they never
[55:21] knew it either they never caught what
[55:24] God was doing why their treatment of the
[55:28] Forerunner was the epitome of the way
[55:31] they were going to treat the main
[55:34] attraction now listen don't be blind
[55:37] that you and I have also been privileged
[55:40] by God that he would send a forerunner
[55:44] again before the second coming of the
[55:47] Lord Jesus but what all is involved in
[55:51] that second coming you see it is more
[55:55] than just a Corporal appearing of our
[55:59] kinsman redeemer coming to claim the
[56:03] book it is more than just a resurrection
[56:07] and a Rapture as great as those events
[56:11] are it is more in the coming of the Lord
[56:15] which is the mystery of the seven seal
[56:19] now in the seven seal there's multiple
[56:22] things it's like layers that lays in the
[56:25] mystery of the seals and in the seven
[56:28] seal as the prophet says no one knew
[56:32] that was the minute or the hour that
[56:36] Christ would come that's right now in
[56:39] that coming it was not the resurrection
[56:43] neither was it the body change for the
[56:46] living what was it it was the word
[56:50] presence of Jesus Christ himself not the
[56:54] Corporal body now the the corpor body
[56:57] when he returns he will not even put his
[56:59] feet upon the Earth but it was a
[57:02] reappearing again of the son of man to
[57:06] unite him and his bride together and he
[57:10] could not trust it just to a profit
[57:13] alone now if we would have been so
[57:15] blessed by God just to have the ministry
[57:19] of Malachi for in this day that within
[57:22] itself oh my it's just it's beyond words
[57:25] of blessed that we would have been but
[57:29] Malachi 4
[57:31] foran the great
[57:34] one now if God sent one that was so
[57:38] great which was a forerunner what was
[57:42] fixing to take
[57:44] place now because Redemption has
[57:48] different cycles and phases for us
[57:51] Redemption is not only coming out of
[57:54] something but it's also
[57:56] going into something and in order for
[57:59] our Boaz to play the full part of the
[58:03] Kinsman redeemers ship it was also the
[58:07] same transitory power for him a coming
[58:11] out of something and going into to
[58:15] something else so he had to come out of
[58:19] the Eternal out of the very Heart Of God
[58:24] now notice the Kinsman Redeemer work he
[58:27] had to come out of something and go into
[58:31] to something else so he came out of
[58:35] Eternity and he went into something else
[58:38] what was that something else a body in
[58:41] time he came out of a glorified State
[58:46] remember he was the word in the
[58:48] beginning was the word and the Word was
[58:50] with God and the Word was God and the
[58:53] same as in the beginning with God all
[58:55] things are created by Him and without
[58:58] him was not anything made that was made
[59:01] and of course we know then that the
[59:02] Bible goes on to say and there was a man
[59:05] sent from God whose name was John he was
[59:08] not that light but he was sent to Bear
[59:11] witness of that light that all men
[59:13] through him might be saved so God here
[59:17] brings the word and then it merges the
[59:21] Forerunner right there with him in those
[59:24] verses and God did a tremendous thing
[59:28] now this was the stage of redemption in
[59:31] the act of condensation that he's
[59:33] changing himself from that which is
[59:35] invisible to a form that can die a form
[59:40] that can feel pain a form that can look
[59:43] like a human in so much that people
[59:45] would look at him and just consider him
[59:48] to be an ordinary man now the Effigy Of
[59:51] The Lord Jesus was not something that
[59:54] you just stand around and light rays
[59:56] would just Pierce out from him like that
[59:59] everybody would have known there was
[1:00:01] something special about him had that
[1:00:03] happened but he looked so much like an
[1:00:05] ordinary man that people would have
[1:00:08] looked at him and they would have never
[1:00:10] known that he was God they would have
[1:00:13] seen that there was something about him
[1:00:15] of course by his works and the way that
[1:00:17] he talked but his flesh was so much like
[1:00:20] ours that he could bleed his flesh was
[1:00:24] so much wrapped and time that it died
[1:00:28] his body died on the cross he had pain
[1:00:32] he had sorrow he felt anguish the Lord
[1:00:35] Jesus felt sadness and happiness he
[1:00:39] rejoiced and he felt all types of
[1:00:41] emotions just like we do and yet there
[1:00:45] was something on the inside that was
[1:00:48] greater than anything man had ever seen
[1:00:52] before so the part of redemption that he
[1:00:56] did at his first Advent was he must pay
[1:01:00] the price the penalty must be met so the
[1:01:04] justice of God can be emerged into the
[1:01:07] penalty now remember when man fell and
[1:01:10] man stayed across the chasm every man
[1:01:14] from Adam until that time died except
[1:01:18] for those that were translated but there
[1:01:20] must be the justice of God that is going
[1:01:23] to be met so God can get the book back
[1:01:27] into the hands of his children because
[1:01:30] that book holds their titled deed of
[1:01:33] redemption if the book is not returned
[1:01:35] to man now don't misunderstand me no
[1:01:38] matter how much he died on the cross how
[1:01:41] much blood come out of his body and the
[1:01:45] agony that he experienced that is only
[1:01:48] one part of the cycle of redemption the
[1:01:52] book was not at the cross do you
[1:01:57] understand the book was not there at the
[1:02:00] cross he never took the book at the
[1:02:04] cross I wonder sometimes if even some of
[1:02:07] our brothers in our own ranks if they
[1:02:09] realize the significance of preaching
[1:02:11] Revelation 5 and Revelation 10 it's like
[1:02:14] all they focus on is just the blood and
[1:02:17] the mercy seed at the cross and it's not
[1:02:19] they don't understand that the book at
[1:02:23] the death of the Lord Jesus the book was
[1:02:26] still in heaven he did not take the book
[1:02:30] at the cross the book was not at the
[1:02:32] cross the book was in heaven but the
[1:02:36] price was paid at the cross so that in
[1:02:39] Revelation five he could take the book
[1:02:43] when was that when did he take the
[1:02:47] book not on the cross amen not on
[1:02:54] Resurrection morning
[1:02:56] but there was a
[1:02:58] time a slot
[1:03:01] amen the end
[1:03:03] time Revelation 10 did not pertain to
[1:03:09] Paul The Book of Revelation was not even
[1:03:12] written in the days of Paul it was not
[1:03:15] written in the days of Peter and many of
[1:03:17] the original
[1:03:19] Apostles but it was given as a prophecy
[1:03:23] to the end time because they would not
[1:03:26] need rapturing face they would need
[1:03:30] Resurrection
[1:03:32] face so they would live their life they
[1:03:34] would preach the gospel they would be
[1:03:37] illuminated by the presence of God and
[1:03:39] they would go down to the Grave
[1:03:41] countless of millions of them but God
[1:03:44] knew there would be a people one day in
[1:03:48] that last age upon the Earth that would
[1:03:52] be
[1:03:53] alive when the Lord Jesus would come and
[1:03:56] there would have to be such a power
[1:03:59] revealed in that end time they becoming
[1:04:03] one with that word that one morning they
[1:04:05] would get up and brush their teeth and
[1:04:08] comb their hair and normal stuff that
[1:04:10] they would start out their regular day
[1:04:13] not knowing that that day is the last
[1:04:16] day of their mortality in a moment in
[1:04:19] the twinkling of an eye they will be
[1:04:22] changed by the power of God and there
[1:04:26] maturity will cause the
[1:04:30] resurrection
[1:04:33] Hallelujah and yet the great price that
[1:04:36] he paid we could never
[1:04:39] overemphasize what he did for us at the
[1:04:41] cross we could never thank him enough
[1:04:45] for the blood that he gave is that right
[1:04:48] and we know that the justice of God was
[1:04:51] never met in the Ten Commandments it
[1:04:53] only brought out more Justice and
[1:04:56] judgment it could not be met in the
[1:04:58] prophets they were the body of the word
[1:05:01] of the Old Testament symbolism being
[1:05:03] made but yet it could never be met in
[1:05:06] the prophets and God himself must
[1:05:09] produce the product and the law couldn't
[1:05:12] do it the prophets couldn't do it
[1:05:14] nothing else could do it and God made a
[1:05:17] demand and if God makes a demand and man
[1:05:20] cannot meet that demand God must meet it
[1:05:23] himself and he met it in the person of
[1:05:26] the Lord Jesus so in order to become our
[1:05:31] goel our kinsman redeemer he must become
[1:05:35] a man all man and all God never had been
[1:05:40] a creature like him on the face of the
[1:05:44] Earth he was the only begotten Son of
[1:05:47] God but let me just remind you the word
[1:05:49] goes on to say he was the firstborn
[1:05:52] among many
[1:05:54] Brethren he was was the first like that
[1:05:57] but he certainly was not the last well
[1:06:01] praise the Lord so what must he do he
[1:06:04] must from his own body the own Corporal
[1:06:08] body that was given to him upon the
[1:06:10] Earth carry within his Humanity the
[1:06:14] created blood of God which would be the
[1:06:17] bleach that would be able to purge man
[1:06:20] back to where man one day could handle
[1:06:24] that book himself
[1:06:26] and yet at the cross as we've been
[1:06:28] through it many many times before but at
[1:06:31] the cross he did not die the death of a
[1:06:34] righteous man he did not die the death
[1:06:39] of we know what some people would look
[1:06:40] at and say oh my this great holy
[1:06:43] righteous man he became our sin oh my
[1:06:48] the Bible tells us he who knew no sin
[1:06:51] become the our sin they all that the
[1:06:54] very righteousness of God could be
[1:06:57] handed to you and I aren't you grateful
[1:06:59] for that tonight he never lied he never
[1:07:02] stole he never done one thing wrong in
[1:07:05] his life but it's what he became that
[1:07:08] exacted from him the
[1:07:12] price and yet we know the value of
[1:07:15] things and we all certainly know with
[1:07:18] inflation how everything has gone up
[1:07:21] you're paying now more for groceries
[1:07:23] than you've ever paid in your life is
[1:07:24] that right you're paying more for gas
[1:07:27] you're paying more for this and that and
[1:07:28] the other we don't like paying that
[1:07:31] price but if we want it we have to pay
[1:07:33] it do we not the way the Lord God looked
[1:07:36] at it there could be no greater thing
[1:07:39] that he could do than to pay the
[1:07:42] ultimate price in order to bring us back
[1:07:45] not just save us oh my I wish people
[1:07:48] could understand there's more to the
[1:07:51] Cross than just being saved that's just
[1:07:54] the beginning of your walk with God
[1:07:57] there's so many wonderful things that he
[1:08:00] has laid up in store for them that love
[1:08:02] him my goodness children there's great
[1:08:04] things in the economy of God no doubt
[1:08:07] we've never even looked into I to the
[1:08:09] prophet had preached for years he said
[1:08:11] there are untapped resources that we've
[1:08:15] never even broke into
[1:08:17] yet but people get so happy just going
[1:08:20] to church well I gave my heart to God
[1:08:21] praise the Lord I'm going to go to I'm
[1:08:23] going go to church now I guess I'll go
[1:08:24] every now and anyhow where I need it or
[1:08:26] not and that's all I really need oh my
[1:08:29] goodness I I I believe there's so much
[1:08:31] more in God than what any of us have
[1:08:33] ever seen and it's not like well brother
[1:08:36] Don in the Millennium will get it why in
[1:08:37] the world would I want to wait to the
[1:08:39] Millennium I want what I can get right
[1:08:41] now don't you I want everything that I
[1:08:44] can be allowed to understand in the
[1:08:46] economy of God whatever it can be with
[1:08:48] my name on it let me have it
[1:08:51] Lord I don't want to just barely get it
[1:08:55] and can barely understand it now there
[1:08:58] must be a contract you understand the
[1:09:00] parallel of Christ Jesus and Boaz in
[1:09:03] that Boaz is looking for a legal match a
[1:09:09] legal match and he wants a bride that
[1:09:13] will be his and his only he does not
[1:09:17] want to share her with to he don't want
[1:09:19] to share her with no one else he wants
[1:09:22] her to be
[1:09:23] his amen the Lord Jesus wants exactly
[1:09:28] the same thing he does not want to share
[1:09:31] you or me with the world come on
[1:09:35] somebody he don't want you to be with
[1:09:37] him one night and the devil the next
[1:09:40] night and the Lord the next night the
[1:09:42] devil the next night or the Lord that
[1:09:44] morning and and the devil that night he
[1:09:47] wants you with him all the time and if
[1:09:50] the Devil comes knocking on your door
[1:09:52] you say get out of here devil I am
[1:09:54] already married to Jesus Christ we are
[1:09:57] already joined together by holy word
[1:10:00] Lord you leave right now I ain't got no
[1:10:03] time for you
[1:10:05] devil anybody feel that way by the grace
[1:10:07] of God you see but Boaz had a way that
[1:10:12] this must be done I me know that there
[1:10:15] was four stages by which Ruth was coming
[1:10:18] toight the last one was Ruth waiting and
[1:10:22] then the third one rather and then Ruth
[1:10:24] rewarded this is where we are we're in
[1:10:27] that waiting stage for our Boaz to
[1:10:31] finalize Redemption why are we still
[1:10:35] having Saints to die because our bodies
[1:10:38] are not yet redeemed I wonder why are
[1:10:41] are people sitting here tonight sick
[1:10:43] people their hair turning gray others is
[1:10:45] turning loose people got false teeth got
[1:10:48] glasses got contacts got canes got
[1:10:51] wheelchairs come on somebody why because
[1:10:54] our bodies are not yet redeemed and they
[1:10:57] are still subject to the weakness of the
[1:11:00] Flesh and you better believe the devil
[1:11:02] knows it too he knows every weakness
[1:11:04] you've got he knows every weakness I've
[1:11:07] got he knows how to hit us oh y'all want
[1:11:09] to have church tonight he knows exactly
[1:11:12] what to bother you with just like he
[1:11:14] does me and do we make mistakes we all
[1:11:17] do anybody made any this
[1:11:19] week oh praise the Lord glad to have you
[1:11:21] Angels that's with us tonight I see some
[1:11:23] hands that didn't go up but he knows all
[1:11:26] of that but one day he will lose his
[1:11:29] grip on us that's right but the Lord
[1:11:32] Jesus wants a bride that is his own how
[1:11:35] many of you Brothers here tonight that
[1:11:37] are married or you young men that are
[1:11:39] not would you want to share your wife
[1:11:40] with some of the other brothers in the
[1:11:42] church any of your brothers would you
[1:11:45] want to share your wife or some other
[1:11:47] man and she goes home with you tonight
[1:11:49] and then she goes home with some other
[1:11:51] man from the church uh tomorrow night
[1:11:53] and then the next night and you never
[1:11:54] know exactly where she at until it's
[1:11:56] your night again well no you wouldn't
[1:11:58] want that you said that's absolutely
[1:12:00] ludicrous I'd never want such a thing
[1:12:02] and yet we do the Lord Jesus that way we
[1:12:05] give him our leftover time our leftover
[1:12:08] commitment our leftover strengths amen
[1:12:11] many of you lay down at night and you're
[1:12:13] wore out and you ain't hardly got no
[1:12:15] strength left and you you fought Leo to
[1:12:17] seal like crazy and you lay there in the
[1:12:19] last three or four words you say oh
[1:12:21] Jesus Jesus amen there you go you're
[1:12:24] gone you give football you give baseball
[1:12:28] basketball Fox News
[1:12:31] MSNBC all during the day y' ought to
[1:12:34] take away some of that time from
[1:12:36] MSNBC and give some more time to the
[1:12:39] Lord Jesus to read his word to praise
[1:12:42] Him
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:47] hallelujah notice this in Ruth
[1:12:50] 4:9 and Boaz said unto the elders and to
[1:12:53] all the people you Witnesses this day
[1:12:57] that I have bought all that was
[1:13:00] eliks and all that was chilon and Mayon
[1:13:04] of the hand of Naomi now I want you
[1:13:07] notice where we are in the cycle of
[1:13:10] redemption as we've looked at it a
[1:13:12] couple of Wednesday nights of what's
[1:13:14] going on with the Jews and all the
[1:13:17] oppression and all the things that are
[1:13:19] happening there remember
[1:13:22] Naomi was a part of the Redemption of
[1:13:27] Ruth God is focusing of course on his
[1:13:31] Gentile bride but he's also got his eye
[1:13:35] on Naomi and Naomi in this age is still
[1:13:40] over there in the land of Israel come on
[1:13:43] children and that our Redemption is tied
[1:13:47] also to Naomi so elik was gone chilon
[1:13:52] was gone Mayon was gone but how did he
[1:13:56] buy this how by what proxy did he
[1:14:01] purchase this
[1:14:03] Naomi Naomi so through Naomi he got
[1:14:09] Roose through Naomi now now she tried
[1:14:13] her best to discourage her she said go
[1:14:16] back to your mother go back to your Gods
[1:14:19] you know the beautiful beautiful verses
[1:14:21] there and she said I will not go where
[1:14:23] you go I will go where you die I will
[1:14:27] die where you're buried I will be buried
[1:14:29] your God will be my god oh yeah that's a
[1:14:32] gentile bride all right if you notice
[1:14:34] you wasn't a trinitarian either she said
[1:14:36] your God Elohim will be my Elohim your
[1:14:40] Elohim your elsh ey will be my elshad ey
[1:14:44] where you die I will die where you're
[1:14:46] buried I will be buried notice the judeo
[1:14:50] Christian Foundation of what we believe
[1:14:53] so how in the world could you ever get a
[1:14:55] Jew to be convinced that there's three
[1:14:57] gods in the New Testament when there's
[1:14:59] only one in the old well come on
[1:15:01] somebody but you realize that we are
[1:15:04] tied together I know that many
[1:15:06] Christians don't understand this tie in
[1:15:10] the judeo Christian bound as it's come
[1:15:12] together but it is through Naomi that
[1:15:16] Boaz will pull Roose out by doing what
[1:15:20] he what he allowed Naomi to do in his
[1:15:23] first Advent on the Earth first what did
[1:15:25] they do the Jews and what's he going to
[1:15:28] do in the last day he will gather them
[1:15:30] again and if you notice when we come
[1:15:32] down to the last part of this whenever
[1:15:34] God actually blesses Ruth with a child
[1:15:38] Naomi takes that child and becomes a
[1:15:42] nurse so here she is in the stage of her
[1:15:45] Redemption and that 144,000 will be with
[1:15:49] the bride on the earth in the thousand
[1:15:52] year reign oh yes I'll be so glad when
[1:15:54] we get done with them old Jews we ain't
[1:15:56] never going to be done with them old
[1:15:57] Jews as you call them God loves them and
[1:16:00] he's got an elect number there ain't
[1:16:03] enough devils in Hell there ain't enough
[1:16:05] bombs in Russia there ain't enough I
[1:16:08] don't care what they do they will never
[1:16:10] wipe them out of God's
[1:16:16] mind I want you to notice how Boaz looks
[1:16:19] at
[1:16:20] this he says moreover Roose the oidas
[1:16:26] the wife of
[1:16:27] milon have I
[1:16:31] purchased to be my
[1:16:34] wife whom I have
[1:16:38] purchased to be my wife to raise up the
[1:16:41] name of the
[1:16:43] Dead upon his
[1:16:46] inheritance I believe there's a Ru in
[1:16:49] the last day that the Lord Jesus is
[1:16:51] going to raise his name that he's not
[1:16:54] dead either that's right he's Hebrews
[1:16:56] 13:8 the same yesterday today and
[1:16:58] forever well praise the Lord to raise
[1:17:01] the inheritance well you know that was
[1:17:03] in the days of the Apostles well only
[1:17:06] the apostles got the Holy Ghost well
[1:17:08] that's absolute nonsense whenever Paul
[1:17:10] went up in Acts chapter 19 and asked
[1:17:13] them about getting the Holy Ghost and
[1:17:14] they said how was you baptized he said
[1:17:16] well un John said that won't work now so
[1:17:18] they got re-baptized and the Holy Ghost
[1:17:20] fell on them they wasn't even the
[1:17:21] original 12 not only that but there's a
[1:17:24] person in this building tonight called
[1:17:26] Donald Lee Reagan Jr which is me I got
[1:17:30] the same holy ghost that Peter got on
[1:17:32] the day of Pentecost there's other
[1:17:34] people sitting in this building tonight
[1:17:36] men women boys and girls and you've got
[1:17:39] the same Holy Ghost don't you understand
[1:17:41] what you're doing the Lord Jesus is
[1:17:43] raising up his name and he's proving to
[1:17:46] people I'm not dead look at my wife I'm
[1:17:50] not dead I heal that one I save that one
[1:17:53] I done a miracle in that one's life
[1:17:55] what's he doing rais in his name that
[1:17:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:18:00] forever what an honor children what an
[1:18:04] honor oh praise the Lord that the name
[1:18:08] of the Dead be not cut off from among
[1:18:10] his breth and the gate notice and from
[1:18:14] the Gate of his
[1:18:16] place ye are
[1:18:18] witnesses this
[1:18:21] day so the business transactions
[1:18:25] and this
[1:18:26] day we're settled at a
[1:18:32] gate so you'd have at least 10 Elders
[1:18:37] there of course our Lord wanted to outdo
[1:18:40] that so he got
[1:18:43] 24 but you had to have at least 10
[1:18:46] Elders so Brother D had a piece of
[1:18:49] property and I'm going to buy that
[1:18:51] property me and brother D we go up to
[1:18:52] the gate of the elders and say all right
[1:18:54] brother what do you'all have but they
[1:18:56] said well brother Donnie wants to buy
[1:18:57] this property of mine I've got two two
[1:19:00] cows and three goats and 14 horses up
[1:19:02] there and about 32 dogs and I've got
[1:19:04] this that and other and we're going to
[1:19:05] settle this and okay so you agree to pay
[1:19:07] him that amount and D you agree yes I
[1:19:09] agree together all right now we are
[1:19:11] witnesses this day that Don is now the
[1:19:13] owner 32 dogs three Hogs 14 cows 37
[1:19:17] horses you know whatever more all right
[1:19:19] and we exchang the money now what they
[1:19:22] would also do remember is that they
[1:19:24] would would take off their shoe because
[1:19:27] the way they moved about on that
[1:19:30] property for the most part it was by
[1:19:32] walking so Footprints meant possession
[1:19:35] so the man sometimes it was both
[1:19:38] sometimes it was one but it was required
[1:19:42] absolutely required that the man selling
[1:19:45] it had to take his shoe off and give it
[1:19:49] to the buyer sometimes the buyer would
[1:19:51] also turn right around and the seller
[1:19:53] would give him is you back but it was a
[1:19:56] significance that I give you my word I
[1:19:59] will not be walking on your property no
[1:20:03] more here's my shoe this is a proof Oh
[1:20:07] Glory to God I won't be back bugging you
[1:20:10] no more I'll tell you one thing I think
[1:20:11] that's what we need to do to the devil
[1:20:13] tonight some of us need to get pretty
[1:20:15] sick and tired of that devil trying to
[1:20:18] steal our health and steal our children
[1:20:21] and steal our home and steal our peace
[1:20:24] well come on somebody steal the things
[1:20:26] that the Lord God has done for us and we
[1:20:29] ought to take his shoe off him and say
[1:20:31] get out get out right now I want my
[1:20:36] health back I want my joy back I want my
[1:20:40] peace back take your shoe and get out of
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:50] here ye are witnesses he says
[1:20:55] this day that I bought it then he comes
[1:20:58] around and said I have
[1:21:00] purchased
[1:21:01] Ruth to be my
[1:21:04] wife notice in Ephesians 1:13 in whom ye
[1:21:08] also trusted now the New Testament
[1:21:11] version after that you heard the word of
[1:21:15] truth but I want you to notice they
[1:21:17] didn't stop
[1:21:19] there the gospel of your
[1:21:23] salvation and whom also after that you
[1:21:27] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[1:21:30] Spirit of Promise oh my goodness that's
[1:21:32] New Testament
[1:21:33] Christians so then they just didn't hear
[1:21:37] and settle down praise God and
[1:21:41] everybody's favorite chorus I shall not
[1:21:45] be I shall not be
[1:21:49] moved the song leader won't move me the
[1:21:51] preacher won't move me no that's not the
[1:21:54] way the is the bride wants to have
[1:21:56] church I like that new song he sng just
[1:21:59] that's what we're here tonight for is it
[1:22:01] anybody come to see me well I didn't
[1:22:04] come to see you either did anybody here
[1:22:05] come to see Jesus I did too well if
[1:22:09] we're year for that purpose I believe we
[1:22:11] can see it yes sir now notice Paul said
[1:22:15] that after you believe you were sealed
[1:22:18] with that Holy Spirit of Promise so your
[1:22:21] believing does not seal you all about
[1:22:24] but I I I believe Jesus died for me
[1:22:26] that's not the seal I believe he raised
[1:22:29] from the dead that's not the seal but
[1:22:31] the seal is the Holy Ghost acts 238
[1:22:36] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:22:39] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:22:40] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:22:43] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:22:46] promises unto you unto your children
[1:22:48] then that are far off even as many as
[1:22:50] the Lord Our God shall call amen praise
[1:22:54] the Lord
[1:22:55] now notice he's talking about the
[1:22:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost in verse 14
[1:22:59] and he says which is the
[1:23:02] earnest of our
[1:23:04] inheritance look at the meaning of the
[1:23:06] word earnest the first
[1:23:10] installment
[1:23:12] paid as a pledge that the rest of the
[1:23:17] purchased
[1:23:19] inheritance will
[1:23:21] follow how many understand what payments
[1:23:24] are
[1:23:25] and he's got them okay so they make that
[1:23:29] convenient for us poor folks so whenever
[1:23:31] we buy things and we don't have the
[1:23:33] money to do it then we set it up on
[1:23:36] installments right and then once a month
[1:23:39] you know however it is you've got it set
[1:23:41] up the first the 15th the last of the
[1:23:43] month and you have to pay interest of
[1:23:45] course on that installment and you you
[1:23:47] know if you don't do it then they'll let
[1:23:49] you go with so many if you don't do it
[1:23:50] they going to reclaim that car that boat
[1:23:53] whatever it is that you bought so God
[1:23:55] said I tell you what I'm going to do I
[1:23:58] am going to set up an installment plan
[1:24:01] I'm going to give you one major big down
[1:24:05] payment and what it's going to do it's
[1:24:08] going to annihilate your own nature that
[1:24:11] is a big down payment it's going to
[1:24:14] annihilate your nature and it will
[1:24:16] Quicken that CG that I placed inside of
[1:24:20] you Hallelujah it will Quicken that c
[1:24:23] Gene and it will seal off your soul to
[1:24:27] the day of your Redemption and the devil
[1:24:30] will come knocking knocking knocking
[1:24:32] he'll aggravate you he'll tempt you
[1:24:35] he'll even talk you into doing things
[1:24:37] that's not right sometime but you'll
[1:24:39] repent every time and you'll make it
[1:24:41] right with me and the seal will still
[1:24:44] hold oh I'm so glad tonight when I get
[1:24:47] weary the seal still holds I'm so glad
[1:24:50] when I get low when I get in the valley
[1:24:53] that the seal wish somebody would have
[1:24:55] church with me tonight I'm so glad that
[1:24:58] whenever the Wall's falling apart the
[1:25:00] seal is still hoing I'm so glad when the
[1:25:03] government don't know what they're going
[1:25:05] to do the seal is still holy it will
[1:25:08] hold you it will hold me there's not
[1:25:12] enough devils in Hell there's not enough
[1:25:15] powers in darkness to break that seal it
[1:25:19] is ours it will hold us
[1:25:29] the first installment
[1:25:31] paid as a
[1:25:34] pledge now you see the reason some of
[1:25:36] you all
[1:25:38] wonder whether you've got the holy ghost
[1:25:40] or
[1:25:42] not is because sometimes we use so much
[1:25:47] of that first
[1:25:49] payment and sometimes we dip down into
[1:25:52] it and it just seems like we need a
[1:25:53] renewing
[1:25:55] or
[1:25:57] refreshing and this is why I founded
[1:25:59] preaching years and years generally when
[1:26:01] you preach the Holy Ghost is such a
[1:26:03] place and it'll raise it you know a
[1:26:04] question and people say oh goodness I I
[1:26:06] don't know if I've got it or not oh you
[1:26:08] know people get real serious and we
[1:26:10] should we definitely should but what I
[1:26:12] found most of the time the ones that
[1:26:14] that will really question theirself
[1:26:16] they're probably the ones that's got it
[1:26:19] and the ones that don't ever question
[1:26:20] theel they're probably the ones that
[1:26:22] don't cuz they're so Vince nothing ever
[1:26:25] touches them no way but them real
[1:26:27] genuine saints of God when they hear it
[1:26:29] preach and they sit there they B to fre
[1:26:30] oh God oh God I want to make sure oh God
[1:26:32] I want to make sure because there's
[1:26:33] something inside them they know there's
[1:26:35] more well of course there's more it's
[1:26:37] the rest of your payments it's the rest
[1:26:40] of your payments and many of us are
[1:26:42] wanting the rest of our payment that's
[1:26:44] what we're hungering for now but you've
[1:26:46] got to understand just because you're
[1:26:48] hungry don't mean that you ain't got the
[1:26:50] first down payment that down payment is
[1:26:52] what's making you hung hungry the first
[1:26:54] place but the devil will try to convince
[1:26:57] you because you're wanting more you
[1:26:59] ain't got it no that ain't the truth
[1:27:02] it's because that one payment is so good
[1:27:05] it's so powerful it's so rich and you
[1:27:08] think if it's that good and that's only
[1:27:10] a down payment I want the whole book oh
[1:27:13] yes sir I want the whole book I want my
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:22] inheritance the first and Stone paid as
[1:27:25] a pledge that the rest of the purchased
[1:27:27] inheritance will follow a portion of the
[1:27:31] purchase money
[1:27:34] paid as
[1:27:38] Earnest so we say God gives you
[1:27:41] $100 he
[1:27:44] say oh $100 would go very far today in
[1:27:48] today's economy with it oh
[1:27:52] boy well you use your faith to buy a
[1:27:55] little healing and you buy a little joy
[1:27:56] and you buy a little this and you say oh
[1:27:59] man I've only got 30
[1:28:02] 77327 left out of that oh my goodness I
[1:28:06] I need need a miracle for this well that
[1:28:08] brought it down to 5240 and then I need
[1:28:10] a little bit something else I'm down to
[1:28:12] 1275 that's the way we thinking in our
[1:28:14] mind oh goodness is it going to run out
[1:28:16] it won't run out you see that payment
[1:28:18] book is constantly renewing itself and
[1:28:20] you know he specializes in taking the
[1:28:23] oil when they ain't Harding none in the
[1:28:25] in the cruise and he specializes in
[1:28:27] taking a little handful of meal and he
[1:28:28] can just turn it into a whole lot of
[1:28:30] stuff that'll feed a whole lot of people
[1:28:32] come on somebody don't tell me old
[1:28:34] brother Don that was back in the Bible
[1:28:35] days oh no you see I sat at the house of
[1:28:38] a sister in India who had a very similar
[1:28:42] thing happened to her that she run out
[1:28:45] of meal and oil and the Great Famine
[1:28:48] struck that part of India and it lasted
[1:28:50] her for years some of the church people
[1:28:53] come into her church cuz they didn't
[1:28:54] have no food and her church people come
[1:28:57] over into her house she fed the pastor
[1:28:59] several meals fed people to the church
[1:29:01] several meal well come on somebody he
[1:29:04] wanted to take somebody well what if he
[1:29:05] would want to take you and prove his
[1:29:07] word and another word and let you prove
[1:29:09] it another word and another word he
[1:29:11] wants to prove his words if we will let
[1:29:14] him he might take us and prove his word
[1:29:17] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:19] forever
[1:29:24] which is the earnest the down
[1:29:28] payment of our inheritance until the
[1:29:32] Redemption of the purchased
[1:29:36] possession so The Possession has already
[1:29:39] been
[1:29:40] purchased but it's not yet been fully
[1:29:44] redeemed brother how can that be because
[1:29:48] the final stage of that Redemption will
[1:29:50] take place in your body
[1:29:54] unto the praise of his glory so we have
[1:29:58] the Holy Ghost as a
[1:30:00] pledge that my body change is sure so
[1:30:03] whether I go by the way of the Grave or
[1:30:05] if I'm
[1:30:06] alive my Holy Ghost witnesses to me that
[1:30:11] I will raise
[1:30:12] up the Redemption of the purchased
[1:30:16] possession so the
[1:30:18] acquisition that he will take it all
[1:30:22] friends if we could be able to look
[1:30:24] beyond the curtain of time tonight and
[1:30:26] see those saints of God what they are
[1:30:29] doing oh oh my that they wouldn't be one
[1:30:32] of us that even want to leave this place
[1:30:34] we wouldn't want to go home we wouldn't
[1:30:36] want to go to work tomorrow we wouldn't
[1:30:37] want to do nothing else we would be so
[1:30:40] caught up when God allowed that Prophet
[1:30:42] to go beyond the curtain of time and
[1:30:43] come back he said he would never be the
[1:30:46] same
[1:30:47] again oh it drawn something so to him
[1:30:51] that changed him and you realize the the
[1:30:53] reason is letting us enjoy this it's to
[1:30:56] the
[1:30:57] praise of his
[1:30:59] glory praise be to God notice 1
[1:31:02] Corinthians chapter
[1:31:04] 6:20 for ye are
[1:31:08] bought with Sur
[1:31:11] price now are we sure we believe this
[1:31:18] absolutely so Church money bought this
[1:31:22] Peach mang
[1:31:24] low calorie body armor
[1:31:29] light it was
[1:31:32] purchased brother Dan sister onette one
[1:31:34] of them bought a whole bunch of them got
[1:31:35] it back here in my
[1:31:37] refrigerator so they paid whatever the
[1:31:40] price was for all those things to keep
[1:31:43] me
[1:31:45] hydrated but if I wish to I can pour it
[1:31:48] out on top his carpet sister nette
[1:31:51] wouldn't like it very much
[1:31:54] but I all when you purchase something it
[1:31:58] is
[1:31:59] yours right so if I want to take it and
[1:32:03] throw it up against the wall and just
[1:32:04] bust it everywhere and splatter all over
[1:32:06] the wall if I want to take it outside
[1:32:08] and pour it down a drain it's
[1:32:14] mine oh but I find it so hard to
[1:32:16] understand then the Christians that
[1:32:18] belong to him and he tells them I don't
[1:32:21] want you doing this I don't want you
[1:32:23] doing that well who are you to tell me
[1:32:24] what to do you're asking the wrong
[1:32:27] person the wrong question you should be
[1:32:30] asking yourself who am I to tell the
[1:32:32] purchaser what he can and cannot do with
[1:32:34] me I don't belong to myself but I wonder
[1:32:36] how many of us here tonight really
[1:32:38] believe that that we do not belong to
[1:32:41] oursel we are purchased by the kid we
[1:32:44] don't have a choice well I I I I think
[1:32:46] that I I would like to you know I'd like
[1:32:49] to go out here in the word and I'd like
[1:32:50] to do a little bit of this that and
[1:32:51] other no no that's not the way it is we
[1:32:54] are bought he paid for us he paid the
[1:32:57] price now this again is what separates
[1:32:59] the bride from the church in that the
[1:33:01] church does not follow in this same line
[1:33:04] of redemption Redemption means to buy
[1:33:07] back the church world is not bought back
[1:33:12] they are John
[1:33:14] 3:16 they are given a chance to be saved
[1:33:19] and saved they will be but the
[1:33:23] Redemption
[1:33:25] the
[1:33:25] Redemption is only for those who were
[1:33:29] part of his thinking before the world
[1:33:32] ever
[1:33:33] began therefore he could buy back the
[1:33:37] elect and buy them in that personal
[1:33:41] possession stage and they actually have
[1:33:44] no problem with it they don't get mad
[1:33:47] and say huh I can't believe you you f
[1:33:49] around and bought me what you going to
[1:33:50] do you going to treat me like I'm a
[1:33:51] piece of garbage or something like that
[1:33:53] you going to tell me I can't do this and
[1:33:54] I can't go there and I can't do this I
[1:33:56] can't do something else you want me to
[1:33:57] pray about everything I do you want me
[1:33:59] to pray about what church I go to you
[1:34:01] want me to pray about what job I should
[1:34:03] take you want me to pray about the woman
[1:34:05] I should marry you better pray about
[1:34:06] that brother glory to God not only
[1:34:08] brother but you sister better pray about
[1:34:10] it too that's right because some God
[1:34:12] gives us these things in life but he
[1:34:14] wants us to seek his wisdom and his
[1:34:17] understanding why he placed us here to
[1:34:20] serve his purpose and he bought us
[1:34:27] right now I know I'm weird okay y'all
[1:34:30] can nod your head that you agree with me
[1:34:32] some of you think I am you
[1:34:35] see I cannot go to church where I want
[1:34:39] to that's right that's right I have to
[1:34:43] go to church where God puts me that's
[1:34:47] right
[1:34:49] amen thank you Lord but I find that so
[1:34:52] weird the way that people look at
[1:34:55] it cuz people look at it I'm going to
[1:34:58] church where I want to
[1:35:02] go well either that speaks one of two
[1:35:04] things to me either you're not purchased
[1:35:08] or he's mean to me
[1:35:12] right people say well I don't like a big
[1:35:14] church I don't
[1:35:16] either right so I guess I don't have to
[1:35:18] come anymore
[1:35:19] right my preference would be a much
[1:35:22] smaller Church my preference would be I
[1:35:24] was not on the internet not on YouTube
[1:35:27] Instagram none of that stuff just do
[1:35:29] away every bit of it that's my
[1:35:31] preference my preference would be that
[1:35:33] Hardy nobody around the world would ever
[1:35:35] know me that way they wouldn't shoot at
[1:35:36] me so often and I Pastor a little small
[1:35:39] Church remember I came from a small
[1:35:41] Church in Kentucky my preference is not
[1:35:44] a big
[1:35:46] church so people don't come here because
[1:35:48] they don't like a big church so that
[1:35:49] works for me too
[1:35:51] right no come on be honest you you will
[1:35:55] not let me have the same choices you
[1:35:57] think you can make because you're
[1:36:02] unjust
[1:36:04] Hallelujah Jesus didn't want to die but
[1:36:08] he did Jesus didn't want to go to hell
[1:36:11] but he did Jesus didn't want to have to
[1:36:14] become our sin but he did and I'm so
[1:36:17] glad he did aren't you so what was it he
[1:36:21] was the very attribute of God self
[1:36:24] sacrifice he was the attribute of God
[1:36:28] sacrificing himself and then when we are
[1:36:32] purchased it's not like well I want to I
[1:36:34] want I want I want I want no
[1:36:38] way you see that's the lot
[1:36:42] type not the Abraham
[1:36:46] type there will be not one
[1:36:50] individual in the bride
[1:36:53] that does not live a self-denying
[1:36:58] self-sacrificing
[1:37:01] life arrogance selfishness promotion of
[1:37:06] self will never make the bride
[1:37:09] call amen why it would match the
[1:37:15] husband can I go a little
[1:37:18] further 1 Corinthians 6:20 for ye are
[1:37:22] bought
[1:37:24] with a
[1:37:25] price
[1:37:26] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:37:32] in your
[1:37:34] spirit which
[1:37:40] are
[1:37:41] Gods so Christians are bought and the
[1:37:45] price has been paid by right of
[1:37:50] purchase he can designate them to be
[1:37:53] whatever he wants them to be that's
[1:37:57] right so if he wants somebody to be a
[1:37:59] preacher he don't even have to ask him
[1:38:02] hey I was thinking about making your
[1:38:04] preacher what do you think I can tell
[1:38:06] you what I told him I can tell you
[1:38:08] whatever God called man told him there's
[1:38:10] some that wants to preach and he never
[1:38:11] called them in the first place but I
[1:38:13] ain't never met a god call man that
[1:38:15] wanted to do it Prophet said it's them
[1:38:17] that don't want to do it they're the one
[1:38:18] running from it that's the god call man
[1:38:21] so he called me to preach
[1:38:23] and didn't even ask me if I wanted to
[1:38:26] and that in h the story he ain't even
[1:38:28] asked me after 40 years well almost 50
[1:38:32] 50 now he ain't even asked me after that
[1:38:34] hey how you like it you want to
[1:38:35] reconsider what about another vocation
[1:38:38] there'd be some other Fell's name on
[1:38:39] that sign out there if he asked me that
[1:38:42] you know why cuz he knows what we do so
[1:38:45] he said I'm not even asking you you're a
[1:38:48] preaching I said what wait a minute that
[1:38:49] ain't fair I don't want to be a preacher
[1:38:52] I don't like I don't like preaching I
[1:38:53] don't like reading I hated homework when
[1:38:56] I was in school hated it I didn't like
[1:38:59] reading yeah y'all think that's funny
[1:39:00] don't you I didn't like reading I hardly
[1:39:03] ever brought homework home I would miss
[1:39:05] break at school and stay in and do my
[1:39:08] homework cuz I did not like homework
[1:39:11] isn't that amazing and now I have
[1:39:13] homework every day of my life but it
[1:39:15] ain't mass and all that sort of thing
[1:39:17] it's studying God's word did not like to
[1:39:19] read for
[1:39:21] nothing oh no I didn't like to read I'd
[1:39:24] just go ahead and read it wasn't that I
[1:39:26] struggle with it I just didn't like
[1:39:27] doing it I taught myself how to speed
[1:39:29] read so I would be able to read man bam
[1:39:31] bam bam bam I can still do it read very
[1:39:33] very fast and catch a great accumulative
[1:39:35] amount of knowledge out of doing it but
[1:39:37] you know what God Said I day what old
[1:39:39] boy you think you're going to get out of
[1:39:41] reading you ain't you're going to be a
[1:39:43] preacher said I don't want to be no
[1:39:44] preacher you

[1:39:55] ministry Apostles prophets teachers
[1:39:58] evangelist pastors okay I'm going to
[1:40:01] make you preach I'm going to compromise
[1:40:04] with you which one do you want to
[1:40:10] be and you folks think you can choose
[1:40:12] about anything you want when it comes to
[1:40:17] God boy God's been really mean to a lot
[1:40:20] of us

[1:40:47] the lumber to make the handrails and all

[1:41:07] Walnut

[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:13] beaten as a matter of fact they've been
[1:41:15] some visiting preachers they parent
[1:41:16] apparently they got watches on their
[1:41:18] arms or Rings or something and they've
[1:41:20] beat the fire out of this thing already
[1:41:26] and yet that wood had no say we
[1:41:28] purchased it we could have burned it if
[1:41:31] we so
[1:41:33] desired but
[1:41:35] instead look at what it was turned
[1:41:40] into so he purchased
[1:41:45] us and he spends years wooing us drawing
[1:41:50] us breaking down our wh
[1:41:54] not making us now he don't want to take
[1:41:56] his belt off his W say all right Donnie

[1:43:43] your
[1:43:45] family you belong to God first amen then
[1:43:49] your family and all of
[1:43:51] that and the order is
[1:43:54] this God's Prophet said you put God
[1:43:57] first your family
[1:44:00] second you
[1:44:07] last of course a lot of folks have taken
[1:44:10] care of that they just simply
[1:44:16] go well that was easy wasn't it man a Al
[1:44:18] wasn't that
[1:44:20] something but action you make it harder
[1:44:22] on you
[1:44:23] yes harder on your family harder on your
[1:44:26] church
[1:44:28] family so actually the easiest and best
[1:44:30] way
[1:44:33] is God your family and
[1:44:38] you don't you love
[1:44:41] him let's
[1:44:46] stand praise the
[1:44:50] Lord listen this he your himm you're
[1:44:53] born again then you're a son and
[1:44:54] daughter of God it's a regeneration a
[1:44:56] new creation then your attributes your
[1:44:58] thoughts are not like they were your
[1:45:01] life is not like it was you're a
[1:45:03] complete surrendered vessel to God
[1:45:07] complete surrendered vessel to God and
[1:45:11] he speaks and uses you you're not your
[1:45:15] own no
[1:45:16] more your bought was a price that's the
[1:45:20] price of the precious blood
[1:45:24] of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:26] Christ again he says you're bought and
[1:45:28] you're not your
[1:45:30] own but you're bought with the price of
[1:45:33] the precious blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:45:35] you're not your own wonder why he keeps
[1:45:38] repeating
[1:45:39] this I guess so we'll get
[1:45:43] it to throw your life away and to live
[1:45:47] the way you
[1:45:48] do you have no legal rights
[1:45:53] to take that life that Christ has
[1:45:58] bought and sell it out to the
[1:46:01] devil you have no
[1:46:04] rights of doing
[1:46:09] it so he made a way that every
[1:46:13] drunk could be set free every drug drug
[1:46:17] addict ever whatever vile wretched
[1:46:19] sinner that they are but instead
[1:46:23] they take that life that he bought he
[1:46:25] bought
[1:46:26] all of mankind now think of it friends
[1:46:30] it's not just people that profess
[1:46:31] Christianity all Lays before him and the
[1:46:35] price was
[1:46:37] paid so for those of you who look at
[1:46:39] reprobation and you feel like God is
[1:46:41] unjust he is not unjust at all he bought
[1:46:46] them
[1:46:50] all so look at Humanity as a great great
[1:46:53] great Potter's
[1:46:56] field and the Potter reaches down over
[1:46:59] here and forms an
[1:47:02] Abraham he reaches over here in the
[1:47:04] penny
[1:47:06] pile and forms a
[1:47:08] lot reaches back over here and forms an
[1:47:14] Isaac reaches back over here and forms
[1:47:18] an
[1:47:20] esel reaches over here a Jacob over here
[1:47:26] a
[1:47:27] Canaan on and on why he bought the whole
[1:47:36] thing I'll tell you one thing we ought
[1:47:38] to just be so
[1:47:40] grateful that he put his hands in our
[1:47:43] lives shaped us mold
[1:47:46] us my
[1:47:49] goodness how many needs a revelation of
[1:47:51] this tonight that you are not your
[1:47:54] own you belong to God look for so for
[1:47:58] you to sing I I can do with what I want

[1:48:17] God my life belongs to God but it's
[1:48:22] amazing how people look and
[1:48:24] differentiate between Ministry and lat

[1:52:19] of them would rather we had a church
[1:52:23] about a third or less the size that we

[1:52:54] carries I'll leave this place one of

[1:54:06] type of
[1:54:08] things but Lord
[1:54:11] I've I've fallen short of your glory and
[1:54:15] ways totally different from
[1:54:19] that I don't like being in the spotlight
[1:54:23] I don't like being looked
[1:54:25] at I don't like being before a
[1:54:29] crowd you know how many times I go to

[1:54:33] office one trip after another after
[1:54:36] another CU I'm so nervous I can't hardly
[1:54:38] stand

[1:54:42] I'm going to have to stand before a
[1:54:44] group of
[1:54:45] people I don't like that nervous
[1:54:49] feeling it puts me in such a spot when
[1:54:52] people are needing counsel and advice
[1:54:55] and they're asking me for
[1:54:57] answers serious important things
[1:55:01] Lord it makes me so
[1:55:04] nervous and I counsel sometimes for two
[1:55:08] and 3 hours at a time and when I get
[1:55:09] home I'll tell Carol my throat is so
[1:55:12] sore I can hardly
[1:55:17] swallow Lord each one of us here tonight
[1:55:19] could say well I have to do this and I
[1:55:21] have to do that
[1:55:23] but forgive us for all that
[1:55:27] complaining Lord help us to realize we
[1:55:30] don't belong to
[1:55:32] oursel my voice is not mine my strength
[1:55:36] is not
[1:55:37] mine I don't have a choice in the
[1:55:42] sense of whether I preach at a big
[1:55:44] church a little church a mediumsized
[1:55:47] church I belong to
[1:55:50] you if you want to you can move me from
[1:55:53] here and send me to a little jungle back
[1:55:55] in Africa and start with one or two
[1:55:58] heathens in in a
[1:56:00] hut cuz I'm
[1:56:03] yours and I belong to
[1:56:06] you but Lord we don't want to just be
[1:56:09] able to confess that and say okay do
[1:56:11] whatever you
[1:56:12] want but we want to do it
[1:56:15] willingly so we want to be what we are
[1:56:18] be what you made us to be with all of
[1:56:22] our
[1:56:24] Hearts my wife does not want to have to
[1:56:27] force me to tell her that I love her I
[1:56:31] don't want to have to ask her please
[1:56:33] tell me please tell me please tell
[1:56:37] me neither do you want us to have to be
[1:56:41] begged to say we love
[1:56:44] you and that we want to give everything
[1:56:46] we are to
[1:56:49] you Boaz took Ruth
[1:56:53] a
[1:56:55] moabitas and
[1:56:57] changed her
[1:57:01] life she became the great
[1:57:04] grandmother of King
[1:57:07] David she
[1:57:10] became one of the
[1:57:12] matrons of our Lord Jesus
[1:57:16] Christ took her from being a moabitas
[1:57:21] one which is not even allowed in the
[1:57:23] presence of God for 400 years law kept
[1:57:27] her out but Grace brought her
[1:57:32] in
[1:57:33] Hallelujah I wonder how many times she
[1:57:36] read that in the Torah for Thou shalt
[1:57:39] not marry a
[1:57:41] moabitas or one of Moab shall not be
[1:57:44] allowed in the congregation of the Lord
[1:57:47] for 10
[1:57:49] Generations wonder she would feel really
[1:57:52] strange when she would read that and it
[1:57:55] seems like the word was putting her out
[1:57:58] but all she knew was Grace got a hold of
[1:58:02] her life
[1:58:05] hallelu Lord God we're so grateful that
[1:58:07] our mistakes and our failures and our
[1:58:10] shortcomings they might want to try to
