[41:08] brother Joe taking the service and um
[41:11] the Lord helped us up up in Virginia
[41:13] brother Timothy and brother Tim did an
[41:15] awesome job that other guy y'all know
[41:18] how I feel about him I don't care much
[41:20] about him he's never been one of my
[41:23] favorite preachers you know uh I don't
[41:25] like him and he really don't like me but
[41:28] anyway but the anyway the other two
[41:31] brothers done a really good job really
[41:33] good job we so so enjoyed being there
[41:35] with them Fellowship of the Lord um
[41:39] let's turn to Jeremiah tonight chapter 5
[41:42] verse 24 if you would Lord willing
[41:45] tomorrow night we'll be having question
[41:46] answers for our youth of course we'll be
[41:48] streaming for those of you that are too
[41:51] old to meet the age
[41:54] limit I believe it'll be a blessing to
[41:57] you you just pray for us that the Lord
[41:59] will help us and be with us and I know
[42:03] you're praying for the needs of um uh
[42:07] our church family several different ones
[42:09] going through some pretty difficult
[42:11] times right now we're just asking for
[42:14] the mercy of God and the miraculous of
[42:17] God yeah some still recovering from
[42:20] covid and this and that and the other so
[42:23] just keep them on your heart if you
[42:26] would we know that our God Specializes
[42:29] in Supernatural things does he know as a
[42:32] matter of fact I shared a quote with
[42:33] brother Tim and brother Ron the other
[42:35] day where the Prophet talked about
[42:39] omnipotence when omnipotence speaks the
[42:43] miraculous
[42:45] happens it has to he said when
[42:48] omnipotent speak so when two
[42:52] omnipotence join together you know who
[42:55] those two are you you and God oh my I
[43:00] didn't say that I'm just repeating what
[43:02] the messenger said when those two join
[43:04] together oh my what can happen so we
[43:08] believe it right we believe our God can
[43:10] do it Jeremiah chapter 5:
[43:14] 24 neither say they in their
[43:18] heart let us now fear the lord Our God
[43:22] that give us rain both the
[43:25] former and the latter rain in his
[43:29] season he reserve unto us the appointed
[43:34] weeks of
[43:36] harvest Hosea
[43:38] 6:3 then shall we know if we follow on
[43:42] to know the Lord his going forth is
[43:46] prepared as the
[43:49] morning and
[43:51] he shall come unto us as the rain
[43:57] as the latter and former Reign unto the
[44:01] earth now what a strange thing that
[44:03] Hosea says that the
[44:06] Lord will actually come as a latter and
[44:11] the former ring
[44:13] together now if you've been looking at
[44:15] any of this and if you've looked in the
[44:18] message you probably have run across
[44:20] this already that the prophet also
[44:24] likened the former Reign to the
[44:27] Apostles and he likened the latter Reign
[44:32] to the restoration of the apostolic
[44:35] Doctrine and the coming of the Lord
[44:38] Jesus the merging of the former which
[44:42] was the apostolic teaching and the
[44:45] presence of the Lord Jesus himself Joel
[44:49] 2:23 be glad then you children of Zion
[44:53] and
[44:55] rejoice in the Lord
[44:57] your
[44:58] God how many believes we ought to
[45:00] rejoice in the Lord yes sir does anybody
[45:02] know of any Scripture where the Bible
[45:04] says be
[45:06] sad in the Lord your God be
[45:10] mournful be depressed in the Lord your
[45:13] God no it doesn't say it does it but it
[45:17] says rejoice in the Lord your God for he
[45:21] has given you the former Reign
[45:25] moderately and he will cause to come
[45:27] down for you the rain the former rain
[45:32] and the latter rain in the first month
[45:36] of course the word former there in the
[45:38] Hebrew is Mor which means
[45:43] teaching so God will cause the teaching
[45:46] Reign to come and then he will cause the
[45:51] latter rain to come which will produce
[45:54] or finish the crop I believe we're in
[45:57] that hour amen I me' like to be
[46:00] remembered today want to say how happy
[46:02] we are to see brother Wade and sister
[46:04] Anna back in service with us tonight

[47:33] father we're also asking you tonight for
[47:35] your nation Israel you see where they

[47:44] every side and seems like that the
[47:47] leaders of the nation no matter what
[47:49] decisions they make that it cannot be
[47:52] the right one but we pray that you'd be
[47:54] mindful of them tonight father I'm also
[47:57] asking you Lord for brother Dwight Hall
[48:01] many of our people know brother Dwight
[48:03] he's come and sang for us and been a
[48:05] blessing to many people around the
[48:08] message and brother Daryl had mentioned
[48:10] to me that he' been sick before the
[48:12] service so I text him and his his heart
[48:15] function got down to about 15% he said
[48:18] and uh fluid and is still in the
[48:21] hospital and Lord he requested that we
[48:24] would pray together so Lord God we bring
[48:27] our brother to you tonight in the name
[48:31] of Jesus may this leave his body Satan
[48:35] you are a liar you are defeated go from
[48:39] our brother in the name of Jesus Christ
[48:43] speak to us tonight father your word we
[48:46] ask in the name of the Living Word the
[48:49] Lord Jesus and the saints of God said
[48:52] amen amen God bless you you may be
[48:55] seated so glad to see you tonight I
[48:59] always enjoy going out and preaching at
[49:01] other churches and being with other
[49:03] people but I always enjoy home ain't no
[49:06] place like home are they I so appreciate
[49:09] each of you love you with all my
[49:11] heart uh I I believe that we are living
[49:15] in the Harvest cycle of the end time and
[49:20] we know that truly this is not the first
[49:23] end time but it's the only one quite
[49:27] like this there was an end time in the
[49:30] anti luian destruction there was an end
[49:33] time in 557 BC whenever Nebuchadnezzar
[49:37] had come in and carried the children of
[49:39] Israel captive there's been several
[49:42] different end times under the Persian
[49:45] Kingdom as well and under the time of
[49:48] the macbes under the time of the Romans
[49:51] and it would end an era or a
[49:54] dispensation but we believe that we are
[49:57] living in an end time which is totally
[50:00] different than any that's ever been on
[50:02] the earth before because after every one
[50:05] of those errors there was a rising or a
[50:10] Reviving again and people would regroup
[50:14] and people would have a Revival and God
[50:17] would do great things for them and then
[50:19] they would go back into that cycle again
[50:23] but we believe that we're at the end to
[50:25] where there is no re Revival from this
[50:28] one here as a matter of fact one day The
[50:31] Mercy Seat will become Smoky and the
[50:34] blood will be lifted and the purchase of
[50:37] the blood will be taken from the earth
[50:40] and when that happens we know there'll
[50:42] be no more Gentiles that'll be saved
[50:45] alas they'll still make alter calls
[50:48] it'll be some of the biggest alter calls
[50:50] the world has ever seen people will be
[50:54] screaming and crying it will will break
[50:57] force and what Many religious people
[51:00] will deem to be one of the greatest
[51:03] revivals the world has ever known but
[51:06] not one of them will actually be getting
[51:09] saved because The Mercy Seat is vacated
[51:14] so if you want to be saved and you want
[51:16] to be in you better get in while the
[51:18] getting's good because it won't be long
[51:21] the door of Mercy will be
[51:23] closed and we know that every thing that
[51:27] we are seeing and what is in the future
[51:31] yet to be comes from previous seed times
[51:37] that have been upon the earth now we
[51:39] know that from reading in the Book of
[51:41] Genesis and we can see from the way that
[51:44] God caught Moses back into that
[51:47] revelated spot where he was and he wrote
[51:51] and said in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning
[51:54] God created the heavens and the Earth
[51:57] period and then in verse two and the
[52:00] Earth was without form and void and
[52:04] darkness covered the face of the deep
[52:06] and the spirit of God moved upon there
[52:09] and God said let there be light and
[52:12] there was light but there was a great
[52:15] span of time that had taken place
[52:18] between verse one and verse two and we
[52:21] can see by what what Jeremiah described
[52:25] and Ezekiel in in a faint way that there
[52:29] was something that had come upon the
[52:31] Earth and had brought a darkness and a
[52:34] chaos God never leaves anything by
[52:37] creation in such a state so we know that
[52:40] something had happened a pre-adamite
[52:43] world to where that Lucifer had come
[52:46] down on the earth and and wanted to have
[52:49] this earth that is his own possession
[52:52] and then the prophet said when God said
[52:54] let there be light he said I do do not
[52:56] believe that the Sun the moon and the
[52:59] stars come into existence when he said
[53:02] that but they were already in existence
[53:05] but God simply drove back the darkness
[53:08] that had come upon the Earth So what had
[53:11] brought the darkness upon the Earth that
[53:14] had hidden what God had created so God
[53:17] had already created the Sun the moon the
[53:19] stars and the universe and every said uh
[53:22] created the heavens and the Earth and
[53:24] then something had come upon and a
[53:27] Darkness overshadowed the Earth and it
[53:29] kept the moon the Sun and all all the
[53:32] universal lights from being able to
[53:35] penetrate on the earth so God simply
[53:37] said let there be light or in other
[53:39] words Let There Be The Darkness that
[53:42] will draw itself together in phases and
[53:46] then God call the light day and the
[53:49] Darkness he called night so when God
[53:52] gave the darkness a name and he gave the
[53:56] the light a name if you notice he
[53:58] doesn't call the light Sun or the light
[54:01] moon or the light stars but he calls the
[54:04] light day and he calls the darkness
[54:08] night so he's
[54:10] dispensation giving it a Time by which
[54:13] you'll know and be able to divide it so
[54:16] when you look out and you see the sun
[54:18] then you can know what well it's
[54:20] daylight it's daytime when you look out
[54:23] you see the moon and the stars you know
[54:25] that it is not
[54:26] how do you know that by the measure of
[54:29] the light that is being shined so God
[54:32] then was showing a pattern in that he
[54:35] was writing his future forecast of the
[54:39] Bible and the prophet said whenever God
[54:42] begin to bring them seeds out I believe
[54:46] that those seeds he said were laying
[54:48] there from some former or some previous
[54:53] civilization so where was that from had
[54:56] already made that now aons of Ages prior
[55:00] to verse two and then the spirit of God
[55:03] simply caused the darkness to congeal
[55:06] together and separate the light from the
[55:09] day and then God drove the waters back
[55:12] because the waters had covered over the
[55:14] face of the Earth and what God was doing
[55:16] was riding out the shadow of your
[55:19] election and he said it's a type third
[55:22] seal a type of the human being so God
[55:25] didn't actually put them seeds there
[55:27] they were already there and the Darkness
[55:30] and the the the M moisture and the vapor
[55:34] that was upon the face of the Earth the
[55:36] seeds could not grow there was no light
[55:38] for it to be able to penetrate so God by
[55:41] his spoken word separated light from
[55:43] Darkness separated wet from dry and then
[55:46] God be to humidify the Earth and bring
[55:50] the the earth into where the expanse of
[55:52] the water and God Drew part of it up
[55:55] this way and part of it God gathered in
[55:57] The Fountains of the deep so God began
[56:00] to drain the Earth and then he brought
[56:02] it up here in this great expanse to be
[56:05] used later and he would call it vapor
[56:08] and moisture and then he would create
[56:10] this other and he would cause great
[56:12] drains off the face of the Earth and it
[56:15] would be this great Fountains of the
[56:16] deep which would be held in reserve for
[56:19] the an delu and destruction so God
[56:22] separated and what he did automatically
[56:25] then those seeds that were laying there
[56:28] they began to grow and they took off so
[56:31] that was a type of you and I now
[56:34] whenever then God started right there in
[56:36] the Book of Genesis so Genesis is the
[56:39] seed book or seed chapter of the entire
[56:41] Bible so everything God's going to do is
[56:44] mirrored from Genesis so if we are
[56:47] living in the last day of the Harvest
[56:50] cycle then we know there had to be a
[56:53] sewing cycle just makes sense right
[56:56] so whenever we sewed this field right
[56:59] over here and brother Aaron and the
[57:02] brothers that worked for him and they
[57:03] got out there and they sewed and sewed
[57:06] way up into the around midnight hours
[57:08] and they sewed and sewed and then it
[57:10] come some rain and there was some of the
[57:12] seed that didn't come up some of it
[57:14] washed away so I started going over
[57:17] there and buying hundreds and hundreds
[57:20] of pounds of Kentucky 31 Fescue and I
[57:24] started sewing and sewing and and sewing
[57:27] and then we go into the dry spot of
[57:29] Summer and it looked as if though almost
[57:32] all of that seed that I SED that none of
[57:36] it would live some of it come up and it
[57:39] died back I sewed this bank over here
[57:42] this one back here I've sold all over
[57:44] everywhere cuz I hate bare spots and I
[57:46] hate be spots in Christians lives
[57:50] because I know they got fertile ground
[57:52] and if I can keep raking it and sewing
[57:55] it then embarassed spots in your life I
[57:58] want to look out there and see you
[58:00] totally covered
[58:01] over cuz you got spots there it's
[58:04] fertile ground in your life but it can
[58:07] be more than fertile ground it can bring
[58:09] forth what the seed wants it to be you
[58:12] understand so I thought by looking at
[58:15] this field over here that most of that
[58:18] seed that I had planted was totally
[58:20] wasted but I've sewed grass seed for a
[58:22] long long time and I know it can lay
[58:25] there and seemingly nothing happened to
[58:28] it but whenever we started getting the
[58:30] rains back a month or so ago and what I
[58:34] noticed was and I was over here today
[58:37] and Seed some more back over here
[58:38] yesterday and I noticed that a lot of
[58:42] those seeds that I'd sewn actually come
[58:46] up now it seemed as if though there
[58:49] wasn't going to do it but what I
[58:52] realized was those seeds had laid there
[58:55] dormant
[58:56] now they were dormant because the proper
[58:59] amount of moisture had not germinated
[59:02] them and they would lay there so I found
[59:04] it out years ago if you can sew the seed
[59:08] high enough even if it washes it'll work
[59:11] its way down and some of it will Lodge
[59:14] here and there and there and the fils
[59:17] for sure will come and pick some of it
[59:20] up but all it takes is for it to be able
[59:22] to Lodge just a little bit and if it
[59:25] gets enough moisture it will germinate
[59:29] and it'll come forth y'all ought to be
[59:31] shouting I preached about you just then
[59:35] now the devil thought some of you all
[59:36] were helpless and hopeless and maybe you
[59:39] thought you were too but God knew there
[59:41] was a seed there that was laying dormant
[59:44] and if it could get you under the right
[59:46] ministry under the right atmosphere and
[59:49] the right church and the right
[59:51] environment where the spirit of God was
[59:53] moving he knew that you'd come forth for
[59:56] and bring force in this
[59:58] hour now it's the same with what God had
[1:00:01] to do in the age to where it was a great
[1:00:06] seed time now there were three main
[1:00:09] planters that was on the earth in the
[1:00:13] era behind where where we are right now
[1:00:17] now for some of our Elder people here
[1:00:19] they were alive during this era that I
[1:00:22] wish to speak about tonight which was in
[1:00:24] the 40s 50s and 60s and tapered on out
[1:00:28] around the 70s and there was one main
[1:00:32] head planter that main head planter in
[1:00:37] the religious realm was Billy Graham now
[1:00:41] Billy Graham was a great head planter
[1:00:44] now don't look funny at me because I've
[1:00:46] got a quote that says this so Billy
[1:00:49] Graham was the head planter now Oral
[1:00:53] Roberts was also a another planter but
[1:00:57] he was sewing a different type of seed
[1:01:01] to a different type of people and then
[1:01:05] there was
[1:01:07] Elijah now watch the prophet said
[1:01:10] there's been three different kinds of
[1:01:12] seeds planted a denomination will be the
[1:01:16] Graham he was a head planter or Roberts
[1:01:19] for the Pentecostal Pentecostal seeds
[1:01:23] been planted isn't that amazing that
[1:01:25] brother Brandon does not identify
[1:01:27] himself as
[1:01:29] sewing Pentecostal
[1:01:33] sea brother bham was not the SE of ausa
[1:01:39] seat isusa Street
[1:01:43] seed he was the S of the
[1:01:47] restoration of the original
[1:01:50] Pentecost now notice he does not
[1:01:52] identify himself as being the planter of
[1:01:57] the isusa street style of seed that was
[1:02:01] Oral Roberts Oral Roberts for the
[1:02:05] Pentecostal Pentecostal seeds been
[1:02:07] planted I'm talking about organization
[1:02:10] now and then the words been planted on
[1:02:15] down in this same paragraph here he said
[1:02:18] seeds must be planted then the water
[1:02:21] falls to water the sea now we're hearing
[1:02:25] so much he says about uh many
[1:02:28] organizations and everything else they
[1:02:30] talk about and we're in the lighter
[1:02:34] rain
[1:02:37] nonsense we're in the latter
[1:02:41] rain
[1:02:43] nonsense now what's absolutely amazing
[1:02:46] is that brother brandom
[1:02:47] himself in the 50s and on up to
[1:02:52] 1960 said the light of rain was falling
[1:02:57] now you see this is one of the things a
[1:02:59] lot of the message folks have absolutely
[1:03:01] hated about me is that I see that
[1:03:06] brother brandham allowed
[1:03:08] God to let him
[1:03:11] grow and change in certain things of
[1:03:15] what he believed now if you make him God
[1:03:18] then of course you can't believe that
[1:03:19] but that also makes you an
[1:03:21] idolator and that means that deity demon
[1:03:25] has got a hold to
[1:03:26] you you remember that snake that he
[1:03:29] stood in the middle of and struck it and
[1:03:32] you remember that demon was so powerful
[1:03:35] that it bit
[1:03:36] him but the blood was so rich it
[1:03:40] wouldn't take effect it wasn't Brandon
[1:03:43] blood it's evident it was Jesus
[1:03:46] blood can you imagine a man that deity
[1:03:50] spirit being so strong if any of us if
[1:03:53] anybody knows our weakness and our
[1:03:56] mistakes it's us but that deity devil
[1:03:59] was so strong that it even actually
[1:04:04] attacked the prophet if anybody would
[1:04:07] know his Humanity it was him but what
[1:04:10] kept Him from it the blood of the Lord
[1:04:13] Jesus Brandon blood ain't rich raikan
[1:04:16] blood ain't Rich come on somebody
[1:04:19] Smith's blood or whatever your name is
[1:04:22] our blood ain't no good but the blood of
[1:04:24] Jesus will keep us from that deity devil
[1:04:29] well praise the Lord now watch what what
[1:04:32] he goes on to say now remember this is
[1:04:35] spoken words Original Seed
[1:04:38] 1962 it is over a 6 hour
[1:04:43] sermon he goes into the Tabernacle and
[1:04:46] he starts on Sunday morning and he
[1:04:49] preaches for several hours then he and
[1:04:53] the people break they go have lunch and
[1:04:57] they come back he picks up where he left
[1:05:00] off and he preached for several more
[1:05:04] hours wound up being over a 6-hour
[1:05:09] sermon now if you haven't listened to it
[1:05:11] in a long time it do you good I know
[1:05:14] most of us we ain't got enough patience
[1:05:17] to sit down and listen to No six-h hour
[1:05:19] sermon but if you got to break it up do
[1:05:22] it you'll get a lot out of it I
[1:05:24] guarantee you
[1:05:26] now it's so amazing because when he
[1:05:30] starts preaching this God actually lets
[1:05:34] him move into the realm of vision while
[1:05:39] he's preaching it so while he's
[1:05:42] preaching a vision starts passing before
[1:05:46] his eyes now I know it's unusual for
[1:05:49] most of us I've only had a few Visions
[1:05:51] in my life and I I wouldn't called to
[1:05:53] live in that realm and I'm sure most of
[1:05:55] you were not but even though he was it
[1:05:59] still just alarmed him when it would
[1:06:02] happen now watch he himself would not
[1:06:07] become so set in his ways that he could
[1:06:11] not preach something and then allow God
[1:06:15] to further his understanding and his
[1:06:18] Revelation now check me out on this I
[1:06:20] want you to I expect you to and you
[1:06:23] looking 56 you're looking 5 9 you look
[1:06:26] in 60 and brother R says that the
[1:06:29] lighter rain is pouring out right now
[1:06:31] it's falling right now but whenever God
[1:06:35] starts dealing with him about this seed
[1:06:37] time and harvest and then he makes this
[1:06:40] comment that were in the lighter rain
[1:06:44] nonsense no such a thing something's
[1:06:48] happening now watch here he breaks into
[1:06:52] Vision so he's preaching and then all of
[1:06:55] us sudden this Vision starts happening
[1:06:58] he said something's
[1:07:00] happening I can just see it passing
[1:07:03] before me it's I I it's done caught the
[1:07:08] spirit you already hear him on tape
[1:07:09] Caroline I heard this the other day as
[1:07:11] we were coming home from the meetings in
[1:07:13] Virginia he said done CAU the spirit
[1:07:16] amen I I know this is the
[1:07:20] truth it's thus saith the Lord
[1:07:26] by
[1:07:28] Vision just
[1:07:30] moving and coming now remember now now
[1:07:34] we have Vision I know it makes it so
[1:07:38] difficult for people because you know
[1:07:40] they look at the message of the hour
[1:07:41] they land no progression they do not
[1:07:44] allow the prophet to be able to grow in
[1:07:46] his understanding and so on so they look
[1:07:48] and say well he said this year and he
[1:07:50] said that well of course he was a man
[1:07:52] just like the rest of us just like the
[1:07:54] prophet when he stood there and told the
[1:07:56] king he's going to die that's all he
[1:07:58] knew how to do thus said the Lord set
[1:08:00] your house in order you're going to die
[1:08:01] and not live and the spirit of God heard
[1:08:04] that King's cry you remember it in the
[1:08:06] Bible and what did he do God stopped him
[1:08:08] out on the outer Court turned him right
[1:08:10] back around and go and go back in thus
[1:08:12] sayith the Lord you going to live well
[1:08:14] which one of them is
[1:08:17] right come on somebody prophets can only
[1:08:20] say what they see at the time that's all
[1:08:22] they know how to do and then whenever
[1:08:25] God will give them further understanding
[1:08:27] than they can do it I can personally
[1:08:29] follow a man like that I cannot follow
[1:08:33] the man-made William brandham that
[1:08:36] people in this message have made because
[1:08:39] they make him without fault they make
[1:08:41] him without flaw that is not the William
[1:08:44] brandom that he himself projected come
[1:08:47] on somebody he was just like Moses he
[1:08:50] was just like Jeremiah he was just like
[1:08:53] Ezekiel come on he was a human being and
[1:08:58] he was man enough to stand up and tell
[1:09:00] us when he was wrong and when he
[1:09:03] preached this differently than that oh
[1:09:05] yeah I can follow a man like that so
[1:09:08] many how many preachers today will do
[1:09:11] that show many how many Talent
[1:09:13] evangelists will do that show many how
[1:09:15] many preachers in the message will even
[1:09:17] do it now but this is the type of man
[1:09:20] that God wanted to be able to use now
[1:09:23] watch so he breaks into the real
[1:09:25] a vision while he's preaching about
[1:09:28] these three seed types so he said by
[1:09:31] Vision SE just moving and coming can't
[1:09:34] hardly get looked down watch watch how
[1:09:36] his senses now are breaking because
[1:09:39] remember vision is the realm of the
[1:09:41] fourth dimension so you're partially
[1:09:44] there and yet you're partially here in
[1:09:46] time like you would have a dream and
[1:09:48] you're coming out of the dream and y'all
[1:09:49] done that have a dream and you don't
[1:09:51] know if you're asleep or you're awake
[1:09:53] and you know maybe your wife's shaking
[1:09:54] you honey wake up wake up it was a
[1:09:56] nightmare it was a nightmare so you know
[1:09:58] you don't know where you are so here he
[1:10:00] is he's standing out in the Pulpit he's
[1:10:02] preaching and he's he just he's in the
[1:10:04] vision and he's out of the vision y'
[1:10:06] ought to listen to it and just hear how
[1:10:07] he says it can't Harley looked down here
[1:10:10] every time I look I see it just moving
[1:10:13] up in front of me like that and breaking
[1:10:16] off and move this way and look this way
[1:10:20] so it was just passing right in front of
[1:10:23] him now what's going on down a bit he
[1:10:25] said all right let let's go back and try
[1:10:28] it
[1:10:29] again so while he's preaching he goes
[1:10:32] into the realm of vision and then he
[1:10:34] loses his thought of preaching oh Lord
[1:10:37] it must have been absolutely awesome and
[1:10:39] yet he he kind of going back and forth
[1:10:41] and then he regroups and the vision
[1:10:44] passes before him and then he says now
[1:10:46] let's let's let's try it again now I I
[1:10:49] I'm sure I got it in there I I don't
[1:10:52] know exactly what happened along that
[1:10:55] line
[1:10:56] I don't know exactly what happened along
[1:10:58] that line now why you say brother
[1:11:00] brandom there's been I I know right now
[1:11:03] now Watch What Happens catching your
[1:11:05] salt now you see you can't hide it now
[1:11:11] all right so be careful what you're
[1:11:16] thinking so here we have God wanted to
[1:11:20] make sure this in the spoken words
[1:11:23] Original Seed would be so accurate that
[1:11:26] he moves his Prophet into the realm of
[1:11:28] vision now most of the time when he's
[1:11:31] preaching it's two separate anointings
[1:11:33] from preaching to the realm of vision as
[1:11:36] far as seeing things but one what
[1:11:38] happened another occasion that my comes
[1:11:40] to my mind right now was that it was in
[1:11:42] maybe I don't remember if North Dakota
[1:11:44] South Dakota but it was in the 50s and
[1:11:47] he actually at the end of his sermon he
[1:11:50] preached a little bit about Adam and he
[1:11:52] saw Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden
[1:11:56] and he saw Adam come to his wife and it
[1:12:00] it it so tore him up at the end of that
[1:12:03] service and the very next night he comes
[1:12:06] back and it was so memorable to him that
[1:12:10] again he mentions it before the people
[1:12:13] and he said he saw Adam actually walk
[1:12:16] out of the Garden of Eden with his wife
[1:12:20] now most of the time it would be two
[1:12:22] separate whms but on the occasion the
[1:12:25] Lord would allow it like he did here so
[1:12:27] he would break forth from these
[1:12:29] Dimensions these first three that we all
[1:12:31] know so well and then he would break
[1:12:33] Force into the realm of the force but
[1:12:36] it's almost near the impossibility to
[1:12:37] keep your mind straight apparently I
[1:12:39] don't know cuz I ain't never been there
[1:12:41] but but it must be really hard because a
[1:12:44] part of you is leaving your senses and
[1:12:46] you're pulling away into the Heavenly
[1:12:49] realm so he had to kind of come back and
[1:12:52] you know get it together again but now
[1:12:53] watch it leaves the vision disappears
[1:12:57] before his eyes but it still leaves him
[1:13:00] partially in that realm to where people
[1:13:03] were thinking things about what he was
[1:13:06] preaching now he said you know he's
[1:13:09] preaching about the former Reign and the
[1:13:10] latter rain so we went through it last
[1:13:13] time we dealt with this how that the
[1:13:14] former rain would come for a couple of
[1:13:16] months to break up the ground because
[1:13:19] the ground was hard and crusty and dry
[1:13:22] and the former rain would fall upon the
[1:13:24] ground and soft it and moisten it up and
[1:13:27] break up the fow ground then they would
[1:13:29] plant the seed and then there would be
[1:13:31] several months of dry weather so he
[1:13:35] someone had thought this while he was
[1:13:37] preaching it and he says catching your
[1:13:40] thought now you see you just can't hide
[1:13:42] it now all right so be careful what
[1:13:45] you're thinking now the seed must be
[1:13:48] planted and then it must have water in
[1:13:50] order to grow now you say well brother
[1:13:53] brandom I'm going to express your
[1:13:57] thoughts so for those
[1:14:01] Kneads called
[1:14:03] preachers around this
[1:14:05] message that think they know more about
[1:14:08] God than God's Vindicated Prophet I'd
[1:14:12] like to tell you you're a one dumb
[1:14:16] outfit as a matter of fact you ain't got
[1:14:18] no sense even being in the
[1:14:21] Pulpit well come on somebody help me get
[1:14:24] out this hole I'm digging in now I'll
[1:14:27] tell you one thing I I I I'm totally
[1:14:30] convinced we got all kinds of preachers
[1:14:32] around this message that shouldn't be
[1:14:34] preaching a bit more than my wife should
[1:14:36] be they ain't got no business being the
[1:14:39] PO you say why would you say that
[1:14:41] because God's Prophet said question in
[1:14:43] 1961 if a man claims to be a teacher you
[1:14:46] want to know if he's called of God or
[1:14:48] not watch how he interprets the word oh
[1:14:51] my oh you've got preachers that say they
[1:14:54] believe the message and they say well
[1:14:56] and brother brandom said thus sayith the
[1:14:58] Lord I'll take it but I won't take none
[1:15:00] of the rest of it who in the world do
[1:15:03] you think you are who do you think you
[1:15:06] are that you're going to stand before
[1:15:08] Elijah oh my goodness come on somebody
[1:15:13] well I'll tell you one thing and if he
[1:15:15] said thus sayth the Lord I'll take it I
[1:15:17] doubt it I doubt it oh my but you know
[1:15:20] what if it come right down to it I would
[1:15:23] take his opinion if it was is no more
[1:15:25] than his opinion over mine or you or
[1:15:28] anyone else why because he walked in a
[1:15:32] place with God that none of us have ever
[1:15:35] been so he say well that's his idea
[1:15:38] that's his opinion well if it is I'd
[1:15:40] rather have it than mine cuz I don't
[1:15:43] figure I know too much and I know you
[1:15:45] don't if you've got that attitude it
[1:15:47] knows you've got to know it all attitude
[1:15:49] which means god ain't going to use you
[1:15:51] for
[1:15:52] nothing Well preach Brother
[1:15:56] D well I think brother Rand didn't know
[1:15:58] what he's talking about on the gifts and
[1:16:00] I think brother R didn't know what he's
[1:16:01] talking about on this and that and who
[1:16:03] are
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:09] you well praise the
[1:16:12] Lord now watch Catching your thought and
[1:16:16] this is what he's going to do now so I'm
[1:16:19] going to express your thoughts on this
[1:16:21] we've had the water he says so B so
[1:16:24] apparently somebody was sitting there
[1:16:26] thinking well what about these
[1:16:30] revivals that were being called out a
[1:16:33] ring now remember there might be an
[1:16:36] occasional shower that will pass through
[1:16:40] after the initial spring rains and the
[1:16:43] seed is laying there but that does not
[1:16:46] qualify as being called the lter rain it
[1:16:50] would be an occasional shower well we've
[1:16:52] had them in the message too how many
[1:16:54] different revivals have come up in the
[1:16:56] ranks of the message and it would be
[1:16:59] part of it start out as a genuine move
[1:17:01] of God part of it didn't it was fake as
[1:17:02] it could be it was all based on a man's
[1:17:05] idea nearly every one of them point to
[1:17:06] some preacher
[1:17:08] somewhere well come on and they become
[1:17:10] the Apostle or they become this and that
[1:17:12] and the other and they're sent to lead
[1:17:14] us and tell us where brother Brandon was
[1:17:16] wrong I have no problem in believing
[1:17:19] when brother brandom said he was wrong
[1:17:21] but I do have a problem when you got a a
[1:17:23] knucklehead preacher standing in the
[1:17:25] pull pit trying to tell us where brother
[1:17:27] Brandon was wrong I got a problem with
[1:17:29] that you know why God never sent them to
[1:17:32] to lead me to heaven but God did send
[1:17:35] his Vindicated Prophet God never
[1:17:37] Vindicated me God never Vindicated a lot
[1:17:40] of these other men well come on let's
[1:17:42] have church tonight but God did
[1:17:45] vindicate his
[1:17:47] messenger
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:50] amen now watch we've had water so be it
[1:17:54] that's correct you've had the water did
[1:17:56] you ever plant cabbage or anything or
[1:17:58] seeds or something other like that and
[1:18:01] usually you ain't got no water they just
[1:18:03] pour a little on it so you take a little
[1:18:07] cabbage plant you pour a little on it
[1:18:08] and that's what a lot of the revivals
[1:18:11] and things have been it's been just a
[1:18:12] little dab of water to where it'll give
[1:18:15] it a little drink and dry times thank
[1:18:17] God for every little cup full we've got
[1:18:20] but if you'll be real honest you know
[1:18:22] yourself that you go through dry spots
[1:18:24] your life and you're so thirsty for a
[1:18:27] good move of God how many knows what I'm
[1:18:28] talking about and you get so thirsty and
[1:18:31] God by his grace will come by and give
[1:18:32] you a little drink give you another
[1:18:34] little drink thank God thank God but I'm
[1:18:36] telling you friends the abundance of the
[1:18:39] rain is right before us and I ain't
[1:18:42] talking about now a world shaking
[1:18:44] Revival I ain't talking about God's
[1:18:46] going to raise up this great man among
[1:18:49] us and everybody in the message is going
[1:18:51] to follow this one man nonsense contr to
[1:18:55] the scripture contrary to the message of
[1:18:57] the hour but I'll tell you what God is
[1:19:00] going to do the promised
[1:19:02] son is the latter
[1:19:07] ring the promised son is the lighter
[1:19:11] rain now watch oh my you take the word
[1:19:15] former and jto and look at it and say in
[1:19:17] the Hebrew go to the Hebrew and see if
[1:19:19] it don't you want to write it down he
[1:19:21] spells it out Moray and you get the
[1:19:23] Hebrew word in it interpret what Mor
[1:19:25] means it's teaching the teaching Reign
[1:19:29] has went forth the denominational
[1:19:31] teaching Reign has went forth a million
[1:19:34] more in 44 so that was the saying of
[1:19:39] some of the denominational people a
[1:19:40] million more we want a million more
[1:19:43] converts in 1944 so that was the saying
[1:19:46] that they got and oh so and so and so
[1:19:48] members in the church or Roberts and
[1:19:50] them brothers with the Pentecostal move
[1:19:54] oh my Pentecostal move the economic or
[1:19:58] the great Pentecostal move done moved
[1:20:00] into the
[1:20:02] millions that's right and the
[1:20:06] seed the seed has went forth the
[1:20:10] word for the
[1:20:13] minority the
[1:20:15] group I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[1:20:20] them so there's three main Planters now
[1:20:24] we're looking of course mainly in the
[1:20:27] realm of Christianity so Billy Graham
[1:20:30] being the head planner or Roberts sewing
[1:20:33] the Pentecostal seed Brother brandham
[1:20:37] sewing The Original Seed
[1:20:40] word now also though at the same time
[1:20:44] frame socialism seeds are being sown in
[1:20:49] America communism seeds are being sown
[1:20:54] in America America so the
[1:20:57] beetles come from England to America the
[1:21:02] monkeys and a lot of them people so what
[1:21:05] seeds were also being sown Elvis Presley
[1:21:09] the birth of rock and roll now look at
[1:21:13] during this time frame Ben Graham or
[1:21:16] Roberts and Elijah Elvis monkeys Beatles
[1:21:21] uh socialism communism do you understand
[1:21:24] where we are right here tonight today in
[1:21:27] 2024 and look at how many politicians
[1:21:31] that are in Congress and Senate and
[1:21:34] governors and Mayors and so on it'd
[1:21:37] probably be frightening to us if we knew
[1:21:39] how many of them are absolutely
[1:21:42] socialist now we know Bernie Sanders
[1:21:44] being a senator from Vermont as liberal
[1:21:47] as he can be and he makes no bones about
[1:21:50] it he is a socialist and there's others
[1:21:54] that say they are socialist can you
[1:21:56] imagine years ago for people to ever be
[1:22:00] bold enough to say they were socialist
[1:22:02] well first of all they would have never
[1:22:03] got in because people would have never
[1:22:05] voted for them but the mind of the
[1:22:09] average American is so perverted and
[1:22:13] they are so blind that they will put
[1:22:17] people in the White House they will put
[1:22:19] him in the governor's mansion oh let's
[1:22:21] have church and our children they will
[1:22:24] vote them in oh my goodness why because
[1:22:27] our nation is groping in
[1:22:31] Insanity how in the world do we have

[1:30:49] they're not even trying what in the
[1:30:51] world is wrong with our faith and our
[1:30:54] position if they're doing it how much
[1:30:57] more are we going to do it the Bible
[1:31:00] tells us in the Book of Revelation in
[1:31:02] the last days God will put in the hearts
[1:31:05] of those Heathen Kings and they will
[1:31:07] give their power unto the Beast if God
[1:31:11] can move upon a heathen King what about
[1:31:14] a son or daughter of God that's filled
[1:31:16] with the Holy Ghost Cann not God move on
[1:31:19] our hearts to fulfill his will

[1:39:22] uhhuh the kind of crop you'll get is the
[1:39:25] kind of seed you put in you
[1:39:28] feel all right the two denominational
[1:39:31] kinds you understand you understand the
[1:39:35] two denominational
[1:39:38] kinds will
[1:39:44] unite together to go
[1:39:49] where
[1:39:51] ahow so you see the spirit of sodomy and
[1:39:56] sodomites could not just stay out there
[1:39:58] in the world outside the ranks of
[1:40:05] religion remember lot was the
[1:40:08] tie and they was knocking on lot's
[1:40:12] door and then he steps up there oh my
[1:40:15] brothers oh my brothers uh-huh calling
[1:40:18] them brothers
[1:40:20] huh well come on children the
[1:40:23] denominations are splitting right and
[1:40:25] left wanting women in the pull pit
[1:40:28] preaching wanting perverts
[1:40:30] pastoring here's the God's Prophet word
[1:40:34] coming to pass that The ecumenical and
[1:40:37] the Pentecostals will go to
[1:40:40] Sodom oh my oh Hallelujah I want you to
[1:40:46] notice it was not Sodom knocking on
[1:40:48] Abraham's door well glory to God they
[1:40:52] knew better that old skin their hide oh
[1:40:55] Hallelujah they didn't go up there and
[1:40:57] knock on Abraham's door and say can we
[1:40:59] be a pastor in your church can we be a
[1:41:02] deacon in church Abraham said get your
[1:41:04] hide out of here you pervert oh but they
[1:41:07] could go down to Old L it wouldn't
[1:41:09] surprise me a bit if some of our message
[1:41:11] compromising preachers before it's all
[1:41:13] said and done we'll start allowing all
[1:41:16] types of perversions of their Pulpit why
[1:41:19] they don't believe this message in the
[1:41:20] first place they're not even born again
[1:41:23] them s what are they message
[1:41:26] HBS message bastards to the
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:34] word where's the fire extinguisher Lord
[1:41:37] have mercy somebody bring it somebody
[1:41:38] bring
[1:41:45] it sweet
[1:41:47] Jesus Carol honey why don't you fix me
[1:41:49] to eat for supper
[1:41:54] the two denominational kinds will unite
[1:41:56] together to go to
[1:42:01] Sodom but the
[1:42:03] word will
[1:42:05] stay with the
[1:42:08] elected the Royal Sea so the two angels
[1:42:12] in the Book of
[1:42:14] Genesis they went down to
[1:42:16] Sodom but
[1:42:18] God stayed with Abraham
[1:42:23] God never went to Sodom God has nothing
[1:42:26] to do with such
[1:42:29] perversion but two angels went down
[1:42:31] there and blinded
[1:42:33] them don't you understand what their
[1:42:36] type of gospel
[1:42:38] does it blinds
[1:42:41] people so all you got to do is believe
[1:42:44] that's that's all you got to do you
[1:42:46] don't have to live right you don't have
[1:42:47] to overcome nothing you just you just
[1:42:49] believe except Jesus as your savior and
[1:42:51] you got eternal life and then you're Sav
[1:42:52] forever you know you just do whatever
[1:42:54] you want to do what does that do it
[1:42:56] blinds them and they say well I can live
[1:42:58] any way I want to live I can do whatever
[1:43:00] I want to do and then I've got habits
[1:43:02] I'm unclean I commit adulterine I lie
[1:43:04] and this and that the other but but I
[1:43:05] believe Jesus I believe Jesus and that
[1:43:08] kind of a gospel blinds them and pulls a
[1:43:12] veil over their heart and they hear some

[1:44:03] the Lord Jesus and the angels of God
[1:44:05] will separate them I'll look at them and

[1:44:10] nothing but a slippery eel I'll look at
[1:44:12] said that looks like a slippery eel but
[1:44:13] it's head down between an eel but it's

[1:44:39] Journey was
[1:44:41] Abraham but the love of the world choked
[1:44:45] him
[1:44:48] out that's what it's done today and
[1:44:50] remember those down in Sodom never seen
[1:44:52] one of of those Supernatural
[1:44:55] Miracles they had a
[1:44:57] blinding and preaching the word blinds
[1:45:00] the eyes of the

[1:45:07] unbelievers out
[1:45:09] there oh God thank you I can see
[1:45:14] Lord thank you Lord that's right you
[1:45:17] can't deny Jesus that Jesus said as it
[1:45:20] was in the days of Sodom so will it be
[1:45:21] in the coming here in the Bible see the
[1:45:23] same thing at the coming of the son of
[1:45:25] man the word stayed with the elected one
[1:45:29] and the word of God today will stay with
[1:45:31] the elected ones the Royal Seed of
[1:45:33] Abraham by the
[1:45:36] promise now watch he talks about Abraham
[1:45:38] at length there but I I cut a little bit
[1:45:40] of this out you can go back and read it
[1:45:41] all if you'd like jump on down the
[1:45:43] paragraph a little
[1:45:44] farther there stood God and said where

[1:46:53] enough now on believing you're looking
[1:46:56] for a coming son and he's coming amen
[1:47:00] that's the real church today that's
[1:47:03] exactly what Satan wants to get our eyes
[1:47:05] off of uh we want to get our eyes on
[1:47:08] this preacher that great man and that
[1:47:09] great man and that great man all them
[1:47:11] are great men no doubt whoever they are
[1:47:14] I ain't looking for some great man to
[1:47:16] take me on I'm looking for the promised
[1:47:19] son I don't know of any preacher that
[1:47:21] fulfills that promise there's only one
[1:47:24] and that's the Lord
[1:47:27] Jesus Oh My you've been looking for him
[1:47:32] and I'm going to send him to you amen
[1:47:35] what said that the
[1:47:39] word the
[1:47:41] word the two groups the Pentecostal
[1:47:44] group and the denominational of the
[1:47:46] world the Evangelical groups is merging
[1:47:50] together see what for says it again
[1:47:53] going to
[1:47:55] Sodom to
[1:47:57] reap this
[1:48:02] Harvest so you'll have the church right
[1:48:04] in the midst of Sodom yes and many of
[1:48:08] them will be afraid to say anything
[1:48:10] against
[1:48:11] it they don't want their name their
[1:48:13] picture their face on
[1:48:17] television they don't want to be banned
[1:48:19] on
[1:48:20] YouTube they don't want people marching
[1:48:22] out there with banners and oh you better
[1:48:25] you don't have to have a law against it
[1:48:27] can't you see how close we are to the
[1:48:28] end time of the mark of the beast people
[1:48:31] can just parade against you and post all
[1:48:33] kinds of things against you on social
[1:48:36] media and that within itself creates a
[1:48:38] pressure and a lot of people just back
[1:48:42] off it works the same way in politics
[1:48:45] whoever screams the
[1:48:47] loudest we found that in building our
[1:48:49] church here you know so and so said he'd
[1:48:52] be over to we'll say you know he's a
[1:48:55] sheetrock guy he's a he's a concrete guy
[1:48:57] he'll be here on
[1:48:59] Monday next Monday I found out don't
[1:49:01] actually mean what I was always taught I
[1:49:05] always thought next Monday meant next
[1:49:08] Monday but actually it don't in
[1:49:10] construction world I'm convinced God's
[1:49:12] going to have some people saved in
[1:49:15] construction work just to show the devil
[1:49:17] he can do it and show all of them ain't
[1:49:20] Liars
[1:49:24] and if you tell somebody you're going to
[1:49:25] be there and you don't show up and don't
[1:49:27] call them there's something wrong with
[1:49:28] their
[1:49:29] Christianity if you can't do it let them
[1:49:32] know you ought to be a man or a woman of
[1:49:34] your word Amen brother
[1:49:39] Donnie oh
[1:49:41] my now watch what are they going to
[1:49:45] Sodom going to reap this Harvest now
[1:49:47] what they're trying to
[1:49:50] do is to manufact
[1:49:53] facture a latter
[1:49:55] rain and again he says
[1:50:00] nonsense why that latter rain will sweep
[1:50:04] the world
[1:50:06] brother and then a former sewing rain
[1:50:09] sewing word that's right and you'll see
[1:50:12] what that latter rain produces you'll
[1:50:15] find out there being affiliation the
[1:50:17] Pentecostals and all the
[1:50:19] groups will come together and they'll
[1:50:22] shut the door on them guys that won't
[1:50:25] listen to
[1:50:27] it and you won't be allowed to open your
[1:50:34] mouth now you know what I find sad is
[1:50:37] we've got people in the message that are
[1:50:40] working under the pre-tribulation
[1:50:42] anointing because if they had their way
[1:50:44] about it they'd like to close every
[1:50:45] Church door and everybody just sit at
[1:50:48] home and listen to a
[1:50:51] tape that's not the the gospel of the
[1:50:53] Lord Jesus Christ it's the anointing of
[1:50:56] the last days
[1:50:59] Antichrist brother bham said it would
[1:51:01] shut the Tabernacle doors they're
[1:51:04] already

[1:51:08] churches that shut them oh I know you

[1:51:25] that wants to set everyone of them down
[1:51:26] and shut them up and say all they need
[1:51:29] to do is press
[1:51:31] play will preach brother Donnie I think
[1:51:34] it will what is it it's the
[1:51:37] devil I said it's the devil it's the
[1:51:41] spirit of antichrist show me where
[1:51:43] brother brandham ever laid his hands on
[1:51:45] an MP3 player and said you will replace
[1:51:48] preachers show me where brother bam ever
[1:51:51] laid his hands on a real to real or a
[1:51:53] cassette player or an audio player

[1:51:58] you an I press play where the Prophet
[1:52:00] said God don't use mechanical equipment
[1:52:03] God don't use machines a tap player
[1:52:06] can't feel for you a CD player can't
[1:52:09] feel for you but God laid the word over
[1:52:13] the Levites Hearts why a levite can cry
[1:52:17] a levite can be led by the spirit of God
[1:52:20] a levite can move from his notes wow

[1:52:26] hearts of his God call

[1:55:11] students already I just heard some of
[1:55:13] them today on the radio on some of our
[1:55:16] major
[1:55:17] universities and they was listing the
[1:55:19] different things that these Jewish
[1:55:21] students have been slapped and Jewish
[1:55:24] students that have been called all types
[1:55:25] of names and made fun of and ridicule if
[1:55:27] it was any other minority group in this
[1:55:30] nation they would have them slammed in
[1:55:37] jail but with the Jew it's like you're
[1:55:40] expected to treat them that
[1:55:45] way oh
[1:55:47] my pre-tribulation anointing is all
[1:55:51] around us but let's not get so drunk on
[1:55:54] that and look at all
[1:55:57] that we ought to be under such great
[1:56:02] expectation that we also are fixing to
[1:56:05] reap our Harvest thank you Lord ours

[2:05:17] our Mighty God
[2:05:19] hallelujah he wants to walk Among Us he
[2:05:22] wants to prove himself if he can't heal
[2:05:25] us how can I have any assurance that he
[2:05:27] can raise the dead if he can't heal a
[2:05:30] sick living body how in the world could
[2:05:32] I believe he could raise a body that has
[2:05:35] went back Beyond acids and gases but
