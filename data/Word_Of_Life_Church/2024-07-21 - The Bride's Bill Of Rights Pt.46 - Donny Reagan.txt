praise the Lord amen Lord how many can say Amen to that the Lord's been so faithful to all of us for his Mercy what do we deserve nothing as far as his goodness and his Mercy but by his faithfulness that's something that I've observed and noticed as young Christians that when they get saved and they first start out on their journey and go through things of life it can be so hard for them so difficult cuz they pray and it seems like God delays part of that trust is built over years of faithfulness just like it is with a husband and wife you got a true wife a true husband somebody might accuse them of something but you say I don't believe that I know my wife I know my husband that's what it is with the Lord we go through things and we wonder Lord what what are you doing why are you allowing this I know you could move just like that if you would but when he doesn't he has a reason amen I'm glad we can trust him even when we don't understand W you thank you Lord amen we greet you today in the name of the Lord what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together here in the house of God let's turn to Isaiah 54 if you would today Isaiah 54 verse we'll begin reading verse 4 through ver 6 fear not for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy use and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker is thine say it with me husband husband the Lord of hosts is his name now what is he the Redeemer the Redeemer of the children of Israel the god of the whole earth he's the holy one the Redeemer now remember what he was to them in the Old Testament he is to us in the new the god of the whole Earth shall he be called and we know as far as creation and owning it all he does own it but sat Satan still has a squatter's claim on it he's not called God of the whole earth yet but he will be for the Lord has called thee as a woman for Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of Youth in other words you got married when you were very very young but yet your husband was certainly not a good one was he a wife of use when thou was refused saith thy God and many' like to be remembered today as we pray and ask the Lord to help us um Brother Brad Gilbert is has an need of prayer he has a sep sepsis infection in his knee he sent me a picture of it last night it was absolutely awful though it's all swollen up so we certainly want to to remember him also I got a text with sister Lisa Lan and she also needed prayer today so let's just approach the Lord with this opportunity that he's given us father we come today not as Beggars not as slaves but we come as your people your people which are called by your name we've been given this channel of Prayer by which we could bring our needs our requests our desires into your presence we've already sensed you here Lord we thank you for this beautiful singing and how it creates an atmosphere I Marvel as I hear these talented people using their gift to bless your people that's why you give us gifts not to put them under a bushel or hide them or not make them available to benefit others so now we've come together each of us with our lick of fire that we can be able to receive from you today but not just receive but we're here to give back to you you're our husband and we love you what kind of home would it be if the husband was constantly giving and doing for the wife and the wife never done anything back for the husband or vice versa that but certainly not be a home of love we don't want our church just to be a place to where we're constantly asking you we want this we want that we need this we want that and then we Chad you when you don't answer when we sing what kind of church have we got but we want our church to be a place of Love Not only love for one another but love for you so we come not only to get today but we come to give back into your presence you heard all these needs that Justin read before I came out and these that have been made known father we pray for each of them would you help us today dear God help me to get out of the way you see Lord what I have before me I need your help guide me Lord Jesus shut my mouth to anything that would displease you may your presence Come and catch each of us into this special special place today we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated what an awesome privilege has been given to us in this day to be able to stand before almighty God and before his people to be able to speak words that to some would be very foolish to some would be greatly misunderstood no doubt and I realized a long time ago that I'm not called to help everybody I'm not called to be everybody's Pastor I'm not called to be the one that would go here and there and there nor is any other man really each of us find our spot and there is where we stay and as long as God can help us to do that and I find it amazing because our lord Jesus has longed also for his place to be able to be in the church in the way that he wanted to be and we know the prophet tells us that he gets his place back in the end time now not with everyone not with everybody that even goes to church not even with everybody that says they are a Christian will he get his place because his true place is to be Lord in every one of our Lives we don't want him just to be savior do we we want him to be Lord Master where he can do with us whatever he he desires to do if he wants to Humble us so be it if he wishes to exalt italt us so be that that too whatever he wants is whatever surrendered child of God really wants so the Lord is pro prophetically saying that he's going to get his position in the church in the last day which would be what what is that position oh well he's he he's the savior of the body but that's where many people stop just to save them from hell and truly he is a great savior none like him but he doesn't just want to be that but he wants to be the one that we are actually married to so relate it today as it would be in your home those of you that are married you children that watch your mom and dad and see what a marriage relationship can be and you see that God picked out of all human relationships to identify himself with his church he could have chose a father and a daughter he could have chose a father and a son he could have chose many different Human Relationships but he chose what a man and his wife so what was the first human relationship on the earth a father and his daughter was it a mother and her son and you hear people say well I I was a I'm a mama's boy and you say well that's a daddy's girl now why do we say that because we can see there's a special relationship there and that's a wonderful relationship which is basically as far as the nominal churches go that God has chosen a relationship with the church as being father and children but we believe through the light of God that there's a higher relationship and a higher call that it's not just father and children but it's actually husband and wife so it's the man and his wife that was reflected in the Garden of Eden so God when he made the man and everything that God made he said it was good and he looked at all the substance that he brought in into the world all the beauty all the colors all the textures all the things that he made it must have been absolutely incredible then he makes the man but remember the man as long as he was in the god image the man could never fall but it's when the man was placed in the image of animal that he could fall so what was man's body as we are today the highest form of mammal life warm blooded animal so this is why in the resurrection no more blood because we lose that image of animal life this is why you take the spirit of God off of a human being they're lower than an animal they will do things an animal would never do is that right because they're a mammal with a soul and that Soul gives them a special status but only if they use it in the right way and then God of course looked at the man and the Lord God said it's not good that the man should be alone so where did he get that attribute of being lonely how in a world could you be lonely in absolute perfection so here you are on the earth you're the god of the earth everything does what you tell it to do it orchestrates by your command whatever you wanted to do speak it if you don't like the original order change it if you want a tree to be over there if you want this to be there say it that's all you have to do and it's moved at your command but yet he looked around and he saw the giraffes and there was two of them saw the Bears there were two horses two elephants two giraffe Impala januk all the different animals Two by Two by Two by Two but there was nothing found for him and then the Lord God opened up his side and brought a peculiar thing out of him he didn't I probably didn't even understand what he felt but he knew that there was something more than himself that he longed for Fellowship I don't know if he realized it or not that a lot of it was within him it had to be released though the image had to be smitten in order that it could come out so a part of it come out of him and a part of it was taken from around him so God opened up his side and took out a rib and then God went in the spirit and divided the feminist characteristics and put them inside this body that he had formed from Adam's Rib and it's amazing about the rib I don't know if you've ever studied about it or not but in the rib it's a it's a very odd part of the human body from the rib is found the DNA and the cells that make up other parts of the body so in taking the rib you've got other parts of the body condensed right in that rib form so God never made her from his foot so that she would be trampled on by this man God never made her a part of his head so that she would rule over him but God took her from where from under his heart right there in that portion of his body when Adam awakes out of that anesthesia and he looks there and immediately it was as we say love at first sight it must have been awesome their first few days and weeks and months we really don't even know how long they were there together it might have been Millennium because time didn't really matter anyway age didn't matter cuz they wasn't getting older and it must have been really something how that God mirrored his own desire in Adam and Eve now remember according to Genesis 5 and God made them male and female and called their name Adam so Eve was not called Eve until after she committed adultery so she got her own name after she received the seed of another being but in the beginning they were both called Adam so if you'd have walked up in the Garden of Eden said Adam they both would have said what because they were called by the same name now truly this is the perfect marriage in the Garden of Eden so we see this man and he gets his name from the home that he was taken up Adam Adam which means red and then we see the woman and she's perfect woman now the prophet tells us that she was God's thought or God's idea of what a perfect woman was what a perfect woman was God CHS her hair to be blonde God chose her eyes to be blue now we don't know exactly what color Adam's hair was and eyes but yet God chose them to be the very epitome of every son and daughter of God that would come thereafter and enter into holy matrimony but God not only mirrored us but he mirrored himself so God looked at them as they went to the Garden of Eden and they too began to bring something to God that God had not experienced in the creation of the myriads of stars that scientists are still finding out that there's worlds that are there that they're just seeing so we still don't know how many they are and yet he wrote every one of them out there that was his first Bible and he called them by name the last count that I had and and looking at it some months ago it was up into the septian septian that's a one was like 19 zeros septian stars now that's in the visible Universe across what they call the elliptical plane which goes out as far as light can see it no telling how many more there are that they've not even found yet and yet that did not bring him satisfaction like it did when that man and woman was just kind of hanging out as we'd say in the Garden of Eden and they just get up of a morning and first thing of a morning maybe wash their face and go down in that river that was so pure and the fruits on the trees were absolutely incredible the leaves were were were beautiful and Brilliant green and and the yellows and the fruit and the Reds and the melons and the berries and because they were vegetarian and everything that they would eat was so tasty they were so tasty and the sky you and I have never seen the sky the way it was then we've never seen even the light of the Sun the way that it was then and the Earth how that it must have been and the air that that they breathed must have been so pure and so awesome and God God would come down every day just to fellowship with them he loved them so much and God himself stood them there as the prophet said and joined them together and he made it known to her you imagine that God as a pastor as many times I've been in in a hospital and maybe I would be the first one that would go in and and see someone from the church that had open heart surgery or they had some type of say uh that they had to have t taken place in their intensive care and I would be there praying for them my hand on their shoulder if it's a brother my hand in his hand and watch his eyes as they start batting and come open brother Donnie brother Donnie thank you the Lord was gracious I've been there many times and I'm the first face they see wow that would be scary wouldn't it but you imagine when Adam opened his eyes eyes and there's standing beside him a person that was not there before he went to sleep and maybe God told her go up near you know science has even proven that human touch can lower blood pressure it can level off it affects glucose it affects so many things in our body so Adam is coming out from under the anesthesia and he feels this strange feeling as she's touching him and he he's still trying to come out of it and he and he finally does and when he opens his eyes there is the most beautiful creature that he'd ever seen in his entire life and he says you are Isa because you came from ish you are woan or man with a womb because you came from man oh God and yet father knew that would not last forever he knew that when he brought them out of that image of God and placed them into that animal body in one way it would seem he was doing them a disfavor but actually he's going to express the fullness of all that he is he couldn't make them fall now but he put them in a realm where they could and they could choose and we know the story of course that they did choose and now this Garden this paradise turns into it was the most beautiful awesome wonderful place on the earth and me know that Adam's Body actually didn't come from the Garden of Eden it come from outside the proximity of the headquarters so the perfect the perfect reflection of what God wanted to be was called the Garden of Eden but Adam was actually made in Eden so Eden was like a state and the Garden of Eden was like a city so God brought Adam after he made him and placed him in the Garden of Eden he wasn't made there but Eve actually come out of Adam's Body when he reached the state of the Garden of Eden when he come to his place Eve could not come out of Adam as long as Adam was in Eden she could only come out of Adam when Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden which was his position now all that being said so that you could be able to realize the Lord Jesus in his greatness could not bring forth a bride in his own image until he himself started from the act of condens sension went as low as he could go then started ascending back up once he comes to his place then his bride can come to her place now we know that he started it out of course on the day of Pentecost now I am a Pentecostal by experience but I'm not a to in Pentecostal I hope you all today are Pentecostal by experience our lord Jesus come that same way so that he could come in the antitype that he could come through his Garden of Eden and he would give birth to his bride so where did God get the elements to make eeve well the most important element of course was her spirit her life but God also took a rib then from there we don't know if God reached over and got a little bit of dark dirt and a little bit of Red Dirt we don't know exactly what God did the Bible doesn't tell us but much of the contents of her body come from Adam's Body himself the structure and the Flesh and yet God opened up his spirit and took that out too and then there on the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was fully come there come a great Mighty rushing wind so it was the church born of of natural elements she was born of Supernatural Elements by the Breath of God so what was it that happened there wasn't shouting alone it wasn't jumping and running and we we believe in all that do we not that's that affects our emotions of course but what God did was he brought himself down into one tiny blood cell and God created that blood cell in the womb of a virgin as brother Chuck was singing about a while ago the very reason that we can stand in this place today and God could say what sin are you talking about is because he himself come down into that one blood cell and put his own life in that one blood cell and when the blood cell was broken open at Calvary it released the life of God himself so the token then is not the chemistry of the blood but rather the life that was in the blood now watch this and question and answers the prophet said Jesus cannot come until a church a body of Believers and the ministry that he want now watch I was going to focus on this the ministry that he once had has to be the same as it was then too now watch so it's not just believing the same doct and believing the same theology but there must be a Ministry come on the earth that will match the original and he said them without us is not made perfect Paul said in Hebrews 11 without us they cannot be perfected they must have this ministry to raise up the Luther Wesley and all of them down Through the Ages so it's not just a restoration back to to the original word or the original spirit and it is but there must be a Ministry on the earth in the last day that will be like the ministry of Jesus himself so whose ministry will it be well people want say well it's that brother it's that brother it's that brother no actually it's not it's actually the ministry of Jesus himself now as I mentioned to you Wednesday night as far as my min Ministry personally I'm the only preacher in my Ministry Donnie Reagan but when it comes to the ministry of our church we have multiple different Ministries let me go ahead and just spill it to you if you're a Christian today every one of you actually have a Ministry now you may not handle the word and you may not preach and you may not cast out Devils but every believer has a god-given Ministry it might be praying for the preachers it might be writing cards and sending encouragement texts or emails or whatever but every one of you children of God have a Ministry can anybody say Amen to that so there must be a Ministry on the earth so when the Lord Jesus started out then it was just himself what was the very next step that he did he called Disciples so for those who don't believe that the Lord will have a a Ministry in the last day of preachers that will be true if he does not there's no need in you lay it to even trying because the first Lord Jesus in his Advent to the Earth he himself came and started preaching then the very next step was don't step over the preachers and go directly to Mary Magdalene and all the rest of those sisters and brothers but the very next step was out of him he would get other men and they would start proclaiming the same thing he now that's the ministry come on say amen that's the ministry of the way he started it so watch the prophet said then they must have this ministry to raise up the Luther the West the Wesley and all the rest of them down Through the Ages when that come that part of where the Eagles are gathered just as the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together so the resurrection cannot come until the Lord Jesus accomplishes the very same thing in the last days that he started in the first day now he could have started it out without preachers if that's what he wanted if he wanted just to start it out with people that would just meet every now and then and if you wanted to start out we we'll say with tapes he could have allowed the tape recorder to have been invented in 32 ad or 30 or whenever because science has been around for a long long time he could if he wanted it to be books he could have had all types of his books that would have been printed then and they said now this is the way I'm going to start my church I'm going to start my church this way that what you're going to do you're going to go out and you're going to evangelize and you're going to give people tapes or you're going to give them books and then what they'll do they'll set it home and there'll be secret disciples there's no need to assemble yourselves together we'll just be secret disciples if that's what he wanted don't you think he could have done that 2,000 years ago well if he started out his church the way that he did according to the gospel and way the book of Acts relates it how is it that we've got it in the last day that people think he's going to end it in a total different way than the way he started it I mean maybe I don't understand it but to me that does not fulfill Hebrews 138 that he's the same yesterday today and forever notice in the Harvest time now doesn't Malachi 4 teach us that before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come that this will take place how many knows that he will restore the hearts of the children to the fathers is that right the face of the original Pentecostal fathers original not 1906 original Pentecostal fathers the son of man the word living itself a again amongst the people now listen carefully some of the things I'm going to share with you this morning it might take you a little bit to be able to comprehend it the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message you are a reflection of this hour the message now I've said it to you before but think of how many years that the original Church preached the gospel and they did not have one written book of the New Testament now historians date First Corinthians and possibly Galatians maybe to be one of the first books that was actually written down which was around 59 ad and yet the church was given birth at 33 ad what in the world did they preach for 25 or 26 or 27 years whatever it was what did they preach they didn't have the Book of Matthew they didn't have the four gospels they did not have the book of of Acts which Luke wro wrote years and years later they did not have Corinthians and Galatians and Philippians and Ephesians and filimon first and second Thessalonians and F second Timothy they didn't have any of that stuff what did they preach they had and preached a living Christ they had the Old Testament and no doubt the spirit of God would lead them oh my people people criticize us today because we still read and preach from the Old Testament where do you think that original church Preach from they preach from the types and the Shadows of the Old Testament there was no Book of Matthew there was no Book of Mark there was no Book of Luke oh I wish somebody would preach with me do you realize that the 12 apostles had all died except for John before the New Testament ever even come and written form so what did they preach they preached what he told them to originally go and make disciples of all Nations now this is what the bridegroom himself did surely he's the one he's the one who wants a wife he's the one who needs to give to us the description of what is idea of the perfect woman is so we'll say as I referred to it a week or so ago we'll say that he had list and he had this list of his choice his prerogatives his view his personal taste now every man that's sitting here today that got married and you saw that woman that you met many many years ago and there might have been other women that you were kind of interested in but this one woman just really stuck out to you and she you felt like would meet what you thought a real wife would be and what your desire would be well God of course had that same desire he wanted a wife a bride well he himself was the one now that makes the requirement all right I want her to be this way I don't want her to be like that I want her to have a certain trait I want her to makeup to be like this of course first of all I want her to love me I want her to accept my headship above everything else and then God be to designate well he himself when he was sh didn't tell us exactly what he wanted but he had his men in that first Century to begin to write it down now remember the church was new as it was the devil didn't even know understand about the church Jesus was the first one to use that word so it was new the devil had to learn how the church is going to operate how it's going to function so he had to watch it as it unfolded they never had a church before only in types and shadows of the Old Testament so even the apostles themselves wasn't sure what is a church what does that mean a church well we know according to the Greek word that they use to write that it is a group of people called out of their homes Ecclesia a group of people called out of their homes to meet in a certain place I still believe the meaning of that same word don't you so you know whenever they started doing that who was it that told them to do that way well it wasn't Jesus Jesus was not the one that said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together Paul said that not Jesus but where did Paul get it he got it from the bridegroom himself then whenever they'd go out and begin to preach and they'd go up and down through the coast of cre and they'd go into caposa they'd go to thessalonica they'd go to all these cities well what do they do when they get there you know they've never started a church before what do we do the spirit of the bridegroom began to move on these men with a dispensational anointing and it was the first Foundation of a church so what did these men begin to do that they start handing out whenever the Bibles become into PR all right now what you need to do is you need to take Matthew and make Mark Luke and John and just you know just kind of hang out don't risk your lives now this is going to be really risky you can be a secret believer there's no need to gather out and let everybody make fun of you and ridicule you well just believe this word but stay at home I mean you know that it's really a shame to me that the Lord Jesus didn't understand the perfect way to start a church because a lot of them first century second and third century Christians wouldn't have had to Die the death of a martyr because they went to church if they could have been secret Christians and nobody knew that they were Christian you know they could just kind of stayed at home and stayed away from everybody that was one of the reasons they got killed because they were not ashamed of their Christianity they were not ashamed to go to the house of gods I've told you I've stood right there in those catacombs around Rome and it's an awesome type of a thing when you go there and realize some of our brothers and sister sisters would meet there under the city and they would have church but there was a drive inside of them there was something about coming together there was something about singing and worshiping I still agree don't you there's something about it so the ministry then was not a Ministry to where everybody just kind of lived their own life so the Christians in caposa they went this way the Christians of thessalonica they went that way and they never come together they never talk they never Fellowship that was not the choice of the bridegroom so the ministry then that followed on after the Lord Jesus left was actually the continuation of his own Ministry and under that influence of that great anointing the prophet tells us in that first seal that it was his own influence that influenced that age but it's amazing because time we come to the second age third age fourth age fifth age and sixth age it's not his own influence anymore but there is a promise I will restore sayith the Lord so it's not just a promise doctrinally it's not just a promise I'll restore the same water baptism and their Worship in a similar way but it is a restoration of personal Ministry of Jesus Christ himself it was not thus in the days of Luther or Wesley or for Pentecost now I don't want to hurt your feelings already but I have to say it this way that every man around this message that claims he's a preacher is not really a god- called man as I said before every preacher is not a man of God but every man of God is a preacher but every preacher that preaches is not necessarily A godall man many of them are Kingdom Builders many are are men that they want a big name for them themselves that's not a man of God well come on many of them are nothing but sers of Discord Division and so on again that's not another man of God because the ministry of Jesus reincarnated in his church is not a Ministry of division so it's not going to be one that's going to divide the sheep and and debate and argue and fuss and split this group and split that group in order to get a following to them that is not the ministry of Jesus Christ now what's this the prophet again says that you are a reflection of this hour the message of reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in Jesus Christ you're in the presence of the Sun s so n the life that was in the shuck went out in the wheat the life won't change the carriers change they denominate see the blades the tossel the Shu but the wheat can't change it's got to be a Ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word so notice those who are promoting that we don't any longer need a Ministry don't you see where they're getting their inspiration Satan knows if the ministry of Christ Jesus is not replicated in this day there will be no Resurrection or Rapture it's not just going to be a a restoration back to the original Doctrine it must be a Ministry now don't argue with me just argue with a man you say you follow now watch like the first church was on the word spirit filled word fed not denominational fed but word fed and the church said watch this there's a man here can turn on the light when a man in a Foundry is making a belt he's got a certain tone he's put in it when he's setting his mold and pouring his iron he puts in so much brass so much steel so much copper why he knows exactly how much to put in to make to give it the right tone that's what Jesus has done by his bride he had to put so much looser so much Methodist so much Presbyterian so much Pentecost but what does he come out with his own reflection what is it just like a pyramid message you see it's heaping right up come into the minority with the headstone the ministry of Jesus Christ on Earth has to be the same as the ministry he had or he can't come to it don't you understand friend those that hang around the message that don't want the same Ministry of the Lord Jesus on the Earth he can't come to them and connect for the body change there must be a Ministry on the earth oh you said brother AR you talking about you no I ain't talking about just me I'm talking about me yes but I'm also talking about you I'm talking about every other God comment it was not just the 12 apostles that done everything in the book of Acts but there was a body move you have something to do you have something to contribute to every church service that we have you have your hands to clap you have your amens to give you have your prayers you have your worship you have your everyday life there are people that you will affect by the effect of this gospel that I will never meet there are people that you are affecting every day of your life I will never run into them brother John as a minister these other brothers will never run into them but God has given you a Ministry what kind of ministry brother Donnie a life lived by the word is the word expressed you teenagers you have a Ministry you use of our church you have a Ministry what is it the ministry of living and expressing the word of God as a wife of God oh Lord Jesus help us let me read this to you it's I I just want to tell you it's it's quite astounding Revelation 1113 in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man now it was a being that looked like the son of man one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pths with a golden girdle ah I hope you can receive this next statement the son of man is continuing his ministry today in Bride form sir you see you simply changed his Veil from his Prophet to his bride now watch's this in the seven Church ages the prophet says it this way referring to the scripture now that's the Bible that's what the spirit said see the candle notice this the candlesticks all right verse 13 in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one likened to the son of man what one like him who was this yes his bride one like him oh Lord Jesus watch How It Was clothed with the Garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood guard about the PS not a man not a man a woman yes sir Lord children one like unto the son of man who is it the son of man's wife Lord God not a man a woman with a golden girdle the gospel that held the power power and glory of God over the body of Christ The Gospel the hell the power of God and glory of God the power and glory of God is held over the body what are we talking about the bride is his mystical body that's right can you imagine when John looks and sees that image that image laid down Revelation for all those years until the last days when God allows a prophet to peer in to another prophet's vision and he sees somebody there that had been hid from Millennia and who did he see one likened to the son of man but it was the bride brass he says let me not skip this oh what a beautiful picture we got here under consideration I hope y'all can take it this morning under consideration brass always is Judgment you know the Brazen Altar and the brass Serpent and so forth BR speaks of judgment his feet then now watch when John sees the Sevenfold personage of the Lord Jesus and he does his hair his eyes his voice all of that and then he goes down to the foundation which is the bottom where his feet are and he saw his feet as as fine brass burned in the furnace then watch the prophet as he brings this feminist image out of this his feet then the Church of Jesus Christ is to set upon Divine judgment you imagine we creatures which were born into this world and born condemned born judged as soon as you see a naval the prophet said when you see a naval on that human being it's a sign of a renegade and we were born attached to our mother we were born lost without God we were born seemingly with no hope but before you ever took on that image of your mother and your father you were already seen by John in the Book of Revelation in the image reflected by the son of man Hallelujah you were in him before you was ever in your father you were in him before your mother ever carried you you were in [Music] him thank you Lord Jesus then the Church of Jesus Christ has set upon Divine judgment Christ dying in our stead the just one paying for our judgment up there before God died there as a sinner that's right on the cross and he Soul descended into hell now watch and he picks up this other part of that scripture and this is what John heard in the symbol that he had a voice of many Waters and the prophet goes on to say watch it's the church speaking but I want you to realize this he doesn't say just preachers amen you have a voice brother sister you have a voice well brother don't what you talking about what can I do what can I say I I don't know how to describe you know I don't know how to describe the word and the doctrines and this and that but can you tell how the fire got lit can you tell all I know I was once blind but now I see I was once lost but now delivered I I can't explain it all of what they believe brother Donnie can preach it and these other brothers can preach it I can't explain it but all I know is I've seen sick folks get healed in our assembly I've seen the dead get raised you saw yourself right back here some months ago I have seen the Lord do this and do that I don't know how it all works but I have seen it with my own eyes I know that I was born wretched it seemed like I had no hope but my rection has been changed heavenward I am not the person that I was sounds like to me you're sharing how the fire god lit you may not be able to explain about predestination and election you may not be able to make perfect sense like someone else could but what you know is that you was on your way to Hell seemingly and the Lord Jesus got a hold to you it wasn't you looking for him it was him looking for you you didn't even want him you didn't even want nothing to do with his word that he got a hold to you because you were identified in the image of the son of man watch it's the church speaking to him now Waters Revelation 17:15 Waters meant thickness and multitudes of people now his voice or this being that was standing there looking like this Christ in his church as a bride in Christ being one like husband and wife is one the church in Christ being molded together right with one person wow sounds like to me wedding bells are chiming Hallelujah hallelujah oh my I want to thank you all for all the nice birthday cards and and the anniversary cards and gifts and so on that you gave to men Carol men Carol experien what many of you that's been married a long time like we do that we'll start thinking the same thing what you want what you want to eat what you want what I was thinking I say that's exactly what I was thinking too I go with to Ross and TJ Maxx you know she's looking for a new dress or she's looking for one of our granddaughter or something and she'll be up one one one end of the small size or the medium whatever we're looking at I may be halfway down or down to the other end of it and I'll pick out something and she'll pick out exactly the same thing on the other end so we've been so much alike and we're so close together that a lot of our thoughts are the same you see those that get married right off and they go to heaven ups and downs give it a little bit of time you'll merge together or you said Brother D I'm hoping she'll become so much so like me because I'm the perfect image of a man I'm what I need to be well what you'll find out buddy boy is not only will she be like you but you'll start becoming like her W Glory that's the merging of one and one and unity oh you I could never do that I'm a macho man are you any more Macho than almighty God almighty God had to come down on the earth and become like us that he might make us like him Hallelujah he could not stay there in heaven and say come on up children if you can he knew I couldn't even jump a foot off the ground so he come down to the Earth and said can't since you can't come to me I'll come to you I will come to you oh but brother Donnie I've got so many mistakes I do too but I refuse to let my mistakes Define my identity I am not known by my mistakes I am not known in eternity by my shortcoming I am known by my source my source of originality tells who I am Hallelujah I was in [Applause] [Music] him as a bride in Christ being one like husband and wife is one the church in Christ being molded together it's divine epoxy you all know is whether it's paint or whether it is that you're putting together so you have a part a alpha and you have a Part B all you guessed it bride so you take equal parts and you go to mix together now depending on the setting how they've chemically orchestrated that on some of the ones I've used before you got 90 seconds some of you may have 5 minutes some of you may have 30 minutes just depending on what you're doing you know they use use it in gr they use it in all different types of things and they use it in paint to paint your garage floor so it'll make it more hard and more sturdy the Lord knew better than just to give me a portion of his spirit and not merge men him together I'd never be able to endure Leo deia can't you understand why the epoxy was not needed in the days of Luther the epoxy was not needed in the days of wesy but the epoxy strength is needed in this last day because all hell has broke loose and the gates of hell are opening wide open and hell has opened up her mouth and the Lord said I can't just let them go in on a shout I can't let him go in on just a bunch of emotion but I must go down I must go down I must mix myself a with her part B and when we stir together there will rise an invincible Army that will make hell tremble [Music] all right notice the prophet said the things that Christ did the church does also do you see it that beautiful oh my that beautiful listen this church there is Holiness there she's standing standing in the image of Holiness in holiness in power in Majesty with seeing visions signs wonders everything just like he did here it is on Earth giving all praise to God saying I can do nothing except the father shows me you see this is what separates them from Kingdom building preachers Kingdom building preachers can't say that oh I tell you one thing I'm God's gift I I'm this I'm that I'm that I'm that I'm that no no no you get part A and Part B Mo both mixed together and this is what you produce you get all Part B just Anointed with a little bit of the Holy Ghost and what do you do you capitalize that be and it becomes everything and then everybody's supposed to Rally around you to make you the Great Hero I only have one hero his name is the Lord Jesus I love men of God but I have no no absolutely none whatsoever none that I put my ultimate confidence in because all men will let you down all men will fail you I don't care how good they are I don't care how much Holy Ghost they are they're still in an animal body if you only to get one thing out of the service today get this you are baptized by the holy ghost in your soul but you are still captured in an animal house it will bother you every day you live on this Earth come on preach with me Church it will aggravate you it will fall into failure it will fall into temptation you will will make mistakes but one day you're going to get a body that is not an animal Hallelujah and you will get a body which matches your [Applause] soul notice say here it is on Earth giving all praise to God saying I can do nothing except what the father shows me but he showed me and here it is they come see these things now Christ MOS it into one and the voice of many Waters many people not just the one it was the whole church the seven churches molded together as one great ransomed body of the Lord can't you see when the apoxy power comes together in the last days it will cause the resurrection Paul is waiting on you Peter is waiting on you oh they love it the theop don't get me wrong they're not bored they're not unhappy but you know what they ain't eat one bite since they've been there that's what they told the prop would be on the C of times he was curious he said do you all eat here he said no we don't eat here but one day we go back to Earth and take up bodies to eat in there we will eat and drink and be a continuation of this same life the power of God that will Embrace this bride in the last day will be so strong it will force the resurrection it will cause Hallelujah tens of millions of people that are waiting on this moment to get up out of the earth can't you see why it takes more than just a little anointing that'll make a shout it must be he himself living out of us oh children if we could just get out of the way and let him live through us let him speak to us let him witness her let him do it to us notice this in the mark of the beast this is the night after this one that I just read from we want to pick up on our subject from last night last night we taken on the church ages and that how we saw Jesus standing in the church speaking as the voice of many Waters he had hair like wool eyes like flames of fire we found out that those Flames like swords a sword went out of his mouth a two-edged sword and we found out that was the word of God that went forth from the church's mouth and they would even cut to the mar of the bone and a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart Hebrews the 4th chapter again the Seal of God he was on a rooll if you'll follow these serices right where he's at there in 1954 at the Tabernacle he's really on a roll his voice was a voice of many Waters both Christ and the church speaking together so Jesus can't say he's the same yesterday and forever and the church said well in a certain way his voice won't merge with that Oh Glory both Christ and the church speaking together with a golden girdle around the breast part of the church so here you've got this image it's not like the Colossus that Nebuchadnezzar s and man your soul right but this one glory to God it's Christ imor into the bride's body remember that's the Greek word that the prophet used when he said it was like an actor that an actor would go play one part and dress up a certain part then he go in behind the scene and he changed his clothes and come back out and he was another person Christ imorph himself into his profit in the last day to break the seals come on somebody and Christ is still here IM morphing himself into his bride's body open the da that mean we'll all produce the sign of the son of man no that's not our part of the ministry of the son of man the prophet told us that's one to a generation one to a generation I'm not looking for somebody else to come and discern this and discern that that that's one to a generation but I have my part you have your part you have your part in the ministry of the Lord Jesus well I cannot cause this myself the preachers cannot cause this Resurrection it's when the bride body gets under that anointing but instead we focus on our houses we focus on this and we focus on that and we argue and debate and fuss it ain't no wonder the devil wants us to do that can't you see why he wants you to get your mind off of the Resurrection he wants you to get your mind off of the Rapture he wants you to get your mind off of your [Music] position his voice was the voice of many Waters both Christ and the church speaking together with a golden girdle about the breast part of the church covered over holding the gospel holding the righteousness of Christ so the golden girdle was holding the church holding this righteousness around her John didn't see the bride out there with their hands on the top of this garment holding it don't take it don't take it she wasn't holding righteous righteousness was holding [Applause] her she's just standing there allowing the Lord God to dress her and he knew how it would be with her Humanity The Winds of failure had he hung that garment Loosely bound around her The Winds of failure The Winds of mistake The Winds of shortcoming would come and blow that thing away from me she said oh I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost but he said I'm going to put this righteousness around you I'm going to wrap you from head to toe not only that I'm going to put a girdle around you and I'm going to gird it around you you ready bride glory to God I'm righteous as God is hallelujah it changed the way I feel it changed the way I walk it Chang is the way I do say how come y'all act that way we got a girdle of almighty God around us come on somebody but the church don't want no girdle of his righteousness and his Purity it'll tie you in shape you ready well glory to God that's kind of cutting off my wind down here but it what it'll do it'll kind of help you get more air in your diaphragm and this is one way you do it well thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah it'll make you act like you never thought You' act it'll make you live the way you never thought you would because he's got that girl around [Applause] sh with a golden girl around the breast part of the church you see the nourishing comes from the bride's body I know this perverted generation that we live in when men want to be women and women want to be men but I'd like for one to be able to get pregnant and be able to give birth to a child the way a woman does I heard a Baptist preacher sat not long goes I'll tell you one thing we can do he said if we put all these people together and to put them all up in one place and let them live in one place long enough they'll pretty much take care of theel because they can't reproduce well it's the same way with church denomination all it produces is another Baptist or it produces another Church of God or another Church of Christ I'll tell you one thing friend it's a shame but if we're not careful the message people are going the same way we produce another another seven Thunder child and another perusia child what we need to produce are children that are filled with the Holy Ghost that are so filled with the power of God that they merge into the image of the son of man and the Lord God ties that burden around them oh if I could only give up this if I could only give up that if you get full of the Holy Ghost that power of God will burn that world out of you then the Lord Jesus girdles out around you and you say out of my way devil [Applause] watch this in the patmas vision voice of many Waters what does Waters represent if you want to mark it down Revelation 17:15 you'll find the Bible said Waters which thou sawest is thickness and multitudes of people are out of voice what a horrible thing for a drifting Soul on the sea of life no pilot to guide him a loose floating with the tides to hear the Roar of the great cataracts the false what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting yes sir we were all there at one time voice of many Waters what is his voice it's the Judgment the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age yes sir standing there the voice of the ministers Lord Jesus thank the voice of many Waters cried out in thickness and multitudes the voice of the Seven Stars in his hand to every Church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God baptism in jesus' name can the church say Amen speaking in tongues oh a lot of message folks sure couldn't say Amen to that but I can amen speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many Waters coming forth from this one that looked right like the son of [Applause] man oh Lord children the voice of the ministers preaching don't think this is the last time you'll hear me say these things this morning depending on your attitude and the way you take it you'll hear it again that's right if you hear it and line up glory to God when the resurrection takes place whether you're in the grave or in the sixth Dimension you'll be jumping and shouting out of there and glorifying God oh Hallelujah you talking about a time and we gather together and I will V join my voice with the rest of the voices under the message of the hour then we will unite again under the church age messenger the seventh angel and he will turn and present us as a bride to Christ Hallelujah it won't be just the voice of the preacher but as you hear it preach you go out and live this word then you become a lived voice you become a thunder in your own right you young ladies you young men you are also reverberating the thunderous voice of God by your life now listen to this what will it be to know that you said in meetings and heard that you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that you said in and heard the judgments of God preached and refused it the Great Falls just below you the great cataracts that'll take you to your Eternal Doom don't just think it's brother Donnie don't just think it's these other preacher Brothers don't just think it's your mama it's your daddy when your mama is Anointed by the Holy Ghost to warn you of the way you're going and if you're going in a way contrary to what your Mom and Daddy's taught you don't think it's just the voice of Mama the voice of Daddy it's the voice of many Waters his voice was the sound of many Waters watch this the church age book Waters what do the waters represent here in Revelation again he quotes it Revelation 17:15 the People The Voice the water rather that thou sawest was peoples and multitudes and Nations and tongues his voice was the sound of many multitudes speaking what is it it's the Judgment for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy Spirit All Through the Ages have testified not just preachers testified to Christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in the Judgment Against The Sinner who did not take warning the voices of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear yes sir those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of Jesus preach water baptism in Jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ but yet we have an element of people around this message that say the only voice of Jesus Christ is brother brandom so you see they don't even believe what he said himself every God call man that's a preacher is that voice let me go a little farther every holy ghost fil woman every holy ghost fil man is expressing that lived voice of Jesus Christ just be preacher standing that day it will be some of you that walked into Walmart and walked into Target and walked wherever you sisters walk and you bore the image of the requirement of your bridegroom this requirement is not because the brother Brenham had the idea it's God's requirement and they laughed and made fun of you and ridiculed you some of you have worked in public places and you've suffered reproach because of that word that's right one day you'll stand there in your voice by your life and they will stand and look at you all the names they called you all the things they said against you and that spirit in them of the devil have you the spirit of God in you and you will stand there by your lived voice and condemn them Lord God I don't want to be condemned that day oh Lord they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost wow the prophet didn't say they pushed play but they preached wow well I wonder where that's coming from them watch this angel of God I am merely just a mouthpiece for him and Moses was just a mouthpiece for him and Jesus was a mouthpiece for God and he died to redeem us sinners that the program of God might be carried on down through the age through the church amen and ministers that are consecrated to God become channels where God can speak through preach the gospel heal the sick show signs and wonders can I have a few more minutes of your time notice this and God said in the church first what missionaries or Apostles Apostle and missionaries I've told you T the same thing One S Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors God set it in the church for the perfecting of the church that's Divine gifts that God foreordained to set in the church see these are for the perfecting of the church Jesus now when I push play this is why I hear him say Well when I push play this is what I hear him say when I push play this is what I hear him say when I push play this is what I hear him [Music] say and I'm going to do it one more time Jesus speaks through his Pastor speaks through his teacher speaks through his sear his Prophet speaks through his missionary to the countries and so forth that's his [Music] gifts that he's put in the church so let me just go ahead and send a notification down to Hell go ahead all you demons down there and start dialing 911 because I'm going to tell you as hard as a devil has tried down Through the Ages he tried to burn them Holy Ghost Field preachers he tried to cut their heads off he tried to make it so diff difficult and so belligerent that nobody would ever want to be a preacher and some of their own Sons which watch their daddy's heads be cut off felt the call of God and they started preaching the same thing daddy preached and it's the same way down Through the Ages he tried to stop the men of God and he has failed he tried in the days of Luther when Luther stood for the truth and the Catholic Church threatened to take his life but it didn't make no difference why because Jesus said go Luther go and Luther said I'm going to go go go and Wesley went and Pentecost went and Malachi 4 went and I'm going and you're going and you're going why because the ministry of Jesus Christ must be on the earth L's we ain't knowwhere near are going to get done so we'll just find a place to get off and pick it up again Lord will it brother Tim prudy posted this quote I thought it was so outstanding I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stupid what a command what a Comm Mission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each Minister's called to stand where he would the works that I do shall you do also each Minister ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed wow can't you see why true men of God wish it wasn't their call I ain't trying to be like brother Ron Spencer I ain't trying to be like brother Tim I'm not giving a call to act like those Brothers I'm not giv a call Tack like brother Daryl I'm called if I'm called of God to stand and walk in the same footprints that Jesus did that's more than Healing The Sick it's to love those that hate you it's to pray for them that despitefully use you oh raising the dead healing the S oh yeah we we love all that but them tracks of Jesus led him to Calvary them tracks of Jesus led him to a forgiveness that people had never EXP experienced on the earth before I'm trying to close I am trying question answer 61 this is brother brandham now talking with some men in the brandom Tabernacle so they're having this men's meeting so there's preachers there deacons there so it's the men of the message not all of them a lot of the men of the message this message that I'm preaching is the true message of this day and it's the last message you see what I'm doing Brethren I'm putting you all the same place I am cuz you're just as much into it as I am you are messengers of this same message wow so you mean God didn't just call me to get up and introduce and and push play and I bury the dead marry the young dedicate babies I thought them synonyms that he used was describing the Catholic Church can't you see what those around the message want me to become like a priest I bury the dead I marry the young I dedicate the babies but I never do preach Sorry Devil you too late but don't I just get your mind oh this is all the preachers no it's not it's you and me and me and you and all the rest of those around the world that are part of the pride you see we are not going to have a personal Resurrection in Word of Life we're GNA have a personal resurrection and then we're going to do whatever people think we're going to do and then everybody else is going to follow us cuz we are the perfect church I'm the pastor of this church and I know there ain't one perfect person here be beginning with this guy right here that's why y'all y'all should be able to receive me so well I'm just a human like you all are Low Down Rotten sorry need grace mercy brother Donnie you sin oh no no no I don't go around fing somebody else's wife don't lie cheat still none of that but I still need the grace of God every day of my life it ain't what I do that gets me in trouble it's what I don't do for many of you you quit drinking smoking L you don't do that no more but you get so caught up in life you don't read your Bible every day and pray you spend more time on Instagram and and YouTube and Facebook and all that stuff do with your face in the real book aren't you glad it's still gir around you I'm telling you friends we've been a mess today if he hadn't clothed us with the right stuff came we bow our heads I want to be more like you Jesus I want to be more like you with our heads bowed how many would like to be remembered today before the Lord oh I know many of you Christians you're filled with the Holy Ghost you love him with all your heart but you want to see yourself a little bit more clearly in his word friends we keep on trying to perfect this old body and we ain't never going to do it God ain't wanting you to perfect your Humanity he's wanting you to control it it's not perfection it's subjection subjection is what we should be focusing on you'll never get it perfect as great as brother bram's Ministry was he never perfected his Humanity but he subjected his Humanity that's what God wants oh some of us are so opinionated and some of us are so flyy and we're this and that we let that dominate who we are and our fellowship of our brothers and sisters let the Lord Jesus just help us you see he himself went through that the prophet makes an astounding statement and mentions it several times he said even the Flesh of Jesus could not glorify in the presence of God don't you understand when he took on that human flesh it was a condensation for him he understands how many he wants to be more like him you want him to guard that around you his righteousness his Purity and you focus Lord what can I do what can I do Lord brother Donnie said it over and over again today everybody has a Ministry you do father I pray that you'd help each of us yes thank no doubt it's easy for many of these people to look say oh yeah brother brother John ain't no question about brother John's got a Ministry brother Jonathan I think brother Michael yeah yeah but brother Daryl these other brothers my you know brother Pete my I was so blessed by his sermon preachers come through oh there's no question about it boy I'm telling you what you talking about a Ministry but Lord help them to realize these sisters right here today the

congregation is them little young ones as they're sitting there and feeding them their food and they go to asking them all kinds of questions Carol reminded me the other day about Erica when she was I think she said she's about 4 years old and herica was asking and talking about serpent seed and Carol said she marveled as she heard her little four-year-old daughter talking about serpent seed train a child up in the way it should go if they can learn all the Disney characters what a shame it is Lord that many of our young people know more about Disney that they knew quotes in the message it ain't just our young people a lot of it is the parents faults the parents know more about Disney than they do the message they know every character of Disney they know all the Disney stories and all the Disney movies and could they even quote five quotes or five scriptures verbatim somehow they have the cop out well I'm not a I'm not a preacher so so I don't need to know it help them to realize that word is their ammunition against the devil on an everyday basis yes sir we don't just need the word to discuss theology we need the word to fight help us Lord are we so Disney oriented and all
