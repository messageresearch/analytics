[31:38] lifetime subject to bondage for verily
[31:42] he took not on him the nature of angels
[31:45] but he took on him the Seed of
[31:48] Abraham wherefore in all things it
[31:52] behooved him to be made like unto his
[31:57] brethren amen that he might be a
[31:59] merciful and faithful high priest in
[32:02] things pertaining to God to make
[32:06] reconciliation for the sins of the
[32:10] people may the Lord bless his words you
[32:12] may be
[32:17] seated I believe if we had a full
[32:20] understanding of these verses that we
[32:22] have just read our lives would never be
[32:25] the
[32:26] same two look at the stepping down or
[32:30] the condenscending of what our lord
[32:33] Jesus did for us I think it would set
[32:36] something within us that it would change
[32:39] Us by looking at what he become truly a
[32:43] revelation is something that it's an
[32:46] identifying and a making known The Book
[32:48] of Revelation of course the Greek word
[32:50] apocalypsis which is making known the
[32:53] other word that is used for Revelation
[32:55] is feneral which is to make manifest so
[32:58] it is something that declares or
[33:01] something that makes real I'm always
[33:03] Leary myself of any so-called Revelation
[33:08] that exalts human flesh and doesn't
[33:10] exalt the Lord Jesus I just don't
[33:13] understand that it's being Revelation
[33:14] from God but yet when I I look at him
[33:18] and see the condensing or the stepping
[33:20] down that he did and I think why what
[33:23] was the ultimate reason that he would do
[33:26] such a thing to prove that he could do
[33:28] it he's greater than that he doesn't
[33:30] just do things alone just to prove well
[33:33] I can do it I'll create a fish just so I
[33:35] can prove that I can I'll make a world
[33:38] so I can show that I can do it I'll make
[33:40] a sun I'll make a universe I'll make a
[33:42] moon I'll make all these things just so
[33:44] that I can do it just for the fun of it
[33:45] no that God don't do things in that way
[33:48] certainly to project himself and his
[33:50] characteristics is the things that he
[33:52] desires but you look at the overall
[33:54] picture of of him stepping down to
[33:57] become what he did and you think truly
[33:59] it was more than just to prove that he
[34:01] could do it it was more than just saying
[34:04] well I'm I'm going to do this so that I
[34:05] can show what I can do but it was
[34:07] something of a greater far more
[34:10] outreaching program that God had in his
[34:12] mind of course that was much of that was
[34:14] you and I that he desired to have a
[34:16] family you see he thought of himself and
[34:18] he not only thought of himself but he
[34:20] thought of you becoming tangible and he
[34:23] didn't want Just One of a Kind or one of
[34:25] this certain species that would be
[34:28] particularly perfect but he wanted a
[34:30] whole family an entirety of of of
[34:33] creation on the earth that would live
[34:35] like this and would be actually in the
[34:38] perfect image of a God man but think
[34:40] that God wanted to project it in such a
[34:43] way could have brought it by creation he
[34:45] could have said let there be and let
[34:46] there be another son and let there be
[34:48] another daughter and let there be
[34:49] another son and let there be another
[34:51] daughter and truly it would have been
[34:52] right there but the spoken word if he
[34:54] would have took his book of life the
[34:56] family Book of Life the Lamb's Book of
[34:57] Life which had the brides names written
[35:00] there inscribed before the foundation of
[35:01] the world and would have spoke them by
[35:03] the word and said let them be let them
[35:05] be let them be let them be but yet when
[35:08] he got done speaking there would have
[35:10] never been anybody to live outside the
[35:12] city amen there would have never been
[35:14] any Heathen of Psalms 2 that would have
[35:16] been given the opportunity to be able to
[35:18] make their choice in the time of the
[35:19] Millennium there would have never been
[35:21] millions of people of John 3:16
[35:23] Christians and that's as far as they
[35:24] would go so myself I'm grateful that he
[35:27] did didn't just call from The Book of
[35:29] Life and speak the bride's names and
[35:31] create them and leave everybody else out
[35:34] but it expresses a greatness of his
[35:36] being that he would go beyond his own
[35:39] kind and offer this grace and and Waters
[35:42] of life and mercy to those which are not
[35:45] of his own species of his own kind you
[35:48] know it expresses the grace of God that
[35:50] he would be so willing to condem sin to
[35:53] be made like un to his Brethren that's a
[35:55] great thing Amen to be become flesh
[35:58] because his brothers was going to become
[36:00] flesh that's a great thing but to extend
[36:03] Grace to a a people which are not even
[36:06] of your own kind to extend the the love
[36:09] and the mercy of God that when he died
[36:11] upon the cross and he would actually let
[36:13] them which are not of his own genos his
[36:16] own kind he would let them come and
[36:18] actually partake a a part of
[36:20] reconciliation and a part of redemption
[36:23] that he would let them come and have let
[36:25] them have a Salvation a salvation by his
[36:29] blood now think about it you know that
[36:30] the profound wisdom of God knowing that
[36:32] the brides names was on the book and
[36:34] that he would redeem them because only
[36:37] the elect can actually be fully redeemed
[36:39] but he would divide Redemption from
[36:42] salvation and let some folks be saved
[36:44] which are not redeemable and actually
[36:47] save them from their sins and save them
[36:50] from what they were born into and yet he
[36:52] come to save to save many of those who
[36:55] were not even in that Lamb's Book of
[36:57] life and give them the opportunity or
[37:00] you're talking about Mercy you talking
[37:03] about the grace of God friend and you
[37:05] sing how that God so desired to express
[37:08] himself in such a way and this is why we
[37:10] should never limit our love just to our
[37:12] family or just our church or just our
[37:16] message because we're not displaying the
[37:18] full attribute of God when we behave in
[37:21] such a way if you can love only your
[37:23] family and only your friends there's
[37:25] something wrong with your love if you
[37:27] can love only the folks that come to
[37:28] this church and even this message
[37:30] there's something wrong with your life
[37:31] you don't understand God
[37:33] [Applause]
[37:38] yet let me read this to you in the
[37:40] Masterpiece paragraph 79 The Perfect
[37:44] Image the God
[37:46] man The Perfect
[37:48] Image the God man amen God in
[37:53] aor had changed from Supernatural
[37:57] to the vision and the vision was
[38:01] projected into the image and the image
[38:05] was smitten so that the supernatural
[38:08] could taste the feeling of death God's
[38:11] perfect
[38:13] Masterpiece now as we mentioned last
[38:16] night truly the world the Jews even many
[38:20] that were not Jews that heard the
[38:22] Messianic prophecies they had heard them
[38:25] talked about for many many years and no
[38:28] doubt they had it figured out in their
[38:30] mind what the Messiah would be what kind
[38:33] of an individual he would be but when he
[38:36] appeared it was in such a simple humble
[38:39] way and if God had not broke past the
[38:42] veil of humanity it was so simple even
[38:46] the elect would have stumbled over it
[38:49] but God Desiring that the elect would
[38:51] see it so he opened up opened up and
[38:54] revealed a part of himself by which they
[38:57] would be able to connect and you think
[39:00] the perfect man now is not a man which
[39:04] is divine only but the perfect image
[39:08] that God had in his mind was a mixture
[39:10] of divinity and
[39:13] humanity and the world looking for a
[39:16] Napoleon a Hitler a conqueror that would
[39:19] be able to come down but when God
[39:21] projected that God chose through the
[39:24] simple humility of human weakness and
[39:27] human
[39:28] Frailty that God would allow himself to
[39:31] live in mortal flesh and the word mortal
[39:34] mean liable to deaths that God would
[39:38] humble himself to be a mere man and walk
[39:41] upon the face of this Earth he would
[39:44] humble himself to the death of the Cross
[39:47] he would humble himself to become a
[39:49] curse a sinner in the eyes of
[39:55] God it now what does that humility in
[39:58] turn do for us Lift us up and give us
[40:01] the big head I'm afraid we everen
[40:02] received it if it
[40:04] does I'd like to read to you again the
[40:06] scripture that we read last night in 2
[40:08] Corinthians 12:7 Paul after being can
[40:11] translated or carried by Vision however
[40:13] it was into the third heaven he said
[40:15] lest I should be exalted above measure
[40:17] through the abundance of the revelations
[40:19] that was given unto me a thorn in
[40:22] the in the flesh soul don't need a thorn
[40:26] Soul's converted but a thorn in the
[40:28] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[40:30] me lest I should be exalted above
[40:33] measure for this thing I besought the
[40:36] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[40:39] now you think of the of the the spirit
[40:42] of God moving on this man's heart and
[40:44] him being afflicted by this thing and he
[40:46] prays three times that God would deliver
[40:49] him but instead of delivering him God
[40:51] says I'm going to give you Grace to deal
[40:54] with this and he said unto me my grace
[40:57] is sufficient for my strength is made
[41:01] perfect
[41:04] in my strength is made perfect in
[41:09] weakness it doesn't even make
[41:11] sense how could almighty
[41:15] God and his great power be completed
[41:20] perfected in
[41:22] weakness and you you see friend the
[41:24] reason that it's so hard for us to
[41:26] comprehend is because we're thinking of
[41:28] the human side and we think of Heroes
[41:31] and we think of you know my goodness as
[41:33] a little boy when I was raised in a home
[41:35] that had a television so I knew all the
[41:37] heroes at my my time frame you know I'm
[41:40] sure they've all changed since now but I
[41:42] knew Superman and Batman and Tarzan and
[41:45] I've swung on the grap Vines we live
[41:47] back near the woods there in Kentucky
[41:49] and I've went out many a day and chopped
[41:50] out with an axe or a hand ax or
[41:52] something like that and cut a great Vine
[41:54] Lord some of these kids look at me like
[41:56] I'm from Prime evil
[41:58] time yes sir I've swung on many of them
[42:01] and screamed like a wild
[42:03] ape I have and many of you probably done
[42:05] the same thing and yet rode an old stick
[42:09] horse like the wrong Ranger and whatever
[42:11] more why because there something always
[42:13] in us that look for a hero not today
[42:15] they've got an NBA star or a football
[42:17] star or this star or that star I wonder
[42:19] who was better off me as Tarzan or them
[42:22] as some basketball
[42:23] player but you realize there's always
[42:26] something we look for heo but if we're
[42:28] not careful movies and books and the
[42:31] drama of the world will shape in our
[42:34] mind what a real hero is when in reality
[42:37] it's nothing but a fabrication of a
[42:39] bunch of devils that's trying to take
[42:41] away the truth of what a genuine hero is
[42:44] in the eyes of God and you see no doubt
[42:46] they had seen many of them I mean the
[42:48] back of me a different man that they
[42:50] felt like was a great hero in their time
[42:52] and they would all come and do the same
[42:53] thing try to liberate the Jews try to
[42:56] bring them a Time freedom but when year
[42:58] the Messianic promise comes on the earth
[43:00] and they are looking for a hero and God
[43:02] sends them a baby who in the world would
[43:05] ever think of that why why spend all
[43:07] those years growing up when God made
[43:10] Adam he did not make a baby he made a
[43:14] man why would God start then with this
[43:18] one and make him a baby that's
[43:23] right because all of his brothers
[43:27] was going to be
[43:33] babies all of his brothers was going to
[43:36] grow up as
[43:38] teenagers so he didn't want to skip the
[43:41] pre-teen years nor the know itall smart
[43:44] elic teenage
[43:46] [Applause]
[43:47] years I'm sure some of you never had all
[43:50] of
[43:51] that neither did he want to skip the
[43:53] early 20s why didn't God give him the
[43:55] holy ghost at 15
[43:58] why didn't God give him the holy ghost
[43:59] at
[44:01] 20 he wanted to live through the 20s he
[44:04] wanted to be mid 20s he want to come to
[44:06] the late 20s and then when he comes to
[44:08] the age of 30 which is the age of the
[44:11] office of the high
[44:14] priest then God chooses to give him the
[44:17] Holy Ghost praise the Lord so all of
[44:21] those years he lives a mortal life as
[44:24] Mortals would live Lord
[44:27] Jesus without the Holy
[44:31] Ghost I know some of our message folks
[44:33] have a hard time but I can't help it
[44:34] that's your problem at ain't M now
[44:36] notice here Paul says that my strength
[44:40] quoting God is made perfect in weakness
[44:43] and let me reiterate it again for those
[44:45] of you that W with us last night the
[44:46] word strength is dunamis which is
[44:48] ability inherit power power residing In
[44:51] A Thing by virtue of its nature now I
[44:54] want you to think if you would have been
[44:55] God and you would have come down and
[44:57] lived on this Earth for 33 and A2 years
[45:00] could you have kept who you were hid for
[45:04] all that
[45:06] time you see there's something about the
[45:08] vanity of human flesh we want folks to
[45:12] know who and what we
[45:14] are could we have kept it head would the
[45:17] devil know two days after you got here
[45:19] who you
[45:21] was I honestly believe friend Brother D
[45:24] before we come out I really believe with
[45:25] all of my heart God would do more for us
[45:28] and manifest himself in a greater way if
[45:31] we could learn to keep our mouth shut
[45:33] sometimes about what he deals with us
[45:34] about but God will show us a little
[45:36] something deal with us a little bit more
[45:37] go around telling everybody in the
[45:38] Brother come on now Church a lot of the
[45:41] things God don't want you to tell he
[45:43] wants it between you and him not
[45:45] everybody else but we want to brag about
[45:48] it and let everybody know what we are
[45:49] and we're cutting oursel off from
[45:51] further
[45:53] experiences but he lives such a life
[45:56] Veil in such humility that Satan looked
[46:00] right at him and never knew who he
[46:09] was so God's
[46:12] Dynamite is made
[46:15] perfect in weakness that's right tell me
[46:18] how how can it be a Son of God a
[46:20] daughter of God can get cancer in their
[46:23] body it
[46:25] rages it attacks organs tissues muscles
[46:30] bones their family sees them going down
[46:33] day by day by day week by week they're
[46:37] praying they're begging God God heal
[46:39] them God
[46:41] please but instead of healing God gives
[46:46] Grace and day by day their family
[46:49] watches them go down and go down and
[46:50] they're believing for a miracle asking
[46:52] for a miracle begging for a miracle but
[46:55] instead of a miracle God gives
[46:59] Grace
[47:01] amen look like to the world that's not a
[47:04] heroic
[47:06] death you know why we don't understand
[47:09] Heroes our mind is filled with Superman
[47:13] our mind is filled with Batman and Roy
[47:15] Rogers and all those sort of things come
[47:17] on now The Lone
[47:19] Ranger we need to get a bunch of that
[47:21] junk out of our mind and realize real
[47:23] heroes follow the word and they many
[47:26] times die died in weakness they died in
[47:29] humiliation they lived their whole life
[47:31] in humiliation and yet God said these
[47:35] are my
[47:37] heroes oh
[47:39] Hallelujah I wonder when we walk down
[47:41] the streets of gold and we go to shaking
[47:43] hands with God's heroes brother B said
[47:45] if you ever get there you'll walk down
[47:48] the streets of gold beside some of the
[47:50] weakest people that ever lived on this
[47:55] Earth but God Dynamite was manifested in
[47:59] the greatest Way by blowing up cardboard
[48:06] boxes which would be easier to blow up
[48:09] this morning this body of Flesh or this
[48:12] concrete building here
[48:14] blocks stick a stick of dynamite you
[48:16] wouldn't take a stick just take an M80
[48:19] firecracker and stick in my ear won't be
[48:21] much left right th which should prove
[48:24] the greatest power in flesh or a
[48:27] concrete block of red
[48:29] oak but God says that's not the way I
[48:31] look at it Donnie I look at it that I
[48:34] fill a human being with my Dynamite I
[48:38] load them up with
[48:40] dynamite and I ignite their fuse with a
[48:43] baptism of the Holy
[48:46] Ghost and every day of their life
[48:49] they're exploding bringing their flesh
[48:52] bringing their Ambitions bringing their
[48:54] desire bringing all of that and there be
[48:56] days that they'll actually fail there'll
[48:59] be days that they'll succumb to the
[49:00] flesh but the end result is the flesh
[49:03] will be absolutely
[49:06] overcome now you and I think oh no
[49:08] that's not the greatest power the
[49:10] greatest power is when God said let
[49:11] there be and the word went out of his
[49:13] mouth and an Adam
[49:17] split apparently he don't agree with
[49:22] you now here's the man who' done that
[49:25] and he told Paul he said Paul oh look I
[49:27] made the world I'm the one who made
[49:29] atoms I'm the one who created the
[49:32] universe but I have found the greatest
[49:35] display of my power is when I express it
[49:39] in human
[49:45] weakness my strength is made perfect in
[49:50] weakness and weakness is infirmity
[49:53] disease sickness
[49:56] infirmity of the body its native
[49:58] weakness and
[50:00] Frailty want of strength and
[50:05] capacity and truly Paul had a stick of
[50:07] dynamite to go off in his
[50:09] brain for Paul said in verse N9 he said
[50:11] unto me my grace is sufficient for thee
[50:13] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[50:15] most gladly therefore yes will I glory
[50:18] in my
[50:19] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[50:23] rest upon me look at this word rest it's
[50:26] to pick
[50:27] a
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:32] tent the hoopah has
[50:35] arrived Glory Paul said that the glory
[50:38] of God that God might pitch a tent over
[50:42] me here's the bride's tent meeting for
[50:47] him GL here's the third PO for the bride
[50:52] here's the t i long is when the almighty
[50:55] will pitch his te over
[50:57] [Applause]
[50:59] me but notice how you'll do it in
[51:02] weakness infirmities
[51:07] Necessities Lord now how many still
[51:09] wants the tent pitched over you ah not
[51:12] near as many interested now didn't think
[51:15] there would be now if God was handing
[51:18] out folks today God said I need people
[51:20] in Happy Valley I want somebody to go
[51:22] down the seeding and I want you to go
[51:24] down to Wala Lake I'm going let somebody
[51:27] walk on the
[51:29] water and God said I want somebody else
[51:31] to go over to the river where there's
[51:32] people out there fishing and I want to
[51:33] let somebody Walk On The Water there and
[51:35] I need somebody to go to the hospital
[51:37] cuz I'm going to empty out the hospital
[51:38] in Elizabethan and I want somebody to go
[51:41] to the medical center I'm going to empty
[51:42] out the medical
[51:46] center and then God would say now for
[51:48] the important
[51:51] things is there anybody that would be
[51:53] willing that if you got some terrible
[51:55] disease in I ch was not to heal you
[51:58] would there be anybody willing to Bear
[51:59] there for
[52:02] me would there be anybody left or would
[52:04] all of us be at the hospit Elizabeth and

[52:22] to walk on the
[52:23] river do we understand friends what
[52:26] greatness really
[52:28] is do we understand how God's
[52:31] dunamus is is perfected completed tellos
[52:35] brought to it finish the finishing of
[52:38] God's great creative power will
[52:40] consummate in a bride on this Earth that
[52:42] allows him to do what he
[52:46] chooses you see in a parallel of this in
[52:49] 1 Corinthians chapter 7:1 Paul dealing
[52:51] with the married man and woman he says
[52:54] to to shun or flee fornication
[52:57] we look at this Wednesday night Lord
[52:58] will let let every man have his own wife
[53:02] and he says go on down to verse two and
[53:04] verse three says that the man has not
[53:06] power over his body but the woman and
[53:09] the woman has not power over her body
[53:11] but the man so the marriage vow actually
[53:15] renders your control of your own body to
[53:18] your
[53:19] mate now that's the Bible right now this
[53:22] is even natural marriage this is why
[53:23] that we we do not believe in committing
[53:25] adultery or polygamy
[53:28] because your body don't belong to you it
[53:29] belongs to your wife or vice
[53:31] versa all right now if the natural
[53:33] marriage does that what about the
[53:35] spiritual marriage to Christ the word
[53:38] then if my body belongs to him and he
[53:40] chooses to allow a thorn a thorn to
[53:44] prick me do I have really any say think
[53:47] about
[53:52] it think about it notice in verse 10 I
[53:55] mean this this really done something
[53:56] something to Paul therefore I take
[54:00] pleasure in
[54:02] infirmities Lord have mercy I said it
[54:05] last night I said it again today I need
[54:07] help with this
[54:09] verse maybe all of y'all are there
[54:11] except for me so y'all pray for me that
[54:13] I'll get right but I ain't here yet I I
[54:16] I don't always take pleasure in
[54:18] infirmities I don't always take pleasure
[54:20] and things even when he assures me that
[54:23] he's mindful of it and he knows what's
[54:25] going on and he he's aware of everything
[54:27] that's happening I still don't always
[54:29] enjoy
[54:31] it but this Brother D was more than a
[54:34] scripture to Paul it released something
[54:37] to Paul friends we don't just need to
[54:40] hear the scripture quoted we don't need
[54:42] to just memorize it we need something
[54:44] released out of this word that Paul had
[54:46] released to him that will do for us what
[54:49] it done for him
[54:56] I take pleasure in infirmities in
[54:59] reproaches in
[55:01] Necessities in
[55:03] persecutions in
[55:05] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[55:10] am
[55:11] weak then am I wonderful strong
[55:17] hallelujah how
[55:20] so how
[55:22] so how can I be strong when I am weak
[55:28] how can it be that I'm getting
[55:30] greater when I'm getting
[55:32] weaker and
[55:34] acknowledging that I am more dependent
[55:36] on him than I've ever been in my
[55:39] life those of you here today in this
[55:41] service and you're lost I honestly don't
[55:43] know how you live one hour without God
[55:46] in your life well you say I'm not
[55:48] dependent on religion I ain't dependent
[55:50] on religion either I'm depending on a
[55:52] person I don't want religion I want
[55:54] salvation
[55:57] but the more I serve him the more I
[55:59] realize how much I need him I don't
[56:01] trust my decisions in life I don't trust
[56:03] my
[56:05] ability the older I get the more I feel
[56:08] like a
[56:09] child when it comes to him I
[56:15] mean well brother Don you're getting SE
[56:17] now I don't think it's that I think it's
[56:19] I'm learning how to
[56:21] surrender notice this in Hebrews 11:32
[56:24] Paul says for what I more say for the
[56:28] time would fail me to tell of Gideon and
[56:30] of Barak and of Samson of jepta of David
[56:34] also and Samuel and the prophets who
[56:36] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[56:40] righteousness obtained
[56:42] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[56:45] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[56:48] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[56:51] were made
[56:57] that's right God anointed Moses and he
[57:00] stretched his Rod over the Red Sea my
[57:03] done through Joshua the Great Signs and
[57:05] miracles that was God's power but God's
[57:08] greatest power and conquering ability
[57:10] was going to be when he projected
[57:12] himself in human
[57:14] weakness growing with a headache get
[57:16] sick get nauseated and vomiting and get
[57:19] weary and get get upset like we do and
[57:22] have frustrations in life and yet the
[57:24] whole universe was created by his word
[57:28] and when that word come down in flesh oh
[57:31] Lord when it was embodied in flesh it
[57:33] took on the weakness of
[57:40] Flesh look with me if you would in the
[57:42] book of Hebrews again chapter
[57:44] 1 look at what he was now amen Hebrews
[57:48] chapter 1:
[57:50] 2 Paul speaking about God hath in these
[57:53] last days spoken unto us by his son by
[57:56] whom he has appointed heir of All Things
[57:58] by whom
[58:03] also he made the
[58:06] worlds so the son the logos the logos
[58:10] was the instrument by which God made not
[58:13] World singular worlds
[58:17] plural and when that logos cond incend
[58:20] into the bodily form of a human being it
[58:23] took on such weakness amen and
[58:28] Frailty look at verse three who being in
[58:32] the
[58:32] brightness of his
[58:35] glory and the express
[58:38] image of his
[58:40] person now this is what Jesus was in his
[58:44] existence before his
[58:47] Incarnation the brightness of his
[58:51] glory my if we could have went back
[58:53] before the Throne of God and so the saw
[58:55] the mighty L God
[58:57] as God condens sins and goes to Breaking
[58:59] himself down into the realm of creation
[59:03] and as logos goes out of it and plays
[59:05] around the father's door as a little
[59:07] white light yet when that Loos is made
[59:10] human we never have one witness in the
[59:13] scripture that that white light ever
[59:15] emanate out of his fingers out of his
[59:17] hands out of his
[59:19] eyes as a matter of fact there's never
[59:21] any Earthly identification that that
[59:22] white light ever appeared when he was on
[59:24] the Earth
[59:26] the Lord that's greatness expressing
[59:30] humility now notice Paul says that he
[59:33] was the who being the brightness of his
[59:35] glory and the express image of his
[59:38] person Jesus was not The Express image
[59:41] of God's
[59:42] body cuz God doesn't have a
[59:47] body he was the express image of his
[59:50] person I love this word express it's
[59:53] character
[59:56] the instrument used for Engraving or
[1:00:01] carving the exact expression the image
[1:00:05] of a person or a thing a mark likeness a
[1:00:08] precise reproduction in every respect a
[1:00:12] fimile a
[1:00:14] fact Jesus was the fact of God in a
[1:00:19] human
[1:00:24] body glory to God hallelujah how many
[1:00:28] knows what a facts is when you take a
[1:00:31] document or a piece of paper and you run
[1:00:32] it through a machine human
[1:00:36] instrumentality and you dial a phone
[1:00:38] number and you send that person in a
[1:00:40] matter of seconds on the other end and
[1:00:42] they've got a fax machine and they
[1:00:44] receive that image on the other end
[1:00:47] except unlike human fax machines
[1:00:49] sometimes ARS are blurred and the images
[1:00:51] aren't clear but when God facts the
[1:00:54] logos and the logos came down to the
[1:00:57] Earth it was a precise image of the
[1:01:00] invisible image of
[1:01:03] God hallelujah the brightness of his GL
[1:01:06] the express image of his
[1:01:09] person so God fed himself
[1:01:26] let me let you in on
[1:01:27] something the faxes didn't stop at the
[1:01:33] River on the day of Pentecost there's
[1:01:35] 120 machines up there and they got a
[1:01:38] fact from Heaven
[1:01:41] too the same image not of God's body not
[1:01:45] of God's flesh but of God's
[1:01:49] person God faxed into Peter the image of
[1:01:53] the invisible God
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:04] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:02:06] and the express image of his
[1:02:12] person and upholding All
[1:02:15] Things by the
[1:02:17] word of his
[1:02:20] power now look this is not
[1:02:23] logos this is Rama
[1:02:26] look at the difference in Rama and logos
[1:02:28] logos is thought concept look at Rama
[1:02:31] that which is or has been uttered by a
[1:02:35] living voice that's
[1:02:37] right you see we can take the thought of
[1:02:40] God written down on paper and repeat the
[1:02:43] logos over and over and over and over
[1:02:45] again but you know when this word
[1:02:47] actually becomes real when it becomes
[1:02:50] Rama but it's spoke by a living voice
[1:02:55] then if God drops it in your heart and
[1:02:56] the doctors say you ain't got the two
[1:02:58] days to live but God drops it in your
[1:03:00] heart I am healed and RMA takes a hold
[1:03:03] of that word it don't make no difference
[1:03:05] what the doctor said or anybody else
[1:03:06] says why it is spoken by a living voice
[1:03:10] not just by
[1:03:13] memory we're depending friends too much
[1:03:15] I'm afraid on memorization of the
[1:03:17] scripture and memorization of the
[1:03:19] message and we need some Rama we need
[1:03:21] the word spoken by a live
[1:03:24] voice of our
[1:03:29] souls you see this word express here
[1:03:32] that Paul chose to use it's not used
[1:03:35] anywhere else in the New
[1:03:38] Testament it's not used anywhere else
[1:03:41] it's the Greek word from which we get
[1:03:43] our English word from
[1:03:46] character
[1:03:50] ABCs amen like ABCs and ones and twos
[1:03:53] and threes it's something by which is
[1:03:56] used to express an image now as a man he
[1:04:02] ate but by the word he created
[1:04:07] food now he came in the form of a
[1:04:10] servant but he's the express image of
[1:04:13] God he's the facts of God Amen but God
[1:04:18] faxed it into a human body and sometimes
[1:04:21] itd be the human body and sometimes it'd
[1:04:24] be the facts
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:35] Hallelujah
[1:04:37] notice Paul says in verse three who
[1:04:39] being the brightness of his glory and
[1:04:41] the express image of his person
[1:04:42] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:04:44] power when he had purged notice this by
[1:04:47] himself purged our
[1:04:51] sins not the blood of bulls and goats
[1:04:53] now the word Purge is expiated that's
[1:04:56] right expe and the literal rendering is
[1:04:58] having made
[1:05:00] purification of our sins totally
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:05] annihilated then what did he
[1:05:08] do sat down on the right hand of the
[1:05:11] magesty on high
[1:05:15] amen now how could this great
[1:05:19] person ever live the way he did as a
[1:05:22] mortal to teach us his principles
[1:05:27] he was the express image of God
[1:05:28] according to Colossians he was the image
[1:05:30] of the invisible God in him brought the
[1:05:32] fullness of the godhead bottle all these
[1:05:33] great things but yet as a
[1:05:36] man look at me in Luke
[1:05:40] 2:51 watch his
[1:05:44] condensation he went down with them and
[1:05:46] came to Nazareth speaking of Jesus going
[1:05:48] with Mary and
[1:05:50] Joseph and was
[1:05:52] subject unto them
[1:05:58] this one who was with the father before
[1:06:00] the world
[1:06:01] began and when he come down here in this
[1:06:04] earth he was subject to his stepfather
[1:06:08] by the name of Joseph and a woman who
[1:06:11] let him allowed him to be born concede
[1:06:13] from her he subjected himself to a
[1:06:17] mother that's right Jesus go over there
[1:06:20] Jesus do this Jesus bring me that bucket
[1:06:23] of water Jesus go out there and help
[1:06:25] your daddy Jesus do this Jesus go Milk
[1:06:27] The Cow Jesus do
[1:06:32] this if you had been God could you done
[1:06:35] that we're not even God we can't be tell
[1:06:38] told what to
[1:06:42] do thank you
[1:06:48] Jesus you think he humbled himself just
[1:06:50] becoming a man can you imagine spending
[1:06:53] all these years of your life life being
[1:06:56] told what to
[1:07:04] do so may all of us understand if he
[1:07:07] acted that way what's it going to do to
[1:07:08] me and you
[1:07:11] wonder you see if you don't like to be
[1:07:13] told what to do nobody's going to tell
[1:07:14] you to do that lets me know you're of
[1:07:16] the
[1:07:17] devil cuz that's the way the devil was
[1:07:20] and that's the way the devil is
[1:07:26] notice this he was subject unto them but
[1:07:30] his mother his
[1:07:32] mother kept all these say in her
[1:07:35] heart hold on you Jesus
[1:07:38] H and Jesus
[1:07:41] increased in wisdom and stature
[1:07:48] did he allowed himself to learn
[1:07:53] more wow
[1:08:00] when he come to this earth he said
[1:08:03] father I want to condens sin so low I
[1:08:07] want to step from the volume of all that
[1:08:09] I am and the volume of all that I know I
[1:08:13] want to subject myself like them erase
[1:08:17] from my
[1:08:19] existence all that I
[1:08:21] am and me knowing all things and hearing
[1:08:24] all things and being all things yet when
[1:08:27] I am born Immortal I don't want to be
[1:08:31] that I want to
[1:08:33] learn
[1:08:36] sir let the same mind be in you which
[1:08:39] was also in Christ
[1:08:43] Jesus you see friends where that know-
[1:08:45] it- all attitude comes from don't come
[1:08:46] from
[1:08:51] God and Jesus increased in
[1:08:54] wisdom and
[1:08:56] stature and in favor with
[1:09:00] God amen
[1:09:03] amen here he is acting as any other
[1:09:09] Mortal that actually is finding more
[1:09:11] favor with God as each day goes
[1:09:15] by that's staggering isn't
[1:09:19] it
[1:09:21] amen wake up
[1:09:24] devil you see this is why it burned him
[1:09:27] so bad yeah he looked at Jesus as a boy
[1:09:30] looked at him as a teenanger looked at
[1:09:31] him as a man and he said he looks just
[1:09:33] like ever other man eats Jewish bread
[1:09:35] eats Jewish meals he goes by the Tor he
[1:09:37] Minds his mama Minds his stepdaddy does
[1:09:39] all that how in the work of that being
[1:09:41] thing more than a man it was God hiding
[1:09:43] in human
[1:09:45] weakness Dynamite wrapped up in skin and
[1:09:48] flashed
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:57] Matthew
[1:10:01] 8:20 Jesus sath unto them the foxes have
[1:10:05] holes the birds of the air have
[1:10:08] nests but the son of man hath no word to
[1:10:11] lay his
[1:10:12] head he subjected himself to human
[1:10:17] poverty listen to me Happy Valley there
[1:10:20] is not a person here
[1:10:22] today who was as poor as Jesus
[1:10:28] was we'd call Jesus today a straight
[1:10:32] person be the kind of guy that you'd see
[1:10:34] hanging around downtown Johnson
[1:10:37] City with no place to go homeless we
[1:10:41] call it now most of you do you have a
[1:10:44] great respect for homeless
[1:10:46] people do you go past them and they
[1:10:49] stink they're not shaven they're not
[1:10:52] clean and you look at them and think oh
[1:10:54] my sorry thing you have no idea what why
[1:10:57] that individual's there come on now come
[1:11:01] on don't sit there with your
[1:11:02] self-righteous flare to
[1:11:04] me but Jesus had no home no donkeys no
[1:11:09] mules
[1:11:15] nothing 2 Corinthians chapter 88:9 for
[1:11:18] we know the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ this is the sad part
[1:11:26] that though he was
[1:11:29] rich
[1:11:31] yet for your
[1:11:34] sakes he
[1:11:36] became
[1:11:42] poor why was that
[1:11:44] necessary why was it couldn't he come a
[1:11:46] rich man he could have but do you think
[1:11:49] you'd ever convinced us poor folks would
[1:11:50] be acceptable at the table of a rich
[1:11:53] man so he come to the bottom that way
[1:11:57] everybody from the bottom up could feel
[1:12:00] welcome
[1:12:02] Glory he didn't come to the top cuz
[1:12:04] you'd never convince those on the bottom
[1:12:06] that ever be able or worthy to receive
[1:12:08] it so he come to the bottom and he said
[1:12:10] from the bottom I'll start up then the
[1:12:12] rich the poor the middle class the White
[1:12:14] Collar the Blue Collar the no collar
[1:12:17] they'll all be acceptable if they'll
[1:12:18] accept my
[1:12:22] Mercy now friends this is totally by
[1:12:25] Choice totally by choice this is not
[1:12:28] made totally by
[1:12:36] choice though he was rich yet for your
[1:12:39] sakes he became poor look at this word I
[1:12:42] can hardly read
[1:12:45] it to be a
[1:12:48] beggar to
[1:12:51] beg to be poor
[1:12:55] I've stood in India and seen them
[1:12:57] thousands tens of
[1:12:59] thousands sleeping in the major cities
[1:13:02] of Madras Bombay change of Madras and
[1:13:04] the other major cities of the world that
[1:13:07] I've
[1:13:07] seen thousands of them and if they die
[1:13:11] no big deal they just sweep them up like
[1:13:13] cattle the next day living in cardboard
[1:13:17] chenies I mean the main streets of these
[1:13:22] cities Jesus when he come that that
[1:13:25] would have been the type of person that
[1:13:27] he would have appeared to
[1:13:29] be right Jesus would not have looked
[1:13:31] like I do today with this three-piece
[1:13:34] suit on that's right nice shirt that's
[1:13:37] right nice tie he would not look like
[1:13:39] you sisters as far as the type of
[1:13:42] clothes you have on yeah where you could
[1:13:44] go down and buy you a nice dress and
[1:13:46] nice pair of shoes that's right but he
[1:13:49] cond sin to such a place in order to
[1:13:52] teach us real humility amen that it's
[1:13:55] more than words that it's
[1:13:58] actions now notice he says that Ye Ye
[1:14:02] through his poverty might be me well
[1:14:05] could he come and died as a rich man
[1:14:06] apparently not it was through his
[1:14:09] poverty the imagery that was projected
[1:14:12] through even this social economic
[1:14:17] weakness this type of a man is a leader
[1:14:20] when the priest are the great rich man
[1:14:23] when the high priest are the great man
[1:14:25] of clas
[1:14:28] right Jesus as far as they was concerned
[1:14:30] was a bastard anyway Oh
[1:14:35] my he was from
[1:14:37] Nazareth bad
[1:14:39] name his mother was a young girl courted
[1:14:43] by this older
[1:14:46] man their hist actually tell him that
[1:14:48] the Roman soldier B her and Joseph just
[1:14:51] hit
[1:14:52] it God let him be born with with this
[1:14:55] black name on
[1:14:56] him and then be born poor you wouldn't
[1:15:00] want to go see his place where he was
[1:15:02] born cuz there's a bunch of ox standing
[1:15:04] there and a bunch of
[1:15:06] donkeys they didn't have his little
[1:15:08] christening ground gown cuz he never had
[1:15:11] one but she was so poor she couldn't
[1:15:13] even buy no blue for him or no blanket
[1:15:17] but she took the old Ox wrap off of the
[1:15:19] ox's neck you imagine that old Ox out
[1:15:21] there sweating and working Ox hair all
[1:15:23] over it and she took that and grabbed
[1:15:25] her wrapped up her
[1:15:28] baby the greatest gift the world had
[1:15:30] ever
[1:15:32] known but it was veiled in weakness
[1:15:34] wrapped in weakness hid in weakness born
[1:15:36] under a weak name born under a bad
[1:15:39] situation and God said out of this I
[1:15:41] will start the new creation

[1:21:02] made a little lower than the angels for
[1:21:04] the suffering of death crowned with
[1:21:06] Glory and
[1:21:08] Honor that he by the grace of
[1:21:12] God should taste death for every
[1:21:17] man for it became
[1:21:19] him for whom are all things and by whom
[1:21:23] are all things
[1:21:25] bringing many sons unto
[1:21:28] glory to make the captain of their
[1:21:32] salvation perfect through
[1:21:35] suffering now watch when he gained a
[1:21:38] human rank on the
[1:21:40] earth he did not choose to be called a
[1:21:42] five-star
[1:21:46] general but he had Paul to call him a
[1:21:50] captain
[1:21:56] you see friends there's no hope for us
[1:21:58] to do this without a
[1:22:00] facts it's not in us it's not in any of
[1:22:04] us it'll produce falsehoods it'll be oh

[1:22:08] believe that bit more than the man and
[1:22:09] the moon does I said last night we
[1:22:11] cannot produce this only God can do if
[1:22:14] there's something about man when he gets
[1:22:16] something he wants to brag about it he
[1:22:18] wants to boast about it but if you ever
[1:22:20] receive that fact from heaven
[1:22:27] am to make the captain of their
[1:22:29] salvation perfect
[1:22:32] through dunamus logos

[1:27:17] the same message I got down the
[1:27:20] river but you're still you're looking to
[1:27:22] give an instrumentality and you're
[1:27:23] looking your failures and your
[1:27:25] shortcoming I ain't looking at that I'm
[1:27:27] looking at the expressed image of the
[1:27:29] character of
[1:27:30] [Applause]
[1:27:34] God I'm not
[1:27:36] ashamed to call you Brothers prise the
[1:27:40] Lord
[1:27:43] the then verse 12 saying I will declare
[1:27:47] thy
[1:27:48] name unto my
[1:27:50] brethren in the midst of the church
[1:27:54] will I sing praise into
[1:27:57] this of course if you don't believe in
[1:27:59] going to church I'm not sure how you're
[1:28:00] going to hear
[1:28:02] that I'd advise you if the church doors
[1:28:04] open three times a week if you live
[1:28:06] where you can you might ought to be here
[1:28:07] cuz Jesus might be doing the special
[1:28:08] singing on Wednesday
[1:28:14] night woo this one brother Lloyd that
[1:28:17] said this this wasn't hey that said this
[1:28:19] this was Jesus that said it I am not
[1:28:22] ashamed to call them Brethren and I'll
[1:28:24] declare thy name in the midst of the
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:31] church and again I will put my trust in
[1:28:33] him and again
[1:28:35] behold notice how he does this
[1:28:39] ah and the
[1:28:42] children which God has given me yes
[1:28:44] praise the Lord he doesn't stutter he
[1:28:48] doesn't put dot do dot dot do do dot do
[1:28:49] dot put some space between you and him
[1:28:52] but he uses a conjunction I am the
[1:28:57] children God help me Lord
[1:29:06] please for as much as the children are
[1:29:08] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:29:10] likewise took part of the same that
[1:29:12] through death he might destroy him that
[1:29:13] had the power of death that is the devil
[1:29:16] now you see the peculiarity of our
[1:29:17] Lord's coming was that his human nature
[1:29:20] was assumed
[1:29:22] voluntarily it was not made to be done
[1:29:24] you and I you and I we would never I
[1:29:26] would never want to become this to
[1:29:30] become from Holiness and Purity and all
[1:29:32] that is
[1:29:35] right but he
[1:29:37] chose to become this we were brought to
[1:29:41] this world without our will but he came
[1:29:43] to this world
[1:29:45] willing to become
[1:29:47] this oh notice verse 15 and deliver them
[1:29:51] who through fear of death are all their
[1:29:52] lifetime subject to bondage for he took
[1:29:54] not him not on that nature of angels
[1:29:56] which would have been the
[1:29:59] condescending but on him the Seed of
[1:30:01] Abraham wherefor in all things it
[1:30:03] behooved him to be made liken to his
[1:30:05] brothers and the word behooved is proper
[1:30:08] it was proper and fitting it was
[1:30:12] becoming of him to come and get the rest
[1:30:15] of the
[1:30:16] family cuz all their fax machines are
[1:30:21] malfunctioning amen and all these facts
[1:30:24] is the ability to receive Divine
[1:30:26] thoughts was projected from the mind of
[1:30:28] God when they was born on the Earth but
[1:30:31] all the communication lines has broke
[1:30:33] between them so God had to send a Divine
[1:30:36] mechanic on the earth in order to
[1:30:38] reconnect all the lives glory in order
[1:30:41] to make us recipients he did not come
[1:30:44] and bring the seed but he come that we
[1:30:46] might have life to Quicken the seed
[1:30:56] that he might
[1:30:58] destroy him that has the power of death
[1:31:00] that is the devil I love this word
[1:31:04] here the word that Paul chose to use the
[1:31:06] word destroy does not mean
[1:31:08] annihilate it's obvious the devil is
[1:31:10] still alive and busy and well but the
[1:31:13] word means to render
[1:31:15] inoperative to make of none
[1:31:21] effect Satan trying to jam him faxes
[1:31:23] every way he can he can't figure out how
[1:31:25] to do it he trying to stop you from
[1:31:27] getting he's trying to stop you from
[1:31:28] getting a s try to stop you from getting
[1:31:30] the Holy Ghost try to stop you from
[1:31:31] hearing the word he's tried to jam your
[1:31:33] facts line try to jam your image line
[1:31:35] try to jam it all made you a human being
[1:31:37] attach you with sickness attach you with
[1:31:39] all kinds of thing and in spite of it
[1:31:41] all you rise up and say blessed be the
[1:31:43] name of the Lord blessed be the name of
[1:31:45] the Lord hallelujah IJ and infirmity
[1:31:49] High pleasure and trouble and sorrow
[1:31:54] the facts is still coming I believe we
[1:31:55] got one this
[1:31:57] morning praise the Lord I believe we got
[1:32:00] a Divine fact for the presence of
[1:32:02] almighty
[1:32:05] God don't you see friends that's what
[1:32:08] the new birth does to your
[1:32:15] flesh that from the soul you can render
[1:32:18] this black dog an operative
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:27] which is a greater Victory than killing
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:36] it Lord
[1:32:38] Jesus let me
[1:32:40] close chapter 2: 18 of
[1:32:45] Hebrews in that he himself has suffered
[1:32:49] being
[1:32:51] tempted he is able to sucker or save
[1:32:55] them that are
[1:32:58] tempted you see Jesus entered into such
[1:33:01] a a real of Temptation that he actually
[1:33:04] suffered because of it the Temptation
[1:33:07] was so hard so arduous so difficult for
[1:33:10] him to say no
[1:33:12] to that he actually suffered
[1:33:15] it now all of us we're just humans today
[1:33:18] and we all know that there are degrees
[1:33:20] of
[1:33:20] Temptation there's things when you're
[1:33:22] tempted maybe to do something or say
[1:33:24] something wrong and it hits you as a
[1:33:26] fleeting thought and you know it's gone
[1:33:28] and that's that's it but then there's
[1:33:30] others of it that works on you and works
[1:33:33] on you and it gets harder and harder
[1:33:36] more difficult and you actually enter
[1:33:39] into a stage of suffering cuz you're
[1:33:42] battling this thing so
[1:33:44] hard and Jesus actually
[1:33:47] suffered when the women of that day
[1:33:50] would approach him or drinking or
[1:33:52] tempted to be the king of the Earth
[1:33:54] whatever it was he actually entered into
[1:33:56] the sphere of of Temptation so great
[1:33:59] that he suffered and he felt that moving
[1:34:03] on him just like any other human
[1:34:06] being and Satan looked at him and said
[1:34:09] there ain't no
[1:34:10] way there ain't no way that's
[1:34:13] God I anointed that woman to walk right
[1:34:16] in front of
[1:34:17] him and he like Peter looked and turned
[1:34:20] away but if he had been God he'd never
[1:34:23] looked looked when he walked by that
[1:34:26] that bar the other day and I told him
[1:34:29] corner and get you a little drink you
[1:34:31] know how wine is it'll calm you
[1:34:35] down I saw him lick his
[1:34:40] lips and I saw him thinking my it would
[1:34:44] help my
[1:34:45] nerves they ain't no way that's God dumb
[1:34:49] devil
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:34:58] Satan thinks Dynamite comes in a big
[1:35:00] truck marked on the side danger
[1:35:08] explosives but here was God's greatest
[1:35:11] power of
[1:35:12] dynamite and it wasn't marked on the
[1:35:14] outside danger deity enclosed danger God
[1:35:19] enclosed but it cried like a man tempted
[1:35:22] like a man
[1:35:24] hungered like a man that's right died
[1:35:27] like a man but raised like a
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:39] god you see friends what this brought
[1:35:42] God
[1:35:43] to being exposed to this
[1:35:49] feeling actually brought God to a
[1:35:53] greater feeling of
[1:35:55] understanding now not knowledge of
[1:35:57] understanding but a feeling of
[1:35:59] understanding a feeling of
[1:36:02] compassion now some of us here today on
[1:36:04] Mother's Day we aren't as happy as some
[1:36:06] of the rest of you

[1:39:37] those of us who don't have
[1:39:39] it may God help
[1:39:42] us to allow this mind when Paul says
[1:39:45] that let this mind be in you which was
[1:39:46] also in Christ Jesus the word is allow
[1:39:50] you see in order for us to think this
[1:39:51] way we have to allow it to be
[1:39:55] so we have to be trained we have to be
[1:39:58] trained to think this way cuz as soon as
[1:40:02] we break the womb and we start thinking
[1:40:04] as little children you watch your little
[1:40:05] children you watch them they feel
[1:40:07] Superior one to the other they want your
[1:40:10] attention they want the better popsicle

[1:40:13] dress the better doll why where it's
[1:40:14] born and breed in
[1:40:16] us and even after you're born again it
[1:40:19] don't come automatic
[1:40:24] I know I didn't title it thus but it
[1:40:27] could have just as easily titled last
[1:40:30] night and
[1:40:31] today epitome of the bride before the
[1:40:36] Rapture for believe it or not I have
[1:40:39] preached to you last night and today the
[1:40:42] closing facts and the final scene of the
[1:40:46] Gentile
[1:40:47] dispensation of a group of people around
[1:40:50] the world which will image enter into to
[1:40:53] the image of
[1:40:54] God mothers will do it and they'll give
[1:40:57] away their time and all this for their
[1:40:59] babies fathers will do it they'll not be
[1:41:02] selfish men that don't want to spend all
[1:41:04] their time doing what they want to do
[1:41:07] but they want to gift to their wife and
[1:41:08] give to their children come on
[1:41:11] man preachers that won't want to preach
[1:41:13] won't preach what they want to preach
[1:41:15] but'll preach what the flock
[1:41:22] needs right
[1:41:25] what is it friend it's Christ Living out
[1:41:26] from the very beginning let me just
[1:41:29] share this with you I thought I had last
[1:41:31] night in today's sermon already studied
[1:41:33] out I've been studying this week as I
[1:41:36] always do I had it named
[1:41:39] titled and almost ready to
[1:41:42] print until yesterday
[1:41:45] morning when I got up yesterday morning
[1:41:47] went downstairs and started studying the
[1:41:50] father sent me a fax
[1:41:54] yeah and there wasn't but one word on
[1:41:56] that fact and that word was
[1:42:01] weakness so I'm sitting there thinking
[1:42:03] what's that got to do with what I'm
[1:42:04] preaching see how Immortals
[1:42:07] are so I pull the facts out of the
[1:42:09] machine and I started doing a
[1:42:12] search and I looked into the Bible and I
[1:42:15] looked into the message and then I
[1:42:17] renamed my sermon and I started putting
[1:42:19] the scriptures in and quotes in and
[1:42:22] here's the product of the
[1:42:25] [Applause]
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:31] [Applause]
[1:42:37] fast I'm not the only one that can
[1:42:39] receive
[1:42:41] faxes you can receive them too maybe not
[1:42:44] to preach a seron but to speak a kind
[1:42:46] word to
[1:42:47] somebody maybe to give somebody some
[1:42:49] financial help that's struggling with it
[1:42:51] maybe to speak a kind word
[1:42:53] don't just let the preachers be the only
[1:42:55] one that's tied to God's fa machine but
[1:42:57] let your heart be tied so directly with
[1:42:59] the express image remember eternal life
[1:43:02] is living for others not for yourself
[1:43:06] there will be no record book by the DAP
[1:43:08] in heaven of all the great things we
[1:43:09] have done for oursel we are not rewarded
[1:43:13] for what we do for
[1:43:15] us that's the times that you've went and
[1:43:18] preach that you didn't want to go the
[1:43:20] times when you've sung when you didn't
[1:43:21] want to the times when you've come to
[1:43:24] church that you didn't feel like it the
[1:43:25] times you've helped others when really
[1:43:27] you was the one in need of help yourself
[1:43:29] that's right but there's a great record
[1:43:31] book that's kept and your facts in these
[1:43:34] documents back up are the presence of
[1:43:36] God and he's a good Record
[1:43:40] Keeper Lord
[1:43:43] Jesus I don't know what to
[1:43:48] say I just get so overwhelmed by your
[1:43:51] presence and what you've been saying to
[1:43:52] us in the last a little
[1:43:54] bit I hope they don't think this is
[1:43:57] me I hope they don't think I'm the one
[1:44:00] putting this together
[1:44:01] and I hope they're able to
[1:44:04] recognize the
[1:44:06] style of the Divine writer and what
[1:44:09] they're
[1:44:11] hearing Lord Jesus forgive
[1:44:14] us you have given me so much love and
[1:44:18] mercy and
[1:44:20] Grace forgive me Lord if I harshly
[1:44:23] condemn
[1:44:24] others forgive me Lord if I criticize
[1:44:27] and ridicule it's one thing if the word
[1:44:29] does it but I'm talking about
[1:44:32] me forgive me Lord if I have ever
[1:44:35] treated any of your people in a way
[1:44:38] that's Unbecoming to a servant of God
[1:44:41] not just your people but Sinners on the
[1:44:44] street you know I try to behave myself
[1:44:47] whether I'm it's lost lost people or
[1:44:50] church people or whatever it is I want
[1:44:53] you to be proud of the way I
[1:44:55] behave help me Lord I
[1:45:00] pray Lord Jesus may you touch each heart
[1:45:02] here
[1:45:04] today teach us how to Humble
[1:45:07] ourselves to get off of our high horses
[1:45:10] thinking we're this and that and the
[1:45:13] other forgive us God for flaunting vain
[1:45:18] flesh May our image be molded to that
[1:45:22] which fits you
[1:45:25] there's some here today who's never
[1:45:26] received that Divine fact of the new
[1:45:29] birth may this be the moment it'll
[1:45:31] happen to
[1:45:33] them I'm convinced that there are many
[1:45:35] here that have but maybe they need a
[1:45:37] renewing a
[1:45:40] refreshing May fresh facts come from the

[1:55:49] wouldn't want to be going into those
[1:55:51] situations
[1:55:53] but it reminds us of your condens saying
[1:55:54] and him going to Haiti is in no way of
[1:55:57] comparison you leaving heaven and coming
[1:55:59] to here yet it's leaving a safety of a
[1:56:02] nation that he's protected in and love
[1:56:04] of a home dare God a place to lay his
[1:56:07] bed his head rather on the bed and food
[1:56:09] to eat that is's familiar with dear God
[1:56:13] for the sake of your people for the sake
[1:56:15] of something being accomplished for the
