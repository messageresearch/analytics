he'd be standing up here tonight preaching met brother mental years and years ago and we've always had such a wonderful friendship I don't get seen that often but you know it is with some friends you have you don't get to see him very very often but every time you see him it's just like you just reconnect and there it is that's the way it's been my brother mental I want a pair of years ago and he took me around to preach in some of the different places and I just always have sort of admired our brother well Linda good to be here tonight praise the Lord thank you for being patient with us on the sound and the lights and all this new stuff we're getting used to so hopefully hopefully we'll get it all set here before long thank you for your patience Daniel chapter 2 verse 31. this whole world of ours is full of so much sorrow and difficulty and trouble and sadness and death and over 11 000 people lost their lives and as you know and the earthquake there in turkey and Syria and so much disease and heartache and just life itself so maybe for a little while again tonight we can be able to leave some of that aside and move into our future as Angel of the Lord till brother Branham years ago whenever he went to Africa and missed the will of God and picked up the amoeba thought he was going to die he was sitting in a tub of water praying asking God to help him and he saw these white pieces of paper and a hand tooken through them like that and like they made a a pathway up into heaven and the angel told him your way is clear and your future so if we can for a little bit tonight maybe we can lay aside our anxiety our trouble our worries of life and let's look at a little bit of our future because I'm telling you tonight your future is looking wonderful now I'm not a fortune teller but I am a future teller and if you're living for the Lord you're looking good if you ain't you're in big trouble so I can tell everybody's future depending on the way they're going to live let's read together Daniel chapter 2 verse 31. now this is the interpretation of the King Nebuchadnezzar's dream this is the beginning of the great Gentile kingdoms of the world and what God is showing this Heathen King the Heathen King has the dream but he doesn't have a clue what it means so God sends the prophet and the prophet doesn't re-dream it but he has a vision and then the prophet interprets the vision and this is where we pick up here in Daniel 2 31. thou O King saulst and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold now this was the king himself of course and the Babylonian Kingdom his breasts and his arms were of silver and his belly and his thighs of brass so he starts at the head and he starts defining it the way Daniel goes down as he does each one of these symbols which are symbolized by metal they're getting weaker and weaker and of less value but it's going to show the Babylonian the means of Persian come on down of course to the Roman at the bottom his legs of iron his feet were part iron and part of clay thou saw us till that a stone was cut out without hands which smoked the image upon his feet so notice where it hits him doesn't hit the image in the head it doesn't hit the image in the chest or the thighs but it hits the image in the feet and he said defeat that were of iron and Clay now iron and Clay is a mixture they're not there's no way that they can ever mix strong metallurgical mixed with dirt that's basically wet and moist so there's no way that it can go together so it shows a divided Kingdom there's where the weakness will be and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became now notice the stone came out of a mountain and it come in a condescended form and then it became a great Mountain you're talking about the condensation of God in the form of his son which was himself in humanity so he comes from himself as a stone a rock just a small rock and then once that rock destroys these kingdoms then that rock becomes grows unfolds into a great mountain and filled the whole Earth I made a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray it's just our heads together if you would Heavenly Father we're truly blessed tonight to be able to once again stand in your presence we thank you Lord for everything that you mean to us you've done so many wonderful things for all of us we stand here tonight Lord with breath with life we have a provision of clothes and food and so many things that you've given to us and we want you to know that we are happy to be your people the psalmist David said it so many years ago happy are the people whose God is the Lord we ask you tonight father that you would catch us up you see the hour that we're living and there's trouble and despair and Sadness and Sorrow and death and politically and religiously every way we look we can see the world is at its end it's at the terminating point of all these kingdoms and it's because soon and very soon the stone will come and destroy and annihilate everything that is of this present world we pray father that you would fall upon us while we're in this Gentile dispensation may we by the grace of God be able to not be destroyed by this Stone but our nature will be annihilated we will be born again in the image of God so we can be part of that great Kingdom speak to us to not father from your word we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated truly when God spoke to His prophets and these symbols it must have been very unusual to them and to the people that would hear them can you imagine being in the days of Daniel whenever this was written sometime after Daniel would have seen it and the people picking it up and trying to read and understand a stone silver gold brass iron clay what in the world does all that mean and what's amazing about it is that even though this was written over 2 700 years ago and yet to many people it's still just as much a mystery as it was when Daniel spoke at thin but yet God doesn't want it to remain a mystery we know that God desires for certain things in his word to be understood and truly this is one of them the stone does not represent Christianity it does not represent denominational systems it does not represent our church doesn't represent me or it doesn't represent you but it does represent our Lord Lord Jesus for he took on this form which was an Earthly image of course I find it so amazing that he humbled himself when he come to the Earth that he took on the form of the lamb and he was identified in the form of a servant according to the book of Isaiah he was identified as a sheep he was identified as a rock he was identified as a sacrifice he was identified at all these symbols that we could look around on the earth and think why in the world would he do that he did that for us you know it's a shame that man absolutely is totally lost without God and man has such a hard time trying to Humble himself and the great almighty God humbled himself so low that man can never get down that far it's just not any and you can see why that the kingdom of God is so misunderstood to the haughty to the high-minded to those who look look at themselves as being some great something to the world but we know that he reveals himself to those that will humble himself before his plan he's spoken of as the stone of course and the scripture to the Jews he was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense now notice this is the exact same symbolism that Daniel sees him and they look at him the Jews identify him and they said oh my there's no way this man will not have him to rule over us are you kidding our Messiah is not going to be coming from the Nazareth and down in Jerusalem born down there in that little place called Bethlehem the house of God's bread his mother was a spouse of Joseph and and she conceived him out of holy wedlock and for him to be king over us no way we'll not take that man to be our ruler but we will will we not but yet to them he was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense but to the New Testament Church he was the foundation stone that the building whole building of God is laid upon so it all depends on who you are and how you relate to the rock of God now he will fall on some people and crush them to powder but if we fall on him then we become broken and our nature becomes annihilated and we become part of the building so it all depends upon how we relate to this great Stone of almighty God the question is how do you and I relate tonight so here Daniel sees this image now before the cross and he sees it coming out of the mountain not youn out with hands must have been so perplexing to try to understand what does that even mean how could it be what is it and it comes out comes out of the mountain comes rolling down through hits the the image and the feet strikes it in the feet the feet combusting all two pieces the iron goes one way the clay goes another and when it does the entirety of the image falls down into shreds of gold and silver and iron and clay and there it lays smashed by what would seem to be an impossible Rock now it was not a mountain that hit it it was not a gigantic Boulder that was so big it would have took tractors and trailers and great big yuke trucks and a crane but simply a boulder that come rolling out of the heavens and hit it in the feet but John then rather Daniel sees the same thing John does and he watches as this Stone begins to grow what a what a strange thing it would have been for a prophet as he's looking there and he sees a rock and this rock starts growing growing and growing what in the world well why didn't God just come right out and tell him what he was because God runs his business the way he wants to now when he come the first time he did not destroy the Roman Empire as a matter of fact it looked like that the Roman Empire had the upper hand on him because he died under capital punishment and the death that he died was a Roman death it was not a Jewish death the Jews did not crucify their people the cappadocians did not crucify their people many of the Gentile heathens did not crucify even the worst of criminals but it was a Roman death so it looked like that Rome had the higher upper hand as we would say and even the Roman seal not the Jewish seal not the Syrian seal the Roman seal was what was on his tomb and it looked like Rome absolutely had the upper hand but we could go back to that tomb and see that he raised from the dead and broke the Roman seal and he showed right there one day he would annihilate the Roman Kingdom now since that time he and his servants had been hit in the Roman Kingdom up one side and down the other now they have had certainly a Dominion in the earth and they will get a mixture in the last days and they will mixed with the seed of man which is the representation of the clay in the feet so it's in the feet and it runs down to the ten toes which will be the the resurrection of the old Roman Empire in the ottoman Powers so they will rule as kings but they won't be Crown Kings which is a dictator so there was five toes on each foot which will be the ten kingdoms that that John saw in the Book of Revelation thank God a lot of this won't happen to the bride is already gone but we need to lay this out so you can see what's coming in your future so he comes first and he does certainly take a lick upon the Roman Empire and then the Roman Empire smites him and makes him to die and they think of course that they've got him so the first coming of Christ was not this falling of the stone that Daniel saw in this Vision but it was the coming of the Messianic prophecy of Psalm 22. now remember how we love Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want we all learned it when we went to Sunday school but I know that you're aware of it the psalm 22 precedes Psalm 23 and Psalm 22 which is the Messianic Psalm my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me so the Messianic Psalm 22 is what leads him to the Victorious place to become the answer to be your Shepherd of Psalm 23. you see the Lord Jesus would never have been able to been your Shepherd of Psalm 23 had he not fulfilled Psalm 22 understand your life and my life comes the same way sometimes we want to be a great Victorious church we want to be an overcoming church we want to be a great conquering church but before we can ever be that comes trials tests tribulation is that right hardship difficulty do we like it nope I don't like it a bit more now than I did when I first got saved I don't like tests I don't like trouble do you all like it any better I don't like it but if you do pray for me I don't like it one bit better but I know it's part of being a Christian I have to have trials but I'm always glad when they're over I have to have valleys but I'm always happy when I'm going out the other side anybody else feel the same way I know I know the prophet said you've got to have sickness on in order to appreciate Health but I've got to say I do appreciate Health better than I do sickness and I think I would be fine if I never had another dose of sickness the rest of my life if I never had another headache if I never had another heart day if I was never betrayed by another friend I think I'd be fine but yet we know it's part of the way this life works is that right so what are we longing for we're longing for that state of perfection when we will never have another trial we know it's coming and we know it's closer than it's ever been before but we know until we arrive at that hour we're going to have to fight hell but let us just say it this way we're going to fight hell and we're not going to let hell get by with it because hell we'll pay as long as we are here We believe We were born by the grace of God to torment tormenting Devils we're not just meant to go through life and hang our head and just barely survive pray for me I'll make it till Sunday oh no that's not the way I look at it I believe I was born to be such a Son of God that when I get up in the morning the devil says Dear God here he comes he didn't die during the night a heart attack didn't take him oh no another day was him on the Earth Yep devil here I come brother donius every day seemed Victorious no it doesn't there's days I feel like I've totally lost but you know what I'll still hold my head up because greater is he that is in me that he that is in the world I have disappointments I have days I don't feel Victorious I have days I feel like man I don't think I made no dent in hell at all but when it's all said and done I didn't bow to the devil I didn't bow to Leia to see it I'm still in love with Jesus so whether I feel anything or not that don't matter whether it feels like overcome hell or not that don't matter because at the end of the day I'm still saved I'm still Sanctified I've still got the Holy Ghost and hail trembles when I pray well I wish somebody would preach with me tonight I'm just talking about a Christian a preacher being that way but when the weakest Christian gets down on their knees to pray Devils begin to shake and tremble because you have got power with god oh yes I don't feel it you don't have to feel it it's because of what he's done in You by the new birth you've already got this rock inside of your soul Hallelujah [Applause] so the first coming was not the Stone Kingdom so it awaits in the future at the second Advent of Our Lord notice now in verse 44 of Daniel chapter 2. in the days of these Kings now Daniel was like some of the other prophets that God would show him a condensed form sometimes of a vision like chapter 2 here and then he would send him over to chapter 7 and he would expound a little bit more on it then he'd go to chapter 10. and he was going to bring it into he goes and he'd bring in the two horns and he would prophesy about Antiochus epiphanies and he would go to all these symbols of a goat and a he-ram and all that sort of thing and he bounced kind of back and forth and Prophets could only say of course as God gave it to him but notice this in in Chapter 2 in the days of these Kings so again we come back to a certain time frame so the Lord Jesus could not come as the mighty Messianic King that the Jews are looking for they were looking for the son of David so it was a dispensational time Idol and they had it in the wrong dispensation they did not understand that he must come first as son of man then come back on the day of Pentecost as the Son of God and then in the Millennium he would come as son of David is that right but what they're looking for and you know you can't really blame them because they would take the prophet's quotes of the Old Testament they would take Genesis 3 15 they would take haggai 2 7 Zechariah 14 7 they would take Zephaniah they would take you know so many of those things and they would put them together and you can see why they were looking for a mighty king So when he was born a poor baby born wrapped in Swan and clothed and laid in a Manger there's no way that fit with their idea there's no way that fit was what they had always been taught they're looking for a son of David to come riding on a big white horse and he's going to knock down all Rome and he's going to give Israel back their Homeland and the Romans are going to die and here he comes pushed from Pillar To Post a weak looking sword of a guy this is what caused John the Baptist to doubt John introduced him he said he's coming and he's going to have a my big flame in his hand a fan and he's going to Fan down through there and the chaff is going to come blowing away where's John where's John quoting from the scripture we just read in the Book of Daniel so John said boy when he comes I'm telling you what everybody better get out of his way and when he comes they push him over this way and they push him over that way and he stands up there my was humble and poor and didn't have no Kingdom didn't have no horses didn't have no soldiers and his army was fishermen ignorant and unlearned couldn't even sign their own name and John the Baptist sent some of his followers and said ask him if he's the one or have I messed up should we look for another you imagine the man who introduced him now Lord willing we'll get to that Lord will maybe on Sunday morning but John actually had a breakdown inside the prison and John is looking at what looks like reality to him and it does not look like the Lord Jesus is this Messianic prophecy he just can't believe that that's him so Jesus said hang around for a while and go back and tell John what you saw once you notice he didn't say we're polishing our swords we're getting our helmets ready we're getting all of our Shields ready but he said tell him what you saw the blind see and the lame are walking and the poor have the gospel preached to them so you imagine whenever he comes back then it hits John oh I see I had the dispensation Place wrong I was taking the scriptures of Daniel 2 and Daniel 7 and I was supplying the stone Kingdom when it was not the stone Kingdom it's the spirit indwelling kingdom That's Where It's At oh okay I see it now so John could go right on and let them chop his head off and knew that he had introduced the Messiah at the right time you see God's dispensations aren't always visible to the unlearning they're not always visible to the carnal mind of man and this is why it takes Revelation and the church said now watch in the days of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom in the days of those kings the particular Prophecy of the kings of Daniel chapter 2. now this of course was not in the Advent of Our Lord at his first coming which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people now what Daniel is unfolding into King Nebuchadnezzar coming on to the Book of Daniel here is that it came from the Babylonians and it's going to go to the means of Persians then it'll go to the Greeks and then it'll go to the Romans so what's it doing it's going from one people to another people to another people but Daniel sees him this Vision when this kingdom comes it will not be turned over from the people of Christ to somebody else and then somebody else and then somebody else but once Christ ever gets this Stone Kingdom it will never be turned over to anybody else it'll be his and his only from that time so that's who you're serving tonight notice in the Kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all those kingdoms and it shall stand forever so other kingdoms were raised by what human Ambitions human Ambitions so one king would get this ideology about himself he was the greatest king of kings and all my he was the great this and that and the other and it would go from one man to another man a man with an ambition a man with an ideology that he was supposed to do this and that and the other but the kingdom of God is Not established any such way now what's really sad is is when you see preachers that get inside and in and around this kingdom of God and they go to bring in the mannerisms of the old Gentile World Order kingdoms and they think God is looking for men who have ambition no God is looking for men who will lose their own ambition and tie in with the ambition of God what I've always wanted to be this and I've always wanted to be that well more than likely God will never use nothing you always wanted to be God will get rid of that and make you what he wants you to be well praise the Lord but you see what many people do they fall right in the way of the Gentile Kings before them and they fulfilled the repeat of what Daniel saw and they bring it into every move of God that's been down through the church ages I hate to say it but it's right around our message as well you take a man with an ego a man that wants to be a big this and that and the other and you watch trouble will find him he'll split he'll Splinter he'll divide he's got this ego he's got this thing although don't get quiet on me gone ain't looking for for song leaders and for musicians and singers that's got this great ego about themselves God wants people to say Lord I can't do it Lord I don't know what to say I ain't no speaker Lord I ain't no great singer Lord I'm not a great Mission musician if you can use me use me Lord but I can't do nothing on my own oh but be afraid to then hang glory to God let me edit here hey yeah we're not voting on something we're not auctioning something all we're looking for people who want to die to their own ideas their own agendas their own motives and become part of the greatest Kingdom that ever will be on the face of the Earth now notice so it will not be left to other people so we are the finale of all the kingdoms of the world notice in verse 45 for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hand so there was no hands that was in here so it wasn't like that the people cut it out and the denominations cut it out and the systems cut it out and with these overseers and this bishop and this and that and the other no it was not cut out by men let me tell you some friend if our church is made by man it'll only be a matter of time it will collapse any church that is started because a man has an ambition it may go five years it may go ten but it will run its course because God's true church is not started by any man the way I look at it years and years and years ago before you all ever knew me and before I ever knew you whenever this church had its original Roots over on Roan Hill some of you all were there I wasn't and that was not them people that wanted to start that church I believe it was God that led them to start that church then when it moved over to Happy Valley changed the name and took on a different look in a different building and the ministry changed down through the years I don't think it was them people that wanted to do that I believe it was the Lord that did it so you see when Satan attacks a church that God himself set up then the people ain't really attacking you they're not attacking me they're attacking God himself now there's a difference in God starting a church in men starting a church and there ain't no question about it a lot of men down Through the Ages and started churches but the Bible tells me except the Lord built the house those who build it labor in vain so myself I ain't looking for a man-made church I ain't looking for a man-made system I want a God made church I want a God made Mountain that I can run to and oh I wish somebody would preach with me tonight I want to be able to confide and something that is stronger than that the strongest preacher in this message the man with the greatest gifts the man who has the greatest ability to speak I still don't want to tie my soul to any human being all men will let you down all men will disappoint you there's only one place that you can put your ultimate confidence and that's in the rock of our Salvation the Lord Jesus not done here Reagan not some other man the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it breaking pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation sure now notice again Daniel 7 13. and I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man now watch this the son of man you can imagine what the Jews when they hear the Lord Jesus use this term when he comes to the Earth it ain't no wonder they got so mad now this is a common term to us son of man we've heard it for years but can you imagine being a Jew you only knew that reference was used in Daniel and in Ezekiel and a few of the prophets and here stands this man with an illegitimate birth supposedly a poor no schooling no education and he stands up and calls himself the son of man you imagine them looking at him with anger and Furious son of man who does he think he is that was referred to Daniel and Ezekiel the son of man the son of man was the one that stood by the most high God who does this man think he is it wasn't who he was thinking he was it's who he knew he was now watch Daniel sees the merging together of his Humanity and his divinity what's the terms that he uses one like the son of man now here's his Humanity the word son in the Hebrew is been so b-e-n so it would be so and so the bin of Donnie or so and so the bin of John which was son of so this name identified the Tabernacle of God as the son of man isn't it amazing the son of man so he takes upon himself this title the son of man oh God help us but notice word Daniel sees him the son of man came with clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days so he sees the visible appearance of what it looks like a human being surrounded in clouds and then this human being surrounded in clouds goes and walks into the presence of the mighty Elohim the Eternal himself and Daniel says how can that be a man ever to walk into the presence of the Mighty God so Daniel's looking and he sees the merging together of his humanity and his deity and he came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near so here comes the cherubims and the seraphims and who are they they are the ones who stopped the approach remember God telling Lucifer that thou art the anointed cherub and I have set thee soul the anointed cherub was the one who stopped the approach Lucifer in heaven was God's right-hand man any other angels of lower degree that approached the Throne of Elohim Lucifer would have walked up before them before he fell and he would have stopped them because he stopped the approach and if Elohim allowed the angels to come they came through the gate or the entrance of Lucifer he had a great position but in his pride he got lifted up because he felt like he could do a whole lot more than what God was letting him do oh boy and here Daniel sees this son of man doesn't know him by name now he never was allowed to mention the name of Jesus but he sees him as a son of man and he sees as he approaches and then someone Angelic beings come and get this what looks like a human just a mere human and Daniel Sanders said how can this be a mortal and he's surrounded by clowns Heavenly Witnesses and he comes up to the approach of the Ancient of Days and the cherubims and the seraphims and the zooms and they come and they meet him at the gate and they take him into the presence of the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him so his Humanity being the son of man his deity being declared by the way he traveled Hallelujah his Humanity was the title of son of man but his divinity was revealed by the way he traveled so will yours be after a while they see millions of people have died billions of them down through time and they've left the Earth by the channel of deaths but one thing that separates the seed of God from the rest of other human beings is the means that they travel you see they don't go to paradise they do not go to Shield they go into that sixth Dimension and there they wait they go into a theophany body so it identifies they also are from deity hope you understand it tonight there's a part of you that's just as human as it can be we all can say Amen to that can't we but if you're born again tonight of the Holy Ghost there is a part of deity that lives inside of you and I it ain't the deity that causes our problems it ain't the deity that causes our difficulties somebody say Amen it is our Humanity it is our old flesh it is our old human Spirit oh my but one of these days I will be identified who I truly am it'll be by the way I travel by the way I travel amen hallelujah for what did Paul say that by by the grace of God we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye for the dead and cross shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and we are going to be caught up you'll be known by the way you travel you won't have to have a plane ticket you won't have to have a space shuttle ticket you'll be known by your true identity that you are part of deity you are going to travel the way he travels you are sons of men and Daughters of men but one day you're going to be identified in the clouds hallelujah hallelujah will be identified by our theophany body you see John seeing the same thing whenever he sees him in Revelation 1 8. but here Daniel sees him veiled not in Thunder heads not in wispy white clouds but in Shekinah or the Hebrew word shakanai he sees him surrounded by the Shekinah of God and he thinks How can any man ever be surrounded by the Shekinah Glory of God if we can look beyond our Veil tonight if a person that's in this building filled with the Holy Ghost you've already got a part of that Shekinah yourself is that right oh my God you see our lord Jesus used this term when he came to the Earth 82 times in the four Gospels 82 times apparently he wanted somebody to know who he was well I'm glad I'm one of them somebodies now he could have called himself so many things and yet he chose knows to prevent himself a son of man of course we realize that the the appearance of him and the last States Luke 17 30 is what causes such confusion again because people take the same title and they think it applies to the Lord Jesus in the reappearing of his own Corporal body but the revealing of the son of man of Luke 17 30 is not the second coming in his Corporal body it's his second coming and the revealing of the son of man not his Corporal body when that comes that will be the Rapture praise the Lord but truly as it was in the days of Sodom thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed is that right and then of course in verse 30 tells us all of that and then he reminds us down below there remember Lot's wife it was in the revealing of the son of man when he made himself known to Abraham and lot and his wife left the message they left the message and went to Sodom isn't it amazing Jesus never did save remember Abraham's wife remember Jacob's wife remember Isaac's wife remember Joseph's wife but why did he say remember Lot's wife it was a sign in the last days look around we are saying mister and miss a lot pulling away from the message of the hour and what's he saying to us remember lot's why why he don't want you to be identified with that he don't want me to be identified with that but what what are we doing we're staying right there Hallelujah what's the original message of the hour we are not leaving our Oak Tree in the plains of memory we are there waiting on God oh it may get hot it may get dry there may be tests and there may be trials but I'd rather have a hot day in the plains of sheikim than I would living down there in the well-watered plains of Jericho are living down there near the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah you can have Sodom you can have gamara Give Me Jesus you can have the world you can have Leia to see her give me Jesus if I've got to live up here under this oak tree I'll do it I'll do it let it get dry let it get hot let it get difficult but give me Jesus Give Me Jesus he's all I need watch the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24. 27. for as a lightning cometh out of the East and shine us even into the West come us out of the East and shine us even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be so it will come from the East to the West and of course people have quoted this for years and years since he said it two thousand years ago and they're looking for this to be applied at his second bodily coming that's no son of man that's Crown King Son of God so the son of man coming can't you see why Satan wants to take you away from your inheritance he's trying to get you out of your inheritance what is our inheritance our promised land is the message of the hour feeding on Heavenly Manna baptized in the Holy Ghost by the spirit of God and how will he be identified by the way we travel so you see in the days of Luther this horse and buggy as it moved on up it moved beyond that and come on up to the airplane age but we're beyond the airplane now well you know the other day whenever the FAA one of our brothers told me here last night that he took him about 30 hours to travel from out in Tucson because the FAA had a glitch in their software well that's kind of the way it is whether all these churches around native they've got a glitch on their software well headquarters say we can't preach this no more and not no more I'm so glad I ain't got no software to get glitches because if you got it you no doubt we'll get glitches come on say Amen but I'm so glad that we are hooked up straight into heaven and we don't have to go through no Heavenly all glory no earthly headquarters but we've got a Heavenly tie and we ain't got some scientist sitting back somewhere to say you know well you can't say man or women no more we can I know a lot of them don't know what a man is and what a woman is they call it a it or a Shem or a Herm or whatever they call them but my Bible still identifies male and female well come on preach brother Donny I'm going to my Bible still identifies there is a church and there is a pride there is a first resurrection and there is a second Resurrection and you are going to be identified by which one you live in and which one you get up in okay notice Daniel 7 13. I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him they brought him near before him and there was given you see the trinitarians were wrong and the Jesus only were wrong too but the truth always lays in the middle of the road now I was trinitarian years ago and I came from that side of the ditch and I became a Jesus only now the sad thing about it is we have a lot of message folks that are Jesus only but because there never was in Pentecost they don't know what Jesus only is so when they hear you preach the Divinity of the Lord Jesus they're with you but it stumbles them when you preaches Humanity they cannot take him when you say sit down with a headache why they're Jesus only so I used to preach I used to believe Jesus was his own father I believe that Jesus was at all don't you come and tell me now then I remember it years and years ago Harry remembers the meeting where we was at and there's one of the brothers that we fellowship with and he began to see a little bit of light in this truth may be known he may have stumbled on it in the message because I found out a lot of the people I was preaching for they secretly was reading the message of the hour I'd hear him preach kinsman redeemer I'm hearing my my brother King a man down in Yeager West Virginia and I hear that man he'd preached about Ruth and he'd preach about Boaz and he'd preach about I'll say where in the world is that man getting that well I found out where he was getting it I found out with some of them guys that I was fellowshipping with God but you know what once they found out that I found out they didn't want nobody else to found out what I found out so they sure didn't want me telling where they got their resource well I'm the kind of man I want to let you know where I found this out I didn't find it out in any organized religion I didn't find it out for my daddy God bless him I didn't find it out for my uncle for my grandpa I found it out from the prophet that spoke of the Malachi 4 and I want to point you to that same way and you need to be feeding right there on that same message hmm so they bring the son of man to the Ancient of Days and then there's given him who the son of man now the millennium is the continuing of what God Said in the seventh day in the Garden of Eden Adam called God out of his Shabbat in the Garden of Eden and God put his millennium on hold so no individual has ever lived to be a thousand years old but they will in the millennium so the millennium is the old Sabbath the seventh day of the Old Testament now watch this and there was given him Dominion so who given who the son of man who is who the Lord Jesus um remember when Jesus stands and says after his resurrection all power has been given unto me show me where he says that before he dies you'd be better off to spend more time into the holy book instead of Facebook praise the lord well I just throw that in for good measure no charge you see he could not stand and say that until he had completed the atonement then all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me now watch there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom given to him how could you give something to someone who already has it what is this it's the sonship of God not another God not another person the same God in human form I said brother Dory that confuses me why why should it you've got a soul you've got a spirit you've got a body have you ever seen yourself anybody here ever seen your soul what about anybody else's soul have you ever seen your spirit have you ever seen anybody else's spirit what do you know most of your body right why is that confusing and yet you take my spirit out of my body my gray matter all that matter will still be in my brain I will not be able to reason I will not be able to think I will not be able to have a conscience why because my spirit contains those five inlets and it runs in on my brain matter runs in the cerebral the stem down through the back and all that it tells me what's to do so when a person goes out of their mind what do they lose part of that spirit I just want somebody this crazy age that we're living in they've gone out of their mind their spirit's all messed up well praise the Lord and yet whenever the Lord Jesus come to the Earth what was he he come from the heart of God I came forth from God and I go back to God so what was he he was that invisible part who is the father God the invisible God's not an old man sitting in heaven you don't find that in your Bible when John looked in the Book of Revelation he said I saw one and one Throne that wasn't a big throne and a big old man on it another little guy said over here and another little guy called the Holy Ghost over there if there's another God in Heaven Beside the Lord Jesus he's sitting on the floor because John only saw one Throne there ain't no big throne and no little Throne there's only one throne and he's the one sitting on it don't you understand in the Millennium he's given this Dominion don't shut us down also in Corinthians where he said when it's all said and done he will turn it all back over into that great invisible life that God may be all in all and there to be the Lord Jesus setting on the throne in the seventh day and and in the eighth day as well surrounded by what father God which has never been seen and never will be will be that's a direct quote and there was given him Dominion and Glory and their Kingdom that all people Nations and languages Shall Serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed so in the Millennium will be Nations and peoples Ethiopians Sioux Indians Cheyenne blackfeet Europeans black white red Chinese Japanese all kinds of nationalities in the millennium praise the Lord notice verse 25 and he shall speak great words now here we come back into the move of the Antichrist against the most high and shall wear out boy I can sure identify with this and shall wear out the Saints of the most high how many ever just gets wore out with life just things you deal with from day to day and it ain't like you're quick I'm I'm fixing the backslide oh I'm going back to the world oh a real child of God filled with the holy ghost thing going back to no world there ain't no world in them but they do get wore out they get worn out with struggling and they get wore out with sickness and disease and battles and one disappointment out of another but I want you to notice that Daniel never said that he ever got a one of them saints he just said he wears them out what I think of it ought to be the other day that we ought to wear him out too I'll tell one thing as long as I'm here on the earth I don't want the devil sitting down there in hell with a big glass of sweet tin of strawberry moon pie land on the other side of his recliner said well Dawn is up here he ain't causing me no trouble I want how I want hell to know that I've lived I want hell to know that I've been on the Earth but brother Donnie you're an old man yeah but I'm still kicking and I want to be like oh Uncle Buddy Robinson I'll tell you what I'm going to stay here cause I'm so full of the power of God and I'll now on him if I lose my teeth on all on him with my gums and I'll be left you whatever I've got left I'm going to make him pay if I roll out here in a wheelchair and I can only say Hallelujah Jesus is alive Jesus is Alive and y'all sit there and look at me as a poor old Feller don't poor old Fowler me I want to keep on saying it because I know one day it'll change me back to a young man I will be revealed but the way I travel I'm fixing to travel like a fault forget the car forget the airplane forget the rocket I want to travel like assault in a moment and they're trying kind of an eye hmm and shall wear out the Saints of the most high and think to change the times and laws and they shall be given unto his hand until a Time and times and the dividing of time three and a half years time singular times double oh my and then we come down to three and a half years but the Judgment shall sit oh and they shall take away his Dominion I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them and they shall take away his Dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most and Satan wants to tell you you ain't never going to get nothing you ain't nobody there ain't no need for you to even try he can read this verse he's been reading a lot longer than I have he's doomed his days are numbered but yours aren't Oh Glory to God his days are numbered but your days are not numbered notice what's going to happen God will take away his kingdom and give it to the people of the Saints of the most high the ones he's lied to the ones he's telling why you're worthless you're no good you've messed up so bad God will never forget why God don't love you God don't care for you and God send children honey I love you you're my bride I love you I'm fixing to give you the whole thing I'm going to give you the very Kingdom you're married to me already an invisible Union but before long you're going to set with me on my Throne you and I was going to rule together oh Zechariah 6 12. speak unto them unto him rather saying thus Speak Us the Lord will hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the Lord that's amazing to me when you look at the time frame how that God would sometimes have these prophecies it's Prophet sacchariah is one of them haggai too but God would hide things that they would say and they would prophesy about things that was going on right then current events and God would slip in a verse or a hifa verse right in with the current events that was going to be 4 000 years down the road and the devil Read it just like a newspaper went right over the top of it like a bunch of theologians did and this is one of them settings now remember this is in the days when they are rebuilding the temple this is one of the days whenever they're out there the temple so they're going to say well the man whose name is a branch of and who in the world was that who's he talking about Joshua who's he talking about and God slid another Messianic prophecy right in the middle of it that's the way he likes to do you sometimes he likes to set you right down in the middle of NAPA Auto Parts and give you a job right there in the middle of it and you turn that whole part store upside down God likes to put you in the or God likes to put you in an office somewhere and every time you come in and sit down on that long skirt and that long hair and then Bob heard painted face Jezebel sitting around they can't stand it they don't realize there's a walk and a pistol walk right in among them and you're sitting there just as happy as of being a bunch of honey and you're typing away glory to God he set me free yes he set me free you know they kind of Snicker at you when you get up and walk out but you know you're bearing the reproach for the word and you know Lord Jesus is on your side Why Should I Worry why should I fear the lord Jesus as God is out on you children you are the apple of his eye and God just slides it right in there so your Zechariah says the man whose name is the branch the people probably thought oh boy who ever heard of calling a man after a true branch these prophets are so weird they are so strange we are so blessed to be able to understand such strange things which must mean that we are strange also but the way we look at it we're looking back out from where we are and we're looking at others and saying what in the world is wrong with everybody else they're out of their mind and they're looking at us and say them people are crazy they are totally Looney Tunes they don't have a clue what in the world is going on you might be surprised we not only know what's going on we know what's going on before the foundation of the world we actually know a lot of things that's went on down through time and now further more than that we know what's fixing to take place and it might be right here tonight it might be in the morning but one of these days we may be sitting together on the house of God and it hits us and all of a sudden a 66 year old Pastor standing here and about like a boat to lightning strikes out of heaven and I turn to be an 18 year old man right in front of your eyes and you turn to be 18 years old right in front of my eyes and we know it ain't gonna be long we're fixing to be called up by the power of God why let them say what they want call us what they want to but one day call us gone come all is gone because you're going to be leaving this place so the man whose name is the branch so I guess it shouldn't seem unusual to us that when the man whose name was the branch come on the earth and he started saying I am the Vine and ye are the branches you imagine the polished theologians of that every other thing the poor guy I mean you can tell he's from Happy Valley you can tell the poor guys a Kentuckian I mean you know they're just kind of backwashed and ignorant and stuff like that he's from down in Nazareth and I mean who would call himself a Vine and and call his followers branches the Branchwood we consider the great honor to be called branches don't we I mean because after all the man whose name is the branch is calling me an offshoot of him oh maybe you don't want to be called that I couldn't be calling nothing better I'll tell you one thing my name will not be in lights well I guess this is about as bright as I'll ever get right here my name won't be on the Hollywood's Walk of Fame my name may not be here and there and I really don't care and I really don't want it to be but the man whose name is the branch calls me a branch so that means I'm an offshoot of the man himself I am the vine and ye are the branches and now he said I don't no longer bring forth the fruit but you all will so you'll go in my name and you'll cast out devils and you'll heal the sick and you'll lay your hands on them and demons will come out of them because it'll be me in you continuing my same work foreign notice this title of condescension the man whose name is the branch he shall grow wow as I said I keep repeating it but you can say by God has such a hard time dealing with human beings because they feel like they can't go no farther they've reached the Utopia they're the ultimate if they're Society creatures I mean they are the society Elite you know if they're this oh I can go no farther I can but even he himself grew Luke 2 52 Jesus grew in wisdom and understanding before God Amen how many wants to be like Jesus now notice the attribute that Zechariah attributes to it now remember the parallel of the time what's going on here temple building time Temple dedication time and your Zechariah just speaks the word of the Lord and said now there's come in a man whose name is going to be the branch and he shall build the temple of the Lord so the thing was that Joshua and remember there was a Joshua doing this time for him not to Joshua and the days of Moses but this Joshua and that was also the high priest he was the one that had on the dirty garments and the angel of the Lord come and told him to to make him claim so God slid this prophecy right inside of there you can see why this sometimes people try to study the message of them and they totally Miss prophetic words and they say oh he left out a man here and he said this over there they don't even understand fall now you ever read the prophecy there in Isaiah whenever he talks about the mountain of the Lord and then you turn over to Micah chapter 4 verse 1 and read verses one two and three a lot of these people in the day we're living it would have considered them to be pleasuring one another's words because they were almost identical except when you come down to verse three so I guess they'd say that either Micah plagiarize Isaiah or Isaiah plagiarize Micah because they said the same thing that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost you see cerebral is now the builder of the temple and the temple building is going on and God just slides this prophetic word right in the middle of and they said the man's name he said branch is that zeruble is he the one he's talking about he's not going to build a house Made of Stone sheetrock but he's going to build a body he will build a temple of the Lord praise God aren't you glad we're part of it as we started building this structure several years ago two years ago I guess it was planned on it for two years before that and especially when we got into the sanctuary part and we needed people that could do this and do that and lay carpet and stain and build and you know build this beautiful piece of furniture brother John did that and brother Dave laid Stone you know and my brother Scotty and brother Dave Hunt run miles hundreds and hundreds of feet of wire all above your heads and everywhere seemed like every person every job you needed there was somebody there to be able to do it and that's the way it is in the body of God when we find our place and we'll all be synchronized together now cervable could not build a temple like this Solomon could not build a temple like this hold tight brother Branham could not build a temple like this Paul could not build it only the man whose name was the branch could build this house of God oh don't you love him you see the Divine architect who made such a beautiful world also had in his mind another Temple which would be the house of God and he planned this Divine structure himself so everything is specified and pre-ordained and remember as it was in the days of Solomon that they took and they used The Cedars of Lebanon and they would get Craftsman from Tyree and they would get Craftsmen from different parts of the world and they hewed these stones out of the queries they're in different parts of the world and they brought them there to the Mount Moriah where Abraham was going to offer his son and there wasn't even the sound of a hammer in that building some of you come over here whenever this place was in the construction stage some days we couldn't even talk to one another yeah I want to use I would have to holler so much noise going on nail guns you know the Hammers I'm air compressors this going on that going on but can you imagine the house that Solomon built every stone was pre-cut some of this trim and some of this stuff here these brothers would go to the saw and cut it cut it long of course a good Trend man does and then he'd come back take a sixteenth off take another 16th off take an eight thought why because you want it too short you got a big long piece you'll ruin that thing if you take too much off at one time don't you know that's what God's doing to us we're saying well why don't he get that great big Sledgehammer just knock everything off if he did that to us it'd scare us to death some of us spiritually is about the size of that piano and when God gets done whether it's going to be about like this right here you can imagine if God took a sledgehammer and knocked you down that big of the Lord have mercy oh God don't don't fill all that of me away you're showing away my best Forest he said that ain't nothing but junk son That Ain't Nothing But Trash ain't never gonna weigh you down I'm Gonna Get You Down Under the right side you say you mean mother don't need the Lord may make me that small that's a great blessing if if you're made that small that means you're the only one that can fit that certain pot nobody else can take your place I I don't want to be jealous of preachers I've never been gentle so preacher I'm not a great preacher I know that I'll never will be too old for that but now but you know what there ain't a man in this message that can take my place they're in a singer in this message that can take your place and don't you come here and say well nobody knows me I'm not media if God placed you in our assembly you are needed and nobody can take your place you need to assume that responsibility say Lord I'm gonna be there every time I can [Applause] oh you see what he does he collects the material he'll take a Rahab or tomorrow he'll take a Bathsheba he'll take a ruse he'll take an eve a Mary a Sarah a Rebecca Hallelujah he'll put him together you make one an evangelist fiery evangelist not brother Daryl he'll make another evangelist like brother John and brother Johnson coming up here and brother Joel Brown different ministers around the world that he's made called them in different ways give them diversities of give set them inside the body they just find that spot and be what God wants them to be don't be jealous of one another well I don't get to appreciable once every now and then well maybe he'll once every now and then pressure that ain't everybody in our brother that can preach three times a week let me tell you that right now and then everybody just called to be a convention speaker and some that Don't Preach convincing so jealous of those who are you ought to walk in that man's shoes and feel the burden that he feels and not change your desire to want to preach a convention but we can only be what God has made us [Music] you see these Stones right here these Stones right here a great Craftsman laid to him a man right there every Mason has his own style I started laying this one over here I said well Dave I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to finish it he said brother it'll be right there waiting on you I ain't finishing it you know why every Craftsman ever Mason has his own style and if you had an eye for masonry you would see where brother Dave stopped and where I started unless he mimics my style or I mimic his so brother Dave started this he finished it brother Dave started that he finished it I started that I finished it the Lord Jesus started you he's going to finish him the Lord Jesus started his church he's going to finish it it ain't going to him started me finishing this man no sir and the devil is not going to destroy it my machine set right there for days on end full of stone full of maul of my two but I couldn't come back because I had to do pastoral Duty really I am passed on because I'm laying Stones too and that they would not touch I said Cornell no I ain't doing that that's yours well that's the way it is with our working god brother Daryl can't take my place I can't take his you can't take somebody else's and nobody else can take yours that there's people better than me oh yeah I understand I'll say the same thing even if they are better the Lord God ordained me to fit that certain spot there ain't another Stone out there in the world that can take my place or yours foreign so the Lord God collects his material he won't buy some Honky Tonks you walk by some cold denominational churches you walk by some pig pens he won't buy all kinds of things collecting material praise God what by one damn found a little boy packing water to a moonshine still and the Lord said it's time to wake him up of a deposit I've got to work for him so he appears on the top of that tree and that little boy drops that bucket of water and heads out they're scared to death what's God doing getting ready to collect the material you see God may take a Mighty Man a great prophet of God and use him to reach the entire world and him influence millions of people's lives and God may take one of you and you'll lead one to the Lord it may be your son or your daughter and you think I've never done anything for God what that one's soul is worth millions of Worlds don't you never say you've never done nothing for God you household saying well I ain't no preacher I ain't never prophesied I ain't never done nothing like that but you've been a good wife haven't you you've been a good mother you've well brother Donnie I made mistakes sure like all the rest of us half that you serve God with all of your heart you'd be a good housewife you'll be a good mother you'll be a good preacher's wife whatever it is and I'll tell you one thing when that preacher stands before the Lord God that day you'll stand right there with him and all the world the saints of God will bear witness that you've stood with that servant of God oh oh children notice this and God's provided place of worship for prophet speaking about this living stones a new creation not to a denomination but to the word your creation of the word because the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God and upon this comes Stone upon Stone any change I've stood there at the Pyramids of Giza I've stood at the step pyramid I've stood at those pyramids of Egypt and they stand there and you look at those massive stones and think how did they do it how did they do it and of course what we see now is a far cry from what it was because they said it was actually covered in a white limestone so the whole outside was slick and Polished white limestone and that that sun shining down on that it must have been absolutely incredible it still is to this day when you walk up and see such a thing but I'll tell you one thing I'm looking tonight it's something that's even more incredible oh it's amazing to stand there as I told you a few years ago whenever Carol and I stood there in Jerusalem and see some of those stones and I just saw a video the other day of another one where they'd found and that dug that thing down one stone 40 feet long brother Jerry one stone hewn out around Jerusalem there somewhere and they took some type of chisels or something and cut like a Roman OG sign in that stone all the way around four inch perimeter on the top and the sides and the bottom and you've got that thing about seven feet tall and about seven feet wide and 40 feet long one stone not poured concrete one stone then you've got others it's about like this then you've got people like me that's Splinter Stone I guess but as long as I'm a stone I'm going to come out punching look out devil here I come I ain't worried about my size I just want to make sure I come from the man whose name is the branch I'm one part of the rock Kingdom so guess what I'm going to do I'm on a beat I'm on a thrash I'm gonna whip up on the devil as long as I've got a chance and an opportunity anybody with me tonight I don't have to be as big as brother Ron Spencer I don't have to do what brother Tim does that's not who I am my name is Donnie in case you all forgot it my last name is Reagan in case you forgot it and I'm going to chew on that devil I'm going to kick him I'm going to stomp him I'm going to do whatever I can do to make hell pay well praise the Lord you young people quit comparing yourself to this man or that man or that young man he's my idol don't make any person your idol make the Lord Jesus the one you look to understand Hallelujah Hallelujah oh don't you love him tonight thank God for his grace to us praise the Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus we worship you tonight mighty God hallelujah hallelujah you understand friends we're in that transition between the coming of the son of man and that advent when he will take away his bride what's been going on now for two thousand years it was under the dispensation of the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost why Son of God God is a spirit what does son of man mean son or been of a man what is holy ghost son of God God himself condescending in a form of sonship for two thousand years seven Church ages under that reign of Son of God building an invisible Kingdom in the hearts of his people and then right down on the end time before the opening of the seals he slips down as a revealing of the son of man praise God now remember that prophetic Ministry ended the man but the son of man Christ Jesus is still here I hope you don't get mad at me if you do I don't really care because it's the truth anyhow that Pillar of Fire is still here that Lord Jesus is still here he's out here with us tonight he's with his people all over the whole world he is here when he leaves we leave with him praise God so what's he doing polishing the stones getting everything ready for this great body you see John saw it coming down but he's looking at the end of the of the Feast of Tabernacles the Millennium and odd John saw the holy city in the New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband but Paul says this one is going up what is it it's the Pyramid of God faith virtue knowledge Temperance all that down through the church ages God building a building and what's he going to do in the resurrection he's going to resurrect this entire pyramid and take it up in the first resurrection and then whenever he comes back and we set upon the Earth in the Millennium Reign and the temple will be rebuilt in Jerusalem and the law will go forth the Torah will go forth from Jerusalem Micah 4 1-3 and War will it set upon the Mount of God Mount Zion oh praise the Lord then the spiritual pyramid of the body the bride will come right back down and set down where on Jerusalem thank you Lord Jesus don't you understand there's no way for you to lose your winners praise be to God that's about our head shall we anyone not to be remembered tonight as we pray anything that just hindering in your life you walk you just don't have the victory that you want to have or something besetting you or something bothering you maybe a sickness in your body or whatever it is you just need strength you just think brother Donnie that rung true to me tonight that's scripture about the devil wearing out the Saints I got to be honest friends I feel wore out sometimes just dealing with life you just feel so worn out what's that mean you're going to quit goodness no you ever work real hard in the day especially when it's hot and the heat just takes it out of him you've sweated and you've sweated and you've drank and tried to intake your fluid level and all of that and you just feel so worn out at the end of the day and what are you looking for you're looking to go home that don't mean you ain't never coming back again you're just longing for the end of the day this is what we feel is the bride it ain't that we're quitting that ain't we're going back to the world my goodness why in the world but I want to go back to that hog slop that old mess of the world I'm just getting tired at the end of the day I'm weary I'm hot I'm sweaty as it was Brother Louie just tiring your hands are feeble as the Bible says lift up the hands that are feeble that hang down your spirit gets Weir your mind gets weary sometimes you can develop a weary attitude but that don't mean we're ready to quit just means we're ready to go home but maybe we might need a little bit of recharge it tonight home might be tomorrow for some of you it might be tomorrow for me but if it ain't till next week or next month I don't know when it'll be but I want to be ready and I want to stay energized you think that little Energizer battery is something my goodness you and I ought to be way more in that little energized bunny you've seen it you know what I'm talking about they put them little batteries in that little guy and he goes down there beating that drum we ought to be even way more than that is because we've got the original Energizer the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's just pray can we not only those in the visible audience but those that are streaming Wherever You Are Tonight Heavenly Father we're just praying tonight for your strength and your grace Lord is Zechariah prophesied in those days and we know from the story of Ezra and the stories thereof during that time frame that they were dealing with such opposition and such difficulty to build the wall and to build the foundations of the house and and to bring it all up it was one battle after another after another and Lord we should not be confounded when we look around and say why is it such a struggle why is there such a battle Satan is always hated the construction of the house of God we know what a time we've had just building this natural building trying to meet this requirement and that requirement and this stipulation and that stipulation just to be able to get in here just the natural side how much more that spiritual dwelling of the house of God then Satan will try to discourage he'll try to wear us out as it were oh but Jesus we pray tonight you'd come this way Lord visit us in a special way with your presence father may you bring encouragement tonight Lord maybe to every preacher Lord every deacon Lord some of these brothers and sisters have contributed so much of their strength and their time father many of these brothers have come and worked in the Midnight Hour donated their time took time away from their wives and their children themselves to be able to make this all work together some come early but the crack of dawn oh I pray you'd bless every one of them Father bless every one of them some Lord maybe they don't have any ability like that but they've donated and donated Lord people that streamed the services even though many of them know they'll never be able to set a foot in this service but they have sent thousands and thousands of dollars because they believe this is the work of God and they want to be identified and supporting where they get their food I pray you bless every one of them Lord God oh Jesus would you come father and just strengthen your people I don't devil would like to wear us out he'd like to wear me out Lord he'd like to wear brother Daryl out he'd like to wear out Brother Louie he'd like to wear us out as far as it's getting weary no wonder the Bible tells us be not weary and will do it father I don't care what you want me to be I don't want to be big I don't want to be important I'm not gifted like a lot of men are but whatever you can use me for Jesus maybe I've got a tiny little spot in the Kingdom some of them Stones I put in that column over there I can still remember the size of them an inch and a quarter by two and a half and some of the brothers cutting them for me so I wouldn't have to get down and they would cut them and throw them up to me and I'd stick them in and I'd call out the measurement make me a three and a half by an eight and a half or make me this and that brother Dave did the same thing because we had something in her mind and them little stones are important they fill a spot Lord God May ever Stone in this building tonight realize we don't need to compare ourselves to somebody else what we need to do is compare ourselves to your vision of our life if you want me to be a little stoned I'm perfectly fine with that but Lord God help my life to match your vision of me I don't want to be one inch bigger or one inch smaller I want to be exacted to declared Dimensions that you thought of me before the foundation of the world because there's one thing I want to hear when Carol and I walk before you that day and I grab her by the arm and we walk down and we stand before you Lord Jesus we're not going to stand there at the white Throne judgment but rather we will stand there at the rewards when we stand there that day arm and arm Lord God I want to hear these words well done my good and faithful servant I'm not looking for accolades of Praise I'm not looking for greatness and that and the other just let me hear those words then father it will be worse at all everything we've ever won went through to hear those great precious words anyone else feel that way tonight would you just raise your hand Lord God say that about me Hallelujah oh Jesus don't let us miss it Lord let us be faithful to the very end whatever you've contributed to us we might be the little boy that has the lunch with a few Fish and Loaves in his hands it was good for a lunch a little boy that skipped school but in the hands of Jesus it could feed five thousand maybe my little ambition my little gift my this set the other if I keep it and do what I want to with it not never amount to Nothing in life but if I can surrender to you Lord God it can affect people around the world brother Daryl that people probably thought raised up with him while he'll never amount to nothing oh Ward boy you know them Awards come from over North Carolina and probably just you know hang around and become this and that and the other and yet Lord God you've given him a Ministry that has touched people around the world Lord God there's people alive tonight that's been healed from cancer people alive that growths have fell off their body that he's prayed for people alive heavenly father of great things that you've given to him Lord we thank you tonight that we have been blessed to be associated with such a man oh Lord I pray you'd help each of us to be able to do what you've called us to do Lord God granted I pray father in the name of Jesus oh we worship you tonight father Hallelujah how many wants to do something for Jesus Jesus used me oh Lord don't refuse me
