[52:01] before we get into the word I just
[52:04] want to bring greetings from from my
[52:06] home Church even like Tabernacle there
[52:08] in Minden Louisiana and from my pastor
[52:11] brother Tim Pruitt and
[52:13] just so thankful to have this
[52:14] opportunity you know I was telling some
[52:16] of my friends this weekend I've been
[52:18] visiting up here and
[52:20] well I was visiting Happy Valley
[52:22] every year since about 1999 just every
[52:26] summer coming I have so many friends
[52:28] here and it's just it's a incredible
[52:31] experience to stand here before you and
[52:33] here at Word of Life
[52:35] church today and um
[52:37] I'm thankful to have my wife with me
[52:39] sister Lydia and my two oldest children
[52:41] Aaliyah and Jude I'm just thankful for
[52:43] this opportunity it's such a wonderful
[52:46] thing I've always had such incredible
[52:48] respect for brother Donnie and and for
[52:50] for the ministry that has stood the test
[52:52] of time here and has always stood for
[52:54] truth and you ought to thank God every
[52:56] day for a pastor that stands and
[52:58] proclaims the truth in this day
[53:04] it's wonderful to have that and not only
[53:07] do I respect him and his ministry but
[53:09] there's so many men and women in this
[53:11] congregation who I've known to come to
[53:13] love and respect and
[53:16] you know there's no situation that's
[53:18] hopeless
[53:21] there's no situation that's hopeless I
[53:23] know
[53:24] many of you have probably heard that on
[53:29] Friday morning I got the phone call that
[53:31] my dad had passed away and
[53:33] and I was already here but the last time
[53:36] I spoke with my dad was Monday morning
[53:37] and
[53:39] and I sat there and he looked at me you
[53:40] know and his eyes had already turned
[53:42] towards Eternal things and he said Son
[53:43] no matter what happens he said if this
[53:45] turns south from me you do not cancel
[53:47] that trip
[53:49] he said you go do your job
[53:52] so I went and told him my goodbyes
[53:54] Wednesday morning knowing it'd be the
[53:57] last time I'd see him he told me I loved
[53:59] you and I told him I loved him and
[54:02] but talking about hopeless situations
[54:06] in the last few months of his life
[54:08] the Lord restored and did so many
[54:10] miraculous things in his life that so
[54:12] far exceeded physical healing that I can
[54:14] stand here today in peace knowing that
[54:17] he knows where he was going and I know
[54:19] where he was going
[54:21] you know my dad set in church with me
[54:23] for many many years but that didn't mean
[54:25] I could look you in the eye and tell you
[54:26] I knew exactly where he was going
[54:30] come on now he said on the pew
[54:33] let me tell you about a restoration
[54:37] I'm sorry just let me testify for a
[54:39] minute but Donnie in the year 2000 my
[54:41] parents divorced my my dad divorced my
[54:43] mom
[54:45] and I sat in the same church with my
[54:47] parents for 20 something years with one
[54:49] sitting over here and one sitting over
[54:50] there
[54:52] but two months ago God restored that
[54:54] marriage
[54:56] as they renewed their vows and she was
[54:58] by his side every step of the way all
[55:00] the way up to the crossing over don't
[55:02] you give up on your situation
[55:05] don't you give up on your loved ones
[55:07] don't you give up on that marriage don't
[55:09] give up on that lost son or daughter
[55:10] it's never too late it's never too late
[55:14] there's somebody out there this morning
[55:16] and he's working on your behalf
[55:19] don't ever give up on your situation
[55:23] God bless you this morning church
[55:28] returning to receive
[55:32] that's what we're going to speak on this
[55:33] morning returning
[55:35] to receive if you have your Bibles and
[55:37] you'd like to turn with us to the book
[55:38] of Isaiah
[55:40] chapter 44
[55:44] pray you'll bear with me today is I I do
[55:46] have a a lot of scriptures to read
[55:50] uh not not at the beginning but as we go
[55:52] through there'll be a lot of scripture
[55:53] reading thank you brother
[55:59] Isaiah 44 we're going to read verse 28
[56:02] and then we're going to move down to
[56:03] Isaiah 45 and 1.
[56:07] it says that saith of Cyrus
[56:11] he is my shepherd and shall perform all
[56:15] my pleasure
[56:16] even saying to Jerusalem Thou shalt be
[56:20] built and to the temple thy Foundation
[56:24] shall be laid Isaiah 45 and 1.
[56:29] thus saith the Lord to his anointed
[56:32] to Cyrus
[56:34] whose right hand I have Holden to subdue
[56:37] Nations before him and I will loose the
[56:40] loins of Kings to open before him the
[56:42] two live gates the gates shall not be
[56:46] shut skipping down to verse 13. I have
[56:49] raised him up in righteousness and I
[56:52] will direct all his ways he shall build
[56:55] my city and he shall let go my captives
[56:58] not for Price nor reward saith the Lord
[57:03] of hosts can we pray together this
[57:06] morning
[57:09] our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Lord
[57:12] as we stand here before these people
[57:13] Lord it is very evident to us
[57:16] Lord our insufficiencies and our
[57:18] inadequacies adequacies and we recognize
[57:20] Lord that we need you right now
[57:22] Lord we ask that you would just come and
[57:24] shut my mouth
[57:25] Lord where you'd have me to shut it and
[57:27] speak through me Lord and where you'd
[57:28] have me to speak
[57:30] Lord only you can come and take a sermon
[57:32] and break it apart in a way that it can
[57:34] meet the needs of this many people but
[57:36] Lord we've seen you do it time and time
[57:37] again and we're asking you to do it
[57:39] again this morning
[57:40] Lord speak to your people feed on my
[57:43] pray father take complete control of
[57:45] this service
[57:46] Lord we recognize the evil all around us
[57:48] and we see Lord that we're at the
[57:50] blending of Time and Eternity
[57:52] and Lord we just want to be ready and we
[57:53] want to be in our position ready to
[57:55] receive that which we're called to
[57:57] receive father
[57:58] granted now I pray in Jesus name amen
[58:01] amen you may have your seats
[58:04] it's good to be in the house of God this
[58:06] morning
[58:09] I want to look for a little bit at
[58:10] Israel and and their captivity
[58:14] in Babylon and the return back to the
[58:16] Homeland and as it relates to the church
[58:19] down Through the Ages and her captivity
[58:22] and mystery Babylon
[58:24] because we know that Israel being at
[58:25] being a type of the church and we know
[58:28] that Israel had strayed away from God
[58:30] and because of this they were exiled
[58:33] and they were taken down to Babylon and
[58:34] they would spend 70 years of Exile here
[58:37] just as Jeremiah had foretold that they
[58:39] would
[58:42] this Exile out of the Homeland would
[58:44] have great effects on them as a nation
[58:46] it would have great effects on their
[58:48] culture
[58:49] and it greatly would affect their
[58:51] worship
[58:53] they made attempts to continue to
[58:55] worship how they had done in the
[58:57] Homeland that Scholars actually believed
[58:59] that it was during this time of Exile
[59:01] there in Babylon that synagogues were
[59:04] established and they did this so that
[59:06] they could hold services in an attempt
[59:08] to worship the way they had done in the
[59:10] original the way they had worshiped at
[59:12] the beginning Services were held and
[59:15] holidays were observed there in the
[59:17] synagogues and they prayed here and and
[59:19] they practiced circumcision here and and
[59:21] the traditions of their religion was
[59:24] carried on in these synagogues there in
[59:26] Babylon
[59:27] Now understand as we say these things
[59:29] the problem wasn't with their worship
[59:32] they were doing the best they could
[59:34] where they were at with the truth that
[59:37] they had while in captivity even though
[59:39] they couldn't fully worship Him in
[59:41] spirit and in truth and and even though
[59:43] they couldn't sacrifice in the temple
[59:45] they were worshiping as best they could
[59:48] with what they had
[59:50] but the issue came when it was time to
[59:53] go back
[59:54] the issue came when there was an
[59:56] opportunity to be restored back to the
[59:59] original
[1:00:00] the issue came because they no longer
[1:00:03] saw the need to be restored back
[1:00:07] second chronicles 36 23 it says thus say
[1:00:11] Osiris King of Persia all the kingdoms
[1:00:14] of the earth half the Lord God Of Heaven
[1:00:16] given me and he had charged me to build
[1:00:18] him a house in Jerusalem which is in
[1:00:20] Judah who is there among you all his
[1:00:24] people
[1:00:25] listen to The Challenge now who is there
[1:00:27] among you all his people the Lord his
[1:00:31] God be with him and let him
[1:00:34] go up
[1:00:35] historians say that if they were to
[1:00:37] attach a percentage to it perhaps those
[1:00:40] who actually left Babylon which is now
[1:00:42] Persia
[1:00:44] left Babylon and when go back would be
[1:00:46] no more than 10 percent of the Jews that
[1:00:49] were in captivity many believe that it
[1:00:51] was possibly as few as five percent
[1:00:54] so at least 90 percent of the Jews who
[1:00:57] had been living in the Babylonian Empire
[1:00:59] against their Wills
[1:01:01] now choose
[1:01:04] by their own choosing elect not to
[1:01:07] return to the original Homeland
[1:01:10] think about it now they have been given
[1:01:13] now look they're there and they had been
[1:01:15] given instructions while they were there
[1:01:17] to tarry they had been given
[1:01:19] instructions to do the best you can
[1:01:20] while you're here Jeremiah 29 5 said
[1:01:24] build your houses dwell in them plant
[1:01:27] Gardens eat the fruit of them
[1:01:29] take your wives and beget sons and
[1:01:31] daughters and take wives for your sons
[1:01:33] and give your daughters to husbands that
[1:01:35] they may bear sons and daughters that ye
[1:01:38] may be increased there and not
[1:01:39] diminished and seek the peace of the
[1:01:42] city whether I have caused you to be
[1:01:44] carried away captives and pray unto the
[1:01:46] Lord for it for in peace thereof ye
[1:01:49] shall have peace in other words they had
[1:01:52] a prophet tell them that if you're
[1:01:53] planning your wheat go ahead and plant
[1:01:55] your wheat go ahead and hold your
[1:01:57] potatoes you've heard it said go ahead
[1:01:59] and plant your potatoes but in the
[1:02:01] tarrying they began to lose focus on the
[1:02:05] most important thing that we're not
[1:02:07] supposed to stay here forever in the
[1:02:09] tearing they lose focus that they're
[1:02:11] supposed to return to the place that
[1:02:14] they came from when they were taken
[1:02:15] captive
[1:02:16] they lose focus because in verse 10 it
[1:02:19] says for thus saith the Lord that after
[1:02:21] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I
[1:02:24] will visit you and perform my good word
[1:02:27] towards you and causing you to return to
[1:02:30] this place now what place is he talking
[1:02:32] about he's talking about the original
[1:02:34] Homeland the place that they were taken
[1:02:36] captive from they're supposed to return
[1:02:39] to this place
[1:02:42] but they've been caught up now in the
[1:02:44] tearing and now they're too busy to
[1:02:46] think about leaving
[1:02:47] they're too busy to think about
[1:02:49] Wednesday night service because jobs got
[1:02:52] them tied down they're too busy going to
[1:02:54] this ball game and that ball game in
[1:02:56] this practice and that practice and this
[1:02:58] school thing and that school thing
[1:03:00] they're not doing sinful things but
[1:03:02] they're too busy in the tearing and they
[1:03:05] forgot that they're not supposed to stay
[1:03:07] here
[1:03:08] they've lost focus on what their goal is
[1:03:11] the goal is to go back the goal is to
[1:03:13] leave the goal is to return but they got
[1:03:16] too busy
[1:03:18] they're too busy in the tearing
[1:03:21] too comfortable in Babylon oh Lord help
[1:03:24] us
[1:03:26] too comfortable in laodicea
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:30] they had grown accustomed to a little
[1:03:32] bit of Babylon mixed into their beliefs
[1:03:36] a little bit of denominational thinking
[1:03:38] sprinkled in
[1:03:40] they got too accustomed and they didn't
[1:03:42] see the need for an Acts 2 38 experience
[1:03:45] anymore they didn't see the need for an
[1:03:47] acts 4 experience anymore they said you
[1:03:49] know I can just accept God sent a
[1:03:51] prophet and stay right where I'm at
[1:03:55] they became comfortable in the tearing
[1:03:58] just believe on the Lord just accept God
[1:04:01] sent a prophet but God had come and
[1:04:04] provided an opportunity for them to go
[1:04:06] back an opportunity to move and I'm
[1:04:09] telling you when God says move you
[1:04:11] better move When God says go back and he
[1:04:13] opens the Red Sea you better go through
[1:04:15] it he says go back and when that comes
[1:04:18] you got to go all the way back you can't
[1:04:21] be like Reuben and God that got so
[1:04:23] caught up in the herds that they
[1:04:25] accumulated on the journey that they
[1:04:27] settled on this side of the Jordan they
[1:04:30] got so many herds that these grasses
[1:04:32] look good and they stopped they said
[1:04:34] we'll settle right here but there's got
[1:04:36] to be somebody says no I will not stop
[1:04:38] short I won't settle for anything less
[1:04:40] than the promised land I'm crossing over
[1:04:43] I'm going all the way all the way back
[1:04:45] all the way back all the way to my
[1:04:48] promises
[1:04:50] Hallelujah
[1:04:53] we can't stay here
[1:04:57] you can't get comfortable here
[1:05:03] Isaiah is writing this
[1:05:05] more than a hundred years prior to Cyrus
[1:05:09] taking control of Babylon and
[1:05:11] he calls Cyrus the anointed of the Lord
[1:05:15] he says I will direct all his ways he
[1:05:18] shall build my city and he shall free my
[1:05:20] people
[1:05:21] I think it's important that we come to
[1:05:23] the recognition people that God does
[1:05:25] things the way he wants to do things
[1:05:27] he doesn't ask our opinion and what we
[1:05:30] think ought to be done and how things
[1:05:31] ought to be run
[1:05:34] come on now
[1:05:36] we've got two used to a Burger King
[1:05:37] Society
[1:05:39] have it your way right away this ain't
[1:05:41] about your way he is the way he is the
[1:05:43] truth he is the life and when he lays it
[1:05:46] out in front of you like I told the
[1:05:47] young people the other night all you got
[1:05:49] to do is follow instructions
[1:05:51] this is so simple this whole thing is
[1:05:53] simple well I don't understand this and
[1:05:55] I don't understand that he laid out the
[1:05:57] instructions for you I don't know what
[1:05:58] to do just read the instructions just do
[1:06:01] what you're told to do it's his way and
[1:06:04] if you take his way you'll make it out
[1:06:06] of here
[1:06:11] it doesn't matter how you expect things
[1:06:13] to happen
[1:06:14] when you expect things to happen
[1:06:16] God does things the way he wants to do
[1:06:18] it listen God's in control no matter
[1:06:20] what we think I know I'm guilty we all
[1:06:22] gripe about this leader and that leader
[1:06:24] and this President and that President
[1:06:26] and Uncle Joe this and oh come on yeah
[1:06:30] but as hard as it is for except for us
[1:06:32] to accept this fact the ones that are
[1:06:34] supposed to be in control or in control
[1:06:35] doing what they're supposed to be doing
[1:06:40] listen they're bringing about an end
[1:06:42] time condition
[1:06:43] and us as the end time Believers why are
[1:06:45] we so shocked at an end time condition
[1:06:47] I'm saying this ain't this what's been
[1:06:49] foretold ain't this what we've believed
[1:06:51] ain't this what we've looked for all
[1:06:52] along and people are getting scared and
[1:06:54] worried we're not getting scared and
[1:06:56] worried we were told it was coming and
[1:06:58] we were told look up your Redemption
[1:07:01] draw it nah this doesn't worry me this
[1:07:05] confirms everything to me it's going
[1:07:08] Hometown Hallelujah
[1:07:12] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:07:16] God chose Cyrus
[1:07:21] a pagan
[1:07:23] polytheistic King
[1:07:26] to set his people free and tell them go
[1:07:28] back
[1:07:30] you see Cyrus being polytheistic meaning
[1:07:34] he believed in many gods
[1:07:36] he looked at this situation and thought
[1:07:37] the more Gods I can have favoring me the
[1:07:40] better it is
[1:07:41] so he wanted the favor of their God
[1:07:45] will do whatever he has to do he'll move
[1:07:48] the people that he wants to move
[1:07:50] and I'm sure there in that day they were
[1:07:52] like well no no God's going to raise up
[1:07:54] a deliverer like he did with Moses
[1:07:56] he's going to raise up one of our
[1:07:58] Brethren a mighty man nope
[1:08:00] Cyrus
[1:08:03] Cyrus was the anointed of the Lord
[1:08:06] same thing happens in the day of Jesus
[1:08:08] they can't recognize him because they
[1:08:10] can't that he didn't come the way they
[1:08:12] expected it
[1:08:13] oh surely it's going to come from you
[1:08:15] know from this sector that sect and
[1:08:17] caiapha says so oh welcome him in nope
[1:08:20] in a Manger
[1:08:21] in a barn
[1:08:23] God did it the way he wanted to do it
[1:08:25] Hey listen if you got a problem with
[1:08:27] this message let me remind you God did
[1:08:29] it the way he wanted to do it he chose
[1:08:31] the messenger he spoke it the way he
[1:08:33] wanted it smoking it's exactly the way
[1:08:35] God wanted well I don't know about this
[1:08:37] and I don't know about that God didn't
[1:08:39] ask you he said this is my messenger
[1:08:42] this is my message it is Vindicated it
[1:08:45] is the truth it is the way just accept
[1:08:48] it God does it the way God wants to do
[1:08:52] it
[1:08:53] Hallelujah
[1:08:56] oh surely it'll be this one surely it'll
[1:08:59] be that one it'll it'll be this great
[1:09:00] Theologian nope William Branham
[1:09:03] that's the messenger
[1:09:06] and we're not looking for another
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:11] God sent the message and it was
[1:09:13] delivered exactly the way he wanted it
[1:09:15] delivered
[1:09:20] so he foretells in Malachi 4.
[1:09:23] Malachi 4 5 behold I will send you
[1:09:25] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:09:28] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:09:30] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:09:31] fathers to the children in the heart of
[1:09:33] the children to their fathers lest I
[1:09:35] come and smite the Earth with the curse
[1:09:39] is prophesied of an opportunity to go
[1:09:41] back
[1:09:43] to be turned back
[1:09:45] an opportunity given to go back an
[1:09:47] opportunity to to return to the land of
[1:09:50] the word to the original land
[1:09:52] to the faith of the fathers
[1:09:55] the church had need to be turned back
[1:09:56] because it found itself down in Babylon
[1:10:01] it had started free it had started full
[1:10:03] of power there in Jerusalem
[1:10:05] the spirit could move freely
[1:10:07] the spirit could speak they operated
[1:10:09] according to Mark 16. they operated
[1:10:12] according to James 5.
[1:10:15] there was no claims on that church there
[1:10:17] was no false baptisms on that church
[1:10:19] there was no false Trinity doctrines on
[1:10:21] that church
[1:10:23] other false doctrines that down through
[1:10:25] the years that man put in those things
[1:10:27] didn't exist the the doctrines and the
[1:10:29] Deeds of the Nicolaitans had not taken
[1:10:31] hold yet he was a free church it was
[1:10:34] God's church it was how God wanted it
[1:10:38] and let us be reminded they were the
[1:10:40] pattern
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:43] they were the standard they were the
[1:10:46] original
[1:10:48] a few quotes here that you'll recognize
[1:10:49] from the church age book he says
[1:10:51] Pentecost was our pattern no one will
[1:10:54] have to say but what that church was in
[1:10:56] all that the church was inaugurated on
[1:10:58] the day of Pentecost
[1:10:59] that's what the church was at Pentecost
[1:11:01] is the standard
[1:11:04] that is the pattern there is no other
[1:11:07] pattern no matter what the scholars say
[1:11:09] God has not changed that pattern what
[1:11:13] God did at Pentecost he has to keep
[1:11:15] doing until the church age is close
[1:11:19] he says the true church how many hearers
[1:11:21] in the true church you believe that he
[1:11:24] says the true church will always try to
[1:11:26] be like the original at Pentecost the
[1:11:29] true church of today will try to
[1:11:31] approximate that early first one
[1:11:35] I believe brother Brown makes it very
[1:11:36] clear here what the pattern is and what
[1:11:39] we are to attempt to be like
[1:11:42] he even says they will try to
[1:11:44] approximate it
[1:11:46] but what happened to that first church
[1:11:48] because even though they're the pattern
[1:11:50] we don't want to repeat what they did
[1:11:55] sure it's not a return to repeat
[1:11:58] because in repeating what they did you
[1:12:00] go back into the ground
[1:12:02] this church is not called to go into the
[1:12:04] ground
[1:12:05] oh yeah all right so what caused that
[1:12:08] true First Church what happened to him
[1:12:10] the same thing that happened to Israel
[1:12:12] as they began to drift
[1:12:14] they begin to follow after other gods
[1:12:16] after the idea is a man they begin to
[1:12:18] drift and allow the ideas of man to rule
[1:12:21] in the church
[1:12:23] Prophet says it like this the fervent
[1:12:24] desire to please God the passion to know
[1:12:27] his word the cry for reaching out in the
[1:12:30] spirit all began to fade and instead of
[1:12:33] that church being on fire with the fire
[1:12:35] of God it had cooled off and become a
[1:12:38] bit formal
[1:12:40] oh please don't ever let that describe
[1:12:42] you here at word of life no matter what
[1:12:44] they say about you I'd rather them
[1:12:46] sayeth a bunch of Holy Rollers over
[1:12:47] there than to be say they become a bit
[1:12:49] formal don't ever let that be the
[1:12:52] description of this church he said they
[1:12:55] become a bit formal
[1:12:57] then that second generation coming on
[1:12:59] was just like Israel they demanded a
[1:13:02] king to be like other nations when they
[1:13:04] did that they rejected God but they did
[1:13:07] it anyway that's the history of the
[1:13:10] church
[1:13:11] they let down the bars and goats come in
[1:13:13] and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone
[1:13:16] the freedom of the spirit was gone oh
[1:13:19] they kept on with a form
[1:13:22] but the fire had died down and the
[1:13:24] Blackness of Ashes is all about that's
[1:13:26] left
[1:13:28] he says but as usual people don't heed
[1:13:30] God's warning
[1:13:32] the Revival fire built upon the sacred
[1:13:35] word is so
[1:13:40] that a little fear Creeps in and a
[1:13:42] whisper in the heart says how can we
[1:13:45] protect this truth we have
[1:13:48] what can we do to see this revival goes
[1:13:51] on
[1:13:52] that's when the Antichrist Spirit comes
[1:13:55] in and Whispers you have the truth now
[1:13:57] see that it does not get lost
[1:14:01] how slick is he
[1:14:03] that he uses the fear and the love of
[1:14:07] Truth
[1:14:08] to ensnare you
[1:14:12] the fear and the love that I don't want
[1:14:14] to lose this truth this is a wonderful
[1:14:17] truth
[1:14:18] and he comes in and Whispers says you've
[1:14:20] got the truth now make sure you don't
[1:14:22] lose it
[1:14:23] and right here is where the capture
[1:14:25] takes place
[1:14:28] right here is where the church goes down
[1:14:30] into Babylon the very moment they
[1:14:32] organize that first move
[1:14:36] and yet even as the church began its
[1:14:38] Journey back from the Exile down Through
[1:14:40] the Ages as a restoration of Truth
[1:14:42] begins to come forth even as God would
[1:14:45] send Messengers down Through the Ages
[1:14:47] that Spirit kept working in the people
[1:14:49] to keep them from coming all the way
[1:14:52] back
[1:14:55] even though there was a restoration
[1:14:56] taking place even when they came out of
[1:14:59] Rome
[1:15:00] or even when they left Babylon if he
[1:15:03] could keep them with that same
[1:15:04] denominational mindset then he would
[1:15:07] still have a claim on the people
[1:15:09] he would still have a claim on that
[1:15:11] church
[1:15:14] and how would he do it fear of losing
[1:15:17] the truth
[1:15:18] listen the revelation of justification
[1:15:20] was so special brother Donny
[1:15:23] it brought such freedom
[1:15:25] the revelation of justification
[1:15:28] that you can be forgiven of your sins
[1:15:30] and that just shall live by faith it was
[1:15:33] a move of God
[1:15:36] and yet they came in and walled it up so
[1:15:38] tight they couldn't move any further
[1:15:40] they said we must protect this truth and
[1:15:43] they couldn't go on to sanctification
[1:15:47] and then the move of sanctification
[1:15:48] comes in as such an incredible truth
[1:15:51] it's so wonderful to be freed from
[1:15:52] worldly habits to be cleaned out by the
[1:15:55] power of God we must protect this truth
[1:15:58] and they wall it up so much that they
[1:16:00] can't go anywhere else and they're stuck
[1:16:01] right there at sanctification
[1:16:04] other moves of God that the move of
[1:16:06] Azusa Street comes and and the gifts are
[1:16:08] restored power of God pours out through
[1:16:11] a place this is wonderful
[1:16:14] this is the truth and they wall it up so
[1:16:16] tight they can never go beyond tongues
[1:16:18] and accept anything else and they're
[1:16:20] stuck right there
[1:16:21] [Applause]
[1:16:22] oh you ain't gonna like this but then
[1:16:24] God sends a prophet
[1:16:26] and we say this is the truth don't lose
[1:16:29] it and you wall yourself up so tight you
[1:16:31] end up with more Traditions than the
[1:16:33] denominations and you can't go beyond
[1:16:35] God's in a prophet and actually walk in
[1:16:38] the message that he sent you to walk in
[1:16:41] stop right there you gotta move on keep
[1:16:45] going progress to what the message
[1:16:47] called you to be
[1:16:51] Hallelujah
[1:16:54] don't wall yourself up keep going
[1:16:56] you're called to return
[1:16:59] imagine Egypt imagine Israel sitting
[1:17:01] there in Egypt as everybody leaves
[1:17:03] everybody marches out to the promised
[1:17:05] land and you sit there going God sent
[1:17:07] Moses
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:10] where are you bunch of Fanatics going
[1:17:12] I'm staying right here on this truth
[1:17:14] that God sent Moses
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:20] stuck in captivity by a truth
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:26] hey look we got to be willing to move we
[1:17:28] got to be willing to progress you may
[1:17:30] have put blood over the doorpost
[1:17:32] the angel Death Angel passed over in the
[1:17:35] next day if you wouldn't leave you were
[1:17:37] still a prisoner
[1:17:40] many people are stuck at the place of
[1:17:42] their last victory
[1:17:46] listen if you were still dancing on the
[1:17:49] banks of the Red Sea a year later you
[1:17:52] was left behind
[1:17:55] move to the next Victory move to the
[1:17:58] next place keep going keep walking don't
[1:18:01] get stuck where you're at it may be a
[1:18:03] victory it may be wonderful but press on
[1:18:06] Church press on the more keep going
[1:18:10] Hallelujah
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:20] he says the Cry Of Joy was gone
[1:18:25] the freedom of the spirit is gone
[1:18:28] oh they kept on with the form
[1:18:36] I don't want to focus too much on
[1:18:39] those that are still on the banks of the
[1:18:40] Red Sea
[1:18:41] because there's been a people whose
[1:18:43] Hearts have been turned all the way back
[1:18:45] there's a people that ain't stopping on
[1:18:47] this side of Jordan there's a people
[1:18:49] that's going to go all the way in and
[1:18:50] possess the land I believe I'm looking
[1:18:52] at some of those people tonight
[1:18:54] refusing to stop short of all the way
[1:18:57] refusing to stop short of everything
[1:18:59] that's been restored how dare us God
[1:19:02] sends a prophet in this day and restores
[1:19:03] all the truth and we only want to take
[1:19:05] some of it opens up all the word we only
[1:19:07] want to take some of it Lord I want all
[1:19:09] of it I want all you can give pour it
[1:19:12] out Lord I want all of it because I want
[1:19:15] to receive I'm returning to receive what
[1:19:17] you have for me in my life a return to
[1:19:20] the original a return to where our
[1:19:23] fathers worshiped and how our fathers
[1:19:26] worshiped
[1:19:27] yeah
[1:19:29] Hallelujah
[1:19:31] Jeremiah prophesied that they returned
[1:19:34] back to the land of their fathers
[1:19:37] the land of Abraham the land of Isaac
[1:19:39] the land of Jacob
[1:19:41] he says I will visit you and perform my
[1:19:43] good word and causing you to return to
[1:19:45] this place and as we already read there
[1:19:47] in Malachi the same thing
[1:19:49] it's prophesied that one would come and
[1:19:51] turn our hearts back to the land of
[1:19:52] Peter
[1:19:53] land of Paul the land of Stephen
[1:19:57] the land of the fathers
[1:19:59] and an opportunity arises
[1:20:03] by getting away from the first love the
[1:20:05] church had drifted further and further
[1:20:08] and further but God would send prophets
[1:20:10] and different servants down through the
[1:20:12] ages to keep hope alive that one day
[1:20:14] you're going to have the opportunity to
[1:20:15] go back one day there's going to be a
[1:20:18] restoration Malachi prophesied Joel
[1:20:20] prophesied
[1:20:22] just like in captivity and in Babylon
[1:20:24] that there was prophets that came and
[1:20:26] kept hope alive
[1:20:27] but finally the return comes and it's
[1:20:30] more than a hope the opportunity stares
[1:20:32] you in the face
[1:20:34] it's time to return time to go back time
[1:20:37] to rebuild
[1:20:39] and a prophet comes on the scene with a
[1:20:41] message from the King declaring Bible
[1:20:43] truths
[1:20:45] declaring Bible doctrines telling you
[1:20:47] return to the original you must have the
[1:20:50] token spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:20:52] only to find that Christians didn't want
[1:20:54] to go back
[1:20:58] only to find that they had become
[1:20:59] comfortable in Babylon they didn't want
[1:21:02] Bible holiness
[1:21:06] they didn't want real Bible
[1:21:08] sanctification
[1:21:10] they wanted a form of godliness
[1:21:14] they were comfortable with worldly
[1:21:16] comfort
[1:21:17] worldly entertainment most just didn't
[1:21:20] see the need
[1:21:22] they had their religion I've got
[1:21:24] religion we've got our synagogues we're
[1:21:26] do we're worshiping the way people have
[1:21:28] always worshiped and yet I don't have to
[1:21:29] give up this other stuff
[1:21:32] comfortable
[1:21:34] but the king decreed that we could go
[1:21:36] back
[1:21:38] the king puts forth a decree that we can
[1:21:40] rebuild the Temple and have the same
[1:21:41] worship our fathers had that we could
[1:21:43] rebuild the walls and have the same
[1:21:45] protection of the word that our fathers
[1:21:47] had
[1:21:49] we know during this time that around 42
[1:21:52] thousand returned
[1:21:55] around forty two thousand
[1:21:58] they came at different times under
[1:21:59] different administrations but they were
[1:22:01] all under the consent of the current
[1:22:03] reigning King
[1:22:05] why didn't Moore come out
[1:22:09] you ever think about that the message
[1:22:11] makes so much sense
[1:22:13] how can you not see it
[1:22:16] how can you not see it
[1:22:18] it's Vindicated it's obvious it's right
[1:22:20] there why didn't Moore come out
[1:22:23] why don't Moore believe
[1:22:26] how could they see Vindication night
[1:22:28] after night after night and say I'm good
[1:22:31] I'll stay in Babylon
[1:22:33] how could they declare Bible days are
[1:22:36] here again
[1:22:41] how could that could that clear a man
[1:22:43] sent from God
[1:22:46] that wasn't message Believers saying
[1:22:48] that stuff brother died there was no
[1:22:50] message there wasn't churches like this
[1:22:53] that was the denominational world
[1:22:55] and they saw it and they heard it
[1:22:57] returned to the original go back go back
[1:23:00] to the Homeland
[1:23:02] and they said
[1:23:05] we're good right here
[1:23:07] why are you here
[1:23:10] when others stayed
[1:23:13] why are you here when
[1:23:15] others just can't see it
[1:23:18] Ezra one and five then rose up the chief
[1:23:21] of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and
[1:23:24] the priests and the Levites with all of
[1:23:26] them whose Spirit God had raised to go
[1:23:30] up and build the house of the Lord which
[1:23:33] is in Jerusalem it's no accident you're
[1:23:36] here today it's no accident that you're
[1:23:38] returning it's no accident you're going
[1:23:40] back the spirit of the Lord has called
[1:23:43] you it has raised you out it has chosen
[1:23:46] you and something on the inside of you
[1:23:48] responds and says yes Lord that's me I
[1:23:52] don't know why they can't see it and why
[1:23:54] they don't hear it but the spirit of the
[1:23:56] Lord is moving in me it's no accident
[1:24:00] Hallelujah
[1:24:04] you've been called to go home you've
[1:24:07] been called to return there's a work
[1:24:09] that has to be done who's going to do it

[1:24:48] there's something driving you back
[1:24:54] their hearts
[1:24:56] were being turned
[1:24:58] to the faith of their fathers by the
[1:25:00] moving of the spirit

[1:25:06] saith the Lord
[1:25:09] and the King begins to give back oh I

[1:25:28] vessels of the house of the Lord which

[1:25:35] of his gods

[1:25:45] in other words that yelling and
[1:25:46] screaming and shouting that they're
[1:25:47] using out there to worship their false
[1:25:49] gods
[1:25:50] was originally meant to be to worship
[1:25:52] the real true Living God
[1:25:55] yeah they're using it wrong but it's
[1:25:56] okay if we put that back in its place
[1:25:58] today

[1:26:03] Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithra

[1:27:55] the king decrees take these things back
[1:27:58] and put them in the worship in the
[1:28:01] original
[1:28:02] where they belong because in order to
[1:28:04] worship like they did
[1:28:06] at the beginning
[1:28:08] you got to have these things
[1:28:10] these were stolen from the temple
[1:28:14] and as the work begins to progress
[1:28:17] even though they're a small group and
[1:28:19] even though they're a hated group
[1:28:21] and even though there is opposition on
[1:28:23] every hand
[1:28:24] the king provides for them
[1:28:27] every step of the way
[1:28:29] as a 3-7 they gave money also unto the
[1:28:32] Masons and to the Carpenters and meat
[1:28:35] and drink and oil unto them of zydon and
[1:28:38] to them of Tire to bring cedar trees
[1:28:41] from Lebanon to the Sea of Joppa
[1:28:43] according to the grant that they had of
[1:28:46] Cyrus King of Persia
[1:28:49] he didn't send you here send you on this
[1:28:52] journey give you a commission and say
[1:28:54] good luck
[1:28:59] you make it hey this is the same guy
[1:29:02] that opened the Red Sea
[1:29:04] it's the same God that rained Man Out Of
[1:29:06] Heaven it's the same God that said put a
[1:29:08] serpent on the pole look and live your
[1:29:11] sickness he's provided for your finances
[1:29:13] he'll provide for you won't go down you
[1:29:16] won't come up against something that he
[1:29:17] hasn't already thought of he said I'm
[1:29:19] going to take care of you I'm going to
[1:29:21] provide for you every step of the way
[1:29:24] when he sends you on a mission he
[1:29:26] provides what you have need of to finish
[1:29:28] the mission
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:31] oh come on let's quit listening to the
[1:29:34] devil
[1:29:35] hell you're not gonna make it
[1:29:38] you can't do it
[1:29:40] you're not going to overcome
[1:29:42] let me remind him this is the King's
[1:29:43] work
[1:29:44] this is the King's edict he's the one
[1:29:47] that declared go back
[1:29:53] cooperate
[1:29:54] this isn't my idea
[1:29:56] I'm operating under an edict from the
[1:29:59] King
[1:30:01] Hallelujah
[1:30:02] and even though others aren't going back
[1:30:06] even though the majority of folks
[1:30:08] decided to stay in Babylon there there
[1:30:10] is a drive in this small group that says
[1:30:12] we must rebuild
[1:30:14] we must rebuild Jerusalem
[1:30:17] we must rebuild the city we must rebuild
[1:30:19] the Temple we must rebuild the wall
[1:30:22] there must be a restoration
[1:30:25] and with edicts from the King and with
[1:30:26] everything they need provided by the
[1:30:28] king they return and they began to
[1:30:30] rebuild
[1:30:32] and as they return to the original faith
[1:30:34] to the original worship
[1:30:37] it could not be mixed with other worship
[1:30:41] it could not have other people's ideas
[1:30:43] mixed in it couldn't be mixed with the
[1:30:46] Theology of man it couldn't be polluted
[1:30:48] with Babylon it had to be free from
[1:30:49] denomination it had to be pure just as
[1:30:52] it was at the beginning
[1:30:55] Ezra 4 1 says now when the adversaries
[1:30:59] of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
[1:31:01] children of the Captivity builded the
[1:31:03] temple into the Lord God of Israel then
[1:31:05] they came to his Aruba and to the chief
[1:31:07] of the fathers and said unto them let us
[1:31:09] build with you
[1:31:12] we're all working for the same kingdom
[1:31:15] here
[1:31:19] we seek your God
[1:31:22] as you do
[1:31:24] now right here it lets you know they
[1:31:26] ain't on the same side
[1:31:29] because they didn't say your God will be
[1:31:32] our God
[1:31:33] they said we seek your God
[1:31:37] there's no identification with it with
[1:31:39] it being theirs
[1:31:41] as you do and we do sacrifice unto him
[1:31:44] since the days of Essa hardened king of
[1:31:47] Asser which brought us up hither
[1:31:49] you know this seems reasonable
[1:31:53] we need to get this rebuilt man we can
[1:31:55] take all the help we can get
[1:31:58] it seems reasonable
[1:32:00] reasonable got us in this mess to begin
[1:32:02] with in the Garden of Eden
[1:32:05] quit worrying about reasonable what the
[1:32:07] word say quit worrying about reasonable
[1:32:09] what'd God say
[1:32:11] quit worrying about reasonable
[1:32:13] ah here we are
[1:32:16] well brother Donnie don't seem real
[1:32:17] reasonable
[1:32:19] this decision seemed pretty harsh listen
[1:32:22] God chooses his man he puts him in place
[1:32:26] and it ain't about what you think is
[1:32:27] reasonable you're not going to answer
[1:32:30] for the decisions made behind this
[1:32:32] Pulpit you're not going to answer for it
[1:32:34] but he will so let him be let of God
[1:32:45] we're gonna move so quick now
[1:32:48] away from that sorry
[1:32:52] think about it though we'd love to help
[1:32:53] you sure brother Brandon we'll support
[1:32:55] your meeting but lay off the women
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:00] I will help get the tapes around we'll
[1:33:02] help do that we'll support the campaign
[1:33:04] we'll give you all the financial help
[1:33:06] you need but quit preaching that serpent
[1:33:07] Seed doctrine
[1:33:11] couldn't accept that help
[1:33:14] couldn't take that help
[1:33:17] the word adversary here means oppress or
[1:33:20] press
[1:33:21] someone hard
[1:33:24] so prior to the Jews returning to the
[1:33:27] Homeland
[1:33:28] these are the people that had been the
[1:33:30] dominant rulers
[1:33:32] so what they see is as there's a message
[1:33:36] to return they recognize we're about to
[1:33:38] lose some of our people we're about to
[1:33:41] lose control over the people
[1:33:43] their fits in a new wall and a new
[1:33:45] Temple and we're not going to be able to
[1:33:47] control them anymore
[1:33:48] oh come on why you think the devil
[1:33:50] fights so hard against you from getting
[1:33:52] the revelation of who you are and what
[1:33:54] you stand for and what you can do he's
[1:33:56] about to lose control of the people
[1:33:58] there's a people breaking free there's a
[1:34:01] people saying I don't gotta stay here
[1:34:03] that's my God I'm going back I won't
[1:34:06] stay here any longer he's about to lose
[1:34:08] control of the Bride world what as we
[1:34:11] begin gravity's losing its hold we're
[1:34:14] taking our flight Hallelujah he's losing
[1:34:17] control of the people
[1:34:20] Hallelujah
[1:34:25] Glory
[1:34:28] he's losing control of a people
[1:34:35] they don't want to lose their people so
[1:34:37] they offer a hand
[1:34:39] verse 3 but to ruble and Joshua the rest
[1:34:41] of the chief of the fathers of Israel
[1:34:43] said unto them ye have nothing to do
[1:34:45] with us to build a house unto our God
[1:34:51] listen I don't care if you like the way
[1:34:53] we worship I don't care if you like the
[1:34:55] way our services go or what we preach
[1:34:57] we're worshiping Our God you worship
[1:35:00] your God how you walk you have no part
[1:35:03] Worship in our god this is our God we
[1:35:06] worship Him in spirit we worship Him in
[1:35:09] truth he has freed us he has loosed us
[1:35:13] and we will worship him the way we want
[1:35:15] to worship Him
[1:35:24] but we ourselves together will build
[1:35:26] unto the Lord God of Israel has King
[1:35:29] Cyrus
[1:35:30] the King of Persia had commanded us
[1:35:36] this return can't be mixed
[1:35:41] the y'all's clocks broke
[1:35:45] you got some bad batteries he's talking
[1:35:47] about
[1:35:53] it's got to be pure and unadulterated
[1:35:55] word
[1:35:56] because that's how it was at the
[1:35:57] beginning it was pure
[1:35:59] it was an adulterated
[1:36:01] and when they find no compromise here
[1:36:03] amongst the Israelites
[1:36:05] when they find that these are going to
[1:36:07] stay true to the king's edict no matter
[1:36:08] what then they begin to try to hinder
[1:36:10] the work
[1:36:12] well there's a lot of hinderers
[1:36:17] amongst us
[1:36:23] verse 4 then the people of the land
[1:36:25] weakened the hands of the people of
[1:36:28] Judah and troubled them in building
[1:36:32] well what does this mean you know what
[1:36:33] this means did you hear what so-and-so
[1:36:35] said can you believe they're doing this
[1:36:37] at that church can you believe what
[1:36:38] brother died brother Daryl did that can
[1:36:40] you but that
[1:36:43] stuff
[1:36:53] I believe there's a lot of people that
[1:36:56] are mad that God didn't call them to
[1:36:57] preach so they take a Pulpit anywhere
[1:36:59] they can get and spew their gospel
[1:37:01] try to hinder the work
[1:37:03] if God would have wanted you to have a
[1:37:04] Pulpit he'd have gave you one
[1:37:06] you take your Facebook pulpit and your
[1:37:09] Instagram pulpit and whatever Pulpit you
[1:37:11] can find and begin to spew all this
[1:37:12] nonsense and false Doctrine I don't care
[1:37:15] there's a work to be done there's a
[1:37:17] restoration to be done you keep spewing
[1:37:20] I'm Gonna Keep building I'm gonna keep
[1:37:21] working I'm gonna keep doing what the
[1:37:24] king's edict said he said return go back
[1:37:27] build up
[1:37:29] [Applause]
[1:37:35] verse five and they hired counselors
[1:37:37] against them to frustrate their purpose
[1:37:39] all the days Osiris king of Persian
[1:37:42] Persia even until the reign of Darius
[1:37:44] King of Persia and in the reign of a
[1:37:46] hazarus in the beginning of his Reign
[1:37:48] wrote they unto him an accusation
[1:37:50] against the inhabitants of Judah and
[1:37:53] Jerusalem
[1:37:55] church one thing you can be sure of in
[1:37:57] this return is that you're going to face
[1:37:58] opposition
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:01] the enemy doesn't want to see you back
[1:38:03] in the Homeland again
[1:38:05] he doesn't want to deal with the power
[1:38:07] of God back in the church again
[1:38:10] oh come on now you read what happened to
[1:38:12] him in the book of Acts he ain't wanting
[1:38:14] to deal with that no more he liked it a
[1:38:16] lot better in the dark ages
[1:38:18] oh you saw what he had to do with in the
[1:38:20] ministry of William Branham now when you
[1:38:21] see a flesh bride begin to manifest the
[1:38:24] same things he don't want to deal with
[1:38:26] that so he tries to hinder the work I
[1:38:29] can't let him recognize I can't let them
[1:38:31] see what they're capable of I can't let
[1:38:33] them get that true revelation of who
[1:38:36] they are
[1:38:37] and so he's his opposition to the
[1:38:40] restoration
[1:38:42] and he tries to stop the work because
[1:38:44] look I know we call him a dumbo devil
[1:38:46] but he knows how to read
[1:38:50] and he understands that Israel cannot be
[1:38:54] blessed unless they're back in their
[1:38:55] Homeland
[1:38:57] and he recognized that they can't
[1:38:58] receive the Messiah
[1:39:01] until they're in their Homeland
[1:39:04] recognizes there's a bride at his
[1:39:07] longest Bible on has a claim owner then
[1:39:09] the Rapture can't go as long as they're
[1:39:11] stuck in Tradition as long as they're
[1:39:13] stuck in man's ideas then they can't
[1:39:15] receive the Messiah and he tries to keep
[1:39:17] you here but I'm telling you there's a
[1:39:19] people break and lose there's a people
[1:39:21] breaking free this idea don't matter
[1:39:23] that idea don't matter the word matters
[1:39:26] the standard matters I'm returning to
[1:39:29] this I'm going to be found standing in
[1:39:31] my place of restoration
[1:39:38] all right
[1:39:42] you find the same thing all down through
[1:39:43] Nehemiah we don't have time to go into
[1:39:45] it
[1:39:46] how they try to hinder the work
[1:39:48] but even Nehemiah he's not worried about
[1:39:50] the threats he's not worried about the
[1:39:52] accusations because he carries letters
[1:39:54] from the King
[1:39:56] that gives him the authority to do what
[1:39:59] he says he can do
[1:40:01] I'm not making this up church I got
[1:40:03] letters from the King that gives me the
[1:40:05] authority just say what I'm saying to do
[1:40:08] what we're doing to cast out demons to
[1:40:11] lay hands on the sick we got the
[1:40:13] authority to put Satan under our feet
[1:40:15] we've got the authority to worship we
[1:40:17] got the authority to praise prove it
[1:40:19] it's right here I brought my letter from
[1:40:22] the King today Hallelujah
[1:40:26] hallelujah it's your right it's the
[1:40:30] king's eat it
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:38] brother Branham says
[1:40:42] he's quoting a scripture and then he
[1:40:44] adds to it he says I will be found of
[1:40:46] you saith the Lord and I will turn away
[1:40:48] your captivity and I will gather you
[1:40:50] from All Nations and from all the places
[1:40:52] where I've drove you saith the Lord and
[1:40:55] I will bring you again unto the place
[1:40:57] which I cause you to be carried away
[1:40:59] captive back to Pentecost
[1:41:04] he says they were very religious
[1:41:07] and so was those Pharisees but Jesus
[1:41:09] said except the man be born again
[1:41:12] he will in no wise enter into the
[1:41:14] kingdom
[1:41:15] you've got to go back to where we left
[1:41:17] him
[1:41:18] go back and find him for these Creeds
[1:41:20] was not so in the beginning
[1:41:21] the denominational churches was not so
[1:41:23] in the beginning so just drop everything
[1:41:26] and rush back to Pentecost and find the
[1:41:28] true and the Living God who heals the
[1:41:31] sick who cleanses the leopard who cast
[1:41:33] out devils and claims to be in the Bible
[1:41:36] the same yesterday today
[1:41:39] and forever what does this tell you this
[1:41:42] tells me that the King has decreed that
[1:41:44] you can have exactly what they had at
[1:41:46] the beginning
[1:41:48] you can have the same experience with
[1:41:50] the same Authority and the same power
[1:41:52] John 14 12.
[1:41:54] The Works that I do shall you do also an
[1:41:56] even greater
[1:41:58] every time brother Branham
[1:42:01] let me clarify that for nitpickers
[1:42:03] most times brother Branham lists the end
[1:42:05] time scriptures he will include John 14
[1:42:08] 12 in that list
[1:42:10] he'll say Malachi 4 5 6 Luke 17 30.
[1:42:14] Revelation 10 7.
[1:42:16] I'm 14 12. it's an end time scripture
[1:42:20] it's for you to fulfill you've been
[1:42:22] restored back to that it's a part we
[1:42:24] have to play
[1:42:25] we can't just put it off and say
[1:42:27] somebody else is going to do it there
[1:42:28] ain't nobody else coming
[1:42:30] we are the ones that are returning we
[1:42:31] are the ones on the way back it's our
[1:42:33] opportunity It's Our Moment it's our
[1:42:35] time to charge into the eternals
[1:42:40] and Ezra haven't turned down the help
[1:42:42] of the hybridized religion
[1:42:46] now faces their attacks as they try to
[1:42:48] hinder
[1:42:51] and Cyrus is no longer on the throne and
[1:42:53] for a Time the new king is ruling and
[1:42:55] they begin to write him letters and
[1:42:58] here for a little while we're probably
[1:43:00] gonna I'll read a good bit of scriptures
[1:43:02] y'all just bear with me
[1:43:04] Ezra 4 12.
[1:43:06] be it known unto the king that the Jews
[1:43:09] which came up from thee to us are common
[1:43:10] to Jerusalem
[1:43:12] building the rebellious and the bad City
[1:43:16] and have set up the walls thereof and
[1:43:19] joined the foundations Hallelujah
[1:43:23] be it known now unto the king that if
[1:43:25] this city be building and the walls set
[1:43:27] up again they will not pay toll tribute
[1:43:32] and custom and so Thou shalt and damage
[1:43:35] the revenue of the Kings
[1:43:37] now listen
[1:43:40] this is where they get themselves tied
[1:43:41] up
[1:43:43] he goes on to say
[1:43:44] search make a search maybe a search may
[1:43:48] be made in the book of the records of
[1:43:50] thy father so these are the ones trying
[1:43:51] to accuse the Jews they tell the king go
[1:43:54] search the records
[1:43:56] search the records so that thou find in
[1:43:59] the book of the records and know that
[1:44:01] this city is a rebellious City
[1:44:03] and hurtful unto Kings and provinces and
[1:44:07] that they have moved sedition within the
[1:44:09] same of old time for which cause was
[1:44:12] this city destroyed
[1:44:15] he says listen these are the same people
[1:44:18] that rebelled against you time after
[1:44:20] time and if you allow them to rebuild
[1:44:23] they're going to continue to cause
[1:44:24] trouble
[1:44:25] they're going to be rebellious once
[1:44:27] again look in the records and see if
[1:44:30] these people weren't sinners
[1:44:35] go to the records and see if they
[1:44:37] haven't failed you King Time After Time
[1:44:40] After Time
[1:44:43] go back into the records and see if
[1:44:46] these aren't the ones who went down into
[1:44:48] captivity and now they claim to be free
[1:44:51] now they claim to have the baptism of
[1:44:53] the Holy Ghost
[1:44:55] now they claim to have a restored word
[1:44:57] search it out
[1:45:00] search the Records who are they to
[1:45:03] rebuild anything who are they
[1:45:07] this is the same church that fell away
[1:45:13] they fell away once before and you're
[1:45:15] going to let them rebuild it
[1:45:18] and for a time it causes the work to
[1:45:20] cease
[1:45:24] you know all the things they said were
[1:45:25] the truth
[1:45:28] sure everything they wrote in the letter
[1:45:30] was facts
[1:45:31] the facts were stacked up against them
[1:45:33] but none of the facts changed
[1:45:37] the truth
[1:45:39] that the king had made a decree that
[1:45:42] they were the ones that was supposed to
[1:45:44] go back and rebuild the city listen you
[1:45:47] can take all your facts and you can
[1:45:49] stack them up how you want and you still
[1:45:51] don't have the truth this in fact was I
[1:45:54] was a sinner that because I was lost
[1:45:56] fact was I was backslid fact was I was
[1:45:59] going to hell but the truth is he saved
[1:46:02] me he set me free stack your facts up
[1:46:05] I'll stand with the truth the truth said
[1:46:08] go back rebuild this is your city this
[1:46:12] is your Homeland that was the truth
[1:46:18] the fact is I'm sick the truth is he's
[1:46:20] my healer

[1:46:29] it's a fact my son and daughters out in
[1:46:31] the world the truth is they're coming
[1:46:32] back
[1:46:34] Hallelujah
[1:46:39] yes there have been false doctrines yes
[1:46:42] Pentecost had failed but the king said I
[1:46:45] will restore
[1:46:47] [Applause]
[1:46:49] the king said you can have whatever you
[1:46:52] have need of to finish the job
[1:46:55] Ezra 5 1.
[1:46:57] then the prophet saw the prophet
[1:47:00] and Zechariah the son of Edo prophesied
[1:47:03] unto the Jews that were in Judah and
[1:47:04] Jerusalem in the name of the god of
[1:47:06] Israel even unto them then rose up
[1:47:09] cerebral the son of Chateau and Joshua
[1:47:11] the son of Joe sadak and began to build
[1:47:13] the house of God which is at Jerusalem
[1:47:15] and with them were the prophets of God
[1:47:19] helping them
[1:47:21] in response to the enemy trying to stop
[1:47:23] the restoration God sends a prophet
[1:47:30] again look into that message and they
[1:47:32] look at the prophecy and they say we
[1:47:34] ain't stopping I don't care what the
[1:47:36] facts stacked up saying my message says
[1:47:38] billed the prophets say build I'm going
[1:47:41] all the way back to Pentecost I'm going
[1:47:43] all the way back to the land I'm not
[1:47:45] stopping short and to begin to build and
[1:47:47] there's a drive within them
[1:47:50] there's a drive in a people today he
[1:47:52] says I'm going all the way back to
[1:47:53] Pentecost I'm not stopping
[1:47:56] oh and the devil didn't like that
[1:47:59] now who Do You Think You Are
[1:48:02] so in verse 3 it says at the same time
[1:48:05] came to them tonight the governor on
[1:48:07] this side of the river
[1:48:09] and set their bosn I and their
[1:48:11] Companions and said that son to them who
[1:48:13] hath commanded you to build this house
[1:48:16] and to make up this wall
[1:48:19] and once again they write
[1:48:21] to the king
[1:48:24] be it known unto the king that we went
[1:48:26] into the province of Judea to the house
[1:48:28] of the great God which is builded with
[1:48:30] great stones and Timber is laid in the
[1:48:32] walls and this work goeth fast on
[1:48:35] Hallelujah
[1:48:37] and prospers in their hands I say
[1:48:39] hallelujah then ask we those elders and
[1:48:42] said unto them who commanded you to
[1:48:44] build this house and make up these walls
[1:48:46] we ask their names also to certify thee
[1:48:48] that we might write their names of the
[1:48:50] men that were the chief of them and thus
[1:48:52] they returned us answers saying we are
[1:48:54] the Servants of the god of heavens and
[1:48:56] earth and build the house that was
[1:48:57] builded these many years ago which a
[1:49:00] great king of Israel built and set up
[1:49:02] but after that our fathers had provoked
[1:49:04] the god of Heaven under wrath he gave
[1:49:06] them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the
[1:49:08] king of Babylon the Chaldean who
[1:49:10] destroyed this house and carried the
[1:49:12] people away into Babylon but in the
[1:49:14] first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon
[1:49:16] the same King Cyrus made a decree to
[1:49:18] build this house of God and the vessels
[1:49:20] also of gold and the silver of the house
[1:49:22] of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of
[1:49:24] the temple that was in Jerusalem and
[1:49:26] brought them into the Temple of Babylon
[1:49:27] those did Cyrus the king take out of the
[1:49:30] Temple of Babylon and they were
[1:49:31] delivered unto one whose name was just
[1:49:34] bizarre whom he had made governor and he
[1:49:37] said unto them take these vessels go
[1:49:38] carry them into the temple that is in
[1:49:40] Jerusalem and let the house of God be
[1:49:42] builded in this place then came the same
[1:49:44] chest Bazaar and laid the foundation of
[1:49:46] the house of God which is in Jerusalem
[1:49:48] and since that time even until now it
[1:49:50] hath been built in building and yet it
[1:49:52] is not finished
[1:49:53] now therefore
[1:49:55] now we're getting there I know I've read
[1:49:57] a lot but we're getting there
[1:49:58] now therefore if it seemed Good To The
[1:50:01] King
[1:50:02] let there be a search made in the king's
[1:50:04] Treasure House which is there at Babylon
[1:50:07] whether it be so that a decree was made
[1:50:10] of Cyrus the king to build this house of
[1:50:13] God at Jerusalem and let the king send
[1:50:15] his pleasure to us concerning the matter
[1:50:19] we're going into chapter six now
[1:50:21] then Darius the king made a decree and a
[1:50:23] search was made
[1:50:25] Hallelujah of all the roles where the
[1:50:28] treasures were laid up in Babylon and
[1:50:30] there was found at agmouth and the
[1:50:31] palace that is in the province of the
[1:50:33] media role and therein was a record thus
[1:50:36] written in the first year of Cyrus the
[1:50:38] King the same Cyrus the king made it a
[1:50:41] Cree concerning the house of God at
[1:50:42] Jerusalem let the house be builded the
[1:50:46] place where they offered sacrifices let
[1:50:48] the foundations thereof be strongly laid
[1:50:50] and the height thereof three score
[1:50:52] Cupids and the breadth thereof three
[1:50:54] score cubits with great rows of great
[1:50:56] stones in a row of new Timber and let
[1:50:59] the expenses be given out of the King's
[1:51:01] house and also let the gold and silver
[1:51:03] vessels of the house of God which
[1:51:05] Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the
[1:51:07] temple which is at Jerusalem and brought
[1:51:09] into Babylon be restored and brought
[1:51:11] again into the temple which is at
[1:51:13] Jerusalem everyone to his place and
[1:51:15] place them in the house of God now
[1:51:18] therefore it's happening the governor
[1:51:19] beyond the river Seth bazana and the
[1:51:22] companions of the aparca sites which are
[1:51:24] beyond the river
[1:51:25] be ye far from this in other words get
[1:51:29] away from these people quit bothering
[1:51:32] these people this is not a cream get
[1:51:35] back get away
[1:51:38] he says let the work of the house of God
[1:51:40] alone let the governor of the Jews and
[1:51:42] the Elders of the Jews build this house
[1:51:44] of God in his place moreover
[1:51:47] I make a decree that you shall do to the
[1:51:49] elders and these Jews for the building
[1:51:51] of this house of God that of the king's
[1:51:53] Goods even of the tribute behind the
[1:51:56] river forth with expenses be given unto
[1:51:59] these men I want you to pay for this
[1:52:02] [Applause]

[1:52:07] ages and that which they have neither
[1:52:09] both young bullets and Rams and Lambs
[1:52:11] for burnt offerings of the god of Heaven

[1:52:17] appointment of the priests which are at

[1:57:12] had a point and I'm trying to get to it
[1:57:17] thank you
[1:57:22] not everyone returned
[1:57:26] only the ones that God had moved upon
[1:57:28] their heart
[1:57:31] but the ones that return came because
[1:57:32] they wanted to worship Jehovah
[1:57:35] the way that they were called to
[1:57:37] and they wanted to be in the place that
[1:57:39] they were called to be in
[1:57:42] they had to be where he had called them
[1:57:44] to be because there was something moving
[1:57:46] them back
[1:57:47] there was something driving them back
[1:57:50] something calling come out of her my
[1:57:52] people
[1:57:53] something on the inside turning their
[1:57:55] hearts back to the land of their fathers
[1:57:59] Israel had to be established
[1:58:03] there was a word that prophesied there
[1:58:06] was a messiah coming
[1:58:09] he was to be born in Bethlehem Bethlehem
[1:58:12] had to be there
[1:58:13] the people had to be there
[1:58:16] Jerusalem had to be rebuilt
[1:58:19] the Messiah was to come there Zechariah
[1:58:22] 9 9 Rejoice greatly o daughter of Zion's
[1:58:24] Shadow daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy
[1:58:26] King cometh unto thee he is just in
[1:58:28] having salvation lowly and riding upon a
[1:58:31] house and upon a cult the foe of an ass
[1:58:34] they had to return
[1:58:37] in order to receive their promise
[1:58:41] they couldn't receive it in Babylon
[1:58:44] but something drove them to return they
[1:58:47] were driven they had a mind to work they
[1:58:48] had to be there things had to be ready
[1:58:50] and they worked and they built to get
[1:58:53] back to what the original was
[1:58:55] Ezra 3 12
[1:58:58] but many of the priests and Levites and
[1:59:01] the chief of the fathers who were
[1:59:03] ancient men that had seen the first
[1:59:04] house
[1:59:05] when the foundation of this house was
[1:59:07] laid before their eyes
[1:59:09] wept with a loud voice
[1:59:12] they felt like they failed
[1:59:17] we saw who saw what it used to be
[1:59:20] they had such Glory it was so
[1:59:22] magnificent
[1:59:23] this doesn't compare
[1:59:25] this has fallen short
[1:59:28] I got 2-1
[1:59:30] it says in the seventh month in the one
[1:59:33] and twentieth day of the month came the
[1:59:34] word of the Lord by the prophet haggai
[1:59:36] saying speak now to zeruble son of
[1:59:39] chattel the governor of Judah and to
[1:59:41] Joshua the son of Joe sedek the high
[1:59:43] priest and to the residue of the people
[1:59:44] saying
[1:59:46] who is left among you that saw this
[1:59:48] house in her first glory and how do you
[1:59:51] see it now
[1:59:52] is it not in your eyes in comparison of
[1:59:54] it as nothing
[1:59:57] the Ark of the Covenant is not there
[2:00:01] right you're in my thumb is not there
[2:00:03] it didn't have the fire that originally
[2:00:05] fell from heaven there
[2:00:08] verse 4 yet now be strong
[2:00:11] Jose rubel saith the Lord and be strong
[2:00:13] o Joshua son of Joseph the high priest
[2:00:16] and be strong all you people of the land
[2:00:17] saith the Lord and work for I Am with
[2:00:20] You saith the Lord of hosts according to
[2:00:22] the word that I covenanted with you when
[2:00:24] you came out of Egypt so my spirit
[2:00:25] remaineth among you fear not for thus
[2:00:28] saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a
[2:00:30] little while and I will shake the
[2:00:31] heavens and the earth and the Sea and
[2:00:33] the dry land and I will shake all
[2:00:35] nations in the desire of all Nations
[2:00:36] shall come and I will fill this house
[2:00:38] with Glory saith the Lord of hosts
[2:00:41] what's he telling them just a little
[2:00:43] while in the Messiah himself is going to
[2:00:45] be here just a little while in the
[2:00:47] Messiah himself is going to walk in this
[2:00:49] Temple he says the silver is mine the
[2:00:52] Gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts the
[2:00:54] glory of this latter house shall be
[2:00:57] greater than the former saith the Lord
[2:00:59] of hosts and in this place will I get
[2:01:01] peace saith the Lord of hosts in other
[2:01:03] words don't worry about the silver don't
[2:01:05] worry about the gold don't worry about
[2:01:07] what you built that all belongs to me
[2:01:09] anyway what's going to make this house
[2:01:11] so glory is I'm going to walk in it the
[2:01:14] Messiah is going to be dedicated here
[2:01:16] he's going to preach here he's going to
[2:01:18] move through it on a daily basis his
[2:01:20] glory he's going to fill the temple
[2:01:23] and that's why they had to be in that
[2:01:25] place
[2:01:26] why did we have to come back
[2:01:28] why were we driven out of the
[2:01:30] denominations
[2:01:31] oh we look around and maybe we don't
[2:01:33] compare to their grander it's not as big
[2:01:36] Lord we tried
[2:01:38] Lord we've done the best we could with
[2:01:39] the message
[2:01:41] we've stood we're still staying and it's
[2:01:43] an evil day
[2:01:44] we're doing our best but it just don't
[2:01:46] compare look at that first stage
[2:01:49] rugged Man
[2:01:50] men who gave their lives
[2:01:52] men who died look at the Miracles look
[2:01:56] what they've done Lord
[2:01:59] and he says
[2:02:00] but the crowning Glory of this age why
[2:02:03] did I have to come back because this is
[2:02:06] where the Messiah is coming he's coming
[2:02:08] back to the original he's coming back to
[2:02:11] the Homeland and the glory of this age
[2:02:13] will far exceed the previous ages
[2:02:16] because we're going to receive the
[2:02:18] Messiah we're going to receive the body
[2:02:21] change and we come back to receive I
[2:02:25] have returned to receive and I won't

[2:06:17] but Nehemiah said I'm up on the wall I'm
[2:06:21] doing a good work and I ain't coming
[2:06:23] down

[2:12:02] we've searched the records
[2:12:06] and whenever Peter and them baptize
[2:12:08] people they probably didn't have this
[2:12:10] dry minister baptistry they didn't have
[2:12:13] a nice warm place to baptize them it
[2:12:15] might have been Creeks ponds rivers we
[2:12:17] don't know there's been millions of them
[2:12:20] baptized the way we're fixing to baptize
[2:12:22] our brother because we've searched the
[2:12:24] records we've not found anywhere in the
[2:12:27] entire New Testament where anyone was
[2:12:30] ever baptized using the titles of father
[2:12:33] son Holy Ghost
[2:12:35] so what we found was they used the
[2:12:38] precious name of Jesus and we're so glad
[2:12:41] that we've been restored aren't we back
[2:12:44] to that original word let's pray

[2:13:03] and we don't know how many more they'll
[2:13:05] be but one day the last Stone will be
[2:13:07] brought into its place and the glory of
[2:13:10] God will fill the church in such a way
[2:13:12] the dead in Christ shall rise first and
[2:13:16] we which are alive and remain will be
[2:13:18] changed dear God as we baptize our
