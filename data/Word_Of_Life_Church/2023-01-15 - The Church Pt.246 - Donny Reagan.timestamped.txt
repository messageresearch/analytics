[45:43] about to announce their engagement of
[45:45] their
[45:45] daughter Emma
[45:48] to John Michael Laster
[45:51] I told him the other day he finally must
[45:53] have proved himself enough to get
[45:55] Daddy's permission
[45:58] I think he had a hard time doing it too
[46:01] let's just give him a nice time
[46:02] [Applause]
[46:09] being a daddy with two girls when you
[46:11] get ready to give him away I'll tell you
[46:12] it takes
[46:13] pretty good man to be able to get him
[46:15] from your heart because you love them
[46:17] that's right
[46:20] Proverbs chapter 31.
[46:22] verse 10.
[46:26] who can find
[46:29] a virtuous woman
[46:32] for her price
[46:34] is far above rubies
[46:37] the heart of her husband
[46:40] death safely trust in her
[46:44] so that he shall have
[46:46] no need of spoil what a woman
[46:51] she will do him good
[46:54] and not evil
[46:56] all the days
[47:00] I've always loved these scriptures since
[47:03] I've started reading them just as a boy
[47:06] but once I began to realize
[47:10] who these were written about
[47:12] I've really loved them more
[47:14] especially when you consider it was
[47:16] written about
[47:18] Bathsheba
[47:21] so how could this woman been a temptress
[47:23] a seductress
[47:25] a woman who did something ungodly to get
[47:28] the attention
[47:29] of the king
[47:31] David and this ever be said about her
[47:34] couldn't have been of course
[47:36] it's not to me the Marvel that she was
[47:39] that but how she could deal with all the
[47:41] trauma
[47:43] complexes fears anxieties
[47:46] that she brought to the Palace and still
[47:49] able to become
[47:51] this type of woman
[47:53] I mean I'd like to be remembered today
[47:55] as we pray God bless you Mrs holder
[47:57] needs our requests in our hearts
[48:01] Heavenly fathers we Bower hits in your
[48:04] presence
[48:07] we sense that you're here
[48:10] we believe that you've come once again
[48:13] that you could speak to us
[48:16] Lord God I pray that
[48:19] you would take charge of the service
[48:24] help me Lord God
[48:26] that I can speak that which is pleasing
[48:29] to you shout my mouth to anything that
[48:31] would displease you
[48:33] May every heart be opened
[48:36] May every life
[48:38] be challenged changed
[48:41] by the word of God
[48:43] you see the needs Lord of our people
[48:45] many are sick many are dealing with
[48:47] various things in their bodies
[48:49] we bring them before you today Lord
[48:52] asking you that should be mindful
[48:55] but I pray you'd go even deeper than our
[48:58] body today
[49:00] are you going to our spirits
[49:02] may you go into our conscience
[49:05] our memory
[49:07] and you go into our souls
[49:09] woo us with your being father
[49:13] pull us up close to you
[49:16] that we can hear you whisper
[49:18] secrets
[49:20] secrets that's only given to the bride
[49:24] of Your Love
[49:26] your purpose your plan for each of Our
[49:28] Lives
[49:30] help us today Father in the name of
[49:32] Jesus we pray
[49:34] amen
[49:35] God bless you you may be seated
[49:48] I'm sure as we sit here today gathered
[49:50] in this place we've come with
[49:53] different needs different desires
[49:55] different requests on our hearts before
[49:57] the Lord
[50:01] I believe that the Lord is so mindful of
[50:04] every one of us
[50:06] no matter what you need no matter what
[50:08] you've been through what you're
[50:10] currently going through
[50:13] the Lord Jesus
[50:15] in his love to
[50:17] come and redeem us
[50:19] so much so that he would become
[50:21] one of us
[50:23] I know I've preached about it a lot
[50:25] you've heard it preached many of you
[50:26] since you first gave your heart to the
[50:29] Lord of what he became and his great Act
[50:32] of condescension
[50:34] I wonder sometimes
[50:36] how much I still know about it
[50:38] the more I read about it as I was last
[50:41] night
[50:43] the more I realized there was an Avenue
[50:45] about him that I still need help with
[50:49] not that I don't believe him I do
[50:53] but to be able to see how far he's
[50:55] stepped down and what he was willing to
[50:58] become
[50:59] in order to redeem us because his love
[51:03] is so great and we know that in his love
[51:06] we sometimes measure it by human love
[51:10] Carol and I took Erica down to Nashville
[51:13] the other day to get a treatment and
[51:15] seeing her and and quite a bit of pain
[51:19] and discomfort and stuff coming back
[51:21] looking at her and
[51:23] um just watching her and having to go
[51:25] down and pray for her after we brought
[51:27] her home and as her parents looking at
[51:30] her and feeling this in you how it
[51:34] breaks your heart and many of you have
[51:37] felt the same way about loved ones and
[51:39] friends and you look at them and you
[51:41] hurt so deeply you wish there was
[51:44] something you could do to change it to
[51:48] fix it to make it better
[51:50] and yet we know God looks at people's
[51:53] hurts and their pains and the things
[51:55] they deal with and he looks at it in a
[51:58] different way than we do we look with a
[52:01] human empathy a human sympathy and
[52:04] compassion and we feel so sorry for them
[52:07] but yet the Lord looks at people in a
[52:10] way that is so different than we do
[52:12] because he's looking at the bigger
[52:15] picture of what he wants to accomplish
[52:17] out of something that he allows them to
[52:20] go through now let me say before we get
[52:23] started in this direction this morning
[52:25] I don't believe that God is the
[52:28] orchestrator of many things that has
[52:31] happened to many of us in our lives I
[52:34] don't believe that God is a murderer of
[52:37] the innocent I do not believe that God
[52:39] is the cause of many things that
[52:42] happened in your life in my life lives
[52:45] of other people people want to blame God
[52:47] for many things that the devil does that
[52:50] always bothers me whenever I hear people
[52:52] blaming God for things the devil does
[52:55] whether they're Christians or Sinners it
[52:57] bothers me more so when I hear
[52:58] Christians say well God told me to do
[53:00] this and I look in his word and I'm
[53:01] saying there ain't no way my daddy told
[53:03] you to do something contrary to his
[53:05] scripture he just don't do any such
[53:07] thing
[53:08] but yet we know that God looks with a
[53:11] different a different view than we do
[53:14] and how can God look at people in their
[53:17] suffering and how can God look at people
[53:20] when they're going through so much stuff
[53:22] in life and he wouldn't even have to
[53:24] speak all he'd have to do is just look
[53:26] their Direction and that problem would
[53:29] totally be eliminated and they would be
[53:31] set free delivered healed or whatever it
[53:33] was they was going through and yet why
[53:36] does he allow it to go on why does God
[53:39] allow people sometimes good people
[53:42] people that really are not reaping
[53:44] because of something they've done and
[53:47] yet they suffer so much and go through
[53:50] so many things and then Satan of course
[53:53] loves to take those things and twist
[53:55] them around in our minds and try to make
[53:59] us question our God but myself is an
[54:02] individual I call that a no-fly zone I
[54:06] don't fly there because I'll never
[54:08] understand stand all the mind of God nor
[54:10] the will of God and you won't either but
[54:13] I've learned to trust him even when I
[54:15] don't understand what he's doing because
[54:18] I believe Divine sovereignty is that
[54:21] Progressive attitude of God that will
[54:24] override human circumstance in order to
[54:27] make his will come to pass in our lives
[54:30] I believe in that myself
[54:32] but I look and I realize that God then
[54:35] is not always the cause of terrible
[54:38] things happening to good people but God
[54:41] in turn will turn around and use some of
[54:44] those terrible things that that have
[54:47] happened to people and make them work
[54:49] out to where that he can use them for
[54:52] his own honor and Glory how many seen
[54:55] that in your own life or the life of
[54:56] others now it's not that God himself was
[54:59] the cause or the instigator of the thing
[55:02] that happened but he will turn it around
[55:04] and make it work to his own glory and
[55:08] this is what I see about the story of
[55:11] David and Bathsheba that we've been
[55:13] looking at that the Lord would allow
[55:15] Bathsheba one which was brought into the
[55:18] first view of the scripture we know
[55:21] nothing about our past we know nothing
[55:22] about her childhood nothing about her
[55:25] hardly at all other than her first
[55:27] appearance is whenever she's brought
[55:29] into the Palace of King David and we or
[55:33] looked at it for a few weeks now seeing
[55:34] it was beyond her own choice she had no
[55:37] choice to do this David never loved her
[55:40] he never cared for her initially he
[55:42] lusted after her would just be honest
[55:44] and Frank David was a great man but he
[55:47] was a man and David made a terrible
[55:50] terrible mistake and he paid for it the
[55:52] rest of his life is that right
[55:54] but yet God did not Mark David off and
[55:57] neither did God break his Everlasting
[55:59] Covenant with David So Bathsheba had to
[56:03] bring a lot of things with her no doubt
[56:06] into the Palace of the king and as I've
[56:09] been looking at this I've realized that
[56:11] God merged her into the natural
[56:14] genealogy of the Lord Jesus in order to
[56:18] bring a picture and to be able to
[56:20] display the picture of the making of the
[56:23] Gentile bride that God brought in Rahab
[56:26] for an element God brought in Tamar and
[56:29] God brought in these others and then God
[56:32] brings the last woman which is Mary
[56:35] which is the epitome of a virgin bride
[56:38] which speaks of your soul and yet God
[56:41] allowed these which were scarred and
[56:44] these which were wounded by others and
[56:47] some of them by themselves things that
[56:49] they did and brought on their self and
[56:52] the Lord never looked at them and said
[56:53] you know what you've got not a bad
[56:55] background you've got a bad pass I
[56:58] really don't think it would be worse me
[57:01] risking you to identify you and my
[57:05] genealogy now the truth of it is there's
[57:07] probably every one of us here today that
[57:09] have people in our families and people
[57:11] in our family tree I've never been too
[57:14] concerned about looking up my family
[57:15] tree and finding monkeys because I know
[57:18] I didn't come from a monkey but what I'd
[57:20] be more ashamed of of some of my family
[57:22] not not afraid of baboon will be up my
[57:24] family tree it's some of them gangsters
[57:27] and robbers and you know Train Robbers
[57:29] and this and that and the other and
[57:30] don't some of y'all smile because they
[57:32] stole your horse
[57:33] and they did because you stole their Pig
[57:37] so all of us are from the same bucket of
[57:40] gum and mess when it comes to humanity
[57:43] ain't that the truth so all of us I'm
[57:46] sure wouldn't have to look very far to
[57:48] find people in our family tree that have
[57:50] done some pretty terrible things and
[57:52] some of you might not have to look past
[57:54] yourself but needless to say the Lord
[57:57] does not hold that against us and that
[58:00] he will not allow us to be something
[58:03] greater than what we even are right now
[58:06] I saw a sign the other day and I thought
[58:08] it was a remarkable sign and it said
[58:11] these words don't let what you currently
[58:13] are hinder you from becoming what your
[58:17] full potential really is and I thought
[58:19] that's a wonderful thing that even what
[58:22] we are today I personally don't think
[58:24] that I've reached my Heights in Christ
[58:26] Jesus I think there's more for me I mean
[58:29] he believes the same thing I believe
[58:31] there's a deeper want a greater
[58:32] understanding oh but you're an old man I
[58:35] realize that but I'm still younger than
[58:37] Abraham was when God started dealing
[58:39] with them so haha devil look out here I
[58:42] come so God started dealing with Abraham
[58:45] when he was 75 years old I'm just 66 so
[58:48] I'm still a young man by that standard
[58:50] but we can look at our past and look at
[58:53] our failures and if we're not careful we
[58:55] will let that determine what we think
[58:57] God will do for us and God's looking at
[59:00] it in a total different way
[59:03] let me start this with this this morning
[59:05] in a sermon called the Great Mighty
[59:07] conquer before any Victory can be won
[59:10] there must be great prices to be paid oh
[59:15] what prices and sometimes they are very
[59:18] deep and they make very great scars
[59:21] tearing down but in order to have the
[59:25] mountain we've got to have the valley
[59:27] before you can have the sunshine we've
[59:30] got to have rain before we can have the
[59:33] light we have to have the night or the
[59:36] light rather before we can have the
[59:38] right we have to have wrong and you
[59:41] would have never known what wrong was
[59:43] now here brother random I love the way
[59:47] that he projects the full gospel because
[59:49] he preaches healing he preaches Miracles
[59:53] he preaches the supernatural the
[59:55] phenomenal power of God but he also
[59:58] preaches where we live every day of our
[1:00:01] life how many beliefs and miracles he
[1:00:03] healing signs wonders Supernatural but
[1:00:06] how many also knows you got trials you
[1:00:08] got tests of life you got difficulties
[1:00:11] well you know this is the way I see that
[1:00:14] as a preacher I want to preach the
[1:00:17] message as well that I want to preach a
[1:00:19] God that is so mighty and so great and
[1:00:22] so wonderful there's absolutely nothing
[1:00:25] we can ever go through that he can't
[1:00:27] bring us through that I also want to
[1:00:29] preach life in a realism form and that
[1:00:33] is that you're going to have tests
[1:00:34] trials people aren't going to love you
[1:00:37] you're not going to everybody that comes
[1:00:39] to the Lord Jesus is not going to be a
[1:00:42] millionaire sorry if you thought you
[1:00:44] were I hate to bust your balloon but
[1:00:46] some of you are not going to be
[1:00:47] billionaires and millionaires some of
[1:00:49] you won't even be thousand heirs
[1:00:52] that's right some of you is going to
[1:00:54] struggle it's just the way it is you're
[1:00:56] never going to get up every day of your
[1:00:58] life and never have a sickness that's
[1:01:00] not reality but I want to preach to you
[1:01:02] that if you do have sickness you have a
[1:01:05] Healer and if you have a need to have a
[1:01:07] mighty God that is bigger than ever need
[1:01:09] you will ever have in this life
[1:01:13] I love the way that our Prophet stands
[1:01:16] in this aspect and brings these things
[1:01:18] to us notice again from his personal
[1:01:21] perspective now and the reproach of the
[1:01:24] cause of the word my heart has got so
[1:01:27] many scars on it Lord
[1:01:30] from hard battles
[1:01:33] I'm an old veteran
[1:01:35] help me Lord
[1:01:38] I need your help
[1:01:40] now what I hear from this is not the
[1:01:44] mighty Elijah
[1:01:46] standing there before the false prophets
[1:01:49] of Baal
[1:01:51] I don't hear Elijah when he calls for
[1:01:54] the two she bears come destroy the
[1:01:57] children
[1:01:58] I don't hear the mighty conquering
[1:02:01] Elijah as he rebuilds The Altar and
[1:02:04] calls for the spirit of God to come down
[1:02:08] but I hear from a man Anointed with that
[1:02:11] spirit
[1:02:12] that is giving us an inside view
[1:02:15] of a hurt wounded
[1:02:18] individual
[1:02:20] any of them type of people here today
[1:02:24] now he gives us a little tiny glimpse
[1:02:29] inside of his heart
[1:02:32] his heart
[1:02:34] now we tend to rejoice in the Miracles
[1:02:36] the signs the Wonders the phenomenon
[1:02:40] I'll read you about some of them in a
[1:02:41] few minutes
[1:02:42] but myself I know I'm weird I know but
[1:02:46] myself I absolutely love quotes just
[1:02:50] like this one
[1:02:51] because it helps me to relate as a
[1:02:56] minister as the Son of God and I trust
[1:02:59] it'll help you relate today
[1:03:01] my heart's got so many scars on it Lord
[1:03:04] from hard battles I'm an old veteran
[1:03:07] help me Lord
[1:03:10] I need help
[1:03:12] maybe all this training has been for a
[1:03:15] purpose I trust it has been Lord help me
[1:03:19] oh God
[1:03:22] help me oh God
[1:03:26] so we have to believe either one of two
[1:03:29] things
[1:03:30] from this statement
[1:03:32] this is only
[1:03:34] an act
[1:03:36] this is only a put on
[1:03:39] that this man was not sincere
[1:03:42] or this is the sincere cry
[1:03:46] of a great veteran Warrior
[1:03:51] I know what I believe
[1:03:53] what do you believe
[1:03:55] you believe it's a veteran Warrior
[1:03:58] I thought so
[1:04:00] so then this Warrior
[1:04:02] is asking God for hell for what to cast
[1:04:07] out another devil
[1:04:09] to be able to lay hands on a cross-eyed
[1:04:12] child
[1:04:14] that God would heal it
[1:04:15] no
[1:04:16] help
[1:04:18] help
[1:04:20] from wounds and scars battles
[1:04:24] he must have been feeling
[1:04:26] kind of weary
[1:04:28] anybody in your ever get there
[1:04:30] well the rest of you Godly angels that
[1:04:33] are here today would you remember us
[1:04:34] four Mortals
[1:04:38] now let me share this with you
[1:04:42] I have never seen
[1:04:46] any cross-eyed child
[1:04:50] ever come to the platform
[1:04:53] but what was healed
[1:04:57] better than 300
[1:05:00] cases
[1:05:02] of cross-eyed children
[1:05:05] have been healed
[1:05:07] and less than six months
[1:05:10] time
[1:05:14] now those of you who want to believe
[1:05:15] that brother Brandon was a false prophet
[1:05:17] and those who have attacked him and you
[1:05:19] feel like you've been sent by God to
[1:05:21] straighten us out
[1:05:24] I'm going to ask you to do 300
[1:05:27] I'll ask you to perform three
[1:05:30] and then I'll sit down and talk with you
[1:05:35] let me know when you do it
[1:05:39] but until we'll follow this
[1:05:49] better than 300 cases
[1:05:52] of cross-eyed children that were healed
[1:05:55] in less than six months
[1:05:58] we have a record of it
[1:06:01] 40
[1:06:03] 000 testimonies
[1:06:05] to the sick to date of healing Witnesses
[1:06:10] signed by doctors
[1:06:14] forty thousand
[1:06:17] healings
[1:06:19] to date this is 19 and 50.
[1:06:23] signed by doctors again we won't require
[1:06:27] 40 000 of you
[1:06:30] what about four
[1:06:34] and until you can keep your mouth off of
[1:06:40] God's prophet
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:50] now wonder why
[1:06:53] there was never
[1:06:58] across a child
[1:07:03] that ever come across the platform
[1:07:06] that was never healed
[1:07:09] not
[1:07:10] what
[1:07:14] Wonder
[1:07:15] why
[1:07:18] an embedded scar
[1:07:22] on a servant's heart
[1:07:28] speaking about his little
[1:07:30] eight-month-old daughter
[1:07:33] I'll never forget she was eight months
[1:07:36] old and I remember I used to come home
[1:07:37] and she'd sat down in the yard
[1:07:39] and I'd blow my horn and come around the
[1:07:43] corner and she'd go goo goo
[1:07:47] and she'd reach
[1:07:49] I love those little fellas
[1:07:52] now he reverts from that back to when
[1:07:54] she was dying
[1:07:56] she was suffering so hard to one of them
[1:07:58] little fat legs was moving up and down
[1:08:00] in a spasm and looked like her little
[1:08:02] hand was waving and I looked at her and
[1:08:05] I said Sherry honey you know Daddy
[1:08:08] I was trying to make myself strong and I
[1:08:10] said you know Daddy honey
[1:08:13] her little lips got to quiff it
[1:08:19] she looked at me
[1:08:20] she was suffering
[1:08:22] so hard
[1:08:25] till her eyes
[1:08:27] crossed
[1:08:31] her eyes crossed
[1:08:33] I imagine Satan stood there and laughed
[1:08:40] but he will pay
[1:08:44] little did he know
[1:08:47] one cross-eyed child
[1:08:50] would cost him one after another after
[1:08:53] another after another hundreds of
[1:08:56] thousands of them
[1:09:00] did God do this it wasn't God
[1:09:03] but God took what had happened
[1:09:06] and did something out of the life of
[1:09:09] this man
[1:09:11] the point I want you to see today is
[1:09:14] friends what will we do
[1:09:17] what's the negative things in life that
[1:09:19] we've been through
[1:09:21] whether people have intentionally hurt
[1:09:24] us or not intentionally hurt us or have
[1:09:26] been let down or disappointed or
[1:09:28] whatever more
[1:09:29] will we spend our life in inside for
[1:09:32] ourself and just you know poor little me
[1:09:35] poor little me or will we allow God
[1:09:39] to take the things we've been through
[1:09:41] like Bathsheba a woman who was defiled
[1:09:45] the prophet said David defiled his
[1:09:48] neighbor's wife
[1:09:50] David was the one who instigated this
[1:09:54] evil and this wrong but we don't find
[1:09:56] Bathsheba turning into the type of woman
[1:09:59] that set around the palace all day and
[1:10:02] did absolutely nothing feeling so sorry
[1:10:04] for herself but she is the very epitome
[1:10:08] of what an honorable virtuous woman
[1:10:11] should be even for the New Testament
[1:10:14] Daughters of God
[1:10:16] so it depends on what we do with what
[1:10:20] life gives us
[1:10:22] brother random calls it the human grab
[1:10:25] bag
[1:10:27] the human grab bag
[1:10:29] so out of the human grab bag we can get
[1:10:32] all types of sickness and afflictions
[1:10:34] and complexes and fears and Trauma and
[1:10:38] so much stuff that we inherit from our
[1:10:40] parents or our grandparents or uncles
[1:10:43] and then all the other stuff that's
[1:10:45] placed upon us through our short span of
[1:10:47] life and then we go to looking at
[1:10:49] serving God and we bring all this stuff
[1:10:52] to him Lord here I am what do you what
[1:10:55] can you do with me what what can you do
[1:10:58] with me Lord well I've got this fear and
[1:11:00] I've got I don't trust preachers and I
[1:11:02] don't trust men and I don't trust women
[1:11:04] I don't I don't like this and I don't
[1:11:06] like that and I've got racial problems
[1:11:09] and I've got this problem and now if
[1:11:11] there's anything you can do with me God
[1:11:13] yeah I am
[1:11:15] go ahead
[1:11:19] well the first thing he needs to change
[1:11:22] is our attitude
[1:11:31] now listen how that he unveils this part
[1:11:33] this is 1950 by now he's found out
[1:11:37] I didn't know it then but I understand
[1:11:40] it now
[1:11:42] there has never
[1:11:45] been a cross-eyed child that come in the
[1:11:47] line
[1:11:48] there's never been one
[1:11:51] that placed over the platform
[1:11:53] that was healed
[1:11:55] I didn't know the crushing
[1:12:00] that it had to bring forth
[1:12:02] but I never see it
[1:12:05] I never see it till I think of it so you
[1:12:08] can imagine every child black white red
[1:12:10] yellow make no difference what size they
[1:12:12] were how old they were but every one of
[1:12:15] them that would walk up there before him
[1:12:17] who would he see
[1:12:19] not just that child
[1:12:21] but his own daughter
[1:12:23] Sharon Rose
[1:12:25] anybody here that has lost a loved one
[1:12:28] to cancer
[1:12:29] and whenever you do there's something
[1:12:32] about that oh you hear you know people
[1:12:35] and friends and relatives and that had
[1:12:37] it and they passed away oh that's
[1:12:39] terrible that's terrible but when it
[1:12:40] happens to you there's something about
[1:12:43] it it affects you in a more personal way
[1:12:48] as a pastor I hate cancer
[1:12:51] I hate covet I hate different diseases
[1:12:55] that have come and attacked people in
[1:12:58] our church I hate it because as a pastor
[1:13:01] God gives me a charge to watch over my
[1:13:05] sheep and I do everything in my power I
[1:13:08] hate it when disease strikes God's
[1:13:11] people don't you I hate it when it comes
[1:13:14] and it gives me something inside now I
[1:13:17] hope you understand that God will layer
[1:13:20] the supernatural many times over the top
[1:13:23] of the natural makeup that he allowed to
[1:13:26] be molded in US can't you see what God
[1:13:29] did in the prophet that God layered the
[1:13:32] Supernatural and brother random is not
[1:13:35] standing there out of human anger
[1:13:37] because we don't cast out Devils out of
[1:13:39] human anger we don't cast out Devils by
[1:13:41] a loud screaming voice but we cast them
[1:13:44] out by Authority but God layered the
[1:13:48] supernatural over the top of the natural
[1:13:50] and then when this Prophet spoke him on
[1:13:53] a person to walk up and he would see
[1:13:56] them there in that condition and what
[1:13:58] happened something from within was an
[1:14:01] empathy that could never be bred into he
[1:14:05] could have read all kinds of books of
[1:14:07] people who had lost a child and the baby
[1:14:09] had died with the eyes being crossed it
[1:14:12] would have never had the same impact
[1:14:14] upon him but it happened to him do you
[1:14:19] understand those of you sit here today
[1:14:21] and you've got hurts and issues and
[1:14:23] scars and things like that instead of
[1:14:25] allowing those things to control you why
[1:14:28] don't you let God layer over those hurts
[1:14:31] and let God be able to use you as a
[1:14:35] witness and you will be able to tell
[1:14:37] other people in a way that maybe I could
[1:14:39] not tell them look brother sister you
[1:14:42] can allow God to take those things and
[1:14:45] turn them into something that will
[1:14:47] expand your testimony to others and you
[1:14:50] can tell others God can help you through
[1:14:53] hurts and God can help you through
[1:14:56] disappointments and God can help you
[1:14:58] through sad times or
[1:15:01] you can sit around and feel sorry for
[1:15:03] yourself
[1:15:04] and struggle and not do anything for the
[1:15:07] kingdom of God
[1:15:09] I refuse to be a victim of pain
[1:15:15] I refuse to be a victim of being wounded
[1:15:19] and hurt by this and that and the other
[1:15:22] instead I choose to be an instrument of
[1:15:27] healing through my pain an instrument of
[1:15:31] healing through my loss anybody know
[1:15:34] what I'm saying so we take what we've
[1:15:37] went through in life and allow God to
[1:15:39] turn around and mold it and make it into
[1:15:42] something to his honor
[1:15:46] you know I realize we're living in an
[1:15:48] age whenever everybody wants so many
[1:15:51] therapists and I'm not against
[1:15:53] therapists as long as they don't tell
[1:15:54] you something contrary to God's word but
[1:15:58] I know that there is an element of this
[1:16:00] about therapy and phobias and traumas my
[1:16:04] goodness I've never heard so many
[1:16:05] phobias in my life you know the when you
[1:16:08] go to read about it you can't even keep
[1:16:09] up they got so many phobias people now
[1:16:11] are being able to draw unemployment
[1:16:13] because they got a fear of covet so I
[1:16:16] think a lot of lazy folks are just you
[1:16:18] and using that so they can stay home and
[1:16:19] draw a chair well go ahead somebody
[1:16:21] praise the Lord that's all right but
[1:16:23] it's exactly what people want and then
[1:16:26] we have so many self-help books and
[1:16:29] really there's only one book that can
[1:16:31] help you out of all the things that
[1:16:34] Satan got you into and that is the word
[1:16:36] of God I don't care who writes you will
[1:16:39] say well I recommend this book from Dr
[1:16:41] Dobson and I recommend that book from Dr
[1:16:43] so and so and I recommend that book from
[1:16:45] Dr so and so well I recommend the Bible
[1:16:48] from Dr God because Dr God is the true
[1:16:51] physician and he won't tell you to leave
[1:16:54] your wife and his sir won't tell you
[1:16:55] women to cut your hair and he won't tell
[1:16:57] you men well you're going to that old
[1:16:59] legalistic church and you need to live a
[1:17:01] little bit there's only one way to
[1:17:03] really be able to live and that's in
[1:17:04] Christ Jesus
[1:17:07] do I believe phobias are real I do
[1:17:11] I deal with people who have them all the
[1:17:13] time
[1:17:15] listen to this how strange they can be
[1:17:18] I do not know you I've never seen you
[1:17:21] we are strangers but I notice around you
[1:17:25] you have a phobia
[1:17:28] of something
[1:17:30] you have a phobia of something
[1:17:33] about wintertime
[1:17:38] now how strange
[1:17:40] when winter time comes you resent it now
[1:17:45] can you imagine this might be your only
[1:17:47] opportunity that you get to stand before
[1:17:49] Elijah in your lifetime
[1:17:52] he doesn't tell you what a great
[1:17:54] Christian you are how many chapters you
[1:17:56] read before church how many times you
[1:17:59] pray a day how many times you fasted the
[1:18:02] great sacrifices you've given to the
[1:18:04] kingdom of God but before God and the
[1:18:07] devil and everybody else he tells you
[1:18:09] you've got a phobia of wintertime
[1:18:12] but you know what that's what this
[1:18:15] person needed to hear
[1:18:18] I imagine if God's Prophet was shared
[1:18:20] today and still Discerning I'd say that
[1:18:22] if he started with me and went down to
[1:18:25] every person here probably what he would
[1:18:27] tell us wouldn't be some great
[1:18:28] Supernatural something and people would
[1:18:30] be so overwhelmed by your spiritual
[1:18:33] wealth and your spiritual depth in God
[1:18:35] I'd say we'd more fine would find out
[1:18:38] more about one another's Humanity than
[1:18:40] we knew of knowing each other in decades
[1:18:43] because he probably wouldn't tell us
[1:18:45] great complementary things it would be
[1:18:47] such carnal stuff it would be fears and
[1:18:50] phobias and that well I was somebody who
[1:18:52] would preach with me this morning why
[1:18:54] because a lot of these things are what
[1:18:57] hinder our spirituality with God anyway
[1:18:59] it's things like this that hold us back
[1:19:03] from going on
[1:19:05] I want you to listen what A peculiar
[1:19:07] thing that he says
[1:19:09] when winter time comes you resent it
[1:19:13] you get scared
[1:19:15] when winter time comes and it makes you
[1:19:19] all upset
[1:19:21] and it makes you constipated
[1:19:25] wow
[1:19:27] so this poor person probably tried fiber
[1:19:30] they probably tried more apples more
[1:19:32] pears more prunes prune juice they got
[1:19:35] online and they Dr Googled it of course
[1:19:37] Dr Google wasn't in there then but today
[1:19:39] that's what we would do and they've done
[1:19:41] everything depending on whether they
[1:19:42] lean toward the natural means or they
[1:19:44] lean toward the medical process and they
[1:19:46] would go all natural if they were
[1:19:48] natural and there's all medical they'd
[1:19:49] go on medical and hear God's profit goes
[1:19:52] right down to the problem who what
[1:19:54] doctor What doctor would ever Associated
[1:19:57] a fear of wintertime to being the cause
[1:20:00] of constipation
[1:20:06] wow
[1:20:08] so I wonder how many things we're
[1:20:10] dealing with here today
[1:20:12] and we are treating the side effects
[1:20:15] with this and that and the other and
[1:20:17] we've got one tablet for this and
[1:20:18] another appeal for that and a shot for
[1:20:19] this and you know we read some new
[1:20:21] something another coming from way over
[1:20:23] there in some foreign country I don't
[1:20:24] know why it is but this is the Curiosity
[1:20:27] of human beings they found some nut that
[1:20:29] falls off of a tree and it you know it's
[1:20:31] grain in purple yellow striped and has
[1:20:33] white polka dots that run down the
[1:20:35] middle of it and it's this rare saying
[1:20:37] and they found out that when monkeys eat
[1:20:39] it that it caused them to do this and
[1:20:40] that and then somebody in a pyramid
[1:20:42] scheme wants you to be a partaker of it
[1:20:45] and then you have so many people under
[1:20:46] you and then people pop that peel whoa
[1:20:50] I feel so cooked wow
[1:20:54] they laced that with dope
[1:20:57] you better stay away from that bottle
[1:20:59] pop
[1:21:02] and then after a week or so oh I'm right
[1:21:06] back where I was shame on us
[1:21:09] shame on us for following all this stuff
[1:21:12] when really the reality is I the answer
[1:21:15] is the Lord Jesus
[1:21:23] now I want you to notice how the prophet
[1:21:26] deals with this phobia wintertime
[1:21:29] the side effect
[1:21:31] of constipation
[1:21:33] does it recommend apples prunes prune
[1:21:36] juice
[1:21:37] but he said ah curse
[1:21:41] that devil
[1:21:44] in the name
[1:21:46] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:48] go home
[1:21:50] it won't bother you no more
[1:21:55] left you
[1:21:57] oh Hallelujah
[1:22:00] I'll tell a friend brother brennaman
[1:22:02] here today Paul ain't here today James
[1:22:04] saying here today but the same Lord
[1:22:07] Jesus that made that devil leave that
[1:22:09] individual it's right here in this
[1:22:11] building today
[1:22:13] Hallelujah
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:23] this is from Dawson Creek British
[1:22:25] Columbia
[1:22:27] what's the matter Soldier Boy
[1:22:31] you're not going to commit suicide
[1:22:35] the devil's lying to you boy
[1:22:37] you remember the story about the Soulja
[1:22:40] Boy
[1:22:41] in British Columbia Dawson Creek
[1:22:44] you've only got a phobia
[1:22:50] he's lying to you
[1:22:52] he will drive you insane if you believe
[1:22:56] him
[1:22:57] you remember what this was homosexuality
[1:23:01] he will drive you insane if you believe
[1:23:04] him
[1:23:06] tender him
[1:23:09] renounce
[1:23:11] that devil
[1:23:14] Hallelujah
[1:23:16] I command you
[1:23:19] in the name of Jesus Christ renounce
[1:23:23] the devil
[1:23:25] wow I want you to notice now the
[1:23:27] commanding
[1:23:29] is not going to the devil in this
[1:23:31] situation
[1:23:33] but the prophet is commanding this
[1:23:35] Soldier Boy
[1:23:37] to renounce the devil
[1:23:39] so here he's commanding him Oh Glory I
[1:23:44] wonder sometimes if some of you all
[1:23:45] ain't waiting on brother Daryl to do it
[1:23:47] for you or waiting on me to do it for it
[1:23:49] or somebody else to do it for him and
[1:23:51] you need to rise in faith and say Satan
[1:23:53] in the name of Jesus I command you leave
[1:23:56] my body
[1:23:58] leave me you tumor leave me you gross
[1:24:01] leave me you nervousness my house is a
[1:24:05] house of God
[1:24:06] I have no room for you and my body leave
[1:24:11] my body in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:15] [Applause]
[1:24:19] I command you in the name of Jesus
[1:24:22] Christ to renounce the devil
[1:24:26] and accept Jesus Christ
[1:24:29] as your healer
[1:24:31] healer
[1:24:33] healer
[1:24:35] get him with a homosexual saying and you
[1:24:38] need healing
[1:24:41] but where
[1:24:43] was there something in his body that was
[1:24:45] causing it his spirit
[1:24:50] a woman and man are not just different
[1:24:52] in their body and their Anatomy
[1:24:54] they're different in their spirit
[1:24:57] don't you understand people that walk
[1:24:59] that wall they're crossed up in their
[1:25:02] spirit
[1:25:03] that's why you and I try to rehab them
[1:25:05] and try to talk them out of it we'll
[1:25:06] never do it they need Deliverance inside
[1:25:09] themselves
[1:25:11] it's a devil anointing and Crossing up
[1:25:15] their Spirit what in the world would
[1:25:17] make a big fat ugly man one who drove
[1:25:20] great his hair grow out like a woman and
[1:25:23] hair on his leg like a gorilla and want
[1:25:25] to be a girl
[1:25:30] he's messed up
[1:25:32] in his spirit
[1:25:34] remember God didn't just take God could
[1:25:37] take a male rib
[1:25:41] and make female anatomy
[1:25:43] God took a male rib from Adam and made a
[1:25:48] woman's body out of it but God did not
[1:25:51] take Adam's spirit and put Adam's Spirit
[1:25:54] but he divided the spirits that he
[1:25:57] placed in Adam in Adam all glory in Adam
[1:26:02] was that masculine thing but in Adam was
[1:26:05] also Eve's identity
[1:26:08] and God separated that part from her he
[1:26:12] did not give her Adam's male spirit and
[1:26:15] Eve said well glory to God I'm in charge
[1:26:17] of the Garden of Eden now Hallelujah I'm
[1:26:19] going to take care of everything
[1:26:27] you know imagine when he opened up his
[1:26:29] eyes
[1:26:30] When papa laid him down there on that
[1:26:33] ground and put him to sleep
[1:26:36] maybe just passed his hand over his eyes
[1:26:39] and the Divine anesthesia he just
[1:26:41] started
[1:26:51] and papa reaches in
[1:26:54] all right
[1:26:56] and pose a real bow from Henry's heart
[1:27:00] and he lays the rib over on the table
[1:27:04] and then Papa goes in
[1:27:06] to Adam's spirit
[1:27:08] and divides
[1:27:10] this tenet
[1:27:12] shy
[1:27:13] female traits
[1:27:16] that God had made in him
[1:27:19] and God put this inside the spirit
[1:27:22] the spirit inside this body
[1:27:25] and then she comes up and met God and
[1:27:27] I've told her go stand by him when he
[1:27:29] comes to him
[1:27:31] she's standing there by him and takes
[1:27:34] his hand starts taking her little tiny
[1:27:36] fingers her little dainty fingers are
[1:27:38] rubbing over his hands
[1:27:40] sweetheart

[1:28:45] your head I'm supposed to be on it
[1:28:54] I guess we can dismiss now I'm sorry
[1:29:01] but you can imagine the first time when
[1:29:02] he looked at her blonde hair and her
[1:29:04] blue eyes and her standing there in the
[1:29:06] form that God made to the prophet said
[1:29:08] the most beautiful woman that ever lived
[1:29:09] ever lived
[1:29:11] and yet so dainty
[1:29:13] and so touched him
[1:29:16] and was able to minister time
[1:29:19] and it was something he said
[1:29:22] where did she come from
[1:29:24] from you
[1:29:27] from you
[1:29:29] but this Soldier Boy
[1:29:31] just got messed up somehow
[1:29:36] so instead of being attracted to women
[1:29:43] well the prophet never looked at him and
[1:29:44] said you ain't got no hope boy you're
[1:29:46] damned to hell
[1:29:48] you get out of my prayer line you ain't
[1:29:50] got no right setting in there

[1:30:41] not in the body
[1:30:43] spirit
[1:30:48] we just message people so specialize in
[1:30:51] ministering to the soul
[1:30:53] others of our ranks specialize so much
[1:30:56] their entire Ministries ministering to
[1:30:58] the body
[1:31:00] but ain't we got some preachers
[1:31:02] that can minister to the human spirit
[1:31:06] to help pull our Spirits into harmony
[1:31:09] with God's word
[1:31:14] gonna go on
[1:31:17] what's this what what's your trouble
[1:31:19] this is in Dallas in 64. you've had an
[1:31:22] accident
[1:31:23] and then that accident you were gassed
[1:31:27] was carbon monoxide gas
[1:31:30] now is that true it poisons you it
[1:31:33] poisons you in your liver
[1:31:35] and you've had trouble with that and
[1:31:37] you've had trouble with your stomach and
[1:31:39] the brother says that's right
[1:31:43] okay so some of these Hypocrites are
[1:31:45] tail bound that's standing up refuting
[1:31:47] all this here is a man that had the
[1:31:48] opportunity to say you're a liar and
[1:31:50] that's a false prophet he said that's
[1:31:52] right so you're going to go back in time
[1:31:54] and refute this man
[1:31:58] you say why do you do that because I'm
[1:32:00] called to stand the defense of this word
[1:32:03] hey look friend God didn't call me
[1:32:05] there'd be no Pennywise preacher dot God
[1:32:07] didn't call me and give me a yellow
[1:32:09] streak up my back I've stood for this
[1:32:11] word for decades of my life I'll stand
[1:32:13] for it until the day I die I will stand
[1:32:16] for it and say it as a message sent from
[1:32:18] God it is a message that's called us out
[1:32:21] and we will not give it up
[1:32:27] oh my
[1:32:28] you've had trouble with your heart
[1:32:30] that's right
[1:32:32] this is the brother answering him
[1:32:34] it's made you so nervous
[1:32:37] till you've built yourself
[1:32:40] in a complex
[1:32:42] you're poor and you must go back to work
[1:32:45] but you're afraid
[1:32:47] to go to work now look what Satan will
[1:32:49] do
[1:32:50] Satan will cause something to happen to
[1:32:53] you
[1:32:54] and then you will build a complex out of
[1:32:56] it and then Satan will try to cut you
[1:32:58] off from the very resource that you need
[1:33:01] to live
[1:33:03] I hear this man was having a job dealing
[1:33:06] with this type of stuff we don't know
[1:33:07] exactly what it was but he had got
[1:33:09] poisoned by carbon monoxide poisoning
[1:33:12] and it had built this thing anyway it
[1:33:14] caused liver damage and caused other
[1:33:15] things and this caused the complex to
[1:33:18] other man don't want to go back to work
[1:33:19] because he's afraid to go back now
[1:33:21] because it may happen again you know
[1:33:23] what Satan don't just do that to work he
[1:33:25] loves to do that to church
[1:33:27] so people get their feelings hurt going
[1:33:30] to church and they get their feelings
[1:33:31] hurt going here though well I don't
[1:33:33] believe in Preachers no more I don't
[1:33:35] believe in going to church no more I got
[1:33:37] hurt I ain't going back
[1:33:40] there's too many Hypocrites at church
[1:33:50] I guess I just have maybe a slight
[1:33:53] problem with that
[1:33:55] so those of you that are going to
[1:33:57] Longhorn after service today for church
[1:33:59] for lunch
[1:34:01] others of you are going here and there
[1:34:03] and there now of course you will do this
[1:34:05] the same way that you do church right
[1:34:07] that you will go in and say I will not
[1:34:09] eat in this place
[1:34:11] if there's any hypocrite yet
[1:34:16] all gays all homosexuals all liars all
[1:34:21] out
[1:34:22] while I hate
[1:34:27] oh I see
[1:34:29] it's written on your face you don't have
[1:34:31] to say one word
[1:34:32] so you have one standard for church and
[1:34:34] another standard for your favorite
[1:34:35] restaurant
[1:34:37] now if you go to Walmart after after you
[1:34:39] eat your lunch then and I suppose you go
[1:34:41] up to the service desk and you take the
[1:34:43] microphone a Ted shot a 10 shot all
[1:34:46] liars all whoremongers all thieves all
[1:34:49] women with verses on all this and that
[1:34:52] other leave until me and my family are
[1:34:54] done shopping and then you can come back
[1:34:56] or I will not shop at Walmart you'll be
[1:34:59] waving on your way out
[1:35:02] because they will throw you out
[1:35:09] so what does Satan want to do
[1:35:12] have any y'all ever noticed
[1:35:14] you can be feeling wonderful on Monday
[1:35:17] morning to go to work
[1:35:20] another work day oh man alive it's
[1:35:23] Monday it's Monday it's Monday here I go
[1:35:26] I'm telling you what
[1:35:27] and then Wednesday comes close to the
[1:35:29] midweek service
[1:35:31] Tuesday evening oh
[1:35:35] my tummy hurts
[1:35:39] and then Wednesday morning you get up go
[1:35:40] work how are you oh
[1:35:43] I'm feeling so good
[1:35:46] Wednesday evening gonna be able to go to
[1:35:48] church I don't think so
[1:35:53] and people that don't believe in
[1:35:55] miracles they ought to watch people on
[1:35:57] Thursday morning
[1:35:59] because I'm thirsty morning they get up
[1:36:01] and go to work how are you today I'm a
[1:36:03] chipper is a squirrel and a hickory nut
[1:36:05] pal I'm telling you what I feel so great
[1:36:07] I don't know what nowhere will happen
[1:36:09] it's a miracle it's a miracle
[1:36:15] uh-huh
[1:36:17] do you honestly think you're going to be
[1:36:19] rewarded at that day for how faithful
[1:36:22] you were to your job
[1:36:27] to how many days I've worked so many
[1:36:29] days straight and haven't missed a day
[1:36:30] do you want a star you want a trophy
[1:36:32] what are you looking for
[1:36:35] isn't it amazing some of our priorities
[1:36:37] when it comes to church we have all
[1:36:39] church will always be here and I'm going
[1:36:40] to tell you I won't always be here no it
[1:36:42] won't
[1:36:43] well you can go to church anytime no you
[1:36:45] can't one day the bride will be gone our
[1:36:48] building may be left but the bride will
[1:36:50] be gone
[1:36:51] and people get into such a complex why
[1:36:55] because Satan knows if there's any place
[1:36:58] they can go to get helped
[1:37:02] it's Church
[1:37:04] where the word is preached and the
[1:37:06] spirit of God is there and deliverance
[1:37:09] is there if I was the devil I do my best
[1:37:12] to keep you out of church too
[1:37:21] foreign
[1:37:22] you're afraid to go back to work
[1:37:26] but it's all going to be all right now
[1:37:29] just remember if Jesus Christ will tell
[1:37:31] me who you are
[1:37:33] wow
[1:37:34] and that those things are true
[1:37:36] will you believe and accept it will you
[1:37:39] do it your name is Mr Wagner that's
[1:37:44] right
[1:37:45] that's right
[1:37:46] go on back to work
[1:37:49] Hallelujah well your name is misoffended
[1:37:53] and Mr hurt go on back to church
[1:37:58] going back to church
[1:38:01] Hallelujah you're gonna be healed go on
[1:38:05] back to church go on back to your family
[1:38:07] go on back to God go on back and let God
[1:38:12] do something for you
[1:38:22] Isaiah 53 3 says it this way
[1:38:26] he was despised
[1:38:28] and rejected of men
[1:38:33] a Man of Sorrows
[1:38:35] and acquainted with grief
[1:38:38] we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:38:42] and he was despised
[1:38:44] and we esteemed him not
[1:38:47] he become this so he could relate to you
[1:38:50] listen to the meanings of these words as
[1:38:52] I said life's not studying I was just
[1:38:54] overwhelmed by them
[1:38:56] the word despise means to be held in
[1:38:59] contempt
[1:39:01] disdained
[1:39:03] to be deemed despicable
[1:39:08] so that's the way people looked at the
[1:39:11] Lord Jesus he was Despicable
[1:39:18] and he did that for who
[1:39:20] for the Despicable
[1:39:25] to be despicable
[1:39:27] to be vile
[1:39:29] and to be worthless
[1:39:32] worthless
[1:39:35] worthless
[1:39:38] he was worth everything was he not
[1:39:41] but the way they looked at him he was
[1:39:44] worthless
[1:39:49] he's despised and rejected
[1:39:52] of men
[1:39:54] so he was not admitted
[1:39:57] into the communication or Fellowship
[1:40:02] with the lowest of humanity
[1:40:05] many of the scam as we would call them
[1:40:08] of the Earth
[1:40:10] was respected more than he was
[1:40:14] dear Lord Jesus
[1:40:17] why he was deemed unworthy
[1:40:21] born illegitimate born out of wedlock so
[1:40:24] they thought
[1:40:25] claimed God was his father a man like
[1:40:29] that
[1:40:30] has ever been slided before by people
[1:40:34] oh really why I thought there'd been
[1:40:36] more than that
[1:40:39] how many's ever feel like people just
[1:40:41] kind of ignored you
[1:40:43] you know they'd see so and so and so and
[1:40:45] so and boy they just make over them and
[1:40:47] they'd look at you and look right at you
[1:40:49] and you think yeah I am as big as an
[1:40:51] elephant they don't even see me
[1:40:53] and it it hurts you don't it it hurts
[1:40:55] you now if you're not careful that hurt
[1:40:57] will turn into resentment and that
[1:40:59] resentment will turn into anger and then
[1:41:01] you'll find yourself having something
[1:41:03] against that individual and sometimes
[1:41:04] it's true that people just don't see us
[1:41:07] they really don't see us and they don't
[1:41:09] mean it but yet it goes to building a
[1:41:10] complex in our minds and the prophet
[1:41:12] said you imagine that someone has
[1:41:14] something against you and said really
[1:41:15] they don't but you imagine they do and
[1:41:18] in your imagination you imagine that
[1:41:20] it's there and it goes to build up and
[1:41:21] he said the next thing you know you
[1:41:22] won't even speak to that person and it's
[1:41:25] only in your imagination
[1:41:27] but it was not in Jesus imagination
[1:41:32] he could hear them whispering
[1:41:42] they told me he said he was he was a
[1:41:44] hero he was this one of the Lord have
[1:41:47] mercy
[1:41:48] don't even have fellowship with him
[1:41:52] despised
[1:41:55] oh God
[1:41:57] a Man of Sorrows and the word sorrow is
[1:42:00] pain and it means both physical pain
[1:42:05] and mental pain
[1:42:07] so Jesus suffered the physical pain in
[1:42:10] his body but he also suffered mentally
[1:42:13] of being rejected
[1:42:16] not having very many friends when we
[1:42:18] come right down to it even his disciples
[1:42:19] went away from him
[1:42:21] is that right
[1:42:23] so no matter how low friends you and I
[1:42:25] have ever been none of us have ever been
[1:42:28] where he lived
[1:42:29] and why was it necessary for him to go
[1:42:31] this way because he knew you and I the
[1:42:34] making of a gentile bride that we would
[1:42:36] not only need healing in our bodies but
[1:42:38] we would need healing from rejection we
[1:42:41] would need healing from people that want
[1:42:43] nothing to do with us and some of you
[1:42:45] have been rejected by mothers fathers by
[1:42:48] loved ones and Jesus told us it would be
[1:42:50] that way so we would not be discouraged
[1:42:53] but all brother Donna you you can't
[1:42:55] relate to it you know maybe I cannot
[1:42:57] relate to your hurt but he can he can
[1:43:00] relate to no matter what you've been
[1:43:02] through he can relate to it and he can
[1:43:04] turn it and make you a woman Bride As it
[1:43:08] were to be one who is after God's Own
[1:43:12] Heart
[1:43:13] a woman that he could say many other
[1:43:16] women have done excellently but thou
[1:43:19] excellous
[1:43:21] above them all
[1:43:26] that was what was said about Bathsheba
[1:43:31] thou excellous
[1:43:33] above them all
[1:43:36] what a woman
[1:43:39] what a woman
[1:43:42] what a bride
[1:43:45] let me close
[1:43:47] we hear it as it were our faces
[1:43:50] from him
[1:43:52] he was despised
[1:43:55] we esteemed him not you know Isaiah when
[1:43:58] he prophesied this he said he was a Man
[1:43:59] of Sorrows
[1:44:01] and acquainted with grief in other words
[1:44:03] he was known
[1:44:05] by grief
[1:44:08] I find this amazing that how many of us
[1:44:10] miss this is one of the attributes of
[1:44:12] the Lord Jesus that many of us would
[1:44:14] identify him only by healing brother
[1:44:16] Daryl would identify him only by
[1:44:18] Miracles but Jesus partially was known
[1:44:22] by being hurt can you imagine he was
[1:44:24] persecuted from the day he was born
[1:44:26] until the day he died the Lord Jesus
[1:44:29] grief was such an acquaintance
[1:44:32] it was around him every day of his life
[1:44:36] everywhere he went there was grief and
[1:44:39] sorrow and pain and hurt
[1:44:42] he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted grief
[1:44:46] was one of his daily acquaintances
[1:44:49] oh I'm sure he had Joy I'm sure that
[1:44:51] there was such happiness inside of him
[1:44:53] but ended amazing the Bible doesn't say
[1:44:55] it that way
[1:44:57] the Bible does not identify him as being
[1:44:59] acquainted with shouting and the Lord
[1:45:02] Jesus was just this happy Christian that
[1:45:04] went around dancing all the time there's
[1:45:05] no scripture that even says he ever
[1:45:07] danced at all
[1:45:08] but his acquaintance
[1:45:10] was grief
[1:45:13] oh Lord God
[1:45:15] why
[1:45:16] for us
[1:45:19] his constant companion
[1:45:22] his constant conversant
[1:45:25] that was there talking to him
[1:45:28] grief
[1:45:30] he was oppressed
[1:45:34] I found this word amazing to press
[1:45:37] to drive down
[1:45:40] to exert
[1:45:41] demanding pressure
[1:45:44] oh man
[1:45:47] a task Massacre or a ruler a tyrant
[1:45:52] to be hard-pressed
[1:45:54] he was oppressed
[1:45:58] and he was afflicted
[1:46:01] to be bowed down to put down
[1:46:04] to be depressed
[1:46:09] can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[1:46:13] being depressed
[1:46:15] how many has ever been depressed
[1:46:17] just feel so sad and you go through
[1:46:20] things and you know how we are
[1:46:22] whenever the Lord will allow tests and
[1:46:24] trials to keep going and going and the
[1:46:27] pressure bills and bills and oh my we
[1:46:29] get to a place and then what do we do we
[1:46:32] go to saying things
[1:46:33] oh I can't take it no more I I can't
[1:46:36] handle it I just can't go out I can't do
[1:46:39] it
[1:46:40] God if you don't help me I'm going to
[1:46:42] quit a cat I can't take it no more I
[1:46:44] can't take it
[1:46:47] now let's be honest and truthful the
[1:46:49] most of the time for a seed of God that
[1:46:52] is not their heart speaking that's the
[1:46:54] weariness of their human Spirit that's
[1:46:57] their anxiety how many has ever said it
[1:46:59] oh lord I can't I just can't go no
[1:47:00] farther Lord I just can't do it and it
[1:47:02] ain't tomorrow you're wide open again
[1:47:04] you don't feel one bit better but you
[1:47:05] say devil out of my way I shouldn't have
[1:47:07] mumbled that stuff get out of my way dab
[1:47:09] on the devil here's what you say he said
[1:47:10] he don't mean that a bit more nothing I
[1:47:12] know him but you know what he'll turn
[1:47:14] right around and condemn you for what
[1:47:16] you said in your moment of weakness and
[1:47:18] the Lord Jesus allowed himself to feel
[1:47:21] depression
[1:47:23] passion
[1:47:26] some of you young people think you've
[1:47:28] got a right to be depressed because
[1:47:29] you're rejected by other young people in
[1:47:32] our church or other young people in the
[1:47:34] message
[1:47:36] you ain't felt nothing
[1:47:37] compared to what her Lord lets her
[1:47:42] but he went lower than you would ever be
[1:47:44] able to go so he could Encompass every
[1:47:47] human being on the earth that would
[1:47:48] trust him not only for salvation but
[1:47:51] Redemption from depression
[1:47:57] Oh Glory to God
[1:48:01] Hallelujah
[1:48:05] blessed Lord God
[1:48:14] in the name of Jesus
[1:48:19] every demon out of hell
[1:48:22] here today that tries to depress God's
[1:48:24] people
[1:48:26] Satan

[1:48:32] you are defeated
[1:48:35] you are a liar Satan
[1:48:42] Hallelujah
[1:48:47] every one of you right now in the name
[1:48:49] of Jesus
[1:48:51] that are feeling oppressed depressed
[1:48:55] stand to your feet

[1:58:24] Farthing she had and she'd done
[1:58:26] everything no doubt they told her to do
[1:58:28] but they could not help her oh but one
[1:58:31] day she heard about a man coming through
[1:58:33] town it was a man that was despised and
[1:58:37] rejected he didn't have a great
[1:58:39] reputation he didn't have a lot of Honor
[1:58:41] as far as the people was concerned but
[1:58:44] somehow she believed if I can touch but
[1:58:46] the hymn of His Garment I will be made

[1:58:52] not have a scripture but she had a

[2:14:19] Glory
[2:14:21] praise the Lord
[2:14:23] I read a quote to Carol is science I
[2:14:25] sent and said it brother Brown prayed
[2:14:28] for his church and prayed for himself
[2:14:29] and asked God to forgive them
[2:14:31] and he wanted God to forgive them not
[2:14:33] for drinking
[2:14:34] not from lying running around committing
[2:14:37] adultery but he asks that God would
[2:14:40] forgive them
[2:14:41] for their sinful fears I saw what a
[2:14:45] statement
[2:14:47] that God would forgive them for their
[2:14:49] fears
[2:14:51] I'd say there's probably more than just
[2:14:53] Branham Tabernacle that needs that today
[2:14:56] he's done so much for us why would we
[2:14:58] fear and yet we do and if we're not
[2:15:00] careful he'll overwhelm us
[2:15:02] I mean those it's the truth
[2:15:04] but having no unique God's help today to
[2:15:06] help you get away from those sinful
[2:15:09] fears
[2:15:11] God bless you
[2:15:12] such a privilege for us to be together
[2:15:14] today remember the Harry sing and it
[2:15:16] will will be dismissed as you feel that
[2:15:18] you want to go service here again
[2:15:19] Wednesday night
[2:15:21] we had to put a few more
[2:15:24] protection things up in front of the
[2:15:25] heat pumps at the church so we've got 14
