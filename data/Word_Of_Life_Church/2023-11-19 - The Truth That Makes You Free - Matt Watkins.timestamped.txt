[54:01] and I want you to turn to Joshua chapter
[54:03] 4 we're going to read from two places
[54:06] Joshua chapter 4 and also we're going to
[54:07] turn to the Book of John chapter 16 and
[54:10] I just want to minister to you and just
[54:12] maybe cap off I still got uh just I'm
[54:15] preaching here I'm going to preach to
[54:17] the whole church but I just got
[54:18] something still amen for the Youth and
[54:20] this is being a youth weekend amen that
[54:23] would be for I believe it would be a
[54:24] word for everybody body Joshua chapter 4
[54:27] and we're just going to be begin reading
[54:29] here at the first verse and then we'll
[54:30] turn to John 16 I'm going to preach to
[54:33] you today just something that I've
[54:35] ministered only in a couple places just
[54:37] what the Lord's burdened we me with
[54:39] recently and um and I'm just uh got uh
[54:43] just a lot on my heart so I don't
[54:45] exactly have an outline uh which way I'm
[54:48] going and exactly all laid out but you
[54:49] pull on the word and God will do the
[54:51] directing amen I want to title this
[54:53] today truth that sets you free and I
[54:58] want to subtitle this taking a stand for
[55:01] truth and it came to pass when all the
[55:03] people were clean pasted over Jordan
[55:06] that the Lord spake unto Joshua saying
[55:08] take you 12 men out of the people out of
[55:11] every tribe of man and command you them
[55:13] saying take you hence out of the midst
[55:15] of Jordan out of the place now this is
[55:17] going to be important not just
[55:20] anywhere not just any stone they're
[55:22] going to Cross Jordan but God actually
[55:25] is going to do something and he says I
[55:27] want you to take go go into the Jordan
[55:30] he says out of the place where the
[55:32] priest feet stood
[55:36] firm so not just generically not just
[55:39] any gospel not just any not just any
[55:41] thought or any Doctrine or any idea but
[55:44] where these original priests were going
[55:46] to place their feet they were going to
[55:47] put their feet firmly in the Jordan and
[55:51] God says I want you to go and take those
[55:53] stones out of the exact place place
[55:55] where his left foot was his right foot
[55:57] was what they stood upon water baptism
[55:59] in Jesus name not three Gods Not three
[56:02] persons but one person revealed serpent
[56:05] seed it wasn't an apple in the beginning
[56:07] it was adultery these were the truths
[56:10] that the prophet of God said would turn
[56:12] your heart back to the faith of the
[56:15] fathers and he says out of the place
[56:18] where the priest feet stood
[56:20] firm 12 Stones and you shall carry them
[56:23] over with you leave them in the lodging
[56:24] place where you shall let Lodge this
[56:25] night let's go on further Joshua calls
[56:27] 12 men whom he had prepared of the
[56:29] children of Israel out of every tribe a
[56:32] man all of the CH Levi G uh uh Gad Ruben
[56:35] all of them there was a man representing
[56:38] the entire body of God Joshua said pass
[56:42] over before the Ark of the Lord your God
[56:43] in the midst of Jordan take you up every
[56:45] man of you a stone upon his shoulder
[56:48] verse 6 now here's important that this
[56:51] may be a sign among you that when your
[56:55] children ask their fathers in time to
[56:59] come aha so what God was actually doing
[57:02] wasn't necessarily for this generation
[57:05] but he knew this generation would turn
[57:07] away fall away but there was coming a
[57:09] generation of children that would start
[57:12] say what do these Stones
[57:14] mean and notice he wasn't going to leave
[57:16] it upon a testimony of a dad or a
[57:18] grandpa or hunt story or fishing story
[57:21] he was going to leave them the word the
[57:23] Revelation the stone
[57:25] and it would turn their hearts back
[57:28] Hallelujah and he says that this may be
[57:30] a sign he says that then you shall
[57:32] answer them that the Waters of Jordan
[57:33] were cut off before the Ark of the
[57:35] Covenant of the Lord when it passed over
[57:37] Jordan the Waters of Jordan were cut off
[57:39] and these Stones shall be for a memorial
[57:42] unto the children of Israel forever why
[57:44] don't we just bow our our heads now and
[57:46] pray if you have something upon your
[57:48] heart just raise it before the Lord say
[57:50] God come and use brother Matt use the
[57:52] vessel you sent Lord to minister to my
[57:54] heart Jesus Jesus I raise my hand Lord
[57:56] God and ask for a special touch this
[57:58] morning I pray God you just move me out
[58:00] of the way Lord may I just be a weapon
[58:04] in your hands God to tear the lies of
[58:06] the devil down in your family I pray God
[58:09] make me a tool in your toolbox that I
[58:11] could be used for your glory god we'll
[58:13] give you all the praise and the honor
[58:14] and the glory in Jesus name amen amen
[58:18] you can be
[58:20] seated than you
[58:23] brother
[58:26] yes it's good
[58:28] thank it's an amazing age that we live
[58:31] in and I'm just going to go filling the
[58:33] holy spirit this morning but it's a
[58:35] chaotic world I think any of us could
[58:37] identify and say that we understand that
[58:40] very clearly I want you to understand
[58:42] that the world that you live in is being
[58:44] controlled by a spirit that the things
[58:47] that are happening today in the world
[58:49] that you live in it's no accident that
[58:51] the things that are taking place are
[58:53] taking place there's nothing random
[58:55] actually that happens in time because
[58:58] time is not randomly occurring actually
[59:01] history is really his story and so it's
[59:05] his events in fact everything that's
[59:07] happened from the beginning of time
[59:09] God's already pre-planned it he's
[59:11] already mapped it out he's already
[59:13] charted it out and so everything that's
[59:15] happening in our world today is actually
[59:18] being controlled not by the White House
[59:20] not by the Kremlin not even by the
[59:23] Vatican but actually what's controlling
[59:26] the entire world today is this
[59:28] book and it's not a book of History it's
[59:31] no it has history in it it's not a book
[59:34] of just ideas or doctrines or theories
[59:37] it's actually a living
[59:40] organism that is controlling the entire
[59:43] world and it doesn't just speak to the
[59:45] family of God it also speaks to the
[59:47] world it speaks to the Antichrist speaks
[59:50] to the Beast system it speaks to all of
[59:52] the nations of the world both both Jew
[59:55] and Gentile and the world events that
[59:58] you're seeing transpire today you
[1:00:00] wouldn't be able to make sense out of
[1:00:01] them other than that that there's a
[1:00:03] prophecy controlling the hearts of men
[1:00:06] how else would you make sense upon an
[1:00:07] entire world that is turning their back
[1:00:10] on a little bitty nation in in in in the
[1:00:12] Middle East and that the anti-Semitism
[1:00:15] friends if you just read the news here
[1:00:17] today the anti-Semitism that is so
[1:00:20] infiltrating the the the uh people that
[1:00:22] you would have never thought listen you
[1:00:24] may think well the world stands for
[1:00:26] Israel the United States stands for
[1:00:28] Israel let me just go ahead and preach
[1:00:29] to you and say uh they start out as a
[1:00:31] lamb but one day they'll speak as a
[1:00:33] dragon and this same nation that so
[1:00:35] reveres in Judean Christian values and
[1:00:38] and they you know they love the Lord And
[1:00:40] they support Israel the same Nation will
[1:00:42] turn its back on that little land of
[1:00:44] Israel because it's being controlled by
[1:00:47] prophecy and the Bible says in the book
[1:00:50] of Zechariah 12 and through chapter 14
[1:00:53] that actually all all the nations of the
[1:00:56] world will come against Israel I stood
[1:01:00] there and I couldn't believe it here
[1:01:01] just in August of this year we were just
[1:01:03] there for 15 days my first time ever
[1:01:05] getting to go there to to to Israel and
[1:01:08] I stood there on T megiddo the the the
[1:01:12] the the the mountain there t megiddo
[1:01:14] tell meaning Hill in in in Hebrew and
[1:01:17] and and it was incredible to look at
[1:01:19] this great vast uh Valley that I seen
[1:01:22] now here I'm standing at the uh where
[1:01:25] the valley of Armageddon is and I it was
[1:01:29] so surreal there for a moment just
[1:01:31] looking over this massive uh Outlook
[1:01:33] where you can just see all the mountains
[1:01:35] on the left side and you have Mount
[1:01:37] Carmel over here and all of the
[1:01:38] mountains that you read about right in
[1:01:40] the Bible and then in the middle of all
[1:01:42] of that is this Great Valley of
[1:01:45] Armageddon
[1:01:47] megiddo and I thought it's amazing I was
[1:01:49] telling me and brother Travis and I said
[1:01:51] it's incredible when you just look and
[1:01:53] and look out here that do you realize
[1:01:55] that the battle that that will take
[1:01:58] place when all of the armies of the
[1:02:00] Earth the Bible prophesies this all of
[1:02:03] the nations in fact it will be a a
[1:02:05] United Nation Army all of the Nations
[1:02:09] the Bible says will Encompass Jerusalem
[1:02:12] round about to destroy it and the and
[1:02:15] the scripture brother Brandon would say
[1:02:17] it this way all of those Nations will
[1:02:19] come in that Valley of Armageddon and
[1:02:21] they don't realize the reason that God
[1:02:23] has gathered them against Israel as he
[1:02:25] wanted them in one place to pour out his
[1:02:28] wrath upon
[1:02:30] them and I thought it's incredible to me
[1:02:32] because the world doesn't realize that
[1:02:34] the spirit that they're under is a
[1:02:36] rhythm it's a certain beat and it sounds
[1:02:40] good you know people's rights and you
[1:02:42] got to be fair to everybody and there's
[1:02:44] injustices taking place and and and and
[1:02:46] you got to be fair and it's got to be
[1:02:48] both sides they don't realize that that
[1:02:49] same political speech and that same idea
[1:02:52] that sounds so reasonable to the Ral
[1:02:54] mind is the very spirit that will lead
[1:02:57] them to the valley of Armageddon one
[1:03:00] day and brother Bram said that that
[1:03:03] battle that takes place in Zechariah 12
[1:03:06] where all the nations Encompass
[1:03:07] Jerusalem brother bham said that great
[1:03:10] battle will just be the final battle of
[1:03:13] the war that started in the Garden of
[1:03:19] Eden and it's the final battle that will
[1:03:22] take place listen friends the things
[1:03:24] that are taking place today or being
[1:03:25] controlled by prophecy I don't want to
[1:03:28] get into it today as we don't not really
[1:03:29] our message or have time to do that but
[1:03:32] do you realize that actually that the
[1:03:34] world brother Brandon would say would
[1:03:36] have to get into the spirit of
[1:03:39] destruction before God can pour out his
[1:03:42] wrath upon them that before God could
[1:03:44] ever destroy the world the people would
[1:03:47] first have to get in the
[1:03:52] spirit and act actually brother brandham
[1:03:55] would show how that the six seal was a
[1:03:58] tribulation seal but the prophet of God
[1:04:01] said that even that six seal Jesus spoke
[1:04:03] of it in fact he points all the way back
[1:04:05] to Pharaoh when he when there when the
[1:04:08] children of Israel were were enslaved in
[1:04:10] in in in Egypt and brother bam said he
[1:04:12] was under a sick seal he was under a
[1:04:15] pre-tribulation anointing so we
[1:04:18] understand by prophecy that when the
[1:04:20] seals were broke though we know that the
[1:04:22] six seal is a tribulation brother Matt
[1:04:24] does that mean that we're in the
[1:04:26] tribulation period no it's not in time
[1:04:28] where that hasn't actually taken place
[1:04:30] but what we understand is that the the
[1:04:32] breaking forth of that six seal there
[1:04:34] was actually an anointing that those
[1:04:37] Chargers that were loosed at the river
[1:04:39] Euphrates that would come
[1:04:41] ecclesiastically and religiously and
[1:04:43] politically in fact brother brandham
[1:04:45] said that six seal pre-tribulation
[1:04:47] anointing fell Upon A Man Named ikan
[1:04:50] Hitler Stalin musolini come on friends
[1:04:53] are you Believers today
[1:04:55] and he said that they were under a
[1:04:57] plague or a sick seal anointing that was
[1:05:01] released upon them to destroy the Jews
[1:05:05] and they don't realize man doesn't
[1:05:06] realize listen friends the Bible you're
[1:05:09] you're living in prophetic times I hope
[1:05:12] you understand the
[1:05:14] magnitude of the moment that you're
[1:05:16] living in in
[1:05:17] time that the world is going completely
[1:05:21] out of their minds they don't know what
[1:05:22] a man is they don't know a woman is you
[1:05:25] think that's an accident that's real
[1:05:27] friends that's Bible
[1:05:29] prophecy and they don't realize they're
[1:05:31] under a pre-tribulation anointing
[1:05:33] getting into the spirit of destruction
[1:05:35] to destroy God's family and they don't
[1:05:38] realize it's corrupting their schools
[1:05:40] it's corrupting our our politics I don't
[1:05:42] care if you're left I don't care if
[1:05:44] you're right I don't care if you're
[1:05:45] libertarian I don't care if you're in
[1:05:47] the White House listen friends it ain't
[1:05:48] going to take another Donald Trump or
[1:05:50] another George Washington brother vom
[1:05:52] says you can put them all on every
[1:05:54] street corner and the world would still
[1:05:56] go to hell because it's already been
[1:05:58] condemned and
[1:06:00] prophesied oh brother bandam said I
[1:06:02] prophesy to you in the name of the Lord
[1:06:04] the world will go completely
[1:06:07] insane and they don't realize that that
[1:06:10] sick seal has literally anointed their
[1:06:12] heart for destruction oh but I got a
[1:06:15] word for the bride of Christ if a sick
[1:06:17] seal could anoint the hearts of people
[1:06:20] for Destruction how much more would a
[1:06:22] seventh seal under a seven the messenger
[1:06:25] I'll put us under the spirit of a body
[1:06:28] change do you realize that's the spirit
[1:06:31] that you're feeling today it's an
[1:06:33] anointing to take us out of this world
[1:06:35] one
[1:06:37] [Applause]
[1:06:38] day and they're literally under the
[1:06:41] spell or the delusion of a bewitching
[1:06:45] spirit it's got a rhythm I'm just going
[1:06:47] to get to dear to my notes it's got a
[1:06:50] rhythm it's being influenced by Spirits
[1:06:53] uh the world is such a place where Paul
[1:06:55] would say who hath Bewitched you let me
[1:06:58] just say this friends the darker the
[1:06:59] world gets the more unpopular the truth
[1:07:02] will
[1:07:04] become now I'm not talking about a
[1:07:06] version of truth that's preached in mega
[1:07:08] churches and and denominal chal churches
[1:07:11] God loves you God does love you he wants
[1:07:13] the best for you he does want the best
[1:07:14] for you oh God doesn't care how you live
[1:07:16] God doesn't care listen all it is is
[1:07:18] about accepting Jesus and you realize
[1:07:20] what they've done is they they've just
[1:07:22] taken scissors and they cut out the
[1:07:24] parts that they don't like and they've
[1:07:26] emphasized the parts that they do
[1:07:28] like and then they'll use that to argue
[1:07:31] against you well you're what are you
[1:07:32] saying Calvary wasn't enough absolutely
[1:07:34] I believe Calvary was enough but Calvary
[1:07:36] was just the beginning you see that
[1:07:38] Calvary cross was just the beginning let
[1:07:40] me give you the words of the Bible
[1:07:41] behold he's not
[1:07:43] there he's
[1:07:45] risen he's not in the Tomb anymore he's
[1:07:48] in your heart that was just the
[1:07:51] beginning of the
[1:07:52] story
[1:07:54] thank you Lord but it would get to such
[1:07:57] a place where the truth will become more
[1:07:59] and more and more
[1:08:01] unpopular let me say it this way the
[1:08:03] message of the hour to really live the
[1:08:05] true message of the hour will become
[1:08:08] more unpopular the darker the world
[1:08:12] gets it's amazing to me the gospel that
[1:08:15] Paul preached got his head chopped off
[1:08:18] the gospel that Jesus preached got him
[1:08:20] crucified the gospel Peter preached got
[1:08:22] him hung upside down but somehow the
[1:08:25] gospel that's being preached today fills
[1:08:27] up with 20,000
[1:08:32] people it's amazing to me the same
[1:08:35] gospel that was rejected to where the
[1:08:37] Apostle Paul would say I I am not
[1:08:41] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] for it's the power listen friends there
[1:08:46] was a reason Paul would have to say I am
[1:08:49] not ashamed of this gospel and I believe
[1:08:51] it's going to get to the place to where
[1:08:53] the believer will have to say I'm not
[1:08:55] ashamed of the message of the hour I'm
[1:08:57] not ashamed that God sent a prophet I'm
[1:08:59] not ashamed to say it was the voice of
[1:09:01] God to me
[1:09:06] personally but Satan is an intimidating
[1:09:08] spirit and he backs us up into Corners
[1:09:11] we got into a place to where we can't
[1:09:13] preach the uh people people don't want
[1:09:14] the truth anymore they want their
[1:09:16] version of the truth all
[1:09:18] right in fact it would be that was that
[1:09:22] was just as religious as Abel
[1:09:25] was in fact contining for the faith
[1:09:27] brother bandham actually said Cain was
[1:09:29] more religious than Abel was in fact
[1:09:33] brother Brandon would say he did more
[1:09:35] good works than Abel did my
[1:09:40] goodness so it would be a spirit that
[1:09:43] would bewitch the church John 16 listen
[1:09:47] to this this is uh very familiar
[1:09:48] scripture I have yet many things to say
[1:09:51] unto you but you cannot bear them how be
[1:09:53] it when he the spirit of Truth has come
[1:09:55] he will guide you into all truth not
[1:09:58] some of the truth not part of the truth
[1:10:00] not one version of the truth but all of
[1:10:03] the truth right he shall not speak of
[1:10:06] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:10:09] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:10:11] things to come he won't glorify me he he
[1:10:14] shall glorify me for he shall not
[1:10:16] receive of mine and and shall show it to
[1:10:18] you uh so brother bandham said that this
[1:10:20] is why the seals had to be opened
[1:10:22] because Christ had had more that he
[1:10:24] wanted to say is that right and so we
[1:10:27] know that brother Brandon would make it
[1:10:28] very simple and he would say actually
[1:10:31] there's only two spirits that you can be
[1:10:34] influenced
[1:10:35] by and that's so simple either a spirit
[1:10:38] from above or a spirit from beneath man
[1:10:41] is only ever controlled by one or two
[1:10:44] things right and Jesus would say if you
[1:10:47] love the world or the things of the
[1:10:50] world now if you look at that word world
[1:10:52] it's actually the word CA Cosmos and
[1:10:55] it's the structure it's the opposite of
[1:10:57] the word chaos chaos meaning disorder
[1:11:01] Cosmos meaning structure or system or
[1:11:04] order this is what the world is being
[1:11:08] led by a structure a a a a system a a
[1:11:13] certain order that they're being marched
[1:11:15] by and it's they don't realize that
[1:11:17] their agenda is actually a satanic
[1:11:20] agenda though very religious remember
[1:11:24] brother Brandon said what did what did
[1:11:25] he want he wanted to be worshiped he
[1:11:27] wanted a church he wanted a pull pit and
[1:11:29] I'm here to say he's accomplished his
[1:11:31] his
[1:11:33] purpose and so so he's they don't know
[1:11:36] even what a man is brother brandom says
[1:11:39] Dear God I pray you'll manifest yourself
[1:11:40] tonight this is an events made clear I
[1:11:41] don't have this uh that you will
[1:11:43] manifest yourself tonight on Hebrews
[1:11:45] 13:8 that you're the same yesterday
[1:11:47] today and forever and the works that you
[1:11:49] did then you'll do today we brother Adam
[1:11:51] says notice you look at these boys they
[1:11:54] look so much like
[1:11:58] girls wearing clothes like
[1:12:02] them and see the girls trying to act so
[1:12:05] much like boys see the women and men in
[1:12:07] this perverted age see sex appeal has
[1:12:10] became an idol of worship the gospel has
[1:12:13] been pushed out to one side and
[1:12:15] nakedness of the lady aan Church oh God
[1:12:18] what an answer notice this is what this
[1:12:20] is the age where men doesn't know what a
[1:12:23] man
[1:12:25] is and you'll watch a man go to one
[1:12:28] extreme or the other he'll either be a
[1:12:30] chauvinist who doesn't really know his
[1:12:32] position and he's on a power trip of
[1:12:34] authority and he beats that woman down
[1:12:36] like a like a doormat listen God never
[1:12:38] made her to be a
[1:12:39] doormat I'm going to
[1:12:41] preach God never made her to be a
[1:12:43] doormat he didn't take from Eve from the
[1:12:45] bone of his foot prophet of God would
[1:12:47] say and make a doormat neither did he
[1:12:49] take from the bone of his head to make
[1:12:50] him a head over him but in her proper
[1:12:53] place in her proper position in her
[1:12:56] proper order in the man's proper order
[1:12:58] in the proper place according to the
[1:13:00] word of God it'll produce the it'll
[1:13:02] produce the Life of Christ it'll produce
[1:13:05] that's what's pleasing to Christ but you
[1:13:07] notice what happens is that man doesn't
[1:13:09] know what man is woman doesn't you think
[1:13:11] it's an accident the transgender and
[1:13:14] lgbtq uh agenda is happening right now
[1:13:17] friends it's a fulfillment of
[1:13:19] Prophecy to where men don't know what a
[1:13:21] man is doesn't know what he'll either be
[1:13:23] a or he'll be a little that never
[1:13:25] takes a stand for anything it's just a
[1:13:27] pushover all right
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:33] Lord do you know that we had a prophet
[1:13:36] in this generation and it was a prophecy
[1:13:38] he was a Watchman on the wall do you
[1:13:41] know what the Bible read the Bible uh h
[1:13:44] h definition of a Watchman was he was to
[1:13:46] sit on the wall and he was to warn the
[1:13:49] city of oncoming judgment or of an
[1:13:52] oncoming enemy and I'm so glad today we
[1:13:55] had a prophet who was a faithful
[1:13:57] Watchman who identified the enemy long
[1:14:01] before he ever got
[1:14:02] there but do you know what the gift of
[1:14:05] the true Watchman was anybody could
[1:14:07] identify the enemy when he had his
[1:14:09] ladders uh putting his putting his you
[1:14:10] know battering ram up oh hey guys hey
[1:14:14] trouble trouble uh they got their
[1:14:16] battering rams everybody prepared for
[1:14:18] war you see any preacher could do that
[1:14:22] anybody can ident identify
[1:14:24] fruit but it takes a prophetic eyesight
[1:14:27] to identify
[1:14:32] seeds you say well that's not in the
[1:14:34] message we don't have listen friends you
[1:14:35] have everything in Fruit form today the
[1:14:38] prophet of God identifed identified in
[1:14:41] seed form in the message of the hour why
[1:14:43] do you think he would preach against I
[1:14:45] Love Lucy and you'd say well what is so
[1:14:47] har what's so wrong with I Love Lucy I
[1:14:50] mean it just seems so harmless today
[1:14:52] seems like oh look at look at what but
[1:14:54] do you realize that the seed of I Love
[1:14:56] Lucy is the fruit of what Hollywood puts
[1:14:59] out today and a faithful Watchman said
[1:15:02] kick that thing out of your house don't
[1:15:04] consume it don't watch it don't partake
[1:15:06] of it because the seed was a seed of
[1:15:09] rebellion and a seed of head anti-
[1:15:12] headship that is now manifesting in
[1:15:14] Hollywood
[1:15:16] today but you see a prophet has
[1:15:18] prophetic insight and he wasn't going to
[1:15:21] identify the Watchman wasn't going to
[1:15:23] wait for the enemy to be on the wall the
[1:15:25] Watchman was going to be able to see a
[1:15:27] long ways
[1:15:30] off and say Hey you know that thing that
[1:15:33] looks so minuscule and so small out
[1:15:36] there doesn't seem like
[1:15:38] much it's out there now but when it gets
[1:15:41] here it'll bring
[1:15:47] destruction and so brother Brandon would
[1:15:49] identify the seeds the seeds of of of of
[1:15:52] Nica to ISM he would he would we're not
[1:15:54] going to go into that today but listen
[1:15:56] what the Bible says it says in Romans
[1:15:58] chapter 8 the carnal mind for to be Carn
[1:16:01] minded 8 verse 5 is death but to be
[1:16:05] spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:16:10] because the carnal mind you say brother
[1:16:12] Matt what is my carnal mind this
[1:16:16] one oh I've been born again this
[1:16:20] one but I'm filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:23] this
[1:16:25] one you see your intellectuals will
[1:16:29] never agree with the word of
[1:16:32] God in fact it won't make much sense to
[1:16:35] your intellectual brain and if you lead
[1:16:37] towards your intellect come on
[1:16:39] friends to be carnally minded is death
[1:16:43] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:16:45] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:16:47] against God for it is not subject to the
[1:16:49] law of God nor indeed can be
[1:16:54] so then those who are in the flesh
[1:16:56] cannot please God brother Bon would say
[1:16:58] it this way the wisdom of man can ACC to
[1:17:00] accumulate and to prove and to show
[1:17:03] these things why man should do this is
[1:17:05] contrary
[1:17:07] enmity the carnal mind enmity with the
[1:17:11] word of God you'll never rationalize it
[1:17:14] out you'll never make it I'm going to
[1:17:15] give you the words of Spurgeon I love
[1:17:17] this Paul didn't say that the carnal
[1:17:19] mind was at enmity with God he put it
[1:17:22] even stronger than that the carnal mind
[1:17:25] is
[1:17:28] enmity it is not black but Blackness it
[1:17:32] is not at enmity but actually enmity
[1:17:35] itself it is not corrupt but corruption
[1:17:39] it is not rebellious it is rebellion it
[1:17:41] is not Wicked it is wickedness itself
[1:17:44] the heart though it be deceitful is
[1:17:46] positively deceit it is evil in the
[1:17:49] concrete sin in the essence it is the
[1:17:52] distillation the Quint ascensions of all
[1:17:54] things that are vile it is not envious
[1:17:56] against God it is Envy it is not at
[1:18:00] enmity it is actual
[1:18:06] enmity now you know why the Apostle Paul
[1:18:09] would say let this mind that was in
[1:18:11] Christ Jesus be in
[1:18:14] you so we notice what is truth today
[1:18:17] truth is the absolute standard by which
[1:18:20] reality is measured truth truth is God's
[1:18:23] view on any subject situation question
[1:18:27] or idea truth is not what a scholar says
[1:18:31] truth is not even what a theologian says
[1:18:33] I'll go further truth is not what a
[1:18:34] preacher
[1:18:38] says just because a preacher says it
[1:18:40] doesn't make it true just because a
[1:18:42] great man says it doesn't make it true
[1:18:44] let me go further can I bring it a
[1:18:45] little bit further down the message is
[1:18:47] not what I say it is the message is not
[1:18:50] what some man in Africa says or some man
[1:18:52] in in the Middle East it doesn't the
[1:18:54] message of the hour is not what I make
[1:18:56] it it's not what you make it let me say
[1:18:58] it this way the message is what it
[1:19:01] is let me make it even clear the truth
[1:19:04] is not what I say it's not what you say
[1:19:06] the truth speaks for
[1:19:11] itself
[1:19:13] Hallelujah and so notice what happens
[1:19:16] this is exactly what the Bible says the
[1:19:18] truth is the truth is not what I make it
[1:19:20] it's not what the preacher makes it it's
[1:19:22] not what the example that you've seen
[1:19:23] the message is what it is it's God's
[1:19:26] Vindicated word and it came not from a
[1:19:28] man not from a Kentucky hillbilly it
[1:19:30] came from the Throne of God do you
[1:19:33] realize the message of the hour is not
[1:19:35] William branham's message I know that's
[1:19:37] unpopular for some people but it wasn't
[1:19:39] even his message a prophet of God said I
[1:19:42] was just standing there when he
[1:19:46] appeared so do you realize when you walk
[1:19:49] away from the message you're not walking
[1:19:52] away away from brother
[1:19:54] brandom I said when you walk away from
[1:19:57] this truth you're not walking away from
[1:19:59] a pro from a a man from Kentucky you're
[1:20:02] walking away from
[1:20:04] God because it wasn't brother bram's
[1:20:07] message it was listen when you rejected
[1:20:09] Isaiah you weren't rejecting
[1:20:13] Isaiah Isaiah was just the Mailman who
[1:20:15] the message came through when you
[1:20:18] rejected Jeremiah and called Jeremiah
[1:20:20] crazy called him a false prophet called
[1:20:22] him a li call him dishonest call him
[1:20:24] whatever you want to call him you're not
[1:20:26] rejecting Jeremiah you are rejecting the
[1:20:29] throne room of God cuz the message came
[1:20:32] from the throne into the lips of a
[1:20:34] prophet unto the
[1:20:36] people and so when you were rejecting
[1:20:39] Jeremiah you didn't receive Jeremiah's
[1:20:41] curse either you weren't going to
[1:20:43] receive the wrath of Jeremiah hello
[1:20:45] somebody you weren't going to receive
[1:20:47] the anger or the wrath of Isaiah when
[1:20:49] you walked away from Isaiah you were
[1:20:51] going to receive the wrath of
[1:20:53] God and let me go further when you
[1:20:56] accepted Jeremiah's message you weren't
[1:20:58] accepting Jeremiah's message you were
[1:21:00] accepting the message from the throne
[1:21:02] and when you accept the message of the
[1:21:03] hour you're not accepting the message of
[1:21:06] a Kentucky man you're accepting a voice
[1:21:09] from heaven and let me go further you
[1:21:11] don't receive the blessing from from a
[1:21:13] man you receive a blessing from
[1:21:18] God the prophet wasn't the author of the
[1:21:21] message he was just the mailman or the
[1:21:23] messenger do you realize even the Book
[1:21:25] of Revelation wasn't John's
[1:21:27] book it was the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:31] Christ which God gave unto
[1:21:35] him and he bore record of it and the
[1:21:38] testimony of Jesus Christ of all things
[1:21:40] that he saw so brother Brandon was not
[1:21:43] who I say he was he's not who any man
[1:21:45] says he was he was who the truth said
[1:21:47] that he was and what is the truth it's
[1:21:49] the word it's the thought of God
[1:21:51] expressed
[1:21:54] and it's not
[1:21:56] communicated by
[1:21:58] emotion and it's not in communicated by
[1:22:05] intellect let me say this the re the
[1:22:08] truth of the hour is not communicated by
[1:22:10] either emotion or or your
[1:22:14] intellectuals all right you could try to
[1:22:17] understand it I could try to draw it out
[1:22:19] on a whiteboard and try on chalkboard I
[1:22:21] could try to paint it out clearly before
[1:22:23] you and you could try with your best to
[1:22:25] grasp it and even understand the
[1:22:27] knowledge of it but brother brandom says
[1:22:29] you can have the knowledge and not have
[1:22:30] the
[1:22:33] Revelation it's not communicated by a
[1:22:35] human dialect it's a language that a
[1:22:38] human can't speak I preach it we preach
[1:22:40] it we teach it absolutely we do but it
[1:22:44] takes God to come and reveal it and seal
[1:22:46] it inside of your
[1:22:49] heart but we live in a bewitching world
[1:22:52] a world that says you know uh uh you've
[1:22:54] got to have proof you've got to have a a
[1:22:57] Vindication I'm just going to go ahead
[1:22:58] and preach today and I'll let the chips
[1:23:00] fall where they will brother Donnie can
[1:23:01] clean it up after I get done let me say
[1:23:03] something to the young people young
[1:23:05] people you don't need to research this
[1:23:11] message I said you don't need to
[1:23:13] research this
[1:23:14] message the message has already been
[1:23:19] Vindicated the message isn't to be
[1:23:21] researched not to be did it did it make
[1:23:23] sense does it make right listen friends
[1:23:25] it's already been Vindicated and God put
[1:23:27] a seal of approval on it God Vindicated
[1:23:30] it and backed it with his presence night
[1:23:32] after night I don't need to have an
[1:23:34] answer to the critic I've already got my
[1:23:36] answer my answer is right here living in
[1:23:38] my heart it's already all the proof that
[1:23:41] I need is what the message has changed
[1:23:43] and done in my
[1:23:49] heart let me go further you don't need
[1:23:51] to answer the question questions of
[1:23:56] unbelievers it's a perversion of First
[1:23:58] Peter 3 give an answer be ready at the
[1:24:00] any moment to get an A give an answer to
[1:24:02] every man about the hope that lays
[1:24:04] within you listen friends that's a
[1:24:05] perversion to say I've got to answer
[1:24:07] every single question in fact if you go
[1:24:09] just a little a few more verses Paul
[1:24:11] says foolish questions and unlearned
[1:24:13] don't even answer don't don't even give
[1:24:15] them your attention you ought not give
[1:24:17] it your
[1:24:20] attention I don't need to answer let me
[1:24:22] give you the words of my good buddy
[1:24:23] brother Wayne Lawson I don't need to
[1:24:25] answer those questions cuz they're not
[1:24:27] my
[1:24:29] questions they're the questions of
[1:24:31] unbelievers and unbelievers will
[1:24:33] unbelieve you know what an unbeliever
[1:24:35] will do he'll unbelieve you know what a
[1:24:36] make believer will do he'll make believe
[1:24:37] but you know what a Believer will do a
[1:24:39] Believer will believe the word of God
[1:24:41] because that's who he is because that's
[1:24:43] what he is he's a
[1:24:48] Believer what you'll find in the Bible
[1:24:51] is you will never find Peter and Paul
[1:24:54] and these men arguing and
[1:24:56] debating you won't find that in the
[1:24:59] Bible you won't find Paul trying to get
[1:25:01] out or Peter try to get out a chalkboard
[1:25:03] and draw it all out and act like a
[1:25:05] scholar and try to give a scholarly
[1:25:07] answer and try to give an answer that
[1:25:09] makes perfect sense to the human mind
[1:25:12] none of these examples you'll find in
[1:25:13] the Bible will show you them trying to
[1:25:15] be a intellectual men arguing with
[1:25:17] intellectual
[1:25:18] arguments because the human mind is
[1:25:21] enmity with God do you realize this is
[1:25:24] the approach of the modern
[1:25:27] Church a scientific approach towards the
[1:25:30] word of God and if you don't have that
[1:25:33] if you don't have a scientific approach
[1:25:35] on one ditch you're going to have an
[1:25:37] emotional approach on another itch it's
[1:25:39] what I understand or it's what I
[1:25:43] feel all
[1:25:46] right but you know this is the way the
[1:25:48] world approaches everything is they got
[1:25:50] to have a rational reason to believe
[1:25:52] something it's got to make sense you see
[1:25:56] what you find is is that the Bible
[1:25:58] prophesied that this age men would
[1:26:00] become lovers of their own
[1:26:05] self now that doesn't mean they get in
[1:26:07] the mirror and go oh man look at
[1:26:10] me at least I hope they
[1:26:13] don't oh man look at I just love myself
[1:26:17] listen friends do you know that's not
[1:26:18] the prophecy that would come upon this
[1:26:20] world what comes upon this world is the
[1:26:23] love of
[1:26:27] self to where I can understand it I can
[1:26:30] rationalize it I can reason it out
[1:26:33] scientifically I can prove it and that's
[1:26:36] all brother bam said the denominational
[1:26:38] church was just Anointed with the spirit
[1:26:39] of
[1:26:41] argument I'm just going to go ahead and
[1:26:43] say it you're not anointed to
[1:26:47] argue you get yourself in trouble trying
[1:26:50] to do that that's not your an anointing
[1:26:53] your anointing is not a man anointing
[1:26:54] your anointing is an eagle to where you
[1:26:57] rise All Above It what is your power
[1:26:59] it's a power of Revelation that God
[1:27:02] reveals it and speaks it and you say
[1:27:04] Lord I might not be able to understand
[1:27:06] it I might not even feel it but I
[1:27:08] believe it with all that's within me God
[1:27:11] I believe it with my body with my soul
[1:27:14] and with my
[1:27:19] spirit it was the power of Revelation
[1:27:23] wow I heard a man the other day on on a
[1:27:26] YouTube video good old
[1:27:28] YouTube and it was a c it was a scholar
[1:27:31] and that scholar was so amazed it was an
[1:27:33] awesome video I mean I love all of it it
[1:27:35] was an awesome video but the scholars
[1:27:37] two Christian men both of them Christian
[1:27:38] Scholars Dallas Theological Seminary
[1:27:41] trained beautiful you know minds of
[1:27:43] these men and that they they were so
[1:27:45] encouraged because they had went to an
[1:27:47] archaeological dig uh you know recently
[1:27:49] of Sodom and Gomorrah and actually they
[1:27:51] have found on the Dead Sea what they
[1:27:54] believed to be the the mo the the the
[1:27:56] ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah two
[1:27:59] twin cities by the Dead Sea and these
[1:28:02] men these these they go into this
[1:28:03] archaeological dig and they they ask
[1:28:05] them these questions of what did they
[1:28:07] find at the destruction layer what did
[1:28:09] they find at the what destroyed Sodom
[1:28:11] and gomorra and the man AR archaeologist
[1:28:14] didn't want to answer the question he
[1:28:15] sort of walked away shut away the live
[1:28:16] stream was on so they got with him
[1:28:18] afterward said you got to tell us did
[1:28:19] you find arrows at the destruction layer
[1:28:22] if you find arrows that means that men
[1:28:24] destroy the city some Army and he said
[1:28:26] no what we learned is that they said we
[1:28:29] didn't find any arrows they said well
[1:28:30] how was Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:28:32] destroyed and they said well we call it
[1:28:36] a heat
[1:28:43] event he said what in the world's a heat
[1:28:45] event and he said well what we found was
[1:28:48] is we found pottery and he says at first
[1:28:51] we we notied the pot we thought we had
[1:28:53] found the you know the true dig of the
[1:28:55] ancient city and he said but we flipped
[1:28:57] it over and we realized that there was
[1:28:59] glazing on the back of the pottery and
[1:29:01] he says we realized real quick you know
[1:29:03] we the the the digs been tainted because
[1:29:05] there was no glazing didn't come till
[1:29:07] the Ottoman Empire about 700 AD and so
[1:29:10] this couldn't be Sodom and he said but
[1:29:11] there was something different about the
[1:29:13] glazing on the pottery and he said so we
[1:29:15] took that Pottery we would sent it to a
[1:29:16] lab in New York City didn't tell them
[1:29:18] what it was we just said Analyze This
[1:29:20] glazing and he said the scientist came
[1:29:22] back and said that's not glazing on the
[1:29:24] back of that Pottery they said well what
[1:29:26] is that they said well that's actually
[1:29:27] triopo Tite well what in the world is
[1:29:32] triop
[1:29:33] Tite and they said actually that what
[1:29:35] you see triop Tite is when something
[1:29:38] reaches nuclear bomb level
[1:29:43] heat so you know what they've concluded
[1:29:46] Sodom and Gomorrah was
[1:29:49] nuked I could have told him that before
[1:29:52] they ever found the proof it was nuke
[1:29:54] from above from a nuclear bomb from the
[1:29:56] almighty God who rained fire and
[1:29:59] brimstone
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:03] down you say brother Matt did that put
[1:30:05] your faith now you believe the Bible
[1:30:07] uh-uh that didn't do anything for listen
[1:30:09] I love it I believe I I love it just as
[1:30:12] much as they do but it was incredible
[1:30:13] because the man went on to say he said
[1:30:15] you know I was so encouraged he said
[1:30:17] because I've always looked at Sodom and
[1:30:19] Gomorrah as a mythical part of the
[1:30:23] Bible I couldn't believe it I reer
[1:30:25] rounded it 5 Second back I got to hear
[1:30:27] that
[1:30:28] again I always believe he said yeah I
[1:30:30] did too I always looked at that you know
[1:30:32] Noah's Arc that was just mythical parts
[1:30:34] of the Bible friend I'm just going to
[1:30:36] goe and tell you if I believe there were
[1:30:37] mythical Parts in that Bible I'd throw
[1:30:39] it
[1:30:42] out if I believe that God just made
[1:30:45] something up it was a mythical part I'd
[1:30:47] just throw it out they did the same
[1:30:48] thing with pilot Stone do you know that
[1:30:50] I was reading 2/3 of of Christian
[1:30:52] Scholars
[1:30:53] 2third of Christian Scholars never
[1:30:57] believe that pontis pilot ever
[1:31:00] existed they beli there was some
[1:31:02] procurator that that was there at that
[1:31:03] time but it wasn't pontis pilot was just
[1:31:05] a name that the writer sort of just made
[1:31:09] up come on you know what happened though
[1:31:12] I was just in Israel went to the Israeli
[1:31:13] Museum and I found I seen the pilot
[1:31:16] Stone a capital Stone I think it was in
[1:31:19] the 50s that these archaeologists came
[1:31:21] and dug up and they found this this
[1:31:23] stone with the name pontis pilate and
[1:31:27] you know what those two-thirds of
[1:31:28] Christian Scholars did they said oh I
[1:31:30] guess he did exist I guess I do believe
[1:31:33] it you know what I'm so glad that I
[1:31:35] didn't need a stone with the name of
[1:31:37] pontis pilot some kind of intellectual
[1:31:40] proof but I already believed it inside
[1:31:43] of my heart blessed are your eyes who
[1:31:45] haven't seen but have still believed
[1:31:48] blessed are they that
[1:31:50] believe
[1:31:52] I don't need proof I don't need a
[1:31:54] newspaper article I don't need some
[1:31:56] testimony or some video I've already got
[1:31:58] the newspaper article it's downside of
[1:32:01] my
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:05] heart I don't need to prove it but what
[1:32:09] you'll find is the modern church has so
[1:32:12] deducted it down to a
[1:32:14] scientific understanding of the word do
[1:32:16] you realize when people leave the
[1:32:18] message over the hour this is the route
[1:32:20] that they are going
[1:32:24] if they will be honest and take that
[1:32:26] same critical thinking that they call it
[1:32:29] amen yeah I guarantee it's critical it's
[1:32:32] anointed from a demon Spirit called a
[1:32:33] demon of
[1:32:35] criticism it's Common Sense critical
[1:32:37] thinking you got to look at this
[1:32:39] rationally you got to look at it you
[1:32:41] know rationally got to look at it
[1:32:46] theologically and this is how they view
[1:32:48] things This Is How They approach things
[1:32:50] it's got to be understood and and that
[1:32:52] they've deducted it down you know what
[1:32:54] the modern church have done they have so
[1:32:56] analyzed the
[1:32:58] Bible that they take a scientific
[1:33:00] approach that when they are done Mark 16
[1:33:04] ah it was
[1:33:06] added the woman at the well we got to
[1:33:08] admit it's actually not there in the
[1:33:10] original
[1:33:11] manuscript and it was added Mark 16's
[1:33:13] gone they have so analyzed it woman at
[1:33:15] the well is gone uh uh they Chuck out
[1:33:18] anything that seems unreasonable to
[1:33:20] believe by their carnal mind
[1:33:22] as poetry they have textual variance and
[1:33:24] textual criticism and eschatology and
[1:33:27] harmonics and apologetics let me just go
[1:33:29] ahead and say I I if you ever get to the
[1:33:31] point to where we've got to apologize
[1:33:34] for the message of the hour we ought to
[1:33:36] just throw it out if we got to apologize
[1:33:38] to people and say I'm sorry about this
[1:33:40] we might as well hang up
[1:33:43] Prince let me say you don't need
[1:33:46] eschatology and harmonics and and all of
[1:33:48] these intellectual things what you need
[1:33:50] is revelation what you need need is a
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:54] demonstration the world doesn't need a
[1:33:57] de the world doesn't need a an
[1:33:59] interpretation they need a revelation
[1:34:02] that'll produce a
[1:34:07] demonstration but she has the word you
[1:34:10] say brother Matt what is your answer to
[1:34:12] the questions I've got the word
[1:34:14] demonstrated in my
[1:34:16] life can I go a little bit further you
[1:34:20] see what happens is as people people
[1:34:21] have got to have scientific educational
[1:34:24] proof they'll either go to one side or
[1:34:27] the other yeah I'm not going to get into
[1:34:29] it today I had it but I'm just going to
[1:34:31] skip it but you notice that there's all
[1:34:33] of these isms that you find in truth and
[1:34:36] and you'll always find it's always so
[1:34:38] amazing to me people will either go to
[1:34:40] one side or the other always there's
[1:34:43] always a ditch on both
[1:34:45] sides brother Brandon would stand
[1:34:47] against this as Ministry over and over
[1:34:49] and over again let me give you one quote
[1:34:51] he says some people make Church a
[1:34:56] Frolic others make it a funeral
[1:35:00] service oh dear God help us I'd rather
[1:35:04] have a Frolic than a funeral service I'd
[1:35:05] be
[1:35:06] honest but brother bam says some people
[1:35:09] make it a funeral some people make
[1:35:11] Church of Frolic and brother brandham
[1:35:12] says it's neither it's a
[1:35:17] feast and he says and the true bride
[1:35:19] goes down the middle of the
[1:35:24] but you see what Satan will do he'll
[1:35:26] always try to get us into ditches he'll
[1:35:29] always try to brother ad him says push
[1:35:31] your off to one extreme and if he can't
[1:35:33] get you over on that extreme he'll get
[1:35:35] you over on this extreme if he can't
[1:35:37] make you a dry-eyed intellectual to
[1:35:39] where everything's got to be scientific
[1:35:40] proof then it'll make you believe that
[1:35:42] unless you had some you know chill bump
[1:35:44] or some kind of sensation in your body
[1:35:46] then you didn't even have church there
[1:35:48] was actually no anointing there because
[1:35:50] no one shouted or screamed listen
[1:35:51] friends there's a ditch on both
[1:35:55] sides all right there's a ditch on some
[1:35:58] on both sides it's always amazing to me
[1:36:01] because I've always seen one or two
[1:36:03] things will happen with people you take
[1:36:06] the message of the hour take God's
[1:36:07] Prophet they'll either
[1:36:14] deify or they'll
[1:36:18] deemphasize I said they'll either deify
[1:36:20] the words of a prophet and say say it
[1:36:23] was you know the the literal Voice or
[1:36:25] they'll say you know what it was just
[1:36:26] his
[1:36:29] opinion y'all y'all never heard that you
[1:36:31] never am I the only
[1:36:33] one you'll find one or two ways always
[1:36:36] one or two ditches this is the devil's
[1:36:39] tactic I've watched some say we don't
[1:36:41] need
[1:36:46] emotion then I've watched others say we
[1:36:48] don't need
[1:36:50] teaching
[1:36:53] others say we don't need
[1:36:56] dancing well Mariam danced before the
[1:36:58] Lord David dance before the Lord dancing
[1:37:01] didn't start in the upper room it
[1:37:02] started in the back part of God's mind
[1:37:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:06] shouting didn't start in Acts shouting
[1:37:08] started in the mind of God when the sons
[1:37:09] of God shouted for
[1:37:12] Joy I give you the words of a Prophet
[1:37:14] this is an old time religion that we got
[1:37:17] this is the original faith that we
[1:37:20] got
[1:37:23] but you watch some cut out dancing then
[1:37:26] others who cut out dancing who who say
[1:37:28] we need who others who won't cut out
[1:37:30] dancing cut out brotherly love and say
[1:37:32] it doesn't matter how you treat each
[1:37:35] other doesn't matter if we love our
[1:37:37] neighbor well all
[1:37:40] right some cut out some emphasize the
[1:37:43] gifts others emphasiz the
[1:37:47] fruits some cut out the tapes and say we
[1:37:50] don't need the tap tapes we just need
[1:37:51] the
[1:37:53] Bible others say uh some cut out
[1:37:56] preachers and say we don't need
[1:38:00] preachers do you see the two extremes
[1:38:02] always one say we don't need the tapes
[1:38:05] other say we don't need preachers some
[1:38:07] say we don't need the message others say
[1:38:08] we don't need the Bible some cut out
[1:38:10] repentance others cut out Grace it's the
[1:38:13] tactic of the devil to push us into
[1:38:15] ditches but God's family goes down the
[1:38:19] middle of the road
[1:38:21] you say brother matth then what do we
[1:38:23] need you need dancing you need shouting
[1:38:25] you need the fruits you need the gifts
[1:38:27] you need preachers you need the tapes
[1:38:29] you need your Bible what are you saying
[1:38:31] you need all that God has for his family
[1:38:35] you need all of the gifts and all of the
[1:38:40] joy you need all of
[1:38:43] [Applause]
[1:38:47] it and then there's a spirit that says
[1:38:50] you don't need need to quote Brother
[1:38:53] brandom come on aren't we quoting
[1:38:56] brother brandom so much brother Matt I
[1:38:58] mean how long are we going to quote
[1:38:59] brother Brandon when are you going to
[1:39:01] get past a prophet when are we going to
[1:39:03] grow up and get P aren't you this out of
[1:39:05] man tell me that aren't we just carnal
[1:39:08] always brother brand we ashamed of that
[1:39:10] saying brother brandham said and the
[1:39:11] prophet said and the prophet said and
[1:39:12] the prophet said come on don't you know
[1:39:14] do you realize the spirit that's on that
[1:39:17] is a spirit that doesn't want to
[1:39:18] surrender to the headship of the word
[1:39:20] and so when they can remove the prophet
[1:39:22] they can remove the authority of the
[1:39:24] backing of God from that prophet's
[1:39:26] message and then they can get down and
[1:39:27] argue it to everybody's
[1:39:31] opinion we don't need the prophet
[1:39:33] anymore come on when you going to get
[1:39:35] past the prophet when you going to stop
[1:39:36] quoting I'm going to tell you what I
[1:39:37] told him I ain't never going to stop
[1:39:39] quoting a prophet when you're going to
[1:39:40] get past a prophet I ain't never going
[1:39:42] to get past a prophet when we going to
[1:39:44] grow up and be mature I'll tell you when
[1:39:46] when we start quoting a prophet and
[1:39:48] start saying what the prophet said that
[1:39:51] that's when but that's when the real
[1:39:52] power of God will come when we say what
[1:39:54] a prophet
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:59] said do we need to quote a prophet well
[1:40:02] do you realize Jesus lived and preached
[1:40:05] constantly under the knowledge that he
[1:40:08] was fulfilling the words of
[1:40:13] prophets Luke 18 behold we go up to
[1:40:16] Jerusalem and all things are written by
[1:40:18] the prophets concerning the son of man
[1:40:20] Luke
[1:40:21] 24-25 Jesus abraded them saying he said
[1:40:24] oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:40:28] believe
[1:40:30] all you mean there's some who only
[1:40:33] believe
[1:40:37] some you fools and slow of heart to
[1:40:39] believe oh come on say it with me that
[1:40:42] the
[1:40:43] prophets have spoken acts 3:24 I love
[1:40:47] this Paul clearly states prophets speak
[1:40:49] to the to the last days yay and all the
[1:40:54] prophets from Samuel and all those that
[1:40:57] follow after as many as have spoken have
[1:41:01] likewise foretold of these days you know
[1:41:04] John the Baptist understood and preached
[1:41:05] the message of prophets he didn't need a
[1:41:07] new revelation or a new doctrine or a
[1:41:10] new idea he was just quoting what the
[1:41:12] prophet
[1:41:13] said in those days John the Baptist
[1:41:16] Matthew 3:1 saying repent for the
[1:41:18] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the this is
[1:41:20] the voice of one crying in the
[1:41:22] wilderness all through the New Testament
[1:41:25] and then notice this in Matthew 8:16
[1:41:28] when even would come they brought to men
[1:41:29] who were demon-possessed let me get to
[1:41:31] it and he said and this was and healed
[1:41:34] all him who were ill in order that it
[1:41:35] was spoken through Isaiah the
[1:41:39] prophet so if Jesus preached the message
[1:41:42] of prophets if Paul preached the message
[1:41:44] of prophets if John preached the message
[1:41:46] of prophets then I think I'll quote from
[1:41:48] a prophet of
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:55] Hallelujah because it would be that
[1:41:58] message that would turn the hearts of
[1:42:01] the children back to the faith of the
[1:42:06] fathers do you realize Joshua God
[1:42:08] understood this and so God tells Joshua
[1:42:11] I want you to take 12 men and he says
[1:42:14] and he says notice this here look at
[1:42:16] Joshua chapter 4 and he says when the
[1:42:18] priest feet touch the water now Jordan
[1:42:23] was going to represent death it was
[1:42:25] going to represent sin right it was
[1:42:29] going to represent the final death you
[1:42:30] could say the crossing over and and and
[1:42:33] so God tells Joshua now we're going to
[1:42:35] cross over Jordan what do I want you to
[1:42:37] do I want you to take 12 men and he says
[1:42:40] and you're going to represent all of the
[1:42:42] nation of Israel these 12 men are going
[1:42:44] to represent every single tribe and he
[1:42:46] says and when the priest feet Touch the
[1:42:50] Water water in other words when they
[1:42:53] actually put their feet in death now not
[1:42:56] when they think about it there you go
[1:42:59] not when they what not when that they're
[1:43:01] imagining in their mind you see
[1:43:03] sometimes it takes action to move
[1:43:06] God sometimes God a wait for a natural
[1:43:09] thing to do a supernatural
[1:43:12] thing hello somebody you think your
[1:43:15] amens don't matter when hadti Wright
[1:43:17] didn't think it but when she spoke it
[1:43:19] with her mouth and said Amen brother
[1:43:23] brandham do you think your amens listen
[1:43:26] friends God sometimes waits for a
[1:43:28] natural thing to send a supernatural
[1:43:34] thing do you know why cuz you you say
[1:43:37] it's not important to say Amen to the
[1:43:38] word of God long as I just nod long as I
[1:43:40] say yeah just under my breath do you
[1:43:41] realize your words have the power to
[1:43:43] change the
[1:43:45] atmosphere do you realize that your
[1:43:47] words an amen a vocal amen agreement
[1:43:50] with the word of God have the ability to
[1:43:52] enter into an atmosphere and change the
[1:43:55] entire atmosphere around you you might
[1:43:57] be surrounded by doubt by depression by
[1:43:59] trouble by struggle I challenge you this
[1:44:02] morning say Amen to the word of God and
[1:44:04] watch what it'll do to that Spirit of
[1:44:06] Doubt around you watch what it'll do to
[1:44:08] that depression around you it'll change
[1:44:11] the
[1:44:13] atmosphere when you pull on a man of God
[1:44:16] what does it do it changes the
[1:44:18] circumstances around you
[1:44:24] prophet of God said when she spoke those
[1:44:25] words it felt like the room was about to
[1:44:28] come
[1:44:30] apart so it's when these priests put
[1:44:33] their feet in not when they think about
[1:44:35] it not when they when they you know when
[1:44:37] they get bold and boisterous what all
[1:44:39] you wait wait till what I'm going to
[1:44:40] listen friends a lot of people can talk
[1:44:42] a big
[1:44:43] talk but it TR takes a true man of God
[1:44:46] to put his foot out there in
[1:44:49] Jordan now listen the Bible says when
[1:44:53] they Place their feet in the Jordan
[1:44:56] Jordan part not the whole
[1:45:00] river but the place where his feet
[1:45:02] stands this is very different than Moses
[1:45:04] taking a staff and planted it in the
[1:45:07] water in all of the Nations David said
[1:45:09] the water stood up as a heap this isn't
[1:45:12] what happens in Jordan but actually it's
[1:45:14] not going to be the ministry of a
[1:45:15] Prophet come on somebody it's going to
[1:45:17] be the ministry of Faithful Men priests
[1:45:20] who plac their feet in the
[1:45:24] Jordan and God says I want you to take
[1:45:26] those men and have them plac their foot
[1:45:29] in the Jordan and when they put their
[1:45:31] foot their Jordan apart so the next man
[1:45:33] takes another step and a little bit more
[1:45:35] Jordan and another step and a little bit
[1:45:37] more Jordan and another step listen
[1:45:39] friends these men were doing things that
[1:45:41] no one else had to
[1:45:44] do let me just stop here and preach by
[1:45:47] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit men
[1:45:49] of God in your life life will have to go
[1:45:51] through things you never May ever
[1:45:53] experience in your
[1:45:55] life they will face things in spirits
[1:45:59] the families of those men not just the
[1:46:01] pastor not just the Evangelist but the
[1:46:04] families even the
[1:46:06] children will go through things those
[1:46:09] High priests were going to go through
[1:46:11] things that they would never you would
[1:46:12] never understand or even be able to
[1:46:14] relate with yeah
[1:46:18] amen because they were bearing the
[1:46:21] burdens of the rest of everybody
[1:46:25] else do you realize the weight upon a
[1:46:28] man to put his foot in the
[1:46:31] Jordan and when he puts there he's
[1:46:33] stepping into sin he's stepping into
[1:46:36] death and the Bible says that when they
[1:46:39] Place their foot
[1:46:41] there then Jordan Will
[1:46:43] part and you notice what happens when
[1:46:46] these men stand there come here Brothers
[1:46:48] come here all of you you three here come
[1:46:49] here come here Brothers you three here
[1:46:51] come here I want you to stand these
[1:46:52] three face the audience these three face
[1:46:55] them come here Brother come on come on
[1:46:56] don't be ashamed now come
[1:46:58] on shouldn't say ashamed don't be
[1:47:00] embarrassed it's all right face each
[1:47:03] other one more come on brother one more
[1:47:04] stand here I want you to notice this
[1:47:06] here this is the order that God wants
[1:47:08] them to cross through Jordan because it
[1:47:10] was going to be men that plac their feet
[1:47:13] in Jordan to where Jordan which
[1:47:16] represented sin it represented death it
[1:47:18] represented disease it represented
[1:47:21] everything of s sin would bring with it
[1:47:23] and when they placed their feet Jordan
[1:47:25] would part and the families would walk
[1:47:28] through the priest they would walk
[1:47:30] through and they'd go from Cana they'd
[1:47:32] go into Canaan and through Jordan into
[1:47:34] the promised land because there were
[1:47:36] priests who were standing there in the
[1:47:38] water and they would pass through listen
[1:47:41] friends these men have something on
[1:47:43] their shoulder that you ought to pray
[1:47:45] you ought to support you ought to say
[1:47:47] bless the man of God bless my pastor
[1:47:49] bless his family who's standing in the
[1:47:52] Jordan for
[1:47:58] me now what would happen let me ask you
[1:48:02] something what would happen if this
[1:48:04] brother who was going through a trial
[1:48:06] and he let his discouragement get him
[1:48:08] down so low that he stepped out of
[1:48:12] Jordan what happens if this brother got
[1:48:15] a spirit on him to listen to the to the
[1:48:17] Antichrist spirit that saying stop
[1:48:19] preaching close your iPad just push
[1:48:24] play and then this brother over here
[1:48:26] takes that hard trial and that hard
[1:48:28] circumstance and he just ain't got the
[1:48:30] strength to stand up anymore because he
[1:48:32] ain't got a church that'll support him
[1:48:33] and then he steps
[1:48:35] out do you realize what would happen if
[1:48:38] men of God stopped preaching the message
[1:48:40] of the hour do you realize what would
[1:48:43] happen if anointed vessels and
[1:48:45] consecrated men took their foot out of
[1:48:48] Jordan compromise would flood our church
[1:48:52] sin would flood our church diseases
[1:48:54] would flood our church do you realize
[1:48:57] what they're holding back you ought to
[1:48:58] say thank God for a man of God who will
[1:49:02] place his feet in
[1:49:04] Jordan
[1:49:09] Hallelujah and do we have a church
[1:49:12] that'll say to their Pastor preach the
[1:49:14] word of God preach the truth of God give
[1:49:17] it to me straight Pastor keep your foot
[1:49:19] in
[1:49:22] Jordan oh Hallelujah you want to thank
[1:49:25] God for a man of God God puts in your
[1:49:31] life I say preacher keep your foot in
[1:49:34] Jordan don't compromise don't look to
[1:49:37] the left or to the right amen if we ever
[1:49:40] had a time where we need men to be
[1:49:45] men to stand for
[1:49:49] truth
[1:49:51] amen it would be these stones of where
[1:49:54] they stood that would literally turn the
[1:49:58] hearts of people children back to the
[1:50:02] faith of the apostolic
[1:50:05] fathers hello
[1:50:07] somebody do you realize what the church
[1:50:10] what the what the truth and the
[1:50:11] preaching of the truth has the power to
[1:50:13] do it has the power to change
[1:50:16] circumstances it has the power to change
[1:50:18] lives it has the power power to block
[1:50:20] you from going to hell it has the power
[1:50:22] to anoint your faith when you're
[1:50:24] discouraged it has the power one day the
[1:50:27] preaching of the word will change your
[1:50:29] your faith in that word will change your
[1:50:32] body one

[1:50:44] preachers in fact he's got a lot of
[1:50:49] them
[1:50:51] what he hates is what's being
[1:50:57] preached it would be in Timothy let's
[1:50:59] look at it together it would actually be
[1:51:01] in the book of Timothy that would say
[1:51:03] that they would Heap unto themselves
[1:51:06] teachers having itching ears is that
[1:51:08] what it says they would let me find it
[1:51:10] here that they would have he they would

[2:01:14] principle I ain't got a nickel's worth
[2:01:16] of time for a wishy-washy give in
[2:01:18] compromising spirit a woman is a woman
[2:01:20] let her be a lady if a man is a man let
[2:01:23] him be a man if he's a president where's
[2:01:26] our John Quincy Adams where's our
[2:01:28] Abraham Lincoln's men of principle
[2:01:30] where's our Patrick Henry said Give me
[2:01:33] liberty or give me death where's a man
[2:01:35] that stands for what's right where's the
[2:01:37] man that's not afraid to speak out
[2:01:39] regardless if the whole world is against
[2:01:42] him speak out for what's right and stand
[2:01:44] for it and die for it there's Arnold Von
[2:01:49] Winker again today listen you know this
[2:01:51] quote very well where's Men of Integrity
[2:01:53] where's men of spirit they're so
[2:01:55] wishy-washy and gummed up until they
[2:01:57] don't know where they stand God let me
[2:02:00] stand with the principles of one man as
[2:02:04] a minister how many could say this the
[2:02:06] word of Jesus
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:10] Christ but what happens is Satan backs
[2:02:13] us down into a little corner somewhere
[2:02:15] and intimidates us yeah you know the
[2:02:18] Devil is a Spirit of
[2:02:21] intimidation he'll back you off of the
[2:02:23] promises of God yeah well maybe that
[2:02:27] wasn't for
[2:02:28] me brother Adam says that's the way in
[2:02:30] perseverance I sent this also brother if
[2:02:32] you have it that's the way you want to
[2:02:34] get to God be on his
[2:02:38] hands every
[2:02:40] morning every night every day constantly
[2:02:46] just keep seeking keep asking asking
[2:02:49] keep knocking just don't knock a little
[2:02:52] while keep knocking just don't knock a
[2:02:55] little while and get tired and go away
[2:02:57] just keep standing and say there Lord
[2:02:59] I'm here I'm not going to leave I'm on
[2:03:02] your hands now I'm going to stay right
[2:03:06] here you getting tired listening I'm
[2:03:09] having a great time
[2:03:13] knocking cuz I know you're coming amen
[2:03:17] that's when something happen happens he
[2:03:20] has to get you off his hand see he comes
[2:03:23] out to answer now Faith finds this I
[2:03:25] love this now there's only one thing can
[2:03:28] hold this sword that's the hand of Faith
[2:03:30] the hand of faith is the only thing that
[2:03:32] can yield this sword of Faith sword of
[2:03:34] the word now you might have a weak arm
[2:03:36] how many be honest here today and say my
[2:03:37] arm is not always strong just enough to
[2:03:40] pick it up for justification you're so
[2:03:43] weak maybe that's all you can cut
[2:03:44] through but the sword of the word will
[2:03:47] cut free every promise somebody say
[2:03:50] every every promise that God made in it
[2:03:52] if they get a good strong arm of Faith
[2:03:54] holding it there I believe God for my
[2:03:56] healing I believe God for my baptism God
[2:03:58] made the promise and Faith holds this
[2:04:02] sword every promise of God can be cut
[2:04:05] free by the word of
[2:04:08] God for it is a
[2:04:13] sword but you know what the problem is
