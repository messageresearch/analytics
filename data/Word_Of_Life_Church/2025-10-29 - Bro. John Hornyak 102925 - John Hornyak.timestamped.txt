[10:47] nights had someone at work who wanted to
[10:50] switch his Mondays for her Wednesdays so

[11:36] all the time.
[11:44] I'm amazed.
[11:47] Let's sing this real quick.
[11:50] I'm [singing] amazed
[11:53] [music]
[11:54] that you love me.
[11:57] [music] I'm [singing] amazed
[12:02] how [music] you care.
[12:06] Through your precious
[12:08] [music and singing]
[12:09] blood I found
[12:14] and my sins
[12:17] are washed. [music and singing]
[12:19] They're all washed away.
[12:22] All my [music] sins
[12:25] are [singing] washed
[12:27] away. [music]
[12:31] No one knew
[12:33] how alone I was feeling. [singing]
[12:37] [music]
[12:39] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[12:44] hide.
[12:47] Though [music and singing] I laughed and
[12:49] said my life was fine without you.
[12:56] I was covering [music and singing]
[12:57] up the secret tears I cried.
[13:03] [music]
[13:03] Then one [singing] day
[13:06] someone told me of your mercy
[13:12] and the love you [music and singing]
[13:14] showed on a hill called Calvary.
[13:19] [music and singing]
[13:20] There you die
[13:23] to purchase [music] my redemption.
[13:28] When you [singing] broke sin's power
[13:30] [music]
[13:31] and set my spirit free,
[13:37] I'm [music and singing] amazed
[13:40] that you love me.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[13:45] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed
[13:49] how you came
[13:53] through [music] your [singing] preious
[13:55] blood. I found you [music]
[14:01] and my [singing] sins
[14:03] are washed. [music]
[14:05] They're all [singing]
[14:07] washed away. [music]
[14:09] All my sins
[14:11] are washed [music]
[14:14] away. [singing]
[14:18] It's true. There have been days when I
[14:21] [music] failed you.
[14:25] Lord, you know the many [music] times
[14:28] [singing] I've gone astray.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[14:33] &gt;&gt; But I've heard your love is stronger
[14:36] than [singing] my weakness [music]
[14:41] and your [singing] ear is old every time
[14:45] I pray. [singing]
[14:48] [music]
[14:49] No one else has ever cared for me like
[14:54] [music] you, Lord. [singing]
[14:57] Other friends could never be as close
[15:01] [music] to me.
[15:04] I'm not [singing] afraid
[15:07] to face the problems of tomorrow.
[15:09] [music]
[15:11] [singing]
[15:13] Knowing you are everything
[15:17] [music and singing] I'll ever be.
[15:21] I'm amazed [singing]
[15:25] that [music] you love me. That you love
[15:28] me. I'm amazed
[15:32] [singing]
[15:33] how you [music] came.
[15:37] Through your preious [music] blood I
[15:41] [singing] found
[15:45] [music] and my sins
[15:48] are [singing] washed.
[15:50] They're [music] all washed away. All my
[15:54] [singing] sins
[15:56] are [music] washed
[15:58] away.

[23:52] &gt;&gt; If the singers are get ready to come
[23:54] make their way and brother David
[24:06] [music]
[24:10] so many [singing] times I've questioned
[24:15] certain certain circumstances [music]
[24:18] for things I could not [singing]
[24:21] understand.
[24:27] Many [music] times [singing] in trials,
[24:31] weakness blurs my vision
[24:34] and my frustration [music and singing]
[24:37] gets so out of hand.
[24:42] [music] And [singing] I am reminded
[24:47] I've never been [music]
[24:49] forsaken.
[24:51] I've never had to stand one test alone.
[24:55] [music and singing]
[24:58] And as I look at all [singing] the
[25:01] victories,
[25:03] the spirit rises [music] up in me as
[25:07] through the fire. My weakness [singing]
[25:10] is made strong. Sing it [music] to it.
[25:15] He never [singing] promised
[25:18] that the [music] cross would not be
[25:21] heavy
[25:22] and the hill would not be [music] hard
[25:26] to [singing]
[25:27] climb.
[25:31] [music] He never [singing] offered
[25:35] victories without fighting. [singing]
[25:38] He said h [music] would always come
[25:42] time. [singing]
[25:46] Just remember [music]
[25:47] when you stand
[25:50] in the valley [music and singing] of
[25:52] decision
[25:54] and the adversary
[25:56] s
[25:59] [music and singing]
[26:01] just hold on. [singing]
[26:05] Our [music] Lord will show
[26:09] and he will [music] take you through
[26:12] fire again. [singing]
[26:16] [music]
[26:18] I know [singing] within myself that I
[26:22] [music] will surely
[26:26] if I trust the hand of
[26:28] [music and singing] God, he'll shield
[26:30] the flames again.
[26:33] again.
[26:35] [music]
[26:40] He never [singing]
[26:41] promised [music] that the cross would
[26:44] not be heavy and the hill would not be
[26:49] hard to
[26:51] climb.
[26:55] He never [music and singing] offered
[26:59] victory without fighting. He said he
[27:03] would always come in [music and singing]
[27:06] time.
[27:10] Just remember [music] when [singing]
[27:12] standing
[27:14] in the valley of [music] decision
[27:18] and the adversary [singing]
[27:20] says [music]
[27:22] giving.
[27:24] Just hold on.
[27:29] [music] Our Lord will show
[27:33] and he [music and singing] will take you
[27:35] through the fire again. [music]
[27:40] Oh, just hold [singing] on.
[27:44] Our [music] Lord will show up
[27:48] and [singing] he will take you to the
[27:52] fire again. [singing]
[27:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[28:00] [applause]
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Let's give our singers a good hand.
[28:06] [applause]

[28:50] and trbled?
[28:55] No light
[28:57] [singing] in the [music] darkness.

[29:05] there's a light [singing] for [music] a
[29:08] look at

[29:55] [singing] dim
[29:58] in the light
[30:01] of his glory
[30:04] and grace. [singing]
[30:09] through death into [singing]
[30:12] life everlasting.
[30:16] [music]
[30:18] He passed and we follow [singing] him
[30:23] there
[30:26] over a sin. No more hath dominion
[30:31] [singing]
[30:35] for more [singing]
[30:37] than conquerors
[30:40] we are. [singing]
[30:43] [music]
[30:44] So turn
[30:47] [singing] your eyes
[30:49] [music] upon Jesus.
[30:53] [singing]
[30:55] Look [music] for

[31:00] face,
[31:05] and the [singing] things
[31:08] of earth

[31:14] dim
[31:16] in the [singing] light
[31:19] of his glory [music]
[31:22] and grace.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Let's [music] sing the chorus again.
[31:28] Turn [singing]
[31:30] your eyes [music]
[31:32] upon Jesus.
[31:38] Look for [singing]
[31:40] in his wonderful
[31:44] face. [singing]
[31:46] [music]
[31:48] And the things
[31:51] of [singing] earth
[31:53] will grow [music] strangely
[31:56] dim
[32:00] in the light [singing]
[32:02] of [music] his glory
[32:06] and grace.
[32:09] [singing and music]
[32:14] [applause]
[32:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:57] &gt;&gt; In Christ alone [singing]
[33:00] my hope is [music] found.
[33:04] He is my light, my strength,
[33:08] my [singing] song. [music]
[33:10] This cornerstone,
[33:13] this solid [singing] ground,
[33:17] firm through the [music] fiercest
[33:19] drought
[33:21] and storm.
[33:23] What heights [music and singing] of
[33:25] love,
[33:26] what depths of peace,
[33:29] when [music] fears are still [singing]
[33:33] and striving cease.
[33:36] My comforter,
[33:39] my [music] all [singing] in all.
[33:43] Here in the love of [music] Christ
[33:46] [singing] I stand.
[33:49] [music]
[33:52] In Christ [singing] alone,
[33:55] took on flesh, [music]
[33:58] fullness [singing] of God in helpless
[34:02] [music]
[34:03] faith. [singing]
[34:04] This gift of love
[34:07] and righteousness [singing]
[34:11] scorned [music] by the ones he came
[34:14] to [singing]
[34:15] sing. Till on [music] that cross
[34:19] as [singing] Jesus died. [music] The
[34:23] wrath of God was satisfied. [singing]
[34:29] For every [music] sin on him [singing]
[34:33] was laid.
[34:36] Here in the death of [music] Christ
[34:39] I [singing] live.
[34:42] [music]
[34:44] There in [singing]
[34:46] the ground
[34:47] his body laid.
[34:51] Light of the world by
[34:53] [music and singing] darkness
[34:56] slain. and bursting [singing and music]
[34:59] forth
[35:00] in glorious day.
[35:04] Up from the grave he [singing] rose
[35:07] again.
[35:10] And [music] as he stands in victory.
[35:13] [singing]
[35:16] Sin's curse has lost its grip on
[35:20] [music and singing] me.
[35:22] For I am his and [singing] he mine,
[35:28] brought with [music] a precious blood
[35:31] [singing]
[35:32] of Christ.
[35:37] No guilt in [music and singing] life,
[35:40] no fear in death.
[35:44] This is [music and singing] the power of
[35:45] Christ
[35:47] in me.
[35:49] From my first [music] try to the final
[35:54] pray,
[35:56] Jesus commands my [music] destiny.
[36:01] No power of hell.
[36:04] No [music and singing] scheme of man
[36:07] can ever pluck
[36:10] me from his [music and singing] hand
[36:13] till he rejects
[36:16] or calls [singing] me home. Here
[36:20] in the power of [music and singing]
[36:22] Christ
[36:23] I'll stand
[36:28] [music] till he returns
[36:31] or [singing] calls me home.
[36:35] Here in the power [music] of Christ
[36:39] I'll
[36:41] stand. [singing]
[36:45] [applause]
[36:55] stand
[36:57] as we get ready to go forth.
[37:00] Can you do that? I want Brother Harry to
[37:02] sing. When I think about how awesome our
[37:07] Lord and Savior is and all he does for
[37:09] us, it just I love to hear Brother Harry

[41:24] He's awesome as your

[41:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[41:33] I got all kinds.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; It's a good times going. There we go.
[41:38] Had a hornet.
[41:40] I got a box full of stuff. All right.
[41:45] My boys looked at me that the Granger
[41:48] box come on the porch. It's like, "Oh,
[41:49] good. I need that." And they said, "Dad,
[41:52] using a a prop again?"
[41:57] I just got to do what God tells me to
[41:58] do. So,
[42:00] &gt;&gt; I'm simple. If y'all aren't expecting to
[42:03] put on your wet suits and go deep, you
[42:06] might as well take them flippers off.
[42:07] We're staying right here on the surface.
[42:10] Amen. God bless you. It's good to be
[42:13] here.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I ain't got nothing new.
[42:21] Half of you about ready to hit the door.
[42:23] I ain't got nothing new.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; But I think I have something that the
[42:28] Lord wants to be said.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Something that you need whether you know
[42:33] it or not. Something that I need.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[42:42] we certainly love you, Lord. We thank
[42:44] you so much for all you do for us, Lord.
[42:47] We thank you for your presence. We thank
[42:49] you, Lord Jesus, for all the mighty
[42:52] things that you do, Lord. We're
[42:56] so thankful to you, Lord Jesus. And
[42:59] we've come to this place tonight,
[43:00] Father, to
[43:03] not hear from me or just see one
[43:06] another, even though that that's nice to
[43:09] see one another, Lord. We we believe in
[43:11] fellowship, Lord. But Lord Jesus, we're
[43:14] looking to get a little closer to you.
[43:16] We're looking to fellowship with you,
[43:18] Father. And Lord Jesus, that that can't
[43:21] happen unless I get out of the way.
[43:23] Unless the people get out of the way,
[43:25] Lord Jesus, and you just take over,
[43:28] Father,
[43:30] we just love you and we thank you so
[43:31] much. Just have your way. Be with us
[43:34] now. We ask it your name. Amen.
[43:39] Is this too It's rebounding real bad. I
[43:43] don't know how to Is that better? Okay,
[43:47] let's turn to Acts chapter 2, please.
[43:54] I know.
[43:58] So, I will tell you that
[44:04] the devil did not want this coming out.
[44:07] It's been on my heart for months. So,
[44:12] he's been fighting hard, but here I am.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Here they are.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; So,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Now, this could be like a 50-part
[44:23] series, but we're going to keep it
[44:25] short.
[44:29] Acts chapter 2, verse 37.
[44:37] Now, when they heard this, they were
[44:39] pricricked in their heart, and said unto
[44:41] Peter and the rest of the apostles, men
[44:43] and brother, what shall we do? Then
[44:46] Peter said unto them,"Repent and be
[44:49] baptized, every one of you, in the name
[44:50] of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
[44:52] sins, and ye shall receive the gift of
[44:56] the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto
[44:59] you and to your children, and to all
[45:04] that are a far off, even as many as the
[45:08] Lord our God shall call."
[45:11] May the Lord add his blessings to his
[45:12] word. You may be seated. I'm going to
[45:15] try
[45:18] Harry, you know how to do this.
[45:23] Usually I'm not a mic snob, but this is
[45:25] driving me crazy.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we are I'd like to
[45:44] speak, Lord willing, tonight on God's
[45:46] gift. God's gift. And I'm not talking
[45:49] about preachers.
[45:52] Oh. Oh. Not talking about a prophet.
[46:00] I'm talking about God's gift.
[46:04] When we think, what's God's gift? We
[46:07] always go immediately to that spot,
[46:11] right?
[46:13] &gt;&gt; We always go to Well, God's gift is is
[46:15] Brother Brandham.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, it is.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't brother Brandham,
[46:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Jackie knows where I'm going.
[46:29] It wasn't the Brother Brandon was not
[46:32] God's gift.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to get to
[46:36] the props.
[46:39] Now, I have here
[46:42] a box.
[46:46] I have another box
[46:50] and another box
[46:54] and another box. And then this box was
[46:58] to hold all the boxes.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[47:05] &gt;&gt; So each one of these boxes has the
[47:08] potential to hold something.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; When we think of a gift, we might think
[47:15] of
[47:16] it. It comes in a box. Well, some
[47:19] nowadays it's a bag. When I was a kid,
[47:21] it was a box.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Know the silly bags with the fru paper
[47:24] in it.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; It was a box. Now, these aren't taped up
[47:32] and and all fancy and but but but they
[47:35] could be.
[47:37] And you can see that this one, it says
[47:40] Steris. That's where I work. And I have
[47:42] a lot of boxes because I got a lot of
[47:44] parts.
[47:47] And so what I've done is is I've I've
[47:52] put certain things in in in boxes. And
[47:55] and I want you to think as yourself
[47:58] is just a box.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; We all have the potential to carry
[48:04] something
[48:05] &gt;&gt; within us.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; We all have that ability. That's what
[48:10] God made us for.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; We got the soul. That's our That's our
[48:15] box. We got a box. So
[48:19] when we come to the world,
[48:22] we scream,
[48:24] we shout, we whine, we cry, we do what
[48:28] boxes do.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And then we have a choice.
[48:33] We come up in age and we have a choice.
[48:38] What are we going to be filled with?
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[48:42] &gt;&gt; right. All right.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; What what is it that we are going to put
[48:46] inside of us?
[48:48] &gt;&gt; So being a holiness people,
[48:51] we want to put pure things, the word,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; good things,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; God things,
[48:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; We're we're born to serve God,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; the Native Americans never heard of
[49:04] Jesus Christ, but they worshiped. We
[49:06] were born to worship.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; We had a desire for that. Yeah.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; So these agnostics that think that we
[49:13] just are, they're going against human
[49:15] nature.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; It's just crazy.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; They're they're fighting the very thing
[49:20] that they are, they're they're just
[49:21] boxes. And so what they filled their box
[49:24] up with is unbelief.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; They filled their box up with doubt.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; They think we're crazy.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; But there's still a a box, a package,
[49:37] and they're looking to fill it up. And
[49:39] and everybody in the world is filled up
[49:40] with something.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; It's good something. It's a bad
[49:45] something. It's a crazy something.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about physical cuz
[49:52] if you're thinking you filled up with
[49:53] Twinkies, that's not what I'm talking
[49:54] about. I'm talking about spiritual
[49:56] things,
[49:59] &gt;&gt; natural things. That that that's not
[50:01] natural. We're talking about spiritual
[50:02] things. So, in this box right here,
[50:08] it's not the prettiest box. This is an
[50:11] actual part that I use at Steris. It's a
[50:15] It's a steam filter.
[50:19] Would this steam filter be any good to
[50:21] you? Do you have the uh the um um
[50:27] canister that this goes in? Do you use
[50:31] steam on a regular basis? No.
[50:35] No. Does anybody here use steam? Uh,
[50:38] brother Joel does. Oh, so all of a
[50:42] sudden
[50:44] this little thing has gone up in value
[50:46] to one person in particular.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Right
[50:51] &gt;&gt; now, God could put
[50:54] what you have inside of you for one
[50:56] person.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; What?
[51:05] Now, I've got this.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; We'll go into that a little bit more.
[51:13] Now, in this box,
[51:21] I've got this.
[51:25] Now,
[51:27] I imagine this cuts out about
[51:32] 50% of this population here.
[51:37] Right [sighs]
[51:38] &gt;&gt; now,
[51:40] Brother Josiah might deny it,
[51:44] but when you're not looking, he'd get
[51:46] down and play with this,
[51:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:55] Now, Sister Janet probably like, "I'll
[51:58] trip over that. Let's kick it to the
[52:00] side."
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I I went several places to find
[52:07] this particular thing, but we'll get to
[52:09] that here in a minute, too.
[52:13] But the box held that,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; now that appeals to more people,
[52:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:22] It's it's it's I know this is simple,
[52:25] but just stay with me.
[52:28] Now,
[52:32] this box is empty.
[52:35] It's about to have a bug in it.
[52:38] There's nothing in it. There's no value.
[52:41] You've all done that the the the package
[52:44] prank, right?
[52:48] You get something real small and you put
[52:50] it inside a box. inside a box. Inside a
[52:52] box, inside a box
[52:55] and then the person that's big, oh, I
[52:57] want the big one. And then they start
[53:00] unwrapping it and there's nothing really
[53:03] that great in it. Nothing there. Some
[53:07] people, they have no God. They just
[53:10] float.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; They just float. They're just there,
[53:17] empty.
[53:19] No purpose.
[53:21] I feel sorry for people like this.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; This comes from a lot of of different
[53:26] combinations. Maybe it was the way they
[53:28] were raised.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe they were told they were nothing.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; That they would never be anything.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; They never been exposed to the gospel.
[53:40] They just have nothing. They're just
[53:42] nothing.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Do you feel sorry for people like that?
[53:49] doesn't mean
[53:52] that there's not potential
[53:54] &gt;&gt; in this box.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; They just haven't been filled with much
[53:59] of anything yet.
[54:09] Now, this box
[54:16] is more trucks. I'm I'm sorry, ladies.
[54:18] I'm not really familiar with dolls.
[54:23] It might be unusual these days, but
[54:28] I know trucks,
[54:30] cars.
[54:34] Now, these are different than that one
[54:37] over there.
[54:40] Now,
[54:42] that one I I got at Walmart.
[54:45] That one I got at the Dollar Tree or
[54:48] Dollar General or something. But I want
[54:51] to go back to this right here. this
[54:52] filter. Now,
[54:56] if you were guessing,
[55:01] if I had a little a little boy up here
[55:04] maybe and I asked him to pick out
[55:07] something, he's going to go for these
[55:09] one of these cars. He's looking at this
[55:12] going,
[55:14] "Do you know how much this little thing
[55:15] right here is?"
[55:19] $1,821.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; it's valuable.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; You could buy a whole lot of little cars
[55:30] like that
[55:31] &gt;&gt; for this right here.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; But this means nothing
[55:37] &gt;&gt; to a little boy.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; This is valuable. Now, Brother Joel when
[55:46] he's looking at his budget says, "Slide
[55:49] that my way, brother John. Put put them
[55:52] steam filters on my Now, believe it or
[55:55] not, the little boy might not want this.
[55:59] Might not care anything about this,
[56:03] but this right here has a potential to
[56:06] save your lives. every one of you.
[56:12] It's a steam filter
[56:15] 0.1 microns.
[56:18] It goes on a steam sterilizer.
[56:21] The steam sterilizer is used
[56:25] to sterilize instruments used in the O.
[56:30] Oh,
[56:32] so if you got dirty steam
[56:34] and they get junk on those instruments
[56:36] and the doctor is using that instrument,
[56:40] you got the potential for infection.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Right
[56:47] &gt;&gt; now, you might not be able to put this
[56:49] into practice and use it, but I'm sure
[56:52] you would appreciate it if you were on
[56:53] the table.
[56:57] Right?
[56:59] &gt;&gt; I know it's simple, but it if you if you
[57:02] stop and think what I'm talking to you
[57:05] about spiritual things,
[57:09] this will help you.
[57:11] So, this thing is $1,821.
[57:14] And I've got a I just sold
[57:17] apparatus
[57:19] totaling almost $45,000 worth of stuff
[57:22] without the filters.
[57:25] 45. But the O that I s sold them to,
[57:30] they were excited about getting them.
[57:31] You know why? Cuz they had dirty
[57:36] steam.
[57:39] And this dirty steam
[57:42] was staining their instruments. And what
[57:45] happens when you get a stained
[57:46] instrument?
[57:48] They have to reprocess it.
[57:52] or if they miss it, it goes inside you
[57:55] or me.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; There's potential.
[57:58] Now, this was in Winston Salem. Don't
[58:00] worry about it.
[58:07] But they're willing to pay that high
[58:10] price. And brother Joel will tell you
[58:11] that hospitals are not ready to come off
[58:13] money real easy. He is a definite
[58:17] witness to that. They don't like coming
[58:20] off that money.
[58:22] So while that that in particular might
[58:25] not appeal
[58:29] to most people,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; it's still very valuable.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Very valuable. It saves lives
[58:40] potentially.
[58:42] right
[58:47] &gt;&gt; now.
[58:50] We've got this these little cars here.
[58:57] I'm getting to something. Hold on.
[59:01] I brought a pocketk knife cuz I know how
[59:03] these packages are.
[59:11] Now in the box, no little kid
[59:16] is ever going to say, "Oh, wow. That's
[59:19] neat."
[59:24] and leave it in the box. Never going to
[59:27] put it into into practice. Are you
[59:29] kidding me?
[59:31] They got to take it out. It's got to be
[59:34] used.
[59:38] Now,
[59:52] those little cars are great just like
[59:54] that.
[59:58] But in order to operate them,
[1:00:01] I've got to use them,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:05] You can't put gas in this and use it.
[1:00:10] And that's the way a lot of Christians
[1:00:12] are.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; They've got a gift,
[1:00:16] but they want to use it themselves.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; They want to do it all themselves.
[1:00:31] Now you know why I went to two different
[1:00:33] stores.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; again. This one is no good in a box.
[1:00:53] This is where that lapel mic would be a
[1:00:55] whole lot better here.
[1:01:04] Now this one.
[1:01:18] It goes by itself.
[1:01:23] Huh.
[1:01:25] I don't have to manly do it. I just have
[1:01:27] to pull it back a little bit.
[1:01:30] and let it go.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just got to pull back a
[1:01:38] little bit and let go.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Let God
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Let him
[1:01:45] He's the power.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's in charge.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; He's the one taking control. But we got
[1:01:52] We got too many people that that just
[1:01:55] want to play with this
[1:02:00] They have the potential for this.
[1:02:04] Let go and let God. Let God do it.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I know it's simple.
[1:02:15] But if we stop, step back and look at
[1:02:17] it,
[1:02:19] that's what God wants to do with us.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He wants he's we got all the potential
[1:02:24] in the world. He wear all the package.
[1:02:28] And there's different places and stages
[1:02:30] and and and thing that people are at.
[1:02:33] Some are empty. Some got a lot in them.
[1:02:36] We got denominational people.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; We've got message people.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; And we're so focused on the ministry and
[1:02:47] on brother Brandon, but we're not seeing
[1:02:49] that we are that package
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; and we have the potential for God to use
[1:02:56] me.
[1:03:07] Now,
[1:03:09] so we get to this place. It says,
[1:03:10] Brother Brandham says, "God bless you,
[1:03:12] my Christian friend, when you sit down,
[1:03:15] you Christians around them, shake their
[1:03:16] hands and give them your your right hand
[1:03:18] of fellowship. Say, God bless you." Now,
[1:03:20] this is this is as far as denominations
[1:03:23] go. Turn around, shake your hands.
[1:03:27] You're Christians now? You're saved.
[1:03:29] That's salvation.
[1:03:33] And then he asked, he said, "All of you
[1:03:34] happy they come to Christ? If you are,
[1:03:37] say amen."
[1:03:39] How many promise will promise these
[1:03:42] Christians that tonight before they go
[1:03:43] to bed, these will just now accepted
[1:03:45] Christ? So he he's saying you'll pray
[1:03:46] for them. He said, "Now remember, you're
[1:03:50] just accepted Christ. See, now God will
[1:03:53] give you the Holy Ghost in confirmation
[1:03:56] of your faith.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; So a lot of the Christian churches
[1:04:02] believe that you get the Holy Ghost
[1:04:06] right when you accept Christ.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And that's all the further they get.
[1:04:10] They set on the salvation and they don't
[1:04:12] ever move forward in in the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; They sit right there and say, "Okay, I'm
[1:04:18] a Christian now.
[1:04:20] Uh-huh.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; So when they accept that,
[1:04:27] they're like this.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's their salvation.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; They're in charge. They're in control.
[1:04:34] They're the ones running their lives.
[1:04:35] They're the ones telling where to go and
[1:04:38] how to go and what to do.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of preachers like that.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Got a lot of lot of uh singers like
[1:04:49] that.
[1:04:50] Come on now.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; They want to do it. They're going to be
[1:04:54] a blessing and they and they've got
[1:04:55] talent.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; We've seen preachers that have a lot of
[1:05:00] talent.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; They can really preach,
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; but they're the ones steering.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; They're the ones doing it. Anybody can
[1:05:12] put it together. Anybody can study it.
[1:05:13] We've got an info base, right?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's not hard to do. Yeah,
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; you can get a thought and bless God. You
[1:05:20] can really preach
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hitler was a preacher,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Now, before you start texting me nasty
[1:05:41] stuff, I ain't calling anybody a Hitler.
[1:05:43] I'm just saying. [snorts]
[1:05:47] But that's where that's where people are
[1:05:48] at. They they they accept Jesus Christ
[1:05:51] and their salvation is there and they
[1:05:53] and their their little package and they
[1:05:55] and they're letting that whatever that
[1:05:56] Jesus Christ they accepted that they
[1:05:58] they let they let it down in their heart
[1:06:00] and they say, "Okay,
[1:06:03] I'm good enough."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; There is
[1:06:09] an overabundance of that mentality
[1:06:13] in this message.
[1:06:16] I've accepted the message. I'm good
[1:06:18] enough.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I listen to tapes. I pay my tithe. I go
[1:06:27] to church or I don't go to church or
[1:06:30] whatever it might be. There's an
[1:06:32] overabundance of of getting settled
[1:06:35] right there.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And that's good.
[1:06:43] We want people to be saved.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with people getting saved,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; but we know better.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; We know better than just to set on it.
[1:06:56] We've been taught.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; You might as well be an empty box. In
[1:07:08] fact, you're better off being an empty
[1:07:09] box
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; than to know the truth and not move
[1:07:14] forward.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Now, just because he's called you and
[1:07:21] you've accepted him
[1:07:29] and you say, "Okay, I want to move
[1:07:31] forward
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's the thing about a gift.
[1:07:40] A pardon is only a pardon when received
[1:07:43] as a pardon.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:07:53] like I said, brother Josiah would go for
[1:07:56] the cars before he'd go for the filter.
[1:07:58] Maybe not anymore. You might think eBay.
[1:08:06] And that's fine. If he can use the cars
[1:08:09] more than he can use the filter, I'd
[1:08:11] rather see him play with the cars than
[1:08:13] just throw that in the back.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; It's a stainless steel filter. You might
[1:08:18] get a dollar at at the scrapyard,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; maybe.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Do you see how devalued it can become?
[1:08:27] So that gift in in in the ministry, in
[1:08:30] in in singing, in any of those things,
[1:08:34] if we're not careful, we can devalue
[1:08:36] them and put them aside.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; We can say, "Well, that's that's nice."
[1:08:47] And a lot of times we do that to
[1:08:48] ourselves, our own gifts. We devalue our
[1:08:51] gift because we're not in front of
[1:08:53] people. Trust me, I I would rather be
[1:08:55] right back there than up here.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; But this is what I've been given.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And some of you have been given a gift
[1:09:10] and you've devalued it and said, "Well,
[1:09:12] the people don't appreciate it.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Or the people are getting tired of it
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; or the people don't want to hear me sing
[1:09:20] because they've heard me so much.
[1:09:26] Uh
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; oh.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord's been convicting me about
[1:09:32] something. I'm just going to open up
[1:09:33] this. Here I am. Brother John.
[1:09:43] I have
[1:09:45] been approached
[1:09:49] and this is the way that I guess this is
[1:09:51] this is lingo preacher lingo which I'm
[1:09:55] too dumb to recognize it I guess but
[1:09:59] by pastors or people with churches
[1:10:02] brother why don't you come down and
[1:10:03] visit us
[1:10:07] okay I don't see myself in Georgia
[1:10:11] anytime soon.
[1:10:13] I ain't lost nothing there, right?
[1:10:15] [snorts]
[1:10:16] I'm sure it's nice there or, you know,
[1:10:18] wherever it might be. Well, I learned
[1:10:20] that's the way that they communicate.
[1:10:24] Say, "Hey, come down and preach for me
[1:10:25] sometime."
[1:10:27] So, that was what I heard years ago.
[1:10:30] Well, I've heard it more recently. Won't
[1:10:32] you come down and visit us sometime?
[1:10:36] And I just look at him and say,
[1:10:38] "Brother, I ain't looking for a place to
[1:10:40] preach.
[1:10:42] I'm not going to call you up and say,
[1:10:44] "Hey, I'm in the neighborhood."
[1:10:49] You got to you got something for me to
[1:10:50] do. Now, if that's what God's called you
[1:10:53] to do and how you called to do it,
[1:10:54] that's that's one thing.
[1:10:58] It's it's different from a missionary.
[1:11:00] It's different. It's it's it's according
[1:11:02] to your call. It's according to your
[1:11:04] thing.
[1:11:06] That's okay. I'm not speaking against
[1:11:08] it, but that that's not that's not me.
[1:11:14] But saying it the way I said it,
[1:11:17] not very nice.
[1:11:20] Cuz again, brother John here, is brother
[1:11:22] John out there, and brother John here?
[1:11:24] I'm just plain plain talk is
[1:11:29] never misunderstood.
[1:11:35] But there's approach to it. There's a
[1:11:37] better way. Now, I have a gift and some
[1:11:40] people can can appreciate it. It's not
[1:11:42] for everybody. I might be like that
[1:11:44] filter. I might catch one. That's fine.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I ain't looking to be something. I'm not
[1:11:49] looking to do something.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; But if he wants to use me,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; then okay.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times that's what this the
[1:11:58] singers are doing. That's what that's
[1:11:59] what people that that are in the church
[1:12:01] that are that they've got a gift and
[1:12:03] God's called them to do something. They
[1:12:04] want them to do something,
[1:12:10] but they're too humble for their own
[1:12:11] good or too um
[1:12:17] don't want to put themselves out there.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Just being honest.
[1:12:29] But God has put that gift in your life
[1:12:32] for a reason. Whatever it may be, not
[1:12:35] everybody's a preacher.
[1:12:40] Not everybody gets up here and sings.
[1:12:42] Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:49] That's okay.
[1:12:51] Don't be a singer if you're not a
[1:12:53] singer.
[1:12:57] do it in the shower. That's fine.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; There's I I you know, and and people
[1:13:03] laugh and they think it's funny, but but
[1:13:05] seriously, God God wants you to be in
[1:13:08] your place doing what you're called to
[1:13:10] do.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And so if that gift is in you to do
[1:13:16] that,
[1:13:18] he wants it to operate.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; There's a reason. Now, I told you I'm
[1:13:26] not looking for anywhere to preach, but
[1:13:28] if you invite me, I'll go. I got no pre
[1:13:32] problem with that. I just need to
[1:13:34] approach it a little different, I think,
[1:13:35] the way I the way I say it.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; But I if people are asking you to sing,
[1:13:45] it's because you bless them.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; And if you bless them,
[1:13:52] you might be like this filter. They
[1:13:54] might be the only one
[1:13:57] in the whole church that gets blessed by
[1:14:00] it.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; But if one soul is worth 10,000 worlds,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; that's
[1:14:12] simple. I know. I know.
[1:14:17] He says, "Now remember you just accepted
[1:14:20] Christ." See, now God will give you the
[1:14:23] Holy Ghost in in confirmation of your
[1:14:26] faith.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, so he kind of squashes that whole
[1:14:30] idea that you say you're saved, you get
[1:14:32] the Holy Ghost. He says he'll give you
[1:14:34] the Holy Ghost in confirmation of your
[1:14:36] faith.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; But it's still a gift,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; right? We read it's a gift,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; we don't have to work for it.
[1:14:47] And every one of us has that gift inside
[1:14:50] of us. That's the gift. The Holy Ghost
[1:14:52] is the gift. Brother Brandham was the
[1:14:54] man, the box that the gift worked
[1:14:57] through.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus Christ, Brother Brandham
[1:15:02] said, he was nothing to behold. He
[1:15:05] wasn't a good-looking feller,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; but he was a box.
[1:15:16] that God could get inside and use.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; It was a shell.
[1:15:32] Give you the Holy Ghost and confirmation
[1:15:33] of your faith. See, now you get some
[1:15:36] full gospel church and be baptized right
[1:15:38] away. [sighs]
[1:15:40] Oh
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; yeah. So he's giving you a prescription,
[1:15:44] something that you have to do.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; It's not sit on the pew in a message
[1:15:50] church and you're great.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; You have to get the the gift of the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost. He's given you a gift. When you
[1:16:01] sit in here, you're well aware of what
[1:16:03] the gift is. But if you sit on your pew
[1:16:06] and you don't move towards that gift and
[1:16:08] you don't do the things you've got to do
[1:16:09] to get that gift,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then shame on you.
[1:16:24] get baptized right away. And God's under
[1:16:27] obligation.
[1:16:29] Obligation.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He's under obligation.
[1:16:37] That means he has to.
[1:16:44] Another thing that I I I find a I kind
[1:16:47] of maybe need to ease up on is
[1:16:50] somebody asked me to do, you know, or
[1:16:54] I'll say, hey, if you need anything, let
[1:16:56] me know.
[1:16:58] And then I find out, well, I didn't want
[1:17:01] to ask you.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Did you think I was lying to you?
[1:17:08] Is that my reputation?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; I've I've straight told somebody, "Well,
[1:17:13] you think I'm lying?"
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Again, I need to be a little softer,
[1:17:17] maybe.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; But I don't I don't lie. If I tell you,
[1:17:20] if you need something, if it's in my
[1:17:21] power, I I'll do it for you.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And when I say that, when I put myself
[1:17:29] out there, if they need something and I
[1:17:31] can do it, then I'm under obligation to
[1:17:33] do it.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Don't say it if you don't mean it.
[1:17:37] That's right.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be Christlike, right?
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And he's under obligation to give us the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost if we follow the
[1:17:46] prescription.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Repent, be baptized in the name of the
[1:17:49] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:17:52] your sins, and ye shall receive the
[1:17:55] gift.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And once that empty box gets full of the
[1:17:59] gift,
[1:18:01] then it's time to see where that gift
[1:18:03] fits in the body.
[1:18:10] Maybe it's behind an organ
[1:18:13] blessing the people
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; or maybe it's in a pew
[1:18:18] praying
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; but it's the gift all the same.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; It's not so far-fetched as it's still
[1:18:29] the gift. Yeah,
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; it's valuable to one person or another.
[1:18:36] God doesn't just give out gifts just to
[1:18:39] give out gifts. It's for a purpose in
[1:18:41] the church.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; He's under obligation to give you the
[1:18:49] Holy Ghost. Why? Because he wants that
[1:18:51] gift operating in the church. Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And it might be behind a pulpit or
[1:18:58] behind an organ or in a pew, but it's
[1:19:01] still the gift.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And you got to have the gift in order
[1:19:04] for God to be able to use it.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for is is yes,
[1:19:11] we're a box.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without
[1:19:16] repentance,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:23] So what that means is everybody
[1:19:27] has something that they're good at.
[1:19:28] Everybody.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Now it takes some people a long time to
[1:19:35] find out what they're good at.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; That's okay.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; But if you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:19:45] then he can operate through that gift.
[1:19:50] The gift operates the gift.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; God's under obligation to give you the
[1:20:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost the moment the
[1:20:05] moment you're baptized.
[1:20:09] Brother John, I've been baptized
[1:20:14] 14 times.
[1:20:19] And I don't think I have the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Now God's going to be blunt.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Do you think I'm a liar?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:20:36] if you don't have it, he's under
[1:20:39] obligation. Is that right? He's under
[1:20:40] obligation to give it to you.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And if you don't feel like you got it,
[1:20:45] then you didn't follow the prescription
[1:20:46] right. You haven't repented for
[1:20:48] everything.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; It's not a complicated situation.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; He's under obligation to give you the
[1:20:57] gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; And we spend so much time the go the
[1:21:03] devil's got us in our mind
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; in our mind over and over again. Oh, you
[1:21:09] made that mistake. You ain't got the
[1:21:10] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; He never said the box would be perfect.
[1:21:16] He said he would fill the box
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; with the gift to use the gift.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:21:35] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:21:37] of your sins and ye shall receive the
[1:21:41] gift
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:44] And
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; that gift is what operates through you
[1:21:49] to bless his church, to bless his
[1:21:54] people.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; We're, and I've spoke on this before,
[1:22:01] God is an object of worship. He wants us
[1:22:04] to worship,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:10] If he's an object of worship and he
[1:22:12] wants us to worship, who's getting the
[1:22:14] blessing?
[1:22:16] Well, brother Josiah could say, "I was
[1:22:19] blessed." Ah, [snorts]
[1:22:23] but it was his gift that was blessed.
[1:22:26] That Holy Ghost inside of him was
[1:22:29] blessed
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; through the gift. Do you understand what
[1:22:32] I'm saying? It goes right back around.
[1:22:34] It's full circle. God is an object of
[1:22:36] worship. He gives us a gift to bless the
[1:22:39] church.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Who's the church? The boxes.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; What do the boxes have in them? The Holy
[1:22:49] Ghost.
[1:22:51] So that's how Brother Harry's gift can
[1:22:54] bless my gift.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And he's doing it the right way because
[1:22:58] I get blessed because the gift inside of
[1:23:01] me
[1:23:02] is him. Yeah.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:23:08] Say, "Brother John, you're really
[1:23:09] confusing me here."
[1:23:14] You got the Holy Ghost, right? If you
[1:23:17] got the Holy Ghost and I've got the Holy
[1:23:19] Ghost, God's an object of worship,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is God,
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:29] [snorts]
[1:23:33] So
[1:23:35] God will use God to bless God.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; So when we pull back our gift, then God
[1:23:51] can't use
[1:23:53] our gift to bless God
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; also you. We get the benefits of it.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets on our flesh.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; That's okay. That's okay. It's okay to
[1:24:12] have the Holy Ghost on our flesh. That's
[1:24:13] what makes us jump and shout and turn
[1:24:15] about and all that stuff. That's
[1:24:16] wonderful. It's it's it's awesome to
[1:24:18] feel that.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; But the prophet also say, don't don't
[1:24:24] jump higher than you live. But if you
[1:24:26] got the gift and it's getting blessed,
[1:24:29] you're going to jump just the right
[1:24:30] amount.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; To give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost the moment you're baptized, if you
[1:24:47] come with a true heart believing, Peter
[1:24:50] said, just repent and be baptized and
[1:24:52] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:24:54] Ghost. Is that right? God promised it
[1:24:56] now.
[1:24:58] He'd make everything right.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; God's not a liar.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; So many people I know have been seeking
[1:25:08] after the Holy Ghost. Seeking after the
[1:25:11] Holy Ghost. Seeking after the Holy
[1:25:13] Ghost. And you know what keeps the Holy
[1:25:15] Ghost away?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Doubt
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; and fear. That's true.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost cannot dwell amongst
[1:25:24] those things.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; So if the devil can get you to doubt,
[1:25:28] you repent. You've been baptized with in
[1:25:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:31] You've been you repented of all your
[1:25:33] sins for the remission of your for the
[1:25:35] remission of your sins.
[1:25:39] And then the devil swoops in and says,
[1:25:41] "Oh boy, did you really repent? Cuz man,
[1:25:45] that box really looks messed up.
[1:25:51] you really made some stupid mistakes.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're right. And then the Holy
[1:25:57] Ghost flutters off.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; It's not that he didn't fulfill his
[1:26:02] promise,
[1:26:04] but it can't dwell in doubt and fear.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; This is this is message. I'm not
[1:26:11] preaching anything way outside. This is
[1:26:14] but but we've got our minds so so
[1:26:16] twisted around with with traditions and
[1:26:18] and and things that we've got and we we
[1:26:20] settle down and we think we ah I got to
[1:26:22] work it up. I got to work it out.
[1:26:25] But am I am I right in saying that that
[1:26:28] the Holy Ghost can't dwell with doubt
[1:26:30] and fear?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; So it's not that you didn't get the Holy
[1:26:36] Ghost. It's that you the devil got in
[1:26:39] your head and he's pushed off.
[1:26:57] now.
[1:27:01] Boy, I meant to mark time.
[1:27:06] I always forget that. I think a lot of
[1:27:08] preachers do that.
[1:27:11] forget to look up at the clock because I
[1:27:13] get but I won't hold you too much
[1:27:15] longer.
[1:27:17] Like I said, I got at least 100 parts of
[1:27:20] this.
[1:27:24] Brother Bram says and that was that that
[1:27:26] last quote was God's provided way.
[1:27:30] This is this is question and answers in
[1:27:33] I think 50 54.
[1:27:40] Does this church
[1:27:43] teach you that you have to speak in
[1:27:45] tongues to receive the Holy Ghost?
[1:27:49] Now, we've been taught well enough to
[1:27:51] know that in the message we don't
[1:27:53] believe that.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] But I'm afraid that there's some other
[1:28:03] things
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; that aren't clear in this message. Not
[1:28:08] because it's not taught or not because
[1:28:10] it's not in the message,
[1:28:13] but it's a lot of carryover from other
[1:28:15] things,
[1:28:17] traditions,
[1:28:19] doubts, fear. The devil tells us all
[1:28:22] kinds of crazy stuff. So, I could change
[1:28:24] that that question into does this church
[1:28:30] believe that you got to be perfect
[1:28:36] to have the Holy Ghost?
[1:28:41] Does this church
[1:28:43] believe
[1:28:45] that you got to
[1:28:48] be stoic in the pews
[1:28:51] or run and shout
[1:28:55] or be a part of this church or this
[1:28:59] group?
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; We're we're well we're well verssed
[1:29:04] here. This is we're not lacking teaching
[1:29:06] in this way at this church. Thank God.
[1:29:10] But we'll run across people in this
[1:29:13] message that have confusion surrounding
[1:29:16] this.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; I don't have the Holy Ghost because
[1:29:21] just fill in the blank.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; No sir, we don't.
[1:29:32] Speaking in tongues is a gift of the
[1:29:34] Holy Ghost. It's a gift of the Holy
[1:29:36] Ghost.
[1:29:38] So
[1:29:40] we look to the nine spiritual gifts of
[1:29:42] the Holy Ghost. That's the gift of the
[1:29:45] Holy Ghost and that's the way it it can
[1:29:48] operate. Now we're also taught that it
[1:29:51] just just because it's a gift of the
[1:29:53] Holy Ghost if
[1:29:56] it's not a sign. It's like healing or
[1:30:01] anything else. It's it's an operation of
[1:30:03] the gift.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? It's
[1:30:07] an operation of the gift inside of you.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:30:12] just like singers,
[1:30:15] some people can write beautiful songs,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't carry a tune in a lard
[1:30:21] bucket.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; That means that their gift is writing
[1:30:27] songs.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes that gift marries up with
[1:30:32] somebody who can sing.
[1:30:38] But the same thing happens it it applies
[1:30:40] in in in in your life with each
[1:30:43] individual gift.
[1:30:46] Now my gift might be behind the pull pit
[1:30:50] and I might also have speaking in
[1:30:52] tonesues
[1:30:54] but it doesn't mean that with speaking
[1:30:55] in tonesues I get interpretation of
[1:30:57] tongues. doesn't mean all that.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And that's where having the Holy Ghost
[1:31:08] and not being this
[1:31:12] you operating that gift.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; He wants it automatic. He wants you to
[1:31:21] pull back just a little bit
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; and let him move you. Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Whatever capacity it is,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; we've all heard brother Donnie say he's
[1:31:35] got a missionary's heart,
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; but not the stomach, right? [laughter]
[1:31:42] He has a hard time eating over there.
[1:31:46] That's okay.
[1:31:50] That's okay.
[1:31:54] You might have a certain thing that the
[1:31:55] the Holy Ghost can operate through.
[1:31:58] I know this is not we're we're going
[1:32:00] slow, but you all are paying attention.
[1:32:02] It's good.
[1:32:08] God is going to use you how he wants to
[1:32:10] use you. Don't get get discouraged
[1:32:13] because your Holy Ghost is not operating
[1:32:15] like mine.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you don't have the Holy
[1:32:18] Ghost. And so that's one of the tricks
[1:32:21] of the devil is he he wants us to look
[1:32:23] at at somebody else,
[1:32:29] [snorts]
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; but that somebody else is maybe looking
[1:32:34] at you,
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; the deacons
[1:32:49] have a special gift.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; It's a special gift.
[1:33:00] They can deal with problems
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; and know some pretty nasty stuff that
[1:33:06] goes on in the church.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And treat you or treat that person
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; like nothing ever happened.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; That's a gift.
[1:33:21] Now,
[1:33:24] just because brother Keith doesn't have
[1:33:26] that gift doesn't make him any less of a
[1:33:29] Christian or make his Holy Ghost any
[1:33:31] less of him.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You'd think, well, the the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:37] yeah, that'll cover all that. No, we
[1:33:39] still got our humanity.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's part of it.
[1:33:57] says,
[1:34:00] "Now you can speak with tongues and
[1:34:01] still not have the Holy Ghost." Now,
[1:34:03] just remember that
[1:34:06] I've seen witches and wizards come up
[1:34:08] speaking in tongues. They ain't got no
[1:34:10] Holy Ghost,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; you know. I've seen them come up
[1:34:13] shouting and jumping. And they ain't got
[1:34:15] a Holy Ghost. I've seen a corn dance
[1:34:16] here not long ago out up in a little
[1:34:18] piece of Douglas, Arizona up there and
[1:34:21] seen a corn dance when they have
[1:34:23] have it up there and the wizard come out
[1:34:25] and they carried on terrible and
[1:34:26] everything and carried and throw dirt
[1:34:28] over o over him there and that didn't
[1:34:31] mean he was saved. The man was a witch
[1:34:34] doctor.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:34:40] let's stop at the witch doctor. That's
[1:34:42] easy to see. I ain't got that
[1:34:48] twins. We know that the message twins
[1:34:54] right here in this church
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; come to church to pay their ti and do
[1:34:57] the right things.
[1:35:01] Ain't going to got a bit more of the
[1:35:03] gift
[1:35:04] than anything.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; A scary place to be.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; But that's the thing about our gift.
[1:35:15] as we can treat them the same. We can
[1:35:17] love them the same.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; But our gift will also say you better be
[1:35:23] careful.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; That's tight. I know that's that's
[1:35:28] uncomfortable. That makes us
[1:35:29] uncomfortable because we don't want to
[1:35:31] think that about anybody.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; We don't. Which is good. We don't want
[1:35:35] to think that that way about anybody.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; But that's part of your gift.
[1:35:41] We've had people not behind this pullpit
[1:35:44] as far as I know, but at at Happy
[1:35:46] Valley, we had had ministers up there
[1:35:49] could preach like a house on fire,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Run out on their wives.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Out selling whiskey now.
[1:36:10] Come on.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; It's truth.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Dickinson used to say, "The
[1:36:15] truth will stand when the world's on
[1:36:17] fire."
[1:36:19] It's the truth.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Does that mean that Brother Donny's gift
[1:36:26] didn't catch it? Maybe that wasn't what
[1:36:30] Maybe God wanted to use that right
[1:36:32] there.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Don't listen. Brother Donniey's gift at
[1:36:36] at all as a pastor.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He's very protective of of his sheep and
[1:36:41] always has been.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; I'll skip down. If a genuine Holy Ghost
[1:36:54] person is born of the Holy Spirit of
[1:36:57] God, he'll live a godly life. [snorts]
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Some of them was just living horrible
[1:37:03] lives, you know.
[1:37:05] And you just you know that their fruits
[1:37:08] prove that they wasn't. Jesus said by
[1:37:11] their fruits you shall know them. And
[1:37:14] the fruit of the spirit is not speaking
[1:37:16] in tongues or fill in the blank. That's
[1:37:20] the gift of the spirit.
[1:37:23] Huh? [sighs]
[1:37:27] You can fake it for a long time but it's
[1:37:30] going to come out.
[1:37:35] You can be filled with a lot of stuff
[1:37:38] other than God, but it's going to come
[1:37:40] out.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit,
[1:37:45] not one of those ministers
[1:37:48] has impacted my walk in a negative way.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; I hate that they're gone. I hate that
[1:38:01] they backslid.
[1:38:04] But I'm not putting away every other
[1:38:05] minister. Why? Because I'm not looking
[1:38:07] at the gift
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; or or the the the man. I'm looking at
[1:38:11] the gift behind the man.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Now we we sing uh greater is he that is
[1:38:20] in me than he that is in the world.
[1:38:22] Yeah.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; So that means that what's inside of us,
[1:38:29] if we trust it, if we pull back a little
[1:38:32] bit and just let him have us, he'll lead
[1:38:35] us and guide us into all truths. That's
[1:38:37] scripture.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; All truths.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; He'll let us know. Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; The problem is is people get so attached
[1:38:46] to to the box,
[1:38:50] a certain box, that when it it gets
[1:38:54] exposed or or tore open,
[1:38:58] they just want to throw up their hands
[1:39:00] and say, "Well, I guess I guess that's
[1:39:02] it.
[1:39:08] I I guess God don't use ministers
[1:39:10] anymore.
[1:39:22] I want to turn to Numbers chapter 21. I
[1:39:26] got a little bit more little bit more
[1:39:28] time.
[1:39:36] Verse four. [snorts]
[1:39:42] And they journeyed from Mount by
[1:39:44] the way of the Red Sea to come past the
[1:39:46] land of Edom. And the soul of the people
[1:39:49] was much discouraged because of the way.
[1:39:52] And the people spake against God and
[1:39:54] against Moses. Ah. Uh-oh.
[1:39:58] That was God's. Now, he didn't have the
[1:40:00] Holy Ghost, but but he was the box that
[1:40:02] God was using. Yeah.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Wherefore have ye brought us up out of
[1:40:09] Egypt to die in the wilderness? For
[1:40:11] there is for no bread, neither is there
[1:40:15] any water. Our soul loaith, and our soul
[1:40:18] loaith this bread. So
[1:40:22] here they are. God's delivered them.
[1:40:26] They've accepted salvation.
[1:40:32] And the Lord said sent sent fiery
[1:40:35] serpents among the people and they did
[1:40:38] they bit the people and much people of
[1:40:42] Israel died. So here they are
[1:40:45] complaining, whining
[1:40:49] because God's gift pulled them out of
[1:40:54] Egypt
[1:40:57] and said, "I'm going to have to sort
[1:40:59] some of y'all out.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to get rid of some of
[1:41:04] this this baggage."
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; God don't like complainers.
[1:41:12] That's right.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; There's there's there's a way that I
[1:41:16] look at things and and maybe I'm crazy,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; but I do my best. And I'm not saying I'm
[1:41:24] by no means am perfect. Obviously, I
[1:41:27] have to look at it for a reason.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; What good is complaining doing?
[1:41:37] I know
[1:41:40] as somebody who works with customers
[1:41:49] that the first time they complain,
[1:41:52] I'm like, "Okay,
[1:41:54] let me look into that."
[1:41:58] the second time they complain.
[1:42:01] Okay.
[1:42:03] But if they are consistent complainers,
[1:42:09] I had a lady tell me, "None of this
[1:42:11] equipment works." And I'm like, "Well,
[1:42:14] how are you doing surgeries?"
[1:42:20] So when she calls, I'm like, "Here we
[1:42:23] go."
[1:42:27] After a while, you're complaining does
[1:42:28] no good.
[1:42:30] Now, there's a difference between
[1:42:32] complaining
[1:42:34] and requesting.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Complaints get blown way out of
[1:42:42] proportion. 99% of the time, they just
[1:42:45] get blown way out of comp proportion. Is
[1:42:49] way more than what it is.
[1:42:56] But requesting, they say, "I need this.
[1:43:00] Can you help me?" Oh,
[1:43:03] why certainly? Let me bend over
[1:43:05] backwards for you.
[1:43:08] Because complaining just annoys.
[1:43:12] And I got a little God in me. And if it
[1:43:14] annoys me, probably annoys him, too.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Complaining does no good, right? So I
[1:43:23] put that in the negative category.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Worrying.
[1:43:30] When has worrying any ever accomplished
[1:43:34] anything?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I take it back. Brother Bram says it
[1:43:40] accomplishes cancer.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; sorry.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Forgot about that one.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; It does you no good to worry. Right.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; God wants us to pull back
[1:43:57] and let go.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Worrying doesn't accomplish anything.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; So that goes in the negative category.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Do you understand where this is going?
[1:44:10] Fighting, arguing, yelling. Oh, those
[1:44:13] are that's that's me.
[1:44:16] [sighs]
[1:44:20] That's another sermon.
[1:44:24] But it goes in the negative category. It
[1:44:26] doesn't accomplish much.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; When was the last time you argued with
[1:44:32] somebody and changed their mind?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, you changed it from upset to angry.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; That's all you accomplish. Right.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And arguing is a sign of pride.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; That goes in the negative category, too.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Again, we got to get away from that that
[1:45:01] part. I ain't got time.
[1:45:06] And the Lord sent fiery servants among
[1:45:08] the people,
[1:45:10] and they bit the people, and much people
[1:45:13] of Israel died.
[1:45:15] So here, this is what they've
[1:45:17] accomplished. They've irritated God
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; and he sent serpents among them.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; What was God's solution?
[1:45:29] Moses,
[1:45:30] form a hunting party.
[1:45:35] I want you to get a bunch of spears and
[1:45:37] we're going to go out and we're just
[1:45:38] going to kill these serpents.
[1:45:42] Nope.
[1:45:44] That's not what he chose to use.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee
[1:45:59] a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole,
[1:46:04] and it shall come to pass that everyone
[1:46:05] that is bitten, when he lookth upon it,
[1:46:08] shall live.
[1:46:13] H
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; would you say that that fiery serpent on
[1:46:19] a pole
[1:46:21] was a gift?
[1:46:25] I would say it was a gift.
[1:46:30] An inadimate object.
[1:46:34] What happened to that serpent years ago
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; or years later?
[1:46:40] They had to destroy it because they made
[1:46:42] it an idol. That's
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; But in its season,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; It was God's way of delivering.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; That was a gift of God, an inanimate
[1:46:56] object that at one time was very
[1:46:59] relevant and very useful. And God said,
[1:47:02] "This is how I'm going to deliver you
[1:47:04] from these fiery serpents.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:47:15] oh Lord, you're going to get me in
[1:47:16] trouble. Sure as the world.
[1:47:26] Brother Brandham
[1:47:28] was not an inadimate object. I'm not
[1:47:31] saying that at all.
[1:47:35] But I want you to understand
[1:47:38] that he was used and his ministry was
[1:47:40] used.
[1:47:42] You guys are tight right now.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; But look at what has happened
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; with brother Brandham
[1:47:58] with the wrong people.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Why is that?
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Why is that?
[1:48:09] God's gift to the people. William Brham
[1:48:14] was used
[1:48:16] and it it to to those of us that have it
[1:48:19] in the right place is still used.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; His ministry.
[1:48:28] We're not counting on brother Brandham
[1:48:31] to show up
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; for that gift.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; There are people that do.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Now, how crazy is that?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; You might as well pull out the brass
[1:48:43] serpent.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:48:48] So that gift, what God has called and
[1:48:51] used and and it's it can be so twisted
[1:48:54] and warped and the devil wants to take
[1:48:56] something pure and holy and good. That
[1:48:59] gift that God put on the earth, he wants
[1:49:02] to to take it and twist it out of
[1:49:04] context and put you in sin. Right.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; The brass serpent had to be destroyed
[1:49:10] because they took something that God
[1:49:12] used,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; a gift of God to heal the people,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; And they started worshiping it.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Does it lessen the gift? No. It was of
[1:49:29] God.
[1:49:37] Now understand that you can do that to
[1:49:39] any gift of God. The devil would love
[1:49:42] That's right.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; to take a true gift of God cuz what does
[1:49:46] that do?
[1:49:52] What does it do when he takes something
[1:49:54] a gift that God has given us
[1:50:00] and he could twist it around and make it
[1:50:03] an idol or twist it around and make it
[1:50:05] something that it's not supposed to be?
[1:50:06] If the devil can do that, then what does
[1:50:09] it do when people look in on it?
[1:50:13] They call us crazy.
[1:50:23] Do we see where we're at in this in in
[1:50:25] in amongst the message? Not in the
[1:50:28] message. The not in the message.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; But many of our are the people that we
[1:50:36] fellowship for years.
[1:50:38] That's right.
[1:50:43] They've taken that gift of brother
[1:50:47] Brandham who we love and respect and we
[1:50:51] keep him in his place. Now
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; you can do that to brother Donnie
[1:50:57] Reagan.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; I talked to
[1:51:18] Okay.
[1:51:29] The green one. Okay.
[1:51:32] So, the devil wants to do that with with
[1:51:34] each one of us as well. The gift inside
[1:51:37] of us.
[1:51:41] Now, this is where it's going to I'm
[1:51:42] going to stop because we got school, but
[1:51:45] this is where I could go
[1:51:48] way off.
[1:51:51] Not off the word, but on another whole
[1:51:54] sermon is what I'm saying, part two.
[1:52:00] Daddies,
[1:52:02] to be a gift,
[1:52:04] you you've been called to be a dad. If
[1:52:07] you're a dad,
[1:52:09] you've been called to be a mom. If
[1:52:11] you're a mom, you've been called to be a
[1:52:12] son. If you're a son, if you got the
[1:52:14] Holy Ghost, that gift inside of you is
[1:52:16] going to manifest those things.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; But that office can be contorted and
[1:52:29] twisted.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Whatever office that you're in,
[1:52:38] And it can become a stumbling block.
[1:52:42] How many children do we know that are
[1:52:45] messed up because of their daddy
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; or their mommy?
[1:52:55] That's a godly office. That's the right
[1:52:57] thing.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; They're in that place. Maybe that's what
[1:52:59] God that's the gift they that that God
[1:53:02] put inside that box.
[1:53:04] You are to be a mommy.
[1:53:07] A godly mommy.
[1:53:14] Okay, I got to stop. I'm just going to
[1:53:16] stop.
[1:53:21] Brothers and sisters, let's make sure
[1:53:24] brothers come because
[1:53:29] let's make sure
[1:53:33] that were this kind of gift.
[1:53:37] I've said it before, my biggest regrets
[1:53:44] are when I
[1:53:47] try and fix things.
[1:53:49] When I try and do it,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; when I run out ahead of God. Oh my.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; We're coming to the place, brothers and
[1:54:00] sisters, where God wants us
[1:54:03] to pull ourselves back
[1:54:07] and just let it go.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; How do you think the rapture is going to
[1:54:12] happen?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; You going to work it up? You going to
[1:54:19] make the h the rapture happen?
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I wish you would hurry up.
[1:54:29] What's going to make that rapture
[1:54:30] happen?
[1:54:33] The Holy Ghost inside of each one of us.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; That gift that God put inside this box
[1:54:39] is going to make it. That's what's going
[1:54:40] to change our bodies.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to make it happen.
[1:54:51] I got a quote here, brother Brandon, and
[1:54:53] I know you've heard it, but he says,
[1:54:56] "When you get off the word
[1:55:01] and you break his law and you break his
[1:55:04] word, you got to shift for yourself."
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; You got to shift. You got to do it
[1:55:10] yourself.
[1:55:12] The Holy Ghost goes off.
[1:55:20] How many of you don't raise your hand?
[1:55:23] Please don't raise your hand.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Think you're better at God than being
[1:55:29] God than God is?
[1:55:32] Brother, no. Brother Harry, I mean, the
[1:55:36] gift you got is is awesome.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; You mean
[1:55:42] you don't think you could take God's
[1:55:44] place? No, sir.
[1:55:48] Maybe you could make the rapture happen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; I wish I could.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; I know. I know. He wishes he could. I
[1:55:54] wish I could. We just make it happen,
[1:55:56] right?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; You know how we make it happen?
[1:56:00] Pull back and let go.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Trust him.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Trust him. I don't care what you're
[1:56:10] going through.
[1:56:14] I don't care how hard life gets. I don't
[1:56:17] care how what your nature is. If if
[1:56:20] you're a worrier,
[1:56:26] the gift inside of you,
[1:56:29] the gift inside of me
[1:56:32] is longing to go home.
[1:56:37] How are we going to go home?
[1:56:41] pulling back
[1:56:43] and letting go.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought right up
[1:56:53] here.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Doubt,
[1:56:56] fear, right up here.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost can't operate in
[1:57:04] those conditions.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; He won't operate in those conditions.
[1:57:19] Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:57:26] Heavenly Father,
[1:57:31] Lord, we
[1:57:33] we truly truly love you, Lord.
[1:57:38] And we thank you, Father, for
[1:57:41] your word and this truth that you've
[1:57:43] given us.
[1:57:45] We thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:57:52] Lord, sometimes
[1:57:54] it doesn't come out like we think. Lord,
[1:57:56] I I probably preached this sermon 500
[1:57:58] times,
[1:58:03] but Lord, truly I I feel like I let go.
[1:58:08] And I'm praying that you would just help
[1:58:10] put this together. Father,
[1:58:17] it wasn't a very fiery sermon or
[1:58:21] something with a lot of
[1:58:23] preaching preaching, Lord. But
[1:58:28] I just trust you and I believe you,
[1:58:29] Lord. Pray that you would have your way,
[1:58:32] Lord Jesus. Maybe this will be something
[1:58:34] that they they can ruminate on the next
[1:58:37] couple days, Lord, and it'll hit them.
[1:58:40] [snorts]
[1:58:43] Father, I truly
[1:58:47] my desire
[1:58:50] Lord Jesus is that
[1:58:53] I would be able to let go and let God.
[1:58:58] I pray that you would help each and
[1:59:00] every one here.
[1:59:03] May these things become manifest in our
[1:59:05] lives. Lord,
[1:59:09] we love you and we thank you. Father,
[1:59:14] I pray you just be with each one. Jesus
[1:59:16] name.
[1:59:18] We saying I surrender all. How many
[1:59:22] wants to surrender?
[1:59:24] Say that Lord, this gift that you put
[1:59:27] inside of me, this Holy Ghost gift that
[1:59:30] you placed inside of me,
[1:59:34] I'm pulling my flesh back
[1:59:38] and I'm letting you
[1:59:41] drive this thing.
[1:59:44] You're going to drive me right
[1:59:47] into the rapture.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; I'm letting go and letting God
[1:59:56] Oh, all to Jesus
[2:00:00] I surrender
[2:00:04] all
[2:00:06] to thee. I freely
[2:00:11] give.
[2:00:13] Oh, I
[2:00:15] will ever
[2:00:18] love
