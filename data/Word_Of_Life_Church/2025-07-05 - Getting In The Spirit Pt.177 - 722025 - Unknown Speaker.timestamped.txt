[27:16] And when it's gone, I know you're not.
[27:21] You're my hope and stay.
[27:25] And when the sea is raging,
[27:29] your spirit is my help.
[27:33] He'll fix my eyes on Jesus Christ. I'll
[27:38] say that it is well.
[27:41] Oh, I know that it is well.
[27:47] I'm fighting a battle
[27:51] that you've already won.
[27:56] No matter what comes my way,
[28:00] I will overcome.
[28:04] I don't know what you're doing,
[28:08] but I know what you done.
[28:12] I'm fighting a battle.
[28:16] You've already won.
[28:22] I know how this story ends.
[28:28] We will be with you again.
[28:33] You're my savior, my defense.
[28:38] No more fear in life or death.
[28:44] I know how this story ends. is we will
[28:50] be with you again.
[28:54] You're my savior, mighty things.
[29:00] No more fear in life or death.
[29:05] I know how this story ends.
[29:10] [Music]
[29:11] I'm fighting a battle.
[29:15] You've already won.
[29:20] No matter what comes my way,
[29:25] I will.
[29:28] I don't know what you do,
[29:32] but I know what you done.
[29:37] I'm fighting a battle.
[29:40] You already won.
[29:46] I'm fighting a battle
[29:49] you've already won.
[29:54] [Music]
[30:01] [Applause]
[30:10] Amen. You enjoy those songs tonight.
[30:12] Praise the Lord. Let's all stand.
[30:16] pastor gets ready to come bring us the
[30:18] word of the Lord tonight. Let's just
[30:19] sing that little course together. Some
[30:22] call it heaven, I call it home. See if
[30:25] you can find that for us, brethren.
[30:29] [Music]
[30:30] Some call it heaven.
[30:34] [Music]
[30:37] Oh, but I call it home.
[30:45] Some call it dreaming.
[30:50] Oh, just let me dream on.
[30:58] Oh, some call it paradise
[31:06] somewhere beyond
[31:09] the sky.
[31:13] Oh, some call it heaven.
[31:20] Oh, but I call it home. One more time
[31:24] with all your heart.
[31:27] Oh, some call it heaven.
[31:34] Oh, but I call it home.
[31:42] Some call it dreaming.
[31:48] Just let me dream on.
[31:56] And some call it paradise.
[32:03] Oh, somewhere
[32:06] beyond the sky.
[32:09] Oh, some call it heaven.
[32:14] [Music]
[32:17] Yes, I call it home.
[32:25] Somewhere beyond
[32:28] the grave,
[32:32] there is
[32:34] a land
[32:38] where Jesus
[32:40] went to prepare
[32:46] by his own hand.
[32:53] and for the save
[32:56] by grace.
[32:57] [Music]
[32:59] Oh, there is a resting
[33:03] place
[33:07] and in a few more days
[33:13] I'll call in my
[33:21] call.
[33:24] [Music]
[33:30] I call it
[33:34] some call it dreaming.
[33:40] Oh then let me dream on and on and on.
[33:46] glory.
[33:48] Some call it paradise.
[33:52] [Music]
[33:55] And it's somewhere beyond
[33:58] the skies.
[34:02] Some call it heaven.
[34:08] Oh, but I call it home.
[34:13] That last line again. And some call it
[34:18] heaven.
[34:21] Aren't you glad you called it home?
[34:30] Oh, praise the Lord.
[34:34] Praise the Lord.
[34:36] Hallelujah.
[34:38] Well, that's what we're trying our best
[34:40] to be prepared for is for that great
[34:43] place. We believe he's gone to prepare
[34:45] for us.
[34:48] I can imagine as they sat there,
[34:52] Judas had got up and walked out.
[34:57] And Jesus begins to speak to the 11
[35:01] in an intimate way that he had never
[35:03] spoken before.
[35:05] And he goes to tell them about leaving
[35:07] and departing and the comforter and so
[35:11] many things. and he can look at them and
[35:13] he can see they are tore to pieces.
[35:18] So he tells them these famous words,
[35:22] "Let not your heart be troubled. You
[35:26] believe in God, believe also in me, for
[35:30] in my father's house are many mansions.
[35:34] And if it were not so, I would have told
[35:37] you. I go away to prepare a place for
[35:40] you. And if I go away, I will come again
[35:44] and receive you unto myself, that where
[35:47] I am, there you may be also. Now, can
[35:51] you imagine if that would have been you
[35:53] sitting there and Jesus is telling you,
[35:55] I'm going to go away. And the prophet
[35:58] tells us he did not want to leave his
[36:01] brothers.
[36:02] He did not want to leave. He wanted to
[36:05] stay. But he said, "It's expedient for
[36:07] you that I go away because if I do not
[36:10] go away, the comforter shall not come."
[36:14] Oh, I'm so glad that he did.
[36:17] But we have the promise tonight, church.
[36:19] He's coming back.
[36:20] Amen.
[36:20] How many believes it? Are you living for
[36:23] his coming?
[36:23] Yes.
[36:25] Are you living for it?
[36:27] Do you love his appearing?
[36:31] That's the only ones that's going in the
[36:32] rapture. those who love his appearing.
[36:38] You see, it's not that you're just going
[36:40] to love that one-time event,
[36:42] but you love his appearing every time he
[36:45] appears.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:46] So, if he appears right here tonight,
[36:48] are you going to love that?
[36:51] A lot of us are picky though. You see,
[36:53] we like certain appearings better than
[36:55] others. Oh my. I just want to love his
[36:58] appearing no matter how he shows up.
[37:01] God bless you. Isn't it a privilege for
[37:03] us to be gathered together tonight?
[37:06] Let's read if you would Genesis chapter
[37:08] 24 verse 21.
[37:11] I know you already know it, but just as
[37:13] a reminder, our meeting will begin
[37:16] Friday night.
[37:18] Brother Matt Watkins will be opening up
[37:19] the services for us. Brother Daryl will
[37:22] be preaching on Saturday night. The
[37:23] service will begin at 6 o'clock. We'll
[37:25] be having prayer line for all the needs
[37:27] of the people. And then Sunday, Brother
[37:30] David Siler will be taking that. So, we
[37:33] want to just come expecting the Lord to
[37:35] move in a great way. Remember, a lot of
[37:38] these services are determined not by the
[37:41] preacher,
[37:42] but it's determined by you.
[37:45] So, what you come expecting and if you
[37:47] come with low expectation, you can
[37:49] pretty much figure you'll probably get
[37:51] low yield out of the service.
[37:53] But if we come under great anticipation,
[37:56] there ain't no telling what our God will
[37:57] do.
[37:59] So, that's the way we want to come.
[38:02] Now, let's read of something that means
[38:04] so much to us as as word believers in
[38:07] this last day since we believe that
[38:10] we've had another appearing of this um
[38:14] event right here in Genesis 24:21.
[38:18] And I remember the prophet was reading
[38:21] and praying and talking to the Lord one
[38:23] day and he said, 'Lord, if there's been
[38:26] anyone in the scripture that would have
[38:28] been like my ministry would be like or
[38:32] something that would speak to me, would
[38:36] you would you just show it to me?
[38:39] So he takes his Bible and his Bible
[38:42] falls open. Genesis 24,
[38:48] the model servant Eleazar,
[38:51] which was a gentile.
[38:55] Amen.
[38:56] A gentile sent to call a bride for
[38:59] Isaac.
[39:01] And the man wondering at her held his
[39:03] peace to wit whether the Lord had made
[39:06] his journey prosperous or not. And it
[39:11] came to pass as the camels
[39:14] as the camels had done drinking, now
[39:18] remember approximately 60 trips
[39:23] up and down the spiral staircase to the
[39:27] well to get water. So he didn't tell her
[39:30] what she was going to get. He's judging
[39:32] her character to see is she the right
[39:36] type of bride for Isaac. I'm sure
[39:39] hopefully by now we understand the
[39:42] people that'll leave this world in a
[39:44] rapture must match the Lord Jesus.
[39:48] So there'll be no liars allowed.
[39:51] There'll be no hypocrites. There'll be
[39:54] no people allowed which when they have
[39:57] been proven to be wrong, done wrong, or
[40:01] acted wrong, none of them will go if
[40:05] they can't make their wrongs right. That
[40:08] includes preachers. Remember the prophet
[40:10] tells us the zeal of this hour is to
[40:13] repent. But I'm telling you, you take it
[40:16] for what it's worth. We're living in a
[40:18] time when message people are getting so
[40:20] hard-headed and so stubborn. You can
[40:24] show them by the scripture and by the
[40:26] message where they have done wrong,
[40:29] acted wrong, or said wrong, and they
[40:32] will not make it right. This is part of
[40:34] the dividing line between the foolish
[40:37] virgins and our ranks and those who make
[40:40] the bride. If you've got the Holy Ghost
[40:43] and the Holy Ghost always says amen to
[40:46] the word. You remember when brother
[40:47] Renham was talking about the gifts and
[40:50] he told brother Neville, he said we
[40:52] can't judge them now because they're
[40:53] babies. So it was babies when they up on
[40:56] the floor.
[40:57] Okay?
[40:58] And they couldn't be judged cuz they
[41:00] were babies. Now that's his words.
[41:02] That's not mine. they were babies. So
[41:04] then it come to a time to where that he
[41:06] said they got to be judged. Well, when
[41:07] they did that, then a bunch of the
[41:09] people pulled away and left. And then he
[41:12] goes to saying that some of the things
[41:13] that prophesied never did come to pass.
[41:16] And he said it wasn't even right to
[41:19] begin with. That's right.
[41:20] But he had to let it go to prove and
[41:23] manifest. So instead of them people
[41:25] receiving correction because they said
[41:27] the Lord says this and the Lord said
[41:29] that and the Lord said that and the Lord
[41:31] said that and it wasn't the Lord to
[41:32] begin with. So instead of them saying
[41:35] you know what I said something wrong,
[41:38] I said it wrong.
[41:40] Instead of being able to just admit it
[41:42] and apologize,
[41:44] they left.
[41:46] They left. Why? Lack of the Holy Ghost.
[41:50] Oh my.
[41:52] Hallelujah.
[41:55] Well, I guess we might as well
[41:56] dismissed. I've done kill the service,
[41:57] ain't it?
[41:59] This is part of the zeal, friends. And
[42:02] this includes preachers. Preachers.
[42:06] Now watch. He's testing her, checking
[42:10] her. And it came to pass as the camels
[42:13] had done drinking that the man took a
[42:15] golden earring of half a shekele weight
[42:19] and two bracelets for her hands and t of
[42:22] 10 shekels weight of gold. Now let's
[42:26] skip down to verse 26.
[42:28] Now when she responds then he responds.
[42:32] Notice after he initiates the message to
[42:36] her she allowed him to touch her on the
[42:40] hands. Now that's common place now, but
[42:43] it would not have been accepted then. He
[42:45] allowed her to touch her face, which
[42:49] would not have been allowed unless
[42:53] he was bringing an engagement proposal.
[42:58] So she allowed him to touch her hands
[43:00] and allowed him to touch her face. Then
[43:04] when she responds, look at his response.
[43:07] And the man bowed down his head and
[43:11] worshiped the Lord.
[43:15] Praise God. Let us bow our heads. What
[43:18] do you say? How many like to be
[43:20] remembered tonight as we pray?
[43:24] Father, we are taught by your prophet
[43:27] and I heard this statement years and
[43:29] years ago and it's always meant so much
[43:32] to me.
[43:34] something like this when he said, "One
[43:37] of the greatest privileges that a mortal
[43:39] has when they can bow their head, close
[43:42] their eyes and call on Father God."
[43:47] So tonight, Lord Jesus, we bow our heads
[43:50] to the dust of the earth. We close our
[43:54] eyes because we don't want to be
[43:55] distracted and we're not looking around
[43:58] to one another.
[44:00] And then we pray.
[44:02] It's in humility. And we know that the
[44:04] bowing of the head is humility. Josephus
[44:08] and some of the writers said that
[44:11] whenever Eleesar
[44:13] actually bowed his head, it was twofold.
[44:17] He was bowing his head to the new queen
[44:21] of Abraham's inheritance.
[44:25] And he prostrated himself on the ground.
[44:29] actually fell and buried his face in the
[44:34] dust of the earth and worshiped not
[44:37] Rebecca but Jehovah God. So, Father, we
[44:42] here tonight bow our heads, close our
[44:44] eyes, and we open our hearts to your
[44:48] word tonight, Lord. Would you take your
[44:51] great great word tonight and search us?
[44:56] Begin with me, Lord. Search me, Father.
[45:00] See if you see anything in me that
[45:03] displeases you, Lord. Do I have
[45:07] anything, any goals, any motives, any
[45:11] objectives,
[45:12] anything in my life, my spirit, my
[45:16] makeup, Lord, that's not like you.
[45:21] Reveal it to me tonight, Father, and I
[45:24] will make it right.
[45:26] If there's one person on the face of the
[45:30] earth that I have done wrong to that I
[45:34] need to make amends,
[45:36] show me this very hour and I will make
[45:40] it right before the breaking of another
[45:43] day. Lord, if there's anything about
[45:46] your word that you've showed me that
[45:50] I've not obeyed you, no matter how big
[45:54] or how small,
[45:56] show me I'll make it right. If I've been
[46:00] a stumbling block in any way to any of
[46:03] your children where I've preached around
[46:05] the world, if I've preached anything
[46:09] wrong doctrally or attitude, whatever,
[46:13] Lord, you show me. I'll make it right.
[46:16] I'll come right here. If I've done
[46:19] wrong, behave wrong in a man's church,
[46:22] I'll go to anywhere I need to go.
[46:25] Because father, one day life will leave
[46:28] this mortal body of mine and I want to
[46:31] stand before you. And I want to make
[46:34] sure everything is perfectly right.
[46:39] Would you take your word tonight, Lord,
[46:42] and speak to us? Give us an open heart
[46:44] that we can receive. And Lord, we
[46:47] mention to you as we already have been,
[46:49] Lord, with our meetings coming up this
[46:51] week. And Lord, I I know they probably
[46:54] get tired of hearing me say it, but I
[46:56] just can't thank you enough, Lord, that
[46:58] we've got a building now where we can
[47:00] have special meetings in. It just means
[47:03] so much to me as the pastor, and I know
[47:05] it does to the saints, Father, that we
[47:08] can have special meetings like we're
[47:10] going to have this week. And we're
[47:11] looking for a great time in your
[47:14] presence. Anoint us tonight, Father, and
[47:17] help us to receive. Grant it we pray in
[47:20] the name of Jesus. And Rebecca said,
[47:24] "Amen."
[47:25] God bless you, Rebecca.
[47:28] You may be seated.
[47:35] So Elear delivers
[47:38] several gifts.
[47:40] He's got the Mohar, which is the bride
[47:44] press. He has the matan,
[47:49] which is the gifts from the groom to the
[47:53] bride.
[47:55] And then he has just little uh can I
[47:59] call them Pentecostal gifts that'll be
[48:03] shared with the family of the bride and
[48:08] they'll be benefited by his visit to
[48:12] their vicinity and to their region where
[48:15] they live. They'll not be the bride
[48:18] because they're not part of the elect
[48:20] move of God, but they will be benefited
[48:24] by his visit. Now, keep that in mind
[48:27] because that's a great answer to the
[48:29] churches, many of them in this last day.
[48:32] The messenger of Genesis 24 was sent to
[48:38] many people as it were those that Laban
[48:42] would benefit by his visit, her mother
[48:45] would benefit. You notice her father is
[48:48] not even mentioned at all. So either he
[48:51] was incompetent by this state or he was
[48:53] unable to be uh in charge of the matters
[48:57] and Laban was doing all of that or he
[49:00] had already passed. the scripture
[49:01] doesn't really say. And then also there
[49:05] would be other young women that would go
[49:08] back with Rebecca on this camel train as
[49:13] well as Rebecca's nurse.
[49:18] So whenever Eleazar comes, he comes with
[49:22] a multiaceted
[49:24] load of gifts. So he must have had
[49:26] several camels. He had to bring food for
[49:30] several week journey coming and going
[49:34] and they would carry water and they
[49:36] would carry their tents by which they
[49:39] would sleep. And then he had these gifts
[49:42] that he wanted to bring and deposit each
[49:45] gift according to your category of whom
[49:49] you were. The matan was the personal
[49:53] gifts from the bridegroom to the bride.
[49:57] The mother could not get those gifts,
[50:01] nor could the not included in the bride
[50:04] price, the mahar, but those gifts were
[50:08] specifically marked for the bride. Now,
[50:11] there was some of them that they could
[50:13] all benefit by. I hope you understand
[50:16] that God by election he can send one man
[50:21] one messenger in an age and the
[50:25] denominations will be blessed by his
[50:29] visit. The foolish virgins can be
[50:32] blessed by his visit and the elect can
[50:37] be blessed by his visit. all of them in
[50:40] a different way and they can all bear
[50:43] testimony and say, "Well, you know, I I
[50:46] I was blessed. I got healed or I got
[50:49] this or I got that." But Rebecca got
[50:52] something that none of the rest of them
[50:55] got. Now, it was personal gifts, not
[50:58] required, but most of the time always
[51:01] rendered from the bridegroom himself to
[51:05] the bride. Now, this would seem somewhat
[51:08] a little bit unusual since Isaac did not
[51:12] know what type of woman he was going to
[51:15] marry. Now, those of you brothers that
[51:17] are married and you brothers that are
[51:19] just courting a girl and say her
[51:22] birthday is coming up or some special
[51:24] event and you'd like to get her a
[51:27] certain gift. And if you don't really
[51:29] know her that well or you're not sure as
[51:32] to what she would like, then you might
[51:34] ask her close friends. Look, I I want to
[51:37] get her something for her birthday. I
[51:39] want to get her something for this or
[51:41] that. Can you tell me what she liked? Or
[51:43] maybe she's got a brother. or you ask
[51:45] her mother or her father or her close
[51:47] friend at the church, oh yeah, she's
[51:49] been telling me she wants this certain
[51:51] music CD or she wants this or that or
[51:54] the other. She really likes this certain
[51:55] perfume. But here, when Isaac sends this
[51:59] special gift, which could have been made
[52:02] up of many different things. Part of it
[52:04] could be something old and it could be
[52:07] something new. It could be something
[52:10] made up of the heritage of the family.
[52:13] Now to the bride as an individual, she
[52:16] might not know exactly what it even
[52:18] means because she would look at it and
[52:21] she wouldn't know what it was. But you
[52:23] see that within itself required the
[52:26] messenger to explain to her. Now this is
[52:30] something specific from the bridegroom
[52:33] to you. This was a gift which had great
[52:37] value to him. It is something that his
[52:40] mother gave him. So it would require
[52:44] further explanation from the bridegroom.
[52:47] So the bride would be able to get a
[52:49] clear understanding. But that wasn't the
[52:51] type of gift that would have been given
[52:53] in the bride press. And you can pretty
[52:56] well figure by the time of Laban was
[52:58] Laban was the sentimental type. He was a
[53:01] dollar sign type. So he wouldn't really
[53:04] wanted anything that needed a lot of
[53:06] explanation for. He would have just
[53:08] rather had the chatter and the clang of
[53:10] coins or the crispy sound of bills,
[53:13] something that he could relate to
[53:16] because Laban understood the language of
[53:19] money and he understood it very well.
[53:23] But you see, Rebecca would have been a
[53:25] different type of person. So in Ezer's
[53:30] subliminal messages given to her
[53:33] believing that the angel of God had went
[53:35] before him and that he had prayed and
[53:38] asked father to bless his reward and to
[53:41] help him pick a bride for Isaac. that he
[53:44] believed that God would have a woman
[53:47] prepared that her own needs and desires
[53:51] and makeup would actually answer to the
[53:55] matan of the gifts that her husband had
[53:59] sent. So had she rejected these gifts,
[54:03] then he would have known she's not the
[54:06] bride type. If she would have refused to
[54:09] have served and brought water to the
[54:12] camels, he would have knew right off
[54:15] she's not the bride type. She would
[54:17] never match the type of a man he was. So
[54:21] if she wanted everything just brought
[54:24] out to her on a silver platter. She
[54:27] never had to pray. She never had to
[54:29] read. She never had to go to church. She
[54:31] never done anything at all. You know,
[54:33] but she just wanted Jesus to wait on her
[54:35] hand and foot. He would have known right
[54:37] there she was not one to be called to be
[54:41] the bride
[54:42] and the church said
[54:44] well now watch. So then he is going to
[54:47] also make up the gifts that will
[54:51] complement the type of nature that she
[54:54] is and it will also help her in her
[54:57] journey back home. Now remember in the
[55:00] gifts it's like the gifts could be a
[55:03] reflection of the personage of the
[55:06] bridegroom. So she would learn more
[55:10] about the bridegroom by watching and
[55:13] looking at the gifts that he sent to her
[55:17] and it would help her to understand him
[55:20] better. So she would look at them gifts
[55:22] and she'd be able to to read through the
[55:25] gifts also. I I can see what type of a
[55:28] man this Isaac is. Remember, she's going
[55:30] to marry a man that she's never met
[55:33] before. No, no pictures, no texts, no
[55:36] emails, you know, nothing like that at
[55:38] all. There was no nothing at all. Only
[55:41] the only thing she knew about him was
[55:43] the way this messenger had projected
[55:45] him. So, totally depending on how he
[55:49] projected him would also determine
[55:51] whether she would say yes or no. So how
[55:55] he represented him and I can tell you by
[55:59] the way a lot of modern preachers
[56:01] represent Jesus I would not want to
[56:03] marry him
[56:05] cuz the way they represent him he's a
[56:07] compromiser.
[56:09] You can live any way you want to live
[56:10] and do what you want to do and when
[56:12] everybody dies all wind up going to
[56:14] heaven anyhow. That ain't my Jesus.
[56:17] I said that ain't my Jesus. Heaven would
[56:20] be turned into hell in about 5 minutes
[56:22] after all them people got there. Come
[56:24] on, somebody.
[56:26] You see, this is one thing that made me
[56:28] so fall in love with the messenger and
[56:31] the message in the last day. I've told
[56:34] you before, but I'll share it with you
[56:35] again. I had already seen all kinds of
[56:39] miracles in Pentecost. I saw in my own
[56:43] ministry from a young boy preacher. I
[56:46] saw all kinds of supernatural. I saw
[56:50] cross eyes straightened out. I saw
[56:52] cancers heal. I saw people as I've told
[56:55] you before about the man in Harlem,
[56:57] Kentucky whenever I was there and he his
[56:59] sister come to church and the man had a
[57:01] few hours to live. Had cancer in the
[57:03] brain. It had eat his brain. He was out
[57:05] of his mind. He pumped through his skull
[57:07] and his head was soft like a
[57:09] marshmallow. His sister come in the
[57:11] prayer line took my handkerchief from
[57:13] the prayer line. went to the hospital
[57:15] two and a half miles away from where we
[57:17] had the tent put up. She put it on him
[57:20] and in the next morning that man walked
[57:22] out of the hospital with a brand new
[57:25] brain and a brand new skull,
[57:27] an absolute walking miracle. That was
[57:29] not when I was preaching the message.
[57:32] That when I was preaching the message of
[57:33] Pentecost, so it was not the signs and
[57:37] the wonders of the message that got my
[57:39] attention. I'd already seen them. I was
[57:42] visiting a tent service one night and a
[57:44] baby died in the service and I saw this
[57:47] preacher which become a personal friend
[57:49] of mine. I saw this preacher take this
[57:52] dead baby inside of his little camper
[57:55] which had had a school bus there and he
[57:58] made a camper out of it that he would
[57:59] stay in. I saw him go inside that camper
[58:03] and he took that dead form of that baby
[58:05] that stood out there and prayed for it
[58:07] and prayed for it and prayed for it. No
[58:09] movement, no breathing, no twitching, no
[58:12] nothing. He took that dead corpse inside
[58:16] of that school bus. And I watched him in
[58:20] there. And now we stood out there, of
[58:21] course, and prayed and prayed and
[58:23] prayed. Just kind of my first
[58:24] introduction to the man. And in about an
[58:27] hour or so later, I saw that man come
[58:31] out of that school bus with that baby
[58:34] squalling and kicking and crying. I saw
[58:37] its mama go shouting and screaming and
[58:40] dancing. I saw its daddy go running
[58:43] toward him. So, you see, I'd already
[58:45] seen the dead raised. I'd already seen
[58:49] people that had all kinds of issues
[58:51] healed. I was searching for something
[58:55] more than miracles. Now, let me just
[58:57] tell you, I believed in miracles when I
[59:00] was in Pentecost, and I have not stopped
[59:02] believing in them now. As a matter of
[59:05] fact, we still need them now. If we ever
[59:06] needed them in our entire lives,
[59:09] but it was not the miracles. I know for
[59:11] many people in the message, they never
[59:13] saw them. And I told Carol years ago, I
[59:15] said, "You mark it down. If there ever
[59:18] comes a Pentecostal move in this
[59:22] message, it will be unbelievable how
[59:25] many message people will trade out the
[59:27] teachings of the message and swallow
[59:30] down a Pentecostal move." It's happened,
[59:33] brothers and sisters.
[59:35] But it was not that that I was looking
[59:37] for. But when I started listening to
[59:40] tapes and I heard the way he addressed
[59:43] the Lord Jesus, brother D. I heard the
[59:45] way he talked to him and I heard the way
[59:48] he talked about him and I'd never heard
[59:51] a preacher out of all the ones I'd
[59:53] heard, I'd never heard a preacher talk
[59:56] about him the way he did. I never heard
[59:59] a preacher talk to him the way he did.
[1:00:02] And it just made me want to love the
[1:00:05] Lord Jesus the same way that I felt that
[1:00:09] man loved him. Anybody here know what
[1:00:11] I'm talking about. Some of you that had
[1:00:13] a Pentecostal background, you know
[1:00:14] exactly what I'm talking about. Because
[1:00:16] you saw the same things that I saw. And
[1:00:19] it was not more of the same or a repeat
[1:00:23] of Pentecost that I was looking for, but
[1:00:25] it was the sound of the messenger which
[1:00:29] would say something that would help me
[1:00:32] to understand more about the man that I
[1:00:36] was going to marry and become, oh
[1:00:39] hallelujah, the Lord of my life. Now
[1:00:41] remember, I'd been saved for many years
[1:00:44] and I had a baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:00:46] my spirit for years. I'd cast out
[1:00:49] devils. I'd healed the sick. I'd done
[1:00:51] all kinds of signs and wonders. And I'm
[1:00:54] going to tell you the honest truth. I
[1:00:56] could not have had the seal of the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost in my soul because I preach things
[1:01:02] and believe things that was contrary to
[1:01:06] the word of God. How could I have been
[1:01:08] born by a new birth, a word verse of
[1:01:11] Malachi 4 when I never even heard
[1:01:14] Malachi 4 preached yet? Well, some of
[1:01:17] y'all might say say amen cuz some of
[1:01:19] y'all was the same shape. Some of y'all
[1:01:21] shouted and jumped and danced and run.
[1:01:23] Brother Mike Wall senior and I was
[1:01:25] talking weeks ago ago whenever I was up
[1:01:28] there with him and he was a drummer and
[1:01:30] his church and Pentecostal and he said
[1:01:32] he'd get to shouting and get to
[1:01:34] glorifying God and take off running.
[1:01:36] He'd go running one way and the
[1:01:38] drumsticks would go running another way.
[1:01:40] and was talking the same thing that it
[1:01:42] wasn't just the shouting and the running
[1:01:45] and the jumping and the miracles, but it
[1:01:47] was something about the message of the
[1:01:50] hour. Now, we believe in that in our
[1:01:53] church. And if you don't, I pray that
[1:01:55] God deals with your heart because where
[1:01:57] our God is, there is always a
[1:02:00] supernatural manifestation.
[1:02:03] Is that right? Now look, so that he is
[1:02:05] going to deliver all these gifts and
[1:02:09] they will vary according to the needs
[1:02:12] and the dispositions of the people. Can
[1:02:14] you imagine? The prophet said that he
[1:02:17] sent several hundred,000 over a million
[1:02:20] actually to the assemblies of God and
[1:02:22] the church of God. His converts, the
[1:02:25] Pentecostal churches exploded after the
[1:02:29] revival that God sent by that visitation
[1:02:32] of that one angel. All them people did
[1:02:35] not wind up believing the message.
[1:02:37] They're not supposed to. They're
[1:02:40] supposed to go to the group in the
[1:02:41] category. Let them stay there. They're
[1:02:44] better off to stay there than they are
[1:02:46] to try to come and follow this if they
[1:02:49] ain't called to do it.
[1:02:51] To be honest with you, some of that's
[1:02:53] been around and left and are better off
[1:02:55] if they'd never come around it in the
[1:02:56] first place.
[1:02:58] Well, come on, somebody.
[1:03:00] But thank God we're called to this. How
[1:03:02] many believes it with all your heart?
[1:03:04] Now watch. Then the Lord Jesus in giving
[1:03:08] us a matan. Now what's the matan going
[1:03:11] to do? The bride's gifts. Then she could
[1:03:14] look at them on her journey back and
[1:03:16] then she might need a little bit of
[1:03:18] explanation. So Eleazar, what is this
[1:03:21] one here? Well, this one here is very
[1:03:23] very special to him. It has something
[1:03:24] special because his mother's you know
[1:03:27] has passed away and and what was his
[1:03:28] mother's name? Oh yeah, Sarah. That
[1:03:30] that's right, Sarah. And then she was
[1:03:32] Sarah. Oh, okay. Explain to me that
[1:03:33] Sarah. Well, she was a Seriite. And and
[1:03:36] then she was barren all of her life. So
[1:03:38] here goes Eleazar. and he's preaching
[1:03:40] the message and Rebecca saying, "Oh my,
[1:03:42] I feel like I know him already. I feel
[1:03:44] like I know him. I I I just feel like by
[1:03:46] by hearing what you've got to say and
[1:03:48] the way that you're expounding and every
[1:03:50] day she'd hear more and more and more
[1:03:53] and just feeding on the personality of
[1:03:56] who he was." You know, I don't imagine
[1:03:57] Elusa saying, "I'm this and I'm that and
[1:04:00] I'm that. I prayed for this and I've
[1:04:02] done that and I've done that and I've
[1:04:03] done that." He wasn't there to get her
[1:04:06] for himself. He was there to talk about
[1:04:09] the one he was sent to represent.
[1:04:13] Now, I want you to notice in our Lord
[1:04:15] Jesus, as we looked at it last Wednesday
[1:04:17] night, and we went through the book of
[1:04:19] Romans, chapter 8, and we got up to
[1:04:21] around verse 23 in there are part I
[1:04:25] believe of the gifts of the matan to the
[1:04:28] bride of things in our journey. Some of
[1:04:30] them of course we know and much of the
[1:04:33] preaching that you and I have received
[1:04:34] in our journey it's not so much things
[1:04:37] that that you will need for you know
[1:04:40] eternity but it's things that you will
[1:04:43] need in time to help you along in your
[1:04:47] journey until time will be swallowed up
[1:04:50] in eternity. Now watch then in this is
[1:04:54] the very thing that God sent for us to
[1:04:57] feed on. Now let's read with me if you
[1:04:59] would. So, let's unravel a little bit of
[1:05:02] the bride's package tonight. Romans
[1:05:05] 8:23.
[1:05:06] This is part of our matan which will
[1:05:09] give us something to look forward to.
[1:05:12] Now, she's going to a land she never
[1:05:14] been before. Probably never been out of
[1:05:16] Haran her whole life and lived there,
[1:05:18] born and raised there. Probably thought
[1:05:19] she'd marry a local sheep herder or a
[1:05:21] local farmer. Never amount to nothing.
[1:05:23] Little did she know by what she had done
[1:05:26] had changed her entire destiny. Little
[1:05:29] did she know she would become a mother
[1:05:32] of millions.
[1:05:36] Well, let me just say it to you this
[1:05:37] way. You might ought to watch every
[1:05:40] little action cuz it could be you're
[1:05:44] being measured for a much bigger role.
[1:05:48] Now, had she known she was going to be
[1:05:51] the mother of millions, I wonder if it
[1:05:54] affected her, brother Daryl, would she
[1:05:56] acted different, done different? But you
[1:05:58] see what he wanted was a woman that was
[1:06:01] acting herself, her true self, her true
[1:06:06] self. Just without reward, without
[1:06:09] telling her exactly any of that stuff,
[1:06:11] just be what she was. And he could get a
[1:06:14] true image of who she was. Oh, let me
[1:06:18] tell you something. A lot of you folks,
[1:06:20] I hear people talking about it so much
[1:06:21] in the day we're living. Oh, these
[1:06:23] people are good people, and these are
[1:06:25] good people, and these are good people.
[1:06:27] Well, let me just tell you something. As
[1:06:29] a pastor, I know people in a way that
[1:06:32] most of you don't know them. As a matter
[1:06:34] of fact, when I send them the word or I
[1:06:36] have to talk to them sometime and see
[1:06:38] their reaction and read their replies, I
[1:06:42] realize they're not quite the people you
[1:06:44] thought they were.
[1:06:45] You see, it's not so much what I say
[1:06:47] about it. It's not so much what you say,
[1:06:50] but it's our reaction to God's word. And
[1:06:52] it would be amazing how many of these
[1:06:54] good people that you all work with if
[1:06:57] you would give them a little insight of
[1:06:59] what you believe about the serpent seed
[1:07:01] and about water baptism in the name of
[1:07:03] the Lord Jesus and how we believe the
[1:07:06] bride is separate from the church and
[1:07:08] only the bride's going to heaven. You
[1:07:09] might find out some of them good little
[1:07:11] people. It's like an old cat when you
[1:07:14] take your hand and rub its hair the
[1:07:16] other way and it
[1:07:20] some of them good people. you would see
[1:07:21] them as they really are and they ain't
[1:07:24] so good after all. As a matter of fact,
[1:07:26] I like to quote what Jesus said. There
[1:07:28] is none good. No, not
[1:07:33] one.
[1:07:34] There ain't no good message people.
[1:07:36] There ain't no good Baptist people. If
[1:07:39] we don't have the blood of Jesus, we're
[1:07:41] all lost.
[1:07:43] We're all lost. There ain't no good
[1:07:44] people in heaven. There's saved people
[1:07:47] in heaven.
[1:07:49] Oh my. Notice the matan by which the
[1:07:53] bridegroom. Oh, I I I thank God for the
[1:07:56] mystery of the body change and why God
[1:07:58] wanted to make it so much more real in
[1:08:00] this age than it's ever been. Our bodies
[1:08:02] will soon be completely redeemed.
[1:08:06] Romans 8:23. Not only they, but
[1:08:09] ourselves also, which have the first
[1:08:11] fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves
[1:08:14] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[1:08:18] adoption to with the redemption of our
[1:08:21] body. Oh, if that ain't an encouragement
[1:08:24] to old people. And I read this whenever
[1:08:26] I was a young preacher. I read it when I
[1:08:28] was in my 30s. I read it and preaching
[1:08:30] when I was in my 40s, my 50s, and my
[1:08:33] early 60s. Now I'm in my late 60s. In
[1:08:36] the next week or so, I'll be turning 69
[1:08:39] by the grace of God. Man, it means more
[1:08:41] to me now than it did when I was a 30
[1:08:43] year old man when I come here years ago.
[1:08:46] And my hair was real dark and I didn't
[1:08:48] have all these Arizona caverns in my
[1:08:50] face. Look like the Grand Canyon walking
[1:08:52] around. Thanks to some of you all.
[1:08:56] And some of you were blackheaded. Well,
[1:08:58] some of you at least had hair then. And
[1:09:00] you wasn't gray and you wasn't all
[1:09:02] drooped over. What in the world has
[1:09:04] happened to us? What are we groaning
[1:09:06] for, friend? More money. We want bigger
[1:09:09] politics. We want a bigger this or a
[1:09:11] better that. We're groaning for a body
[1:09:14] change. And I can tell you right now,
[1:09:17] every Holy Ghost feels saint needs a new
[1:09:21] body. I don't care if you're 15 or 85,
[1:09:24] we've got to have a new body. And there
[1:09:26] must be something about our human makeup
[1:09:29] that will be changed as well. or in
[1:09:32] heaven would still have pouting people
[1:09:35] and would have people that wouldn't
[1:09:36] speak to one another. It ain't just your
[1:09:39] soul that's got to be changed, but
[1:09:41] you've got to have a body that will be
[1:09:44] changed.
[1:09:45] And the church said,
[1:09:48] "Oh, praise God." Notice, so we not only
[1:09:51] have this hope then of of a of of the
[1:09:54] redemption of our body, but we have this
[1:09:57] one singular word. We have hope.
[1:10:00] Amen.
[1:10:02] hope
[1:10:03] in a hopeless time.
[1:10:05] In a hopeless world,
[1:10:07] we have hope. Now, I know some of you
[1:10:09] don't like hope. I thank God for hope.
[1:10:12] I know she's faith's little weaker
[1:10:15] sister, but she is part of the family.
[1:10:20] And I'll tell you one thing, there's
[1:10:21] times that I don't have faith in some
[1:10:23] people, but when I don't have faith in
[1:10:25] them, I found that little sister Hope
[1:10:28] will be right there and help me. Well,
[1:10:30] praise the Lord. Maybe some of y'all
[1:10:31] felt the same way about me. Notice in
[1:10:34] Romans 8:24, "For we are saved
[1:10:39] by
[1:10:44] hope. But hope that is seen is not hope.
[1:10:50] For what a man seeth, why does he yet
[1:10:52] hope for?" And the Lord Jesus give us in
[1:10:56] part of our package of understanding of
[1:10:59] gift life gives us what? Hope.
[1:11:03] Hope.
[1:11:05] If we ever lose our hope, we're in a
[1:11:07] mess.
[1:11:08] Amen.
[1:11:10] That's right.
[1:11:10] Oh, I love this part here. The spirit
[1:11:14] helps.
[1:11:16] Amen. Our weakness
[1:11:19] by praying for us.
[1:11:24] according to the will of God.
[1:11:30] Any y'all ever get to a spot to where
[1:11:32] you don't know how to pray?
[1:11:35] You don't know the words to say.
[1:11:38] The word Paul uses there when he defines
[1:11:42] this is words that cannot be
[1:11:45] articulated.
[1:11:47] Words that cannot be spoken or said.
[1:11:51] Sometimes you groan,
[1:11:54] you moan,
[1:11:56] and other times you break into another
[1:11:58] language
[1:11:59] which is not your native tongue.
[1:12:02] Amen.
[1:12:05] Brother Donnie, don't don't tell me you
[1:12:08] still
[1:12:10] I do.
[1:12:11] Amen.
[1:12:12] You see that look guilty.
[1:12:15] Cuz there's times I don't know what to
[1:12:17] say. There's times I don't know how to
[1:12:19] pray. Yeah,
[1:12:21] but I get alone and I go to praying.
[1:12:25] And believe it or not, I ain't always on
[1:12:28] my knees when it hits me. As a matter of
[1:12:31] fact, I was over here the other day
[1:12:33] praying right out here in the parking
[1:12:35] lot.
[1:12:36] And I broke out into a heavenly
[1:12:38] language, just me and the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:42] I was praying for somebody sitting right
[1:12:44] here tonight that's in a very dangerous
[1:12:47] state.
[1:12:49] And I broke out into a language that I
[1:12:52] have heard before
[1:12:54] in a foreign nation.
[1:12:57] So I just stopped what I was doing and
[1:12:59] give God time cuz sometimes
[1:13:03] I don't know how to pray. I don't know
[1:13:05] what to say. This is in my gift package.
[1:13:11] Hallelujah.
[1:13:12] Amen.
[1:13:13] Notice verse 27. And he that searchth
[1:13:15] the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
[1:13:18] the spirit because he maketh
[1:13:21] intercession for the saints
[1:13:25] according to the will of God.
[1:13:29] According
[1:13:31] to the will of God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] But now notice in this package this is
[1:13:39] not for everyone.
[1:13:42] Will the foolish virgin receive the
[1:13:44] bride package? It's not for her. It
[1:13:47] don't have her name on it. She has her
[1:13:50] own gifts. Salvation, mercy,
[1:13:53] forgiveness, this, the other. But I'm
[1:13:55] talking about bride package.
[1:13:58] The matan.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah. Oh, here's one of our
[1:14:04] favorites. Romans 8:28. God causes all
[1:14:09] things
[1:14:11] to work together for good as we are
[1:14:15] loving him and called according to his
[1:14:16] purpose. How many believes it?
[1:14:18] I'll never forget one time years and
[1:14:20] years ago, Brother Charlie Cox, I'd
[1:14:22] called him and and uh we we you know, we
[1:14:24] lived about 65 miles apart or something
[1:14:26] like that and we was close years and
[1:14:28] years ago before I came here and I
[1:14:31] called, "Hey, brother Charlie, how you
[1:14:32] doing?" He said, 'Well, I'm on the bad
[1:14:35] side of Romans 8:28.' I said, 'Well,
[1:14:38] what do you mean?' He said, 'Well, this
[1:14:39] is going wrong and that's going wrong
[1:14:41] and that's going wrong.' And he said, I
[1:14:43] called it the bad side of Romans 8:28.
[1:14:47] But in reality, even when things happen
[1:14:50] to our life that we don't understand,
[1:14:52] you know it's a truth, is it? Y'all ever
[1:14:54] had things happen to you that you do not
[1:14:57] understand? And you might even in your
[1:14:58] mind say, "Lord, why? Why would this
[1:15:00] happen? Why would that happen?" in
[1:15:02] Romans 8:28 works then just like it
[1:15:05] works when you understand what's going
[1:15:08] on.
[1:15:09] Amen. This is part of who you are, bride
[1:15:13] of Christ. This is part of the package
[1:15:16] with your name on it. Hallelujah. For we
[1:15:19] know all things work together for good
[1:15:22] to them that love God. To them, not just
[1:15:26] them that love God. Don't stop there. to
[1:15:29] them that love God, that to them who are
[1:15:32] the called according to his purpose. You
[1:15:36] see, this verse has categorized for a
[1:15:40] certain category of people. What
[1:15:42] category is it? Those who make up the
[1:15:44] divine purpose of God. You were not
[1:15:47] saved because you chose him. You were
[1:15:50] saved because he chose you.
[1:15:53] Hallelujah. Oh, I wanted him. Oh, no you
[1:15:56] didn't. He wanted you and he gave you
[1:15:58] the desire to want him. After he wanted
[1:16:01] you, he gave you the desire and you're
[1:16:04] called for his purpose.
[1:16:08] Praise be to God.
[1:16:10] We have a glorious purpose. Listen to
[1:16:14] this. To be conformed
[1:16:16] to the image of his son. Verse 29. For
[1:16:20] whom he did forno, he also did
[1:16:24] predestinate
[1:16:26] which means predetermine their destiny
[1:16:31] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:16:35] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:16:40] how many
[1:16:42] many brethren. Praise be to God. This is
[1:16:46] in your package. These are your gifts.
[1:16:49] It ain't no wonder that God's prophet
[1:16:51] preached so much about election and
[1:16:53] predestination and calling. Why would he
[1:16:56] deal with that more than Paul and deal
[1:16:58] with it more than Luther and Wesley and
[1:17:00] Ox and Calvin and all of them. And look,
[1:17:02] even Calvinism and the way that they
[1:17:04] dealt with it, none of them could touch
[1:17:06] it the way God's prophet did in this
[1:17:08] day. It was part of your package. God
[1:17:12] wanted you to know that you, hallelujah,
[1:17:14] are part of a predestinated cause of
[1:17:17] God. It's you. It's me, it's people of
[1:17:20] God around the world. And there ain't
[1:17:22] enough devils in hell to stop it. There
[1:17:25] ain't enough devils in Tennessee to stop
[1:17:28] you from being what God wants you to be.
[1:17:36] He has fornown,
[1:17:38] predestined,
[1:17:40] called,
[1:17:42] justified,
[1:17:44] and already glorified us.
[1:17:48] This is what he wants you to feed on on
[1:17:51] your journey instead of the darkness and
[1:17:54] the sickness and the pain and the
[1:17:55] trouble. We get so caught up with so
[1:17:58] much negative stuff. My, it's absolutely
[1:18:00] awful that the devil gets us so
[1:18:02] sidetracked with so much trouble in our
[1:18:05] life and trouble in our family and
[1:18:07] trouble in the church and we've got all
[1:18:08] these promises right here in our
[1:18:10] treasure box
[1:18:11] and we just leave them in there.
[1:18:17] Moreover,
[1:18:18] whom he did predestinate,
[1:18:22] them he also called. And whom he called
[1:18:28] them, he notice who's doing the calling.
[1:18:32] Notice who's doing the predestinating.
[1:18:34] And notice who's doing the justifying.
[1:18:37] It ain't me. It ain't you. I don't need
[1:18:39] the pastor's approval. I don't need the
[1:18:41] deacon board's approval to say if I'm
[1:18:43] elected or called. God's the one who
[1:18:45] called me. God's the one who called you.
[1:18:47] God's the one who chose you.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah. Moreover, whom he did
[1:18:52] predestinate them, he also called. And
[1:18:55] whom he called them, he also justified.
[1:18:59] And whom he justified. Them he also
[1:19:03] glorified.
[1:19:05] I'm just waiting for my body to catch up
[1:19:08] with the revelation of my soul. That's
[1:19:11] why we enter into the presence of God
[1:19:13] sometime, Brother Jim. And what are we
[1:19:14] what are we partaking of the shakana
[1:19:17] glory of God? That's why Paul could say
[1:19:20] he has already translated us into the
[1:19:24] kingdom of his dear son.
[1:19:28] Is that everybody that's a Christian?
[1:19:30] No.
[1:19:31] Is that everybody that says they're
[1:19:33] saved? No.
[1:19:35] They've not even been translated beyond
[1:19:37] sin that's into the kingdom of his dear
[1:19:39] son.
[1:19:40] Watch. Oh, I hope somebody's going to
[1:19:43] get with me now.
[1:19:44] Okay.
[1:19:45] God is for us.
[1:19:49] Unwrap this one. Take the ribbons off
[1:19:52] and take the paper and pull it back.
[1:19:56] God is for us. So, who possibly
[1:20:01] can stand against us?
[1:20:06] Romans 8:31. What shall we then say to
[1:20:11] these things? If God be for us, who
[1:20:18] can be against us?
[1:20:20] Does anybody here believe that to be the
[1:20:22] word of God tonight? If God is on your
[1:20:25] side, young people, who can be against
[1:20:28] you?
[1:20:28] If God is on your side, middle age, old
[1:20:31] age, whatever we are, if God is on your
[1:20:34] side, who can be against you? Well,
[1:20:36] brother Donnie, the politicians of this
[1:20:38] and the other which are only creatures
[1:20:40] of time and they will pass away in a
[1:20:43] fleeting moment. And when there is no
[1:20:45] more Democrat party or Republican party,
[1:20:49] when there is no more United States of
[1:20:52] America, when there is no more cancer,
[1:20:55] when there is no more TV, when there is
[1:20:57] no more devil, you will still be in
[1:21:01] eternity shouting the praises of
[1:21:04] Almighty God. Why? Because he ordained
[1:21:08] you to be there. Who can stop you?
[1:21:11] Nobody. Who can keep you from going to
[1:21:14] heaven? Nobody.
[1:21:26] He did not spare his own son,
[1:21:33] but delivered him up
[1:21:36] for us.
[1:21:38] Verse 32.
[1:21:41] He that spared not his own son, but
[1:21:44] delivered him up for us all, how shall
[1:21:48] he not with him
[1:21:50] all so freely?
[1:21:54] Give us at least three things.
[1:22:01] Anybody believe this?
[1:22:05] Is this a promise to you, brother?
[1:22:07] Brother Harvey, Brother Dell, Sister
[1:22:10] Janet,
[1:22:11] what about it, brothers and sisters?
[1:22:12] Leah,
[1:22:16] is your name on this promise? Is this in
[1:22:19] your package of matan
[1:22:21] from your bridegroom?
[1:22:25] Then young sisters, you're praying about
[1:22:26] a boyfriend. He's already given you one.
[1:22:29] You just have to wait for him to show
[1:22:30] up.
[1:22:33] And just pray God moves on heart for him
[1:22:35] to move here and not take you away.
[1:22:40] Now that was just me of course that said
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:44] he has freely not begrudgingly
[1:22:49] but he has freely given us how much? All
[1:22:53] things
[1:22:57] also hallelujah to God. All things
[1:23:02] we have no charges
[1:23:06] brought against us.
[1:23:11] We have already been justified
[1:23:14] by the ultimate judge.
[1:23:17] Verse 33, who shall lay anything to the
[1:23:23] charge of God's elect?
[1:23:27] It is God
[1:23:30] that justify us.
[1:23:32] I'll tell you friends, if it wasn't for
[1:23:34] that tonight, I'd be a pretty
[1:23:35] discouraged person.
[1:23:37] Oh my goodness. Anybody else here as
[1:23:39] well? I get so disappointed with people
[1:23:42] and you get disappointed with people and
[1:23:44] you get disappointed with me and we get
[1:23:47] disappointed with this and that and the
[1:23:49] other. But God's word will not fail.
[1:23:52] God's word will not fail. He will have a
[1:23:55] bride that will walk in harmony with
[1:23:57] this word. The question is, am I part of
[1:24:00] it? Are you part of it? I believe I am.
[1:24:03] I believe you are. But God's going to
[1:24:05] have somebody and they're not going to
[1:24:07] barely make it by the skin of their
[1:24:09] teeth. But who can lay anything to the
[1:24:13] charge of God's elect? Not saying they
[1:24:16] can sin and get by with it, but if they
[1:24:19] do wrong, they'll repent of it. They'll
[1:24:21] make it right. They'll get up and meet
[1:24:23] the dust off their clothes and say,
[1:24:24] "Devil, you knocked me down, but you
[1:24:26] ain't going to keep me down. I may have
[1:24:29] hallelujah. I may have got down, but I
[1:24:32] won't stay down. I'm not ordained to be
[1:24:35] down. I'm ordained to be up.
[1:24:40] Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] We cannot
[1:24:52] be condemned.
[1:24:56] All I can say tonight, it's a good thing
[1:24:57] this ain't the first Baptist church cuz
[1:25:00] they had all shouted.
[1:25:02] They wouldn't have no hair pins in their
[1:25:04] head cuz their hair ain't long enough to
[1:25:05] do it. But their makeup would be running
[1:25:07] all on their face and their red lips
[1:25:08] would be running all down on their chin.
[1:25:10] Oh my Lord, they'd been thinking, "Oh,
[1:25:12] glory to God. He believes in eternal
[1:25:14] security. I do for the right type of
[1:25:16] people. I do.
[1:25:18] I'll tell you one thing if it make a
[1:25:20] Baptist shout. What about us bride
[1:25:21] members of Christ? What about it,
[1:25:23] Rebecca? This is your matan. This is who
[1:25:26] you are. This is part of your
[1:25:28] inheritance. He wanted you to know this
[1:25:30] now. Now's when we need it.
[1:25:38] We cannot
[1:25:40] be condemned
[1:25:42] because Jesus died and was raised and
[1:25:47] intercedes
[1:25:48] for us.
[1:25:54] From verse 35 on, I'm not responsible
[1:25:58] for my actions.
[1:26:00] Amen. We will never
[1:26:04] be separated from the love of Christ.
[1:26:09] Who
[1:26:10] shall separate us from the love
[1:26:15] of Christ?
[1:26:17] Shall tribulation,
[1:26:20] you answer me.
[1:26:22] Shall tribulation
[1:26:27] distress?
[1:26:30] Persecution,
[1:26:33] Glory to God. Famine,
[1:26:35] nakedness,
[1:26:37] peril,
[1:26:38] sword,
[1:26:40] hallelujah.
[1:26:41] Do you hear that? Hell,
[1:26:44] that's it.
[1:26:47] We cannot be separated. Even when we
[1:26:49] pray, when we cry and we pray and we beg
[1:26:52] God to do this and that and the other
[1:26:54] and it seemed tight that the heavens are
[1:26:56] silenced. Even silence does not separate
[1:27:00] us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.
[1:27:03] Our pain, our sorrow, our disappointment
[1:27:06] to unanswered prayers that will not
[1:27:09] separate us from the love of God in
[1:27:12] Christ Jesus.
[1:27:15] our broken hearts, our anxiety, our
[1:27:18] stress.
[1:27:26] Well, tribulation won't separate us
[1:27:30] and distress
[1:27:34] came too.
[1:27:36] Persecution,
[1:27:38] you're not big enough.
[1:27:43] Hallelujah. I'll put my foot right on
[1:27:45] top of you.
[1:27:48] And famine
[1:27:50] and heartache and distress
[1:27:54] too.
[1:27:57] Not a devil, not a devil in hell
[1:28:03] can ever pull you away
[1:28:08] from your king.
[1:28:12] The love of God which is in Christ
[1:28:14] Jesus, your flesh, your spirit, your
[1:28:18] mama, your daddy. Oh, I wish somebody
[1:28:19] come preach with me tonight. There ain't
[1:28:21] nothing in heaven. There ain't nothing
[1:28:23] in the earth. There ain't nothing in
[1:28:25] hell. There ain't nothing in time that
[1:28:28] can ever separate you from the love of
[1:28:30] God which is in Christ Jesus. It is your
[1:28:34] gift. It ain't based upon your
[1:28:36] determination. It ain't based upon your
[1:28:39] zeal. It was given to you.
[1:28:47] You are undefeable.
[1:28:56] Nakedness
[1:28:59] will not separate us. Pale will not
[1:29:02] separate us. The sword will not separate
[1:29:07] us.
[1:29:08] We overwhelmingly
[1:29:10] conquer
[1:29:12] through him who loves us even when we're
[1:29:16] persecuted
[1:29:17] all day long. Verse 37. Nay, in all
[1:29:20] these things we are more than
[1:29:22] conquerors.
[1:29:24] Through him that loved us.
[1:29:28] Let me say to man's greatest fear, death
[1:29:34] can't even separate us.
[1:29:40] For I am persuaded,
[1:29:42] hallelujah,
[1:29:44] that neither death
[1:29:47] nor life,
[1:29:50] nor angels,
[1:29:51] nor principalities,
[1:29:54] nor powers,
[1:29:56] nor things present.
[1:29:58] And he just went ahead and said it.
[1:30:00] Whatever is going to come,
[1:30:02] it don't really matter what is going to
[1:30:03] come. You imagine how much has come down
[1:30:05] the pipeline as we say since Paul wrote
[1:30:07] this 2,000 years ago. And Paul said,
[1:30:09] "I'll go ahead and blanket all of it
[1:30:11] from here to there. There ain't nothing
[1:30:13] now. There ain't nothing in the making.
[1:30:15] There ain't nothing next week. There
[1:30:17] ain't nothing next year that will ever
[1:30:19] be able to separate the bride from the
[1:30:21] love of God which is in Christ Jesus."
[1:30:24] That is your gift, my brother, sister.
[1:30:26] You are designed so you cannot be
[1:30:30] separated.
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:42] Death can't separate us. Life can't
[1:30:45] separate us. Angels can't separate us.
[1:30:49] Principalities can't separate us. Things
[1:30:51] present can't separate us. Things to
[1:30:53] come can't separate us.
[1:30:58] Powers can't separate us.
[1:31:01] height cannot separate us. Verse 39, nor
[1:31:05] heights, nor depths,
[1:31:10] nor any other creature.
[1:31:12] If there's anything left to Paul said
[1:31:14] that I don't know what's yet to come,
[1:31:15] I'll go ahead and cover it, too. You're
[1:31:17] covered plum right down to the rapture
[1:31:19] morning. There ain't nothing there. No
[1:31:21] internet, no television, no programs,
[1:31:23] this or that, or the other. Oh, a child
[1:31:25] of God may mess up and they may have
[1:31:27] cold times in their life, but just as
[1:31:29] sure as there's a God in heaven and
[1:31:30] there's a seed down in their soul. He
[1:31:32] will pull you back to himself. He's that
[1:31:35] great magnetic power and you are, oh,
[1:31:38] glory to God, you are magnetized to the
[1:31:40] pole of the almighty God and he will
[1:31:43] draw you right out of that cold state.
[1:31:46] He will draw you right out of that
[1:31:48] bitter state and that unforgiving spirit
[1:31:50] that you've got. He'll draw you right to
[1:31:53] himself. Yeah,
[1:31:55] cuz it's in you. It's in your seat.
[1:32:06] [Applause]
[1:32:07] Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] No created thing
[1:32:18] can separate us from the love of God.
[1:32:26] Oh, I love this little gift
[1:32:29] and the brides
[1:32:33] purpose
[1:32:35] and direction.
[1:32:38] Psalms 37:23,
[1:32:41] the steps
[1:32:44] of a good man are ordered by the Lord.
[1:32:47] But if there's anybody good, it's got to
[1:32:48] be that they've come through the
[1:32:50] goodness of God. Cuz every one of us is
[1:32:52] born rotten and no good at all.
[1:32:55] That's right.
[1:32:56] Here's the good person I want to be.
[1:32:58] Friends, the steps of a good man are
[1:33:01] ordered. Oh, I love this word. To be
[1:33:04] firm,
[1:33:06] be stable, be established, to be set up,
[1:33:10] to be fixed.
[1:33:12] The steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:33:15] the Lord, and he delightth in his way.
[1:33:19] This is part of who you are, purpose and
[1:33:22] direction for your life. Verse 24,
[1:33:24] though he fall, you mean to tell me a
[1:33:27] man walking in steps ordered by the Lord
[1:33:30] in the line of duty and a man can make
[1:33:33] mistakes. Sure, he can. Sure, he can
[1:33:35] fall and make mistakes, but he ain't
[1:33:37] going to stay down there. Oh,
[1:33:39] hallelujah. He will rise right back up
[1:33:41] again. Why? There's an order to his
[1:33:43] steps. God never ordered him to fall,
[1:33:46] but God ordered him if you do fall, get
[1:33:49] up. Get up. So, there's an order. Oh,
[1:33:52] hallelujah to God. There's an order that
[1:33:54] when you make a mistake, you've not got
[1:33:56] an order to make the mistake, but you've
[1:33:58] got an order what to do when you do make
[1:34:01] the mistake. I write unto you that you
[1:34:03] sin not. But if you sin, we have an
[1:34:05] advocate with the father so you fall
[1:34:07] flat on your face. Get up.
[1:34:10] Get up.
[1:34:18] Though he fall,
[1:34:20] he shall not be utterly cast down.
[1:34:25] For the Lord upholdeth him with his
[1:34:30] hand.
[1:34:31] Yes, he does.
[1:34:32] I have been young
[1:34:35] and now I'm old.
[1:34:37] Yet have I not seen the righteous
[1:34:39] forsaken,
[1:34:41] nor his seed begging bread.
[1:34:45] Psalms 119 105, none in you. Now this is
[1:34:49] a musical connotation there because
[1:34:51] Psalms of course are songs. Thy word is
[1:34:55] a lamp unto my feet. Purpose and
[1:34:58] direction. Thy word is a lamp
[1:35:02] unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[1:35:08] Proverbs 3:5, "Trust in the Lord with
[1:35:10] all thine heart, and lean not unto thine
[1:35:13] own understanding, and all thy ways
[1:35:16] acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
[1:35:20] paths."
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:22] Jeremiah 29:11, "For I know the thoughts
[1:35:25] that I think towards you,
[1:35:28] sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and
[1:35:31] not of evil,
[1:35:33] to give you an expected end."
[1:35:38] He knows the thoughts that he thinks for
[1:35:41] you. That's why he had a theophony for
[1:35:45] you before the foundation of the world.
[1:35:47] You've got an expected end. And it looks
[1:35:50] like you in a word form.
[1:35:54] Everybody ain't got a theophony, but if
[1:35:57] you're brides, you do. You've got an
[1:35:59] expected end out there. Oh, glory to
[1:36:01] God. Oh, how we miss those that have
[1:36:03] gone from us. How we miss our friends
[1:36:06] and our loved ones. But they have
[1:36:08] arrived and they're there waiting for
[1:36:10] us. You believe it? Say, and if I live
[1:36:12] long enough, you live long enough. We're
[1:36:14] all going the same way. But by the grace
[1:36:16] of God, he said, "I know the thoughts
[1:36:19] that I think towards you and they are
[1:36:21] good, they are not evil." He don't think
[1:36:23] judgment for you. He don't think
[1:36:25] tribulation period for you. He thinks
[1:36:28] body change. He thinks rapture. He
[1:36:31] thinks hallelujah to God, a magnifying
[1:36:34] of the glory of God in your life. That's
[1:36:36] what he thinks.
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:41] Proverbs 16:3, "Commit thy works
[1:36:46] unto the Lord,
[1:36:50] and thy thoughts
[1:36:53] shall be established."
[1:36:56] Wow.
[1:37:01] St. John 16:13,
[1:37:04] "How be it, when he, the Spirit of
[1:37:06] truth, has come, he will guide you unto
[1:37:09] all truths, for he shall not speak of
[1:37:12] himself,
[1:37:14] but whatsoever he shall hear,
[1:37:17] that shall he speak, and he will show
[1:37:19] you things to come
[1:37:23] in your package
[1:37:25] is direction,
[1:37:27] plans, and direction for your journey.
[1:37:33] Ephesians 2:10, for we are his
[1:37:35] workmanship,
[1:37:37] created
[1:37:38] in Christ Jesus
[1:37:41] unto good works,
[1:37:43] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:37:46] should walk in them. Can I cover another
[1:37:49] package here?
[1:37:51] Oh, I think you'll like this one.
[1:37:54] Oh,
[1:37:56] I see that little tag on it. What's that
[1:37:59] say?
[1:38:00] Oh boy, that sounds like a good package.
[1:38:04] Strength and weakness.
[1:38:08] Let's see what that little package
[1:38:09] holds, shall we? Be okay with you if I
[1:38:12] open it up for you?
[1:38:14] Psalms 18:32.
[1:38:17] It is God that girthth me with strength,
[1:38:21] and maketh my way perfect. He maketh my
[1:38:25] feet like hind's feet and setth me upon
[1:38:29] my
[1:38:31] high places.
[1:38:34] That's where I want to walk myself.
[1:38:37] Now, I can rejoice with you and you can
[1:38:39] rejoice with me, but I want my places.
[1:38:42] I don't want I don't want Brother Tim's
[1:38:44] places, Brother Ron's places, you know,
[1:38:46] Brother Daryl's places. No, no. I I I
[1:38:48] want my places. Whatever's got my name
[1:38:51] on it. You know, Caleb didn't stand
[1:38:52] there and say, "Now, I want Joshua's
[1:38:54] mountain, and I want so and so." But
[1:38:56] Caleb said, "Give me my mountain."
[1:39:00] God has got something with your name on
[1:39:03] it. Is that what you want? Now, yours
[1:39:05] might be a heel, and yours might just be
[1:39:07] a little bit of a something like that.
[1:39:09] It don't matter how big it is or how
[1:39:11] great it is, but the thing of it is, I
[1:39:14] just want what's mine. Amen.
[1:39:18] Verse 34, he teaches my hands
[1:39:23] to war
[1:39:25] so that a bow of steel
[1:39:29] is broken by mine arms.
[1:39:34] Uhhuh. Strength in weakness.
[1:39:38] Thou hast also given me the shield of
[1:39:41] thy salvation, and thy right hand hath
[1:39:44] holdened me up,
[1:39:46] and thy gentleness
[1:39:48] hath made me great. What a peculiar way
[1:39:52] to make people great.
[1:39:55] So instead of using roughness and
[1:39:57] valance and stuff like that, God used
[1:40:01] gentleness.
[1:40:03] Only God can use gentleness to make
[1:40:06] great people. Huh? Notice
[1:40:09] I have pursued. Oh my. Let me let me
[1:40:12] read. Don't let me skip verse 36. Thou
[1:40:14] hast enlarged my steps under me.
[1:40:20] So in other words, I put my foot down in
[1:40:22] there and it was a size 10. But when I
[1:40:24] pull my foot out, it looked like a size
[1:40:26] 20. And I put another 10, a 20, a 10, a
[1:40:30] 20, a 10, and 20. He enlarged my steps.
[1:40:33] And the devil looked down there and
[1:40:34] said, "That boy ain't got feet that
[1:40:36] big."
[1:40:38] Whose feet is them?
[1:40:39] Whose feet is them feet?
[1:40:41] It's that one packing me.
[1:40:43] Amen. Don't look at yourself. Oh, glory
[1:40:46] to God. Lord, how I want to do this, I'm
[1:40:47] going to do that. No, it ain't how big
[1:40:48] you are. It ain't how great you are.
[1:40:50] It's how big the one packing you is.
[1:40:53] Your feet may not be but that big, but
[1:40:54] he can make them footsteps appear about
[1:40:56] that long. And the devil said, "Good
[1:40:58] Lord, there is a Bigfoot. There is a
[1:41:00] real Bigfoot. And who in the world's
[1:41:01] packing?" Donny's foot ain't that big.
[1:41:04] I've heard Donnie roar. He sounds like a
[1:41:06] booty cat. It ain't Donnie. Who is that
[1:41:08] roar? I'll tell you who it is. It's my
[1:41:10] great husband. Whenever he wants to
[1:41:12] scare the devil, he can roar like a
[1:41:14] mighty lion.
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:26] Thou hast enlarged
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:30] my steps under me that my feet did not
[1:41:35] slip.
[1:41:37] I have pursued my enemies.
[1:41:41] Wow.
[1:41:43] So instead of them pursuing you, you
[1:41:46] turn around and chase them.
[1:41:48] Boy, you talking about a church. Woo.
[1:41:50] Glory to God. I have pursued mine
[1:41:53] enemies and overtaken them. Neither did
[1:41:57] I turn again till they were consumed.
[1:42:00] Brother, sister, you talking about a
[1:42:02] church of the living God marching in the
[1:42:04] last days. If we can lay our jealousy,
[1:42:06] our enmity, our strife, and this and
[1:42:08] that another aside and come into our
[1:42:10] position and go to feasting on the matan
[1:42:12] of what God has given us, a mighty army,
[1:42:15] a mighty army will leave this world in a
[1:42:18] rapture. There won't be millions times
[1:42:20] millions of them. But once again, the
[1:42:22] earth will hear from heaven
[1:42:25] with a bride's voice backed by the voice
[1:42:28] of the bridegroom with the bridegroom's
[1:42:30] steps, with the bridegroom's blood, with
[1:42:33] the bridegroom's manifestation in her.
[1:42:36] Hallelujah. Cuz she will be saying what
[1:42:39] the prophet said, and they will both be
[1:42:42] saying what the word said.
[1:42:45] And the final voice to the final age
[1:42:48] will be the bride of Christ.
[1:42:54] Psalm 46:1
[1:42:57] to the chief musician
[1:43:00] for the sons
[1:43:02] of Kora,
[1:43:04] a song upon
[1:43:06] Alamos.
[1:43:09] God is our refuge and strength,
[1:43:13] a very present help in trouble.
[1:43:17] How many can say amen to that? Amen.
[1:43:20] Therefore,
[1:43:21] we will not Oh, glory. We notice will
[1:43:25] not we fear though the earth
[1:43:30] be removed and though the mountains be
[1:43:33] carried into the midst of the sea, but
[1:43:37] it still won't shake us.
[1:43:39] That's right.
[1:43:40] Amen.
[1:43:41] Now, you imagine this is people in the
[1:43:43] Old Testament that wasn't even born
[1:43:44] again.
[1:43:45] Wow.
[1:43:46] All I can say is it's a good thing that
[1:43:48] David lived in the Old Testament instead
[1:43:50] of living in the New. And if David would
[1:43:52] have lived in this last age under the
[1:43:54] under the call of Malachi 4. Poor guy,
[1:43:57] he'd have probably went from one church
[1:43:58] message to another to another and that
[1:44:01] probably just about throwed him out of
[1:44:02] every one of them that he went cuz he'd
[1:44:04] have been a singing and a shouting
[1:44:05] having his heart jumping up and down and
[1:44:07] running. Oh my. Can you imagine David
[1:44:10] sitting here tonight hearing these
[1:44:11] psalms read and preached from the New
[1:44:14] Testament anointing and David sitting
[1:44:16] here with a new verse and he said he
[1:44:19] hungered for God and loved God and
[1:44:21] wanted to be around God. And if David
[1:44:23] went around and around and danced in the
[1:44:25] Old Testament and didn't even have the
[1:44:27] Holy Ghost in his soul. Can you imagine
[1:44:30] when the brothers come up on the music
[1:44:31] here in a little bit and we go to sing a
[1:44:33] little bit of songs and right down that
[1:44:35] middle aisle would have come King David.
[1:44:37] I mean, he was just a dancing back and
[1:44:39] forth and had his chamber in his hand
[1:44:42] and all the rest of people and what
[1:44:43] would some of you goose message people
[1:44:45] done be looking around said, "What in
[1:44:48] the world is he doing?" If he had that
[1:44:50] much joy in the Old Testament, what
[1:44:52] would he have done in the New Testament?
[1:44:54] I tell you, there ought to be a people
[1:44:56] in this day that's got more joy than the
[1:44:59] world can give. We ought to have more
[1:45:01] joy than alcohol. We ought to have more
[1:45:04] joy than the people on drugs. We ought
[1:45:07] to have more happiness down in our soul
[1:45:09] because we've got something that will
[1:45:12] last
[1:45:17] and it won't give you a hangover.
[1:45:21] Now, you will feel wore out when it
[1:45:23] leaves you. I can tell you that. I'm
[1:45:25] starting to feel it right now.
[1:45:29] Hallelujah.
[1:45:30] Oh my. Listen to this. Isaiah 25:4 in a
[1:45:34] few more minutes.
[1:45:35] Amen. For thou
[1:45:38] hast been a strength to the poor,
[1:45:41] a strength to the needy and his
[1:45:44] distress,
[1:45:46] a refuge
[1:45:48] from the storm, a shadow
[1:45:52] from the heat. when the blast of the
[1:45:56] terrible ones is as a storm against the
[1:46:01] wall.
[1:46:02] But thou has been a shelter
[1:46:06] for me.
[1:46:08] Oh, lead me to the rock that is higher
[1:46:13] than high. Oh, lead me,
[1:46:18] somebody lead me. Oh, somebody lead me
[1:46:24] to that rock. It's higher than your
[1:46:27] anxieties.
[1:46:28] It's greater than your distress.
[1:46:31] Amen.
[1:46:34] Isaiah 41:10.
[1:46:38] Fear thou not,
[1:46:43] for I am with thee.
[1:46:47] Be not dismayed,
[1:46:55] for I am thy God.
[1:47:00] I will strengthen thee. Yay,
[1:47:03] I will help thee. Yay,
[1:47:06] I will uphold thee with the right hand
[1:47:11] of my righteousness.
[1:47:14] bride,
[1:47:16] this is your gifts.
[1:47:19] Why don't you spend less time on
[1:47:21] Instagram,
[1:47:22] less time on Facebook,
[1:47:25] less time on a bunch of trash and
[1:47:27] nonsense,
[1:47:28] and go to reopening up your passages and
[1:47:32] your gifts.
[1:47:33] You might find your day is a lot
[1:47:36] happier,
[1:47:38] a lot smoother. whatsoever things are
[1:47:40] lovely and holy and pure,
[1:47:43] think on these things.
[1:47:47] 2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he said unto
[1:47:49] me, my grace is sufficient for thee, for
[1:47:54] my strength
[1:47:57] is made perfect in weakness.
[1:48:00] Most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:48:03] glory
[1:48:05] in my infirmities that the power of
[1:48:07] Christ
[1:48:09] may rest upon me.
[1:48:13] Ephesians 6:10. Finally, my brethren,
[1:48:16] be strong in the Lord and in the power
[1:48:22] of his might, not yours.
[1:48:25] Amen.
[1:48:26] Not yours. You see, when you and I feel
[1:48:28] so weak, we can still be strong in the
[1:48:32] power of his might.
[1:48:36] Philippians 4:13,
[1:48:39] I can do all things
[1:48:42] through Christ
[1:48:45] which strengthenth
[1:48:47] me.
[1:48:49] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:52] Let's stand.
[1:49:11] Oh my goodness.
[1:49:20] It's no wonder to me
[1:49:25] when he finally makes it to the house
[1:49:30] and as it was the Middle Eastern custom
[1:49:34] to prepare a meal for the guest.
[1:49:39] So they prepared a meal at the full
[1:49:42] gospel businessman maybe.
[1:49:47] But Eleazar said,
[1:49:50] "I can't eat.
[1:49:52] I can't eat. This business is so
[1:49:55] pressing.
[1:49:57] I must make known to you my mission,
[1:50:02] my master Abraham.
[1:50:05] And he goes way back
[1:50:08] before time
[1:50:10] and he goes to tell him about the
[1:50:11] goodness of God to Abraham and Isaac
[1:50:15] given the history and the journey of
[1:50:18] faith
[1:50:20] and said he sent me here to find a bride
[1:50:23] for my master.
[1:50:26] Now will you let her go?
[1:50:29] And they said,
[1:50:31] "Sounds like it's of God to us.
[1:50:35] But tell you what,
[1:50:38] let her let her stay for at least
[1:50:42] 10 days."
[1:50:45] Now, the number 10 in the Hebrew
[1:50:47] language doesn't mean the same thing as
[1:50:48] it does to you and I. We just counted
[1:50:50] off, you know, it's 10. But 10 could
[1:50:53] mean months to them.
[1:50:57] It could be months.
[1:51:00] So what they wanted to do is delay her
[1:51:04] from joining in this cult
[1:51:08] that they thought if they could keep her
[1:51:11] home and just don't don't do it. We'll
[1:51:14] make him stay here. Just just stay here
[1:51:16] or we we'll send you over. We we'll take
[1:51:19] you later.
[1:51:21] He said, "Don't tell Amy.
[1:51:24] I must leave immediately.
[1:51:29] Now remember, while this talking is
[1:51:31] going on, Rebecca is not there.
[1:51:35] So they said, "We'll call the maid and
[1:51:38] ask her." No doubt very confident she'd
[1:51:42] stay with that trinitarian teaching
[1:51:44] she'd been taught all her life. She'd
[1:51:46] been raised a staunch church of Christ
[1:51:48] and they knew what she'd do. She's cut
[1:51:50] her teeth on a Church of Christ school
[1:51:53] or a Baptist church. So they come back
[1:51:54] and she just walked in there, you know,
[1:51:56] just just walked in there like she's
[1:51:58] heir of everything. She was just walked
[1:52:00] in there and said, "Uh, this guy's
[1:52:02] wanted to take you." I mean, he's like
[1:52:03] he's wanting to leave tomorrow.
[1:52:06] You're 16 years old. You don't even know
[1:52:08] this man. There's no way for us to check
[1:52:09] him out. He has no no identification.
[1:52:12] He's only got a a bunch of stories
[1:52:15] and we can't even prove them by
[1:52:17] newspapers.
[1:52:22] I mean, we've searched YouTube and we've
[1:52:24] searched Google and we searched the
[1:52:25] Courier Journal and we have no proof and
[1:52:27] no record that 16 men fell off of the
[1:52:29] bridge. So, he must be lying.
[1:52:32] We have no proof that some angel come up
[1:52:34] there to some cave somewhere. We only
[1:52:36] have his word for this and he's wanting
[1:52:38] you to leaveth him immediately.
[1:52:42] Will you go? She said, I will.
[1:52:46] You imagine, brother Jack, what they
[1:52:48] thought. No, no, no. That's not what
[1:52:49] you're supposed to say. What happened to
[1:52:51] that good church of Christ teaching? It
[1:52:53] went out the window.
[1:52:55] It went out the window. All the Baptist
[1:52:57] seats and all the Methodist seats and
[1:52:59] all the Pentecostal went out. Why? She
[1:53:02] heard a man with a message.
[1:53:06] And you know what that message done? Not
[1:53:08] the man. That message captured
[1:53:12] her soul
[1:53:16] for
[1:53:18] Isaac.
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:24] Praise God.
[1:53:26] Don't you love him?
[1:53:29] Amen.
[1:53:30] Look friend, when you read this message
[1:53:32] and you hear the tapes and the things,
[1:53:37] if it does not make you love the Lord
[1:53:39] Jesus more
[1:53:41] and all it does is make you want to
[1:53:43] argue and debate about doctrine and
[1:53:44] theology and this that and the other, go
[1:53:46] back and listen to it again
[1:53:48] cuz you're missing what the prophet
[1:53:49] wanted it to do.
[1:53:50] That's right.
[1:53:51] Read the preface of the church age book
[1:53:52] and see exactly what his desire was to
[1:53:54] come and establish a relationship
[1:53:57] between God
[1:53:58] and man. Amen.
[1:54:00] He didn't want to make a denomination.
[1:54:01] He didn't want to make no cult. Some of
[1:54:03] the message people had made one.
[1:54:05] But that was not his intention at all.
[1:54:08] He wanted people to love God. He wanted
[1:54:11] people just hearing him talk about him.
[1:54:15] You imagine as he stood there
[1:54:19] and that Park View auditorium
[1:54:22] that night and it come back to him. So
[1:54:25] it's February
[1:54:28] 17th, 18th, something like that, 1965,
[1:54:32] and he has a flashback, brother Daryl,
[1:54:34] in his memory.
[1:54:37] He's heard now, they built a school, and
[1:54:40] they're allowing him to have it for
[1:54:42] these meetings. Seeds not air the show,
[1:54:47] marriage, and divorce. Those tremendous
[1:54:50] services are who is this Melzdc?
[1:54:53] And he starts it out talking about what
[1:54:57] he was sleeping on the front porch.
[1:55:00] It was the summertime
[1:55:03] and a burden come on his heart for his
[1:55:05] father.
[1:55:07] So he gets up off out of the porch and
[1:55:09] he walks out in the field.
[1:55:12] That little sagebrush grass there has a
[1:55:16] toothpick on the top part of it.
[1:55:19] And he said he looked up and facing west
[1:55:22] was the Lord Jesus. And he said I
[1:55:24] thought surely I'm not looking at my
[1:55:27] Lord.
[1:55:29] He was looking intently. Well, he said
[1:55:35] he thought I'll call his name.
[1:55:39] So he stepped around and he called his
[1:55:42] name. Lord Jesus.
[1:55:47] And he said he turned and looked at me
[1:55:50] with such an expression that he could
[1:55:51] speak and the world would come to an
[1:55:53] end.
[1:55:55] And he didn't describe him as, you know,
[1:55:57] a handsome type of a person,
[1:56:00] but the qualities that were in the face.
[1:56:04] Oh, God. I long to see that face,
[1:56:11] friends. He said, that's all I remember.
[1:56:15] I come to the next morning, my pajama
[1:56:18] shirt wet with tears.
[1:56:21] So he had laid there and cried
[1:56:24] for the rest of the night.
[1:56:28] Hallelujah. From that day to this, he
[1:56:30] said, "I've never understood exactly
[1:56:32] what it was." But now here we are
[1:56:34] tonight standing in an auditorium that's
[1:56:37] dedicated for the service of Jesus
[1:56:39] Christ. Which is a peculiar thing to say
[1:56:41] it was a school.
[1:56:44] But it shows when the saints of God come
[1:56:46] in, they take over.
[1:56:48] [Laughter]
[1:56:50] It was a school. That's what it was for.
[1:56:54] But look at the sermons that was
[1:56:55] preached. You believe what you want to.
[1:56:58] I personally believe Melzdc himself
[1:57:01] showed up in those meetings.
[1:57:05] Let me go on a little farther.
[1:57:08] I'm expecting Melzdc himself
[1:57:12] to show up this weekend.
[1:57:13] Oh yeah.
[1:57:14] The Lord Jesus. How many's expecting our
[1:57:18] Lord to come? You got needs, you got
[1:57:20] desires, you got loved ones, whatever
[1:57:22] more. He's the same God. Remember that
[1:57:26] Eleaser delivered his message and went
[1:57:28] on and and Isaac took Rebecca into his
[1:57:32] mother's tent and he knew her and she
[1:57:36] became his wife and he was comforted
[1:57:40] from the death of his mother.
[1:57:45] What happened to Elizer?
[1:57:48] We don't know. His name was so important
[1:57:52] in Genesis 24. His name is not even
[1:57:54] mentioned
[1:57:56] only his office.
[1:58:00] God don't want us to make an idol out of
[1:58:02] a prophet or a pastor or a teacher.
[1:58:06] That's right.
[1:58:08] Don't you love him?
[1:58:12] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:58:17] I wish I was out there in that parking
[1:58:19] lot again by myself.
[1:58:23] cuz now I feel his presence.
[1:58:29] Oh Lord Jesus,
[1:58:32] we worship you, Lord God.
[1:58:35] Thank you for sending us a messenger.
[1:58:37] Lord,
[1:58:41] they didn't name a highway after him or
[1:58:43] a bridge after him or a college or
[1:58:45] school.
[1:58:47] He didn't come to introduce us to some
[1:58:51] type of cult movement that would make
[1:58:53] him the Messiah.
[1:58:56] But he come to say, "I'm not here
[1:58:58] telling you he's coming."
[1:59:01] But I'm here to tell you he's here.
[1:59:06] And when the prophet left, you didn't
[1:59:08] leave. You're still here.
[1:59:12] you're here tonight.
[1:59:15] Oh Jesus, we worship you, Lord.
[1:59:20] Forgive us for getting so caught up in
[1:59:22] life.
[1:59:24] Just busy with this and busy with that.
[1:59:28] Not taking time to open up our gifts
[1:59:32] from our husband.
[1:59:34] Going through all the little precious
[1:59:37] things,
[1:59:38] some old, some new.
[1:59:42] Some lost, some that's been found, some
[1:59:46] that were stolen away by the devil and
[1:59:49] been restored in the last day for the
[1:59:53] bride's identity.
[1:59:56] Oh, we worship you tonight, Jesus.
[2:00:00] Oh, I imagine Rebecca's little heart
[2:00:02] must have just
[2:00:04] exploded
[2:00:06] every hour as she listened to Eleaser,
[2:00:10] as he began to describe him.
[2:00:14] He could describe him because
[2:00:17] he had seen him,
[2:00:19] he knew him,
[2:00:21] he had met him,
[2:00:24] he had talked to him.
[2:00:26] This is why the prophet said, "No man
[2:00:28] should preach
[2:00:30] until he has personally met that pillar
[2:00:32] of fire." It ain't enough to go to
[2:00:34] college. It ain't enough to get a a
[2:00:37] computer and have the message infabase
[2:00:39] and go to study and put sermons
[2:00:41] together.
[2:00:42] He's got to meet the Lord Jesus himself
[2:00:46] on a one- on-one. That's the way he
[2:00:48] calls his true servants.
[2:00:52] And he imprints upon them this image
[2:00:56] that they are to introduce him. Not
[2:01:00] theirel, not magnify their gifts, their
[2:01:03] calling, their ministry, their church,
[2:01:04] their this, their there, their there, I,
[2:01:06] I, I I I, me, me,
[2:01:09] but they're to preach Jesus,
[2:01:12] manifest Jesus till it'll make his bride
[2:01:15] so hungry.
[2:01:17] Oh, glory to God.
[2:01:21] Help me Jesus to do that.
[2:01:25] We worship you Lord.
[2:01:29] We worship you, Father.
[2:01:31] Can we just close our eyes now? Just
[2:01:34] raise our hands together and let's just
[2:01:37] spend a few moments now before we go
[2:01:41] in the presence
[2:01:43] of our Isaac.
[2:01:45] Our Eleer has done such a wonderful job.
[2:01:51] Hallelujah.
[2:01:53] That when we hear him preach to us the
[2:01:55] future home, when we hear him preach to
[2:01:59] us proving his word, when we hear him
[2:02:02] preach to us these great tremendous
[2:02:05] sermons,
[2:02:07] we hear the voice of a Kentucky
[2:02:09] preacher, but we also hear the voice
[2:02:12] behind the voice.
[2:02:15] And that's the one that's calling us to
[2:02:18] that great invisible union.
[2:02:21] Oh, we worship you, Lord.
[2:02:26] Father, the sons of Kora are long gone.
[2:02:31] Masciel
[2:02:33] and none.
[2:02:34] And many of the harpists
[2:02:38] and the musicians of that day at North
[2:02:42] many of those men, they've lived their
[2:02:44] lives.
[2:02:46] But now we still have anointed men and
[2:02:49] women who sing and play
[2:02:52] and help us in worship.
[2:02:55] Lord Jesus, may they be anointed this
[2:02:58] night. I pray for a special anointing
[2:03:00] for the singers, for the musicians
[2:03:02] coming up this week. Lord God, from the
[2:03:04] first note of music, may the presence of
[2:03:08] God,
[2:03:09] help these musicians to constantly keep
[2:03:12] before them. They have the ability to
[2:03:15] drive away spirits.
[2:03:18] And Elisha was all out of sorts and in a
[2:03:21] bad temper, in a bad mood, and they
[2:03:24] called for an anointed musician. And he
[2:03:27] be
[2:03:29] the spirit of God came upon him.
[2:03:32] Lord God, may our musicians here at the
[2:03:34] church always be anointed with your
[2:03:37] presence. May our special singers not
[2:03:40] sing to impress or sing to outdo the
[2:03:44] other, but may they sing to bless your
[2:03:46] bride.
[2:03:48] Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight,
[2:03:51] Father.
[2:03:53] Hallelujah.
[2:03:56] Hallelujah, Lord.
[2:03:59] Oh, we worship you tonight, Father.
[2:04:04] Sing something for us. Hey, let us just
[2:04:05] worship him. I'm not going to keep you.
[2:04:07] I know we got several meetings together,
[2:04:09] but you know, I I I just didn't want to
[2:04:12] cancel church tonight. I know sometimes
[2:04:14] people do in the weekend coming up, but
[2:04:15] I thought, no, no, I I think it'll be
[2:04:19] good for us to be together on Wednesday
[2:04:20] night.
[2:04:21] Boy, am I glad I didn't.
[2:04:24] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:04:27] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:29] Let's just worship him now together. If
[2:04:32] you need to go, you got a distance to
[2:04:34] drive or something like that. Sure, I
[2:04:36] understand that the Lord does do. But if
[2:04:38] you can, let's just stay for a few
[2:04:40] minutes and just worship him now in his
[2:04:42] presence.
[2:04:44] Oh, he's delivered to us a whole heart
[2:04:46] full of gifts tonight.
[2:04:51] May he anoint us to receive them.
[2:04:54] Thank you, Lord. I shall forever.
[2:05:02] My God, I bless your name.
[2:05:04] My love, my father, I worship you.
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:11] Oh Lord God, we bless your name.
[2:05:16] We worship you tonight, Father
[2:05:19] Jesus.
[2:05:21] May we take these things into our soul,
[2:05:23] Lord.
[2:05:25] May they feed us. May they nurture us,
[2:05:27] Lord.
[2:05:35] Hallelujah.
[2:05:37] [Music]
[2:05:39] Hallelujah.
[2:05:41] Lord, just sing it to him now.
[2:05:46] Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:50] Just sing the verse now. Amazing grace.
[2:05:55] with all of our hearts. Let's just make
[2:05:56] love to him now.
[2:05:59] Amazing
[2:06:02] grace
[2:06:05] shall always
[2:06:08] be
[2:06:10] my song
[2:06:12] of praise.
[2:06:15] Oh, for it was free
[2:06:21] that all
[2:06:23] my
[2:06:26] cheek.
[2:06:29] I
[2:06:31] do
[2:06:33] not know
[2:06:37] just why he came
[2:06:41] to love me. So
[2:06:46] he looked
[2:06:48] me home
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:52] on my fault
[2:06:54] and saw
[2:06:57] my need. Everybody
[2:07:02] I shall forever
[2:07:08] live or loving little Rebecca.
[2:07:12] You're on your journey riding on the
[2:07:15] camel train. It won't be long.
[2:07:19] It won't be long. You'll see the hills
[2:07:21] of glory come into view and you'll see
[2:07:25] our eyes again.
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:29] Oh, hallelujah. Lord God,
[2:07:33] how marvelous
[2:07:39] the grace
[2:07:41] come my
[2:07:43] [Music]
[2:07:45] soul?
[2:07:49] He look
[2:07:51] beyond
[2:07:54] all
[2:07:55] my hope
[2:07:57] and soul.
[2:08:03] Down from his glory. Down from his
[2:08:06] glory.
[2:08:08] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:08:11] Praise the Lord. Oh, you heard me preach
[2:08:14] it years and years ago.
[2:08:16] But little Rebecca going along and Eleer
[2:08:20] telling her one thing and another and
[2:08:22] another and
[2:08:24] maybe her telling Eliza in the journey,
[2:08:28] Elizer,
[2:08:30] tell me more.
[2:08:33] Tell me more.
[2:08:35] How many wants to hear more about him?
[2:08:38] Amen.
[2:08:39] You know what? I could start telling you
[2:08:41] more about me, but it wouldn't take but
[2:08:43] just a couple of minutes and I'd run
[2:08:45] out. And I know some of you think I
[2:08:47] could tell a lot about you, but probably
[2:08:49] at the most, maybe 12, 12 minutes. And
[2:08:52] most of you, you'd be run out, too.
[2:08:55] But think of it. We're talking about a
[2:08:57] being that is so magnificent and so
[2:08:59] great. In eternity,
[2:09:03] he will still be revealing himself. Wow.
[2:09:09] That's my God.
[2:09:12] Can we just sing another one here?
[2:09:15] Sing it for us here.
[2:09:18] Down.
[2:09:20] Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:24] Thank you, Lord. God,
[2:09:26] ever
[2:09:29] story. story.
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:34] My God
[2:09:36] and my Savior
[2:09:39] came
[2:09:42] and Jesus
[2:09:45] was
[2:09:47] his name.
[2:09:50] Born in
[2:09:53] a manger
[2:09:58] to his own
[2:10:01] a strange
[2:10:05] a man
[2:10:08] of sorrows,
[2:10:11] tears
[2:10:13] and I
[2:10:16] [Music]
[2:10:18] everybody do.
[2:10:22] Oh, how
[2:10:25] how we ought to love you.
[2:10:29] How I
[2:10:32] adore
[2:10:34] you.
[2:10:37] My breath,
[2:10:39] my sunshine.
[2:10:45] My all

[2:10:55] creator.
[2:11:00] Thank you Lord.
[2:11:02] Thank you Lord God.
[2:11:10] Hallelujah.
[2:11:13] Let's just sing that chorus together
[2:11:14] again. We'll we'll let you go.
[2:11:18] Oh, hallelujah, everybody. Oh, how I
[2:11:21] love you.
[2:11:22] [Music]
[2:11:24] Just tell him I love you, Jesus.
[2:11:28] I love you. My great king.
[2:11:31] How I
[2:11:34] adore him.
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:39] my breath.
[2:11:40] You're my sunshine.
[2:11:45] You're my all
[2:11:48] in
[2:11:53] [Music]
[2:11:54] the great
[2:11:56] creator.
[2:12:00] [Music]
[2:12:02] He became
[2:12:04] our savior.
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:06] [Laughter]
[2:12:09] and all God
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] dwells us
[2:12:19] in you.
[2:12:23] [Music]
[2:12:26] Our heavenly father, we want to thank
[2:12:28] you for this service tonight.
[2:12:31] Thank you for the opportunity we could
[2:12:33] be gathered together again.
[2:12:35] I know I've given them a lot to look at
[2:12:38] and it may be something they have to go
[2:12:40] back and listen to again or go back and
[2:12:42] reread the scriptures, but I so thank
[2:12:45] you for your word, what it means to us.
[2:12:48] Lord, ask that you go with us now, Lord,
[2:12:51] and bring us back Friday night if it be
[2:12:54] pleasing to you as we look for a great
[2:12:57] visitation of your presence Friday,
[2:13:00] Saturday, and Sunday. a great time of
[2:13:02] your word, a great time of singing and
[2:13:05] worship and fellowship and food and Lord
[2:13:08] meals and things afterwards and just a
[2:13:11] time to see some of our friends that we
[2:13:13] haven't seen in a while. Lord God, would
[2:13:16] you just watch over those traveling in
[2:13:18] and give them traveling mercy? Dear God,
[2:13:21] be with us this week. or believe in you
[2:13:24] for great healings in the prayer line,
[2:13:26] for miracles, for great things to happen
[2:13:29] to your people. Not to prove that our
[2:13:32] church is anything or to prove that any
[2:13:34] preacher is anything, but to prove it's
[2:13:37] in the package of the bride's love
[2:13:40] gifts, healing, deliverance.
[2:13:45] Go with us now. Father, watch over us.
[2:13:48] We pray in the name of Jesus.
[2:13:52] And the church said,
[2:13:54] "Amen.
[2:13:55] I will sing of the goodness of God."
[2:13:59] Amen. Turn and shake somebody's hand.
[2:14:00] Tell them it's good to be in the house
[2:14:02] of the Lord tonight. Praise the Lord.
[2:14:05] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.
[2:14:08] Love you so much. Lord willing. See you
[2:14:11] Friday night. We'll sing it together as
[2:14:13] we as we go. Bishop Harry.
[2:14:16] I love you, Lord.
[2:14:19] Amen.
[2:14:21] For your mercy never fails,
[2:14:23] never fails me.
[2:14:26] In all my days,
[2:14:28] all my days
[2:14:29] I've been held in your
[2:14:31] in your hands.
[2:14:34] From the moment that I wake up
[2:14:39] until I lay my head,
[2:14:43] I will sing
[2:14:46] of the goodness.
