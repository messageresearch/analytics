[32:59] face shalt thou eat bread till thou
[33:01] return unto the ground for out of it was
[33:04] doubt taken for dust thou art and dust
[33:06] thou shalt return in reading that what
[33:10] God is actually doing we're gonna look
[33:11] at this kind of a across a court trial
[33:14] that God is actually passing sentence in
[33:16] the garden and Adam called his wife's
[33:21] name Eve because she was the mother of
[33:23] all living and unto Adam also and his
[33:25] wife did God make coats of skins and
[33:28] clothed him and if we could turn over to
[33:31] mark 15 verse 22
[33:44] this is also God passing sins for your
[33:49] sins
[33:54] and they bring him into the police call
[33:56] Gotha which is being interpreted place
[33:58] of his skull they gave him to drink wine
[34:04] mingled with myrrh but he received it
[34:06] not when they had crucified him they
[34:14] parted is gone what's casting Lots upon
[34:16] him what every man should take and it
[34:20] was the third iron hour and they
[34:22] crucified him let us pray Heavenly
[34:28] Father lord I thank you Lord for what
[34:34] you did for me for the representation
[34:37] Lord that you put out for me to lay my
[34:40] sins upon Lord just my sins on a loan
[34:46] Lord where they laid upon him your
[34:49] father would have seen too much but here
[34:53] Lord used your prophet said you made a
[34:55] propitiation for our sins Lord and you
[34:59] murdered your own son to take my place
[35:03] Lord as we look at this tonight father
[35:05] Lord you put a thought on our heart Lord
[35:08] you give us quotes and scriptures Lord
[35:10] we could study for hours on the end Lord
[35:13] Lord but if you don't come and hand it
[35:16] to the bride Lord Lord it be for nothing
[35:20] so the Lord I pray that you would help
[35:22] me tonight to get out of the way Lord
[35:24] Lord I get nervous and everything seems
[35:27] to come out wrong Lord but lord I pray
[35:30] that you would put me aside Lord but not
[35:32] only me Lord I prayed you put these
[35:33] people aside father Lord if they expect
[35:37] anything out of the flesh father they're
[35:39] going to leave so disappointed and I
[35:42] thank you for that tonight Lord I plate
[35:44] you breasts bless the word speak to my
[35:47] heart lord I need much from you father
[35:49] pray you would grant it jesus name amen
[35:51] you can be seated
[36:02] I wanna I got a thought tonight I had
[36:07] this thought I had went to New York
[36:12] again with brother leaning on sister
[36:14] Lois several months back and I had
[36:18] preached a message there for brother
[36:20] Robert and I've got some thoughts out of
[36:23] that and I had a sermon on my computer
[36:25] from back in oh nine and I had some
[36:28] thoughts on that and I kind of put him
[36:32] together in Wednesday night I come to
[36:34] church and brother Donnie preached both
[36:35] of those sermons
[36:37] so I told brother Jimmy I want to try to
[36:41] come at it a little different angle I
[36:44] feel like if the Lord gave it to me I
[36:46] don't feel right to change my thought so
[36:51] with you'll pray and help me we'll get
[36:54] through this as they're kind of making a
[36:58] foundation here for what we're going to
[36:59] speak about a represented by a lamb that
[37:02] would be my title tonight and brother
[37:06] Branham said the church in its condition
[37:07] in Jeffersonville in 56 now it's so
[37:11] pleased God that he sent Jesus to the
[37:12] earth but it pleased him to represent
[37:15] him as an animal that animal was the
[37:17] lamb way back in the beginning in the
[37:19] Garden of Eden in the four shadows of
[37:22] the coming of Jesus God sacrificed a
[37:24] lamb to be a substitutionary offering in
[37:26] the four shadows of the coming of Christ
[37:28] now as we read earlier the in in Genesis
[37:31] Bible does not say that God sacrificed a
[37:34] lamb it says he clothed them in skins
[37:37] but the prophet comes and tells that God
[37:40] took a lamb sacrificed him to cover the
[37:43] sins of Adam and Eve I've often wondered
[37:47] why the God before shadow Christ is an
[37:49] animal as a beast but we come to find
[37:51] out that the lamb the reason he chose a
[37:53] lamb a lamb is the meekest and most
[37:56] gentlest of all creatures on earth there
[37:58] is nothing more weaker and generally
[37:59] than a little lamb so innocence not self
[38:01] sustaining it's not arrogant it's a
[38:04] gentle meek little creature when God was
[38:06] going to represent Christ of the world
[38:08] he represent him as a lamb
[38:11] and to words we're going to look at the
[38:14] meaning them it's very simple it's
[38:16] nothing deep here to represent to take
[38:19] the place of in some respect to act in
[38:22] the place of or for usually by legal
[38:25] right and a sacrifice the act of
[38:29] offering to a deity something precious
[38:31] and he in the lexicons got the sacrifice
[38:36] to slaughter in divine judgment and what
[38:40] we're looking at first here is we see
[38:42] that God has Adam and Eve we know the
[38:44] reason why Adam and Eve by the Branham
[38:46] said that he had a conference he pulled
[38:48] Adam and Eve in the serpent underneath
[38:51] the tree there in the garden he had a
[38:54] conference with him and we kind of look
[38:56] at it like this is the first trial ever
[38:59] on the face of the earth God holds court
[39:02] in the garden he starts handing out
[39:05] penalties now by right Adam and Eve
[39:08] should have been killed and innocent
[39:11] spiritually they were their eternal life
[39:15] ended that day that they took from the
[39:17] tree and they were cast out of the
[39:18] garden but if you know anything about
[39:22] the way the judicial system works the
[39:25] brother branham always said the natural
[39:27] types of spiritual and I know some of
[39:30] the brothers by the way and brother
[39:31] Matthew but telling some of them are
[39:33] familiar with the way the court system
[39:38] works way the judge the judge at any
[39:41] time can appoint anybody any attorney in
[39:43] the courtroom to take a case if it
[39:46] worked the way God had it worked in our
[39:50] judicial system that wouldn't but the
[39:53] Matthew he'd be in quite a situation
[39:55] because you'd have to take the penalty
[39:56] for your client when whenever God
[40:01] appointed representation as he did with
[40:06] the Lambs down through time the way the
[40:10] children of Israel sacrifice her lambs
[40:11] that lamb basically became their
[40:14] attorney became their representation of
[40:17] their sins and their sins was laid upon
[40:20] their attorney and the death penalty was
[40:23] laid upon their return
[40:25] till we look at the first trial Adam and
[40:29] Eve sin that they need a covering they
[40:31] they realize they're naked before God
[40:35] they realized their sin as we know Adam
[40:39] sinned wilfully he was not deceived as
[40:41] receive so God appoints them
[40:43] representation through the lamb if we
[40:48] could look at their sin in the penalty
[40:52] they knew the law they knew that the
[40:55] penalty for the sin was death they knew
[40:57] that if I do what God says not to do I'm
[41:03] going to die so why would Adam do this
[41:07] which we know brother Bantam said he
[41:09] typed Christ being not deceived took
[41:13] took his bride but we know all of this
[41:18] had to take place of God to lay out the
[41:20] type scale out the four shadows of of
[41:22] Calvary of your sins being laid upon
[41:25] Christ but here Adam falls he takes the
[41:28] entire race with him
[41:31] we know that Satan takes the deed to the
[41:35] earth and everything in earth God still
[41:38] holds the abstract so he leaves walking
[41:43] out of the garden wearing these bloody
[41:44] skins now God didn't take time to kill
[41:49] these lambs I lay out the skin tannin
[41:52] salt it scrape it get it nice and warm
[41:56] and fuzzy to put on Adam and Eve as they
[41:59] leave the garden the blood is what Adam
[42:04] has to have for covering it's not the
[42:07] skin itself God required the blood but
[42:12] Lybrand have said in conferences I can
[42:13] imagine God our Father down in the
[42:16] Garden of Eden looking around to find a
[42:17] certain tree to where he could call his
[42:19] children up and do his presents under
[42:21] the tree he selected a place he called
[42:23] that conference and he stood Adam and
[42:24] Eve in the Serpent and there was a
[42:27] conference held they had trespassed the
[42:29] laws and his laws were just a must the
[42:32] penalty must be paid how are they going
[42:35] to live after the death sentence hang
[42:37] on them and there was a conference held
[42:39] there was a perpetuation made for that
[42:42] sin and temporarily until the woman's
[42:44] seed was to bruise the Serpent's head
[42:46] that would pay the full penalty of sin
[42:49] that Islam was sacrificed
[42:51] until there was to be until that would
[42:53] time to be fulfilled there was something
[42:55] that was achieved there was something
[42:57] done that was great a way that man could
[43:00] be saved again so God is laying out a
[43:03] type not as God's just not passing
[43:06] judgment on Adam and Eve and casting
[43:08] them out of the garden just because he
[43:11] could God is trying to lay a foundation
[43:16] of what is to come he's also laying a
[43:21] revelation of what already happened was
[43:26] that able comes along and then Abel
[43:29] brother branham said Abel actually had a
[43:30] revelation actually saw in faith once
[43:35] delivered to the Saints God gave Abel a
[43:37] revelation of what the plan of salvation
[43:39] was so Abel has a revelation of what
[43:43] took place in the garden Abel has a
[43:45] revelation of what white this required
[43:48] blood he has a revelation that it takes
[43:51] a lamb now I don't think that Abel just
[43:55] when he gets this revelation he runs
[43:57] into his little flock of sheep there
[43:59] grabs a lamb out and goes throws on the
[44:02] rock and starts hacking and beating on
[44:04] it
[44:04] what type of lamb did God require the
[44:09] type of lamby required which we know in
[44:11] in Leviticus when he starts talking
[44:14] about revealing to Moses the type of
[44:17] lamb that the children of Israel have to
[44:19] bring for a sin offering has to be
[44:22] without blemish has to be a firstborn of
[44:24] a ewe lamb of the you sheep could be no
[44:27] fault in this lamb and Abel knows the
[44:31] only way he's going back as he offers
[44:34] the same offering that God required
[44:38] so I would say that Abel he probably had
[44:42] a favorite lamb that that he had and no
[44:49] doubt when he gets this lamb
[44:50] maybe he spends days weeks maybe a month
[44:55] inspecting this lamb making sure that
[44:58] it's just right
[44:59] making sure it's eating the right things
[45:01] making sure that there's no blemish he
[45:05] goes through it searches it day in day
[45:08] out this is the lamb he's going to take
[45:10] before God
[45:11] you can't give God just anything you
[45:14] can't just give you sacrifice something
[45:17] for God god I'm gonna miss my dessert
[45:20] today because I'm gonna fast so I'm not
[45:22] going to eat that pie it don't work that
[45:24] way you you you sacrifice things that
[45:29] are going to maybe hurt you a little bit
[45:31] they're going to affect your life a
[45:33] little bit so Abel was going to give up
[45:36] something that affected his life so Abel
[45:41] finds out about this trial that happened
[45:44] in the Garden of Eden he finds out that
[45:45] God had passed judgment he didn't find
[45:47] out from his mother
[45:48] but Brenham said to the mother taught
[45:51] Cain that it was fruits talk Cain that
[45:55] it was the fine things of the earth that
[45:57] God required she fed Cain false doctrine
[46:00] Abel didn't fall for that so by faith
[46:04] but the Bram said that Abel's saw the
[46:07] crucifixion by revelation before the
[46:09] foundation there he had the revelation
[46:10] that Jesus Christ was crucified so here
[46:14] he's going to bring his sacrifice now as
[46:17] he takes this lamb and he's inspected it
[46:20] days weeks he's going to bring this
[46:23] before God as he starts as he lays it up
[46:27] there I'm sure maybe he said a prayer
[46:30] over it before he he began to - brother
[46:33] Brennan said begin a hack on it his
[46:34] throat with the rock and I'm sure blood
[46:37] was was going everywhere and the blood
[46:42] of this lamb began to fall all over Abel
[46:48] let's say just to dramatize a little bit
[46:51] he's sacrificing his favorite lamb the
[46:55] lamb dies he holds his lamb beer more
[46:59] than anything in the world no doubt he
[47:03] falls over the lamb weeping for what he
[47:06] had to give up for what he had to
[47:10] sacrifice and his Adam leaves the altar
[47:13] he's covered in the blood of the Lamb
[47:20] most sisters whenever you come to Christ
[47:23] when you accept that sacrifice it's
[47:27] going to get on you that's the only way
[47:30] that God looks at you is through the
[47:31] blood when he looks at you he sees the
[47:34] blood of the Lamb that's the only hope
[47:37] you had whenever the children of Israel
[47:41] would would sacrifice the Bible tells us
[47:45] that the type of land that they had to
[47:48] bring as a sin offering the lambs were
[47:52] had to be washed they had to wash there
[47:54] was a type of back water baptism they
[47:55] had to wash the land most for years the
[48:01] children of Israel the Jews even after
[48:03] Christ was crucified they still
[48:06] sacrifice lambs because they did not
[48:09] believe that Jesus was the sacrifice of
[48:12] actually sacrifice lambs up to what they
[48:15] call 70 seee which is the Christian era
[48:19] they don't use a B because a DV stands
[48:21] for year of our Lord and they do not
[48:23] recognize him as their Lord but they
[48:25] sacrifice lambs until the Roman Empire
[48:29] tore their temple down and this was
[48:32] something that that they held to the
[48:36] highest standards was their sacrifices
[48:41] so here Abel has this sacrifice that
[48:46] he's bringing let's read this in the
[48:50] power of God Chicago the Bible wasn't
[48:54] written in so if Cain his brother who
[48:57] was set under the same teaching the
[48:59] father and mother came down and brought
[49:01] fruit to make
[49:01] offer but able by revelation he saw that
[49:05] it wasn't fruits that brought us out of
[49:06] the Garden of Eden
[49:08] it wasn't your works that brought to you
[49:10] other denominations it wasn't anything
[49:13] that you could bring anything
[49:15] God didn't in fact God says everything
[49:19] that you have let's get rid of let's
[49:21] leave it in Egypt okay so here he's
[49:25] telling Abel you've got to have the
[49:31] revelation that your mom didn't get but
[49:37] it wasn't fruit soon as the blood of his
[49:39] mother brother Bram says or his father
[49:41] so he came and offered the blood of a
[49:43] lamb by divine revelation no one to tell
[49:46] him anything about it but he by faith
[49:48] he's seen the Son of God coming and he
[49:51] offered a lamb in a figurative type
[49:53] seeing that Jesus was the lamb slain
[49:55] before the foundation of the world he
[49:57] testified and God testified that's the
[50:00] truth God will also will always testify
[50:03] that's the truth so Abel actually some
[50:06] prophecies April actually saw that Jesus
[50:10] Christ was the lamb only a prophet could
[50:14] see that only a prophet could see the
[50:18] revelation that Abel had the revelation
[50:20] that Joe had let's look at Joe he had
[50:23] the same revelation that Adam had that
[50:25] day you had but look at Joe Bob Ram said
[50:30] there there's one coming to to put him
[50:32] in back in the way this is in God's
[50:35] provided way it says oh when I think of
[50:38] that my innermost being screams out what
[50:40] can I do what what can I do to get to
[50:43] this man there's coming one who will
[50:45] place him back to where the one will
[50:47] stand and put his hand and the gap of
[50:50] sin here well he will go in and take sin
[50:52] upon himself and bridge the way back
[50:54] that man came out of the ground again
[50:58] Butler Bram says Joe begin to see it in
[51:02] beginning and ending of Gentile
[51:04] disposition but Branham says the morning
[51:06] stars shouted for joy you ever you ever
[51:11] heard them why you ever anybody ever
[51:15] heard
[51:15] and said why the Morningstar shouted for
[51:18] joy I didn't I read this to just this I
[51:22] think a few months ago them shining one
[51:26] shattered for joy when they seen I'm
[51:29] sorry I'm getting no seeing that someday
[51:35] through a tabernacle here on earth the
[51:36] King Melchizedek would come in the
[51:38] righteousness of God give us a life to
[51:40] redeem us back to God again and outshine
[51:43] the Stars forever job catches this
[51:45] revelation the only reason why Joe God
[51:48] has to show him before he reveals to him
[51:52] the but the resurrection he has to show
[51:56] him something Joe where were you when
[51:58] the Stars had a for joy where the
[52:00] morning the sons of God shouted for joy
[52:01] where were you at so why did they shout
[52:04] for joy why was it King Melchizedek why
[52:09] is it is King make Melchizedek gonna be
[52:14] the one to redeem them back because it's
[52:17] gonna take a sacrifice
[52:18] no Keswick was the high priest only the
[52:21] high priest can make the sacrifice only
[52:24] the high priest could slay the lamb so
[52:28] here job sees a revelation
[52:31] who brings a revelation to him a prophet
[52:34] brother bran said the little prophet
[52:36] Ellie here he began to listen to this
[52:40] little prophet Ellie you faith comes by
[52:43] hearing the first thing you know God
[52:46] raised Jobe raised up God put his
[52:48] Pinnock binoculars down over his eyes he
[52:50] looked away down four thousand years and
[52:52] said I know my Redeemer liveth until
[52:54] last days he will stand on the earth
[52:56] though the skin worms destroy this body
[52:57] yet in my flesh shall see God whom I was
[53:01] seating myself mine own eyes shall
[53:03] behold and no other he saw the
[53:05] resurrection of Christ so Joe has a
[53:09] revelation something had to die what'd
[53:13] he say he called him my Redeemer
[53:14] how do what how would the hell would he
[53:17] redeem Joe joke knew he was destined to
[53:20] die
[53:20] Jobe knew he was going by the way of the
[53:22] grave look at all the sacrifices did Joe
[53:25] sacrifice daily job
[53:29] first sacrifice for himself if you read
[53:31] you read that and you read in little
[53:33] Levitical Leviticus God required the
[53:35] high priests to sacrifice one for
[53:37] themselves first before they sacrificed
[53:39] the sin offering for the sinner and this
[53:43] was in case there was any sin on the
[53:45] priests job caught the same revelation
[53:47] in case I have sinned in any way when I
[53:50] offered the sin offering for my my
[53:52] children in Chicago in 55 brother
[54:01] branham priests law now in the Old
[54:04] Testament for of the sinner come in to
[54:05] offer for himself a sacrifice he had to
[54:09] find we know all in type how it must be
[54:11] a land without a blemish it must be
[54:14] brought from the sin offering what had
[54:18] to be from the first sheep from his
[54:19] first sheep from the old mother you and
[54:21] had to be without must be without
[54:23] blemish it must be brought up and
[54:25] sacrificed and died for the sins of the
[54:27] people notice then if a man who man who
[54:30] done the something evil committed
[54:32] adultery took the Lord's name in vain or
[54:34] broke the commandments he brought the
[54:36] lamb to the priest the lamb was washed
[54:38] and so forth typifying water baptism he
[54:41] brought the lamb up and confessed his
[54:43] sins before the priest what had done the
[54:45] evil that he did and the priest the note
[54:47] was made of that and was put on the book
[54:49] if that man does same sin two times in a
[54:52] year he died without mercy that's one
[54:57] thing that the lamb the sin offerings
[54:59] done for the children of Israel they
[55:03] didn't give him the ultimate sacrifice
[55:05] it didn't cover their sins as Christ in
[55:09] this was something had to be done year
[55:12] after year after year he would take the
[55:16] sin that the sacrifice he were laid upon
[55:19] the altar he would confess his false
[55:23] after the lamb was washed he was
[55:26] inspected for blemishes the high priest
[55:30] announces there's no fault in the lamb
[55:34] the man lays his hands on the head of
[55:36] the lamb and the priest kills the lamb
[55:38] he hacks and cuts on the lamb the blood
[55:41] of the lamb begins to
[55:42] get on the center and he is covered by
[55:44] the live source of the lamb when he left
[55:47] the sacrifice people would look at him
[55:50] and see he had received representation
[55:52] from the lamb by the blood that was on
[55:54] him let's say this sinner leaves the
[55:58] tabernacle after offering is sacrificed
[56:00] he goes down the road he goes home he's
[56:04] got blood all over him everybody knew
[56:08] where he'd been they could not cues him
[56:11] of anything no matter what he had done
[56:14] he could not be accused the blood of the
[56:17] lamb was on him when God looks at you
[56:21] what what if God looks at you without
[56:24] the blood as we I was talking about when
[56:28] we first started the way the the judge
[56:33] would appoint an attorney for your case
[56:37] one of the things that had added to this
[56:40] message being on my heart I was sitting
[56:43] in court a few months ago waiting on a
[56:47] case that I had in this they take please
[56:49] they're in the court and they do
[56:51] arraignment the Reimann is to let you
[56:56] know what your rights are and to appoint
[56:59] you attorney or see if you can afford
[57:01] one this young man walks up to the the
[57:05] podium before the judge and the judge
[57:06] asked him do you know what your rights
[57:08] are he says yes do you know you had can
[57:12] you afford attorney No look at the photo
[57:14] you won't want to point it to you he
[57:16] said no and this message was already on
[57:21] my heart then and and I really had to
[57:24] think and he he doesn't have a chance
[57:26] he's got no one to represent him he's
[57:29] going to stand before a judge with no
[57:31] representation he don't know the law
[57:33] all's he knows is his rights he knows I
[57:36] have a right to an attorney but he
[57:38] turned it down there's many in this in
[57:41] this day in this last age that had the
[57:43] right to attorney brother Graham said
[57:46] Christ was your attorney
[57:49] you had your right to attorney and you
[57:51] turned it down because you thought you
[57:55] knew what was best you thought that your
[57:59] knowledge of the word your knowledge of
[58:01] the Scriptures of the quotes you didn't
[58:04] need anybody to tell you what to do
[58:06] you're gonna stand before God without
[58:09] the blood because you turned down your
[58:11] attorney and it just sad me and I
[58:14] thought I've been in court I don't know
[58:17] how many times I've seen if you try to
[58:18] do by the math you can tell you the same
[58:22] thing they get in there then you got a
[58:24] clue what they're doing I don't think
[58:26] I've ever seen one win one yet they go
[58:30] in there with I don't know I mean it's
[58:33] free you can afford an attorney won't be
[58:35] upon represent you how easy is that I
[58:39] mean that that's just the same thing
[58:43] you've been offered he didn't even ask
[58:45] you if you wanted to afford one he just
[58:47] said I'll give you one so how could how
[58:52] could you turn it down
[58:57] why was why was the blood why did God
[59:01] required the blood the most why what
[59:03] about the blood was so important why was
[59:06] it blood why was it not something nice
[59:11] like gold silver why was it blood why
[59:15] would the God require him this but a
[59:20] brand of said in Christ in 55 and
[59:24] through the blood you become part of him
[59:27] into the same cell that he came out of
[59:31] you became him into the same cell that
[59:35] he came out of the same part of Christ
[59:40] that came out of God is the same part
[59:42] that you come out of you've got to be
[59:45] identified with that blood whenever God
[59:50] you you have to become part of their
[59:52] blood but but becomes you so when God
[59:55] looks at you and sees the blood of
[59:58] Christ he sees you with the life of
[1:00:02] Christ
[1:00:03] has to recognize the life that's why it
[1:00:05] would took blood because God had to
[1:00:07] recognize the life and the very presence
[1:00:11] of it I'm Becca and uh and through the
[1:00:15] blood you become part of him into the
[1:00:17] same cell that he came out of and the
[1:00:19] very presence and part of God comes into
[1:00:23] you by faith you purchase it and the
[1:00:26] same Holy Spirit that was in the Lord
[1:00:28] Jesus Christ comes into you let's look
[1:00:37] at your lamb for a little bit sees Jesus
[1:00:41] comes we've read briefly about him about
[1:00:45] his birth at twelve years old and then
[1:00:47] it fades away and then we pick him up at
[1:00:49] the age of thirty John's one of the
[1:00:53] first one to catch the revelation of who
[1:00:54] he was so here comes your lamb down to
[1:00:58] the River Jordan as your lamb comes down
[1:01:02] John announces him behold the lamb who
[1:01:05] takes away the sins of the world
[1:01:07] so he's announced the lamb what is the
[1:01:11] next procedure for the lamb it's going
[1:01:13] to be sacrificed has to be washed so the
[1:01:18] Prophet typifying the high priest washes
[1:01:22] the sacrifice what happens after that
[1:01:27] the Lambs washed why did he not go
[1:01:30] directly from the water to the cross
[1:01:35] he's got to be inspected for faults he's
[1:01:39] got to be inspected for mistakes he has
[1:01:41] to be checked for blemishes immediately
[1:01:45] Satan tries to find fault in tries to
[1:01:49] tempt him in for a blemish look at him
[1:01:54] three and a half years he's washed in
[1:01:57] the River Jordan he goes through trials
[1:01:58] temptations ridiculed inspected for
[1:02:00] three and a half years maybes he that
[1:02:04] does that he comes before the highest
[1:02:06] person in the land which is Pilate and
[1:02:07] Pilate says I find no fault in him
[1:02:10] phylla pilot just announces the lamb is
[1:02:14] ready for sacrifice don't even know what
[1:02:17] he's doing but Ram said well God when it
[1:02:22] comes to God's sacrifice he does not
[1:02:24] change the same work requirement that's
[1:02:27] why he told Moses how to tell the priest
[1:02:30] how to do it how to wash it had
[1:02:32] inspected how to prepare it for the
[1:02:35] sacrifice so here he goes the highest
[1:02:40] voice in the land which is Pilate
[1:02:41] announces Christ is now ready for
[1:02:44] sacrifice who's going to kill him who's
[1:02:50] going to take the life of this lamb this
[1:02:53] is your representation this is your
[1:02:55] attorney in a minute we're going to
[1:02:58] we're going to put you in the courtroom
[1:02:59] with him but here is your sacrifice
[1:03:03] Christ said I put my own life down I
[1:03:07] take it up no man would take his life
[1:03:09] but who's required to take the life of
[1:03:12] this sacrifice it's Melchizedek you read
[1:03:20] that again if I can find it here
[1:03:33] kingman milk hesitant would come in the
[1:03:35] righteousness of God and give his life
[1:03:37] to redeem us back to God again and
[1:03:40] outshine the Stars forever and ever
[1:03:43] so Melchizedek is the high priest which
[1:03:47] we know brother Branham said in when he
[1:03:49] when he meant Abraham it was Christ so
[1:03:55] let's let's put you in a courtroom let's
[1:04:00] look at your life that was just trying
[1:04:05] to briefly touch on on the
[1:04:07] representation of the sacrifice but
[1:04:09] let's look at let's look how we started
[1:04:12] out why did we need an attorney why did
[1:04:14] we need representation every one of you
[1:04:17] were raised different conclusion
[1:04:19] nominations some no churches at all some
[1:04:22] in the message you everyone in your life
[1:04:27] you were born condemned but the Brenham
[1:04:30] said you were born condemned got judged
[1:04:32] you before you were even born so we all
[1:04:35] needed attorney so as we come in
[1:04:41] different ways for different paths in
[1:04:43] life you could have never done nothing
[1:04:47] you could have been a good person all
[1:04:49] your life and in that you still were
[1:04:54] seeing in God's sight filthy dirty could
[1:05:00] have been the best person on the face of
[1:05:01] the earth but to God you were trash
[1:05:06] that's that's just the way it is God
[1:05:09] looks through the blood blob random said
[1:05:12] in Hebrews chapter five and six we read
[1:05:16] and where everyone condemned no matter
[1:05:19] what we ever do were condemned we were
[1:05:23] born condemned your mama and your Papa
[1:05:24] were born condemned you all your
[1:05:26] ancestors were born in sins shaped and
[1:05:28] iniquity so how you ever going to get it
[1:05:30] how are you going to be perfect if you
[1:05:33] never done a thing never stole never
[1:05:34] lied never done anything in your life
[1:05:36] you're still condemned you were
[1:05:37] condemned before you breathed your first
[1:05:38] breath you were condemned that's correct
[1:05:40] you were judged of God before you
[1:05:42] breathed your first step we've your
[1:05:44] first breath so let's look at the
[1:05:47] natural type of the spiritual you
[1:05:52] automatically come into life with sins
[1:05:56] so therefore you have to be tried let's
[1:06:00] put your life inside the courtroom the
[1:06:03] day that you get appointed your attorney
[1:06:06] everybody the God is no respecter of
[1:06:09] person everybody is getting an
[1:06:10] arraignment that's where you get a
[1:06:14] pointee journey it's your choice to
[1:06:18] accept it or turn it down so let's look
[1:06:21] at your life Sims were drunks some of us
[1:06:25] ran around on a wife someone have a
[1:06:27] smoked cigarette some of us didn't do
[1:06:29] anything but you're still sinned when
[1:06:36] you all the times you see if you see
[1:06:41] somebody high-profile I don't think it's
[1:06:45] arrested for something a big trial they
[1:06:47] have in the national papers and stuff
[1:06:50] and you see them sit there in a suit all
[1:06:53] nice stretched out then after the trial
[1:06:57] they lead them away and I had always
[1:07:00] wondered why don't these get it run out
[1:07:02] want them run away which at the time I
[1:07:05] didn't know they put on for four
[1:07:09] purposes for to appeal to people they
[1:07:13] put leg irons underneath their pants and
[1:07:15] you can only move
[1:07:17] your legs a certain way such loss you're
[1:07:21] hearing this again so I'm sorry and then
[1:07:25] your legs are only allowed to move just
[1:07:28] a little bit or they'll put what they
[1:07:31] call a belly band on you wish put
[1:07:34] shackles on it and this is the way you
[1:07:37] move you just move a little bit like
[1:07:40] this so this is the way you're going
[1:07:42] through life and your mind you're having
[1:07:45] fun you have no idea that you're doing
[1:07:49] this you have no idea how you're walking
[1:07:52] through life you're having a blast
[1:07:55] you're enjoying every minute of it and
[1:07:59] you're headed to the death penalty and
[1:08:02] you haven't got a clue and this is the
[1:08:03] way you're walking you're shackled
[1:08:05] you're handcuffed you go from the
[1:08:08] courtroom to the prison room you go back
[1:08:10] and forth your leg back and forth and
[1:08:12] that's your life and you're excited
[1:08:14] about it but one day every man has
[1:08:21] appointed an arraignment every woman is
[1:08:25] appointed arraignment so you come to
[1:08:27] court many of you this is the day you
[1:08:30] found Christ there's many people this is
[1:08:35] the day they turn him down so let's look
[1:08:40] at the court setting now your
[1:08:41] prosecuting attorney is Satan many of
[1:08:44] you heard his brother Brandon put Christ
[1:08:45] on trial in the trial the prosecuting
[1:08:48] attorney is Satan we're gonna put you on
[1:08:50] trial now and Christ as your defense
[1:08:52] attorney you're sitting there things in
[1:08:56] your life you starting to notice things
[1:08:58] in your life you're starting to notice
[1:08:59] something's not right you start to
[1:09:05] wonder where am I headed there's more
[1:09:08] than this than what I'm doing
[1:09:10] you start to realize it ain't his fun
[1:09:12] being shackled as you thought it was
[1:09:16] you're starting to realize that I need
[1:09:18] representation so God's the judge and as
[1:09:28] we get ready for this court trial it's
[1:09:31] funny sometimes if you sit in court and
[1:09:32] you watch somebody that's got an
[1:09:34] attorney in their attorney there yet and
[1:09:36] they're Swivl in that head looking for
[1:09:38] him to come in and he's running late and
[1:09:41] I'll tell you what it's it's funny
[1:09:42] sometimes so you look on people's faces
[1:09:43] when they think they're gonna have to
[1:09:45] represent themselves but here you are
[1:09:50] sitting and your attorney walks in let's
[1:09:54] look at the way he walks in the king of
[1:09:57] heaven and all his glory comes into your
[1:10:03] life he's gonna sit beside you he's
[1:10:11] going to tell you you have the right to
[1:10:15] remain silent
[1:10:17] which I suggest you do every attorney
[1:10:22] will tell you that I would suggest that
[1:10:26] you use that right you have the right
[1:10:30] not to be put on the stand I suggest
[1:10:32] that you do that how are you going to
[1:10:35] explain to God your sins
[1:10:40] Satan was able to get you understand how
[1:10:44] are you going to explain to God that you
[1:10:47] did what you did
[1:10:49] you've got no excuse you're found guilty
[1:10:53] already when you walk in so your
[1:10:57] attorney is sitting beside you he's
[1:11:01] telling you your rights one thing about
[1:11:07] it he knows something that you don't
[1:11:08] know
[1:11:13] now Satan comes before God he starts
[1:11:17] pointing out your faults your failures
[1:11:20] and taste that one you get saved you
[1:11:23] accept your attorney and you're set free
[1:11:26] your court trial don't end Satan accuses
[1:11:30] you every day one thing about your
[1:11:34] attorney is pro bono for life
[1:11:37] how many knows what pro bono is it's for
[1:11:41] free he will represent you for free for
[1:11:44] life so the judge God sits there and he
[1:11:52] listens to your life being played out by
[1:11:55] Satan the best thing about it is right
[1:12:00] now it's all facts
[1:12:03] Satan's telling the truth and you're
[1:12:08] you're sitting there thinking if you
[1:12:10] ever sit in a court trial and I'm on the
[1:12:14] whenever I go to trial I'm on the
[1:12:16] prosecuting attorney side and if it's my
[1:12:19] case and I'm listening to the defense
[1:12:21] attorney I'm thinking I'm gonna get beat
[1:12:25] I am gonna get beat because he's just
[1:12:29] laying out the facts but then it's my
[1:12:34] attorneys turn but Satan starts telling
[1:12:39] God all these facts about you you're
[1:12:42] wanting to say something in your offense
[1:12:43] but you your attorney isn't told you to
[1:12:45] be quiet Satan has the jury stacked
[1:12:51] against you I did find something out
[1:12:54] this year about a jury trial that I've
[1:12:55] never known I've been there 14 years and
[1:12:57] I never knew I had a murder case where
[1:13:02] they were trying this man this woman for
[1:13:06] murder and their baby and we presented
[1:13:09] all the evidence and the evidence for
[1:13:14] the prosecutor DA's office was just
[1:13:15] overwhelming and the defense after they
[1:13:20] see the evidence he defense attorney
[1:13:23] stands up
[1:13:24] and as the judge says I move for the
[1:13:27] judge to acquit my client I was thinking
[1:13:32] judge can't do that we have a jury so I
[1:13:37] asked the DA there said can he do that
[1:13:40] he said yeah the judge has power to no
[1:13:44] matter what the evidence is if he says I
[1:13:47] don't see enough evidence no matter what
[1:13:50] the jury says he can let him go you know
[1:13:54] this is like God Satan Satan gave every
[1:13:58] bit of evidence he had in history all
[1:14:01] the evidence was the kiss you in fact
[1:14:04] there's everything that Satan told God
[1:14:05] about you was true
[1:14:07] he had all the facts he had the videos
[1:14:09] he had everything to back it up
[1:14:11] God says I don't see any evidence I
[1:14:14] don't see anything to hold the defendant
[1:14:22] let's look at the witnesses Satan puts
[1:14:25] on the stand against you he puts temper
[1:14:27] up their temper says yeah about three or
[1:14:35] four times a week me and him parted
[1:14:39] bitterness he puts bitterness up there
[1:14:43] yeah he's bitter he don't he'll care
[1:14:46] care what the pasture has to say
[1:14:47] he gets it walks out lust unbelief
[1:14:55] addiction depression they all take the
[1:15:01] stand against you then God just sits
[1:15:04] there and listens remember this is just
[1:15:08] your arraignment this is when you accept
[1:15:11] your attorney after you accept your
[1:15:12] eternity after you accept your attorney
[1:15:15] God won't listen to him anymore
[1:15:18] he stands before God night and day
[1:15:21] accusing you and God does not hear you
[1:15:25] because you've got representation
[1:15:31] seyton presents the facts against you
[1:15:34] they testify there comes a certain twist
[1:15:39] to this case God looks at all the
[1:15:48] evidence than any tales tell Satan I
[1:15:53] don't see any evidence because I've laid
[1:15:56] it all on his attorney now in a court
[1:16:01] trial the attorneys have the right to
[1:16:05] approach the bench
[1:16:06] one will not approach without the other
[1:16:08] if the event says Your Honor may I
[1:16:10] approach
[1:16:12] prosecutor Kearney goes with you vice
[1:16:15] versa because they're not going to let
[1:16:17] him hear anything that he says the judge
[1:16:19] that he can't hear so he lays his sins
[1:16:27] on your attorney and your attorney has
[1:16:32] to take the penalty let's put this on
[1:16:39] Jesus for a minute here's your attorney
[1:16:41] he's in the court trial with you he's
[1:16:43] sitting there he came in radiant king of
[1:16:48] glory and all of a sudden God says I'm
[1:16:54] laying your sins on him in the Garden of
[1:16:59] Gethsemane Jesus request to approach the
[1:17:02] bench
[1:17:08] you think he already knew this was going
[1:17:11] to happen he already knew that your sins
[1:17:15] were going to be laid on him but he
[1:17:18] approaches the benches is Your Honor is
[1:17:22] there any way we could do anything else
[1:17:24] here what's your sins
[1:17:27] look you're saying did you want him did
[1:17:30] you want the sins that were laid upon
[1:17:31] you but why would you want your sins to
[1:17:34] be laid upon the King of glory and here
[1:17:37] they are he approaches the bench in the
[1:17:40] garden do you think Satan was gonna let
[1:17:43] him approach that
[1:17:44] without him being there but one thing
[1:17:48] about it
[1:17:49] Satan took his papers with him to the
[1:17:51] bench he's held the papers the deed to
[1:17:55] your life he should have left him at the
[1:17:58] table because when he approached the
[1:18:01] bench God reaches over and takes him
[1:18:05] from me
[1:18:06] so not only are your sins late on the
[1:18:11] king of heaven God takes the day back
[1:18:15] and all this is for free then cost you a
[1:18:19] dime
[1:18:22] and those those of you that have
[1:18:24] accepted your attorney have accepted the
[1:18:27] fact that your life no matter what your
[1:18:31] life was before
[1:18:32] how many would go back how many would
[1:18:34] undo what's been done for you how many
[1:18:38] would trade to go back hey when I lived
[1:18:41] in the world I had fun I had fun I
[1:18:44] enjoyed it you can't sit there and say
[1:18:46] you didn't you did your mang overs
[1:18:49] weren't great but hey they were going
[1:18:51] away soon that's just the way life was
[1:18:55] it was exciting so he approaches the
[1:19:00] bench he asked the father Lord if it'd
[1:19:02] be like we loved this cup pass from me
[1:19:08] now brother BAM tells us in the gardens
[1:19:11] where God left him yeah I used to think
[1:19:16] God left him because he wanted to see
[1:19:18] what God what Christ would do that
[1:19:20] wasn't the case he left him because God
[1:19:24] will never touch sin sin will never
[1:19:26] touch God in the sins of the world were
[1:19:28] getting ready to be laid upon your
[1:19:30] attorney and the judge pulled himself
[1:19:33] away so he walks out never wondered what
[1:19:42] he felt like I wonder what he felt like
[1:19:45] just of my sins at 44 years just of the
[1:19:49] sins that I had that were laid upon him
[1:19:51] how would he feel just if my sins were
[1:19:53] laid upon him let alone the world
[1:20:00] John 3:16 was fulfilled then for the
[1:20:03] world God gave His only begotten Son
[1:20:05] that all men all men may be saved not
[1:20:10] will be but maybe that's a choice that's
[1:20:15] where the may be saved occurs at the
[1:20:20] arraignment you can accept your attorney
[1:20:23] or you can try to take the stand for
[1:20:26] yourself so he's
[1:20:30] you remember how you walked in the
[1:20:32] courtroom you walked in shackled moving
[1:20:36] just like this that's the way your
[1:20:39] attorney walked out your attorney walked
[1:20:42] out shackled with your sins shackled
[1:20:44] with your leg arms shackled with your
[1:20:46] bitterness he walked out with temper he
[1:20:48] walked out with lust he walked out with
[1:20:49] unbelief every sin that you've ever
[1:20:53] committed Christ walks out of the
[1:20:55] courtroom with your sin attached to him
[1:21:02] you've gotten you have no excuse
[1:21:05] you have no excuse when you had an
[1:21:08] opportunity to get representation on
[1:21:12] that day you'll either have
[1:21:13] representation now or you won't have it
[1:21:16] there you'll have a no excuse your whole
[1:21:19] life will be played out before you but
[1:21:23] Branum said he murdered God murdered his
[1:21:25] own son and it pleased him Adam was
[1:21:29] given a decision in the garden he chose
[1:21:31] to take his bride sin on himself he
[1:21:33] wasn't deceived he chose to go with her
[1:21:35] Jesus was also chosen given a choice in
[1:21:38] the garden and he said not my will but
[1:21:41] your will be done he chose to take the
[1:21:43] sin of his bride upon himself and walked
[1:21:45] out of the garden to his death Adam also
[1:21:47] walked out of the garden to his death
[1:21:51] look at the fourth seal Bob Ram Sinha
[1:21:54] has long looked look as long as the
[1:21:56] intercessor still him thrown Satan can
[1:21:58] stand there and accused because he's the
[1:22:00] attorney afore the other side he's the
[1:22:02] opponent of Christ and Christ is
[1:22:04] standing there the opponent is standing
[1:22:06] there saying but wait Adam fail Adam
[1:22:08] done this I conquered him I got his wife
[1:22:10] to believe a lie and you said she'd be
[1:22:13] damned and I got it but here's the
[1:22:15] mediator standing there the kinsman
[1:22:17] redeemer by the brendham says a man
[1:22:19] standing there with the blood that can
[1:22:22] take the vial of sinners heart and
[1:22:23] change it a mediator is on the throne
[1:22:25] yes sir
[1:22:27] Satan said they're guilty jesus said
[1:22:28] they're not
[1:22:32] many of you you've got scenes you're
[1:22:35] ashamed of I do everybody does you got
[1:22:39] things in your life but probably nobody
[1:22:40] knows every one of us do it's shame it's
[1:22:46] because of shame and he walked out with
[1:22:50] that shame take your deepest darkest
[1:22:53] secret that you've got the worst thing
[1:22:58] you've ever done that nobody knows about
[1:23:00] and he walked out with it no one will
[1:23:04] ever know no one I ever know it'll never
[1:23:08] be played on that day you've got an
[1:23:10] assurance that because your attorney
[1:23:13] took that it'll never ever be brought up
[1:23:16] again
[1:23:19] they have what they call an expungement
[1:23:22] or judicial diversion if you if you
[1:23:27] enter a plea if you enter a plea that
[1:23:29] after you finish your time that they'll
[1:23:31] take this off the book
[1:23:34] Satan's always wanting to get you to
[1:23:36] enter a plea
[1:23:37] just admit you've done this just admit
[1:23:41] you done that and then after a short
[1:23:44] period of time once we get this all
[1:23:46] worked out we'll forget it
[1:23:48] God don't work that way you've got to
[1:23:50] say you must think you're dumb because
[1:23:52] you know your attorneys gonna get it
[1:23:54] wiped off the slate clean never to be
[1:23:56] brought up again boning the sea of
[1:23:58] forgetfulness so why would you take a
[1:24:00] plea for the easy way out just to just
[1:24:04] to enjoy a brief more time of
[1:24:06] worldliness of excitement Satan will get
[1:24:10] you take a plea just so you can you know
[1:24:13] have a little more fun over here skip
[1:24:16] Church here I can't make it today I
[1:24:20] can't read today I can't pray today
[1:24:25] sometimes God's Way he's gonna be the
[1:24:29] hard way
[1:24:31] Satan's gonna make it look awful easy
[1:24:33] for you so what was your death what was
[1:24:39] your penalty your penalty was death you
[1:24:42] were destined to die that's the death
[1:24:46] penalty like I was saying earlier I've
[1:24:49] got to be an attorney nowadays and
[1:24:51] they've run a courtroom that way if your
[1:24:54] attorney gets you off he takes the
[1:24:56] penalty you'd have brother Matthew and
[1:24:59] all these other attorneys be trying to
[1:25:01] get civil litigation cases and divorce
[1:25:03] cases and everything else they would
[1:25:04] have to do any criminal law wouldn't
[1:25:07] have no attorneys left
[1:25:08] they'll be I'll be in jail or killed so
[1:25:16] here we are is your lamb walks out of
[1:25:20] the courtroom carrying your sins takes
[1:25:24] them to hell well Bram said his soul
[1:25:27] went to hell his body was in the grave
[1:25:28] bit of spirit went to God and he took
[1:25:30] your sins to hell
[1:25:32] kicked in the door and threw him inside
[1:25:36] yet how many times is satan reach down
[1:25:38] in there and pull them out and hand them
[1:25:40] to you and you take him back God's
[1:25:45] already said you didn't do it God's
[1:25:48] already said you've paid the price it's
[1:25:51] been wiped clean and Satan will take
[1:25:53] your sins he'll take somebody else's sin
[1:25:55] in the church and hand it to you and you
[1:25:57] bring it up that sins been head to hell
[1:26:01] once why not put it back they were put
[1:26:06] there in hell for a reason because
[1:26:08] that's where they belong they don't
[1:26:09] belong in your mouth they don't belong
[1:26:11] in your head you take a look besides you
[1:26:14] look at somebody besides you and that is
[1:26:17] somebody that went to the same thing you
[1:26:19] went through with you the courtroom had
[1:26:22] that same God of heaven is their
[1:26:24] attorney who died for them who gave his
[1:26:27] life for them and you don't like them
[1:26:32] God found him worthy God found them
[1:26:37] worthy to be give eternal life he loved
[1:26:40] them enough and you're sitting here
[1:26:42] saying that you have the blood of Christ
[1:26:44] all over you what comes with the blood
[1:26:47] the life you'll have the same life but
[1:26:54] that's flesh that's flesh I can't help
[1:26:55] I'm gonna have a little flesh God ain't
[1:26:58] coming after flesh God ain't coming
[1:27:01] after flesh until you get this under
[1:27:03] subjection hey we're gonna have a little
[1:27:06] bit of flesh until we get out of here
[1:27:09] but that's where the Holy Spirit takes
[1:27:11] over that's where the life of Christ
[1:27:14] takes over this flesh and if God found
[1:27:18] somebody worthy that he would die and
[1:27:20] take all their sins and give his life
[1:27:21] murder his own son and we want to back
[1:27:26] bite him we want to talk about him we
[1:27:29] don't like to be around them
[1:27:33] your opinion must be greater than gods
[1:27:38] gods coming after a body he's coming
[1:27:43] after a body that is in a likeness of
[1:27:45] Christ the bridegroom that's what he's
[1:27:49] coming after what does a body do a body
[1:27:53] coexist
[1:27:54] it helps itself it's one unit it cannot
[1:28:01] be divided God is not coming after a
[1:28:02] divided body and that's where we get to
[1:28:07] the point to where once the bride
[1:28:08] recognizes who she is and we'll get out
[1:28:10] of here
[1:28:10] you can't recognize who you are if
[1:28:12] you're fighting with yourself it don't
[1:28:16] work that way but Graham said
[1:28:22] condemnation about representation I'll
[1:28:24] never forsake him because he represents
[1:28:26] me a man he is my Savior because that he
[1:28:29] died for me I'm worthy because he took
[1:28:32] me as his own he became me that I became
[1:28:36] him I might become him he became a
[1:28:38] sinner and took my sins that I might be
[1:28:40] a son of God so Christ becomes you takes
[1:28:48] your sins you become him in order for
[1:28:53] that testimony to be true in your life
[1:28:55] you'd have to take on that life you have
[1:28:59] to accept that like we're saying when
[1:29:01] that sinner laid his hands on that
[1:29:03] sacrifice and that priest would hack and
[1:29:06] beat and cut on that lamb and that blood
[1:29:08] would spray on that sinner he went home
[1:29:12] with representation where he had been
[1:29:16] you will leave that courtroom with
[1:29:18] representation of where have you been
[1:29:20] the sacrifice if you fully accepted
[1:29:24] their sacrifice it'll get all over you
[1:29:26] you can't help it it's a mess
[1:29:28] it's it's a bloody mess that's the only
[1:29:32] thing God looks at is the off spray of
[1:29:35] that lamb the cast off the blood
[1:29:38] splattered on you you can't wash it off
[1:29:42] Pilate tried Pilate tried to wash it off
[1:29:45] he won't wash off it'll need to be
[1:29:49] testify against you or it'll testify for
[1:29:51] you so where does this lamb go he goes
[1:29:58] to hell take your sins has bodies in the
[1:30:00] grave his spirit goes to God he comes
[1:30:04] back he goes to get glorified let's look
[1:30:09] at John is caught up in the vision and
[1:30:13] he sees your attorney what did he see
[1:30:18] said the Lion of the tribe of Judah he
[1:30:22] turned around he's seen a bloody lamb
[1:30:24] this this is one of my favorite quotes
[1:30:27] I've probably read it here before so
[1:30:28] forgive me this is in the breach John
[1:30:32] looked at that lamb and the lamb looked
[1:30:34] like he'd been slain he noticed he was
[1:30:36] wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding
[1:30:38] a bloody lamb that's what took our place
[1:30:41] isn't that strange a simple lamb had to
[1:30:43] take our place and he saw the lamb he
[1:30:46] proceeded out John hadn't saw him you
[1:30:50] remember the scripture in Revelations it
[1:30:53] says John looked there was no one found
[1:30:55] worthy couldn't find anyone John didn't
[1:30:58] see the lamb yet the elder had not said
[1:31:02] behold the Lion of Judah he hadn't seen
[1:31:04] him yet he's already caught up in heaven
[1:31:07] he's already caught in the vision he's
[1:31:10] been there for a little while and he
[1:31:12] hasn't seen the Lamb yet he has seen no
[1:31:15] one that's worthy but we had a
[1:31:19] seventh-day message tell us where the
[1:31:20] lamb was that when John was looking for
[1:31:22] me
[1:31:24] to John head son because he had been way
[1:31:27] back into the eternities even making
[1:31:30] intercession and showing that those had
[1:31:32] come to God under the offering of bulls
[1:31:34] and goats substitute offering so where's
[1:31:38] he yet what if a voice could have spoke
[1:31:40] to John and said John just be patient
[1:31:42] Abel's blood is still streaming out the
[1:31:45] blood of Abel screw of sacrifices to
[1:31:47] crying out to God job's sacrifices are
[1:31:50] still crying out every children of
[1:31:52] Israel that offered sin offering to
[1:31:54] Christ to God it was it had to be
[1:31:57] redeemed those sacrifices did not give
[1:32:00] them eternal life they covered their sin
[1:32:03] for that year that's it
[1:32:05] so Christ the Lamb he slain John's
[1:32:09] looking for him he's not there he's
[1:32:12] going to picking up job sacrifices he's
[1:32:14] picking up Abel's sacrifice Abraham
[1:32:16] Isaac Moses he's going to picking all
[1:32:18] those up and what else is he doing what
[1:32:23] if he said John just wait the Lambs
[1:32:27] going down and lay out to see what's
[1:32:29] going ahead in time he's picking up
[1:32:31] brother Terry's sins picking her brother
[1:32:33] Greg sins here's John is looking for him
[1:32:40] I can't find him because he's making an
[1:32:42] intercession for you and then the lamb
[1:32:45] comes and opens the book John saw the
[1:32:49] lamb revealed my name John saw the lamb
[1:32:55] revealed his name I would like to think
[1:32:58] I would like to think that my theophany
[1:33:01] and John's theophany are brothers I
[1:33:04] would like to think that John's
[1:33:06] theophany told my theophany I saw your
[1:33:09] name because he saw the opening of the
[1:33:12] book he saw the revelation that come out
[1:33:16] of that book right not John don't write
[1:33:18] it do not write it know about there's so
[1:33:23] much in John that when John came back
[1:33:24] out that vision he wanted to tell so
[1:33:26] much wondered he wondered if if we were
[1:33:30] caught up in that vision with John just
[1:33:32] say John would been able to tell us if I
[1:33:36] can't tell you
[1:33:36] I saw something I don't really want to
[1:33:39] tell you but I can't tell you that River
[1:33:44] that revelation John had caught in that
[1:33:46] vision wasn't only for John that was for
[1:33:49] me that was for you
[1:33:51] that was the revealing of my name on the
[1:33:53] Lamb's Book of Life he some people are
[1:33:56] happy with having their name on the book
[1:33:58] of life I want my name coming out of the
[1:34:01] little book I want my name to be
[1:34:04] revealed in those seven seals the third
[1:34:12] seal brother Bram said now we found out
[1:34:15] that slain lamb is a bloody lamb
[1:34:16] bleeding all over it's been slain after
[1:34:19] he'd been slaying it raised again and
[1:34:20] was sitting on the throne say way back
[1:34:22] military way back behind the throne like
[1:34:26] this interceding for all those souls
[1:34:28] that would come that would come not
[1:34:30] those that are already come that would
[1:34:32] come interceding for me and you he's
[1:34:35] sitting him behind the throne hadn't
[1:34:37] taken the throne yet he's sitting in
[1:34:40] behind the throne interceding for all
[1:34:47] those souls that would come when this
[1:34:48] last one was here and it was completed
[1:34:50] God still held the book of redemption
[1:34:53] now he's just doing the kinsmen work now
[1:34:56] like Boaz went down and Ruth was just
[1:34:59] sitting there waiting until Boaz I mean
[1:35:01] Bowie has done the kinsman redeemer work
[1:35:06] well the brendham said when he saved
[1:35:09] others he saved himself
[1:35:11] well Bram said that was a compliment
[1:35:14] could have saved himself but he saved
[1:35:17] others
[1:35:19] I believe with all my heart you look at
[1:35:27] the age were living in it is totally
[1:35:32] corrupt if you want to see what the
[1:35:35] world is really like you get some of
[1:35:37] these officers and brother Matthew would
[1:35:40] go riding with him sometime you'll see
[1:35:43] things you've never thought possible
[1:35:45] people do it the world is gone totally
[1:35:50] insane I had a call one night to go take
[1:35:56] a girl to the hospital for emergency
[1:35:59] committal she was they said a homicidal
[1:36:02] and suicidal she had two sons I think at
[1:36:07] the time they were my boys age they were
[1:36:08] around eight and four or something like
[1:36:10] that I took her there and she started
[1:36:15] telling me how she had been to rehab all
[1:36:19] this stuff and I said she was an
[1:36:22] alcoholic they take her kids from her
[1:36:26] her sister was trying to get her kids
[1:36:28] and I said ma'am have you ever tried God
[1:36:34] it I tried to witnesses some people
[1:36:38] sometimes it whenever I felt late I
[1:36:40] don't I don't do it all the time
[1:36:43] she just looked at me and she said I've
[1:36:45] tried that it don't work she said let me
[1:36:50] tell you something she would said I
[1:36:54] would give both of my sons and my soul
[1:36:57] for one kind of beer I thought where's
[1:37:03] the hope for her she turned down her
[1:37:07] attorney she done testified I've tried
[1:37:10] it and she turned it down what what are
[1:37:14] you gonna say to him I like it about
[1:37:16] Terry what are you gonna say she done
[1:37:19] made her choice she didn't want to try
[1:37:21] god she wanted a can of beer if it cost
[1:37:24] her her soul or her kids that's what
[1:37:26] would make her happy where are you at in
[1:37:30] your life
[1:37:32] are you just now in the courtroom have
[1:37:35] you even been yet you know now so you if
[1:37:39] you never have tonight's your night in
[1:37:41] the courtroom if you've never ever heard
[1:37:43] it before you heard it tonight so
[1:37:46] tonight's your arraignment you have a
[1:37:50] choice to take your attorney or turn him
[1:37:52] down if you want to represent yourself
[1:37:56] good luck let me tell you go s go down
[1:38:03] here to the detention center over to
[1:38:05] Mountain City and ask some of the guys
[1:38:06] that represented themselves that's the
[1:38:09] only place you're going to talk to him
[1:38:10] at st. how do your walking free they
[1:38:16] chose their way if I could say anything
[1:38:22] to help you on this is just totally
[1:38:24] chopped up but if I could urge you in
[1:38:29] any way
[1:38:31] like I'm saying you look at the way the
[1:38:33] shape the land is of today the
[1:38:35] government is totally corrupt I don't
[1:38:38] I'm not saying anything about the way
[1:38:41] Obama has religious views or anything
[1:38:44] you don't matter God's in control it
[1:38:46] don't matter
[1:38:47] who's in there God's in control if it
[1:38:51] ain't him the next one will be corrupt
[1:38:52] that's just the way it is but time is so
[1:38:56] short when you can have a sinner come up
[1:38:59] and tell you I was done here at the ball
[1:39:03] field the other day when the fireman's
[1:39:05] friend of mine standing about I just
[1:39:08] walked up leaning on the fence and he
[1:39:09] leaned over he was two people down
[1:39:11] walked over stood beside me said Joe I
[1:39:13] think the world's coming to an end it's
[1:39:18] not just a revelation to the Christian
[1:39:20] anymore it's not a revelation to message
[1:39:23] people anymore it's obvious
[1:39:29] so I urge you if any way possible that
[1:39:35] if God has tugged at your heart as God
[1:39:36] is saying I'm giving you representation
[1:39:38] I urge you to take it I hope all of us
[1:39:42] have so let's stand together
[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:40:02] whenever the lamb was hung on the cross
[1:40:06] his attorney work wasn't done it wasn't
[1:40:10] over like I said it's still still going
[1:40:13] on it's even better now because God
[1:40:17] don't believe the things Satan's say
[1:40:23] Barabbas is the only person that Jesus
[1:40:27] died for twice he took his place
[1:40:32] physically and spiritually I don't know
[1:40:36] I don't know whatever happened to
[1:40:37] brightness I hope he took advantage of
[1:40:40] the opportunity that he had look at the
[1:40:45] thief on the cross here's an attorney
[1:40:48] hanging beside him attorney hanging
[1:40:54] beside him he tells him he's in need of
[1:40:58] his services Jesus looked at him and
[1:41:02] said I can't I'm hanging on the cross
[1:41:05] can't you see I can't do anything
[1:41:09] hey what he told him said here's my card
[1:41:11] come to my office here shortly
[1:41:17] it's for free can you sing that song
[1:41:25] 10,000 angels you know what he could
[1:41:29] have called into everything
[1:41:33] it's just worshiping a little bit on you
[1:41:35] know it's been chopped up I apologize
[1:41:39] for my my nervousness that's just part
[1:41:43] of me sorry
[1:41:58] they bound Jesus in the garden
[1:42:08] [Music]

[1:57:37] but everybody's not but they thought
[1:57:39] they were they thought they were under
[1:57:42] the blood o God we don't want to see
[1:57:45] anybody lost anybody left behind I don't
[1:57:48] want to be here during the tribulation I
[1:57:50] don't want to have to go through that
[1:57:51] Lord let me take my judgement now Lord
[1:57:55] let me accept my representation now you
[1:58:00] died for my sins that I could go free
[1:58:03] I'm thankful dear God that you preached
