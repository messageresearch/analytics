he told us ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen what a privileged people we are tonight because we have been made free amen amen the world's in bondage you know America's desire to be free has actually brought their self into bondage that's exactly right they have chained herself up they can't be free for nothing but we're the true free ones tonight amen do you love him is this thing of whining or something oh my Lord how long for the day there will be no more microphones amen may the Lord bless you richly if you have your Bibles this evening to turn with us to the Book of Joshua we want to read from Joshua starting at chapter 2 verse 1 we preach in the name of the Lord Jesus and counted an honor to be here tonight we appreciate brother Donnie asking us to to minister We Trust something to be said to help you it's just a a real simple thought but that's really the only kind I can preach but I I trust it'll be a blessing to you but I want to read from Joshua chapter 2 starting at verse one and we'll read verse 1 and pray and then be seated and maybe just read a wee bit more do you love him tonight praise the Lord the Bible says this and Joshua the son of nun sent out of Shiloh two men despise secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into the harlots house named Rahab and lodged there now just keep your Bibles open and we'll just have a word of prayer I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening until the last one comes until the last one comes Heavenly Father we love you Lord we want to thank you for all that you've done for us Lord I pray tonight that you could take this simple thought Lord and break it to the hearts of your people that we may see ourself more clearly Lord and what it is you want us to accomplish here on this Earth bless your children tonight Lord those that are sick and Afflicted little Jonah there Lord that's sick tonight may you just move for the little fellow God raise him up we pray others Lord in need tonight sister Erica different ones dear God may your spirit just move for them Lord because you are our healer and we Look to You Lord and we believe Lord we thank God for doctors and medicines and injections and all these things but Lord I'm so glad when they say they can't help us we know someone who can Lord we thank you for that tonight I commit this congregation and myself into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Sanctuary may be seated now I want to read just a little bit more of that starting at verse 9 As We Lay a little background and she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you if we have heard how the Lord dried up the Waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did into the two kings and the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan Xi'an and OG whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did they remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in the earth beneath now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord so to have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brother and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will do kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by Court through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountain at least the pursuers meet you and hide yourself there three days until the Pursuits be returned and afterwards you may go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet threat in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be the whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house and to the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless that whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our hand our head if any hand be upon him and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she said according unto your words so be it that's that needs to be our attitude according to Thy word O Lord so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the Scarlet thread amen may the Lord have the blessing to the reading of his word now we find that Israel was on the move they had with them a pillar of fire they had the great General Joshua and they were moving towards their Promised Land sounds exactly like us and they passed over the borderline of Jordan River into the Palestine then Joshua sent two spies into Jericho and one place the prophet said there were two preachers in another place he said there were two tape boys and these men had the message of Joshua where they had the word of Joshua and they were loyal to Joshua amen they had the same vision they had the same goal they had the same purpose they had the same objective they had the same anointing and they go into Jericho and they come up to the home of Rahab and now let's just picture her for a few minutes the prophet said Rahab was young and she was beautiful and she had been trapped into a life of prosecution of a prostitution as she was a gentile and the prophet said that she was rotten to the Core sounds like a lot of our lives at one time and there was nothing that she had to offer The Messengers that came to her house had come there not by her Merit but solely by the grace of God and the spies these preachers the prophet said another place there must have been some tape Boys in there somewhere that slipped in somewhere for the predestinated sea you see the Bible said that the sons of God they are led by the spirit of God now why of all the houses in Jericho did they go to her house in all the houses that was up on the wall why did they go to her house because she was predestinated to receive the message but I said anyone who knows anything about the Bible knows that that Harlot was predestinated she sure was she did the Bible said she perished not with them who believed not that's right but she believed the message of the hour and I say to you tonight my brother my sister why has the message came to your house think about it tonight why has the message came to you it's not my own marriage but it's by the grace of almighty God Amen but why has the message be come to your house because we were predestinated to receive this message amen hallelujah we're not Baptists we're not Luther we're not Catholic we're Sons and Daughters of God Birth by the word of God Amen and placed in this hour to overcome this age that the world may know he's the same yesterday and forever not just in the life of brother Branham but in the life of every True Believer hallelujah what saints of God I take tonight we should be the happiest people on the Earth in spite of our trials in spite of our troubles in spite of our sickness we should be the happiest people on the Earth tonight because God has sought us out by the message of the hour Oh Glory to God Hallelujah oh it makes me feel good I wasn't looking for God you weren't looking for God he came looking for us amen the first time I ever heard of this message was in 1966 I was just a little boy three or four year old and a man come to our house with a big old tape player and prayed The Prophet's message but even then as a little boy what was it God was seeking us out amen Hallelujah amen God has sought us out by the message of the hour and when Rahab got her first hearing of Israel and of a God that answered prayer not only a God to pray to but a God that answers back I'm so glad saints of God that we serve a God not a dead God of stone not a God that we pray to and cry out to and lay before him but yet he cannot answer us back that's not the god that we serve tonight that we cry out to him and tell him our troubles but he has no ability to answer back or a thought of someone's imagination as I heard Brother David Tyler say one time when he was in India and he saw a man packing around an idol and Brother David said he watched that man set the idol down and he worshiped it and Brother David said as I was watching that I thought I'm so glad I don't serve the God that I made with my hands but I serve a God who made me with his hands amen that's the God we serve tonight not a dead God not a dumb God but a God who hears our cry he sees our tears he said I'll never leave you knowing what I forsake you that's the God we serve tonight the god that's able to answer back for he's setting up Jeremiah 33 3 call unto me saith the Lord and I will answer thee oh Hallelujah amen when she heard there was a god of Miracles a God who could perform Miracles who could dry up the sea Ray bread out of heaven her heart began to tremble and when she got her first message from those two preachers you see the first two pulls got her attention but it was the third pull the revealing of the word that brought her life and quickly she heard she believed and she acted and when that word flashed across her path not a message of just healing but a message of life God didn't sinned by the bread of just to restore heal it to the church but to bring the life back into the church to restore the name of Jesus for there's power in the name of Jesus that's why Satan fought so hard to take the name out of the church and have the baptizing father sudden Holy Ghost because he knew the power of that name in the hand of the believer but what did God do well he was buried down in the Dark Ages but God began to restore that church and what has he done in the last days he has placed the name of Jesus back in the church again he said I no longer call you at church I call you Brad mistress Jesus Christ [Applause] oh brother Ben said you got a kid named Ricky change his name you got a kid named Elvis change his name because you take on the characteristics of that name and Ricky means rat and Elvis means cat I believe it was he said or something like that well if that's true for Ricky and that's true for Elvis is that not true for Jesus that would we take on the name of Jesus we take on the characteristics of that name amen Abram could never have be a father of Nations under the name of Abram but he met God and what did God do he changed his name from Abram to Abraham and under the name of Abraham he could manifest the father of Nations because that's what his name meant oh I'll make a Baptist out of him Hallelujah amen amen quickly quickly she accepted it with all of her heart amen and she said give me a true token one that Joshua recognizes that's what I want don't give me just a religious covering don't give me just a bunch of do's and don'ts I'm not even interested in what I could say about myself but give me something that God recognizes but remember said there is a token over there the holy spirit that belongs to God it's his and when I see that token I will pass over you a positive token the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the Holy Ghost you've passed from Death to life that's all there is to it because life is in you and you can no more perish then God can perish he said give me a true token the Spy said you know we come through something like that ourself and God gave us a true token he took the red blood of a lamb and applied that blood and it brought us life and it brought us deliverance and it brought us safety and it brought us assurance and God spared us they said now take this Scarlet thread and let that you let us down by and hang it in the window and it shall be to you not just a sign not just the token but a true token and that truth token because she believed the report of the messages it was her protection it was her witness it was her Assurance it was her seal it was her sign the token was the identification that she belonged to God hallelujah hallelujah she believed and received the message listen to me it's not enough to say I believe it the devil believes it imagine here not long ago was in the backfield praying for the young people and while I was praying back there it just just something prayed out of me and said are we just getting them to shout or are we getting them to Christ and while I was praying I felt like the Lord spoke to me and said go ask them are you in the message or is the message in you you see if you're just in the message somebody can talk you out of it but if the message is in you all hell can't get it out of you because it's life it's the token it's the word of the hour amen it's not enough to say I go to word the life I believe it's just being able to read you can't just say I believe it you must receive it and apply the token the evidence that Noah believed and received the message from God think about this no I just didn't say I believe it but the evidence that Noah believed and received the message from God was manifested in the ark that he built the ark he built was the evidence he believed the report because he acted on it well I believe God's A Healer but you got to act on it well I believe God gives a holy ghost you've got to act on it the prophet said God gives the Holy Ghost to them who will ask him are we willing to ask him remember that crippled man with the foot when brother said in Jonesboro Arkansas and he come around there you know him that the black girl was blinded you know the story and the lord gave her back her eyesight and there's a man standing there with a little twisted up foot and he said I know who you are brother Branham I've been standing here three days in the ring just to be prayed for but I believe now whatever you ask God God will do it but oh God we can't set 45 minutes in a beautiful building but this man was willing to stand not one hour not one day but three days in the rain just to be prayed for what will God do in a situation like that when you're hungry for it when you want it when it's more than your very life it's more than your popularity it's to know somebody when you want it and you're willing to die out for it to say I believe it we must receive it Amen brother Ben said you don't come together yet so we're not just yet to come together and talk about the message they come together to apply the blood to apply the token verbum said don't come together and say I believe it don't just come together and say I believe it but get beneath it get into it think of this judgment could not strike Jericho until Rahab had come under the protection of the token she had to come out of Jericho before God destroyed it because seed cannot perish with Nancy you thought wait a minute now preacher you said she came out before destruction failed but if my Bible tells me she was up there on the wall yeah but you see when she come out of the token as far as God was concerned she was already out of it oh Hallelujah we may be here and lay ought to see him but let me tell you we are out of laodicea we may be here in this Dark Age but we are not in the darkness amen we may be in a time of blindness but we are not blinded people amen we are the children of the most high God Children of the light light bearers in the end time Hallelujah that's who we are the Bible says she perished not with them who believe not she believed the message of the hour God could not destroy the Jericho until she had come out of the protection of the token and I heard putting you Putin or putting or whatever his name is over in Russia warned of a World War III global conflict that's the issues nuclear threats but I just want that old boy to know it ain't the U.S that's going to stop him it ain't the U.N that stops him it's you he cannot push a button to release a nuclear warhead until this bride Hallelujah is out of the way man and the prophet said if they push that button before one ever stuck this nation we would be golden amen [Applause] I ain't worried about Putin a Putin or whatever I ain't worried about him I ain't worried about Biden come on somebody that's not my headship my headship is Christ the word [Applause] and from another kingdom I got another leadership I got another revelation I don't have a digital ID you saw where Canada is actually in the digital ID I ain't worried about a digital ID I've got a spiritual idea Hallelujah thank you buddy hey man because I felt this quote Professor let me say this tonight it's not amen let me say this let me pick this up right here do you know he said let me say this do you know it wouldn't be hard for this night to be the last night that Tennessee ever stands on the mouth it wouldn't be hard for this night to be the last night that Tennessee ever stands on the mountain she could be powder before morning and never it wouldn't be anything alarming about it no more than it's going it's true or the whole world could just be powder by morning the whole world Tennessee by morning could not even be on the mount does that worry you no you know what that tells me that tells me if that's true if Tennessee is powdered by morning that last seed is coming in tonight Hallelujah that just means we're that much closer that just means we're a few hours away somewhere in the world the last seed is going to come in before this nation before this state ever becomes power Hallelujah because the Wrath of God will not fall until the last one comes in until the last one comes in so all you that's nervous over the fox headlines don't be nervous just believe the report just receive the report said there's just a few more there's just a few more you might be the last one that's ordained to come to Christ when that last one comes judgment strikes it's lacking one thing yet and that might be you it might just be a young person sitting in our abuse an old person that's never really surrendered it just might be you might be the last one that's ordained to come to Christ and when that last one comes judgment strikes it's lacking one thing yet and that might be you will you receive him tonight he said while we wait Ezekiel 34 11 says this for thus saith the Lord God behold I even I will both search my sheep and seek them out as the shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he's among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep I will seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in a Cloudy and a dark day I will seek them out and I will deliver them from all the places that I find them ahead where did he find you he found me in a barn where did he find you a Shepherd Shake It Out shattered sheep in a day of Darkness in the day of cloudiness God said I will seek out my sheep I will search for them in a dark day in a cloudy day just before judgment there will still be seed that must be sought out ain't no time to quit ain't no time to fold our hands ain't nowhere we're in a good church we beautiful church we can rest a while ain't no time to sit back just before judgment there will still be seed that must be sought out God is a spirit how will he accomplish this he said I will search out my sheep who have scattered in a dark and cloudy day I will search out my sheep not somebody else's sheep not the devil's but my sheep how will he accomplish this God is the spirit you remember Jesus when he stood there looking out upon the Harvest he was the lord of the Harvest he said the Harvest is ripe and the labors are few praying you the lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into this harvest in other words pray to me that I will send laborers into my Harvest which I'm just telling you it's such a needy thing laborers God's a spirit how will he accomplish there laborers you see God made himself a co-partner to accomplish this work let me say that again God is a spirit he has no hands he has no eyes how will he accomplish that he has made himself a co-partner the prophet said make it himself with man so bound together that he only walks through the agency of man he chose man to work for him he could have chose the son to preach the gospel he could have chose the wind or the trees or the stars or a tape player but he chose man he chose man and he veils himself inside and hides himself from the unbeliever and reveals himself to whom he will he could have chose the Sun the moon the stars the wind but what did he do he chose you he chose me he chose us he co-foundered himself with us all saints of God let your light shine let your light shine bring your light to the darkness is that not what he done for us When We Were Young he called her names we tried to run from him but still he came he stepped into the darkness and called us to his light because that's the kind of God that he is and he has co-partner himself with you with you and get too many gay men's out of that but the part of it lays in human beings do you believe that thank you the kingdom of God lays within the human being Jesus said in one place I'm the vine you're the branches the vine can't bear the fruit the branches and the vine Bears the fruit God cannot bear fruit of himself it's got to take the church is that right he's got to take you you bridge us to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth you see what I mean God wants your hands God wants your eyes God wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears he wants your hands your feet so that he can bring forth fruit through you God's seeking out his sheep using his body on the earth to do it who is that body it's you God seeking out his sheep who have been scattered in a dark and cloudy day what is he using it's Bonnie that's on the earth now what good does it talk about a historical God we need a present tense God let the little boy when the storm coming his mama said well honey God's with you he said but mama I want a god with skin on him don't give me a gunner history don't give me a god of 2 000 years ago give me a present tense God who's an ever-present help in the time of trouble Hallelujah God seeking out his sheep using his body on the Earth to do it you see brother Burnham said we are bone and flesh of Jesus Christ we are his bones and his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life fleshifist bone of his bone flesh of his flesh you are him the only Jesus Elizabeth will ever see is the Jesus you bring to Walmart the Jesus you bring to Sonic come on somebody he has failed himself once again has he done before he veiled himself God the invisible God became visible when he veiled himself in a body called Jesus now that same God has veiled himself in another body it's called The Bride but she is the evening life the evening light is more than just the name of the Tabernacle it's more than just a quote book it's more than just a tape come on somebody but you are the evening light Jesus said I'm the light of the world then he said you're the light of the world he said oh that my father hath given me shall come shall come that don't mean could be hope so maybe it means they coming shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hands God's today in the devil in hell they ain't an organization they ain't a government they ain't a stipulation there's not a mandate there is nothing that could take my people out of my head I paid the price for them they belong to me the evidence it's the stars is in his hands amen these are my sheep and my pastor Hallelujah Hallelujah My Father which gave them me his greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hands you know I've said this before but it just come to my mind I'm at the age that I lose things now don't you laugh at me you will too if time stands long enough I lose my keys find them in my pocket lose my glasses find them on my head I don't know none of you do that so y'all pray for me but you don't we're not in his pocket we're not on himself we're not locked up in a safe but where are we we are in his hand he knows exactly where you're at and every mother Hallelujah [Applause] he's sitting at the right hand of God tonight doing his mediator work and when that last soul is saved that was redeemed and seen and known by God before the foundation of the world when that last soul is saved that closes the book and the lamb comes and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sets upon the throne then he's coming then he's coming to the Earth when that last one comes in closes the book and cause for his bride oh God will put his whole program on hold until the last seed comes in think about that the love of God he will put his whole program on hold because he'll not lose one seed and whenever name that's on that book that was placed there before the foundation of the world comes forth he closes the book he closes the book as it goes for his breath but he'll put the whole program on hold until the last one comes the love of God the love of God I don't know about you tonight but that humbles me to think brother Joy brother Tony that humbles me to think that he would do that for me so we wonder why the Revival is not going on right now why we don't see enthusiasm with the people I I don't know why but let's just think what if it's like this maybe there's a little boy in here tonight or a little girl born over Seattle Washington and that book holds her name and he come to redeem whose names is on the book redeem needs to bring back from where it fell from and in the human race she was fell and she can't accept it now she's too young so the church WIll slug right along just play along we'll have meetings and so forth till that last person is brought in then that book is closed there's no more added then it's all over when that time will be none of us knows but let's just keep doing all that we can do to his glory until the time is over let's just keep doing all that we can do we don't know who that person is they may already be in we're just waiting he's coming we do not know it'll never be revealed to man the time of his coming because not even the angels of heaven knows when it's going to be but we're just looking for it at any time and waiting and watching for his coming the wrath of God never fell on Jericho until Rahab and her family were under the token when she came under that protection then the Wrath came down and the prophet said we're looking for the coming of the Lord and as that song said we're seeking out that little lost sheep and he won't come until the Sheep's sin everyone has to be in the foe he won't close the door until the last one comes in despise despise Rahab everyone that is under the protection of this token will be spared and what did it do to her it thrown her into action said if you're out from under we're not responsible for anybody that's out from 100 and Rahab all my Rahab every predestinated seat in here you go out there and go to Honeyville notice who was commissioned notice what rahab's commission was before the Wrath fell what was her commission to get that predestinated one not the prophet not the evangelists not the two spies they told Rahab you go do it who does Rahab type every one of us go get that predestinated one go get your daddy your mother we just come out from under the atonement down down in Egypt we just come out under the atonement down in Egypt and everything we didn't have under that token pastor we have I'm giving you a sign it's a token oh church I say tonight we got a new building it's beautiful it's wonderful to stay here and to be a part of this it's so wonderful but with the new building let's make a new commitment to not be idle not to Mark time as we used to do in the military but to keep marching keep looking keep seeking get testified get Witnesses keep bearing light keep laborers keep working keep going find that last seed it may be your mother it may be your father it may be that Wayward boy that's been in and out of jail but don't give up on a keep believing keep pressing keep praying keep marching Hallelujah yes let's yield ourselves you see God I'm so glad God don't need my ability I ain't got none I was so glad that God don't need my education I can't pronounce half the words in the Bible you say my God you worked in surgery but I I learned by repetition but I'm so glad it's not based on education it's not based on the GED it's based on God it's not my ability it's just not what I can do or what I can think or what but it's how I can yield you see God knows what brother now I'm not brother darling I'm not Brother David Siler and I'm not Wayne Lawson or I'm not in it but you don't have to be just be what God Made You everybody has a place everybody has a position find your position and stay in it and the body will operate the way it's supposed to operate you swell if I was somebody big but God don't need something big he just needs something yielded he can use a teenager he can use a young girl he can use a grandmother or grandfather come on somebody sure he can use the fans but sure he can use a faster but he can use a housewife a painter a policeman Hallelujah amen just be yielded vessels at the master can take into his hand but I said Minister Brothers I'm sure with you this morning I know trying to hunt out that last sheep it might be in Phoenix this morning I don't know but when that last one comes in then the shepherd will close the door so we just sing until the last one is signed out and Jesus will come how do we know who they are we don't know but we don't have to know just throw the net and bring it in God will get what belongs to him God knows which one a rainbow trout you say brother Daryl this nation's burned over with the gospel it's just burn over territory I know that I know that I remember as I first started out preaching you could preach this message and I remember the altar would fill up with people and they can preach yourself to death and people hardly move seems like I know it's burned over yet there has to be Gleaners there has to be someone who can go backwards and forth preaching search and calling looking seeking until that last one has come somebody that'll clean the field somebody will go back and find that one weed that's been bruised that's been trampled on that's been neglected that's been overlooked and said brother you can make it you're a part of this God loves you well brother Darryl I failed I've messed up we've all failed we've all messed up that's what makes his grace so amazing Hallelujah I'm so glad father's got a hold of her head amen do you love him when the last one comes in than the word will not be effective anymore when that last one comes in the word will lose its effectability it'll be like casting Pearls Before the swans over the whole Earth but while the word is still effective let's take that sword and go to the heart of our enemy and let's cut loose those he's Chained and those he's bound and the those he's put into the cage we have been given the key Hallelujah you have the authority to unlock to loosen to bind by the word of reconciliation through the ministry of reconciliation every prison door that Satan tries to lock somebody in you can unlock that door Hallelujah by the key that's been given into the hand of the believer I give you the keys to the kingdom or whatever you loose on Earth all loose in heaven whatever you bind on the earth I will bind it in heaven Hallelujah do you love him tonight friends several years ago sister Sylvia Bailey wrote a little poem and they put it on a plaque gave it to me when I was working with the young people I've still got it in my in my study and it says these words no greater gift can Grace the hand than precious Seeds of Life you hold servants chosen of the master workers in the fields of Souls receive to possess precious words of life you say brother dial I'm not a preacher I'm not a missionary I'm not an evangelist maybe that's true but you see that may not be your field neither was Rahab Rahab wasn't a preacher she wasn't a prophet she wasn't an evangelist she was just a woman but you see her life was her sermon let me say that again her life was her sermon and I'd rather live the sermon then preach one any day any man can put some quotes together and preach it but it takes a real believer to live it you see sister you'll never stand behind a Pulpit and take a Bible and preach a message but your congregation may be your children it may be your neighbor it may be that lady at Walmart that just the way you dress and the way you conduct yourself and let me tell you sisters appreciate I appreciate your sacrifice the way you live the way you carry yourself and God bless you I want you to know the prophet of God said in the eyes of the Lord You're Beautiful I don't care what the world thinks about us as long as he's okay with us if you see your field maybe your community remember Isaiah what would he say after his confession and the cause of fire touched his lips he said then I Here I Am Lord see me Sydney and how many of you feel that way this evening would I I I ain't no preacher Lord I I can't take a text and preach I'm not a brother Donnie but Lord here I am send me Lord let me testify you'll be testified to the lady at Walmart let me testify to anyone that I can let me do something let me do something for the Lord I'm not asking to be a preacher I'm not asking for that Lord but if I'm a farmer let me witness to other farmers let me witness to the man I sell my grain to if I'm a carpenter let me witness to other Carpenters other contractors let them see you in me because sometimes sometimes it's not even what you say it's just how you conduct yourself I remember one night I was coming out of Virginia and I'd preached hard and my stomach was hurting really bad I had chills in my arms it was just hurting and I was coming in it was late at night I was driving home and I stopped at a convenience store to get some milk I thought it might settle my stomach a little bit it was just hurting so bad and I walk up and get the milk and I walk up to the counter and there's a girl standing there with a dog collar on with spikes she had purple hair and different colored green and all and I set the milk down on the counter and you know what she said to me she said you're a Holiness preacher I don't t-shirt in the blue jeans she said you're a Holiness preacher I said that's right I said how did you know that she said I don't know how I knew that and I said you have a real good evening [Music] Hallelujah you see Jesus didn't wear something to make himself different he was just a man of men that's right we'll have to turn our collar backwards in a big cross owner so just let love of God flow from our lives there's plenty of empty chairs here let's go find someone it might be that person you go to school with let me do something let me testify to the insurance man let me testify to the paper boy let me do something Lord let me go into the neighborhood and find favor with with my sister here next door who's evil in Rome let me give her a testimony with sweetness the prophet said listen we're at the end time what I say it was reverence and respect as these last couple of minutes is floating by look what God to my opinion will do must do and will do in this last day is to find a tool for the Harvest he's got to find a tool for the Harvest he's got to find a tool to thrash the floor any farmer when he goes to the Harvest he has to have a two to do it with certainly he's got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to thrash out the Grain and the Harvest is ripe God take us in your hand make us Bond Servants of Your Love use this for tools to bring the realization to the sinful cursed Earth that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in this day of gross Darkness don't be afraid to let your light shine don't be afraid to let your life shot take your light to the darkness and if you find that one Soul it might be the last one but if you find that one Soul the prophet said your name would be associated with them throughout eternity do you love him today how many I maybe it's different I just failed to go this way but how many tonight we say Lord hear my Lord you speak let me be so full of you let me be so full my saucer is overflowing it's your life that you love let your kindness let your long suffer not just out there in the world Lord and to my wife and to my husband to my children to my wayward family to her brothers who are not here to our sisters who are not here Rahab went out search them out she got her father she got her mother and all that they had better brothers and her sisters brought them all in under the token and when the rat failed the prophet of God said she never even got excited she just sat there and read a few good scriptures and when it was all done Joshua told them two spies they'll go get her and bring her out oh for it let's claim our families let's claim our children [Music] you don't have to shove it down the throat just be sweet and kind just be salty because there's something about salt that makes you thirsty a man told me one time was we close said the greatest compliment that I ever had when I was at work and someone come up to me and said you know I know we don't believe alike but I want you to know every time I get around you I feel the presence of Jesus Christ that we could ever be given it's not that we can quote the Bible from Genesis to Revelation if you can God bless you but they're the greatest thing it's ever said about us was it someone so Jesus in me all right that my girls could say I saw Jesus in my daddy I saw Jesus and my brother it's all said and done what are we really here for to be a nightmare that the world may know that he lives and I say to you tonight let's make this commitment a new building a new era in our church history they let it be a new time of renewing and commitment Henry Consecration and rededication hey man do you love him tonight so let us work Brother's come let us work till Jesus comes let us work until that last one comes in amen he may be here tonight friend it may be you you may be sitting right here it may be over in Africa it may be over in France it may be down under the underpass I don't know you don't know but God does know and all he needs is someone I remember a few years ago I was in a meeting in Nicaragua who's going to have a prayer line but there was just so many people to pray for foreign Mass prayer for everybody we'll just lay hands on one another I said just lay your hands on one another we'll just have one prayer because the Bible said these signs shall follow them they believe they shall lay their hands on the sick I said let's just lay hands on one another and just as I got ready to pray I looked about halfway back in about a crowd of 600 people I suppose and I look about halfway back and there was a sister had her hand up something spoke to my heart and said go lay your hand on her and I jumped off the platform and went back there and by that time I hadn't started praying so people were looking to see well I hadn't started praying and so I went back to where she was and I just she had her hand up and I just reached up and touched her hand like this and we started praying and the people started praying and when the service is over I was outside and the sister came up and wanted to talk to me she said tonight when you told the people to lay hands on one another she said nobody laid their hand on me and she said I thought Lord what's wrong with me yeah that nobody would want to lay their hand on me and she said I started crying because she said I just wanted someone to care I just wanted someone to pray for me and she said I said Lord why won't nobody lay their hand on me and she said a voice spoke and said I'll lay my hand on you this is that voice no sooner spoke then you put your hand in my hand am I jesus of course not but he used me to touch her like he'll use you to touch someone else do you love him tonight that's just about our heads Heavenly Father Lord I'm not a great speaker Lord but in my heart I have a desire to help someone find that troubled sword that young person that's struggling and oh God I pray tonight may we realize Lord you don't need a great education you don't need someone with a lot of money you just need a housewife a farmer a painter a policeman a college student high school student a young person a father a mother there's someone Lord that you can get into your hand that you can live through them express yourself through them for all you was you poured into Christ that all Christ is he was born into his church that oh God may we go forth Lord father not everybody has been called to stand on the street corner not everybody's been called to stand In a Pulpit Lord to travel in other countries but Lord our field could be in our own backyard in our own School in our own home but North wherever it would be may we be faithful Lord granted tonight father if you hear Saints I just wonder if you just raise your head and say brother die that's the way I feel too I I just want to be an instrument I just want to yield myself to him I want to be the Rahab for my father for my mother for my brother for my sister I just wanted you to slip your head up and say Lord here I am a surrender to you tonight Lord God bless those sins young and old oh God you see the hands tonight Lord of your children God we yield ourselves to you tonight if there's one here maybe you've just been around this thing all your life you've never really surrendered to the Lord maybe this sermon was for you tonight maybe the father's seeking you out and I just wonder if maybe you've drifted on him or you're not exactly where you need to be with the Lord I just wonder if you just slip your hand up and say Lord I hear you speaking to me tonight would there be one yes God bless that hand God bless that hand there yes God bless that hand there God bless that hand right there yes amen God bless that hand there of that hand that hand that hand God bless that hand there that in there God blessed that hinder oh Lord God Giver of every good gift the author and finisher of our faith you see these hands
