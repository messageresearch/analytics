Jesus he's not only awesome and all the great things that he's made all the great things that he's done but to me his awesomeness is so consummated and hype it's up with us [Music] [Applause] by the contrast of the paradoxical Union that's left in you after the new birth its read about it Song of Solomon chapter six verse three I am My Beloved's and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies thou art beautiful o my love and the word love there's not a verb an action word but it's actually a noun which means an adjective describing a noun which is my companion thou art beautiful oh my companion as tearsa the word tearsa means favorable they are beautiful or my companion as favorable comely as Jerusalem terrible as an army with banners turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me the hair is as the flock of goats that appear from Gilead Wow beautiful comely companion fare favorable loved beloved cared for thought about redeemed justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost we've had George let's go home you heard more about Aaron in just a matter of minutes a lot of folks here old 30 minutes we're a blessed people friends we're a blessed people let's pray together Heavenly Father thank you for your gracious mercy that has been extended to us we love you so much may you take your word tonight Lord and help us to see blessed God the extension of your mercy how it's been given to us father we love you we want you to know that we don't want you to have to assume or because you're all knowing that you just know it but we want to tell you we want to tell you daily weekly monthly yearly we want to say it many times during the day we just want to let you know you are our everything you're not a spare tire for the bride you are air everything Lord meet the needs of your children to not fathers who speak your word speak to us tonight Lord God we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said god bless you may be seated beautiful fair lovely without spot comely as tearsa beautiful as Jerusalem and yet to see what you are in the reality of your flesh how in the world could you ever see this part about you and you'd be able to acknowledge the other part that every one of us live with every day of our lives I think it will be one of the greatest greatest victories that God will help us as the people of the last day to be able to come to is an understanding not just of intellectually hearing it over and over and over again through repetition and then you intellectually begin to believe it because I say it of the ministers say it and then you grasp a hold of it and you wrap your mind around it a little bit but by divine revelation that God Himself reveals it to you that inner part of you which has been changed is this part that he actually sees right now right now for those that are truly born again and he does not deny the existing part that constantly needs to be corrected they may and there's a part of us that God so loves and can so praised and so adore and so lifts us into heavenly places and there's another part of us he has to wire out in every way every time we come to church it's all right and yet to a real believer they're able to divide that I imagined for those that would maybe not understand or those that would visit from time to time and they'd find it so hard to understand and so hard to comprehend because they hear such complimentary things in one way and such contrasting things in another way I'm sure it must be very confusing to a rebel aided son or daughter of God they're able to divide him and oh the Word of God is coming forth like a sharp sword that sword is dividing asunder between Marr and spirit and bones and all of that sort of thing calling for the seed of Abraham to be separated let us pick it up again worry stopped a few weeks ago before I left our trip to Israel let me begin again with the question answer 64 how can I take a cuckoo bird and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from a cocklebur of wheat a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life now notice how this then you bury that cocoa burn and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the cocklebur and the life of the cocoa bear has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky see and it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the grounds raised up again now the new life put inside this old ground still does not change this old ground yet and make the old ground totally compatible to the new life it still leaves a struggle part of the mystery of what the song was solomon says is that she is as terrible as an army with banners so it shows us if there is an army there is a war going on that war is not just her facing the world her facing church anna t it is her facing herself now she is terrible as an army with banners and you got to know what banner to be identified with because a banner has an insignia you know how the roman soldiers were in the generals and the commanders in that they would have a certain thing of regalia which was a makeup of their standard they would have a certain thing of the battalion that they were in they would also have something of symmetry about their family name or each one of the things where it was a leaf or whatever more that signified the amount of people that they had killed or the amount of is that they had conquered someone a general would come and set down his standard the most people they look at it it was just a bunch of warm annotation and meant absolutely nothing but to someone who could read the banner when they put that banner down in the ground this general represented years and years and years of all kinds of battles and difficulties he'd come from this family from this line he went to this campaign and that campaign it was all written in the banner or the insignia that this man stood for it then all the troops stood behind him this is also their identification hey man well I'll tell you one thing our five-star general put his banner down you know what it cost us there's some gates on there it's signified he conquered the gates of hell there's some other gates on there that he conquered the gates of death and he conquered ever disease ever sickness ever trial ever tests all of it is on the insignia of our general and I'm standing behind him tonight what about you so I don't necessarily have to have all of that on my banner but I'm identified with the right general that's all that matters to me now in this I want you to notice how the Prophet lays this out again then you bury that cocklebur it'll produce a grain of wheat because there's been a life of we put in the coca berm and the life of the cuckoo bear has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and yet you're beautiful you are beautiful and comely and faultless and the virgin bride and you were loved to the Father you're the predestinated seat of God your all these great wonderful things and as sticky as all get-out at the same time but there's two different people now I know nervous reading freak preachers and the message go to get nervous and you preach of this and my fault they don't understand this they're letting tradition behind them will never see ourselves under God opens this - I understand it what's this now and it will be until this new life has been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth that it's no more cocklebur but wheat but we but while it's here on earth and out of the earth and the cocklebur it's still sticky but it's God the nature on the inside of him of we and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live oh praise the Lord but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ then all sin is gone from you see that's the thing now leaving us then was a carnal sticky nature let's look at it this way that certain sticky things will bother you that might not bother you and you might be sticky to something that you would life at and certain things that might be sticky to me other folks would look at and say I can't believe that bothers brother darling well you know each of us are made different our weaknesses our shortcomings our failures and Satan studies us and he knows us very well so he studies our weak tendencies that lean towards certain sticky things all night y'all are gonna just sanctimonious only now aren't you my mom you're gonna pull out your chair up a mask and that's all it is it's a mess I know every one of you well enough to know there ain't no angels here well I'm not saying the right sum here but I know they're not sitting in the pews tonight now every one of us are left with a carnal sneaking nature and as I said before the good thing about it is is that it does truly bother you because you are born again and whenever then we are truly converted and God makes us as beautiful as cheers a comely as Jerusalem oh my what a great thing that God has done inside of our soul and then left us captivated those who do that no doubt to yourself you know the tears it was actually Concord on the west side of the Jordan River and that's up in the northern part of the Land of Israel later become the capital of the Kingdom of Israel and whenever the kingdom was divided into two separate parts known as Israel and Judah tearsa became actually the capital so you're Solomon is don't even reached that place yet but Solomon is comparing the bride to that which is going to be conquered and the northern I'm southern kingdom it was a very beautiful place very place favor with God on the other side of the Jordan River it's actually in the country of Jordan now but yet it was the place of the capital city many great things actually happen there and we look at that why would Solomon not liken the bride to Bethlehem I know the Prophet did later why would she not like in the Gilead why was she not liking that so God has a reason showing that tearsa must be conquered Jerusalem had to be conquered it was taken away from the Jebusites you know what tears are was tears or was a Canaanite city a city about which they worshipped idols and they've done all kinds of terrible things and until Joshua came in and conquered it and then it later become a capital city now then look at the parallel of how the waves of people of God were held in our by nature we were lost without God we were born in this world seemingly with no hope and God began to conquer us and a two-fold way from the very capital of the Northern Kingdom from the genealogy of God from the southern kingdom which will follow up on the Adamic nature which will be redeemed the Earth's a body I'm talking about so the northern kingdom will be conquered already by the new birth and the southern kingdom your body will be conquered at the body change or the resurrection so you will be brought both tearsa and Jerusalem under the headship of one king because in the Millennium there is no divided Kingdom or in the 8th day but until that great day arrives and we are left here in this beautiful ugly situation we are well cheer and this absolute complete perfectly sinless and absolutely rotten stinking lowdown good-for-nothin bodies at the same time now if our soul was absolutely rotten and no good then would be like all the rest of the world and we wouldn't even me even have any magnetism whatsoever for preaching like this at all they were not even brought it wouldn't even make a lick of sense to us but because we had been divided by the new birth and when the Lord Jesus come upon the earth he was the beginning of this new race and that was that whenever the Spirit of God come in him at the river the fullness of the Godhead bodily and he was distilled I died in John 8 baptized him and Carol I stood there just a few weeks ago of the Jordan River just as many as it ever was no doubt and yet whenever you stand there and see where Moses was when Moses was allowed by God to look across the river into the land and you look at the mountain where Moses was standing on and see where Jesus was baptized it was the same crossing where Joshua and the children of Israel come across so they stood there what was it then Jesus became the voice of the new race and that he would have two natures listen carefully now he would have the divine nature the fullness of the Godhead bodily but he was also still a man 100% man hundred-percent God so this is why the disciples misunderstood him part of the time it was the man talking all the time that was God talking well it's the same way with you and I we've got that divine nature inside of us which leads us by the Holy Ghost but we've got the human element that we have to deal with every day of our life now notice again question-answer 64 will read this about the Indian again since me received the Holy Ghost he said there's been two dogs in me one of them was a black dog and one of them a white dog and he said they argue at least once every 32 years and there's not much of an argument that goes on because I'm so full of the Holy Ghost that I never had any problems in the flesh that's not the question answers I read they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another oh praise God they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another and the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to do that so well chief which one of them ones to fight said that depends on which one donnie feeds the most or gene feeds the mouse or TM or whoever you are same principle to applies to all of us there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to notice how identifies this now which nature you cater to the carnal nature I to the things of the world or the spiritual nature add to the things of God now this is not speaking to a person that has just been justified or sanctified they do not get a new nature in the soul by justification or by sanctification that can only come when the new verse has changed their soul this quote does not apply to Baptist it does not apply to messages who are born again it doesn't apply to Methodists who aren't born again it and apply the Pentecostals who aren't born again it only really really applies to the born again of tearsa and Jerusalem that's exactly right now what things are sticky - psalmist has said others were just life and that's some folks you know they have a problem with temper some have a problem with anger some are high patience asexually some have a problem with porn and others it's a what in the world's a matter to you old filthy thing you kind of be a Christian and you have a problem with that well it's easy to see but the way you are chatting them you don't have a problem with it but I wonder if we dig deep enough I'd say we'd find something there so long to you because you're just as sticky as they are only in a different way now does that justify anybody that has a problem pornography absolutely not no more than it justifies anybody that has a problem with anger or gossiping running their big long tongue and causing problems in a family or in the church well preach brother Donnie you see different things bother different folks some folks have you know they're sticky to money some folks are sticky because the more they get the more they want other folks are sticky because they don't ever get how much they want so they have a problem with those who get more than they get because they want more things and they're not smart enough to either be able to make more money so they have an attitude toward the rich so there are all the time care in that situation around are y'all gonna preach to me tonight and others will have a problem because of never feeling loved that devil loves Happy Valley because I don't know how many folks here feel so sorry for herself they're never bragged on enough they're never good or not they're never allowed was somebody appreciate me tonight oh my goodness I'll definitely want to be on that committee to help throw that devil down in hell for those that's never loved enough of those has never appreciated in that their nose has never told by me how good they are come on children that it's a devil that gets on people and folks need to get rid of it if you are coming here simply because how much I brag on you you better go somewhere else you ought to be coming here because you get your soul fair you get your body heal you feel the presence of God you watch the presence of God and this is a hospital and this is a refueling station and will not you to hand out diapers and pacifiers other folks fight an unforgiving spirit so things of that nature they're sticky and it just called clings rattle brother I hate to tell you but you've got this thing hanging on here what what are y'all laughing about huh well y'all look at that whatever but you see folks are so touchy in this day and age if they got something that big hanging onto him you can't tell them cuz they get mad and get offended at you oh my goodness oh you did not believe for in the hundreds of people that I've had tell me tell me the truth tell me their truth and you didn't then they leave or you do tumble truths and they get mad most folks do not want the truth I've time that Christians they don't care you tell no truths about somebody else but just don't tell the truth about them and then we've got all these things hanging on to us and others like I said oh my goodness that don't bother me well no whatever it is that bothers you though this said the devil will have it there and it'll hang on you like a ball fall I'm an ill just hang and you'll have a no stinking rotten attitude oh now you know the Bible sets us an emphatic law how that we as the saints of God should not even provoke one another really when it comes to problems in situations notices and the unpardonable sin no time said provoke their means to encourage encourage one another unto love and to good works if you see a brother in the church that's got something against the other brother don't say something to stir that thing up but say something that'll bring them together but it's amazing how many people when they see something going on in a family or in a church and city of trying say something to provoke one another to good works they'll take that thing and spread it around and they're actually adding more fuel to the fire to make it bigger and bigger there's something wrong with that person well hallelujah notice again if you're my brother tonight don't feel that way when you see your brothers falling out and sharp words between one another if you don't feel like bringing them together it's your time to go to the altar now if there's something on you that makes you want to sow discord and get among the saints of God and when there's a situation going on tell you right now if you fall into that thing over and over again you better go to praying well hallelujah I didn't realize that I was gonna be grub that I'm grabbing around your root Center something happened in your life there's something you've been deceived in my goodness deceived because you actually so discord among other discord and if you do that you're deceived well that's what he said you haven't the experience that God wants you to have but jesus said when he was reviled he reviled not again he was spoken evil he spoke not back again and when they're done evil to him I'll notice that he did good to them when they persecuted him and nailed him to the cross he looked down and said Father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing if that kind of spirits not in you the Holy Ghost has never entered you yet that was the same spirit in Christ Jesus the Bible said let it be in you and then we all have this stickiness called complexes complexes some of them we were born with some of them we inherited from our parents or uncle's or grandparents it's scary what we are notice this now this Centurion a Centurion is a man that I think the right word that the over century which would be a hundred men he put himself in the background I saw him at the man that came to Jesus of course and said I'm not worried that it come under your roof I'm not worthy to ask you for anything but would you grant this huh yeah I'll come no you don't need to come you don't need to come I'm not worthy of that I'm not whether if you didn't come all you gotta do just speak the word now he said he put himself in the background I want you to do that keep yourself in the background never be somebody that you're not I've often wondered when wheat was growing in the field you see the little wheat that sticks up and just feels like it's so the inferiority complex so now when the wheat is in this stage that it has no actually seed yet then the wheat head will stand right straight up it's showing its inferiority complex so it's trying to make itself look bigger than the brother it goes to church with or the sister now some folks came out saying this person or that person or that person or say I'll play them on the piano the drums of the guitar so many will try to do it by being super spiritual hey man boy if somebody all know this you'd want to roam Mountain tonight wouldn't it had a picnic yeah so then what is it it is an inferiority complex now you know what preachers fight this as well so for a preacher that just gets to preach say so many times and and a month and he don't get to preach every weekend or ever so often or a singer that is not you know as much of a blessing to the church as other singers are then if they're not careful they get all offended and get all bent out of shape and they get jealous and get mad whatever more look it's not my fault if you're singing don't bless the church it's not my that every preacher don't bless the church I want to bring folks in here that bless you I want to bring ministers in whether I'm here I'm gone and if I bring them in a few times and I don't you'll get reports back from the site I'm just gonna politely probably not call him anymore then folks they say oh well that's the way it is you go to them big churches and Lord you preach hard they won't have your back is it that or is it that you didn't feed the flock but you see an inferiority complex will always justify the one who has the head stuck up the highs well praise God my goodness I stood the other day and the ancient city of Nazareth they took a parcel of ground and they've reconstructed it's sort of like living farms and things we have around here so there's people walking around first century garments you know they're hewing stone and they're doing vineyards and all of yours and things like that we come over to a place which was an Olive Press it looked to be one probably 2,000 years ago old very ancient event archaeological coins and different things there so here it was that the process of the way that they would did it perfect description when you look at the parable the way Jesus described it so it would be out of yard or a vineyard is very very similar so that have a hollowed-out feud places where they've taken trample it around and they either do it on donkeys or they take a round wheel and go round and around and around and around and oppress then it would come down that have three times which would say they'd pull it out three pulls out of the olives and they would take it out and press out the first press is the extra pure virgin then they would do the second then they would do the third and as they would do that there was a process but they also had what British took out to me one of the things was that there was a tower inside of this vineyard and one of the brothers hair asked the God said what's that up there for said that was a watchtower said why would you need a watchtower and a lot of yard or in all of your vineyard or someone tell you say because people would come in and steal them once they got right and then I realized and Jesus said it for us in the parable that he was talking about the ministry led by the Holy Ghost that God sets out his plants all over the earth and then he puts men in the watchtower so on the right the thieves would come in and try to steal the grapes and that should all the things that was going on all of your labor was gone so what did God do God put man with a watchful eye lid but the holy ghost in the watchtower and the watchtower wasn't 40 miles away it was right there it was in viewing this it's right next to the Olive Press amen right there where it was so they could watch what was going on that's the way the devil does the Church of the Living God so when the church grows and matures and become what God wants it to be then Satan tries to send in the bandits and the robbers of this and that but God has got Watchmen in the watchtower and they're trying their best to watch out over our souls in this end time and they knows we need them oh yes we need them now notice then how that people with an inferiority complex now the Prophet said you see that little way that sticks up it feels that inferiority complex there's nothing in that head a heavy head bowels a full head bowels a full heart will bow see Lord not worthy now people this all the time God is justified you know preachers I get so sick in my stomach and preachers all the time I want here and preaching I want and preach and I want there and I'll tell you what I've done there I was so annoying that I preach this and I think what do you got to prove are you trying to prove it to me I trying to prove to me how many places you go preach I'm really not interested in such stuff what are we doing I'll return to build ourselves the kingdom or the kingdom of God what do we intercept how many peoples on your mailing list how many people stream our services versus stream how many other says I really don't care I don't know how many people stream our services I don't know what countries they stream I don't have number that is the least of my concern if it was left up to me I'd dismantle the whole thing and nobody wouldn't stream anyhow I'm not interested in building a rage in our kingdom I'm interested in taking my gift my labor my ability my desire and trying to build out the kingdom of Jesus Christ anybody with me and that kid notice this in the doors of the door then there's a little compartment the heart called in different Oh what a condition that things get into a little indifferent you love to be just a little indifferent toward others you want your own way you'd be willing to let Jesus in but you want to continue to live in the same place you've always lived boy if he didn't describe the modern lyricism in the same place you've always lived you don't want to get away from your old associates you just don't want to give them that you think they're nice people and you just don't want to give them up so you want to be a little different mama that's another bad compartment in the heart then there's another little door called jealousy oh I don't know whether you Yankees know anything about it or not now he's in Newark New Jersey now some of you all have laughed at me and looked down that may have scorned for years and I've used the term Yankee I'm sorry you didn't know that was the term to proper use notice this now I don't know whether you Yankees know anything about it or not but down south you have a lot of it well let me just back that up here we're on 2018 we still have it mm-hmm oh just a little inferior to the other man just a little better than the other church if the Jones is painter steps Ridge you've got to have yours red oh what a horrible spirit to be in a Christian but remember you're beautiful and you're coming and your beloved and wonderful it's a good thing so long say because with all this tact on us would be a mess now y'all were professional hearers and you've been hearing me preach long enough to know that you're trying now to be real courteous and amen things that's burning their hide because you don't want to be so obvious when I really get down will you live oh my goodness oh my notice this God being misunderstood brother branham I'm saved I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from well now once you notice now what he calls them you serpents eat you child of the devil my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn spirits it's usually a complex that causes this a complex and what do complexes attach themself to cockle burrs there's not a soul here tonight that's born again that has a complex your Holy Ghost don't have a problem with my Holy Ghost because it's the same Holy Ghost but I guarantee our flesh will clash and something that will bother you and give you an inferiority complex a life that didn't go on something that somebody would say or do to me and all of it just hurt me so bad and you'd say grow up Tommy now notice where it comes from usually our complex that causes is either they have inherited it from a mother father uncle aunt mother father uncle and grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you chase it back down through the life now I've taken it by experience under discernment because I've met cases on the platform thousands thousands now my question for you is those people that he met years ago this is 61 those people that he met years ago what happened to those stubborn spirits when they died so not to be too indirect [Applause] anybody ever gets stubborn oh I knew I was head of the Holy Ghost to preach this than that may y'all just hung yourself I'm having confirmed it I have met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that spirit and the first thing you know I chased that spirit right night by discernment that's what I love about a prophet of God another preacher standing out and pray and pray and pray and pray we're just not gifted like a prophet was to do that but that prophet is standing there and praying not only that he chase that thing about uncle songs over Lucy I mean whoever more chase that devil right back oh my goodness hallelujah I chase her spirit right back by discernment and found there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by but brother Donnie what about when I'm born again but you but Ellis we got to be born again right so what was born again this nature here was not the nature of sin this is what you inherited from them genetically what was born again was what she was born in sinful nature this is human nature this is what many of us have spent decades of our Christian life trying to perfect they're trying to perfect uncle Williams nature and ain't Suzy Bell's temper and your time to perfect daddy's arrogance and mama stubbornness and ain't Lucy's whatever Lord and uncle so-and-so you my y'all forget all that relatives what you need to focus on is what Papa God gave you to pray named Suzy Bell to subjection to the world and ain't Lucifer I mean a losing case you see what we're trying to do perfect our family why don't you admit it your family's like the rest of all of our sours a bunch of renegades and Lars when I brother Donnie that applies to everybody but the answer's no I've pastored enough yon sister know that covers them too and horns and Regan's and cuts and wit's ins as a matter of fact I don't see anybody in her that's exempt we're all on the same plateau so get your nose out of the air Oh brother Donnie it's a shame you couldn't have any aunts I have enough problems being a Reagan why would I want to be a Yas it's a shame it couldn't have been a bad wine the God's earth but I want to be a bap I need to be a new creature not a bad not a Reagan a new creature oh I know this hurt some of y'all's feelings it needs to be hurt you need to bring your family tree down where it belongs in the dirt with all the rest of us oh man praise the Lord stubbornness is not of God and now the only lady get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome that you can read all the self-help books you want to it'll never do it I'm not saying that there's not things that might not help you count to 145 and then whenever you get down 146 you'll match somebody's no Shore is the world if you're a Christian you're a son or daughter of God oh my goodness your son or daughter of God whatever it may be you'll never be able to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it I'll rebuild it it's right analyzing a rattlesnake so your money now what a strange thing would think we just rebuking that don't work on everything it's art analyzing a rattlesnake he's laying right there ready to bite you so what does the rattlesnake of stubbornness do when he bites you makes you more stubborn and he makes your stubbornness really stick out then you know you got serpent bit I mean snake bit something l wonder where the serpents 8 is why don't you wake but listen this cure if you will just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you but that's true simple and how hard that is to walk away from see when you feel that you've got a stubborn spirit lay the thing on the altar and believe God that the thing is dead and you'll never have it no more and go home don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil and he will flee from you that's get away quickly so that would be my advice had overcome it we overcome the devil and this applies to everything no matter what you gone through we overcome the devil by faith [Applause] but then there's another kind of complex I realized that there's an element of people around the message that do not want the humanity of brother Brennan brother out folks have got mad at me for decades for making him brother and I'm a man I've told folks don't get mad at me for making a man get mad at God gods who want to make him a man but I do read enough to be able to pick out things that he said about his humanity he was not God he was born lost he had to be saved sanctified received the Holy Ghost just like me and you had to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus his name will not cast out devils his name will not raise the dead nor heal the sick he is not the third Adam he is our prophet of God and we thank God for it but we do not worship Him now I'm sure brother Branham brings to us the seals three months after and sending in the gap he's dealing with this complex and he's come to a climax to it and he said that the Lord spoke to him he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward then I've seen and said do you remember I told you don't you remember what brother Roberson told you in his dream or vision that he had done like Moses you've forgot the feeling the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you - can you imagine the only Gentile prophet we Gentiles ever had great major prophet not a man that had been preceded in that it had the ministry and the supernatural and the word March is one thing after another at another and yet come to a spot or God told him you forgot what I called you to do how is that possible complex why brother branham's flesh wasn't born again it was sticky go ahead and say man it won't hurt you you won't have a heart attack your kids won't die with cancer it's the truth you'll never see yourself if you don't look at him right that's why the devil is trying his best to absolutely make a god out of brother Branham if brother Branham was the wave sheaf and he was God then that means you've got to be God he was the first one to come to maturity so if he was God absolutely God then that means I've got to be in order to follow the same cycle of wheat and so do you so we're all in this well praise the Lord notice this you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you to I let the sick lame I want the Lord tell me where to go and what not to do that's wrong I had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message wonder what in the world he'd do now to hear what people are doing with it if they're not hearing it cause the complex what in the world would he do now to see what people are doing with his missus now this is a different complex of course than stubbornness this is different from an inferiority type of complex yet it has its strain and its roots still back to brother Branham being rejected as a young boy now he was rejected by his father because of course he was identified as being a he was rejected by the folks the young folks he went to school with remember when he was going to take the cigarette and smoke at the little girl laughter I didn't call him a and the sound come in the bush and here on crying remember that so you see this pattern in his life of being rejected rejected rejected rejected well then it turns now it becomes converted of course as a young man receives the call of God steps into the office of a prophet God gives him the great things in the understanding of the word but does that humanity becomes so subjected to the Word of God that the coca BER part which was always there is it always down totally annihilate and then way with absolutely not three months after the lamb takes the book and opens the seals we hear the confession of this man this is the reason I can follow this kind of a man a preacher that stands up and never lets on his humanity I wouldn't follow him nowhere because that's where he'll take you nowhere but this man was able to stand before a congregation knowing that these tapes would be played for years and years and years after he was gone for the day I'd be able to stand and admit that he was wrong come on church why is it that we have such a hard time admitting our fault and admitting our wrong and we want to blame everybody else you're not in the spirit of the message until you can be able to admit you're wrong and say it's my fault I'm the one to blame I'm the one to blame from my own shortcomings not my wife not my pastor not the church it's me in the need of prayer watch him you imagine this must have been embarrassing humiliating to stand and have to tell people this I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message god forbid that I try to compare the life of Moses but that's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when I went to deliver them so we just left them alone went into the wilderness but God turned him around he longed for God the suffering people further down in the message actually brings this now pressure of 173 god bless you each one and we hope to see you again real soon till then will you do this one favor for me now both here and on tapes also your brethren pray that God will place into my heart that's something that I lost out there in that complex now this is one of the things that Satan wants us to have complexes for because we tend to lose things in complexes we can lose love respect honor trust burden desire so many many things brother branham a prophet of God preaching the word bringing the Word of God to the Gentiles he believed this but somehow he had lost an element of love still preaching still going oh it can happen to a song leader it can happen to a deacon that can happen to a library worker it can happen to a pastor can happen to a trustee it can happen to a mother it can happen to a father it can happen to some of the best of God's people why carnal sticky nature notices pray that God were placed into my heart that something that I lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a compass now what did you notice he doesn't say the people built it he doesn't say the devil did he says he did but the people gave him the material to build it with so if you're an introvert and you come to a large church and you have a hard time making friends and whether it's a big church or a little Church you're gonna have cliques [Music] hey man Melanie and the truth of it is there's always going to be people that you're going to be more comfortable with than other people because your stickiness is more sticky but their stickiness than it is with other people's stickiness so some of you can cling together because your stickiness is on the same frequency and other people you try to stick with their stickiness turns into thorns and you all for each other I need to take a vacation short I said well you say you just come back off of what I know it but boy I don't know what the world happened to be now because of this then brother branham recognizes something helps him brother he must have be able to see that he's lost something he's not feeling the same this is so ratchet don't you appreciate anion on a server of God like this against him before the people in Omaha so he's desiring notice what God does now God doesn't take sides with brother branham and blame the people and Sal tell what you do you stand out here Moses and I'll raise up a whole generation after you I'll kill them off out God don't do that God don't take sides with brother branham and send against the people God actually rebukes brother Brennan why because brother branham was wrong Oh Lord Jesus here we go again and because of the stickiness he lost something that carnal sticky nature so if you come to our church and you're an introverted type of person you don't make friends well you stand out there and you come in at the time and stand out there and already nobody comes to you and you're wanting friends and people don't think you do because the look you got on your face or because you never really say anything back so you're sending your misunderstood they misunderstand you you misunderstand them it ain't a friendly Church that beats all I ever heard in my life because I hear it all over the world people who come here to our church this one the friends church they were singing or life other people come in say well that ain't that ain't your friend a church at all something messed up somewhere somebody's got the green war on the blue post and the blue post on the purple wire or something something bad wrong now look what is it that pulls people through that it's the way they're wired in the frequency of their mind and they're pulling stuff through some of you tonight assent right now pulling what I'm preaching not through the ear of the Holy Ghost you're now pulling it through the Holy Ghost you are pulling it through your complexes that's why you walk out of here sometime mad or aggravated or whatever more to preacher because you sat there and pulled the sermon through your complexes and said of moving beyond your complex and said lord help me to get out of the way and you'll get up and stomp out and get mad he was throwing that right at me I'll tell you one high coming back no more you know why you sellin heard the whole servant through your complex why don't you die to that thing and let the Lord hear the word through the Holy Ghost instead of your inferiority soar nobody likes me [Applause] well I've had problems as people of happy valley I'd say you even had near as many as I have so if anybody's got a right to leave I did but I'm not basing my position on such stupidity and that's what it is well if you're gonna do that then this compared on down I'll show you how ignorant that it is I've had problems with humans so why don't you leave the human race and join the monkey race come on humans have lost cause you your problem people have called why don't you go join the Hogs it's in dirt face it you have all these complexes within yourself nobody likes me nobody wants to be around me and you live in that world man I wish some Sunday morning people could've been here tonight whoo what'd y'all think about if I preach this again in the morning now watch brother branham so he asked the people to pray for him now they changed us a little bit so they had an interview the other day with my brother Wei sitting there standing here in front a good man but built yourself around a complex another kind of a complex a semi all-new brother Wei but there's just a way they came here years ago they visit it was something y'all let me share in the church for I came here I had to interview the other day said would brother Wei standing here a good man I built itself around a complex another kind of a complex because by the way was not liked by the brand but the way we started the position of brother branham so apparently that kind of complex would not work for brother Wei but by the way had his own special complex it's a case of your have your own special I hate that thing don't you or maybe I should say things most of us have got more than one it's not Lay's potato chips nobody gonna have just one notice another kind of a complex that did the same thing by the way you can so easily do it let's just get a little something in your and keep thinking that way brother Donny don't want me brother don'ti don't want me brother Terry don't like me then it'll go from that thought to brother Terry hates me brother che he despises me that man I'll tell you what I believe he could run me over with his car if he could get by with it and where's it come from your mind but it's built from the focus of a complex within your being so you will interpret his body language you will interpret that smile and face it's the most always on there you will interpret that as ridiculing you he's looking down on you because you're pulling it through your complex which we all love and we baby you we change this Dappy do we give each pass see we've had him since we were kids a lot of they growed right up with us we feed it water it protected put sunscreen on it when we're outside in the summer days oh we love em we absolutely love that's why God won't help us until we get to a place that we realize these things are destroying us can have a few more hours minutes you just keep a little something in your mind and keep thinking that way now remember the mind is not converted the mind has got stickers all in it now remember a preacher to you years ago they're from things that happen in our life our brain is Bill's branches from the memory zones in the cells in our brain matter those are called dendrites it's like branches of a tree that begin to branch out now depending on how deep those dendrites are engulfed in your being whenever of the past memory whether painful or Pleasant will come to those Advan of the dendrites it will release endorphins it will release all types of different emotional things about you it will either make you smile or it will make you cringe with pain it will make you feel emotionally tore all to pieces because that dendrite in your mind you remember you see a certain thing an automatically takes you back to 20 years ago this certain certain thing happened where does that come from you wouldn't even think of about that but it runs into the dendrite of your brain it these systems of cortisol will cortisone whichever it is living under stress I was reading the other day for this talking about stress and that people that live under human beings were not made to live under the age that we're living friends do you realize we are under such stress every day of our life the rapture has got to be closed I judge that not just by Israel not just by communism but by the stress levels that's on the bride how much more can she take your body will release these things from your brain automatically it happens to you now here sends this brother way with the complex now listen how devastating these things can be oh my god go back and check about the scripture and see if it's right or not then you go from there yeah don't lose the feeling of the people must remember they're not made out of sawdust they're flashing by human beings with a soul pray for me all of you if you will then of course sister way starts screaming brother realm calms the people down you could hear on tape he's gone he's gone his data said whatever is she says her brother been quite enceladus goes down prays for him cause her brother way back from the dead actually what happened was by brother branham mentioning his name it made this complex make him so resentful because of what he said he died so his complex killed him physically thank God a prophet was there thank God the word is here tonight the Prophet ain't here but the Holy Ghost is here because listen to this an indictment here recently I was gonna just quit preaching what I was going to just quit preaching the people wouldn't hear me they just kept doing the same thing you don't understand what that does to a preacher especially a pastor you preach and preach and they keep doing the same thing or worse and I got Elijah Malachi 4 Luke 1730 revelation 10:1 the seven got discouraged Emma's gonna quit what carnal sticky nature the dawning you ever get that way I don't ask me if I do ask me how many times I have I've resigned from being your pastor all my goodness at least three hundred eighty three thousand nine hundred forty seven times it was I need nothing else y'all have quit 580 faith 3947 time soon you not made up your mind you wouldn't coming back but something keeps drawing you back it's the tug it stuck on you took all me there's a Bible shine bothers us a couple of Sundays ago you give me that sign out there reading the Bible you told Moses just as the dream was that their Mountain now he takes this as a visitation from God notice this and humbled ourselves if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant spirit come around you no malice come no matter what anybody does if they're wrong don't never built up a complex against that person now we get a different Avenue that it's not only just your complex and you building one but you can build a complex against another person you be sweet and kind remember God loves you when you were in sin and the Spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's in the wrong so just pray for them in level another above everything love God and love one another and the church say praise God let's stand together let's read one more persevering to ever brother Daniel in Dallas now what's your trouble you've had an accident in that accident you were gassed with carbon monoxide gas that is true it poisons you it poisons you and your liver and you had trouble with that you've had trouble with your stomach the brother says right I want some of you two-faced hypocrites not you but those who extremist service because they always have to go back to you what I got to say if this man was an impostor and a put-on I want to know how come these people didn't call him unto his face you've had trouble with your heart right and it's made you so nervous until you built yourself in a complex you're poor you must go back to work children can you imagine can you imagine the chances of you being able to tell a person one of these things so those of you that want to lead us out of the message let me see you do this can you imagine this is an impossibility you're poor you must go back to work but you're afraid to go back to work you're afraid of the carbon monoxide gas but it's all gonna be alright now remember if Jesus Christ can tell me who you are now then things is true wasn't they if you'll tell me who you are but you accept expect it and go on back and be of good cheer will you do it your name is mr. Wagner that's right what a complex and got it on his job so the poor guy was so scared to go back to work and he got poor and needed to work but he's afraid to go back to work you imagine maybe at one time before prophet of God and God just opens up his life and tells him what had dps how many times he reads his Bible and many times he praised the day how many times he's been holding us or you keep your hair real short that's nice that's a good brother see you don't wear no earrings that's really good I see you ain't got no gold chain on that man I live you're our brother now but instead he tells him you've got a complex and you're a poor well you wouldn't want to tell some people that in front of an audience you get desperate enough you don't care what God tells you embarrass me God if you need to you barely ate me I'll tell you one thing the Word of God becomes so plain dear feels like he's got your number don't he it feels like he's honed in on you with them lasers or smart bombs and they wouldn't nobody else in the church but you I'll tell you the Holy Ghost can make it so plain though our face can get red and blood it's because we feel like everybody knows the Holy Ghost is talking to us don't get that in your mind if something to your wife the same way he's talking to your pastor the same way and everybody else that's not needing a lot he's mindful of all of our needs why does he do it children because He loves us because he understands the sticky nature well if mr. Wagner was able to get over his complex I hope mr. Kutz and mr. Walker and mr. and miss Babb and mr. miss macgillicuddy and mr. miss Smith and mr.

things like that years and years ago it ain't gonna be that that's gonna stop them it's gonna be those things deeper within themself that's been in in them for decades and until they can get a hold of

not to read into things and we know how we are we do it a preacher will say a certain thing and we'll sit there and decipher through it and try to pull a subliminal message out of what he's saying that ten thousand miles from his intent but it is our complex that's pulling it out a minister say a certain thing and because of our complex will we'll hear it through that and ponder over it and wander over and then we go home and wander and pondering send him an email or a text did you mean this or you mean that god help us to see what we're doing we're hearing the word through a fear an inferiority a complex of rejection or a complex of comparison Paul told us they to compare themselves among themselves are not wise or if each of us could just find our place and be happy Lord I'll never be a brother temprid I'll never be a brother might prize for some of these great men all I can be as what you've made me to be or god help us to be happy there with Lord we love you Lord Jesus

trying to save it in the first place you want to bring it subject praise God but when the quitting power moves from my soul out to the dirt that's when the dirt will be changed when the dirt is changed it will finally give birth to a human body without complexes god I will never reach that state of human perfection until the dirt is changed all we're trying to do is bring the dirt subject right now lord help us I pray father's still wasting our time and trying to perfect this old dirt is contaminated by humanity it's contaminated by fear it's contaminated by shortcomings the dirts got to be changed once the dirt is changed the seed soul from within will then bring the dirt to the cycle of eternity when the change sweeps over us glory to God from that new nature on the inside from the new birth will issue forth the change to the body then the dirt will be changed once the dirt is changed by the source of eternal life eternal youth will be in blue no more fears no more complexes

Lord Jesus now you were called to be priest after the order of Melchizedek as I stood at the waiting wall the other day there was a petition there that divided the women's side from the men's side and the women are not allowed to come over on the men's side actually me standing there as a Gentile I had to take the little skullcap every man that comes their house - so you stand there and you pray because the women are not allowed to come on the same side so they got a little bitty old tiny portion and the man's got a great old big gigantic portion but it's priests and daughters of God tonight you Stan you was just as much right to pray as any son of God sitting in this building whether you're a preacher are not a preacher whether you got Manning or a Yank got upended by your hamburger

may always be so sensitive by the Holy Ghost Lord that I can brag on that part which needs to be bragged upon and cut on that part which needs to be cut give the preachers of the message the wisdom of God to be able to not brag on the flesh but Lord cut on the flesh but brag on the soul we long for that balance Heavenly Father that we can be able to do it Lord when the Prophet even said about the Holy Ghost that you could preach the Holy Ghost to a place that it would discourage your congregation Lord to me that's an understanding of it father when the goat applying that which can only be applied to the soul and we apply that to the body we will absolutely discourage the congregation but may we apply that which can only be applied to the soul and then apply that which can be applied to
