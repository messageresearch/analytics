[2:08] i'd hate to think of where our lives

[2:12] i think of where they have been and
[2:15] what's
[2:16] what's been left upon our lives from
[2:18] those things which have been
[2:21] what would it be if it wasn't for the
[2:22] saving grace of god that

[2:27] let's turn to saint john for this
[2:29] morning
[2:30] we're turning there we have an
[2:31] engagement announcement brother

[2:55] he's he wanted me to let everybody know
[2:57] he's planning on staying here
[3:00] we're real happy for our brother saint
[3:04] john chapter 4 verse 16.
[3:09] very familiar scripture that we want to
[3:10] read this morning two places
[3:13] john 4 luke 7
[3:16] and if the lord would help me today i'd
[3:18] like to speak to you on scarred
[3:21] human beings scarred
[3:24] human beings john
[3:27] 4 16.
[3:31] jesus saith unto her
[3:34] go call thy husband
[3:37] and come hither the woman answered and
[3:41] said
[3:42] i have no husband
[3:45] jesus said unto her
[3:49] thou hast well said i have no husband
[3:52] for they always had five husbands and he
[3:56] whom thou hast now hast is not thy
[4:00] husband
[4:02] in that said is thou truly
[4:06] luke 7.
[4:11] luke chapter 7.
[4:20] verse 36
[4:26] and one of the pharisees desired him
[4:29] that he would eat was him
[4:31] and when he went into the pharisee's
[4:33] house
[4:35] and sat down to meet and behold a woman
[4:39] in the city which was a sinner
[4:43] when she knew that jesus said it made in
[4:45] the pharisee's house
[4:48] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[4:51] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[4:55] and began to wash his feet with tears
[5:00] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[5:01] head
[5:03] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[5:07] with the ointment the pharisee which had
[5:10] been
[5:11] him saw it he spake within himself
[5:14] saying
[5:15] this man if he were a prophet
[5:19] would have known who and what manner of
[5:22] woman this is that toucheth him
[5:24] for she is a sinner
[5:28] let's pray
[5:34] my father
[5:38] i pray today
[5:43] may i be an instrument
[5:47] that you can take
[5:51] and speak to your children today
[5:56] lord i know that we have
[5:59] lots of hurting people and scar people
[6:04] and i know there's only one way for the
[6:06] cycle of scars to be broken
[6:10] that's for you to heal us
[6:14] i pray in the name of jesus the word of
[6:18] god would come for us today and that you
[6:20] would be able to take that word and
[6:22] speak to our hearts
[6:25] and just meet our needs lord
[6:28] i ask your father that you would help me
[6:31] that i could just submit myself to you
[6:34] into your presence
[6:36] may you just anoint me and anoint the
[6:38] people
[6:40] that we can receive from you lord
[6:43] help us we ask today in the name of
[6:45] jesus christ
[6:47] amen and god good to us may be seated
[6:51] god bless you these two women that we've
[6:55] read about
[6:56] are probably two very very
[7:00] famous characters of the scripture
[7:03] and they have something quite in common
[7:09] not just the attributes of being
[7:14] a woman a female as far as being messed
[7:17] up
[7:17] sexually or by marriage or that way but
[7:21] there's actually a cause that we want to
[7:24] look at this morning
[7:26] what affected these women to be
[7:29] in the condition that they were and
[7:31] remember our thought is
[7:33] scarred human beings i believe that
[7:36] there's probably
[7:37] many of you that are sitting here today
[7:39] that many of the problems in your life
[7:43] go back and tie back to scars
[7:46] that you received either when you were a
[7:47] child maybe a teenager maybe growing up
[7:50] maybe coming from a divorced home
[7:52] maybe being raised by a single parent
[7:54] coming from a home that you lacked
[7:56] the true kind of balanced love that you
[7:59] needed
[8:00] and because of that many of us around
[8:02] the message bear those scars today
[8:05] those scars can carry on for many
[8:08] generations
[8:10] until the word of god comes and breaks
[8:13] the effect of that scar on a person's
[8:15] life
[8:16] now i want to read something to you this
[8:17] morning i want you to listen to me
[8:19] carefully
[8:19] influence and shreveport brother ben's
[8:21] talking about this little woman at the
[8:23] well i found this this week and
[8:25] these other statements i'm going to read
[8:27] to you brother bam said here she was
[8:29] standing as we would call her today a
[8:31] woman of ill fame
[8:33] a street prostitute and he said this
[8:36] child had been turned out on the street
[8:38] and let go by her parents and too many
[8:42] of them today she was a lovely
[8:44] pretty young teenage girl in her 18th
[8:48] year now this woman at the well it was
[8:51] not a woman that was in her 30s in her
[8:53] 40s in her 50s
[8:55] but the prophet of god said she was 18
[8:57] years old
[8:59] she had had five husbands and was living
[9:02] with a man that was not
[9:04] her husband what had caused him
[9:07] you know now so much of the time we look
[9:09] at her and say she was sorry she was a
[9:12] little down
[9:12] she was no good truly she was but
[9:15] actually the cause of this woman's
[9:18] behavior
[9:19] went back beyond even her own will
[9:22] it went back beyond even the influence
[9:25] of her own life she hadn't learned
[9:27] enough
[9:28] at the age of 18 years old to be exposed
[9:31] personally to sin
[9:32] on a first-hand basis but it was
[9:35] something that
[9:36] happened to her that she became so
[9:38] greatly
[9:39] influenced and her life was so scarred
[9:42] what was that scar
[9:44] a mother and a father that turned her
[9:46] out on the street
[9:48] a mother and a father that didn't have
[9:51] time to raise her
[9:52] a mother and a father that would let her
[9:54] go and not face up to the responsibility
[9:57] of bringing this child upright yet her
[10:00] name was in the book of life
[10:03] and jesus when he come to this earth he
[10:05] must needs go by some area why
[10:07] there's a child of god laying down there
[10:10] in the slum of sin
[10:12] there's a predestinated seed it's hidden
[10:14] down there in the darkness of the world
[10:16] it's all scarred up with things of life
[10:19] but yet
[10:20] its name is on the book of life
[10:24] the prophet said in her 18th year and
[10:26] just been out of high school
[10:28] but she took the wrong road in life here
[10:30] again 1962 he said
[10:32] while the disciples were gone there was
[10:34] a pretty woman that came out there and
[10:36] she was ill-famed you know what i mean a
[10:38] red light woman
[10:39] and you said she was a lovely girl but
[10:41] she there had been
[10:42] something to cause that
[10:46] and you said her mother had turned her
[10:49] out on the street
[10:50] when she was a kid we talked so much
[10:54] about juvenile delinquency
[10:56] he said it's not juvenile delinquency it
[10:59] is
[11:00] parent delinquency sometimes
[11:03] a girl goes wrong
[11:06] because her mother won't
[11:10] make her do right
[11:14] now listen to me parents as we said here
[11:16] this morning many of you your children
[11:18] are gone
[11:19] and many of you behaved in your family
[11:22] because a scar that was put on you that
[11:25] possibly was a scar that was put on your
[11:27] mother
[11:28] that possibly was a scar put on your
[11:30] grandmother
[11:31] that was possibly a scar that was put on
[11:33] your great-grandmother
[11:35] and on back and on back and on back but
[11:38] brother there's only one thing that is
[11:40] able by the spirit of god
[11:42] to break scars and that is the word
[11:45] now listen satan has studied human
[11:47] behavior
[11:48] he studied the genetics the hereditary
[11:50] makeup of human beings
[11:52] and satan found out many years ago
[11:55] that if he could hybridize the foods
[11:57] that we eat
[11:58] it would break down the cells then by us
[12:00] taking those foods in our body
[12:02] it would break down our genetic makeup
[12:05] and once a person got cancer in their
[12:08] cells
[12:08] once they got kidney trouble in their
[12:10] cells once they got these problems in
[12:13] their cells when they had
[12:14] children they in turn pass those
[12:17] problems right on down to their children
[12:19] now i'm going to tell you something safe
[12:20] to not only study that
[12:22] in the physical realm but satan knew the
[12:25] makeup of men i've spent a lot of time
[12:27] preaching to you about your body
[12:28] and i've spent a lot of time preaching
[12:30] to you about your soul
[12:32] but this morning i want to contact your
[12:34] communication channel which is your
[12:36] spirit
[12:37] you see the spirit of man is that part
[12:40] which has the effects of the memory the
[12:41] conscience and all that
[12:43] and when a person is deeply wounded it
[12:46] is not your mind that
[12:47] contains that hurt you think it is no
[12:50] it's not
[12:51] it is not your mind because your brain
[12:54] the prophet said you do not think with
[12:56] your mind
[12:56] neither do you love with your body but
[12:59] you love
[13:00] with your spirit and a wounded spirit
[13:03] is like a wounded cell how does cancer
[13:06] start
[13:06] cancer starts from a wounded cell a cell
[13:09] will be bruised and wounded and a spirit
[13:11] will come and attach
[13:13] itself to that blue cell and from there
[13:15] it forms a disease
[13:16] how are there many things in our life
[13:18] that we face even today
[13:20] because a person got their spirit
[13:22] wounded when they were a child
[13:24] or they got offended when they were a
[13:26] child maybe they got molested maybe they
[13:28] was raised up in a cold hall
[13:30] and it stored there inside their spirit
[13:33] and a person without the holy ghost
[13:35] they begin to act out this storage that
[13:38] is in their spirit
[13:39] and even a person that is born again
[13:42] with the holy ghost with their soul seal
[13:44] even though the devil may not be able to
[13:47] make you act it out
[13:48] he still holds it in your spirit it
[13:50] still causes bad memories
[13:52] it still causes bad relationships with
[13:55] other people
[13:57] now jesus you know just think what in
[13:59] the world is he doing the prophet said
[14:00] the disciples stood there and watched
[14:02] jesus
[14:02] they was talking this woman ill fame and
[14:04] they were they could not believe
[14:06] jesus was talking to such a woman like
[14:08] this and jesus said go get your husband
[14:10] now what was he doing he was contacting
[14:13] her so
[14:14] no her body no her spirit
[14:19] in her spirit was her life
[14:23] and her spirit was the storage
[14:26] of all these scars
[14:29] listen to this sometimes a girl goes
[14:32] wrong because her mother
[14:34] don't make her do that now listen for
[14:35] him you watch a woman that has been
[14:37] raised in a cold bad home
[14:39] and if that woman is not careful she'll
[14:41] do one or two things
[14:43] that woman will raise up her children to
[14:45] be
[14:46] like her or she will go the opposite
[14:49] direction
[14:50] with some leniency she will turn and put
[14:53] a deeper scar
[14:54] on them than what she has on herself
[14:57] and sometimes we think well you know i
[14:59] was raised in a cold home and
[15:01] i didn't have much love and i'm going to
[15:03] show my children how much i love them
[15:05] and we think letting them do whatever
[15:08] they want to do
[15:09] is showing love letting them come in at
[15:11] one and two o'clock in the morning
[15:13] oh well they can do whatever they want
[15:15] to do they're at liberty that's not love
[15:18] that's not expressing to them your love
[15:20] you are
[15:21] only scarring them
[15:28] oh you say man we're the message we're
[15:31] beyond this are we
[15:34] amen if i had the ability this morning
[15:36] by discernment i don't have that
[15:38] to contact every one of your spirits
[15:41] i could probably go down in there and
[15:43] find all kinds of things
[15:45] that has caused you to be the way you
[15:47] are today
[15:49] many of our marriages the reason there's
[15:51] such struggles that go on in between
[15:53] them
[15:53] it's because way back onto somewhere in
[15:56] a person's life there was
[15:57] something happen you watch a girl that's
[15:59] not raised up in the right kind of home
[16:01] and they'll have the right kind of
[16:03] relationship with her father
[16:05] and you watch that girl when she gets
[16:07] married and you watch and see what goes
[16:09] on inside her marriage
[16:10] even though she may have the holy ghost
[16:12] even though she may be a child of god
[16:14] if god does not help her to see that
[16:16] scar and heal up that scar
[16:18] in her spirit she'll never be able to
[16:20] feel toward that man
[16:22] like she ought to because she never had
[16:24] a real love from a father
[16:26] so she looks at this man as her husband
[16:28] but somehow she also looks to him as
[16:30] father
[16:31] and it's always confusing what does it
[16:33] do her children her daughters her family
[16:36] and then they come up and because of
[16:38] this she scars
[16:39] their life they scar theirs and they
[16:43] scar theirs and they scar theirs and
[16:45] they scar
[16:45] theirs and it just keeps going on
[16:49] but god has given us a word in this hour
[16:54] to get right down to where the scars are
[16:57] and that our
[16:57] spirits can be healed from scars
[17:01] that's been placed there by by parents
[17:03] that didn't care
[17:04] by preachers that disappointed you by
[17:06] people that let you down
[17:10] can you imagine this woman at the well
[17:13] 18 years old
[17:15] five husbands now living with a man that
[17:18] she's not even married to
[17:20] and what was the cause cause she had a
[17:24] mother
[17:24] that said honey do whatever you want to
[17:26] do just go ahead mama loves you
[17:29] mama was raised in a bad home and my mom
[17:32] my daddy and my mama was real strict on
[17:35] me
[17:35] and i love you and i'm going to let you
[17:38] do whatever you want to do honey
[17:44] and she did 18 years old
[17:49] married five times why
[17:52] a mama that scarred her
[17:56] life now she didn't have the real kind
[17:59] of love
[18:00] that she should have had at home so what
[18:02] did she do
[18:03] she went out looking for it out here
[18:07] and she'd marry this man and it didn't
[18:08] work out she'd marry this one it didn't
[18:10] work out she married this one it didn't
[18:12] work out she made that one didn't work
[18:13] out she married another it didn't work
[18:15] out she said i'm sick of marriage
[18:17] i'm just gonna start living with him
[18:20] what was the cause
[18:22] she was scarred
[18:26] scarred now maybe her mother
[18:30] was scarred and her mother before her
[18:32] and her mother before her
[18:33] and maybe her father and an uncle and
[18:35] this and that because you see many of
[18:37] these things friends
[18:39] are strings that runs in families and it
[18:42] affects people and it'll come right on
[18:43] down right on there
[18:45] until the person can recognize by the
[18:47] word listen you
[18:48] raising your children if you don't have
[18:50] children today
[18:51] you are sitting here as a mortal either
[18:54] you are scarring others or you are
[18:56] trying to help them get healed of their
[18:58] scars
[19:02] look at this jesus came by the city of
[19:04] psycho the several of these i just want
[19:06] to read a few of them to you
[19:07] he sent the disciples a way to buy food
[19:09] and while they were gone a little woman
[19:11] came out there pretty little woman
[19:12] maybe the child was turned out on the
[19:14] street by her parents and let her go
[19:16] anyway
[19:16] just do whatever she wanted to do talk
[19:18] about juvenile delinquency it's parent
[19:20] delinquency that's what it is
[19:22] maybe that child had the same thing her
[19:24] mother
[19:26] let her do anything
[19:33] it's easy for us to point our finger
[19:36] when our child goes wayward
[19:38] well the pastor done this the preacher
[19:41] this that the other
[19:42] it is your responsibility to raise your
[19:44] children not mine
[19:47] now i'm gonna tell you something friend
[19:48] god never give you an electronic
[19:49] babysitter call a television or a
[19:51] monitor
[19:52] for you to raise your child by there
[19:54] ain't nothing that will take the place
[19:55] of a godly father and a godly mother
[19:58] it is not my responsibility as the
[20:00] pastor of this church
[20:01] to raise your children i'm afraid
[20:04] friends we have played around and played
[20:05] around and played around
[20:07] and not been serious with this thing do
[20:09] you realize brothers listen to me you
[20:11] men
[20:11] do you realize the way you treat your
[20:13] wife if you've got a son in your home or
[20:16] a daughter in your home
[20:17] the way you treat your wife the way you
[20:19] honor her love her and respect her
[20:22] you are putting before your son then
[20:24] look son this is the way
[20:26] a real marriage is supposed to be this
[20:28] is the way you're supposed to do
[20:29] you're supposed to smack him and hit him
[20:31] and talk to him bad and be mean to him
[20:34] do you realize that's what you're
[20:36] putting before that boy god have mercy
[20:38] on the girl that he marries
[20:39] because you're scaring that boy you're
[20:41] putting a scar there
[20:43] and when he gets married he'll raise his
[20:45] son and he'll raise his son
[20:47] and he'll raise his son oh but brother
[20:50] god
[20:50] has come down in this last day to break
[20:54] the scars
[20:55] of satan on our life
[21:07] hallelujah
[21:12] her mother would let her do anything
[21:16] and she turned out to be a woman
[21:19] of ill fame now listen what the problem
[21:22] said about this prostitute we just read
[21:24] about luke 7.
[21:25] he said she made her her money by ill
[21:28] famed and she
[21:29] had a bad name among the people and she
[21:31] was just a young woman
[21:32] she had been turned out on the street
[21:34] wasn't because she was delinquent
[21:37] but because she had delinquent parents
[21:39] and they didn't try to take care of her
[21:43] now who was to blame he didn't say the
[21:46] priest
[21:47] he didn't say the clergy he didn't say
[21:49] the church
[21:51] the parents of both of these women
[21:55] that turned out to be
[21:59] the parents have pushed them off
[22:02] we don't have time for you mary we don't
[22:04] have time for you this that the other

[22:24] this morning
[22:26] do you realize you are scaring that
[22:28] child you raise up that child with no
[22:30] rules
[22:31] no regulations in your home do you
[22:33] realize what you are making
[22:35] oh i'm loving them no you're not you're
[22:37] scaring them
[22:40] look what it does maybe this mother
[22:42] thought oh i was mistreated as a girl
[22:45] and i
[22:45] love my little girl i don't ever want
[22:48] her to be scarred the way i was and she
[22:50] turned out to be a lord
[22:55] so she scars us so deeply
[23:00] she goes to looking for love
[23:03] but the kind of love she gets is the
[23:04] kind you buy
[23:06] and
[23:15] nobody really loves me nobody ready to
[23:18] scare
[23:20] you take a man and a woman a man that's
[23:23] been raised in a cold home a girl that's
[23:25] been raised in a cold home
[23:27] you put both of them together if they
[23:29] don't understand their situation ask god
[23:31] to help they will drive one another
[23:33] insane because he's wanting so much love
[23:36] she's wanting so much love and they pull
[23:39] constantly on one another why
[23:41] it's not many times because it's the
[23:43] lack of a wife love or a husband love it
[23:45] they were raised in such a home
[23:47] that their parents didn't have time to
[23:49] talk to them their parents didn't have
[23:51] time to sit down
[23:52] and put their arms around and say honey
[23:53] i love you i want you to know
[23:55] mama loves you and daddy loves you i'm
[23:57] proud of you they've never done that i
[23:59] wonder how many of you
[24:02] can recall your father
[24:05] ever putting his arm around you you see
[24:08] him son
[24:09] i'm so proud of you you're my boy i love
[24:12] you
[24:13] thank god for you i love you son
[24:17] how many of you sisters can recall your
[24:20] daddy or your mama
[24:21] look at you in the face and say honey i
[24:24] love you so much
[24:25] you have been such a joy to our home
[24:28] we so love you you said here this
[24:31] morning tell me it don't bother you
[24:33] some of you said you're 50 and 60 years
[24:35] old and when i mention this to you
[24:37] something begins to move and you know
[24:39] where it is it's your spirit
[24:41] because to the channel of memory i
[24:43] brought it back to you some of you
[24:44] already no longer than i've dealt with
[24:46] this
[24:46] already things in your childhood it's
[24:48] pop that but before you why
[24:50] it's not because the body remembers it
[24:52] so much it's not so much the soul
[24:54] but it's down inside that communication
[24:56] channel the spirit
[24:58] brother sister i don't believe god wants
[25:00] to just heal our body
[25:01] i don't believe god wants to just heal
[25:03] our soul but i believe god wants to heal
[25:06] our spirit
[25:13] when i was just a kid me and harry and
[25:16] my sisters
[25:18] we was raised there in kentucky and live
[25:20] near a patch of woods and
[25:21] we was all the time in those woods i
[25:23] knew it was out the back of my hand
[25:25] one day we went out there to have a
[25:26] picnic we come out on a little point
[25:29] over a water hole
[25:30] swimming hole we used to swim in there's
[25:32] a creek
[25:33] we come down through there and here come
[25:35] a fox running down and i'd never seen a
[25:37] fox that way before acting the way it
[25:39] was
[25:40] slobbers coming out of his mouth and
[25:41] running and oh my
[25:43] it terrified me and my sisters and harry
[25:46] and we were just small
[25:47] all of us wasn't very big i was maybe 12
[25:49] 13 years old something like that
[25:50] and it come down there and we started to
[25:53] run and my little sister she fell down
[25:55] and when she
[25:56] did that fox come over and she started
[25:58] putting her arms over her face
[26:00] to shelter herself and when she did that
[26:02] fox began to nibble on her arms and
[26:04] whenever i saw that i just couldn't take
[26:06] that that was my sister
[26:08] i wasn't no fighter i didn't know what
[26:10] to do but as any typical country boy i
[26:13] had a pocket knife in my pocket and
[26:14] i got that pocket now that i wouldn't
[26:16] cut nothing but i grabbed it out i
[26:18] couldn't stand there and let my little
[26:20] sister beat up by that animal
[26:22] and i grabbed out that pocket knife and
[26:24] when i did and i started to stab that
[26:26] fox and whenever i did
[26:27] he grabbed me right there in the hand
[26:28] and he laid my hand wide open from here
[26:30] down to here i've still got the scar
[26:31] this morning
[26:32] and every time i think of a fox every
[26:35] time i see one on the side of a road
[26:38] it comes back a flashback it happened
[26:41] so quick that fox bit me tore my hand
[26:45] open
[26:45] my sisters and my brother running me
[26:47] scared i stayed behind them being the
[26:49] oldest of the family and my hand went
[26:51] numb i didn't know what to do i broke an
[26:53] old dead limb off of a tree and
[26:55] i laid it across my arm like this can i
[26:57] thought if it comes back
[26:58] i'll hit him again and i we ran to the
[27:01] house and on the way to the doctor i
[27:02] told my mama
[27:03] i said mama please if i go if i go mad
[27:08] don't let me about the kids you know why
[27:11] i told that
[27:12] because my grandmother had told me about
[27:13] a little boy that had rabies that went
[27:15] mad and had to chain him to a bed
[27:18] now whether it's true or not i don't
[27:19] know because she could spend a lot of
[27:21] tales
[27:22] but it scarred me and as soon as i
[27:26] thought oh god i've been boxing
[27:30] i'll go mad every time i see a fox
[27:35] there's the memory of it every time i
[27:38] read about a rabid dog
[27:40] or a or something it flashes back
[27:42] something
[27:44] what is that it's a scar and those of
[27:47] you that were raised in a home that you
[27:49] didn't have the right kind of love
[27:51] and maybe you stand after church and you
[27:54] watch a father and a daughter or a
[27:55] father and a son that loving god and
[27:57] serving god
[27:58] and you see that father speaking to that
[28:00] son and you stand there
[28:02] and in your spirit you have got a moment
[28:05] of recall of how your daddy treated you
[28:11] and if you are not careful and by the
[28:13] help and the grace of god
[28:15] you will hand that or the reversal of
[28:18] that down to your child
[28:20] if you despise it and you say i'll never
[28:23] do that to my child
[28:24] i want to let my child know that i love
[28:26] it and then you just take
[28:27] all the reigns loose and all the
[28:29] boundaries loose let them come and go as
[28:31] they please
[28:32] let them do this and that and the other
[28:34] or you say well brother donnie they're
[28:35] not claiming to serve the lord you know
[28:37] they're living in my house and i'm going
[28:38] to let them do anything they want to do
[28:40] i read last week where the prophet was
[28:42] talking about sister meaty
[28:43] and women smoking he said if she ever
[28:45] takes up a cigarette she'll move out of
[28:47] this house because she ain't staying
[28:48] here
[28:49] and living that way and what are we
[28:52] doing we are scaring them with so-called
[28:55] liberty and love
[29:00] take a good lesson from god god don't
[29:03] let you do as you please
[29:04] when you please god has rules and
[29:07] regulations
[29:09] that you've got to follow that's right
[29:13] and we looked at these women their lives
[29:16] for years we've looked down say what
[29:18] that filthy prostitute
[29:21] but this morning let us turn back
[29:25] to her mother said did you ever
[29:29] think she would turn out this way
[29:33] i never thought she would do that i only
[29:36] wanted her to have
[29:38] freedom uh oh i
[29:41] i really didn't have time you see to
[29:44] raise her
[29:44] because me and my husband we wanted so
[29:47] much you see
[29:48] we wanted to borrow to buy a boat and we
[29:51] wanted to buy this and that and the
[29:52] other
[29:53] and i just didn't have time to raise my
[29:55] kids i just didn't have time because we
[29:57] wanted so many
[29:58] things you see
[30:05] and we scarred
[30:09] now there was something ordained of life
[30:11] in each of these women
[30:13] and your she comes up this woman this
[30:15] prostitute sees jesus sitting there
[30:17] scarred just like the woman at the well
[30:19] turned out on the street
[30:21] get out of my hair i'm busy i've got to
[30:24] make money i've got to do this
[30:26] you men god have mercy on your souls
[30:31] if you would father a child and bring it
[30:33] into this earth
[30:34] and not accept the responsibility to
[30:37] show that child how much you love it
[30:41] well brother donny i never come from a
[30:43] good home well brother look
[30:45] now we've got truce you can break that
[30:48] cycle you can break it and keep it from
[30:51] going on down
[30:59] my daddy never loved me like i thought
[31:01] he should either
[31:04] but by the grace of god the cycle stops
[31:08] right here i
[31:11] forbade it to go on any farther
[31:15] because i have truths my daddy don't
[31:17] know this
[31:18] my daddy maybe didn't understand the
[31:19] responsibility my daddy maybe didn't
[31:21] understand the scar
[31:23] he was going to leave on my life that
[31:25] even when i looked today
[31:26] 39 years old and i see men that are
[31:28] close to their son
[31:29] i see brother cobb and his sons how
[31:31] close they are how they talk to one
[31:33] another how they relate back and forth
[31:35] to one another and i stand there and
[31:36] look at that here i am 39 years old
[31:39] and i still miss that but i refuse
[31:43] for that to go on down into my daughters
[31:46] and scar them
[31:47] and then from theirs on down if there
[31:48] would be other generations
[31:50] i believe the scar can stop right here
[31:57] oh god
[32:00] hallelujah brother jeff jenkins was
[32:03] telling the other night in the camp
[32:05] there in ohio
[32:06] but his mother he come from a divorced
[32:08] home his mother left by the line he
[32:10] divorced him
[32:11] and brother jeff said his wife told him
[32:13] he said you've got a you've got a bad
[32:15] feeling towards your mother he said no i
[32:17] don't she said yes you do
[32:18] said because it reflects to me
[32:22] you'll talk about her nice start out
[32:23] nice but then you always wind up picking
[32:26] thrown off on her and he said then when
[32:28] you do that
[32:29] it comes back to your love toward me why
[32:31] because the man that fellowship that
[32:33] relationship with his mother
[32:34] wasn't right when he was growing up it
[32:36] wasn't exactly right so he said well if
[32:38] i have
[32:39] i want to take care of that by the grace
[32:41] of god so he flew to california
[32:43] got around his mother he said every time
[32:45] he tried to hug her she'd turn away from
[32:47] him
[32:48] said he asked his sister one day why
[32:51] does mom do that
[32:53] you said jeff she was molested by
[32:56] her uncle when she was seven years old
[33:01] so her feelings toward men
[33:05] her feelings toward men she can't trust
[33:09] me
[33:10] then she started out started living
[33:12] promiscuous having all kinds of affairs
[33:14] and this
[33:14] mother and then what did it do scarred
[33:16] her
[33:17] then she come down and scarred hers
[33:21] and what was brother jeff doing scaring
[33:23] his wife
[33:25] do you understand what i'm saying church
[33:27] do you say how cruel
[33:29] satan is many of you you may stay here
[33:31] this morning you think god
[33:33] my daddy never done this my mama never
[33:35] done this but listen friend
[33:36] maybe they were scarred too
[33:40] without looking back and the prophet of
[33:42] god had the ability to go back
[33:44] generation after generation after
[33:46] generation
[33:47] and trace it down i don't have that
[33:48] ability this morning but if you're
[33:50] sitting here in something in your heart
[33:52] that way
[33:52] and you've been scarred let's say god by
[33:55] your help
[33:56] i want that to stop with me and not go
[33:59] on in another generation
[34:03] you sitting here many of you you've come
[34:06] from scarred backgrounds
[34:08] since you started serving the lord how
[34:11] many of you said under ministries
[34:13] that scarred your heart fell from the
[34:15] word of god
[34:16] fell into into some kind of doctrine
[34:18] that wasn't right or fell after money or
[34:20] fell after women and what did that do
[34:22] that put a scar on you some of you as
[34:24] much as you love me
[34:26] you still don't trust me and i couldn't
[34:28] understand that
[34:30] because you see once anybody ever gets a
[34:32] hold of her spirit
[34:34] good enough to scar it we put up a
[34:36] shield around us
[34:38] and we let no one come beyond that
[34:41] shield
[34:43] we trust no one that closely again
[34:48] we trust no one why it's a scar
[34:52] many of you said to you you know you've
[34:53] got them
[34:56] i've shared with you my experience as a
[34:58] child things that happened to me
[35:00] how it scarred me how it's affected me
[35:04] that even now
[35:04] in the message of the hour preaching the
[35:06] gospel filled with the holy ghost
[35:08] yet there's things that still recalls
[35:10] and brings back that scar i don't
[35:12] believe it's in the soul
[35:13] because i believe my soul is sealed with
[35:14] the holy ghost but where does it contain
[35:16] that
[35:17] in that realm of the human spirit you
[35:19] watch a girl that comes out of a home
[35:21] maybe her father committed adultery on a
[35:23] mother and you watch that girl she'll
[35:25] have a hard time
[35:26] ever fully trusting her husband why
[35:30] that scar was embedded so in her spirit
[35:35] if he comes in late from work where you
[35:38] been
[35:40] where you been well i had a flat tar
[35:43] sure you did what is it that scar
[35:47] surfacing if she sees a woman looking at
[35:49] him he may never do anything out of the
[35:51] way
[35:52] but because that is so scarred inside of
[35:54] her spirit
[35:57] it scarred so deeply her motivation she
[36:00] looks at it she watches why because that
[36:02] scar is so
[36:02] bulging out it is so pierced her spirit
[36:06] it's caused girl that was molested
[36:14] as a girl or as a young woman if god
[36:17] don't help that woman when she gets
[36:18] married
[36:21] she'll never be able to give herself to
[36:22] her husband in the right frame of mind
[36:25] because every time they come together in
[36:27] a carnal act
[36:29] that that that abuse that scar will come
[36:32] before her
[36:33] and she will hate anything associated
[36:36] with sex anything anything at all
[36:40] why that scar
[36:45] that scar embedded
[36:48] into her spirit and she comes up on the
[36:52] defensive oh
[36:55] there's many of the things that you and
[36:56] i have received we receive them by
[36:58] hereditary genetics that was given to us
[37:00] by mother and father
[37:01] but there's many of the things that we
[37:03] of god people have done
[37:05] it to us people
[37:08] i've been scarred by preachers i've been
[37:11] scarred by laity
[37:15] i love you my friends with all of my
[37:16] heart
[37:18] i love you i want to help you
[37:21] i want to help you beyond your scars
[37:24] but you see all of us if you're very old
[37:27] here this morning teenager you've
[37:28] probably been hurt by teenagers
[37:30] you've probably been heard by young
[37:31] people in this church and satan starts
[37:33] out so young
[37:35] trying to scar our lives let me read you
[37:38] a couple of them
[37:39] what's the cunningness of this enemy i
[37:42] probably said
[37:43] i see you you're 16 years old you're
[37:45] running as hard as you can run
[37:47] you've got a great big ribbon tighten
[37:48] your hand you've got a double plat
[37:49] hanging down the back
[37:50] you got to check her dress on you're
[37:52] running real fast
[37:54] there's a big yellow dog chasing him
[37:58] i want you to think this woman was maybe
[38:00] one opportunity in a lifetime to stand
[38:03] before the prophet of god
[38:04] and he tells her a dog chased her why
[38:08] in her spirit that fear
[38:12] is still there maybe her mind forgot
[38:16] about it as a matter of fact she said
[38:17] she did she said then she said another
[38:19] checkered dress and i said the young
[38:20] lady said
[38:21] she began to scream out and she was
[38:22] standing in front and said i had never
[38:24] thought of that in
[38:26] my life it was not just so much in the
[38:29] brain up here
[38:30] but it was laying there inside the
[38:32] spirit why do you think the prophet of
[38:33] god
[38:34] would try to contact people's spirit he
[38:36] wasn't reading their mind because their
[38:38] mind didn't know everything
[38:39] the mind does not have total recall it
[38:42] is not the brain that is scarred
[38:44] it is the spirit
[38:48] and he would contact your spirits matter
[38:50] of fact he said let this i've got to
[38:51] contact your spirit first
[38:53] so i can see what's happened in your
[38:55] life
[38:58] now if you repented from it there's
[38:59] something that's healed over god can't
[39:01] even show it to the prophet because it's
[39:02] done take care of
[39:03] but if it's something that's laying
[39:05] there that is a cause of something else
[39:06] oh you say what difference does it make
[39:08] friends scars can cause cancer
[39:10] scars can cause worry scars can cause
[39:14] nervousness scars can cause marriage
[39:16] problems financial problems
[39:18] and yet you look at it and you figure
[39:20] out and you try to figure out
[39:21] everything and you don't know the answer
[39:23] here is the answer to many people
[39:26] it's a scar that lives deep
[39:29] deep within him
[39:34] i want to tell you something
[39:38] some of you people you've been so hurt
[39:41] for preachers
[39:44] somebody used to didn't have no
[39:46] confidence in preachers at all
[39:48] i remember the johnson family when i
[39:49] first started getting around them and
[39:50] going preaching for them and stuff
[39:52] they were so scarred and so hurt
[39:56] and so wounded when i started preaching
[39:59] for them they want me to come up and
[40:00] i said well we'll take care of your
[40:01] motel room and give you offer and i said
[40:03] i'll come on one basis
[40:04] no offer i'll buy my gas and i'll buy my
[40:08] motel room
[40:09] that's the only reason and the only way
[40:10] i'll come
[40:12] because they've been around so many
[40:13] preachers because they had a business
[40:15] and they come around with their hands
[40:16] out like this
[40:18] give me give me kimmy
[40:23] amen and for a while i had to put up
[40:26] with some preacher jokes
[40:28] you know what i mean this offends y'all
[40:29] you know you know i preached this and
[40:31] preachers that and preacher the other
[40:33] but somehow i felt like whenever i met
[40:35] him that
[40:36] god because they don't know the times
[40:38] after i'd seen them in virginia or here
[40:40] or wherever it was
[40:41] that god would lay them on my heart and
[40:42] i'd wake up in different hours of the
[40:44] morning and night
[40:45] and god just put a burden out and go to
[40:46] praying for praying for them because i
[40:49] knew
[40:49] they had been so hurt and so offended
[40:51] and it was a scar
[40:52] laying there but i felt like don't take
[40:54] it the wrong way now i felt like that
[40:56] god had put in me
[40:58] a portion of the bomb of gilead and that
[41:02] god hallelujah
[41:03] not through me now because i can't do
[41:04] anything no more than you can but god
[41:06] listen friend how many people out there
[41:08] are hurting and maybe god could pour
[41:10] some bomb
[41:11] inside of you to be able to help
[41:13] somebody that's been scarred
[41:15] a lot of people don't think there's any
[41:17] christians anymore anymore that's living
[41:19] right but let
[41:20] god use you to prove to them that's not
[41:22] right
[41:27] scarred so embedded
[41:30] so so prevalent
[41:34] their lives wrapped around it
[41:37] but i've seen the holy spirit begin to
[41:39] take the word not my personality because
[41:41] i ain't got much i want
[41:42] but take that word and just begin to rub
[41:45] some ointment
[41:46] on that scar and they let down a little
[41:48] bit more every time i get around them
[41:50] let down a little bit more a little bit
[41:52] more a little bit more
[41:54] and many of you have been the same way
[41:56] you've been so hurt and so
[41:58] scarred do you think it's the
[41:59] personality of donnie reagan or some
[42:01] other man
[42:02] that could ever heal you i tell you no i
[42:04] don't have the ability and there is no
[42:06] other man that can heal you brother
[42:07] from scars is taking place inside of
[42:09] your heart and those scars may always be
[42:12] there but i don't think god wants it to
[42:14] be a constant open
[42:15] festering sower that is all the time
[42:18] gurgling out infection
[42:19] and putrefication but god wants it to be
[42:22] healed
[42:23] that we can put it behind us and call
[42:30] scarred human beings
[42:34] listen to this the first thing i read
[42:37] was 1950 this is another 1951 different
[42:40] individual
[42:41] you've had some really good teaching in
[42:43] your life but you've had many sorrows
[42:45] too
[42:45] you had a great scare one time in your
[42:48] life
[42:49] something happened to you when you was a
[42:51] school girl it was a dog
[42:53] i see him barking after you and you
[42:56] jumped and screamed
[42:58] it's when you was a child now that
[43:01] scarred
[43:02] that little girl's spirit she went to
[43:05] this doctor and that doctor and tried
[43:07] this and tried that and tried the other
[43:08] but it didn't lay so much in her body
[43:10] her body was
[43:12] only reflecting something that satan had
[43:14] attacked when she was wounded as a child
[43:18] i preached this up in ohio the lord gave
[43:20] it to me while i was gone and there was
[43:21] a minister brother been around the
[43:22] message for years and years and years
[43:24] he come to me after the service and he
[43:25] was crying and he said you know he said
[43:27] i i've had nervousness all in my life
[43:30] and he said i've never heard anything
[43:31] like this he never heard it replaced
[43:32] this way
[43:33] and he said well i sat there tonight he
[43:35] said something was brought back to my
[43:37] memory that i had
[43:38] that i hadn't even tied together in this
[43:40] way he said when i was a little boy a
[43:42] friend of mine we was camping out in the
[43:43] woods one night
[43:44] and he said the next morning when we
[43:46] come out there was some senior boys that
[43:48] come out from the highest school
[43:49] and he said they carried a double barrel
[43:51] shotgun and he said they loaded both
[43:53] barrels of that gun
[43:54] and they pulled back both hammers and
[43:55] they stuck it right to my face
[43:57] and that barrel laid right against my
[43:59] skin he said i've never been so scared
[44:01] in my life
[44:02] he said i trembled i shook i quivered he
[44:05] said but when i heard that word tonight
[44:07] he said i thought oh god
[44:09] maybe that's been the cause of my
[44:11] problem all these years
[44:13] that i didn't know what it was
[44:16] scars scores
[44:22] here's another one 1953 you've always
[44:25] been
[44:26] a little bit nervous when you was a
[44:28] little girl
[44:30] coming home from school that stinking
[44:33] low down rotten devil
[44:37] studying the makeup of human beings
[44:39] saying this demon would get on this dog
[44:41] to scare this person
[44:42] to scar their entire life he would watch
[44:46] another person with their makeup this
[44:47] same trick will work on them
[44:49] the same trick will work on them same
[44:50] trick will work on them and it scarred
[44:53] that individual
[44:54] and they carry that all of their life
[44:56] and not even know and realize what took
[44:58] place
[45:01] think of it satan anointed a dog
[45:08] exactly right and that dog come out and
[45:11] scared this little girl and now
[45:12] once in a lifetime opportunity stands
[45:15] before the prophet of god
[45:17] you don't say your name's on the book of
[45:18] life you have ordained you but this that
[45:20] the other
[45:20] but it goes back to way way way back
[45:24] to a deep deep scar
[45:29] because from that scar has come this
[45:32] and that and this and that and that
[45:36] expose the scar wash it by the bleeding
[45:40] word
[45:41] and the infections will leave are you
[45:44] hearing me this morning
[45:47] oh lord god
[45:50] hallelujah i see you coming from school
[45:55] and i see you going towards a dog
[45:59] and you got frightened by it way back he
[46:01] had on a little
[46:02] checking dress remember that it's all
[46:06] over now
[46:07] you can be made well what's that got to
[46:10] do it's been sick
[46:12] a scar and from that scar
[46:16] from this and this and this here's
[46:19] another one 1956.
[46:21] now the very thing that's here knows
[46:23] your life and i see you way back when
[46:24] you was a little girl
[46:26] you was running from something it was
[46:28] chasing you it was a dog
[46:31] you was coming from school and it scared
[46:34] you
[46:35] and you've been nervous all of your life
[46:40] now if an animal a blue beast
[46:44] could scar a human being what about
[46:47] someone called
[46:49] your mother
[46:52] someone calls your uncle that you're
[46:55] over at his house one day
[46:58] and he begins to do things with you as a
[47:00] little girl
[47:02] that isn't right
[47:06] if a dog anointed by
[47:10] a demon scholar human being's
[47:13] spirit what about a man that is called a
[47:16] pastor
[47:18] that feels he has so much liberty he can
[47:20] begin to date sisters and
[47:22] brother his wife take the money and do
[47:25] this and that
[47:26] and you trust him you have confidence in
[47:28] him
[47:29] when you find it out it puts a great
[47:32] big scar right across your spirit
[47:37] maybe not out loud but what they knew
[47:38] you say
[47:40] i'll never trust another man like that
[47:43] never i'll
[47:46] never have confidence that one another
[47:48] man
[47:50] this is it that's why some of you used
[47:53] to look at me and shake my hand
[47:55] but you've got that long distance look
[47:57] in your eye you know what
[47:59] scar i'm not asking you to make me
[48:03] you're absolute not at all you do that
[48:05] you're farther away from god than you
[48:06] was in the beginning but i can never
[48:08] help you
[48:09] if you don't have confidence in me
[48:11] that's right
[48:12] brother branham could never help us if
[48:13] we didn't have confidence that god's in
[48:15] his ministry
[48:16] friends don't look to me i'm not saying
[48:17] that at all you know what i'm saying
[48:18] you've heard me preach enough to know
[48:19] i'm not telling you to look at me
[48:21] but as long as satan by our scars i
[48:24] wonder this morning if we
[48:25] somehow would we could have a spiritual
[48:27] x-ray machine
[48:28] that would x-ray the spirit of human
[48:30] beings and only the spirit
[48:32] only the spirit and place before you
[48:34] here on a gigantic screen
[48:36] as you would pass under the spiritual
[48:38] x-ray for scars
[48:40] many of you would be scarred from one
[48:42] end of the other
[48:44] your memory has been scarred your
[48:46] conscience has been scarred
[48:47] your affection has been scarred some of
[48:49] you the reason you can't love your wife
[48:51] the way you ought to
[48:52] because you come from a family to word
[48:54] that the love wasn't right in your home
[48:56] and what are you doing you all the time
[48:58] accusing her she don't love me enough
[49:00] she don't love me enough she don't love
[49:02] me enough
[49:02] and many times friends it goes right
[49:04] back to them scars
[49:05] that a person received at a childhood
[49:07] and many people that have been all next
[49:09] mixed up in sexual promiscuity before
[49:11] they come to the word
[49:12] many times that thing will scar their
[49:14] life it'll scar
[49:16] their life and the devil will be there
[49:17] to torment you but i'm here to tell you
[49:19] this morning
[49:19] we have one that knows all about scars
[49:22] his name is jesus
[49:24] he was scarred by his friends leaving
[49:26] him he was scarred by the ministry
[49:28] turning him down he was kind by knowing
[49:30] human beings didn't care for him but he
[49:32] was able to stand there by it all
[49:34] and conquered every bit and that lord
[49:37] jesus is here to help you
[49:39] face your scars
[49:47] here's another one a boy now 1957.
[49:51] you're suffering from a nervous
[49:53] condition
[49:54] you've had it since she was a little boy
[49:56] since she was a kitty at school
[49:58] he got scared one time coming from
[50:01] school
[50:03] it was a dog crossed your path
[50:07] it's been many years ago
[50:12] i hear the prophet contacts this man's
[50:14] spirit
[50:16] the communication channel he looks
[50:18] searches by the spirit of god
[50:20] looks down inside that spirit
[50:22] imagination conscious memory reason
[50:24] affection what happens when a person
[50:27] loses their mind when they go insane
[50:29] their spirit actually roams remember the
[50:31] prophet of god talking about the woman
[50:32] and he had to go out there and get her
[50:34] spirit
[50:34] why you know why people go insane they
[50:36] don't have no memory memory don't lay on
[50:38] the brain
[50:39] amen it's not so much the brain that
[50:42] itself sure the spirit impregnates and
[50:44] puts it upon the organs it's in the body
[50:46] but it lays within the spirit the
[50:47] prophet said you have to go out there
[50:49] and search for their spirit and bring it
[50:50] back to their body
[50:52] that's why they can give people all
[50:53] kinds of medicine they can diagnose them
[50:55] with this and that and the other
[50:56] but they don't have the ability brother
[50:58] frank to go out there and contact that
[51:00] spirit and bring it back inside that
[51:01] body
[51:02] remember they're probably talking about
[51:03] the little girl that was up there in
[51:04] indiana and she lost her mind
[51:06] and he said he had to go out there and
[51:08] find her spirit and whenever the spirit
[51:09] of god helped him to contact this little
[51:11] girl's spirit
[51:12] she sat there and looked at him and said
[51:13] i'm brother random don't you remember me
[51:15] she just sat there and said don't you
[51:16] remember me
[51:17] you used to call me billy you was a
[51:18] little bitty girl and he said all of a
[51:20] sudden i caught the spirit and said ever
[51:22] since she was a little girl you've
[51:24] always wanted to marry a preacher and he
[51:26] said as soon as i said that
[51:27] that broke white down inside of that he
[51:30] caught that spirit roaming out yonder
[51:32] somewhere
[51:33] and he brought it back to the body and
[51:35] by that he was able to get a hold of
[51:37] that scar
[51:40] set her free
[51:46] you got real scared one time coming home
[51:49] from school
[51:52] you know what probably many of you today
[51:58] got scars when you went to school
[52:01] it was scars when bro boys would bring
[52:04] books to school
[52:05] that would display women's naked bodies
[52:10] you got to looking at things you
[52:11] shouldn't looked at the school you was
[52:13] exposed to cursing and foul language
[52:16] and it's so polluted and scarce
[52:19] i know what it's like to go to school
[52:21] and try to live for the lord i wasn't
[52:22] living in this message
[52:23] but whenever i was a young kid going to
[52:25] school them boys would bring all kinds
[52:26] of books to school because they
[52:27] tormented me every day
[52:28] there wasn't a day went by but they
[52:30] didn't torment me
[52:32] call me preacher call me moses call me
[52:34] holy roller call me all kinds of things
[52:36] they'd bring books i'd just be standing
[52:38] there at the locker standing in the
[52:39] lunchroom somewhere minding my own
[52:40] business
[52:41] they'd bring books and just hold them
[52:42] wide open and put them before my face
[52:44] i'd close my eyes they'd try to
[52:46] stick their fingers in my eyes and open
[52:47] my eyes i know what it can do
[52:49] but you see i had something even at that
[52:51] time that was greater than that scar
[52:53] they were able to imprint
[52:55] and i knew that it wasn't right to look
[52:56] at such stuff as that amen brother
[52:58] donnie
[52:59] but many of you maybe you didn't have
[53:01] that at that time in your life and it
[53:02] scarred you
[53:03] and because of that it even bothers you
[53:06] today
[53:07] even a haunts oh i hope somebody showed
[53:09] me this morning
[53:10] and then we look at it and we wonder god
[53:12] why can't i go on with you
[53:14] what is this problem in my marriage what
[53:16] is this problem in my life scars
[53:27] here's another little boy in 1963 a man
[53:29] standing in he says
[53:31] it's not for you sir it's for your
[53:34] little boy
[53:36] you believe god can tell me his trouble
[53:40] he's nervous it was caused
[53:44] from a dog scaring him
[53:51] a dog scares a boy
[53:54] affects his spirit a demon of
[53:56] nervousness comes
[53:58] and anoints that affection that that
[54:01] bruised part of that spirit you
[54:04] understand what i'm saying
[54:07] but here stands the word of god veiled
[54:10] in a man
[54:11] a prophet of malachi 4. and he said i
[54:14] want to tell you
[54:16] what your son's trouble is it's this and
[54:18] this but the cause
[54:21] is this
[54:24] see friends we so much of the time try
[54:27] to deal with symptoms
[54:28] me and my wife we fuss we argue i've got
[54:31] this problem with this and
[54:32] that's good that is only symptoms
[54:35] what is the cause
[54:41] and you come to find out let me just
[54:43] close
[54:45] we'll pick it up some other time
[54:48] many times people think they have
[54:50] forgiven people
[54:52] that have scarred their lives i like
[54:55] what brother ham said and humbled
[54:56] thyself in 1963
[54:58] no matter what anybody ever does to you
[55:01] don't never hold nothing against them in
[55:03] your heart because if you do
[55:05] you will build a complex
[55:10] oh we're free from that are we
[55:11] apparently brother brown didn't know it
[55:14] apparently he didn't know it whenever he
[55:16] built one standing in the gap 1963 and
[55:19] he said i
[55:20] let the sick lay you imagine a prophet
[55:23] of god
[55:24] he was a human being i let the sick
[55:27] lay didn't even go pray for
[55:30] let him lay i built such a complex
[55:35] why people scarred his life
[55:39] people scored his life
[55:43] now you deal with scars from this side
[55:44] you laity
[55:46] ministry deals with it from another side
[55:49] you try to give your life to people and
[55:50] preach the gospel
[55:51] you hear people talk about your people
[55:53] in your own church you think
[55:55] my what am i doing what am i
[55:57] accomplishing
[55:58] you know what it is satan trying to take
[56:00] someone that maybe didn't even think
[56:02] when they said it
[56:03] or maybe whoever told it added to what
[56:05] they said and satan's trying to take
[56:07] that
[56:08] and scar your spirit
[56:12] so when you get up to preach it affects
[56:15] you
[56:16] when you study it affects you when you
[56:18] get ready to schedule meetings
[56:20] it affects you see scars scars
[56:25] and sometimes you can think i i forgive
[56:27] that person i know if i forgive them
[56:29] have we really
[56:33] it's hard
[56:36] i told you before the preacher
[56:39] molested me as a kid took me years
[56:43] in years and years to be able to look
[56:46] that man in the face
[56:48] and not want to mash his mouth
[56:51] it took me a long time to get to a place
[56:55] where i could look at that man
[56:58] not feel something raised up within me
[57:00] that i would want to kick him
[57:02] i'd want to hit him i'd want to just
[57:04] mash him in the face
[57:09] a scarf scar
[57:14] but today by the help of the lord
[57:19] i believe i can shake hands with that
[57:21] man
[57:22] i believe i can look him right in the
[57:24] face and so i feel no
[57:27] remorse towards you still
[57:30] it has put a scar that any time i'm
[57:33] alone with a brother
[57:34] when preachers come and pick me up at
[57:36] the airport and they turn a tape on
[57:38] they even move their hand it scares me
[57:42] i watch every move you know why that
[57:45] scar for a brief
[57:52] moment
[58:06] foreign
[58:12] praise jesus
[58:16] jesus wants to help you with this
[58:22] many of you if you could stand and take
[58:24] this microphone this morning
[58:26] you could tell them scars they would
[58:29] break the heart of the hardest person in
[58:31] the world really
[58:33] to hear your life what some of you been
[58:36] through
[58:36] mine's small compared to a lot of you
[58:40] but yeah you said this morning you know

[58:46] record

[1:07:08] let me
[1:07:09] show you something for him you watch
[1:07:10] people you watch them
[1:07:13] many people that come out of a horrible
[1:07:15] church split
[1:07:16] or where a pastor has spelled and
[1:07:18] offended the people
[1:07:20] you watch many of the people that come
[1:07:21] out of that assembly and you watch their

[1:07:31] nervousness many of them will come down
[1:07:33] with all kinds of things because they in
[1:07:34] their heart even though the man was
[1:07:36] wrong
[1:07:36] even though the man done wrong they
[1:07:38] themself
[1:07:39] was not able to forgive him and once you
[1:07:41] hold something within your spirit
