[16:20] needed healing for a diagnosis of cancer

[41:57] blessed human being that's right a lot
[42:00] of folks that like to heal like Jesus
[42:03] they wouldn't mind even walking on water
[42:05] like Jesus raising the Dead Like Jesus
[42:09] being able to do all kinds of things of
[42:12] their own sort what they would pick but
[42:16] I wonder how many wants to be hated
[42:20] despised
[42:22] rejected Jesus reputation was not made
[42:26] among messeng
[42:27] people his reputation was made among
[42:33] Liars
[42:35] prostitutes
[42:36] thieves Tax Collectors the number one
[42:40] IRS agent in
[42:43] Israel and you imagine the Lord Jesus
[42:46] taking an IRS agent as W say and said I
[42:49] want you to write a book I'll even let
[42:52] it be called after your name the Book of
[42:55] Matthew now some of us we wouldn't have
[42:58] give them the time of day cuz we're so
[43:01] holy and so Pious and so high and mighty
[43:04] ain't we I'll tell you friends I don't
[43:08] want to have that attitude
[43:10] myself I want to be like Jesus amen so
[43:14] my reputation is made among those that
[43:18] other folks won't have nothing to do
[43:20] with so be if my reputation is made
[43:23] among those that are have a terrible
[43:26] evil rep reputation God Saves evil
[43:29] people some of the most evil people I
[43:31] ever dealt with in my life are church
[43:33] people anyway sometimes Ain can be mean
[43:35] or the rattlesnake twice as fast so well
[43:40] praise the Lord that's a good greeting
[43:41] wouldn't it how yall doing we're good
[43:44] you good all right praise the lord well
[43:47] we certainly appreciate the kindness of
[43:49] the Lord to us and want to say we had a
[43:52] a really good youth service over in
[43:55] North Carolina the Lord really
[43:57] moved and blessed the services there and
[44:00] brother Andrew of course always does a
[44:01] great job and brother digs done done a
[44:05] really good job as well and had a prayer
[44:07] line on Saturday night and I'm still
[44:09] hearing of the things that the Lord
[44:11] Jesus done it was absolutely wonderful
[44:14] to see what our Lord done and how he
[44:17] came by I got several uh things today
[44:21] and just absolutely phenomenal what the
[44:24] Lord is doing Matthew chap 6:
[44:31] 25 therefore I say unto
[44:34] you take no
[44:38] thought for your
[44:41] life what you shall eat or what you
[44:45] shall
[44:46] drink nor yet for your
[44:49] body what you shall put
[44:52] on is not life more than meat and the
[44:56] body
[44:58] than Raymond let me read it to you again
[45:01] now therefore I say unto you take no
[45:06] thought for your life look at the word
[45:10] thought take thought be careful to be
[45:16] anxious or in other words to have
[45:22] anxiety now would not this be the common
[45:25] thing that most of us would be so
[45:28] concerned about why could Jesus say such
[45:31] a thing take no thought for your life
[45:36] what you shall eat or what you shall
[45:38] drink near yet for your body what you
[45:42] shall put on is not the life more than
[45:45] meat and the body than
[45:47] rment now look in verse
[45:50] 31 therefore take no Sal
[45:55] saying what shall we eat
[45:58] eat or what shall we drink again the
[46:01] same word there thought is to be anxious
[46:04] for so Jesus is not saying well don't go
[46:08] to the grocery store and don't plan your
[46:11] meals
[46:12] and don't even worry about it I mean
[46:14] just happy gol lucky just be like the
[46:16] birds and The Sparrows you know just sit
[46:18] around the house and twiddly thumbs and
[46:20] wait on God to drop something out of
[46:21] Heaven he's not saying that to us but
[46:25] what he wants to get over to us is that
[46:27] we are not so anxious and so tore up
[46:32] listen how he breaks this down what
[46:34] shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we
[46:37] be clothed for after all these things do
[46:42] the Gentiles
[46:44] seek oh wow wonder why he didn't say
[46:49] Jews for all these things the Gentile
[46:52] seek so then we as Gentiles maybe we
[46:56] need to pay pay special heed to this
[46:59] since Jesus specifically this is a
[47:03] racial
[47:06] scripture it's aimed for the race of the
[47:10] Gentiles in
[47:12] particular amen and some of the Gentiles
[47:15] said all right okay for your heavenly
[47:19] father
[47:20] knoweth that you have
[47:23] need of all these things
[47:28] but seek you
[47:30] first the kingdom of God and his
[47:35] righteousness and all these
[47:38] things shall be added unto you so you
[47:42] see it's not that he doesn't want us to
[47:44] pray over it and think about it but he
[47:47] doesn't want it to be the priority of
[47:50] our life the first priority will be the
[47:52] kingdom of
[47:53] God verse 34 take therefore no Sal
[47:58] anxiety to be anxious tore up worried
[48:01] for the
[48:02] moral for the
[48:04] moral shall take
[48:07] thought for the
[48:10] things of
[48:13] itself who ever thought tomorrow could
[48:18] think you see why the words of the Bible
[48:21] can seem absolute foolishness to people
[48:25] who go just by education and
[48:27] signs for the martal shall take thought
[48:30] for the things of
[48:32] itself sufficient unto the
[48:36] day is the
[48:38] evil
[48:41] thereof now I mentioned to you the
[48:43] prayer line for a
[48:46] reason brother Jason and them do their
[48:48] prayer line a little bit different there
[48:50] at the
[48:51] yam so they have two preachers up here
[48:55] two here two here two here and two there
[48:59] like five different
[49:01] positions then the deacons will bring
[49:05] people up to these two these two these
[49:08] two instead of one guy having to pray
[49:11] for basically
[49:13] everybody then it kind of divides it
[49:16] up so he wanted to
[49:19] put brother Diggs and myself together
[49:22] and then other brothers that they pick
[49:24] to put together brother Diggs and I kind
[49:26] of stood in the
[49:28] middle and I noticed as we started
[49:31] praying that it was one after another
[49:36] after
[49:37] another after another after
[49:41] another after
[49:43] another and this one
[49:46] word kept being requested prayer for
[49:53] anxiety
[49:54] anxiety some of those you were standing
[49:57] in the prayer line for their
[49:59] parents cuz some of the parents wasn't
[50:02] going to
[50:03] church some of the parents had got cold
[50:05] on God and the youth were standing in
[50:09] for their
[50:10] parents some of the requests are just
[50:13] heartbreaking of course they're private
[50:14] anyway so I'm not going to tell it any
[50:15] all but I was so curious so the next
[50:19] morning which was on Sunday morning the
[50:22] ministers was back in the office there
[50:23] to pray before the service started so I
[50:27] asked the rest of the brothers that was
[50:29] praying here here and and there I said'
[50:31] Brothers I'm just curious did you all
[50:34] get a lot of request for
[50:38] anxiety and every one of those preachers
[50:41] which had doubled up every one of them
[50:44] said it was the biggest request that
[50:46] they prayed for brother Jason spoke up
[50:49] and said brother Donnie I've noticed it
[50:50] in the last two years he said last year
[50:53] anxiety was 3 to one
[50:57] three to one greater than every other
[51:01] need that was
[51:03] mentioned some were oppression some were
[51:07] you know just different stress and
[51:09] things like that but after that on
[51:13] Sunday and then I talked to a couple
[51:15] more preachers afterwards and and they
[51:17] said the exact same thing one after
[51:19] another after
[51:22] another so since I've come home on
[51:24] Sunday afternoon I've not been able to
[51:27] get this off of my
[51:29] heart so I'm going to speak to you
[51:32] tonight on
[51:33] freedom from
[51:36] anxiety
[51:38] nervousness
[51:40] oppression
[51:42] fear and
[51:47] depression and if you'll listen tonight
[51:49] to the word of the
[51:52] Lord and you'll be able to open your
[51:55] hearts in faith
[51:57] some of you will not even need
[52:01] prayer he'll deliver you as you're
[52:04] hearing the
[52:06] word
[52:08] amen let's pray together shall
[52:17] we heavenly
[52:20] father I stand here tonight at your
[52:23] bidding
[52:27] Lord
[52:29] God you see our needs we know that they
[52:32] are
[52:34] many you know the needs of your children
[52:36] around the
[52:38] world father we've come here tonight to
[52:41] report for
[52:44] service dear God all we can do is
[52:46] prepare ourself and as a minister I can
[52:49] pray and study and
[52:52] then as you give me inspiration and I
[52:54] break into the channel of your anointing
[52:57] then try to put it together as best I
[53:01] can and Lord as I set
[53:05] Monday and I went downstairs to study
[53:10] and your anointing
[53:13] came to where I was and I sat there
[53:15] father
[53:16] for a couple of
[53:19] hours under your
[53:23] presence Hallelujah
[53:28] after a bit I got up a little bit after
[53:30] 9: and went up get me a little something
[53:33] to
[53:33] drink Carol said you okay I said yeah
[53:36] I'm just
[53:38] exhausted been sitting under the
[53:41] anointing so Lord I
[53:43] believe you have something in your heart
[53:46] for us
[53:48] tonight so dear God we ask you that you
[53:51] just come and speak to
[53:54] us Lord I bind every devil every demon
[53:59] spirit that would try to hinder us
[54:02] tonight speak to us from your words
[54:06] father Hallelujah we look to you tonight
[54:09] for you are our deliverer our Mighty God
[54:14] take charge of this service May every
[54:17] evil spirit be brought subject to the
[54:21] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[54:24] it's in his name and he is the word that
[54:26] we ask
[54:27] it amen and the Saints said amen God
[54:32] bless you you may be
[54:40] seated as I've done a little research
[54:42] and looking
[54:44] on anxiety and stress
[54:47] and I
[54:49] found so many therapists and counselors
[54:53] that are constantly coming up with
[54:57] methods to help people deal with
[55:01] anxiety the three three three method and
[55:07] then the five five five method and the
[55:12] 10 10 10 method so it's to breathe in
[55:18] for 3
[55:20] seconds hold it for 3 seconds and
[55:24] breathe out for 3 seconds
[55:26] then someone else said breathe in for 5
[55:30] seconds hold it for 5
[55:34] seconds but I've got a remedy tonight
[55:37] amen it's not the three five or
[55:41] 10 it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:44] amen being Christians we know that we're
[55:48] not exempt from anxiety and
[55:52] trouble notice again Jesus in Matthew
[55:54] 10:18 says and you shall be brought
[55:57] before Governors and Kings for my sake
[56:00] for a testimony against them and the
[56:04] Gentiles but when they deliver you up
[56:07] take no thought again same word anxious
[56:12] anxiety take no thought how or what you
[56:17] shall speak now I want you to notice
[56:19] that Jesus is saying these things and it
[56:22] would be the exact opposite of what our
[56:26] human human tendency would be so if we
[56:30] knew we were going to be brought before
[56:31] a tribunal a governor a police officer a
[56:35] judge and we're going to be questioned
[56:38] about what we believe the church we go
[56:41] to what we stand for why why do you
[56:43] women dress the way you do why do you
[56:45] men do the way you do and there could be
[56:49] some kind of consequences for us doing
[56:51] this then the natural thing would be for
[56:53] us to become very anxious would it not
[56:57] kind of troubled about it and okay what
[56:59] what will I say and how will I go about
[57:01] saying it now you see what Jesus is
[57:04] trying to set us
[57:06] straightforward that we would not rely
[57:09] on our own ability and we would not
[57:12] become anxious which would go in on our
[57:15] nerves and then we would come to a spot
[57:19] to where we would try to talk our way
[57:21] out of this situation but he said don't
[57:24] become anxious if you before the judges
[57:27] don't think about what you'll even think
[57:28] or speak for it shall be given
[57:32] you in that same hour what you shall
[57:37] speak so what would premeditated
[57:39] thoughts do no doubt make a mess and it
[57:43] might even make a coward out of us
[57:44] because we might think of a way to
[57:46] compromise and get out of it so look at
[57:49] what Jesus wants to replace anxiety with
[57:54] arama word from God so it will be given
[58:00] you in that hour what you shall speak
[58:04] for it is not ye that speak but the
[58:08] spirit of your father which speaketh in
[58:12] you now look at what we
[58:15] trade what we trade for the spirit of
[58:19] God leading us and speaking out of us we
[58:22] get
[58:23] anxiety or we can go the the other way
[58:27] and trade our anxiety back send it back
[58:30] down to Hell where it come from and let
[58:32] our father give us the right words to
[58:35] say which do we
[58:39] want notice again in Luke 10:41 and
[58:42] Jesus answered and said unto her you're
[58:45] familiar with the scripture I know
[58:46] Martha
[58:48] Martha Thou Art careful exact same word
[58:53] anxious or anxiety never remember
[58:56] Martha got upset at
[58:59] Mary cuz Martha was fixing Jesus food
[59:03] and drink and all of that hey that would
[59:05] be an important thing would it not
[59:07] sisters if Jesus was at your house and
[59:09] you'd want to feed him and you'd want to
[59:11] take care of him but yet her sister was
[59:14] constantly wanting to sit at the feet of
[59:15] Jesus and be able to eat of the Mana so
[59:19] Jesus has to turn and he doesn't
[59:22] actually rebuke Mary but he actually
[59:25] speaks to Martha
[59:26] and Jesus answered and said her Martha
[59:28] Mara Thou Art careful or anxious and
[59:33] troubled about many things
[59:39] but well I guess I don't understand why
[59:42] that we as Believers add to this
[59:45] scripture and we add this one word
[59:52] million one million and ain't that the
[59:56] way life is oh I got to do this and we
[59:58] got to go there and we got to do this
[59:59] and we got to go that that's contrary to
[1:00:02] the words of the Lord Jesus when it's
[1:00:05] all said and done when it comes right
[1:00:07] down to Deaths and it comes down to the
[1:00:10] reality of God according to what the
[1:00:12] Lord Jesus said there's one thing
[1:00:14] needful all the rest of it all you say
[1:00:17] oh I can't do it without I can't do
[1:00:18] without it but if you're put in the
[1:00:20] hospital tomorrow and you're in a coma
[1:00:22] could you do without it so if you were
[1:00:25] in a car ready and you were laid up and
[1:00:26] you broke every bone in your body oh
[1:00:28] I've got this great appointment I've got
[1:00:30] to do this I've got to do that I've got
[1:00:31] to do that can it be put on hold it can
[1:00:33] be so notice how Jesus now sets it in
[1:00:37] order but one thing is needful Mary hath
[1:00:42] chosen that good part which shall not be
[1:00:47] taken away from her now Mar say it may
[1:00:49] make you upset but I will not take this
[1:00:53] from Mary now believe it or not most of
[1:00:56] us have both a Martha and a Mary in our
[1:01:00] own makeup so we have things that we can
[1:01:03] be so upset and so troubled about and we
[1:01:07] will let the Needful Things Go aren't
[1:01:10] you glad though the Lord Jesus is
[1:01:12] merciful notice in Philippians CH 4: 6
[1:01:16] same word be careful for nothing now
[1:01:22] Paul is not telling us to live a
[1:01:24] halfhazard life and PA don't even worry
[1:01:26] about them I you know drive down the
[1:01:28] road 90 M an hour around a 5505 m m hour
[1:01:32] curve and don't worry about this just
[1:01:33] drive Reckless don't don't be careful
[1:01:35] about nothing he's not saying not to be
[1:01:38] careful but he's talking about
[1:01:41] anxiety and being
[1:01:43] anxious as I begin to study these
[1:01:46] scriptures the other day as the Lord
[1:01:48] begin to put together for me each
[1:01:50] scripture that I read I begin to ask for
[1:01:54] more help
[1:01:56] Lord help me y'all already asking Lord
[1:02:00] help me Lord help me why because it's
[1:02:04] our human makeup it's our human nature
[1:02:08] for many of us to become so anxious and
[1:02:11] to become so worried and so Laden down
[1:02:15] and we allow the devil to Rob us of the
[1:02:18] blessings of God be careful or anxious
[1:02:22] for nothing but in every
[1:02:26] Thing by prayer in supplication with
[1:02:31] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[1:02:34] known unto God now the same Greek word
[1:02:37] there which means exactly what I told
[1:02:39] you that is to be anxious notice again
[1:02:41] Peter says in 1 Peter 5: 7 casting all
[1:02:46] your care upon him for he
[1:02:51] carth for you now you know what I found
[1:02:53] amazing was the same
[1:02:58] word so the reason we don't have to be
[1:03:03] anxious is because Jesus is for
[1:03:10] us so why should most of us do
[1:03:13] it I mean it's not human anxiety of
[1:03:16] course but Peter chose to use a word
[1:03:20] that you'd think it wouldn't even match
[1:03:22] his Heavenly Body it wouldn't even match
[1:03:26] his his glorified state but to draw from
[1:03:30] it that would be able to pour out to us
[1:03:33] how concern the Lord Jesus is about what
[1:03:38] we go through in life casting all your
[1:03:41] care upon him because for he carth for
[1:03:46] you now watch the prophet as he was here
[1:03:50] and he was dealing of course with many
[1:03:53] many people and their troubles and he
[1:03:55] said the uncertainty of the security of
[1:03:58] the nation not only this nation but all
[1:04:00] nations because little Nations can just
[1:04:04] got the same weapons that the big
[1:04:07] Nations has got we can certainly say
[1:04:09] Amen to that in this day can't we the
[1:04:11] security is certainly uncertain and we
[1:04:14] don't know just what there's unrest
[1:04:17] among the people now if it was that way
[1:04:19] in 1961 can you imagine what it is now
[1:04:22] traveling around from Nation to Nation I
[1:04:25] find that everyone seems to be
[1:04:29] nervous and the psychic Wards are
[1:04:32] filling up and the people down the
[1:04:35] street there seems to be so much
[1:04:39] anxiety and they rush just as hard as
[1:04:42] they can till they don't have courtesy
[1:04:45] even one for the other and I noticed it
[1:04:49] amongst all people they go down the road
[1:04:52] at night and the man will diem his life
[1:04:56] and the next man won't dim his lights
[1:05:00] just go on and pay no attention to it
[1:05:03] let him go let him go and blind him as
[1:05:08] necessary that's
[1:05:10] Pentecostal
[1:05:13] cursing now I w't ask how many of you
[1:05:15] tonight are Pentecostal cursors so when
[1:05:18] you meet somebody and they've got their
[1:05:19] lights on bright and you reach over and
[1:05:21] flip yours on bright that'll show you
[1:05:23] buddy you just cussed
[1:05:28] uh oh guilt is a hound dog in the hen
[1:05:30] house I didn't see it right now now
[1:05:33] watch our brother Brandon would pick
[1:05:35] this up no I know this is not deep it's
[1:05:38] not a great tremendous great Revelation
[1:05:41] I'll tell you why we can't get no deeper
[1:05:43] because we think things like this don't
[1:05:46] matter amen let him go blind him as
[1:05:50] necessary that's Pentecostal cursing you
[1:05:52] see let him alone oh he says we
[1:05:56] shouldn't have done that no matter what
[1:05:57] the other fell does let's show what
[1:06:00] we're made of let's get something down
[1:06:05] in here to show love and respect and
[1:06:10] respect the next man and love him
[1:06:14] whether he's
[1:06:17] right come on now friends we're
[1:06:21] separating bride from
[1:06:24] Brites I hate to be the bear of bad news
[1:06:26] but we've got a lot of folks around this
[1:06:28] message they're just simply brandit
[1:06:30] that's all they are they will not go in
[1:06:32] the Rapture they'll go straight to the
[1:06:34] tribulation period you think this flood
[1:06:36] is something I told Carol yesterday we
[1:06:38] talking about I said you know people
[1:06:40] look around I'm I'm just marvel at the
[1:06:42] kindness and the generosity of people
[1:06:44] and what all people are doing but I told
[1:06:46] her said can you imagine in the
[1:06:48] tribulation period it'll not be the way
[1:06:50] it is right now in this flood time and
[1:06:52] disaster relief it'll be every man every
[1:06:55] woman every boy and every girl fending
[1:06:58] for themsel because they will be
[1:07:00] starving they will be looking the Bible
[1:07:03] says they will cry they will seek for
[1:07:05] peace and safety they will cry for the
[1:07:08] rocks and the mountains to fall upon
[1:07:10] them it will be as it was when the Lord
[1:07:13] Jesus told oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how of
[1:07:16] I would have gathered thee together if
[1:07:18] thou would have only known the time of
[1:07:21] thy visitation and Jesus said there will
[1:07:24] not be one stone left upon the other and
[1:07:27] we know of course whenever Josephus
[1:07:29] wrote about what went on that the people
[1:07:31] would wait in the streets and the people
[1:07:33] of Jerusalem would die and they would
[1:07:36] fight over who got their body to eat
[1:07:40] it they ate the bark off the trees they
[1:07:43] ate grass they ate bugs they ate ropes
[1:07:48] they ate animal skins and hides it was
[1:07:51] every man for
[1:07:52] himself you imagine whenever the blood
[1:07:55] of the Lord Jesus Takes the bride there
[1:07:58] will be no genuine love left on the face
[1:08:03] of the Earth people will kill one
[1:08:06] another for food they will absolutely
[1:08:09] turn into hell oh Lord Jesus let us miss
[1:08:14] it
[1:08:14] father notice there'll be no love
[1:08:17] there'll be no respect notice he said if
[1:08:20] you just love those who love you the
[1:08:23] Sinners do the same thing but we're
[1:08:26] different when Christ has come into our
[1:08:28] heart we love those who don't love us
[1:08:32] love the unlovable can Word of Life say
[1:08:35] Amen to this quote tonight love the
[1:08:38] unlovable and we were unlovable one time
[1:08:42] too and we were unlovable one time too
[1:08:46] and you know Christ loved us until we
[1:08:49] came to him then if we be of Christ and
[1:08:52] Christ is in us we have the same Spirit
[1:08:56] of fellowship and cooperation and
[1:08:59] helping to try to move the great load
[1:09:02] and make life a little easier for our
[1:09:06] fellow men and the church said oh I know
[1:09:10] this is not a convention quote it's more
[1:09:13] of a Wednesday night quote but it's a
[1:09:15] pretty good quote anyway isn't it we
[1:09:17] want to make life a little bit better
[1:09:20] for people and not just for those of
[1:09:22] course that we love but for those that
[1:09:24] are absolutely
[1:09:25] unlovable now because the age is so
[1:09:29] anxious and we know that the
[1:09:31] pre-tribulation period is already among
[1:09:34] the people now and we can see the
[1:09:37] nations of the world have turned against
[1:09:40] Israel over and over again more human
[1:09:42] resolutions uh uh have been passed
[1:09:45] against Israel than all the rest of the
[1:09:46] nations of the world put together and
[1:09:49] they seem to be looking for another
[1:09:50] excuse by which they can penalize Israel
[1:09:53] and now of course our president and
[1:09:55] blinking are telling Israel if they
[1:09:58] don't do this and this and this that
[1:10:00] they are facing an arms embargo and
[1:10:03] remember Israel and their Iron Dome and
[1:10:05] their David slang and all of that they
[1:10:07] may have helped invent that but they
[1:10:10] cannot afford to buy every one of those
[1:10:12] missiles to be able to shoot them down
[1:10:14] because they average from 30,000 some of
[1:10:17] them up to
[1:10:19] $200,000 a piece so whenever they're
[1:10:22] sending two and 300 missiles at a time
[1:10:25] then you count 50,000 100,000
[1:10:28] 150,000 easy in a few days you can wind
[1:10:32] up spending millions of dollars so what
[1:10:35] does our great nation do they put them
[1:10:38] under pressure you do what we tell you
[1:10:41] or we will not send you missiles to
[1:10:43] defend yourself now remember being a
[1:10:46] friend with America comes with a great
[1:10:49] price because America will give you
[1:10:52] money as long as you do what America say
[1:10:55] you know the sad part about it is we got
[1:10:57] folks in church that do the same thing
[1:10:59] oh I'm the greatest Pastor they ever
[1:11:01] seen in their life until I do something
[1:11:04] they don't approve of and then boy they
[1:11:05] get mad in the Hornet and they claim to
[1:11:07] be filled of the Holy Ghost well I'll
[1:11:10] tell you one thing I'm glad my Holy
[1:11:12] Ghost helps me to love those that
[1:11:14] differs with me come on somebody but
[1:11:17] America that's part of being her friend
[1:11:20] you do what we say do and then we'll
[1:11:23] reward you yeah that's the way they are
[1:11:25] so then it puts Netanyahu it puts the
[1:11:28] liud party it puts shenet it puts the
[1:11:31] mad it puts all of these things in
[1:11:34] Israel under a great deal of pressure
[1:11:37] and even though they're looking at it
[1:11:39] and they think this is the best thing
[1:11:41] for us to do but our government says no
[1:11:44] we don't want you to do that and we can
[1:11:46] see the same way in our own life this
[1:11:49] person tells you to do this this one
[1:11:51] tells you to do that you get you know
[1:11:53] influenced by your job you get
[1:11:55] influenced by people on social media as
[1:11:58] I was reading this week that even some
[1:12:01] of the Hollywood leftists that is left
[1:12:03] as they can be that they have started
[1:12:05] limiting their children's time on the
[1:12:08] internet and their children's time on
[1:12:11] social media because they've been having
[1:12:14] to take some of their children to get
[1:12:17] therapy because of so many hours that
[1:12:20] they're spending in social media and
[1:12:23] especially young girls
[1:12:26] because they see the images and the body
[1:12:29] shapes and forms and they look at theel
[1:12:32] and they don't find themselves as pretty
[1:12:35] unattractive as them images that are put
[1:12:37] on there and they they go through all
[1:12:40] kinds of this thing suicide rates have
[1:12:42] went up why it's not bringing them peace
[1:12:45] it's causing more anxiety so they
[1:12:49] they're constantly bombarded is anybody
[1:12:52] going to say Amen with me tonight it is
[1:12:54] more anxiet Y and more anxiety every day
[1:12:58] that we live in and what does it cause
[1:13:01] and that anxiety runs in on our nerves
[1:13:04] which God gave us of course what would
[1:13:06] we be without nerves but Satan knows how
[1:13:09] to multiply that to create or cause a
[1:13:12] nervous tension watch this he said we're
[1:13:15] living in a neurotic age nervous tension
[1:13:18] everybody racing here going there going
[1:13:21] nowhere and it's just that kind of an
[1:13:23] age and I know this church of be plagued
[1:13:25] with it as everywhere is plagued with it
[1:13:28] he said the Tabernacle is plagued with
[1:13:30] it everywhere you mean to tell me the
[1:13:33] church our brother brandom was plagued
[1:13:36] with nervous tension oh my you
[1:13:40] understand setting in brother brandom's
[1:13:41] church was people that had been married
[1:13:44] three and four times do you understand
[1:13:47] there was people sting in brother bram's
[1:13:49] church that had all kinds of trouble all
[1:13:52] types of anxieties so for those of you
[1:13:55] that are looking for a perfect church
[1:13:57] that has nobody in it that's been
[1:13:58] remarried nobody in it that has problems
[1:14:01] and issues I hate to be the bad bad bad
[1:14:04] news tonight but you ain't going to find
[1:14:07] one cuz there is no such a thing the
[1:14:09] Ephesian church is not perfect the
[1:14:11] church at Corinth was not perfect the
[1:14:14] church at galatia was not perfect but
[1:14:16] what you need to do is find the church
[1:14:18] where God has ordained you to be there
[1:14:21] get behind it with all your might and
[1:14:23] your strength and if you got a man God
[1:14:25] that's telling you the truth get behind
[1:14:27] him and pray for him and instead of
[1:14:29] trying to add his trouble pray for him
[1:14:32] that God will lead
[1:14:34] him praise the Lord love your brothers
[1:14:37] and sisters do what you can to help one
[1:14:40] another but notice brother brandom
[1:14:42] identifies it now he's preaching another
[1:14:43] one of the local churches are in
[1:14:45] Jeffersonville so he was referring to
[1:14:47] that church and also his church the
[1:14:49] Tabernacle is played with it everywhere
[1:14:51] the whole world it's a day of pressure h
[1:14:55] hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and
[1:14:59] wait oh my hurry hurry hurry up and wait
[1:15:03] Drive 90 oh my goodness 90 miles an hour
[1:15:06] and then get home for supper and wait
[1:15:08] two hours till it gets ready that's
[1:15:11] right it's the time in that rushing and
[1:15:14] speeding it gets you to a nervous
[1:15:17] tension the wife say something a little
[1:15:20] contrary and you want to fly off temper
[1:15:23] husband say something and you'll patch
[1:15:25] your foot and tell him to get in the
[1:15:26] room see well now husband I don't want
[1:15:29] no words with you you get out there wife
[1:15:31] I'm so nervous see why what's the matter
[1:15:35] all this together this tension building
[1:15:39] up then the results of it is doing
[1:15:42] something wrong and acting out of
[1:15:48] place that's right so it builds up and
[1:15:51] then you do something wrong and then you
[1:15:55] act out of your place that's right now
[1:15:58] it'll make the poor act that way it'll
[1:16:01] make the middle class we're hearing a
[1:16:03] lot about the middle class we always do
[1:16:06] in the election year so let let bring in
[1:16:09] the middle class from another
[1:16:11] perspective shall we the middle class
[1:16:14] will act that way it'll make the rich
[1:16:17] act that way so you got the lower class
[1:16:19] the middle class and the upper class
[1:16:21] sound lot to me it covered everybody on
[1:16:23] the earth don't you so the all like that
[1:16:25] what if you speak to the kitty come in
[1:16:28] your mama oh there you are it builds up
[1:16:30] oh my you feel like you're notice you
[1:16:33] feel like you're going to your heads
[1:16:37] going to come
[1:16:41] off I
[1:16:44] know I'm with it every
[1:16:49] day so I know what it means you mean
[1:16:53] Elijah that with that kind of pressure
[1:16:57] every day no days
[1:17:02] off Church age book each age had it it
[1:17:05] pressures for example a great burden of
[1:17:08] the last age is the pressure of riches
[1:17:12] self living and nervous
[1:17:16] tensions in a complex age that we seem
[1:17:22] unfitted to live in
[1:17:26] you understand the majority of people on
[1:17:29] the face of the Earth today are fitted
[1:17:32] for this age you're
[1:17:35] not you're they are fitted to live in
[1:17:39] drunkenness and blindness in Le DEA it
[1:17:43] don't make them sick they're all looking
[1:17:46] for a great time they figure if they can
[1:17:48] flip the hide house and get Trump in
[1:17:50] there boy the whole thing's going to
[1:17:51] turn upside down I agree it's going to
[1:17:54] turn up upside down it don't matter no
[1:17:56] difference who gets in there this nation
[1:17:58] is done my hope is not on November the
[1:18:02] 5th my hope is in the coming of the Lord
[1:18:06] Jesus now watch this there's a
[1:18:09] difference between being
[1:18:13] nervous and a
[1:18:16] demon of
[1:18:19] nervousness anointing
[1:18:22] you now remember God made us with nerves
[1:18:27] emotions and
[1:18:29] feelings un let everybody be
[1:18:32] attentive and be
[1:18:37] careful but when a
[1:18:40] demon of
[1:18:42] nervousness will start moving on an
[1:18:47] individual it's it's more than they
[1:18:51] normally would
[1:18:53] feel it's similar but beyond what they
[1:18:57] normally deal with in their
[1:19:00] nervousness now watch this 5 years ago
[1:19:03] when I was here I saw you now listen to
[1:19:06] this this is a discernment and in the
[1:19:08] vision the prophet recalls seeing this
[1:19:11] this individual five years before when
[1:19:15] he was in Jonesboro
[1:19:16] Arkansas I saw you you went through a
[1:19:20] line or something you was healed then
[1:19:24] between you and I comes a dark
[1:19:30] shadow it's
[1:19:33] shaking
[1:19:34] and
[1:19:37] jumping there's only one thing that can
[1:19:41] mean that's a
[1:19:44] demon a
[1:19:46] demon of
[1:19:51] nervousness so it's everybody then that
[1:19:54] would have bouts of nerves is that a
[1:19:57] demon not
[1:19:59] necessarily but can you imagine then for
[1:20:02] all of this nervous
[1:20:05] age that if we would allow a demon of
[1:20:09] nervousness to jump on us and we're
[1:20:13] already nervous
[1:20:14] anyway then here would come this
[1:20:19] jerking
[1:20:20] shaking demon
[1:20:29] is that right now notice what this Demon
[1:20:32] Done to this individual it's a
[1:20:37] woman you think sometimes you've lost
[1:20:41] your
[1:20:43] mind isn't that
[1:20:45] right but he's a
[1:20:50] liar now want you notice how he
[1:20:52] separates this he does not call this
[1:20:54] this Christian woman a
[1:20:57] liar
[1:20:58] Hallelujah he does not call this woman a
[1:21:02] liar but he addresses what is anointing
[1:21:06] her
[1:21:07] thinking and you'll never find him ever
[1:21:09] referring to a demon as a
[1:21:14] her so he wants this woman to
[1:21:18] see where this is is coming from now he
[1:21:22] said he's a liar
[1:21:25] you're not you're just the same as
[1:21:28] anybody else but he's trying to get you
[1:21:32] down
[1:21:33] lady Oh Glory to God don't you pay no
[1:21:39] attention to
[1:21:42] that now I want you to watch him now as
[1:21:45] he
[1:21:47] challenges this demon thou
[1:21:51] devil in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[1:21:56] exposed come out of the woman Leave Her
[1:22:01] Go rejoicing

[1:22:37] cross I can
[1:22:39] make it leave

[1:22:45] back it's it's causing this presence now
[1:22:49] he couldn't stay here if you had
[1:22:52] to but it'll come
[1:22:55] back but if the good man of the House's
[1:23:00] face isn't
[1:23:02] there you've wanted a place to start you
[1:23:05] see friends this is what happens to
[1:23:06] people sometimes they come and get
[1:23:08] prayed for and God will do something for
[1:23:10] them and they may feel better for an
[1:23:12] hour two maybe a day maybe a week and
[1:23:15] that thing will try to come
[1:23:18] back you understand what happens when
[1:23:20] the men of God that are called and
[1:23:21] ordained of God to pray for you and if
[1:23:24] they've been given delegated authority
[1:23:27] by the Lord Jesus and to make that devil
[1:23:30] leave then that devil when you're away
[1:23:33] from that man of God and you're feeling
[1:23:37] weak and you don't feel the anointing
[1:23:40] you don't feel the presence of the Lord
[1:23:43] that's when he will try to come back oh
[1:23:46] brother Donnie's out of town oh my
[1:23:47] goodness brother Daryl Arizona oh my
[1:23:49] where's brother John where's brother Joe
[1:23:51] where's brother Pete where's all the
[1:23:52] brothers that oh no oh no but but
[1:23:54] remember if you've got the good man of
[1:23:57] faith in your soul if I'm a thousand
[1:24:00] miles away the good man of faith is
[1:24:03] resident in your
[1:24:05] soul now that's keep this in mind that's
[1:24:08] when the devil will try to attack you
[1:24:11] and many times it'll be when you're by
[1:24:15] yourself oh my what this now you've
[1:24:19] wanted a place to start now start from
[1:24:21] here Lord in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:24:26] watch this Shadow Of Darkness like a
[1:24:31] Mist hanging at the woman in the name of
[1:24:36] Jesus Christ
[1:24:39] demon of
[1:24:41] nervousness leave the
[1:24:51] woman now go and
[1:24:55] rejoice
[1:24:57] look be
[1:25:00] happy just
[1:25:02] rejoice and thank God it'll
[1:25:07] stay away from
[1:25:10] you just believe
[1:25:15] it now you imagine a man that was called
[1:25:19] by God to
[1:25:21] break into that type of Realm
[1:25:25] and whenever he would
[1:25:28] see this this sphere of
[1:25:31] demons some of them would look like
[1:25:35] bats and have long
[1:25:38] hair hanging down
[1:25:41] off an epilepsy devil would look like a
[1:25:46] tortoise
[1:25:48] shell now I'm quoting to your
[1:25:53] quote why why would they take on such
[1:25:55] form I don't have a clue I'm just glad
[1:25:58] God gave us a window to the supernatural
[1:26:01] in the end time to be able to unveil
[1:26:03] that
[1:26:04] devil do you believe the same Lord Jesus
[1:26:07] is here tonight to set you free from
[1:26:09] nervousness if you've got
[1:26:12] it listen to me friends as I'm reading
[1:26:15] these quotes to you if your faith can
[1:26:18] rise to that level you can be free as I
[1:26:23] read it
[1:26:24] several years ago I had an Affliction in
[1:26:27] my body and always really really
[1:26:29] Troublesome and really been bothered me
[1:26:31] I was listening to a tap and I was down
[1:26:33] the basement building something and and
[1:26:36] while I was listening to the discernment
[1:26:38] there and the presence of God came in
[1:26:40] that little room where I was and I
[1:26:42] thought wow it's strange I mean it was a
[1:26:44] really good tape I've already been
[1:26:45] blessed but it was just something that
[1:26:47] just like could swep in you know what
[1:26:48] I'm talking about you felt it before
[1:26:50] yourself and brother Brandon it was
[1:26:52] before that he did it as serman and he
[1:26:54] called someone out and told them exactly
[1:26:58] the same thing that I was
[1:27:00] experiencing and what I found was
[1:27:02] something like leaped within me and that
[1:27:06] thing left my body right there now you
[1:27:09] see we want the message of the hour to
[1:27:13] be not just something that was recorded
[1:27:15] back 1955 and 1965 and 1958 I believe
[1:27:20] that same thing if we will receive it in
[1:27:22] the right way it can happen to you right
[1:27:25] here
[1:27:28] tonight watch this let's go now to
[1:27:31] oppression Judges 6: 7 and it came to
[1:27:36] pass when the children of Israel Cried
[1:27:38] unto the Lord because of the midianites
[1:27:40] that the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[1:27:42] children of Israel which said unto them
[1:27:45] thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I
[1:27:47] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[1:27:49] you forth out of the house of bondage
[1:27:51] and I delivered you out of the hand of
[1:27:53] the Egyptians and out of the hand of all
[1:27:57] that oppressed you look at what the word
[1:28:00] oppressed means to
[1:28:03] squeeze to
[1:28:06] squeeze and
[1:28:09] press I get in your
[1:28:11] mind is you would take a lemon a
[1:28:15] lime or an orange or something that
[1:28:19] you're trying to get the juice out of it
[1:28:24] and you
[1:28:25] squeeze and if you do what Carol does
[1:28:28] when she gets limes which are harder
[1:28:31] she'll roll it on the
[1:28:33] counter or if I'm there she'll have me
[1:28:35] to do it if I'm not there she'll take a
[1:28:38] hammer take it on the back porch and
[1:28:42] soften the outside of it and then roll
[1:28:45] it because you get more juice out of it
[1:28:48] so this is the word that the auar of
[1:28:51] Judges used this is what they were doing
[1:28:53] to you in Egypt you understand demons
[1:28:56] out of hell are trying to squeeze the
[1:28:59] very life out of
[1:29:03] us oh

[1:41:02] from The Fellowship of the saints of God
[1:41:05] to torment you to get you off by
[1:41:08] yourself and every friend you lose and
[1:41:10] every friend that you cut off you get
[1:41:12] weaker and weaker and weaker what you
[1:41:15] want to do weaken you down till you get
[1:41:18] to a place you can't take it no more and

[2:08:06] hallelujah friends you believe I was led
[2:08:08] of the spirit of God you trust me as
[2:08:11] your
[2:08:13] pastor I got an email today before I
[2:08:15] come to church from someone in South
[2:08:17] Africa the streams are service and they
[2:08:19] were so tore up and so tore to pieces
[2:08:22] because a preacher there in South Africa
[2:08:24] had been preaching around to the people
[2:08:26] that the Millennium was going to start
[2:08:29] tomorrow you ought to thank God for the
[2:08:32] men of God that come to our church to
[2:08:34] preach us the truth instead of a bunch
[2:08:35] of garbage you imagine brother Steve
[2:08:38] facing what you're facing in your life
[2:08:40] and you're sitting under some kind of
[2:08:41] trash and garbage that preachers say God
[2:08:45] told him to
[2:08:47] preach let's believe together
[2:08:52] Hallelujah Heavenly Father we have our
[2:08:55] hands laid one upon the
[2:08:58] other Earthly Brothers touching Earthly
[2:09:01] sisters husbands and
[2:09:04] wives siblings mothers and fathers
[2:09:07] touching their children deacons reaching
[2:09:10] out of their place and touching
[2:09:12] others musicians
[2:09:15] singers Lord God we need you tonight
[2:09:19] Jesus Lord God I believe father that
[2:09:22] your
[2:09:22] word is the power that will cause demons
[2:09:26] to leave and the presence of the Holy
[2:09:29] Ghost is here right
[2:09:31] now so father we within ourself would
[2:09:36] never come against such an army as hell
[2:09:39] how could we come against beings that
[2:09:43] stood before your throne that were one
[2:09:46] time holy created angels how in the
[2:09:48] world could I ever stand against such
[2:09:51] I would be an idiot to do so but father
[2:09:54] with you living in us we are more than a
[2:09:57] match for the devil
[2:09:59] tonight I believe you have got men of
[2:10:01] God on the earth tonight they are called
[2:10:05] hallelujah oh thank you Lord to cast out
[2:10:08] Devils out of your children father then
[2:10:11] the prophet would have us to lay our
[2:10:14] hands over on one another Eagle to Eagle
[2:10:18] believer to believer then Lord we
[2:10:21] believe that that can also Minister
[2:10:24] strength to one another maybe just
[2:10:26] another little bit of faith that would
[2:10:29] help them Lord to believe for whatever
[2:10:31] it is they have need of oh God I pray
[2:10:35] right now in the name of Jesus would you
[2:10:38] heal the sick would you deliver those
[2:10:41] that are bound father maybe some father
[2:10:44] God under that oppression of the devil
[2:10:47] may they be set free tonight father
[2:10:50] maybe some of these discernments
[2:10:52] described exactly the way they feel and
[2:10:55] we have no problem in believing that
[2:10:57] because even though those people that
[2:11:00] those Spirits were on then have been
[2:11:03] dead for many many years yet Spirits do
[2:11:06] not die so we can see the same traits on
[2:11:10] people decades thereafter but that also
[2:11:13] means the Holy Ghost has not die so the
[2:11:17] same holy ghost that made them demons
[2:11:19] leave in 195 8 and
[2:11:23] 1965 can make them leave right here
[2:11:25] tonight so we're calling on you tonight
[2:11:28] Lord Jesus bring healing to our troubled
[2:11:32] hearts father I pray Lord God in Jesus
[2:11:35] name make them free from oppression set
[2:11:40] them free from Suicidal Thoughts set
[2:11:43] them free oh God from nervousness may
[2:11:47] they walk out of this building tonight
[2:11:49] oh God in the name of Jesus Christ free
[2:11:54] from the power of the enemy and if that
[2:11:57] devil tries to come back may that good
