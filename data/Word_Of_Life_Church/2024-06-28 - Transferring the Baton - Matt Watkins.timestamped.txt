[1:07:58] amen if you have your Bible let's turn
[1:08:00] to 2 Kings chapter 2 2 Kings chapter
[1:08:08] 2
[1:08:10] amen I just love the presence of the
[1:08:13] Lord I realize when I'm in that kind of
[1:08:16] presence you know this is what I was
[1:08:18] this is where I was made to be amen I
[1:08:21] don't fit in out there in the world this
[1:08:22] is right where I fit in prophet of God
[1:08:25] said you know you get to church
[1:08:27] sometimes and you get in the atmosphere
[1:08:28] and he said you know sometimes you want
[1:08:30] to cry sometimes you want to shout other
[1:08:33] times you just want to be quiet he said
[1:08:35] and he you don't really know what's
[1:08:36] happening prophet of God said I tell you
[1:08:38] what's happening you're bumping into
[1:08:40] another
[1:08:42] dimension and I say Lord I want to bump
[1:08:44] into that Dimension tonight let Angels
[1:08:47] let me bump into an angel a minister in
[1:08:49] spirit tonight amen we can move from
[1:08:52] this natural into the supernatural amen
[1:08:54] from this Dimension to a Heavenly
[1:08:56] Dimension 2 Kings chapter 2 I want to
[1:08:59] minister to you and I'm going to title
[1:09:01] this transferring the
[1:09:04] Baton and it came to pass when the Lord
[1:09:07] would take up Elijah into Heaven by a
[1:09:09] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah
[1:09:13] Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto
[1:09:16] Elisha D here I pray thee for the Lord
[1:09:21] hath sent me to bethl and Elisha said
[1:09:24] unto him
[1:09:25] as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:09:28] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[1:09:32] went down to
[1:09:33] bethl verse four says and Elijah said
[1:09:36] unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee
[1:09:39] for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and
[1:09:42] he said as the Lord liveth and as thy
[1:09:45] soul liveth I will not leave thee so
[1:09:49] they came to Jericho verse 6 says and
[1:09:52] Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee
[1:09:55] here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan
[1:09:59] and he said as the Lord liveth and as
[1:10:01] thy soul liveth I will not leave thee
[1:10:05] and they too went on the prophet of God
[1:10:08] actually says that the cities of bethl
[1:10:10] and Jericho and Jordan represented the
[1:10:12] church moving through the Lutheran age
[1:10:14] the Methodist age through John Wesley
[1:10:17] and then Pentecost would represent that
[1:10:19] Jordan River but notice Elisha it was
[1:10:21] important to go to justification but he
[1:10:24] couldn't stay there yeah it was
[1:10:26] important for him to go to
[1:10:27] sanctification that was an important
[1:10:29] step but you can't stay there come on
[1:10:32] somebody you got to stay with the word
[1:10:35] where the word
[1:10:36] moves if you want to cross Jordan you
[1:10:39] got to come through all three and Elisha
[1:10:42] says I'm not going to leave you Elijah
[1:10:44] I'm staying right beside you notice what
[1:10:47] he says here in verse 8 Elijah took his
[1:10:51] mantle and wrapped it together and smoke
[1:10:53] the waters and were divided hither and
[1:10:56] thither so that they too went over on
[1:10:59] dry ground and it came to pass when they
[1:11:01] were gone over that Elijah said unto
[1:11:06] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee what
[1:11:10] a powerful thing another word sister
[1:11:14] Hattie whatever you
[1:11:21] say whatever you say notice brother bham
[1:11:24] says Jehovah Gyra he says that when
[1:11:27] hadie said those words not when she
[1:11:29] thought those words not when she had it
[1:11:32] in her heart but when she let what was
[1:11:34] in her heart come out into her mouth you
[1:11:37] see your words have the power to change
[1:11:39] your atmosphere you think it's not
[1:11:41] important for you to say Amen to the
[1:11:43] word of God when the word's being
[1:11:44] preached you got fear swirling around
[1:11:47] you speak the word of God and watch
[1:11:49] those words disturb the atmosphere in
[1:11:51] your
[1:11:52] life oh Hallelujah
[1:11:55] brother bham says in another place when
[1:11:57] she spoke those words and says that's
[1:11:59] nothing but the truth brother bham amen
[1:12:03] the prophet said it felt like the room
[1:12:05] was about to come
[1:12:08] apart the Bible says he says ask what I
[1:12:11] shall do for thee now notice this here
[1:12:14] and Elijah said I pray thee let a double
[1:12:18] portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he
[1:12:23] said thou has asked hard thing now
[1:12:26] notice it wasn't going to be hard for
[1:12:27] Elijah he was going home it's surely not
[1:12:30] hard for God then who is the hard thing
[1:12:35] for brother bham as Janny Henry says the
[1:12:39] prophet prophecy says uh you didn't
[1:12:42] choose this you you I didn't force you I
[1:12:45] didn't choose this for you but it's your
[1:12:47] choice because you chose a harder way
[1:12:51] there's a great portion of Heaven that's
[1:12:52] awaiting for you nevertheless notice
[1:12:55] this I want you to notice something so
[1:12:57] powerful here in your Bible that maybe
[1:13:00] you've never caught before notice when
[1:13:02] Elijah says to Elijah he gives them the
[1:13:04] condition of this double portion and
[1:13:07] it's actually amazing because he says to
[1:13:09] him if thou see me when I'm taken from
[1:13:13] thee it shall be so unto thee but if not
[1:13:17] it shall not be so do you know when you
[1:13:20] actually transliterate what Elijah said
[1:13:23] is he's actually saying Elijah
[1:13:25] Elisha I'm going to go and when I go you
[1:13:28] have to see me as taken from
[1:13:32] you because if you're standing here
[1:13:35] still waiting for Elijah to come back
[1:13:38] and you're still focused on Elijah in
[1:13:40] other words Elisha you got to see Elijah
[1:13:43] that he's gone home onto his reward but
[1:13:45] there's still a work to
[1:13:47] do there's still a commission that's on
[1:13:51] the job is still incompleted Elisha
[1:13:54] you've got to Elijah is
[1:13:59] gone notice what he says here in the
[1:14:02] next verse verse 11 and it came to pass
[1:14:04] as they still went on and talked that
[1:14:06] behold there appeared a chariot of fire
[1:14:09] and Horses of fire and parted them both
[1:14:11] asunder and Elijah went up by a whirl
[1:14:13] went into heaven Elijah Elisha saw it
[1:14:16] said my father my father The Chariot of
[1:14:18] Israel and the horsemen thereof and he
[1:14:21] saw him no
[1:14:23] more and he took hold of his own clothes
[1:14:27] and ripped them into pieces and he took
[1:14:30] up also the mantle of Elijah that fell
[1:14:32] from him and went back and stood by the
[1:14:34] bank of the Jordan and he took the
[1:14:36] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[1:14:38] smokee the water and said not where is
[1:14:40] Elijah but where is the Lord
[1:14:44] God of
[1:14:46] Elijah Lord Jesus we're so thankful for
[1:14:49] your divine presence Lord Lord greater
[1:14:52] than the anything Lord Jesus more father
[1:14:56] important than how well I speak how Lord
[1:15:00] the thoughts that I have before me the
[1:15:02] notes I've laid before
[1:15:04] me but Lord the most important
[1:15:08] thing is that we touch
[1:15:11] Jesus I pray that you would just move by
[1:15:14] your Holy Spirit God lord I consider
[1:15:17] myself just the least of anyone to be
[1:15:19] able to speak Lord but I just pray that
[1:15:22] you'd come and speak a word may you take
[1:15:25] control of every Spirit here tonight God
[1:15:28] and may you send a refreshing from the
[1:15:30] presence of God grant it Lord Jesus we
[1:15:33] ask in your name we ask it and the
[1:15:36] church said it amen amen you can be
[1:15:38] seated
[1:15:42] tonight thank you
[1:15:48] brother Elijah is going home and this is
[1:15:52] some of the last words God's about to
[1:15:54] take him I fully believe with all my
[1:15:56] heart that Elijah knows what's about to
[1:15:59] take place Elijah is going home and the
[1:16:02] mantle is about to be passed the Baton
[1:16:05] is going to be transferred to the Next
[1:16:07] Generation and notice here that there
[1:16:09] was a great burden upon Elijah's heart
[1:16:12] you know the burden that comes upon
[1:16:14] every generation to the success or the
[1:16:17] pre preceding generation as they know
[1:16:20] that they have to transfer the right
[1:16:23] things to the Next Generation and so he
[1:16:25] has the burden of moving or transferring
[1:16:28] this burden to Elisha you're reading
[1:16:31] some of the last words some of the last
[1:16:33] things as Elijah's going home God has
[1:16:36] already told him that as Ministry and
[1:16:38] that that phase of that Ministry is
[1:16:40] coming to a to an end and he's going to
[1:16:42] go home by a whirlwind I fully believe
[1:16:44] that the prophet of God knew that the
[1:16:46] Lord was about to take him home that's
[1:16:48] my own opinion I believe that you could
[1:16:50] see that in some of the later messages
[1:16:52] that brother Bron preaches as that God
[1:16:55] even I believe it dawned on him what was
[1:16:57] about to take place as he says things
[1:16:59] and what house will you build me and you
[1:17:01] come to the last later messages that he
[1:17:03] preaches and he he says I'm so glad for
[1:17:06] men like your pastor your young Pastor
[1:17:08] here who will take these truths and and
[1:17:10] will sweep it on to the coming of the
[1:17:13] Lord he he listen friends let me just go
[1:17:16] ahead and say this now that it was never
[1:17:18] brother bram's desire to bottle up all
[1:17:20] of the gifts of God and all of the power
[1:17:23] of God in his own Ministry
[1:17:25] but in fact it was his desire to
[1:17:27] transfer and to move that same
[1:17:30] Supernatural expectation not just in one
[1:17:33] many but one member but throughout the
[1:17:35] entire body there would be
[1:17:38] gifts and Ministries that would
[1:17:42] operate and so he comes down to some of
[1:17:44] the last things these are some of the
[1:17:46] last things that he's going to say he
[1:17:49] knows the commission as some of the last
[1:17:51] words and he takes him very specifically
[1:17:54] to the these three cities and you're
[1:17:56] reading what you're reading when you're
[1:17:57] reading here in 2 Kings chapter 2 is
[1:18:00] some of the last things he would
[1:18:03] say these are some of the last moments
[1:18:07] before he goes home to his reward at
[1:18:10] some of the last burdens you know you
[1:18:11] can read the last words of powerful men
[1:18:16] you can go and read and get books about
[1:18:17] the last words of Abraham Lincoln and
[1:18:20] and different men that have lived
[1:18:21] through time you could read the last
[1:18:23] words actually in your Bible of David as
[1:18:26] David begins to bring Solomon into the
[1:18:28] room and and he begins to say some of
[1:18:30] his last intent and some of the burdens
[1:18:33] I I believe it's a very special moment
[1:18:36] it's a very critical moment as the
[1:18:38] prophet of God would call it a junction
[1:18:40] of time where that there was something
[1:18:42] that was ending but there was something
[1:18:44] about to begin you know often times
[1:18:47] things can't begin until things end in
[1:18:49] fact sometimes God is waiting to pour
[1:18:52] something out but until there's the end
[1:18:54] of something the beginning can't
[1:18:57] start and so now notice as Elisha this
[1:19:01] is that moment that critical moment and
[1:19:03] you're reading some of the last words
[1:19:05] you can go and read the last words of
[1:19:07] Jacob as he tells them don't leave my
[1:19:09] bones here and Joseph comes to his end
[1:19:12] of his life and he's repeating the same
[1:19:14] words that Jacob mentions and says don't
[1:19:16] leave my bones here and Egypt these were
[1:19:19] some of the last desires some of the
[1:19:22] last moments some of the things that
[1:19:24] were the most dear to his
[1:19:27] heart and I believe it's it's so
[1:19:29] powerful because Elijah felt the burden
[1:19:32] of this he feels the weight of this
[1:19:35] moment he knows he can't transfer the
[1:19:38] wrong things and he knows as in any race
[1:19:41] when the runner is finishing his course
[1:19:44] there's no danger of dropping The Paton
[1:19:46] while the runner is running but the
[1:19:49] danger comes at the
[1:19:53] transfer you see more can go wrong at
[1:19:56] that moment of that transfer of that
[1:19:59] baton it's not the danger when he's
[1:20:01] running but when the hand reaches out to
[1:20:04] take the Baton it's got to be a strong
[1:20:07] hand of Faith it's got to have a
[1:20:10] confidence not a it's got to have the
[1:20:13] right expectation it's got to have the
[1:20:15] same Faith the same trust the same ver
[1:20:18] ver fervor the same
[1:20:21] passion listen friends we're not going
[1:20:23] to pick up the race the prophet left
[1:20:25] going slower or or falling behind or or
[1:20:28] retreating and going the other way and
[1:20:30] we need to be more intense about the
[1:20:33] things of God more
[1:20:36] passionate this isn't a time to go
[1:20:38] backwards it's a time to go forward in
[1:20:41] [Applause]
[1:20:44] Jesus Elisha Elijah knows the moment the
[1:20:48] critical Junction of this next
[1:20:51] generation and Elisha prays and Elijah
[1:20:54] says ask ask me what do you want Elisha
[1:20:57] and he says that I would take a double
[1:20:59] portion of your spirit would come upon
[1:21:02] me now Elisha you know no doubt he's all
[1:21:06] struck you could imagine he's just all
[1:21:09] struck by the ministry of this man he
[1:21:11] knew there was something very special
[1:21:13] about this Elijah anointing in fact it
[1:21:16] was so special that Elisha wasn't going
[1:21:17] to leave
[1:21:19] him and there was the school of the
[1:21:21] prophets but notice where Elisha was
[1:21:23] standing
[1:21:25] listen friends there was a lot of other
[1:21:26] Ministries but there was only one Elijah
[1:21:28] to this
[1:21:29] generation let me just say it this way
[1:21:32] there's only one message there's only
[1:21:34] one message that will turn the hearts of
[1:21:37] the children back to the faith of the
[1:21:40] fathers thankful for Godly Ministry
[1:21:42] thankful for God gifts that God uh
[1:21:44] places into the body but there's one
[1:21:46] Elijah but let me say there's one people
[1:21:49] who can receive that Elijah message and
[1:21:52] I'm so glad that I'm one of them I'm so
[1:21:55] glad I'm
[1:21:57] identified by that Elijah
[1:22:00] anointing and so Elisha says there's
[1:22:02] something you could imagine he's
[1:22:03] enamored by this the ministry the
[1:22:06] Miracles the signs the Wonders the great
[1:22:09] gifts the great things that he did
[1:22:11] through that prophet and you can imagine
[1:22:13] the in insufficiency the inade
[1:22:15] inadequacy that Elisha could feel about
[1:22:18] the man to the Baton being passed to him
[1:22:20] let me just say something here Elisha
[1:22:22] was not going to be El like part two
[1:22:25] well Elijah was not just going to
[1:22:27] replace Elijah Elisha was not going to
[1:22:29] replace Elijah in the sense that he was
[1:22:32] just going to do the same things or the
[1:22:34] same Miracles or hold the same uh you
[1:22:36] know kind of things listen friends there
[1:22:38] was one Ministry that fa that came in
[1:22:40] this generation that was an Elijah and
[1:22:42] we're not to try to repeat or try to
[1:22:45] manufacture
[1:22:46] something you got to realize Elisha
[1:22:49] you've got challenges that you've got to
[1:22:52] face and let me say that the the
[1:22:54] challenge that Elisha faced was very
[1:22:56] different than
[1:22:58] Elijah's in fact these three cities that
[1:23:00] he takes him to bethl Jericho and Jordan
[1:23:03] at the time of Elijah's Ministry were
[1:23:05] but bursting with Revival Jericho we
[1:23:08] know the supernatural Miracles that took
[1:23:10] place in the city of Jericho with Rahab
[1:23:13] the Harlot and salmon and the journey of
[1:23:15] Joshua it was a great Revival it was a
[1:23:18] great a city of great Revival bethl was
[1:23:21] the place where Jacob lays down and he
[1:23:23] sees a vision of a of a ladder going
[1:23:25] from Heaven to Earth and and he wakes up
[1:23:27] from that dream and he says surely the
[1:23:29] Lord was in this place and I knew it not
[1:23:31] and he names the name of that stone
[1:23:34] bethl the house of God it was a was a
[1:23:37] place Jordan where Joshua crosses
[1:23:39] Jericho AC crosses the Jordan and takes
[1:23:42] those memorial stones and and
[1:23:44] memorializes what God didn't notice I
[1:23:46] want you to notice that these cities
[1:23:48] that Elijah took Elisha to were not just
[1:23:53] random but but they were all
[1:23:55] Supernatural
[1:23:57] cities notice he's wanting to pass down
[1:23:59] the right thing he's wanting to pass
[1:24:02] down the right expectation he's wanting
[1:24:04] to make sure that Elisha I trusted in
[1:24:08] Jehovah and you can
[1:24:10] too he never failed me and he'll never
[1:24:12] fail you
[1:24:14] Elijah oh he's always faithful Elijah
[1:24:17] could say to Elisha the same God that
[1:24:20] that moved in my uh in my Ministry is
[1:24:22] going to move in your ministry Elish
[1:24:26] bethl Jordan and Jericho cities of
[1:24:28] Revival but oh how different are those
[1:24:32] cities from the beginning of Elijah's
[1:24:35] Ministry to the end of his
[1:24:38] ministry now those same cities that were
[1:24:41] in Revival now at the end of his
[1:24:44] ministry now there's young people who
[1:24:47] are mocking the prophet
[1:24:54] very different it was in brother
[1:24:55] brenham's Ministry from the beginning of
[1:24:57] his ministry till when he came to his
[1:25:00] I'll say it this way his real
[1:25:03] Ministry and at first everybody wants
[1:25:05] him at his church at first everybody's
[1:25:07] inviting him come preach our meetings
[1:25:09] come over and preach in my tent I'll
[1:25:11] hold a Revival and everybody all the
[1:25:12] doors are open and everybody listen
[1:25:14] friends Miracles will attract anybody
[1:25:17] that's right Miracles will attract
[1:25:19] anybody it'll attract uh uh Christians
[1:25:22] it'll attract non-christians it'll trct
[1:25:24] Hollywood everybody loves a
[1:25:27] miracle but the word brings the
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:35] difference and notice here these were
[1:25:37] great miraculous cities but now when he
[1:25:39] comes to his true Ministry now he comes
[1:25:42] to Tucson and he says I I never wanted
[1:25:44] to start a church here I I sat here for
[1:25:47] three years and you never invited me to
[1:25:49] your church I sat in the de I never
[1:25:52] wanted to have a church here I just
[1:25:53] wanted you know be part of your your
[1:25:55] your your meetings and brother Brandon
[1:25:57] was always about that but that the doors
[1:25:59] had closed you never invited me you you
[1:26:01] never you never you never brought I made
[1:26:03] an invitation what was it now at the end
[1:26:06] of his ministry when he comes into his
[1:26:08] true Ministry now the doors are closing
[1:26:11] nobody
[1:26:12] wanting didn't it happen the same way in
[1:26:14] the ministry of
[1:26:17] Jesus happened in the same Ministry of
[1:26:19] Jesus and he says that you know that
[1:26:21] unless you eat the Flesh and the son of
[1:26:23] man drink his blood you no part with him
[1:26:25] and even the disciples said this the the
[1:26:28] the the the the the multitude said this
[1:26:30] is a hard saying who can bear it listen
[1:26:33] friends let me just say this with you
[1:26:35] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:37] this message is a hard
[1:26:39] message without the true nature change
[1:26:42] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:26:44] message is just dos and don'ts and what
[1:26:46] you can do what you can wear what you
[1:26:48] can't wear where you can go where you
[1:26:50] cannot go it's a hard thing oh but when
[1:26:53] you have the spirit of the message in
[1:26:55] your heart it's the passion of your life
[1:26:59] it's victory it's not defeat it's
[1:27:02] Freedom it's not
[1:27:05] changed
[1:27:08] Hallelujah and he says this is a hearted
[1:27:11] who can bear it disciples my Jesus looks
[1:27:14] at the disciples after that they had
[1:27:15] left and says what where you what are
[1:27:17] you doing here will you go
[1:27:21] also no Lord for you alone have the
[1:27:25] words of eternal life let me say it this
[1:27:28] way you alone have the words that make
[1:27:30] my life make
[1:27:33] sense you alone have the word that makes
[1:27:36] this entire world make sense and I've
[1:27:38] searched for it out there and I'm not
[1:27:40] found it you're the only one that makes
[1:27:42] my life worth living Lord this message
[1:27:45] is the only thing that makes the world
[1:27:47] make sense it makes economies make sense

[1:28:13] you know this is where you could just
[1:28:14] stay right here he was testing
[1:28:17] him and Elisha says as my as the Lord
[1:28:20] liveth and as my soul liveth I will not
[1:28:24] believe you Elijah there may be a lot of
[1:28:26] people getting up and walking out there
[1:28:28] may be a lot of people walking away
[1:28:31] there may be a lot of people that might
[1:28:32] find something out there but I want you
[1:28:34] to know I'm staying right beside the
[1:28:37] Elijah Ministry listen friends this
[1:28:40] ain't a time to walk away it's a time to
[1:28:43] preach it like never
[1:28:45] before the rest of the world might go
[1:28:48] but I say to whom would I go Lord for
[1:28:51] you alone have the words of eternal
[1:28:55] life there may be a lot of people
[1:28:57] walking away but I'm not going to walk
[1:28:59] away there may be a lot of people
[1:29:01] ashamed of it but I'm not ashamed of it
[1:29:03] as Paul said I am not ashamed of the
[1:29:06] Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the
[1:29:08] power of
[1:29:11] Salvation listen friends let me just
[1:29:13] preach to you for a can I preach here
[1:29:14] for a moment this ain't the time to try
[1:29:17] to padic cake around people's feelings
[1:29:19] and try to modernize the message of the
[1:29:22] hour this ain't a Time time to try to
[1:29:25] doctor it up and paint it up and make it
[1:29:27] more palpable and make it more
[1:29:29] acceptable
[1:29:32] socially I say preach the word of God
[1:29:36] declare the word of God say it like a
[1:29:39] prophet said it and I believe there's a
[1:29:41] generation who says give me the message
[1:29:44] give me the word of God just the way the
[1:29:47] prophet said it you don't need to doctor
[1:29:49] it you don't need to dress it
[1:29:51] up Hallelujah
[1:30:05] Glory these cities were on fire now from
[1:30:08] the beginning now to the
[1:30:11] end down to the end of his ministry and
[1:30:14] doors are closing now Elisha knew
[1:30:17] there's something very special there's
[1:30:19] something very unique about this
[1:30:21] ministry it's like nothing else I have
[1:30:23] ever ever seen it's a ministry that's
[1:30:27] unparalleled it's a Ministry that has no
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:34] match you know I think it's so
[1:30:36] incredible to me how people want to come
[1:30:39] 30 40 years
[1:30:40] later and start questioning the ministry
[1:30:43] of God's Prophet people want to come
[1:30:45] years later after he's gone and begin to
[1:30:48] bring up questions well I have this
[1:30:50] doubt over here and I have this question
[1:30:51] over here about this and and you know
[1:30:53] want to say this about this you know
[1:30:55] it's so amazing because let me tell you
[1:30:57] let me just read you Lord I'm going to
[1:30:58] do it let me read you some of what some
[1:31:00] of the witnesses of that Ministry said
[1:31:02] Gordon Lindsay said never had we known
[1:31:05] any preacher calling deaf mutes and
[1:31:07] blind people to pray for and then to see
[1:31:10] those people delivered on the spot a
[1:31:13] Ministry that was beyond any that we had
[1:31:16] ever before
[1:31:18] witness James Morris said it was brandom
[1:31:21] more than any other evangelist who
[1:31:22] started the postor War 2 fundamentalist
[1:31:24] hilling Revival falling the counter with
[1:31:26] an angel on May 7th 1946 word radiated
[1:31:31] in every direction that all manner of
[1:31:33] disease and afflictions were healed
[1:31:35] instantly by the little Indiana preacher
[1:31:38] even cases of raising the dead were
[1:31:43] published TL osbor says God has chosen
[1:31:46] diverse and mysterious ways to reveal
[1:31:48] himself to his servants especially those
[1:31:50] called for dispensational purposes and
[1:31:54] was branham's call in short the man we
[1:31:57] know is William brandham was sent to
[1:32:00] demonstrate God in flesh
[1:32:05] again FF Bosworth said when the gift is
[1:32:08] operating brother bam is the most
[1:32:09] sensitive person to the presence and
[1:32:11] working of the Holy Ghost into spiritual
[1:32:13] realities of any person I have ever
[1:32:15] known Morris cell says God called this
[1:32:17] humble man and anointed his ministry
[1:32:20] with a degree that within a few short
[1:32:22] years his name was known in the most
[1:32:24] remote jungle out station wherever you
[1:32:27] would go in the world you would find the
[1:32:30] name of this messenger has preceded your
[1:32:34] arrival The Voice Gospel of the voice of
[1:32:37] healing gospel magazine says in Bible
[1:32:39] days there were men of God who were
[1:32:41] prophets and seers but in all those
[1:32:43] sacred records none of these had a
[1:32:46] greater Ministry than that of William
[1:32:47] brandom a prophet and seer of God whose
[1:32:49] photograph appears on the front cover of
[1:32:52] the issue of this issue of full go El
[1:32:54] men's uh Full Gospel men's voice brandom
[1:32:56] listen to this has been used by God In
[1:32:59] The Name of Jesus to raise the
[1:33:05] dead but it's funny how people want to
[1:33:07] come later you know it sort of be like
[1:33:09] me saying about Mike Tyson you know
[1:33:11] brother Donnie brother Mike you know
[1:33:13] Mike Mike Tyson was
[1:33:16] nothing I could have took
[1:33:19] Mike I mean I know you got you know I I
[1:33:22] know y'all talk about how great he was
[1:33:24] and you know the take TKO and the punch
[1:33:27] that he that he that he had and how you
[1:33:29] know how fast his jab was but you know
[1:33:31] what I I'll be honest here I don't know
[1:33:33] that I believe all the hype and the
[1:33:34] hoopla over that all those you know
[1:33:36] everybody you know I think I could have
[1:33:37] took you know you know what the problem
[1:33:39] is is that we have I won't call them uh
[1:33:42] opponents I'll call them
[1:33:44] victims we have the victims of Mike
[1:33:47] Tyson and I guarantee you put one of
[1:33:50] those victims up here behind this pull
[1:33:52] pit and they would shut up the mouth of
[1:33:54] any dummy that wanted to say Mike
[1:33:56] Tyson's punch was it all that well I got
[1:33:58] news for the devil why don't you put all
[1:34:00] these people who want to question the
[1:34:01] ministry of William Bram I promise you
[1:34:03] put the victim of cancer and give him a
[1:34:06] mic put the put the demon of blindness
[1:34:08] and deafness and give him a mic and I'll
[1:34:11] tell you what he testify of the same God
[1:34:15] and Jesus that with me is the same God
[1:34:18] in the ministry of that
[1:34:20] Prophet
[1:34:22] Hallelujah and I'm here to say he's the
[1:34:25] same God tonight he's that the same
[1:34:27] power
[1:34:30] tonight
[1:34:33] Hallelujah
[1:34:39] Glory notice this was the ministry he
[1:34:41] knew there was nothing else quite like
[1:34:45] it yes
[1:34:46] sir and so Elisha you can imagine is
[1:34:50] enamored by the ministry of this man
[1:34:54] he comes back to these last moments and
[1:34:57] he's reading some of the last words and
[1:35:00] he knows the anointing of the
[1:35:02] supernatural must be passed down he
[1:35:06] can't pass down the wrong things he
[1:35:08] can't pass down the wrong type of Faith
[1:35:11] the wrong expectation but it's got to be
[1:35:14] the right
[1:35:15] expectation the right burden the right
[1:35:19] things he feels the weight of this
[1:35:21] moment and he knows he's got a said his
[1:35:24] hope listen friends it was the very same
[1:35:26] thing the Apostle Paul said when he
[1:35:28] talked to the Galatians and he says oh
[1:35:30] fullest Galatians who hath Bewitched you
[1:35:34] having begun notice having begun in the
[1:35:40] spirit in other words how did this
[1:35:42] revival start with the
[1:35:45] supernatural how did this revival start
[1:35:47] with the spirit of God listen friends
[1:35:50] you take the spirit of God out of this
[1:35:52] message
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:57] if we if we just deduce this thing to
[1:35:59] good Theology and good doctrines and
[1:36:01] good stories I'm thankful for all of
[1:36:03] that I tell you what a prophet said he
[1:36:06] said you take God out of Israel and they
[1:36:08] were like any other Nation you take
[1:36:10] Samson's anointing out of his life and
[1:36:12] cut his hair he was just any other boy
[1:36:15] and he said in the church when you take
[1:36:17] the leading of the Holy Ghost the church
[1:36:19] is just the the the world with the name
[1:36:21] of God attached to it
[1:36:24] but it's the spirit that makes the
[1:36:27] difference I say more than ever before
[1:36:29] we need the spirit to make the
[1:36:34] difference having begun in the spirit
[1:36:37] are you now Glory are are you now
[1:36:40] perfected by the
[1:36:42] Flesh in other words do you think that
[1:36:45] this changing of your body is going to
[1:36:48] be by some kind of effort on your part
[1:36:54] you think that after begun in the
[1:36:56] Supernatural how did Brother Bam's
[1:36:58] Ministry begin think about it friends it
[1:37:02] began with an angel sir breaching the
[1:37:06] gap between the dimension of the the
[1:37:08] supernatural into the
[1:37:10] natural and I say to you if it began in
[1:37:14] the Supernatural it will finish in the
[1:37:21] Supernatural Elisha you got to trust the
[1:37:24] same God you got to trust the same God
[1:37:28] that was with me and Elijah you got to
[1:37:31] have your
[1:37:32] miracles on now you can't depend upon
[1:37:35] Elijah you've got your
[1:37:38] Goliath that you've got to slay
[1:37:42] now all right somebody with
[1:37:45] me he cannot live under the same
[1:37:49] stories he cannot live under the past
[1:37:53] reputation or the memories you know how
[1:37:56] easy it would have been for Elisha just
[1:37:58] to say stay here Elijah don't
[1:38:01] leave okay friends I'll be honest and
[1:38:03] tell you right now if I was there I
[1:38:05] would I would be begging God to Lord
[1:38:07] don't take brother brandham don't take
[1:38:09] him Lord we need him hear
[1:38:14] God it had been easy for Elisha to look
[1:38:17] at Elijah that way but Elijah had to
[1:38:19] Elisha had to recognize he's got his own
[1:38:22] battles he's got to face he's got his
[1:38:24] own challenges and they're actually much
[1:38:29] worse you say brother Matt Elisha is
[1:38:33] going to need to have the same Faith as
[1:38:36] Elijah no he's going to need
[1:38:42] double I said he's going to need that
[1:38:44] double
[1:38:45] portion tell you what a prophet of God
[1:38:47] said he T that taught that double
[1:38:49] portion was the was the former and the
[1:38:51] latter rign and let me tell you what
[1:38:53] Pentecost ofus in 1906 was not it was
[1:38:56] not the return of Pentecost can I preach
[1:38:58] to you here for a moment brother bham
[1:39:00] said it in the church age book he said
[1:39:01] at the turn of the 20th century men
[1:39:03] began to cry out for the spirit of God
[1:39:04] to move and God poured out his Spirit
[1:39:06] now that was a part of the restoration
[1:39:08] but I tell you what a prophet said that
[1:39:10] was not the return of
[1:39:13] Pentecost because the former Reign had
[1:39:16] not even came
[1:39:18] yet what was that former rain brother
[1:39:20] Matt the message of the hour it was the
[1:39:23] teach Mora you get what brother rham
[1:39:24] says it was Mora the teaching rain the
[1:39:26] former rain The Barley harvest the
[1:39:29] spring
[1:39:31] Harvest you ever notice who caught that
[1:39:33] and brother Ram types that in the Feast
[1:39:34] of the trumpets the Feast of Passover
[1:39:36] the Feast of of of 11 bread the feast
[1:39:39] the first fruits was fulfilled in the
[1:39:41] ministry of Jesus do you realize that as
[1:39:44] the Jews were going into the temple to
[1:39:47] sacrifice the
[1:39:49] Passover the Lamb of God was hanging on
[1:39:52] a cross
[1:39:55] wow and then the week they they go and
[1:39:57] offer the F the unleavened bread and as
[1:40:00] they're offering the unleavened bread
[1:40:03] Jesus is in the
[1:40:06] Tomb oh
[1:40:08] Hallelujah and then there's Jews come
[1:40:10] and they offer the the fruit of the
[1:40:12] first fruits and as they're offering in
[1:40:15] their rituals by their
[1:40:17] Traditions by the
[1:40:19] denominations they didn't
[1:40:22] recognize that at the moment they were
[1:40:24] trying to make a sacrifice the Lamb of
[1:40:27] God was coming up on Easter
[1:40:30] morning
[1:40:34] amen and they kept on going to church as
[1:40:36] brother bham said they would they'll
[1:40:37] keep going to church she'll singing
[1:40:38] songs not realizing the coming of the
[1:40:40] Lord has already taken place the prophet
[1:40:43] of God said in the ministry of Jesus he
[1:40:45] fulfilled all three of those feasts but
[1:40:47] then you have the feast seven weeks
[1:40:48] later seven weeks seven sabbaths plus
[1:40:50] one day there was coming a sound of a
[1:40:52] rushing might wind in the upper room
[1:40:55] when all of God's family was gathered
[1:40:57] there you know what brother brandham
[1:40:58] said brother Bram says they were all in
[1:40:59] one place and one mind and one Accord
[1:41:02] and they started praising the Lord for
[1:41:05] something that had not even been sent
[1:41:10] yet oh did you hear me church I said
[1:41:13] they were praising God for something you
[1:41:16] mean you can start praising God before
[1:41:19] your Miracle shows
[1:41:21] up you can start worshiping God before
[1:41:24] he ever shows up in your life and
[1:41:27] brother bam says when they started doing
[1:41:29] that the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind
[1:41:32] filled the
[1:41:34] house the prophet of God says that that
[1:41:37] Pentecostal week goes all the way to the
[1:41:40] Rapture through seven weeks seven Church
[1:41:43] ages but then in that Feast of trumpets
[1:41:45] it was not the barley Harvest it was the
[1:41:47] wheat
[1:41:48] Harvest Hallelujah I don't know where
[1:41:51] I'm at but I'm somewhere
[1:41:54] and brother R says what notice what the
[1:41:56] Bible says it says that was the that was
[1:41:58] the latter rain it was the Harvest it
[1:42:00] was the fall
[1:42:02] Feast you say then brother Matt if ausa
[1:42:06] was not
[1:42:08] Pentecost then what do we
[1:42:12] have did you hear me friends I said if
[1:42:15] that wasn't Pentecost then I say this
[1:42:18] must
[1:42:21] be oh Hallelujah you're not going to get
[1:42:24] away from it you're not going to get
[1:42:26] away from
[1:42:27] Pentecost the brother ROM says that it
[1:42:29] was the pattern it is the standard there
[1:42:32] is no other standard there is only one
[1:42:34] true church and that true church is
[1:42:37] identified not with 1906 but with ad33
[1:42:41] when God poured out his Spirit upon All
[1:42:45] Flesh
[1:42:50] Hallelujah but Hosea I think it's
[1:42:52] chapter 6 I'll be the as to you as the
[1:42:54] rain the former and the latter rain now
[1:42:58] notice this here as we go this a little
[1:43:00] bit further he notice notice he says
[1:43:03] you've got to have twice the seal twice
[1:43:05] the passion twice twice it
[1:43:10] Elijah brother Brandon's standing there
[1:43:13] and he wakes up from a
[1:43:14] dream and he says he sees the Jordan
[1:43:17] River and the voice says you're 2third
[1:43:20] of the way there representing that
[1:43:21] second pool and brother bham crosses
[1:43:25] going to cross the Jordan River he wakes
[1:43:26] goes to wakes up goes back out and then
[1:43:29] he sees that vision of that great mamba
[1:43:31] snake trying to attack that brother and
[1:43:34] brother's moving back and forth and and
[1:43:36] brother bham says a voice says you have
[1:43:38] power to bind
[1:43:40] him and power to loose
[1:43:44] him and then you notice I'm not
[1:43:46] preaching on that here tonight but the
[1:43:47] voice as brother Bram begins to describe
[1:43:50] it there The Voice speaks and brother
[1:43:52] bham says Lord I want to bind him in
[1:43:54] Jesus name and and and the voice spoke
[1:43:56] to brother bandam says You must be more
[1:44:02] sincere you must be
[1:44:05] more sincere you say brother Matt are we
[1:44:09] going to need twice the Zeal twice the
[1:44:11] passion twice listen friends God has no
[1:44:15] gear of
[1:44:17] reverse God is not going
[1:44:20] backwards he has one gear and it's not
[1:44:22] staying still either it's Onward
[1:44:25] Christian
[1:44:26] Soldiers listen friends this isn't the
[1:44:28] time to go backwards it's not the time
[1:44:31] for Less can I say it this way it's the
[1:44:33] time for more of the spirit of God more
[1:44:36] of Revival more of the love of God in
[1:44:39] our in our
[1:44:41] family it's not time for less it's a
[1:44:44] time for
[1:44:47] more and notice here is Elijah's
[1:44:50] ministry as I fully believe with all my
[1:44:52] heart what you witnessed in God's
[1:44:54] Prophet was great miraculous I preached
[1:44:57] on it Great Signs great wonders great
[1:45:01] Miracles but I I love the
[1:45:04] Miracles I love the Miracles but let me
[1:45:07] just say something to you here tonight I
[1:45:09] believe that there's more than just
[1:45:13] Miracles I believe that there's more
[1:45:15] than just the I'm thankful for the
[1:45:17] miraculous and I believe we need more of
[1:45:18] it come on somebody and I believe God
[1:45:21] wants to do more of it
[1:45:26] but there was more to that son of man
[1:45:28] Ministry than just the Messiah sign to
[1:45:31] discern
[1:45:32] Hearts friends I'll just tell you and
[1:45:34] and you can you can take it or leave it
[1:45:36] but I'll tell you what I believe I
[1:45:38] believe in God's Prophet we witnessed
[1:45:41] the very
[1:45:43] nature of the
[1:45:46] lamb as the token life was to be the
[1:45:49] literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:45:53] Prophet says in one place the very human
[1:45:56] life of Jesus is to come back on the
[1:46:05] worshiper and friends can I just say I'm
[1:46:07] thankful for miracles but if I never see
[1:46:09] another one in my life but the nature of
[1:46:12] my lamb comes back upon my
[1:46:15] life that'll be the greatest Miracle God
[1:46:18] could ever do in my life is to give me
[1:46:21] the love of Jesus give me the kindness
[1:46:23] of Jesus give me the grace of Jesus Oh
[1:46:27] does somebody feel that way here tonight
[1:46:29] let the nature of the Lamb come back on
[1:46:33] the
[1:46:35] worshiper everybody loves his miracles I
[1:46:37] do too that loves The Sensational and
[1:46:39] brother Bram fought against it as I know
[1:46:40] I've preached this here before fought
[1:46:41] against it his entire Ministry you'll
[1:46:43] find it him fighting in one ditch of
[1:46:45] Armenian ISM and and then one ditches
[1:46:47] over here in Calvinism you know brother
[1:46:49] Ram said he said I'm a calvinist as long
[1:46:51] as Calvin's in the Bible
[1:46:54] I'm an armenius as long as it's in the
[1:46:56] Bible brother ROM says but there's
[1:46:58] always two ditches there's always one
[1:47:01] side or the other side isn't that
[1:47:03] amazing how people are there's always us
[1:47:06] or them or
[1:47:10] they I'd hide behind this pull pit but
[1:47:12] there ain't nowhere to hide you can see
[1:47:14] right through
[1:47:16] it and brother BR dealt with this listen
[1:47:19] brother bam can I just preach here for a
[1:47:20] moment prophet of God dealt with this
[1:47:22] entire Ministry two sides there's always
[1:47:24] a ditch on the left and there's always a
[1:47:26] ditch on the right and he says one side
[1:47:28] you got the fundamentalist Baptist who's
[1:47:30] cold and starchy and debt let me tell
[1:47:32] you how he said in one place he said
[1:47:33] one's got money in the bank but ain't
[1:47:35] got the ain't got the faith to sign his
[1:47:37] name to it the other one has all the
[1:47:39] faith in the world but he ain't got no
[1:47:40] money in the
[1:47:42] bank if you could ever get the two
[1:47:45] groups
[1:47:47] together I'm just preaching to what a
[1:47:49] prophet said
[1:47:53] and he says notice but the true bride
[1:47:56] goes down the middle of the
[1:47:59] rad drawing from both
[1:48:05] ditches
[1:48:08] hello
[1:48:11] hello I notice it's all amazing to me
[1:48:14] because it's the nature of people
[1:48:16] everybody loves to emphasize one thing
[1:48:18] to deemphasize another
[1:48:21] thing everybody loves to make something
[1:48:24] pop something up great over here only to
[1:48:26] lessen you know the fruits of the spirit
[1:48:28] were just denominational and oh really
[1:48:30] I'll tell you what a prophet said you
[1:48:32] might speak in tongues you might
[1:48:35] not but here's one thing you will have
[1:48:37] you will have the fruit evident fruits
[1:48:39] of the spirit in your
[1:48:42] life says the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:44] no brother and thought it was thought it
[1:48:45] was love the angel told him it wasn't
[1:48:47] neither is it speaking in tongues you
[1:48:49] said brother M do you believe in
[1:48:50] speaking in Tong absolutely
[1:48:53] I believe anybody who doesn't has never
[1:48:54] spoken tongues anybody who doesn't love
[1:48:57] the sensation and the feeling listen
[1:48:59] friends I love to F the Holy
[1:49:02] Ghost anybody who don't is just cuz you
[1:49:04] ain't never felt him before cuz if you

[1:49:17] thing out to to raise something else up
[1:49:20] it's always been that way it's always
[1:49:21] amazing I've always always found in
[1:49:23] people that with the message of the hour
[1:49:25] you'll find people will either deify the
[1:49:28] prophet or they'll deemphasize the
[1:49:33] prophet and say you know that's just his
[1:49:35] opinion brother Amos you know just what
[1:49:37] a just what brother bam says you know
[1:49:39] just you know I think brother B wasn't
[1:49:40] thus say the Lord of here and they
[1:49:41] always try to split this up and split
[1:49:43] the listen friends you can't take the
[1:49:44] messenger away from his
[1:49:47] message but they want to cut one thing
[1:49:50] out to cut it to to to to raise
[1:49:51] something I've some cut out emotion and
[1:49:53] say it's the word and the word only we
[1:49:55] don't need any of the gifts of the
[1:49:56] Spirit in operation
[1:49:59] anymore then others say we don't need
[1:50:01] teachers we don't need to teach the word
[1:50:03] of God it's not important well really

[1:50:57] Bible others say I don't need my
[1:51:00] Bible amazing isn't it amazing don't you
[1:51:03] realize it is the tactic of the devil to
[1:51:07] kick us into ditches so that he can draw
[1:51:10] circles and create groups here and
[1:51:12] groups there groups here and groups
[1:51:14] there and listen friends I I remind you
[1:51:17] the prophet of God never drew a circle
[1:51:19] he only drew the circle bigger
[1:51:25] see brother the matter you preaching
[1:51:26] tolerance and and you know just just
[1:51:28] compromise that ain't what I'm preaching

[1:52:10] fruits give me the
[1:52:14] nature oh do you want to hear tonight
[1:52:17] church say I want all that God
[1:52:23] that's
[1:52:29] given can we go a little
[1:52:32] further notice this as he comes back to
[1:52:36] the
[1:52:37] expectation and he says I want you to
[1:52:40] make sure that you understand Elisha
[1:52:44] knew the mantle is nice but it wasn't
[1:52:47] the
[1:52:48] stitching it wasn't the Garment it
[1:52:50] wasn't what it was made of it wasn't the
[1:52:53] material though the material was very
[1:52:55] nice but what was special about the
[1:53:00] mantle was the
[1:53:02] promis that the mantle
[1:53:06] carried it was
[1:53:08] saturated with the
[1:53:10] anointing the purpose you see that's
[1:53:13] what an anointing is you ever look up
[1:53:15] that word it's cha which means to be
[1:53:18] Oily to smear with oil it's what they
[1:53:21] would do with the prophet at he was
[1:53:22] going to be king over Nations they would
[1:53:24] take that oil and they would break it
[1:53:26] over that man and pour it down his head
[1:53:28] as David says that's how well it is to
[1:53:30] dwell with brethren in in in in in in
[1:53:33] love it's like the the oil that ran from
[1:53:35] Aaron's beard it's that oil but what is
[1:53:38] that oil the purpose of the oil is not
[1:53:41] so you can get
[1:53:45] oily people love to get
[1:53:47] oily but the oil is only representing a
[1:53:53] purpose and God used that oil to
[1:53:56] symbolize the trout you realize when we
[1:53:58] pray for the sick we are taking the
[1:54:00] words of Jesus and that anointing oil we
[1:54:03] put upon you is so that the promises of
[1:54:06] Jesus can come off of this Bible and go
[1:54:10] into your body and heal you of all
[1:54:12] manner of diseases it is the
[1:54:15] transfer of that
[1:54:18] promise and so he would anoint a man he'
[1:54:21] take a man like jerem IA and he
[1:54:23] literally baptize him with his burden
[1:54:25] and God would have something to say to
[1:54:27] his people and so God would take a
[1:54:29] mouthpiece and he would begin to put his
[1:54:31] thoughts and his words notice friends
[1:54:34] the words of Jeremiah were not
[1:54:35] Jeremiah's
[1:54:38] words the words of Ezekiel it wasn't
[1:54:41] ezekiel's message it was only a message
[1:54:44] from the throne Ezekiel was just the
[1:54:46] Mailman for the
[1:54:48] message that's why the prophet of God
[1:54:50] said it wasn't me who appeared there on
[1:54:52] the Ohio River I was only standing
[1:54:56] nearby when he
[1:54:58] appeared you say brother M what does
[1:55:00] that mean that means you could mock
[1:55:02] Jeremiah you could laugh at Jeremiah you
[1:55:04] could ridicule him question his
[1:55:07] credibility but you weren't mocking
[1:55:10] Jeremiah you were mocking
[1:55:15] Jehovah hello
[1:55:18] somebody brother bam says oh you say I
[1:55:20] would have defended Jesus in those days
[1:55:22] oh if I would have just been there you
[1:55:24] know I would have stood for him I
[1:55:25] wouldn't allowed those Roman soldiers
[1:55:27] I'll tell you what a prophet said a
[1:55:28] prophet said what you do with the
[1:55:31] message for your
[1:55:33] day proves what you would have did back
[1:55:36] there in the days of
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:39] Jesus and when you walk away from this
[1:55:42] message you're not leaving the message
[1:55:44] of a Kentucky hillbilly you are
[1:55:46] rejecting the message from the throne
[1:55:53] but when you're accepting the message
[1:55:54] brother Donnie you're not AC accepting
[1:55:56] the message of a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:55:58] you're accepting the message from the
[1:56:02] [Applause]
[1:56:04] throne oh I'm so glad I could receive
[1:56:08] the word how many's glad with me I can
[1:56:11] receive the word from my
[1:56:17] generation it wasn't his
[1:56:20] message it wasn't his prise thas the
[1:56:23] mantle was not about Elijah it was the
[1:56:26] purpose that God was transferring off of
[1:56:30] the mantle into the life of Elisha it
[1:56:35] was the promises it was the
[1:56:38] faith these are some of the last things
[1:56:41] I've been scouring the
[1:56:43] message just
[1:56:45] scouring thinking what was upon brother
[1:56:49] brenham's
[1:56:50] heart before he left the the scene what
[1:56:52] was what was upon his heart what was so
[1:56:56] close to him as he's going to go off the
[1:56:59] scene what is some of the last words if
[1:57:02] I could just put myself there what is
[1:57:05] the what is the climate there what is
[1:57:06] the feeling what is what is he wanting
[1:57:09] to pass down what is he wanting to
[1:57:12] transfer I come to what house will you
[1:57:14] build me in 1965 in November just a

[2:00:09] manifest itself I say angels I say

[2:00:19] got a church that says open heaven open

[2:04:23] first but I'm not as young as I used to
[2:04:25] be and the older you get the older that
[2:04:29] you get the more that you realize how
[2:04:32] true how much you need this promise
[2:04:34] right
[2:04:35] here the older you get you realize this
[2:04:38] world is just a world of
[2:04:41] suffering I'm talking about the world
[2:04:43] I'm not talking about his promise listen
[2:04:46] his promises far his his his blessings
[2:04:48] far outweigh his
[2:04:50] crosses David said forget not his
[2:04:53] benefits but listen friends as he says
[2:04:56] can give it some Supernatural faith when
[2:04:59] we see a God that can raise the dead off
[2:05:03] the floor or out in the yard and bring
[2:05:06] him back to life again and present him
[2:05:09] before us when we see a God who could
[2:05:12] take a cancer that's ate a man to a
[2:05:14] shadow and raise him up to a strong
[2:05:16] healthy man that that that what's that
[2:05:23] something that that man could not
[2:05:30] do hopeless he says that ought to give
[2:05:35] rapturing Faith to the
[2:05:39] people you know that just happened here
[2:05:41] just a year ago year and a half ago or
[2:05:42] so back in our hometown and my brother
[2:05:46] Travis one of my closest friends he he
[2:05:49] he he he was searching even from the
[2:05:51] days he was a boy from just a little boy
[2:05:54] he was searching for the Lord went into
[2:05:56] his mom and dad raised in the buur
[2:05:57] Baptist Church had left the church
[2:05:59] became disillusioned by it his dad was a
[2:06:02] deacon there the deacons would go out
[2:06:03] and take a smoke
[2:06:05] break and his dad left the church but
[2:06:08] there was something in Travis's heart
[2:06:10] things Supernatural things that he was
[2:06:13] you know just an expectation
[2:06:14] Supernatural things that have taken
[2:06:15] place in his life as a young boy and he
[2:06:17] starts looking for the truth he's going
[2:06:19] through and he's reading the Bible his
[2:06:20] mom didn't even know he's reading it
[2:06:22] gets into his mom's closet and finds a
[2:06:24] book The Spine is ripped off the book
[2:06:27] doesn't know to this day how that book
[2:06:29] got
[2:06:30] there and he opens the book The Acts of
[2:06:34] the Prophet written by Perry
[2:06:38] green I think I know how that book got
[2:06:43] there acts of the Prophet starts reading
[2:06:46] that book starts consuming that book

[2:07:11] be and and and he and he says brother he
[2:07:15] tell the youth leader where's where's
[2:07:16] the god that we read about here Hebrews
[2:07:19] 13:8 says Jesus is the same yes
[2:07:21] yesterday today and forever he's the
[2:07:23] same God why don't we see this that
[2:07:25] Pastor youth leader would say well
[2:07:27] Travis you have to understand that those
[2:07:29] were special miracles for the aposto
[2:07:31] they're for the apostles but the
[2:07:32] apostolic age is over Miracles are are

[2:14:00] shell of a man that I had seen is is
[2:14:02] crippled up there on the couch he's got
[2:14:04] a man and woman there from his church
[2:14:06] and they're there you know it's I just
[2:14:09] there was just just death you could just
[2:14:11] feel it in the room that he had he had
[2:14:14] resigned to this and he and he you know
[2:14:16] he just you could just feel it right
[2:14:18] when I walked in the room and and he's
[2:14:20] sitting there and I could see the tumor
[2:14:22] just about big as a grapefruit just off
[2:14:25] of his
[2:14:26] neck and I and I'll never forget this so
[2:14:29] vivid in my mind and I remember as as as

[2:14:34] and he says well you know this is this
[2:14:36] is you know this is the end of my road
[2:14:38] and didn't want to go this way Travis
[2:14:40] and what did the doctor saying the
[2:14:41] doctor saying it's hopeless and there's
[2:14:42] nothing that could be done and it's you
[2:14:44] know stage four that tried chemo eight
[2:14:47] times it failed all eight times go home
[2:14:49] and he says you know this is this is
[2:14:51] this is it and this is you know just
[2:14:52] resign you know sometimes it's very easy
[2:14:54] to have faith for other people and
[2:14:56] sometimes it's very hard to have faith
[2:14:59] for
[2:15:01] yourself and he had just lost all hope
[2:15:04] and I sat there and I I never forget as
[2:15:06] Travis begin to say well Marcus he says
[2:15:09] I just got to tell you you know Travis
[2:15:11] is real bold he's a sweetheart but he's
[2:15:13] got a real tender heart but he's he's
[2:15:15] real bold when it's when it comes to the
[2:15:17] word and he says he says Marcus he says
[2:15:19] I got to tell you he says you know when
[2:15:21] I came to your church he says I was
[2:15:22] looking for the Living God the god I
[2:15:25] read about in the book of Acts
[2:15:26] Supernatural God he says when I came to
[2:15:28] your church he says I was looking for
[2:15:30] him and he says Marcus I want to tell
[2:15:32] you I found that God and that God's Not
[2:15:34] Dead that God's still alive he's Jesus
[2:15:37] the same yesterday today and forever and
[2:15:39] he's the god of Miracles he can still
[2:15:41] heal you Marcus and you could see the
[2:15:43] look in that man and Mary his wife there
[2:15:46] and she's listening and he says I want
[2:15:47] to tell you he says I want to tell you
[2:15:49] Marcus that God is Not in your
[2:15:51] denominations he's not in your Trinity
[2:15:53] of gods and and the denominations are
[2:15:55] condemned and and and and and The
[2:15:57] Trinity is condemned and and he's and
[2:15:59] Travis goes on this thing and you know
[2:16:01] that it's you know you're part I'm not
[2:16:02] telling you you're bad people but I'm
[2:16:04] telling you that denominations are of

[2:16:26] said I hope I didn't offend
[2:16:29] you he says I hope I I didn't mean to he
[2:16:32] said I didn't mean to say anything to

[2:16:37] needed to be honest I never forget
[2:16:40] Marcus man stood there and he sat there
[2:16:42] and he bowed his head and he said no no
[2:16:45] Travis He said you didn't offend me he
[2:16:48] said in fact when you and your friend
[2:16:50] knocked on the door
[2:16:51] a voice spoke to me and said these are
[2:16:53] men sent from the Lord listen to what
[2:16:56] they have to
[2:16:59] say friends you may not realize it but
[2:17:01] God's always
[2:17:04] working take no thought for what you'll
[2:17:06] say for in that moment Jesus
[2:17:08] said said a voice spoke to him and said
[2:17:11] these are men sent from the Lord listen
[2:17:13] to what they have to say he said so I
[2:17:14] was prepared to hear anything you've got
[2:17:16] to
[2:17:19] say so I be begin to talk and I said
[2:17:24] Marcus all I did was take that book
[2:17:25] healing everything brother bham taught
[2:17:27] in there and I said Marcus I I want you
[2:17:30] to know that that that that that that
[2:17:32] tumor that you have is just a life
[2:17:34] doctors have given in the name it's
[2:17:35] cancer and the non Hotchkins L foman
[2:17:37] they've named it and I said but I want
[2:17:39] to tell you that that that that that
[2:17:41] that's a life that's living off of your
[2:17:43] life it's a demon spirit in Mark n when
[2:17:45] Jesus prays for the blind man Jesus
[2:17:47] didn't say death you know give it the
[2:17:49] doctor's name Jesus says Thou deaf
[2:17:53] Spirit a living organism living life
[2:17:57] come out of the man and do not enter him
[2:18:01] again and I said that life that's living
[2:18:03] on your life can kill you if the doctors
[2:18:05] can do everything they can to take it
[2:18:06] out of your body and that's good that's
[2:18:08] praise God but listen Marcus that that
[2:18:10] life wants to kill you and I said I want
[2:18:12] to tell you today I don't have any bag
[2:18:14] of doctors tools but I've got a book
[2:18:16] full of promises in God's word
[2:18:19] [Applause]
[2:18:21] and you could feel just the atmosphere
[2:18:22] of Faith beginning to raise in that b in
[2:18:25] that little living room you can feel the
[2:18:27] atmosphere change and I begin to testify
[2:18:29] to them I said I want to tell you about
[2:18:31] a little woman if you go to slide 13 I
[2:18:33] said this little woman I know personally
[2:18:36] her name is Elena but she lives in
[2:18:38] Louisiana I said she also was diagnosed
[2:18:41] with stage four non- Hoskins
[2:18:43] lymphoma and I said that that little
[2:18:45] woman I said was diagnosed with the same
[2:18:47] exact thing and you could see Mary as
[2:18:49] Mary Mary uh
[2:18:51] just perked up real quick and I said
[2:18:53] that little woman was diagnosed with the
[2:18:55] same exact thing that you've got and I
[2:18:57] said but I want to tell you a little bit
[2:18:59] about her testimonial can I read this to
[2:19:01] you here tonight I found this here
[2:19:03] sister Elena says it and and she says a
[2:19:06] week before Christmas I was diagnosed
[2:19:08] with stage four non- hodkin lyoma two
[2:19:10] days after Christmas I started the first
[2:19:12] of 12 chemo treatments they told me that
[2:19:14] after four treatments they would do a
[2:19:16] pet scan to see how my body's responding
[2:19:18] I believe God's A Healer I've told that
[2:19:20] to anyone who asks what I'm how I'm
[2:19:21] doing I told them I was looking to him
[2:19:24] and believe he would heal me on Sunday I
[2:19:26] leaped and danced before the Lord with
[2:19:29] joy and victory notice because I
[2:19:32] realized it was already a finished
[2:19:36] work you see sometimes you got to do
[2:19:39] something naturally in order to move
[2:19:42] something
[2:19:44] supernaturally oh come on somebody
[2:19:47] sometimes you got to do something
[2:19:49] physically naturally to get a
[2:19:51] supernatural
[2:19:52] reaction why did nonon have to dip seven
[2:19:55] times why did Jesus when he prayed for a
[2:19:57] little blind man didn't just say you're
[2:19:59] healed he spits on the ground he rolls
[2:20:01] up some mud what is it the physical
[2:20:03] brother Bandon would say it this way the
[2:20:04] natural always runs with the
[2:20:08] spiritual why did is he standing there
[2:20:10] with banks woods and he throws a rock up
[2:20:12] into the air and brother says that
[2:20:15] Disturbed the
[2:20:16] atmosphere oh my brother my sister I say
[2:20:20] it's time if you want to say Amen to the
[2:20:23] word of God let that word change the
[2:20:31] atmosphere brother vom said it Disturbed
[2:20:34] the atmosphere and when it landed it was
[2:20:36] a tornado our earthquake that almost
[2:20:38] suck
[2:20:43] Alaska why did Haddie have to say the
[2:20:46] right
[2:20:48] words whatever you say Sister hadie
[2:20:51] Sister Elena begins to run and dance
[2:20:53] before the Lord she says I knew it was a
[2:20:55] finished work even though I didn't know
[2:20:58] how or when even though there was no
[2:21:01] proof yet they were
[2:21:06] singing what have I to
[2:21:09] dread what have I to
[2:21:12] fear
[2:21:14] leaning on the
[2:21:19] Everlasting sister l begins to say oh I
[2:21:23] have blessedness with my Lord so
[2:21:27] near that sounds strange to many but in
[2:21:29] the Bible maram danced for Joy when she
[2:21:32] crossed the Red Sea and the
[2:21:35] Egyptians who had plagued her and
[2:21:37] enslaved her and bothered her and
[2:21:40] tormented her when she seen her enemy
[2:21:43] was dead in the river she began to shout
[2:21:47] oh my brother my sister when I see the
[2:21:49] enemy I fought my whole life and when
[2:21:52] he's cast into the Lake of Fire I
[2:21:55] believe I'll be dancing and shouting and
[2:21:57] singing on The Hills of
[2:22:03] Glory
[2:22:06] Hallelujah it's a sign and expression of
[2:22:08] extreme joy and victory I knew my
[2:22:11] healing would come sooner or later
[2:22:12] because the Jesus of the Bible the great
[2:22:15] healer is the same Jesus I served for 27
[2:22:18] years yesterday I had my pet scan and
[2:22:21] today I met my doctor for my fourth
[2:22:23] treatment go to that next slide he
[2:22:25] informed me that the cancer is already
[2:22:28] gone on the left is the cancer on the
[2:22:31] right is a body that is
[2:22:36] cancer that's my
[2:22:39] God that's my
[2:22:44] Jesus Hallelujah
[2:22:51] tears begin to well up in Mary she said
[2:22:53] oh I've always believed in a
[2:22:55] supernatural God like that I've seen him
[2:22:57] as a little girl I've seen the
[2:22:59] supernatural work of God the man put the
[2:23:02] woman over there say does that mean that
[2:23:03] God has the H him I said no that's not
[2:23:04] what it means God has a Divine will it's
[2:23:06] a sovereign
[2:23:07] will I don't mean that for a
[2:23:11] moment but let me tell you what God can
[2:23:14] do sir God can heal God can save God can
[2:23:21] set free there's nothing too hard for my
[2:23:28] God we begin to sit there and i' begin
[2:23:31] to begin to say just you could see the
[2:23:34] tears welling up in Mary you could see
[2:23:37] the atmosphere entire atmosphere change
[2:23:39] I begin to pray IID never forget that
[2:23:41] moment as I laid my hands on Marcus here
[2:23:43] he's full of cancer you could see him in
[2:23:46] that slide there you can see the cancer
[2:23:48] just going through his body there he is
[2:23:50] is with this tumor you can go to the
[2:23:51] next one the tumor that's about the size
[2:23:53] of a grapefruit on his neck he had it
[2:23:56] all down his body down his calves go to
[2:23:58] the next slide is pet scan full of
[2:24:00] cancer in the normal pet scan you can
[2:24:02] see a black spot here for the liver and
[2:24:04] the in the heart you can't even see
[2:24:06] anything he's covered he had on his calf
[2:24:08] he had he had tumors the size of
[2:24:12] apples ate
[2:24:15] up and I begin to never forget laying my
[2:24:18] hands on him I begin to to pray and I
[2:24:21] said God I'd be reminded of that man in
[2:24:23] the Bible who couldn't get to Jesus and
[2:24:26] his condition he had gotten so bad he
[2:24:28] couldn't get to him you might know
[2:24:29] somebody like that here tonight that
[2:24:31] Satan is so tangled up and messed up and
[2:24:33] you realize they'd never be in a church
[2:24:35] like this I how God how could you even
[2:24:37] save my my my child he's so lost and at
[2:24:40] never even be in a church like this
[2:24:41] never never even be a meeting like this
[2:24:44] maybe they're so so torn up with some
[2:24:45] disease or something in their body and
[2:24:47] my mind just begin to think of that
[2:24:48] little man on that bed brother the Daryl
[2:24:51] and he couldn't get to the Lord but my
[2:24:52] Bible says that his friends picked up
[2:24:55] his
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:24:57] bed and they begin to take his body to
[2:25:01] Jesus and the Bible says that when they
[2:25:03] got to Jesus he was surrounded by people
[2:25:05] in a little Hut but that wasn't going to
[2:25:07] stop the faith of that mother or that
[2:25:09] father or that Pastor it wasn't going to
[2:25:11] stop the faith of those friends my Bible
[2:25:13] says they climbed up on the roof and
[2:25:16] they ripped the roof off and they
[2:25:18] lowered him down to Jesus Jesus and
[2:25:21] Jesus said by your faith this man is
[2:25:23] made he they may not be here tonight
[2:25:26] they may be a million miles away but I
[2:25:29] challenge you to rip the roof off

[2:25:45] Jesus let me give you what the words of
[2:25:47] the lord gave
[2:25:48] me just a day before before I came here

[2:25:54] this God gave me the words and I'll take
[2:25:57] them I'll give them to you just the way
[2:25:58] he gave to me I want to tell somebody

[2:26:19] barroom somewhere where I don't care how
[2:26:21] lost and how many years it has been
[2:26:24] don't you let the devil rearrange it and
[2:26:26] try to rearr it and say it'll be this
[2:26:29] way and God must have been it this way

[2:26:34] [Applause]
[2:26:39] You Don't abort it don't abort
[2:26:43] it I began to pray I said Lord just as
[2:26:47] Hezekiah asked for years who's going to
[2:26:50] give a death sentence and ask for
[2:26:52] years I pray for this man who stood for
[2:26:54] you he's a preacher God he's he's
[2:26:57] preached from your Bible he's spoken
[2:26:58] about you Lord if he was if he was not

[2:27:02] of him Lord would you heal this man you

[2:27:17] burdens to the Lord and we left them
[2:27:22] there and that's all you can
[2:27:27] do and we walked out months go by forget
[2:27:32] how many months it was months go by

[2:27:38] my living room sitting there talking to
[2:27:40] me where is talking about things you
[2:27:42] know nothing really important Travis is
[2:27:44] just in the middle of a sentence I never
[2:27:46] forget he pulls out his phone

[2:27:52] praise God Marcus has been
[2:27:54] supernaturally healed of stage four non
[2:27:57] hosin lymphoma he is

[2:28:43] it in the name of the Lord could you do
[2:28:44] that here tonight friends don't give up
[2:28:47] on your miracle
[2:28:50] thank you Lord he is still Jehovah Gyra
[2:28:55] he is still Jehovah Raa and he is more
[2:28:59] than ever before wanting to pour out the
[2:29:08] supernatural oh thank you Lord God I
[2:29:11] think of many needs her tonight I think
[2:29:13] of how many needs we have in this body I
[2:29:16] think of my brother Ron Spencer there in
[2:29:18] Virginia and let me tell you something
[2:29:20] the doctors might say one thing but drct
[2:29:22] Jesus says
[2:29:23] another whose report will you believe I
[2:29:26] said whose report will you believe the
[2:29:29] report of cancer the the report of what
[2:29:31] the naysayers say and the doubter I say
[2:29:33] I choose to believe the words of the
[2:29:37] Lord that they are yay and amen they are
[2:29:40] thus saith the Lord it is God's promise
[2:29:43] not my
[2:29:46] promise wonder if you take that need
[2:29:49] raise it up as you byow your heads and
[2:29:50] say Lord I'm representing behind my
[2:29:53] hand all the needs in our
[2:29:57] body the needs of this church those
[2:30:00] listening
[2:30:02] online I bring those needs up I believe
[2:30:04] my Bible told me to to speak them to
[2:30:07] bring those needs before the Lord it's
[2:30:09] not just one it's many there's not just
[2:30:12] one or two friends I know the needs of
[2:30:14] the body are many many
[2:30:18] many but I've got a go
[2:30:20] God who says it's never too late don't
[2:30:24] you give up on your miracle I don't care
[2:30:27] how lost I don't care how far away I
[2:30:30] don't care how distant it looks I don't
[2:30:32] care how many years it's been don't you
[2:30:34] give up on that Supernatural God friends
[2:30:38] if we lose that Supernatural God we are
[2:30:42] doomed it will take a supernatural
[2:30:45] Miracle to change your body one day and
[2:30:48] I say Lord let me not restrict you let
[2:30:51] me not hinder you let me not hamper you
[2:30:53] let me say God I give you freedom I give
[2:30:56] you Reign I give you full control Lord
[2:30:59] to move to speak to to operate I give it
[2:31:01] to you God I'm going to lay aside all my
[2:31:04] ideas I'm just going to come before you
[2:31:06] nothing in my hands I bring simply to
[2:31:08] thy cross I clean I give it to God now
[2:31:12] whatever that need is I wonder if you'd
[2:31:14] put your hand over on that person beside
[2:31:16] you I wonder if you'd bind your faith
[2:31:18] together you call out you call out to
[2:31:21] God for whatever your need is I believe
[2:31:23] this church could call the name of a
[2:31:25] mighty warrior brother Ron Spencer who's
[2:31:27] Faithfully stood and preached this
[2:31:29] message in country after country brother
[2:31:31] man who in in great need stands for the
[2:31:33] message of the hour not just brother Ron
[2:31:35] but many names we can name here tonight
[2:31:37] whatever that need is I wonder if this
[2:31:39] church would just begin to call on God
[2:31:41] and say God we've heard about it we've
[2:31:43] spoken about it we've preached about it
[2:31:45] but now we're Believers we're going to
[2:31:47] believe about it God we're going to
[2:31:49] stand
[2:31:50] upon the promises the unfailing promises
[2:31:53] of almighty God I don't care if it's
[2:31:55] that boy or that girl or that mother
[2:31:58] who's walked away or that father who's
[2:32:00] walked away nothing is too late nothing
[2:32:03] is too hard nothing is too far gone as
[2:32:06] long as there's breath in the body
[2:32:08] there's a miracle waiting to
[2:32:12] happen oh God we raise up our voices
[2:32:15] here tonight Lord in this room we feel

[2:32:24] to kill Hearts he's wanting to mend

[2:32:38] supernatural power anybody who's born of
