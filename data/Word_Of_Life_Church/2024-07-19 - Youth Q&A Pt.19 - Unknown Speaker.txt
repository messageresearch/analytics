over him praise the Lord so our hope is in him tday imagine if our Hope was just in all that we could see around us Carol and I was talking about it yesterday our U political scene is in such chaos and our world is in such chaos disease trouble heartache if that was our only hope honestly don't what we'd have to live for if you could just imagine all the diseases and things that face us especially get a little bit older like I am you don't think about it when you're your age but whenever you go to getting older and you think oh my goodness what lays before me dementia car wreck falling getting hurt you say oh no but I'm so grateful that no matter what happens to us physically our hope is in him and we have a better world so let me say U how much I appreciate the the brothers on the music brother JC doing the singing and we give them a s God we know that music is a very important part of a service a matter of fact the prophet told us that that's what that armies do whenever they would go out before the battle they would sing and it makes such a difference in the in the service and we're not Church of Christ around years so we really like music so we certainly appreciate all the effort of our brothers putting forth to make it nice for us oh we'll we'll pick up on the question that um the last one that I dealt with um is it wrong to wear mascara SL D Al es I know many women dye their eyelashes black to avoid wearing mascara but are you not achieving the same goal I wear mascara sometimes but feel people look at that differently than dying your eyelashes are they both wrong question mark or neither question mark let's pray together just ask the Lord to help us tonight Lord Jesus we thank you for the opportunity that we can be together again as brother Paul has already said father we're thankful for the service last night I know it was serious it was um soul searching and Carol and I were talking about it as we went home and I told her I said no doubt every person sitting there in church T not filled with the Holy Ghost but they still just looking just to make sure and dear God we realize that it's too serious a thing for us to play with it our soul our destiny lays before us and we're thankful that you've sent us a word in this day that would help us to prepare father many of these questions that we've dealt with so far have been about is this wrong or that wrong and it's something on the hearts of your people as it was when the prophet started dealing with these questions back in 1953 again in 54 and 57 59 61 63 64 every now and then he would do it because he wanted to see he said what was on the church's mind and many of them were not just doctrinal things but they were about is this wrong or is it wrong to do that we want to be right it's our heart's desire I pray that you'd help me tonight Lord that I can be able to answer them in a way that'll be pleasing to you bless each of us as we sit together in Jesus name amen God bless you thank you for coming tonight you can you can be seated I'd like to uh start out with this one and read to you this quote um so you women that likes to put on paint you know where it come from it's excuse me it's a heathen worship it's a heathen worship that's exactly right keep it off of you it's not becoming to Christians now what I find amazing is about some of the things that brother brandham said doctrinally or even morally and he would say something like this it's a heathen worship and then people think where in the world did he get that but I'll tell you what I found amazing as I go on and steud and steud and and study I find more and more I really don't need the validation of um an encyclopedia or the validation of a dictionary to back up what the prophet taught but I know that it helps actually helps some people uh but whenever I begin to look at these various things I think wow so he was right exactly right but yet whenever you go to tying it back so let's read 2 Kings chapter 9:30 and when J was come to jezrael Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head that don't mean she put a 14inch tire on the top of her head but she was combing her hair and trying to make herself look very seductive by this time Jezebel uh as far as her age would have been in her late 40s or early 50s J was a much younger man but she still felt like apparently that she had the ability to be able to Swoon him with her appearance and with her looks so as we can see from this pattern that there is something about a woman's looks that can be a seductive tool or it can be a tool a gift that God gave her and she can be able to give that to her husband and be a testimony to the to the kingdom of God either way it's whichever one you want to use it God put a gift in my life to be able to speak to people I know of some preachers that have backslid I know of one particular preacher that I'm thinking about right now preached the message for years and years he's actually preached for us several times years ago and U he got got away from the Lord backslid but that man still has the ability to speak as a matter of fact the last video that I saw of him speaking he was standing behind a bar because he's become a bartender and he was teaching people how to introduce people who love to drink alcohol to vodka because vodka is such a strong drink so he was taking his ability and as I watched him someone had sent me the video and as I watched him and I could still see the same mannerisms that I saw in him when he preached I could see this ability to be able to influence people and it just absolutely broke my heart to see it Elvis Presley learned how to sing anybody know where Assembly of God Church in Memphis Tennessee brother Bram said he knew his Pastor knew his family and them so when Elvis sold out his gifts then what did he do he didn't stop dancing he just start changed Partners so instead of dancing in the presence of the Lord Lord he started doing it all over the scenes and all over the world all over the auditoriums and things like that so he took his gift that God gave him sold it out to the devil well it's the same thing you know um you young men that are fine handsome looking man it don't mean that you've got to get a get a can opener and scrape up your face and you know be all ugly you sisters don't have to come in stringy headed and think well it's a curse to be beautiful and I'm going to get a butcher knife and I'm going to put X's and O's on my face you don't have to do that but you can be able to use that and and allow God to be able to bless it so that you can be an example of a very pretty woman or an attractive woman that does not use it as bait it's evident that our lord Jesus loves adornment it's evident that our lord Jesus loves color that he loves variety I know y'all think I'm kind of of different anyway but I I just showed Carol before we came to church I'm working on a habitat for a deer that I uh the Lord blessed me with and in Illinois this past fall so I'm working on the base of it and all so I've got all types of little shells and all different types of things out of my basement and I'm just stand there showing her the different colors and you think why didn't God just make them all a drab gray or drab Brown so do them things ever see their self have you ever seen a snail with this little tiny iPhone and he's making these images of himself what about a butterfly what about song birds that are absolutely so beautiful do you reckon the The Little Hummingbird realizes how beautiful his iridescent colors are how that they are blue in certain lights when the light spectrum will change he'll change into a green and then he can go toward a hue which is across between a red and a purple you reckon he's ever even seen that about himself no he doesn't wonder who that was made for the trees the leaves and and the forest where he flies around no God made it for us so for us to think that God is against that is totally wrong but it's what that we use it for now watch whenever she painted her face and want I'm going to share with you tonight is some history but also some things that I found in uh in Bible studies so I want to show you now some of the things I'm going to read to you tonight are from a commentator by the name of Adam Clark which wrote in the 1600s some from Wesley which wrote in the 1700s so this was a common practice among the church for hundreds and hundreds of years until the last day and the Bible says she painted her face you can read with me if you'd like so she died the up and under eyelids a common practice in the East now notice what it's for the effect is to increase the apparent size of the eye to give it an unnatural brilliancy I want you to notice now who it is doing this it's not the daughters of Israel it's not the people of God 2 Kings again chapter 9:30 and when jaob was come to jezrael J heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out the window now I want you to look at the meaning one of the meanings that I found of this word p u w k puke does God have a sense of humor or what I just couldn't believe it I'm still laughing about it as you can see look at the the meaning now of the word puke antimony stibium black paint I cosmetic wow so every woman then that does this actually is putting puke on her eyes that's very sickening is it not now watch it's a favorite eye paint with oriental women even to the present day it is prepared from antimony ore which were pounded it yields a black powder with a metallic brilliancy which was laid upon the eyebrows and eyelashes either in a dry State as a black powder or moistened now this is pre Mary Kay and Maybelline but I want you to notice now these things I'm going to read to you who these people are that did this moistened generally with oil and made into an ointment which is applied with a fine smooth eye pencil of the thickness of an ordinary Goose quill made either of wood metal or Ivory so the edges of the eyelids were blackened all around now men also started doing this as well in Rome it was a fad in the day back when and the object was to heighten the Splendor of the dark Southern eye now to many of you that's never been in part of the Mediterranean world you know it wouldn't mean a whole lot to you but to look at their eyes their eyes their hair they wanted something that would make the eye stick out so they would enlarging the Border or the perimeter so looking at the eyes because eyes can be very seductive eyes can be very communicative in the way that they communicate even in the Song of Solomon whenever the Lord says that speaking to the bride one of your eyes has caught me so eyes can speak volumes so that the edges of the eyelids are blackened all around and the object was to heighten the Splendor of the dark Southern eye and give it so to speak a more deeply glowing fire and to impart a useful appearance that makes sense to me while you see 75 and 80y old women paint all over their face they're trying to look younger ain't they I guess they don't realize in big caverns and then big wrinkles there are still there I tell you what we're waiting for we're waiting for the Lord to take them out of our face aren't we to the whole of the eyelashes even in extreme old age I listen at this rosalini which was an archaeologist found jars with eye paint of this kind and this dated back now listen to the early Egyptian Graves now I want you to think how far back the people have been doing this so they've been searching it's like down through time that there was a search on to modify to change our looks to change our appearance to make it of course exterior instead of Ting something from within now let's just be plain and honest tonight it's a shame really but many times we find it in politics we find it in religion we find it in church that sometimes a more attractive girl will have more friends than a girl that's playing which is very sad a more attractive young man might have more friends and then they can tend to be bullied they can tend to be picked on because of their looks maybe they're a little bit heavier than someone else or maybe they're skinnier it can go either way and yet they get picked on by this one and picked on by that one and most of us probably have been bullied at one time or another in our life I was bullied the whole time I went to school there's one particular boy that picked on me all the time he was meaner than a copperhead and that's mean ever ever time he had the opportunity he was a few years older than me and he was a bully he would cuss me uh more than likely because I was a Christian so I didn't like to play sports but my I had to take Sports in order to be able to go through school so I was playing basketball and he was on the opposing team one day and I had this bad habit and it was this I chewed my tongue gross right so whenever I would I would bounce the basketball I would chew my tongue James Pendleton was his name so he come right by me and took his elbow and hit me right here in the chin he saw what I was doing I nearly cut my tongue off well I'm so glad I didn't I've needed it my whole life I've still got the scars there but it almost I almost bit my tongue in two and since then it's always made me very defensive of those who become bullied now for those of you that have heard a little bit about the young man that tried to take president former president Trump's life this was part of his background he was bullied in school didn't hardly have any friends nobody liked him he was a loner he had 27 contacts on his cell phone 207 now I find that sad you know what I find even more sad is whenever we would have young people or older people that feel that way when they come to church it's very sad because it's something that tends to carry over so what does it make them want to do if we don't feel accepted if we don't feel liked or loved then we think why should I even go back I'm not even going back no more well I hope and pray that we never May anyone feel like that in our church no matter what color their skin is no no matter how much money they make no matter if they've got a slight stutter or if they're fat or skinny or ugly or whatever they are I hope we can realize and look at them as a soul inside of that body any of you all ever been bullied or ever left out and you know maybe you're not the special kid and you know they always pick everybody but you on the soccer and everybody but you on the basketball anybody ever been there I have on all the the above I was ugly I was poor I wore blue jeans that had holes in them before they were in style I wore the red Dollar Store tennis shoes before they were in style they cost $150 I was laughed at made fun of ridiculed as a matter of fact I had a flashback of it yesterday as I was talking to someone on the phone and I could see myself on the Wayne County Elementary School playground I was in grade two I could remember is right brother Joe I was there again standing out there in that playground wishing I had somebody that would speak to me somebody that would play with me third grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade on up till I come to high school then my so-called friends were the guys who brought Playboy magazines to school and would get me down in the concrete floor and I would close my eyes and they would take their fingers and pull my eyes apart like this they were the ones that supposedly were my friends you can imagine how my enemies treated me so I've never really appreciated anybody bullying anybody else and let me just say it because we've got adults at stream in the service tonight I will not tolerate as the pastor people bullying people that come to our church hello so if you're a bully brother Don's got your number don't do it here cuz if need be I'll call your name and I'll call your parents name and if that don't work I'll call your grandma's name honestly you see what happens is that socially it comes to that spot to where the people feel the on the outside and then what do they do they go to doing things to be accepted so they'll act weird sometimes they'll act strange just today they found out some of the post of this 20-year-old young man that tried to assassinate former president Trump and he said that what this certain certain thing this is going to be his Premiere what's he looking for attention attention you know it's a great thing to be talented we have got some of those talented singers here in our church talented musicians wonderful I'm so grateful to God for them and yet there's other people they're not talented solo singers but they might be able to blend in on a choir that's me I'm talking about now you know be able to blend in with 50 voices and hopefully the other 49 will sing louder than they do and yet them type of people can feel left out they can feel left out of this and left out of that so whenever we look and see what people were looking for and again I I remind you of this quote where the Prophet said that it's a heathen worship so watch in Isaiah 3:16 moreover the Lord sayth because the daughters of Zion are hay they walk with stretched forth necks and wanting eyes now here is a a posture about their body that is not natural it's something that they're doing to enhance the way they walk and they walked with stretched forth necks and Wen eyes walking and mincing as they go now they would actually put bracelets on their ankles and it was a sign of decoration but they would also put either silver or gold or metallic types of bells on the bottom of it and it would tinkle as they would go notice he says walking and mincing as they go which is a manner of walking making a tinkling with their feet now was this for uh some some type of therapy was this for pain maybe in their joints y'all ain't laughing was for this for some type of uh I don't know what it was they had plantar fasciatus and they're tinkling and it's making their feet feel better what's it for all of these things that Isaiah mentioned is to draw attention so people will not only look at them but they will hear them as they see them coming so it's something to draw attention and why and what for in a wrongful way so the tarum now the tarum anybody ever heard the tarum you know what the tarum is no okay so the tarum was a book which was written after the uh pente which is the first five books of Moses so it's a it's an ancient Hebrew Book uh so this is the name that they gave it so the taram says they walk with their eyes painted as Jezebel painted her face in the talmudic language and the talud is another word for the first five books of Moses is used for Vermilion now Vermilion was a red dye or a red lead with which they painted their eyes as they did also with black lead now this was not a custom that the children of Israel had from God that God said hey daughters this is no problem y'all go ahead and do it but what happened was after they got in their land then the daughters of Israel began to take on the same Customs as the other people look in Ezekiel CH 23: 40 furthermore that you have sent for men to come from afar unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paint thy eyes and deck thyself with ornaments now by the time we get to the prophecy of Ezekiel both Israel and Judah remember there was one one nation originally called Israel but then there become a division after the domain of Solomon and God divided the kingdom and one was called Judah and the other was called Israel Judah had their prophets Israel had their prophets God even spoke to them separately and God dealt with them separately which is so sad that's why God's against splits and churches because that's exactly what it causes but by the time we get to the Book of Ezekiel then we see they were just about at the state of total rejection from God so God said whenever he saw them he passed by them and when they come out of the land of Egypt whenever they were born they had no one to wipe the afterbirth off of them no one salted them which was a custom in that day no one suppled them but God said I passed by thee and I saw thee and thy blood Ezekiel 16 I saw thee and thy blood and I said live y I say unto thee live and God said you started growing up and your hair grew out and God began to describe her as she come from a child to puberty and then she come into the stage where she was a young woman and she was becoming of a marriageable age so this was under God's love and God's tutorship and then God said when you come to a state of a marriageable age what did you do then you you set along the roadside the Bible can be very plain in the way it says you set along the roadside and you parted your legs for every man to come into you now God was using a natural symbol of a harlot or a prostitute so it was God that raised her God that saved her God that kept her God that moved for her and then once she come to the marriageable age Satan moved in and married her but it wasn't him that rais raised her it wasn't him that took care of her it was God you understand the devil's done that every time in every age that's exactly what he done to even the Garden of Eden it's what he tried to do to Sarah what he tried to do to Rebecca what he did to the Ephesian Church age what he will try to do to our church he will try to do it to every Church in this message and the sad part about it is there will be some mess message people that will fall in love with the devil and they will listen to him because we're at the age of marriage and the Lord nurtured us through justification through sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost he raised us up he give us his Mercy gave us his grace all these great things and here we are at the very age of the marriage and Satan will try to do the exact same thing he did to the children of Israel so by this stage now Israel is acting like a harlot how sad how very very sad thou paint us thine eyes or thyself thine eyes and deck thyself With Thine ornament so here God is making a parallel to the pattern of the way the harlots would do in that day just as harlots do make themselves agreeable to their lovers who use washes and paint as Jezebel did and dress themselves in their best clothes and Adorn themselves in the best manner they can harlots had their particular attire by which they were known they not only use binos which is a form of a bass or bass but washes for their face I want you to notice what they would do they would not if they were prostitute they were Harlot they would not set say a busy intersection and they would sit there and they smell like a pole cat I'm tell you what their hair hadn't been washed in 6 weeks and you get around them and you couldn't even hardly stand to be around them cuz they smelt so bad but they would wash and they would perfume and they would put on makeup and they would make their eyes look very attractive and they would put on their best clothes and they knew exactly no doubt they had designer clothes in them days and they knew exactly how to dress in certain things and they would stand on a certain way in the street what was it advertisement sisters don't put your body up as advertisement your body is a sacred thing God give you this sacred thing of your body oh it just breaks my heart they particularly painted their eyes to make them look larger for large eyes in women in some nations were reckoned very beautiful now in our culture if we would look at that and think good Lord that's scary look at that woman Lord have mercy well more than likely they wouldn't do it here so you see what Satan does is he modifies sin according to your culture even according to your region so where we are here we're of course universities liberals we got a whole whole slew of liberals here in our Tri Cities area there'll be certain things I'll have to preach and certain things I'll have to deal with and our church that say some brothers different parts of the world they're in the Backwoods are not no university around them nowhere and they'll never have to deal with it and they may stream one of our services and say what in the world is brother Donnie having to deal with that for why in the world well we Face certain things in our region and our area that other people won't have to deal with is that right and then there may be certain things that they would have to preach against that we wouldn't have to deal with this is the way Satan will modify sin now watch in in some Nations it was reckoned very beautiful particularly among the Greeks hence Juno history now Juno in Homer is called bolink the ox eyed as some translate it or rather the large eyed Juno and the Grecian women in order to make their eyes large made use of a powder mixed with washes which shrunk their eyebrows and caused their eyes to stand out that that sounds very weird to us I mean it's like oh my goodness why in the world would you want to do that because on their culture it appeared very beautiful sounds like putting a cucumber and a Bass to turn it into a pickle to me it sounds like lime or alum or something you you think what in the world but in their region in their culture they thought it was very attractive I can see this some of you this is the first time you've ever heard this in your entire life but remember the devil that did it to them is still alive today and he will do things in our culture traveling among the Africans and the Asians and different parts of the the world it's amazing what you see and it's amazing the different parts of Africa that I've been in you hardly ever see women in pants going to China you hardly ever see women in dresses now that's coming from the communistic moves where that women and men work in the fields together they dress the same they look the same so for some of the women in China it was a real difficult thing to get them to see the need of wearing dresses why different culture so then the men of God according to the region where they are they would have to tackle some of these things so what Satan do he'll pull things now each church has its own personality the people who come to that church make the personality of the church our church has changed personalities many times since I've been the pastor now it's not that I'm by polar and that I've changed the personality of the church but it's when people move in and they have different views and they have different needs you are what dictates what's preached over the pulpit your needs what you have need of so the personality of our church has changed multiple times I know that it will change again because it's like whenever your mom and dad got married well they took your dad come from a normal in his home your mother come from a normal in her home then they begin to create a new Norm which was part of his normal part of her normal his mom and dad come over and said well son that ain't the way we raised you we didn't do that in our house and then her mom and dad come over and said that's sure ain't the way we done it in our house and she said Mama he don't like it done that way here so what do they do they have a norm they're creating a personality which exists of two people then a baby come along the way well say the first one was a perfect little child it went to bed at 8:00 at night it only woke up to have its diaper changeed and feed you know and it went right back to sleep it slept till 8:00 the next morning Mama's thinking this is so awesome I want another child so she talks Daddy into it they have child number two ah but Child Number Two changed the personality again because child number two after 3 months has colic so it squalls it screams it cries it's up at two then up at 4: then up at 5 Mom and Daddy's trying to find the papers from the hospital to see what a what how long the return policy is on this baby they're trying to see has it expired where they can turn it back they are totally convinced they got the wrong baby there's no way both of them being just next to God himself could have produced such a brat so what did that child do change the personality of the home they're darome to have child number three so you see what Satan does with sin so say we would have an element of people in our church we have some older people in our church they're beyond the makeup day okay forget it they don't even care no more they they they ain't worried about it they ain't worried about if their eyes look that big or that big you know some of them don't know our world are in they get up a world every day but some more of the middleaged well they you know they kind of cater to this and there's some that's younger like you and you're concerned many of you are single you hope that there's a boy out there for you or a girl so you think well what can I do that would make myself stand out a little bit from all the rest of these girls especially them for there they all look the same oh they do they're The Parkers aren't they how can I make myself different why can I do to make myself unique and you see Satan will take that desire to make you look unique and if you're not careful you start leaning just a little bit toward the world well maybe I could just you know do a little this and a little of that nobody would ever know but your reason is what your reason for doing it is what now watch thou paint us th eyes the figure is that of a lwd woman preparing herself now this is not a quote from the message as I said Adam Clark Elliot different commentators this was taught by the Baptist Church years ago this part of this I'm fixing to read to you is from Baptist theology you don't find many of them that believe it now and Methodist Methodist women years ago they ain't no way they'd wear no britches they wouldn't even wear a ring there was a great debate among the Methodist churches years ago if it was a sin for a woman to wear a wedding ring and now the Methodist Church is ordaining gay pastors and lesbians you see how it can change now watch the figure is that of a lwd woman preparing herself for her lover now remember what this symbolism is then a woman painting her face putting on all these things look where it comes from not the church the prophet said it was Heathen worship so it was the symbol of a lwd woman preparing herself for her lover and awaiting his arrival painting the eyes or rather the lids and the lashes was an ancient custom pre Maybelline Prem Mary Kay and the pink Cadillacs still preserved in the East now notice the scripture here paint us thine eyes like a decay Harlot mest up thy defects with paint women throughout the ancient near East regularly enlarged and darkened their eyes with a mixture compounded of olive oil mixed with malachite so we've done looked at they used green black red notice now green or Galina which is black Babylonian sources mention ey paint that included snite antimony talide decorated pallets were used to grind the ore and mix it for application these pallets have been found in many iron two sites listen this shame in Israel including megiddo so these predated Israel coming into the land and then what did the Israelites do they started picking up the customs of Johnson City as we'll say or the customs of Chicago or the customs of Houston or Dallas or Paris it might shock you to know that there are an element of so-called message churches and the pastors in a certain move around this message who do not preach Holiness anymore so their women were high heels they paint their face they cut their hair they look just like any other denominational church and they would look at you all tonight you sisters and they would laugh at you and they most certainly laugh at me because they know who I am and they think they have more like than we do I particularly don't want that light do you they're not getting closer to God they're becoming more like heathens an't that awful to have to say watch this in Ezekiel 23:41 now what's God likening Israel to the pattern of a harlot how awful when the Beloved of God is acting like Street prostitutes thou satest upon a stately bed I want you to notice now where Israel is Israel is painting her eyes painting her face laring her eyebrows you know all these things that she's doing now that she's got that done notice where she's sitting she's sitting on a bed it's for for a reason it's for a purpose she's not sitting at the kitchen table she's not sitting outside in a garden somewhere she's sitting on a stately bed now they would decorate their rooms they would decorate their beds they would straw Petals of flowers they would have perfumes they would have candles and different types of things that were going and set us upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou Hast set mine incense and mine oil now look the very things that God gave them now they're taking it and using it to commit adultery the adulterous Jerusalem is portrayed in much the same light as the prostitute in Proverbs 710 to 23 now you can write that down and read if you'd like both seduced their lovers with an inviting couch incense and persuasive words prior to the helenistic period all references to the couch are associated with a sleeping chamber 2 Samuel 4:7 Psalm 66 not the banqueting room incense and oil on the table as a part of anticipated sexual activity the adulterous Jerusalem has perfumed her bed chamber with incense Song of Solomon chap 1:3 also chap 4:10 and has sweet smelling oils at hand for anointing her hair and bodies Esther 2:12 similar images are found in the Egyptian love songs discovered by archaeologists in the carac temple complex in luxord a few years ago carolly and I stood there in the carac temple and luxur now why am I reading all this so you can see what has been comes into view again but it was not a sign of great great signs of education and civilization and godliness and Purity it was a sign when you go to seeing people doing all of this and acting this way and taking this image on theirself it was a sign their culture their country their civilization is coming to an end it's a sign of the end now they're thinking it's wonderful it's great it's magnificent oh my isn't that just loyal now remember I I remind you of what the prophet said in the first quote there that I read that it was Heathen worship we we'll pick up again on another on another question this is a very interesting question here is it wrong to talk about people and their lives or is it considered gossip what is the true definition of Gossip now I won't ask anybody here to raise your hands or even bat your eyes for the next 10 minutes do we talk about people yes we do is there a way to talk about people and their situations with concern and it not being gossip yes it is a preacher sermons are filled with such things Carol and I talk about people every day of our life but not in a way to run them down it's about what they're dealing with in their home cuz our life are our people so it's what they're going through it's the sickness that they're dealing with I was at on the phone yesterday counseling a brother for over an hour here in our church I had about a 30 minute break then I had to receive a phone call from a brother in the UK which considers our church his home Church been been streaming us for 14 years and me his Pastor I was on the phone with him for an hour hour and 20 minutes something like that what will we talking about family issues problems this that the other was I gossiping was he gossiping no we were trying to resolve some of those things listen to the meaning of the word gossip or you can read it gossip casual or unconstrained conversation or reports about other people typically involving details that are not confirmed as being true now that's the meaning of Gossip now it can be like you know rumors and things like that that that happen in in families and and homes and clicks um that can happen in church well have you heard brother so and so done so oh no no if you heard this that the other and a lot of it is absolutely unconfirmed and probably most of us have been as guilty as we can be of spreading things that absolutely were not facts anybody brave enough to raise your hand and say yep been there and done that and yet were we wrong in doing that absolutely we were wrong but is it wrong for us to question and talk you know have you heard brother Jesse is going through a hard time and you know let let's pray for him let's remember him and let's let's just hold our brother up in prayer is that gossip no that's not gossip gossip is you going around hey have you heard the latest on Jesse you know Jesse I mean he's doing this and he's doing that my have you heard and then don't tell nobody that's just between me and you they get on their family chat or their group chat and they tell this one that and the other one but they couldn't remember exactly what you said so then they added this and they left that out and by the time they get done brother Jesse's got 14 girlfriends and three of them you know or just out of state two of them is from another Nation you know how people are they just embellish they add to they take away and the before brother Jesse know people in the church are treating him so odd and he's wondering what in the world is going on and they're thinking I cannot believe they ask him to lead the singing I just I I just I cannot believe it they ask him and you may be sitting there believing a lie against brother Jesse because somebody said something that was not the truth have we all done that oh yeah sure we have I'll go ahead and answer for you yeah brother Donnie we've all done that thank you and is that wrong that's wrong that is absolutely wrong and we shouldn't do it and when I say we I'm talking about from here back watch this in Leviticus 19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a tail Bearer among thy people neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor I am the Lord Proverbs 11:13 a tail Bearer reveales Secrets but he that is of a faithful Spirit con Sealth the matter praise the Lord let me just be honest with you and tell you there are people that have flew here to our state to come and receive counsel from your pastor from all over the world I have been told secrets about people's lives that if I told them it would cause murders it would cause all kinds of things but I want to be a man of a faithful spirit that the kind of Pastor you want would you all want so you come and talk to me about a sin or whatever and and then the next thing you know somebody from my family is telling the thing that you supposedly told me in confidence anybody here want that to happen to you you know what me either so I treat you the way I would want to be treated so if it was in reverse and brother Joe was the pastor and I I wanted to come and said brother Joe I I've done something terrible wrong buddy pray for me please pray for me and then the next time I come to church brother Joe's son comes up and and then brother Joe's close friend I think my goodness and believe it or not I have people from other churches to come and ask counsel and advice and I've heard this over and over again and I always tell them look I don't I don't like talking to people from another church but they said brother Donnie we cannot go to our pastor because our pastor tells his wife everything and then she shares it with her children and we cannot feel comfortable going there that is a shame I said that is a shame so if I or you are telling things spreading things on other people we shouldn't do it it's wrong it displeases the Lord notice in Proverbs 188 the words of a tail bear are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly oh my goodness I have been lied on I've had so many things told on me someone used to come to our church and left several years ago they went about telling on me that I had been married twice now I I'm I'm sure I'm 68 years old and I'm sure that I have forgotten a few things about my life but I honestly don't see how I could have forgotten that especially since I married that woman when I was 16 so I must have been really young when I married the other one now can you imagine why would anybody tell such a thing an outright lie why would they tell it why but in one way I considered an honor that people have to make up things about me I'm grateful that I live that close to God you ought to be grateful you ought to be grateful that they can't go around and say hey you know what I heard I heard brother Donnie's drinking whiskey again oh man I heard it there somebody told a member of our church not long ago that they was going to have to get him a new pastor he said why said well the pastor every time we have a party or something he gets so drunk you know it's it's just really bringing a reproach huh you think you've got to be kidding me so the pastors getting drunk at the church gatherings I can believe it friends I can believe that what an age that we're living in what an age so these are what the words of a tail Bearer do believe me if it was not for the grace of God tonight I could not even stand before you of the things that have been told about me and I'm sure some of you could stand and say brother Donnie I I know a little bit of what you're going through cuz the things that people have said about me and you know what's so hurtful sometimes it's people you go to church with people that you love you say why would they do that why because as Christians were still humans come on now can anybody say Amen the words of a the tail bear are as wounds they go down into the innermost parts of the belly Proverbs 20 and 19 he that goeth about as a tail bear ralth Secrets therefore medle not with him that flattereth with his lips Proverbs 2620 where there I love this it's so simple where no w wood is there the fire goeth out now this is the man of great wisdom but he had some very simple things to say didn't he I mean this takes a rocket scientist to figure this out right where there is no wood your fire is going to go out and he says so where there is no tail Bearer The Strife ceaseth mm right notice this in the church in his condition walk meekly gently humbly gently and the dove will lead you but whenever you go to listening to that gossip whenever you go to getting that temper up when you go to thinking you got a right to do this and do that the dove takes her flight and goes on away I don't know about you I need my Dove every day every hour I don't want to do anything say anything oh my that would make it why because the Holy Spirit does not love and enjoy gossip and talking now let me just give you a little bit of insight about preachers okay as as preachers we talk about things whenever I will meet together with preach preachers and brothers will come through and preach for us and and uh I don't I don't like meeting with them and talking about church issues and church problems I want them to be able to just preach what the Lord puts on their heart and just keep it that way and and I that's the same way I love preaching at churches and I have preached in churches before and Carol's been with me I was at a place a few years ago and I was up preaching and the pastor was glory to God Amen Hallelujah he was up and about all over the floor until I started dealing with some certain things and whenever I did that Pastor sat down and never opened his mouth and I thought rut R Shaggy we're in a mess so I thought oh my goodness after service he come to me and he said I'm sure you noticed I got quiet and I said yes sir I did I said I I hope everything was all right he said brother Donnie he said you repeated some words that I said to a brother day before yesterday he said you also repeated his reply back to me and he said I just knew he was going to know that I had talked to you and told you that we believe the Holy Ghost can do that I guarantee I got an email from one of the sisters of our church not long ago and she Saidi want to know is our church bugged and she had a question mark then she you know put a few dots and then said haha she said me and sister so and so were standing talking the other day and we said such and such and so and so I said this and she said this and she said two Services after that you stood up and repeated the very same words that both of us said I believe the Holy Ghost can still do that don't you absolutely but when preachers will get together and we'll go to talking about this is going on in the message and you know this is going on it's such a delicate thing to where that you're not speaking out of concern and no doubt the men of God in every age has done that to where you cross that line and it's it's like it's an Unwritten line it's an Undeclared boundary that you cross over and you go to entering into gossip you're talking about this one you're talking about that one have y'all ever been there not not his preachers Ju Just his Ley and you get concerned you know have you heard this and this is going oh my you know I hear some of the young Brothers in our church is getting a little bit indifferent and cold y'all never discuss things like that some of our young sisters is that wrong no as long as your motive and your objective is right do what I do whenever I know that I'm going to meet with the brothers and we may go to talk this is what I do Lord Jesus Keep Me sensitive that I'll know if I get close to that boundary to where I I I move across the necessity to discuss this and discuss that and it can lay so close to gossip and talking about this one and running that one down now y'all know what I'm talking about don't you I believe if the Lord Jesus would have his prophet and have this written in the Bible that he would want us to be sensitive enough to where we could walk there is anybody here besides me ever stepped across that line and you give would give anything if you wish should have never said it and it just like you didn't you didn't see it you you wasn't even aware of that you were doing it and you were just talking and all of a sudden you realize you was in an area and you don't know how to get out you can't retract the words that oh Lord speak to us tonight Jesus I believe that's the kind of Christians the Lord wants us to be don't you to where we can be so sensitive in one way I'm glad it didn't give us a book and just say now look you can say this and this and this but don't say that and that and that you understand what he wants us to be young people he wants us he don't just want that for your moms and dads and your grandpas he wants this with you he wants you to be able to walk so close to him that his spirit in you can help you and guard you and even if you start toward that boundary of whatever it is right and wrong about how to dress and how to do this and do that even how to talk and you feel yourself nearing that boundary that you just feel that warning and you just back away oh my that's what kind of Christian I want to be let me let me read this some we'll close that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life I want you to listen how brother brandom identifies a holy life so it's not just long hair it's not just about not wearing makeup and it's not about your sister's not wearing pants and your brother's dressing a certain way and acting you know like that that's it's visible on the outside that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's right make you quit gossiping make you quit playing cards shooting crabs and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit carrying on the way you're doing living untrue to your wife that's what it'll do that's right it'll quit it make you want to marry somebody else's wife oh we've had a few of them in the message ain't we want to marry somebody else's wife that's right it's to make you live a holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is power for so it's to make you quit gossiping to help you to know so out of concern that we talk about this oh my and and brother Joe and I will talk brother Rob and I as the you leaders we'll talk and that brother Donnie would like to talk with you me and brother Rob has met and brother Joel and we've met and they just have something on their heart brother Donnie just want to ask you about this why do you think about that you know you know this what do you think well brothers let's pray about it let's just see it's not that we're running any of you all down it's not that they've come to me to to rad on you and tell on you for doing this it's out of concern I would not want men that would be our youth leaders if if they did not have a burden for your soul would you would you one them that would just let you do whatever and just keep all kinds of things hid and no no that's not the kind of men we want we want men who are burdened but one thing I admire about these brothers let me just give him a rose brother Robin here so his face won't turn red but I I appreciate both of these brothers because not only of having a desire to do something for you but to help light my load as well but both of them want to work within the confines of what they feel like their position is so brother Rob called me not long ago and he and I had a an extended conversation and he didn't want to overstep his position as far as being part of a youth leader he wanted just to be able to work you know where God put them well there's no scripture for a youth leader there's no scriptural qualifications there's no message qualifications for a youth leader search all you want to you're not going to find the word youth leader in the message so if there isn't any in the scripture and there isn't any in the message where are we going to get their guidelines anybody know the answer you'll get it from the head the head so what is the head of the church it ain't the Deacon board it ain't a trustee board who is the head it's a pastor so then the pastor will say look I I think that we need this we need that and then all right Brothers yall work with me and and you try to encourage and and you try to do that this is the example I shared with brother Rob I have a 2016 Buick Enclave check engine lot come on now I've I've done a little bit of mechanic work carolly I had a 1998 o mobile I loaned it to a preacher friend of mine and he never had driven an overdrive a car with overdrive so he just pulled it down in D was what he was used to driving D which I later said was for dumb needless to say so he pulls it down in D he drives it from Kentucky all the way to Delaware turns around drives it back a few days later in D and by the time he gets back it's smoking the transmission will not change gears and he leaves it in my drives away and says thanks so I take it to my uncle them which our mechanics and said what in the world said Donnie your motor and transmission both are burned up so I called this preacher hey message Preacher Man you burn up my motor and transmission ha haa fix it ah message preacher supposed to be full of the Holy Ghost so I go to looking for a motor transmission a contact brother Charlie Cox he found me one over in camville so I go over and pick it up I pull mine in my uncle's garage I pull the motor the transmission out set the other motor transmission anybody here ever pulled a motor or transmission out of a car okay it's it's quite a task is it B Jo it's quite a task to do walls boy of course runs in their family they can do it now there's no way I would try to do that now different year 2024 computer sensors but the Buick check engine light took it to O'Reilly's okay you got an oxygen sensor so it's a certain certain one I get on YouTube I look at it yep I can do this so I go out there I raise the hood I buy the oxygen sensor I do this this this I put it all back together fixed it check engine L comes on my 2016 truck oxygen sensor I thought I can handle this but I find out it's a certain oxygen sensor I realize right quick I'm out of my league so you know what I do take it to Ford so this is the example I tell brother Rob brother Rob God calls a man he gives you certain abilities and capacities so your work was in the confines of that capacity ity never feel like that you cannot admit this is beyond what I can do I need help you know the whole family of God would be so much better off if we all would work right brother Paul with that same mentality sometimes you go through things and you can handle it sometimes you go through other things and it's beyond you and you saying I handled the last time but maybe in this trial God wants you to fulfill the scripture by asking someone else to pray with you and by doing that they will fulfill the scripture that Paul wrote bear ye one another's burdens so it doesn't mean that you're not a great Christian it doesn't mean that you're beyond oh I'm getting weaker and weaker no maybe God wants you to reach out to somebody else and let them help you because three months down the road they're going to be reaching out to you for your help don't you love him tonight with all your heart let's bow our heads brother Jesse you musician Brothers thank you all I don't know if y'all are enjoying these or much I tell you what I I'm so enjoying these these questions I've enjoyed studying them I'm hearing from all over the world I have heard from old people and some real old people I've heard from young people as a matter of fact I heard from an older person not long ago and this was their uh view about the questions they said brother Donnie I hope that questions don't stop till the Rapture I said well I'm afraid they'll have to because they're wearing me out trying to study on them but I have so enjoyed them I hope that've been a blessing to you can we stand together Heavenly Father we count it a great honor and a privilege to speak to your people Lord Jesus as I look across these young people tonight and I think of Carol and I whenever we were going to church and we never had question answers we never had a youth meeting the whole time that we went to our church as a matter of fact they've heard me say it before the first youth meeting I ever attended I preached it what we would have given for the ministry of the church to have focused on us and to let us meet I had so many questions so many questions what I would have given to be able to had answers a lot of the things I've learned I've learned by Fault by mistake by failure it shows what a love that you have for the young people of this age that you would lay it on their hearts dear God of the ministry I'd never even heard a preacher do question and answers until I come to the message and whenever I did it seemed odd it seemed really strange to me that a preacher would have people to write down the questions and this is the way brother Brenham did it that he would have the people to turn it in and he said I I want to look at them and I could take many of these questions off the cuff but they wouldn't have near as many scriptures they wouldn't have near as many quotes they wouldn't have near the history background it takes a lot of time to put it all together and I want them to be so so covered by the answer so it'll help them in life dear Jesus how we thank you for this time together I pray that you'd bless us father we love you so much we look forward to Gathering here again Sunday and we're just asking that you'd visit us in a special way we pray for those from our church that's on vacation I know it's summertime and Lord some Canada some here there there we pray that you'd watch over them some flew out today for Arizona uh just different places that people are on vacation and we pray that you'd be with them Lord and give them a good time a restful time with their family we love you so much bless our youth of leaders father bless our youth groups make them Father to be the youth that you want them to be father we don't just want them to be the Church of tomorrow but we want them to be the Church of today that's why Lord I want to take special services for them and we are so grateful I just can't say it enough Lord I've been over here a lot since we've been in the church since February weeding and putting out stones and doing this and that and the other Lord I I I was just here this this week and as I pulled in through the gate and I pulled in I just said it out loud to you lord I can't believe this is ours I can't believe I can't believe that this is our place I want to thank you I want to thank you I would have never thought we would have had such a place and it's evident it's not just for us how many other people have been blessed by youth services and special meetings we're thankful for it Lord Even in our youth services youth from Virginia and youth from North Carolina and youth from Ohio and different places I've heard from pastors I've heard from associate ministers that's let their youth group come and be in this meetings they've thanked me over and over again and and they say that their youths have been so blessed we are so grateful Lord thank you so much for letting us have this place we are grateful I pray that it'll never become common to us Lord Jesus I know if time terries either I'll go by the way of the Grave or I'll get so old that I can't preach no more but dear God if that so then I believe there's youth sitting here and they'll they'll be the song leaders and they'll be the elders in the church in that day so I've tried to make something Lord that if time goes on to where that the truth will stand and they'll have a place to be able to bring them Lord may it stand as a testimony for your great power father we pray in Jesus name amen bless you brother love you bu I want to be more like you Jesus i w to be more like you I want to be a vessel that you were I be more you thank you Lord oh I want to be more like you Jes Jesus I want to be more like [Music] you I want to beess that you are through I want to be more like you oh I want to be more like you Jesus CU I want to be more

never [Music] again your your love [Music] might Jesus you I just be [Music] you in amen you enjoy that tonight I was sitting there thinking you know brother brother Donnie was both those questions you know you through all since we've started this you know me and brother Rob have talked a lot about you know what the question of an question and answers means to us but sometimes we Overlook the fact that as many questions as y'all have turned in it's your your desire to be right when you send in a question that's that's what I'm starting to learn about you is that we have a group of young people that want to be right and brings the questions you know and some of the questions that you might he that brother Donnie goes over and you listen to those questions you think I have no problem with that that's something simple I don't understand but if you understand when you listen to the detail of what brother Donnie brings it out how much time and study and prayer that he puts into one simple question because he wants you to be right too and he wants the leadership of the Lord and I I appreciate that and I was I saw a video the other day I told Brother Rob I saw a video the other day and the video was shows these sheep going on a road just a big long line of sheep and there's one dog behind them and that dog is Behind These sheep and these sheep some of these sheep would get off to the side of the road they wouldn't get off the road but they would get on the side of the road and as soon as they got on the side of the road that dog would run up there and heard them dogs back them sheep back to the middle and the title of that was Pastor that's all it said it just said pastor this pastor wasn't hurting sheep that fell by the wayside it was hurting sheep that was still on the road that we're getting to the edge of the road cuz that's where we want to be we want to be in the middle and and the fact you know we's talking about you know gossiping and talking to one another and stuff good sheep will help a pastor out when Trouble Comes when things them sheep will Bunch together they'll get together and they'll pull together there's nothing better than having a group of Holy Ghost filled friends that you can take your burdens to and have them pray and and not worry they're going to go tell somebody else you know be the friend that talks to God like the four friends like we we said a couple weeks ago have four friends that do anything they can to get you to Jesus so I appreciate that brother Donnie I I really appreciate that if y'all just be mindful in prayer we we have our U we've set some dates for our next youth service so be pray praying about that um have brother Nathan Ericson coming I'm sure he'll desire your prayers um but that's September 13th 14th and um we'll be doing stuff that weekend so um y'all is what makes y'all what makes the meeting so um we we love doing it for you so um just be in prayer for that and if you have any more questions he's he's still the pastor I guess as long as he's here we'll give him to him we've already told him that he'll have to tell us when to quit if he won't then we'll have to ask sister Carol when he's ready to sit down so but we've enjoyed him we just don't want we don't want to wear him out so um appreciate y'all um sisters wanted me to tell y'all there's sandwiches and plastic bags over
