[33:39] one of them aren't you glad you ain't
[33:41] one of
[33:43] them I know people think it's small it's
[33:46] inferior when I was in China several
[33:48] years ago and preaching in those
[33:50] meetings there there were professors
[33:53] School teachers people of every
[33:56] occupation that you you can imagine and
[33:58] the type that the communist government
[34:01] thought would not search for
[34:04] God if you can educate them and give
[34:06] them this and that then that'll do away
[34:08] with the need of God yeah but I sat
[34:12] there and looked at them people and I
[34:13] thought there was still something in
[34:15] them even though they were professors
[34:17] teachers mathematicians and all of that
[34:21] but you can't satisfy the soul with mass
[34:25] amen you can't satis y it with algebra
[34:28] you can't satisfy it with money it's
[34:31] made to search for
[34:33] God when it's all said and done
[34:36] friends and when our heart is slowing
[34:39] down the blood pressure is
[34:42] dropping and we get ready to cross over
[34:46] all you own won't amount to

[36:17] church because Jesus uses a particular
[36:21] type of material and this is the way
[36:25] you'll always know that Jesus founded
[36:28] whatever Church you're going to whatever
[36:30] one you're looking at or fellowshipping
[36:32] or whatever the traits of the Builder
[36:36] will be in there and you'll be able to
[36:39] identify it by its characteristics its
[36:40] traits its foundation and the building
[36:43] material that is used this is it Upon
[36:48] This
[36:49] Rock I will build my church so what was
[36:54] the rock of course The Rock was
[36:57] Revelation revelation of who he
[37:01] is not who he
[37:05] was so the churches of this day that are
[37:08] built by Jesus himself will be focusing
[37:12] on who and what he is in
[37:14] 2023 and shortly 2024 right so if
[37:19] they're built upon a memory of what he
[37:21] was 2,000 years
[37:23] ago that's not a church that Jesus Built
[37:26] right
[37:27] amen cuz Upon This Rock he said I will
[37:30] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[37:32] shall not Prevail against it acts 15
[37:37] verse1 now some traits and
[37:40] characteristics of this church now a few
[37:42] years after Jesus starts
[37:45] building and certain men which came down
[37:48] from Judea taught the Brethren and said
[37:51] except you be
[37:53] circumcised after the manner of Moses
[37:56] you
[37:57] cannot be
[37:59] saved now notice certain men don't call
[38:03] them Brethren just calls them
[38:06] men certain men came down from Judea and
[38:09] taught the
[38:11] Brethren yeah so here was some men that
[38:15] were not
[38:16] Brethren but they were teaching the
[38:19] Brethren how in the world did that
[38:24] happen so you got man that's not even
[38:27] born
[38:28] again and somehow the Brethren let them
[38:32] among them and start teaching
[38:37] them wow that ought to be a double
[38:41] wow we ought to take
[38:45] warning an't that amazing certain men
[38:48] which came down from Judea taught the
[38:50] Brethren and said except you speak in
[38:54] tongues you ain't got to hold holy ghost
[38:58] or except you run and Shout you're not
[38:59] the bride I see then it was
[39:02] circumcision but it's changed in every
[39:05] age and it's happening in our ranks as
[39:08] well that we're making new
[39:11] evidences of what the bride is we've had
[39:14] so many bride revivals I can't even keep
[39:17] up with
[39:18] them but let me tell you what the bride
[39:20] Revival won't be the bride's Revival
[39:24] will not be hacking and splicing and
[39:27] cutting the word or the message and
[39:30] putting it together to fit your idea it
[39:33] won't be
[39:37] that now of course they were saying this
[39:39] because this was such an important thing
[39:41] in that day and this day we don't even
[39:43] think nothing about it so the evidence
[39:45] will change but that Spirit never
[39:47] changed except you be circumcised after
[39:50] the manner of Moses you cannot be saved
[39:53] when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no
[39:56] SM
[39:59] small no small
[40:03] dissension and
[40:06] disputation with
[40:07] them
[40:09] wow so Paul and Barnabas had no small
[40:13] dissension and disputation with them
[40:16] they determined that Paul and Barnabas
[40:18] and certain other of them should go up
[40:21] to
[40:22] Jerusalem unto the apostles
[40:27] and
[40:28] Elders about this
[40:31] question now you see because the
[40:33] scarecrow has been so effective for
[40:37] thousands of years if we would try to do
[40:40] this today in our message people would
[40:43] start screaming denomination
[40:45] denomination denomination you know why
[40:48] the scarecrow has started scaring
[40:53] Eagles now this is the way the original
[40:56] Church
[40:58] operated and the devil put up a
[41:00] scarecrow of the name of denomination
[41:03] and they started pulling some of these
[41:05] things out of there and Satan knew it
[41:07] would scare the elect from the 3 Century
[41:11] right on down and it still scared them
[41:14] notice in verse three and being brought
[41:16] on their way by the church they passed
[41:18] through Phoenicia and Samaria declaring
[41:20] the conversion of the Gentiles and they
[41:22] caused Great Joy unto all the Brethren
[41:25] and when they were come to Jerusalem
[41:27] they were received of the church and of
[41:31] the Apostles and Elders wow Paul the
[41:36] prophet a church AG
[41:39] messenger had to be received by the
[41:42] church and by the apostles and the
[41:45] elders oh why didn't he get this
[41:46] attitude I don't care if y'all don't
[41:48] think I'm of God or not glory to God go
[41:51] on to
[41:53] Hell well that's the attitude a lot of
[41:55] the men message folks
[41:57] have I did say message
[42:00] folks not real Believers you see real
[42:04] message Believers know that brother
[42:06] bram's message is not something new on
[42:12] now it's a restoration to the original
[42:16] amen now you see a lot of message people
[42:18] do not believe that they can never
[42:21] believe a lot of the doctrines they do
[42:23] they could never stay home play tapes
[42:25] don't need preachers no more all that
[42:26] the reason they believe that is because
[42:29] they believe this message is something
[42:32] totally
[42:35] new and if you believe that tonight I
[42:39] pray to God you get the Holy Ghost
[42:41] before you leave this service cuz you
[42:43] ain't got it
[42:44] now cuz the Holy Ghost will never lead
[42:47] you to believe a
[42:50] lie because the prophet messenger come
[42:52] to return the hearts of the children
[42:54] back to the apostolic
[42:56] fathers and the church
[43:00] said and they declared all sa that God
[43:04] had done for
[43:06] them I me like to be remembered tonight
[43:08] as we
[43:10] pray sister Wendy Asher has an aunt that
[43:13] has a real need and they want this

[44:34] and we believe you father that you're
[44:37] going to move for dear God we desire to
[44:40] be with all of our hearts one of those
[44:43] churches that has been turned back to
[44:46] the apostolic faith help us I pray Lord
[44:50] God In The Name of Jesus
[44:53] Christ and the church said amen God
[44:56] bless you you may be
[44:59] seated now I'm sure that you all believe
[45:02] already tonight that just because people
[45:05] say they are
[45:08] Apostolic does not mean that they are
[45:12] the original
[45:14] Apostolic anybody here ever belong to
[45:17] the
[45:18] UPC Church of God in Christ few of you
[45:21] Church of God in Christ one is Church of
[45:23] God the black side of that UPC thing
[45:27] probably nobody many of them claim to be
[45:31] Apostolic but basically what they preach
[45:35] is one God and they don't even have it
[45:38] correct and water baptism in the name of
[45:42] the Lord Jesus I was at a funeral some
[45:44] time ago of an Apostolic man a family
[45:47] member close to someone of mine and the
[45:50] preacher which was Apostolic of course
[45:52] got up and every way that he could he
[45:56] tried to bring in Acts 238 and uh
[45:59] speaking in tongues evidence of the Holy
[46:02] Ghost speaking in tongues and preaching
[46:05] this guy's funeral but also trying to
[46:09] get forth his Apostolic Doctrine now
[46:12] many of those Apostolic preachers they
[46:15] they are specifically known for acts
[46:20] 238 and a lot of them turn into
[46:23] preachers that carry an Acts and
[46:27] 238s so that's all they know how to do
[46:31] with that scripture is fight with it and
[46:34] they will fight you and they will get
[46:36] angry and they will get upset and they
[46:40] have no mercy whatsoever for someone
[46:42] that maybe God has never opened their
[46:44] understanding to that so they take their
[46:47] Axe and cut their heads off and if
[46:49] there's anything left they pull out both
[46:50] 38s and finish them off with that and as
[46:53] I sat there listening to that man's
[46:54] funeral and I thought
[46:56] you know I knew the man well and knew
[46:58] the man was a good man loved God with
[47:00] all of his heart but yet this preacher
[47:02] saw it as an opportunity to be able to
[47:06] convey once again their so-called
[47:09] Apostolic Doctrine but I had talked to
[47:12] some of those people years before about
[47:14] the message ah mentioned predestination
[47:19] serpent SE some of the different
[47:21] doctrines that we know the apostles
[47:25] actually
[47:26] preached and what I found was that those
[47:29] Apostolic people wasn't Apostolic at all
[47:34] they were Apostolic
[47:36] denomination so because they baptized in
[47:39] jesus' name and because they preach the
[47:42] tongues as the evidence of the Holy
[47:44] Ghost and you shout and this and that
[47:46] then you're true Apostolic no you're
[47:49] just Apostolic by name but there is a
[47:54] true Apostolic people on the face of the
[47:58] Earth
[47:59] today so true Apostolic people are built
[48:03] upon the doctrine of the Apostles and
[48:08] Prophets so the true Apostolic people
[48:11] are those that can tie their original
[48:15] Roots back to the church in the book of
[48:18] Acts which was what Jesus started
[48:21] himself now Jesus said himself on this
[48:24] rock I will build my church now it may
[48:28] be kind of offensive a little bit but as
[48:31] I said earlier every church that's built
[48:34] on every Church Corner between here and
[48:36] Memphis and back is not built by the
[48:39] Lord Jesus because Jesus could go in
[48:42] there and start just preaching a little
[48:45] bit about his word we'll say he would
[48:49] start in the Book of John and he might
[48:52] say something like this in the beginning
[48:55] was the word and the Word was with God
[48:58] and the Word was God and many might come
[49:01] on down to verse 14 and say and the Word
[49:03] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[49:06] beheld his glory as of the only begotten
[49:09] of the father full of grace and truth
[49:12] some of them might make it to the end of
[49:13] that and say amen and then we might
[49:17] bring Jesus over to St John 10 when
[49:20] Jesus would say I and my father are one
[49:24] amen we might bring him over to where
[49:27] Phillip said so Lord show us the father
[49:31] and he said Phillip have I been with you
[49:34] so long and you don't know who I am if
[49:38] you see me you see the father well right
[49:42] there a bunch of the trinitarians would
[49:44] fall out of their Pew would they and yet
[49:47] they claim to be following Jesus well
[49:49] Jesus was actually the one who said that
[49:53] and then we come over to the first
[49:54] church AG messenger that was the
[49:57] foundation stone that God began to build
[49:59] a lot of these Revelations on what he
[50:02] gave him and he would say something like
[50:04] this for without controversy great is
[50:07] the mystery of godliness for God was
[50:11] manifest In the Flesh just in the
[50:13] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[50:16] preached unto the Gentiles who did
[50:20] God God then we might come to the book
[50:23] of Titus where he said Hing to and the
[50:27] coming of the day of God in that day
[50:30] when the Lord Jesus will come himself
[50:33] you mean calling Jesus God not one of
[50:37] them but him Jesus wasn't one of the
[50:41] Gods in heaven he was the only one and
[50:44] we might move over to the Book of
[50:46] Revelation when John was carried up and
[50:48] he said I saw one and I saw a throne not
[50:53] three but I saw one throne
[50:56] and he that sat upon the throne was to
[50:58] look upon as a Jasper and a Sardis Stone
[51:01] which was the birth stones of the tribes
[51:05] of Israel so I wonder how many churches
[51:09] in the tri cities that the Lord Jesus
[51:12] would Acclaim that he himself started
[51:16] that church and it would be
[51:19] identification that all would know
[51:22] because the building material that
[51:24] church is built upon so it's built upon
[51:28] the Revelation then of who Jesus is in
[51:32] this age and yet many of them will take
[51:34] people down to the water and they'll say
[51:37] in obedience to the Commandment of the
[51:39] Lord Jesus I baptize you in the name of
[51:42] the father and the Son and the Holy
[51:43] Ghost so in other words you spiritually
[51:46] baptize them into the Catholic
[51:50] Church well glory to God I thought y'all
[51:52] was Apostolic here tonight so I wonder
[51:56] then how many of them that Jesus would
[51:58] stand up and say I did not build my
[52:01] church upon the teaching that speaking
[52:05] in tongues was the evidence of the Holy
[52:07] Ghost well there'd be some more that'd
[52:09] get mad at Jesus and then others that
[52:12] would say well you know I I believe once
[52:14] in Grace always in Grace and once you
[52:17] get saved as a matter of fact this I was
[52:20] going hunting this last week and on and
[52:22] one of the brothers just telling me that
[52:24] he had Hunted been around a guy up there
[52:26] where we were some time before this and
[52:29] the guy was cussing I mean cussing
[52:31] everything off the hinges and the
[52:32] brother asked him he said uh what do you
[52:34] do he said I'm a licensed ordained
[52:41] minister oh my goodness so I doubt Jesus
[52:45] would want to put his arm around that
[52:46] dude and call him buddy wouldn't you so
[52:49] you can imagine then one church after
[52:52] another after another the Lord Jesus J
[52:55] would say you are not
[52:58] mine I never built this church as a
[53:01] matter of fact this one was built by
[53:04] this organization or this man or this or
[53:06] that or the other this is not even my
[53:09] church my name is not here my Revelation
[53:13] is not what built you it was built out
[53:15] of Envy or Strife or whatever more this
[53:19] is not my church it's going to be
[53:20] surprising when we get to the end of the
[53:22] way and a lot of people stand before the
[53:25] Lord and they will stand there sinking
[53:27] you know that I've done this and that
[53:29] and the other and the Lord Jesus will
[53:32] look at them and I know some of the
[53:33] brothers right now don't like it
[53:35] whenever preachers will still preach on
[53:37] Matthew 24:24 but I've got to because
[53:40] I'm a Full Gospel preacher and I believe
[53:43] in healings and signs and wonders and
[53:45] miracles but by no means do I believe
[53:49] that the bride's only identification is
[53:52] the miraculous because there's going to
[53:54] be all kinds of people that's going to
[53:56] stand before the Lord and say we cast
[53:59] out Devils we raise the Dead We heal the
[54:01] sick in your name come on church and
[54:04] they will absolutely be anointed I heard
[54:07] the prophet say it today it is the true
[54:10] anointing of the Holy Ghost but they are
[54:14] anointed
[54:16] falsely to the
[54:18] word so you mean the spirit of God would
[54:21] come upon people and anoint them fall ly
[54:25] to the word so you don't judge them by
[54:27] their signs or their miracles or how
[54:30] much they jump or dance or shout but
[54:32] what you judge them by is the word that
[54:35] includes me that includes every other
[54:37] preacher that includes every one of us
[54:41] and the church said am so the church
[54:44] then that Jesus is going to come for in
[54:47] the last days is going to be an
[54:50] Apostolic Bible believing church now
[54:54] keep in mind that God did not send
[54:56] brother brandom in order to replace our
[54:58] Bible but to make our Bible more real to
[55:02] us is that right is that the way you
[55:04] believe it and understand it so he did
[55:07] not come to sim brother brandom so that
[55:09] people would formulate their doctrines
[55:12] outside of the context of scripture and
[55:14] they would come up with all kinds of
[55:16] strange ideas which of course is going
[55:19] to be in every age but he would come
[55:21] right back cuz when he would be on the
[55:22] curtain of time and he saw his people
[55:25] only didn't see Paul's did not see
[55:27] Luther's did not see Wesley's but he saw
[55:30] his only and whenever he reconciled and
[55:32] he told the angel said if Paul's group
[55:34] goes in mine will and then those
[55:37] thousands I heard him say it today that
[55:39] there was hundreds of thousands of those
[55:41] people looked like there could have been
[55:43] millions that was there and they
[55:45] screamed out we are resting on that and
[55:48] they said one day Jesus will come to you
[55:51] and you will be judged and if you are
[55:54] accepted and you will be then we will go
[55:57] in on your teaching so that would be
[56:00] totally impossible for us to go in on
[56:02] brother brandom's teaching unless he was
[56:04] a word Prophet praise the Lord so Paul
[56:08] didn't say one thing and brother Ram say
[56:09] something else now he might have said it
[56:11] in a Kentucky way where Paul said it in
[56:14] his way but it's still the word of God
[56:17] now whatever the Lord started forming
[56:20] this church he knew of course that there
[56:21] would be Seven Ages it would be spread
[56:24] over seven dispensations and there would
[56:26] be seven manifestations of the spirit of
[56:29] God in the Book of Revelation it would
[56:31] be called the seven spirits of God but
[56:33] it would be seven manifestations of the
[56:35] same spirit of God each one of them
[56:38] would be represented by a horn on the
[56:41] Beast and then there would be an eye in
[56:44] the horn now these were actually the
[56:47] horns were the power on the earth which
[56:50] protected the Lamb's rights so in the
[56:53] first church age there was a horn which
[56:56] was under the lion anointing and there
[56:58] was an eye in the horn oh you're trying
[57:01] to get deep brother Donnie no I'm not I
[57:03] just want you to know where you're
[57:04] identified and where every age has been
[57:07] so a horn come up on there and that was
[57:10] the church that was the true Acts 2
[57:13] church then in that horn was an eye so
[57:16] the eye represented the sear or the
[57:19] dispensation of light that was given to
[57:21] them so he saw seven horns and then he
[57:25] saw seven eyes an eye in each horn so it
[57:28] was the messenger of that age so the eye
[57:31] of the age catches the mind of God looks
[57:33] into the script of God catches the word
[57:37] of the day pulls it down into the horn
[57:41] and then the horn gets under the
[57:43] manifestation of that word you following
[57:45] me of what their word is for their day
[57:48] cuz we didn't know what our word was the
[57:50] Ephesian people didn't know what their
[57:52] word was the Samarian people pergamos
[57:55] saus Sardis Philadelphia and leoda we
[57:58] didn't know what our word was and every
[58:01] Church age message if you notice in the
[58:03] Book of Revelation unto the angel of the
[58:06] Church of Ephesus write notice who the
[58:09] letter is addressed to it's not
[58:12] addressed to the denominational
[58:16] headquarters it's not sent to a bunch of
[58:19] Bishops that's going to tell everybody
[58:20] what they can do and cannot do come on
[58:23] church say Amen but who is the letter
[58:26] sent to it is sent to the church M
[58:29] messenger the angel of God of that day
[58:32] he is the eye on the horn so the eye
[58:36] gets the message direct from God then
[58:38] the eye comes right down and projects it
[58:41] down to the horn and then the horn
[58:44] protects the Lamb's rights in that day
[58:47] now we're talking about the bride's
[58:49] rights but also the Lamb of God has
[58:52] rights this is one thing we're called to
[58:55] do we're not called to be passive we're
[58:58] not called to let the world do whatever
[59:00] they want to do and people just say
[59:02] whatever they want to say and let's just
[59:04] s around and hold our peace and and be
[59:06] real quiet Paul didn't believe that Paul
[59:08] and Barnabas did not have no small
[59:11] dissension and disputation with those
[59:14] that was teaching contrary to the word
[59:16] of God they confronted them and said
[59:18] you're not saying the
[59:19] truth well come on now children this is
[59:23] what we are called to do we are called
[59:26] to protect the Lamb's rights in this
[59:29] leot to sin age now everybody in this
[59:32] age one of the most important things to
[59:34] them is what their rights so the gay
[59:37] rights and the you know this rights and
[59:39] that's right well that's fine if that's
[59:41] what they want to do but the Lamb of God
[59:43] also has rights he has a right to have a
[59:46] church he has a right to have a church
[59:48] filled with the Holy Ghost a church
[59:50] built upon the doctrine of the Apostles
[59:53] and Prophets is that right and he's not
[59:55] going to send Gabriel down to protect
[59:58] those rights but he's going to have men
[1:00:00] of God under the same anointing that the
[1:00:03] eye brought it I don't want to just
[1:00:06] repeat what brother random said I don't
[1:00:08] want to just repeat it like a tap
[1:00:10] recorder but I want to have the same
[1:00:12] spirit of God he had I want to operate
[1:00:16] under the same thing that's what I love
[1:00:17] when he writes it down pick up your pen
[1:00:19] and write in the spoken words original
[1:00:21] see that the bride not only has the word
[1:00:25] but she has the mind of Christ to know
[1:00:28] what he wants done with the word it's
[1:00:32] evident friends a lot of churches and a
[1:00:34] lot of preachers around this message are
[1:00:36] missing the mind of Christ notice the
[1:00:38] seven seal he said whenever the mind of
[1:00:41] Christ comes in that is the supernatural
[1:00:44] element so people can come to the
[1:00:47] message but it does not mean they get
[1:00:50] the immediate oh my the immediate
[1:00:52] deposit of the mind of Christ just when
[1:00:55] you hand them a book if they do not have
[1:00:57] the mind of Christ they'll never know
[1:01:00] what God wants done by that
[1:01:02] word but if you receive the mind of
[1:01:05] Christ with the message itself then you
[1:01:08] know what he wants done it's evident
[1:01:10] some folks still don't know what he
[1:01:11] wants done they think he wants us to
[1:01:13] argue and debate and make this little
[1:01:16] kingdom and that little kingdom that's
[1:01:18] not what he wants done with the word he
[1:01:20] wants us as preachers to preach the word
[1:01:23] and produce word first and Obey them
[1:01:26] scriptures lay hands on the sick I know
[1:01:28] some of the preachers in the message
[1:01:29] they're fighting laying hands on the
[1:01:31] sick and they say we're Beyond it we
[1:01:33] don't need it no more I'll guarantee you
[1:01:36] one thing we've still got a lot of sick
[1:01:37] folks around here and I'm going to still
[1:01:40] keep on go brother Donnie brother
[1:01:41] brandom got to a place he never had no
[1:01:44] more Visions I want you to show me that
[1:01:46] in the message I'll tell you when
[1:01:47] brother brandom stop having visions when
[1:01:49] he move into the other dimension you
[1:01:52] want to tell me the prophet stopped
[1:01:53] praying for people people and the
[1:01:55] prophet start having prayer line I want
[1:01:57] you to show me that where he said that
[1:01:59] himself what did he do he was still
[1:02:01] ministering to the body right before he
[1:02:04] left the Earth and that's what every
[1:02:07] godall man is called to do cast out
[1:02:10] Devils lay hands on the sick praise the
[1:02:16] Lord now notice if here in the chapter
[1:02:19] 15 again verse 5 but there arose up a
[1:02:23] certain
[1:02:27] set
[1:02:29] wow of the
[1:02:32] Pharisees which
[1:02:40] believed wow so you mean they still kept
[1:02:43] their old
[1:02:46] name on
[1:02:48] Pharisees that
[1:02:51] believed I guess my question would be
[1:02:54] believed
[1:02:57] what how could you be a believer and
[1:03:00] still want to be called a Pharisee or a
[1:03:04] sad you see I think some of y'all are
[1:03:07] sad
[1:03:10] you that it was needful to circumcise
[1:03:14] them how could they
[1:03:18] believe how could they be word born
[1:03:21] Christians and still believe you had to
[1:03:24] be circumcised In the Flesh they had no
[1:03:26] Revelation that the Holy Ghost was the
[1:03:30] tool of circumcision in the New
[1:03:32] Testament they had no idea it was still
[1:03:35] to do with this right
[1:03:39] here amen that it was needful to
[1:03:43] circumcise them and to command them to
[1:03:48] keep the law of
[1:03:49] Moses and the apostles and the elders
[1:03:52] came together for to consider of this
[1:03:57] matter now notice they did not consider
[1:04:01] it denominational at
[1:04:03] all when questions raised up for the
[1:04:07] preachers to get together and try to
[1:04:09] resolve some of these
[1:04:13] issues come on wonder why that's so
[1:04:15] foreign to us come on now wonder why
[1:04:18] that's so strange and we're Apostolic
[1:04:20] are we really I
[1:04:23] wonder I wonder how many Apostolic
[1:04:25] churches we actually have in the message
[1:04:27] we have a lot of message churches but I
[1:04:30] wonder if they're Apostolic message
[1:04:34] churches you hear what some of them is
[1:04:36] preaching you can understand they're a
[1:04:38] long way from the doctrine of the
[1:04:39] Apostles verse
[1:04:41] 22 then pleased it the
[1:04:45] apostles and
[1:04:47] Elders with the whole
[1:04:50] church to send chosen men
[1:04:54] of their own
[1:04:58] company to
[1:05:00] Antioch with Paul and
[1:05:04] Barnabas wow so what if we hear there's
[1:05:07] some kind of Doctrine that's broke out
[1:05:10] wherever and then some of the brothers
[1:05:12] get together and say you know what we we
[1:05:14] all need to go to timbuck two we'll say
[1:05:17] we need to make a trip to timbuck too
[1:05:19] and we need to straighten out some of
[1:05:21] stuff cuz this is going to affect us all
[1:05:24] boy can you imagine what some of the
[1:05:26] message people say Lord have mercy
[1:05:29] brother Donnie and brother Daryl and
[1:05:31] Brother David S or this
[1:05:34] brother they're going to 10 Buck too and
[1:05:38] they told me that they're going over
[1:05:39] there to straighten out a bunch of stuff
[1:05:41] who in the world they think they are
[1:05:43] Lord we're going into
[1:05:47] denomination that's the way they done
[1:05:49] they did in the
[1:05:53] Bible you know what I just realized I'm
[1:05:55] I'm I might I might be in the wrong
[1:05:57] church tonight I mean I'm preaching to
[1:05:59] people that look just like you two weeks
[1:06:01] ago the last time I preached But now
[1:06:03] y'all are looking at me like you don't
[1:06:04] know
[1:06:05] me come on brother oh my
[1:06:10] goodness so they send these people now
[1:06:13] with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas her
[1:06:16] name barabus and Silas Chief men among
[1:06:20] the
[1:06:21] Brethren and they wrote Letters by them
[1:06:24] after this matter the apostles and
[1:06:26] elders and
[1:06:29] Brethren send greetings unto the
[1:06:31] Brethren which are in the Gentiles and
[1:06:33] Antioch and Syria and cissa for as much
[1:06:37] as we have heard that
[1:06:40] certain which went out from
[1:06:44] us
[1:06:47] on now they went out from them but they
[1:06:51] went out without
[1:07:00] Authority you see this is the way God
[1:07:03] wanted to control Division and
[1:07:07] contention I wonder how many them guys
[1:07:11] when they heard Paul was in town shook
[1:07:14] like a leaf and the fall winds
[1:07:17] blowing they said Lord have mercy he's
[1:07:19] here oh good gracious I didn't
[1:07:22] realize h
[1:07:25] why because Paul said you think I've got
[1:07:28] this attitude they say oh his words are
[1:07:31] powerful but he's puny as we saying his
[1:07:33] body he said let him know that these
[1:07:35] same words I write when I get there I
[1:07:38] will have the same
[1:07:41] attitude
[1:07:43] sir you see that would have kind of
[1:07:45] helped Squatch down a lot of false
[1:07:48] Doctrine and a lot of false teachers why
[1:07:52] is it that all these things are breaking
[1:07:54] out around the world you know because
[1:07:56] the greatest most powerful Nation
[1:07:58] so-called in the world has a weak
[1:08:02] leader and Satan waits for weakness as
[1:08:06] Nations wait for
[1:08:09] weakness now watch for as much as we
[1:08:12] have heard that certain which went out
[1:08:14] from us have troubled you with words so
[1:08:18] they actually came out from under the
[1:08:21] apostles and the elders and then they
[1:08:24] started troubling the people sewing
[1:08:27] Discord and false Doctrine and whatever
[1:08:29] more uh with the word subverting your
[1:08:32] souls
[1:08:34] subverting
[1:08:36] subverting your souls and saying that's
[1:08:39] what it said today oh well you know we
[1:08:42] really think it's not
[1:08:44] necessary to no longer quote the prophet
[1:08:47] well of course we believe the message in
[1:08:50] secret but you know I I'm kind of
[1:08:52] thinking that maybe maybe we should
[1:08:55] start a TV program or something like
[1:08:57] that not against anybody wants to do all
[1:08:58] that sort of
[1:08:59] thing but you know if if we're going to
[1:09:02] have a TV broadcast and maybe a radio
[1:09:04] broadcast and we're going to do this and
[1:09:06] other or maybe we're going to do a lot
[1:09:08] of Outreach meetings well that's good
[1:09:09] nothing wrong with that either unless of
[1:09:11] course you have to compromise What You
[1:09:13] Preach well since we're going to do that
[1:09:16] it wouldn't be fitting to you know to
[1:09:18] mention anything
[1:09:20] about so I won't say it but you all will
[1:09:27] understand so from this point on I won't
[1:09:29] say seventh
[1:09:32] angel or any preachers that come into
[1:09:35] our church I'll mention to them and ask
[1:09:36] them not to read quotes
[1:09:45] of
[1:09:47] subverting their
[1:09:50] souls so you understand what some
[1:09:52] preachers now begin to do
[1:09:54] they began to cut off the
[1:09:58] light they're supposed to filter down
[1:10:01] into the soul of the
[1:10:04] horn the
[1:10:06] body the body is supposed to absorb the
[1:10:10] light as it comes through the eye and
[1:10:12] the revelation of the hour it sets their
[1:10:14] soul on fire by that
[1:10:17] word but of course if you become
[1:10:21] ashamed you think it was just a mistake
[1:10:23] to Paul wrote to Timothy and said don't
[1:10:26] be ashamed of me as his
[1:10:29] messenger there must have been something
[1:10:31] already moving among them what do we
[1:10:33] have to actually get up and say Paul I
[1:10:36] mean really he's got a pretty bad record
[1:10:38] you know this guy was a
[1:10:40] murderer can you imagine in that day now
[1:10:42] of course we pick up our Bible today and
[1:10:44] we read it as a holy word of God but in
[1:10:47] that day it was simply books or letters
[1:10:50] written by this man that was so strange
[1:10:52] and bizarre that he said he was carried
[1:10:54] up to the third heaven whoever heard of
[1:10:56] such a thing and he said women couldn't
[1:10:59] even preach my Lord what in the world's
[1:11:02] a matter with him and he even wrote In
[1:11:04] the book of Romans that men were
[1:11:06] sleeping with men and women sleeping
[1:11:09] with women and he said those that do it
[1:11:11] are worthy of
[1:11:14] damnation and I say the same
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:22] thing
[1:11:26] I heard some of the guys up in the lodge
[1:11:28] where we were staying out in the hunting
[1:11:29] trip talking about a gay Pastor I
[1:11:32] thought oh my Lord make me sick at my
[1:11:36] stomach gay
[1:11:39] Pastor can you
[1:11:41] imagine can you imagine a man being that
[1:11:44] blind can you imagine people being so
[1:11:46] foolish they would set under
[1:11:49] such when God's word will condemn them
[1:11:54] oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:11:56] minute I must have got a little raise of
[1:11:58] that light it come down on me and hit me
[1:12:00] and made me kind of Li you like or
[1:12:02] something kind of rough let me let me
[1:12:05] let me cut off that light and say
[1:12:10] oh how is
[1:12:14] everybody this is the greatest day of
[1:12:16] your
[1:12:21] life oh boy come on now some of you that
[1:12:24] would feed on that
[1:12:26] slop that's all it is slop fit for
[1:12:36] Hogs I want you to notice how that Luke
[1:12:38] whenever he writes this in chapter 15:
[1:12:41] 24 it said for as much as we have heard
[1:12:43] that certain went out from us now you
[1:12:46] see they were not
[1:12:49] sent they just
[1:12:52] went
[1:12:54] amen it seemed good unto us being
[1:12:58] assembled with one Accord well that's a
[1:13:01] miracle within itself ain't
[1:13:04] it to send chosen men unto you as our
[1:13:08] beloved Barnabas and Paul men that have
[1:13:12] hazarded their lives for the name of our
[1:13:15] Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore
[1:13:19] Judas not his scar it now Judas and isus
[1:13:24] who shall also tell you the same things
[1:13:27] by mouth so now they notice the
[1:13:30] difference between these men and the
[1:13:33] others the others went but weren't sent
[1:13:37] these went but were set the others
[1:13:41] didn't have a message that coincided
[1:13:44] with what the apostles was preaching but
[1:13:46] these were the voices echoing the truth
[1:13:50] of what the apostles said now they
[1:13:53] didn't just send Paul and Barnabas but
[1:13:55] they sent these other brothers who had
[1:13:57] been around even longer you see friend a
[1:13:59] lot of the thing that Satan has wanted
[1:14:01] to do is to try to corrupt us away from
[1:14:05] this original Apostolic order and it
[1:14:08] gives him more Liberty to do whatever he
[1:14:11] wants to do all people have to say is
[1:14:15] they feel
[1:14:18] led I challenge any person here any
[1:14:20] person listen to me tonight around the
[1:14:22] world
[1:14:24] I challenge any
[1:14:26] preacher to show me where the words feel
[1:14:32] led all right in the book of Acts where
[1:14:35] any preacher felt led to go do this or
[1:14:39] do that or the other contrary to God's
[1:14:45] scripture I'll be
[1:14:47] waiting but I ain't going to stop
[1:14:48] preaching till I get it I'm just going
[1:14:50] to go and preach now notice we have
[1:14:54] sent ah so you mean the church
[1:14:59] sent
[1:15:02] wow hope it's hard for me to say this
[1:15:04] brother Joel Brown's had a burden on his
[1:15:07] heart to do
[1:15:09] something for the community where he was
[1:15:12] raised
[1:15:14] up and he come and talk to me about it
[1:15:17] and want me to pray with him of course
[1:15:19] he follow the leading of the Lord and
[1:15:21] God would be with him and wed my advice
[1:15:23] lesson so it so happens that there's a
[1:15:26] church not too far from this community
[1:15:30] where brother Joel was feeling and I
[1:15:33] told him brother Joel the first thing
[1:15:34] you need to do of course after praying
[1:15:37] about it is contact the brother in that
[1:15:40] area right Joel I said don't you go in
[1:15:44] there and try to start something
[1:15:46] different than what he's
[1:15:48] got said why would you tell him that
[1:15:51] because I think Bible
[1:15:53] I think
[1:15:55] Apostolic that's the way they did you
[1:15:58] never find them coming in come on
[1:16:00] children now preach with me you don't
[1:16:02] find it in the Bible with them going
[1:16:06] along with men who done something
[1:16:09] contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles
[1:16:12] and the
[1:16:15] prophets so I said go in and let the
[1:16:17] brother know you're not there trying to
[1:16:19] undercut him but you've got a burden for
[1:16:22] your your black Community where you were
[1:16:24] raised because many of them of course
[1:16:26] still live in their own community and
[1:16:27] may not go to some of the white churches
[1:16:29] yet or whatever more and he just wanted
[1:16:31] to go see is there somebody there Lord
[1:16:34] is there somebody there said but brother
[1:16:36] Joel the thing of it is you don't want
[1:16:37] to be like brother random brother random
[1:16:38] went to India and had hard no churches
[1:16:41] to support him all those people come to
[1:16:43] God and he said whenever he come back he
[1:16:45] said probably nearly every one of them
[1:16:47] went back to the siks the James the
[1:16:49] Buddhist because there was no church to
[1:16:52] s send them
[1:16:54] to so I said go there and talk to that
[1:16:56] Pastor which brother Joel did so and the
[1:16:59] brother actually said well you can have
[1:17:00] our church if you wish to if you want to
[1:17:02] use it for outreach whatever and I
[1:17:05] thought praise God that that's that's an
[1:17:06] awesome way to do it and brother Joel
[1:17:08] said well maybe not maybe we just you
[1:17:10] know get a building and I tell them I
[1:17:12] said where you going to have it I said I
[1:17:13] hadn't thought about that said well you
[1:17:15] going to use for PA well I hadn't
[1:17:16] thought about that well you see whenever
[1:17:18] you've got men that are experienced and
[1:17:21] you're going to start a work work it's
[1:17:24] foolish so foolish not to ask the men of
[1:17:29] God who's been laboring for
[1:17:32] decades it shows scriptural
[1:17:35] ignorance in the minds of so many
[1:17:44] people as I said I wonder how many
[1:17:46] Apostolic message churches we
[1:17:51] have thank you
[1:17:54] Jesus y'all want me to go on another
[1:17:56] hunting trip this week is any place say
[1:17:57] we can go brother
[1:17:59] Danel notice now in verse in verse 40
[1:18:03] and Paul chose Silas and
[1:18:07] departed because he felt led and he felt
[1:18:10] led and and uh Silas felt
[1:18:14] led Paul CH Silas and
[1:18:21] departed
[1:18:25] so do you understand what would happen
[1:18:26] in that day if a man would feel lad to
[1:18:29] go out and start a church or do
[1:18:32] whatever and they would go to the local
[1:18:34] church and say hey he come talk to
[1:18:38] you are you all working with this is
[1:18:40] this a work together with
[1:18:44] you and if they would have said
[1:18:47] no real Apostolic Believers would had
[1:18:50] nothing to do with it right come on
[1:18:54] message people
[1:18:56] will read your Bible now remember from
[1:19:01] this night forward every one of you is
[1:19:03] going to be held
[1:19:05] accountable and you will stand before
[1:19:07] the Lord God
[1:19:09] himself and these scriptures right here
[1:19:11] that you've seen on this screen will be
[1:19:14] on Heaven's
[1:19:16] screen
[1:19:18] yeah not only you visible but those of
[1:19:21] you that are streaming and if I'm taken
[1:19:23] from the earth and people go back and
[1:19:25] archive it them too cuz this is God's
[1:19:28] word not
[1:19:30] mine and he went through Syria and
[1:19:33] Sicilia confirming the churches chapter
[1:19:36] 16:4 and as they went through the cities
[1:19:39] they delivered them

[1:21:17] the age is going through an
[1:21:19] area and he would not even pass through

[1:21:23] Elders of the church and wanted to meet
[1:21:25] with
[1:21:27] them chapter 21: 18 and the day
[1:21:31] following Paul went in with us into
[1:21:34] James and all the elders were present

[1:21:40] particularly what things God had WR
[1:21:42] among the Gentiles by his

[1:23:42] Church wow you mean to tell me that
[1:23:46] Timothy then whenever he would go in and

[1:23:56] messenger to the people and say now I
[1:23:58] want to remind you now brother Paul you
[1:24:00] remember how he lived now brother Paul

[1:24:17] difference between us quoting the
[1:24:19] Vindicated prophet and you quoting the
[1:24:21] smiley preacher from t
[1:24:23] what's the differ that El standing up
[1:24:24] here preaching and you quoting the 700

[1:24:46] to God which put the same Earnest care
[1:24:49] Into the Heart of Titus for you for for
[1:24:52] indeed he accepted the exhortation being
[1:24:55] more forward of his own court and he
[1:24:57] went unto you we have sent with him the
[1:25:03] brother my
[1:25:05] goodness so you mean men of God actually
[1:25:09] felt they could influence others and
[1:25:12] they would go because these men of God
[1:25:15] hey why don't some of you Brothers go
[1:25:17] down to a jail over there why don't you
[1:25:19] do this what you want to do something
[1:25:20] for the Lord some young preachers want
[1:25:23] to preach and where a lot of them want
[1:25:24] to start out preaching before
[1:25:26] 500 yeah they want to stand up so why
[1:25:29] don't you go to the nursing home oh no
[1:25:31] no no I'm too nervous to go over a
[1:25:32] nursing home if God's called you you'll
[1:25:34] start in a hog lot if that's where you
[1:25:36] have to start if you've got to start
[1:25:38] down out with one woman Jesus wasn't too
[1:25:40] big to go to one woman anytime a
[1:25:42] preacher is too big to go to one woman
[1:25:43] he's too big for his
[1:25:45] britches amen if you're a called of God
[1:25:49] you'll preach in a pig lot you'll preach
[1:25:51] wherever God sent you because it's
[1:25:52] burning inside of your soul you ain't
[1:25:55] preaching for an offering you ain't
[1:25:56] preaching for a crowd you're preaching
[1:25:58] because God himself called you to do
[1:26:07] it now can you imagine if brother Joel
[1:26:10] Brown moved on his heart whenever they
[1:26:13] start having Services maybe he's already
[1:26:14] started having some and the brother from
[1:26:16] that area would call me and say Hey
[1:26:18] brother Donnie brother Joel Brown from
[1:26:19] your church is coming up here and he's
[1:26:21] doing this this or this you know
[1:26:23] anything about
[1:26:24] it and brother Joel didn't think it
[1:26:27] necessary of course to come to me and I
[1:26:30] would have to say no sir I
[1:26:33] don't I don't know one thing about
[1:26:38] it so I don't know exactly what verse
[1:26:41] said he might use but more than likely
[1:26:43] Sunday brother Joel is going to be his
[1:26:46] text why cuz he don't know brother Joel
[1:26:49] he want alpam under the headship of his
[1:26:51] pastor
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:57] but now if the brother's concerned and
[1:26:59] he ain't call me cuz he trusts him you
[1:27:01] imagine when say oh yeah done talk to
[1:27:03] Brother D okay that's good that's
[1:27:04] exactly right oh you say that's a
[1:27:06] denominational that's the Bible that's
[1:27:09] God's protocol but again friends people
[1:27:11] don't believe what the prophet told they
[1:27:14] do not believe what he said that God
[1:27:17] called ministers are God's commanding
[1:27:21] officers they simply don't believe
[1:27:25] it and do you realize your unbelief will
[1:27:28] keep you out of the
[1:27:30] Rapture you think it matters to God
[1:27:33] which scripture you disbelieve whether
[1:27:36] it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians
[1:27:42] 4 I want to believe all of them don't
[1:27:44] you
[1:27:45] brother
[1:27:49] amen boy it seems like I've been
[1:27:51] preaching for three days is it that long
[1:27:54] man a
[1:27:55] lot God help me
[1:27:58] tomorrow notice we have sent him the
[1:28:00] brother whose praises and the gospel
[1:28:02] throughout all the churches not that
[1:28:05] only but who was also chosen of the
[1:28:10] churches to travel with
[1:28:14] us with this
[1:28:17] Grace what a
[1:28:20] recommendation so the churches was in
[1:28:23] such Unison they said brother Paul We
[1:28:25] believe this young brother he'd be a
[1:28:27] blessing to you and a help to you and a
[1:28:28] strength to you so it wasn't just I feel
[1:28:30] L I feel L I feel L I feel
[1:28:34] L but the church has recommended this
[1:28:38] brother and Paul so honored the way the
[1:28:41] churches felt about
[1:28:44] it he said I believe I'll take him with
[1:28:50] us all these scriptures of will be
[1:28:52] available for you if you'd like to read
[1:28:53] them
[1:28:54] yourself this is not a king Donnie
[1:28:57] version It's the King James that's
[1:29:00] right I'm sorry y'all didn't know this
[1:29:02] is in your Bible maybe you'd spend more
[1:29:04] time reading your Bible instead of on
[1:29:06] Facebook and Tik Tok and twick twack and
[1:29:09] everything else in the world and social
[1:29:10] media spend a little time in Social
[1:29:12] mediating with God you might know your
[1:29:14] Bible a little
[1:29:19] better Philippians 2:25 yet I suppose it
[1:29:23] necessary to send to you
[1:29:28] aphroditus and companion and labor and
[1:29:31] fellow Soldier but your messenger he
[1:29:33] that ministered to my wants for he
[1:29:36] longed after you all and was full of
[1:29:39] heaviness don't you understand what this
[1:29:40] did this eliminated so much false
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:48] prophets they would not let them in
[1:29:50] their pulpit
[1:29:52] without
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:01] recommendation for he longed after you
[1:30:03] all and was full of Heaven is because
[1:30:05] that he had heard that ye had heard he
[1:30:08] had been sick for indeed he was sick and
[1:30:10] N to death but God had mercy on him and
[1:30:13] not on him only but on me also amen
[1:30:18] won't you look at this prophet of the
[1:30:19] age he needed men around him that had
[1:30:24] inferior
[1:30:25] Ministries and he did not feel
[1:30:30] threatened he needed men that could come
[1:30:33] he knew he wasn't going to live forever
[1:30:35] he knew in order for the message to live
[1:30:38] there had to be other men of God that
[1:30:40] would pack that same message oh I heard
[1:30:43] brother man said today things that ought
[1:30:44] to be and he's preaching that last
[1:30:46] message I if you knew it or not but that
[1:30:47] Assembly of God and he said I know I'm I
[1:30:50] know I'll go on I oil pass something
[1:30:52] like that and he said go on and these
[1:30:55] young men I used to fulfill that
[1:30:57] scripture not anymore since I'm an old
[1:30:59] man but these young men will take this
[1:31:03] message and sweep it on to the coming of
[1:31:06] the Lord Jesus tape players don't have
[1:31:10] legs Church come on MP3 players don't
[1:31:13] have legs Shaman don't have legs a tape
[1:31:16] player can't baptize you a tape player
[1:31:19] cannot sit there and cons so you God
[1:31:23] call men is what God ordained to pack
[1:31:27] this word he's never changed it and
[1:31:30] that's what we believe because we are
[1:31:33] original Apostolic
[1:31:36] [Applause]
[1:31:41] Believers praise
[1:31:43] God can you imagine what this
[1:31:46] recommendation meant now for a
[1:31:50] pafitis to the church I send him
[1:31:54] therefore the more carefully that when
[1:31:57] you see him again you may Rejoice that I
[1:32:00] may be the less sorrowful receive him
[1:32:09] therefore so what about hus
[1:32:13] fius and some of those others that he
[1:32:15] wrote their name in the Bible now they
[1:32:18] too were
[1:32:19] preachers but they were preachers
[1:32:21] without a recommendation oh my they were
[1:32:25] preachers that Paul warned the flock
[1:32:27] about now no doubt there some dumb sheep
[1:32:30] that went and hurt him just out of
[1:32:32] curiosity but if they really believed
[1:32:34] this man was a servant of God you
[1:32:36] imagine ever darking in a door where
[1:32:38] amus was preaching or felius was
[1:32:41] preaching and Paul said their Doctrine
[1:32:43] does eat like a canker which is
[1:32:49] cancer and a corruption that starts in
[1:32:52] on the body and the skin begins to die
[1:32:55] word used for a couple different medical
[1:32:56] terms there and Paul would liken their
[1:32:59] Doctrine and their preaching to the
[1:33:01] rottening of the Flesh and the limbs
[1:33:04] would fall
[1:33:06] off ain't a saying of God full of the
[1:33:08] Holy Ghost going to sit and hear amanus
[1:33:10] preaching nothing why wasn't recommended
[1:33:13] by the
[1:33:16] church receive him therefore in the Lord
[1:33:18] with all gladness and hold such
[1:33:22] and
[1:33:25] reputation fimon 1 ver10 I beseech you
[1:33:29] beseech thee for my son onesimus whom I
[1:33:32] have begotten in my bonds which in time
[1:33:35] past was to thee unprofitable but now
[1:33:38] profitable to thee and to me whom I have
[1:33:43] sent
[1:33:45] again thou therefore
[1:33:48] receive
[1:33:50] him
[1:33:53] wow so if some other man raises up glory
[1:33:56] to God I'll tell you one thing I believe
[1:33:57] the word too hallelujah amen thank you
[1:34:01] Jesus and Paul didn't recommend
[1:34:04] him so it show up at Corinth or show up
[1:34:07] wherever wonder what them people would
[1:34:09] think and where where's your
[1:34:11] recommendation oh Lord to God I don't
[1:34:12] need no recommend Hallelujah I feel that
[1:34:15] oh
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:19] my friend should not believe some of the
[1:34:23] trash and the
[1:34:25] nonsense that's going on around our
[1:34:29] message people with some of their
[1:34:32] so-called
[1:34:34] gifts
[1:34:36] prophesying for this man to leave his
[1:34:39] wife and marry this man's
[1:34:44] wife and someone sometime ago a woman
[1:34:47] standing up and speaking in tongues and
[1:34:49] interpreting or prophesying or whatever
[1:34:51] you want to call it I've got a different
[1:34:52] name for
[1:34:54] it yeah the
[1:34:57] Lord I'm calling for a
[1:35:01] trim I'm calling for a
[1:35:07] trim so the sisters of the
[1:35:11] church went home and got their
[1:35:15] scissors and they started
[1:35:18] trimming well that's what the Lord said
[1:35:20] he wanted
[1:35:22] not my
[1:35:23] God beels above the
[1:35:27] devil well come on now well Hallelujah
[1:35:31] how do we judge prophecy oh I felt it we
[1:35:33] don't judge it by feeling we judge it by
[1:35:36] the word and if it don't come to pass it
[1:35:39] ain't the
[1:35:44] Lord hallelujah
[1:35:47] hallelujah oh my notice in Jude chapter
[1:35:51] one only one chapter of course verse 17
[1:35:53] but beloved remember ye The Words which
[1:35:55] were spoken before of the Apostles of
[1:35:58] the Lord Jesus Christ notice how now
[1:36:01] Jude is the Foster brother brother of
[1:36:03] the Lord
[1:36:05] Jesus notice how Jude is exhorting the
[1:36:09] people to Remember The Words which were
[1:36:13] spoken by the Apostle as if
[1:36:16] though it was the holy word of
[1:36:20] God
[1:36:23] wow how many believes the apostles
[1:36:25] Doctrine is important yes sir
[1:36:28] brother how many be honest and say well
[1:36:31] to be honest with you I'm not sure how
[1:36:33] much of the message churches even go
[1:36:35] with that anymore I'll raise my hands
[1:36:36] whether you got enough courage to or not
[1:36:39] I can guarantee
[1:36:41] you it's so sad when you look at it oh
[1:36:44] my brother Donnie we're in the age of
[1:36:45] the Prophet The Apostles don't even
[1:36:46] matter no more
[1:36:48] really well Jesus certainly disagrees
[1:36:51] with you that's right because he built
[1:36:53] his City in
[1:36:55] heaven in a reflection of the earth
[1:36:58] Revelation 21:14 and the wall of the
[1:37:01] city had 12 foundations and in them the
[1:37:06] names of the 12
[1:37:09] Apostles of the Lamb
[1:37:13] yes so you mean when you get there and
[1:37:15] you're going to live in that City for
[1:37:18] eternity you're going to see them 12
[1:37:21] names of them
[1:37:23] Apostles now you see the Lord Jesus want
[1:37:25] he said brother brandom did not go in
[1:37:27] there and tire at TH Foundation say now
[1:37:28] wait a minute I made a mistake here I
[1:37:31] shouldn't have never built the city on
[1:37:32] the foundation of the Apostles I should
[1:37:34] have just buil on brother Bram alone and
[1:37:35] have brother Ram's name
[1:37:39] there he makes no
[1:37:43] mistakes so what did Brother Brandon be
[1:37:46] built upon the doctrine and the teaching
[1:37:49] of the Apostles and Jesus Christ was so
[1:37:51] confident that he could build the church
[1:37:53] on it that he himself allowed himself to
[1:37:56] be the first stone laid on that
[1:38:01] foundation and then you and I are given
[1:38:04] the privilege to be laid by
[1:38:07] him on that same Foundation that's
[1:38:10] right let's
[1:38:14] stand praise the
[1:38:20] Lord and the church
[1:38:29] said how many wants our
[1:38:32] church to be a Bible
[1:38:34] believing Apostolic
[1:38:38] Church not UPC not Church of God in
[1:38:41] Christ not any of these
[1:38:44] other denominational things but a Bible
[1:38:48] believing Church
[1:38:52] oh
[1:38:54] my
[1:38:56] hallelujah thank you
[1:38:59] Father thank you Father you see in
[1:39:01] reality
[1:39:02] friends a man a preacher which cannot be
[1:39:07] led and cannot recognize headship
[1:39:10] himself is not a
[1:39:13] leader he is a
[1:39:16] dictator you look at the difference
[1:39:18] between Saul and David Saul could not be
[1:39:22] corrected Saul could not admit he was
[1:39:24] wrong he couldn't follow directions so
[1:39:27] therefore he could not be LED under the
[1:39:29] teachings of the prophet
[1:39:33] Samuel and look he becomes so stubborn
[1:39:35] so hard-headed he didn't want to be told
[1:39:37] what to do oh yeah God said this I've
[1:39:39] done what God Said but look at David boy
[1:39:43] he had his mistakes didn't he but he
[1:39:45] knew how to repent amen and he could do
[1:39:48] it not because of act but because he
[1:39:51] genuinely meant it that's right he could
[1:39:54] be led to repentance he could be led to
[1:39:57] saying he was wrong he could be led and
[1:39:59] God even hundreds of years later God was
[1:40:02] still referring back to David and he
[1:40:04] said for my servant David's sake for my
[1:40:07] servant David's sake hundreds of years
[1:40:11] after he was gone but his legacy meant
[1:40:14] so much to God oh may God help
[1:40:18] us we can be that kind of Christians
[1:40:21] let's bow our heads if you
[1:40:24] would praise the Lord now maybe you're
[1:40:28] here tonight and you say actually
[1:40:29] brother Donnie I didn't realize the
[1:40:31] Bible said all that well you probably
[1:40:34] didn't because you're not called to
[1:40:36] study the word like a preacher would and
[1:40:39] God knows
[1:40:40] that so maybe you didn't understand
[1:40:42] maybe you didn't see it maybe you didn't
[1:40:43] know it was there but after tonight you

[1:41:56] brothers and
[1:41:57] sisters still in parts of Africa India
[1:42:02] different parts of the world still don't
[1:42:05] have a personal
[1:42:08] Bible I've seen some pictures of some
[1:42:11] just a few days
[1:42:14] ago getting their own Bible for the
[1:42:18] first
[1:42:19] time we have them laying in our cars
[1:42:22] laying in our homes we have access to
[1:42:24] them all of us that have a
[1:42:26] smartphone have access to them and how
[1:42:29] much do we read
[1:42:31] them how I thank you for the
[1:42:34] Bible and Lord how we thank you tonight
[1:42:37] for the message of the hour
[1:42:39] amen that points us right back to the
[1:42:42] Bible the devil tried to lay a trap for
[1:42:45] your Prophet one
[1:42:47] day a man come to the prophet and said
[1:42:50] now now brother
[1:42:51] brandham you've had so much experience
[1:42:54] with God so many visions and so on you
[1:42:59] would be
[1:43:00] qualified to write your own
[1:43:05] Bible now he said the
[1:43:07] man i' have been trying to catch me a
[1:43:10] little and I said well brother that
[1:43:13] might be
[1:43:15] so but that couldn't be what God would
[1:43:17] want because he said there would be NE
[1:43:20] added to this
[1:43:23] word I remember brother Charlie Cox
[1:43:26] telling me one time that when brother
[1:43:28] brandham was there at their house and
[1:43:31] brother Char had been reading a message
[1:43:32] book and he had his Bible laying there
[1:43:34] on a table
[1:43:37] and he had just laid that message book
[1:43:39] over on top of the
[1:43:41] Bible brother brandham saw it went over
[1:43:45] and picked it up and laid the Bible on
[1:43:49] top of the message book
[1:43:51] said brother Charlie don't ever put
[1:43:53] anything before the word of
[1:43:59] God Lord God I pray our people will
[1:44:01] always believe
[1:44:03] that I pray your people around the world
[1:44:06] will always have that
[1:44:08] attitude to love the
[1:44:11] word to love their
[1:44:14] scriptures to read them oh Jesus we love
[1:44:19] you father we don't want to just baptize
[1:44:21] in your name say we're Apostolic we're
[1:44:24] one God but we want to be able to take
[1:44:27] the founding of a new church or the
[1:44:30] advancing of the kingdom of God brothers
[1:44:33] that would go out of our assembly I
[1:44:35] don't believe you call preachers just to
[1:44:37] set them all under a preacher the rest
[1:44:39] of their
[1:44:40] life but they may be sitting there for
[1:44:42] years to get
[1:44:44] training so they can be able to go out
[1:44:47] maybe start other works or missionary or
[1:44:49] whatever more
[1:44:51] more but Lord if they follow the
[1:44:53] apostolic
[1:44:55] pattern they will not have to sneak
[1:44:57] around behind the pastor's back like a
[1:45:00] snake in the
[1:45:03] grass thank you Lord cuz if they would
[1:45:06] have done that in the days of Paul they
[1:45:08] would have got no
[1:45:12] recommendation help us
[1:45:15] father What a Sad thing it
[1:45:18] is many churches will
[1:45:21] crumble because they aren't built on the
[1:45:24] revelation of your
[1:45:27] word I didn't start this church Lord it
[1:45:30] was started years ago on rone Hill I
[1:45:34] thank you for those who started it
[1:45:36] Lord Lord the Yan's family and the
[1:45:39] Phillips family and many of them dear
[1:45:41] God their parents and grandparents and
[1:45:45] we thank you for them they were the
[1:45:48] Pioneers that started it then move moved
[1:45:50] it over to Happy Valley and Lord they
[1:45:53] changed the name of it when it moved
[1:45:56] from Ron Hill to Happy Valley because
[1:45:59] they didn't figure that Ron Hill would
[1:46:01] quite fit the name anymore with them
[1:46:04] being at Happy
[1:46:05] Valley sort of the way I looked at it
[1:46:07] whenever we left Happy Valley I didn't
[1:46:10] figure it'd be fitting since we're
[1:46:11] sitting in Buffalo Valley to call it
[1:46:14] happy
[1:46:17] valley so I figured it's time for a
[1:46:19] change
[1:46:22] Lord
[1:46:23] God just because we change the name of
[1:46:26] the church don't mean we change what we
[1:46:28] stand for as a matter of fact I'm more
[1:46:31] determined now to disrupt the kingdom of
[1:46:33] Hell than I've ever been in my
[1:46:36] life hallelujah hallelujah we're more
[1:46:39] determined dear God to stand for your
[1:46:41] gospel stand for your truths cast out
[1:46:45] Devils heal the sick I'm more determined
[1:46:48] dear God to pray for the sick people
[1:46:50] people I'm more determined to pray for
[1:46:52] folks with cancer than I've ever been in
[1:46:54] my entire life I am by no means
[1:46:58] discouraged I am by no means down or
[1:47:01] weary Satan thought he would get my face
[1:47:04] but he better thinkink again he thought
[1:47:06] he would discourage us but he better
[1:47:08] think again we are not discouraged we
[1:47:12] are encouraged we are encouraged in the
[1:47:15] word we're encouraged in Your Great Name
[1:47:18] in your great power father we're looking
[1:47:21] for great things to happen among us
[1:47:24] we've seen great things but we are
[1:47:26] looking for greater and by greater I
[1:47:28] don't necessarily mean more emotion I
[1:47:30] mean a greater manifestation of your
[1:47:33] person and when I say greater I don't
[1:47:36] mean dead a lot of folks consider
[1:47:39] greater with dead I don't think it's
[1:47:41] going to be dead I don't think we're
[1:47:43] going to stop worshiping we ain't going
[1:47:45] to stop praising we ain't going to stop
[1:47:48] singing we're not going to stop clapping
[1:47:50] our hands I think we ought to have a
[1:47:52] shout we ought to have the shout of the
[1:47:54] king among us now more than ever before
[1:47:57] because your word is manifesting itself
[1:48:01] amen Lord God prove yourself Among
[1:48:05] Us Jesus we've already seen you heal
[1:48:09] cancer we saw sister Ruth Garden Lord I
[1:48:13] believe with all of my heart here
[1:48:14] several months
[1:48:16] ago she lay there dear God lifeless
[1:48:20] but after prayer the spirit of God
[1:48:23] brought our sister back we've seen you
[1:48:26] do so many things among us already Lord
[1:48:30] God that only fertilizes our faith to
[1:48:33] believe you've got wonderful things if
[1:48:35] we can only stay small and stay humble
[1:48:39] Lord God help us I pray amen thank you
[1:48:43] Father how many wants that with all your
[1:48:46] heart amen friends let me show you the
[1:48:49] difference difference between some of
[1:48:52] the arrogance that goes around some of
[1:48:54] the message
[1:48:55] preachers I a god taken me to hunt this
[1:49:00] week and I almost missed the deer that
[1:49:03] the Lord give me because the guide
[1:49:05] hadn't called me and I thought well it's
[1:49:06] too late for me to go brother Daniel
[1:49:09] called anyway Fally worked it out where
[1:49:11] I could this guy I get in his truck and
[1:49:14] he's getting there maybe had even went a
[1:49:16] mile we've talked about the Lord he's a
[1:49:19] saved man been a Sunday school teacher
[1:49:21] youth leader things like that about 64
[1:49:23] years
[1:49:24] old and he said D already told me said
[1:49:27] my my son's a pastor 32 years old and he
[1:49:31] said I can tell from talking to you
[1:49:34] you're a man of God your experience and
[1:49:37] handling the
[1:49:38] word what advice would you give to my
[1:49:43] son I thought as as I sat
[1:49:47] there m Jo my heart's I I I I was so
[1:49:52] sad because I thought of the message
[1:49:56] preachers that could ask their Elders
[1:49:59] similar
[1:50:01] things but won't even do
[1:50:03] it won't even come to Men of God that
[1:50:06] have labored in the word and already
[1:50:09] forgotten more than some of them will
[1:50:10] ever even know and won't even humble
[1:50:13] thems to come the Servants of God and
[1:50:15] say help me man of God I've got a burden
[1:50:18] on my heart to do this to do that do you
[1:50:20] see anything wrong with it do you see
[1:50:22] anything wrong in my Ministry look at me
[1:50:24] servant of God pray with me help me
[1:50:26] advise me yeah and I thought how sad I'm
[1:50:32] not sure if he was a Baptist or
[1:50:33] Methodist whatever but all I know is we
[1:50:36] talked about the Lord and hugged one
[1:50:37] another's neck and shed
[1:50:39] tears I thought how pitiful that a man
[1:50:43] like this that knows nothing about the
[1:50:45] message of Malachi 4 and yet but have
[1:50:47] more humility about him don't even know
[1:50:50] what I believe and some of the message
[1:50:53] people that have watched you for years
[1:50:54] and
[1:50:55] years yeah what'd you tell him brother
[1:51:00] Donnie I said my advice to him would be
[1:51:03] this stay
[1:51:06] humble stay
[1:51:08] little don't never become big in his own
[1:51:11] eyes and become arrogant and
[1:51:15] proud and I said if he will stay that
[1:51:17] way God will be able to use him
[1:51:21] he said 'w he's always been humbled and
[1:51:22] got a real good spirit I said that's
[1:51:24] great but I said tell him that I said to
[1:51:28] keep it because Solomon the man of God
[1:51:31] that built the Great temple of God when
[1:51:33] he got older he also built this Temple
[1:51:36] and that Temple and another Temple and
[1:51:38] another Temple for idol worship the very
[1:51:41] same man that built the house of
[1:51:43] God because he got arrogant and
[1:51:48] proud God God's blessed us and give us a
[1:51:51] nice place to worship don't we thank him
[1:51:53] for it than Lord but let's not get
[1:51:57] arrogant let's not get proud and say boy
[1:51:59] our church is Big our church is our
[1:52:03] church let's stay small and little and
[1:52:08] see what he'll do let's not ask people
[1:52:11] come and see our
[1:52:12] church let's tell them come and see our
[1:52:16] Jesus yeah
[1:52:18] amen amen

[1:52:22] Jesus don't come and see our pastor come

[1:52:58] amen
[1:53:03] hallelujah sing something for us
[1:53:08] s praise the
[1:53:11] Lord you imagine what brother Brandon
[1:53:13] would be able to say tonight if he'd
[1:53:14] walk in this church and say
[1:53:18] my those of you that have been to
[1:53:20] brandham Tabernacle you know how small
[1:53:21] that it is how humble how
[1:53:25] little brother brandham wanted to build
[1:53:27] a bigger
[1:53:28] church but the people didn't want to and
[1:53:31] one of the brothers that was on the
[1:53:33] board said that after the people voted
[1:53:36] not to do it brother brandham told them
[1:53:39] that's what they think of my
[1:53:45] Ministry but because the church voted to
[1:53:47] do so he stayed right there but I've
[1:53:51] often wondered what it would have been
[1:53:55] if they would have been of the right
[1:53:56] mind you see a Visionary is always one
[1:53:59] of the most misunderstood preachers that
[1:54:02] there is in the
[1:54:04] ministry because most everybody just
[1:54:06] wants to keep his scrunch down don't
[1:54:08] grow don't do this don't do that oh no
[1:54:10] oh no it's our for and no more but the
[1:54:13] Visionary that says what about
[1:54:15] tomorrow if there is another 10 years or
[1:54:18] 5 years what will we do what are we
[1:54:20] going to do with our young people what
[1:54:22] are we going to give to
[1:54:25] them oh my we don't want to just give

[1:54:33] be born again but I also want to give
[1:54:36] you a place where you can come together
[1:54:38] with your own and we can invite the
[1:54:40] youth from North Carolina South Carolina
[1:54:42] Georgia it's absolutely amazing the
[1:54:45] youth services that we've had I'm
[1:54:48] hearing from pastors I'm hearing from
[1:54:49] youth churches or youth leaders rather
[1:54:52] some of these other churches when I was
[1:54:53] here when brother Matt was here how many
[1:54:55] of the youth from South Carolina North
[1:54:57] Carolina Georgia sit outside and say
[1:54:59] thank you brother Donnie for letting us
[1:55:02] come praise God so you see this ain't
[1:55:05] just for
[1:55:07] us this ain't just for us hallelujah and
[1:55:12] it won't be if we'll stay little and
[1:55:14] stay

[1:55:36] preacher and I I've never even spoken
[1:55:39] tongues I don't get up on the floor and
[1:55:41] dance
[1:55:43] and I
[1:55:48] understand my little daughter that just
[1:55:50] stepped be on the curtain of time
[1:55:52] I never recall ever hearing her speaking
[1:55:56] tongues I seen her one time on a
[1:55:59] video where she was

[2:01:21] even though
[2:01:26] it's I'm sure that most of you probably
[2:01:28] know that sister sheay has been having
[2:01:32] some some real problems like seizure
[2:01:35] type things and they found they found a
[2:01:39] a growth and she can't even get in to
[2:01:42] get a a second MRI with contrast up
[2:01:45] until January so she's having these
[2:01:48] things multiple times during the day and
[2:01:50] it's sort of like that she passes out
[2:01:53] sometimes her eyes roll back in her
[2:01:55] head and then amazing that our health
[2:01:58] system is so backed up that someone like
