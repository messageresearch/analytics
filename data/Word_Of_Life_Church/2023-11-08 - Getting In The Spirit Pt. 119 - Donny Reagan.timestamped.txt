[41:45] praise the Lord thank you Lord let's
[41:47] turn to the Book of Numbers tonight if
[41:48] you would chapter 1 verse 52 greet you
[41:52] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:53] and did a wonderful privilege for us to
[41:55] be guest gathered together in his house
[41:57] once again and on Wednesday night yes
[42:01] numbers
[42:03] 1:52 and the children of Israel shall
[42:06] pitch their tents every man by his own
[42:09] camp and every man by his own standard
[42:13] throughout their host numbers chap 2
[42:18] verse 2 every man of the children of
[42:21] Israel shall pitch by his own standard
[42:24] with the ins sign of their father's
[42:28] house far off about the Tabernacle of
[42:32] the
[42:33] congregation shall they pitch so we know
[42:36] that there's a difference between order
[42:39] and organization God is against man-made
[42:43] organization but God is not against
[42:46] divine order Isaiah
[42:50] 5919 so shall they fear the name of the
[42:52] Lord from the West and his glory from
[42:55] the RIS ring of the sun when the enemy
[42:58] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[43:01] the Lord shall lift up a standard or an
[43:05] ins sign or a banner or a standard same
[43:08] thing the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[43:11] up a standard against him which of
[43:14] course is against the enemy Joel 2 verse
[43:19] 7 a prophecy of the last days now
[43:22] remember scripture can have compound
[43:24] meanings um this is one of them but a
[43:28] prophecy of the last days of the army of
[43:31] God now listen what the army of God will
[43:33] be they shall run like Mighty Men they
[43:37] shall climb the wall like Men of War and
[43:42] they shall March everyone on his ways
[43:47] and they shall not break their
[43:52] ranks now this is the army of God they
[43:55] shall not
[43:56] break their ranks so they're assigned a
[44:00] certain rank a certain position the
[44:03] church ages have been designated to live
[44:06] under a certain anointing a certain
[44:08] message a certain move of God for that
[44:11] time the elect of God find that Rank and
[44:16] there they stay Satan's way is divide
[44:20] and conquer so if he can divide us from
[44:23] the anointing of the day divide us from
[44:25] what we're supposed to be then we're
[44:28] weaker all of us are and he's able to
[44:31] conquer us but we want to be like this
[44:33] Mighty Army that will run like Mighty
[44:35] Men they shall climb the wall like Men
[44:39] of War and they shall March everyone on
[44:44] his ways and they shall not break their
[44:49] ranks I me like to be remembered tonight
[44:52] as we
[44:53] pray Lord Jesus we love you so much
[44:56] we're so happy just so happy to be your
[44:59] people we're so grateful Heavenly Father
[45:02] for the evening life that has got a hold
[45:06] of our hearts and helped us dear Jesus
[45:09] Lord we know the message of the last day
[45:12] did not come to replace the Bible it did
[45:15] not come to bring us a new version of
[45:17] the Bible but it come to shine light on
[45:21] the Bible that we already had so when I
[45:25] come from p cost I did not need a new
[45:28] version I did not need a new translation
[45:31] I just needed new inspiration and from
[45:33] that same Bible that I wrote and
[45:36] preached from I've still got the one my
[45:38] grandmother gave me when I got saved at
[45:40] 12 years old and I've still got the one
[45:43] that I preached from in Pentecost very
[45:45] same version King James but now I'm
[45:47] preaching things so different what is it
[45:50] wasn't the Bible that changed it was the
[45:52] light on the Bible so father we're so
[45:55] grateful to be living under the
[45:57] influence of the evening light we
[45:59] believe we are an army of God we believe
[46:02] that we've been assigned a rank a
[46:04] position where we're supposed to stand
[46:06] we desire to be faithful father help us
[46:09] as we look into your word tonight we ask
[46:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:14] amen God bless you Saints you may be
[46:18] seated what a great thing it is to be
[46:20] able to find our position by the
[46:24] presence of God and we know that you
[46:26] know they asked brother random the
[46:27] question and question answers about how
[46:29] does one find their place in Christ
[46:31] Jesus and he said well generally your
[46:34] position is made known by whether you
[46:37] can do it or not whether you can do it
[46:40] or not so he said if a man claims that
[46:43] he's called to be a preacher watch how
[46:45] he interprets the word if a man claims
[46:47] he's called to be this or that then you
[46:50] watch and see if God has gifted him to
[46:53] be able to do it and it goes that way
[46:55] pretty much with anything that God
[46:57] enables his people to be able to do
[46:59] certain things now let us turn if you
[47:01] would to Revelation 4:5 we've been
[47:04] looking at that God has raised up a
[47:07] standard in every age and we can we can
[47:10] see by history that God did it down
[47:12] through the church ages also through the
[47:14] times of the Old Testament and we know
[47:16] that God has done it for us in this day
[47:18] and God we know goes by numerics threes
[47:21] fives sevens but one of the numbers that
[47:24] that's not very use that much actually
[47:26] Among Us is the number four four of
[47:29] course is a number of Earthly
[47:31] deliverance we don't care for four as
[47:32] much as we do for seven but yet four is
[47:35] very useful in the right place and we
[47:38] know that it was the fourth man in the
[47:39] furnace of fire of course that delivered
[47:41] the Hebrew children and four God uses
[47:44] four and we know that Ezekiel Saw four
[47:47] in his book and we know that Daniel also
[47:50] there was fours Book of Revelation there
[47:52] was fours so God chooses to reveal him
[47:55] himself under certain anointings and God
[47:58] will let the anointing be released and
[48:01] that anointing will anoint the people of
[48:03] that day that we receive it to come to
[48:06] the full accomplishment of what God
[48:08] wants them to be that's the only way
[48:10] they'll ever do it when never read
[48:12] oursel into it we'll never be able to
[48:14] get self self-help books and say well I
[48:17] want to be a better Christian so I'm
[48:18] going to get a self-help book and it's
[48:20] going to teach me how to be able to
[48:22] bring my flesh under control and I'm
[48:24] going to learn how to do that and learn
[48:26] how to do that we'll find out in a
[48:27] little bit where that where that stuff
[48:29] comes from but what we actually need is
[48:32] the anointing release to us from the
[48:34] presence of God for the day that we live
[48:37] in to help us accomplish the word that's
[48:40] been designated for that day you believe
[48:42] that with all your heart now watch
[48:44] Revelation 4:5 and out of the throne
[48:47] preceded Lightnings and thunderings and
[48:49] voices and there were seven lamps of
[48:52] fire burning Before the Throne which are
[48:55] the seven spirits of God now remember
[48:58] God is now revealed in in the seven so
[49:00] it's not that God has one Spirit then
[49:02] God has another Spirit but it's a
[49:04] manifestation of the same spirit of God
[49:07] now watch verse six and Before the
[49:09] Throne there was a sea of glass like
[49:12] unto Crystal and in the midst of the
[49:14] throne and round about The Throne were
[49:18] four beasts full of eyes before and
[49:21] behind now watch so here we have four
[49:24] which is not just a number of Earthly
[49:27] Deliverance but there's also an answer
[49:29] to the four on the earth and we can see
[49:32] it reflected in heaven now I'm not
[49:34] trying to get deep tonight I'm not
[49:36] trying to go the top of your head but
[49:37] just to be able to help you to
[49:39] understand why we must stand under the
[49:42] banner that God has given for us in the
[49:46] end time if we want to be raptured how
[49:48] many it does we want to have our body
[49:51] changed how many does then we've got to
[49:54] be under the display of the standard of
[49:58] the Lord for the day that we live in and
[50:01] we also must be aware that Satan will
[50:03] try his best to influence us with a
[50:07] false standard or a previous standard
[50:11] which has lived out its time now part of
[50:15] the danger that will be is that Satan is
[50:18] always trying to point people backwards
[50:21] to something that God used for another
[50:24] day and it is lived out its time it's
[50:27] completed it's fulfilled and inevitably
[50:30] it's lost the fullness of its power
[50:33] because God has turned a new page the
[50:36] light is shining on something else so if
[50:39] Satan cannot blind us from what God is
[50:41] presently doing by helping us to you
[50:44] know see the scarecrows in front of us
[50:46] he will try to point us backward to what
[50:49] has been and then we go in reverse
[50:51] remember God never gives us reversed as
[50:54] the children of God it's always moved
[50:56] forward amen Now watch how that John
[50:59] sees this and it must have been so
[51:01] peculiar remember that the prophets in
[51:03] the fourth dimension is where they would
[51:04] see their Visions but John has actually
[51:07] moved up into another dimension so this
[51:09] is more like a dimensional Vision
[51:12] instead of John just being here in time
[51:15] and looking out before his eyes but John
[51:17] was transmitted there to watch his
[51:19] happened so he sees four beasts and they
[51:22] are full of eyes before and behind so
[51:25] the eyes of course are a symbol of the
[51:28] ability of a spiritual Insight so they
[51:31] must have looked very strange so John
[51:33] looks and he sees four beasts and
[51:35] they've got eyes everywhere well it
[51:37] wasn't that it was some type of weird
[51:39] creature but it was God symbolizing that
[51:42] the anointing in every age that's going
[51:44] to be released will have the eye of
[51:46] Deliverance the eye of power the eye of
[51:48] abundance of Revelation every one of
[51:50] them is going to be an Insight by which
[51:53] will empower the saints of God to live
[51:55] and overcome in the day they live in now
[51:58] watch he said the first Beast was like a
[52:01] lion and the second beast was like a
[52:04] calf and the third Beast had a face as a
[52:07] man and the fourth Beast was like a
[52:10] flying eagle now here there's four
[52:13] different beasts which are powers and
[52:16] they're going to be reflected on the
[52:17] Earth by human voice now notice how
[52:20] strange this would seem I realize the
[52:22] majority of Christians in the age we
[52:24] live in they don't even read the book of
[52:26] Revelation they have no desire to
[52:28] because they read it they don't
[52:30] understand it it's symbols you know it's
[52:32] got all types of figures and
[52:34] numerologies and all that in they they
[52:36] just see no need whatsoever and even
[52:39] reading it but why would God give us the
[52:41] Book of Revelation if it's not going to
[52:44] be given for somebody to be able to
[52:46] understand it and what's really pitiful
[52:49] to me is that there are message people
[52:51] that feel the exact same way about the
[52:54] Book of Revelation all all they want to
[52:55] hear preach is the cross and the blood
[52:58] and mercy and forgiveness let me tell
[53:01] you something a preacher that that's all
[53:02] he preaches more than likely that's all
[53:05] he needs himself apparently he's got a
[53:08] lot of sin going on in his life and
[53:10] that's the only thing he knows how to
[53:12] preach well come on somebody and if all
[53:14] the people sting there they never want
[53:16] to hear about these things if you never
[53:18] want to hear about this you need to
[53:20] check your Holy Ghost cuz it was the
[53:22] Holy Ghost that anointed John to ride
[53:25] about this and everybody said now watch
[53:29] so they have identifications now watch
[53:31] what there are it's a beast which is
[53:34] representation of an animal so John sees
[53:37] it and one of them was like a lion it
[53:40] was not a lion but it was like a lion
[53:43] and the second was like it was not a
[53:45] calf but like a calf and the third had
[53:49] the face of a man and then the fourth
[53:51] was a flying eagle and the four beasts
[53:54] had each of them them six wings about
[53:57] him and they were full of eyes within
[54:01] and they rest not day and night saying
[54:03] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which
[54:06] was and is and is to come now want you
[54:09] to notice how they worship they do not
[54:12] worship A God Called father and A God
[54:15] Called son and A God Called Holy Ghost
[54:18] they are Oneness beast and they worship
[54:22] in the Oneness Avenue Lord God Almighty
[54:26] amen and they know how to worship and
[54:28] they worship in the realm of Holiness
[54:31] holy holy holy now notice what they do
[54:35] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty father
[54:39] son holy ghost in One throne in one
[54:43] display of his great
[54:46] power now notice and they say which was
[54:50] which is and which is to come notice the
[54:53] attributes Lord God God Almighty which
[54:57] was which is which is to come the threes
[55:00] made perfect in one being now notice
[55:04] then when those beasts give glory and
[55:07] honor and thanks to him not to them but
[55:11] to him that sat on the throne who liveth
[55:14] forever and ever so John now sees these
[55:18] four beast and he must have been just in
[55:21] in a state of bewilderment trying to
[55:23] understand what in the world would that
[55:25] means so prophets we know unless God
[55:27] would give them the interpretation of a
[55:29] vision they wouldn't know what to make
[55:31] of it brother R told us at himself about
[55:34] seeing visions he said sometimes you
[55:36] might see a lamb and it might mean a
[55:39] sheep or it might mean wool so it can
[55:43] mean two or three different things you
[55:45] remember there was a discernment in 1964
[55:48] and brother random calls a woman out and
[55:50] he tells her that her name was strong or
[55:52] Stout whichever one that it was and you
[55:54] know it was it was symbolic in the
[55:57] vision and she says the opposite of what
[55:59] he said yeah I said it was it was that
[56:02] so whatever it was that he saw in the
[56:04] vision I'm from Kentucky like he was so
[56:07] a strong or Stout to a Kentucky boy
[56:10] means the same thing so whatever he saw
[56:12] in the vision he didn't Mis misread the
[56:15] pronunciation but it was a symbolic
[56:18] representation of strength and with a
[56:20] Kentucky demeanor you would look at and
[56:23] say boy he's as Stout as a mu somebody
[56:25] else say well he's as strong as a mule
[56:28] well to me you said the exact same thing
[56:30] so a prophet then whenever he would see
[56:32] this he would not know exactly what it
[56:35] meant all he can say is well I I saw
[56:37] these four creatures and they all had
[56:39] eyes all over them and one looked sort
[56:41] of like a lion and the other one looked
[56:43] sort of like a calf and the other one
[56:45] had a face of a man you notice he didn't
[56:47] say what it actually looked like but he
[56:49] said it had a face of a man and then the
[56:52] other one was a flying eagle and then
[56:54] then he says he noticed about these
[56:56] beasts that they all got to worshiping
[56:59] the Lord God and they begin to praise
[57:01] him now Journey with me if you would
[57:03] into the fourth seal and the prophet
[57:05] said now we find out this lamb open the
[57:08] seal and this first Beast if you notice
[57:11] the first Beast was a lion the living
[57:14] creature found notice now in the book of
[57:17] the church ages then the second beast I
[57:19] believe he said it was like the face of
[57:21] an ox or a cat and the third Beast was
[57:24] the face of a man and the first Beast
[57:26] was a face of anle now the face of a man
[57:31] what's that going to symbolize well it's
[57:33] going to symbolize a man's head if you
[57:35] notice it was not the arms of a man
[57:38] which be his strength or it was not the
[57:40] shoulders of a man which also would
[57:43] signify strength but it was the face of
[57:46] a man what's in the face the brain the
[57:49] intelligence we are recognized most of
[57:52] us you would never know me most of you
[57:54] would would never even know me if you
[57:56] only had my hand to go by my wife would
[58:00] my children would my grandkids would
[58:02] because they always want to see that
[58:04] that scar a man while I was bitten by a
[58:06] Rabbid Fox but most of you would not
[58:09] know my hand if aund hands was put up
[58:12] before you tonight on this screen most
[58:14] of you would not pick mine out but if my
[58:17] face was put up there you'd know me so
[58:19] there's something about the face of a
[58:22] man or a woman and that is what we
[58:24] identify with almost immediately is that
[58:26] right so then when John saw this Beast
[58:30] it was the identification of a man we
[58:32] don't know exactly what the man looked
[58:35] like and that was not the value but what
[58:37] the value was that it was a
[58:40] representation of a man so the man
[58:43] anointing was going to go for quite a
[58:46] lapse of time down in the church ages
[58:49] now remember this is the last one next
[58:52] to ours and I hope hope you understand
[58:55] what I'm fixing to say I'm afraid a lot
[58:58] of people I know in the Le ofan age but
[59:02] the sad part about it is I'm afraid
[59:04] there's some even around the ranks of
[59:07] our message that are still operating
[59:10] under the anointing of the
[59:13] man instead of the Flying Eagle now I
[59:17] want you to notice what the man's symbol
[59:20] was it was a symbol of the time or the
[59:23] age of
[59:25] Reformation now I want you to see that
[59:27] Reformation then comes from the man so
[59:31] the man symbolizes wisdom his ability to
[59:35] process but also remember that the
[59:37] prophet told us in the Garden of Eden
[59:39] that Satan chose man's head but God
[59:43] chose man's heart Malachi 4 was not sent
[59:47] to turn our heads to God but sent to
[59:51] turn our hearts to God but now watch
[59:54] what a lot of the men in the last days
[59:57] do so it's all about the head the mind
[1:00:01] trying to get them psychologically able
[1:00:04] to overcome so this guy will write a
[1:00:07] book and this guy will write another
[1:00:09] book and this woman will write another
[1:00:11] book on how to overcome and how to do
[1:00:13] this and how don't you understand why
[1:00:15] they're doing that because they've not
[1:00:17] moved under the eagle anointing which
[1:00:20] will Empower them to produce a word
[1:00:23] burst from the soul so what do they have
[1:00:26] to do then many of these preachers that
[1:00:28] are preaching the the majority of the
[1:00:30] denominational preachers don't even have
[1:00:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:00:33] Soul themselves if they do they'll go on
[1:00:35] the Rapture if they do how could they
[1:00:37] ever lead their churches into a
[1:00:39] denominational trap and be barked with
[1:00:42] the bark of the Beast come on now and
[1:00:44] then you look at some of the ones around
[1:00:46] the message and see what they have done
[1:00:48] down through the years and it's easy to
[1:00:50] see that some of the the group leaders
[1:00:52] and those that have built little
[1:00:54] kingdoms a kingdom here and a kingdom
[1:00:55] there what have most of them been
[1:00:57] brother Daryl they've not been under the
[1:00:58] eagle anointing the eagle anointing is
[1:01:01] to point worship back to the Lord God
[1:01:04] Almighty the eagle anointing is not to
[1:01:07] establish the kingdom of any man I don't
[1:01:10] care who he is or what his last name is
[1:01:13] we are not interested in building a
[1:01:15] brandom kingdom or a Reagan Kingdom or a
[1:01:18] pu Kingdom or a Spencer or Ward or any
[1:01:21] other man we are interested in
[1:01:23] worshiping the Lord God
[1:01:27] Almighty but you see people that get
[1:01:30] under the man anointing then what do
[1:01:33] they do they take their head to try to
[1:01:36] figure out a lot of things and they
[1:01:38] cannot really produce the power the
[1:01:41] dunamus from God to be able to give
[1:01:43] their people the ability to overcome so
[1:01:46] they have to keep doing it by the mind
[1:01:48] so they got to work on the Mind well
[1:01:49] they've got to have special classes on
[1:01:51] lust and you got to have a special class
[1:01:53] on life and you got to have another
[1:01:55] class on this and another class on that
[1:01:57] and another class on that why I'm not
[1:01:59] against that now but if we're simply
[1:02:01] trying to approach it on the basis of
[1:02:04] the mind it shows we're missing
[1:02:06] something from the soul we will never
[1:02:08] overcome the devil just by our ability
[1:02:11] to quote the scripture because the devil
[1:02:14] can out quote every one of us right here
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:17] tonight so I want you to notice in the
[1:02:20] man anointing it was the closest one to
[1:02:24] the Eagle in the lap over watch this in
[1:02:26] the Sixth Seal the prophet said then
[1:02:28] here come the reformers the head of a
[1:02:30] man shrewd wise Martin Luther John
[1:02:33] Wesley and so forth Calvin finny Knox
[1:02:36] the rest of them here come forth and
[1:02:38] when they did they were reformers but
[1:02:40] now remember Pentecost 1906 Pentecost
[1:02:45] fit under the same thing of the man
[1:02:49] anointed so the man anointing did not
[1:02:51] stop with KNX it did not stop with finny
[1:02:55] it did not stop with Calvin it run right
[1:02:58] up to where the birth of Revelation 10
[1:03:02] is going to usher in the anointing of
[1:03:04] Luke 17:30 Malachi 456 to where it will
[1:03:08] be a transition it's not just to change
[1:03:11] in Doctrine don't you understand what
[1:03:13] we've done many of us we've LED people
[1:03:15] to the message and we simply traded them
[1:03:18] from Baptist Doctrine to message
[1:03:20] Doctrine and they never really got the
[1:03:22] token in their lives
[1:03:24] and then they go on and they find out
[1:03:26] that their their lives is wrapped right
[1:03:28] back up in some of the same sins that
[1:03:31] they had before and they don't have
[1:03:33] power to overcome come on somebody
[1:03:35] preach with me tonight but we don't want
[1:03:37] to just have the doctrine of the message
[1:03:39] we want to have the power that it
[1:03:41] produces to be able to overcome and live
[1:03:44] a Victorious
[1:03:46] Life Now you see God realized how that
[1:03:50] man would be he could have released
[1:03:51] Eagle anointing of course if he wanted
[1:03:53] to in the beginning but God has an order
[1:03:55] of sequence and divine protocol by which
[1:03:58] he releases it so he chose the first
[1:04:01] anointing was what that of the Lion now
[1:04:04] the lion was the influence of the
[1:04:06] personal life of Christ himself so it
[1:04:09] was the alpha age the alpha Church which
[1:04:12] is what the vision that the prophet saw
[1:04:14] when he saw the bride standing there and
[1:04:16] she come through this beautiful music
[1:04:18] and she was all dressed you know and in
[1:04:19] her long garments and her long hair and
[1:04:22] he said the same bride's going to come
[1:04:23] back again of course in between those
[1:04:25] intervals he saw the church come through
[1:04:27] and the church was naked and wretched
[1:04:29] and blind and all of that then he said
[1:04:31] but wait a minute the bride will come
[1:04:33] back again and then whenever he didn't
[1:04:35] even have the interpretation of the
[1:04:36] vision and he tells the vision but then
[1:04:38] as he's preaching the message in the
[1:04:40] Masterpiece then God gives him the
[1:04:42] Divine interpretation and he said I just
[1:04:44] now got the interpretation of what that
[1:04:46] was and he said she was Alpha and Omega
[1:04:50] so now I thought Jesus was that well
[1:04:52] it's him and feminist form you see it
[1:04:55] was him in that original bride it was
[1:04:58] the alpha bride then in between that was
[1:05:02] what these other Church ages under the
[1:05:04] anointing of the man they were neither
[1:05:07] alpha or Omega but they were under the
[1:05:10] man anointed now remember that's all
[1:05:12] they could work under we cannot blame
[1:05:14] them for that because that's all they
[1:05:16] had that's all was given from the time
[1:05:19] that the reflection of the man be to
[1:05:22] shine on the church ages until the birst
[1:05:24] of the eagle anointing in the last day
[1:05:27] but now people choose people choose to
[1:05:31] stay under the man anointing or they
[1:05:34] will temporarily come out from under the
[1:05:36] man anointing and they will live under
[1:05:39] the eagle anointing for a bit and then
[1:05:41] they say no no no no no I can't handle
[1:05:44] that no sir no no this message s Malachi
[1:05:47] 4:7 you know they get it quote the
[1:05:48] prophet I can't handle that so they take
[1:05:51] what they want you know get this get
[1:05:52] that the other and then start slipping
[1:05:55] back under the anointing of the man
[1:05:57] again why because it's still here it's
[1:06:00] still here how do you think the majority
[1:06:02] of the churches are operating don't you
[1:06:04] think they have the spirit of God yes
[1:06:06] many of them do have a portion of the
[1:06:08] spirit of God what if it's the eagle
[1:06:10] anointing that fly out of them a
[1:06:12] denominational pins and become born of
[1:06:14] the word of the Hour come on now but
[1:06:17] they're not they can live the right they
[1:06:19] want to live so we have Christian drug
[1:06:21] addicts we have Christians that are hung
[1:06:23] up on on all kinds of Filth and sin we
[1:06:26] have Christians that's doing the same
[1:06:28] stuff that Sinners are doing except they
[1:06:30] just call them themselves a Christian
[1:06:32] come on search well why can't they do it
[1:06:35] they know it ain't right don't you think
[1:06:37] people don't know it's not right for
[1:06:39] them to live the way they live many of
[1:06:40] them do but they don't have the power to
[1:06:43] help them overcome and many the
[1:06:45] preachers standing in the pulit don't
[1:06:46] have the power either so they've got to
[1:06:49] figure out how they can water it down so
[1:06:52] the songwriters write songs about it
[1:06:54] well that's what the blood is for cuz
[1:06:56] God knows you can't live right God knows
[1:06:59] you can't do it so God gives you the
[1:07:01] blood so basically you sin every day and
[1:07:03] you ask God to forgive you and then the
[1:07:05] next day you do the same thing or worse
[1:07:07] and it's the same repetitive stuff over
[1:07:09] and over again oh but if you're really
[1:07:11] born of the spirit of God there is no
[1:07:13] desire of sin left in you anywhere the
[1:07:17] worshipper once purged has no more
[1:07:20] conscience of
[1:07:22] sin am amen but you see those who are
[1:07:26] still C under the Trap of the man
[1:07:28] anointing and that's where of course
[1:07:30] where would it lead them to it cannot
[1:07:33] lead them to a Rapture because it
[1:07:35] processes the gospel through the mind it
[1:07:38] processes the word to the mind so you
[1:07:41] know prophet and all that oh my goodness
[1:07:43] no no no we we can't accept none of that
[1:07:46] stuff well the law and the prophets want
[1:07:47] under John and you're kind trying to
[1:07:50] quote that and use that for a scripture
[1:07:53] that there is no New Testament prophets
[1:07:55] when Paul himself wrote about prophets
[1:07:58] after that one was written you don't
[1:07:59] even know what you're even quoting the
[1:08:01] law and the prophets was a Hebrew idiom
[1:08:04] it was a saying that was used among the
[1:08:07] Hebrews which meant the law the first
[1:08:09] five books of Moses and the prophets
[1:08:12] which was Isaiah Jeremiah Malachi
[1:08:14] Zachariah the law and the prophets was
[1:08:16] what the Old Testament so the law and
[1:08:20] the prophets the Old Testament was unto
[1:08:22] John and then the king of Heaven is
[1:08:24] preached and every man presseth his way
[1:08:27] into it how would a man ever come out
[1:08:29] with such a thing because he's under the
[1:08:31] anointing of a man so it's a man's mind
[1:08:35] well I can't understand that I I can't
[1:08:37] process all that stuff about visions and
[1:08:40] bride and church and election and all
[1:08:42] that well come up here where the Eagles
[1:08:44] are and be able to fly around up here
[1:08:46] where we are and you'll be able to see
[1:08:48] it's all through the
[1:08:50] Bible praise the Lord It's All Through
[1:08:52] the Bible it's not
[1:08:54] manmade I want you to notice then the
[1:08:57] reformers the prophet identifies this
[1:08:59] that they were reformers they come forth
[1:09:01] reforming don't you understand friend
[1:09:03] that that's what a lot of the message
[1:09:05] folks are doing that's what they've done
[1:09:07] for years and years we've got message
[1:09:10] reformers brother darl that's why they
[1:09:12] don't have the power to overcome and the
[1:09:14] same people that brother darl goes and
[1:09:15] preaches in a place and young people old
[1:09:18] people whatever come up in a par line
[1:09:20] another preacher come through another
[1:09:21] three or four weeks some of the same
[1:09:23] ones and the prayer line again another
[1:09:25] preacher come through come to the same
[1:09:27] prayer line again what for for some of
[1:09:29] the same stuff sure if you've got a
[1:09:32] different need come back but why can't
[1:09:34] we
[1:09:35] overcome God wants us to be prayed for
[1:09:39] God wants us to have prayer lines and
[1:09:41] we're going to continue to have them
[1:09:43] until we leave this world but I'll tell
[1:09:45] you one thing I cannot pray you through
[1:09:48] the victory brother Daryl cannot pray
[1:09:51] you through the victory the rest of
[1:09:53] these pre creachers cannot pray you
[1:09:55] through you've got to live you've got to
[1:09:58] walk in Victory you've got to have
[1:10:01] victory in your life or you'll never be
[1:10:04] able to obtain Victory up whenever we're
[1:10:06] having church and shout and jump and run
[1:10:09] around and ain't even got enough Victory
[1:10:11] tomorrow to overcome the devil you need
[1:10:13] to say God I'm sick of this I'm sick and
[1:10:16] tired of living like a yoyo I'm up and
[1:10:19] down and up and down God I want Power I
[1:10:23] want dunamus I want the anointing of the
[1:10:27] evil that I Can Fly Above pornography
[1:10:31] that I Can Fly Above temper I Can Fly
[1:10:35] Above
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:46] anger is Reformation good
[1:10:50] yep but it just don't take you far
[1:10:53] enough
[1:10:55] notice what it does they were reformers
[1:10:57] they come forth reforming bringing the
[1:11:01] people out
[1:11:05] yes but Redemption has two parts
[1:11:08] bringing them out and taking them
[1:11:12] in so people come to give their heart to
[1:11:15] the Lord no doubt every every weekend
[1:11:17] around the Tri Cities areas all the
[1:11:18] churches here there's all kinds of
[1:11:20] people that give their heart to Christ
[1:11:24] yeah wonder why it goes with that move
[1:11:29] to say Christ more than the Lord
[1:11:33] Jesus wonder why they'd rather say
[1:11:36] Christos which is the Greek for the
[1:11:39] anointed one instead of calling the name
[1:11:42] that the angel gave
[1:11:44] him now you watch them you watch a lot
[1:11:47] of these teachers and it's Christ this
[1:11:49] Christ that Christ this Christ that
[1:11:52] that's true well come on don't get quiet
[1:11:55] me you know what what really bothers me
[1:11:56] is when you go to see M's preacher going
[1:11:58] the same
[1:12:00] way uhhuh why not call him his name I
[1:12:05] mean you can call me preacher if you
[1:12:07] want to people do how you doing preacher
[1:12:10] how are you preacher how you doing
[1:12:12] preacher well that's who I am as far as
[1:12:15] my position but I do have a name my mom
[1:12:18] and daddy gave it to me I've got a name
[1:12:21] so preacher you know I me that's that's
[1:12:23] an identification but I do have a name
[1:12:27] and the Lord Jesus has a name well come
[1:12:30] on now oh the anointed one this the
[1:12:33] anointed one that I I tell you one thing
[1:12:35] whenever I'm in trouble I like to call
[1:12:37] on that blessed name and when that
[1:12:40] Devil's around me I like to say that
[1:12:42] name oh yes I have no problem in saying
[1:12:45] Christ it's in the Bible yes sir but you
[1:12:47] watch that identification generally the
[1:12:50] language of
[1:12:52] reformers
[1:12:54] Christ this Christ that Christ this well
[1:12:59] God understands God understands this age
[1:13:03] is so evil and there's so much Darkness
[1:13:05] God understands why we can't live right
[1:13:08] he sure does he understands you're not
[1:13:10] born
[1:13:13] again praise the
[1:13:15] Lord now watch this he said they come
[1:13:18] forth reforming bringing the people out
[1:13:21] and turn right back around exactly
[1:13:23] they did back back there and marriage
[1:13:25] straight back into the denominational
[1:13:29] system again the foreal now remember now
[1:13:32] in this first age was a lion Age The
[1:13:36] Lion of the tribe of Judah Christ on
[1:13:39] influence of life now watch Christ
[1:13:43] anointed one now we're talking about
[1:13:45] office Christ own influence anointed one
[1:13:50] anointing his sons and daughters Christ
[1:13:53] own influence of Life taken that age
[1:13:57] that's the first Beast so a beast was a
[1:14:01] power so the Lord Jesus allowed his own
[1:14:05] personal influence of his lion anointing
[1:14:09] to get on that first age that's what
[1:14:12] they needed they needed a lot of
[1:14:14] boldness did they now the line of the
[1:14:17] tribe of Judah of course is what he
[1:14:18] represented now he said that's the first
[1:14:20] Beast which means power that answered by
[1:14:25] human
[1:14:26] voice power that answered by human voice
[1:14:32] so if God would have come down and
[1:14:35] showed a line in every church service
[1:14:38] and a great supernal something would
[1:14:40] have been displayed oh my no doubt
[1:14:42] people would have come to the Altar and
[1:14:44] they'll run and scream for Mercy but God
[1:14:47] didn't do it that way what God did was
[1:14:48] took his own personal life and answered
[1:14:51] back out through human voice
[1:14:54] and then delect heard it and the others
[1:14:56] are blinded by the veil of the
[1:14:58] flesh so God anointed human beings with
[1:15:02] his anointing but it wasn't his voice
[1:15:05] that thundered from Heaven as it was on
[1:15:07] siia or Mount Transfiguration it was God
[1:15:11] anointing their human voice and some saw
[1:15:15] men others saw
[1:15:18] God
[1:15:20] hallelujah praise God that first be
[1:15:23] which means power that answered by human
[1:15:28] voice Lord Jesus Keep Us right there
[1:15:31] that next age was the ox age or the dark
[1:15:33] horse rider age the second age was a red
[1:15:37] horse rider and which was a dark age and
[1:15:39] the next age he said was the age that
[1:15:41] was the black horse rider he was the age
[1:15:44] of the reformers the Voice who spoke now
[1:15:49] if you've studied any and read much
[1:15:51] after Calvin KNX Finny they were men
[1:15:53] that were great men and they did have
[1:15:56] some truths yes they did they had some
[1:16:00] great truths but hardly any of them
[1:16:03] understood the true revelation of the
[1:16:05] godhead every one of them lucer Knox
[1:16:09] Calvin finny many of those great
[1:16:11] preachers every one of them nearly
[1:16:14] baptized en
[1:16:15] titles why because the man anointing
[1:16:19] would not anoint them Beyond looking at
[1:16:22] the scriptures and seeing and they
[1:16:25] looked right at and said there's got to
[1:16:26] be more than one who would Jesus pray to
[1:16:29] In The Garden of Gethsemane well who do
[1:16:30] you pray to when you're in trouble you
[1:16:32] pray to the god that lives inside you
[1:16:34] don't you well that's exactly what he
[1:16:36] was doing but the man anointing would
[1:16:39] try to figure it out in one plus one I
[1:16:42] mean how how could that be one it can't
[1:16:44] be it's got to be what is that the man
[1:16:46] the reformer well there's got to be well
[1:16:48] there's got to at least be two yeah you
[1:16:50] can see where that tun this thing come
[1:16:52] into the message can you some of the
[1:16:54] theologians in the message that weren't
[1:16:57] really under the eagle anointing what
[1:16:59] did they become brother Daryl reformers
[1:17:01] under the man AG so where did all these
[1:17:03] camps come from in the message reformers
[1:17:06] in the message come on now bring her
[1:17:08] around down brother Donnie where did all
[1:17:11] these things come through down Through
[1:17:12] the Ages all these denominational things
[1:17:15] as much as we hate them and yet they're
[1:17:17] right Among Us just as bad as they are
[1:17:19] here in the world and where did they
[1:17:21] come from Men that are working under the
[1:17:24] man anointing I'll tell you children
[1:17:27] it's going to take more than the man
[1:17:29] anointing to get us out of here we
[1:17:31] better be living walking talking praying
[1:17:35] revelated under the eagle anointing of
[1:17:38] this end time of Malachi 4 it's going to
[1:17:41] take more than Luther's understanding
[1:17:43] and Wesley's understanding we've got to
[1:17:46] have the influence of that flying
[1:17:50] eagle I want you to notice the posture
[1:17:52] of that Eagle it was not
[1:18:02] setting come
[1:18:07] on it was a flying eagle in action hey
[1:18:13] you don't you don't need Wings if you're
[1:18:15] going to set you don't need no movement
[1:18:17] you going but if you got Wings put them
[1:18:19] to use brother
[1:18:21] sister now notice this again in the fore
[1:18:24] but now when it comes forth the eagle
[1:18:27] age that's the one that God always
[1:18:29] Likens His prophets to Eagles he calls
[1:18:33] himself an eagle now could they do this
[1:18:36] of course in the days of Paul they
[1:18:38] couldn't could Peter have operated under
[1:18:40] that no he had to operate under the
[1:18:42] anointing of the Lion of the tribe of
[1:18:44] Judah so they would stand with great
[1:18:46] boness they would stand right in the
[1:18:48] face of dictators they would stand right
[1:18:50] in the face of neero and everybody else
[1:18:53] because the anointing on them they would
[1:18:55] look right at him in the face and tell
[1:18:56] you oh I would that you was just like me
[1:18:58] except for these chains they would say
[1:19:00] have you've been convicted also to be a
[1:19:02] Christian you're talking about men that
[1:19:05] could have them killed or men that could
[1:19:07] turn them loose but that anointing of
[1:19:08] that line it would move on them that'd
[1:19:11] preach the gospel that'd beat them
[1:19:12] they'd whip them that' threaten them and
[1:19:14] say Don't You Preach no more in the name
[1:19:16] of the Lord Jesus and the next day they
[1:19:18] found him right out on the corner of the
[1:19:20] street preaching the same gospel that
[1:19:22] they preached the day before now if You'
[1:19:24] have put the man anointing on them they
[1:19:26] thought now now Brethren now
[1:19:28] Brethren now I'll tell you what now we
[1:19:31] need to use
[1:19:33] wisdom so what we're going to do we're
[1:19:37] going to preach the message but we're
[1:19:39] not going to let nobody know
[1:19:43] it we're not going to use Paul's name
[1:19:45] and we're not going to use Peter's name
[1:19:48] for people who have a problem with
[1:19:50] people quoting men your whole Bible is
[1:19:54] written by
[1:19:55] men what do you think they preached in
[1:19:58] the New Testament they preached about
[1:20:00] Peter they preached about James about
[1:20:02] John about Paul oh my brother Donnie
[1:20:05] those those were those were holy men
[1:20:06] they were and what was Paul's writings
[1:20:08] in that day to a bunch of them people
[1:20:11] they thought that's just that man's
[1:20:12] ideas you look at it today and reverence
[1:20:15] it as the scripture you think they did
[1:20:17] in that day the elect did and the other
[1:20:20] said well that ain't nothing but just
[1:20:22] his opinion where did he get that in the
[1:20:24] Old Testament that a woman can't preach
[1:20:26] where did he get that in the Old
[1:20:28] Testament of this that and other he
[1:20:29] couldn't prove it was in the Old
[1:20:31] Testament to save his life Paul quoted
[1:20:33] it and said a woman supposed to remain
[1:20:35] silent in the church as also saith the
[1:20:38] law you bring me that scripture and I'll
[1:20:39] lead it 47
[1:20:42] ways the Old Testament does not say that
[1:20:46] but it silence is what Paul was
[1:20:49] quoting because it gave the woman no
[1:20:52] position to be a priest he was quoting
[1:20:55] The Silence of the
[1:20:57] law oh my oh he was a prophet do you
[1:21:01] believe that now of course we do now but
[1:21:04] what would you have done if You' have
[1:21:05] been in his
[1:21:08] day when we sneaked around Paul's
[1:21:10] writing
[1:21:14] said boy this is good
[1:21:20] stuff wow on us in Christ Lord have
[1:21:26] Mery oh for whom he did for know them he
[1:21:29] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[1:21:31] the image of his son that he might be
[1:21:33] the firstborn among many Brethren wow
[1:21:36] what a Bo i' like to preach that but
[1:21:39] where am I going to tell I got it at
[1:21:41] well just tell them just tell them oh I
[1:21:44] was praying I was praying and this come
[1:21:46] to me go ahead you lying
[1:21:50] dog I'm going to tell you one thing some
[1:21:52] of the worst lies you ever heard in your
[1:21:53] life as a
[1:21:55] preacher uhhuh well what if if I have to
[1:21:58] tell
[1:22:01] them Paul said that if you say that and
[1:22:05] you quote him then you're going to be
[1:22:08] identified with him ah you see that's
[1:22:11] the
[1:22:14] problem brother Donnie if you'd let me I
[1:22:17] could help you brother I could help you
[1:22:19] and you we can make our church so big
[1:22:22] and and and full of
[1:22:25] what full of
[1:22:30] what I'd rather have a handful that I
[1:22:32] could preach the truth to than thousands
[1:22:35] that you couldn't tell them
[1:22:39] nothing you imagine them be El to that
[1:22:42] day brother do they stood right said
[1:22:43] glory to God brother Paul said that we
[1:22:47] were chosen in him before the foundation
[1:22:49] you imagine said now wait a minute I
[1:22:51] want you to show me where Moses said
[1:22:55] that I want you to show me where Joshua
[1:22:58] said
[1:23:04] that but them elect just kept right on
[1:23:08] Roaring under the lion
[1:23:12] anointing there was a time the anointing
[1:23:15] of the men was
[1:23:17] necessary but we don't need it
[1:23:21] now
[1:23:23] amen now watch this just like the day of
[1:23:26] the lon or the ox of the man it's
[1:23:32] the it's the
[1:23:34] anointing of the
[1:23:37] hour now you see I used to preach under
[1:23:40] the man
[1:23:41] anointing I was a Pentecostal preacher
[1:23:44] so I was under that for many
[1:23:47] years the man anointed sir I didn't read
[1:23:51] no other books I didn't study no other
[1:23:53] preachers the only thing that I preached
[1:23:56] was the Bible or so I
[1:24:00] thought all I quoted was the
[1:24:03] Bible I could quote it like a machine
[1:24:06] gun I was known actually in my ranks but
[1:24:08] being able to quote
[1:24:10] it I still baptize in
[1:24:14] titles preach for women preachers
[1:24:17] preaching eternal
[1:24:20] hell why man anointed
[1:24:23] yeah the man anointing whenever Carol's
[1:24:25] Uncle tried to introduce me to water
[1:24:26] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:28] and I come back to him with some man
[1:24:30] anointing and said I'd rather do what
[1:24:32] Jesus said than what Peter
[1:24:36] said man processing it through your
[1:24:40] mind oh come on Word of
[1:24:43] Life and you see many of us do the same
[1:24:46] thing today we'll try to process it
[1:24:49] through our head your head will never be
[1:24:51] able to boot believe what your heart can
[1:24:54] believe if your head will amen the word
[1:24:57] that's good but I found out a lot of
[1:24:59] times mine won't mine will go opposite
[1:25:02] from what the word says and you know the
[1:25:04] sequence of events should be that from
[1:25:07] the heart the man believeth unto
[1:25:09] salvation and with the mouth confession
[1:25:12] is made you see when we speak from here
[1:25:15] most of the time is when we get in
[1:25:17] trouble it's okay to think from here but
[1:25:20] here's God's Divine direction or
[1:25:21] protocol call that we think from here
[1:25:24] pass it through the filter here and let
[1:25:27] it come out right here but when we think
[1:25:30] from here and go straight to here that's
[1:25:32] some of the biggest messes you ever made
[1:25:34] in your life and you might as well say
[1:25:36] Amen why because we go straight from
[1:25:39] this knad of ours straight into them big
[1:25:42] fat lips of ours and then we have to go
[1:25:45] back and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have
[1:25:47] said that I'm sorry I shouldn't have
[1:25:49] said that if we would run everything
[1:25:51] from here down to here and process it
[1:25:54] out of here a word fitly spoken is like
[1:25:57] apples of gold and pictures of silver
[1:26:00] Thou Art SN snared with thy mouth thou
[1:26:03] art snared with the words of thy mouth
[1:26:05] and thou art taken by the words of thy
[1:26:07] mouth for by thy words Thou shalt be
[1:26:10] justified and by thy words Thou shalt be
[1:26:12] condemned I wish somebody would hear me
[1:26:14] tonight and I'm afraid a lot of us are
[1:26:17] still trying to fight the devil in this
[1:26:20] last day when Satan is already on the
[1:26:23] verge of the fourth cycle of his
[1:26:25] anointing and we're St find trying to
[1:26:27] fight among cycle three there's only one
[1:26:30] way we're going to be able to withstand
[1:26:33] the power of the fourth cycle of Satan
[1:26:35] in the last days and that is the fourth
[1:26:38] cycle of God must anoint us as his
[1:26:42] people and then when we do we will be
[1:26:45] more than conquerors we will be more
[1:26:49] than able I don't care what Satan does
[1:26:52] of what he said we are anointed against
[1:26:56] [Applause]
[1:27:05] him you know how we are dealing with the
[1:27:08] passing of my daughter Erica your sister
[1:27:11] Erica Lance's wife the Parker girl's
[1:27:15] mother this is what I'm telling
[1:27:18] them we committ it to God we don't
[1:27:21] understand why
[1:27:22] we don't understand God's will but I
[1:27:25] trust him even when I don't understand
[1:27:27] you see that's my heart talking and not
[1:27:29] my head my my head is saying how in the
[1:27:32] world could that be all things work
[1:27:34] together for good them that love the
[1:27:35] Lord them which are called according to
[1:27:37] his purpose how in the world can that be
[1:27:39] for God to take a mother how in the
[1:27:40] world can that be for God to take a boy
[1:27:42] or God can take a little baby how in the
[1:27:44] world can that be don't you see what
[1:27:45] we're doing we're trying to process it
[1:27:47] through right up here but whenever you
[1:27:50] bypass that and come right down down
[1:27:52] here oh Hallelujah I'm the Lord God I'll
[1:27:55] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[1:27:57] you I tell him all the time Lord I
[1:27:59] remind you of your words that you said
[1:28:01] through Jeremiah I know the thoughts
[1:28:03] that I think toward you that they are
[1:28:06] good and they are not evil I don't
[1:28:08] understand why good the bad things
[1:28:10] happen to good people and I don't
[1:28:12] understand why real good things happen
[1:28:14] to bad people but they do but if I try
[1:28:16] to figure it out under the man anointing
[1:28:19] I will be so down I will be so weary but
[1:28:22] whenever I bypass my knucklehead and go
[1:28:25] straight to the heart my heart says my
[1:28:28] God makes no mistakes my god is perfect
[1:28:32] his ways are perfect he will work this
[1:28:35] out to his glory because he said so why
[1:28:39] then it comes to my heart out of my
[1:28:41] heart my mouth speaks
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:51] it
[1:28:55] Hallelujah so we got some message
[1:28:58] churches flying their
[1:29:04] banners and then some of them actually
[1:29:06] going this far now brother you can come
[1:29:09] preach for us but don't read no
[1:29:13] quotes and don't mention brother bram's
[1:29:18] name I'll tell you one thing a preacher
[1:29:20] tells me that neither me or Jesus is
[1:29:23] going to show
[1:29:27] up if this word ain't welcome I ain't
[1:29:31] either I don't want to be identified in
[1:29:33] that come on now don't get quiet on me I
[1:29:35] know this shocks some of you all you say
[1:29:38] oh my Lord you mean there's people
[1:29:39] around the message yeah that's what they
[1:29:41] are around the message why in the world
[1:29:44] would we not want to make it the Center
[1:29:46] focus of our life a Christ centered life
[1:29:49] under the eagle anointing that's what's
[1:29:51] going to get us out of here friend if
[1:29:53] it's not it what hope do we have is time
[1:29:56] going to go on and on and on there's got
[1:29:58] to be a Breaking of the cycle four
[1:30:00] breaks the cycle Hallelujah four breaks
[1:30:04] the cycle we're living in the age when
[1:30:07] the cycle of death is going to be
[1:30:09] destroyed when the dead in Christ shall
[1:30:11] rise first and we which are alive and
[1:30:14] remain are going to be called up to meet
[1:30:16] the Lord in the air how we going to do
[1:30:18] it under the man anointed no how we
[1:30:21] going to do under the ox under the
[1:30:23] Flying Eagle under the Flying
[1:30:26] [Applause]
[1:30:34] Eagle praise
[1:30:37] God it's Eagle time it it's the
[1:30:41] anointing of the hour it's the time that
[1:30:45] we're living in it's the working of the
[1:30:47] holy spirit for this particular time to
[1:30:50] prove that Jesus is not
[1:30:55] dead the things that he said he would do
[1:30:58] just before the evening lights went
[1:31:05] out so people feel like they can be sort
[1:31:09] of you know just kind of straddling
[1:31:12] between three and
[1:31:16] four well you
[1:31:18] know we we want to go in the Rapture but
[1:31:21] that we don't want to be reproached the
[1:31:23] way you know brother Donnie no I'll tell
[1:31:25] you now him and some of them other guys
[1:31:26] nah there's got to be a there's got to
[1:31:29] be a way of more wisdom you mean
[1:31:34] cowardly more
[1:31:36] cowardly so I'm supposed to know the
[1:31:39] truth and to keep YouTube from Banning
[1:31:42] us I'm not supposed to tell you
[1:31:45] all and I'm not supposed to tell the
[1:31:47] thousands of people who stream us from
[1:31:49] around the world I'm just is supposed to
[1:31:52] hold that truth to
[1:31:54] me so does that mean I'm the only one
[1:31:56] going to the Rapture then and y'all's
[1:31:58] going to be left behind because I didn't
[1:31:59] tell you the truth no I won't be going
[1:32:01] either because he going to whoop the
[1:32:02] fire of me cuz I didn't tell you the
[1:32:06] truth so I figure the best thing to do
[1:32:08] is preaching the truth preaching the
[1:32:11] truth under the eagle anointing you
[1:32:13] decide if you want to go or not if you
[1:32:16] want to stay here with the men get under
[1:32:18] the men anointing but if you want to
[1:32:20] leave with the e ghost come on over
[1:32:24] brother oh Hallelujah come on young
[1:32:27] people come on sisters let's move under
[1:32:30] the anointing of the eagle in the last
[1:32:33] day hallelujah what is it the power of
[1:32:37] the resurrected Lord
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:49] Jesus I love this in the used to S as it
[1:32:52] was in the days of lot so will it be in
[1:32:55] the
[1:32:56] hours that the son of man will be
[1:32:58] revealed on the earth not Son of God no
[1:33:01] more son of
[1:33:04] man come
[1:33:06] back as the prophetic
[1:33:12] message don't you understand when people
[1:33:14] turn down this message whether they're
[1:33:16] in it or don't really even want to be in
[1:33:19] it to the first place they don't
[1:33:21] understand who who they're turning
[1:33:27] down I had someone to write me the other
[1:33:29] day and said this leaving the message
[1:33:31] after 30 some
[1:33:33] years and I wanted to get in a
[1:33:35] discussion with the
[1:33:37] man and ask him since you say you're
[1:33:40] leaving the message what does that mean
[1:33:42] exactly the message teaches salvation by
[1:33:45] the blood you believe in that the
[1:33:47] message teaches justification by faith
[1:33:50] you believe in that the message teaches
[1:33:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you leave
[1:33:54] in that the message teaches water
[1:33:56] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:58] you leave in that the message teaches
[1:34:00] all kinds of things that are scripture
[1:34:02] over and over and over again so when
[1:34:04] people claim they're leaving the message
[1:34:05] are they leaving that it's evident some
[1:34:07] of them
[1:34:08] did cuz they went back and baptized in
[1:34:10] titles under what the anointing of a
[1:34:14] man why because Matthew stood at that
[1:34:17] gate and said I'm guarding the
[1:34:20] name I'm guarding the name but the elect
[1:34:24] come up to the gate and said out of my
[1:34:25] way Matthew I don't know what that name
[1:34:28] is you ain't keeping me away from that
[1:34:30] name Oh Glory to God you ain't keeping
[1:34:33] me away from that name now luk don't you
[1:34:36] try to keep me out John don't you try to
[1:34:38] keep me out that gate might have been
[1:34:40] put there to keep some people out it
[1:34:42] wasn't put there to keep me out it was
[1:34:44] there to try my faith and my faith says
[1:34:47] there is one God hallelujah here oh
[1:34:50] Israel the Lord our God is one unto thee
[1:34:53] it was shown that thou mightest know
[1:34:55] that the Lord he is God and God himself
[1:34:58] said is there any other God beside me I
[1:35:01] know not one I know not one you ain't
[1:35:05] keeping me out
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:13] John but us learned Theologian will set
[1:35:16] in his
[1:35:20] study and they the Greek
[1:35:23] Scholars trying to understand the dip
[1:35:26] thong of the condominium of the m
[1:35:32] recular and we're just sitting there
[1:35:34] saying what' he
[1:35:39] [Laughter]
[1:35:42] say I'm glad the Bible tells me the
[1:35:45] Common People heard him
[1:35:50] gladly
[1:35:53] notice this the son of man will come
[1:35:55] back as the prophetic message for the
[1:35:57] last day when that
[1:36:00] eagle will be
[1:36:03] flying not the lion not the ox and the
[1:36:06] sacrifice age paragraph 186 but in the
[1:36:10] last message that went forth there came
[1:36:14] a flying
[1:36:15] eagle it's Eagle
[1:36:18] time reveal time
[1:36:25] reveal time so not shut up
[1:36:28] time not well we we just can't
[1:36:31] understand it no it's reveal time as I
[1:36:34] told you here Sunday the world is

[1:39:05] said I'm going to set this box up here
[1:39:08] to represent that if God sends a certain
[1:39:13] Spirit among them that's the only thing
[1:39:16] that they can work
[1:39:20] by amen don't you understand I can't do
[1:39:24] nothing no
[1:39:26] different amen
[1:39:29] amen cuz different people could tell you
[1:39:32] I've tried to reason with brother Donnie
[1:39:35] I've tried to tell him you'd have more
[1:39:37] friends and you'd be you know use a
[1:39:39] little wisdom except I've found out for
[1:39:42] a lot of them when they use the word
[1:39:43] wisdom it has two different
[1:39:46] spellings because when they get done
[1:39:49] trying to explain to me wisdom I spell
[1:39:51] spell it c o m p r o m i s e
[1:39:57] compromise which ain't wisdom at all
[1:40:00] come on now Saints well I've tried to
[1:40:02] tell him you you just can't tell him
[1:40:04] it's it's like there's a power that
[1:40:06] drives him
[1:40:08] amen there's a power that drives me to
[1:40:11] tell you tonight rep it and be baptized
[1:40:15] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:40:17] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:40:20] the Holy Ghost it will give you power
[1:40:23] over all the powers of the enemy and
[1:40:25] nothing shall by any means hurt you but
[1:40:29] Brother Don even now even now but there
[1:40:32] never been so dark and the light ought
[1:40:35] to shine brighter now than it's ever
[1:40:36] shine
[1:40:46] before when I was under the man
[1:40:49] anointing I operated Ed and gave my
[1:40:53] best I preached like a Pentecostal I was
[1:40:56] deding the
[1:40:57] wool I run I screamed I hollered I
[1:41:02] shouted I run the backs of the
[1:41:05] pews I'd start hearing run the back
[1:41:07] sideway jump off the back and start back
[1:41:09] this way and run back the other way now
[1:41:11] you
[1:41:13] try don't you point your finger me and
[1:41:15] tell me to cuz I ain't going to do it
[1:41:18] either this Eagle would I doubt I get
[1:41:21] past brother John I'd be laying down on
[1:41:22] the floor y'all be burying me next
[1:41:24] week but what was it a season an
[1:41:29] anointing oh my and some of the things
[1:41:32] that we did you think what's out of our
[1:41:35] minds I remember one night up down the
[1:41:37] Duvall Valley preaching her and caring
[1:41:39] knows where it's at and I got under the
[1:41:40] anointing I reached down they had a
[1:41:42] glass of water setting I reached down
[1:41:43] put my fingers in that water and I
[1:41:45] started throwing that water all over
[1:41:47] people people started falling out they
[1:41:49] started shouting they like to tore that
[1:41:51] building down what do it mean brother
[1:41:54] Donnie I got them
[1:41:56] wet other than that I'm not
[1:41:59] sure what was it a man
[1:42:02] anointing come on now all dripping out
[1:42:05] of people's hands this going on that
[1:42:07] going on and the prophet identified it
[1:42:10] that was not what the word said they do
[1:42:12] what was it man well if it worked
[1:42:14] tonight I was going to try it again
[1:42:16] tomorrow night and if it didn't work
[1:42:17] tomorrow night I'd try it the next night
[1:42:19] why was the man anointing it did not
[1:42:22] have the understanding of an eagle you
[1:42:24] might shout tonight and you might cry
[1:42:26] for the next three weeks when you go to
[1:42:28] church but the important thing is follow
[1:42:30] the spirit of
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:42] God and you better believe you s Brother
[1:42:45] Louis hard on you all trying to get you
[1:42:47] to get in the service you ought have
[1:42:50] been under the the influence of some of
[1:42:51] our Pentecostal song leaders and I used
[1:42:54] to be a song leader and if you didn't
[1:42:56] move I would move you or I'd embarrass
[1:42:58] you one you was either going to clap
[1:43:01] your hands you was going to move you
[1:43:02] wern't going to stand there like a dead
[1:43:03] up dead dried up message stick the way
[1:43:06] some of our stand there in this day what
[1:43:08] was it anointing of the man and did it
[1:43:11] move them yeah got him emotional got him
[1:43:13] worked up but did it change a lot of
[1:43:15] them two weeks time they'd be right back
[1:43:17] out there doing the same thing they were
[1:43:18] before and that's what makes me about
[1:43:21] some of our own ranks I see the same
[1:43:23] things repeating her that we saw back
[1:43:27] Yonder
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:32] good but there's another Scout it's the
[1:43:39] scream of a mighty eagle get ready
[1:43:43] children Mount up on the wings of an
[1:43:47] eagle how can we conquer death if if we
[1:43:51] cannot conquer
[1:43:52] pornography how can we conquer death if
[1:43:56] we cannot conquer somebody talking about
[1:43:58] us in M we're mad enough to bust them in
[1:44:00] the mouth and you're fixing to change
[1:44:02] your
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:10] body dear
[1:44:13] Jesus let me find a place to close
[1:44:16] here that's the only thing that they can
[1:44:19] work by is the spirit that works among
[1:44:21] them now we'll prove that to you by the
[1:44:23] history of the church by the opening of
[1:44:26] the seals and the
[1:44:28] powers that let
[1:44:31] loose now we emphasize so much on the
[1:44:34] mechanics which is the doctrine the
[1:44:36] labor of the word but remember it always
[1:44:38] comes in part A and Part B mechanics and
[1:44:43] Dynamics and when God gives a promise or
[1:44:47] God gives a commandment there's a power
[1:44:50] to be released out of that commandment
[1:44:52] to give us the ability to live what he
[1:44:54] said
[1:44:56] amen amen absolutely and talking to my
[1:45:00] family with the passing of Erica these
[1:45:03] are the things for those that have asked
[1:45:04] me wanted to know how to deal with it
[1:45:07] this is the direction that I have led
[1:45:10] them that if God's will demands
[1:45:14] something of us even though he knows it
[1:45:17] will break our
[1:45:19] hearts he has an anointing and a power
[1:45:24] sir to release out of that will promise
[1:45:27] in order to help us to deal with it I've
[1:45:29] seen it so many times that the will of
[1:45:32] God will come in people's lives and they
[1:45:33] argue and they question and they debate
[1:45:36] and they go on and on and on and on and
[1:45:38] this not they never allow God to release
[1:45:42] the power out of that will I don't mind
[1:45:44] telling you sometimes the will of God is
[1:45:46] so painful is it not all those parts of
[1:45:50] the will of god brother Timothy That's
[1:45:51] So Glorious I told Carol day before
[1:45:53] yesterday I said think of it Carol I
[1:45:55] said if the Lord would have raised up
[1:45:57] Erica out of that hospital in Sycamore
[1:45:59] shs if she would have laid there and an
[1:46:01] absolute Miracle would have transpired
[1:46:04] we would still be talking about it we'd
[1:46:06] still be praising God we' be everybody
[1:46:09] that would meet in Walmart and wherever
[1:46:10] we'd try to bring it up in a
[1:46:12] conversation to tell oh you'd not
[1:46:13] believe what I God done I said but why
[1:46:15] are we this way why are we so sadden and
[1:46:18] yet if it's the will of God for her to
[1:46:21] go that way you believe what you want to
[1:46:23] I do not believe Satan can take us until
[1:46:25] God is finished with us do I understand
[1:46:28] it I do not understand it does that me
[1:46:30] the broken place in my heart it does not
[1:46:33] but I believe if it's the will of God he
[1:46:36] will release a power to Erica's family
[1:46:39] to Erica's church family to Erica's
[1:46:42] friends that will help us deal with the
[1:46:44] will of God he would not be God if he
[1:46:47] doesn't do it he releases an anoint
[1:46:50] anointing that helps us I believe he
[1:46:53] releases an anointing for the bride to
[1:46:56] live under in this last day Victorious
[1:47:00] above
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:19] sin
[1:47:20] God will not tell you to
[1:47:23] forgive and to love your
[1:47:26] enemies if he does not also provide a
[1:47:30] power with that
[1:47:32] commandment to help you do it but it's
[1:47:35] like any other promise of God you have
[1:47:38] to receive
[1:47:44] it
[1:47:47] hallelujah
[1:47:49] hallelujah
[1:47:51] there's not just theology that comes
[1:47:53] with this
[1:47:54] message there's
[1:47:57] power our sisters can dress like they
[1:48:00] ought to they can dress decently they
[1:48:02] can just say you know what I'm I'm I'm
[1:48:04] not going to dress like the world still
[1:48:06] don't mean they had the power of God to
[1:48:07] do it because many of them have traded
[1:48:09] it off we know that some of the men can
[1:48:10] do the same thing but if it's been
[1:48:13] released to you that it's not just a
[1:48:15] quote it's not just a scripture but the
[1:48:17] promise of God the box of the age
[1:48:21] a
[1:48:22] box so what what do you use a box for it
[1:48:26] contains
[1:48:30] something but you have to open it and
[1:48:33] release whatever's on the
[1:48:37] inside well said brother Donnie I've
[1:48:39] tried I've tried I've got self-help
[1:48:40] books I've got apps on my phone I've got
[1:48:43] positive confessions I've got this out
[1:48:44] the other all that is good but that's
[1:48:48] mechanics but you need to to tell father
[1:48:51] father I need the power out of this
[1:48:54] promise I need the power to to empower
[1:48:58] me how in the world could
[1:49:01] women that were
[1:49:05] pregnant and under the anointing of
[1:49:08] their
[1:49:09] age them soldiers would take swords and
[1:49:12] rip their bellies wide open and cut that
[1:49:15] baby from that Mother's belly and dash
[1:49:18] its brains out on
[1:49:21] rocks them men watch their wives be
[1:49:24] ripped
[1:49:26] open their children
[1:49:29] burnt you remember me reading to you
[1:49:31] telling you years ago about Sosa sister
[1:49:36] Sosa having seven sons and every one of
[1:49:40] them martyred for the cause of the Lord
[1:49:44] Jesus if God did not release to our
[1:49:47] sister the anointing out of the box for
[1:49:51] her age she would have become so
[1:49:54] resentful to God and you claim you're a
[1:49:58] god of love a god of
[1:50:02] Mercy you imagine sister Sosa coming
[1:50:05] back to
[1:50:06] church maybe the Pastor said we're going
[1:50:09] to have a Thanksgiving
[1:50:11] night we're going to read and we're
[1:50:13] going to
[1:50:14] pray if you got a burning testimony on
[1:50:17] your heart I don't want you to be able
[1:50:18] to give that and share it with the
[1:50:19] church
[1:50:20] Church imagine everybody looking around
[1:50:24] well the Lord saved me
[1:50:26] Hallelujah I I I was an old Corinthian
[1:50:29] out there I was doing this and that and
[1:50:30] the other I really got a lot to praise

[1:50:36] since said pulls thing lost all them
[1:50:39] seven
[1:50:40] boys one of them was pulled behind
[1:50:43] horses horrific deaths just how they'
[1:50:46] done to the Jews horrific
[1:50:49] deaths
[1:50:50] imagine sister Sosa being one of the
[1:50:53] first ones glory to
[1:50:56] God can I give
[1:50:59] testimony go ahead sister
[1:51:01] sroa I want to thank the good
[1:51:04] Lord for his Mercy to

[1:51:11] boys I got to spend several years with
[1:51:14] them the Lord in his great
[1:51:17] wisdom allowed all my seven boys to go
[1:51:20] to heaven before me I just want to thank
[1:51:22] him tonight for the truth and I wanted
[1:51:25] to thank him because my hope is in Jesus

[1:51:32] boys
[1:51:33] are you imagine the rest of them saints
[1:51:35] sitting in the church God bless your
[1:51:38] heart I've been complaining about I
[1:51:40] couldn't pay my electric bill I've been
[1:51:43] complaining about this and that and
[1:51:44] other don't you understand when God will
[1:51:46] allow some of his people as I heard it
[1:51:48] said the other day God lets his greatest
[1:51:51] soldiers not get wasp
[1:51:54] stung God gives his greatest Soldiers
[1:51:58] the hardest battles
[1:52:03] yeah God will use them and out of there
[1:52:06] comes a testimony that others say praise
[1:52:09] God if she can go through that and have
[1:52:11] Victory I can face what I'm going
[1:52:14] through how did they do that brother
[1:52:16] Daryl the box was opened amen and the
[1:52:20] anointing sister Sosa probably thought

[1:54:00] hardly a
[1:54:02] year should we change our Banner that
[1:54:05] we're you know we're just trying to use
[1:54:07] wisdom and we're not going to quite be
[1:54:09] as tough and and we're you know we're
[1:54:11] going to believe certain things but I
[1:54:13] just get the ministers together now
[1:54:15] Brothers you know we're we're concerned
[1:54:17] about really kind of filling this place
[1:54:18] up and don't preach no more on this and
[1:54:20] Don't Preach no more on that and and uh
[1:54:23] let's let's just let's just kind of hold
[1:54:27] up and we'll reach up and take that
[1:54:29] standard of holess

[1:55:12] and yall will put in someone else or
[1:55:14] your children
[1:55:16] will wonder what a kind of man they look
[1:55:19] for
[1:55:20] will it be one that still stands under
[1:55:23] that
[1:55:25] Banner will it be one of more of a
[1:55:27] modernistic
[1:55:31] taste I hope
[1:55:34] not I hope not I hope as long as it's
[1:55:37] here it stands for the Gospel of Jesus
[1:55:41] Christ and the power of his resurrection
[1:55:44] and his changing
[1:55:46] power can we bow our
[1:55:48] heads

[1:56:32] it anyone else here tonight like to be
[1:56:35] remembered God help me that I'll never
[1:56:37] leave the ranks of where you've placed

[1:56:43] trustees those of you that are streaming
[1:56:46] tonight may God help us that we'll be at
[1:56:49] our post most I Ain talking about just
[1:56:51] this church building I'm talking about
[1:56:53] in Christ
[1:56:56] Jesus heavenly father as we bow our
[1:56:59] heads to the dust of the earth
[1:57:01] Lord we're asking you tonight Jesus that
[1:57:04] you would help
[1:57:06] us Lord we know that as the world is
[1:57:10] calling for Israel to have a ceas fire
[1:57:13] and we know if they ever give in they
[1:57:15] give three days then they'll want five
[1:57:17] then they'll want seven then they'll
[1:57:19] want 10 and every day they take off
[1:57:22] their enemy is regrouping and it's going
[1:57:25] to cost them more lives more Israeli
[1:57:29] soldiers will
[1:57:31] die but that's the voice of the world
[1:57:34] and yet this little tiny State about the
[1:57:37] size of New Jersey sets there and
[1:57:40] basically the whole world against it so
[1:57:43] far America still standing with her and
[1:57:46] not forcing the
[1:57:48] ceasefire same with us people wants us
[1:57:51] to ceasefire quit preaching this quit
[1:57:53] preaching that quit preaching something
[1:57:57] else and what if we obey them
[1:58:00] Lord what will our church turn
[1:58:03] into theirs
[1:58:06] exactly and I look at some of them
[1:58:08] voices that want us to quit preaching
[1:58:10] this and that and I look at what their
[1:58:12] church is and I say no that's not what I
[1:58:16] want our church to
[1:58:18] be I want our church to be a church to
[1:58:21] where Sinners can come in and be set
[1:58:23] free by the power of God where people
[1:58:26] can be delivered of demon
[1:58:29] spirits and Men of God that are so
[1:58:31] Anointed with the Holy Ghost can speak
[1:58:34] to them evil spirits and they'll come
[1:58:37] out where people can receive the Holy
[1:58:40] Ghost where people can be
[1:58:42] healed and people's lives can be
[1:58:46] changed and then the the call will come
[1:58:50] and we'll be changed out of this world
[1:58:52] we know this it's not by signs only but
[1:58:54] it's by the preaching of the word of God
[1:58:57] help us father I don't know how many
