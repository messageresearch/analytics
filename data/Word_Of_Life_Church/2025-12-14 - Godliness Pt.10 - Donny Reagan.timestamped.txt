[10:00] that could be here. I know there's
[10:02] there's others that would love to be
[10:03] here, but the weather has kind of messed
[10:06] things up for him. So, but we're glad
[10:09] that that you're here this morning. Most
[10:11] of all, we're glad that the Lord is
[10:12] here. Without him, it don't matter who's
[10:15] here, right? But with him, we'll just
[10:17] have a real real good time. Do you love

[10:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're visiting with
[10:33] us today, we want to say we welcome you
[10:35] to the service. Brother Brad, Sister
[10:37] Sarah, glad to see you all with us at
[10:39] the service today. You're not visiting,
[10:41] you're just home for a while, right? But
[10:43] Brother Brad will be leading us to the
[10:45] Lord in prayer this morning on behalf of
[10:46] our prayer request. Any other visitor
[10:48] that we may have, we want to say we
[10:50] welcome you. Glad to have you here. All
[10:52] of our streamers locally and around the
[10:54] world, we want this service to be a
[10:56] blessing to them, too. Right? Say, "God
[10:58] bless all of those folks."
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to
[11:03] look at her prayer request this morning.
[11:05] Uh Sister Janet Payne, uh first first
[11:08] and foremost, she says she wants to
[11:10] thank the Lord for healing her heart.
[11:12] It's no longer in AIB, and she praises
[11:14] the Lord for that. Amen. Thank the Lord.
[11:19] Well, he's a heart healer. He's a heart
[11:21] mener. Amen. Brother Roger and sister
[11:25] Sue Miller, uh they're requesting prayer
[11:28] for their daughter-in-law. She's been
[11:30] told that the bones in her right foot
[11:32] are completely crushed and she's not uh
[11:36] been able to put any any weight on it at
[11:38] all. Surgery is not an option since it
[11:41] is so bad. We know that God can put
[11:43] every bone back into place and would
[11:46] appreciate your prayers. also keep our
[11:48] son in prayer since this has put a lot
[11:50] of responsibility on him. So we
[11:52] certainly want to pray for that need
[11:53] today. The Lord would be mindful of that
[11:55] lady. Prayer for sister Shirley Robbins.
[11:58] A lot of pain in her back. So let's
[12:00] remember her today as we pray that the
[12:02] Lord would touch her.
[12:05] Brother Sister Baker, they're both not
[12:08] uh feeling well this morning. Ask for
[12:10] prayer. So we will remember those folks
[12:12] as we pray. want to pray for a Suzanne
[12:15] car. Uh
[12:18] severe health situations the Lord knows
[12:20] all about. I believe she's from over in
[12:22] Canada. So, we certainly want to
[12:24] remember that prayer request this
[12:25] morning. The Lord would be mindful of
[12:27] that. Want to pray for Autumn Hughes has
[12:30] to go uh for an ultrasound. They're
[12:33] suspecting something wrong with her
[12:35] pancreas or her gallbladder. So, they're
[12:37] asking we would remember her in prayer
[12:39] today. As we pray uh for a past
[12:43] coworker, friend dealing with thoughts
[12:46] of suicide and depression, needs the
[12:48] Lord in his life. Brother Chase Hughes
[12:50] sends that in. So, let's remember that
[12:52] as we pray today. Sister Jessica Bracken
[12:56] is asking for prayers for her uh a legal
[13:00] situation for for her son. So, they're
[13:02] asking that we would remember that
[13:03] situation today. Sister Ruth Louise Jax
[13:06] is asking for continued prayers about
[13:08] the situation near her home and for
[13:11] healing in her body. Let's remember that
[13:13] this morning as we pray. Charles Anon
[13:16] sends his healing prayer for April
[13:18] Wiser. Also traveling mercies for Mary
[13:22] and Brandy Anon. We just commit that
[13:24] unto the Lord. Ask God to move on that
[13:26] behalf. Brother Keith Phillips says uh
[13:29] he had root canal surgery this past
[13:31] week. It was rough, but the Lord brought
[13:33] him through. Thank you for your prayers.
[13:35] He has a crown put on Tuesday. So just
[13:38] continue to pray for brother Keith this
[13:39] morning. Brother Joel Brown is
[13:41] requesting prayer for a friend by the
[13:43] name of Leah Moore. She is suffering
[13:45] from blood pressure issues and it is
[13:48] adversely impacting her health. Please
[13:50] pray that God will move on her behalf.
[13:52] So let's remember that today as we pray.
[13:55] Brother Glenn Tamlinson, this is a
[13:57] prayer request for me. I put in a couple
[13:59] them earlier today or should I say last
[14:02] night. While I'm in the ER at the
[14:03] hospital, they're trying to get my blood
[14:05] pressure stabilized. They're probably
[14:07] going to be admitting me and just ask
[14:09] for prayer that the Lord would be
[14:11] completely in charge and that the blood
[14:13] pressure would stabilize. Also dealing
[14:16] with congestion from a very bad cold
[14:18] that I've had for over two weeks. So,
[14:20] I'm asking for prayer that for that as
[14:23] well. And uh he just wants to thank you
[14:27] for your prayers and may God bless you
[14:29] all. So, we want to remember that prayer
[14:30] request this morning. all the unspoken
[14:32] prayer requests. I know there's
[14:34] tremendous needs in our assembly today.
[14:36] So, we want to remember those needs as
[14:38] we pray. Uh a couple of announcements
[14:41] for Christmas cards from brother Donnie
[14:43] and sister Carol. They're available in
[14:45] the library, one per family until
[14:48] further notice. So, remember that if you
[14:49] want to go by and get those, they have
[14:51] those in the library for you. Uh we will
[14:54] be having a special service on Saturday,
[14:56] December the 27th that will include
[15:00] communion and footwashing. The service
[15:02] will begin at 6:00 p.m. So remember
[15:04] that.
[15:06] And of course, I think most of you are
[15:08] aware there will not be any service on
[15:10] 12 uh 24 this year. Uh so let's remember
[15:14] all these announcements. God's good,
[15:16] isn't he?
[15:17] &gt;&gt; You love him with all your heart this
[15:18] morning.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I love you."
[15:21] Somebody say, "I'm glad he loves me."
[15:24] Praise the Lord. Let's sing just a tad
[15:26] bit more of that song as Brother Brad
[15:28] comes. If you will stand with me, would
[15:30] you commit these things unto the Lord?
[15:32] Oh, there is power,
[15:35] power,
[15:36] wonder working power in the blood
[15:42] of the lamb.
[15:44] Oh yes, there's power,
[15:47] power,
[15:48] wonder working power in the preious
[15:53] blood of the lamb.
[15:56] Oh, there is power,
[15:59] power.
[16:13] were wondering power in the preious
[16:18] blood of the lamb.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for the power?
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Power in the blood.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; We'll sing greetings from brother Jason
[16:29] in the church there in Bethl Tabernacle.
[16:32] We're happy to be here. It's cold.
[16:36] We're freezing. But be will be leaving a
[16:39] little while back south.
[16:42] Let's go before him in prayer. Remember
[16:44] all these requests.
[16:46] Heavenly Father, Lord, we always want to
[16:49] thank you first, Lord, for an

[17:14] Father. Lord, these requests in my

[18:23] right mind to come to the house of God.
[18:25] Aren't you glad for that? the blessings
[18:27] of the Lord that we take for granted so
[18:29] many times. He blesses us in so many
[18:32] ways that we don't even we don't even
[18:33] think about. He protects us so many
[18:36] times we're not even aware of. I

[18:40] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate a God that will correct
[18:42] us from his word and tell us to
[18:44] straighten up and get our lives right. I
[18:46] appreciate that. Don't you?
[18:48] &gt;&gt; A lot of people gets mad. They like
[18:49] these feel-good churches and that God
[18:51] bless them if that's what they want to
[18:52] do. That's their business. But I'm glad
[18:55] we come to a house of correction. Aren't

[38:06] v home
[38:10] and searching for a king. But finding a
[38:16] child, no crown, no throne,
[38:22] still they
[38:24] bow
[38:26] down.
[38:29] Come, let's
[38:31] adore
[38:33] him. Oh come, let us adore
[38:39] him. Oh come let us adore
[38:45] him.
[38:53] Turn to my story.
[39:01] For nothing was like anything
[39:07] they dreamed,
[39:13] anticipating
[39:16] the royal
[39:18] and those honored by this word.
[39:25] Instead they gazed in the aruck eyes of
[39:31] a lonely
[39:33] hes and earth
[39:38] holding
[39:41] her
[39:42] child.
[39:46] Come let us adore
[39:50] him. Oh come let us adore
[39:56] him. Oh come let us adore
[40:02] him.
[40:29] The brilliant gold, the fragrant bird,
[40:36] the costly fra naked sins
[40:42] place
[40:44] be
[40:48] him.
[40:52] Come let us adore
[40:56] him. Oh come let us adore
[41:02] him. Oh come let us adore
[41:08] him
[41:14] Christ.
[42:02] Amen. Amen.
[42:09] Amen. Let's stand together if you will.
[42:10] It's time to go on into the service. You
[42:13] know the
[42:14] the day or the night when our Lord was
[42:17] born. Brother Brandham said he was born
[42:19] over a a manure pile. There's no room
[42:22] for him nowhere. They didn't have room
[42:25] for him then. They don't have room for
[42:27] him today neither. But I'm glad because
[42:29] he lives. We can face tomorrow. Because
[42:33] he lives, not because something you've
[42:35] done or I done. It's because he lives we
[42:37] can face tomorrow. Give him another good
[42:39] hand clap of praise. It's because he
[42:44] lives
[42:48] I can face
[42:51] tomorrow.
[42:55] And because he lives,
[43:01] all our fears are gone.
[43:06] Say it now.
[43:17] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[43:18] because you live. And our life is worth
[43:24] the living
[43:26] just because
[43:29] he lives. One more time with all your
[43:32] heart. Oh, it's because
[43:36] he lives.
[43:51] Let's sing it together. All fear
[43:54] is gone.
[43:59] He calls my Lord.
[44:05] Oh yes, Lord. He holds my future
[44:12] and life is worth the living
[44:18] just because
[44:21] he lives.
[44:25] Praise the Lord. Isn't it a wonderful
[44:28] privilege to be gathered together again
[44:29] here today in the presence of God?
[44:32] Wonder how many has a prayer request on
[44:34] your heart. We're going to pray over the
[44:36] word and got a couple of prayer calls
[44:39] here. Um, Sister Sue Miller's
[44:43] daughter-in-law,
[44:44] um, Brother Louie may have already
[44:46] mentioned it, but really in the need of
[44:48] prayer. Sister Bean also has
[44:52] a need of prayer and a request.
[44:55] It's one thing that we so love about our
[44:57] Lord Jesus.
[44:59] Whether your need would be so small and
[45:02] insignificant compared to others or so
[45:05] large that it would seem nearly
[45:07] impossible,
[45:08] but he can take care of every one of
[45:10] them.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; And he believes it with all your heart.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads together.
[45:17] Lord Jesus, as we approach you today,
[45:19] Father, we we are thankful for this
[45:22] privilege and opportunity. And we're
[45:24] grateful, Lord, that we have a desire to
[45:26] gather together like this, not just at
[45:30] Christmas time,
[45:32] not just at Easter time and special
[45:34] occasions, but really to your children,
[45:38] for those who are truly born again.
[45:41] Coming to church itself is such a
[45:43] special occasion because we get to see
[45:47] each other, fellowship with each other,
[45:49] worship together and Lord God, but most
[45:52] importantly from you. We want to say
[45:55] that we thank you for coming to our
[45:58] world to take part of our sufferings and
[46:03] our humanity.
[46:05] We are indeed grateful, Lord Jesus.
[46:08] Father, as I hold in my hand today these
[46:10] prayer calls, you see these needs and
[46:12] Lord God, they need you to move for them
[46:15] and help them. You saw the hands that
[46:18] were uplifted here today, Father, and no
[46:20] doubt many at home today. I know
[46:22] different ones are sick and couldn't be
[46:24] here and their hand also went up. So, we
[46:27] pray that you'd go there and be mindful
[46:29] of them as well. Dear God, we're
[46:32] believing you today that you would speak
[46:34] to us. We have been invited to your
[46:37] table. And as any father who had the
[46:40] ability would spread forth
[46:44] delicacies and fine culinary artistry,
[46:48] oh, we believe nobody can prepare for us
[46:51] like our father can. So, as we've
[46:53] assembled here today, we pray that you'd
[46:56] minister to us. We've come to be helped
[46:58] and encouraged. Yes. But we've also come
[47:01] to here where we can move up and where
[47:04] we can be more consecrated to you. So
[47:08] help us today. I pray. Father, anoint
[47:11] me, Lord. Help me to get out of the way.
[47:13] I pray in the name of Jesus. And the
[47:16] saints said,
[47:17] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; How many appreciates the opportunity of
[47:20] getting to come to church? Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; I saw this week on a documentary about
[47:26] church and going to church. Just in the
[47:29] year um 2025,
[47:33] there have already been 15,000
[47:37] churches in America that have shut down.
[47:44] 15,000
[47:48] because people don't believe they need
[47:51] to go to church anymore or they're too
[47:53] busy or they got too much going on or
[47:56] whatever. And I thought, how sad. And
[48:00] they were showing some of the great mega
[48:02] churches in America and all the
[48:05] different, you know, 10,000, 12,000,
[48:08] 17,000
[48:10] and showing the inside of them basically
[48:12] empty, buildings shut down.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Well, the scripture tells us that that
[48:18] would come, doesn't it?
[48:20] &gt;&gt; But I'm grateful that we have a desire
[48:22] to still obey God's word and come
[48:25] together. Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Read with me if you would second Peter
[48:29] 1:2.
[48:32] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[48:34] through the knowledge of God and of
[48:36] Jesus
[48:38] our Lord.
[48:40] According as his divine power, I want
[48:43] you to notice what Peter attributes this
[48:45] to. It's not just the knowledge of God
[48:49] or an understanding of God, but his
[48:52] divine power hath given us unto us all
[48:56] things that pertain unto life and
[48:59] godliness,
[49:01] through the knowledge of him that hath
[49:03] called us unto glory and virtue, and
[49:06] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[49:08] great and precious promises,
[49:12] that by these you might be partakers of
[49:15] the divine nature.
[49:17] Having escaped the corruption that is in
[49:19] the world through lust.
[49:22] Beside this, giving all diligence, add
[49:24] to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[49:27] knowledge, and to knowledge temperance,
[49:30] to temperance patience, to patience
[49:34] godliness, and to godliness brotherly
[49:36] kindness, and to brotherly kindness,
[49:39] charity. May the Lord add blessings to
[49:42] the reading of his word. You may be
[49:43] seated.
[49:48] So this great virtue called godliness
[49:52] which simply means to be like God.
[49:59] Can God Almighty
[50:01] expect human beings that are born in sin
[50:06] to ever have any traits or
[50:09] characteristics like him in this life?
[50:14] Aren't we all marred? Aren't we all uh
[50:17] faulty and flawed? Yes, by birth we are.
[50:22] But Peter didn't say because of what we
[50:25] had done. But he said that by these
[50:28] these divine promises, you might be
[50:30] partakers of what? Your father's nature,
[50:34] your mother's nature. No, of the divine
[50:37] nature. And of course, we know this is
[50:40] why the Lord Jesus come to the earth was
[50:42] that we might be able to be partakers of
[50:45] the divine nature. Does it include dos
[50:47] and don'ts? It does. God's word always
[50:51] has things that he wants us to do,
[50:53] things he wants us to refrain from
[50:55] doing. But it all depends upon the
[50:57] source of how a person looks at it. Some
[51:00] people look at it, okay, just tell me
[51:02] what I got to do to get there. Tell me
[51:03] the minimum. give me the MDR, minimum
[51:06] daily requirement, and tell me what I've
[51:08] got to do and just I'll do that. I don't
[51:09] want to do any extra. I want to make it
[51:11] in. I don't want to be lost. I don't
[51:13] want to go to hell. Um, you know, we
[51:15] realize there's something wrong with
[51:17] that person's foundation when they look
[51:18] at it that way. Everything that he gave
[51:21] for us, if he demanded everything that
[51:23] you and I are and everything that we
[51:26] have, it would still be nothing in
[51:29] compared to the price he paid that we
[51:32] could even be saved. Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Saved, much less to be
[51:37] godly, to be like God. So, we know when
[51:40] our Lord Jesus was here on the earth,
[51:42] that he was the first one that was ever
[51:44] able to express godliness to this
[51:47] degree. The righteous people in the Old
[51:49] Testament, and there were some, the
[51:51] prophets, the judges, different ones,
[51:53] they were able to do certain things. God
[51:55] attributed righteousness to Abraham
[51:58] because of his faith. But it wasn't
[52:00] faith alone. Abraham had to do certain
[52:02] things. You imagine an old man and God
[52:05] tells him to be circumcised. Wow, that's
[52:08] quite a demand. And he not only has to
[52:10] be circumcised himself, but he has to
[52:13] circumcise all those in his household,
[52:15] all of his servants. And it's going to
[52:17] be an identification down through the
[52:18] age. So faith is absolutely what we
[52:22] believe. Works are the things that we do
[52:24] back in answer to what God has done for
[52:27] us. And the Lord Jesus when he comes on
[52:30] the earth, he's the first one to be able
[52:32] to express this. So as Paul says, for
[52:34] without controversy, great is the
[52:36] mystery of godliness. For God was
[52:38] manifest in the flesh, justified in the
[52:40] spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[52:43] the Gentiles, received up unto glory. So
[52:45] it was God in the form of humanity. So
[52:49] he got sick, he got weary, he dealt with
[52:51] all kinds of human disappointments just
[52:53] like we do. And yet the Bible says he
[52:56] was without sin. And in that part, we
[52:59] could say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. We we
[53:00] can we can reckon that. We can
[53:02] understand that was him." But he was
[53:03] born of a virgin and we're not exactly
[53:06] right. But it's not our natural birth
[53:08] that makes us holy anyway. You
[53:11] understand? It's not our natural birth.
[53:13] It is not our association with this
[53:15] church. You can quote your Bible from
[53:17] Genesis to Revelation and still be as
[53:20] lost as you could be
[53:22] &gt;&gt; because it's not just knowing about God
[53:24] in the head. It's experiencing God and
[53:27] your soul. So the Lord Jesus comes that
[53:30] he might be able to give to us of his
[53:33] own divine nature and that we could be
[53:35] partakers unlike the people that Paul
[53:38] wrote about in the book of Hebrews. That
[53:41] we're partakers of the word of God and
[53:44] partakers of the powers of the heavens
[53:47] to come and yet wind up being lost.
[53:53] We don't want to be partakers in that
[53:55] sense. We want to be partakers of the
[53:58] divine nature. And I realize in the age
[54:00] we live in, people want God to do
[54:02] everything and them to do nothing.
[54:04] Absolutely nothing. They don't want to
[54:06] go to church. They don't have to. They
[54:07] don't want to live right. They don't
[54:08] think they have to. But they definitely
[54:10] want God to save them at the end of the
[54:12] way. Everybody's going to heaven
[54:14] anymore. You knew that. All right. Okay.
[54:16] Everybody's going to heaven. People can
[54:18] live any kind of want to live. And yet
[54:19] they die and you pre hear the preacher
[54:21] preach their funeral. Oh, they're
[54:22] walking down streets of gold. I hope
[54:24] not. Because if some of the ones you see
[54:27] in the age we're living is going to be
[54:28] there, heaven will be turned into hell
[54:30] in about a week after we get there.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Lying, adultery, all the same old filth
[54:35] that exists now. But don't worry, heaven
[54:38] does not consist of such.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; So God has has this great program.
[54:43] Notice with me in Hebrews chapter 2:1.
[54:46] So Jesus displayed godliness in the
[54:49] flesh when he was here. But he didn't
[54:52] just want to be the only one that would
[54:54] do that, but he wanted to be the first
[54:55] begotten for the dead and the firstborn
[54:57] among many brethren. Hebrews 2:11 says,
[55:00] "For both he that sanctifith and they
[55:03] who are sanctified are all of one, for
[55:07] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[55:10] them brethren." So God in his electing
[55:14] love by Christ's finished work at what
[55:17] he did at Calvary perfectly sanctifies
[55:21] his brothers into the service of
[55:24] almighty God. Now the question of course
[55:26] would be well is everybody that goes to
[55:29] church a brother of the Lord Jesus? No,
[55:31] I'm afraid not. There's only one way to
[55:34] get there. For by one spirit we're all
[55:36] baptized into that one body. Is that
[55:39] right? Three elements came out of his
[55:41] body. Water, blood, and spirit. Guess
[55:44] how you'll get back into that body.
[55:46] Water, blood, and spirit. So he did this
[55:50] once and for all. All those of course
[55:53] that will receive it. Then they are
[55:55] progressively sanctified by the
[55:58] transforming power of God. So he saves
[56:01] us and forgives us of our sins. Then we
[56:04] enter into these stages of the great
[56:06] work of God. Many of you have been there
[56:08] for years. haven't you? I've been there
[56:10] since I was a 12 year old boy. I'll be
[56:13] 70 in July. So, I've been here a long
[56:15] time. But yet, it's progressive. I'm
[56:18] growing. I'm finding out more about him,
[56:20] learning more about him. If I find
[56:22] something wrong in my life, I just ask
[56:25] him to help me and I move on till he
[56:27] shows me something else. And then we
[56:29] just keep moving, moving, sanctifying
[56:31] oursel by the grace of God. And so, the
[56:34] sanctification
[56:36] is glory. Notice this. Glory working in
[56:40] the embryo stage. Sanctification is the
[56:44] glory of God working in the embryo stage
[56:47] to where God is still working on us and
[56:50] making us and shaping us. Oh, I'm so
[56:53] grateful for that. So, he wants to
[56:55] sanctify people unto himself. Notice in
[56:58] Hebrews chapter 10 verse1 14. For by one
[57:02] offering he hath perfected forever them
[57:07] that are sanctified. For by one offering
[57:11] he has perfected forever them that are
[57:15] sanctified. But notice how the
[57:17] perfection comes. God has a divine order
[57:20] or a divine protocol by which this
[57:22] works. So they don't get perfection as
[57:26] soon as they repent. They don't get
[57:28] perfection as soon as they come to an
[57:30] altar, give their heart to God, as we
[57:32] would say. But he says, "For by one
[57:34] offering, he has perfected forever them
[57:38] that are sanctified." Notice coming
[57:41] under the cleansing of the blood and the
[57:44] reciprocating work of God inside of your
[57:47] soul. Only God can do that. We can't do
[57:50] it. Now going back again to Hebrews 2:1
[57:52] to where that he says that they both he
[57:55] that sanctifith and they who are
[57:57] sanctified are all of one. For which
[57:59] cause he's not ashamed to call them
[58:01] brethren. Now to Paul this was a great
[58:03] emphasis because knowing what we were
[58:07] versus what the Lord Jesus was. It would
[58:10] just be typical that he would be ashamed
[58:13] to call us his family. Now, I've got
[58:16] family members I don't mind telling you,
[58:19] but I wouldn't want some of you all to
[58:21] know. I've got family members that I
[58:23] wouldn't want probably to trace in my
[58:25] genealogy and my DNA. And probably some
[58:28] of my family wouldn't want other people
[58:31] to know they're kin to me either. And no
[58:33] doubt some of you little holy, righteous
[58:36] people sitting here today, you've got
[58:38] people in your family, oh my, I ain't
[58:40] worried about looking up the the family
[58:42] tree and finding monkeys. It's bank
[58:44] robbers and and liars and thieves
[58:47] and drunks and yeah, it was your family
[58:49] that shot my family for being horse
[58:51] thieves and then it was some of my
[58:53] family that shot your family for, you
[58:55] know, whatever it was they done. But the
[58:58] Lord Jesus comments, Paul's reaction to
[59:01] this was that you would think he would
[59:03] be ashamed of us by what we were and
[59:06] what he brought us from. But he looks at
[59:09] us as his family, as the redeemed of
[59:12] God, and says, "I'm not ashamed. I'm not
[59:15] ashamed." Are there people that we go to
[59:18] church with that you're ashamed of? Are
[59:20] there people that have done things in
[59:22] our church and, you know, maybe it
[59:24] caused a scandal among this or that or
[59:26] the other, and we kind of hang our head
[59:29] because, oh my goodness, they go to our
[59:31] church. We don't want nobody to know
[59:32] they go there. But yet the Lord Jesus
[59:34] looks at every one of us and our faults,
[59:37] our failures, our shortcomings, and he
[59:40] says, "I'm not ashamed to call you mine.
[59:44] I'm not ashamed to call you mine." Now,
[59:47] this is godliness.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; We need more of it.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We're talking about being
[59:54] like God. So, how many Christians can do
[59:57] this? I ain't talking about the length
[59:59] of your hair, sisters. I'm not talking
[1:00:00] about I don't do this and I don't go
[1:00:02] there. I'm talking about more than that.
[1:00:05] I'm talking about being like God.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; So notice he is not ashamed. So it would
[1:00:11] have been naturally anticipated that the
[1:00:15] son of God, the word, the logos, the
[1:00:17] holiness, the purity of God would be
[1:00:20] ashamed to be even identified around
[1:00:22] people. But yet we know Jesus reputation
[1:00:26] is made by being around such people. You
[1:00:30] know the woman who touched the hymn of
[1:00:31] his garment, she would have not been
[1:00:33] allowed to touch even a Levite, much
[1:00:37] less a high priest because it would have
[1:00:40] defiled them. But yet she touched the
[1:00:42] Lord Jesus and it delivered her. He
[1:00:45] didn't look back and say, "Woman, shame
[1:00:47] on you. What in the world you doing
[1:00:48] touching me? Don't you understand? You
[1:00:50] defile me." It didn't defile him, but it
[1:00:53] cleansed her.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Now, think of it that God so wanted to
[1:00:58] bring us back to this place and restore
[1:01:01] us back to what Adam lost in the Garden
[1:01:04] of Eden. So, to call them brethren is
[1:01:07] for him to acknowledge himself as being
[1:01:10] one of the same family. So, was Jesus a
[1:01:14] Reagan? Was Jesus a ward, a smith, a
[1:01:20] hornad, a yons?
[1:01:23] No. So he didn't come and take on your
[1:01:26] name. He took on a body like yours so he
[1:01:30] could rebirth you not into the Ordd
[1:01:33] family, but rebirth you into the God
[1:01:36] family.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can anybody say amen this morning?
[1:01:40] to rebirth us into the God family in
[1:01:45] order that he in turn not once we get
[1:01:47] our glorified bodies. Jesus is not
[1:01:50] waiting on the time for us to be changed
[1:01:52] and get our glorified bodies in the
[1:01:54] resurrection and then called us
[1:01:57] brothers. He does now.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Notice again in verse 12,
[1:02:03] saying, I will declare thy name unto my
[1:02:08] brethren. And in the midst of the
[1:02:11] church, so you see Jesus believes in
[1:02:14] going to church. So Jesus is going to do
[1:02:17] this in church, saying, I will declare
[1:02:20] thy name unto my brethren. In the midst
[1:02:24] of the church will I sing praise unto
[1:02:28] thee. So the Lord Jesus believes in
[1:02:31] going to church and then he believes
[1:02:33] after you get there you're supposed to
[1:02:36] sing. Even if you can't carry a tune in
[1:02:38] a lard bucket, he wants you to sing
[1:02:41] praise anyhow.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad that you don't
[1:02:45] have to be a great excellent singer for
[1:02:47] God to want to hear your voice? Now
[1:02:50] notice the identification of the logos
[1:02:53] of God, the Lord Jesus, which was the
[1:02:56] fullness of the Godhead bodily. And then
[1:02:59] of course we know in 2 Corinthians 5
[1:03:01] that Paul says to it that God was in
[1:03:04] Christ reconciling the world to himself.
[1:03:07] So this is the great work that unfolded
[1:03:10] from Calvary. How we thank God for the
[1:03:12] manger. How we thank God for Calvary.
[1:03:15] But Calvary is not the end. It's just
[1:03:17] the beginning of leading us to where? To
[1:03:21] the book of Acts, the experience of Acts
[1:03:23] chapter 2. Cuz even after the Lord Jesus
[1:03:26] died and rose again, Peter and them
[1:03:29] still was not truly born again yet. Why?
[1:03:33] They had never yet been to Pentecost. So
[1:03:35] if the cross was enough, then the Lord
[1:03:37] Jesus would never have to tell them go
[1:03:40] to Pentecost. But what did he tell them
[1:03:42] in Acts 1:8? and you shall receive power
[1:03:45] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:03:48] you. Well, why didn't Jesus do like a
[1:03:50] lot of the modern-day preachers say,
[1:03:52] "Everything's done. I've died on the
[1:03:54] cross. I rose again. You don't need
[1:03:56] anything else. That ain't the way Jesus
[1:03:58] preached it, and that ain't the way I
[1:04:00] preach it,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; and that should not be the way you
[1:04:03] believe it." Amen. I believe on the
[1:04:05] cross. Wonderful. Thank God. But you've
[1:04:08] also got to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:09] Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Now notice to be godly then brings us
[1:04:14] into the divine family of God in so much
[1:04:17] that he said I will declare thy name
[1:04:20] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:04:22] church will I sing praise unto thee and
[1:04:26] again I will put my trust in him and
[1:04:29] again behold I and the children which
[1:04:33] God has given me. Behold I watch he's
[1:04:37] standing right among them. Brother
[1:04:39] Daryl. So, it's not like the Lord Jesus
[1:04:41] is way up there in heaven somewhere and
[1:04:44] we're down here like a bunch of slaves
[1:04:46] and servants and we just have to beg and
[1:04:49] weep and cry for a crumb. No, but he
[1:04:52] said he's standing right among them. And
[1:04:54] he said, "Behold, I and the children
[1:04:58] which God has given me." Do you
[1:05:00] understand, friend? We are fastly
[1:05:02] approaching the day when the Lord God by
[1:05:05] his word wants us to be able to behold
[1:05:08] the true church and the Lord Jesus right
[1:05:11] there in the midst of his people. Notice
[1:05:14] in verse 14, for as much then as the
[1:05:17] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:05:20] blood. He also, he also himself likewise
[1:05:25] took part of the same that through death
[1:05:28] he might destroy him that had the power
[1:05:31] of death. That is the devil. I'm not
[1:05:33] sure if the devil knows it yet, but he's
[1:05:36] dead.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm not sure if the
[1:05:39] devil knows it, but his kingdom is
[1:05:42] finished.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure that he understands it yet,
[1:05:45] but his days are numbered.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice in verse 16, for
[1:05:51] verily he took not on him the nature of
[1:05:54] angels, but he took on him the seed of
[1:05:59] Abraham. Now this is his divine purpose
[1:06:02] to we might be partakers of the divine
[1:06:04] nature. And then the attributes the the
[1:06:08] virtues that Peter wrote about the seven
[1:06:10] virtues which will be be capped off then
[1:06:12] by the eight which is charity on top. it
[1:06:15] will lead us into this. And a person may
[1:06:18] be in that stature for years of God
[1:06:21] molding them into that place. Notice
[1:06:24] Peter didn't write this just after he
[1:06:26] himself got the Holy Ghost. This is
[1:06:28] years later after Peter had done been
[1:06:31] preaching, had done been out doing
[1:06:33] missionary work, all kinds of things.
[1:06:35] And then the Lord drops the
[1:06:37] understanding down in Peter's heart. I
[1:06:39] wonder if it was not because he himself
[1:06:42] had finally arrived at that spot because
[1:06:46] he had grown. He had learned things
[1:06:48] about the family of God. He had learned
[1:06:51] things about the brothers and him and
[1:06:53] Paul had some issues. You remember that?
[1:06:55] And Peter even after he got the Holy
[1:06:57] Ghost and and some of the Jews comes
[1:06:59] from James and uh Peter was among the
[1:07:01] Gentiles and boy they was just rejoicing
[1:07:03] and praising God for what God had done.
[1:07:06] And when the brethren came from
[1:07:07] Jerusalem, Peter because of a little
[1:07:10] sectarianism,
[1:07:11] because James and some of the brothers
[1:07:13] up there, they was still struggling, you
[1:07:15] know, with the Gentiles being accepted
[1:07:17] on the full-fledged redemption as far as
[1:07:20] what Jesus had done. And when Peter saw
[1:07:22] him coming, he he just kind of pulled
[1:07:24] away from him a little bit. Now, you can
[1:07:26] imagine the great Apostle Peter. So,
[1:07:29] Peter would have come to our church
[1:07:30] today and some of the brethren from
[1:07:32] Jerusalem come in. Peter been hugging
[1:07:34] all you brother's neck and shaking your
[1:07:36] sister's hand. Oh might been up here
[1:07:38] just hugging brother Louie. Praise God.
[1:07:40] This is so wonderful. You bunch of
[1:07:42] Gentiles got saved and some of the Jews
[1:07:45] from Jerusalem walked in the back door
[1:07:46] and Peter said,
[1:07:49] "Excuse me there, brethren. I'll tell
[1:07:50] you one thing. I just uh uh yeah, glory
[1:07:53] to God. Hallelujah. Abraham was our
[1:07:55] father. Where's you?" And Paul rebuked
[1:07:58] him to the face. That's right.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; So, you know what lets me know? Peter
[1:08:04] had not yet reached the stage of
[1:08:07] brotherly kindness.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Peter had not yet grown into the
[1:08:11] fullness of the image of godliness. For
[1:08:15] God accepted the Jews and the Gentiles
[1:08:17] on the same basis. But Peter couldn't
[1:08:20] because the brethren from Jews made him
[1:08:23] feel bad.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Peter lacked godliness.
[1:08:28] Well, come on, somebody.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; That encourages me, Brother Brad. I
[1:08:32] think, praise the Lord. That gives me
[1:08:34] hope. That gives you hope.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right, brother Matthew? That
[1:08:37] gives us hope. So, here's a man that God
[1:08:40] is using and done great things. But this
[1:08:43] is not the anointed walk. This is not
[1:08:46] something that comes as a divine gift
[1:08:48] for God. These are virtues that are
[1:08:50] molded in the Christian walk with God.
[1:08:53] This is why some people will never have
[1:08:55] them. They don't want them. They don't
[1:08:58] think they're necessary. They're simply
[1:09:00] pointing to the cross and they never
[1:09:02] move beyond the cross. And yet the man,
[1:09:04] the only disciple we know of, John was
[1:09:07] at the cross and he himself stood there,
[1:09:09] watched the Lord Jesus die. The rest of
[1:09:11] them had done gone. And yet John,
[1:09:14] amazing to me that John didn't write
[1:09:16] near as much about the cross as some of
[1:09:19] the other brothers did. And he was an
[1:09:21] eyewitness of it. But he wrote about
[1:09:23] love and he wrote about charity and he
[1:09:26] wrote about the Holy Ghost and he wrote
[1:09:27] about forgiveness. Wonder why? Cuz John
[1:09:30] saw the cross was simply the pathway to
[1:09:33] lead us back on the other side of the
[1:09:35] breach to where man could be partakers
[1:09:38] of the divine nature. Oh, praise be to
[1:09:42] God. Notice this. Wherefore in all
[1:09:44] things it behooved him to be made like
[1:09:47] unto his brethren. So he loved you so
[1:09:50] much that he had to become like you.
[1:09:53] Why? So you could be made like him. So
[1:09:57] what is God wanting of our church?
[1:10:00] What's God wanting of Word of Life
[1:10:02] Church? Does he want us to be able to
[1:10:04] take shoe boxes, and we've done that.
[1:10:07] Does he want us to be able to help
[1:10:09] people in the time of the hurricane, and
[1:10:10] we did that, and the flood and the
[1:10:13] destruction and the devastation? Yes.
[1:10:15] Does he want us to reach out to
[1:10:17] humanity? He does. As a matter of fact,
[1:10:19] we've drilled water wells in different
[1:10:21] parts of the earth that you don't even
[1:10:23] know anything about to give people
[1:10:24] water. We built churches in in Africa,
[1:10:28] in Uganda, in Kenya, in Tanzania. We
[1:10:31] built churches in the Philippines. We've
[1:10:32] got them in India, all over the world.
[1:10:35] Is that all God wants?
[1:10:37] Is that godliness?
[1:10:39] In one way, yeah, but a very small way.
[1:10:42] But you see, many times it's easier to
[1:10:44] reach in that back pocket and pull that
[1:10:46] wallet out and drop $20 in the offering,
[1:10:49] go $100 in the offering than it is to
[1:10:51] reach inside of your heart and part with
[1:10:54] jealousy
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; or envy
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; or strife.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Wherefore in all things it
[1:11:05] behoove him to be made like his brethren
[1:11:07] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[1:11:12] high priest. Now this is why it becomes
[1:11:14] this way. Not only just for the
[1:11:16] cleansing of the blood but also that
[1:11:19] after now remember this is when he goes
[1:11:21] up into heaven because on the earth
[1:11:24] Jesus was not acting in the full scope
[1:11:27] of being the high priest. He was not
[1:11:29] acting in the full scope of the work of
[1:11:32] redemption. But after he dies and then
[1:11:34] Mary of course comes and he said, "Don't
[1:11:36] touch me. Don't touch me. I've not yet
[1:11:38] ascended into my father." So what's he
[1:11:40] doing? He's taking the blood as the high
[1:11:43] priest to go into the presence of God
[1:11:46] and become that offering. Then once he
[1:11:48] does that, he comes back down and then
[1:11:50] he tells Thomas, "Come and touch me."
[1:11:52] Why? He had done been offered in the
[1:11:54] presence of God. But he's not just doing
[1:11:57] it for the blood. But since his
[1:11:59] ascension and been gone for 2,000 years
[1:12:02] as far as the corporal body, he has been
[1:12:05] acting as our high priest. Not as one
[1:12:08] that could not relate as an angel and
[1:12:11] you'd come to an angel. Angel, I sinned
[1:12:13] today. Angel, I I looked at a woman. I
[1:12:15] had bad thoughts. I'm so sorry. Or look
[1:12:17] at at at God. Now, Almighty God, you
[1:12:20] cannot relate to me, but I I I've done
[1:12:22] wrong today. I've said something wrong.
[1:12:24] God said, why would you do that? How
[1:12:25] come you would do that? But God wanted a
[1:12:28] priest. A priest that would become a
[1:12:31] human. And when that human would be
[1:12:33] raised into heaven, it would be our
[1:12:36] earthly identified brother ascended into
[1:12:40] a heavenly position on our behalf.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; The devil ain't got a chance of winning
[1:12:46] the case against you.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Woo! Oh, glory. The devil ain't got a
[1:12:52] fighting chance. Oh, he may bring our
[1:12:55] faults before the throne of God, and we
[1:12:57] know he accuses us day and night, but
[1:13:00] you know what? When we repent and make
[1:13:03] that thing right before God, there ain't
[1:13:05] one speck of evidence that the devil can
[1:13:08] use against you.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Notice this. So it it behooved him to be
[1:13:13] made like unto his brethren that he
[1:13:15] might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:13:18] priest in things pertaining to God to
[1:13:21] make reconciliation
[1:13:23] for the sins of the people. Now you know
[1:13:26] then the writer comes and says little
[1:13:28] children John of course little children
[1:13:30] I write unto you that you sin not. But
[1:13:32] if any man sin we have an advocate and
[1:13:35] the Greek word is paricletos which is
[1:13:37] one called alongside to help. We have an
[1:13:41] advocate with the father which is Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ the righteous which is not only
[1:13:45] the perpetuation for our sins but the
[1:13:47] perpetuation for the sins of the whole
[1:13:49] world. You mean as Christians? How many
[1:13:52] still needs a high priest?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Wow. We must have a bunch of angels here
[1:13:57] today too. Wow. We welcome you too. Holy
[1:14:00] angels. I didn't think angels would have
[1:14:02] gray hair.
[1:14:04] How many needs a high priest? Ah, not
[1:14:07] near as many angels as I thought. every
[1:14:09] one of us do. And the closer we get into
[1:14:12] the light, the more little things look
[1:14:16] dark.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; So, it's amazing when you're in the
[1:14:19] world of darkness and you don't realize
[1:14:20] how dark you are. And then you're
[1:14:22] totally transformed by the power of God
[1:14:24] and Paul says it that ye who were
[1:14:26] sometimes darkness are now made light in
[1:14:29] the Lord. He didn't say you were in
[1:14:31] darkness, but you were darkness. So,
[1:14:34] your soul was blackened by demonic
[1:14:36] power. And we know that that we were
[1:14:39] under that demonic influence and that
[1:14:41] unclean spirit lived in us. We look at
[1:14:43] it Lord will win on Wednesday night. And
[1:14:45] whenever that unclean spirit if it's
[1:14:47] made to leave it has no right or
[1:14:50] authority to come back. But if that
[1:14:52] unclean spirit goes out on its own then
[1:14:56] the Bible says according to the Lord
[1:14:57] Jesus that unclean spirit walks through
[1:15:01] dry places. Dry. Is that a strange word?
[1:15:04] The Lord Jesus uses about demons. So
[1:15:07] that unclean spirit walks through dry
[1:15:10] places. He's thirsting. That demon is in
[1:15:14] a thirsting sphere of his life. Dry
[1:15:18] places. And he's seeking rest. A demon
[1:15:22] seeking rest. Why? Why in the world
[1:15:26] would a demon want rest? Now remember,
[1:15:28] they're just about helpless until they
[1:15:30] get inside of a human body. And that's
[1:15:33] the way all of us were. So when the
[1:15:35] spirit of God come into our heart, drove
[1:15:37] out that unclean spirit. Now remember
[1:15:40] Jesus gave us the the analogy of this
[1:15:42] that if that unclean spirit goes out of
[1:15:44] a man and he walks through dry places
[1:15:47] seeking rest, seeking rest, a demon
[1:15:51] seeking rest and findeth none. And he
[1:15:54] said, "I will return to my house."
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; So he's still claiming it at his own.
[1:16:01] Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; So he claims it as his own because the
[1:16:04] spirit of God has not yet come into the
[1:16:06] soul. And when he comes back, he looks
[1:16:09] at the house. It's swept. It's
[1:16:11] garnished. So it's been saved. It's been
[1:16:13] sanctified. A work of God has done
[1:16:15] something tremendous in that life. But
[1:16:18] this is the catcher right here. It is is
[1:16:20] garnished and swept, but it is empty.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; So it's a person that's cleaned up their
[1:16:26] life. Boy, they're not the person they
[1:16:27] used to be. My they they love God.
[1:16:29] They're going to church now. They're
[1:16:31] doing really good deeds, but they're an
[1:16:33] empty Christian. They've not been filled
[1:16:36] with the life of the Lord Jesus yet. And
[1:16:39] that devil goes back to his house and he
[1:16:42] looks inside of there and it's all
[1:16:45] beautiful and clean and sanctified and
[1:16:48] washed, but there's nobody living in it.
[1:16:51] That's right.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Then the Bible says he gets seven other
[1:16:55] spirits worse than himself.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And the latter days of that man was
[1:17:04] worse than the first. Now you see just
[1:17:07] being a professing Christian, it's
[1:17:09] wonderful to accept Christ as your
[1:17:11] savior. But you cannot live in this life
[1:17:14] a cleaned, washed, sanctified building
[1:17:18] without the presence of God and have the
[1:17:20] same power that the Holy Ghostfilled
[1:17:23] child of God does. And the church said,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; you see, this is what he come to do. Not
[1:17:28] say, well, I believe in the cross. I
[1:17:29] believe in the blood. I believe in
[1:17:31] mercy. Well and good. That's swept,
[1:17:33] garnished, and empty. But what fills us?
[1:17:37] Not knowledge, not churchity, not church
[1:17:40] works. what the very life of Christ.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. For by one spirit we are all
[1:17:47] baptized into that one body, not by
[1:17:50] accepting the cross. Holy Spirit
[1:17:53] baptism. Notice in verse 18, for in that
[1:17:56] he himself hath suffered being tempted.
[1:18:00] Now remember God, God in the form of
[1:18:03] flesh was tempted and it wasn't an act.
[1:18:07] He suffered. How many knows temptation
[1:18:10] can cause you to suffer? It can be a
[1:18:13] pain. It can be an anxiety. What is it?
[1:18:16] What is temptation? It stems from lust.
[1:18:19] What is lust? Coveting something that
[1:18:22] does not belong to you. Now, many times
[1:18:25] people think, "Oh, it's lusting after
[1:18:26] somebody else's wife or their husband."
[1:18:28] Well, that can be true. It's lusting
[1:18:30] after their home. It's lusting after
[1:18:32] this. It can be one preacher lusting
[1:18:35] after another preacher's position. Oh,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; it can be one song or one song leader,
[1:18:40] one song writer, one singer lusting
[1:18:44] after another singer's position. It's
[1:18:46] anything that does not belong to you.
[1:18:50] Come on, somebody.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; It's one preacher wanting to be the
[1:18:53] pastor of another church that maybe God
[1:18:56] never called him to be.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Don't just make it adultery. Don't just
[1:19:01] make it about money. Let's get down in
[1:19:03] there where we all live at. Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; So the Lord Jesus felt that. So when
[1:19:10] Satan comes to him in Matthew 4 and Luke
[1:19:12] 4 and he offers him the kingdoms of the
[1:19:14] world. The scripture said that he showed
[1:19:16] him of course to him. He just appeared
[1:19:18] in a dimensional. Remember the devil's a
[1:19:20] dimensional build being. So he can
[1:19:23] travel in time. He can go backwards. He
[1:19:24] can go forward. And he was able to carry
[1:19:26] the Lord Jesus upon the pinnacle of the
[1:19:28] temple. And the Lord Jesus as a man was
[1:19:31] tempted to do that. Why would he allow
[1:19:33] himself to be tempted for me?
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; For you.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; So when you are tempted, you can go to a
[1:19:40] high priest and say, "Lord Jesus, I'm so
[1:19:42] sorry. I'm so sorry. I I I was tempted
[1:19:45] to do this. Unlike him, he he was
[1:19:48] tempted, but he never yielded."
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; But how many of us have?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:19:55] Now, how would you like to have a judge,
[1:19:58] not a lawyer, but a judge every time you
[1:20:01] go before the throne of God for
[1:20:03] repentance and all you have is a
[1:20:06] judicial judgment based upon your works
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and your failures?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; I don't figure I'd be here preaching
[1:20:15] today.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I don't figure most of you would be here
[1:20:18] either. We'd be so discouraged, we'd
[1:20:20] think, what's the use?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; But what do we have a lawyer? A lawyer
[1:20:26] who was a human being
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; who was tempted by women,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; tempted by drinking, tempted by money,
[1:20:35] tempted by everything that he could be
[1:20:37] tempted by, and yet without sin. Who
[1:20:40] better to have for an attorney? Praise
[1:20:44] be to God. So when you come up before
[1:20:47] your attorney, what is he doing? He's
[1:20:49] not standing there and taking sides with
[1:20:52] the opposition against you, but he's
[1:20:54] saying, "Father, forgive them. They
[1:20:55] don't know what they do. Father, forgive
[1:20:57] them. They don't know what they do." I
[1:20:59] understand how that feels. Father, I
[1:21:01] also was a man. Father, I remember that.
[1:21:04] I remember how I felt in the Garden of
[1:21:06] Eden. I even asked to let this cup pass
[1:21:09] for me. I did not want to die. I did not
[1:21:12] want to pay the supreme price. Father, I
[1:21:15] know when they say, "I don't want to do
[1:21:17] that. I I don't want to do that. I don't
[1:21:19] want to preach. I don't want to preach
[1:21:20] that sermon. No Lord, please don't make
[1:21:22] me do it. Father, don't hold it against
[1:21:24] him. Forgive them. Father, I understand
[1:21:26] what that's like. Oh, thank God for such
[1:21:29] a high priest.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, in that we know that God
[1:21:33] hates sin. So, if God hates sin, to be
[1:21:35] godly, to be like God, we got to hate
[1:21:37] sin as well. But remember, God doesn't
[1:21:39] hate the sinner, but he does hate sin.
[1:21:42] And what is sin? Sin is unbelief. And
[1:21:45] sin did not begin on the earth in the
[1:21:46] garden of Eden, but sin actually began
[1:21:48] in heaven. Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28, you
[1:21:50] can find that one. Satan said in his
[1:21:52] heart that he wanted to be like God,
[1:21:54] which is the beginning of sin right
[1:21:56] there from the heart of this
[1:21:57] supernatural being. And he says he
[1:21:59] wanted to be like God and he wanted a
[1:22:01] throne like God and he wanted to be
[1:22:03] exalted above the star stars of God. If
[1:22:05] you look at that word in the Hebrew, it
[1:22:07] is the progeny or the Messiah's
[1:22:09] brothers. So he wanted to exalt himself
[1:22:12] above the stars of God and he wanted to
[1:22:14] ascend up on the sides of the north, the
[1:22:17] north side. He longed for the north
[1:22:20] side. And when he did, then this is what
[1:22:22] introduced it into his heart. Then he
[1:22:25] goes and preaches to the angels there in
[1:22:28] heaven. Never smoked, never lied, never
[1:22:30] committed adultery, and they made their
[1:22:32] choice to leave the economy of God. This
[1:22:35] is the origination of sin. Then Satan of
[1:22:38] course wants to have a kingdom. What
[1:22:40] good does it do to have a desire to be a
[1:22:42] king if you ain't got a kingdom? So he
[1:22:44] wants a kingdom yet he's unlike God and
[1:22:46] that he cannot create. He's not
[1:22:48] omnipotent. He's not omnipresent
[1:22:49] omniscent. Neither is his demons. Now
[1:22:52] keep this in mind that Satan is not
[1:22:54] omnipotent. He's not omnipresent. He
[1:22:57] cannot be everywhere at one time by his
[1:23:00] omniscience like God can. He can only be
[1:23:03] in one place at one time. and so can his
[1:23:06] demons the same way. Now think then
[1:23:09] what's he do? He spreads across the
[1:23:11] earth since the fall of man in the
[1:23:13] beginning and in different times he's
[1:23:16] had his headquarters built up in
[1:23:18] different parts of the earth. So in the
[1:23:19] beginning of course it was outside the
[1:23:21] garden gate when he come down upon the
[1:23:23] earth and then he began to move and then
[1:23:26] he would come from one kingdom to
[1:23:28] another to another and he would have his
[1:23:30] headquarters in Paris France or he would
[1:23:33] have his headquarters in Germany or he
[1:23:35] would have his headquarters wherever it
[1:23:36] was and of course we know one of the
[1:23:38] last places that he's been has been in
[1:23:40] Hollywood and then from there he would
[1:23:42] project what his ideology to make the
[1:23:46] people of the earth to be like him. So
[1:23:49] by movies, by video games, by music, by
[1:23:52] all kinds of things, he gets his people,
[1:23:55] he orchestrates them, anoints them with
[1:23:57] demonic influence. They will write
[1:24:00] songs, they will design picture shows,
[1:24:03] they will design all types of things to
[1:24:05] bring the people of the earth into the
[1:24:08] imagery of his kingdom. I realize people
[1:24:11] don't even understand and they think,
[1:24:13] why do y'all preach on clothes and why
[1:24:15] do you preach you shouldn't do this and
[1:24:17] do that? cuz we don't want to look like
[1:24:19] we belong to the kingdom of hell. That's
[1:24:21] why
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; if there's not identification about it,
[1:24:25] why is it that it's so trendy? And why
[1:24:28] is it that Satan has pushed it since the
[1:24:30] very fall of man in the beginning? So,
[1:24:32] he knows exactly what he's doing. And
[1:24:34] then here we are on the earth redeemed
[1:24:36] by the power of God. And everywhere we
[1:24:38] go, we look and see. And we see the
[1:24:40] conditions of the earth are worsening
[1:24:42] every day. And the imagery is pretty
[1:24:45] evident by the people that we can see.
[1:24:48] So the majority of humanity, they are
[1:24:50] self-centered. They are self-willed.
[1:24:52] This is why they're nearly run over you.
[1:24:55] If you go to try to get a parking spot
[1:24:56] in Walmart and they're in there, they're
[1:24:58] going to get it and you better not get
[1:25:00] in their way. Why? It's all about self.
[1:25:02] This is why people drag a gun out. You
[1:25:05] pull over in front of them on the road
[1:25:06] and they'll kill you, right? We never
[1:25:08] even heard of this rage years and years
[1:25:10] ago. But where is it now? The image of
[1:25:13] the world is taking on the image of
[1:25:16] Satan and selfishness that I want to
[1:25:18] know friends how come we as Christians
[1:25:21] so emphasize on self
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; me mine I I don't like this I don't want
[1:25:27] that I want this I want that that's not
[1:25:29] the talk of God Jesus said father not my
[1:25:32] will but thy will be done
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; now remember what are the people of the
[1:25:37] earth doing they're conforming to the
[1:25:39] image of Satan because the power of the
[1:25:42] beast is already here. This anti-semitic
[1:25:45] thing that we see around the world, the
[1:25:46] nations of the world and every nation
[1:25:48] will look at it when it's in outward.
[1:25:50] But every nation of the earth is
[1:25:51] controlled by spirits. You know that
[1:25:53] according to Daniel 10:20 and there's
[1:25:55] demons that are sent to be able to
[1:25:57] influence and affect people. And then
[1:26:00] that chamberlain or that demon over that
[1:26:02] area will project a certain demographic
[1:26:05] over the people there and control them.
[1:26:08] America is also under such a thing.
[1:26:11] Satan controls the political parties,
[1:26:13] both of them.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Satan is the king of
[1:26:17] politics. God's not a politician. That's
[1:26:20] right. But Satan is. And what does God
[1:26:23] do then? God wants to call his people
[1:26:25] out from among that. And they're going
[1:26:27] to live right among them. They're going
[1:26:29] to rub shoulders with them every day.
[1:26:31] But he don't want them looking like
[1:26:33] them. He don't want them talking like
[1:26:35] them. He don't want them acting like
[1:26:38] them. And yet there's never been such an
[1:26:40] influence like on the world today. And
[1:26:43] we know that certain demons then are
[1:26:45] released out of the abyss and the
[1:26:47] regions of hell at certain times. You
[1:26:50] remember that of course in the book of
[1:26:51] Revelation. So there's a key and then
[1:26:53] the key which many times is a time
[1:26:55] sequence on the earth. And there's
[1:26:57] certain prophetic words that need come
[1:26:59] to pass. And God will allow certain
[1:27:01] things to come out of the regions of the
[1:27:04] lost and begin to move upon the earth as
[1:27:07] God himself has a certain sequence in
[1:27:09] his word which we'll look at it
[1:27:11] Wednesday as I'm saying and Daniel
[1:27:12] chapter 10. When Daniel got to seeking
[1:27:14] the face of God and praying, and what
[1:27:16] was it about? Because he had been
[1:27:18] reading in the books of Jeremiah, a
[1:27:20] prophet which had already uh lived his
[1:27:22] life and was gone. And he read that
[1:27:24] there was 70 years that God's going to
[1:27:27] bring them out of Babylon. So there was
[1:27:29] a prophetic word that had a se a certain
[1:27:32] timeline. And Daniel was praying about
[1:27:34] that timeline. And whenever he starts
[1:27:36] praying, this angel of God comes down,
[1:27:39] which was Gabriel, comes down out of
[1:27:41] heaven and he comes into this Persian
[1:27:43] empire, Babylonian, Persian. Now he's
[1:27:46] fixing to change dispensations. And he
[1:27:48] comes in there and this angel withstands
[1:27:51] him, fallen angel. He fights him for 21
[1:27:54] days trying to break through, break
[1:27:57] through. And he cannot break through
[1:27:59] until Michael the archangel comes down
[1:28:02] from heaven. And then Michael begins to
[1:28:05] withstand this demonic power and
[1:28:07] releases Gabriel. And Gabriel goes to
[1:28:10] Daniel. And he one of the first things
[1:28:12] he tells him was why he was late. So he
[1:28:14] goes there with what? An understanding,
[1:28:17] an understanding. It didn't come to
[1:28:19] priests. It did not come to good people.
[1:28:22] It did not come to just any regular Jew,
[1:28:24] but it come to a prophet of God.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; "A prophet of God." And he said he had
[1:28:32] come to show him that which was these
[1:28:34] words noted in the scripture. Noted in
[1:28:38] the scripture and whenever he makes it
[1:28:40] known to him that he releases and he
[1:28:42] goes back and he said I will go back and
[1:28:44] fight with the prince of Persia and
[1:28:47] remain with him and he mentions princes
[1:28:49] and also kings. So there is a hierarchy
[1:28:52] in that world. Oh may God help us. Do
[1:28:55] you understand what we're dealing with
[1:28:56] today friends? We're not dealing with
[1:28:58] people. Don't you understand? Even when
[1:29:00] trouble comes in among your family and
[1:29:02] you go to arguing and fussing and
[1:29:04] debating about this or that or the
[1:29:05] other, whatever it is, don't you
[1:29:07] understand that it's not necessarily
[1:29:08] your wife. It's not necessarily your
[1:29:10] son, your daughter, your husband. It's
[1:29:12] them evil spirits. Evil spirits is what
[1:29:16] gets in churches and causes them to fuss
[1:29:18] and argue and split and debate. That's
[1:29:21] why we got so many churches in the land.
[1:29:23] The First Baptist and the Second Baptist
[1:29:24] and the 38th Baptist and the 49th
[1:29:27] Baptist and the 157th Baptist. Why?
[1:29:30] Demons got among them. Come on, don't
[1:29:31] sit there and look at me funny. It's the
[1:29:33] same thing in our own ranks. Them demons
[1:29:36] are doing the same thing. They're
[1:29:37] dividing us and separating us and the
[1:29:39] ungodly in their character will go. Many
[1:29:43] good people, many good people will take
[1:29:46] sides with a demonic anointing that's
[1:29:48] trying to divide a family, a demonic
[1:29:51] anointing that's trying to divide a
[1:29:53] church. And they think it's so awesome.
[1:29:55] They think it's so wonderful. You know
[1:29:57] why? They're missing godliness in their
[1:29:59] life. Are they saved? Sure, they're
[1:30:01] saved. Are they good people? Yes,
[1:30:03] they're good people. But they don't
[1:30:05] realize they join up with a demon, which
[1:30:08] is God on somebody trying to divide a
[1:30:10] family, separate a family, whatever it
[1:30:12] is, and they're on the wrong side. It
[1:30:15] amazes me how many people in church will
[1:30:18] wind up on the wrong side of an issue.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Woo! Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen, Brother Donnie?
[1:30:26] Yeah.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Now, do we want to be like God
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; or do we want to be like the devil?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Now, do you understand that you can fit
[1:30:35] the criterion of a holiness image and
[1:30:38] yet still not be godly in this aspect?
[1:30:44] You see what the Lord wants is that he
[1:30:46] hates sin. But he has the ability of
[1:30:49] dividing the sin from the sinner and
[1:30:52] saying, "I hate what you were doing, but
[1:30:55] I love you and I'll offer you a way
[1:30:58] out."
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we'll hate the
[1:31:00] sin and the sinner at the same time. I
[1:31:03] can't stand that person. I'll tell you
[1:31:04] one, I can't stand them. Well, you know,
[1:31:06] I understand as far as being able to to
[1:31:08] to be able to stand being around them
[1:31:10] and the things they do and the language
[1:31:12] they use and that sort of thing, but if
[1:31:14] we're godly, there should be something
[1:31:16] in us that we don't just have human
[1:31:19] anger because they say words that we
[1:31:21] don't like or they behave in a way that
[1:31:23] we don't like. There should be a godly
[1:31:25] love, a pulsation of that new birth in
[1:31:27] our soul that we say, "I I feel so sorry
[1:31:30] for them poor people. They don't realize
[1:31:32] what darkness that they're in." Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Is that the way you want to be? You know
[1:31:37] what you're doing? You're climbing up
[1:31:39] the pyramid to be more like God. Then
[1:31:42] you're looking at them and saying, "God,
[1:31:43] have mercy on them. God, please help
[1:31:45] them. Please, Lord, if there's anything
[1:31:47] you can deal with, open their eyes,
[1:31:49] Lord. They're in such darkness." And you
[1:31:50] know what? Me and Carol talk about it
[1:31:52] all the time. And we always come back to
[1:31:54] this. And wasn't for the grace of God,
[1:31:56] we'd probably been the same shape or
[1:31:58] worse. You know why? Because it's the
[1:32:00] mercy of the Lord Jesus. Oh, I'll tell
[1:32:03] you one thing. I'm a great Christian. I
[1:32:04] do this and that. You ain't got nothing
[1:32:06] to brag about. I don't care how long
[1:32:08] you've been saved, what you've done or
[1:32:10] ain't done. It's the mercy of God.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Watch. God's prophet said, "God hates
[1:32:14] sin." How is God, the Holy Spirit, going
[1:32:17] to live in a person that's always
[1:32:18] committing sins, going out deliberately
[1:32:21] doing this and that, running to these
[1:32:24] kinds of places? That's what's the
[1:32:25] matter with the church. What you say,
[1:32:27] brother, I spoke in tongues. I don't
[1:32:29] care what you done. If your life don't
[1:32:31] type up with God's Bible. I've seen
[1:32:33] witches and wizards speak in tonesues.
[1:32:35] I've seen them dance in the spirit and
[1:32:37] everything else. America's rotten with
[1:32:39] Tommy rot. I believe in speaking in
[1:32:41] tonesues. I believe in every gift in the
[1:32:43] Bible. And we believe the same thing.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; I believe in it. But it's got to be put
[1:32:48] in the right place and carried on in the
[1:32:50] right way at the right time. And God
[1:32:53] will vindicate every bit of it to to God
[1:32:56] be the truth. Now you remember that Paul
[1:32:58] had to deal with this in the in the
[1:33:00] Corinthian church and the people were
[1:33:02] coming together and they had gifts of
[1:33:04] tongues and healings and manifestations
[1:33:06] and great wonderful things. But they had
[1:33:09] not moved up yet into the realm of
[1:33:12] godliness to where they should be
[1:33:14] because when they'd get under the
[1:33:15] anointing, it was just all about them.
[1:33:17] Oh, glory to God. Oh, hallelujah. Oh,
[1:33:20] thank you, Jesus. and they're speaking
[1:33:21] in tongues and interrupting the pastor
[1:33:23] and they they they just are doing a
[1:33:25] little bit of everything. Why did they
[1:33:27] lack the spirit? No. Did they lack the
[1:33:30] anointing? No. They lacked godliness.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Why would God give you his word and give
[1:33:36] you his divine protocol and then him
[1:33:39] anoints you to do the exact opposite
[1:33:40] that his word told you not to do.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; So they lack the understanding of
[1:33:47] godliness of whatever you feel led to
[1:33:49] do. Remember, God will never lead you.
[1:33:51] God will never lead you to go contrary
[1:33:54] to his own written word. But the reason
[1:33:56] people do it is because a lack of
[1:33:58] godliness in their life. And they go by
[1:34:01] the feeling, the sensation. Oh, I I've
[1:34:03] got to do this. I I feel I've got to do
[1:34:05] it. I I've just got to do it. And
[1:34:06] they'll step right over the top of the
[1:34:08] word of God. And you show them
[1:34:10] scripture. You show them the message of
[1:34:11] their Oh, I don't care. I don't care. I
[1:34:13] don't care. I feel led to do it. I'm
[1:34:14] going to do it. Well, it shows right
[1:34:16] there. I don't care if it's a preacher,
[1:34:17] if it's a singer, if he's been preaching
[1:34:18] for 300 years and he's got 75 churches
[1:34:21] and whatever he's done. It makes no
[1:34:22] difference. The spirit of God will never
[1:34:24] leave his word.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; We will, but God don't.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; and notice again, he said, "But God
[1:34:32] hates sin. He will not let it go
[1:34:34] unjudged." And the very thing that
[1:34:35] destroyed the unbeliever took the
[1:34:38] believer to safety. It was the waters of
[1:34:40] judgment that destroy the unbeliever.
[1:34:42] and the same waters that packed Noah to
[1:34:45] safety. And it's the gospel message that
[1:34:48] will destroy the unbeliever that'll take
[1:34:51] the church in the rapture before the
[1:34:54] judgment ever strikes. So this thing has
[1:34:57] always been here, but especially in the
[1:35:00] New Testament because the New Testament
[1:35:02] brought it into a spiritual dimension to
[1:35:05] where that Satan must now very much
[1:35:08] cloak himself. In the Old Testament,
[1:35:11] physical idolatry was something that
[1:35:13] constantly uh you know was a was a a
[1:35:16] stumbling block to the children of
[1:35:17] Israel. And they would they would
[1:35:19] worship Kimosh and Baal and Asteros and
[1:35:22] all of these gods and goddesses of the
[1:35:25] people of the Canaanites. But once it
[1:35:27] come to the New Testament, then Satan
[1:35:29] knew that would no longer work. They're
[1:35:31] they're no longer, you know, that's why
[1:35:33] you don't find Kimosh in the New
[1:35:34] Testament. You don't find asteroth in
[1:35:36] the New Testament. You're not going to
[1:35:38] find it there. But it's going to be
[1:35:40] changed from natural idolatry to
[1:35:43] spiritual idolatry and spiritual
[1:35:46] adultery. So, I don't know if any
[1:35:48] churches here in our area, do you have a
[1:35:50] statue to Kimosh? Anybody know of one?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Anybody know of a church in our area has
[1:35:55] a statue to Baal?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Asteros.
[1:36:00] The last count that I had, the Hindus
[1:36:02] had over 33 million gods. And all
[1:36:05] Christians of America would call them
[1:36:07] heathens. Why? Because they're
[1:36:10] worshiping. And I've been there in some
[1:36:12] of their their services and the things
[1:36:13] that they do. It's absolutely demonic,
[1:36:15] believe me.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And yet, what is it though? It's a
[1:36:19] natural realm. So, they march around
[1:36:20] this temple and they gather around
[1:36:22] there, put fish hooks in their back, put
[1:36:24] pins in their tongue and blood coming
[1:36:26] out of there like crazy. And yet, it's
[1:36:28] something natural. But yet, how many
[1:36:30] people in the Tri Cities area around the
[1:36:32] world, not just here, but they worship
[1:36:35] idols, too, but theirs are spiritual.
[1:36:39] So it's their jobs,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; it's money,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; it's their image,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; You ever wonder why gyms are exploding
[1:36:50] in the age we live in?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Where people can go and work out and
[1:36:54] this and that and the other. Don't you
[1:36:56] understand what a lot of that is?
[1:36:58] Worship
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; of the human body.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Brother, are you saying I shouldn't
[1:37:06] exercise? Nope. I'm sure not. But I will
[1:37:09] tell you what Paul said. Bodily exercise
[1:37:12] profit.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how many adulteries
[1:37:20] start from such.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I figured y'all would get a little
[1:37:24] bit quiet. I just didn't figure the
[1:37:25] bottom would fall out of it. Don't you
[1:37:27] understand what it is, friends? It's
[1:37:29] Satan. It's the ungodly spirit of this
[1:37:33] age that is moving on people for them to
[1:37:36] want to worship their own body.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; So they'll stand in front of a mirror
[1:37:41] and flex.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you don't on this arm
[1:37:45] anyway.
[1:37:46] About like Popeye, huh? Right. So, they
[1:37:49] stand there and flex their muscles and
[1:37:51] their abs and their whatever else
[1:37:53] they've got and they do all this and
[1:37:55] that and the other. Don't tell me that
[1:37:56] you can go to a place like that when
[1:37:59] you've got male flesh and hum female
[1:38:01] flesh being exposed and in an all type
[1:38:04] of contorted positions and then not
[1:38:06] bother you as a man or a woman.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call you a liar to your
[1:38:11] face cuz you ain't telling the truth.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Well preach, brother Donnie.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; What is it, though? Satan is bringing
[1:38:18] man to the spot to where man will
[1:38:21] worship himself. He's his own God. Why
[1:38:25] do you think self-help books and
[1:38:28] self-help podcasts and self-help this
[1:38:31] and self-help that has exploded in our
[1:38:34] age? Because Satan is giving to man this
[1:38:38] thing that he is a god. Don't you
[1:38:41] understand the same thing that he
[1:38:43] offered Eve in the Garden of Eden that
[1:38:45] God knows in the day you eat thereof you
[1:38:48] shall be as God.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; So what did Satan want to do? bypass the
[1:38:53] very program of God and bring to her a
[1:38:56] knowledge about herself,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; not about God.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He showed her things about herself.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That she never knew,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; her shape, her form, her fashion.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Then she was able with that knowledge to
[1:39:17] take that to her husband.
[1:39:22] Woo.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It's warm in here today, ain't it?
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And yet all of this is around us
[1:39:31] every day of our life.
[1:39:34] Look friends, where we are. Do you
[1:39:36] understand that the gladiators in the
[1:39:38] Roman days were gods?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that people made gods
[1:39:45] out of in the arenas? I've stood in some
[1:39:46] of the arenas and coliseums and things
[1:39:49] that the Romans built and it becomes
[1:39:51] such an an idolatry thing. It's the same
[1:39:54] thing today with many sports this and
[1:39:57] sports that. Many Christians are drunk
[1:40:00] on sports. They know more about football
[1:40:02] and baseball and basketball than they
[1:40:05] know about their New Testament.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it's wrong for you to
[1:40:11] play basketball. I'm not saying it's
[1:40:13] wrong for you to even to listen some of
[1:40:15] it. Unless you become so tied up in that
[1:40:19] that you know more about that than you
[1:40:21] don't know know about getting out of
[1:40:22] this world or some wrong.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; I guess I'll be standing on the side of
[1:40:30] the road tomorrow. One of them sides. I
[1:40:32] will work for food. Carol standing
[1:40:33] behind me.
[1:40:36] I'm going to tell you the truth.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I know you may not like it, but I'm
[1:40:40] going to tell you the truth.
[1:40:44] You see, it's totally impossible for us
[1:40:47] to love the world. Now, when I say that,
[1:40:49] I'm not talking about the earth, but the
[1:40:51] Greek word here, of course, is cosmos,
[1:40:54] which is the world order. So, it's the
[1:40:57] order of the day. The believers in every
[1:40:59] age had to conflict and contrast with
[1:41:03] the order of their day. And Paul's day
[1:41:04] was totally different than ours, but yet
[1:41:06] they still had things there. You imagine
[1:41:08] the Romans were so ungodly in the Greeks
[1:41:11] and so filthy that they'd have rational
[1:41:13] message and they'd be out there naked.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; What in the world is a Christian got any
[1:41:18] business going to a naked ration match?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; They had all kinds of things. It's every
[1:41:23] every believer in every age has had an
[1:41:26] element of worldliness that they had to
[1:41:28] stand against and they were made fun of.
[1:41:31] Don't get it in your mind. Well, we're
[1:41:32] the only ones. No, you ain't the only
[1:41:34] ones. You're just the last ones.
[1:41:37] Amen. Cuz we're at the end time.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Notice this in Romans 12:2 that Paul
[1:41:43] said, "Be not conformed to this world."
[1:41:47] Be not conformed to this world, but be
[1:41:50] ye transformed by the renewing of your
[1:41:55] mind. Now, you passed many of them
[1:41:57] coming to church today. We got one right
[1:41:59] out here on this poll. What is it? A
[1:42:01] transformer? We got this transforming
[1:42:03] station right behind behind the the
[1:42:05] pavilion here. What does it do? It puts
[1:42:07] in certain voltage, runs it through
[1:42:09] those transformers, and then it changes
[1:42:11] it from whatever it is to thousands and
[1:42:13] thousands are coming right over us this
[1:42:15] morning. It totally transforms them. God
[1:42:19] takes our dirty, filthy, smuddy life and
[1:42:22] kills that old nature. We go through the
[1:42:25] transforming power of Jesus Christ and
[1:42:28] we come out of there a dynamo filled
[1:42:30] with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Not a
[1:42:33] weak person that can barely hang on from
[1:42:35] day to day, but a child of God that
[1:42:38] stands up there right in the middle of
[1:42:39] hell and say, "I'm standing for Jesus
[1:42:42] whether I feel it or whether I don't." I
[1:42:45] don't care what the devil says. Greater
[1:42:46] is he that is in me than he that is in
[1:42:49] the world. Come on, somebody. And when
[1:42:51] you're faced with opposition, what do
[1:42:53] you do? You quote his word. If ye abide
[1:42:56] me and my words abide in you, ask what
[1:42:59] she will. If any two on earth agree as
[1:43:01] touch in one thing, it shall be done.
[1:43:04] You have asked nothing in my name, but
[1:43:06] hitherto asked that you might receive.
[1:43:08] Oh, hallelujah. And you're right there.
[1:43:10] What happened to you? You went through
[1:43:12] the transformer and your life got
[1:43:15] changed. The doctor says you'll never
[1:43:16] get well, but your faith has come
[1:43:18] through the promise of God. By his
[1:43:20] stripe, I'm already healed. Cancer,
[1:43:23] leave my body. Sickness, leave my body.
[1:43:27] You can't do that on your own. But it's
[1:43:29] the transformer.
[1:43:31] But Satan don't transform,
[1:43:34] he conforms.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; So he puts images, styles,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; methodology.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what some of our great
[1:43:46] grandparents would say if you'd show
[1:43:48] them your iPhone after church?
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what they see? and you'd
[1:43:55] pull up different things and they'd
[1:43:56] think you you can see all that from from
[1:44:00] there.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we can we can do this. Oh my
[1:44:05] goodness.
[1:44:08] Boy, we're so blessed. Are we
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Some of you is addicted to your iPhone
[1:44:13] or your Droid just as bad as a drug
[1:44:14] addict is to their drugs.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; You can't stand it. It dings and you
[1:44:20] know whatever all the sounds, you've got
[1:44:21] a sound for every other thing and you
[1:44:23] can't even stand it. you're so addicted
[1:44:25] to it. I I sent shared an article the
[1:44:27] other day with someone where they was
[1:44:29] talking about and it was a scientific
[1:44:31] article of course not a preacher but
[1:44:32] they was talking about how that the
[1:44:34] people and they give an analogy of a
[1:44:36] woman sitting there and she had got to
[1:44:37] her desk and it was 8:00 and by 8:02 she
[1:44:40] had done looked at her her phone 14
[1:44:42] times by 8:20 it give how many times and
[1:44:45] went up to lunchtime several hundred
[1:44:47] times in the day and it's showing what
[1:44:50] it's doing to the brain Australia is
[1:44:52] looking at at laws right now of
[1:44:54] forbidding their used to have access
[1:44:56] into the internet because they're doing
[1:44:58] all these studies on the brain and
[1:45:00] showing that it's taking away. People
[1:45:02] can't even make conversation anymore. A
[1:45:05] lot of people can't even write a letter
[1:45:07] no more. All they know is texting. Come
[1:45:09] on, somebody. Don't you see what Satan
[1:45:11] is doing? He's changing the world. Look
[1:45:14] at AI. I saw it last night or read it
[1:45:17] where that the by survey, a recent
[1:45:19] survey, 61%
[1:45:21] of pastors are using AI to write their
[1:45:24] sermons.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; So, just in case you're wondering, mine
[1:45:28] did not come from AI.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:36] AI is writing songs. AI is singing
[1:45:40] songs. AI is coming up with all this.
[1:45:42] What in the world do we need? AI for it.
[1:45:45] We need J E S U S. If we're not careful,
[1:45:49] we're going to have an AI church, an AI
[1:45:51] Christians, an AI this, and we'll all
[1:45:53] wind up in an AI hell. But I'll tell you
[1:45:56] one thing, friend, AI is never going to
[1:45:58] replace the new births of baptism of the
[1:46:01] Holy Ghost. It will never replace
[1:46:03] anointed men of God that are led by the
[1:46:06] spirit of God. Oh, hallelujah. I don't
[1:46:09] care what Satan does. He will never get
[1:46:12] God's people to conform to his image
[1:46:14] because they've already been
[1:46:16] transformed.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Be ye not conformed to this world,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:46:30] your mind, that you may prove what is
[1:46:33] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:46:38] will of God.
[1:46:40] Notice 1 Corinthians 7:13.
[1:46:43] And they that use this world, here's
[1:46:48] your balance right here.
[1:46:50] And they that use this world
[1:46:54] as not abusing it.
[1:46:58] I don't mind telling you, I was really
[1:47:00] glad to get in Carol's little Buick and
[1:47:03] vision this morning and push that button
[1:47:06] and push the button on the garage door
[1:47:08] and back out of the driveway.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I didn't have to go out in the
[1:47:12] cold and get old Bessie and put the bits
[1:47:15] in her mouth.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Do I look like an Amish?
[1:47:23] Now, I'll tell you one thing. If it gets
[1:47:24] down to 9 degrees in the morning, ain't
[1:47:26] you glad you ain't got Bessie?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; What are we doing? We want to use this
[1:47:34] world,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; but not abuse it.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; I am so grateful for medications and
[1:47:43] things that God has allowed science to
[1:47:45] break into that helps the human race.
[1:47:50] as a pastor for decades and having to
[1:47:52] visit hospitals and seeing saints of God
[1:47:55] and go into the places where I've had to
[1:47:57] go and pray for people and see them in
[1:47:59] the state they were in. Even my own
[1:48:01] daughter Erica
[1:48:03] seeing the last months of her life
[1:48:11] and especially the last few days and few
[1:48:15] hours of her life
[1:48:17] seeing her suffer with such pain.
[1:48:23] How grateful I was that God had allowed
[1:48:26] science to break into a realm of
[1:48:29] medication to help
[1:48:31] ease that pain of the departure.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Any of you that's lost a loved one and
[1:48:36] suffered, you know what I'm talking
[1:48:37] about.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; But that very same medication
[1:48:43] can be turned right around and abused.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Look at the difference between use and
[1:48:50] abuse.
[1:48:52] Can you imagine? You've got a loved one
[1:48:54] and there's such horrific pain that
[1:48:55] they're screaming and dying, which is
[1:48:57] the way it used to be years ago.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; They would scream and die with
[1:49:01] pancreatic cancer and all types of
[1:49:03] different thing. It would have been
[1:49:05] absolutely horrific and it would have
[1:49:07] made an imprint on your mind that some
[1:49:10] of us would have never gotten over the
[1:49:12] rest of our life. Thank God God allowed
[1:49:15] them to break into something that we
[1:49:16] could use.
[1:49:19] But how many people abuse the same thing
[1:49:21] on the streets?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; The thing of it is, are we using the
[1:49:26] world
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; or are we abusing it?
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; They that use this world as not abusing
[1:49:39] it. For the fashion of this world passes
[1:49:43] away. Look at the word abusing. I ain't
[1:49:46] even going to try to to pronounce this
[1:49:48] word,
[1:49:49] but it means to use much or excessively
[1:49:54] or ill. So it doesn't mean in the way
[1:49:57] that we would think abuse, but it's not
[1:50:00] carrying the enjoyments of it to any
[1:50:04] excess.
[1:50:05] So it's the proper use.
[1:50:08] But what's the difference between use
[1:50:12] and abuse? Sure.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I know of several different saints
[1:50:16] through the years that maybe had a
[1:50:18] traumatic accident or something happened
[1:50:20] to them and they wound up being given a
[1:50:24] script for different pain meds of this
[1:50:26] and that and the other
[1:50:29] and they break over maybe one time and
[1:50:32] they're just in such pain they just
[1:50:34] can't take it no more. They break the
[1:50:36] order of the prescription
[1:50:39] and then they have to have it more and
[1:50:40] more and more and more regularly and
[1:50:42] more regularly.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; That same thing that helped them cope
[1:50:47] has now addicted them to its abilities.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Drive your car. Put
[1:50:59] Bessie in the barn tonight.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Drive your car.
[1:51:05] Yes, use your computers. Use your
[1:51:08] phones,
[1:51:10] but not abuse.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Don't let them control you
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; to where you become the addict
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; that you're addicted
[1:51:23] to fashion, addicted
[1:51:27] to science. Don't you understand? This
[1:51:30] is where the whole world is heading. And
[1:51:34] the sad part about it is friend, many of
[1:51:36] them are Christians and they're just as
[1:51:39] addicted as a sinner that don't know
[1:51:41] anything about God.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; But they do their religion. They go to
[1:51:45] church once a week. If they go to
[1:51:46] church, many of them don't go to church
[1:51:47] anymore because they don't think it's
[1:51:48] necessary. They'll go out just work on
[1:51:50] Sunday, you know, just do this and do
[1:51:52] that and go here and go there and do
[1:51:53] whatever on Sunday. If they're a great
[1:51:54] Christian, they have tattoos. You know,
[1:51:56] they're Christians and sword of the
[1:51:57] spirit and this that and the other. What
[1:51:58] is it? Empty vessels.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:02] They that would use this world make a
[1:52:06] necessary proper use of raignment
[1:52:10] places to worship. What is all this in
[1:52:12] your days? Is anything in your heavenly?
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; No. It's all of this earth.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for a sound system.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for a microphone.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; I don't like ties cuz I hate suits, but
[1:52:26] it goes with my vocation, so I got to
[1:52:28] wear them. I'm glad we don't have
[1:52:30] sandals. I hate sandals.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; That's one of the reasons Jesus didn't
[1:52:36] let me live 2,000 years ago. He knew I'd
[1:52:38] never go around barefooted. I'm a
[1:52:40] tenderfoot.
[1:52:43] We want to use it, but not to where it
[1:52:46] turns around on us.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And then we become abusive. And the very
[1:52:52] thing that we're abusing
[1:52:54] starts controlling us. How horrible it
[1:52:56] is when we as Christians are being
[1:53:00] controlled by things
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; things.
[1:53:12] Lord Jesus,
[1:53:15] let me find a place to stop. James 4:4.
[1:53:21] You adulterers and adulteresses,
[1:53:24] know ye not that the friendship of the
[1:53:26] world is enmity with God?
[1:53:31] Whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[1:53:33] the world is an enemy.
[1:53:37] You can't get no plainer than this,
[1:53:38] friends.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; An enemy.
[1:53:44] The enemy of God. So, Brother Don, I go
[1:53:48] to Walmart. Should I be mean to people?
[1:53:50] No. When I go to Lowe's and you brothers
[1:53:52] go into Lowe's and buy your building
[1:53:54] material and you do this that should you
[1:53:55] be mean to every light and I'm speak
[1:53:57] nobody to turn. No, let your light so
[1:53:59] shine.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; But whenever we become to where we're
[1:54:04] closer to the people of the world than
[1:54:05] we are Christians
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; and we'd rather hang around sinners and
[1:54:09] repbates than we would children of God.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with us. Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[1:54:20] the world is the enemy of God.
[1:54:25] So friendship with the world. Now James
[1:54:27] written this wrote this 2,000 years ago.
[1:54:29] And he identified it as people
[1:54:31] committing adultery. Strange, isn't it?
[1:54:34] Adulterers and adulteresses. So he uses
[1:54:36] it in a figurative figurative
[1:54:39] metaphorical style to where they would
[1:54:41] be able to relate to it. So it would be
[1:54:43] as a woman that's giving her affections.
[1:54:46] Start out first with her affections
[1:54:47] touching whatever and then initially
[1:54:49] it's going to wind up with her body if
[1:54:50] she goes that far or the man and they
[1:54:53] wind up giving that to another. And
[1:54:55] James uses this to be able to say this
[1:54:58] is what happens whenever you will give
[1:55:00] the world your affections.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; So those of you that scream and holler
[1:55:05] at a ball game,
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; how do you do when you come to church?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:15] rut row.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm not an emotional person.
[1:55:22] I've done seen some of your pictures of
[1:55:23] you all at sporting events. You ain't
[1:55:26] going to convince me you're not
[1:55:28] emotional.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Your grandson gets out there, he's knee
[1:55:33] high to a grasshopper, and he hits that
[1:55:35] ball out there three feet for the
[1:55:36] preacher.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:42] and you go to church and et
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; we're not worshippers. We're
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; nodders.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want your
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I want your amens.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Not only do I want them, God wants them.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; I did a wedding here yesterday. One of
[1:56:08] the little bitty guys from the church
[1:56:10] was here. Him and his little brother.
[1:56:13] His older little brother was looking at
[1:56:14] him and said, "That's brother Donnie.
[1:56:17] That's brother Donnie." And his little
[1:56:19] brother is with him. And he looked at me
[1:56:20] and said, "Amen."
[1:56:28] I thought, "How awesome."
[1:56:31] That's right. That's what we want our
[1:56:34] children to learn how to say. I don't
[1:56:36] mind them saying, "Oh, I'd rather they
[1:56:38] say that than basketball, baseball,
[1:56:40] soccer." When they see me and they say,
[1:56:42] "Amen." I take that as a great
[1:56:44] compliment.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I saw him several different times
[1:56:48] yesterday out in front over in the
[1:56:50] fellowship hall. Every time he'd get
[1:56:51] around me, he said, "Amen."
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's the way I want to
[1:56:56] do the word of God. And every man of
[1:56:58] God's preaching, I want to say, "Amen."
[1:57:01] I want it to come up to heaven that I'm
[1:57:03] saying, "Brother Brad, amen." Amen.
[1:57:05] Lord, if the world can laugh and scream
[1:57:07] and holler, what about us as children of
[1:57:10] God?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But a woman that would give her
[1:57:21] love to another man,
[1:57:24] if it was no more than wink at him, you
[1:57:27] wouldn't want your wife doing that.
[1:57:31] If it was no more than just sending him
[1:57:33] a text and there's only one and you
[1:57:35] never send another one, you would never
[1:57:38] want your wife to do that.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Neither does Jesus.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; He don't want his wife flirting with
[1:57:46] sin.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; He don't want his wife texting hell.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; But Jesus wants all her love.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And he deserves it all.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. Love your family. Absolutely.
[1:58:01] Love getting together with them. Love
[1:58:03] holiday time. Don't just love holiday
[1:58:05] time. Other time. Remember,
[1:58:09] God gives you people in your life and
[1:58:12] one day he will call them back.
[1:58:16] They're a great treasure to you.
[1:58:20] Let's stand together. Amen.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; You see friends, to love the world in
[1:58:25] this sense,
[1:58:27] it makes it a competitor
[1:58:30] to God.
[1:58:33] So it's like both God and the world are
[1:58:36] competing
[1:58:38] for your time.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; The deep sense of your affection from
[1:58:43] your soul. Can you like basketball?
[1:58:46] Sure. Can you like football? Sure you
[1:58:49] can.
[1:58:50] To me, a lot of that stuff makes no
[1:58:52] sense at all. And I know some of you
[1:58:55] say, "Brother Donnie, you go hunting."
[1:58:57] I'll tell I'll tell Carol, "We went to
[1:58:59] Illinois hunting and she said,"What's
[1:59:00] the weather going to be?" I Well, it's
[1:59:02] going to be 8° one morning. It's going
[1:59:03] to be 9°. She said, "Donnie, that makes
[1:59:06] no sense to me. You're going to get up
[1:59:09] 4:30 in the morning. You're going to put
[1:59:10] on clothes and wind up looking like the
[1:59:12] abominable snowman. Get out there and
[1:59:15] walk in there and sit there for hours
[1:59:17] and you may not even say anything."
[1:59:19] thing. I said, "But you may."
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; And even if I don't, I've got my iPad
[1:59:28] with me and I've got my phone with me
[1:59:30] and I've got a little MP3 player with
[1:59:32] me. Believe me, you have benefited
[1:59:34] already from my hunting trip in
[1:59:35] Illinois.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; But each one of us have things that are
[1:59:42] of this earth that we enjoy. We like
[1:59:44] some people walk in the park, some
[1:59:46] people ride a horse, some other I
[1:59:48] wouldn't give you a nickel for every
[1:59:50] horse that you could get. Well, you have
[1:59:52] something you like.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Is that wrong? No.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Not unless you make it wrong.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; And it gets so much a hold of you that's
[2:00:04] all you think about.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many wants to be godly?
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; It's just the length of your hair, your
[2:00:17] dress. Your brothers, oh, you want to be
[2:00:19] godly. Oh, I don't want to visit porn
[2:00:21] sites. I don't want I'm talking about
[2:00:22] that, too. And I'm talking about things
[2:00:26] that in reality sometimes it gets down
[2:00:28] to only you and God
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; know about it.
[2:00:32] You see, we want to be the type of
[2:00:34] believers that we live the same kind of
[2:00:37] life whether we are by oursel
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; or if the pastor's sitting right next to
[2:00:43] us.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Or even more so, the Lord Jesus.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Do I believe it will happen? I don't
[2:00:56] believe it will. I know it will.
[2:01:00] My God don't say things that somebody
[2:01:02] ain't going to fulfill.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And by his grace, I plan on being one of
[2:01:06] them.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; If I have a right to choose, and I do,
[2:01:11] then I have a right to choose to live
[2:01:15] this way.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're afraid. No. No. I am not
[2:01:20] afraid I will go to hell because I never
[2:01:21] come to from hell and I'm not going back
[2:01:24] to it.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I choose to live this way.
[2:01:29] I choose to live this way.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; I love it myself.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I love this life. I love being a
[2:01:36] Christian. I love hearing God's voice.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; It's just it's just absolutely one of
[2:01:42] the most awesome things in my life is
[2:01:45] for him to speak to me and give me a
[2:01:48] word. Whether it's a word for a funeral,
[2:01:50] a word for somebody that's sick, a a
[2:01:53] sermon title, whatever it is, just to
[2:01:55] hear from him. And sometimes it's just
[2:01:57] words straight to me just to let me
[2:02:00] know. Want to let you know I love you
[2:02:03] today.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; I'd rather have that than all the things
[2:02:07] of the world you could pile in a pile.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz after a while they're all going to
[2:02:11] burn.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; We love our new place, don't we? Our
[2:02:14] church. God's been good to us and
[2:02:16] blessed us. But you know what? One of
[2:02:17] these days this will be turned into ash
[2:02:20] and rubble.
[2:02:25] So what do we come here for? To get
[2:02:28] something from the word so we won't be
[2:02:30] turned to ash and rubble with it.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; One of these days my Bible will be
[2:02:36] destroyed and burned just like yours. My
[2:02:39] iPad contains hundreds and hundreds of
[2:02:41] sermons that are preached around the
[2:02:43] world. But one day that iPad will be
[2:02:46] nothing but ash.
[2:02:48] But I won't be
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm taking what I'm putting here in
[2:02:52] this iPad because these sermons ain't
[2:02:53] just for you. They from the preacher,
[2:02:55] too.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him with all your heart?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Come and bow our heads today.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; I realize on this time of the year,
[2:03:05] everyone head bowed, please. No one
[2:03:07] looking around.
[2:03:09] People thinking about Christmas and for
[2:03:12] the most part, it's not really about
[2:03:14] Jesus anymore anyway and hadn't been in
[2:03:15] a long time. It's more about family and
[2:03:18] family getting together and this and
[2:03:20] that. And people think about, well, I
[2:03:23] got to buy my kids something. I got to
[2:03:24] buy my grandkids something and it's
[2:03:26] about presents and think, well, what
[2:03:28] would they like and what would they
[2:03:29] want? Well, we've got to wrap it up and
[2:03:32] all this, that, and the other.
[2:03:34] But I wonder
[2:03:37] if today we might could give a present,
[2:03:39] if you want to call it that, to the Lord
[2:03:42] Jesus.
[2:03:45] You won't find it at Walmart or Amazon
[2:03:47] or Big Lots or Nordstrom or some Macy's.
[2:03:53] I'll tell you where you can find it. You
[2:03:55] can find it in your own soul.
[2:03:58] Jesus wants you.
[2:04:02] All of you.
[2:04:04] Now, he understands better than anyone
[2:04:06] else that that all of you may take years
[2:04:09] for you to finally get it. It's not that
[2:04:11] it takes him that long to receive it.
[2:04:14] But it can just take us a long time to
[2:04:16] give it. We'll give him a little and
[2:04:18] then a little more and then a little
[2:04:20] more, then a little more.
[2:04:23] And Jesus will take every bit that we'll
[2:04:25] give him. And he receives it into his
[2:04:27] arms and says, "Thank you, Darl. You
[2:04:31] give me more of yourself today.
[2:04:35] Thank you, young lady. Thank you, elder
[2:04:38] people. You gave me a little more of you
[2:04:41] today. I have been waiting for this for
[2:04:44] 45 years.
[2:04:47] Thank you so much.
[2:04:50] I've had people to give me gifts from
[2:04:52] around the world and I knew they were so
[2:04:54] poor
[2:04:56] and I hated to even take it. I've had
[2:04:59] people from our church to give me things
[2:05:00] and do things for me and I just hold it
[2:05:04] my hands and just cry
[2:05:07] cuz I know they couldn't really afford
[2:05:08] to do that.
[2:05:10] But Jesus is not asking you for
[2:05:12] something that's beyond your budget.
[2:05:15] He's not asking you to put a great debt
[2:05:18] on your credit card.
[2:05:21] He just simply wants you to give
[2:05:24] your heart to him completely. I'm not
[2:05:26] talking about now you being saved. I'm
[2:05:29] talking after you got saved. Give him
[2:05:31] your pride, your arrogance, your
[2:05:33] selfishness, whatever it is that's held
[2:05:36] you back.
[2:05:40] Is there anybody here today? I'm not
[2:05:42] going to press you now. If you don't
[2:05:44] mind it, don't do it. Is there anybody
[2:05:46] here today and say, "Jesus,
[2:05:49] I want to give you something.
[2:05:51] I want to give you me."
[2:05:54] Look in the corners of my heart, Lord.
[2:05:56] Do you find any secret compartments,
[2:05:59] any secret sins, anything that I've held
[2:06:01] on to that I've just not been able to
[2:06:04] give up? Would you take it, Lord?
[2:06:09] I'm going to raise both of my hands and
[2:06:11] then we're going to pray together
[2:06:14] because I too like you want to give him
[2:06:17] my all.
[2:06:20] Lord Jesus, as we come to the closing of
[2:06:25] this service,
[2:06:27] another one that the recorders, as it
[2:06:29] were in heaven, will stop recording
[2:06:32] soon. And one day I'll stand before the
[2:06:34] throne of God and I'll give an account
[2:06:37] for what I've preached today.
[2:06:40] Not only will I, but all these folks
[2:06:42] here today, those that have streamed it,
[2:06:45] those that'll stream it and archive it
[2:06:46] around the world, every one of them
[2:06:48] will.
[2:06:52] So Lord, Carol and I have got to a place
[2:06:54] to where we really don't do the
[2:06:56] Christmas thing. We don't need anything
[2:06:59] really, per se, and
[2:07:01] no need in buying something. we don't
[2:07:03] need or want. So,
[2:07:06] but in reality, we have from each other
[2:07:10] what we want and that is each other.
[2:07:14] So, today Lord Jesus,
[2:07:17] I pray you'd help us, Father,
[2:07:20] from the young to the old,
[2:07:23] those in the front row, those in the
[2:07:24] back, those in the mezzanine.
[2:07:28] We're not going to bring it with pretty
[2:07:30] Christmas paper.
[2:07:32] We don't feel the necessity of a ribbon
[2:07:34] or a bow.
[2:07:37] We bring this package to you and
[2:07:40] you already know it, but we're telling
[2:07:42] you that it's got flaws in it.
[2:07:47] We're telling you that we're not giving
[2:07:48] you a perfect package today.
[2:07:52] But we know as long as we keep it,
[2:07:55] it'll never be able to be transformative
[2:07:58] at all.
[2:08:00] But if we can give it to you,
[2:08:03] then you can do with us like you did the
[2:08:05] little boy's lunch that day.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; The little boy skipped school, as we'd
[2:08:11] say, and his mama had packed him some
[2:08:13] fishes and some loaves.
[2:08:17] And the little boy decided to stay out
[2:08:19] of school. And there's a big crowd over
[2:08:22] and he didn't know what it was. And it
[2:08:24] was Jesus. It was you. So the little boy
[2:08:28] heard you preaching.
[2:08:30] Then it was lunchtime, but they didn't
[2:08:32] have enough money to buy lunch for
[2:08:33] everybody.
[2:08:35] So you sent your disciples out among
[2:08:37] them. That little boy was willing to
[2:08:39] give his lunch.
[2:08:41] In his hands, it was enough lunch for
[2:08:45] one little hungry boy.
[2:08:48] But in the hands of Jesus,
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:08:55] it was able to be changed and multiplied
[2:08:57] and transformed
[2:08:59] to feed thousands times thousands of
[2:09:02] people.
[2:09:05] So Lord God, maybe our little praise and
[2:09:07] our little hallelujah and our little
[2:09:09] amens, we may sit there and think, well,
[2:09:11] my amen's not important. My little amen
[2:09:14] and my praise the Lord and my little
[2:09:17] this and that is not important.
[2:09:20] That may be true
[2:09:22] as long as we keep it to oursel. But
[2:09:25] when we give our amen to you, maybe the
[2:09:28] preacher himself is struggling cuz it
[2:09:30] seem like nobody's saying nothing and
[2:09:32] nobody's responding.
[2:09:35] And it might be a little sister, it
[2:09:37] might be a young boy, might be that
[2:09:39] little blondheaded feller I seen
[2:09:41] yesterday and he bellers out an amen.
[2:09:45] And it encourages me to keep on going.
[2:09:49] So Lord Jesus,
[2:09:51] we're not putting it under a tree
[2:09:55] because our Christmas package was
[2:09:57] actually placed on a tree.
[2:10:01] It wasn't wrapped in beautiful paper and
[2:10:03] bows.
[2:10:05] But it was wrapped in human flesh.
[2:10:09] And I hear our Christmas package as it
[2:10:11] were scream out from the tree. Eli,
[2:10:17] Eli,
[2:10:19] lay me sabathi.
[2:10:23] My God, my God, why
[2:10:27] has thou forsaken me?
[2:10:32] and you died forsaken
[2:10:34] so that when I die
[2:10:37] I won't have to be.
[2:10:40] Take us, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:43] Father, help me. I've been serving you,
[2:10:47] Lord, since I was just a 12-year-old boy
[2:10:49] and preaching since I was 18.
[2:10:52] I still don't feel like I've got much to
[2:10:53] give you.
[2:10:56] There won't be too many more settings of
[2:10:57] the sun. my memory will start getting
[2:10:59] away from me and my strength will start
[2:11:01] being more depleted and if time carries
[2:11:04] eventually the church will have to get
[2:11:07] him a younger man that'll be able to
[2:11:09] come and preach to him.
[2:11:12] But Lord, whatever I have left,
[2:11:15] I want to give it to you, Lord.
[2:11:18] Please, Jesus. I know I've never
[2:11:20] preached a perfect sermon. I've never
[2:11:22] sang a perfect song.
[2:11:25] But Lord God, if you're willing to take
[2:11:26] it with its mistakes and flaws, I'm
[2:11:30] willing to give it to you.
[2:11:33] We worship you today, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:36] We bless your holy name, Father.
[2:11:41] Anybody here just willing to offer Jesus
[2:11:45] everything that you are
[2:11:48] with all of your heart?
[2:11:51] Oh, you imagine you you parents and your
[2:11:53] children open the little things you get
[2:11:55] for them and your grandchildren and
[2:11:57] they're so excited and you know what's
[2:11:58] in there and you got your camera out and
[2:12:01] you're just waiting.
[2:12:03] Can you imagine right here in this
[2:12:05] presence day today? The angels of God
[2:12:07] are here. They're standing right there
[2:12:09] in the aisles and they're nudging you to
[2:12:12] give Jesus that little corner of your
[2:12:14] life, that pride, that arrogance, that
[2:12:17] this and that and the other that you've
[2:12:19] held back from him.
[2:12:21] How Jesus must rejoice.
[2:12:25] Hallelujah.
[2:12:27] When he says, "Finally,
[2:12:30] finally, after 28 years, my son gave me
[2:12:34] this. My daughter after 20 years gave me
[2:12:36] that, this preacher gave me that,
[2:12:39] surrendered this, that, the other. Oh,
[2:12:43] praise the Lord.
[2:12:45] Praise the Lord, Jesus.
[2:12:48] We worship you today, Father.
[2:12:51] Oh, come let us adore
[2:12:58] you. Oh come let us adore
[2:13:07] him. Oh come let us adore
[2:13:15] him.

[2:24:34] Hallelujah.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, in this season of giving,
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; let us just give every
[2:24:47] us
[2:24:49] for his glory.
[2:24:53] You know, my my life
[2:24:58] may not look like much to the world.
[2:25:04] Brother Donnie sent me a picture this
[2:25:07] morning of that one of the last pennies
[2:25:09] that was minted
[2:25:12] sold for $17 million
[2:25:19] to the world.
[2:25:21] I may be but a penny,
[2:25:24] but all that really matters
[2:25:27] is what he sees
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; our worth to be.
[2:25:33] And if I'm a penny in his hand, there's
[2:25:36] no better place to be than in his hand.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Bless
[2:25:48] you, Lord.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; But if I am a penny, let me give
[2:25:52] everything that I have
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; for his service.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; For I'll never answer for being a dime.
[2:25:59] I'll never answer for being a quarter,
[2:26:03] but let me answer for what he made me.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Because there's one thing about our God.
[2:26:10] He don't make no junk.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for that today?
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Have you enjoyed the word of God this
[2:26:18] morning?
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; It's so good to be in the house of God.
[2:26:24] And I'm so glad that Brother Donniey's
[2:26:26] messages doesn't come from AI.
[2:26:30] But they come from IIA,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; the I am.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; I thought that was pretty good.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you richly today. Go
[2:26:42] with your family. Enjoy your time
[2:26:43] together. Remember the service Wednesday
[2:26:46] night. Let's just bow our heads.
[2:26:54] Father God, it's
[2:26:56] it's in moments like this, Lord, that
[2:27:00] I really don't know what to say.
[2:27:04] I really
[2:27:06] don't know quite how to put the words
[2:27:08] together to express what I feel.
[2:27:12] So Lord, I ask you this morning to
[2:27:14] listen to my heart
[2:27:17] for it speaks a language
[2:27:20] that my brain don't understand.
[2:27:24] And Lord, I pray that you would go with
[2:27:25] your people today.
[2:27:28] Protect them on the road, Lord. Bless
[2:27:30] their families,
[2:27:32] those that are sick and unable to be in
[2:27:34] the house of God.
[2:27:36] You are our healer. Lord, may you
[2:27:38] minister to them. Be our prayer.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, bring us back safely
[2:27:45] Wednesday night with this desire.
[2:27:49] Take my heart, Lord.
[2:27:51] take my life
[2:27:54] as a living sacrifice.
[2:27:57] Grant it Lord we pray today. Thank you
[2:28:00] for the service. Strengthen brother
[2:28:02] Donnie Lord we ask.
[2:28:04] Thank you Lord for allowing us to sit
[2:28:07] under such a ministry. We are so
[2:28:09] grateful in our hearts.
[2:28:12] Thank you Lord for all that you have
[2:28:14] done for us.
[2:28:18] Thank you Lord
[2:28:20] for loving us
[2:28:23] as we commit these things into your
[2:28:25] hands
[2:28:27] for your glory in Jesus name.
[2:28:31] Amen.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Let's just sing it
[2:28:35] again as you're dismissed. I give myself
[2:28:37] away. May the Lord bless you richly.
[2:28:41] Go ahead.
[2:28:42] Give myself away.
[2:28:50] I give myself away
[2:28:54] so you can use me. I give myself away.
[2:29:06] I give myself away
[2:29:09] so you can use me. Here I am.
[2:29:18] Here I stand,
[2:29:21] Lord. My life is in
[2:29:26] your hands.
[2:29:29] Lord, I'm longing
[2:29:34] to see
[2:29:37] your desires
[2:29:40] reveal
[2:29:42] in me.
[2:29:44] I give myself away.
[2:29:51] I give myself away
[2:29:55] so you can use me. I give myself away.
[2:30:07] I give myself away
[2:30:10] so you can use me. Take my heart.

[2:30:22] as a livinging
[2:30:26] sacriice.
[2:30:30] All
[2:30:31] my dreams
[2:30:33] and all my plans.
[2:30:37] Lord, I
[2:30:40] still in
[2:30:42] your hands.
[2:30:45] Give myself away.
[2:30:52] I give myself away
[2:30:56] so you can use me. I give myself away.
