[31:19] life we pray in Jesus Christ's name and
[31:22] everybody said a man god bless you this
[31:25] morning you may be seated
[31:26] may the Lord had his blessings to the
[31:27] reading of his word I want to read to
[31:30] you this morning to get our hearts going
[31:33] a certain direction in the scripture I
[31:35] want to read how the message desperation
[31:38] 1963 is where we'll get our our subject
[31:41] from also from the message communion
[31:43] 1957 but I'll make some of the remarks
[31:45] we're gonna look at but he makes a
[31:47] statement in desperation and he says our
[31:50] dear Lord Jesus himself in the world's
[31:54] greatest battleground the world's
[31:57] greatest battleground Gethsemane he
[32:00] cried out in despair should he take the
[32:04] sins of the world or so he just remained
[32:06] on earth with his beloved disciples what
[32:09] he wanted to do but watch his humility
[32:11] as he humbled himself he said not my
[32:15] will but mine been done he humbled
[32:17] himself to the word and the promised
[32:20] Word of God of heaven and notice then he
[32:23] went a little further if he went a
[32:24] little further
[32:25] how much more ought we to go a little
[32:28] further and notice the scripture says
[32:30] here in the loop that he prayed
[32:32] earnestly brother sister if Jesus had to
[32:35] pray earnestly how much more have we got
[32:38] to pray earnestly if Christ the God of
[32:41] heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly
[32:44] then how much more that we sinners saved
[32:47] by grace pray earnestly if the decision
[32:51] throw the son of God into despair what
[32:53] will it do to you and I desperately we
[32:57] must cry we understand this moment in
[33:01] Gethsemane is unlike any other place
[33:05] that we would read in the scripture of
[33:07] Jesus's life in this place in the script
[33:11] the passion of this moment so captivates
[33:14] me and I'm amazed by what I read here in
[33:17] Matthew 26 I'm amazed the hell that
[33:20] Jesus is able to divide and separate
[33:24] divinity from humanity and we see that
[33:28] this thing that's going to take place is
[33:30] we are been taught about in the
[33:32] scripture over and over again for years
[33:34] and years this is where Jesus's life had
[33:37] come this is why his ministry has been
[33:40] sent for and has been brought to and now
[33:43] it brings Jesus to the greatest place
[33:45] that he would ever be in his life the
[33:47] greatest moment that would ever take
[33:49] place after all the miracles that Jesus
[33:52] had done after all the people that had
[33:54] been touched by the Ministry of the Lord
[33:56] after all the things that Jesus had had
[33:59] done and had prayed and had said after
[34:02] all the teaching that had been done
[34:04] after all the things that had amazed the
[34:07] people that Jesus would speak to not
[34:09] only was Jesus we see not only is Jesus
[34:14] our Savior not only is he our Redeemer
[34:17] but Jesus is also our teacher amen
[34:20] a lot of people want Jesus as Savior
[34:22] they want him as a miracle worker they
[34:25] want him as a healer but Jesus is also
[34:27] our teacher we can take his life and be
[34:30] taught by what demand the human the
[34:32] humanity was able to do and we see here
[34:35] is Jesus and how he comes to this place
[34:38] in his ministry and you know it's a it's
[34:41] amazing for me after all the great
[34:43] things that had been done how that I
[34:45] would so have loved to be able to see it
[34:47] and hear Jesus preach the gospel how
[34:50] amazing that would have been to be able
[34:52] to sit there and hear his words and how
[34:55] that he presents things and says it in a
[34:57] certain way a way that no other preacher
[35:00] has ever said you believe that a way
[35:02] that no other teacher has ever sent it
[35:04] oh my how I would have loved to be able
[35:07] to hear him preach I would have loved to
[35:10] be able to stand there at the tomb of
[35:12] Lazarus when jesus walks to that tomb in
[35:15] his little small frail body and then he
[35:18] removes his shoulders back and begins to
[35:21] speak to
[35:22] that tune to a body that was dead inside
[35:25] that grate and to see Lazarus come out
[35:27] of that grave dressing those great I
[35:29] would have loved to have seen that I
[35:31] would have loved to seen Jesus be able
[35:34] to take and speak to the wind and to be
[35:36] able to speak to the water you talking
[35:38] about a powerful preacher a man that can
[35:41] stand on the bow of the boat and speak
[35:43] to win and speak to water two parts
[35:46] hydrogen one part oxygen and water and
[35:48] hydrogen obey what Jesus says you're
[35:52] talking about a powerful preacher when
[35:54] the wind obeys what a man says when the
[35:56] very water of the world had been created
[35:59] by the creator of heavens and earth
[36:01] stood on the ballot that boat that water
[36:03] had to give way to the words of Jesus I
[36:05] would have loved to stand there and
[36:08] watched him as he takes him from his
[36:11] tired body from preaching the meetings
[36:13] and how he stood there and the people
[36:15] was scared to death but yet Jesus knew
[36:18] who he was hallelujah jesus knew who he
[36:23] was and he stands there and speaks the
[36:25] word just seemed take as a boy was
[36:27] coming to a camp as he has skipped
[36:29] school that way and as he moves into
[36:31] this camp he takes that little Snoopy
[36:33] lunchbox and takes out some bread and
[36:36] takes out some fish and begins to
[36:38] multiply that bread right in his hand I
[36:40] would have loved this 10 there and
[36:42] watches that bread materialized when he
[36:45] breaks one piece off in another piece
[36:47] appears and he breaks another piece off
[36:49] in another piece of fear I would have
[36:51] loved to have seen that I would have
[36:54] loved to be in there that day that when
[36:56] Jesus walked by that fig tree and that
[36:58] fig tree was not producing fruit like
[37:01] it's supposed to be producing and to see
[37:04] Jesus speak to that fig tree and he
[37:06] cursed the very roots of that tree and
[37:08] that tree begin to wither away I would
[37:11] have loved to seen it when Jesus went to
[37:13] the wedding that day and he breached
[37:15] down in that water and he turned the
[37:17] water into wine I would have loved to
[37:19] been there I would have loved to been
[37:21] identified with it I would have loved to
[37:23] seen it and the reason we love those
[37:27] things it's because that's the divinity
[37:31] of the Lord Jesus
[37:33] that's something we can't relate to
[37:37] we can't relate to take bread and also
[37:40] fine I've never done it and I doubt you
[37:42] have either
[37:43] we can't relate to a God that allows the
[37:46] wind and the water told me but to hear
[37:49] those things we love to hear it preached
[37:52] we love to hear it preached about and
[37:55] talked about there's been a million
[37:57] sermons and has been wrote about the
[37:59] divinity of Jesus it's because the
[38:02] divinity of Jesus is the very opposite
[38:05] of our lives it's the opposite of what
[38:07] we do it's the office I've been yet we
[38:09] love him for this creators as sons of
[38:13] God we long for that position we love
[38:16] for that authority of the word of God we
[38:19] love to come to that place that the wind
[38:21] has to obey us as Eve spoke that day in
[38:24] the garden and when Adam begins to speak
[38:26] to that we're because it was the desire
[38:28] of Eve I'm amazed at the power of God
[38:34] I'm amazed at the how that God can do
[38:38] things the way he doesn't but really
[38:41] what we need help with is not the
[38:45] divinity of Jesus but I submit to you
[38:49] what we need help with is the humanity
[38:52] of Jesus everybody loves to preach about
[38:58] feeding 5,000 everybody loves to hear
[39:01] about the great healing campaigns
[39:03] everybody loves to hear of the signs and
[39:05] the wonders and the miracles and as long
[39:09] as Jesus was doing those things the
[39:11] crowds was following him around the
[39:14] crowds followed they loved as a matter
[39:17] of fact they was there to see the
[39:18] miracles done they was there to see the
[39:21] signs and the wonders performed they was
[39:24] there to see Jesus lay his hands on
[39:26] people that's crippled and they get up
[39:28] and walk
[39:29] they're there to watch Jesus lay his
[39:31] hands over on blinded eyes and though
[39:33] eyes would just come open at the very
[39:35] creation of the creator that's why the
[39:37] crowd was following him they wanted to
[39:39] see signs they wanted to see wonders
[39:41] they wanted to see these things but
[39:43] come a time hallelujah in Jesus's
[39:46] ministry where all of that was going to
[39:48] take a backseat what would happen next
[39:54] would be different than anything he had
[39:57] ever done what would happen next what's
[40:00] gonna be taken a man whose eyes sockets
[40:04] is there with no eyeballs and Jesus
[40:06] would take mud and wipe it in the man's
[40:09] eyes and he would create eyes how to
[40:11] merge that's not what gets him knees
[40:13] about guess simile is not about miracles
[40:16] so that sighs it's not about winders
[40:19] it's about humanity suffering he come to
[40:24] this place in this ministry the place of
[40:27] Gethsemane and when you come to this
[40:30] flesh every one of us no matter how long
[40:34] you serve God no matter how long you
[40:36] believe this message every one of us
[40:39] will have to go through a guest simony
[40:44] guest simony is not a place of shouting
[40:47] guests see me is not a place of great
[40:50] themes taking Gethsemane is actually a
[40:53] place of separation people will not stay
[40:58] forget simony crowds will not be
[41:02] gathered forget simony there's not going
[41:05] to be hundreds and thousands of people
[41:07] lined up to see Gethsemane gasps simony
[41:11] has no attraction to it oh but let me
[41:15] tell you if you are a true disciple of
[41:18] Jesus Christ
[41:19] you're going to stay with him through
[41:20] the thick and the fence whether it's
[41:23] signs and wonders or miracles you're
[41:25] going to be there no matter how it's
[41:26] taking place you're a true disciple and
[41:28] you're following him no matter watch too
[41:34] many people serve God out of
[41:35] circumstance preach brother David as
[41:39] always everything is going good we
[41:40] believe God loves everything's going
[41:42] fine
[41:43] we're in revival long as everything is
[41:45] doing the way we think it should be your
[41:47] and everything's being said the way we
[41:48] think it should be said we are happy but
[41:50] let me tell you let sensor we must serve
[41:52] God more than just circumstances what
[41:55] will you do
[41:56] the enemy turns your life upside down
[41:58] what would you do when you face the
[42:00] greatest trial your life
[42:01] how are you overcome during those times
[42:07] people want perfect circumstances we can
[42:11] shout with the best coupling gods
[42:13] pouring out the blessings we can lift
[42:15] our hands and praise God and thank God
[42:18] for it whenever the blessings is coming
[42:19] out but let me tell you what are you
[42:21] gonna do when great trouble strikes your
[42:23] heart what are you going to do when you
[42:25] face the trial there Gethsemane of your
[42:27] life
[42:28] and you don't have nowhere else to turn
[42:29] and it seems the heavens is like brass
[42:31] and you can't get an answer from God at
[42:33] that time brother what will you do then
[42:39] we're a god we love God because of
[42:41] circumstances sometimes you know what I
[42:47] hate I hate false presentations don't
[42:52] you I hate looking at something that's
[42:54] being advertised to be this but when you
[42:57] actually get it it's something else have
[42:59] you ever went through a drive-thru
[43:01] window and you're going through that job
[43:02] through a window and you look up there
[43:04] and you're trying to decide between the
[43:05] cheeseburger and the salad and you know
[43:07] you need to sell it but you want the
[43:08] cheeseburger and you look up there and
[43:10] man that salad looks so good and the
[43:12] lettuce looks so fresh everything looks
[43:14] rotten man those tomatoes on there they
[43:17] look so fresh and so wrong man they are
[43:19] just perfect and how they got a little
[43:21] bit of dude dripping off the pieces of
[43:23] the lettuce and you're thinking man
[43:24] that's what I'm gonna have and you pull
[43:26] around to the drive-through window and
[43:28] they hand you a bag out the window and
[43:30] you take that bag and you open it up and
[43:33] you take the lid off that salad and it's
[43:36] brown and you pick up the tomato and
[43:41] they have given you the very end of the
[43:45] tomato and you're looking at this sound
[43:47] and it's dry there's no moisture on and
[43:50] you know why it's not presented as it
[43:52] was advertised I'm afraid that we have
[43:55] presented this gospel to look so good
[43:58] and so pretty too many preachers are
[44:00] preaching upon the sky and the vine by
[44:01] their preaching no trouble no problems
[44:04] Oh child nothing going wrong by the NATO
[44:06] a mile
[44:07] we thought he'll every day we find
[44:09] sickness and trouble everywhere we look
[44:12] they are coming against us in the garden
[44:19] there's no Crouch
[44:21] there's no masses of people there's not
[44:25] five thousand to be fed in the garden
[44:28] there's no one to be healed but when
[44:32] Jesus comes to the garden he comes to
[44:36] the garden alone alone
[44:42] he made argue that the cross was the
[44:47] greatest moment in all history not dance
[44:51] a man for that today
[44:53] the cross was amazing it was on the
[44:58] cross that my sins was paid in full it
[45:04] was on the cross that my debt paid
[45:07] it was actually canceled because of the
[45:09] cross it was there that every hope of
[45:12] every believer become eternal because a
[45:15] price that was paid on the cross it was
[45:20] at the cross that every curse was broken
[45:23] it was there at the cross at the scene
[45:27] was actually defeated it was at the
[45:29] cross that justice collapsed itself into
[45:33] the arms of mercies where they're having
[45:35] at the cross it was at the cross that
[45:39] the priests become the lamb is at the
[45:45] cross but let me submit to you the cross
[45:50] was settled before the first nail ever
[45:53] hit Jesus
[45:56] think about it before there was a crown
[45:59] of thorns foot on his head there was
[46:01] already a decision that was made the
[46:04] cross was conquered before he ever went
[46:06] to Pilate Hall and the cross had already
[46:08] been conquered where to become conquered
[46:11] and the greatest battleground the world
[46:13] has ever seen
[46:15] the greatest battleground it is not Iraq
[46:18] the greatest battleground it's not
[46:20] Afghanistan the greatest battleground
[46:22] it's not Syria the greatest battleground
[46:26] for you and me it's Gethsemane let's
[46:33] cross the cross wasn't settled on a tree
[46:37] oh god that's good
[46:39] it wasn't settled on a tree in public
[46:43] display for everybody to see I got a
[46:47] reason I'm saying that because the
[46:49] struggle of the will of God for your
[46:51] life
[46:51] it isn't settled on a public display of
[46:54] power hello you're somebody but our
[46:59] struggle is settled in our private
[47:02] gardens in our private gardens
[47:07] it's where our troubles are settled at
[47:09] it's in our private gardens it's where
[47:11] we submit ourselves to the will of God
[47:13] it's in our private gardens it's where
[47:16] everything finds a way to overcome is in
[47:20] our garden it's in our private gardens
[47:24] is where we wrestle with God's will oh
[47:26] not me brother David oh yes you and me
[47:29] we wrestle with him we talk to him we
[47:31] talk back to him but not me I never do
[47:37] that I do
[47:38] because there's things I want answers to
[47:40] that I can't get answers to and we're
[47:42] saying God why did you allow this have
[47:44] you ever best the question why Lord why
[47:46] did this happen why did that happen
[47:48] why did this take place why did that
[47:49] take place listen friends God knows what
[47:52] you need to go through to bring the best
[47:54] out of you it's in the garden that your
[47:59] will and he's actually combined and
[48:02] settled to lay his will be done
[48:05] it's in the garden that we asked God why
[48:08] don't you speak to me don't you say
[48:11] something to me Lord why have you gone
[48:14] this long without doing something for me
[48:16] why have you went this long without
[48:18] giving me some leadership
[48:20] why have you went this long without
[48:21] speaking no spill those feel small voice
[48:24] how long to hear that voice how long to
[48:27] hear those words
[48:28] what are you hear that and I am the
[48:29] great healing campaigns it ain't in the
[48:31] midst of shouting it's not to miss the
[48:33] miracles it's in our Gardens is where we
[48:35] hear it ash hitting our private moments
[48:40] it's during those times that all of our
[48:44] Francey prayers are put behind us all of
[48:47] our deeds and our veils preached mother
[48:49] David it's laid behind us when we swap
[48:53] our remote language for reality you ever
[48:58] seen some people prayed man they get up
[49:00] there they wanted some man I can pray
[49:02] like none other
[49:03] and I can say the words just perfect how
[49:05] articulate my words so good
[49:07] listen friends when you get in the
[49:08] garden you're not worried about who
[49:10] hears you you're not worried about what
[49:11] words you use or how people thinks how
[49:13] pretty you can pray when you come to the
[49:15] garden you come to The Garden alone it's
[49:21] real it's just you and God
[49:24] there ain't no show to be put on for
[49:26] nobody there ain't nobody watching
[49:30] whether you raise your hand or not
[49:31] there's nobody watching whether you
[49:33] worship or not there's nobody watching
[49:35] you see if you're entering the service
[49:36] or not when you come to your garden it's
[49:38] just you and God God's looking to you
[49:41] and I can feel your God that's where we
[49:46] come and say God my tank is empty Lord I
[49:49] feel like I have run plumb out my joy is
[49:52] gone my peace is gone
[49:53] god I need you and if you don't come
[49:55] through for me at this moment I don't
[49:57] know what I'm gonna do god I lead you
[49:58] right now I know you've done things in
[50:01] the past I know you've done things for
[50:03] me great taste Lord but I lead you worse
[50:05] right now than what I've ever needed you
[50:07] before it's in our spiritual gardens
[50:11] that we become like Jacob of the Old
[50:14] Testament it's where we begin to wrestle
[50:16] with God
[50:17] and we say God I need you so bad and
[50:20] your wrastlin what do our ask them with
[50:21] why is it so hard it's because you're
[50:24] fighting your very own humanity you're
[50:25] fighting your very own mindset you're
[50:27] fighting your own theology that lays up
[50:29] in your head and you wrestle with it
[50:31] just like I wrestle with it just like
[50:33] Jesus wrestles with it just like the
[50:35] Prophet wrestle with it you like Jacob
[50:37] begin to wrestle with those wheels even
[50:44] though it's so painful it's at those
[50:47] moments that divinity and humanity
[50:53] begins to fuse together Jesus didn't
[51:00] just give us a picture of divinity he
[51:03] give us a picture of his human part the
[51:09] flesh of a man the humanity of a man
[51:14] that would suffer the humanity of a man
[51:18] that would cry outside the city on top
[51:22] of a hill that would weep a man that
[51:25] would cry was Russo man that would watch
[51:29] her grave and cry as the tomb of Lazarus
[51:32] because his friend had died that's not
[51:35] divinity
[51:36] that's his humanity hallelujah because
[51:41] he knew us and he knew if all we saw was
[51:45] the divinity and the miracles and the
[51:47] great things in the signs and the
[51:49] wonders that's something I can't relate
[51:50] to I can't relate to just to Jesus with
[51:54] all powers I cannot relate to just to
[51:57] Jesus it walks upon the water
[51:58] I can't just relate to Jesus that would
[52:01] cleanse the liver and the left we're
[52:03] going running down the street doing the
[52:04] law to see I can't relate to that but
[52:09] when you talk about a man struggling
[52:12] with his own self when you talk about a
[52:15] man that has a will of his own to be
[52:17] able to make a choice whether you talk
[52:19] about a man that's in desperate need and
[52:21] needs something from God that's
[52:22] something I can relate to
[52:25] God let us see something we can identify
[52:28] with I know how we are
[52:34] we rejoice around the miracles dureena
[52:38] there ain't anything greater I love to
[52:39] preach on then to preach about the
[52:41] miracles for what Jesus done we love to
[52:44] read about Jesus healing the sick
[52:45] raising the dead I'll tell you friends

[53:00] to see how he cries I need to see how
[53:03] compassionate he is listen Church it's

[53:13] where people is awed by what he does but
[53:16] it's here it gets M&E i feel my preacher
[53:19] coming on man

[53:26] come in this service this morning and
[53:28] pull back the mask of our humanity pull
[53:31] back our I'm pretty smiles and our long
[53:33] hairs and get right behind those masks
[53:35] and lay all of that aside and get really
[53:37] getting real with Jesus for a few
[53:39] moments and let you know I'm a real
[53:41] person that's got real needs and we're
[53:43] old troubles we come to church and
[53:45] sometimes we come here and we put a
[53:47] display on but really who are you what
[53:51] are you going through when you sit on

[53:54] are you hear when you hear the word

[54:10] hallelujah you can't sit here and be a
[54:12] pretender listen days of pretending is
[54:14] over the days of make-believe in the
[54:18] church is over we are here to prove
[54:21] who's really got the goods who's really
[54:23] going to fight when it's time to fight I
[54:25] say to you this morning it's in your
[54:27] guests ebony that proves what you really
[54:29] are
[54:32] guess seemingly means the place
[54:38] oppressing it's the place of squeezing
[54:43] that that's what Gethsemane means it
[54:44] means the place of constriction the
[54:50] literal meaning Gethsemane meaning and
[54:52] oprah's that's what the name Gethsemane
[54:56] means it's an old fresh it's an old
[55:01] fresh not a miracle press a man an oil
[55:07] press
[55:08] I guess simile history says there was a
[55:13] large number of great bats and all of
[55:18] trees that's surrounded Gethsemane the
[55:22] Gethsemane is the private place that
[55:25] Jesus would go to to have personal times
[55:29] between him and the Father I'm told and
[55:33] guests in his history says they will
[55:35] have great round match and they would
[55:37] take the olives and even grapes and they
[55:39] would pour it into that branch and then
[55:42] what would happen is they would even
[55:44] take great bachelors and be able to take
[55:46] and squeeze those olives or they would
[55:48] actually get into the bat itself and
[55:50] begin to put them underneath their feet
[55:52] and crush them all as and crush them
[55:54] until finally all the oil runs out of
[55:57] that great listen very closely
[56:01] putting pressure on the olive forces the
[56:05] oil out of it
[56:08] amen brother David putting stress on me
[56:12] all of hallelujah putting stress on the
[56:15] Olive forces the all-out constricting
[56:19] the olive constricting all of a such
[56:21] pressure but such pressure forces
[56:24] although all that lays in the skin of
[56:27] the olive who glory although all that
[56:30] lays under that skin lays in that olive
[56:33] and they gotta press it to get it out of
[56:35] it we're at brother David the garden
[56:39] I guess cemani the Garden of Gethsemane
[56:43] I asked my wife I said if I ask you how
[56:50] much does olive oil cost what would you
[56:55] say I wonder what would you say this
[56:58] morning some would say three some would
[56:59] say four dollars right maybe three
[57:03] dollars for a bottle of olive oils four
[57:05] dollars for a bottle of olive oil I
[57:06] don't know I don't shop much she all
[57:08] right sending me there anyway I always
[57:09] buy too much cuz if I figure if we need
[57:13] one gallon milk today I'll just go get
[57:14] go ahead and get two so I don't have to
[57:16] go back but I say how much does olive
[57:19] oil cost and I said this why would I ask
[57:25] you how much olive oil cost because if I
[57:28] really want to know how much olive oil
[57:30] cost shouldn't you ask the olive
[57:36] shouldn't you ask the olive because the
[57:39] olive is the only warm Florida god that
[57:43] knows really how much it costs to get
[57:47] the olive in that jar I don't know the
[57:49] island knows what it feels like to be
[57:52] caressed and squeezed to get the olive
[57:55] oil out of it and Jesus comes to the
[58:01] garden alone he comes to a place of
[58:04] constriction he comes to the place of
[58:06] the press he comes to the place of
[58:08] pressure he comes to the squeeze it's
[58:10] the hour of the squeeze Wow
[58:15] because God's got to bring something out
[58:17] of him that's some wool it's gonna have
[58:23] to get poured out in this Gethsemane no
[58:27] crowds to see it no miracles no healing
[58:30] campaigns no discerning the hearts no
[58:33] telling somebody what's wrong with him
[58:34] hallelujah listen very carefully
[58:38] no Spirit of God on him no spirit of God
[58:44] on him he come to The Garden alone
[58:47] rising the Sun 1965 spirit left him am I
[58:52] going to get simony in the Garden of
[58:54] Gethsemane he didn't leave him at the
[58:57] cross it left him at the garden he had
[59:01] to die Amanda give adoption but I'm
[59:04] sitting in the garden of evening they're
[59:05] going to get simony the anointing left
[59:07] him you know he had to die as a sinner
[59:11] he died a sinner you know that not his
[59:14] sins but mines and yours Jesus had to
[59:21] come to the place to get squeezed in
[59:23] order to bring glory Jesus had to be
[59:28] pressed because God knows the greater
[59:32] the pressure the greater the treasure
[59:34] God knows how much pressure to put up on
[59:37] us listen friends that's the reason why
[59:39] you should warn every enemy of your life
[59:42] you should tell them thank you for
[59:45] putting pressure on me come on church
[59:48] you should send them a thank-you card

[59:53] you it's just bringing all out of your
[59:55] life you said said thank him go ahead

[1:02:54] what squeeze what gasps seven a horse it
[1:03:00] happen at in the garden did you know the
[1:03:06] Bible is a story of two Gardens that's
[1:03:11] all this it's a story of two gardeners
[1:03:14] the Garden of Eden and the Garden of
[1:03:17] Gethsemane in the first Arden Adam took
[1:03:20] a fall in the second Garden Jesus took a
[1:03:24] stand in the first Gardens Adam listen
[1:03:27] Adam hid from God and God had a son Adam
[1:03:33] but because of the second Garden Jesus
[1:03:36] Christ emerged from the tune and he come
[1:03:39] looking for me in the first garden there
[1:03:44] was a man because of a tree cause man to
[1:03:48] die in the second garden because of man
[1:03:51] made a decision he went to a tree and
[1:03:55] won back the rights of every son and
[1:03:57] daughter of God
[1:03:58] oh dear friends I tell you because I
[1:04:00] guess seemingly Jesus went to a tree to
[1:04:03] give every son and daughter of God
[1:04:05] everlasting
[1:04:06] up inside of your hearts it's because of
[1:04:08] a tree it's in the garden it's in the
[1:04:16] garden that the will a man superseded
[1:04:20] the will of God think about it but it's
[1:04:24] in the we it's in the garden that the
[1:04:27] will of man got superseded by the will
[1:04:29] of God this time it wasn't man over on
[1:04:33] God's will it was God over on man's will
[1:04:36] it's because of the garden because of
[1:04:39] the garden friends I know there's things
[1:04:41] about this we don't like hearing but the
[1:04:42] persecution is the only thing that can
[1:04:44] bring God's glory out of you it's not
[1:04:46] how many worship songs you memorize it's
[1:04:48] not how many quotes you know it's not
[1:04:50] how much for the Bible that you can
[1:04:51] quote for instance when you get pressure
[1:04:53] and squeeze by god it's the attack on
[1:04:58] your life that brings the all out
[1:05:02] it's the attack on my life that brings
[1:05:05] the glory out
[1:05:06] anybody can worship and everything is
[1:05:08] good okay we're not if you can't come in
[1:05:12] this church when we're singing to
[1:05:13] worship it and put your hands and
[1:05:15] there's something wrong with you listen
[1:05:17] friends it's easy to come in here when
[1:05:18] you got this many people praising God
[1:05:20] you can let your hair down for a little
[1:05:22] bit and lift your hand but what about
[1:05:23] when you come to the garden and there
[1:05:26] ain't nobody to pat you on the back
[1:05:27] there ain't nobody give you an attaboy
[1:05:29] that you can make it that you can
[1:05:30] overcome it and you come there and
[1:05:32] you're by yourself and you're being
[1:05:33] squeezed and you're being pressed and
[1:05:35] you feel like eating out a friend in the
[1:05:36] world that's who you really are
[1:05:44] real glory is expressed when there ain't
[1:05:48] nothing going right for you
[1:05:50] and it feels like Hills moved into your
[1:05:52] house can we get real for a minute just
[1:05:56] like your little message Church all that
[1:05:58] aside just for it and just get real with
[1:06:00] God when you know that there's hell in
[1:06:02] your home and there's trouble everywhere
[1:06:04] you look and the bills are piling up and
[1:06:06] the credit card debt is there and you
[1:06:07] don't know what you're going to do god
[1:06:09] he's pressing you and most of these
[1:06:13] things are not trials from the front
[1:06:16] it's usually stuff we do to ourselves
[1:06:23] Jesus comes to the garden he prays three
[1:06:26] times and now he knows he's never done
[1:06:31] nothing wrong
[1:06:33] he's never done nothing wrong he's never
[1:06:36] sinned
[1:06:37] he's never drunk alcohol as we'd say
[1:06:39] he's never went out and done things
[1:06:41] wrong he's a perfect lamb but being a
[1:06:47] perfect liam god had reversed the curse
[1:06:51] from the original gardens and now he
[1:06:54] comes to this garden to win back the
[1:06:57] original garden mother don't you realize
[1:07:01] it was in the garden of gethsemane that
[1:07:03] the garden of eden after the Millennium
[1:07:05] can be restored because of what happened
[1:07:07] in Gethsemane
[1:07:10] there's no millennium without a
[1:07:13] Gethsemane let me preach to you a minute
[1:07:17] there's no millennium but that I guess
[1:07:19] cemani a man it's at Gethsemane at the
[1:07:23] wheel how the father has got to take
[1:07:25] over brother I'm sitting conferences now
[1:07:29] hurry let's go to another it's called
[1:07:31] Gethsemane conference terrible
[1:07:35] conference watch programs words he
[1:07:39] didn't have to die a young man he didn't
[1:07:43] have to do it again he said kid he came
[1:07:46] to Gethsemane father the father had to
[1:07:49] check up to see if he really wanted to
[1:07:51] go through it or not again Jesus brought
[1:07:56] himself to a decision before going to
[1:07:59] Calvary the father brought his son and
[1:08:01] to a conference in Gethsemane
[1:08:03] and while the angels was taking nerf is
[1:08:04] their position to see what decision
[1:08:06] would be oh it might not have been this
[1:08:09] way but let's just think maybe it was I
[1:08:11] could hear him say son do you desire to
[1:08:14] go to Calvary there's a band waiting on
[1:08:18] you
[1:08:19] there's persecution there's death and
[1:08:23] murder laying in the way
[1:08:24] there's even exposure of your own body
[1:08:26] they'll strip the clothes off of you
[1:08:29] they'll beat you to a pulp
[1:08:30] now put a crown of thorns over your head
[1:08:32] you will die screaming for mercy what's
[1:08:38] the question should you go on should you
[1:08:42] go on should you go on Jesus is in the
[1:08:47] garden wrestling with what he should do
[1:08:52] he's only 33 years old he's only 33 we
[1:08:58] say he's got his whole life ahead of him
[1:09:00] as we would look at him as a man he's
[1:09:02] just young but the choice is his it's a
[1:09:07] decision I said it's a decision he comes
[1:09:11] to the garden he brings three people
[1:09:13] with him he knows there's something
[1:09:16] ahead of him he knows her something
[1:09:18] waiting for him he's got something for
[1:09:19] the rim said it's weighing on his mind
[1:09:21] so he comes to this garden in here here
[1:09:24] he's gonna fight there's gonna be a war
[1:09:27] between his humanity and his divinity
[1:09:33] Jesus is in the garden you got to see
[1:09:37] the picture this is the whole point of
[1:09:39] the sermon he comes to this garden the
[1:09:42] disciples are here and here Jesus as
[1:09:45] they come in Jesus asked us the
[1:09:48] disciples just pray with me please just
[1:09:50] pray with me just pray for an hour just
[1:09:53] pray with me watch Frank and the Bible
[1:09:57] says Jesus will father so here's the
[1:10:00] disciples on one side here Jesus goes a
[1:10:04] little further to the other side Jesus
[1:10:07] goes there and he kneels down and he
[1:10:10] begins to talk to the father about what
[1:10:13] his will is
[1:10:15] listen now the will of God was Calvary
[1:10:20] the will of God was nails the will of
[1:10:23] God was thorns on his head the will of
[1:10:26] God was to be beat the will of God was
[1:10:29] to go there to be public but in public
[1:10:30] this lands shame that is the will of God
[1:10:33] listen the will of God was not going to
[1:10:36] move God was not changing his will his
[1:10:43] will was Calvary so Jesus comes and he's
[1:10:47] praying to the Father what his will
[1:10:49] would be Lord what would you have me do
[1:10:52] and God tells him the wheel
[1:10:54] it's gaga's the will is for you to take
[1:10:59] and to be carried outside the city and
[1:11:02] crucified on the town's garbage dump
[1:11:05] that is the will of God Jesus bumps into
[1:11:12] the will of the Father and the will of
[1:11:14] the Father doesn't move so as a man as a
[1:11:17] man he gets up and he goes back to
[1:11:21] humanity come on somebody he comes to
[1:11:26] lean upon humanity and guess what
[1:11:29] humanity fails him get mad he has a
[1:11:33] slate body he needs them to pray he
[1:11:37] needs to him he wants to lean on him he
[1:11:39] wants to get something from them drop
[1:11:41] something but when he leans to that
[1:11:45] humanity humanity is not a leaning post
[1:11:48] they're laying down asleep and Jesus
[1:11:52] says can't you just pray with me just
[1:11:54] for an hour just for an hour watch and
[1:11:57] pray it's the hour of temptation
[1:12:07] leaves humanity goes back to divinity
[1:12:14] and he starts praying Lord what is it -
[1:12:19] will a god ain't moving don't
[1:12:23] misunderstand me the will of God it's
[1:12:26] not moved by tears it's not moved by his
[1:12:29] suffering I want you to hear that it's
[1:12:33] not moved because you feel bad it
[1:12:36] doesn't move because you might be
[1:12:37] depressed he was oppressed he was
[1:12:39] suffering in his body and the will of
[1:12:41] God was not moving can I say it it's not
[1:12:47] going if custom fits your heart the will
[1:12:49] of God doesn't custom fit what you're
[1:12:51] going through how you feel trying to
[1:12:52] make you feel better
[1:12:53] the one guy so he prays grace and he
[1:13:02] gets up because the will of God is not
[1:13:05] moving because he goes back to the
[1:13:08] disciples and humanity again
[1:13:14] don't you understand what I'm telling
[1:13:16] you when you try to depend on it and you
[1:13:19] try to lean on it and you think you got
[1:13:21] a little something and you try your best
[1:13:23] to lean upon it it'll fail you every
[1:13:25] time

[1:14:22] he knows my like that please no God no
[1:14:36] to the Father's will if you changed your
[1:14:42] wheel has your word changed he knows
[1:14:44] better
[1:14:45] I said he knows better has your wheel
[1:14:47] how many times do we do it as you will
[1:14:50] change it as there is another way is
[1:14:52] there a way around this Lord no do I got
[1:14:54] yes this there's no Calvary without a
[1:15:00] winning gethsemane believe it or not
[1:15:03] that would have never been a Calvary
[1:15:06] let's hit one the battleground and
[1:15:08] Gethsemane the only way around this is
[1:15:12] to have a kingdom without a Calvary
[1:15:16] that's the only way around it is to have
[1:15:19] a kingdom without Calvary but guess what
[1:15:21] a kingdom without Calvary doesn't
[1:15:23] involve you and me it involves one man
[1:15:25] without sin
[1:15:31] it tears me up to think there's only
[1:15:36] white bad he praised so hard the Bible
[1:15:43] says his water and his blood separated
[1:15:46] him a try Joseph takes over his body
[1:15:50] where literally it's a it's a medical
[1:15:53] condition where he's put under such
[1:15:56] pressure so much pressure Sal my dresser
[1:15:59] that blood literally pours from the
[1:16:04] pores in his face it drips from his body
[1:16:08] Cuba treacherous the definition
[1:16:14] literally means one put her so much
[1:16:17] agony and pressure that it separates the
[1:16:19] water from the blood and besides water
[1:16:23] pouring out in your sweat glands
[1:16:25] Brad begins to drop down he's not there
[1:16:28] some halfway prayer oh let me preach to
[1:16:30] you right there it stuns not it ain't
[1:16:32] some two-second prayer before you go to
[1:16:34] bed or some halfway prayer but he's
[1:16:36] there in agony and pain and so much
[1:16:39] pressure and so much pressure he's been
[1:16:41] over he's got his face on the ground and
[1:16:43] he's crying out to God God what is it
[1:16:45] Lord must I go this way is this what I
[1:16:48] have to do Sal that's right sir blood
[1:16:52] begins to run down his chin down his
[1:16:56] clothes one drop after another so much
[1:16:59] pressure so much pressure so much
[1:17:01] pressure why he didn't get simony what
[1:17:04] that's just silly it's the Olive Press
[1:17:05] and in that Olive Press
[1:17:07] the will of God and the man humanity is
[1:17:09] pressing human pressing here until blood
[1:17:12] begins to run from his pores Jesus do
[1:17:21] you got a choice yes cuz here chose not
[1:17:25] to yes
[1:17:26] clear chose another way yes can you
[1:17:31] choose other ways sometimes without
[1:17:32] seeking the will of God how much your
[1:17:35] humanity how many times have we tried to
[1:17:37] bypass what we know
[1:17:40] we know it's God's will we know there
[1:17:43] ain't no way around it but we come and
[1:17:44] we play with God sometimes and we toy
[1:17:46] with them when God's will ain't moving
[1:17:55] somewhere deep within Jesus his father
[1:18:03] what's the Lamb
[1:18:04] what's the lamb not the priest not the
[1:18:09] high priest not the king
[1:18:12] what's the lamb sir watch the lamb the
[1:18:19] lamb humbles himself he's his father not
[1:18:22] my will
[1:18:30] the vanity has to give in to what
[1:18:36] humanities asked and humanity is asking
[1:18:40] for the father's wheel you fell on his
[1:18:46] face and prayed saying father what's the
[1:18:48] man if it's possible you know why that
[1:18:51] sounds just like me of you nor please
[1:18:54] maybe there's another way maybe I can do
[1:18:56] this different like there's another way
[1:18:58] to handle this
[1:18:59] or as we do sometimes Lord I'll just put
[1:19:02] this on the back burner and just forget
[1:19:03] it for a little while and the will of
[1:19:06] God I ain't checking shoot he approaches
[1:19:10] the Father he's asking him he's asking
[1:19:13] me and what's God say God don't say
[1:19:18] nothing what do you do when God don't
[1:19:20] say nothing what do you do when God is
[1:19:23] silent what do you do you lay yourself
[1:19:28] at the father's feet Lord this cup is
[1:19:31] bitter let's get us a heart let's skip
[1:19:37] stuff maybe there's another wheel
[1:19:40] finally he realized God ain't gonna
[1:19:42] change his mind about his word and he
[1:19:47] says Lord what do you do when God don't
[1:19:51] say nothing to you I'll tell you what we
[1:19:54] do we bounce off of the will of God and
[1:19:57] we start leaning on humanity hoping
[1:20:00] humanity can bail us out how many times
[1:20:04] have we pinned depend on our humanity to
[1:20:06] bail us out of situations and every time
[1:20:10] you try to lean on it he fails you Amen
[1:20:13] somebody every time you sit in your
[1:20:15] recliner pick your Bible up in your hand
[1:20:17] you know what happens your humanity
[1:20:18] fails you don't like it I know because
[1:20:24] it's right where I live that what
[1:20:27] happens when we lay down or not we put
[1:20:29] on a tape and you fall asleep your
[1:20:30] humanity wins the war
[1:20:37] Jesus is battlin he needs help but
[1:20:41] there's no help and he's pushed back and
[1:20:44] forth and back and forth squeezing him
[1:20:47] squeezing him he goes from one to
[1:20:49] another to another and till he's so
[1:20:51] pressed between them heaven seems like
[1:20:54] brass and it seems like God ain't here
[1:20:56] in one prayer from his lips but the only
[1:20:59] thing he don't understand is is God
[1:21:01] ain't saying that them because his word
[1:21:02] ain't changed and Jesus gets so pressed
[1:21:08] between humanity and divinity it presses
[1:21:12] him so hard this is the message this
[1:21:15] mornin it presses him so hard that out
[1:21:19] of the life of Jesus one drip after
[1:21:22] another was all comes dripping out of
[1:21:27] his mouth because he's so pressed in
[1:21:30] between he's God's got his man God's got
[1:21:33] humanity underneath his feet and he
[1:21:37] presses him until all begins to run out
[1:21:42] of Jesus and that stream of all runs
[1:21:47] from Gethsemane it runs down to pilots
[1:21:50] halt and out of pilots halt it runs down
[1:21:54] those streets down that Via della Rossa
[1:21:56] it runs outside the city to the town
[1:21:58] garbage dump and it ends right there at
[1:22:00] Calvary it's a stream
[1:22:08] whom he believes that God knows what you
[1:22:13] can take God knows what he's got to put
[1:22:15] you through to get all to run out of
[1:22:17] your life hallelujah I'm glad God didn't
[1:22:21] give us our way sometimes I'm glad God
[1:22:24] don't answer all my prayers because some
[1:22:28] of my prayers are farsighted or
[1:22:29] nearsighted I'm not looking at it right
[1:22:33] if humanity if we can lean on humanity
[1:22:37] every time we don't even need God if we
[1:22:40] can depend on our flesh and our humanity
[1:22:42] and how good it is and how perfect we
[1:22:45] don't even need a Calvary but because
[1:22:48] every time I need him the most he falls
[1:22:51] short every time so God just keeps
[1:22:56] pressing me and pressing me and dressing
[1:22:58] me until he starts allowing that all to
[1:23:01] flow listen friends when he was in the
[1:23:09] garden he was there brother brems said
[1:23:13] the tempter come up before him saying
[1:23:17] this is what you're gonna get forgiven
[1:23:20] your life to the Father do you mean this
[1:23:22] is what you're gonna get out of it how
[1:23:24] many times does the devil told you that
[1:23:26] do you mean this is what your life is
[1:23:27] done you mean you lose a loved one in a
[1:23:29] car wreck you live here you lose your
[1:23:31] loved one to a heart attack or something
[1:23:32] this is what you're gonna get out of it
[1:23:33] you lose a loved one to disease and this
[1:23:36] is what you get for serving God she says
[1:23:41] is this really what you deserve all you
[1:23:44] have to do is ask and all this leaves
[1:23:48] right now and the tempter comes up right
[1:23:50] before you just give in you can't do
[1:23:53] this
[1:23:54] you can't make this you can't make a
[1:23:56] rapture you can't be an overcomer you
[1:23:58] can't go on Amen somebody body changed
[1:24:01] you can't make a body change if you'll
[1:24:04] just give in this all go away this will
[1:24:09] all go away
[1:24:10] if you'll just give in is this really
[1:24:22] fair is this really fair that one man
[1:24:25] would die for everybody else how fair is
[1:24:29] that how fair is that that you should
[1:24:32] have to do this for all humanity just
[1:24:37] say it just say it and we'll take you
[1:24:40] out of the press or take you out of it
[1:24:43] and Jesus says the will of humanity was
[1:24:52] to get out of it the well humanity was
[1:24:55] to find another way but not my will that
[1:25:02] communion 1957 I'll hurry that's exactly
[1:25:07] the way he does you and I just before
[1:25:09] the great bow life starts before the
[1:25:10] great battle of right and wrong which
[1:25:12] begins to settle battle within us God
[1:25:14] brings us to a guest's M&E God didn't
[1:25:21] spare his own son he'll not spare us you
[1:25:24] and I from the testing of Jesus was
[1:25:25] confronting the greatest test that he
[1:25:27] ever had
[1:25:27] yes sin he lay just before him without
[1:25:29] once and final sufficient test must come
[1:25:32] when the birds of the entire world laid
[1:25:35] us on the shoulders brother branham come
[1:25:38] to a place in his ministry to where he
[1:25:43] had to leave the Baptist Church and God
[1:25:47] was going to take that ministry and put
[1:25:49] the remember that the shuk actually had
[1:25:52] life in it at that term and brother Rams
[1:25:54] ministry had to go through the shuk in
[1:25:56] order to produce the seed so he goes to

[1:32:19] move so he went back and leaned upon
[1:32:22] humanity and humanity let him down a
[1:32:25] road that could only bypass that wheel
[1:32:28] for so long until the submissive wheel
[1:32:31] would have to be brought back to the
[1:32:33] gods perfect wheel there's no mountain
[1:32:39] happy valley there's no way around it
[1:32:50] I'm down on my knees with the doors
[1:32:54] closed father
[1:32:56] third ladies my wife my baby's mother
[1:32:58] laying under the Undertaker's more Billy

[1:33:07] raise her won't you please o God to
[1:33:09] spare my baby's life do you see the
[1:33:12] prayer and I looked up and you know I've
[1:33:15] always been subject to visions so when
[1:33:17] he sees this vision he says it seemed
[1:33:20] like a black sheet just rode down and
[1:33:23] unbowed it coming down and Barbara makes
[1:33:26] this statement God throwed my prayer God
[1:33:31] took my prayer and throwed it it right
[1:33:34] back in my face I know people today
[1:33:44] because they feel like their prayers got
[1:33:46] thrown back in their face they leave
[1:33:48] this message and never serve God again I
[1:33:50] know a man because they went through a
[1:33:53] divorce his wife divorce and that's
[1:33:54] Biddeford now 30-something years this
[1:33:56] man's never walked back in a church door
[1:33:58] because he bites God his divorce back in
[1:34:07] your face some people said that's it
[1:34:10] heist irony so get back in my face what
[1:34:18] have I done God have my trained
[1:34:19] aggressor laws I should have this
[1:34:21] punishment Jesus revealing our again
[1:34:23] I'll do anything but don't take my baby
[1:34:25] I see she was going anyhow and I raised
[1:34:27] up and the tempter came
[1:34:33] and the tempter came there was the one
[1:34:38] time in all my life that I can call was
[1:34:41] the crucial moment watch what he says my
[1:34:44] guests M&E when I was just barely
[1:34:47] holding on to the bed the devil said
[1:34:49] there you are is that the reward for
[1:34:52] trying to serve Him in this something
[1:34:55] how the devil can have such a good
[1:34:57] argument when you feel so low and so
[1:35:00] down and you're so sensitive that moment
[1:35:02] your feelings are running so so
[1:35:04] sensitive to anything anybody says is
[1:35:09] that really what you're gonna catch do
[1:35:11] you mean to tell me to take that 22 year
[1:35:13] old mother and lay her you nerdz a
[1:35:14] corpse in the morgue and take that
[1:35:15] precious baby of your own flesh and
[1:35:16] blood
[1:35:17] and slammed your prayer right in your
[1:35:18] face and you mean to tell me you're
[1:35:21] gonna serve Him after that the room said
[1:35:25] I was standing between two opinions what
[1:35:31] he says I was standing between two
[1:35:33] opinions it had to be decided I put my
[1:35:37] hand over on her little head and I said
[1:35:40] the Lord gave and the Lord takes away
[1:35:45] blessed be the name of art do you know
[1:35:51] what it takes to say that do you know
[1:35:54] what it takes when you got this baby
[1:35:57] that you've watched around the house
[1:35:59] crawl around the house as it was and
[1:36:01] it's around the house and you play with
[1:36:02] it the mornings and you can try to hold
[1:36:03] it the evenings and now the baby is
[1:36:05] under such cruciate pain it's died with
[1:36:07] its eyes crossed in your arms Lord gives
[1:36:11] and the Lord takes away blessed be the
[1:36:15] name of the Lord I said show you honey
[1:36:18] daddy cannot go with you where you are
[1:36:19] now but they'll come someday I'll let
[1:36:23] you on the arm shoes mother and I'll
[1:36:24] bear you daddy I'll see you again
[1:36:26] someday the Olive Press between two
[1:36:34] opinions
[1:36:35] squeezed and squeezed until finally he
[1:36:41] gives them to the little gulped because
[1:36:44] there was no way around great things is
[1:36:49] birth through much suffering much pain
[1:36:51] much agony like Calvary the all I like
[1:36:59] Gethsemane to all ran out and calls the
[1:37:01] Calvary and because of this moment out
[1:37:05] of this pressing of this olive out of
[1:37:07] crushing of this olive came the message
[1:37:10] of the hour see friends it has to be
[1:37:16] this way because God said he was going
[1:37:18] to have a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:37:20] God said he was going to have a paypal
[1:37:22] and there's no other way but to press
[1:37:24] him and tell the all run and the message
[1:37:27] was going to come for us
[1:37:32] the world's greatest battleground it
[1:37:37] ain't our shoutings it ain't our glory
[1:37:39] to God
[1:37:40] it's when we submit to the Father's will
[1:37:43] and say God not my will but I've done
