[29:58] notice what she links to the ascending
[30:00] the things that's going to try to come
[30:02] between them and try to erode their
[30:05] relationship now he's already ascended
[30:08] up but he's coming to get her so she can

[33:41] about that size most of you probably
[33:43] never even seen one or a lit
[33:45] bat-eared Fox a couple of species around
[33:47] the world that are very very tiny and
[33:49] small but even at that they will mature
[33:52] not only in size but in cunning and in
[33:56] understanding and you're the bride is
[33:59] able to recognize some of the things
[34:01] that will come against her and her
[34:03] beloved she does not call them by name
[34:06] she doesn't identify what they are and I
[34:09] wrote some of these down a rim to you
[34:11] last week and I like to read them again
[34:13] and I put them up on the screen here the
[34:15] brothers royal so you can be able to
[34:17] read them with me they are sins like
[34:19] pride and jealousy self seeking
[34:24] criticism or being critical wanting my
[34:28] rights gossip judging others harshness
[34:34] impatience ingratitude self-pity
[34:39] hypocrisy mistrust superiority
[34:44] inferiority worry and a thousand more
[34:49] but hopefully I'll not make this series
[34:52] two will will cover all a thousand but
[34:56] if the Lord hates us too we will now how
[34:59] do these little foxes actually spoil the
[35:03] vine well in all they not only get to
[35:06] the vine itself to eat from the tender
[35:08] part that's shooting out they eat around
[35:10] the base of the vine which comes up out
[35:13] of the ground they also dig down with
[35:15] her tiny little paws and they will dig
[35:18] down beneath the surface of the earth
[35:21] and they will dig down into the heart
[35:24] where the roots are and they won't tear
[35:27] that out but they will also their
[35:30] favorite parts is the little grapes as
[35:32] they come out now looking at this and
[35:35] type in all says the Holy Ghost as he
[35:37] begins to produce the fruit of our union
[35:40] with the Lord Jesus and the fruits of
[35:43] the Spirit of God in our lives then
[35:45] these little foxes will try their very
[35:47] best to be able to destroy the
[35:50] fruitfulness and our life as a child of
[35:53] God and there's
[35:54] many foxes and no doubt there's no way a
[35:57] preacher could cover them all because
[35:59] they vary according to our own makeup
[36:03] and according to our weaknesses but I'd
[36:06] like to deal with the ones that the Lord
[36:08] lays upon my heart wouldn't that be the
[36:11] ones you'd want me to deal with I could
[36:12] study no doubt and look in different
[36:14] ones and the way different preachers
[36:16] have preached it but I like to pray
[36:18] myself and go in the direction that I
[36:20] feel the anointing and the pulsation of
[36:23] the Holy Ghost because to me that's what
[36:26] Sneed 'fl for our congregation
[36:28] well that's those that are actually
[36:29] visibly here are those who would visit
[36:32] us by streaming and I pray that you'll
[36:34] pray with me and we'll just go along as
[36:37] the Spirit of God will anoint our hearts
[36:39] now I hope tonight that what you brought
[36:42] was an open heart and you didn't bring
[36:44] your shovel and your pitchfork and your
[36:47] corn scoop or you can shovel it over to
[36:49] this brother and over to that sister but
[36:52] your heart will be open that you'll be
[36:54] able to receive from the Lord tonight
[36:56] let us sow tonight and a little bitty
[36:59] old tiny Fox it's a little bitty guy
[37:01] he's so cute now you know man has broken
[37:05] many many years ago to the ability of
[37:09] high breeding now there's not that many
[37:12] original species of Fox but what man did
[37:15] man got into the breeding of Fox confers
[37:19] or a very great value now because of the
[37:22] left and the animal huggers and the tree
[37:24] huggers and a lot of that you know
[37:26] they've so stood against the fur trade
[37:28] that the fur trade is and what he was
[37:30] years ago but when it was quietly and
[37:32] you know an explorative type of saying
[37:34] and exploitive on the animals himself
[37:36] man got into breeding a lot of really
[37:40] colorful beautiful foxes now the marbled
[37:43] Fox is one of the most sought-after very
[37:45] very beautiful and if you've ever seen
[37:47] one or not but they're by and they're
[37:49] white have a little touch of gray some
[37:51] of the Raritan the genetics of the gene
[37:53] will come out with a little bit of pink
[37:55] that'll run through the hair and
[37:57] absolutely breathtaking Wade you know
[37:58] pretty much what they'd use it for they
[38:00] would use it for fur but yeah there's
[38:02] also they cross Fox and he's quite a
[38:05] beautiful sample himself
[38:07] then the silver platinum fox and those
[38:10] on and on and on and on what man has
[38:14] been able to do by genetics but yet for
[38:17] the most part those are not the ones
[38:19] that we'd like to look at because those
[38:21] are raised in a pen they are raised and
[38:24] what are their trained were they are fed
[38:26] never had a wild day in their life so
[38:29] they really wouldn't know what to do in
[38:31] a vineyard because they are hand fared
[38:33] hand raised and then somebody kills them
[38:35] and they use them of course for their
[38:37] fur but the most of the ones that's
[38:40] really going to get - you and I are
[38:42] going to be the ones that are going to
[38:44] be wild in nature because that's the way
[38:48] we are born wild in nature and actually
[38:54] your nature is closer to a fox and
[38:55] probably what you'd want acknowledged
[38:57] because we are animal not your soul now
[39:01] but your body is animal one just before
[39:04] you got saved it still is so you take
[39:08] the Holy Ghost off of a human being and
[39:10] that human being will do things an
[39:12] animal never thought of doing an animal
[39:16] will kill but an animal does not commit
[39:19] premeditated murder an animal will kill
[39:22] for sustenance or it will kill because
[39:25] another animal is threatening its own
[39:27] kind and the animal does not have the
[39:29] ability to sing and do as a human being
[39:33] that's why human is lower than an animal
[39:35] without the Spirit of God on them and
[39:37] the church said that's right now once
[39:40] this so these little foxes that you and
[39:42] I would deal with they're all sizes or
[39:45] all shapes they're all colors but the
[39:47] one thing we want to focus on is that
[39:49] they all start out very small now let us
[39:53] look tonight at this first little guy
[39:55] always a cute little fella my seems very
[39:58] very harmless he doesn't seem like it
[40:00] cause any about any problems until you
[40:03] look at the end results of this little
[40:05] guy he's called the fox of slothfulness
[40:11] Wow the Fox of slothfulness now let's
[40:17] look at him shall we
[40:18] proverbs chapter 12 verse 27 the
[40:22] slothful man roasts us not that which he
[40:26] took in hunting but the substance of a
[40:31] diligent man is precious now this guy
[40:36] that Solomon writes about and he speaks
[40:38] a lot about this particular class of
[40:40] people and a lot of what the Bible would
[40:43] actually speak about when it would come
[40:44] to the sluggard or the slothful is more
[40:47] of the natural man than it would be the
[40:50] spiritual man but many times you found
[40:53] they run hand in half so your Solomon
[40:55] here in other places in song Psalm house
[40:57] Ecclesiastes he will refer to a man
[41:00] that's basically sluggard that he
[41:02] doesn't work or he doesn't do much
[41:03] naturally but we don't want to look at
[41:05] it just so much in the natural sense but
[41:07] we want to focus in parallel of this
[41:09] that it also runs in the spiritual sense
[41:12] as well being spiritually lazy
[41:15] spiritually sluggard or a spiritual
[41:18] sloth I'm he's ever seen the animal
[41:20] sloth well let me give you an example of
[41:24] how they move
[41:30] he's 150 years old before he's ever a
[41:33] father and he finally reaches up and
[41:45] gets a branch with a leaf on it he
[41:49] starved to death time he gets it to his
[41:51] mouth that's the sauce now this is where
[42:03] the word of course comes from sloths for
[42:06] a man always say we have Church now
[42:10] what'd he say we all got cleaned up took
[42:12] shower hope you did anyway got all
[42:14] dressed up and everything since we're
[42:16] already here
[42:17] I figure we ought to go and have Church
[42:22] now I want you to notice is the way that
[42:24] Solomon sets this slothful man the
[42:27] slothful man roasts just not that which
[42:30] he took in hunting now you the slothful
[42:33] man he goes out now he's either hunting
[42:35] a rabbit or a bird or a deer or whatever
[42:38] more that they would have hunted in that
[42:40] day and he goes out and he hunts he gets
[42:42] up early and he gets up and prepares
[42:44] himself takes him of course a long time
[42:46] to get Sarkozy's the sloth but he
[42:48] finally gets sad and you know whatever
[42:50] so whatever was chance of what if it was
[42:52] he got this animal and he finally made
[42:55] it back to the house but by the time he
[42:57] gets back to the house he is so wore out
[43:00] and he is so exhausted from all the
[43:02] energy that he put forth into this
[43:05] hunting trip that when he gets back to
[43:07] the house he decides he's not going to
[43:09] eat it after all because he is so wore
[43:12] out he has absolutely tuckered out so
[43:16] the slothful man roast is not that which
[43:19] he took in honey now look at the
[43:22] perspective here the Solomon brings into
[43:24] view and watch how he parallels the
[43:27] diligent man with the slothful man the
[43:30] slothful man roasted not that which he
[43:32] took us in hunting but the substance of
[43:35] a diligent man is
[43:39] yes now he will contrast the diligent
[43:41] man with the slothful man and several
[43:44] other different instances but here he
[43:46] compares a man who actually went out put
[43:49] forth the effort to become a Christian
[43:51] or I mean a hunter and the action hunted
[43:53] and he salts something and he got
[43:55] something that was apparently edible
[43:57] something of some value and once he got
[44:00] it he never actually went through the
[44:03] final process to eat that and become one
[44:06] was what he hunted out so he goes
[44:11] through the process of being a Christian
[44:13] they got saved so on and so on and so on
[44:14] but he never really goes on to take the
[44:18] flesh of that which he had hunted and
[44:20] eat that unbecoming one with that what
[44:23] she's taken into his heart
[44:25] now he contrasts that then with the
[44:27] diligent and he says but the substance
[44:30] of a diligent man is precious not an
[44:33] amazing how that he looks at what the
[44:35] slothful man is taken which is now his
[44:38] he will now be responsible for it
[44:40] because it says he has taken a life and
[44:43] if he did not use that life for our
[44:46] purpose that was to provided for he'll
[44:48] be responsible to God no matter how
[44:52] brother Brandon bloss said people kill
[44:54] an animal's just to kill him and laying
[44:55] there God will judge them for murder
[44:57] people that drive up and down the road
[45:00] and shoot animals and try to do all that
[45:02] thing it's a sin I said it's a sin now
[45:05] if you've got a need for to use for
[45:07] that's one thing killer to kill your
[45:09] murderer in your heart so this man took
[45:12] this substance it was now his he was now
[45:15] responsible for taking its life what's
[45:18] he going to do now with the substance he
[45:21] decides it's so much trouble to prepare
[45:23] it he'll have to skin it out he'll have
[45:25] to clean it he'll have to do all this
[45:27] son my goodness is going to be naptime
[45:30] the times he gets it all sodden and
[45:32] roasted and everything he's wore plumber
[45:34] so he just decides he's not going to do
[45:37] it so then Solomon contrasts this type
[45:39] of the God with the diligent man and he
[45:42] uses what the diligent man owns notice I
[45:45] said this I love this he said
[45:47] substance or the possessions of a
[45:50] diligent man is precious now listen this
[45:53] you can tell a lot about a human being
[45:55] but how they value what God has given
[45:59] them now you may never live in a house
[46:01] in the ridges you may never own a great
[46:04] big build business that makes all kinds
[46:06] of money but you know what your aspect
[46:08] on it should be that if God allows you
[46:11] to live in a single-wide trailer and God
[46:13] never gives you more than a 1953
[46:16] Volkswagen Beetle and you've got a
[46:18] pretty good job at paints of minimum
[46:20] wage you ought to be so grateful for God
[46:22] for every pair of shoes you've got you
[46:25] ought to be grateful for every pass
[46:27] socks you've got even if they do have
[46:29] holes in them you ought to be grateful
[46:30] forever shirt I've repaired breeches
[46:33] every dress ever pumpkin ever watermelon
[46:36] ever slicer bacon because to the
[46:38] diligent man his substance has value to
[46:43] the slothful man it makes no difference
[46:45] what he owns what he has it's like he
[46:49] does not matter it has means nothing
[46:52] them you understand you can answer to
[46:53] God for what you have in life you're
[46:55] gonna answer to God not only for what
[46:57] you have but how you've treated what God
[47:00] gave you and people spend a lot oh I
[47:03] wish I could be like so-and-so why would
[47:05] God and trust you with a million dollar
[47:07] house when you don't even take care of a
[47:09] 12o 60 single-wide trailer well amen
[47:15] brother Donny now whenever slothfulness
[47:20] will begin to grab ahold of an
[47:23] individual's heart nine times out of ten
[47:24] or never remain the natural realm but
[47:26] it'll move over into the spiritual realm
[47:28] as well well notice this enrolments of
[47:30] Proverbs rather 1519 the way of the
[47:33] slothful man is as a hedge of thorns but
[47:39] the way of the righteous is my point now
[47:42] watch in contrast now you know what's
[47:45] amazing is that you might be both of
[47:47] these people and these verses in the
[47:49] same body your own flesh may there's
[47:53] nothing but a sloth
[47:56] but if you got the baptism of the Holy
[47:59] Ghost his speech you up now that's gonna
[48:02] be a miracle from a sloth by the time
[48:07] you get your hand up to praise God we've
[48:09] changed songs three times we're not even
[48:12] in one of them kind of songs but God
[48:14] gets a whole to you from the inside and
[48:17] gears up that's awesome before you know
[48:19] it you're raising your hands at the
[48:21] right time you got them down at the
[48:23] right time you're clapping them at the
[48:25] right time and you want to see an
[48:27] overcomer you are overcoming the sped-up
[48:30] want is overcoming the slow down one
[48:33] that's a greater miracle than if God
[48:36] would have turns you into a rabbit cuz
[48:39] if you stand up like a rabbit us and a
[48:41] rabbits nature to round here and go
[48:43] there but God leaves you and that old
[48:45] small body to the change takes place oh
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:52] ma the way of the slothful man is as a
[48:59] hedge of thorns because he is slothful
[49:04] he imagines thousands of things of why
[49:09] he shouldn't do whatever it is he's
[49:11] supposed to do now it's not necessarily
[49:17] real but it's real to him or her and it
[49:22] becomes as a hedge what a peculiar way
[49:27] to like in a human being
[49:29] now notice Solomon says the way of the
[49:32] salt for man is as on a head now you
[49:35] know as a man would look at a heads most
[49:38] of you are probably seen his rows and
[49:40] how they will start out and then they
[49:43] start out they of course we're all gonna
[49:44] start out very very small as a matter of
[49:47] fact they could be plucked up by the
[49:49] roots by hand without a whole lot of
[49:51] strenuous effort but if they are left
[49:54] alone and left to themselves they will
[49:58] make a heads roll that you'll cut
[50:01] yourself all to pieces trying to get rid
[50:04] of them
[50:04] you see that's the way sins
[50:07] and temptations are whatever the Royal
[50:10] foxes are come in at ass awful man or
[50:13] woman that's not playing reading the
[50:15] Bible don't what they ought to do and a
[50:17] little hairs will sprout up its head and
[50:19] then another and then another or they
[50:22] look small they look very insignificant
[50:23] it doesn't look like it's gonna bother
[50:26] anybody
[50:26] it's just sneaking over and looking on
[50:28] your smartphone that's something you
[50:30] should look at well praise the Lord
[50:32] brother darling and the next thing you
[50:34] know you're addicted why because a
[50:38] hedgerow growed up in your life and it
[50:41] started out with something that big
[50:44] sticking its head out of the ground but
[50:47] the slothful man says it's awful hard
[50:49] out there my Guinness it's 85 in the
[50:52] shade I think I'll wait till fall I
[50:54] believe my wait till things cooled down
[50:57] a little bit and then I'll get out there
[50:59] with a mattock I might even hire
[51:01] somebody to come over with a backhoe and
[51:03] dig that thing up I'll tell you one
[51:05] thing course and fall gets there he
[51:07] decides he's gonna rest all through the
[51:09] fall because it's just so hard still
[51:12] it's just a really bad fall and it's JA
[51:16] who knows he might get out there and
[51:18] catch on fire something or something bad
[51:21] may happen a slothful person can imagine
[51:25] some of the most bizarre circumstances
[51:31] there's one good thing that they are
[51:34] good at
[51:35] that's imagination well praise the Lord
[51:42] you understand why this imagination
[51:43] comes from their slothfulness their
[51:46] slothfulness produces this type of
[51:49] bizarre imagination I do have an
[51:55] advantage on you I have other scriptures
[51:56] in front of and you're waiting to say
[51:58] where I'm going now what's this in the
[52:01] mind of the slothful man he looks and
[52:03] says this is so hard I just there's no
[52:07] way I can do this and it's you know what
[52:09] you saw my there's one and there's
[52:11] another there's another oh my
[52:13] Thanksgiving
[52:14] thanks you I had to think of it I don't
[52:16] believe in do anything now Thanksgiving
[52:18] it's holidays I always take all the
[52:19] holidays
[52:20] from spent it with my uncle my sushi
[52:22] Bell and everybody so hi Mon do nothing
[52:24] and then before you know I you know what
[52:26] the winter snows of December's born that
[52:28] is Krishna said well I never do anything
[52:29] on Christmas Day you know what in that
[52:32] was January oh it's too cold to do it
[52:35] now
[52:35] it's January in East Tennessee in the
[52:38] mountains and fabula soon as March rolls
[52:40] around I'll tell you one thing I want to
[52:43] go up to that Alton I'm gonna grab a
[52:44] hold of them horns and I want to tell
[52:47] mother Donnie brother Donnie lay hands
[52:49] on me and toss this devil out of me it's
[52:52] March March comes they spend the whole
[52:59] month every weekend at Dollywood how
[53:04] many all ever had Devils cast out at
[53:06] Dollywood I want to ask you to raise
[53:09] your hands to this how many has ever
[53:10] picked up a few Adal he would preach
[53:18] Jesus you see every difficulty is in the
[53:25] pass of the slothful individual Solomon
[53:29] said is the way of the slothful man Oh
[53:32] such a heavy thorn so every difficulty
[53:34] in the path of this type of a person it
[53:38] just secures and absolutely encourages
[53:41] them for inactivity so because the
[53:45] difficulty is there just don't do it cuz
[53:50] after all you'll not fail Oh that'd be
[54:01] so embarrassing I'd rather fall flat on
[54:04] my face ten thousand three hundred and
[54:06] eighty five times than to sit in a Pew
[54:08] and never make a move
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:14] I may stand before God with a lot of
[54:18] mistakes but I'll never stand before me
[54:20] and it'll say you were slothful nope
[54:22] ain't saying that to me
[54:23] notice how Solomon contrasts these ways
[54:27] now the way of the slothful man
[54:30] so it's not only the contrasts of ways
[54:33] but the contrast of characters I'll
[54:36] never forget years and years ago it's
[54:38] actually before I came to the message
[54:40] and I was preaching down in Louisiana
[54:41] preached and actually for brother
[54:42] Lance's grandfather I'm sister crystal
[54:44] and sisters in Thea's father but they're
[54:46] all of her and he took a text I told
[54:48] brother
[54:49] my throat was really sore in sunny more
[54:51] so won't you preach the morning I'll
[54:52] rest a little bit
[54:53] and I'll pick a back up on Sunday night
[54:54] he was one of them old fashioned
[54:57] Pentecostal preachers he hewed the line
[54:58] oh my he took his text and he preached
[55:02] about the amp consider the ant thou
[55:04] sluggard I'll tell you what time he got
[55:07] done on that the elder nerding got saved
[55:09] Oh My I've never forgot that I can't
[55:12] remember all the particulars and the
[55:14] wherefores and the wives but I fell for
[55:16] everybody in there I felt so sorry for
[55:18] him including the devil can't tell me he
[55:21] got done with it I dated it made you
[55:23] want to grab a hold of the altar and say
[55:24] God's tranvia tearing me apart I believe
[55:28] we need some of that friends and this
[55:30] are because the the Laodicean age we
[55:33] live here it's easy to become complacent
[55:36] and dilatory and cold and slothful you
[55:41] have to beg people to st. a special song
[55:43] you've got a bag him to come to repair
[55:46] me you got a bag I'm to pray for
[55:48] somebody that comes up to the altar what
[55:50] is the slothfulness you see the way of
[56:01] the sluggard is one of self prevention
[56:06] the devil actually don't have to do a
[56:09] whole lot they stop themselves
[56:14] because it's his inner complacency that
[56:17] so much on the inside of them so masala
[56:20] Tiff's are going down you know soft form
[56:22] an ass off a woman going down a rapid
[56:25] stream they hit Rapids
[56:28] they're not so bad they don't frighten
[56:31] them too much it's not white-knuckle
[56:33] stuff yet but they know from what they
[56:37] can see in front of them danger lays
[56:39] ahead but instead of trying to go ashore
[56:43] say you know what I'm out too far I
[56:45] better I better get back in there I'm
[56:47] gonna wind up in the mess here so
[56:49] instead of doing that thus awful man or
[56:52] just or woman will sit in the boat and
[56:54] they have their or they had the
[56:55] capability and the strength to stop it
[56:58] but instead of stopping it they just go
[57:00] well then in a few minutes they found
[57:02] themself and a cataract that is deadly
[57:05] now they drag out a and try to
[57:09] save themselves you can blame it on the
[57:13] devil all you want to the devil had
[57:14] nothing to do with him you defeated
[57:16] yourself the power that was given to you
[57:20] back yonder to stop this thing you never
[57:23] used it well praise the Lord but Terry
[57:28] Bell you guys think you can back up
[57:30] within the morning I may have to have
[57:31] you to preach to the mourner getting
[57:32] quiet on me I'm afraid I'm getting fired
[57:33] after this tonight you see he license
[57:37] his power by neglecting to use it think
[57:43] of it the slothful man or woman actually
[57:46] weakens themself by refusing to use the
[57:50] power that God has made available to
[57:53] them Oh God speak to our hearts Lord you
[57:59] see he is his own destroyer or so may I
[58:04] say for her though instead of grabbing a
[58:07] hold of the situation God helped me to
[58:10] use what you've given me a slothful man
[58:13] or woman just keeps going the Fed the
[58:16] thorn heads gets bigger and bigger and
[58:18] higher and higher and what was it one
[58:21] time controllable sin
[58:23] grow and before long hedge this
[58:27] individual in and they find themself
[58:29] headstand and it an amazing how heads
[58:32] doe it never grows a gateway what does
[58:37] it do close one beside the other beside
[58:39] the other beside the other none of them
[58:40] had the genetics in our said now these
[58:42] are gate hinges here and whenever this
[58:44] one stops here XY t o3 v Y it will stop
[58:48] right here leaves three foot and then CY
[58:50] three old four it'll start on the other
[58:52] side and it'll start going around that's
[58:53] not the way they're design they're
[58:55] designed for once in the company another
[58:57] another another another until they have
[59:00] hedged the slothful man around because
[59:03] he looks at what he's God all my and he
[59:06] doesn't look at in the real that what
[59:08] man in his right mind would want
[59:10] together a walk with God what woman in
[59:13] her right mind would want to give up an
[59:15] opportunity to be a daughter of God
[59:17] filled with the Holy Ghost come to
[59:18] church live for the Lord Jesus and give
[59:21] it up for prostitution give it up for
[59:23] drugs give it up for alcohol they're
[59:25] mentally disturbed our whole world
[59:29] friends is groping in insanity
[59:32] oh my maybe six months a year two three
[59:41] four before long they find themselves
[59:43] we're totally enclosed in a hedgerow
[59:48] that's impassable no gate unless you
[1:00:00] happens an old man of God
[1:00:05] he'll take a Holy Ghost Chainsaw lookout
[1:00:13] devil he made our chopper down as fast
[1:00:19] as you want him to but I'll tell you
[1:00:21] what a man a gods wanted to do he's
[1:00:22] wanting to take that thing and river up
[1:00:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus and cut
[1:00:27] out a walkway it may not be but just
[1:00:29] that way and you may have to turn
[1:00:31] sideways and get out like that you may
[1:00:33] be looking for a four-lane highway God
[1:00:36] don't always do it that way sometimes
[1:00:38] God will cut out a narrow path because
[1:00:40] you felt yourself to get in and you may
[1:00:43] have to fight to get out of it and a
[1:00:45] real person that sick of that heads will
[1:00:47] say I'm gonna fight every day of my life
[1:00:49] till I get out of this heads and I was
[1:00:52] living in here and being a slothful
[1:00:54] woman that is the way of a slothful man
[1:01:01] then what does God do turns out man a
[1:01:04] woman into a diligent person so they you
[1:01:13] to one hedge and another and another and
[1:01:16] another they become easily formed habits
[1:01:22] easily formed habits you ever seen
[1:01:26] anybody out miracle growing weeds wonder
[1:01:30] who in the world of this is phrase
[1:01:32] miracle grow on the Nettles who is it
[1:01:34] that this miracle go on the nettles and
[1:01:36] the bars and the thorns and the fifths
[1:01:38] who in the world does that nobody
[1:01:39] they'll grow you have to baby your files
[1:01:42] you have to baby your landscape and come
[1:01:44] on out you're a baby in you got to put
[1:01:47] down all kinds of man around your
[1:01:48] landscape and the glass will come up or
[1:01:50] through it anyway if they don't come up
[1:01:52] to it it'll burn yourself and come right
[1:01:54] up beside a bush and you said well in
[1:01:56] the world did that thing come from it's
[1:01:57] part of the curse don't you understand
[1:02:00] why it's easier for thorns to grow out
[1:02:02] of this than the seed of God don't you
[1:02:05] the Sun wash easier for evil worse to go
[1:02:08] out of this that's easier brother Larry
[1:02:10] it is for the good works of God it is a
[1:02:12] battle for the good word of God to grow
[1:02:15] out of this dirt pile like it or not
[1:02:22] your body its germanized to be a seed
[1:02:26] bed for weeds praise God is one reason
[1:02:37] we come to church you got a pastor
[1:02:40] that's loaded down with we'd be gone
[1:02:48] we'd be gone oh ma but notice the way of
[1:02:56] the righteous man now
[1:02:58] the way of the slothful man is a hedge
[1:03:01] of thorns but the way of the righteous
[1:03:05] is made plain and the word plain is
[1:03:08] paved it's a divine ordained way but it
[1:03:15] isn't just him sitting around and
[1:03:17] waiting on God but this man actually so
[1:03:20] part of this man's character and trait
[1:03:22] that God identifies it as the man's way
[1:03:25] and not his word lorry to God why the
[1:03:28] man is so in touch with God God gave him
[1:03:32] that seal in his heart the way of God is
[1:03:35] imprinted on his soul in so much that
[1:03:37] God would call it the man's way because
[1:03:40] the man was converted by the Spirit of
[1:03:43] God he used to run around is to drink he
[1:03:45] used to lie but he don't go no more and
[1:03:48] God so burst him by heavenly genetics
[1:03:51] that God put his own seed inside of that
[1:03:54] man or woman and breathed on them the
[1:03:56] Holy Ghost and God said I've got so much
[1:03:58] confidence in you I know you're not
[1:04:01] gonna fall I've sealed you to eternity
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:04] mine forever I am yours forever I'm
[1:04:07] gonna go ahead and call this your way
[1:04:11] [Applause]

[1:04:23] a life becomes habits of good behavior

[1:09:08] got us how many how God can take care of
[1:09:11] little slothful man I look at well I
[1:09:14] tell you this looks bad so what a little
[1:09:21] bit of courage he has he talks himself
[1:09:24] out of it where it's all said and done

[1:09:35] game thing and merges himself in a world

[1:19:12] mentally distraught because the excuses
[1:19:15] they make thank you Jesus
[1:19:27] a salsa man how does his hand in his
[1:19:29] bosom and we'll note so let's just bring
[1:19:32] it to him a second so he sits her nobody
[1:19:37] called me from the church they ain't got
[1:19:42] no love we called you eight to seven
[1:19:47] times it's just a slow you never heard
[1:19:49] the phone rang one her it loves to call
[1:19:54] the prodigal son who was it that visited
[1:19:57] him what's deacon was it that got ahold
[1:19:59] to his name tell me if people want to go
[1:20:02] to heaven there ain't enough hell to
[1:20:04] drive them back and if they wanted God
[1:20:06] don't want to go to heaven there ain't
[1:20:07] enough heaven to pull them in notice
[1:20:18] again proverbs oh this is a bad Fox in
[1:20:20] it proverbs twenty thirteen the slothful
[1:20:24] man says there is a lie I shall be
[1:20:32] sighing in the streets
[1:20:39] look at these excuses they're absolutely
[1:20:42] insane absurdity assess this person
[1:20:48] there is a line with that which means
[1:20:50] that were without referring to in the
[1:20:52] wilderness area is not even know word
[1:20:56] close to where he lives but the lioness
[1:20:59] oh my god it's in the Serengeti
[1:21:03] not even the half-hours budget but if I
[1:21:08] go out of the street it might kill me
[1:21:14] somehow to get a white vest was here
[1:21:18] look at how absurd small fulness
[1:21:21] destroys people friends the slothful man
[1:21:30] since there is a lime without now he
[1:21:33] ain't seen one he probably never even
[1:21:35] heard one in his life but in his mind
[1:21:39] well
[1:21:40] was that aligned no it was your house
[1:21:45] cat nitwit scratch scratch cockroach no
[1:21:56] problem let there's a line without oh I
[1:22:01] may be killed on the street if I come
[1:22:03] out so the best thing for me to do is
[1:22:06] stay home this is the soft full person
[1:22:14] now but this stage the foxes have grown
[1:22:17] up had young ones and they got dens all
[1:22:20] around this person's life you see well
[1:22:24] the slothfulness removed from this
[1:22:26] individual all this imagination and lies
[1:22:31] and stuff that is so real to them for
[1:22:34] the most part this volume would live
[1:22:37] from because it's all associated what's
[1:22:42] love honest and excuses and more excuse
[1:22:48] some of the excuses I have heard for
[1:22:50] people not coming to church here I need
[1:22:53] to write a book sometime if I ever had
[1:22:54] time it would be a best-seller excuses
[1:23:01] excuses we hear them every day what if I
[1:23:12] go to church oh my god what are you
[1:23:19] going to apply that philosophy don't you
[1:23:22] ever dare step your foot in Walmart
[1:23:28] or your favorite steakhouse or your
[1:23:30] favorite drive-through place they don't
[1:23:34] keep you from going to Walmart they
[1:23:36] don't keep you from going to win these
[1:23:37] or Hardee's or McDonald's whatever your
[1:23:39] food is you go in and get what you want
[1:23:41] and you leave if you had that same
[1:23:43] attitude about the house of God I don't
[1:23:45] care how many Devils come here you're
[1:23:47] doing that I'm going to see them I'm
[1:23:49] going I'm going to get fed I'm going to
[1:23:52] get some from God they ain't keeping me
[1:23:54] away God's laid it on my heart that's my
[1:23:59] church and I'm staying there till God
[1:24:01] tells me different can I have a little
[1:24:10] more time y'all are cutting for punch
[1:24:12] Supernature proverbs 24 30 I will mother
[1:24:18] filled of the slothful and by the
[1:24:23] vineyard of the man void of understand
[1:24:25] that notice the room and water setting
[1:24:27] is for the Song of Solomon
[1:24:28] it is a vineyard so when by the field of
[1:24:33] the slothful and by the vineyard of the
[1:24:36] man that was void of understanding are
[1:24:41] you thinking one sense of the word how
[1:24:42] about a man like that of a wind up for
[1:24:44] anything but God is merciful God will
[1:24:46] give grace God will save all kinds of
[1:24:47] people God will save people that you and
[1:24:50] I wouldn't give them a nickel God will
[1:24:52] save people and God knows exactly what
[1:24:54] they'll do he knows that many of them
[1:24:55] will turn away from him down the road 5
[1:24:57] years 10 years and he'll bless them in
[1:24:58] love them I'm gonna shock you the
[1:25:00] prophet of God said God loved Cain
[1:25:03] that's right he said he loved Cain and
[1:25:06] went after him God is safe some people
[1:25:09] even in six months time or a year's time
[1:25:11] wouldn't even speak to him but God is a
[1:25:13] merciful and a loving God he'll reach
[1:25:16] down to people he'll help people that
[1:25:18] only uses him as a spirit are and when
[1:25:20] they get back up on the road again they
[1:25:22] throw God in the trunk and don't want to
[1:25:23] speak to him again but he is a merciful
[1:25:26] God
[1:25:27] I'm so glad aren't you so God will give
[1:25:31] people things sometimes they don't even
[1:25:33] deserve
[1:25:37] now remember Solomon was a very devious
[1:25:40] a very industrious type of an individual
[1:25:43] how this must have struck him a man
[1:25:46] genius a man of brilliance a man who
[1:25:49] loved gardens and trees and no doubt
[1:25:52] this must have happened to him at this
[1:25:53] way Carroll that he walked by and he saw
[1:25:55] and he knew this man and he saw this
[1:25:58] place in this vineyard he just tore his
[1:26:00] heart out knowing what the potential was
[1:26:03] for this vineyard to be I went by the
[1:26:07] field of a shawl for the vendor of the
[1:26:10] main void of understanding so the field
[1:26:13] and the vineyard are not his house and
[1:26:15] card necessarily but let's look at it as
[1:26:18] his spiritual possessions he saved is
[1:26:21] forgiven maybe even justified maybe
[1:26:24] lived a sanctified life but he begins to
[1:26:28] neglect that which God has given him let
[1:26:31] me tell you something friend every
[1:26:32] mortal of sins before God one day will
[1:26:34] stand without excuse or you say what if
[1:26:36] I bribed you still be able that excuse
[1:26:37] you know what if you ain't bribed you
[1:26:39] can still live a pretty good life by the
[1:26:41] help of God there's gonna be all kinds
[1:26:43] of folks that's gonna come up to the
[1:26:44] Tribulation Period and they're going to
[1:26:46] be pretty good people you know hard cuz
[1:26:48] they don't want to go to hell so
[1:26:49] basically those of you well I bribed
[1:26:51] ain't going you'll stand there before
[1:26:53] God and be thrown into the pit one day
[1:26:55] because there will be people on the
[1:26:56] center and they're not brought a bit
[1:26:58] more than that trees right but they say
[1:27:00] God I don't want to go to hell I don't
[1:27:02] want to be lost I want to do the best I
[1:27:04] can I want to live a good life God
[1:27:06] you've got a place in heaven for me and
[1:27:07] I want it and you know what they'll be
[1:27:10] there that day there'll be millions
[1:27:12] times millions of them that will stand
[1:27:15] there with no more than that they're not
[1:27:16] elect they're not chosen of God they're
[1:27:19] not the predestinated but they're
[1:27:21] whosoever will and God made them on
[1:27:23] offer and they grab it
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:26] oh ma now watch this man brings Baroness

[1:27:58] thorns neglect brings thorns how
[1:28:03] automatically don't never forget this
[1:28:07] this grows thorns easy this grows
[1:28:12] neglect and slothfulness and saying easy
[1:28:16] these bodies are sin it don't need no
[1:28:25] help friends this is why folks struggle
[1:28:28] with Christianity they just don't
[1:28:29] understand it it's so much easier to
[1:28:31] live the life of a backslider it's
[1:28:33] easier to live the life of a softball
[1:28:34] toppers it's so hard it's so hard it's
[1:28:39] so hard you see what they're talking
[1:28:43] from the dirt you get a drop of that
[1:28:48] eternal life down inside of you your
[1:28:50] worst day as a Christian better than
[1:28:52] your best ever living for the devil low
[1:28:58] levels all grown over the thorns and
[1:29:01] nanos had covered the face face and the
[1:29:08] stone wall was broken down so this
[1:29:16] briars nettles on the face and the stone
[1:29:22] wall which separated this garden from
[1:29:24] the rest of the world compromise allowed
[1:29:31] things to come in I know folks don't
[1:29:33] like walls I know folks that's one thing
[1:29:35] they hate us for this message because we
[1:29:38] preach separation
[1:29:41] they call them prison walls we call them
[1:29:43] palace walls and garden walls a man in
[1:29:48] this country that was going to build a
[1:29:49] garden he's absolutely out of his mind
[1:29:51] if he don't build the wall
[1:29:53] Almighty God gonna build a garden called
[1:29:55] a bride and not put a wall around her no
[1:29:57] sir not my father he's gonna put a wall
[1:30:00] around her and he's gonna put me in line
[1:30:02] Nehemiah in case the wall just broke
[1:30:04] down I hope God will help me tonight
[1:30:06] that I'll be able to help you as may may
[1:30:08] I be a nehemiah to you or I can be able
[1:30:11] to stand up and say brother let's
[1:30:13] rebuild this wall let's be able to
[1:30:15] restructure this wall not to buy Oh make
[1:30:18] fun of us well all the rest of our make
[1:30:20] fun of us but we're rebuilding our
[1:30:22] prayer life we're going to rebuild our
[1:30:24] supernatural walk with God why because
[1:30:27] God said we can have it I'll have a
[1:30:29] Jerusalem without a wall I have a garden
[1:30:32] without a wall well I have a Christian
[1:30:34] experience without a wall you'll never
[1:30:36] keep it so Solomon lost bonny sees this
[1:30:40] beautiful beautiful place maybe remember
[1:30:44] the former days in the life of this man
[1:30:46] or maybe the life of this father and it
[1:30:49] saw what a beautiful thing that was or
[1:30:52] it's a beautiful garden with all types
[1:30:54] of exotic fruits and plants and flowers
[1:30:56] and that had all kinds of finds and Maya
[1:30:59] it was beautiful so the Hat had a
[1:31:01] watchtower in order to watch it they had
[1:31:03] a wall around it they had a press they
[1:31:05] had all these things that was there and
[1:31:07] this guy gets it you see him uptown you
[1:31:13] see him over here and you say hey

[1:31:19] don't believe in purchase I play tapes I
[1:31:24] don't need no prints are telling me what
[1:31:27] to do
[1:31:27] I guess not if you're a goat
[1:31:33] if you're a sheep you still believing
[1:31:35] preachers keep in mind you're listening
[1:31:42] to tapes only you can always pick what
[1:31:44] one you want to hear you control
[1:31:47] fast-forward rewind and everything else
[1:31:49] preachers don't come with a remote Oh
[1:31:51] sometimes some of you wish I did that
[1:31:53] away when I got on something you didn't
[1:31:55] like it
[1:31:57] then whenever I said something you
[1:31:59] really like that you want to throw it
[1:32:01] across the church to somebody else you'd
[1:32:02] rewind it y'all just have me back and
[1:32:12] forth back and forth I come with a
[1:32:14] remote alright but the Holy Ghost has it
[1:32:16] so you can't tell me when to preach what
[1:32:19] to preach how long to preach how short
[1:32:22] to preach how emotional a couple
[1:32:24] children and I know one a bunch of these
[1:32:26] backslidden message people want to
[1:32:28] listen to tapes only they don't want
[1:32:30] know a man of northern man of God just
[1:32:32] stand right and preach the Living Word
[1:32:34] of God and tell them where they're
[1:32:36] living in this day so what is the state
[1:32:52] of this garden been brought to the heart
[1:32:56] in this case it's not run into movies
[1:33:01] it's not money women popularity solemn
[1:33:07] and lazy non one thing swath fulness so
[1:33:12] a place that was so fertile so beautiful

[1:33:30] animals come and go people come and go
[1:33:33] there's no way to protect it
[1:33:39] the thorns evil habits would start in a
[1:33:43] person's life the nettles being the
[1:33:47] things which defenses which those things
[1:33:50] cost to others you see when you walk
[1:33:54] down the street you're not on just

[1:34:20] wall thereof was broken down oh my then
[1:34:23] I saw and considered it well I looked
[1:34:27] upon it and received instruction I hope

[1:37:25] slothfulness the building decay us
[1:37:27] through either honest of the hands the
[1:37:30] house drop us through by idleness and
[1:37:36] slothfulness the building decays in the
[1:37:40] building will fall through it just makes
[1:37:42] sense it's just logical so spiritually
[1:37:45] what about our walk was God a prayer
[1:37:47] life or time to read the Bible and for
[1:37:50] instance I'll be honest we're under the
[1:37:52] same bondage that I preached it to you
[1:37:54] years and years and years ago the
[1:37:56] bondage of time we never have enough
[1:38:01] time I'll be 62 years old here in a few
[1:38:05] weeks I'm at the retirement age
[1:38:08] apparently the Social Security apartment
[1:38:10] think so cuz they sent me and Carol
[1:38:11] thing the other day in the mail I told
[1:38:14] her I said can you believe that whoever
[1:38:17] thought we'd ever got old enough to get
[1:38:19] this in the mail I'm glad y'all think
[1:38:25] it's funny
[1:38:29] but I thought when people got older I
[1:38:32] had this in my mind as a kid that I see
[1:38:35] them old people down in Kentucky sitting
[1:38:38] on the front porch for my brother horn
[1:38:49] hey I always thought I thought it was
[1:39:01] old people you know 50 60 year old
[1:39:04] people that did that now I'm wondering
[1:39:10] when do people ever get but once it ever
[1:39:12] get any better I used to think man you
[1:39:15] get old I mean old preacher you'll get
[1:39:18] to where your burdens get lighter yeah
[1:39:24] mine's harder now in the everywhere my
[1:39:29] difficulties my burdens both private and
[1:39:32] public both family both church
[1:39:36] internationally you to be and every
[1:39:40] other way
[1:39:41] yes and when does it ever not you have
[1:39:46] to be 70 or 80 oh god don't ever I gotta
[1:39:48] wait that long before they leave me
[1:39:49] alone so you know what we have to do
[1:39:55] well there were 60 or 40 or 20 or five
[1:39:58] or 95 we set our pride our eyes upon the
[1:40:03] prize
[1:40:04] you know I keep Norman you know what
[1:40:12] they said that old preachers I don't
[1:40:14] retire they just put them out to pasture
[1:40:17] pa sto R may God give us strength may
[1:40:26] God give us strength may we shake
[1:40:30] slothfulness idleness I made love to be
[1:40:38] remembered tonight before the Lord all
[1:40:41] praise God let's pray together Lord
[1:40:44] Jesus I know these types of services are
[1:40:48] sobering they've already make us look at
[1:40:51] ourselves father but I pray that you
[1:40:54] would help us it wouldn't fall on ground
[1:40:58] that is so hardened Lord Jesus but may
[1:41:02] it fall on fella ground that's broke up
[1:41:07] by the pile and the disc
[1:41:09] oh Jesus may the nutrients of the Soul
[1:41:13] wrap around the seed word I don't think
[1:41:18] there's probably a person in here
[1:41:20] tonight including myself that wouldn't
[1:41:24] say we need to move up a little higher
[1:41:28] Lord God searches almost of us aren't
[1:41:33] like this slothful examples that we read
[1:41:35] of know so more of them would be just in
[1:41:40] that baby fox stage so some of them are
[1:41:45] just where the little fox is gnawing
[1:41:47] around and they've laughed with me
[1:41:49] tonight it's these contrasts that have
[1:41:51] brought and they thought how terrible it
[1:41:54] would be to be such a thing but if they
[1:41:57] don't change the direction in six months
[1:41:59] or a year they'll be exactly will have
[1:42:01] preached tonight because the elements
[1:42:05] are making them slothful is nibbling at
[1:42:09] their little vine tonight oh don't come
[1:42:13] in great bites
[1:42:15] it doesn't come as it was years ago
[1:42:18] whenever I was bit by that Fox is a boy
[1:42:21] and it laid open my hand with its teeth
[1:42:25] and my hand immediately went numb no no
[1:42:30] it's not like that but it's so gentle
[1:42:33] and so easy that we might not even feel

[1:58:08] hallelujah bless your name Lord Jesus
[1:58:12] thank you Father
[1:58:14] let's pray together Lord we thank you
[1:58:17] for your word tonight I know these are
[1:58:21] simple illustrations and they're not
[1:58:24] great theological terms and wouldn't be
[1:58:27] classified as deep and so on and so on
[1:58:30] yet I think we all can relate to it I
[1:58:33] think we all can be witnesses of truths
[1:58:37] to know that these things work on our
[1:58:39] lives it's one thing we so love about
[1:58:42] the Prophet that you sent us in this day
[1:58:44] Lord he would be honest enough to tell
[1:58:47] us he'd get discouraged and he'd get
[1:58:49] down and he'd fight this and go through
[1:58:51] that to give us an insight into the life
[1:58:55] of a great servant of God but yet it was
[1:58:58] not so great that he was superhuman or
[1:59:01] beyond human test not only him Lord
[1:59:04] Jesus but when you come to the earth you
[1:59:07] experience such things I read today when
[1:59:10] your prophet said when they come to you
[1:59:13] that day and said show us a sign and
[1:59:18] said you responded you was discouraged
[1:59:21] when you said it a wicked and evil
[1:59:24] adulterous generation seeks after the
[1:59:26] sign and no sign will be given but Jonas
[1:59:29] the Prophet now read that up on the
[1:59:32] Haqqanis you allowed yourself to feel
[1:59:37] discouragement thank you Lord Jesus for
[1:59:40] that if you had experienced sickness and
[1:59:45] you would experienced sexual temptation
[1:59:48] and all kinds of other things and would
[1:59:51] have left discouragement out than when
[1:59:54] we got discouraged with whatever of life
[1:59:57] we would have went to you you couldn't
[1:59:59] have understood but you allowed yourself
[2:00:02] to feel discouragement
[2:00:06] thank you for that it shows your love to
[2:00:11] us so when I come to you're discouraged
[2:00:14] by the Wes these sisters these young
[2:00:18] people these brothers no matter who they
[2:00:20] are whatever it's brought on their
[2:00:22] discouragement you can relate to our
[2:00:26] feeling thank you so much for loving us
[2:00:32] in such a way that has been God's you
[2:00:36] could never understand such being God's
[2:00:39] you could never even feel such but
[2:00:43] becoming man you said outside the city
[2:00:46] and held your head and groans with a
[2:00:49] headache you were tempted by women
[2:00:52] tempted by drinking bothered by
[2:00:56] discouragement thank you my brethren
[2:01:01] that is part of us looking at you and
[2:01:04] the flights of stairs for we know stairs
[2:01:08] work both ways miss Jacob of all was
[2:01:12] laying there and made a stone his pillow
[2:01:14] and he looked and he saw the angels of
[2:01:17] God ascending and descending he saw the
[2:01:20] ladder anchored up in heaven anchored
[2:01:23] down on the earth
[2:01:24] we saw the angels coming and going on
[2:01:27] that ladder and the prophet tells us
[2:01:29] that ladder was Jesus Christ
[2:01:32] so you ascended and descended you
[2:01:35] condense and when you come down not just
[2:01:38] from the angelic realm but to become a
[2:01:41] man to feel sick to feel troubled to
[2:01:45] feel discouraged and despondent at times
[2:01:49] thank you Lord Jesus so when that little
[2:01:53] Fox comes around trying to discourage us
[2:01:57] and tell us we can't make it we can go
[2:02:01] to you with that sad lonely feeling and
[2:02:04] know that you understand that you'll not
[2:02:07] rebuke us you'll not chastise us but you
[2:02:12] can look at us with understanding in
[2:02:14] your eyes
[2:02:14] and say I know how you feel thank you
[2:02:18] Father
[2:02:19] go with us now pray Lord bring us back
[2:02:22] in the morning if it be pleasing to you
[2:02:24] would you speak to us again Lord you've
[2:02:29] been so kind to us we hate to keep
[2:02:31] asking you but you told us to ask much
[2:02:34] better joy might before if we tear
[2:02:38] another hundred years if time would want
[2:02:41] another thousand there'll be people
