[16:10] So thankful for Brother Matt. If you

[16:16] to go back and listen to it. Um
[16:19] the evidence of salvation. So um that
[16:22] being said, you know, we're going to
[16:23] have activities here. Well, food for
[16:27] everyone. Brother Tony McGraw and Sister
[16:29] Jennifer. Um we I was in here late last
[16:31] night and they were still in there
[16:32] cooking for today. So, make sure and
[16:34] thank them. Brother Matt Willis. Um and
[16:37] those that cooked um lunch for us
[16:39] yesterday. Um thank you so much for
[16:42] that. And all the sisters and help if
[16:43] you would give all them a hand for
[16:45] helping.
[16:48] [applause]
[16:52] [applause]
[16:54] But I want to say that what I'm really
[16:56] thankful for is our youth. Um, you know,
[16:59] there's a lot of places they could have
[17:00] been this weekend, but they chose to
[17:02] come to come sit around the word. And,
[17:05] you know, I'm so grateful for that. And
[17:07] if I don't mean to bore you, you can sit
[17:10] down if I'm boring you. But um
[17:13] when you look at the youth and and in
[17:16] and the way that the devil is is going
[17:18] against the youth nowadays, the things
[17:20] that Satan offers the youth, you know,
[17:23] Brother Donnie asked me about four years
[17:24] ago, pull me in the office and asked me
[17:26] if I would help with the youth. And I I
[17:28] told him I I said, "I I'll not do it
[17:30] without brother Rob."
[17:32] And uh
[17:35] some of you parents that have kids my
[17:37] kids age of my kids
[17:40] when we didn't have all of this
[17:43] brother Rob two or three times a week
[17:47] would have the youth at his house
[17:52] singing doing games fellowshipping.
[17:55] I've often told him, "Brother Rob, I
[17:57] have no idea where my kids would be.
[18:01] If it hadn't been for you and Sister
[18:02] Sarah, we understand God is the glue
[18:05] that holds these youth together,
[18:09] but God needs a little brush sometimes
[18:11] to
[18:13] put it on." Brother Rob's been that.
[18:17] He always preaches, "Find a new friend,
[18:20] love somebody." And he don't always say
[18:21] it. Him and Sister Sarah have been that
[18:23] by example. And I don't I don't He's
[18:26] been a mentor to me. He's been around
[18:28] youth. He's not a minister. He don't
[18:30] claim to be, but he puts a lot of youth
[18:32] ministers to shame by the life he lives
[18:34] in front of our youth. And you know,
[18:36] Brother Donnie always says, "Give them a
[18:38] rose while they're here."
[18:40] &gt;&gt; You know, so I I I I wouldn't be able to
[18:44] do this without him and without brother
[18:45] Donnie giving us the the leadership to
[18:47] do it. So, if you would give Brother
[18:50] Rob, sister Sarah a hand. [applause]
[18:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[19:05] [applause]
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Let's take these needs before the Lord.
[19:12] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so
[19:14] grateful, Lord.
[19:16] Lord, where would we be if we didn't
[19:18] have
[19:19] the word of of this day, the message of
[19:22] the hour to come sit around, Lord, and
[19:25] lay our needs on top of it.
[19:28] Lord, as we've heard in the last week or
[19:30] two, Father, how your prophet said this
[19:32] was a sacred desk. If these needs,
[19:35] Lord, have been written down. They've
[19:37] been laid on this desk. Lord, we know
[19:38] this desk cannot heal them. This desk
[19:41] cannot meet those needs.
[19:46] But the anointing that you've placed in
[19:49] here
[19:51] because everyone here has brought that
[19:52] anointing with them. Father, you've
[19:55] sanctified this place. Lord, this is not
[19:57] a place to come in and criticize. It's
[19:59] not a place to come in and be bitter and
[20:01] hold grudges and not even a place to
[20:04] come in and think about what we're going
[20:05] to do when we get out of here. This is a
[20:07] place where we come, Lord, and we lay
[20:08] our needs at your feet and we re renew
[20:11] our strength for the days that lie
[20:13] ahead, Father.
[20:15] every need that's been written down,
[20:16] Lord. You're mindful of everyone. Not
[20:19] one is greater than the other.
[20:22] They're all great needs in your sight,
[20:23] Lord. So, we know that if we pull our
[20:25] faith together, if we believe, Father,
[20:28] in your word that you said, Lord, if we
[20:30] had faith the size of a grain of a
[20:32] mustard seed, we could say to this
[20:35] mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into
[20:36] the sea, Father, and it would be done."
[20:39] But you also said, "Sometimes you got to
[20:40] climb that mountain." So give us
[20:43] strength for one and faith for the
[20:45] other. Lord, we thank you for it. We're
[20:48] believing you for it. Pray, Lord, that
[20:50] the minister comes, Father, that you
[20:52] would anoint him as you have in the last
[20:54] two days.
[20:56] Meet every need with your word, Father.
[20:57] Bless the music that's played, Brother
[20:59] Aaron, Father, and all the songs that
[21:01] songs that are sung. We give you glory
[21:03] in Jesus name. Amen.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; We appreciate Brother Joe a little bit
[21:09] too this morning, don't we?
[21:11] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this little course.
[21:17] Brothers want to come receive the
[21:18] morning tithing offering [music] at this
[21:19] time. Um, also, we got three specials
[21:22] this morning. If they'd be making their
[21:23] way to the platform, uh, Sister Emily
[21:25] Allen, Sister Lydia, Sister Elise. I
[21:27] know there's a lot of a lot of specials
[21:29] that were turned in that they just
[21:30] couldn't get to this weekend. [music]
[21:31] But next time you're here, get them in
[21:34] early and you can we'll get you up here
[21:36] [music] to sing. Amen. Let's just sing
[21:38] this little course this morning.

[41:25] In [singing]
[41:26] the presence
[41:30] [music]
[41:32] of [singing]
[41:34] the
[41:35] king.
[41:37] [singing]
[41:41] [applause]
[41:55] It's awesome what his presence can do.
[42:01] Prostitutes have walked into his
[42:03] presence, walked out changed.
[42:07] The blind were carried into his presence
[42:11] and walked out with their sight.
[42:14] Church members walked into his presence,
[42:17] became sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; So I guess the question today is for us.
[42:24] What do you have need of?
[42:27] &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. Don't you?
[42:30] &gt;&gt; He promised us whether it's two or three
[42:32] gathered together in my name, I'll be in
[42:35] his midst.
[42:37] We're so happy and grateful that all the
[42:40] visitors have been with us and our days
[42:42] has been set aside for these youth
[42:44] services and trust that something has
[42:46] been said or done that'll help you in
[42:49] your journey. We by no means have
[42:52] meetings like this to try to hinder or
[42:55] to hurt or to bring any type of thing in
[43:00] a negative way that would hinder your
[43:02] walk with God.
[43:04] I'm grateful that we still have men of
[43:06] God in this day who have given their
[43:08] life for the cause of Jesus Christ.
[43:11] Aren't you? Let's stand together. We'll
[43:13] invite brother Matt to come and just
[43:16] bring to us what what the Lord has
[43:18] placed upon his heart for today. Um we
[43:22] welcome each of you that are here in our
[43:24] gates with us and we trust that God will
[43:27] meet with us in a very special way. He's
[43:31] the only one that could be able to
[43:33] custom fit a service to where every
[43:36] hungry heart could have something.
[43:40] Amen. Sing something for us, Harry.
[43:42] [music] Let's just open our hearts
[43:44] together to the Lord now. And just
[43:46] whatever you have need now remember a
[43:48] minister studies and God gives him
[43:50] thoughts and scriptures and quotes and
[43:52] ideas and it goes to putting it
[43:54] together. And maybe your need lays
[43:56] outside the confines of what he's
[43:59] actually studied. But remember, you have
[44:02] the ability to pull on the gift. And the
[44:05] Holy Ghost can so come and minister to
[44:08] you in such a way. It may not be but
[44:10] two, three sentences or a paragraph. But
[44:13] those two, three sentences will change
[44:15] your life.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] woman
[44:21] [music]
[44:21] tried so many [singing]
[44:26] Jesus.
[44:28] Thank you, Father.
[44:31] Yet grew [singing and music] worse.
[44:34] So did Jesus.
[44:37] She came. [singing]
[44:39] [music]
[44:43] And when [singing]
[44:46] the unbelievers tried
[44:49] to frame her [singing]
[44:53] [music]
[44:55] she whispered
[44:58] these words [music]
[45:00] everybody together through her [singing]
[45:02] pain. This is what we [music] want to
[45:04] do. Oh,
[45:07] touching Jesus
[45:09] [singing]
[45:10] is all [music] that really matter.
[45:18] [music] And then [singing] your life
[45:22] will never be
[45:25] this. You believe that with all your
[45:27] [music] heart. Thank you, Lord,
[45:31] for there's only
[45:34] [singing]
[45:35] one way
[45:37] to touch. [music]
[45:42] You must [singing] believe
[45:46] when you [music] call on.
[45:50] Let's sing the chorus once together
[45:52] again, everybody. [music]
[45:53] Oh,
[45:55] touching Jesus
[45:58] [music] is all
[46:01] that really matters. [music]
[46:04] Thank you, Father.
[46:07] And [singing] then your [music] life
[46:10] will never
[46:19] [music]
[46:23] [singing]
[46:27] [music]
[46:32] [music]
[46:36] His
[46:39] name
[46:45] [music]
[46:47] is all [singing]
[46:49] that really matter.
[46:56] Then [music and singing] your life
[46:58] will never be
[47:02] [music] the same.
[47:06] For [singing]
[47:08] there's only
[47:10] [music]
[47:12] one way
[47:14] to touch him [music]
[47:19] and just believe
[47:23] when you call on
[47:26] his [music] name.
[47:29] [singing]
[47:31] My just a wonderful presence
[47:33] opportunity that we have to be gathered
[47:35] together. My I just feel the presence of
[47:38] the Lord is here. And as we're just
[47:40] singing this song, maybe they'll just
[47:42] keep playing that. We'll go into prayer.
[47:45] Touching Jesus.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; It It's all It's all that that matters.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, nothing else matters
[47:54] &gt;&gt; is touching Jesus. And when he comes by
[47:58] and he comes by your way and he starts
[48:00] to deal with your heart and and you know
[48:03] what I love about his presence and
[48:06] touching Jesus, it's it's not always
[48:09] words. It's not something that can be
[48:11] said. It's just his presence.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And in his presence there's fullness of
[48:17] life and there's joy. There's there's
[48:19] peace. There's there's deliverance.
[48:21] There's there's comfort. It it seems
[48:24] like when he comes by, all the questions
[48:26] that you had, they kind of just melt
[48:28] away and the only thing that matters is
[48:30] him and him alone and and and you're
[48:33] with Jesus and you know, and the
[48:35] heartache and the pain and the struggle
[48:37] and all those things, you know, you
[48:39] start to understand it's going to be
[48:40] okay. It's going to be all right cuz I'm
[48:42] with Jesus.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just go before our Lord,
[48:46] Lord Jesus, how we love you.
[48:49] And truly, Lord, as the song would sing,
[48:53] [music] touching Jesus is all that
[48:56] really matters.
[48:58] [snorts] Lord,
[49:00] how many of us here this morning could
[49:02] testify that you've come by and you've
[49:04] touched our heart and you touched our
[49:06] life, Lord? And
[49:08] Lord, we had the need of salvation and
[49:10] we had the need of deliverance and we
[49:12] were lost sinners and undone.
[49:17] Lord, your great love where in which you
[49:19] loved us, you saw fit to come and pluck
[49:22] us out of the muck and the mire and
[49:26] to let us know that you loved us and you
[49:28] forgave us of all of our sin and you've
[49:30] raised us up into heavenly places
[49:33] in Christ Jesus. Lord, what an hour,
[49:35] what an opportunity, what a privilege.
[49:39] Lord, we want to tell you we love you,
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Lord. Thank you for doing that, Lord.
[49:45] Thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank you
[49:47] for shedding your blood that I could be
[49:49] forgiven and I could be free, Lord, from
[49:53] the things of this world and not in
[49:56] bondage, but have a real liberty, Lord,
[49:59] to serve you and to love you and to love
[50:02] this message of the hour that's called
[50:05] us out of the darkness of Lady Oilia,
[50:07] Lord, and it set us free to soar in
[50:09] heavenly places.
[50:12] Oh, how we thank you, Lord.
[50:14] Lord, as we just turn to the preaching
[50:16] of the word, Lord, I need you to come
[50:19] and just
[50:22] Lord, anoint myself to get out of the
[50:24] way. Anoint the ears of the hearer,
[50:26] Lord. And
[50:28] Lord, I always think of that that boy
[50:31] that had those fishes and loaves and
[50:33] there was the multitude and he didn't
[50:36] have enough to feed the people.
[50:40] But when he placed it into your hands,
[50:43] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[50:44] &gt;&gt; It was more than enough.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; They were taking up fragments and had
[50:48] leftovers, Lord. And I pray that, Lord,
[50:51] these scriptures and quotes that I have
[50:53] placed down, Lord, you'd just take it
[50:54] into your hands now. And you'll minister
[50:57] to the needs of your people in the name
[50:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[51:01] Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your
[51:03] Bibles, we'll be reading out of Romans
[51:05] chapter 8.
[51:17] uh Romans chapter 8, a very familiar
[51:20] scripture and uh verse 10. But I just
[51:23] want to thank uh brother Joe and brother
[51:25] Donnie for the opportunity to
[51:28] uh be in fellowship with you all and to
[51:30] speak to you. It's just been such a
[51:32] privilege uh to be here and an honor and
[51:35] and I started to realize and look out uh
[51:38] a lot of the young people that I've come
[51:40] to know and and see in different places
[51:42] and those from brother Josh Bennett and
[51:44] other uh churches uh am I just coming
[51:47] from Arizona and Oklahoma and certain
[51:50] places. I thought my goodness is this is
[51:52] wonderful to see all the saints of God.
[51:54] We just love each one of you and want
[51:55] you young people to know that we love
[51:58] you and cherish you and are proud of
[52:01] you.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Really proud of you because you are the
[52:05] message of the hour.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; And it's just a wonderful thing. And and
[52:09] while I have this uh opportunity, I I do
[52:13] want to let uh uh brother Donnie know
[52:16] how much I've appreciated him and his
[52:18] ministry and sister Carol and and my I
[52:21] I've over the years, you know, over the
[52:23] last 25 years of just being able to hear
[52:26] Brother Donnie minister, I I I when I I
[52:28] love a a ministry that it just pulls
[52:31] something out of you. It just identifies
[52:32] something in your soul. And and I just
[52:35] want to thank brother Donnie for your
[52:36] stand and unwavering compromise on the
[52:38] message of the hour.
[52:41] [applause]

[52:47] I I I've I've I've been a great
[52:49] beneficiary of the gift of God that he's
[52:52] placed in this body of Jesus Christ.
[52:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, we do bring
[52:56] greetings from our pastor, brother David
[52:58] Mciri and the Saints in Bedford, Texas.
[53:01] and just want to move right into the
[53:02] word and see what God would have for us.
[53:04] Amen. Romans chapter 8 and verse 10, it
[53:08] would read, "And if Christ be in you,
[53:10] the body is dead because of sin, but the
[53:12] spirit is life because of righteousness.
[53:15] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[53:18] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[53:21] that raised up Christ from the dead
[53:22] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[53:26] his spirit that dwelleth in you." Amen.
[53:29] You may be seated. And also just want to
[53:32] read a scripture we read on the opening
[53:33] night uh in Galatians 3 and verse 29.
[53:42] Galatians 3 and 29. It says, "If ye be
[53:44] Christ,
[53:46] then are you Abraham's seed and hes
[53:49] according to the promise." And we read
[53:52] the uh this quote out of possessing all
[53:56] things as we ministered on the evidence
[53:57] of salvation. Uh, brother Brandham says
[54:01] just what Joshua did for the children of
[54:03] Israel. Joshua means savior. The word
[54:07] Joshua and that's the same thing Jesus
[54:09] done for the church when they killed
[54:11] him. He conquered death. He conquered
[54:13] hell. He conquered the grave. And he
[54:15] rose up again with the evidence, the
[54:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost that there is
[54:20] a land beyond the river that they call
[54:22] the sweet forever. Amen. And he come
[54:24] back and brought us an evidence. What
[54:26] does it do, brother Brandham? It makes
[54:28] you stop your lying, stealing, drinking,
[54:31] cursing, immorals, everything. It makes
[54:33] us a new creature, a new creature out of
[54:36] you. I who were once dead in sin and
[54:38] trespasses. Nevertheless, I, not me, but
[54:40] Christ lives in me. I'm a new creature
[54:43] in Christ Jesus. Amen. Heir to the
[54:45] promise. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That land
[54:48] belongs to us. How do you know it?
[54:50] Joshua rose from the dead, brought back
[54:52] the evidence, the Holy Ghost, and I got
[54:54] it. Amen. Glory. I'm an heir. Oh, a
[54:57] child of the king, a child of the king,
[55:00] heir to all things. The Bible said so.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we we ministered on the
[55:05] evidence of salvation, you know, the
[55:07] evidence, it's the proof, you know, I
[55:10] it's the Holy Ghost and how we are a
[55:12] possessor of all things. Uh we have been
[55:15] given a a promise. And you know, I was
[55:17] just thinking about the evidence and and
[55:19] and how the Lord would maybe lead in
[55:21] this service and you know, what we would
[55:23] minister on and and you know, he he said
[55:26] he brought back the evidence and the
[55:27] evidence is the Holy Ghost. And now the
[55:29] the Holy Ghost is in us. And and I was
[55:31] just even thinking about that, you know,
[55:33] that time there that those men went
[55:35] looking for the Welsh revival. They were
[55:36] maybe looking for some movement. They
[55:38] were looking for some gathering. and and
[55:40] and when they and when they saw uh uh
[55:43] that that officer there, you know,
[55:44] twirling the baton and directing traffic
[55:46] or whatnot, they came over there and
[55:48] asked him, they said, "Sir, we want to
[55:50] see if you can help us, but but we're
[55:52] looking for something. We're looking for
[55:54] the Welsh revival." And he said, "You're
[55:57] I am the Welsh revival. You're looking
[55:59] at it." And and what's on my heart to
[56:01] minister to to you this morning is is I
[56:03] am the evidence.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection.
[56:09] Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And by the help of God, we'll just move
[56:12] along these lines as the as we just went
[56:15] through some thoughts how, you know,
[56:16] Christ is the word and the spirit that
[56:19] comes upon the word that quickens the
[56:20] word and makes it alive. And and we
[56:23] ministered last night how an evil spirit
[56:24] will will will a spooky spirit will will
[56:27] raise up and just how Joshua and Caleb I
[56:29] they went over into the the the land of
[56:31] Israel and they came back with the very
[56:33] evidence and the fruit that it was
[56:34] everything that God said it was and they
[56:36] said, "Let us go up at once." I mean, we
[56:38] are more than able. I I mean, it it's
[56:41] amazing to me what how how a believer
[56:44] looks at the promise and looks at the
[56:46] obstacle than than a skeptic or an
[56:48] unbeliever or a doubter because they
[56:50] were over there walking through the land
[56:52] and going, "Oh my goodness, uh we can't
[56:54] take this and it's too much and my you
[56:56] know that maybe the food is good here,
[56:57] but I tell you what, we ain't got a
[56:59] chance." And Joshua and Caleb, they're
[57:01] walking around and and looking at the
[57:02] biggest giants of the land and going,
[57:04] "Yep, we are more than able to do it." I
[57:07] tell you what, this is going to be a
[57:08] cakewalk because the same God that
[57:10] brought us out of Egypt, the same God
[57:12] that's been leading us through the
[57:14] wilderness, he's the same God that
[57:16] brought us through the Red Sea, he's the
[57:17] same God that's going to take us into
[57:19] the promised land. And he'll be the same
[57:21] God that'll annihilate and destroy all
[57:23] of our enemies. And because God gave us
[57:26] the promise, there is nothing that can
[57:28] stop us from going into our inheritance.
[57:30] I tell you, why not? Let's just go up at
[57:33] once. Let's take it all. Give me my
[57:35] mountain. There ain't no devil. There
[57:37] ain't no darkness. There ain't no demon
[57:39] that can stop me. We are well more able
[57:42] to take the land. Let us go up at once.
[57:47] [applause]
[57:49] And they got back over and Joshua and
[57:51] Caleb, they were all enthused about the
[57:53] evidence and they came here presented
[57:55] and say it's everything that God said it
[57:58] would be. Oh my, it just strikes me now.
[58:00] I want to tell you this message of the
[58:02] hour is everything that God said it was.
[58:05] It's my joy. It's my peace. It's my
[58:08] deliverance. It's my salvation. It's my
[58:10] reward. It's my glory. It's my all and
[58:13] all. It's everything that I ever wanted.
[58:15] And it's everything that I ever needed.
[58:17] It's more than enough. I want to say the
[58:19] message is more than enough. It'll save
[58:21] you. It'll deliver you. It'll fill you.
[58:24] It'll give you the joy. It'll give you
[58:26] the victory. It'll give you the peace.
[58:28] It'll take you to a land beyond the
[58:30] river that we call the sweet forever
[58:32] forever. I tell you what, what a
[58:34] promise. What an inheritance that we
[58:36] have.
[58:38] I say we got something to be excited
[58:40] about. [applause]
[58:45] &gt;&gt; They come back excited and they come
[58:46] back enthused.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; We got the evidence
[58:52] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden an evil report rose
[58:55] up.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Well, wait a second, guys.
[58:59] How
[59:00] I mean, were we not in the same place?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I mean, Lady Oia is a dark and wicked
[59:06] age.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, have you not seen the giants in
[59:10] the land and the lush devils and and all
[59:12] these these demons that were fighting
[59:14] that over there? There ain't no way we
[59:16] can take that land. There's no way a
[59:18] young person could live an overcoming
[59:20] life in Lady Osia. There's no way they
[59:22] can overcome all the strip teases and
[59:25] all the lust devils that walk around.
[59:27] There ain't no way we can go over there
[59:28] and take the land. And I tell you what,
[59:30] how in the world would we ever go into a
[59:32] body change? How in the world are we
[59:34] ever going to be changed in a moment in
[59:36] the twinkling of the eye? See, they
[59:37] brought up all that doubt and all that
[59:39] wonder. But you know, Joshua and Caleb
[59:41] were over there saying, "He's more than
[59:43] able to do it." Why? Because the same
[59:45] pillar of fire that brought us up out of
[59:47] Egypt. The same pillar of fire that led
[59:49] us through the wilderness. The same
[59:50] pillar of fire is the one that bringing
[59:52] us into the promised land. I want to
[59:53] tell you, it's the same pillar of fire
[59:55] that was with brother Brandham. is the
[59:57] same pillar of fire that is right here
[59:59] in the building right here this morning.
[1:00:01] He will give you the promise. He will
[1:00:03] take you into the land. He will help you
[1:00:05] defeat every devil and every demon. I
[1:00:07] don't care what it is, young people,
[1:00:09] that you're fighting. There's an
[1:00:10] anointing upon the word of the hour to
[1:00:13] bring you into the manifestation and the
[1:00:15] fulfilling of every single promise of
[1:00:17] God. You don't have to worry. You don't
[1:00:19] have to fear. You just got to say that
[1:00:21] God promised it and I'm more [screaming]
[1:00:23] than a conqueror through Jesus Christ
[1:00:26] that strengthens me. Hey, let us go up
[1:00:29] at once and take the land. There ain't
[1:00:31] no devil. There ain't no sickness. There
[1:00:33] ain't no trial that can stop me from
[1:00:36] walking into my divine promise of
[1:00:38] almighty God. It's a good land. The
[1:00:41] message is a good land.
[1:00:43] Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[1:00:50] An evil report rose up.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; No, you can't do it.
[1:00:59] You You You can't take the land. But my
[1:01:03] prophet said he rose from the dead and
[1:01:05] brought back the evidence, the Holy
[1:01:07] Ghost.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And I got it.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm already feeling pretty
[1:01:14] good because I know what I had when I
[1:01:17] was out in the world. And it wasn't
[1:01:19] much. I had a bunch of fear. I had a
[1:01:22] bunch of anxiety. I had a bunch of
[1:01:24] bondage. I had a bunch of weight. I had
[1:01:26] a taskmaster that told me, "Go here, do
[1:01:28] this, bow here, smoke that, drink that."
[1:01:31] But one day, I called on the name of the
[1:01:33] Lord and I got saved and I got filled
[1:01:36] with the Holy Ghost. And I'm here to
[1:01:38] tell you, I'm standing in 2025. I got
[1:01:41] the Holy Ghost. I got it. Is there are
[1:01:44] people here this morning that can say,
[1:01:46] "I got the evidence. I'm the proof of
[1:01:48] his resurrection. I got the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:51] I got the message of the hour. I'm
[1:01:54] living it. I'm breathing it. I'm walking
[1:01:56] in it. I'm loving it. I got it.
[1:01:59] [screaming]
[1:02:01] Hallelujah. Is there a young people that
[1:02:04] can raise up in this generation of 2025
[1:02:07] and say, "I got it."
[1:02:14] Or are you still listening to that
[1:02:16] spooky spirit?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it. No.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; No. No, you ain't got it.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; No, that was just that was just emotion.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That was just a workup,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; you know. That was just you were just
[1:02:35] getting excited because you're friends.
[1:02:37] [sighs]
[1:02:39] What? That's what chapter is that?
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; What? What? What? Oh, that's that spooky
[1:02:51] spirit.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the How do you know when the
[1:02:54] devil's lying? When he's running his
[1:02:56] mouth.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I think sometimes it's a good time and
[1:03:00] maybe the only time that you can use
[1:03:01] that word and say, "Shut up.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Shut up, you old dun devil. I've done
[1:03:05] heard from my theophony. I know where I
[1:03:08] came from and I know where I am going. I
[1:03:12] done got the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:14] shut up in my bones. So quit running
[1:03:16] your mouth. Is there a young people here
[1:03:18] that you just want to go ahead and
[1:03:20] testify the devil's been lying to me.
[1:03:22] He's been telling me I ain't got the
[1:03:24] Holy Ghost. Been telling me I ain't
[1:03:25] going to go in the rapture. Telling me I
[1:03:27] the message ain't for me. And you just
[1:03:29] want to shout out this morning and say I
[1:03:32] got [screaming] it. I got the
[1:03:33] revelation.
[1:03:35] I got the Holy Ghost. I got the
[1:03:37] evidence. A matter of fact, I am
[1:03:40] [screaming] the evidence.
[1:03:42] [applause]
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; I am the proof of his resurrection.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in a place he
[1:03:53] said, "The spirit that's in you is the
[1:03:56] word made flesh in you."
[1:03:59] I want to just read this quote out of
[1:04:01] wisdom versus faith. Brother Brandham
[1:04:03] says, "The Bible said, "Not by power,
[1:04:06] not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth
[1:04:09] the Lord. Not by wisdom,
[1:04:12] not by knowledge, not by nomination,
[1:04:16] but with my spirit, I will what?
[1:04:19] Energize my word."
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; The disciples had it swed into them.
[1:04:25] Then the spirit come to energize the
[1:04:27] word. See, not by power, not by might,
[1:04:31] not by wisdom, not by understanding.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for that
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; because I I really can't understand a
[1:04:39] lot.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; No, not by that, but by my spirit,
[1:04:46] I will energize
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; my word. Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; By my spirit, say the Lord. It's the
[1:04:53] water of the word of faith that
[1:04:55] energizes the word of God and makes it
[1:04:58] work. So, I'm beginning to understand
[1:05:01] the promise isn't based on how I feel.
[1:05:04] The promise isn't based on what I can
[1:05:07] figure out. It It's not based on my
[1:05:10] ability. It's not even based on my good
[1:05:12] works. It's not based on something that
[1:05:15] I can do, but it's actually based on
[1:05:18] what he said.
[1:05:20] When God came to Abraham and he gave
[1:05:22] Abraham a promise and he said,"Abraham,
[1:05:25] I will make you."
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; I will make you.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask Abraham, you know, uh,
[1:05:33] Abraham, do you think you can or or or
[1:05:36] would you would you do you think you can
[1:05:38] you can get good enough on your own? Or
[1:05:40] no, he come to him and he gave him a
[1:05:42] promise and said, Abraham, I will.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; And we know how the story goes. It was
[1:05:48] never based on Abraham's ability. It was
[1:05:51] always based on the promise. And it is
[1:05:54] no different because we are Abraham's
[1:05:56] seed. We are the the royal seed uh the
[1:05:59] elected of God. And it's not because of
[1:06:02] maybe what we can look at as our good
[1:06:04] works or our efforts. But it's always
[1:06:06] based upon the word. It's always based
[1:06:09] upon the promise. Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet would say this in end time
[1:06:13] signed seed. He said when the word come
[1:06:15] to Mary, she never doubted it. She said,
[1:06:18] "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it
[1:06:22] unto me according to thy word." See, she
[1:06:25] never said, "Now, you wait till I feel
[1:06:27] life."
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And then I'll go testify.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; You wait till I'm positive.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; That's the way we so-called Christians
[1:06:37] do today. Wait till I'm positive. Wait
[1:06:40] till I begin to get better. and wait
[1:06:43] till I see something happen
[1:06:46] and then I'll do it. No sir, that's not
[1:06:48] the question. You believe first.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; So, we have been taught by a vindicated
[1:06:54] prophet that you can take God at his
[1:06:57] word and I want to tell you if something
[1:06:59] in your heart is believing and wanting
[1:07:01] the word. We heard brother Brandham said
[1:07:03] that is eternal life that's calling to
[1:07:05] you and he said you are an heir to that.
[1:07:08] And so if God is making a call upon your
[1:07:11] life, then you don't base it on how
[1:07:13] you're feeling. You don't base it on
[1:07:16] your circumstance. You say, "That is the
[1:07:18] word of the Lord and I believe it." But
[1:07:20] many times when that happens, you know,
[1:07:22] the devil is always wanting to try to
[1:07:25] offer some type of emotion or some type
[1:07:27] of sensation and I'll just go launch
[1:07:29] right into it now because that's exactly
[1:07:31] what happened to me in in my conversion.
[1:07:33] And I got to a place, you know, where
[1:07:35] where uh uh you know, I needed help and
[1:07:38] and I I don't have time to go into all
[1:07:39] those things, but I I'd messed up my
[1:07:41] life pretty pretty bad and and I had an
[1:07:43] experience when I was 12 years old at at
[1:07:45] Louisiana camp, I knew God that was
[1:07:47] real, but but but I didn't feed that
[1:07:49] fire. I kept hanging out with the same
[1:07:51] kids in the neighborhood and and run
[1:07:52] around the neighborhood. And as they got
[1:07:54] older and started to do different
[1:07:55] things, you know, I I was around those
[1:07:57] influences and and and I held on for a
[1:07:59] while. And you know what? They actually
[1:08:00] even respected me and said, "Oh, wow.
[1:08:02] You're a Christian. and you don't do
[1:08:03] this and you don't do that. Well, that's
[1:08:04] okay. We like Christians. Come on
[1:08:06] around, old buddy. You better watch out.
[1:08:09] Them friends you're hanging out with and
[1:08:11] oh, you're a Christian, mom. I'm being a
[1:08:13] light. You better watch out. You ain't
[1:08:15] got no business being on their grounds.
[1:08:18] [cheering]
[1:08:19] [applause]
[1:08:20] I held my testimony for a season.
[1:08:24] But you know what? Then I lost my
[1:08:26] reason. There's actually a quote on
[1:08:28] that. when you lose your reason, when
[1:08:30] you get between two opinions and and and
[1:08:33] for a while I I said, "I didn't do this
[1:08:35] because of that. I'm a Christian. I
[1:08:36] don't I don't." And one day my friend
[1:08:38] said, "Man, why don't you smoke?" And I
[1:08:40] said, "Well, it makes you cough." Wrong
[1:08:42] answer.
[1:08:44] I had lost my reason, Brother Donnie. I
[1:08:46] used to be. I'm a Christian. I don't go
[1:08:47] I don't watch movies because of this. I
[1:08:49] I don't get on them websites because of
[1:08:51] this. I don't do that because I'm a
[1:08:52] Christian. But somewhere along the line,
[1:08:55] I had been beguiled and I lost my reason
[1:08:58] of why I didn't do the things that I I
[1:09:00] wasn't supposed to be doing. And I gave
[1:09:02] the wrong answer. And when I gave the
[1:09:04] wrong answer, I didn't give a word
[1:09:07] answer.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; I said, "It makes you cough." So guess
[1:09:12] what? Oh, just just a little. Just try a
[1:09:14] little. And and and right from that
[1:09:16] moment, I got pulled out into the world
[1:09:18] in a life of sin. I got myself into a
[1:09:20] lot of trouble. And I got to the place
[1:09:22] where I wanted the deliverance. And I
[1:09:23] remember making the decision in my heart
[1:09:25] and in my life that I'm never going to
[1:09:27] do these things again. I I really don't
[1:09:30] I I I well, I just go ahead and say it.
[1:09:31] I if if I didn't clean up my life, I was
[1:09:33] going to fail a drug test and I was
[1:09:35] going to go be in prison.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; That's just what it is. All right. And
[1:09:41] that's how Satan took me. And and I
[1:09:43] realized, man, if I don't clean up my
[1:09:44] life, I'm going to I'm going to fail
[1:09:45] these tests. And and I'm I started to
[1:09:47] think, man, I I need to clean up my act.
[1:09:49] I need to quit doing these things. And
[1:09:50] so I made a decision to quit doing those
[1:09:52] things. And and you want to know what?
[1:09:54] My decision didn't last long at all.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; There was some little old voice telling
[1:09:58] me, you got plenty of time. Just you got
[1:10:00] plenty of time. I tell you what, that
[1:10:01] same devil lives today. Don't give your
[1:10:03] heart to God Sunday morning. You just
[1:10:05] wait till Wednesday. Just wait till
[1:10:07] camp. Wait till your friends right here.
[1:10:09] Not this preacher. Not that preacher.
[1:10:10] Not brother D. Oh, there's always an
[1:10:12] excuse and a lying devil that wants you
[1:10:15] to put off the day of your salvation.
[1:10:16] But I want to tell you and declare to
[1:10:18] you, now is the time of salvation. Today
[1:10:22] is the salvation of the Lord. And I came
[1:10:25] to that moment and I had made the
[1:10:27] choice. I'm going to clean up my life.
[1:10:28] I'll never do these things anymore. I
[1:10:30] [laughter] I I I I can't risk ruining
[1:10:33] and throwing away my whole life. And I
[1:10:35] remember I made that decision and I came
[1:10:37] back in uh to the the you know, the
[1:10:39] officer that was going to test me for
[1:10:40] those things. And he said, "Oh, I won't
[1:10:42] see you here uh for another test." and
[1:10:44] and and and 45 days. And right at that
[1:10:47] moment when he said that, it was
[1:10:48] something like something next to me was
[1:10:49] going, "Hey, we got plenty of time. We
[1:10:51] we can do whatever we want to do." And
[1:10:53] in that moment, I realized that
[1:10:55] something else was making decisions for
[1:10:57] me.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that strange? Something else was
[1:11:01] leading me. Something else was guiding
[1:11:02] me. Something else was pulling me into
[1:11:04] the lust and and telling me just one
[1:11:06] more time or just do that or just go
[1:11:08] down here. And I realized it was another
[1:11:10] nature. Actually, it was your first
[1:11:12] husband. uh uh the world that you're
[1:11:14] married to and you didn't realize that
[1:11:16] those thoughts that you've been having,
[1:11:17] that's the first nature of the devil
[1:11:19] that's leading you. Those ain't even
[1:11:20] your thoughts. And he told me, "You got
[1:11:22] plenty of time on Matthew. It'll be
[1:11:24] okay." And in that moment, I realized
[1:11:26] whatever that was was not me. And
[1:11:29] whatever it is, it's bigger than me. And
[1:11:31] I said, "God, I need your help."
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; So I left and and I got into my car and
[1:11:43] you know I had called on the name of the
[1:11:44] Lord. Feels good to do that.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And I got to driving down down down down
[1:11:51] the road and all of a sudden I don't
[1:11:53] know why
[1:11:55] but this voice this thing said we'll
[1:11:57] just get emotional and cry
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; and I was like what?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Well, you've called on the name of the
[1:12:06] Lord. Now, just get emotional and cry.
[1:12:09] And I thought, get emotional and cry.
[1:12:12] And I thought, you know, I'd been
[1:12:14] raised, right? And I thought, well, it's
[1:12:16] not about getting emotional and crying.
[1:12:18] And then an old song came into my heart.
[1:12:20] I said, it's in the name of Jesus. I
[1:12:22] said, and I started singing that song.
[1:12:23] It's in the name of Jesus. In the name
[1:12:26] of Jesus, we have the victory.
[1:12:31] And I started singing that song and and
[1:12:34] before you know it, I I didn't even
[1:12:36] realize that some guy pulled up next to
[1:12:37] me in what he thought was a fancy car. I
[1:12:39] thought maybe I had a fancy car and you
[1:12:41] know how
[1:12:43] ignorant people do. They pick fights
[1:12:44] with one another for no reason at all,
[1:12:46] you know. And he he pulled up beside me
[1:12:48] and and I I still my posture hadn't
[1:12:50] changed yet, you know. So I I'm I'm in
[1:12:52] there, you know, just kind of in my car
[1:12:54] and I look over there and I look at him,
[1:12:56] you know, and and all of a sudden he
[1:12:58] makes this big old face like this and
[1:12:59] goes and takes off and I'm like, "Well,
[1:13:02] what in the world is he looking?" I
[1:13:03] looked up in the mirror and before you
[1:13:04] know, I was crying and I was emotional.
[1:13:06] You know why? Because I put the word
[1:13:08] first. I I didn't I didn't say, "Well,
[1:13:09] it's about my how emotional I get. It's
[1:13:12] about crying." But something in my heart
[1:13:14] rose up said, "It's in the name of Jesus
[1:13:16] Christ that I had the victory." and oh
[1:13:18] then the spirit of God I I didn't
[1:13:19] realize it at the moment but he was
[1:13:21] moving upon my life but what was the
[1:13:22] what was the devil wanting to do? He was
[1:13:24] wanting to offer me some emotional
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; as an evidence.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; But praise God, there was something in
[1:13:34] my heart. I needed more than an emotion.
[1:13:36] I needed more than just a shout. I
[1:13:38] needed more than just just just just
[1:13:41] some temporary moment. I needed
[1:13:43] something that could change my life. I
[1:13:45] needed the God of the Bible. I needed
[1:13:47] the God of Abraham. I needed the God of
[1:13:49] Isaac. I needed the God of Jacob. I
[1:13:51] needed the God of Paul and of John. I
[1:13:54] needed the God of William Brandom. I
[1:13:56] needed something to come down and
[1:13:58] energize my soul and change me.
[1:14:03] [applause]
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Well, and since we're here, I'll just
[1:14:09] keep going.
[1:14:12] So, you know, I I'm I now I am I now I
[1:14:16] am getting a little emotional and I am
[1:14:17] crying.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; But I I I this is just a journey. It's a
[1:14:22] start. And I'm still in the journey. I
[1:14:23] ain't trying to say anything about about
[1:14:25] that. But so I got home and I was
[1:14:27] excited. I had called on the name of the
[1:14:29] Lord and you know and I I' I I'd been
[1:14:32] out pretty hard in the world and and my
[1:14:34] brothers, they were serving the Lord and
[1:14:35] but it just so happened it was a Friday
[1:14:37] night of my dad's anniversary meetings
[1:14:39] and there was believers in town and and
[1:14:42] people were out at the restaurant and
[1:14:43] and and I didn't have any dealings, you
[1:14:45] know, uh as far as maybe a a wave. you
[1:14:48] and I remember crawling out my window to
[1:14:50] avoid having to see folks and and uh but
[1:14:52] now you know I've called on the name of
[1:14:54] the Lord and and I'm feeling good and
[1:14:56] you know now I want to I want to I want
[1:14:58] to be with believers you know and so I
[1:15:00] get home I want to know where my
[1:15:01] brothers are. I said mom I said where
[1:15:03] where's where's everybody at? She's like
[1:15:05] well they're they're at the restaurant.
[1:15:07] You know she's kind of confused like why
[1:15:08] do why why do you care? And I said okay
[1:15:11] thanks. And I went out and I got back in
[1:15:14] my vehicle and I was about to about to
[1:15:15] just head to the restaurant in that same
[1:15:17] voice. Isn't it strange this this same
[1:15:19] thought that would come with just one
[1:15:21] more time, just one more moment, or or
[1:15:23] just maybe I'll put it in ways you can
[1:15:24] understand. Not this service, not not
[1:15:26] this morning,
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; not not today. Just just put it off one
[1:15:30] more time. Or no, you're okay. And I got
[1:15:33] back in that car and and and and I and I
[1:15:36] was just about to go and and and and I
[1:15:38] heard that thought say, "I'll get you
[1:15:40] right back out in the world with music
[1:15:41] and TV."
[1:15:44] And in that moment, you know, I didn't
[1:15:46] realize, but I found out uh I found a
[1:15:48] quote for it because uh brother Brandham
[1:15:50] talks about Shamgar, I believe it is.
[1:15:52] And he said, you know, Shamgar got
[1:15:54] angry. The spirit of the Lord moved upon
[1:15:56] Shamgar and he got angry. And I didn't
[1:15:58] realize it in that moment when I heard
[1:16:00] that thought. He said, I'll get you back
[1:16:02] out in the world with music TV. I said,
[1:16:03] "Get me. You're you're going to get me."
[1:16:06] And I jumped out of my car and I I ran
[1:16:08] into the garage and I was looking all
[1:16:10] around in there and I found a big old
[1:16:12] pair of bolt cutters. You know, these
[1:16:13] big old eagle claw wire clippers. You
[1:16:15] know, they're uh cutters. I don't know.
[1:16:17] They're maybe 3 4t long. And I and I I
[1:16:19] didn't even know what I was doing. I
[1:16:20] found those things and I grabbed them
[1:16:21] and I ran back in the house and I
[1:16:23] started coming through the kitchen and I
[1:16:24] said, "I'm going to get you. You're not
[1:16:26] going to get me. I'll show you." And my
[1:16:29] mom goes, "Matthew, wait."
[1:16:33] Remember, I just asked her where my
[1:16:35] brothers were.
[1:16:40] She thought somebody was about to get
[1:16:41] it.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Well, she wasn't wrong.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And I remember in that moment, I I I
[1:16:48] rounded up the stairs and I flung open
[1:16:50] my door and there was a big old TV
[1:16:52] sitting there and I took them big old
[1:16:53] bunk bolt cutters and I swung them and I
[1:16:56] hit that TV and that thing exploded and
[1:16:58] I screamed out, "How you like me now?
[1:17:03] [applause]
[1:17:08] And in that moment, [applause]
[1:17:11] in that moment when I screamed out, "How
[1:17:13] you like me now?" There came something
[1:17:15] pouring out of heaven that came upon my
[1:17:17] life. Oh, and it changed the way that I
[1:17:20] thought. It changed the way that I
[1:17:21] wanted to dress. It changed my actions.
[1:17:24] It changed my thinking. My soul had
[1:17:26] become energized to be what I was always
[1:17:29] predestinated to be. And that was a son
[1:17:31] of God. I was heir to all the promises.
[1:17:34] I was heir to salvation. I'm heir to the
[1:17:37] resurrection. I was heir to all these
[1:17:39] things, but I was out there living in
[1:17:41] sin. I want to tell you if there's a
[1:17:43] young person here this morning or old
[1:17:45] alike, I say, you know what it does?
[1:17:47] Sometimes you just got to get mad at the
[1:17:49] devil and say, "Devil, I'm sick and
[1:17:51] tired of you robbing me of my joy,
[1:17:53] robbing me of my peace. I'm going to get
[1:17:55] you this morning. I'm coming after you.
[1:17:58] Take the word of God, which is the sword
[1:18:00] of the spirit. Look that devil right in
[1:18:02] the face and say, "I'm coming for you."
[1:18:04] And hit him with the word. If he don't
[1:18:06] move, hit him again. Hit him again. Hit
[1:18:09] him again. And then scream out, "How you
[1:18:11] like me now? [screaming]
[1:18:13] [applause]
[1:18:15] Where's the next one?" [applause]
[1:18:19] Hallelujah. I say there's an experience
[1:18:22] here for you this morning,
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; but you got to believe first.
[1:18:33] Oh, that came after believing.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; See, my my first nature,
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; you know, and I used to always give this
[1:18:42] testimony uh that, you know, for years I
[1:18:45] heard the devil say and I heard the
[1:18:46] devil say and I heard the devil say and
[1:18:48] then I heard a testimony one time uh
[1:18:50] given uh I can't verify but it seemed
[1:18:53] credible source that said it and and it
[1:18:55] meant a lot to me so I'll take it for
[1:18:57] myself. And he he was testifying how
[1:18:59] brother Brandham, I believe, was uh uh
[1:19:01] talking to um I always forget the
[1:19:04] brother. He mentions him as a prophet in
[1:19:05] South Africa. And he was he was he was
[1:19:08] speaking to him and he said he was
[1:19:10] talking about that that picture where it
[1:19:11] looks like the pillar of fire is kind of
[1:19:13] swirling up around the around the
[1:19:15] pulpit. And he he he said to him, he
[1:19:16] said, "You see that uh uh brethren right
[1:19:18] behind there? You see that image? That's
[1:19:20] an old Indian chief." He said he says,
[1:19:21] "That's my old nature."
[1:19:24] And he said, "It's always back there
[1:19:25] trying to" He said, "See what happens?"
[1:19:27] He says, "When the Holy Spirit comes in,
[1:19:29] it burns that nature out of you.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And that old nature goes out behind you
[1:19:34] and it's always looking for an
[1:19:36] opportunity to come back into the seat
[1:19:37] of authority."
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Something along those lines. And when I
[1:19:40] heard that, all of a sudden, it struck
[1:19:42] me and I realized what I was calling the
[1:19:44] devil all those times was actually my
[1:19:46] first nature. It was my first husband
[1:19:48] that I was born with. And I caught the
[1:19:50] revelation. Oh, that was that first
[1:19:52] nature. That's why in Romans 7, Paul is
[1:19:55] telling the church, look, as long as as
[1:19:57] a woman's husband is alive, she's
[1:19:59] subject under the law. Has to has to
[1:20:02] live under that. And he brings down the
[1:20:04] type. And he's showing the only way that
[1:20:05] she can be free from that bondage is
[1:20:08] that first husband has to die and then
[1:20:10] he's free. And that's why Paul said,
[1:20:12] "Then you can be married to another.
[1:20:14] Then you can be married to Jesus
[1:20:15] Christ." Look, a lot of us are trying to
[1:20:17] hang on to the world and hang on to the
[1:20:19] word at the same time. But I want to
[1:20:20] tell you, you got to die. That first
[1:20:22] nature gots to die. You got to repent of
[1:20:24] your sins. You got to call out say, "Oh,
[1:20:26] God, help me. I want deliverance from
[1:20:28] the things. I don't want to listen to
[1:20:30] country music. I don't want to listen to
[1:20:32] the radio. I don't want to dress this
[1:20:33] way. I don't want to act this way. I
[1:20:35] don't want to watch these things." You
[1:20:37] got to realize there's another nature, a
[1:20:39] fierce nature. And that nature gots to
[1:20:41] die. And you got to call upon the name
[1:20:43] of the Lord with all your heart. Say,
[1:20:45] "Lord, I'm sick and tired of being sick
[1:20:47] and tired. I'm tired of the devil
[1:20:49] running me here and there and me never
[1:20:52] getting the victory and going through
[1:20:53] cycles of revival and death over and
[1:20:56] over from one camp to the next camp. I
[1:20:58] need to put a stake down. I need to be
[1:21:00] changed. I need to meet the pillar of
[1:21:02] fire and know that he's the same
[1:21:04] yesterday, today, and forever. And that
[1:21:07] first man's got to die.
[1:21:10] [applause]
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; And die. It did.
[1:21:20] [gasps]
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; But you know, [sighs]
[1:21:23] you still got this little bag of bones.
[1:21:30] But you know, you realize that
[1:21:33] I' I've been given a promise to bring it
[1:21:35] under subjection.
[1:21:38] [gasps]
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; My promised land might not be some
[1:21:41] boundaries set out there with with with
[1:21:44] landscape stakes, but I've been given
[1:21:48] this land.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; This is the place that I can express the
[1:21:54] evidence.
[1:21:56] This is where I can prove that he's the
[1:21:58] same yesterday, today, and the forever.
[1:22:00] And the things that come out of this
[1:22:02] mouth can declare he is risen. And the
[1:22:05] footsteps that I can take can show he's
[1:22:08] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:22:10] And my attitude and my joy can can show
[1:22:14] that he is not dead.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; He is alive.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Where is the Welsh revival?
[1:22:22] Where is the bride's revival?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You're looking at it.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I'm the proof.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence. I once was dead,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; but I have been made alive in Jesus
[1:22:37] Christ. I've been set free from the
[1:22:40] things of the world.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; How, Matthew?
[1:22:45] Well, I I believed.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; But you know, you can't even believe
[1:22:49] unless it's given to you to believe.
[1:22:54] You realize how rigged this thing is?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And and and and I don't mind saying it
[1:23:01] because brother Donnie, I I needed that.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; I needed it to be rigged.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And so I know that
[1:23:14] I make mistakes. Sure. I I I go through
[1:23:18] hard times and I fall down and and I
[1:23:21] realize I I'm being built up into the
[1:23:23] stature of a perfect man and coming into
[1:23:25] that place of of perfect love and and
[1:23:27] working out of those things and I
[1:23:29] realize there's there's still some some
[1:23:30] things in this pest house that that God
[1:23:32] is working on and and sometimes, you
[1:23:34] know, things can rub you a certain way
[1:23:35] and you don't have the right response.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you, it starts first
[1:23:40] with taking God at his word.
[1:23:43] And I tell you what, we make salvation
[1:23:45] and we make the the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:47] Ghost complicated.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; It is not complicated.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Are you tired of living the way you're
[1:23:52] living
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; or I mean, if you're still enjoying it,
[1:23:58] look, I'll tell you this. This happened
[1:23:59] to me 6 months before my conversion.
[1:24:01] Because I tell you what, sin is a it's a
[1:24:03] it's a it's a hard taskmaster. I mean,
[1:24:06] them mud pits and them slaves that beat
[1:24:08] you in Egypt, I'm telling you what.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might enjoy it for a little
[1:24:12] while, but then you start to realize
[1:24:13] they'll start, you know, making you make
[1:24:14] bricks without straw.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And you know that thing that used to get
[1:24:18] you high, it don't get you high anymore.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And that thing you looked at that you
[1:24:22] like so much, it just don't do it for
[1:24:23] you anymore.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And it ain't one movies, it's two
[1:24:26] movies.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And it ain't 25 bucks an hour, it needs
[1:24:28] to be 30 bucks an hour. And it ain't 50
[1:24:30] bucks an hour, it has to be 100. The
[1:24:32] things of the world, they'll never
[1:24:34] satisfy.
[1:24:36] never never never never never never
[1:24:37] never never satisfy
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; the hunger and thirst of a true son and
[1:24:42] daughter of God.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I got tired of of you
[1:24:46] know, living under that. And so I'll
[1:24:47] never forget I jumped out I I I was
[1:24:50] driving down the road and and I jumped
[1:24:51] out of my my my car and I ran down and I
[1:24:53] got in a ditch and and I I started
[1:24:55] talking to the Lord and and it's kind of
[1:24:58] funny looking back on it because I was
[1:25:00] tired of the bondage but I kind of
[1:25:03] still, you know,
[1:25:05] like doing it.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; But there came a day
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I was just tired of it all.
[1:25:15] I didn't want to do any of that stuff
[1:25:16] anymore. I
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I actually realized what it was doing to
[1:25:19] my life and how Satan was trying to rob
[1:25:21] me and I hated it.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. If if
[1:25:24] you're there,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; if you if it's in your heart and you
[1:25:27] keep want to run out with the things of
[1:25:28] the world,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; it'll be there for you.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; But I say if something in your heart
[1:25:35] say, you know what, that's right. It's
[1:25:38] such a late hour. I don't need to fool
[1:25:40] around. you start entertaining things of
[1:25:42] the world, it'll take you way further
[1:25:43] than you want to go.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; And I remember praying there and and uh
[1:25:50] you know, but I I I remember in my
[1:25:52] heart, you know, I I didn't I didn't
[1:25:55] really I didn't really want to give up
[1:25:56] those things. So, I'm fast forwarding
[1:25:58] and showing you that when that first
[1:26:00] initial cry of my heart came and I
[1:26:01] really meant business, but I just
[1:26:03] remember in my heart it was just calling
[1:26:04] upon the name of the Lord and you shall
[1:26:06] be saved. It first comes by believing.
[1:26:08] And and I was just in this as we as I it
[1:26:11] struck me, you know, that's the same
[1:26:12] thing that happened with John Ryan. You
[1:26:14] know, he come through the the the prayer
[1:26:16] line and and and he said, you know, God
[1:26:18] bless you. You're healed. And he went
[1:26:19] through and he said he come back through
[1:26:20] and said, I thought you said I was
[1:26:21] healed. He said, I thought you said you
[1:26:22] believed.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; I thought you said I had the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:27] I thought you said you had it.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with it?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Are you waiting for a feeling? Are you
[1:26:35] waiting for I don't know why we're here,
[1:26:36] but we're here.
[1:26:38] Or are you looking by faith into the
[1:26:40] word of God and saying, "God, you said
[1:26:42] if I repent of my sins and I'm baptized
[1:26:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[1:26:45] shall get the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[1:26:47] You know what brother Brandham told John
[1:26:48] Ryan? He said, "If you believe it, then
[1:26:50] go out there and testify. Go into
[1:26:52] action." And you know what he did? He
[1:26:53] really believed. So he started going
[1:26:54] around town saying, "I'm healed. I'm
[1:26:56] healed. I'm healed." And he actually had
[1:26:58] a testimony to go along with his faith.
[1:27:00] And you know the rest of the story that
[1:27:01] happened. He's sitting in that old
[1:27:02] barber chair and here they were making
[1:27:04] fun of him. and he went to testify. And
[1:27:05] once again, hey, God's healed me. And
[1:27:07] then his eyes come open. I want to tell
[1:27:09] you young people, if God give you a
[1:27:10] promise and you say, I got the Holy
[1:27:12] Ghost, don't let that old devil rob you
[1:27:14] of the Holy Ghost. You go feel free to
[1:27:16] testify, I've repented of my sins. I've
[1:27:18] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:20] Jesus Christ, and God give me the Holy
[1:27:22] Ghost. And if you've made a mistake or
[1:27:23] you've made a failure, get right back up
[1:27:25] and say, I plead the blood of Jesus
[1:27:26] Christ. God, give me the promise of the
[1:27:28] Holy Ghost. If I didn't overcome this
[1:27:30] time, I'll overcome the next time
[1:27:32] because God has given me a promise. And
[1:27:34] I'm heir to every single promise. And I
[1:27:36] got the faith to believe it. And there
[1:27:38] ain't no devil or spooky spirit that's
[1:27:40] going to rob me and take me away from my
[1:27:42] joy and my victory. Come on, people.
[1:27:45] Come on, young people. You got to
[1:27:47] testify about it.
[1:27:50] Brother Brandham goes on. He says, "What
[1:27:52] what just in this this quote that we're
[1:27:55] reading, you got to believe first."
[1:27:57] Well, we just ask for the Lord to help
[1:27:59] us here.
[1:28:01] He said, 'What did Elijah tell the woman
[1:28:03] that he went to with nothing but a
[1:28:05] handful of milk? He said, 'Make me a
[1:28:06] cake first. The miracle will happen
[1:28:08] after you take God's word first. You
[1:28:09] begin to believe God's word and then the
[1:28:11] miracle takes place upon the word
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; because the word is the seed that brings
[1:28:17] forth the miracle. Go to take the word
[1:28:20] first. The Holy Spirit gives it life
[1:28:22] like water falling from heaven. Jesus
[1:28:24] said the he said it is the spirit that
[1:28:26] quickenth the flesh that profitth you
[1:28:28] nothing. The words that I speak unto you
[1:28:30] they are spirit and they are life. He
[1:28:32] said in one place the seed word itself
[1:28:34] is what? The holy spirit energizes.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Now I like that because when you think
[1:28:39] about something that's energized when
[1:28:41] something's energized it's stimulated.
[1:28:43] It's awakened. It's quickened. It's
[1:28:45] electrified.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been electrified?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you it's a revelation.
[1:28:53] Yeah.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; When you when you get shocked and you
[1:28:55] get the revelation of of voltage, I want
[1:28:59] to tell you that type of revelation, you
[1:29:01] can't stand still.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to move.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; You're going to shout. You're going to
[1:29:07] do something. You're going to be do
[1:29:08] something like this. You're going to
[1:29:09] what? Wow. [screaming] Whoa. Wow. Good.
[1:29:12] Go. Woo. That that got some that got
[1:29:15] some electricity into it. I want to tell
[1:29:16] you that's the same thing with the
[1:29:18] message of the hour. When you get a
[1:29:19] revelation, look, it will move you. You
[1:29:22] can't stand still. You're going to
[1:29:24] shout. You're going to tell somebody.
[1:29:26] Somebody's going to look over you and
[1:29:27] say, say, "Hey, why you acting like
[1:29:29] that? Hey, I've been electrified. I've
[1:29:31] been awakened. I've been stimulated. I
[1:29:34] got revelation."
[1:29:37] It'll put you into action.
[1:29:39] [applause]
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; It's just like a seed with all the
[1:29:43] potential. It's just laying there, but
[1:29:45] it just needs to be energized. It just
[1:29:48] needs to be awakened. You know, it just
[1:29:50] reminds me as brother Brandon talks
[1:29:52] about how they everybody's saying,
[1:29:53] "Hunger, fast, pray, hunger, fast,
[1:29:55] pray." He said, "What are they doing?"
[1:29:56] He said, "They've missed the awakening
[1:29:58] of the bride." But God has sent a
[1:30:00] message by a vindicated prophet
[1:30:02] according to Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30.
[1:30:05] There has been a message that has come
[1:30:07] forth and the breaking of those seals to
[1:30:09] awaken the bride of Jesus Christ to all
[1:30:12] the potential that the word says that
[1:30:13] you are.
[1:30:16] Brother Brandham says it takes the
[1:30:17] spirit of God to bring life out of
[1:30:19] broken sisters. And the life must not
[1:30:21] come out of just an intellectual
[1:30:23] revival. It has to come out of the
[1:30:25] Bible, a word revival. And what that
[1:30:27] that word is the same yesterday, today,
[1:30:29] and forever. And when it falls today,
[1:30:31] and quickened, you get the same results
[1:30:34] you did in Acts 2. Exactly. It always
[1:30:36] had, it always will be because it's the
[1:30:38] spirit of God that conditions the
[1:30:40] atmosphere. It takes the spirit. It
[1:30:43] takes atmosphere to do things. That's
[1:30:45] the reason you men are always taught to
[1:30:47] bring your children here.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Here,
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; here.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:30:58] together. Right?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Because when we come together,
[1:31:03] there's an atmosphere.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; When we come together, we bring the
[1:31:07] licks of fire. When we come together, we
[1:31:08] know there's the pillar of fire. We know
[1:31:10] the angel of the Lord is here. He's
[1:31:11] present amongst us and we're taught to
[1:31:13] bring our kids here. Why? Because when
[1:31:15] we come together, there's an atmosphere
[1:31:17] and it takes atmosphere to do things. I
[1:31:20] pray there'd be such an atmosphere
[1:31:21] created here this morning. There'd be
[1:31:23] such an expectation. There be be people
[1:31:25] who are sick and tired of their task
[1:31:27] masters. There's people that want to get
[1:31:29] born again. There's people that want to
[1:31:30] get filled with the Holy Ghost. There's
[1:31:32] such an atmosphere fear here for
[1:31:33] salvation, an atmosphere here for uh for
[1:31:36] for healing. I tell you what, there
[1:31:37] could be an atmosphere created here that
[1:31:40] faith can rise up to believe all things.
[1:31:42] I want to tell you right now, this
[1:31:43] morning, we are se seated in the realms
[1:31:45] where all things are possible to them
[1:31:48] that believe right here in this
[1:31:50] atmosphere this morning in this church.
[1:31:52] The supernatural can take place.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Why? because an atmosphere you know the
[1:32:03] prophet of God said down in your soul is
[1:32:04] a predestinated seed which is eternal
[1:32:06] life.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; It was always there
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will
[1:32:15] come.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come.
[1:32:21] That means you're not going to just come
[1:32:23] halfway.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You're not going to only come part of
[1:32:25] the way. Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to come all the way because
[1:32:29] he said you're going to come all the
[1:32:31] way.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to maybe just move into
[1:32:35] some very familiar things. And maybe if
[1:32:38] we just need to act like we've never
[1:32:39] heard it before,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; but we've allowed things to become
[1:32:44] common to us.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And and just what was on my heart is
[1:32:47] talking about the evidence of salvation
[1:32:49] and how a spooky spirit tries tries to
[1:32:52] to to rob you of it. My my heart for you
[1:32:54] young people I is is yes. Yes yes yes
[1:32:57] you are the bride of Jesus Christ. Yes,
[1:32:59] God has given you a promise and yes, God
[1:33:02] has promised you the Holy Ghost and and
[1:33:04] and maybe you're in a stage of
[1:33:06] justification or sanctification
[1:33:09] and you're believing for the the Holy
[1:33:10] Ghost. But I want to tell you I in in
[1:33:13] all of those stages, it's all the Holy
[1:33:15] Ghost.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; It's the word. It's the spirit.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; It's all a work of God in your life.
[1:33:24] And when God starts to move into your
[1:33:26] life, if if we start to doubt the word
[1:33:28] and doubt our experience and doubt our
[1:33:30] weapon, then the devil can corner you
[1:33:31] and he can start to discourage you and
[1:33:33] he can and you know what you instead of
[1:33:35] you going forward all a sudden you stop.
[1:33:39] And I can't tell you countless uh uh
[1:33:41] young people that that will come and and
[1:33:43] I'm not discouraging you to do that. You
[1:33:45] do that. I we we want to pray with you.
[1:33:46] We want you to come. You show who side
[1:33:48] that you're on. And many times they come
[1:33:50] for prayer and and what's on their heart
[1:33:52] is like I don't know if I got the Holy
[1:33:54] Ghost. I I you know I I might I want to
[1:33:56] tell you young people I I've come to the
[1:33:59] same conclusion after serving God for
[1:34:01] 101 15 years and knowing I got the Holy
[1:34:03] Ghost and knowing I've been changed and
[1:34:05] then I make some bad decision and do
[1:34:07] some things I shouldn't do and then I
[1:34:08] look into the word I'm like
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; and then the prophet preach a message in
[1:34:13] such a way and I'm like man I brother
[1:34:15] Donnie I don't even know if I got it.
[1:34:17] Right?
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, my goodness gracious, this is,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; wow, how could I ever be that?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And then I go,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; okay, well, what what what happens if I
[1:34:27] don't got it?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, am I going to go back to the
[1:34:31] world?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie, you know what? I
[1:34:35] realized I couldn't live it, so I'm just
[1:34:36] going to go down the Baptist church.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Hey, what's your options?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Like, really?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; What's your options?
[1:34:46] The problem is is we want the devil
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; to give us options.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. What happens if I ain't got the
[1:34:54] Holy Ghost? Well,
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repent of my sins.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say, Lord, you started the
[1:35:02] work.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And you'll finish that work.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And you said, if I repent of my sins and
[1:35:08] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:35:10] Jesus Christ, I shall receive the gift
[1:35:12] of the Holy Ghost. And God is not a man
[1:35:13] that he shall lie. and Lord, if you
[1:35:16] never do another thing for me, you've
[1:35:18] already done enough for me. And then I
[1:35:20] start kind of feeling pretty good. And I
[1:35:22] realize, you know what? I maybe I messed
[1:35:24] up. But my Bible tells me my name was
[1:35:26] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:28] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:35:30] whether I got it now or whether I get it
[1:35:32] tomorrow or whether I had it yesterday,
[1:35:34] it really don't matter because this
[1:35:35] thing is rigged. I am going in a
[1:35:37] rapture. I got a promise of the Holy
[1:35:39] Ghost. I got a promise of victory.
[1:35:41] Hallelujah. That old devil, you old
[1:35:43] spooky spirit trying to rob these young
[1:35:45] people of the evidence of salvation, of
[1:35:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Somebody
[1:35:49] here ought to just get mad and say, "You
[1:35:51] old devil. You old spooky spirit. You've
[1:35:53] lied to me long enough. How you like me
[1:35:56] now? I got it. I got it. I got the
[1:36:00] evidence. Shut up in my bones.
[1:36:04] Glory.
[1:36:06] [applause]
[1:36:07] Now you can start walking
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; because as soon as you listen to
[1:36:14] something that's not in the word, it
[1:36:16] stops your progress.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe I You know what? What?
[1:36:25] What's Nelly? Remember Nelly had a real
[1:36:28] experience?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You know, she's walking down the road
[1:36:31] and all a sudden, oh, you know,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; high school
[1:36:36] prom, dance, friends, neighbor.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Nowadays, it's all on your phone,
[1:36:43] Instagram, old friend went to school
[1:36:45] with. I'll see how they're doing. I'll
[1:36:48] like their profile.
[1:36:50] I'll just see what it's all about. I'll
[1:36:52] just stop for a moment.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you're pulled into
[1:36:56] some atmosphere. You're pulled into some
[1:36:59] temptation. And all of a sudden, you're
[1:37:01] in the arms of another man. And she came
[1:37:03] to herself. And I tell you what, people
[1:37:05] want to condemn Nelly Nelly Sanders. But
[1:37:07] you know what? She knew where to go.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; She didn't run down to the Baptist
[1:37:11] church. She didn't run down to this. You
[1:37:13] know, she said, "I'm going to go to the
[1:37:14] prophet of God. She ran on down to the
[1:37:17] prophet and said, "Oh, brother Brandon,
[1:37:18] brother Brandon, Brother Brandon, I
[1:37:20] messed up. I really made a mistake. I
[1:37:22] really messed up now. I've ruined it."
[1:37:24] Prophet took her. And he started to pray
[1:37:26] for her. And he started to rebuke that
[1:37:28] spirit. And you know what he said? He
[1:37:29] said, "You old Satan, you old devil. She
[1:37:31] didn't mean to do it.
[1:37:34] Hey young people, a lot of you didn't
[1:37:36] mean to do it. You were trapped into it
[1:37:38] when you showed up here. You didn't mean
[1:37:40] to give into those lust devils and all
[1:37:41] those things. There was just a nature
[1:37:43] hanging on you. You didn't mean to do
[1:37:45] it. But a vindicated prophet said,
[1:37:46] "Satan, you take your hands off of her.
[1:37:48] I claim her for the glory of Almighty
[1:37:50] God. And I will stand here this morning.
[1:37:52] I will claim every young person, every
[1:37:55] daughter and son of God for the glory of
[1:37:57] Almighty." Satan, you take your hands
[1:37:59] off these young people. They are free to
[1:38:01] serve God with all of their heart, with
[1:38:03] all of their life, with all of their
[1:38:04] soul. They've been pro promised the
[1:38:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost. They can put
[1:38:08] every devil, every demon, every suicide,
[1:38:12] every complex under their feet. Why?
[1:38:14] They've been predestinated to do it.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Well, what about it, church?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; In an atmosphere like this,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:38:30] to them that believe.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Why wait any longer?
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; We're more than able.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; I want to bring some evidence.
[1:38:49] [gasps] We listen to the devil so much.
[1:38:51] We listen to some spooky spirits and
[1:38:53] we've been ministering about the
[1:38:54] evidence of salvation, the Holy Ghost,
[1:38:56] and how Satan's always wanting to rob
[1:38:58] you of that. But what do you have to do
[1:38:59] first? You got to believe.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this.
[1:39:06] The real invisible union, the real
[1:39:09] genuine eagles here. My sheep know my
[1:39:12] voice. A stranger they won't follow.
[1:39:15] Why? It was put in there by
[1:39:17] predestination.
[1:39:20] You were for ordained to be a son of
[1:39:22] God.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You were in God before the foundation of
[1:39:27] the world. That's right.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I can still get excited.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I can I can't even comprehend that, but
[1:39:35] I believe it.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Call me a nut. Call me a lunatic. Call
[1:39:41] me a fanatic. I believe it. Something in
[1:39:44] here is more real than my five senses.
[1:39:46] It's more real than my emotions. It's
[1:39:48] more real than all of the other things.
[1:39:50] There's another uh sense, the sixth
[1:39:52] sense of faith that when I hear that,
[1:39:55] oh, glory to God, that's my reality.
[1:40:00] [applause]
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; All right, all the young people in here,
[1:40:07] raise your hand.
[1:40:12] I mean, if the change is on, it's going
[1:40:13] the wrong direction.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I know time's speeding up, but
[1:40:20] come on. You walked in at 15 and now
[1:40:23] you're 50.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, all you young people, raise
[1:40:27] your hands.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; If you're 30 and under, raise your hand.
[1:40:33] We got some that are over and they're
[1:40:34] already claiming their promise. Glory, I
[1:40:36] haven't lost one.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:42] Listen, God is speaking to you and and
[1:40:45] we we could go into it, but
[1:40:48] we take for granted
[1:40:51] that we live under the revelation of
[1:40:53] Malachi 4:5.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; I can't express enough
[1:41:02] of how privileged we are
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; to hear a vindicated prophet.
[1:41:09] not not a gift of prophecy,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; but a very mouthpiece piece of God
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; to tell you his thoughts of you.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; This is God's mind to you young people.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; And I want you to believe it
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; because when we catch a revelation of
[1:41:31] these things,
[1:41:34] it it doesn't matter what comes or goes.
[1:41:37] You have an anchor. You have an
[1:41:39] absolute.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And you're not subject to to trends and
[1:41:43] fashions and emotions. Yes, we're going
[1:41:46] to have hurt feelings. We're going to
[1:41:47] have broken hearts. There's a lot of
[1:41:49] things on this side that mold our
[1:41:50] character. You know, Brother Brandham
[1:41:52] said you, you know, it's it is joy. It
[1:41:54] is wonderful. But, you know, it's it's
[1:41:56] also a way of agony and suffering. So,
[1:41:58] we're not taking away from those things.
[1:42:00] You're going to have to go through hard
[1:42:02] times and through journey. But when you
[1:42:03] have a revelation in your soul to know
[1:42:05] God's thoughts towards you, it's the
[1:42:07] victory.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; All right, so some familiar things. We
[1:42:11] got some young people here. We'll try to
[1:42:13] move quickly. It is Sunday. We only got
[1:42:16] one service.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's all right, brother
[1:42:21] Donnie.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; You were fore orained to a son of God.
[1:42:27] You were in God before the foundation of
[1:42:29] the world. You're only manifested in
[1:42:32] this day for his honor and glory. How
[1:42:35] can you do it without honoring his word
[1:42:37] and stand with every word of God? Yes,
[1:42:39] sir. Which you are a part of that word
[1:42:42] by predestination. Because look, the God
[1:42:46] God is the word. You believe it?
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Well, if he always was the word, in the
[1:42:51] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:42:52] with God, then you were in God. the
[1:42:55] word. The part that you're to play was
[1:42:59] in God before the foundation of the
[1:43:01] world. He seen you. He knew you. He
[1:43:04] predestinated you to it.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; The part that you're to play.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You are actually playing out a part
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; that was predestinated in the mind of
[1:43:18] God.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; He knew your stature. He knew how tall.
[1:43:23] He knew how short. He knew how wide. And
[1:43:26] I want to tell you, we might laugh and
[1:43:27] chuckle at those things, but Satan does
[1:43:29] a lot of damage with the
[1:43:30] characteristics. Look, I should have
[1:43:32] given up a long time ago with a nose
[1:43:33] this big,
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; but God knew how I would show up.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we got to embrace that
[1:43:43] part of the revelation, too.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because we'll battle complexes,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; generational curses. Why does my family
[1:43:53] have to be this way? Why is this all God
[1:43:56] knew exactly how you would show up?
[1:43:58] Look, look, when you do a play, you pick
[1:44:00] people to fit the part,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; right? So, something was in the mind of
[1:44:08] God before the foundation of the world.
[1:44:11] He knew, I'm going to pick you. I'm
[1:44:13] going to pick you. I'm going to pick
[1:44:15] you. You're exactly what I want to be in
[1:44:20] the end time. and Lady Oia to prove to
[1:44:23] the God of the evil age. You might have
[1:44:25] come into my Eden in the beginning, but
[1:44:27] I sent my pride into Satan's Eden and
[1:44:30] she's going to tear your kingdom down.
[1:44:33] He knew the way you would show up. He
[1:44:35] knew how tall. He knew how short you
[1:44:37] would be. He knew the generational
[1:44:39] curses. He knew the things that you
[1:44:40] would struggle. But he predestinated
[1:44:43] you. He wrote your name on the Lamb's
[1:44:45] book of life. And he said, "Here she is,
[1:44:47] right on time, right on quue.
[1:44:52] Play your part, church. [cheering] Play
[1:44:55] your part. Play it with all [screaming]
[1:44:58] of your heart. With everything that's in
[1:45:00] you, play your part.
[1:45:03] [applause]
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when churches do
[1:45:14] plays,
[1:45:16] you know, they pick different people to
[1:45:18] do parts.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember we did a church
[1:45:24] play one time and [sighs]
[1:45:27] we had a brother in our church named
[1:45:29] Brother Towanda. And I don't know how he
[1:45:31] got the part, but he got to be a palm
[1:45:32] tree.
[1:45:36] And you know, I'm kind of glad I didn't
[1:45:39] get that part. But some people want that
[1:45:42] part. Some people want the part behind
[1:45:44] the curtains.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'll do the sound.
[1:45:49] I'll I'll sew the things together, but I
[1:45:51] ain't getting out on that stage. But
[1:45:53] whatever part you're predestinated to
[1:45:55] play and you know, I I got I got to
[1:45:57] thinking about that when I read that
[1:45:58] quote. It said, "The part you play." I
[1:46:00] started thinking about church plays. And
[1:46:02] I remember thinking about a play that
[1:46:04] was done at Louisiana camp maybe some 25
[1:46:07] years ago or something like that. And I
[1:46:09] got the image in my head because, you
[1:46:10] know, they they picked Brother Eli
[1:46:12] Arbagast. If any of you know your big
[1:46:14] old tall brother, you know, we always
[1:46:16] knew who was playing Goliath. it was
[1:46:17] brother Eli, you know, so they picked
[1:46:19] him and then they picked some brothers,
[1:46:21] you know, to be David and and I was
[1:46:24] laughing about that and then it reminded
[1:46:25] me here not too long ago. I was having
[1:46:27] some fellowship with brother Matt Morris
[1:46:29] and and somehow that came up and he
[1:46:31] goes, "You know what?" He goes, "I was
[1:46:33] the rock
[1:46:35] and I got to and I was in my study and I
[1:46:37] got to think about I started laughing it
[1:46:38] and I sent brother Matt I sent brother
[1:46:41] Matt the the the text. said, "Man, I got
[1:46:44] to think in that play about and about,
[1:46:46] you know, about how how Goliath had to
[1:46:48] play his part and and and and you know,
[1:46:51] David had to play his part and how you
[1:46:53] played the rock." And he text me back
[1:46:55] and said, "Somebody had to do it." I
[1:46:58] tell you what, I actually got a noise
[1:47:00] complaint from the office downstairs
[1:47:01] because I realized, "Hey, somebody got
[1:47:03] to play the part. If I'm going to be the
[1:47:05] rock, I don't care what it is. Let me be
[1:47:06] a rock in his hand. Go ahead and put me
[1:47:09] in your sling, Lord. Throw me at every
[1:47:11] giant, every devil. I'll knock them out.
[1:47:13] I'll knock them down. As long as I'm on
[1:47:16] your hand. I don't care what part I
[1:47:17] play. As long as it's the part that the
[1:47:20] Lord Jesus wants me to play.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Play your part, church. [applause]
[1:47:30] [cheering]
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You don't get all dressed up and
[1:47:33] memorize your lines and rehearse
[1:47:35] everything
[1:47:36] and then it comes time for your part.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Oh no.
[1:47:42] We all go through it. I'm going to
[1:47:44] forget my lines. How many have ever got
[1:47:46] up to sing a song special and my
[1:47:48] goodness, your mind just goes blank.
[1:47:51] Yes,
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we feel like that. We've
[1:47:54] we've gone to church. We've we've had
[1:47:56] the experience and everything and then
[1:47:57] in the moment or whatnot. Don't worry.
[1:47:59] He said, "I'll be with you even in you.
[1:48:01] The conductors right there. If you lose
[1:48:03] your lines here, here's the sheet music.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; I got the sheet music right here.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; If you forgot, just get back. Turn on a
[1:48:11] tape.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; If you forget, get into your Bible. If
[1:48:14] you forget, get into prayer. He's right
[1:48:15] there.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Good time.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Look, dress rehearsal's over.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Time of playing games is over. Ain't
[1:48:29] that right?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; This is time to go home.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, we we are right on the cusp.
[1:48:36] Even brother Donnie shared this morning.
[1:48:38] And I think right now uh the pope made
[1:48:40] some allegiance with with with you know
[1:48:42] the ecumenical council. Everything's
[1:48:43] tightening up. It's all coming together.
[1:48:45] Look, Satan's getting his superman and
[1:48:47] the world and all the ecumenical
[1:48:48] councils and everything's you what it's
[1:48:50] a uniting time and sign. The world's
[1:48:52] uniting. Christianity is re uniting.
[1:48:55] Everything out there's uniting. The
[1:48:56] devil's reuniting. Everything's uniting.
[1:48:58] But oh, glory to God. There is a bride
[1:49:01] and she is uniting under the headship of
[1:49:03] the word, the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:49:06] what are we uniting with? We're uniting
[1:49:08] with the word. [screaming] What are we
[1:49:09] uniting for? The rapture.
[1:49:14] [applause]
[1:49:15] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:18] It's time to play your part.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about that.
[1:49:21] Here stoods David. You know, David had
[1:49:24] to play his part. And here's Goliath
[1:49:26] standing there making his boast. We'll
[1:49:28] try to just bring this towards a close
[1:49:29] by the help of God somehow. So, here's
[1:49:31] here's Goliath. He's making his boast.
[1:49:33] And to think that the armies of the
[1:49:34] living God, they they had forgot who
[1:49:36] they were. They were letting their own
[1:49:37] enemy, the the the the the devil, just
[1:49:40] stand there and defy the armies of the
[1:49:41] living God. But I love what the prophet
[1:49:43] of God said. He said, you know, his
[1:49:44] boast happen to fall on the wrong ears.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. It's time to quit
[1:49:52] listening to that boast. And when he
[1:49:54] starts talking to do something about it,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; oh yeah, you're going to get me. I'm
[1:49:58] going to get you.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And you take the sword of the word. So
[1:50:01] here them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them them
[1:50:02] them them them them them them them that
[1:50:04] challenge came upon David's ears but you
[1:50:07] know what David was predestinated to
[1:50:10] meet the challenge
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; David had the victory before he even
[1:50:18] showed up
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; what about you
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; before you even showed up in Lady Oia
[1:50:28] the playwright was already written
[1:50:31] Your part was already chosen. It was
[1:50:33] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:50:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:50:37] world. You just showed up to manifest
[1:50:39] your part. And you are the victorious
[1:50:42] bride of Jesus Christ. There ain't no
[1:50:44] Goliath. There ain't no devil that can
[1:50:46] stop you. You already had the victory
[1:50:49] when you showed up. Look, that's what
[1:50:50] the prophet of God said about David. He
[1:50:52] already had the victory when he got
[1:50:54] there. So, he didn't come into the
[1:50:55] battle hanging his head. He come into
[1:50:57] that battle dancing and swinging that
[1:50:59] sling. He said, "You come into and defy
[1:51:01] the name of the Lord with your gods and
[1:51:03] the Philistine armies, but I come to you
[1:51:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:51:07] He went dancing right into that battle
[1:51:09] and he had that rock of faith and he
[1:51:11] slung that right out and knocked that
[1:51:12] devil down. [cheering]
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; I said, "What about you?" The prophet of
[1:51:16] God said this, he knowed where he was
[1:51:18] at. Hallelujah. Everyone sitting here,
[1:51:21] you're person you, everyone sitting here
[1:51:24] tonight, you're positionally in Christ.
[1:51:27] God has confirmed it. election, calling,
[1:51:30] anointing, placing.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; He elected you and called you. He
[1:51:35] elected you and called you.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Then he anointed you with the Holy
[1:51:40] Spirit. And now he's placed you in the
[1:51:42] body of Christ. Each one of you is
[1:51:45] David's.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Where's the Goliath? Who's the Goliath,
[1:51:52] Brother Brandham? That cancer that's
[1:51:53] eating you up. That tumor that's hanging
[1:51:55] on you, them cataracts on your eyes,
[1:51:58] that crippled arm, every little thing
[1:52:00] looks at it and says it can't be done.
[1:52:02] The devil says you might as well quit
[1:52:03] believing. You might as well settle down
[1:52:05] because you never can no more get well.
[1:52:07] Your doctor said so. All of the rest of
[1:52:09] them said so. You can't get well. But
[1:52:11] the Christ that made you stop your
[1:52:13] drinking, your smoking, your lying, and
[1:52:16] stealing that saved you from a life of
[1:52:17] drunkenness, from riing, from a sin and
[1:52:19] a devil's grave is if God can do that
[1:52:21] for you, he can save you from your TV.
[1:52:24] He can save you from your cancer. He's
[1:52:26] the Goliath. Don't take his boast. Stand
[1:52:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:52:30] challenge him to a showdown. Amen. I
[1:52:33] feel religious positionally. You are in
[1:52:35] Christ. If the believer knowed his
[1:52:37] position, he'd have it. God's great
[1:52:39] spirit is here. And his Holy Ghost is
[1:52:41] ready to fall on anybody that will
[1:52:42] believe. Do you believe? Do you believe?
[1:52:45] Hey church, play your part. You're
[1:52:47] anointed for the job.
[1:52:50] Hallelujah.
[1:52:52] [applause]
[1:52:59] Yes, sir.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; I'm a winner and you're a loser.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to heaven and you're going to
[1:53:15] hell. Boo devil.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Facts.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Facts.
[1:53:26] predetermined.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; I'm just playing my part.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; So, don't mind me.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; I'm just happy about the part God gave
[1:53:38] me to play.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a palm tree.
[1:53:46] [snorts]
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a sinner.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't call me to be a drunk. He
[1:53:51] didn't call you to be in bondage. He
[1:53:53] didn't call you to lust after those last
[1:53:55] devils. He called you to be an
[1:53:57] overcoming son and daughter of God to
[1:54:00] put every devil and every disease and
[1:54:03] every sickness under your feet. I say,
[1:54:05] "Boo devil. I'm going to play my part
[1:54:08] and I'm going to believe [screaming]
[1:54:10] with all of my heart. I'm not basing it
[1:54:12] upon what I see. I'm not basing upon the
[1:54:14] past and I'm not basing on the future.
[1:54:16] I'm basing it on what he said.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; For my Bible tells me in Romans 8:28,
[1:54:27] "And we know that all things work
[1:54:28] together for the good to them that love
[1:54:30] God, to them who are called according to
[1:54:33] his purpose, for whom he did forno,
[1:54:37] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:54:40] to the image of his son, that he might
[1:54:42] be the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:54:44] Moreover,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; whom he did predestinate
[1:54:49] then he also called. Is anybody hearing
[1:54:51] the call of God?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe you you maybe right now
[1:54:56] you feel like you don't got the Holy
[1:54:57] Ghost and there's no hope for you. But
[1:54:59] do you feel God pulling upon your heart?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; You feel the call of God on your life.
[1:55:03] Listen to this. This is powerful.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; This right here will give you victory.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; You can whoop the devil with this.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Have we forgot
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; how powerful this thing is?
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; It's so powerful. When our Lord was
[1:55:21] here,
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; he used it
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; to whip the devil.
[1:55:27] [applause]
[1:55:31] [applause]
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Well, I come from the same material.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; So then I'll just take the same old
[1:55:40] Bible,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; same word.
[1:55:43] God's called you. If there's a call of
[1:55:45] God upon your life,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; them he's also called.
[1:55:51] Them he's also justified. And them he's
[1:55:54] also Them he's also justified. Them he's
[1:55:57] also glorified.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I told you it's rigged.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; David picking up out of Why Christ
[1:56:06] speak. David would say, "The God that
[1:56:07] delivered me from the lion, the God that
[1:56:09] delivered me from the paws of that bear,
[1:56:11] he'll more than deliver me from that
[1:56:13] Philistine." Now, put whatever it is
[1:56:14] you're battling right there.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; The God that justified me, the God that
[1:56:19] called me, he's the God that'll fill me
[1:56:21] with the Holy Ghost, he'll deliver me
[1:56:23] from that problem, here I come. I meet
[1:56:25] you in the name of the Lord, God of
[1:56:26] Israel. Amen. He prophet of God said he
[1:56:29] didn't pray through. He was already
[1:56:31] prayed through. God prayed him through
[1:56:33] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:56:35] was anointed for the job. He just had to
[1:56:37] speak and go forward. Glory to God. Hey,
[1:56:40] I might have messed up and forgot to
[1:56:41] pray this morning. But praise the name
[1:56:43] of the living God. He already prayed me
[1:56:45] through before the foundation of the
[1:56:46] world. So maybe I didn't dot all my eyes
[1:56:48] and cross all my tees and I walked into
[1:56:50] a problem and maybe I didn't get prayed
[1:56:53] up and I wasn't listening to tape. But
[1:56:54] you know what? It doesn't change that
[1:56:56] I'm a son of God. I can look that devil
[1:56:58] right in the face and say, "You know
[1:56:59] what? I made a misstep. I made a
[1:57:01] mistake. But Jesus Christ prayed me
[1:57:03] through before the foundation of the
[1:57:05] world. And I'll still whip you, devil
[1:57:08] [applause]
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; because the word has never failed in the
[1:57:16] mouths of believing Christians.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said it's here and
[1:57:19] stronger I and greater than it ever was
[1:57:22] in the true word bride.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; He said hold on to that word. Fill your
[1:57:26] heart and your mouth with it. Just going
[1:57:28] to work towards a close quickly.
[1:57:31] We got to do weapons. We got to fight
[1:57:33] with this.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Some some of the some of the greatest
[1:57:36] scriptures uh that have done me the most
[1:57:38] good is my Bible tells me there's
[1:57:40] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:57:42] that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; So then we allow condemnation and we
[1:57:49] allow those things to paralyze us.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I I I did it again.
[1:57:56] I
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; I did it again. I I feel like I can't
[1:57:58] even sing. Second, you know what? All
[1:58:02] have sinned and come short of the glory
[1:58:03] of God.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; And if you made a mistake, then we need
[1:58:08] more of God to overcome it the next
[1:58:09] time.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; You repent and you get up and that
[1:58:12] feeling. Now, there's a difference
[1:58:13] between conviction and condemnation.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; And the devil's pretty sly. He'll try to
[1:58:18] make you mix up the two.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Conviction will lead you to repentance.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Condemnation will hold you in sin.
[1:58:30] Yes, sir, brother.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; You fall to a temptation, I just, you
[1:58:33] know, I'll make it right later. No, be
[1:58:35] quick to repent.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Be zealous to repent. That's the That's
[1:58:40] what should be for the age.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said the the the zealous
[1:58:43] to say, I'm wrong.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Somehow that went out of the maybe went
[1:58:48] out of some of the churches a long time
[1:58:49] ago. They they
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I'm right. Everybody else is wrong. Some
[1:58:53] people, they're so right.
[1:58:57] No, we we need to be quick to repent,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; you know, and if you feel something
[1:59:02] condemning you and and it's it's keeping
[1:59:04] you from the promises of God, it's
[1:59:05] keeping you from wanting to pray. It's
[1:59:07] keeping you from wanting to re, you
[1:59:08] know, you know, you're like, what what
[1:59:11] is it? But but conviction should say, oh
[1:59:12] God, I'm so sorry. It should drive you
[1:59:15] to your knees in repentance.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; There's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:59:21] them that are in Christ Jesus. Blessed
[1:59:22] is the man whom the Lord will not impute
[1:59:24] sin. Oh my, those are promises that
[1:59:27] bring you through hard times and trials
[1:59:30] as you're growing in the stature of a
[1:59:32] perfect man. And brother Bandham said
[1:59:34] this in the invisible union. He said,
[1:59:35] "He, the bridegroom, took away your
[1:59:37] shame."
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Just a few more moments.
[1:59:44] And put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:59:47] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:59:49] and the blood of life. That's what the
[1:59:52] Bible said.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Your first husband that you were married
[1:59:56] to the world,
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; right? We don't have to go into that. We
[1:59:59] We got a picture, right?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Young people, are you seeing that first
[2:00:03] nature that's been warning against you?
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Can you see it better now?
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Why Paul said you got to be married to
[2:00:10] another? That first husband that you
[2:00:12] were married to, the world,
[2:00:15] the anointed bridegroom, which for
[2:00:18] ordained you, has washed you by the
[2:00:21] washing of the water,
[2:00:24] by the church,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; by your good works,
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; by your impeccable
[2:00:31] standing and your impeccable attendance
[2:00:33] to Word of Life Church.
[2:00:37] by your knowledge of the message.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; By how many tapes you've memorized,
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; by how well you've been able to study
[2:00:44] out and explain the Bible.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, are the signs and wonders that
[2:00:51] you've performed or how powerful your
[2:00:53] gift is.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; No, that that no, that don't sound
[2:01:00] right.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Remember, we already went through that
[2:01:02] on Friday. Salvation is of the Lord.
[2:01:06] It's not salvation plus your good works.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; It's not Christ plus. It's Christ alone.
[2:01:12] From start to finish, salvation is of
[2:01:14] the Lord.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; No, that that don't sound right, does
[2:01:22] it? You might find that in the Almanac,
[2:01:24] but it's not in God's Bible. By the
[2:01:26] washing of the water, by the word. In
[2:01:30] the word. And I want to tell you that's
[2:01:32] why God sent a vindicated prophet to
[2:01:35] restore the word and to restore the
[2:01:37] faith back to the original word.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Because without the opening of the
[2:01:44] seals, it's a closed book.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And it's the very revelation of the age,
[2:01:49] the word of our age that's washing you.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Is that all right, brother Donnie?
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; You You can't find it any other place.
[2:02:03] So listen now. He says,
[2:02:05] "You are standing completely justified."
[2:02:09] That's right.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; As though you never did it at the
[2:02:12] beginning. Now I just asked the
[2:02:14] musicians to come to help me bring this
[2:02:16] towards a close.
[2:02:19] [snorts]
[2:02:20] I I I enjoyed that song, I've been
[2:02:22] changed. I believe it's even in the
[2:02:24] lyrics says no more shame. But think
[2:02:26] about this.
[2:02:31] I say, "What a what what a message. What
[2:02:34] a word."
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; That could take a sinner.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; And pluck them out of the muck and mire
[2:02:41] and not only wash them up and and
[2:02:43] cleanse them up, but by the revelation
[2:02:46] of it, not a partial revelation under
[2:02:48] Luther. No, this is the full revelation
[2:02:51] of justification,
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; which means you never did it in the
[2:02:56] first place.
[2:02:58] That ought to set somebody free here
[2:03:00] this morning.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; The devil's been trying to make you feel
[2:03:02] guilty. He's been trying to put
[2:03:04] condemnation on you. Maybe you feel like
[2:03:06] you lost your virtue and no one's ever
[2:03:08] going to love you right and you'll never
[2:03:09] be able to uh uh fit. And the devil's
[2:03:11] trying to rub your nose and all of your
[2:03:13] past and all your failures and all your
[2:03:16] mistakes. But if you're hearing the call
[2:03:17] of God, God is God is calling to you.
[2:03:20] And right now by the full revelation of
[2:03:23] justification, a vindicated prophet is
[2:03:25] telling you that you are the pure,
[2:03:29] virtuous, sinless bride of the son of
[2:03:32] the living God. Every man and woman
[2:03:35] that's born of the spirit of God and
[2:03:37] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[2:03:39] believes every word stands as though you
[2:03:41] never sinned at the first place. You are
[2:03:44] perfect. Oh, praise the wonderful name
[2:03:48] of the living God. It doesn't matter
[2:03:50] about my past. It doesn't matter about
[2:03:52] my sin. It doesn't matter about what
[2:03:53] that spooky spirit has tried to tell me.
[2:03:56] God has syndicate a vindicated word, a
[2:03:59] vindicated message to tell me you are
[2:04:02] perfect.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in perfect faith said
[2:04:08] then the only thing you have to do is
[2:04:09] believe what you are.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Have faith in what you are.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you
[2:04:16] are.
[2:04:18] Play your part.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Have faith in what the word says you
[2:04:22] are.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; You are standing completely justified as
[2:04:25] though you never did it in the first
[2:04:27] place.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Now, just picking this up out of Christ,
[2:04:32] the mystery of God revealed.
[2:04:35] Justified in his sight. Why are we
[2:04:37] justified?
[2:04:39] We are his victory.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; I'm the proof. Amen.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; I'm the evidence
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; justified. Why are why are we justified?
[2:04:50] We are his victory. The church is his
[2:04:52] victory. We come forth in the last days
[2:04:54] with the glorious gospel showing his
[2:04:56] victory. He died for this purpose. And
[2:04:58] we are proof of his victory. Amen. And
[2:05:01] when we see him coming down and living
[2:05:02] among the church, that's his victories
[2:05:05] shows that they couldn't keep him in the
[2:05:07] grave. Neither can they keep us. That's
[2:05:08] right. We're bound, right? And we're
[2:05:10] already potentially arised because we've
[2:05:12] raised from the dead unbelief in his
[2:05:14] word from denominations and creeds to an
[2:05:16] eternal word of the eternal God which is
[2:05:19] himself working through us manifesting
[2:05:22] himself that he is the same yesterday,
[2:05:24] today and forever. [screaming] You are
[2:05:27] his victory. You are the proof of his
[2:05:30] resurrection. You are the very proof of
[2:05:32] the message of the hour. Where is the
[2:05:34] Welsh revival? Where is the bride
[2:05:37] revival? I am the bride. Where is the
[2:05:40] message of the hour? I am the message of
[2:05:43] the hour. I am the proof of Malachi 4:5.
[2:05:47] I am the proof of Revelations 10 1-7.
[2:05:51] Why? Because I'm the very spoken word
[2:05:53] that has taken on flesh in the evening
[2:05:56] time. I am the evidence.
[2:06:00] [applause]
[2:06:01] Hallelujah. Why don't you praise God?
[2:06:04] Praise God for the evidence. Praise God
[2:06:07] for the Holy Ghost. Praise God for the
[2:06:09] message. [applause]
[2:06:16] He sent back the evidence, the Holy
[2:06:18] Ghost, and I got it.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; We know that song.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I feel pretty good.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know what I used to be.
[2:06:38] But then I heard a message.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; It's not where you belong.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; It's not what you're here for.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; You're not here for a career.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; You're not here for some job.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; because God thought of you
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; And he loved you. And he thought of you
[2:07:02] and he said, "You know what?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I want to have a bride.
[2:07:07] And I'm going to I'm going to place her
[2:07:09] right at the very climax of my great
[2:07:13] play and great drama.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, they played their part out
[2:07:17] in the beginning and on down through the
[2:07:19] patriarchs of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[2:07:22] and on down through Elijah and Elisha
[2:07:24] and David and all the judges. And they
[2:07:26] all played all the way down to John the
[2:07:28] Baptist. And here come the word made
[2:07:29] flesh himself.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And he played his part as far as a
[2:07:34] redeemer. and he he laid his life down
[2:07:36] with us and then he sent the evidence
[2:07:39] back.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that it's no longer
[2:07:44] it's I that liveth in you, you and me
[2:07:47] and I in you.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; You were made for more.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Some of us, you just need to walk away
[2:07:59] from that prison house you've been in.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; The rat race of Lady Oia. Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And the intellectual
[2:08:08] exercise of trying to make the message
[2:08:10] work,
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; it'll drive you mad.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; It'll drive you insane.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; And there's there's plenty of casualties
[2:08:17] of people who have tried to make all the
[2:08:20] quotes fit together. You can't do it.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You got to say, "Lord, I believe it."
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Walk away from the unbelief.
[2:08:29] Just call out to the name of the Lord.
[2:08:30] Say, Lord, I want the Holy Ghost to
[2:08:32] energize my soul
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; that I can play my part.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. I've been
[2:08:37] changed.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I've been changed [singing]
[2:08:46] here
[2:08:50] [music] free. [singing]
[2:08:54] Delivered.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; I found joy, [singing]
[2:09:02] peace, [music]
[2:09:06] grace,
[2:09:08] [singing]
[2:09:09] and [music] favor.
[2:09:13] I've been changed, [singing]
[2:09:17] [music] healed,
[2:09:22] free,
[2:09:23] [singing and music]
[2:09:25] delivered.
[2:09:28] I [music and singing] found joy,
[2:09:33] peace, [music]
[2:09:34] [singing]
[2:09:37] grace,
[2:09:41] and [music] favor.
[2:09:43] Oh, and [singing] right now,
[2:09:46] right now is the [music] moment.
[2:09:50] Today [singing]
[2:09:51] is the day. Oh, hallelujah. You've been
[2:09:54] changed.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; I say in an atmosphere like this, you
[2:09:57] can be changed. change.
[2:09:59] [singing]
[2:10:01] And I've waited for this moment
[2:10:05] [music and singing] to come. And I won't
[2:10:08] let it pass me [music] by.
[2:10:15] I won't [music] go back. They go back to
[2:10:20] the way it used to [music and singing]
[2:10:22] be before your presence came and changed

[3:04:30] Yeah. I'm going up yonder.
[3:04:36] I'm [music] going up yonder
[3:04:40] to be with my Lord.
[3:04:46] [music]
[3:04:46] Now I can take the pain,
[3:04:51] the heartache that life it surely
[3:04:54] [music] brings.
[3:04:56] I have comfort [singing] in knowing one
[3:04:59] day I'm going to put on my wings and
[3:05:02] [music] fly away. [singing]
[3:05:06] God is going to [music]
[3:05:08] give me the grace that I need to run to
[3:05:13] fight and stay in [music] this race. And
[3:05:16] by the word of God I've been promised
[3:05:20] I'll see him with my own eyes. [singing]
[3:05:26] I'm going in the rapture.
[3:05:31] I'm going [music] in the rapture.
[3:05:33] [singing]
[3:05:36] I'm going [music] in the rapture.
[3:05:40] Goodbye by
[3:05:43] world.
[3:05:44] [music]
[3:05:46] I'm going in the rapture.
[3:05:51] I'm [music] going in the right show.
[3:05:56] I'm going in the right
[3:06:00] to keep [music] it.

[3:06:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause]
[3:06:49] Hallelujah.
[3:06:54] We got a couple of prayer requests here.
[3:06:56] Please pray for Wanda Batman. She's in
[3:06:59] the ER with severe pain. Also, please
[3:07:03] pray for Josh and Megan Collins son
[3:07:05] Dawson. They ordered an echo tomorrow on
[3:07:10] his heart to check for any
[3:07:12] abnormalities.
[3:07:14] Every time you come off of seat pad, he
[3:07:16] struggles.
[3:07:18] Now, we believe the power of God that
[3:07:20] we've been feeling here ain't just good
[3:07:22] to make us feel good.
[3:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's not here just to stir our emotions.
[3:07:26] And it does stir our emotions.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; But we believe he ministers to the needy
[3:07:32] today.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; Can we pray together right now? And
[3:07:37] &gt;&gt; maybe somebody else didn't get
[3:07:38] personally ministered to today and you
[3:07:40] have a need. Just say, "Lord, be mindful
[3:07:42] of me. Would you?
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[3:07:49] wonderful time that we've had together,
[3:07:53] this visitation, Lord, of your presence
[3:07:55] here today.
[3:07:57] We thank you for these youth meetings.
[3:07:59] And we realize, Lord, it just wasn't for
[3:08:02] the youth, but we believe it's for all
[3:08:05] of us. Lord, you see, Lord Jesus, these
[3:08:08] needs that we've read. And Father, we're
[3:08:11] praying today that you'd move our sister
[3:08:13] Wanda Bman. You see the pain that she's
[3:08:15] dealing with and you know the cause of
[3:08:17] it. Lord, we pray, Father, for Dawson
[3:08:20] Collins and we're asking for your mercy
[3:08:23] for him. Dear Jesus, may your hand be
[3:08:26] extended, Lord. I know it's hundreds of
[3:08:29] miles away from us. They're in Ohio. But
[3:08:32] we know, dear God, there's no distance
[3:08:34] to you.
[3:08:36] Father, every individual here today that
[3:08:40] has a need in their home, their life,
[3:08:42] their family, would you move for them,
[3:08:44] Jesus? We pray that you'd restore our
[3:08:46] brother Matt's strength. Lord, we thank
[3:08:49] you, Father, for using him today to be a
[3:08:52] blessing to us Friday, yesterday as
[3:08:55] well. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus. We
[3:08:59] believe that we are living testimonies
[3:09:02] that Calvary was a success.
[3:09:07] &gt;&gt; May you go with us now, Lord. The food
[3:09:09] that's been prepared, may you bless it,
[3:09:11] nourish it our bodies. We ask, Lord God,
[3:09:14] in the name of Jesus.
[3:09:17] How many can say it's been really good
[3:09:21] to be in the house of the Lord?
[3:09:23] [applause]
[3:09:25] Praise the Lord.
[3:09:28] Hallelujah.
[3:09:31] God bless you. Thank you, brother Matt.
[3:09:33] God bless you. May God restore his
[3:09:36] strength. And you keep this in mind as
[3:09:37] you go today. Maybe you're a little bit
[3:09:40] weary, a little bit down. You've been
[3:09:42] through a lot of things and may have had
[3:09:43] mistakes and failures, but keep this in
[3:09:46] mind in the coming days, will you? Your
[3:09:49] name
[3:09:51] is already there. Amen.
[3:09:55] &gt;&gt; So your name
[3:09:57] &gt;&gt; is waiting on you
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; to get there.
[3:10:03] &gt;&gt; And God don't make no mistakes.
[3:10:07] [applause]
[3:10:08] Your name is there.
[3:10:14] Amen. [applause]
