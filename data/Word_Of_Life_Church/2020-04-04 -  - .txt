TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a few weeks ago brother down imaged mention Enoch and he knocks walk as he was walking and nearing the end of the finishing his pyramid in his journey on the earth and how he must have thought and I this song has kind of been on my heart since then I want to have it Enoch testimony his testimony was that he walked with God and he pleased God through all of this may we all draw closer there is a way you can't escape the daily rush of thing this prayers the pain the stress and strain this unkind world can bring from the push and shove of noisy crowded streets with heartaches pain to the gentleness of heavens bless it's time to get away and what you need is a quiet walk with God for EMU from all your doubts and fearful thought [Music] his faith can lead you down this path you've made every truck and what you need a quiet walk with God for someone else the breaking point may not seem so near oh but all your broken promises tell you your time is near those ghosts of killed keep haunting you till your conscience screams out loud but then that still small voice says come with me away from all this crime chara what you need is is a quiet walk with God far removed from all your doubts and fearful Thor his faith will leave eat you down this path you've named ever try and what you need is a quiet walk with God you need a quiet walk with God [Music]
