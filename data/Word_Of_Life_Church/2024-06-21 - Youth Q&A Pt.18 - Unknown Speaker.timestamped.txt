[20:13] Donnie I'm so grateful that we know him
[20:16] that way
[20:18] today what a terrible thing it' be
[20:21] to serve a God that was one out of stone
[20:27] or wood or paper mâché
[20:30] or
[20:32] ceramic you imagine making your own
[20:35] God so you decide I'm going to make
[20:38] myself a God so I'm going to shape him
[20:40] and mold him and you go to all that
[20:44] work and you get ready to set it
[20:47] up and you drop him and break him all to
[20:53] pieces wow that would make you cry
[20:55] wouldn't it you imagine there's people
[20:58] who who give their lives to things just
[21:01] as stupid is what I said things that's
[21:03] not real things that's not true things
[21:06] it's not lasting we're blessed to have a
[21:10] desire to hunger for the Living God
[21:12] aren't
[21:13] we well we greet you tonight miss doing
[21:16] this it's been been several several
[21:18] weeks hasn't it brothers were you able
[21:21] to rescue those things for us all right
[21:23] praise the Lord another electronic
[21:26] glitch but hopefully the brothers got it
[21:30] all right let us start with this
[21:31] question
[21:32] tonight since this end time
[21:36] church is to be like the first church in
[21:40] Acts why don't we own all things
[21:46] commonly as described in Acts
[21:50] 4
[21:51] 32 to
[21:53] 37 now whoever asked me this I want you
[21:56] to meet me in my office after church CU
[21:57] I'm going work you out no I'm only
[22:01] teasing it's a good question good
[22:03] question and we'll read this scripture
[22:06] to go along with this not the one that
[22:09] they quoted we'll go to that one but
[22:12] Matthew chap
[22:14] 26:1 the Lord Jesus
[22:17] speaking for you have the
[22:20] poor with
[22:23] you how
[22:25] long how
[22:27] long for you have the poor always with
[22:31] you but me you have not always let's
[22:36] pray together now with the word and ask
[22:38] the Lord to help us father we thank you
[22:40] for this time that we could gather
[22:43] together I've so enjoyed these questions
[22:46] and I I appreciate these young people
[22:47] submitting them Lord things that's on
[22:49] their hearts and I already know from
[22:53] emails and texts and whatsapps and all
[22:56] kinds of things that I've received from
[22:57] people around the world that so many
[22:59] people have been blessed and got answers
[23:02] to things that that they pondered about
[23:05] for years and years and it was all
[23:07] because a young person here had
[23:09] something on their heart so it goes to
[23:12] show that you can take something that
[23:15] just we think we're the only one maybe
[23:17] that ever had such a question and we
[23:20] come to find out there's many many poor
[23:22] in the same way so it helps us to
[23:24] realize that really we're more alike
[23:27] than we are different
[23:29] I pray that you'd help me tonight Lord
[23:30] that I'd be able to answer these things
[23:32] correctly shut my mouth to anything that
[23:34] would be wrong or displease you in the
[23:37] name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless
[23:40] you you may be
[23:44] seated actually this is part of um
[23:48] though you may not know it this is one
[23:51] of the things that communism they try to
[23:55] take these couple of places in the book
[23:57] of Acts and say that
[24:00] communism actually had a religious
[24:03] Foundation because that's where the word
[24:06] communism comes from so that everybody
[24:09] had everything in common but um since
[24:14] the Lord Jesus said that we would always
[24:18] have the poor with us that leads me to
[24:21] believe that he know that this the way
[24:25] that they started it here in the book of
[24:27] Acts would not continue and that it
[24:30] would not work
[24:33] worldwide now I want to I want you to um
[24:37] think in your hearts now as we look at
[24:39] this before we get to the scripture that
[24:42] neither the Lord Jesus nor the apostles
[24:46] taught this as a
[24:49] Doctrine so there's no teachings in the
[24:52] teachings of Jesus or no teachings in
[24:55] the book of Acts where Paul Peter John
[24:58] James and the rest of the apostolic
[25:00] Elders taught this and said now look
[25:03] this is what we need to do this is the
[25:06] word of God and this is the way that we
[25:08] need to go about doing it and it it
[25:11] worked for a while Acts chapter 2 verse
[25:15] 44 and all that believed were
[25:19] together here's a very important word
[25:22] all that believed were together I want
[25:26] you to notice where this is happening
[25:28] Jerusalem so the gospel has not moved to
[25:31] Babylon the gospel has not moved to
[25:34] Syria the gospel has not moved to the
[25:37] other parts of the earth yet it's pretty
[25:40] much gathered right there in Jerusalem
[25:43] in Galilee so Luke wrote this and he
[25:47] said all that believed were together and
[25:50] had all things common but listen how the
[25:53] next verse here says it and sold their
[25:56] possessions and goods
[25:58] and parted them to all men but that
[26:02] don't mean it quite the way the English
[26:05] translates it listen to these last few
[26:08] words which are the key wordss as every
[26:11] man had need so that don't mean you had
[26:14] a cow you had a horse you had a donkey
[26:17] you had a chicken you had a pig you had
[26:18] a you know whatever you had and we all
[26:21] sold it and we just divided it so we got
[26:24] a sum total of $
[26:26] 26,39 38 5 cents so how many ever there
[26:30] are here we'll take that and divide it
[26:32] into it and we all got the same amount
[26:34] that's not what the Bible even says but
[26:37] the Bible says that as every man had
[26:42] need so there were rich people there in
[26:45] the book of Acts and look in verse 46
[26:47] and they continually continuing daily
[26:50] with one Accord in the temple and
[26:52] breaking bread from house to house and
[26:54] did eat their meat with gladness and
[26:57] singleness of heart
[26:58] in Acts chap 4 again verse 34 neither
[27:04] was there any among them that lacked for
[27:07] as many as were possessors of lands or
[27:11] listen now lands as in
[27:15] plural
[27:17] houses as in plural so it's not that
[27:21] they sold our house their trailer you
[27:24] know their Bungalow whatever it was they
[27:26] had and moved out
[27:28] and everybody moved into tents but these
[27:31] were people that had multiple houses
[27:34] multiple lands multiple possessions so
[27:38] there was the extreme poor and the
[27:40] extreme rich and some of them Rich folks
[27:42] actually got saved for many as were
[27:45] possessors of lands or houses sold them
[27:48] and brought the prices of the things
[27:50] that were sold and laid them down at the
[27:52] apostles feet and remember in Jerusalem
[27:55] all around the world and distribution
[27:58] was made unto every
[28:00] man not you get 75 you get 75 you get 75
[28:04] you get 75 you get 75 but
[28:08] according as he had
[28:11] need and josei who was by the apostles
[28:15] was surnamed Barnabas which is being
[28:18] interpreted the son of
[28:22] consolation levite and of the country of
[28:26] Cyprus now it's amazing amazing to me
[28:28] because the fact that Luke mentions
[28:31] Josie or Barnabas in particular shows
[28:35] that it was by no means a universal
[28:39] practice among all the Believers or why
[28:41] would you just mention this one guy if
[28:44] it was something common would you say
[28:46] well we all went to church and we was
[28:48] all baptized and we all sang and we all
[28:51] but this guy was outstanding why because
[28:54] it was not a commandment and they said
[28:56] artman you get saved you got to sell
[28:58] your house you get saved you got to sell
[29:00] your horse you got to sell your cow and
[29:03] then you're going to give it all to the
[29:05] apostles and they're going to divide it
[29:07] so Josie who was by the apostles name
[29:10] Barnabas this name was given to him
[29:13] because of his character I love the
[29:15] meaning of this name and it means the
[29:18] son of consolation wouldn't that be
[29:21] awesome to be identified and known among
[29:23] the people of God and it wasn't the Lord
[29:25] that called him that but it was the
[29:27] people that called him that and they
[29:30] said that he was a son of consolation
[29:33] which means that he consoled God's
[29:36] people he was a rich man he was a
[29:38] merchant before he gave his heart to God
[29:40] so he had excess of a lot of properties
[29:43] a lot of different things that he had
[29:45] and he took it upon himself this is what
[29:48] makes this so outstanding the word did
[29:51] not demand that they do this because
[29:55] this is the Apostolic Church which is
[29:57] why the person asked as this question no
[29:59] doubt thinking well if we're going to go
[30:01] back to that original church then won't
[30:03] every one of us have to do what they
[30:06] done we would if it was the word
[30:09] absolutely there are people in our
[30:12] church let me tell you that do above and
[30:16] beyond above and Way Beyond what is
[30:21] required of them to do as far as some
[30:24] financially others it's just helping
[30:27] around the church and they're constantly
[30:29] asking is there anything I could do is
[30:31] there anything that I could do to help
[30:33] because people want to help and we think
[30:35] the only way that we can give is by
[30:37] money oh no there's many more things
[30:40] that we can do that can be such a help
[30:43] to the body but this man was so
[30:45] outstanding now if this was the common
[30:48] practice then you'd think they' called
[30:50] everybody a son or a daughter of
[30:54] consolation so what was really required
[30:57] was tith
[30:58] and offerings but many of these people
[31:02] were giving so far above all of that
[31:06] having land sold it and brought the
[31:09] money and laid it at the apostles feet
[31:13] but now remember this was an experiment
[31:16] and it was very
[31:18] short-lived it was not undertaken on the
[31:20] basis of the teaching of the Lord Jesus
[31:23] or the apostles and it was an experiment
[31:27] that did not last it was temporary cuz
[31:31] later we find out that Paul had to take
[31:35] up offerings in different countries
[31:38] where he was and send them back to the
[31:41] church at Jerusalem because there was
[31:44] such hard times in Jerusalem and they
[31:47] brought in money from the Gentiles Titus
[31:50] actually came with him and they brought
[31:52] back in so it proves by the very Bible
[31:55] itself that this only last for a little
[31:58] short span of time you can find that in
[32:01] Acts 5:4 so today if the church started
[32:04] doing that can you imagine how many
[32:07] people we'd have in our church if people
[32:10] started hearing hey you know what they
[32:13] tell me them people s at everything
[32:14] they're God and they're giving money
[32:16] away that'd be drunks Liars horn mongers
[32:20] thieves Renegades everybody in the world
[32:24] coming to get saved no to get free money
[32:28] honey they're not coming to get saved
[32:30] they don't want the Holy Ghost they
[32:31] don't want what we preach they got their
[32:33] hand out we have enough of that the way
[32:36] it is so if this would have been a
[32:38] teaching based in the scripture there
[32:41] would have been scriptures for it and
[32:43] truly the apostles would have never let
[32:45] it fall to the ground and stop had they
[32:49] been given direct commands from the
[32:53] Lord that help you understand that all
[32:56] right we'll go to the next one
[32:58] why do we call it
[33:00] communion when we partake of the bread
[33:05] and the wine why do we call it communion
[33:09] another good question 1 Corinthians
[33:11] chapter 10: 16 the cup of blessing which
[33:16] we bless is it
[33:18] not the
[33:21] communion of the blood of
[33:23] Christ so Paul is actually the one who
[33:26] called it commun
[33:28] look at what the word means it's a
[33:30] beautiful word here used all through the
[33:32] New Testament coia Fellowship to
[33:35] communicate Fellowship joint
[33:38] participation the share which one has in
[33:42] anything so Paul says the cup of
[33:44] blessing which we bless is it not the
[33:47] communion of the blood of Christ so in
[33:49] symbol whenever we take that little cup
[33:51] and press it to our lips it's like that
[33:53] we are joining in not only with the Lord
[33:56] Jesus but with the rest of our brothers
[33:58] and sisters and then he brings the same
[34:00] thing to the bread the bread which we
[34:03] break is it not the communion of the
[34:08] body of Christ so the Lord's Supper is
[34:12] rightly called communion because it
[34:14] helps us to experience that Unity with
[34:17] the Lord Jesus and that Unity with one
[34:21] another another good question how do we
[34:24] know when a
[34:25] preacher is working the the people
[34:29] up or if he is teaching
[34:33] praise under the anointing of the Holy
[34:37] Spirit I about shouted when I got this
[34:40] one I thought it was just a very good
[34:42] question now listen carefully again how
[34:45] do we know when a preacher is working
[34:48] the people up or if he is teaching
[34:52] praise under the anointing of the Holy
[34:56] Spirit now there's a great contrast
[35:00] between the parts in this question
[35:02] because trying to work people up is one
[35:05] thing trying to teach people to worship
[35:08] is something else let me read this to
[35:11] you on that day on Calvary forgive me my
[35:13] Pentecostal friends I am Pentecostal but
[35:17] by my Pentecostal friends has got to a
[35:21] spot to where there has to be a lot of
[35:23] fast music and beating of some bands or
[35:26] clapping hands or
[35:29] tambourines to bring up a shout that's
[35:34] only emotions now when a preacher or a
[35:38] song leader or a youth song leader or
[35:41] any of us would do it that way for the
[35:46] purpose of only arousing people's
[35:49] emotions that certainly is wrong for us
[35:51] to do that but do most of us need
[35:55] encouragement when it comes to worship
[35:58] most of us do I don't know why I don't
[36:01] understand it I don't understand why
[36:02] that a lot of church people have to be
[36:05] encourag to praise the Lord but I want
[36:09] you to notice now how that brother bam
[36:10] deals with this and I I find it amazing
[36:13] because of the the the quotes that you
[36:16] hear mainly quoted around the message
[36:18] are those that appear to be and seem to
[36:21] be anti- emotion and it makes me wonder
[36:25] if some of the brothers who preach
[36:27] against that if they've ever looked at
[36:29] the other side of those quotes that very
[36:33] same word which I just went through
[36:35] yesterday and looked at every quote
[36:38] where he says the word emotions and I
[36:41] found it amazing brother Daryl how many
[36:43] times that brother brandham was
[36:45] encouraging emotion and I thought wonder
[36:48] why we don't hear that red very often
[36:51] wonder why preachers Don't Preach that
[36:53] part as well but you remember that
[36:56] brother random is is preaching
[36:58] to a lot of Pentecostals and most of you
[37:01] were never in Pentecost how many of
[37:02] y'all was in
[37:03] Pentecost brother Daryl the only one
[37:06] okay so most of you whenever you would
[37:08] hear things about Pentecost you have no
[37:11] clue what it's like you don't have a
[37:13] clue what it's like for my brother Harry
[37:17] to struggle for years after it come out
[37:20] of Pentecost coming into the message it
[37:24] was years before Harry ever got the the
[37:27] Liberty to be able to play the organ the
[37:31] way he does
[37:33] now probably doesn't make any sense to
[37:35] you does it but because he felt like he
[37:40] prostituted his gift to
[37:44] emotion now when you've done that and
[37:47] I've done the same so you give your gift
[37:50] you give your ability for the purpose of
[37:52] working people up and getting it going
[37:55] and faster and faster and then when you
[37:57] come to the real truth of it and you
[37:59] realize what you've done it just pulls
[38:02] you back in a shell and you you just
[38:05] don't know how much to release how much
[38:08] to hold back and I've encouraged Harry
[38:11] and I've done it for several years use
[38:14] what God's give you but it's been such a
[38:17] challenge now you see some of the
[38:18] musicians brother Larry Elliott same way
[38:20] some of the musicians that the only
[38:22] thing they've ever played in in the has
[38:24] been in the message they don't know that
[38:26] feeling you don't know what that does
[38:29] because the musicians would have a great
[38:32] part to play in the amount of emotion in
[38:35] a tent meeting in a church
[38:45] meeting participator in it and actually
[38:48] motivating people emotionally as I did
[38:51] as a Pentecostal preacher it's very very
[38:54] hard because you've walked under that
[38:56] and you see how easy you can manipulate
[39:00] people but that does not
[39:03] mean that the real emotion should not be
[39:06] experienced by us all so what are we
[39:08] going to do we're going to let the
[39:09] Scarecrow scare us I thought scarecrow
[39:12] scared crows not Eagles so it took me a
[39:16] long time cuz I went from the
[39:18] Pentecostal ditch I got out of that
[39:20] ditch and I went into the message ditch
[39:24] and I went for years I went one time it
[39:27] was probably 9 10 11 months after I come
[39:31] to the message God hadn't spoke to me
[39:33] one word I was worried I was concerned
[39:37] and I went to him one day in prayer and
[39:39] I said Lord have I done something
[39:45] wrong why don't
[39:55] you he spoke to me all right
[39:58] and he said because you won't let
[40:02] me you have let these preachers tell you
[40:06] I don't speak to people no
[40:10] more I repented I cried I asked God to
[40:15] forgive me you know what I done I went
[40:18] from that Pentecostal ditch over to this
[40:20] ditch over here I got tired of living in
[40:24] ditches I don't mind telling you ever
[40:27] since them I've been searching for the
[40:29] middle of the road and granted I don't
[40:31] know of one preacher that preaches that
[40:33] don't think he's not in the middle you
[40:35] ever heard a preacher stand up and say
[40:37] now I'm a ditch preacher I live in the
[40:39] ditch I eat in the ditch I sleep in the
[40:41] ditch I study in the ditch actually I'm
[40:43] going to try to deceive you all tonight
[40:45] I know I'm in error and I'm going to
[40:47] lead you all in error I'm just warning
[40:49] you before I do it you ever hear any
[40:51] preacher do that every one of them think
[40:53] they got the truth don't they and they
[40:54] think their view is the most B balanced
[40:57] view in the message that's why they give
[41:00] it the way that they
[41:01] do so whenever we think about being
[41:05] moved in that direction listen again he
[41:07] says the Pentecostal church is in a
[41:10] leodan condition they still jump and
[41:14] holler and carry on when the music is
[41:19] beating when the music stops beating or
[41:22] the beatnick music some of them play and
[41:25] call it Christianity whenever that stops
[41:30] all the glory is gone now I've seen that
[41:33] over and over again when the music is
[41:36] going people will be shouting and
[41:38] running and they'd be hollering and all
[41:41] the stuff would' be going on when you
[41:42] come to an end I went the shout that
[41:45] went everything the emotion they're just
[41:47] totally totally gone you think wow I
[41:50] mean it bothered me even whenever I was
[41:51] in Pentecost that's why you'd want to
[41:53] keep it going because you knew if you
[41:55] didn't keep it going they're going to
[41:56] turn the FAL it off but I never realized
[41:59] why because we were using our gift to be
[42:04] able to nurture and to be able to make
[42:06] their emotions react just like they do
[42:08] at a rock and roll concert people go in
[42:11] there you've seen pictures of it
[42:13] hopefully none of y'all ain't never been
[42:14] there I ain't never either but you've
[42:16] seen what they do they go crazy they go
[42:19] absolutely crazy Carol and I a few years
[42:22] ago was at the Kentucky Horse Park up in
[42:24] Lexington Kentucky any yall ever been
[42:26] there
[42:28] it's be beautiful very beautiful place
[42:30] we just happened to hit it whenever they
[42:32] was having an Arabian uh Horse Show
[42:36] there was Arabians there from Egypt from
[42:39] cter from all over the world no telling
[42:42] what those horses were worth I love
[42:45] watching them they're absolutely
[42:47] beautiful but what I found amazing was
[42:50] when they would get these horses out
[42:52] there maybe worth a quarter of a million
[42:53] dollars half a million dollars and
[42:55] they'd bring them out and whenever
[42:57] they'd get out there they would start
[42:59] playing certain music with certain beats
[43:04] now if they wanted that horse to do just
[43:07] a high stepping rack then they would do
[43:10] a certain beat of music but whenever
[43:12] they open that horse wide open and that
[43:15] rider was scooted back on there they
[43:17] used four rains like it's it's just
[43:20] amazing to watch him they would always
[43:22] turn on Fast rock and roll type music
[43:27] music and you would watch them horses as
[43:30] they would change their caner and they
[43:32] would change the step they were in and
[43:35] as soon as that music went from that
[43:37] slow beat to that fast them horses would
[43:42] get right with it and they would start
[43:44] bringing their feet up like this Higher
[43:46] and Higher and I thought my goodness
[43:48] even me Carol talked about it as we sat
[43:51] there and we saw one after another after
[43:54] another because there's something about
[43:56] that music music and it even pull them
[43:59] horses into that and as soon as they
[44:01] would stop that music them horses would
[44:04] stop just like
[44:05] that so whenever we go to use in music
[44:08] or we go to use in anything of course it
[44:10] tries to get us into something that only
[44:13] moves our emotions then that's what the
[44:15] prophet was striking he was not
[44:17] preaching that we as a message people
[44:20] are supposed to sit in church never clap
[44:23] our hands never say praise the Lord
[44:25] never worship God sure I believe in
[44:28] dancing let's shout let's worship god
[44:31] let's praise the Lord but he said don't
[44:33] jump no higher than what you live so if
[44:35] you live this high jump that high
[44:37] brother if you live that high don't jump
[44:39] this High cuz everybody else is going to
[44:41] feel they they something ain't exactly
[44:43] right you know what I'm talking about
[44:45] now watch he said they jump and holler
[44:47] and carry on when the music is is
[44:48] beating when the music stops beating or
[44:50] the beatnick music if some of them play
[44:52] and call it Christianity whenever that
[44:54] stops all the glory of God is gone if
[44:57] it's a real praise of God there isn't
[45:01] enough whistles enough power in the
[45:03] world to stop it when it really comes
[45:05] from God it don't take music to beat it
[45:09] up it takes the spirit of God to come
[45:12] down on it and that's what does it now
[45:16] do we need encouragement yeah I'll tell
[45:18] you sometimes a song leader has a tough
[45:20] job cuz we come in here some of you
[45:23] especially on Wednesday nights you've
[45:25] worked and you come in you're tired you
[45:27] got this on your mind that on your mind
[45:29] the song leader has to try to pull
[45:31] everybody together you realize why
[45:33] they're doing that they're doing that so
[45:35] when the preacher walks out everybody
[45:37] hopefully will be in a better frame of
[45:39] mind than they were 20 minutes prior to
[45:41] that so they're trying to get everybody
[45:43] in the spirit now brother brandom went
[45:46] and preached at a church out in Phoenix
[45:49] and the brother's name was brother
[45:50] Outlaw now they're a Spanish church and
[45:54] I heard it years and years ago but the
[45:56] voice of God's kind of redone some of
[45:58] the tape things and I couldn't find it
[46:00] because I was going to play it for you
[46:02] tonight and uh the young brother that
[46:06] led the singing was brother Outlaw's son
[46:09] so he was the pastor's son his name was
[46:11] Jimmy brother I'm is going to refer to
[46:13] it you talking about singing I mean them
[46:17] folks sang they worshiped they hatered
[46:21] they screamed brother Brandon bragged on
[46:23] it and bragged on it he said that they
[46:26] had a Rec recording of them singing it
[46:29] and he said every time he would go in
[46:31] the office his office back at home in
[46:33] Jeffersonville Billy Paul would have
[46:35] that that that recording going so if
[46:38] brother Brandon was against that either
[46:41] one of two things he was a
[46:46] hypocrite or we've only took the quotes
[46:49] we
[46:50] want and you know why people do that I'm
[46:53] convinced a lot of the preachers that
[46:55] constantly do that I mentioned it last
[46:57] night they've never had a Pentecostal
[47:00] experience they come to this message and
[47:03] they cried a little bit or whatever and
[47:06] they say oh praise the Lord I got it I
[47:08] got it I don't need that old Pentecostal
[47:10] stuff why why don't we need it it's the
[47:14] original blessing of
[47:16] God now he's at he's there at U at
[47:21] brother Outlaws Church in Phoenix good
[47:22] evening friends a privilege to be here
[47:25] tonight and
[47:27] enjoying this
[47:30] wonderful
[47:32] musical
[47:35] Feast wow wonderful musical
[47:41] Feast I want you to listen now how he
[47:43] goes on to say enjoying these songs when
[47:46] they're sang with real
[47:53] enthusiasm enthusiasm so would that be
[47:56] considered considered trying to pump
[47:59] people
[48:01] up wonder why we don't hear this quote
[48:03] read that brother brandham liked it now
[48:07] brother brandham was not criticizing
[48:09] them so he says they're sung with real
[48:12] enthusiasm I was watching Jimmy this is
[48:15] the pastor's son I believe it is and if
[48:17] we could be just as enthused about all
[48:20] the things of God in our own life as
[48:24] Jimmy is in the emotion
[48:27] of them singing we would get
[48:31] somewhere I
[48:33] really appreciate that
[48:36] boy now there's one of two things we
[48:39] have to do with this quote either
[48:41] brother brandham was lying and he was
[48:43] being a hypocrite and he was standing up
[48:46] there bragging on that boy but he didn't
[48:48] really mean it or brother brandom meant
[48:51] it which I believe and I think you
[48:53] believe he meant it he appreciated it he
[48:56] enjoyed it as a matter of fact it goes
[48:58] down to Jack Moors later and talks about
[49:00] the same thing brags on him there talks
[49:03] about how blessed it was and how good it
[49:05] was so you wonder why then that people
[49:09] will try to take quotes and
[49:12] one-sidedly now watch this is in 1960
[49:15] this was 1963 the quote I just read you
[49:18] so brother random had been there prior
[49:20] to this meeting in sort and he says
[49:24] excuse me I didn't mean
[49:27] to walk around so brother randam has
[49:29] moved around and walked around on the
[49:31] platform maybe something's making me
[49:34] walk anyhow I got on my walking shars oh
[49:39] my I want to take a trip someday like
[49:41] Enoch and walk right on up standing in
[49:44] brother Outlaw's church not long ago in
[49:46] Phoenix Arizona they were singing a song
[49:50] were going up up up up after a while I
[49:55] thought I was gone
[49:58] so the first round climbing the ladder
[50:01] any all familiar with this old song the
[50:03] first round justification the second
[50:05] rung sanctification the third rung the
[50:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost they said the
[50:11] first round climbing the ladder the
[50:12] first round was justification the second
[50:15] round sanctification the third round
[50:19] glorification then the Holy Ghost come
[50:21] down I started up up up up up up up up
[50:26] up whoa whoa
[50:29] whoa so you mean the louder they went
[50:32] the longer they gun brother Brenham kept
[50:34] failing feeling himself give lifting
[50:37] higher and higher and higher and higher
[50:41] I mean how many UPS was that about eight
[50:43] or nine so the more they sing you know
[50:45] what's happening to him he's feeling the
[50:47] anointing and he's also feeling an
[50:50] emotional
[50:52] stir so if we're going to condemn
[50:55] emotions we're going to have to begin
[50:57] was our Prophet
[51:00] first unless he believed that he could
[51:02] be emotional but we couldn't do it he
[51:05] never believed in such
[51:07] nonsense well praise the Lord Brother
[51:09] Donnie I'm behind you buddy sir some of
[51:12] y'all are
[51:13] too now notice he
[51:17] says I started up up up up up up till I
[51:20] struck that milky white way and I saw if
[51:23] we go any farther we're going right from
[51:27] this church I mean there must have been
[51:29] a powerful something going on in that
[51:32] church and it wasn't from the preaching
[51:34] of the
[51:35] word it was from
[51:37] singing I mean they must have been
[51:40] worshiping God and what did it do if the
[51:43] if the music of the world brings them
[51:45] congregational people to a place they
[51:48] can leave their troubles behind for a
[51:50] while and they can get all caught up
[51:52] with that and it it does something to
[51:54] them the prophet tells us the world has
[51:56] emotions and the Christians have their
[51:58] emotions I think we're letting the devil
[52:01] Rob us from not letting the spirit of
[52:04] God bring us to a realm where we can get
[52:06] helped as I mentioned last night a lot
[52:08] of folks think when the word is over
[52:10] well time to go to the house that's not
[52:12] what the Bible tells us that's not what
[52:14] the message teaches us it's just then
[52:17] time to
[52:18] worship now I want you to notice he said
[52:20] I thought if we're going any higher
[52:21] we're going right from this church
[52:23] that's what we need today is strike that
[52:25] milky white way to Calvary rise in the
[52:28] power of the Holy Ghost lay us out our
[52:30] Creeds and differences start up up up up
[52:33] that's what we need to do going up well
[52:36] praise the Lord he gets so excited now
[52:39] here he's in sort after being in Phoenix
[52:42] and he's still getting emotional talking
[52:44] about it well if it was wrong wonder why
[52:47] he wouldn't say now I'll tell your
[52:49] friends you know I was out there and
[52:52] them people they was carrying on the
[52:53] office that ever was I mean I just got I
[52:57] got so embarrassed and so
[53:00] humiliated let me explain a little
[53:02] something to you our God is a god of
[53:05] variety all of his preachers are not the
[53:07] same all of his song leaders are not the
[53:10] same so you get a song leader that's not
[53:13] a very emotional song
[53:15] leader most of the time he will choose
[53:18] songs that aren't very emotional he will
[53:21] set the setting for that service so if
[53:25] you got an nonos song leader a
[53:28] non-emotional
[53:29] preacher what kind of church you figure
[53:32] you're going to
[53:35] have so what if you have a more
[53:39] emotional song leader and a more
[53:42] emotional
[53:44] preacher now does that mean that them
[53:46] folks are Pentecostal and they're not in
[53:49] the message no it doesn't but will they
[53:52] produce more emotional type of services
[53:56] yes they will why because the spirit is
[53:59] anointing them and they're getting into
[54:02] it now if they're not careful the more
[54:04] emotional ones will look at that other
[54:06] group and say were you a bunch of
[54:08] Baptist y'all are a bunch of Church of
[54:10] Christ my goodness you ain't got the
[54:12] Holy Ghost here and then they will fight
[54:15] back and say you bunch of
[54:17] Pentecostals it's so sad that that's
[54:20] going on in our message people in the
[54:23] message taking clips of of our church
[54:27] services and clips of other church
[54:30] services and showing them in their
[54:33] church and telling their churches these
[54:36] people are Pentecostal we
[54:39] are and I'm not even bashful about it
[54:42] I'm not backward about if they think
[54:44] they're going to humiliate me by doing
[54:46] that that's one of the greatest
[54:48] compliments they could give me now if
[54:50] they said I a Church of Christ I'd cry
[54:52] like a rat eating onions oh my goodness
[54:55] if they said he's just like a Baptist
[54:57] I'd repent God what in the world's a
[54:59] matter with me shake me
[55:03] Lord well praise the Lord I love the way
[55:06] brother random goes into this he said I
[55:08] I believe that God is a god of
[55:10] variety the world proves that he's got
[55:13] big mountains little mountains he's got
[55:16] Plains he's got deserts he's got
[55:19] different things because he made it the
[55:21] way he wanted it he made the season
[55:23] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[55:26] season Seasons it shows he's a god of
[55:27] variety now watch him bring it from the
[55:29] creation to human beings he made you in
[55:33] a variety some men are real
[55:38] blusterous some are real
[55:41] dogmatic others are
[55:44] fine others are kind and you find all
[55:49] different kinds of
[55:50] people in his
[55:53] kingdom oh my goodness so you mean we
[55:56] got dogmatic people in the Kingdom
[55:58] blusterous people in the kingdom and
[56:01] then we got some that's fine of course
[56:03] every one of us think we're that right
[56:06] we know who everybody else is but we
[56:08] know who the fine ones are now watch how
[56:11] he brings this to the apostles he said
[56:13] look at St Peter and judge
[56:17] him by
[56:19] Andrew now this is what causes the
[56:21] problem because a song leader natured a
[56:24] certain way a pastor natur a certain way
[56:27] there are some preachers that preach and
[56:29] never take off their coat if I didn't
[56:33] I'd catch on fire cuz I get so hot my
[56:36] metabolism Soares so much I'm telling
[56:39] you I'm just being honest with you I I
[56:41] would literally be ringing wet if I
[56:43] didn't do it I ain't got nothing against
[56:45] a man that don't take his coat off I
[56:47] don't understand why he's got a problem
[56:49] with me taking mine off so what do we do
[56:52] we judge one another by the way we like
[56:55] it
[56:56] so we like church this way this way this
[56:59] way and then if we go to another church
[57:01] and we say Lord have
[57:03] mercy I was scared te totally to death I
[57:07] never heard just screaming in my life I
[57:10] never heard that
[57:11] Lord if you all think Word of Life Is
[57:16] Wild the next time I go to brother Fred
[57:19] mullen's church I want to take you all
[57:22] with me you'll understand we're a tame
[57:25] bunch of little white
[57:28] people well praise the Lord but now
[57:31] watch how he Likens this look at St
[57:34] Peter and judge him by Andrew Andrew is
[57:39] that prayer
[57:41] Warrior just stayed on his knees all the
[57:44] time that reminds me of brother Daryl
[57:46] every time I read of
[57:48] this and the Apostle Peter was one of
[57:52] those fire brands
[57:56] anybody know what the word Firebrand
[57:58] means what you're fixing to Firebrand
[58:03] when someone is known for being wildly
[58:08] devoted to a cause or idea they're
[58:13] called a fire brand a fire brand enjoys
[58:18] pushing
[58:20] buttons and stirring up passions now you
[58:24] all since I've read that mean meaning
[58:26] automatically family members people you
[58:29] go to church with starts coming in your
[58:32] mind I ain't even going to look at y'all
[58:33] right now I I ain't going to do
[58:35] that because now you're thinking of
[58:38] people right Mama Maybe daddy brother
[58:42] sister a Firebrand is a passionate
[58:45] person who may enact change in a
[58:49] particular cause commonly political or
[58:53] social sometimes this person as
[58:58] seen oh my goodness as a ramble
[59:04] Rouser or a
[59:07] troublemaker and you mean
[59:11] Peter was a fire BR now if you all are
[59:14] thinking that about me tonight my
[59:16] feelings are going to be hurt
[59:20] bad and the Apostle Peter was one of
[59:22] those fire brands that preached
[59:27] and Paul was more scholarly like more
[59:31] like the prophet something that would
[59:34] just set
[59:36] back so which one of these brothers was
[59:42] right so now which one would people tend
[59:46] to make their favorite you know the
[59:49] answer to that depending on how they
[59:54] are so if they lean a certain way then
[59:58] they would say oh that's my favorite
[1:00:00] preacher right there absolutely I mean
[1:00:02] they ain't nobody can touch him well you
[1:00:04] watch that preacher and you get a good
[1:00:06] idea of the way they are now you see
[1:00:09] what's wrong is that brother renam read
[1:00:11] it talked about it so many times and you
[1:00:13] hear it quoted constantly you know that
[1:00:15] that people get one another's spirit so
[1:00:18] he said you watch the pastor of a church
[1:00:21] and he said if that Pastor jerks his
[1:00:23] neck a certain way he said you watch a
[1:00:26] lot of the congregation and they will
[1:00:28] jerk their neck a certain way well I
[1:00:32] jerk my leg a certain way the only one I
[1:00:35] know in this church that does it is
[1:00:37] little boys that's impersonating
[1:00:41] me I ain't seen none of you sisters do
[1:00:43] that I ain't seen none of you young men
[1:00:45] do that I I ain't seen another preacher
[1:00:47] in the church that does that now you
[1:00:50] know what that makes me
[1:00:54] happy you understand what I'm saying
[1:00:56] that makes me happy because you don't
[1:00:58] want to be like me what you want to be
[1:01:01] is the way God Made You Now if I stand
[1:01:05] up there and jerk my neck and I see
[1:01:07] everybody in the congregation even the
[1:01:08] little guys and they're stand there
[1:01:10] jerking their neck that's going to make
[1:01:11] me so sad cuz I'm going saying that
[1:01:14] they've got their eyes on the wrong
[1:01:15] person they want to be like me we want
[1:01:18] to be like the Lord Brother Ram never
[1:01:21] blasted and spoke against a man that run
[1:01:24] and all that sort of thing
[1:01:28] H
[1:01:30] well returning Jubilee He says back to a
[1:01:33] Pentecostal
[1:01:34] inheritance yes sir that's your
[1:01:38] possession denomination's not your
[1:01:41] possession
[1:01:43] Pentecost is your possession not a
[1:01:46] Pentecostal organization your fathers
[1:01:48] come out of such a thing the Pentecostal
[1:01:52] experience is your possession again p
[1:01:56] Pentecost I sent this to brother Daryl
[1:01:58] yesterday absolutely loved it
[1:02:02] Pentecost is the only thing that is
[1:02:06] going to
[1:02:07] prove
[1:02:10] Christianity now remember when not
[1:02:12] talking about Aus his street
[1:02:14] 1906 but the original Pentecost I don't
[1:02:17] blame the devil for not wanting us to be
[1:02:21] original Pentecost because he knows
[1:02:24] that's the only thing that that will
[1:02:26] prove Christianity you can't prove it by
[1:02:28] science you can't prove it by nothing
[1:02:31] but by a Pentecostal experience you
[1:02:33] Baptists know that you methodists and
[1:02:35] Presbyterians whoever you are you know
[1:02:38] it takes a a a
[1:02:40] Pentecostal
[1:02:41] experience to prove God that's why I
[1:02:44] want every young person in our church to
[1:02:46] have
[1:02:47] one now does that mean that you'll act
[1:02:49] like me or act like some of the more
[1:02:51] emotional ones no look at Andrew I just
[1:02:54] read to you about Andrew a apparently
[1:02:56] Andrew was not an emotional guy the way
[1:02:59] that Peter was but he had the same Holy
[1:03:01] Ghost maybe Andrew was a crier which I
[1:03:04] would remind you crying is an
[1:03:10] emotion so preachers that cry all the
[1:03:12] time I know some preachers and they cry
[1:03:15] they cry at weddings they cry at alar
[1:03:17] calls they cry at this they cry at that
[1:03:20] and yet preach against emotion to no end
[1:03:24] and I'm thinking maybe you need to
[1:03:26] broaden your understanding of what
[1:03:27] emotions are you
[1:03:29] know notice he says it takes a
[1:03:32] Pentecostal experience to prove God and
[1:03:36] that's to each individual it does
[1:03:38] improve the
[1:03:40] organization it proves the
[1:03:43] individual so quoting the prophet don't
[1:03:46] prove you're a message believer
[1:03:48] believing Malachi for don't prove it and
[1:03:52] you won't prove God just by being able
[1:03:54] to prove that brother R was a prophet
[1:03:57] but by having a Pentecostal experience
[1:03:59] the resurrection will prove itself out
[1:04:01] of
[1:04:02] you marriage of the Lamb Christ has
[1:04:04] invited us to sit in Heavenly places
[1:04:06] with
[1:04:07] him and we're ashamed of it many people
[1:04:11] are ashamed to say they got the baptism
[1:04:15] of the Holy Ghost Pentecostal people
[1:04:18] that's right they're ashamed to say it
[1:04:20] we're ashamed of him now he's talking
[1:04:22] about the queen of course that Esther
[1:04:24] replaced her VY the queen wouldn't come
[1:04:28] she refused to come and it humiliated
[1:04:31] him his face turned red and everybody
[1:04:34] noticed it I wonder if Jesus face don't
[1:04:39] turn a little red too when he calls on
[1:04:43] us for a work calls on the Pentecostal
[1:04:46] movement for fellowship and Brotherhood
[1:04:48] and we're so tightly organized in little
[1:04:51] groups till we won't B for the other
[1:04:54] getting so worldly and things like that
[1:04:56] we're getting ashamed of the name of
[1:05:00] Pentecost now you know what's what's
[1:05:02] even worse than that is that people in
[1:05:05] the message are ashamed of their
[1:05:09] Pentecostal experience and ashamed to
[1:05:11] see anybody that would act like they did
[1:05:14] on the day of
[1:05:15] Pentecost so if brother Brandon was here
[1:05:18] now and he could preach I wonder what
[1:05:20] he'd say to some of these message
[1:05:22] churches and message preachers I tell
[1:05:24] you he he' blast them he'd burn their
[1:05:27] hide you say you believe what I preached
[1:05:30] I never preached that where'd you get
[1:05:32] that at he'd have to because that's what
[1:05:34] he preached when he was here we're
[1:05:36] getting ashamed of the name of Pentecost
[1:05:38] some people is afraid to say well I I'm
[1:05:41] a Christian I'm glad I got a Pentecostal
[1:05:44] experience I'm glad to Bear the name of
[1:05:47] Jesus Christ the greatest privilege I
[1:05:50] ever had is to say I'm part of him are
[1:05:55] Are you ashamed of Divine Healing Are
[1:05:58] you ashamed of the Full Gospel Are you
[1:06:03] ashamed of your
[1:06:05] Pentecostal
[1:06:07] experience I'll say tonight I'm
[1:06:10] not so let me ask
[1:06:13] you what would you all
[1:06:16] think if Sunday I come back and I got to
[1:06:20] preaching and I took off running and I
[1:06:22] jumped up on the platform there on the
[1:06:25] pulpit
[1:06:26] and I sat right up
[1:06:28] here I climbed up on the pull pit and I
[1:06:32] was sitting here and my legs were
[1:06:34] hanging off dangling like that and I had
[1:06:38] the microphone in my hand and I was
[1:06:40] preaching 90 miles an
[1:06:42] hour what would y'all think would y'all
[1:06:45] classify me as Pentecostal what would
[1:06:47] some of the message people think boy
[1:06:49] that clip would go round and around the
[1:06:51] world wouldn't it I want you to look at
[1:06:53] this Pentecostal he's always been p
[1:06:55] costal I'll tell you one thing he needs
[1:06:57] to come to the
[1:07:00] message H okay now what I'm going to do
[1:07:03] is change the scene so it's not going to
[1:07:06] be me upon that
[1:07:10] Pulpit it's going to be your
[1:07:15] Prophet read it with me Redemption and
[1:07:19] completeness of Joy here some time ago I
[1:07:21] was preaching in a little
[1:07:22] church oh I haven't got very many Pulpit
[1:07:26] manners according I guess to the
[1:07:28] Theology of the day so I guess I got a
[1:07:30] little
[1:07:33] unruly and I jumped up on the pull pit
[1:07:36] like that and grabbed the microphone in
[1:07:39] my hand and sat there and my
[1:07:42] feet swinging
[1:07:46] off everybody okay do I need to dial
[1:07:50] 911 so I wonder if some of these
[1:07:53] preachers who are constantly blasting
[1:07:55] motion and calling people like brother
[1:07:58] Daryl of Pentecostal and people like me
[1:08:00] and Brother David S oh Lord have mercy
[1:08:03] David Soler di in the O
[1:08:06] Pentecostal well if they don't call
[1:08:08] brother brandham that then they're a
[1:08:14] hypocrite amen right thank you I was
[1:08:17] just making sure y'all could still say
[1:08:18] that wonderful word I love to hear so my
[1:08:22] feet are swinging off preaching just as
[1:08:24] hard as I could
[1:08:26] I come to
[1:08:28] myself brother Brandon was actually
[1:08:32] beside
[1:08:36] himself so I come to
[1:08:39] myself I didn't know what I was
[1:08:43] doing oh Lord why did this quote have to
[1:08:46] be in the
[1:08:47] message oh no no doubt it was left there
[1:08:51] specially for me cuz the Lord knew I got
[1:08:55] one one young down there that ain't
[1:08:57] afraid to read it that's exactly right
[1:09:01] in a few minutes I got lost again and I
[1:09:06] found myself down in the middle of the
[1:09:09] aisle rolling up my trouser
[1:09:17] leg I don't know
[1:09:21] why so now if I would have done this on
[1:09:24] Sunday
[1:09:26] and you all would have seen this and
[1:09:28] you'd thought poor brother
[1:09:30] dony he's so stressed out he he he's
[1:09:34] lost his
[1:09:36] mind but of course if I do it now on
[1:09:39] Sunday you all won't think that will you
[1:09:41] your parents will of course they they
[1:09:43] will they'll have a meeting afterwards
[1:09:45] and try to vote me out because they
[1:09:47] wouldn't hear and heard this quote
[1:09:50] read so isn't it amazing that we change
[1:09:53] the way we look at things
[1:09:56] when we hear it from the right source so
[1:09:59] what's so sad is that many brothers
[1:10:01] who's constantly preaching against
[1:10:02] emotion oh my that music is gone let's
[1:10:05] everybody get up oh it ain't nothing
[1:10:07] bunch of emotion it ain't nothing so how
[1:10:10] do we know that it wasn't nothing but a
[1:10:13] bunch of
[1:10:14] emotion now are we going to say that
[1:10:16] brother brandham all this that he was
[1:10:18] doing was nothing but pure
[1:10:21] emotion what in the world has been under
[1:10:24] the anointing War of the Holy Ghost got
[1:10:26] to do with a preacher running out in the
[1:10:29] aisle rolling up one of his Brit's
[1:10:35] legs but of course none of us will say
[1:10:39] anything about that will
[1:10:43] we so brother Brandon was so beside
[1:10:46] himself he didn't know where he was at
[1:10:49] roll up his Brites L now according to
[1:10:51] him you can get this be on the website
[1:10:54] there this quote in a few minutes I got
[1:10:56] lost again and found myself down the
[1:10:57] middle of the aisle rolling up my
[1:10:59] trouser leg I don't know why I but I'd
[1:11:03] like to stay there a
[1:11:07] while so he was somewhere other than
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:11] building praise the
[1:11:14] Lord and there's one thing I'd like to
[1:11:17] say I was somewhere that I sure was
[1:11:22] enjoying myself
[1:11:25] and I lived off of it for several
[1:11:30] days
[1:11:36] afterward can I read you another one
[1:11:39] that's good cuz I was going to anyway
[1:11:41] but it's just nice when y'all nod your
[1:11:43] head about 15 years ago tonight I was
[1:11:46] standing on this
[1:11:49] platform with a big chart
[1:11:52] teaching and there was a little
[1:11:54] Pentecostal group coming from Louisville
[1:11:56] and I never did
[1:11:59] believe in them people
[1:12:03] dancing the way they
[1:12:06] did it's one thing I love about this man
[1:12:09] is
[1:12:10] honesty I never did believe in them
[1:12:14] people dancing the way they did and
[1:12:17] there was a little lady come up here to
[1:12:18] play the Piana they was going to play a
[1:12:21] special and beat on the Thimbles and on
[1:12:23] the washboard and some of them beat on a
[1:12:26] tan
[1:12:27] can and I was very much a Critic of it
[1:12:33] so I thought what's going to happen and
[1:12:37] the woman come up to play the special
[1:12:40] and she got to playing that lady got to
[1:12:43] beaten on the
[1:12:44] washboard this little bronde headed girl
[1:12:47] jump out there on the floor and begin to
[1:12:50] dance in the spirit me sitting in the
[1:12:53] seat of the
[1:12:56] scornful oh
[1:12:58] wow I wonder how many message people
[1:13:01] today if something like this would were
[1:13:04] to happen would be sitting in the seat
[1:13:08] of the
[1:13:10] scornful and I said I wish you'd look at
[1:13:14] that and I began telling my church they
[1:13:18] was all wondering what I was going to do
[1:13:20] about it now here this is a Baptist
[1:13:22] Church this is Brother Bam's church and
[1:13:24] it was started as a Baptist
[1:13:27] Church so you imagine now they're all
[1:13:29] looking at their
[1:13:30] Pastor uhoh what's he going to
[1:13:35] do I kept looking at her and I thought
[1:13:39] look at that now isn't that
[1:13:42] something making a
[1:13:45] Tavern out of my
[1:13:50] church making a
[1:13:53] Tavern out of my church and I was
[1:13:57] sitting there not knowing any better I
[1:14:00] wasn't saying anything but in my heart I
[1:14:02] was thinking it and I watched her there
[1:14:04] a little while and she was
[1:14:06] dancing the first thing you know I said
[1:14:08] now wait a
[1:14:09] minute I wonder if the lady has got
[1:14:12] scripture for it and I begin to think
[1:14:15] about the scriptures and I said where
[1:14:16] was dancing ever ordained the first
[1:14:18] place in the Bible that right I thought
[1:14:21] well what made them dance I see the
[1:14:23] children of Israel when they across the
[1:14:25] Red Sea Miriam looked back and seen
[1:14:27] those taskmasters drowned she pick up a
[1:14:30] tambourine and begin to dance and beat
[1:14:32] this tambourine run down the shores danc
[1:14:35] and the daughters of Israel followed her
[1:14:37] dancing and I thought that's Victory and
[1:14:41] I've seen David and one his sweetheart
[1:14:43] sitting up there behind this fan of
[1:14:44] Fanon looking at her cute little
[1:14:46] boyfriend David standing out there and
[1:14:49] here he come the ark and brother Graham
[1:14:51] talked about a while ago crossing the
[1:14:53] hill and when David seen it coming he
[1:14:55] danced around and around and around
[1:14:58] while she said you embarrass me he said
[1:15:01] if you don't like that watch
[1:15:04] this and around and around and around he
[1:15:07] went you know what oh
[1:15:11] children God looked down out of
[1:15:14] heaven and said
[1:15:17] David you're a man after my own
[1:15:22] heart so God didn't look down there and
[1:15:24] say I'm ashamed of you get down there
[1:15:27] dancing and carrying on but God looked
[1:15:30] at him and said
[1:15:31] David that's so moved me you're a man
[1:15:36] after my own
[1:15:38] heart
[1:15:40] oh and I saw you
[1:15:43] know there's one thing the matter with
[1:15:47] me I haven't got enough Victory
[1:15:52] maybe rut R Shaggy
[1:15:59] I'm afraid that's what's wrong with a
[1:16:01] lot of our message people they've got
[1:16:03] all kinds of quotes all kinds of
[1:16:05] doctrines all kinds of theology but they
[1:16:08] ain't got very much Victory right
[1:16:11] sir oh
[1:16:14] my I got to sitting
[1:16:17] there I got I want you notice how
[1:16:19] identifies this I got my Methodist foot
[1:16:23] patent
[1:16:25] his Methodist foot I got my Methodist
[1:16:29] foot patent and the first thing you know
[1:16:32] God my
[1:16:34] judge for I knowed what I was doing I
[1:16:40] was out there on that floor dancing
[1:16:43] around with that
[1:16:46] [Laughter]
[1:16:48] girl so if every preacher in the message
[1:16:51] that preaches against me dancing Don't
[1:16:54] Preach against brother random doing it
[1:16:56] they're a hypocrite that's and they are
[1:17:00] disqualified from being a pastor cuz a
[1:17:03] pastor is supposed to be blameless and
[1:17:05] you can't be a blameless hypocrite
[1:17:07] that's it amen so if they don't call
[1:17:09] brother brandom a Pentecostal just like
[1:17:11] to do me or any other person that gets
[1:17:14] emotional it shows to me they're a
[1:17:16] hypocrite and they're not fit to be in
[1:17:18] the
[1:17:20] pullit boy this is going to get me big
[1:17:23] trouble ain't it I found myself on the
[1:17:26] floor dancing around with that girl
[1:17:28] that's right then I said God take me out
[1:17:33] of the seat of the scornful let me look
[1:17:36] at anything
[1:17:38] sensibly before I ever pass a
[1:17:42] judgment
[1:17:43] anymore I say Lord help us
[1:17:47] tonight amen God does things
[1:17:52] peculiar oh praise the Lord don't you
[1:17:55] love him have I got time for just part
[1:17:57] of one
[1:17:59] more is it wrong to wear
[1:18:02] mascara
[1:18:04] slash dye
[1:18:07] eyelashes I know many women dye their
[1:18:10] eyelashes black to avoid wearing
[1:18:14] mascara but are you not achieving the
[1:18:17] same goal I wear mascara sometimes but
[1:18:21] feel people look at that differently
[1:18:23] than dying your
[1:18:25] eyelashes are they both wrong question
[1:18:28] mark neither question mark Second Kings
[1:18:34] 9:30 and when J was come to jezrael
[1:18:38] Jezebel heard of it and she painted her
[1:18:43] face and tired her
[1:18:47] head and looked out a
[1:18:50] window now there ain't no way I can
[1:18:53] cover all this question tonight because
[1:18:56] and looking at this I went back into the
[1:19:00] toic area era of Egypt I went into the
[1:19:06] romanic era I went Plumb back into the
[1:19:10] era of the Phoenicians the ashdod ites
[1:19:14] different places trying to bring
[1:19:16] historically where this come
[1:19:19] from so I want you to notice what
[1:19:21] happened now so J Hugh he's coming in
[1:19:24] Jezebel hears that he's
[1:19:27] coming Jezebel is about
[1:19:31] 53 to 55 something like that J is a much
[1:19:35] younger
[1:19:36] man but this worked on
[1:19:40] Ahab and it worked on other men that she
[1:19:44] had tried to seduce by her beauty so she
[1:19:48] does the same thing
[1:19:51] again so she painted her face now this
[1:19:54] is what the Bible says painted her face
[1:19:58] so let me share with you now a little
[1:19:59] bit of the history that I found died the
[1:20:03] upper and under eyelids a common
[1:20:07] practice in the East even at the present
[1:20:11] day the effect is to increase the
[1:20:15] apparent size of the eye to give it an
[1:20:20] unnatural
[1:20:22] brilliancy representations of ey thus
[1:20:26] embellished occurred on the Assyrian
[1:20:30] sculptures now we're talking about 1,700
[1:20:35] years something like that before the
[1:20:37] Lord Jesus ever even came on the earth
[1:20:41] so this has been a practice and I will
[1:20:44] say a heathen practice for Millennia
[1:20:50] according to the still common practice
[1:20:52] of Oriental women she painted her
[1:20:56] eyebrows and her eyelashes with a
[1:21:00] pigment composed of antomy and zinc
[1:21:06] which is the Arabic coal the Romans also
[1:21:11] painted their eyes plany which was a
[1:21:13] Roman historian says such is their
[1:21:16] affection of
[1:21:18] ornament that they paint their eyes also
[1:21:22] that this painting was with stulum or
[1:21:26] antimony is plain from the words of
[1:21:29] sapri a theologian and Bishop of
[1:21:33] Carthage which was martyred in 258 ad
[1:21:37] now here he is admonishing the Christian
[1:21:41] women and this is what he tells them
[1:21:43] anoint your eyes not with the devil's
[1:21:48] antimony but with the iav of Christ
[1:21:53] juvenile a Roman poet from the 2 Century
[1:21:57] he said that men as well as women in
[1:22:02] Rome practiced it now listen to where
[1:22:06] all this comes from some it comes from
[1:22:08] ancient Rome it comes from ancient Egypt
[1:22:12] from ancient Assyria so it's it dates
[1:22:17] it's pre Christendom so it was the way
[1:22:21] of the Heathen notice again now he said
[1:22:25] that men practice it too but watch how
[1:22:29] the prophet and why I'm against
[1:22:31] organized religion but this mother
[1:22:32] Babylon had caught herself a bunch of
[1:22:35] chickens slick chicks painted up bobbed
[1:22:40] hair called themselves Christians and
[1:22:43] she got a cage full of them you
[1:22:46] preachers that stand in the pit and let
[1:22:49] them women get by with that shame on you
[1:22:53] to make your deny ination or more God
[1:22:56] will require that of your hand come out
[1:23:00] of it my sheep hear my voice a cage of
[1:23:03] hateful heady highminded lovers of
[1:23:07] pleasure more than lovers of God would
[1:23:10] rather be like the world than to be like
[1:23:12] Christ when you see woman a woman with a
[1:23:15] lot of makeup on it goes to show she's
[1:23:20] empty
[1:23:21] inside she's false
[1:23:24] inside that's exactly right I seen one
[1:23:28] the other day with green hair that's
[1:23:31] right had all that green stuff there in
[1:23:35] her eyes Now watch how that he
[1:23:39] identifies it now when he was 14 he got
[1:23:41] shot him and a friend were were hunting
[1:23:44] and his friend allowed his gun to go off
[1:23:48] and it was a shotgun which means that
[1:23:50] there was many tiny pellets for you
[1:23:52] sisters that don't know in a shotgun
[1:23:54] shell instead of being one bullet so
[1:23:57] whenever the the gun went off then all
[1:24:00] these pellets hit brother random as a
[1:24:03] boy inside of his
[1:24:05] legs well they thought he was dying he'
[1:24:08] bled a big majority of his blood out the
[1:24:11] nurse that was standing by said think of
[1:24:13] it he's just a boy and he felt himself
[1:24:17] sinking now he he wasn't saved there he
[1:24:20] felt himself sinking and he was he was
[1:24:23] dying
[1:24:25] and entering into the regions of the
[1:24:28] lost now this was more than just a
[1:24:31] near-death experience he said after a
[1:24:35] while I heard the most mournful sound
[1:24:39] that I ever heard it was the awfulest
[1:24:43] feeling now when he talks about this he
[1:24:45] said A Burning Flame would have been a
[1:24:51] pleasure which is hard to imagine EXP
[1:24:54] experiencing A Burning Flame would have
[1:24:57] been a pleasure compared to where he was
[1:25:00] now remember he says that God will never
[1:25:03] condemn a person to a lake of fire
[1:25:06] without first judging them you can read
[1:25:08] of all types of people who have near
[1:25:11] death experiences and many of them will
[1:25:13] say they went to a fire well I'll tell
[1:25:15] you what's happening right there that is
[1:25:18] not reality by the word and demons out
[1:25:21] of hell know that so there letting them
[1:25:25] experience something that is not even
[1:25:27] true in the order of God they go to the
[1:25:30] regions of the lost by the word but them
[1:25:33] Devils know there's no hope for them so
[1:25:36] they will be able to conjure up and be
[1:25:38] able to produce a fiery flame a fiery
[1:25:43] feeling a just God never sends man to a
[1:25:46] burning Lake of Fire until he does it
[1:25:48] now you talk about them demons that are
[1:25:51] so rotten and so corrupt they will tor
[1:25:54] tment people with flames and the people
[1:25:56] think they're going there actually
[1:25:58] they're going here they go to the Lake
[1:26:00] of Fire afterwards and he said there's
[1:26:03] no way even a literal burning
[1:26:06] fire would have been a
[1:26:10] pleasure oh Lord have mercy to the side
[1:26:13] of what this was now these Visions now
[1:26:18] they've never been wrong it was one of
[1:26:20] the most horrible things I ever had and
[1:26:23] I heard a noise and it sounded like some
[1:26:26] kind of haunted Affair and I looked
[1:26:29] coming and it was
[1:26:32] women and they had green stuff and I
[1:26:36] could just see their face and they had
[1:26:38] this green stuff under their eyes and
[1:26:41] their eyes look like they were run
[1:26:45] back and they had their eyes run back
[1:26:47] like the women today paint their eyes
[1:26:51] run back like
[1:26:53] that just their
[1:26:55] eyes and their face and they were going
[1:27:00] oo
[1:27:01] oo
[1:27:03] oo and I screamed out oh God have mercy
[1:27:08] on me have mercy oh God where are you if
[1:27:12] you'll only let me go back and live I
[1:27:14] promise you I'll be a good
[1:27:18] boy so this is what he sees when he goes
[1:27:21] down into the regions of the Lost
[1:27:25] isn't it amazing that these beings that
[1:27:28] were there in that
[1:27:29] realm were looking like the women on
[1:27:34] earth so wonder where it come
[1:27:37] from so they had started taking on the
[1:27:41] image of the regions of the Lost several
[1:27:44] years ago I went into
[1:27:46] Walmart and I wanted
[1:27:49] to someone had told me of the different
[1:27:52] images that were on some of the rock and
[1:27:55] roll albums that's when you could still
[1:27:57] buy
[1:27:58] albums and I wanted to go in there
[1:28:00] brother Joe and look at it so I'd be
[1:28:02] familiar with it myself and as I started
[1:28:06] flipping through some of those things I
[1:28:09] mean it was it was frightening AC DC um
[1:28:14] I don't even remember the names I've
[1:28:15] never listened to rock and roll so I
[1:28:16] don't know anything about it but as I
[1:28:19] begin to listen or look at that rather
[1:28:22] and I went back and listened to this at
[1:28:24] brother brandham
[1:28:26] saw and I be to see a
[1:28:29] correlation that hell had be to vomit
[1:28:32] out its
[1:28:33] influence and I noticed many of those
[1:28:36] rock and roll guys were painted up as
[1:28:39] well and they would have some of the
[1:28:41] most strange bizarr looking outfits that
[1:28:45] were on them and then brother Tim PR had
[1:28:48] told me that he had heard a a podcast
[1:28:51] been several years ago and it was some
[1:28:54] of these guys that play the guitar and
[1:28:56] different instruments of rock and roll
[1:28:58] and they would ask them why do you dress
[1:29:00] a certain way why do you do a you know
[1:29:02] dressed a certain way or have your hair
[1:29:04] a certain way or have facial hair in a
[1:29:06] certain way you do why don't you get rid
[1:29:08] of that he say oh no no no no I would
[1:29:10] lose my
[1:29:12] power to play the way that I do if I
[1:29:16] don't have this image cuz there's
[1:29:19] something about this image that when I
[1:29:22] dress that way I comb my hair that way I
[1:29:25] stick out my tongue a certain way it
[1:29:28] moves all over
[1:29:31] me you think how
[1:29:34] frightening that human beings on the
[1:29:36] Earth are coming under the influence of
[1:29:40] demons and they become a
[1:29:43] transmitter of demonic power so that's
[1:29:46] why people go to these concerts and they
[1:29:48] get under this influence and they get
[1:29:50] all fired up and they leave with demons
[1:29:54] on
[1:29:54] them why it's a place for demons
[1:29:58] together so if they're influenced what
[1:30:01] about us being influenced by the Holy
[1:30:05] Ghost now notice he said so help me
[1:30:07] these weary creatures all around and I
[1:30:10] had just been a new
[1:30:15] arrival the most hideous horrible
[1:30:19] ungodly feeling look like great big eyes
[1:30:25] big
[1:30:28] eyelashes out like that run back like a
[1:30:33] cat back like this and green stuff and
[1:30:37] like it had cankered or something and
[1:30:40] they were going ooh ooh ooh oh what a
[1:30:48] feeling so sisters you want to look
[1:30:52] pretty you're supposed to
[1:30:54] but you don't have to look worldly to be
[1:30:59] pretty and then I'd like to call your
[1:31:02] attention that whenever he goes beyond
[1:31:05] the curtain of time and somewhere around
[1:31:08] February March something like that of
[1:31:12] 1960 and the first thing he sees there
[1:31:16] the first thing he saw in the regions of
[1:31:18] the Lost was
[1:31:20] women the first thing he sees when when
[1:31:24] he goes into the sixth Dimension were
[1:31:28] women they had not come and said you
[1:31:31] woman
[1:31:32] hater why did you torment us why did you
[1:31:36] hate
[1:31:37] women but they were screaming our
[1:31:40] precious
[1:31:41] brother our precious
[1:31:44] brother I want you to notice their
[1:31:48] appearance he never mentioned one of
[1:31:51] them that had anything around our
[1:31:54] eyes she didn't have on fake
[1:31:57] eyelashes she didn't have on high heel
[1:32:00] shoes she didn't have on tight clothes
[1:32:04] and decent
[1:32:07] dressed I hope you understand why I'm
[1:32:09] coming from
[1:32:11] that we are caught in this lapse of
[1:32:16] time somebody just said to you like this
[1:32:19] because this is the way the prophet
[1:32:20] taught it there's three realms beneath
[1:32:24] us three Realms beneath us and there's
[1:32:29] three above us and we're caught in the
[1:32:33] middle so every day our lives are
[1:32:37] constantly under the
[1:32:39] influence of those three Realms below us
[1:32:42] and those three Realms above
[1:32:44] us and there's a part of all of us even
[1:32:47] though we're Christians Holy Ghost
[1:32:49] filled that can still feel the negative
[1:32:52] effect of those three Realms down this
[1:32:54] way and that's this right here because
[1:32:57] this has not been born again so this is
[1:33:00] why we pray lead me not into temptation
[1:33:03] but Deliver Me From Evil is that right
[1:33:05] because this flesh has not been redeemed
[1:33:07] and the devil knows that he knows his
[1:33:09] rights and he'll do everything he can to
[1:33:12] try to affect us in a negative way so he
[1:33:16] is doing everything he can you imagine
[1:33:18] that the prophet in
[1:33:20] 1961 said the lid has been tore off of
[1:33:23] the kill
[1:33:24] and demon powers are streaming in every
[1:33:29] direction if we could be able to look
[1:33:31] around us today this very day you've
[1:33:33] lived you've you worked you've went to
[1:33:35] school whatever you've done if you could
[1:33:38] have saw the spirits that were on the
[1:33:40] people that you worked with the people
[1:33:43] that's at Walmart wherever you go it
[1:33:46] would be
[1:33:47] horrifying I'm personally glad I don't
[1:33:50] I'm not allowed to see a lot of that
[1:33:53] realm I've been able to see it I've seen
[1:33:55] demons before I've seen Angels before
[1:33:58] but I don't mind telling you I'm glad
[1:33:59] I'm not made to deal with that realm
[1:34:02] because it frightens me it does and and
[1:34:05] and the prophet said every time as many
[1:34:07] times as he was in the presence of the
[1:34:09] angel of God it still made him and left
[1:34:12] him numb that was what it did to him but
[1:34:17] every one of us are constantly day in
[1:34:20] and day out impounded from this three
[1:34:23] realms and then the prophet said you
[1:34:25] imagine all the glory of God all the
[1:34:27] great mercy and the forgiveness and the
[1:34:29] kindness of God and it's all funnel down
[1:34:32] into a little 2-in pipe all that's
[1:34:36] coming down into a 2-in pipe and you're
[1:34:39] standing at the bottom of that 2-in pipe
[1:34:42] and that pipe is about to burst it's a
[1:34:45] it's shaking it's quivering it's it's
[1:34:48] rattling all that pressure all that that
[1:34:52] he wants to give us
[1:34:55] and all this down here want to come up
[1:34:57] and haunt you and torment you what were
[1:35:01] those women in that region doing
[1:35:04] haunting this 14-year-old
[1:35:07] boy if you've got the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:35:10] and you're sealed by the spirit of God
[1:35:12] they can never get your soul but they
[1:35:15] will haunt
[1:35:16] you you've heard me tell it before and I
[1:35:18] feel I should tell just remind you again
[1:35:22] I was a Pentecostal preacher I was up in
[1:35:24] Michigan Carol wasn't with me on that
[1:35:27] trip I was staying at the pastor's house
[1:35:30] I went to preach that night went to bed
[1:35:32] that night and in those days I was a
[1:35:34] pretty sound solid sleeper I'd sleep
[1:35:37] pretty good I did say in those
[1:35:40] days and I was
[1:35:42] awakened by the headboard was right
[1:35:46] against the wall but the headboard hit
[1:35:49] the wall and made a noise and the bed
[1:35:54] moved and as it did it it woke me up
[1:35:57] well I was sleeping on my back so when I
[1:35:59] opened my eyes I see a being standing at
[1:36:04] the end of my bed a little bit taller
[1:36:06] than than I
[1:36:08] am cloaked in solid
[1:36:11] black his head had a cloak on and a hood
[1:36:15] like a hoodie but it was a very deep
[1:36:18] hoodie and his head was back inside this
[1:36:23] and his eyes I could see his eyes and I
[1:36:26] could see his
[1:36:27] mouth of course whenever I woke up it
[1:36:30] scared me to death I don't mind telling
[1:36:32] you it scared me I put my hands behind
[1:36:35] me and I I was climbing up out of the
[1:36:37] bed like
[1:36:38] this and I said Satan I rebuke you in
[1:36:41] the name of Jesus he come right against
[1:36:44] it hit the bed again took his finger and
[1:36:47] his finger looked like this real long
[1:36:50] kind of crooked out from under this
[1:36:52] black vase
[1:36:54] and he said I've come Audible Voice I've
[1:36:57] come to take your
[1:37:01] life again I said in the name of Jesus I
[1:37:04] rebuke
[1:37:06] you I rebuke it remember this far I
[1:37:08] comes the
[1:37:10] message again he bumped the bed and he
[1:37:13] couldn't go no farther I said in the
[1:37:15] name of Jesus I rebuke you go back to
[1:37:19] hell where you come
[1:37:21] from that time he backed up
[1:37:25] again again went backwards right out of
[1:37:29] the wall totally
[1:37:33] disappeared you said but don't want to
[1:37:35] wor what I ever do if I ever seen
[1:37:37] something like that if you're not called
[1:37:38] to handle that don't worry God won't let
[1:37:40] you see it but just know they're around
[1:37:44] you every day of your
[1:37:45] life that's what tries to talk you into
[1:37:48] doing wrong that's what tries to
[1:37:50] discourage it say oh I'm just so
[1:37:52] discouraged I I don't want to go to
[1:37:53] church if you could see those beings
[1:37:56] that are talking to you you'd want to go
[1:37:59] to church every day you'd want to be
[1:38:01] around godly people and godly things
[1:38:03] every day You' never want anything to do
[1:38:05] with them but they cloak thems and Veil
[1:38:10] thems few years after that we was living
[1:38:13] in West
[1:38:15] Virginia I was working with a man of the
[1:38:17] name of Ari West you can go to YouTube
[1:38:19] and type in his name Ari West and you'll
[1:38:21] see me sitting behind him playing a
[1:38:22] guitar I look much younger than I do
[1:38:25] now but he had preached in West Virginia
[1:38:27] and Carol was expecting our youngest
[1:38:30] daughter Erica Erica was actually born
[1:38:32] down there and he had preached that
[1:38:35] night and I was driving him back home he
[1:38:38] was about 2 and a half hours and Carol
[1:38:40] was getting pretty close to her time of
[1:38:41] delivery so he and I were coming back
[1:38:45] every night after the after the service
[1:38:47] so he had preached and he was
[1:38:48] asleep then West Virginia roads is just
[1:38:51] like this curvy so there wasn't much
[1:38:53] traffic trff on him and I was just going
[1:38:55] down the road I was trying to be quiet
[1:38:57] music would keep him awake so I didn't
[1:38:59] have anything going so I was just
[1:39:01] driving you know talking to the Lord
[1:39:03] just kind of singing being quiet I
[1:39:05] happened to look in the rarie mirror and
[1:39:08] when I did I saw that being again in the
[1:39:12] back
[1:39:14] seat again his head set back in that
[1:39:18] cloak them eyes peering at me
[1:39:23] but this
[1:39:24] time I just whispered I thought what a
[1:39:28] difference I whispered the name of Jesus
[1:39:33] and he
[1:39:34] disappeared I believe God let that
[1:39:36] happen to me for a reason to help me see
[1:39:38] CU remember I was a Pentecostal so
[1:39:41] whatever I had done I had to do it to
[1:39:43] the top of my voice I had to scream I
[1:39:46] had to run I had to holler the devil
[1:39:48] won't move if you don't scream and
[1:39:49] holler but the Lord was teaching me
[1:39:52] something then I never forgot it I
[1:39:55] didn't have to scream I didn't have to
[1:39:57] holler I
[1:39:59] whispered one night we was in that
[1:40:01] church a woman come up for prayer she
[1:40:04] was demon possessed we prayed for her
[1:40:07] having a prayer line so brother West
[1:40:10] pointed for Carol to come up and pray
[1:40:14] with the woman so Carol comes up to pray
[1:40:17] for her and this demon and this
[1:40:20] woman Carol kind of got over the woman
[1:40:23] like this and the woman took her hands
[1:40:25] up and went around Carol's neck just
[1:40:28] like this she was screaming rering like
[1:40:32] a snake absolutely awful
[1:40:34] horrendous and it was phenomenal to
[1:40:37] watch it because she was taking her
[1:40:39] hands and she was trying her
[1:40:43] best but she couldn't choke
[1:40:46] her it's like there was an invisible
[1:40:49] something around Carol's neck and that
[1:40:52] demon Ed woman now believe me
[1:40:55] demon-possessed people are so
[1:40:58] strong I saw a woman one time tiny tiny
[1:41:02] woman her husband was trying to hold her
[1:41:05] her son was trying to hold her several
[1:41:08] people in the room trying to hold her
[1:41:10] when I walked into the room and she let
[1:41:13] out a scream like a man in a man's voice
[1:41:16] and said get him away from me get him
[1:41:19] away from
[1:41:21] me I hate him
[1:41:26] you'll never make me
[1:41:29] leave I was
[1:41:31] in the Garden of
[1:41:37] Eden but you see
[1:41:39] children greater is he that is in us
[1:41:44] than he that is in the world Amen I'm
[1:41:46] not sharing these things with you to
[1:41:48] scare you but to let you know they're
[1:41:50] all around us
[1:41:53] so they'll try this little thing or that
[1:41:56] little thing to get you to compromise
[1:41:58] maybe you break over and you listen to a
[1:42:00] song you shouldn't listen to or maybe
[1:42:02] your sisters you'll put on just a little
[1:42:04] teeny bit of something makeup or
[1:42:07] whatever and you feel really funny about
[1:42:09] doing it be all right it's okay it's
[1:42:11] just it's just a little bit but what was
[1:42:13] it that influenced you to do that
[1:42:16] actually there was no Daughters of God
[1:42:19] in the sixth Dimension that that looked
[1:42:21] that way even in the early Christian
[1:42:24] Church it was not amongst them it was
[1:42:27] amongst the heathens the
[1:42:30] Romans the infidels the
[1:42:34] unbelievers let's B this
[1:42:42] together Lord Jesus how we love you
[1:42:44] tonight
[1:42:48] father Lord I'm so grateful that we have
[1:42:51] you to help us
[1:42:54] I can't imagine what's around us every
[1:42:56] day of Our
[1:42:58] Lives I know this Lord I would not want
[1:43:02] to live one hour without
[1:43:06] you I cannot imagine what your Prophet
[1:43:08] went through he he give us a little bit
[1:43:11] of an Insight he said he would go to his
[1:43:13] hotel room at night after he' cast out
[1:43:17] devils and them demons would come in the
[1:43:20] room and they would rub their flesh
[1:43:23] against
[1:43:24] him he would hear chains rattling all
[1:43:28] night
[1:43:29] long cuz they was angry and
[1:43:33] upset Lord help these young people to
[1:43:37] realize this is what's against
[1:43:40] them this is what tries to talk them
[1:43:43] into doing
[1:43:44] wrong May the adults the older people
[1:43:47] that are streaming this tonight may they
[1:43:50] realize the
[1:43:52] same may they realize that's what tries
[1:43:54] to make them get angry at their Pastor
[1:43:57] when he tells them the
[1:43:59] truth may they realize it's never the
[1:44:02] holy ghost that will anoint them to get
[1:44:04] upset at a preacher that preaches the
[1:44:07] truth but it's one of these demons I've
[1:44:09] described
[1:44:11] tonight oh but they keep their self hid
[1:44:14] because they know if these people
[1:44:16] realize it was them they wouldn't have
[1:44:19] nothing to do with
[1:44:20] it so they Veil theel
[1:44:24] behind a
[1:44:25] trend they Veil their self behind a
[1:44:29] fashion a modern
[1:44:31] look or this or that because they know
[1:44:35] if these young people and any other
[1:44:37] young people would ever see what that
[1:44:40] Demon's trying to lead them to they
[1:44:43] never have nothing to do with
[1:44:46] them Lord God May every preacher realize
[1:44:49] the
[1:44:50] same it's demons that will try to
[1:44:53] get them to compromise on the word get
[1:44:56] them to say things that's contrary to
[1:44:58] what the scripture the message
[1:45:02] taught they think they're using
[1:45:04] so-called wisdom how many demons have
[1:45:07] veiled thems under the cloak of wisdom
[1:45:15] socalled how many preachers have got
[1:45:17] under the inspiration of demons and have
[1:45:21] struck the move of God
[1:45:24] the move of the Holy
[1:45:26] Spirit Lord Jesus help us that we'll
[1:45:28] never do that
[1:45:31] father the prophet tells us it was that
[1:45:34] nicat and spirit in the first age that
[1:45:39] cried to get away from those screaming
[1:45:42] people that move of
[1:45:44] God I wonder if that same niat in spirit
[1:45:48] is not in the ranks of our message doing
[1:45:52] the same thing
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:55] Lord
[1:45:56] God we don't want to be stirred just by
[1:45:59] music Lord we want to have a love for
[1:46:02] you and a victory in our soul and there
[1:46:05] is no music
[1:46:07] around we want to have the shout of the
[1:46:09] king in our heart whether we're singing
[1:46:13] What A Mighty Fortress Is Our God or
[1:46:16] there's going to be a meeting in the
[1:46:18] air we love you
[1:46:21] Jesus Lord keep me from demons
[1:46:26] father I know this is only a small
[1:46:29] representation of the Youth of our
[1:46:31] church but I pray for them but I pray
[1:46:34] for the others that for whatever reason
[1:46:36] couldn't be here tonight
[1:46:38] Lord keep our youth Lord not only the
[1:46:42] youth but keep me
[1:46:44] Jesus Keep every one of the people who
[1:46:47] come here
[1:46:48] Lord may we
[1:46:50] realize what an army
[1:46:53] of hell is after
[1:46:56] us but Lord Jesus may we be be so hid in
[1:47:01] you that the devil can't find us in
[1:47:05] order to get to our soul he'd have to be
[1:47:08] saved Sanctified and filled with the
[1:47:10] Holy Ghost then he'd be our brother so
[1:47:13] there ain't no way for him to get us as
[1:47:16] long as we're hiding in you Lord
[1:47:20] Jesus we worship you toight father
[1:47:24] so Lord we don't want to be pumped
[1:47:27] up we don't want to just be emotionally
[1:47:29] stirred but there ain't one thing wrong
[1:47:32] with the spirit of God moving on us and
[1:47:35] our emotions becoming
[1:47:37] involved why in the world would I want
[1:47:39] to give you my emotions Lord if people
[1:47:42] go to sporting events and they go to
[1:47:45] dances and Honky Tonks and they'll dance
[1:47:47] the night away till the we hours of the
[1:47:50] morning what in the world's wrong with
[1:47:53] us giving you our heart our soul our
[1:47:55] mind and
[1:47:57] yes our
[1:48:00] emotions because as human beings you
[1:48:03] made us with emotions Lord as I reminded
[1:48:07] them of it last night in John
[1:48:09] 11 that Jesus wept what was weeping an
[1:48:14] emotional
[1:48:16] expression so before you spoke the word
[1:48:20] you expressed human emotions and then
[1:48:24] you cried out with a loud voice another
[1:48:28] human
[1:48:30] emotion may we get away from this old
[1:48:33] nickel and Antichrist Spirit that's
[1:48:36] trying to make us cold and formal God I
[1:48:40] refuse as long as I'm the pastor of this
[1:48:43] church for our church to turn into a
[1:48:46] dead cold formal Message
[1:48:51] Church Lord we want to be a church
[1:48:53] that's on fire with the baptism of the
[1:48:56] Holy
[1:48:57] Ghost oh

[1:49:04] Father Can We Stand
[1:49:06] Together God bless you I love you and
[1:49:08] the Lord I hope I hope something was
[1:49:11] said that'll be a blessing to
[1:49:13] you can we sing together can we just

[1:54:30] you I find
[1:54:34] my amen did you enjoy that I tell you I
[1:54:39] like the question and answers because so
[1:54:41] many times we're searching for the
[1:54:42] middle of the
[1:54:43] road and I think that's something that
[1:54:46] God has has put amongst us is to help us
[1:54:49] to to get in there where we can't find
[1:54:51] our a way we have somebody that can
[1:54:53] point us the way to the middle of the
[1:54:55] road and I'm so thankful that that God
[1:54:58] has given us a pastor with the wisdom
[1:55:00] and the understanding and the
[1:55:03] wherewithal to study the way he does to
[1:55:05] to help us find that middle of the road
[1:55:08] it's it I think sometimes we over we
[1:55:11] don't we take for granted with for what
[1:55:13] we got you know I had a somebody was
[1:55:15] telling me the other day
[1:55:18] about he's a renowned pastor of a church
[1:55:22] streams our
[1:55:24] services because we have a pastor that
[1:55:27] don't
[1:55:28] compromise and he's in the middle of the
[1:55:32] road and you you go as your pastor to us
[1:55:36] brother brandom said you your spiritual
[1:55:37] Shepherd if your shepherd's in the
[1:55:39] middle of the road your sheep are going
[1:55:40] down the middle of the
[1:55:42] road and then sometimes you have to have
[1:55:45] something like question and answers to
[1:55:47] heard you back to the middle of the road
[1:55:51] you know listening to what he was
[1:55:52] talking about emotions you we read in
[1:55:55] the scripture where it says the holy
[1:55:56] spirit will lead you into all truth
[1:55:58] that's not just
[1:55:59] word that's your actions your emotions
[1:56:04] things you do out in life your everyday
[1:56:07] life the Holy Spirit Will leads you in
[1:56:08] all truth you know he was talking about
[1:56:10] brother Brandon was talking about that
[1:56:14] emotion how he got on the pull pit said
[1:56:18] he didn't know where he
[1:56:20] was but what he said after that was he
[1:56:23] said I feasted on that for
[1:56:26] days I remember the time when I felt
[1:56:28] like the lord gave me the Holy Ghost 20
[1:56:30] something years ago so on a Saturday
[1:56:34] night I can't tell you what song was
[1:56:38] played I can't tell you if it was a fast
[1:56:41] song I remember brother Donnie fraying I
[1:56:44] remember him encouraging the people to
[1:56:47] worship and I remember hearing myself
[1:56:53] it's all I
[1:56:54] remember and this feeling that came over
[1:56:57] me I didn't
[1:56:59] care I didn't care where I was you could
[1:57:01] have put me on a street corner you could
[1:57:04] have put me in the middle of the mall I
[1:57:05] didn't
[1:57:06] care but when my brother Brandon made
[1:57:09] that statement I feasted on that for
[1:57:12] days I I remember that that's 27 years
[1:57:17] ago and I still feel
[1:57:20] it once you have that true experience
[1:57:24] you'll feel that for the rest of your
[1:57:26] life you know we talk about emotions we
[1:57:29] have human emotions there's a difference
[1:57:32] between human emotion and eternal
[1:57:35] emotion that Eternal emotion is when you
[1:57:38] walk to them
[1:57:40] Gates and you get
[1:57:43] consumed as the bride of
[1:57:47] Christ that's when you know it's real
[1:57:50] here when God gives you that here that's
[1:57:53] the same you know brother Bram says you
[1:57:54] take your character with you if you
[1:57:57] don't worship here you're not going to
[1:57:58] worship there when God gives you
[1:58:01] something that is is not even
[1:58:04] human your human nature cannot work up
[1:58:07] the kind of motion that the Holy Spirit
[1:58:10] brings a song can't work it up if you
[1:58:13] get to dancing and shouting because the
[1:58:14] song is fast you're going to forget it
[1:58:17] you're not going to Feast on that
[1:58:20] tomorrow but when that Holy Ghost comes
[1:58:22] in here and says this is where I want to
[1:58:24] shout that's right you'll shout for
[1:58:28] eternity from that moment on you'll
[1:58:30] shout inside through good times through
[1:58:32] bad times that shouting never ends
[1:58:35] there's sometimes he lets it become
[1:58:38] physical for other people to see so you
[1:58:40] can be contagious to somebody
[1:58:43] else so let's not forget that this is
[1:58:45] why I like love brother Donnie is the
[1:58:47] way he brings emotion and the gifts and
[1:58:49] how they're put in order in the church
[1:58:51] he's not in this side that's overboard
[1:58:53] that if you you don't have the Holy
[1:58:54] Ghost if you ain't doing it or you don't
[1:58:56] have the Holy Ghost if you do it too
[1:58:57] much you got the middle of the road and
[1:58:59] that's where the Bible has taken us
[1:59:00] that's where the Prophet took us and you
[1:59:02] have to have a pasture that take you
[1:59:03] down the same road so I hope you were
[1:59:06] blessed tonight man I sure was I I I'll
[1:59:09] be honest with you I I struggled today I
[1:59:12] did I don't want to get out of here so
[1:59:14] bad but that just when him saying tell
[1:59:17] my brother Brandon feasting on that for
[1:59:19] days I was like I can still Feast on it
[1:59:21] 20 something years AG ago I can remember
[1:59:24] that and know now I know who I am I
[1:59:27] never lost it so when God puts that in
[1:59:30] there that's why brother Rob talks about
[1:59:32] so much of coming together we need each
[1:59:34] other you might have a portion of holy
[1:59:37] ghost that needs to be contagious to
[1:59:39] somebody else that you've never even
[1:59:40] associated
[1:59:42] with so take that with you tonight if
[1:59:44] you go as absolutely wonderful if
[1:59:47] there's a question whether I should do
[1:59:48] it or don't do it don't do it you're
[1:59:51] safer that way
[1:59:53] so be mindful of the meetings coming up
[1:59:55] this weekend we're trying to work on
[1:59:57] some stuff for Saturday for the Youth I
[2:00:00] have to get with sister Rell and brother
[2:00:01] Michael Bailey to find out um how much
[2:00:04] portions of the gym if we can use any
[2:00:06] Saturday or not I don't know on that
[2:00:07] brother Ben Davis has offered to um cook
[2:00:10] some burgers and grills so I think
[2:00:13] brother Timmy and brother Tony Ward are
[2:00:15] going to try to help put activities
[2:00:16] together so be praying about that pray
[2:00:19] for the service got something that you
[2:00:20] need delivered from it can happen
[2:00:22] it can happen
[2:00:23] tonight but I believe the Lord's going
[2:00:26] to move for us so God bless y'all
[2:00:28] brother Jesse sing us something God
[2:00:30] bless
[2:00:31] you I don't think this is an old song I
[2:00:33] don't think we've sung it in a while but
[2:00:36] Heaven's Jubilee I thought about it
[2:00:37] tonight while we're sitting
