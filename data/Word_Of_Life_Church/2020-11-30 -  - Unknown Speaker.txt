for the Savior paid the price the wrath of God was satisfied that the shepher gave his life for the Sheep thank God the shepher gave his life for the Sheep aren't you glad the shepherd gave his life for the Sheep sheep I'm I'm so grateful for that but I'm so grateful I'm one of them greet you today in the name of the Lord I didn't think this week was ever going to end how long's been since we've been to church about 6 months man I know y'all think I'm crazy but join the crazy crowd to me there is nothing like coming together in the house of God presence of God saints of God look okay I'm all right was Turkey but nothing is like lamb they ate the lamb before the journey not the turkey and I miss it when we don't get together and have our portion of the land don't you God bless you let's turn today if you would to Isaiah chapter 53 verse 10 so appreciate the grace of the Lord today appreciate all of you that are here those of you that aren't here we certainly remember you as well uh may God bless you and strengthen you those of you that are streaming and like to be here and cannot may God help you U certainly appreciate all that the Lord is doing for us Among Us and all the different U testimonies that we're hearing of things that God's doing people getting he he brother Ron Spencer went back to the doctor and um um many of you may not have known it but he had had found cancer in his eyes and um he went back back for further test and they tested him for about 4 hours looking and looking and looking Hallelujah you know the rest of the story praise the Lord amen that's our God that's our God sir so we so so appreciate the Lord moving for our Brethren my there's just so many things that that are going on and we certainly appreciate god let's read about um the shepherd Isaiah 5310 this is part of his reconciliation through the act of kosis him humbling himself yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hasth put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin his soul and what about the blood isn't the blood the offering yes isn't his body an offering yes wasn't his human nature yes you see everything about him in his entirety was an offering but don't leave out the soul we didn't need more blood now we talk about I'm a child of the king oh yes oh yes his Royal Blood throws from my veins well Bill and gor Glory when they wrote that many years ago they had a good thought but it's not true right it's is simply not true we do not have the blood of Jesus in our veins you've got Reagan blood you know whatever you are spiritually yes but it was more than his blood it wouldn't do a bit of good if he could take the literal blood of the Lord Jesus and drain every drop of my blood out and put his blood back in me I'd still be a sinner because my problem was a soul problem but he will put him to grief and thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall isn't this prophecy he shall see his seed so this Messiah is promised to have a seed or a generation wow he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prom prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and he shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the SP oil with the strong isn't that just like our Lord the spirit God will divide him the portion with the great and what does Jesus do Jesus turns right around and divides his reward his inheritance with us that's greatness he shall divide the spoil with the strong strong because he ha poured out notice how many times Isaiah keeps using this word Soul he has poured out his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors he bear the sin of many many and made intercept I for the transgressors my I so appreciate him for that don't you how many like to be remembered today prayer certain good say Brother D back in church with us today brother's really been going through a lot in his body and certainly appreciate the Lord moving for him laughy to continue to remember my daughter Alicia if you would she's feeling better but still not um feeling feeling herself yet also Erica be taking her fifth chemo treatment tomorrow Monday Tuesday and Wednesday we certainly would you remember your prayers are there whatever your need is today your request in your heart let's hold it right there as we approach him shall we heavenly father just reading your word humbles us Lord it makes us feel so small when we read such Prof profound words for a mortal man to do this for another mortal man would have been something but for an immortal being which never had a start to be willing to cond in sin to such a level to do this for us it's truly amazing Grace how sweet to sound yes Father you saw all the hands that were uplifted today signifying needs requests the needs of your people around the world are so great Lord as the days go by and they turn into weeks and I hear from Saints of yours from South Africa from France from Europe from Zimbabwe from India from all over the world the needs that they have in their lives their homes their churches we pray God that you would be mindful of the needs of your children Lord we know that we say it often here that we are a needy people we don't say it to signify how great our needs are versus that you are weak but we signify to you that our needs are so many and we're taught by the prophet to bring our requests before you and to ask for many things lots of them and great things so we do not feel we're pressing the limit to ask for healing for every child of God we are not pressing your limit that oh my if we would just add one more request it would make you overdrawn in heaven for Lord God we could never overdraw the account of what's laid up in store for those that love you so we ask for many things today we ask for healing for peace for comfort for deliverance father we love you and we believe that you'll take our petition you'll Grant it according to your will now as we look into your word and we Endeavor Lord God to speak about your great things I pray that you would help me you see Lord I'm a poor feeble mortal dear God what could I say that would help anyone what could I do oh I could study I could apply myself and I've given hours of preparation to maybe 45 minutes to an hour of speaking but what good would that do if you don't come and anoint our hearts so anoint me anoint the people help them to pull father on what they have need of would you grant it Lord God in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated what a great sacrifice how could Spirit God be pleased with bruising IM mortal how could Spirit God take an element of pleasure by adding grief to a suffering human you know in the way that God views things it's so much different than we do in our minds and yet Isaiah is able to catch the epitome of that which is going to happen several thousand years after his prophecy I often wonder Brother Louie how it must have been for those prophets as they went into the realm of vision and they would see things that they probably would come back out and they would Ponder and wonder what could that mean who was that who was it about and it would leave them no doubt in a state of bewilderment that they were wondering was that a natural thing was that a spiritual thing that's going to happen what was it to see the Insight that God would have given them yet the mystery form that God would have kept from them and yet all they knew to do was just utter it and write it down was part of what they would say would come those in great words of thus sayeth the Lord but yet of part of their prophecies they would not actually say thus sayeth the Lord each time right we read of such here today but we're able to see by the inspiration of God given to these men as they were so inspired as David wrote in Psalms 22 and he again captured the great thing that was going to happen at Calvary but here God actually allowed David to enter so much into the prophecy it sounded like a drama it sounded like a play if you will that a person was acting out another person's position in something that had been or something that would be or something that could be right he just was wasn't sure but he felt such inspiration that he moved into this personal thing and it was almost like it was his personality if you listen real close you understand why God will have preachers to preach the way they do sometimes sometimes they will come in and begin to preach in the first person as if though it is them sometimes times they'll preach it as if though it's in the second person or the third person or they will preach it as if though they are a representative of the great person an understanding prophecy we know takes spiritual people to do so it's not like sitting down and reading a biography or an autobiography of somebody's life or picking up a newspaper today reading it in that sense but it takes people who know the author and they must be in the spirit of the great composer himself I like music I enjoy music and I always when I listen to something you know that's very very moving and I I like different compositions of music and I like one that was written many many many years ago called the swan it is the carnival of the animals and it is a classical piece and I've heard it performed by many different orchestras and they will feature either a violin or a a person that plays a cello they will take it and rewrite it for a cello or a guitar or whatever it might be and always Marvel because they will take the same sheet music and they will put a little bit of a A variation on it now the notes on a violin are somewhat different than that of a cello the cello is the the instrument that is the closest to the human voice so they say and that is the range by which it covers so it sounds more like a human voice so in the composition that brother renom referred to as Peter and the Wolf when it was being played that to use a violin or to use a guitar it would not be that which would represent the human voice so depending on what the comp composer would write he would choose a certain instrument that would be a concerto for a piano or it be might be the ninth composition in a flat minor or B flat or whatever he'd write and he would write it for a violin so well that's all well and good for a person to plays a violin but if they don't play a violin and they play a flute then they may have to take that same composition and rewrite it because their notes are somewhat different now there's notes that you can reach on a violin the the high SE some of the highest notes that reachable that you cannot reach on other instruments so you have to understand the music and the composition of the way it's written to be able to make sense out of the whole thing and God wrote his great story as a drama but he also wrote it as it was a great composition of music so in this phrase that we've read here today it is the composition of the father's drama that reaches a very sad place it's a place that lay in mystery form in the word for many many years people read it no doubt they tried to understand it so some of them probably thought it was the Messiah but by the time the Lord Jesus got there these scriptures were not some of the ones that they were actually looking for in the Fulfillment of the Messianic coming but they were looking for a messiah that would destroy Rome not sin so you don't find the Pharisees the ases the herodians you don't find them dwelling on the Prophecies of Isaiah 7:14 Isaiah 9:6 Isaiah 53:10 Isaiah 611 and 2 you don't find them dwelling on Micah 51 and two habac 3 Jeremiah 31 you do not find them emphasizing Zachariah 14 you do not find them putting their emphasis but it is on the serpent Bruiser of Genesis 3 it is on the coming one of Deuteronomy the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me so they were taking part of the notes if I can say it that way from the scripture and they were rewriting the composition to make it fit their day instead of making their thought line up with the composition you understand they were taking taking the music notes or the Messianic prophecies and were realigning them and they wrote their own music and they wrote their own story and they took the father's words and put it together in a different way and made it tell a complete different story so whenever he appears according to the original sheet music they look right at it and they knew it so well that they could roll up a scroll and take a pen and Pierce through that scroll and tell you every letter of the word that it would come across now that's I guess impressible I'm not sure what good it would do you I'm not sure what good that would help you to overcome sin but apparently they must have thought it was outstanding because they did do it that way but it didn't do them any good it gave them no understanding of the Messiah gave them no power to overcome but they could brag about what they could do I suppose so you find With Many religious people that's what religion is about it's how they're able to succeed and do certain things and then they're able to brag about what they are but what I read here this morning gives me absolutely nothing to brag about at all what I read about here today actually gives you and I are no other Mortal I don't care if they're a prophet if they're a pastor if they're evangelist a songwriter musician it gives none of us anything to brag about is that right so there's only one great one really that is among us and that's the the Lord Jesus himself now if this was a part of the father's drama or the Sheep music that they would have looked at and maybe because on this Brother Lou is's no thus sayith the Lord after each verse no thus sayeth the Lord after each statement now the same Prophet would come over and say thus sayeth the Lord I'll do this and I'll show you a sign well they could take that as thus sayeth the Lord but sometimes prophets would just be saying words and they wouldn't say thus sayith the Lord and others would look at it and say well that was probably just his opinion well it could have been but it might not have been well you could be in big trouble if you think it was his opinion but actually it was the word of the Lord am now we find that even in the day of course that we're living in is people want to do our message exactly the same way but notice then when we go that he was this was a part of the father's drama which had not been uttered quite so plain as certain prophecies about Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and so on some of them it was not necessary for God to conceal the mystery of what he was going to do but when it come to the Messianic prophecies it was so God would hide the person out of Christ becoming a human he would hide it all down through the scripture now God was the first one to prophesy of course and that was in Genesis 3 that there would be a serpent Bruiser and he had gave him the gender identification of being a he I hope that don't offend us he was a man that's right because he was the word and the word is in that person so God identified him himself that he would come and Bruise the Serpent's head and the serpent would bruise his again masculine gender that he would bruise his heel so then God would start letting out other things Deuteronomy 18:15 and then he would come down to judges and he would come down to the book of ruths and he would write the mystery of the Messianic power of redemption in the Book of Ruth but he would never say one thus sayith the Lord he would never say heay sayith the Lord God but he would write it in a story that he had been laying there for years and years and never completely understood until the coming of the Lord Jesus on the earth that he would take a gentile and marry her to Boaz a young woman to an old man Ancient of Days and in this symbol perform the act of kinsman redeemer now to many people that read the Old Testament they don't do not stumble them to this day still do not even consider the book of ruths to be part of the Holy Cannon of the Old Testament but to us it is one of the most precious books of the Bible now why is that it's because you have the matching piece of the father's drama or the composition from the Divine Orchestra written in your soul now you see for those who have that now you've seen it as well as I have that there are certain people and indiv uals and my goodness they never take a lesson in their life they never go to any formal training or teaching of music I'm not against that but yet they can pick up a Guitar they can pick up a harmonica they can pick up anything and just play it and you say oh my goodness where did you go to school well school what are you talking about school they never had a lesson in their life look at some of our musicians here at the church M most of these brothers if you would show them a treble Cass they wouldn't know where to eat it or they wouldn't know what to do with it if you show them some of that stuff about music but we got some very talented musicians and singers do we not and most of them like myself they couldn't read one note of music now we have people here who can read it and I'm not against that but you know there's such a difference in those that are gifted in the sense that God gave them I couldn't play a guitar I couldn't do nothing going to the little Holiness Church that I went to and they said they needed a guitar player so you know what they done they got me up on the platform and they laid hands on me and they asked God to give me the ability to play the guitar my mama showed me c g and e on a guitar and from there it went well my brother Harry never took a lesson brother Larry lots of these other brothers are the same never took a lesson sisters as well and yet you realize why because they were born with the music in them and there are great talented musicians that are world renown but if you would take their sheet music from in front of them they would not be able to play anything now I'm not down on those type of people but it seems they're missing something from within that links them to the composition of Music which cannot be read now listen to me if who knows exactly what the end time will be they may confiscate our Bibles they may try to take away our message tapes it may come to a spot in our nation who knows uh the you know the way that the left is leaning and all the things that they're doing I was just told just this week that in our neighboring country uh that they're going trying to pass a law that for anyone who goes to try to tamper with the gender of a child a parent will be sent to prison for 5 years for trying to talk their child out of being perverted that is lesbian or homosexual if a minister will minister to them and try to rehabilitate them a preacher can be thrown in jail for two years well think about it now that's just north of us so who knows exactly where it's going to come to uh before us but I don't care if they shut us down if they take our bibles if they take our tapes we already have it written inside of our hearts it may come to a spot that we have to quit streaming our services we already have folks that stream anyway that just stream to pick what I say well I welcome you today too I know who you are and I know that you stream just to pick and you stream to find anything in the service that you can find well you'll probably find it since I'm not an angel or since I'm not a lord God I'm just a human doing the best that I can but because of that there are people that will pick and this and that it may come to a spot that the brothers around the message will no longer be able to stream their services because they will be looking for this and look looking for that and looking for something else in order to get us in trouble with the law now this is the type of people believe it or not friends we are going through a religious persecution I hope you understand we've looked about it we've talked about it for years and years and who is doing a lot of it former message people that sat right Among Us they are under an anointing of a religious persecution you going to preach with me but you know what that tells me brother Dar and I talking about before I come out that tells me that the bride is closer to the image of the Lord Jesus than maybe we've been thinking because remember he not only walked on water raised the dead heal the sick cast out Devils but he was persecuted like no one else they sent people to his meetings so that they might be able to catch him in his words according to the Book of Mark according to the Book of Luke lawyers came tempting him to be able to set traps for him in his words and we have the same thing repeating again today but of course it's only happening among who the real people of God Amen I wonder if the bride's not getting closer to that image my we want Miracles we want Supernatural I don't want to just bear that image of the Lord Jesus I want to bear that image of one that is hated that is run down that is come on that is part of being the Bride of Jesus Christ he was the most hated individual that had ever been on the earth and you want to get out of here without being despised it ain't going to happen notice Isaiah says again in verse 10 it please the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his SE now not his soul only but also his body his whole human nature his blood his Spirit the Divine person that was made in the form of a human being so to make atonement and bring experation for our sins notice in Matthew 26:38 whenever Jesus has went out in the garden to pray he says unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful now no doubt his body was feeling pain already he he was feeling Agony but it was not just in his body or in his Spirit but in the Lord Jesus Soul he was starting to feel this exceeding sorrow my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death nobody else could ever say it quite this way Terry ye here and watch with me now notice in Hebrews chapter 9:13 for the blood of bulls and of goats and Ashes of AD heer sprinkling the uncan Sanctified to the p pu ifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through notice the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God so through the eternal spirit he offered himself now himself himself of course is the union of Soul spirit and body now he offers himself in a vicarious position standing for you and I he would be able to pay the price in order to redeem us I'm not talking about just being saved I'm talking about the bride being saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost having the very life of the Lamb of God himself living inside of us notice says who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God so Christ offered up himself freely voluntar ly and gave everything about him not only his Humanity but his divinity as well notice Ephesians 51 be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also ha loved us and hasth given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior so we were lost we were stinking as it was we were wretched out of the presence of God but the Lord God made a way through the perpetuation of the Lamb that the lamb could come and his blood would cleanse us his soul would be released and actually allow us to receive a part of his soul and then our bodies will be changed at the end time to be like un his own glorious body 1 John 2:2 and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not ours only but also for the sins of the whole world 1 John 4:10 herein is love not that we loved God your love of being a Christian has nothing to do with you choosing God first you loving God God loved you before you ever existed he chose you before the foundation the work and wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life thank you Lord oh thank God you're in his love not that we love God but that he loved us and send his son which is the word made manifest in the human body to be the perpetuation of our sins now notice in Isaiah also holds a mystery here which was part of the hebreas looking the way the Hebrews would look at hristic was the way that they embraced the hebrewism and one of the two things that they looked at as far as a blessing of God was Generations one of the greatest things that a man could live to see was not only his children but his children's children so if a man live long enough to see his children and his children's children and his children's children that man was considered to be so blessed by God in the way the Hebrews looked at it as longevity of life was a great blessing so then having long life was a tremendous bless in also having seed yet the Lord Jesus chose not to be married he chose not to be a married man in the natural but Isaiah prophesied he would have seed how was that possible if he's not going to be married unless of course his seed will come another way Glory notice he says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed so now here Isaiah taking that hebrewism and applying it over to the Lord Jesus only in a glorified form that the blessing of the spirit would be so upon him that he would actually see his seed well how words is he going to see his seed he'd never even married a woman when he was here but this is part of the blessing of God which will carry over not only from the Hebrew view of looking at but over into the Messianic Kingdom in the Millennium and also in eternity in the eth day notice he shall see his seed so the highest regard of the blessing given to what can't you see why that Abraham now in our modern society in the Western World you know if a man does not he doesn't have the ability to father children there's something wrong with him or his wife cannot bear children my it's a burden for many of them and they pray and they pray and even as sad as it is for us it's nothing like it was for them because for them it was part of your part of your blessing part of your posterity so for the Lord Jesus to not leave a generation coming to the Earth with their view now this is why Abraham so rejoiced that he was finally going to have a son and then his son had a son and his son had sons and on down it was the greatest height of the blessing of God on their life and yet the Lord Jesus is going to come to the Earth as the seed of of Abraham he's not going to be married not going to have a wife and he's going to have seed amen wow oh my notice Isaiah 538 he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation so there's going to be a generation of Christ amen Jesus's amen [Music] who shall declare his generation every day you live a Godly life you're declaring it now look friends many of us the older we get the more we look like our mama or our daddy or whatever more you know how that goes depends on whether you like the way they look whether or not you're proud of it I guess or you look like your Uncle Fred or you look like so and so and so and there just something about her maybe you got little ways that you do you know brother Homer Arnold always had certain things that he did and a certain smile about him I was privileged several years ago to get around one of his brothers I mean it it startled me when I got around him because he looked so much like him and certain things that he done thought oh my goodness this is unbelievable he he was so much like him but what was it was a strin that that run in that family you know it was just like oh my and so is it in a Divine strange in the family of God now brother Homer Honor's brother those of you that knew our brother what a precious brother he was if you'd never even know his brother's name but if you knew brother H Homer and you'd get around that man You' look and say I know I've seen you before somewhere you're acting like somebody that I've seen or I've known no not really just him but it was a jean tray that was inside of there put me and Peter side by side and you'd say y'all act God you're Brothers right put me in Paul side by side amen put me in James Side by come on Happy Valley put the first century church beside Happy Valley Church and what would people say y all act do preach behave just like they did thank you thank you that is a compliment to us now can you imagine put me beside a Catholic priest bige and I'm sitting there looking and say what he say and him looking over me and say what he say we ain't from the same family well praise God I'm glad I don't belong my people think they're bringing a shame and a reproach On Me by identifying me with Malachi for that's one of the greatest compliments after being saved and being filled with the Holy Ghost that you can do you want to brandish my name around the world and try to make me feel humiliated because of it my name's done been around the world and I humiliated friend I'm proud to be identified with Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 Malachi 456 I'm glad to be identified with the message of the end time it's the message that's going to get us out of [Applause] here hallelujah who shall declare his generation a question amen for he was cut off out of the land of the living now watch him approach approaching this in the form of a question of a consecutive generation of a paternal parent who will declare his generation he was cut off before he was able to get married who will be be his need how will he ever have descendants his soul you've heard the term soulmates haven't you glory to God he had no life or so they saw he had no seed so that's all he had no generation he was cut off in the land of the living but the cutting off made the way for the multiplication of his seat had he lived you and I could not B here to this day had he come to the Earth and healed the sick and walked on water and raised the dead and lived here for three years or 30 years or 3,000 years and never gave his life and went back to Heaven would still be lost today but because he chose the oh my The Narrow Path he chose a harder way the way of death Hallelujah that's my Lord that's my conquering Master because he chose that way he made a way for you and I to sit here today and be Redeemed by the power of the Holy Ghost to have our own nature our old husband annihilated and when they say who can declare his generation weak can say I do I do I am one of his seed I am one of his children I declare his generation he would have a holy seed a church of the New Testament St John 12 24 the Greeks come to Philip of beadia and said s we would see Jesus so philli bringeth them to John and John then of course brings them on to the Lord Jesus so they come to see Jesus and they make their introduction of HRA was they did these are Jesus introductory words to them St John 12:24 verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it Abid us alone but if it die it bring us forth much fruit what a [Applause] hello praise be to God what a how are you what a greeting what a Shalom oh can you imagine going to meet a person for the first time of your life and they say except a corn of wheat Dy oh my fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it shall bring forth more fruit and you're sitting there thinking I just wanted your name he gave you his name Oh Glory to God he gave you his name he gave you the interpretation of his mission on the earth he gave you the prophecy of what's fixing to come to pass he was the corn of wheat but he didn't want to live in Heaven by himself he didn't want just one like that but if God the spirit will plant him there will be another and another and another and another and another they will be all over the Earth filled with the spirit of God his generation Hallelujah Hebrews 2:10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto Glory notice the way Paul writes this he doesn't say bring folks that aren't his but bringing Sons to Glory St John 10 he says I am the Good Shepherd and I laid down down my life for the sheep and my father lth me all that ever become before me were thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them for my sheep know my voice Hallelujah to God Hallelujah to God aren't you grateful friends oh my some people you know it's so so sad that you're the Bible readed St John 10 30 I my father one 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy greatest and mystery of God unless God was manifest In the Flesh justifying the spirit seen of angels testified to the world preaching of the Gentiles all that they read that and they still see two or three but you read it and you don't see two or three what do you see the shepherd you hear the shepherd why you've got that part of the sheet music by representation identified in you oh my you don't want to be like beov you don't want to be like Bach you don't want to be like them you want to be like the Lord [Applause] Jesus listen this in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings verse 11 for both he the sanctifies and they who are Sanctified are all all of One his seed his generation for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren now imagine some of my siblings they might be a little bit ashamed that folks know Donnie Reagan's her brother that might be quite risky I don't know some of my family down in Kentucky they might not be very proud of me but as long as Jesus is I'm so glad that the Lord Jesus can come over and put his arm around me brother down and say how you doing bub glory to God you imagine to be servants to be a servant is more than I deserve but that he would call us brothers sisters in his economy not slaves not servant bow down before me I'll crack the whip no the family the family don't you see why Satan don't want you to see who you are don't you see why he tries to keep it away from you this is the way he sees you this is the way the Lord Jesus sees you he's not ashamed of you notice this in verse 12 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God has given me amen but he wasn't married he was cut off you kill an ordinary man he'll never be able to father children again you kill the God man you give him the you give him the opportunity needed to cause a child explosion wo Hallelujah you give him the needed opportunity for the s life to pour out of that corn of wheat which was the soul which allowed the very life of God to come out and regenerate regenerate regenerate regenerate it's still regenerating to this very day Satan has tried to burn it he's tried to stomp it out he tried to crucify he'll never do it why because his generation will be declared to the last seeds brought in behold I and the children which God has given me for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him wake up devil listen what's fixing to happen to you old boy destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil don't you understand why he's raging like never before he knows his time is short at hand church folks sitting around asleep a lot of folks sitting around asleep but the devil ain't asleep that's why he's fighting with everything he's got so what does the new birth do to us what this the prophet said they become a new creature you're a new nature they're they're a new being a new creature that the Greek word says a new creation it's a new creation you've been recreated again from what you were to the image of a Son of God or a daughter of God it's just an all it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a sinner can be made to become a Christian praise be to God I wonder if we shouldn't get up every day and thank God we are the greatest Miracle one of them that God ever did or you just say well I'm saved well I'm saved there's no way in the world this Revelation is Shing our hearts like it ought to we would not go around brother Louis with our chin hanging down around our bootstraps we would not go around but so down and so defeated all time you are the greatest miracle that has ever been in God's creation for God to take you a sinner man a sinner woman lost as we would say on your way to hell as we would say and God transforms you and actually oh my changes your whole being takes that old nature out and puts in part of his own divine nature and sets you to music glory be to God and your oh Hallelujah your life your steps your talk your speech your behavior what is it doing it's playing out the Divine Symphony Of [Applause] God watch's this in question answers please explain the difference between the spirit and the Soul what well now that's a hard one he says the first thing you are a Triune being just like Father Son and Holy Ghost oh so you're a triing being so when God made man in his own image he was talking about not images as in two men took jesus' nose took the father's ears took Jesus hands and the father's lips the spirit only has one image and that's Jesus but when he made man in his own image it involved the mystery of what God was that he was the invisible the great spirit but he had a visibility about himself which was the condenscending form which at that time was not Jesus but it was the word and then God would condense in in order how many has the spirit of God in you today you have the SP of God so does that mean there's all these different versions of the Holy Ghost well now do you have if if if if' God now it's just one person if I've got him all the rest of y'all is deceived you ain't got God you just think you got God if God's only one person can only live in one house cuz I know I got it if name of one person in the going to the rapure out of Happy Valley you're looking at him and y'all ought to feel exactly the same way you say sorry brother Donnie it ain't you it's [Applause] me but God had a condescended form in spirit form which is holy spirit or Son of God down through the church ages not the physical body now so you can have him you can have him you can have him he can be dwelling all over the Earth today in the Tabernacles of humanity and it doesn't weaken his presence one bit in heaven what is it a condensation of the father again in spirit form Jesus was the condensation of the father in human form the holy SP the holy spirit is the condenscending form of that Eternal God and a multiaspect body that he can live all over the world at the same time Hallelujah and them scattered thousands of miles apart notice he says father son Holy Ghost is three titles to one person which is Jesus Christ and you're soul body and spirit but it takes those three to make you which is one of them you're not you it takes the three to make you now watch skipp on down a little bit in this and he said the soul is the nature of that Spirit then when the Holy Spirit comes upon you it does not do nothing it changes or converts your Spirit to a different soul lord and that soul is a different nature that's on that spirit so the soul is the nature of your spirit first you were mean and evil and hatred where's where's drinking and smoking and it's amazing to me friends how folks limit worldliness to drinking and smoking and running around and they can be as mean as I don't know what meanness is an attribute of the devil hatred is an attribute of the devil notice how he talks about that we're converted what we're converted from Evil hatred Mal stri now you're loving sweet kind see the difference it's your nature well I'll call it that it's your soul that's been changed amen ladies and gentlemen due to the power of this next quote we invite you to buckle up your seat belt bend over and put your head between your legs and get ready for a fast takeoff the old soul Di and the new Soul which is the new nature Was Born Into You Paul said the same thing except he used the terms old man new man notice again you must be born again so in order if you're born again you got a new parent then you got a new nature the old Nature's dead and you got a new nature you once was going one way now you're going another way you was once going this way down now you're going this way up your affection are set on things above new affection you don't love the things of the world no more you're affections of God a new nature a new being a new creation nature of your father and you believe and love every word that he said amen Every Man's word is a lie contrary to his word and this is God's word say the Bible that's right I don't care what the church says the Bible's still right to you cause your Nature has been changed you see even when you were a little boy or a little girl there was something in you that was different I'm thinking right now of a great violinist from Indiana from the United States in the state of Indiana this music was born in him yet nothing like it was in his parents or grandparents but they would go to his room and find him taking rubber bands and stretching a rubber band from one dresser drawer to another and plucking on that rubber band and pulling the drawer out and it would expand the tension on the rubber band and change the tone or the key of the rubber band now brother Jeremy don't you go home and play the rubber bands this now where did he get that he had not gone to school yet where didd he get it the music was born in if you ever heard him play you can see it you can hear it hallelujah amen when you were a little boy or a little girl there was something in you then [Music] [Applause] yes I might inject a little bit of Doctrine here if you don't believe it it's quite all right I do I believe that when you was a little boy a little girl there was a seed placed inside of you he said God rich in Mercy 1965 you want the page paragraph date you want the auditorium name he preached in there was a little something inside of you seemed like it didn't bother other kids but there was something inside of you Oh Glory to God what was it oh you didn't know how to stretch the rubber band you didn't know how to find your way to God and you run around and done this and that and the other but God said That's my boy that's my girl right there she's not playing my music now she bopping her head and dancing to the devil but after a while I'm going to get a hold of her Hallelujah after a while I'm going to get a hold of my boy and I'm going to set his feet on the right path he's going to walk down the bars of the music he's going to March down through that praise God he's going to do what I want him to do he's going to say what I want him to say That's my boy that's my girl that's my daughter that's my son they belong to [Applause] me you know what we all started out with the first first notes of her redeemed life sing gra God save me God forgive me God help me what was happening just finding your place in the bars between the music what was your first notes repentance repentance and be baptized what were you doing following the Sheep music of Acts 238 oh glory to God it might have been 10 years from the time you repented till you found the right water baptism but you finally found it or may I say it found you you went down and titles you was baptized in the Baptist Church and the Church of God in the Presbyterian and one day you got baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah God setting you right in line with your part of the composition we're just born a Christian by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ we are Christians by birth that makes us new creatures in our old nature we could never be Christians you see this is the way that many folks believe and preach Redemption and salvation they're preaching it's that old man you get it that old man and God kind of washes him down and scraps him over the little bit of coox and you know just slaps him around a little bit hits him and pulls him out of there praise God he's brand new no no he dies [Applause] that's the reason today we have so many calling themselves Christians and live any kind of Life they've never experienced that born again that's something that changes you and takes that life out like pulling the blood out of a man that's got a certain type of blood and putting another type in him it's pulling the life out of the man and injecting the Life of Christ in The Believer and then he becomes a new creation amen Romans 6:6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve don't you understand the difference between a Christian making mistakes and your life as a sinner in Sin Sin was your master that's right but once you get converted you changed ownership you're not your own you belong to him you've got another Master but brother Donnie will I make mistakes every day of your life till your Humanity has changed but you are not serving sin you hate sin you despise sin and Satan lays a snare for you and catches you in your weak time and you have to say oh Lord please forgive me I didn't mean to say that that Lord I didn't mean to do that I fell short of your glory why because sin's no longer your [Applause] master by the old man what is it very same thing the prophet said used a different term it is the corruption of our first nature and it rolled us dominated us it told us to drink we drink it told us to act like an idiot we acted like an idiot we smoked we took somebody else's wife somebody else's husband we made fun of the people of God Paul said he blph ignorantly come on now what is it the poison left from the original serpent bite the Venom of a toxic Fallen nature was injected into the human race after the bite of the serpent but God says I will produce the seed which will kill that night brother so let the devil call up let him say I'll do this and I'll do that but we can look at old Copperhead right back in the face and say you ain't got no teeth you ain't got no poison on me you ain't got no hold on me because I done got injected with another injection and it ain't serpent in them Hallelujah the Lord Jesus didn't give me a little antidote to kind of help me every now and then well you know I can't keep from saying I got to go out and run around on my wife I got to do this that and other oh no he didn't give me a little antidote that would help me till the next time he'd give me an absolute cure that took the Venom the Venom of the serpent by out of my soul and said here Donnie here's a complete new [Applause] nature cuz if God only patched up the old one the serpent Fang marks still be in me man we're just now getting to the good part knowing this that our old man is crucified that the body of sin you see sin is conceived as a living power Paul addresses it as if though it's an organism a living instrumentality don't you understand why people cannot quit sinning this is actually a reality in Sinners not only in Sinners but those that are saved and some of them even Sanctified that's why they don't have the power to quit doing stuff they can quit it for a week or two or a month or three and they go right back to it again why the serpent the old nature right is still there praise be to God Romans chapter 6: 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin now I know we've read these statements here I'm fixing to read you again but they are so good I just figured this might be the one two three punch that would knock the devil out invisible Union I'm telling you what I've been listening to it for about the last month and a half over and over sometimes three and four times a day and you don't know what you miss but not doing that oh man then I say where was I at the other time was I on Mars somewhere what in world was I at that I missed this listen this you must be dead to your first husband if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulteress you are a Leo deia to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is Christ in the beginning was the word oh my was when the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us as long as you hold to man's tradition of denominations you're called in God's word an adulteress the first life of your first Union you were joined in at Birth so you got born and got married the same moment think of it when you took the breath of life you were born right and married to what brother Donnie your first nature now if you look real close you'll find out in this natural act on the earth when you really become married to Christ the word many of you have been in church for years and years you wasn't ready filled with the Holy Ghost oh you got tongues you got this and that and the other some of you satting while a man of God was preaching the word and it moved from your spirit right over into your soul and when that move took place and your soul was born regenerated look at the word regeneration it is regenerated you got regenerated that's when you were recognized in your position on the earth as being a part of the bride of Christ that's why you were satisfied being called a Baptist or being called a Methodist or a Church of God well I go to this church that church why was a longing inside of you to want to be called bride why was it because it's a bride call going out and when did you realize it when did something start forming in you when you took the breath of spiritual life and God breathed into that ging seed of yours Lord have mercy what happened to you a recognition be to come to that seed I no longer call you church but I'll call you Pride you were remarried or reunited to another nature the first life of your first Union you were joined in at burst by Nature a natural act a natural human being associated man and woman together in sexual Affair which brought your first life here that's associated with sin and death how can you miss sing the serpent seed he said it was nature associated with death your first husband that had the rule over you was your nature when did you get married when you were born someone you said I do [Applause] Hallelujah when was it the Gen of God become quicked and we answered to him from the soul something pulling on us we couldn't identify it we didn't even know what it was many of you run from God just like I run from God you run from the great truth of the word of the hour but you couldn't get away from it nothing in this world there was something inside you calling there was an eagle of a seed down inside of you Hallelujah when was it your soul receives the Breath of God it's one thing I love about that eagle story brother Bram talks about it many places but invisible Union when he talks about it he said that little Eagle down that barnyard looked up and he saw a creature in the sky like he wanted to be now can you imagine him wanting to be that and all he ever knew was come on honey mama he get them big old

husband you can't live with you can't just say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here till the occasion no sir no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every spec of him and you have to be reunited again with another nature amen another husband praise God another husband which takes place when your other birth then things begin to make sense things you wondered
