together thanking God for his Mercy to us Brother Louie mentioned there on Wednesday night I've already heard so many awesome testimonies of what our lord Jesus did and those of you that were delivered and helped just remember that devil may may try to aggravate you again but you stand your ground on the promise of God's word and remember that God does not lie he can never make a promise that he canot kick amen amen certainly glad to see each of you here today and we just um appreciative that the Lord's given us this time together that we would be able to minister unto him Minister unto him we've not just come today to receive but we've come to minister back to our lord Jesus I know you're looking at me funny but you'll you'll understand it a little bit better before we read the scripture um I wanted to say again how much I appreciate all that um has been going on over in our fellowship hall all the flood blood relief and things that our church has been doing also want to say how much I appreciate all of our friends and sometimes people we don't even know that have sent thousands times thousands of dollars to be able to funnel through the church here to be able to buy heaters uh propane gas generators just all kinds of things people have sent clothes from I think 12 or 13 different states uh box trucks tractor and trailers just everything thing you can imagine even a helicopter landed out there the other day and brought fresh bread so I'm glad God didn't send us a helicopter he sent us an eagle praise the Lord cuz we needed fresh bread in this end time too didn't we not amen so we're so so grateful for that and um I know we've still got a bunch of stuff over there yet and we're just praying the Lord will help us to be able to distribute to those who are needy as the weather is getting cold already somebody shared the other day that 13 or 14 people had already died in the mountains when it got cold because they didn't have proper heat and stuff like that so let's pray that God will be merciful to them and help us to be able to find them and do what we can um we just want to say we appreciate it there's been churches all over the message that have sent um sent money bunch of them have sent um uh sent um clothes and just all types of things it's just amazing to me how the people have have reached out during this time frame and I want to say to each of them we're grateful for all that you've done for all the our church here it wouldn't do any good if they'd send all that stuff if we didn't have people here that would be willing to take their time some of them take off work as I've said before bring their children there in the fellowship all and watch their children while they try to do all that all the brothers that have um taken all the stuff and distributed it we could have all kind of stuff over what good was it do if they have brothers is willing to do it and I'm going to tell you something I've been on some of those places and some of those places are very dangerous and very risky I'm grateful that our brothers were willing to do that are you amen I'm so thankful that good also I want to say to you that not only have they been given things like that but different ones of them have been praying for different people they into different ones and they're sending a lot of our supplies churches in Western North Carolina and trade Tennessee different places like that are becoming the receiving station like from us and we're giving it to them and then people come into the churches and um several different Brothers have been able to pray for people that's got needs and we're grateful for that we so appreciate that different ones of them from different places so they're coming here to church to see us sometime we'll see how that goes won't we anyway some of the um people even from our local community have come in to try to help distribute and help do things just whatever they can do around the church here and I myself I appreciate that they ain't no telling what they've heard about us there ain't even no telling but to be able to come and to be willing to do that I'm grateful for it and I know that uh some of the Saints here some of the brothers as well when they go out they go to asking about our church and different ones we've inv Ed different ones even from the community to come if they want to come sure come check us out so just in case you see somebody that may not dress quite like we do and they might look a little different act a little different you know what the Lord may let us reach that very last one so let's not be too critical to judge them let's just pray if there's something there that we will be able to share not only a box of Cheerios and a BN box of Pringles and all kinds of water but let them sense Jesus Jesus sent us is that your desire My too that's exactly what we want amen um I wonder how many of us have a need a request in our heart today we'd like to make know before the Lord before we pray have a sister Branda Harmon with us again today and she's been through a um hip replacement had a really difficult time with all that glad to see you sis back in the house of the Lord today God bless you Brother Lou already mentioned it but brother Glenn tamson we're certainly glad to have him his wife with us today in the service we pray the Lord for our Brethren we're just thankful for what the Lord's doing for him and we believe he's going to complete the work in his life don't we amen so we want to pray over this prayer clo too as we pray let's just hold our needs before the Lord Heavenly Father we have so much to thank you for that we basically could take the entire service the entire day the entire month if each one of us would give praise just for the things that we know you've done there ain't no telling how long it take us because you've been so good to us we want you to know we appreciate it father we even appreciate the trials that you will in your wisdom allow to come our way because there's something about trials that produce something in us that even Miracles won't produce we love Miracles we love healing we love Deliverance but yet trials and test produce a character in your people that the miraculous will not for we know that when you were here on the earth you performed many many miracles to all kinds of people and yet when it comes right down to that where were many of those people whenever you were dying on the cross hid away ashamed did not want to be identified with you because the reproach was so heavy and it could have cost them their life so Lord Jesus that's the kind of love for you we want oh I love you when I I see you do the Miracles I love it I love it when I see you deliver your children but Jesus I thank you that your love holds us strong even when we're going through trials and we don't understand why and we're trying to sort through it all and make sense of it all and a lot of times we just can't do it but thank you that your love holds us then father you see this prayer cost I have on my hand today I'll preach with it Lord and we're just believing you for a complete recovery for our sister Brenda you see what she's been through father other great needs here in our assembly today you saw the hundreds of hands that were uplifted signifying something that's important and of value to them would you minister to them today Father no doubt I'm the most needy person in this building today for one mortal to try to take the word of God and speak something to souls that are sick hungry thirsty needing things oh God I need you help me shut my mouth to anything that would displease you may I be a channel today by which the Holy Ghost can flow through me we'll commit it all to you Lord God and give you praise for eternity for the results in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you let's U turn to filimon again today I love this little big book not many chapters not many verses but it has some powerful powerful things in it we know all of God's word of course is powerful fimon 1 verse 5 Paul writing to a brother which had become converted under his ministry and the great things that God had done for him he'd grown a lot in the Lord and the Lord had been able to bring him from like the rest of us a life of sin but Paul wants this man to be able to understand not only written to him of course but people down Through the Ages that there's a way by which a Believer can grow even further I think we all want that don't we notice how Paul starts this about the brother hearing of thy love and Faith which thou H has toward the lord Jesus and toward All Saints I want you notice he does not mention the length of his hair he does not mention the garments that he had on he does not mention which group that he belonged to because by this time there was already several groups in the first century church but what he heard about this brother was his love love and his faith not just toward the lord Jesus notice hearing of thy love and faith which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus and toward those Saints who you really like and those who are your favorites oh my on no toward all all saints that they communication of thy faith may become effectual now the word communication is coia so it is a fellowship wow so you mean Faith needs to be communicated it's got to be communicated that the communication of thy facei may become effectual we looked at this word let's look at it again it's Greek word by which we get our English word energy from but it's powerful and active so your face can become powerful and active and this is the way it'll happen by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus so acknowledging is eposis precise and correct knowledge not just knowledge precise on and correct knowledge precise that's the way the smart bombs have become in our age that Israel uses that America uses so I I saw some video not long ago of a bomb and they had a an abandoned tank setting out in the desert and this F-16 was flying you know MCH one whatever it was over the desert sends this bomb launches it out of this F F-16 fighter and they have a camera on this bomb and as it's going down moving this speed and as it's going down they video it and they put it right down the manhole of that tank now a lot of the nations of the world are still using the bombs that have no intelligence so they're not smart bombs that's the way a lot of Christians are trying to fight the devil they've not updated to Malachi 4 now under this ministry of the last day God has precise bombs so the Holy Ghost can be able to come and anoint a preacher to where he'll go right to where you live is that right he'll stand up and say things that you talked about before you come to church is that right we've all had it happen to us so what is that that's God using using a precise bombb to go exactly to where that it needs to go now watch this so what Paul said the way faith is going to be energized is by being able to use precise and correct knowledge so apparently there can be an incorrect knowledge so you have knowledge but you're not applying it in the correct way and what good does it do us so it's precise and it's correct correct knowledge used of the knowledge of things ethical and divine that the communication of thy face may become effectual energized by the acknowledging precise and correct truth of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus Philippians 4:8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any praise think on these things look at the meaning of this word to take into account to make an account of this word word deals with reality if I log as a mail or reckon that my bank book has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving myself the word refers to facts not suppositions may the Lord bless his word you may be seated Ephesians 2: 6 Paul goes on to say that he has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now you're talking about a group of people that are so blessed by God whoever these are whether they are Japan Africa India America whatever the state they're in around the in the United States whether they are Black White whatever the race their ethnicity doesn't really matter Paul doesn't even deal with that but he says in Christ Jesus so he's raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now I want them to speak to you again today is the right we've been talking about the bride's rights and we remember of course the lord gave me this thought however long ago it was about our bill of of rights which was given to us by our founding fathers after they gave us the Constitution then they decided sometime after that December 1795 they brought it into what they call ratify our Bill of Rights and it would give us these Bill of Rights and they started out with 10 10 rights that as American citizens you would have no matter where you come from if you come in here the right way you might be born here several Generations or you might immigrate into here and you will be able to receive that same Bill of Rights by the law that belongs to every one of us that are American citizens well if America did that for their their occupants and their inhabitants of America what about the Lord what he has done for us as his people but you know a bully could come in and try to tell you you don't have a right to this and a right to freedom of speech and you don't have a right to have a far and you don't have a right to be represented in court and you don't have a right and if you don't know your rights that enemy could convince you you don't have it but if you know your rights you'll be able to say them look this is my Bill of Rights as an American citizen my grandfather come here from wherever my father was born here I have a a US citizenship it is mine you're not taking away from me my right to be able to have a representation in court I have a right to be able to be a US citizen I have a right and you are not taking it from me now a lot of us when it would come to our American rights we would fight to our last breaths I wonder why we don't do it when it comes to our spiritual rights you have a right to peace you have a right to happiness you have a right to Joy you have a right to Healing if you're sick today you got a right to a supernatural move in your body come on preach with me today so no matter what you got going on in your life God has covered everything that you have need of and you've got a right to but what's amazing is you'll have to fight for every right that you've got is that true now just because it's yours don't mean that it'll fall in your lap you were born with those rights as American citizen I wonder how many of us here today even know what the first 10 were anybody anybody even know what they were and not amazing now you see if we had been former uh Chinese people from communist China I find this amazing that allot the immigrants had come to America and whenever they would come from Venezuela they'd come from China maybe from Russia whatever it was when they come in and through immigration they find out that they can become an American citizen you know the wor the first things that some of them people do they want to find out what is their rights what what what's what belongs to me so instead of us we were born in it oh yeah grandpa said something about it I don't even know what they are I don't guess it really matters oh but it does matter but who is it that appreciates it so much those that never had it so if you were a communist China and then you come into America one of the first things they want to do is find out so what does the Constitution say what does the Bill of Rights say what is mine you know brother bandam called it like an arcade and he said if you go into an arcade and he said said that someone gave you that and it had all these things in it so you go to pulling out every drawer and you'd open up every door to find out what's yours and he said if there was something up high that I couldn't be able to reach it I'd get a ladder and I'd open the door and I'd go up there and find out what was mine why he was curious as to what was his well as the bride of Christ we know that we have a great responsibility in being bride but we know also we have many many blessings and whatever we have need of I believe from the stage of our journey to where we start that drawing from the Lord and we come to him through sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then we start lay laying in the presence of God him revealing to us his word then it is this journey and as we go along our needs will change as it does naturally when I was a young boy I didn't need many the things that I need now as an older man whenever I signed up on Medicare years ago and I started getting this Catal in the mag in in the mail and it was for things for people like Carol and I and United healthc Care and it started having all these things that you could pick out diapers for old people and uh hearing aids and hearing this and and pain patches and this thing are you kidding me and I thought I don't need all that do I maybe I do I don't know that I do but I thought you know my needs a as a man they have changed somewhat since I was when I was a boy and it's the same way when we grow in the Lord that initially you may deal with sins in your life and this thing and that thing and you're kind of immature and you're growing and you're learning and then as you do you put that behind you and you go on and God and you look back and think wow that was so hard for me to overcome that was so difficult for me to put under my feet but thank God it's behind me now and then you look at things that you're facing now sometimes they be more complex aren't they and they're more difficult sometimes and what they were when you were a younger Christian because the devil is allowed listen to me by the allowance of God to be able to hit us in a way once we become more mature than he ever did when we first got saved you remember when the children of Israel left the land of Egypt and God sent them a certain way now he could have sent them a shorter way which would have been a shortcut they would have reached that land a lot quicker but the Bible said that he would not not send them that way because they would have many many enemies they would have faced and he said it would L they would become discouraged in the way so the shorter way might be this way would say but here was an enemy there was another there was another there was another but yet God may send them way around this way and go way back there to get to it there's not near as many enemies but it'll take them a lot longer now whenever we grow and mature in the Lord then Lord can allow us to be tested in such a way that we would have never thought possible when we were a young Christian can anybody say Amen to that today but you look back and you realize that God trusts you and I now in order to do that we must have then our position in the Lord Jesus now I'm not talking about just by 1 Corinthians 12 where by Spirit we are baptized into the body but I'm talking about us finding our place in Christ Jesus by this logo as Paul uses the word that it is a precise and correct knowledge that we know who we are and with the anointing or without it we still stand upon the promise of the word notice in Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them this is who I am as a child of God I believe a predestinated life follows a predestinated seed people who just talk about predestination all the time and they're a seed and they're a seed and live ungodly and live like the devil they don't even understand what predestination is because there is a holy life that a predestinated seed is ordained to have there is an overcoming life that a predestinated seed is ordained of God to have notice in verse 12 that at that time you were without Christ being aliens for the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope now this was us Gentiles having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who were sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ second Timothy 1:9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus the night you went down to the Altar and got sa no it was given to you in Christ Jesus before the world ever began as a matter of fact before there was a devil I done had my inheritance in him amen before there was ever a sickness before there's ever a cancer before there's ever a trial I was given complete victory over every trial I'll ever boy brother sister you can't beat that I'm talking about this is what your allocation and your allotment is but it won't do you any good if you don't rise and claim it now sometimes God is here to help our faith and Paul even mentioned about those in the New Testament that were helpers of people's Faith now that's what a minister is supposed to be he's supposed to be a helper of people's faith and there's times that our faith will actually be strong enough with a little bit of assistance from our brothers and sisters and they come and stand with us your faith and our faith together will help us to be able to attain that Victory but there's other times in our life your face and my face and the fa of the Church Believers believing with you will not be enough sometimes it actually takes the faith of God himself God himself in you believing his own word now please don't misunderstand me actually when that happens you don't even my need my faith with you then you don't need the faith of your wife nor the faith of your husband because you have received the face of God believe it or not that's what's going to make the consummation of the body change now you know that there are many battles that we will face and God does not step in supernaturally every time and let us have access to his face because we would be so spoiled we're already spoil rotten anyway and we'd be even worse if every time we faced a hard trial that he just dropped that face in our hearts and he believed through us and this simply happened but you know what he'll do he knows when we're in those urgent times that we simply cannot do it it was by that that Abraham was able to attain to the promise of a body change we know the prophet said Sarah actually never did believe I mean she fell constantly short of the glory of God and it was God's mercy that was given to us I've been there the same way many times I'm sure you have too to where my faith just does not seem like it could reach that place where it needed to be but aren't you glad he's there to help us now what once God gives us this position in him it's for us of course it's for our family if you're married it's for you and your spouse you have children it's for the whole family that God can be able to use you you see this is part of the economy of God that God didn't just save us and say well y'all go to church every now and then live pretty good life you know be a pretty good person kind of be moral if you can and try to be honest if you can if you can't understand you know if you have to lie a little bit every now and then and and just try to do the best you can and then whenever you get to heaven I I'll make everything perfect for you that that's not salvation that's not the new birth but God wants us to be Overcomers while we're living right in the middle of H H believe it or not you are a paradox this morning you are living in an insane world you're living in a demon possessed world the lid was tore off the kettle in 1961 Satan's headquarters at one time was in Paris France he's moved around several times and he's followed civilization at one time of course it was across in the Middle East and then it became in Paris France then it moved again it moved to where not Washington DC see but Hollywood so out of Hollywood then Satan began to being his new headquarters he began through movies and media and so on be able to try to control the minds not only the American people but of the world but we know that when he does that that the spirit of the Lord is here to lift up a standard against him so is it any Wonder to us if the devil moved his headquarters into the United States that God would send a prophet not from France not from Portugal not from Poland but from where America why Satan raised up and made a challenge to God God said fine I'm here already I've got a boy born down here in Kentucky and I'm going to have my word to be able to manifest through him I'll have a group of people right in the middle of your Paradise devil they'll live right they'll be right they'll not take your mind but as a matter of fact they'll have my mind they'll believe the word they will stand against everything you do not only that I will try them to such a place they won't even understand sometimes what's going on they won't only just meet you devil but they will meet me and they will pray about certain things and I will emphatically say no to them and you know what they'll do they'll love me anyhow they'll serve me anyhow I don't want to serve God just When God says yes that's the kind of God a lot of people want they ask God for this and God says yes they ask God for that and God says yes they ask God for that and God says yes I want to be the type of believer and I am that if God tells me no I say Lord your ways are perfect Lord you make no mistakes you know come on somebody don't you want to be the type of believer that if the Lord says no David you can't have that no Dave you can't have that no Freddy you can't have that you say praise God I love you anyhow Lord praise God you made no mistakes Jesus oh my I don't want to be the type of believer in this salt lay of sin age God has to put me in a bubble and he can never try me he can never test me he can never let hell come against me but I want to be the type of believer that not only can I overcome demons not only can I overcome powers of hell but if the Lord God wants a wrestling mes like he did with Jacob and the Lord throws me in the ring and I'll say Lord this ain't Fair Lord this ain't fair I can't wrestle you and yet God says come on Donnie come on can you believe me I'm going to to pull my anointing away from you I'm going to hear your cry but I'm not going to answer I wish somebody would preach with me this morning I'm going to I'm going to let you go through things you're not going to understand that when I come out on the other side I might be limping but I'll be a limping Prince Hallelujah I might have went in there and I might been able to walk on my own accord I might need help when I come out on the other side but what I do I will be a believer that can stand and say I love you with all of my heart now let me get to what I opened up with that we're not just called to minister to people and the Lord has helped us in the last months to be able to minister to people from our church in a way that we've never quite done before and it don't mean we'll ever do it again but for whatever reason God allowed us to be able to minister to people that have come through this storm and and flood and all this stuff that happened a bit ago it was not orchestrated by us but I believe God allowed it to happen that's what God wants us to do so we do it for the occasion we also are called to minister to the Saints but even greater than those two if you're bride today you are called to minister to almighty God amen amen now how can you minister to anyone who does not have some sort of need so if you haven't been over the fellowship hall in a bit you need to look at it cuz there's water sitting everywhere our Pavilion down yours full of stuff and some of the places we've been taking they say you know back off a little bit cuz we got so much stuff so we're trying to find more people that need this stuff so you can only minister to people who have needs well how could God have need of anything you see it's the way he projected himself in eternity there was no one there but him the logos was not there light was not there Darkness was not there there was nothing but him there was not even one angel he was just the Eternal but then he began to project the thoughts from his mind and he out of his own being then he comes to a form which is himself but in a form that can need something if not you wouldn't be here today so what is it an act of condensation astion so the logos comes out of the Eternal as a little flickering light a little white light that comes out of the Eternal God giving birth to a son the Son of God the Loos if you understand the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your soul real good you'll understand what you got when you got to Holy Ghost you're part of the logos I'm just talking about now Aus strect I'm talking about your portion of God hallelujah so he starts expanding himself into a form which can need something a a form that can reach out and can be touched that could touch and be touched love and be loved and in this form he allowed this to be so that oh Lord help us that he would appear in this form with great needs himself and so make himself that he is not complete without you praise be to God now watch in Exodus 28:1 this is God instituting the aonic priesthood now remember the reason that God gave this was because the people themselves up to this time the the firstborn the father of course first was the priest of the home then the firstborn son would take it and on and on that's the way God intended for it to be in the original but Israel got to a place that that was taken from them so God brought forth a levitical priesthood and he chose the family of Aaron take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of Israel that he may Minister unto me what would God need now what have we been doing in the last several weeks and people from all over America and people that we don't even know sending their money and buying this and buying that well we're we're ministering to people in this terrible terrible situation that have lost their homes lost power lost all kinds of things and they have needs right and it created this spot to where we by the grace of God would be able to minister to their needs if that hurricane would have come through on the Atlantic side or had it went up through Texas and come that way and totally bypass us there would be no need for us to have all this stuff over here there would be no need for our brothers to make all these trips they made up all these Hills and hollers and mountains and all that stuff there would be no need they would be no need they would have their power they would have their houses they would have all of that and but something created did this need don't you understand that in the form of the Eternal he had no need but he condens sin into this form that he started needing something you know how we are as humans sir we don't like feeling vulnerable we don't like feeling like we need anybody well come on now don't get quiet on me well I I you know I can do what I want I can do this I can work I don't need nobody I don't know now you see whenever we get that spot we're in a dangerous shape the Eternal himself condescended into this form that he needed something so it wants Aaron and his sons to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office even Aaron NAD Abu elazar isamar Aaron's son so now the priests are going to minister of course to the people but first they've got to minister to God now you see even a preacher can be able to minister to the people talk to them encourage them try to help them but if he goes to leing God out of that Administration that's when they go to get in trouble they can still minister to the people because of Prior years of experience and knowledge of studying the Bible but it's so important that a real Minister also minister to God as well as the people amen because his ministry is not just the people themselves but it's God first NOW Watch What Happens here in 2 Chronicles chapter 13:10 but as for us the Lord Is Our God and we have not forsaken him and the priest which minister unto the Lord are the sons of Aaron and the Levites wait upon their business so here now some several hundred years after it was established in Exodus we have them repeating the same thing that the priests are ministering so apparently the Lord had some needs what was it what would God need from us come on now Daniel 7:9 I beheld till the Thrones are cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit His Garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him now notice thousand thousands thousand thousands ministered unto him so here the pillar of fire has been encapsulated around the Throne of God and this must have been something for Daniel to see this fiery issue coming from the presence of God and there are thousands thousands that are standing not to be judged right but standing there with the great king and they are ministering than Lord to him thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000s stood before him in other words this group of people stood out in front of him but there was some people who were not in front of him they were around him thousands thousands were around him now here they are they're standing near him they're standing behind him they're they're giving him what he needs and the others were those which were in front of him oh God don't let none of us be there I do not want to stand in that position I want to stand right here in the first part of this verse thousand thousands ministered under him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened so what do we see King with his Queen yeah who's before him those who have not been raised in the first resurrection now they're going to be judged and who's there with him in the throne his wife watch this in the breach Daniel said the Judgment was set in the books were open 10,000 times 10 thousands of thousands ministered to him King and Queen Another the book was open which is The Book of Life that's for the church and the queen and the King stood there so in the Judgment the queen will be ministering to her husband and aiding in the white Throne judgment amen do you understand if you're in Christ Jesus today you will never stand before the white Throne Judgment of God you have passed from Death unto life you will never be judged that ought to make a presbyterian want to shout oh hallelujah thank you Lord notice in the first seal now remember when he come he come with his bride is't it amazing when Paul sets the setting of the Rapture the translation the body change said behold the Lord cometh quoting from the Old Testament with 10,000s and Jud also of his Saints he's coming with them Hallelujah in the resurrection they are the Vindication that Calvary was a success oh my notice this remember he come and he come with his bride the wife ministers to her husband the wife ministers so your brothers whenever you go out and brother BR used the example so many times in so many different scenarios of a man that would be out working and he he comes in after a hard day and his wife is there and she comes in and and greets him and puts her arms around him and all that and then she's fixing supper for him and they sit there and talk and you know they they discussed their day and he said he might be going through such hard times but just the touch of her hand upon his cheek upon his brow can just do something so to that man like it can calm so many things she doesn't take it all away but you see this is what God gave the man the woman for the beginning he never gave a man a wife so that she would be able to be his head or that she would be running for president or she'd be mayor or Governor or something like that but God gave her the correct position and that was a help meat now women today want to be the meat they don't need a man but you see they're in the wrong place there're to be a help me don't you understand it was a foreshadow or a prefigure of what the bride would be to the Lord God himself how could he made Adam in his own image and everything that he made he said was good until he looked at the man and said it's not good for the man to be alone so where did man get this loneliness at he got it from his father so his father was there in eternity with myriads of angels that were around him but he was still alone oh yes he was alone because he had no one of his own genos or of his own kind angels are not of his kind they were created to worship him they were created to be able to be there for Beyond of Ages maybe they were but he wanted something of his own kind have you ever seen a man marrying a donkey well in this day you probably could and I've heard of him marrying pizzas I've heard of him marrying their cars and marrying all kinds of things that shows the you know the ignorance of the world we're living in but man was not made to marry a man a woman not made to marry a woman come on don't get quiet on in that word of life but God had the perfect order in the beginning whenever he gave the man a woman and that woman then was to be a helpmate not a doormat not a a being that was property to the man and not a male chauvinist and the man did not honor her and love her and respect her praise the Lord and whenever we look at that Adam what was it that was something within him that he long for something and he didn't even know what for maybe go down to the cool Blue Waters as they would riple down off the mountains and M the flowers in Paradise were awesome and the birds of paradise would land down on his shoulder and C to him and sheet of the tiger would come over and the lion the giraffe the hippopotamus and everything would just come around like a big family and yet Adam would look at it he'd see male and female Rhino male and female elephant male and female Canal everything that he saw was in pairs and then he kept feeling this something why do I feel this way everything is perfect everything is perfect what's wrong with me what's wrong with me and maybe look down in the water that day as it would come down into a gentle spot as it would trickle off the rocks and the beautiful flowers around it and he would look and he would see his own image but there was no one by him the way there was by the elephant there was no one behind him he would look and there was not another human being on the Earth but him I don't care how rich you are I don't care how much you worse I don't care what great your name is God made you to be a social preacher God made us to need one another God made us oh come on somebody to have friends and have Fellowship oh I know I know it's risky having any friends they may break your heart but I'm telling you one thing it'll be worth the risk if you ever get down and there's only one friend that can come by and help you and pull you up you'll be so glad you've had them and the Lord God saw it and it must have reached a place of Paramount Paramount something that moved the heart of God we don't know how long it it even was it could have been years it could have been aons of time before God finally come to the spot and said it's not good so did Adam get worse was there something in him that was changing day by day God didn't say that initially when he made him but something had happened in the man it was his father's attribute in his son that was declaring I need to be expressed I need someone to talk to I need someone to love do you understand today it's something that many Christians never get about God God is a lover God is not a mean contrary hateful God that hates Humanity that hates the world God is a lover our God is the very essence of oh come on Church let's have church this morning our God is the very essence of love and if you are allowed by the grace of God to move into that sphere with God you will experience something other mortals can only dream about Hallelujah notice in Ezekiel 4319 Thou shalt give to the priest the Levites that be of the seed of zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me sayeth the Lord a young bulock for a sin offering now we go to Ezekiel 44:16 now remember Ezekiel 44 through chapter 48 is the Millennium Temple the Millennium Temple and they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge Ezekiel 45:4 the holy portion of the land shall be for the priest the Ministers of the sanctuary which shall come near to minister unto the Lord I hope you're catching that only priests yeah can come near the presence of the Lord close enough to minister to him in this Avenue yeah not necessarily just saved people but priest for thou Hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth so only priest Oh Glory to God are called to come in this close the average Christian can be outside the sanctuary outside in the courtyard they can hear his voice they can see the cloud they can see the fire but they will never be pulled in behind the veil to where the holy of holies is separation between bride and church notice acts 13:1 now there was a church there at Antioch certain prophets that and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of siren and manad which had brought up was Herod the tetrarch and Saul as they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called them now look at New Testament now so here were some men that were under the unction of the spirit of God and they were ministering to the Lord total different meaning this word in the New Testament to assume an office which must be administered at one's own expense to move into a position Harry in the New Testament and if you're called to do this it will come at your your expense praise the Lord oh Jesus to discharge a public office at One's cost of Christians serving Christ whether by Prayer by instructing others concerning the way of Salvation or in some way but notice in the Old Testament where' the gold come from where the silver where the purple where the blue where did all those things come from to be to drape upon the priest it came from the people amen but in the New Testament if you're called to go into the presence of the king it will cost you amen it won't be your wife paying the price for you and if you got a Ministry especially if you're a preacher your wife will pay a price too your children will your family will right sir sure you all pay a price for the ministry here it ain't just me the preachers that's identified under this ministry and every other ministry that's called of God ordained by the world you as a church pay a certain price for being identified with me sure you do down in hell every preacher has a certain ID in Hell he's known as an intellectual he's known as a spiritual man he's known as whatever more and what that will be a sign certain damic powers demonic powers and forces that will be a sign to be able to try to go against that man and many times it will use this person that person that person that person sometimes from inside the church itself sometimes from outside but remember it's because hell identifies them as a threat and you come here you so oh man I thought I was doing pretty good till I moved here and once I got here all hell broke loose well praise God that's a good sign you're identified in hell with the ministry of Truth I'll tell you one thing I'd sure hate to be identified with the false prophet in hell wouldn't you I'd hate to be identified oh my as some false teacher that's leading people D stray if I'm going to be identified let me identify with men of God with the truths of the hour now watch as the ministry of the Bride we are then to minister to our husband what does my husband need what would the Lord God Almighty need love Fellowship praise adoration you see this is in his condensed form how many people has blasphemed his name this week how many people have said there is no God and they breathe his air every day they drink his water they eat his food they live on his Planet this don't belong to us it belongs to him they breathe his oxygen that he created they they they benefit by his ozone which he put upon the Earth they benefit by his trees that he made which processes through chlorophyll and is able to filter out all the gases they benefit every day of their life but all the things he has provided and will they Minister back to him and and thank him no that's your place one child of God which is a priest of God in the presence of the almighty can do more to minister to the Lord God than thousands times thousands of church members that's right church members praise too church members worship sure we know the casual atics in this day man they're all about worship ain't much about the word but they're all about worship so they sing and they Swoon and they swiggle and you know they do all the things that they do and all that sort of thing but unless you're worshiping in God's provided place he don't receive the worship of the hour and remember the manifestation of the name of God is the word interpreted so you've got to be at the right spot you couldn't just go these priests couldn't just go out under a tree and do this they had to be at a certain spot in a certain location and they didn't pick the spot fight God did I said God did oh my notice question answer 64 they came to the Judgment he came with him 10,000s times 10 thousands is that right they ministered to him the bride queen and king who is your little Queen in the home she ministers food to you is that right you see she ministers to you the bride ministers to Christ the word sir ain't it amazing but we've got that so one-sided that the way we look at it preachers preach to us and tell us the word and Sunday school teachers and you know youth groups and and all that the word the word the word that's only part of it that's right you are actually supposed to minister the word back to him that's right so if a man is a so breed winner in the home and he goes out and makes a living he buys the groceries of course he may not be able to make enough in this day the way as high as inflation is but he he makes the groceries and his wife goes out and gets them and brings him back home and then the man you know the woman puts it all together and has a nice meal for him and but but she takes what he paid for and ministers it back to him well could he not learn how to cook hary's a pretty good cook Justin's a pretty good cook probably some of you other brothers in your a pretty good cup present company left out of it so couldn't God have just created this love around him if he wanted it couldn't a man go to the grocery store and buy the same contents and fix his own meal and he could also sit down at the table by himself and eat it but oh how it is when you sit down at the table whether you're at home or a restur you reach over and grab your wife by the hand and say let's pray Oh Glory to God how the Lord Jesus longs to be this way in our lives that he can reach over and take hold of our hand and say let's pray sweetheart Lord let's love together let's fight fight together I cannot imagine with all all I've been through as a as a preacher and my position in life and you can relate the same way in your position in life I cannot imagine what it would be for me to try to face that without my dear Carol I think about my little friend down in Louisiana today having to go through the rest of his life without sister Karen getting texts from him and expressing to me the sadness and the loneliness in his heart why in the beginning he was not made to live in Paradise alone this is why Adam forfeited everything you imagine a flashback of time when you realize what she had done and he thought I cannot live here by myself I'd like to preach it to you sometime for the love of a woman the prophet said she ministers food to you is that right the bride ministers to Christ the word man shall not live by bread alone but every word she ministers the word to the king well we need the word for encouragement we need the word for promises to base our our healing and our Bill of Rights does he need healing no does he need Deliverance for something no but you see what he wants to do is he wants to hear us tell him how great he is oh yes sir GL and when you're facing the greatest trial of your life and you take his word and say but Lord Jesus you said you'd never leave me and you'd never forsake me you know what you're doing you're ministering the word and it's costing you cuz you may not feel like it it may be through your pain it may be through the present anxiety but through that it's costing you listen bread you don't have a cost to way to minister to your king not like Leia that can be blind wretched miserable and naked and CA them nothing she ministers the word to the king listen how you Minister now manifesting his promised word in the age she's living in a I said something and then you sure did Brother Bram thank you for saying it ministering to him every day you live this word you're ministering to the king your word other people want it of course not they ridicul it they laugh at they make fun of it they call us all kinds of names let them call it's worth it to me I don't know about you it's cost me to preach this message it's cost me to live for this word oh my but I'm convinced of this the things that we go through in this life are not even worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us at that day but I'm not waiting till I get to heaven to minister to my Lord I'm going to minister to him every day that I live whether I feel it whether I don't whether I'm up whether I'm down I want to minister the word back to my king you are my healer you are my deliverer you are my savior he could have bypassed all of this had he so desired sir all this space of time went straight to the Lamb's Book of Life and started with the letter A or the first letter in the Hebrew and spoke every one of his children's names from that book into existence he could have them gathered them around him and they would have looked at his exalted glory and he could have said to them children I could have been a savior I could have been a redeemer a heater but alas all of you are spoken word you're a SE genene Hallelujah you are a sophony you are a glorified body so you can never fall and he could a said I I could have saved you Daniel I could have saved you Harry I could have saved you Emma but now I can't cuz you're perfect on but when it's all set and down at the end we gather around Papa's throne and there we are by the millions and we're ministering unto him it won't be him telling us it'll be us telling him am I was lost and you saved me I was sick and you healed me I was bound I was under oppression I was under depression I was under anxiety and last Wednesday night you come by and set me free Oh Glory to God we will praise we will Adore we will worship him for the ceaseless ages this is only your warmup time bride get ready I said get ready you are going to worship your husband forever let me just share a little something here with you for before I close brother Brown was down in Kentucky brother Charlie coxes there was a power line that come underneath brother Charlie's driveway so you turn in off of that road there I've been many times you turn in off of that road and pull in that driveway up the driveway sort of like that and there's some power lines right across the driveway so brother BR him had been there hunting with brother Charlie him and some other brothers and while he was there he noticed there was a mother Dove sitting out there in those par lines and he said in the evening that mother would take her little babies and they would sit out there in the power line and they' take their necks and just kind of hook around each other and they just sit there C Co and she would C to them and they would go back to her and the father would come over and they just saw sitting there just cooing cing now notice that that picture there he said and I thought of how God of the dove is such a loving burden God wanting to make love with these human beings God wants to be loved God wants to love you for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever perish or whosoever believes in Him should excuse me should not perish but have everlasting life blessed be the Lord then God warning to make love he had to make something lovable So Adam was so lovable so lovable you know to me one of the saddest things I've ever seen in my life it's a human being that don't know how to love and I've had to deal with a lot of them in my Ministry it's like they don't know how to do it I've had family members ants uncles whatever that word that way it's like they could never tell you they loved you it's not they could never say I appreciate you or acknowledge any good thing you've ever done it's not they just can't relate they could relate to your cousins maybe or you know somebody else some stranger out there but never relate to you as a child don't raise your hand but some of you know what I'm talking about so Adam was so lovable and we've all been around people that you know you don't know where to shake their hand or not it's like grabbing hold of a dragon's tail you know you know if they like you if they hate you they want to Slit your throat or what you don't you understand what I'm saying they're just not very lovable but can you imagine Adam in the Garden of Eden he was so lovable and those first years of his life When papa would come down in the garden and they'd go to church together every day and papa would come down that pillar fire and he start woo and Adam way on the west side of the garden he said Lord God so here they'd come together and he say son how's everything been today oh papa it's been so wonderful I was just out there on the West Side just looking I saw some trees that I hadn't seen before I was just marveling in your majesty I saw some birds there with plumage that I'd never noticed before and I saw some animals there tell me about it oh papa they were just you know know they were so big and and they had this and they this and I was just thinking how great you are I wonder for you come here son sit down by me just just tell me but then whenever he'd say Papa thank you for coming down he said yeah I want to I want to kiss a good night and I'll see you tomorrow but then Adam would lay there in a bed of leaves Maybe kind of turn and toss he'd say what's wrong with me what's wrong with me why do I have this yearning for something I've got everything a man would want and if I want anything else he'll give it to me but I'm reminded of the story of Michaelangelo when he goes to the great big spot where they mine the stone the white Carrera marble and he looks at this massive piece of stone puts his hands behind just back this way he walks around and looks at it and says so he made a complete circumference around it a couple of times and the people there with him said what is it he said I see an image wanting to be released oh yeah amen now I got to be honest with you when I look at a rock I don't see that I may look at you and you may look at me and all we say is just a wasted human a flawed human one that is messed up big time but aren't you glad the Lord God can walk around us and say I see an image that's wanting to be delivered from that sin let me close with this God is a lover God is love and God so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable listen this carefully here it is God wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get to some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law can you imagine almighty God seeking thirsting hungry Lord have mercy God is looking and trying and moving and begging persuading to find a little heart that he can come into and cool and make love to why would we make almighty God beg beg you know what I say shame on all of us amen you agree brother Danny shame on all of us if I would make God beg for 5 minutes 10 minutes of my time not God and my iPhone not God and my Droid not God and this and God and that but you and God Amen lot of y'all got Sanctified from cigarettes and you got Sanctified from drinking alcohol I'm begin to wonder if we don't need some sanctification from our smartphones on let's bury it your right to a position like this God offers you friends a position that is so sacred and so holy that Angels can't even have it cherubims cannot have what I've preached to you today you imagine Holy Angels that have never sinned never lied never done anything wrong and yet God does not offer them this position but God offers it to you today and I well we can love him we can serve him we can Praise Him many of you already have that you know you do but the thing of it is after God gives it to you the devil will try to make you so busy and occupy you with so much stuff of life to where that we make our father our husband hunger and thirst and beg oh my I wonder how many of your brothers would continue living with your wife if she made you beg and you had to beg every day honey please tell me you love me honey please please tell me that you're glad you married me please honey tell me that that that you don't regret Mar me please would you tell me I just told you last week why do you need to hear it again sometimes a man needs to be be reassured just like a woman does the prophet said tell her she's the best cook in the country and how happy you are she's a mother of your children how much you love her and well you see God condom sin to this level to where he wants to hear it and not only wants to he needs to in so much he would beg he would beg he would thirst he would hunger praise the Lord with every head bowed today any honest Christians here today and say brother Donnie that's what I want with all of my heart God bless you Saints God bless each of you I believe I do that with him but I want more I can be better maybe some of you feel like you have that position with God can you say the same today Lord I want to be better to you I want to treat you better I want to be more consecrated to you Jesus not just to minister to people people people people that's wonderful it's wonderful it's part of

rot in all of us were the devil didn't even love us he can't he ain't got no love and you know what God done God made us lovable now the devil wants to take our love that God gave us make us fall in love with other things out there in the world that's what God told Israel in Ezekiel 16 I Found You by the way you were sitting there in your blood and I said yay I say unto thee live God said your hair grow out you matured you become a woman then when Israel become of a marriageable age you know what the devil done same thing he did to Eve tried to come to her he wasn't interested in her when she was a little child he wasn't interested when she was a little girl but when she grew up and come to the spot that she could receive seed that he wanted to devour he didn't care about you he didn't
