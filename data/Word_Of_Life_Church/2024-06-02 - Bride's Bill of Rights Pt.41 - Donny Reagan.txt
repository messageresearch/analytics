going at once so I might need a little bit of help this morning so somebody kind of tell me after about 2 and 1 half hours or three and know yes sir yes sir only kidding don't don't leave only only kidding Romans chapter 7 verse one praise the Lord what an awesome day to be serving the lord know you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband now remember he not talking about the law of Moses he's talking about the law of a husband so then if while her husband live us she'd be married to another man listen now she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law what law the law of her husband so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ isn't that strange so he jumps from the woman then to Christ and so how Christ had to die so my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead married to to Christ now raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God Amen how many like to be remember today as we just ask the Lord to help us and speak to us from his word father thank you so much for the opportunity that we can be together today Lord one more time dear God as we're here in time and we're trying Lord Jesus to be able to present the Living Word in this age to a dying people a dying age our nation is so rotten and corrupt our world is so rotten Wars rumors of wars terrible times difficulties anxiety heartaches sickness everywhere Lord but I thank Father that sometimes you allow these things to happen to us to where it will make us so homesick for a place where there is none of those things dear Jesus help us today as we look into your word May the presence of God speak to us I bind the devil in the name of Jesus you evil spirit that would try to hinder us this morning I'm just going to go ahead and tell you right now you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ father take charge of the service have your way today we pray in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may may be seated Saints we appreciate you today how good the Lord is to us uh I'd like to to resume on on this quote here that we looked at a week or so ago um and come back to what oh watch wow um that whenever the prophet was dealing with this in invisible Union that there was a spiritual side to marriage and divorce and we truly believe that uh we believe that God in his Mercy is open to us as brother Joel Brown just sang to us a while ago the message according to Malachi 4 I realize to the majority of the law of the world today to hear that song they would think what in the world are them people even talking about to hear us preach under the inspiration of Malachi 4 that do the same thing it's sad because even sometimes those who claim that they believe this message wind up being in the same way they see no no significance of trying to bring the word of God of the hour under the inspiration of Malachi 4 so they're still preaching the same Bible stories that they preached for decades and it's producing basically the same results but we are a people that are looking for a Rapture I'm not looking just for me to get old and the older people here to get old and the young people come on and take it then another generation happens on and on and on I believe with all of my heart we're the people that's going to break this cycle amen and the church said so if we are it's going to take something to be able to help us get into that sphere with God you believe that notice this he says Paul is here giving us an illustration in the scripture about that law and Grace now watch law and Grace and illustrating it like marriage and divorce this p passage is very seldom preached on because it's more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce so there there is in the natural portion of marriage and divorce and there is a spiritual portion of marriage and divorce now watch he says of how that he's trying to set in order here that we as a church but I believe also it is to my beliefs that that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy so prophecy is what it's something that God foretells by inspired men of God everybody doesn't have access to prophecy everybody doesn't have access to understand prophecy once it's been revealed so prophecy can come by words it can come by symbols it can come by signs as it did in Isaiah 7 Whenever there was a su dial that was s it and he said to ahaz and he says go and prophesy to ahaz and it very peculiar that a Sund would be set and then you would come with one of the greatest prophecies ever known to man and then the Lord tells Isaiah go tell him this Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and you called his name Emmanuel who in the right mind would ever make any connection between a su dial which is the way they would be able to tell the time of the day and they had this dial it had a hand on it and the way the shadow would reflect from the angle of the sun they knew what time of the day it was thank God for watches but out of that God would take a prophecy and prophesy about a virgin birth you imagine this has never happened before so a virgin is going to conceive and bring forth a child and will call his name wonderful counselor Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and of his kingdom there shall be no end how strange that would have been and no doubt the people of that day laughed at it and said Isaiah has lost his mind who ever heard of a virgin conceiv you imagine taking that prophecy to the doctors now doctor I was in church yesterday and I heard this man who claims to be a prophet say that a virgin would conceive and that doctor could say so now that no doubt it was that Jewish Church where they believe in prophets and Pillar of Fire and signs and wonders and all that stuff right well yall just so happened to be that's where I was going to church well you ought to had better sense than to go to such a church as that now if you would have been waiting to be able to live and see if Isaiah's prophecy ever come to pass guess what you would have died long before you ever saw it come to pass so some prophecies of prophets come to pass in the generation or the lifetime of the people who hear it said so how you going to judge this man how you going to judge this man Isaiah he said I'm going to wait to see if it comes to pass none of those people that heard it were alive when it did so how you going to judge that he was a Prophet come on children there's still prophecies in Micah that have not yet come to pass there's prophecies in the book of Jeremiah in the book of Isaiah in the Book of Ezekiel in the Book of Malachi that have not yet come to pass how we going to know these men were prophets because we see the continuity of the inspiration of God being on them when they were here and that gives us Faith to believe that what they said in the future will also come to pass so in other words if a prophet is standing there and telling you you've been to a doctor there's three steps that goes up to your house you live on 126 Springs Street your doctor is a heavy set man wears glasses he told you you had so and so and so and so then when that Prophet comes back and said thus sayeth the Lord Los Angeles will sink that gives us hope to know those things will also come to pass you see that's the way God uses his prophets and the church said he will vindicate them by the present tense which gives us a consolation that what are going to say in the future will also come to pass so I find it amazing because the prophet never actually mentioned this anywhere else quite like this an invisible Union but it set forth that there was a great spiritual understanding to marriage and divorce now I for one I don't like preaching on marriage and divorce most of us probably don't like talking about it we don't like hearing about it because it's a very controversial subject and it's a painful subject for folks who who' been there and it's a very difficult one but when I go to preaching on this spiritual side I have to say I do enjoy it because I've experienced it now I've also experienced marriage and divorce in a more sense that's more real to me than maybe some of you who are sitting here today and you've not had that new birth oh brother Donnie I thought you talking about marriage and divorce not the new birth no I'm talking about actually both because the New Birth is the spiritualization of marriage and divorce oh he said where'd you get that at I got it from The Book of Romans because said Paul's talking about us being married under the law of our first husband and then by the body of Christ which was the proof that the token was released out of his body so the body died so when we look at the body it is an evidence that something left the body you see when those Hebrew Believers and they took the lamb and they killed the lamb according to what the prophet told them and they took the blood and use the blood as a paint and they paint it over the Len and the doorpost of their house now that's what they do with the chemistry then they take the body and they roast the body with fire and with bitter herbs and unleavened bread so they had one significance on the door and they have another significance in their body because they're taking the carcass of the Lamb which means the life's lamb the lamb has given its life its blood is gone and their name is protected by the blood now they take the Flesh of the lamb and eat that flesh and it becomes a part of who they are as a matter of fact some of them their bodies were changed if they were crippled then they was able to walk out of the land of bondage is that right the Bible tells us that was not one e one even those that were feeble or were crippled because they so partook of that lamb it brought them a body change amen that's what we're looking for is it not so they had an Evidence then because they did not take just a life out of the lamb and disassociate thems from the chemistry of the blood or disassociate them from the Flesh of the Lamb you see this is what modern religion does it disassociates those who participate just in the organized religion term and their identified with a thought or a theory or a story a Bible story of a man who gave his life they don't partake of his flesh word so they don't eat of that word to become the body that God can house in but they're identified with a thought with a the with the story story that happened 2,000 years ago but I'm so glad today I'm not just identified with history I'm identified today with a person who's right here in this building this morning and the church said amen now you see what we can see from the the example that Paul is using that he takes a natural man and woman and he use his n the natural side of marriage and divorce and then he projects it he leaves the th Romans 7 no doubt it was probed that for years and years and yet many of the theologians tried to look at it and understand it but in our reality the mystery of Romans 7 was left for the last day when the son of man would return back among his people you see under the administration of the son of man at his first Advent in a body form now we know the prophets will call son of man but yet they were a temporary house by which the presence of God would live in with a promise that as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be when the son of man comes back again now many people try to catch that scripture in Matthew 24 and Luke 17 and identify it with the Corporal return but the son of man is not always Corporal body the son of man is a personal presence of the manifestation of God by which he comes down at a special time in season on the earth to make his way known it requires that to we that the little bitty light the shining through the church ages and and the temporary times when the prophets are here is not enough to bring the illumination that the people need for that hour so he comes down himself in a very secretive form to reveal something that he wants to make known he don't even just leave it to prophets to do it he doesn't leave it just to the ministry to do it but he will come down himself now how anxious the Lord Jesus has been for this hour now here we are when we're November 25th 1965 the opening of the seals now have transpired and and of course we know in March in 63 and there's been some great things that's unfolded down to this but this particular part of the mystery of God had not yet been revealed and what we're going to look at this morning now remember God had his Prophet here so he's got to speak it while it's on his heart now so then we when we are born every one of us receive the exact same thing in the sense that we were born between Satan and Eve so we were married our first husband that had the rule over us was our natural nature that was our husband so as soon as we broke the womb of our mother and we took the the breath of life and God breathed into us the Breath of Life our name goes on a book under the oaces of that book when we come to the age of accountability that sins are attributed to us no longer just our mother our father our grandparents and so on but we become responsible and accountable when that happens that old life of that old nature and it starts dominating us and whatever your nature is maybe you're a powder maybe you're a you know you're a high temper T maybe you're a person that can't forgive people and you hold grudges well whatever you are then that was the nature that ruled over you that dominated the majority of your life until you would be able to be released from that husband now watch again he says let's look at this first Union again an invisible union now it was nature associated with death your first husband that had the rule over you was your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world so you're not just of it but you are the world you're you are part of the world and that's the way you are naturally we cannot help that God don't send people to hell because they're born lost he sends them to hell because they choose to stay lost and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up there to the occasion no sir no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die now notice carefully every Speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature now this is what he's talking about of the greater portion of marriage and divorce so this is part of the mystery that's to be revealed in the last day again he says your name of your first nature was born and put into a book of life now listen your name that you was born under was put in a book called The Book of Life all your Deeds were wrote in it everything you done under that nature so under that nature that that nature and that old name are identified in one book called The Book of Life now neither that nature nor that old name can be identified in the Lamb's Book of Life Now religion's good going to church is good helping people that's good but that's not what I'm talking about this morning there's only one thing that will eradicate that book now you see friend there's many people that are are going to church and they think because they join the church and they do good things that they're ready to meet the Lord Jesus and how surprised they're going to be when they stand before him and God doesn't open up the Lamb's Book of Life but God opens up the book of life and there is the record of all the Deeds they thought was taken care of and they're going to stand before God with all their adulteries all their lies all their fornications and all the things that they thought was absolutely blotted out because they accepted it by a church theology instead of a real baptism of the Holy Ghost you talking about surprised people at the Judgment now you remember whenever the prophet seen the woman in the restaurant in Ohio and she was dressed really really bad and the the state trooper was there and they was drinking and different things that was going on and he he condemned the woman and and his heart you remember that and he had this attitude toward him and I want you to notice how that he relates this to us oh how I thank God that he was able to give these things to us and didn't hide them so I thought yes and God would have destroyed me now what what happens to him is that the Lord begins to flash back to him his old life and his sins now then the Lord gives him a vision now I want you to notice the vision hadn't it been for the blood of Jesus Christ keeping my sins from his presence and then something come to me and said yes I forgive you but you want to condemn her and I thought God that's right that's right I seen my sins then one day I crawled up to him and I seen an old book right laying there it had William brandham at the top and all kinds of sin wrote Under it now watch what he's seeing by Vision he's seeing himself in book form he seeing hisself in book form so all of his sins all of his unbelief God is showing him oh my remember every one of us have a book every one of us have a book I hope today we've all got the first one destroyed oh my now notice what he sees I seen an old book lay there I had William brandom at the top of it all kinds of sins run I said Lord I'm so sorry that I've caused you all this bleeding and his face sweating and blood running down and I said I was the one who did that will you forgive me and he took his hand and dipped it in any side and wrote on that old book pardoned and throw it behind him in the sea of forgetfulness never to remember it against me no more praise the Lord praise the Lord Lord he forgave me and I wanted to condemn her now notice what this done to him he said that changed my attitude so here the prophet tells us that his attitude toward this woman was wrong you'll agree to that so his attitude toward her was wrong so how is God going to deal with this now that the prophet has a wrong something that's displeasing to the Lord but yet he no longer has an old book so is the Lord going to go fishing and bring that old book back so he can write down in the old book his wrong attitude Oh Glory boy yall are quiet this morning so what's the Lord going to do you see once that that book is destroyed it can never be brought back to life again it is annihilated well brother Donnie what about it then when we do wrong look at this example so what did he do the spirit of God sent the corrective measure that would correct his attitude there's no need in writing it down he's going to make it right there's no need dragging that book back out and then rewriting it and then him saying I'm sorry and then he Blen it out you see once God changes our nature and that husband is dead it no longer controls you oh you say but don't we make mistakes we do and we fall short of the glory of God every day and we fix them every day come on somebody we're not waiting till the end of the week I don't know about you I ain't waiting till Wednesday night I might not live till Wednesday night if I've done anything wrong let me fix it right now Lord if I need to I'll fix it from the ppit but you see when God annihilates that old book that nature that name that husband notice the name that brother random saw it was not his new word name it was not his new word name it was his name that his mother and father gave him so when God now shows him what happened to him well you ought to be encouraged today because that didn't just happen to him it happened to every one of you that's got the Holy Ghost because as his old husband nature died and that book and that name and that nature the Trinity of the old man was all identified together and when death struck that the old nature which is your husband and your name and your book are all Chang forever I still know you by your name and you still know me by my name but God hallelujah knows Us by who we really really are now I know you understand this and one day whenever we gather beyond the curtain of time and we'll be joined together with the saints of God well all you know we've been been for a r Christian and most of us for many many years of our life we have enough sense to know that probably everybody in our family is not going to be there and we saying how in the world can I enjoy Heaven if so and so and there so and so is not there and so and so is not there you will be burst into your true family and it will be as if though you never lost anything because your aunt your uncle your grandmother whoever didn't make it because you would have come back to the true birst of the soul and your body theophany and soul will be merged together into the real family of God you say oh my my my child my this that the other no when you get there you will not have lost anything in your family tree well praise the Lord now notice so then his old book had been thrown away watch this now it wasn't so from the beginning every man's got to be born again and this sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus so it's not actually me being born in me and you being born in you it's not you it's not me it's Christ Jesus that is the new birth Lord of Mercy a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus the son of God Christ Jesus the son of God so the only begotten son of John John 3:16 becomes rebirthed again in other Sons and Daughters of God that are begotten in this last age it's the same Act of God as he's begetting one after another after another by the exact same process of the new birth I've got the same parent I've got the same experience I've got the same right that Simon Peter received on the day of Pentecost and you do too it's not just good for the apostles it's good for me it's good for our children it's good for you I don't care if you're poor if you're rich I don't care what race what ethen city you are if you want to receive it today and there's something inside you calling it's the same experience by the same God by the same baptism of the Holy Ghost why would I want a handshake when I can receive the Lord Jesus and the Lord Jesus and be reborn in me that's what we want our children to have not just an all drye confession oh I believe Jesus died for my sins and died on the cross that's good but you want him to be reborn in your soul lord children can you imagine there's going to be preachers that's going to stand before him on that day and how surprised they're going to be when their book their old book yes sir is drawn out of the library of God they will stand there with their adulteries and their lying and their drinking spree and all this and that and the other though they may have preached for 50 years right amen because they were still married to a church husband which proves they're not married to Christ somebody said amen notice your old book is gone with your old Union what was your old book it was your marriage certificate that's it your old book was your marriage certificate now what do they do to us whenever we are born we get what is called a birth ah so it proves you were born says what state what day what hour what hospital or whatever more right so whenever you're doing certain documentation and things like that you have to have you're trying to get the real ID as they call it today Caren I just did a little bit ago they want proof of your citizenship they don't want you know just this that and the other CU anybody can do that but they want real proof they want authenticity that will be able to prove by your not just a driver's license they want a passport they want several proofs as far as your address they want a birth certificate because they want to make sure you are who you say you are don't you see it's real easy for anybody to say I'm a Christian but many of them do not have a new birth certificate which is their marriage certificate so well I join the church and I I believe God sent a prophet every devil in hell knows that but but that's still not your new marriage certificate your name must be transferred and your identity is no longer under the old nature oh God help us only now when we realize that it's beyond we can never do this it's impossible for any of us to do this that's why the new birth is such a supernatural Miracle oh my your name has been transferred yes sir do you mean to me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness and you stand perfectly before God now your name is in the new book right not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate your marriage certificate now you've seen that I've done many many weddings in different states and so on and the man who performs the ceremony it is my responsibility to be able to take that and to fill it out also I have to have a witness there they give their name their address and so on I have to specify was it a civil uh marriage or was it a religious one when did I do it where did I sign it so on and so on over and over and over again and then if I take it here I can either take it to the Washington County Courthouse Unico County Carter County and if I ask for it they will print me out the bride and the Grooms marriage certificate then I have the legal document now they go pick it up at the courthouse and they pay whatever it is to get it but they cannot put that up on their wall that expires within 30 days after the day at soned so no matter how much they say hey we went to the courthouse well that's where a lot of folks say well I went to the church house I went to the church house and I accepted John 3:16 and I walked up ear and I said I want to be married to Christ the word and right here's my scriptures John 3:16 Romans 5 I believe on him and I've confessed it with my mouth I've got it right here and the preacher said yeah glory to God you got her but you still got to be joined together so John do wants to marry Susie Jane and Susie Jane and John Doe ain't married legally until someone performs that ceremony and it ain't enough to just perform the ceremony but you got to be authorized to do it and then you've got to return it right back to them and then they will print it out to you and I've walked out of there with many of them in my hand and bring them to him at church or mail it to them whichever it is because then they are legally identified I don't want to just be emotionally identified with Christ I don't want to just cry a few tears about his blood I don't want to just cry a few tears about the cross I want to be legally identified I'll tell you what's going to get our dead up out of the graves a legal documentation I feel it Oh Glory Hallelujah it's all over me that ain't enough we're going to have to have a marriage certificate glory to God the bride is what's going in that first resurrection and we must have a marriage certificate your new life in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold you're not only forgiven you're just ified Glory Glory Hallelujah Justified Romans 51 yeah Romans 51 therefore being justified by faith now remember where he's preaching this sermon Life Tabernacle spport Louisiana Pastor Jack Moore Apostolic Pentecostal preacher which never did EX except brother Bram was God's Prophet cuz he believed Elijah would be a body moov that there'd be a whole bunch of people under the anointing of Elijah I can go that a little bit after the man comes and bring the message and a bunch of people gets under the anointing that's right never did see who he was never did recognize who he was oh my how sad I'm so glad he did not stop because they were setting up now remember follow this soon and the next day and you'll find out Jack Moore and some of them men there on the pull pit they was going to meet brother brandom and they kept knocking on the wrong door at the hotel and they was going to stop that meeting after this service it ain't no wonder the devil was all been out of shape the devil said Lord have mercy if this gets out what in the world is it's going to do I'll tell you what it's going to do issue a bunch of new marriage certificates oh Oh Glory to God thank God he didn't stop you know he felt that going on behind him and Jack Mo and them trying to go up with him the next day and they kept knocking on the wrong door the wrong door but thank God that Prophet did not compromise he stood right there and preached the word and uttered things that he had never said in his entire Ministry why the season was right it was time if God could deliver a message like this in a Pentecost Church Lord children what can he do here this morning and a message church that believes [Applause] this and God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead not even in the memories of God now we can still remember being lost but he can't it's mind blowing you can remember things no doubt you did when you were a sinner but he can't you say how's that possible cuz he chooses to forget it brother the do I still remember drinking I remember running around yeah well our our memory is plagued with such thank God one of these days your spirit will be replaced by your theophany in your spirit s five contacts imagination conscious memory reason of course you know all those and one day our memory of this past life will be replaced by our theophany and two we will come to the spot that we will never ever remember being lost we will never ever remember being down you're in this world struggling with this and struggling with that because we will have finally arrived when we get our marriage certificate in our flesh I've got my certificate in my soul but I all Hallelujah I'm waiting for my marriage certificate in my body when my marriage certificate comes into my body I'll have a new body [Applause] it's not even in the memories of God you are Justified therefore being justified you was accused but you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgiveness fness you wasn't married to it to begin with well I guess the question is which you cuz it was a part of you that was married but there's a part of you that wasn't amen now the problem is differentiating between the 's will the real Rob Weber please stand up we're the real Donnie rigan we're the real John Hornet but our problem is we look at this one right here and if we're not careful we still live so much under the influence of that old name sure we're called by it every day of our life but one of these days you won't walk up to me in streets of gold and say hello brother Donnie and I won't say hello brother Curt and brother Keith and Sister Janet and sister Carol and Sister Barbara I will not answer you that way and you will not call me brother Donnie but you will call me by my word name Hallelujah because my marriage certificate will be made manifest in my flesh I will have eyes like Jesus Ears Like Jesus feet like Jesus a body like Jesus Oh Lord God Hallelujah absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God when brother Brandon was at Jack Moors in 1965 there was a sister that I know was there at those meetings she was a young woman she' been sneaking around sinning doing some things she shouldn't be doing had it hid from Mama had it hid from Daddy had it hid from the preacher other people but it just so happens she was sick so she got a prayer card to get in the prayer line she saw that discernment as it was going forth it scared the liver out of her and the devil too Hallelujah so she gets in the prayer line she's as nervous as she can be cuz she thinking oh Lord God he's going to call out what I've been doing mama's going to whoop me Daddy's going to whoop me she genuinely repents in the prayer line when she gets up before God's Prophet not one thing was mentioned about what she did wrong that distance between when she got in the prayer line before she stood before God's Gift God took care of every bit of it oh hallelujah how long does it take Brother Don however long it takes you to be sincere that's how long it takes can you imagine God so annihilated the prophet even goes on to say about that he said whenever you confess a sin he said God can't even show me about it oh oh Hallelujah God can't even show you but brother Donnie I remembered I know you do oh how lovely it would have been if the blood of the Lord Jesus would have painted my mind how it would have took away all my shortcomings and my failures but here I am in this state today that in my soul I've got a God's Soul I've got a soul that come from God a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world and yet I'm captured in this body of time I remember my shortcomings anybody else I remember my failures I remembered all I have mistakes and how I wish they was not there but I'm waiting for the finalization of the Court Document of my body change when my body's going to get the marriage [Applause] certificate you are The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word now it would be more common for us to flip it around which he did also at other times word bride but here is one of the Mysteries of the end time bride word cuz actually you were in his thinking before he ever had the word on print don't get mad at me now he ain't coming back for your Bible he's coming back for you he ain't coming back for your tapes and your tape players and your MP3 players right he's coming back for you so it's not just just word bride but it's bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same Lord children the same same as he was than you Lord but you're haunted by your whole book than you Lord and because you're still captured in this Tabernacle of time right you go back and forth back and forth do I have the Holy Ghost don't I have the Holy Ghost do I have the Holy Ghost don't I have the Holy Ghost Lord God let me read that again that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love notice then you're a Son of God in the house of God and you're a part of God's economy Romans 8:1 therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus for they are dead to the world allive in him and living in the present day making the word that God has used them for for orain them placing their names in this bride book don't you see what the Lamb's Book of Life is The Book of Life contains the name of pharaoh The Book of Life contains the name of Adolf Heman Adolf h Pharaoh ramesis all the ones down through time many of those terrible terrible people is in the book of life but then the lamb had his own diary so the Book of Life contains a manifestation of billions of people that will live on the earth but the Lamb's Book is his own personal diary so he calls it bride book Oh Glory to God and when the waters comes upon that seed that's in your heart it raises it up to the bride of Christ oh my just perfect as it can be in every age it's been that way now let me remind you this is being preached in a Pentecostal Church which did not believe in predes destination matter of fact go to November what house you build for me in two R brother Brandon dedicates to place out that brother perig green was the beginning of his church you'll find brother Brandon before these meetings here mentioning about brother Jack Moore that he did not understand serpent seed election to the believer and he goes down through there listing many things that Brother Moore did not believe oh my I'm so glad we're sitting here in a church today that believes in election predestination for knowledge of God come on somebody that we believe they turned it down we accept it Hallelujah it is part of our identity now let's go into this part about the new nature if you believe in them little immoral things or just drop off as you believe you become love isn't that awesome I can say why the devil don't want this message preached can't you as you believe you become love so you're not just feeling love and experiencing love but if our faith does not produce this there's something wrong with our believing can you say Amen to that I don't want to just believe I I want to believe and become love oh Hallelujah and love is God and you begin to wind yourself into Christ now once you're believing becomes love then following your believing and your becoming comes winding your belie leing you're becoming and you're winding notice he doesn't say Christ is winding you but you are actually winding yourself into him why because it's him in you CHR don't you understand why people have a hard time living right don't you understand even why some of the preachers are on the message of backlit and left the word of God Hein never been born again they've never really had a word birst oh my notice he said then these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves there's no desire to do it the worshipper having Purge has no more conscience or desire to sin Hebrews 9 the worshipper once purges see what I mean when the worshipper is purged is when he's born again when his old nature died eyes and a new nature sets in then he becomes a part of God a Son of God again in God's provided way conversion is the holy spirit that moves the old nature out and the new nature comes in which is the Holy Ghost don't you see what Satan is doing with theology he's trying to convince people the new birth in it's them it's them it's you being a better person it's you changing it's you it's you can't you see what he's trying to do he's trying to offer you this in the form of religion under the opes of what he's projecting as the cross that you become better and you become better don't you understand that's exactly what he done to Eve he's trying to offer her a godship without coming God's way it's much easier for you and I if we can just let the Lord Jesus do it instead of us struggling and find I I've got to do this and I I've got to do that the best thing you can do is give up come on somebody just give and Let Jesus take over Oh Brother Don I can't quit this and I can't quit that but Jesus can I I whole grudges I can't quit it but Jesus [Applause] can again he says if you want to be a Christian just ask ask Christ he will take your old nature out and put a new nature in then you don't have to impersonate anything you're just living a normal life that you're living well glory to God hallelujah it's just as easy for a holy ghost filled child of God to live a Christian Life is a drunk out here the live the life of a drunk or a harot to live the life of a harlot or a prostitute or whatever more drug addict they get up every day and they know they've got to have their drugs it's a life they live a holy ghost filed child of God Brother D don't they have battles they've got more than these people out here would even understand come on somebody but it ain't them on the inside it ain't the preacher on the inside it's Jesus on the inside Hallelujah and Jesus overcomes lying Jesus overcomes every sin out there because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world [Applause] your old nature died yes sir the nature of the world and you become a new creation and your desires that old life that had a beginning when God breathed the breath into your nostrils when you were born so look at our stage of Innocence as we would think and when we took the breath of life and God breathed into our nostrils our old nature which was her husband moved in now you're mine I'll let you alone for a little while cuz you're a baby but you wait till I get a hold to you I'm going to make make you lie I'm going to make you cheat I'm going to make you steal you better not open your mouth to me CU I'm your husband I'm your boss you hear me yes sir yes sir yes sir what whatever you say Sir yeah just here here here here I am ain't that what we done whatever he wanted to do we did it some of y'all think it's crazy the way I stand up here and preach and run and shout and sweat and spit and carry on and you think that is absolutely absurd I'll tell you what's absolutely absurd people going in and sitting you're not long ago to the Super Bowl playoff and them different things and some of them still having their fingers and toes took off because it got so cold they got frostbit and you life at me and make make fun of some of the rest of the holy rollers around this message because we want to worship God and people would give up a toe or a finger for some stupid ball game somewhere and we come to the House of God and set there like a bump on a pickle we won't even raise our hands and praise God we won't even Shout to the Lord and yet they give their toes they give their fingers some of them lost the tips of their noses for a ball game for a ball game I'm talking about the resurrection and the life I'm talking about salvation I'm talking about a body change [Applause] notice this you must be born again a new nature a new being New Creation nature of your father and you believe and love every word that he said every man's word is a lie contrary to this word now here's our problem right here this next paragraph now if you've got a Church Father you'll believe in that church father that's why some preachers can get up and preach things that's contrary to the scripture and the messages they can be and you can show people and they'll still sit right there come on well that's what my church says that's what my daddy said that's what my grandma said you've got a Church Father well come on somebody uhhuh you've got a Church Father you'll believe in that church father but if you god father God you'll believe in God's word if you've got a father in the church you'll believe that because you're of his nature can't you see a lot of these moves that's been down through time look at all the moves that come through our message what do they do they take on the nature of the founder come on somebody well brother so and so said brother so and so said brother so and so said I don't care what brother so and so said if it's contrary to God's word let brother so and so and every other so and so be a liar but let God's word be the truth but people take on on the nature of a church father or me said it this way their Pastor well that's well and good as long as your pastor's telling the truth God's Prophet also told you if that Pastor leaves the word you leave him that goes for me and every other Pastor well I've been sitting on him for 20 years I don't care if you've been sitting on 375 years if he leaves a word you better leave him you're going to be lost if you don't woo wow oh my if you're the church you'll believe his word you'll believe the church word if you believe what the church said but if you're born again you'll believe what God says cuz God's your father not the world or the church creates I found this yesterday was I was studying before service I just had to pull my laptop away just a bit and just sit there and just contemplate it and shake my head we are Christians by birth that makes us new creatures in our old nature we could never be Christians don't you see what Satan wants to do to people convince them they're Christians in their old nature so they go to school they go to Sunday school they go to learning classes and they go here and they go there and they're you know they're learning how to be a Christian and they're learning how to do this how to change from coming out of the world you know uh the books for a for how to become a real believer and how to overcome in this day your life you know what you can be in all this life what are they trying to do introduce Christianity into their own nature and it's an impossibility we can never be a Christian in our own nature and that's where the majority of the world is today my friends that's why when the Rapture takes place there'll be so few the world will go right on the sad part about it is there'll be some message people that'll go right on because we've got them same type of people in our churches they're trying to become Christians in their own nature that's the reason today we have so many calling themselves Christians and living any kind of a life they've never experienced that born again that's something that changes you that takes the life out like pulling the blood out of a man that's got a certain type of blood and putting another type in him it's pulling the old life out of the man and injecting The Life of Christ in The Believer so God takes the old life out and injects himself this is what he had to do to become a son put himself in a dispensable form a dispensable form by which God the great Eternal could not ever do this but when God become a man tore open the human body released the token life God made himself where he could divide himself so here was this great Eternal the Fountain of all Purity and wisdom and Holiness and righteousness but God wanted a subdivision yeah now you might own 500 acres and you say well I want this 500 Acres but I want a subdivision both you can't have both of them if you want a subdivision you're going to have to subdivide your property you're going to have to put roads in there you're going to put water you're going to have to put setic system you're going to have to do all that sort of thing and God wanted a Divine subdivision because he's got a great big city planted up in heaven for all the inhabitants of the subdivision so God had to divide himself but how can you divide the Eternal so he started within the beginning was the word so he started there and from the division of the word separating it from himself he could start in a dispensable form and he comes on down to the breaking of the Old Testament leading into the new and he would put himself in a blood cell and when that blood cell was broke up the calvary it released the spirit of God and here they come up on the day of Pentecost and they're just sitting in there well glory to God hallelujah we're going to preach this gospel a't we Brothers I'll tell you one thing we're not sure why we're in here for Jesus told us to come and we're just sitting here waiting and maybe we're getting all of our quotes together and stuff like that and we're going to go out of here man we're going to bring people to Jesus and all of a sudden here come the big D9 Dozer and he started dividing himself here hung that Pillar of Fire and he went the subdivision started well let me tell you something it's still going on today but it ain't going to be long all the property is going to be inhabited by all those who had their title deed before the foundation of the world and all these lots are all these lots are going to be occupied and then it's going to be a great big Gathering Place and the father's going to move us up to his house and we're all going to live in a gated community [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah I'll tell you what kind of gates they are Gates of pearl you see those who never got attracted of the father's inheritance even in the new city live on the outside only the partakers of the deeded warranty of God live in the city oh my Lord you see to be married to that old nature and try to be a Christian you'll never have peace constant struggle watch the way the prophet deals with this he said talking about the church she can't be married to a denomination and be the bride of Christ at the same time amen she's got to be dead one to the other the law says so here plenty of laws in God's word that's his law Paul's speaking the same thing she cannot be a married to a church a worldly Creed and be the bride of Christ because one is contrary that's right to the other yes well we believe this but we don't believe that ah you see that same things right in the message well we believe he was inspired here yeah we we take this part here but what if that part you're leaving out was just as inspired as the part you think was inspired now she is a woman if she's married to Christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time so this concept to people have been able to remain their denominational identity and be the Bride of Jesus Christ is contrary to the word of God and contrary to the message of the hour oh but you see the issue is people are going to stick with their Church Father sir well my my uncle says my my grandpa my my pastor says if your pastor don't say this he's saying contrary to what God's Prophet Said Amen brother Donnie preach brother Donnie we're behind you brother Donnie notice she cannot live with both husbands at the same time they're contrary one to the other one is God sent and the other one is man-made you can't be a virtuous Bible believing Christian and Associate yourself and the denominational Affair so you see what they're having they're having an affair on Jesus well I'm a secret believer I maintain you know my my my my secrecy you know I I I believe it but I it be be a lot of reproach if I went up to the word of life and went up there and was identified there everybody knows what brother Donnie believes he's so stupid he just opens his mouth and tells everybody he tells the world and YouTube and everybody else yeah I do I just tell them I ain't got no secret code and we don't you don't do no hand signs and we believe the what I believe you can search our website and find it out I ain't like some of these politician preachers in the message that believe this and this and this but nobody knows it except those in the back office no if I believe in water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus I'm going to bury him up here in his name if I believe you can't smoke if I believe you can't drink I believe you can't run around I ain't going to hold it back but Brother Don we got new people coming this may be the very thing they need to hear why should I hold it back for a year or six months when they might need to hear it today they might die tomorrow come on somebody I don't want to hold back the way of life I want to tell you the truth let me close so this message here was on Thanksgiving Day 11256 and he says the pilgrim fathers are very thankful for the new found way of life being separated from the old English denominations in Creed they can marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word for their age for their day so can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated oursel from the things of the world all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God separated from the dead religions I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds to what separated us and open to us a new land thank you Lord Jesus am a new land a new message for this day Pentecost dried up and died that's why I ain't interested in going back to 1906 oh I want that original acts to yes sir I'll take that one but we got a twin I'm telling you friend and a lot of what I'm seeing in this day ain't Acts 2 it's 1906 repeat I saw it back Yonder I seen gifts hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss emotions based on this and that and the other the prophet don't tell us we'll take the Rapture by gifts we'll take the Rapture by the word and yes I believe in gifts I believe in signs but I don't follow signs signs follow me that's the right come on don't get quiet on me today I'm not going to lead you back to a 1906 and what did it produce well look at Pentecost and see what it produced why in the world I want to take you back to all that nonsense I want to take you you back to that original experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but not only just em motion and shouting but with a foundation of faith of the word that we stand with that word when we feel God we stand with that word when we don't feel God when we see signs when we don't see signs we take him at his word oh oh my separated us opened to us a new land a new message for this day Pentecost dried up and died like lucer West and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together good people in there yet has got to be come out some of y'all probably were still there what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message and you're going to the wedding in the sky and you're wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace UNM merited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there praise God He Slipped the wedding band on you there how brother Donnie in his thinking so every one of you here today everyone around the world every member of this bride of Christ whoever they are wherever they are the Lord God slipped that wedding ban amen oh my how many times have I seen it I've seen them slipped on them my you you could tell by looking at the ring and you go by the for SE and why it's really nice color really nice Cut real nice Clarity so on and so on and then you look at his and say you know a lot of the guys today wearing black and different colors of things that they're wearing but you look at it and you realize it's a significance of something and the Lord God you see it's not you put one on him Prophet Don't Preach the Christ has a wedding man on him he don't need claiming you do dearly beloved we are gathered here on the sight of God in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in the Holy state of matrimony which is commanded in the scripture by St Paul to be entered into reverently discreetly in the fear of God these two persons present have come to join together today if there's anyone who can show a Just Cause why they may not be lawfully joined together let him speak now forever hold his peace and about that time the devil started Jesus put his hand over another and say shut up [Applause] believing that you have considered this solemn obligation I will present to you the marriage covenant Lord Jesus almighty God alpha omega beginning and the end will you have this woman full of faults failures mistakes shortcomings to be your lawful wed wife do you promise to love her care for her give her your love forsaking all others cling thee only unto her so long as you shall live which is for eternity I do right will you have this man to be your lawful weeded husband do you promise to be baptized in his name do you promise to dress the way he wants you to dress do you promise to act like he wants you to act well come on somebody do you promise you'll be loyal and faithful unto him as long as you shall live then repeat these words after me I Jesus Take You My bre to be my lawful wed wife to heaven to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poor in sickness and in health thank you Lord and forsaking all others I promise a devotion unto you which is unlike anything the church will ever know we the bride take you Lord Jesus as our lawful wedded husband to heaven to hold from this day forward for Good Times bad times when we don't understand things we're going through come on help me now whenever we're going through trials and we're going through tests when we feel good when we don't feel good whenever you're doing things in our life and all it does is just raise one question after another for better for worse for richer for poor in sickness and in health and Lord God even and death we give ourselves unto you for as much as Jesus Christ and his bride have consented before these Witnesses and the Angelic host by giving an exchanging of rings and dying out of natures and exchanging of natures I pronounce they are man and wife in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you may kiss your bre he did pulled you up to the altar give you kisses of Grace sanctification more kisses of Christ baptism of the Holy Ghost your trials your difficult ulties Hallelujah for as much as Jesus Christ and his bride have consented before you Witnesses I pronounce that they are man and wife and I gladly present to you the couple ladies and gentlemen I present to you Mr and misery word hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah let's pray oh Jesus who were we that you'd slipped that wedding band on us before the foundation of the world Lord God if there's one here today and they're trying to be a Christian in their own nature help them help them to see they can't it's not like one day it'll just hit them and all of a sudden they'll they'll find this magic scripture magic quote but help them to realize it's impossible for us to be a word born Christian in our old nature but we must bring our nature to The Altar and the wrath of God will fall upon that nature and annihilate it and then the book the name and the nature the Trinity of our old self is cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness and we raise from that place man woman boy or girl with the Lord Jesus reincarnated in his church I hope they don't think I'm crazy today Lord no wonder the devil's trying to make a substitute we don't want no substitute Jesus we don't want no Church Father neither whether that would be our grandfather or Uncle our cousin whoever our favorite preacher we must be begotten by the word we want you to be our father and if you're our father we'll believe every word cuz that's who we are amen oh we worship you Jesus we worship you Jesus don't you love him today Saints with all your heart many of you have witnessed and seen so many weddings and whenever the preacher makes the pronouncement and they the bride reaches over and gets her flowers and there they stand all smiles and they head down that middle aisle and the song starts playing and either people clap their hands or whatever it is that they're doing oh what Joy what Joy what plans have been made and all the arrangements have been put forth you imagine when Christ Jesus raptures his bride the angels of God were taught that by 1965 remember in that new city not one Fallen Angel has never set one foot Satan has actually walked Before the Throne of God he's there today so Jesus said I'm going away to prepare a place for you for a couple of thousand years he's been there creating walls and Gates you imagine a pearl that is 20 some feet tall the wall is 216 ft tall Chow Sapphire amethyst Burl onx but by 1965 the walls had already been hung laid the gates had been hung and the streets had already been paved you'll find this in the church age book so if the city was just about done in 1965 think where we are today in 2024 and the prophet said that the angels are already there in the city and they're waiting breathlessly for what for what more gold more pearls you amen angels of God waiting breathlessly as they're waiting for the inhabitants as brother Daryl spoke last night about the city not just the city itself it's the people who make it up so since 1965 they've been just tidying up and getting things ready and it amazing that the city reached his state of completion two years after the Sails are open how come it wasn't two years after the cross how come it wasn't two years after the Holy Ghost fell at Pentecost once the seals come open it's so far it'll never turn back it'll never be stopped so he said I'm going to go ahead and finish it I'm just going to go ahead and finish it don't you want to go sh just make sure just make sure you're not trying to be a Christian in your own nature Hey sing something for useless let's just Worship the Lord uhuh I see why I had the offest time ever was this morning don't you anybody got any extra iPads on around your house I might need them for Wednesday nights or start walking out with five under each arm don't you see why he hates this word why don't he attack denominations why don't he attack hybrid so-called message churches notice the men he attacks notice the churches that he attacks and hates that tells you a lot about what hell thinks somebody's talking to me not long ago about their son under a rebellious time in their life and talking about going to a certain certain Church said well you know he don't mind going to this certain certain church but boy he's short and want to go over here I thought that ought to help you see how the devil thinks about that church he don't mind going to Satan hates the word of God to come forth and setting people free that's right as a man of God ordained to bear this word in the name of Jesus I command you be loosed from that which bounds you why would you let Satan rob you another day claim your rights remember what I'm speaking to you right about
