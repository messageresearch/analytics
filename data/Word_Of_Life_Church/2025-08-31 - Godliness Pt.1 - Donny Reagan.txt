[25:35] [Music]
[25:38] But I'm holding on
[25:44] to a hope that won't fade.

[26:38] Come Jesus come.
[26:44] There will be no war
[26:50] and there'll be no change
[26:56] when Jesus comes.
[27:02] Let the day be the day.
[27:08] You come for the weak,
[27:14] the strong just the same.
[27:20] And all will be
[27:25] in the power of his name.
[27:32] Come Jesus, come.
[27:37] We've been waiting so long
[27:41] [Music]
[27:43] for the day you return
[27:46] to heal every hurt.
[27:49] Ride every road.
[27:55] We need you right now.

[30:30] When the music fades
[30:33] [Music]
[30:34] and all is stripped away,

[30:47] longing just to bring
[30:52] something. That's a word
[30:55] that will bless your
[31:02] I'll bring you more than a song.
[31:07] For a song in itself
[31:10] is not what you have required.
[31:18] You search much deeper within
[31:23] through the way things appear. You're
[31:27] looking into my heart.
[31:35] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[31:41] though it's all about you.
[31:46] It's all about you, Jesus.
[31:50] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I I made
[31:56] it when it's all about you.
[32:01] It's all about you, Jesus.
[32:06] King of endless worth.
[32:11] No one could express
[32:14] how much you did. Could we really do it?
[32:22] Though I'm weak and poor,
[32:26] all I have is yours.
[32:30] Every single breath,
[32:34] Lord,
[32:36] I'll bring you more than a song.
[32:41] For a song in itself is not what you
[32:46] have required.
[32:52] You search much deeper within
[32:56] through the way things appear.
[33:00] You're looking into my heart, deep down
[33:04] in my heart.
[33:07] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[33:14] Though it's all about you.
[33:18] It's all about you, Jesus.
[33:22] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made
[33:28] it. When it's all about you,
[33:33] it's all about you, Jesus.
[33:38] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[33:44] with Lord, it's all about you. Yeah,
[33:48] it's all about you, Jesus.
[33:53] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing and the
[33:57] mess that I made when it's all
[34:02] about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[34:07] Hear my heart. I'm sorry for the mess
[34:12] that I made when it's all about you.
[34:17] Yeah, it's all about you.
[34:22] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[34:29] when it's all about you, Jesus. It is
[34:33] all about you.
[34:38] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing that I
[34:42] made it when it's all about you.
[34:48] It's all about you, Jesus.
[34:53] I'm sorry, Lord, for the messes
[34:57] that I made when it's all about you.
[35:03] And it's all about you, Jesus.
[35:09] [Music]
[35:34] Oh, heaven must be a beautiful place.
[35:42] Oh, heaven
[35:44] must be a beautiful place.
[35:51] Oh, heaven
[35:53] must be a beautiful place
[35:59] for it's filled
[36:01] with nothing but my Jesus grace.
[36:07] Oh, when heaven
[36:10] is a place that I long to see.
[36:15] Oh, heaven
[36:18] is a place that I long to see.
[36:24] Oh, heaven
[36:27] is a place that I long to see.
[36:33] Oh, Jesus died
[36:35] and he went there from Calvary.
[36:41] Well, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[36:46] to go?
[36:50] Well, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[36:54] to go?
[36:58] Well, I'm on my way home. Don't you want
[37:03] to go?
[37:07] See, have
[37:09] got a home on the other shore.
[37:15] And we've come
[37:17] too far to turn back now.
[37:21] [Music]
[37:23] Oh, we've come
[37:26] too far to turn back now.
[37:31] Oh, we've come
[37:34] too far to turn back now.
[37:40] Oh, Jesus said, "I'm going to help you
[37:44] make it somehow."
[37:48] Oh, and heaven
[37:51] must be a beautiful place.
[37:57] Oh, heaven
[38:00] must be a beautiful place.
[38:06] Oh, heaven
[38:08] must be a beautiful place
[38:14] for it
[38:17] with nothing but my Jesus grace.
[38:22] Oh, and heaven
[38:25] must be a beautiful place.
[38:31] Oh, heaven
[38:33] must be a beautiful place.
[38:40] Oh, heaven
[38:42] must be a beautiful place
[38:48] for it
[38:50] with nothing but my Jesus
[38:57] grace.
[39:00] [Music]
[39:13] And one by one by one,
[39:18] &gt;&gt; we're getting more reasons to want to
[39:21] go, aren't we?
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] We certainly
[39:26] want to extend our prayers and
[39:30] heartfelt condolences to our church
[39:33] family
[39:35] um and all the different ones that have
[39:37] passed forward in the last two weeks
[39:40] something like that.
[39:43] And we we know that we all have to come
[39:45] to it. Either that or the body change.
[39:49] But I don't know how people face such
[39:52] things without the Lord in their life. I
[39:54] know they do. But I'm just glad I don't
[39:56] have to know why and how they do.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; And as a pastor, I can tell you that
[40:03] each one that you lose, each funeral
[40:05] that you do, it's like it takes a little
[40:09] more out of you.
[40:12] Each one. Each one. Each one.
[40:16] I'm just hoping I got enough left in me
[40:19] in case the rest of y'all go.
[40:23] It's hard to explain it,
[40:25] but it's just
[40:28] it's just knowing that God in his grace
[40:31] knew that
[40:33] children of his would pass.
[40:36] It's not a sign of disapproval,
[40:40] but sometimes some flowers get really
[40:43] beautiful and in their pristine stage
[40:46] and if they stay any longer, they will
[40:48] start to go down. So, he takes them even
[40:53] sometimes when they're children.
[40:55] But we're grateful that he gives us that
[40:58] grace and that strength
[41:00] &gt;&gt; to help us to be able to deal with it.
[41:02] Aren't you? I know many of you standing
[41:04] here and you've lost loved ones. It's
[41:06] been so dear to your heart. Some of you
[41:08] I see have preached your companion's
[41:10] funeral. Maybe your children. And I I
[41:13] know that that still weighs on you, each
[41:16] of you. But I'm so grateful that we have
[41:19] a hope and a promise.
[41:23] How would it feel? How would it feel to
[41:27] love one another and to enjoy life with
[41:29] one another and yet have no hope?
[41:32] whatsoever of ever seeing each other
[41:35] again. Now, me the way I love the Lord,
[41:38] if there was no heaven, I would still
[41:41] choose him over the devil.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Y'all, y'all understand that and agree
[41:47] with that?
[41:48] &gt;&gt; No question about it. If there was no
[41:50] heaven and after that we lived this
[41:52] life, we just died and ceased to exist.
[41:54] We turned back into volcanic ash and
[41:57] cosmic light and petroleum and calcium
[41:59] and all that. And there was no heaven.
[42:01] I'd still want to live for him
[42:03] &gt;&gt; because he's been so good to me.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; And I see how the devil treats his young
[42:08] ones
[42:09] &gt;&gt; and I don't want to be a part of that
[42:10] family.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; No.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; But to know that what is waiting for us
[42:15] is so far beyond anything that our minds
[42:19] can comprehend.
[42:21] I'm not sure why the Lord let it go for
[42:24] seven church ages
[42:28] before he actually allowed one of the
[42:30] messengers to be able to go to the sixth
[42:33] dimension. Now Paul went to the third
[42:34] heaven. Brother Bham said maybe he went
[42:36] to the first or the second himself.
[42:39] But at least what God allowed brother
[42:41] Brennham to go see, he was a was able to
[42:45] tell us about it. What Paul saw was
[42:49] unlawful
[42:51] for a man to utter.
[42:54] Can you imagine what he must have seen
[42:57] and experienced, but he couldn't tell
[43:00] the people? Somehow God wanted us,
[43:04] brother John, to be able to know. Was it
[43:06] because we'd be dealing with so many
[43:08] deaths? I'm not sure what the answer is,
[43:10] but I'm so glad when he allowed his
[43:13] prophet to go beyond the curtain of time
[43:16] and not just keep it into his heart.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; But come back and say, "This is what I
[43:21] saw."
[43:23] &gt;&gt; I run into it all the time, of course,
[43:24] having to preach so many funerals and
[43:26] I'll have to preach to people that don't
[43:29] know the message and don't understand
[43:31] the message. And uh I never I've never
[43:34] had one of all the ones that I've done
[43:37] that people from different churches or
[43:39] whatever would come up and say, "I've
[43:40] never heard anything like that in my
[43:42] life. I've never heard anything like
[43:44] that. Where where where do you get that?
[43:46] Where where do you preach at? Where do
[43:47] you go to church?"
[43:49] You know, they don't understand what
[43:51] makes our funerals so different is the
[43:54] light we walk in every day.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Every day.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Every day. So, it's not like that we
[44:00] have these unique uh notes that we go to
[44:04] that nobody else has, but God's love to
[44:09] us sending his message in the end time
[44:11] has opened so many things. So yesterday,
[44:15] for those of you that were there at the
[44:16] grave site and I stood there at the head
[44:19] of the grave and
[44:22] I was just waiting for the Lord to give
[44:24] me something and as I turned and I
[44:27] looked back around this way and there
[44:30] was a corn field directly behind me. I
[44:33] mean 20 feet maybe Carol something like
[44:36] that 20 feet from this cemetery and all
[44:39] of a sudden the spirit of God just
[44:40] struck my heart and the corn is yellow
[44:43] turning yellow and brown and the Lord
[44:46] give me something and I watch them
[44:48] people as they sat there and they're
[44:49] looking at one another and they're
[44:51] looking at the corn and they're looking
[44:52] at me and you think what are they
[44:54] thinking in their minds you know they
[44:56] think what in the world are we talking
[44:58] about but you know what the message does
[45:01] it so ties us to nature.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; It ties us to the world. It ties us to
[45:06] the creation.
[45:08] And others look at it and think, "Wow,
[45:10] we walk right by that and don't even see
[45:12] it." Thank God for a prophet.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a message.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you appreciate it.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. The way I look at it, we
[45:23] are some of the most blessed people that
[45:24] live on the earth. I realize people look
[45:27] at us and they think, "Well, they can't
[45:29] do this and they can't do that and they
[45:30] can't go here and they can't go there
[45:32] and they can't do this." That's all they
[45:34] look as is the can'ts. And I'm thinking,
[45:36] my goodness, why them can'ts are the
[45:38] what keeps us out of so much trouble.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; It's what a lot of the rest of these
[45:43] people can do that gets them in so much
[45:46] trouble.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; And they look at it, my goodness,
[45:48] they're hell behind a It's like a prison
[45:51] wall. No, no, no, no. It's I don't deny
[45:54] that it's not a wall,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; but we look at it as a castle wall,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; not a prison wall.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; We could go. Oh, yes, we could go. If I
[46:05] wish to, I could compromise, never hurt
[46:07] nobody else's feelings. I could preach
[46:10] and, you know, just say things in such a
[46:12] way nobody ever get offended. Why in the
[46:14] world would I want to do that? I choose
[46:16] to go this way. I choose to preach the
[46:20] truth. I choose to be hated.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Don't you think I've preached long
[46:27] enough that I could figure out a way not
[46:29] to be hated so much?
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Many of you been serving the Lord, you
[46:33] figure out a way where you could just
[46:35] keep what you believe to yourself. You
[46:38] just don't say nothing to nobody. Why in
[46:40] the world would you want to do that?
[46:43] That's one thing that just I mean it
[46:45] just bends the devil plum out of shape.
[46:48] He hates it because we actually choose
[46:52] this way.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have it any other way.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not sure who all that was for,
[47:01] but God bless you. There you go.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2.
[47:09] So apparently everybody here at the
[47:11] church and everybody that's been
[47:13] streaming
[47:15] must have got everything they need
[47:18] needed to acquire to on patience.
[47:23] Either that or you prayed like you ain't
[47:24] never prayed in your life and said,
[47:26] "God, please get him off of it."
[47:29] Because today we're going to be talking
[47:30] about godliness. So whichever way it
[47:33] went, you know,
[47:35] second Peter 1:2,
[47:38] "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[47:41] through the knowledge of God and of
[47:42] Jesus our Lord,
[47:45] according as this divine power has given
[47:47] unto us all things that pertain unto
[47:50] life and godliness,
[47:52] through the knowledge of him that hath
[47:54] called us unto glory and virtue, whereby
[47:58] are given unto us exceeding great and
[48:00] precious promises,
[48:02] that by these you might be partakers of
[48:06] the divine nature, having escaped the
[48:09] corruption that is in the world through
[48:13] lust.
[48:15] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[48:18] add to your faith virtue,
[48:21] and to virtue knowledge,
[48:24] and to knowledge temperance, and to
[48:27] temperance patience,
[48:30] and to patience godliness,
[48:34] and to godliness, brotherly kindness,
[48:37] and to brotherly kindness, charity.
[48:41] And may be remembered today as we pray.
[48:44] Amen. me too.
[48:46] Heavenly Father, as we stand here today
[48:50] and as a church family, we can't keep
[48:52] from feeling
[48:54] heaviness in our hearts for not for
[48:57] those who have passed beyond the curtain
[48:59] of time, but for those who are left
[49:02] behind.
[49:03] All of us that have lost a loved one or
[49:06] many that we have have loved so much and
[49:10] felt so
[49:12] cared for so deeply. We know what that's
[49:15] like. And even though each relationship
[49:17] is a little bit different, we can relate
[49:20] somewhat. Each marriage is a little
[49:22] different. The structure of the family
[49:23] is a little different, but we have a a
[49:26] similar feeling anyway. So, we're
[49:29] praying, Lord, for those that have lost
[49:32] loved ones in our our assembly.
[49:35] And we're praying, dear Father, that you
[49:37] would comfort their hearts. I heard the
[49:40] prayer requests that Brother Louie had
[49:41] read a while ago, the different ones
[49:43] that are sick and going through
[49:45] different things, Father. And Lord, we'd
[49:47] like to remember Sister Kylie McGraw.
[49:49] They went up to the meetings and
[49:51] Harrisonenberg this weekend and um she
[49:54] had another one of those things she's
[49:56] been dealing with and they had to have
[49:58] her in the hospital while they were
[49:59] there and doing scans and things on her.
[50:02] We're just praying for her, sister,
[50:03] Lord, that you'd be with her, that you
[50:05] would help her. Father, we're believing
[50:08] for a complete deliverance of this thing
[50:10] in her body.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, there were many hands that was
[50:13] uplifted today and you saw mine. I'm so
[50:16] needy of you, Jesus. I pray that you'd
[50:19] help me today, Father, that I can be
[50:21] able to get out of the way, Lord. Carol
[50:24] and I after to the funeral and the
[50:26] burial there yesterday, going to see
[50:29] some of our precious, dear friends,
[50:31] Brother Homer and Sister Ruby Blanken,
[50:34] and Lord, and their daughter Donna
[50:37] Susong, and unable to to get out and go
[50:40] to church anymore because of age and
[50:43] physical things in their body. And Lord,
[50:46] we're just praying for them today again,
[50:48] Father, that you'd help them, that you'd
[50:50] be with them, Lord. And as we as we sat
[50:53] and talked and then we stood and talked
[50:55] and and and had prayer for them, dear
[50:58] God, our hearts just reached to them.
[51:02] They've went to church for years and
[51:04] years and decades of their life and got
[51:07] a little small church building there by
[51:09] their house and just can't have church
[51:11] no more cuz brother Homer can't do it.
[51:14] So we pray you'd be mindful of them,
[51:16] Lord. But they told us they have church
[51:19] every night because they listen to Word
[51:21] of Life and they listen to Brother Tim
[51:23] Puit and Brother Jason Watkins and they
[51:26] just listed off a bunch of churches
[51:28] where that they stream their services.
[51:30] And I thought, well, thank you, Lord. At
[51:33] least there's a good side to the
[51:34] streaming part anyway. So we pray you'd
[51:37] be mindful of your children. Carol and I
[51:39] was backing out of the driveway. I've
[51:40] told her, you know, the thing of it is
[51:42] there's people just like this all over
[51:44] the world. They can't go to church no
[51:47] more, Lord, and they're just they're
[51:50] just longing to go home and yet they
[51:52] feel like you've got a purpose in them
[51:54] living. So, be mindful of your children
[51:56] around the world today. Would you, Lord?
[51:59] Speak to us from your word. Father, I
[52:01] pray in the name of Jesus. And the
[52:03] saints said,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be se
[52:08] seated.
[52:15] You would think if anybody had faith,
[52:19] virtue,
[52:21] knowledge,
[52:23] temperance,
[52:24] patience,
[52:26] wouldn't that pretty much cover
[52:29] everything that you would have need of
[52:33] in this journey
[52:35] as a child of God?
[52:38] And maybe some of you are looking at
[52:40] that and think, "Wow, if I would arrive
[52:42] to just having that, I would feel like
[52:46] that I was really an accomplished
[52:49] growing Christian."
[52:52] And yet the spirit of God anointed Peter
[52:55] when he was writing this. And that
[52:58] that's the thing about the the
[53:00] penmanship of the word that we don't
[53:03] know that these brothers set and pray
[53:06] and the spirit of God, but give them
[53:08] something and they would write it down
[53:10] and they'd read it and then they'd
[53:12] reread it and look over it. Lord, does
[53:14] it need to be tweaked a bit? Do I need
[53:17] to use this word and instead of that
[53:19] word? Do have have I got it in the right
[53:22] order? Have I got it exactly the way it
[53:24] is? faith and virtue and knowledge.
[53:26] Lord, have have I have I got it? Am I
[53:28] leaving anything out? And I believe that
[53:32] God is the one who moved upon these men
[53:35] to write the Bible. Don't you? I don't
[53:38] think the Bible was written by man. I
[53:41] believe that God used them and used
[53:44] their penmanship and their ability to be
[53:46] able to write either the Hebrew language
[53:48] or the Greek or the Aramaic, whatever
[53:50] language that they wrote it in. And I
[53:52] believe that God anointed them and God
[53:55] helped them. And it was not so much
[53:57] Peter sitting down and thinking, you
[53:59] know what, Paul has wrote a bunch of
[54:01] letters to the church and James has
[54:04] wrote some letters and Matthew has
[54:06] written his his uh gospel and Mark and
[54:08] Luke and John. So, you know, I'm one of
[54:11] the original apostles. Maybe I should
[54:13] sit down and write something, too. Maybe
[54:15] I I need to let the people hear from me.
[54:18] I don't believe that's the way this come
[54:20] about. I don't think that these men
[54:22] decided, well, I don't want John to get
[54:24] all the glory and me not even write
[54:26] anything at all. I believe the spirit of
[54:28] God moved upon their hearts and God gave
[54:31] them things a little bit different from
[54:34] the other and yet made what they had to
[54:37] say very unique. Now remember that God
[54:40] is putting the five-fold ministry on
[54:43] display in the epistles that are written
[54:47] by them even before the full five-fold
[54:50] ministry began to be expressed. Now
[54:53] remember Paul the church age messenger
[54:55] had not even come on into birth yet
[54:57] whenever some of these men had started
[54:59] preaching. So Paul was still against the
[55:02] move of God. So the spirit of God
[55:04] started using Matthew and the way that
[55:07] he wrote and Mark and Luke and John and
[55:09] then 1 and 2 Corinthians which was
[55:11] written around 59 AD which they say is
[55:14] one of the first books that was written
[55:15] in the New Testament. And the spirit of
[55:17] God would make them by their gift they
[55:20] would view problems and issues and
[55:22] troubles in the church and by their gift
[55:24] the spirit of God would move on them and
[55:27] give them the ability to deal with that
[55:29] just like God does. Whenever I'll preach
[55:32] on something, then God sent an
[55:33] evangelist in here, he and I don't talk.
[55:36] Yet, by his gift, the spirit of God will
[55:38] anoint him. He'll deal with some of the
[55:40] same stuff, but in a total different
[55:43] way. That's exactly the way the Bible
[55:45] was written in the New Testament. Now,
[55:47] God was expressing that. So, here Peter
[55:50] felt led of the Lord. And no doubt Peter
[55:53] is a man after having received the Holy
[55:55] Ghost and becoming so humble. Huh? Man,
[55:59] can you imagine using the word Peter and
[56:02] humility before he got the Holy Ghost?
[56:05] But I I I just cannot believe that Peter
[56:08] after receiving the Holy Ghost had been
[56:11] so transformed that his wife, his
[56:14] mother-in-law, the people that knew him
[56:17] were overwhelmed by the way the spirit
[56:20] of God had changed this man because they
[56:23] saw what a fire brand he was. They saw
[56:26] that, you know, that Peter was
[56:28] constantly right out there making one
[56:30] mistake after another and yet they would
[56:32] see him kind of pull back. And when you
[56:35] see the the time frame by which first
[56:37] and second Peter was written, it wasn't
[56:39] that he was the first one said, "Well,
[56:41] I'll tell you one thing. I'm going to
[56:42] give my opinion first. I'm going to
[56:44] write my book first." No, his was
[56:46] written many, many years even after Paul
[56:50] started writing things. You know what
[56:52] that shows me? That shows me what the
[56:54] Holy Ghost does to a man and how it
[56:57] changes the arrogance and the pride of a
[57:00] man that says, "I'll tell you one thing.
[57:01] No matter what anybody else does, I'll
[57:03] stand for you, Jesus. I'll love you.
[57:06] I'll do this and that." Peter had some
[57:08] real humility, didn't he? He had to
[57:10] learn it the hard way. But the spirit of
[57:12] God would not let him get over why. He
[57:15] reserved something. And may I say to
[57:18] every God called man that we've got here
[57:19] in our assembly, you may never preach
[57:21] great convention. Some of you brothers,
[57:23] you may travel, may never travel around
[57:25] the world and go to the different
[57:27] countries that brother Daryl does, but
[57:29] you don't have to. What you need to do
[57:31] is find what God wants you to do. Now,
[57:35] you you may never be one that'll preach
[57:38] every weekend and during the middle of
[57:39] the week. My goodness, Brother Daryl,
[57:41] bless his heart, he's gone so much and
[57:43] travels so much and goes around and some
[57:45] of the rest of you brothers, you may
[57:46] never be that. But it doesn't mean that
[57:48] you're not that just that important to
[57:50] God as brother Daryl or any other man
[57:53] is. But the thing is when we find what
[57:56] God wants us to be. Now Peter never
[57:58] wrote one epistle and then another then
[58:00] another then another then another. He
[58:02] just wrote this. It wasn't even
[58:04] addressed to a particular church. He did
[58:07] not write the way Paul did to Ephesus to
[58:09] Samrraa to Pergamos to Thotyra. He
[58:12] didn't write that way. Just the epistle
[58:14] of Peter. And it was written to who? All
[58:18] of the body of Christ. Now, whenever God
[58:20] knew that this was going to be written,
[58:22] and God had already had the symbols that
[58:25] had been hid about this statue of a
[58:27] perfect man in the Old Testament, and he
[58:30] had a man by the name of Enoch, and he
[58:33] was down in the land of Egypt, and he
[58:35] was a great apparently a great architect
[58:38] and a man of great understanding because
[58:41] he was able to catch certain dimensions
[58:45] and certain things in the the scale of
[58:48] the pyramid.
[58:49] that have not even been found out until
[58:52] our generation. There's certain arches
[58:56] in the pyramid, certain steps and angles
[58:59] of ascent and angles of descent that was
[59:02] had been mysterious form and written in
[59:05] stone in the pyramids for thousands of
[59:09] years. And it's been in our day since we
[59:12] have been born, many of us, that they
[59:14] found out the curvature and the arc of
[59:17] this and the perimeter of that. And yet
[59:19] God had a man to write it in stone. Oh
[59:23] my. Thousands of years ago. So then
[59:26] whenever brother Brandham then was going
[59:28] to preach this statue of a perfect man,
[59:31] he could have choose different types of
[59:34] geographical measures. Now we know that
[59:36] God loves circles. God loves ellipts.
[59:41] God loves all different types of things.
[59:44] He loves rectangles, which is the way
[59:46] that the tabernacle was meant. Now, the
[59:48] tabernacle was not a circle. It was not
[59:50] a perfect square, but it was a
[59:53] rectangle. God loves the elliptical type
[59:56] things. God loves all types of things.
[59:59] But yet, God chose one particular
[1:00:02] geographical measure by which that he
[1:00:06] would have that foreshadowed in the Old
[1:00:07] Testament. And then he would do the same
[1:00:10] thing in the new and it was what? The
[1:00:13] pyramid. Now God could have used if he
[1:00:16] wanted a square, a circle. He could have
[1:00:18] used whatever he wanted. But God chose
[1:00:21] this geographical measure called the
[1:00:24] pyramid. Now it shows that in the Old
[1:00:26] Testament and he chose it now bringing
[1:00:29] into the spiritual body and he anointed
[1:00:32] Peter. Now Peter never picked up the
[1:00:35] geographical measure so much. All he
[1:00:37] done was wrote what God gave him. And
[1:00:40] Peter, no doubt, whenever he was writing
[1:00:42] this, he probably didn't even view the
[1:00:44] pyramid at all. So that shape laid in
[1:00:48] the mind of God for all of those years.
[1:00:52] And then he brings another prophet on
[1:00:54] the earth in the last days. And then
[1:00:57] that prophet, when he's going to bring
[1:00:59] in some of the things about his ministry
[1:01:02] to the bride, what does God do? He has
[1:01:06] him to go back to the same geographical
[1:01:09] measure that Enoch used in the Old
[1:01:13] Testament. Now, what is it? Not a
[1:01:15] rectangular, not a circle, not a
[1:01:17] semicircle, not the elliptical plane,
[1:01:20] but God had him to use the pyramid. So
[1:01:24] now, when Brother Brandon preaches this,
[1:01:26] he lays it out and it's like it's
[1:01:28] unfolding to him. Now, I'm sure if
[1:01:32] you're you listen to tapes very much and
[1:01:34] you'll watch how that the spirit of God
[1:01:36] will move on the prophet and he would
[1:01:38] give him certain messages. And what I
[1:01:40] like to do is I'll follow him after he
[1:01:43] preaches something like say the statue
[1:01:45] of a perfect man. And I'll listen to
[1:01:48] that, you know, 25, 30 times, whatever.
[1:01:50] And then after I listen to that, I'll go
[1:01:53] to the ones immediately after that he
[1:01:56] preached that like blasphemous names and
[1:01:59] different ones like that. And you'll
[1:02:01] watch him that he'll sometimes bring a
[1:02:04] consensus consensus and condense it
[1:02:07] together and there'll be certain little
[1:02:09] keys in there and once I catch them then
[1:02:13] I go back again and listen to the
[1:02:15] stature of a perfect man again. And it's
[1:02:18] amazing how it comes together. So it's
[1:02:20] like God would give it to him and then
[1:02:23] as he would preach even later he'd begin
[1:02:25] to talk more about it and more about it
[1:02:28] and he was seeing more himself. Now
[1:02:31] whenever he preaches this statue of a
[1:02:33] perfect man and he wants to bring in
[1:02:35] this diagram which we I'll show it to
[1:02:38] you maybe not today and you're familiar
[1:02:40] with it and that is of the pyramid. So
[1:02:43] then he draws the seven lines across the
[1:02:45] pyramid and then he begins to mention
[1:02:48] the virtues and then it's like as he's
[1:02:51] going on that God begins to tie together
[1:02:55] for him that the virtues there was seven
[1:02:57] of them and there was seven church ages
[1:03:00] and there was seven church age
[1:03:02] messengers and then he uses this
[1:03:04] together to bring out a spiritual
[1:03:07] diagram that we'd be able to see
[1:03:09] ourselves but also see the church ages.
[1:03:12] Then as he keeps on going and preaching
[1:03:15] even from the stature of a perfect man
[1:03:17] to blasphemous names then it's like a
[1:03:20] little more opens up. Now this was
[1:03:22] October the 14th I believe it was in '
[1:03:24] 62 and then blasphemous names was in
[1:03:27] November. So it's like that he began to
[1:03:29] see more about it. Now in between that
[1:03:32] time there was a sister in the church
[1:03:34] which I've quoted it to you was sister
[1:03:36] shepherd and she had this dream and then
[1:03:40] she she wrote a letter to the prophet
[1:03:43] and gave him the dream and then as soon
[1:03:46] as he read the letter God broke him into
[1:03:50] the realm of vision. Now this is the way
[1:03:53] dreams are interpreted according to the
[1:03:56] Bible. Now you know everybody is
[1:03:59] different in their their first
[1:04:01] conscience and second conscience. Many
[1:04:03] of you people probably dream dreams and
[1:04:05] they are so vivid and you just know
[1:04:07] beyond a shadow of a doubt that they
[1:04:09] have a spiritual meaning. Not
[1:04:10] necessarily. Sometimes all it is is that
[1:04:13] your subconscious and your first
[1:04:16] conscience are so close together. Now I
[1:04:18] knew a preacher friend of mine. He's
[1:04:20] gone on to glory. Bless his heart. He
[1:04:22] was one of the most vivid dreamers I
[1:04:24] ever heard from in my life. As a matter
[1:04:26] of fact, he would send me dreams all the
[1:04:29] time by email and by letters as if
[1:04:31] though I could interpret them. And he
[1:04:33] would tell me, "Brother Donnie, I saw
[1:04:35] this one in 3D or I saw this one in
[1:04:38] technicolor. I saw this one this way and
[1:04:41] that way now to him because it was that
[1:04:45] real." He just knew that it meant
[1:04:47] something. But I'm telling him, brother,
[1:04:49] I don't have the ability to interpret a
[1:04:51] dream and it would always be full of
[1:04:54] symbols. So it would be three this and
[1:04:57] four that and going over a bridge and up
[1:04:59] a mountain and then down the other side.
[1:05:01] It would have colors in it. Well, there
[1:05:03] was something white in the dream and
[1:05:04] there was something black in the dream.
[1:05:06] Now, you know, to him it was so real
[1:05:08] because apparently his conscience and
[1:05:10] first conscience was so close when he
[1:05:12] had come out from having that dream. It
[1:05:14] would imprint something on his memory so
[1:05:16] close that he would be able to write it
[1:05:19] down. And oh my, did he ever write them
[1:05:21] down.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And they were real to him. And yet I'd
[1:05:24] tell him the same thing every time. And
[1:05:26] I'd give him the quotes. The prophet
[1:05:28] said that only a prophet can be able to
[1:05:30] interpret a dream. But I know, brother
[1:05:31] Donnie, I know, but this has to mean
[1:05:33] something. Now, when brother Brandon
[1:05:35] picked up this letter and he read the
[1:05:37] letter, he said as soon as he started
[1:05:39] reading it, he went into a vision. Now,
[1:05:42] I want you to notice what the vision
[1:05:43] was. His vision was her dream in a
[1:05:48] prophetic format. So, watch now. So he
[1:05:52] picks up the letter and he begins to
[1:05:54] read her dream. Now whenever he does, it
[1:05:58] didn't happen of course no doubt to
[1:05:59] everybody's dream. But when God had
[1:06:02] something he wanted the prophet to say
[1:06:04] and bring to the body, not only to the
[1:06:07] present tense people, but to us. Can you
[1:06:10] imagine? God knew we would be hearing
[1:06:13] this this morning. And God used Sister
[1:06:16] Shepherd to have this dream. Now
[1:06:18] remember the reason that Sister Shepherd
[1:06:21] no doubt could be one that God could use
[1:06:23] for this because Sister Shepherd was
[1:06:26] wondering whether or not she had the
[1:06:29] Holy Ghost. She was questioning about
[1:06:32] having the Holy Ghost. Look at the
[1:06:34] setting of the dream. So she was
[1:06:37] questioning do I have the Holy Ghost?
[1:06:39] Now brother Ram when he mentions this in
[1:06:41] vice famous names he said anybody that
[1:06:43] knows brother and sister shepherd knows
[1:06:45] that they are so hospitable and they
[1:06:47] bring anybody into their home and
[1:06:48] they're kind to people and they do this
[1:06:50] and that and he said that God honored
[1:06:53] that. Now watch how he takes that and he
[1:06:55] said and that was her foundation which
[1:06:57] was her foundation of faith. And then he
[1:07:00] said but she's wondering whether or not
[1:07:02] she has the Holy Ghost and she laid
[1:07:04] across a dualfold. He says, "And then
[1:07:07] she fell asleep." Now in this as he is
[1:07:10] preaching before he preaches or brings
[1:07:13] this dream, he preaches the stature of a
[1:07:16] perfect man. And to that God allows this
[1:07:19] woman to have the dream. Now remember
[1:07:21] her dream is do I have the Holy Ghost?
[1:07:24] This is what she's wondering about. And
[1:07:26] a lot of our dreams come from things
[1:07:28] that we're thinking about and pondering
[1:07:30] over. And she laid down on the
[1:07:32] dualfofold in the living room. And when
[1:07:34] she did, she fell asleep. So in this
[1:07:37] dream, as the prophet picks up the
[1:07:39] letter and with his eyes wide open, he
[1:07:42] goes to dreaming her dream in prophetic
[1:07:45] form, which means he had a vision. So he
[1:07:48] sees the same thing that she saw except
[1:07:53] this time through a vision. Now he said,
[1:07:55] "How can I be sure that you're
[1:07:58] interpreting my dream if you never have
[1:08:01] my dream?" Now you see there's people
[1:08:03] selling the message in spite of what
[1:08:05] brother Brandham said that somebody had
[1:08:07] a dream about this and about that. Well,
[1:08:09] you know, the birds meant this and the
[1:08:11] the creek meant this and the rock meant
[1:08:13] that and something else. I don't care
[1:08:15] who they are. I'm not going to listen to
[1:08:17] them
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; because that's contrary to the teaching
[1:08:21] of the message of the hour.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Now remember Nebuchadnezzar's dream.
[1:08:25] Remember him and all the souss and the
[1:08:27] wise men come up and then they said,
[1:08:29] "Well, we don't know what it is." But
[1:08:31] Daniel said, "But there is a God who
[1:08:33] knows the secrets of their hearts." And
[1:08:35] what did Daniel and these brethren pray
[1:08:37] for? They prayed God would give them
[1:08:39] understanding. What happened to Daniel?
[1:08:41] He saw Nebuchadnezzar's dream in the
[1:08:44] form of a vision. Now remember that God
[1:08:47] is not just giving this answer to Sister
[1:08:50] Shepherd. No doubt there was all type of
[1:08:52] people that wrote Brother Brandham
[1:08:54] letters and he would have never divulged
[1:08:57] what was on the inside of that letter.
[1:08:59] But he must have felt led of God. I'm so
[1:09:02] glad that he obeyed that because in this
[1:09:05] actually he preaches the stature of a
[1:09:07] perfect man. It goes on to a little
[1:09:10] further understanding. Now this is the
[1:09:13] thing for probably many of you that are
[1:09:15] either visible audience or those of you
[1:09:17] that have been following us and shaming
[1:09:19] these things as we've been dealing
[1:09:21] wondering about them that many of you
[1:09:22] may wonder and ponder over the same
[1:09:25] thing. Am I sealed? Do I have the true
[1:09:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost? Am I just am
[1:09:32] I just tricking myself? You know, and
[1:09:34] and the thing of it, we know that people
[1:09:36] can be anointed by the spirit of God.
[1:09:39] People can be anointed to sing, anointed
[1:09:42] to cast out devils, anointed to do all
[1:09:44] kinds of things and not truly be born
[1:09:46] again. And the anointing can come on
[1:09:49] people and then go off of people. But
[1:09:52] once you receive the true baptism of the
[1:09:54] Holy Ghost in your soul, you may not
[1:09:57] always feel that when you're going
[1:10:00] through hard things in life. But
[1:10:02] remember, it never leaves you. And it
[1:10:05] will strengthen you and keep you and
[1:10:08] help you even when you don't feel his
[1:10:12] presence.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Now, let's be honest. There's something
[1:10:15] about the anointing that is very
[1:10:18] comforting. It is very, very comforting.
[1:10:21] I am an absolute nervous wreck. Even
[1:10:24] though I've been preaching for years of
[1:10:25] my life, I am a nervous wreck until I
[1:10:29] can feel the anointing come on me. And I
[1:10:32] don't mind telling you, I would I'd much
[1:10:35] rather preach a three-day sermon than I
[1:10:37] would to do a wedding or a funeral or
[1:10:39] any type of public speaking like that.
[1:10:41] It's just not who I am. I know there's
[1:10:43] brothers in the message and they're
[1:10:45] great speakers. They don't even need the
[1:10:47] anointing to speak. They're and I'm not
[1:10:49] degrading them now. They're just gifted
[1:10:51] speakers. I am not a gifted speaker.
[1:10:54] That's why sometimes I come to visit you
[1:10:56] in the hospital and say, "Boy, brother
[1:10:57] Donnie was really silent." Well, I am.
[1:11:00] I'm waiting for him to give me
[1:11:01] something. I'm waiting for him to give
[1:11:03] me some inspiration. Some And you
[1:11:05] saying, "Oh, my preachers have got it
[1:11:07] automatically." Well, I can tell you
[1:11:08] this one don't. I have to wait on him. I
[1:11:12] need the uncction of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:11:15] the anointing will move. That's why the
[1:11:17] angel of the Lord would drop down.
[1:11:18] Brother would say, "You know what I'm
[1:11:20] waiting on? I'm waiting on him." Why? He
[1:11:22] couldn't do that. He could talk about
[1:11:24] the Lord and share the goodness of God,
[1:11:26] but he's waiting for inspiration. But
[1:11:29] remember, when we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:11:31] and our soul, then it's different from
[1:11:34] the anointing that you will feel to sing
[1:11:37] and worship or maybe you get under the
[1:11:39] anointing on service and praise God.
[1:11:41] Hallelujah. And your faith will rise to
[1:11:44] a level. You walk out that door and the
[1:11:46] anointing, nine times out of 10 it'll be
[1:11:48] gone before you ever get in your car to
[1:11:50] go to the house. Is that right? So God
[1:11:53] don't want you to overcome by the
[1:11:56] anointing being upon you, but he wants
[1:11:58] you to overcome by the divine nature of
[1:12:01] his life living in your soul.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Now remember, Sister Shepherd no doubt
[1:12:06] had heard some of these things. If
[1:12:08] you'll follow the sermons in 1962,
[1:12:10] Brother Brandham is coming into a
[1:12:12] transition time. He's coming into a time
[1:12:15] of change of his ministry, presentation
[1:12:17] of my ministry, preaches, key to the
[1:12:19] door, many different things that he
[1:12:20] preaches. And he's coming into a
[1:12:22] transition time, but so is the church
[1:12:25] age. Now remember, God will move the
[1:12:27] prophet messenger along as the church
[1:12:30] age goes. Sometimes you'll send him in
[1:12:31] advance and he'll preach things way
[1:12:34] above the season and the time waiting
[1:12:36] for the people to catch up with him. And
[1:12:38] here, this is where they were at that
[1:12:40] time frame. So this is why in
[1:12:42] blasphemous names that he says this is
[1:12:44] the problem with the Brandham
[1:12:46] tabernacle. There's two kinds of faith,
[1:12:48] two kinds of virtue, two kinds of
[1:12:50] knowledge. Now remember that he didn't
[1:12:52] say this when he preached the statue of
[1:12:55] a perfect man. But it was like after the
[1:12:57] dream of Sister Shepherd and the prophet
[1:13:00] opened up the prophetic realm to him
[1:13:02] that he begin to see more about it
[1:13:04] himself. I can follow that kind of man
[1:13:07] myself. Now remember, sister shepherd is
[1:13:10] really concerned about the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:13] Now watch then when brother Brandham
[1:13:14] brings this and he reads his scriptures
[1:13:17] again of course. Let's read it again if
[1:13:18] you would in second Peter chapter 1:5.
[1:13:21] And beside this giving all diligence add
[1:13:23] to your faith virtue and to virtue
[1:13:25] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[1:13:27] and to temperance patience and to
[1:13:29] patience godliness. Now let's look at
[1:13:32] him when he preaches it in the statue of
[1:13:34] a perfect man. But you've got genuine
[1:13:37] faith, then put virtue to it, then
[1:13:40] genuine knowledge, then genuine
[1:13:42] temperance, then genuine patience. See,
[1:13:44] you're moving right up the line. All
[1:13:48] right. Fifthly, add godliness. Now, here
[1:13:52] comes number five, godliness. Fifthly,
[1:13:56] add godliness. Oh my. Godliness to be
[1:13:58] added. What does godliness mean? I
[1:14:02] looked in four or five dictionaries and
[1:14:04] couldn't even find what it meant.
[1:14:07] Finally, I was down at brother Jeff
[1:14:10] there. This is a brother that lived not
[1:14:12] too far from where Harry and I lived
[1:14:14] over over in Kentucky. I met him several
[1:14:16] years ago. And brother Brandon was
[1:14:18] looking. So, he was searching and he
[1:14:21] couldn't find the meaning of godliness.
[1:14:23] Don't you love an honest man like this?
[1:14:25] So, he didn't just come to church and
[1:14:26] say, "Well, glory to God. I was out in
[1:14:28] some great supernatural phenomenal
[1:14:30] realm." No, he told us he looked in a
[1:14:32] dictionary.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, he said, "I looked
[1:14:36] four or five dictionaries and I couldn't
[1:14:38] even find what he meant. I finally I was
[1:14:40] down at brother Jeff there and we found
[1:14:43] it in a dictionary. Godliness means to
[1:14:47] be like God." Godliness means to be like
[1:14:52] God. Now, oh my, after you've got faith
[1:14:56] and virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:14:59] patience to be like God, you say, "I
[1:15:02] can't do that, Brother Brennan." Oh,
[1:15:03] yes, you can. Let me read a few
[1:15:05] scriptures you're just a minute. Matthew
[1:15:07] 5:48. We'll take this one. See what it
[1:15:09] sounds like. If you're supposed to be
[1:15:11] like God, you know what the Bible says?
[1:15:14] Ye are gods. Jesus said so. Why? All the
[1:15:18] virtue, all the things that's in God is
[1:15:21] in you. Matthew 5:48 Jesus speaking in
[1:15:24] the biatitudes be ye therefore and he
[1:15:27] spells it pect.
[1:15:31] What's that? Perfect. Even as your
[1:15:33] father in heaven is perfect. You got way
[1:15:37] up here before you have to do that. Now
[1:15:39] notice if God would have started that
[1:15:41] off at the as the first virtue while it
[1:15:44] would have so discouraged us as human
[1:15:47] beings that we thought perfect what
[1:15:49] there's no way that I start there. So
[1:15:52] what did God do? He started it at the
[1:15:54] lower level the initiation stage which
[1:15:57] even sinners can have an element of
[1:15:59] faith. Of course you have to believe
[1:16:00] there is a God to even be saved. And he
[1:16:03] keeps rising higher and higher and
[1:16:06] higher with it. And he puts godliness as
[1:16:10] number five. Now he says, "Be you
[1:16:12] therefore perfect, even as your father
[1:16:14] in heaven is perfect." You got way up
[1:16:16] here now for you have to do that. All
[1:16:20] these things has to be added first. God
[1:16:23] knows exactly which one to put at number
[1:16:25] five, which one to put at number two,
[1:16:27] which one to put at number seven. Aren't
[1:16:29] you glad he knows?
[1:16:31] Now notice then when you get up there,
[1:16:34] he's asked you to be perfect godliness,
[1:16:36] sons and daughters of God. That's right.
[1:16:39] How many things I could say along that
[1:16:42] line? Now, I find this amazing because
[1:16:45] now we jump on down into this same
[1:16:47] message and brother Brandham reads this
[1:16:50] scripture, Ephesians 4 11. Why would he,
[1:16:55] talking about perfection and talking
[1:16:58] about the virtue of godliness, ever read
[1:17:02] Ephesians 4:11?
[1:17:05] You're familiar with it, but let's read
[1:17:07] it. He gave some apostles, some
[1:17:09] prophets, some evangelists,
[1:17:12] some pastors, and teachers. Now, I want
[1:17:15] you to notice that when Paul wrote this,
[1:17:17] he made each one of these gifts or
[1:17:20] offices in the plural form.
[1:17:23] So no one man can fulfill them all one
[1:17:27] time and be fulfilled and that's the end
[1:17:29] of it.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Apostles plural and the church said
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; prophets plural, evangelists plural,
[1:17:40] pastors plural, teachers plural,
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. And now remember this is the
[1:17:48] apostolic faith that the prophet of God
[1:17:51] was sent to restore us back to of what
[1:17:54] Paul preached in the beginning. And the
[1:17:56] church said, "Now notice what God does."
[1:17:59] So God gives these gifts and these are
[1:18:02] are gifts from the Lord God himself for
[1:18:06] this is the reason why he gives them for
[1:18:08] the perfecting of the saints. So here,
[1:18:11] brother Brandham is dealing with
[1:18:12] godliness and he reads this scripture
[1:18:15] and ties it into being perfect.
[1:18:20] What in the world? For the perfecting of
[1:18:24] the saints. Now perfecting may not mean
[1:18:27] what you and I get in our mind that it
[1:18:28] does. We're not talking about human
[1:18:31] sinlessness or being free from fault,
[1:18:34] but this is what perfecting means. Look
[1:18:38] at the word complete furnishing or
[1:18:42] equipping. So God gave the five-fold
[1:18:46] ministry to completely furnish the body
[1:18:50] or equip the body with what they would
[1:18:53] have need of to bring them to the state
[1:18:57] of godliness. Well, it ain't no wonder
[1:18:59] to me then why Satan hates the ministry
[1:19:02] around this message the way he does.
[1:19:04] Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; My goodness, friends, can you imagine?
[1:19:08] Can you imagine a time to when people
[1:19:10] would say they're restored back to the
[1:19:12] original faith and yet this move around
[1:19:15] the message which is gaining momentum
[1:19:17] around the world and preachers are
[1:19:19] sitting down and quit quitting preaching
[1:19:21] and people are making fun of preachers
[1:19:23] and make fun of people having church and
[1:19:26] say all you need to do is stay home and
[1:19:29] just everybody stream one tape of
[1:19:30] brother Brandham at a time. If that's
[1:19:32] so, I want to know why brother Brandham
[1:19:34] didn't set that up himself.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Because brother Random was a true word
[1:19:39] prophet. That's why. Because brother
[1:19:41] Brandon believed in going to church.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz the Bible tells you to go to church.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And the and the word of life church said
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; that's right. Now notice for the
[1:19:52] perfecting of the saints. The perfecting
[1:19:57] of the saints. for the perfecting of the
[1:19:59] saints. On the meaning of this word, I
[1:20:01] can't even say the word of what it
[1:20:03] means, but it means the restoring also
[1:20:06] of anything to its place. Then putting
[1:20:10] it in order and making it complete. The
[1:20:15] restoring of something to its place and
[1:20:19] putting it in order and making it
[1:20:22] complete. Now, keep the church body in
[1:20:24] mind, but also keep the church ages in
[1:20:27] mind and keep yourself in mind. Because
[1:20:31] when we're born into this world, we're
[1:20:33] born lost, of course, and regenerate
[1:20:36] from the presence of God. And we're born
[1:20:38] out of order. Even when we get saved, we
[1:20:42] start trying to get back in order. And
[1:20:45] for some, it'll take longer than others,
[1:20:47] but God trying to get their life back in
[1:20:49] order. I hope you can understand this
[1:20:52] stature of a perfect man is your divine
[1:20:55] order given to you by God.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; So you see whenever we try to take faith
[1:21:01] and emphasize faith miracles
[1:21:03] supernatural faith faith faith faith
[1:21:05] faith and we try to set the capstone
[1:21:07] down on top of faith. Can you imagine
[1:21:09] say the base stone of faith being this
[1:21:12] big all the way across the the the altar
[1:21:16] area here and then the capstone is only
[1:21:18] this wide and we set the capstone right
[1:21:21] down here in the middle. What about all
[1:21:23] this vacant space that we've got over
[1:21:25] there? The capstone will never set down
[1:21:27] on faith. And yet that's where much of
[1:21:30] Christianity is in the age we live. They
[1:21:32] never go any further than being saved.
[1:21:34] There's a believe there's a God. They
[1:21:36] believe that God sent his son to the
[1:21:38] earth. They don't want to go to hell. So
[1:21:39] they accept him as their savior and then
[1:21:42] Lord cap me off. Take me to heaven. And
[1:21:43] then they want the capstone to set right
[1:21:45] down. So you've got all this vacancy all
[1:21:49] across the rest of their face. But if
[1:21:52] you let God put the building together,
[1:21:54] when the honey flows out of the rock box
[1:21:57] on the top, the five streams of grace
[1:22:00] and the water form will come down and
[1:22:03] wash down every side and start bubbling
[1:22:05] out sticks and stones and debris and all
[1:22:08] types of things. And the water, which is
[1:22:11] the spirit of God, which no one can hold
[1:22:13] consistently. And then what will happen
[1:22:16] in the sister's dream? What she sees is
[1:22:19] a big man.
[1:22:22] A big man.
[1:22:25] A big man.
[1:22:28] And this big man's pouring water into
[1:22:30] the rock box and it's bubbling out the
[1:22:33] debris and all that sort of thing. And
[1:22:35] she stood down at the bottom and
[1:22:37] actually the water come from the top and
[1:22:40] washed down the sides and got her feet
[1:22:43] wet. Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Her feet wet.
[1:22:50] Her foundation wet.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But the water didn't come up to her
[1:22:54] thighs. The water didn't come up to her
[1:22:57] chest. The water didn't come up to her
[1:23:00] head. Remember what she's praying about?
[1:23:02] Do I have the Holy Ghost? In her own
[1:23:05] dream was the answer to where she was.
[1:23:11] Don't you see? If God can help you and I
[1:23:15] to see where we are, then we know how to
[1:23:18] journey on. If we've got the water level
[1:23:22] and it's on it our feet level or it's up
[1:23:24] to our virtue level or our knowledge
[1:23:27] level, God is trying to show us so we
[1:23:30] can move higher and higher and higher so
[1:23:34] we can get ready to meet the Lord Jesus
[1:23:36] in the air.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; You understand? So when the water comes
[1:23:42] down, it winds up on her feet, which was
[1:23:46] her foundation. Now she didn't
[1:23:48] understand what the dream actually
[1:23:49] meant. And the prophet is now
[1:23:50] interpreting to her, "Look, sister
[1:23:52] shepherd, where you are, the water was
[1:23:55] on your feet on the foundation level."
[1:23:59] Then this big man takes and pours honey
[1:24:04] inside this same rock box. And the man
[1:24:06] and the big man remember when the
[1:24:08] prophet saw the dream and turned around
[1:24:10] and said that that man was actually the
[1:24:13] messenger of the church age.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; But I thought brother Brandon was a
[1:24:18] little man.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; He was a little man in stature but he
[1:24:21] was a big man when it come to position.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. I want you in
[1:24:26] dreams funny how they are. And you
[1:24:28] imagine whenever he whenever he sees
[1:24:31] that dream over again and he sees
[1:24:34] himself in the dream pouring this stuff
[1:24:37] in the rock box and he said now this
[1:24:41] will hold. Won't you notice? Oh glory to
[1:24:44] God. I want you to notice what virtue
[1:24:47] that he comes and he's identifying with
[1:24:50] this and it's when he preaches it that
[1:24:52] it's godliness but his virtue of this
[1:24:56] age that God come to manifest out of him
[1:25:00] for the church age was what faith was a
[1:25:03] great thing but that was not the main
[1:25:06] focus of him and yet that's what many
[1:25:08] people attribute to brother Brandham the
[1:25:10] books that you read about him the things
[1:25:13] that people said about him oh great
[1:25:14] supernatural, great faith, great this.
[1:25:16] But we know that it come from more than
[1:25:19] miracles.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; What was the virtue that the seventh
[1:25:24] church age was going to represent?
[1:25:27] Brotherly kindness.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness. So, here's the
[1:25:31] stream of his ministry. What was that?
[1:25:33] It was simply the bait on the hook in
[1:25:37] order to catch the rainbow trout people
[1:25:40] and get the rainbow trout people into
[1:25:43] the body of God where he could start
[1:25:46] building on them layer after layer after
[1:25:49] layer. Now, God knew that brother
[1:25:50] Brandon would not live physically long
[1:25:52] enough to complete the entirety of the
[1:25:55] gentile bride. So, God already had a
[1:25:58] plan. What was it? God called men that
[1:26:01] would feed upon that same message. They
[1:26:04] would come and preach what that
[1:26:06] messenger preached. Come on, somebody.
[1:26:09] They would preach it in the pastor
[1:26:10] office, in the evangelist office, in the
[1:26:13] teacher office, and they would begin to
[1:26:16] preach and build and supply and be able
[1:26:20] to bring the people of God into a spot
[1:26:23] that they would keep getting higher and
[1:26:25] higher and higher until finally the last
[1:26:29] one will reach that place and the
[1:26:32] resurrection will come.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Now, notice this.
[1:26:37] Paul goes on to say, "For the perfecting
[1:26:41] of the saints, for the work of the
[1:26:42] ministry." Now, notice the gifts are
[1:26:45] plural, but the ministry is singular.
[1:26:48] Paul doesn't say ministries.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say ministries, but there's
[1:26:54] only one ministry. You understand people
[1:26:55] around the message who hate the
[1:26:57] ministry. You understand whose ministry
[1:26:59] it is? They hate the ministry of Jesus
[1:27:01] himself. That's right. Because there's
[1:27:03] only one really true God- called
[1:27:05] ministry and that's the ministry of the
[1:27:07] Lord Jesus. Then he gives gifts of
[1:27:10] himself in plural form. But brother John
[1:27:13] the ministry comes back to the singular
[1:27:15] which is the Lord Jesus himself. Now
[1:27:17] notice so the ministry is given for the
[1:27:20] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[1:27:23] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:27:26] body of Christ building. Oh my. So this
[1:27:31] is the way we're going to get built. So
[1:27:34] the ministry is going to help build us.
[1:27:38] Not just our trials, not just the things
[1:27:39] we go through in life, but the ministry
[1:27:42] will have the divine building blocks,
[1:27:44] the components of God to help. And they
[1:27:47] follow the leadership of the spirit of
[1:27:48] God. And it will build in the people of
[1:27:51] God what they have need of. So when they
[1:27:54] go through their great trials, they
[1:27:56] won't fail and they won't come short. Oh
[1:27:59] my. because God wants to equip them. And
[1:28:02] God wants the preachers, listen to me,
[1:28:05] preacher brothers. This is the main
[1:28:07] thing we're called for. We're not called
[1:28:10] so we can have a big ministry and people
[1:28:12] can know our name and so many people
[1:28:14] view our website. We are called to edify
[1:28:17] the body of Christ.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It's not about me. It's not about
[1:28:22] preachers around the message. We're
[1:28:23] servants to the children of God. And the
[1:28:26] church said,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; notice now, so edifying is building
[1:28:30] wherewith one may edify. The act of
[1:28:34] building or building up the act of one
[1:28:38] who promotes another's growth in
[1:28:42] Christian wisdom, piety, happiness,
[1:28:47] holiness.
[1:28:48] Praise God. That's what every God called
[1:28:51] man and the message of the hour should
[1:28:54] be doing. It should not be competition
[1:28:57] between that man and this man and that
[1:28:59] man and that man. It should be building
[1:29:01] up the body of Christ that the body of
[1:29:04] Christ can receive these things, wisdom
[1:29:07] and piety and happiness and spiritual
[1:29:10] growth as far as what God wants them to
[1:29:14] be. Oh my, don't you appreciate the Lord
[1:29:16] his mercy for the perfecting of the
[1:29:19] saints, for the work of the ministry,
[1:29:20] for the edifying of the body of Christ.
[1:29:24] So whenever God put this in the church,
[1:29:26] now remember God could have give
[1:29:28] governors, he could have given senators,
[1:29:30] he could have give congressmen, he could
[1:29:32] have given prime ministers, presidents,
[1:29:33] God could have done whatever he wanted
[1:29:35] to do. But it was God's choice to preach
[1:29:38] to have men preach. And as Paul called
[1:29:41] it, foolishness.
[1:29:44] The foolishness of preaching. How would
[1:29:47] you like for your job to be called that?
[1:29:50] How would you sisters like for your job
[1:29:53] to be called the foolishness of a
[1:29:55] housewife, the foolishness of a mother,
[1:29:59] the foolishness of a father, the
[1:30:02] foolishness of a brother? God himself
[1:30:05] called my office foolishness. I said,
[1:30:06] "Thank you, sir."
[1:30:09] Well, can I get out of it? Nope. You're
[1:30:11] going to be a fool. You're going to be
[1:30:13] thought a fool. You're going to act like
[1:30:15] a fool. You're going to be made a fool
[1:30:16] out of. So, just accept it. So, where's
[1:30:18] all the drama come from? From the
[1:30:20] preachers that want to be, you know,
[1:30:21] like Hollywood stars.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. For the edifying of the
[1:30:29] body of Christ. So, it's all intended to
[1:30:31] minister to the uplifting and the
[1:30:34] building of the church within and
[1:30:37] without. Then notice verse 13. Now,
[1:30:40] remember the prophet reads all three of
[1:30:41] these verses when he refers to it in the
[1:30:43] statute of a perfect man. Till we all
[1:30:46] come in the unity of the face and of the
[1:30:50] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; perfect
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness a perfect man.
[1:31:00] Look at this word now. Tio again it's
[1:31:03] not sinlessness.
[1:31:05] full age brought to its end, finished
[1:31:10] wanting nothing necessary to
[1:31:13] completeness.
[1:31:15] Consummate
[1:31:17] human integrity and virtue of men
[1:31:21] fullgrown
[1:31:22] and mature
[1:31:25] unto the stature of a perfect man, unto
[1:31:29] the measure of the stature of the
[1:31:32] fullness of Christ. So, we're not
[1:31:33] comparing each other to each other.
[1:31:36] We're not comparing us to an
[1:31:38] organization. We're not comparing us to
[1:31:40] some church over here or some church
[1:31:42] over there. But our measuring rod, our
[1:31:45] measuring tape is not the pastor. Our
[1:31:48] measuring tape by which we measure
[1:31:51] things by. It is who? The Lord Jesus
[1:31:54] himself.
[1:31:56] Oh my. Now, of course, most of us want
[1:31:58] to take his name off the measure and
[1:32:00] take put our name on there. Then we're
[1:32:02] the measurement. Our church is the
[1:32:04] measurement. That's you know that's oh
[1:32:06] that that's a thing I hate about that
[1:32:07] sort of thing. You know whenever it
[1:32:08] comes that way that everybody wants to
[1:32:10] make their church the ideal church. You
[1:32:12] got to shout like our church does. You
[1:32:14] got to sing like our church sing. You
[1:32:16] got to praise the way our church does.
[1:32:17] Y'all's music ain't like our church. But
[1:32:19] you know what? This ain't your church.
[1:32:21] Well unless of course you come here and
[1:32:22] then it's your church. But everybody
[1:32:24] wanted them to be the perfect example.
[1:32:26] God said I'm gonna eliminate that whole
[1:32:28] thing. I've got this measuring tape that
[1:32:30] I made myself. I'm going to put my own
[1:32:33] name on it and I'll be the one that you
[1:32:35] measure yourself by. Cuz you know what
[1:32:37] we do? We'd pick people that's a whole
[1:32:40] lot worse off than we and our say,
[1:32:41] "Glory to God. I'll tell you one thing.
[1:32:42] I ain't like them." That's what they
[1:32:44] done in the in the New Testament. Was it
[1:32:46] not the Pharisees? I thank you, Lord.
[1:32:48] I'm not like that old publican. I thank
[1:32:50] you, Lord. I fast twice in the week. I
[1:32:53] pay ti. I do this and the other. That's
[1:32:55] what humans do. But God said, "Get that
[1:32:57] out of your mind. I'm the measuring
[1:32:59] tape."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Notice he goes on in the
[1:33:04] statue of a perfect man. And he said,
[1:33:05] "Now, perfect takes
[1:33:09] godliness."
[1:33:11] Wow. Perfect takes godliness. You have
[1:33:15] to add to your faith godliness. See, you
[1:33:17] start off up here with virtue. Then you
[1:33:19] go to knowledge. Then you go to
[1:33:21] temperance. Then you go to patience. Now
[1:33:24] you're on godliness. godliness. Oh my,
[1:33:27] our time's getting away. I see. But you
[1:33:29] know what God in this meant?
[1:33:33] You sing this song
[1:33:35] to be like Jesus.
[1:33:39] To be like Jesus. On earth.
[1:33:42] I long to be like him.
[1:33:45] All through life's journey from earth to
[1:33:47] glory. I only ask
[1:33:51] to be like him.
[1:33:55] So Carol asked me yesterday,
[1:33:57] "You preaching on patience tomorrow?" I
[1:33:59] said, "Don't think so."
[1:34:03] She said, "God and this." I said,
[1:34:04] "Yeah." She said, "What is it?" I said,
[1:34:06] "I ain't telling you."
[1:34:09] Said, "Well, can't you give me a little
[1:34:10] bit of an idea?" I said, "To be like
[1:34:12] God." She said, "But how how am I going
[1:34:15] to be like God?" I said, "You're going
[1:34:16] to hear about it tomorrow."
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; I said, "But let me sum it up for you in
[1:34:21] this way.
[1:34:23] It will be the traits and the
[1:34:25] characteristics
[1:34:27] of God in a man or a woman, boy or girl,
[1:34:31] that has been changed by his power. And
[1:34:35] they will be so much like God as far as
[1:34:38] a human in an unredeemed body
[1:34:43] can be.
[1:34:48] Boy, I thought there for a minute I was
[1:34:50] going to have to start being like Jesus.
[1:34:51] Even in my flesh, there ain't no way
[1:34:53] that'll ever happen. Brother John, John
[1:34:56] Hornac will always be John Hornac until
[1:34:59] John Hornac is no longer John Hornac.
[1:35:02] All of his kids are Horniacs.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. And they will
[1:35:08] always be Hornacs until they're no
[1:35:10] longer Hornacs.
[1:35:12] And you sat there and laugh at a Horny.
[1:35:14] Well, it's the same way with Parkers and
[1:35:16] Smiths and Reagan and Browns and Elliots
[1:35:18] and you know all the rest of you.
[1:35:19] There's an element of us that will never
[1:35:21] be like Jesus. So, go ahead and breathe
[1:35:24] a sigh of relief. But you know what
[1:35:27] we're waiting for? When the stature of a
[1:35:30] perfect man is molded within our
[1:35:32] spiritual being, then from the soul, God
[1:35:36] will change us back and the image of God
[1:35:39] will be recreated in every elect seed of
[1:35:43] God. Then when it reaches its climax and
[1:35:46] the perfection comes on the earth in the
[1:35:50] perfection, listen to me. I hope I don't
[1:35:51] choke you to death. It will be the
[1:35:53] perfection according to what the prophet
[1:35:56] said of the son of man.
[1:36:00] The perfection of the son of man. You
[1:36:04] understand that through the ministry of
[1:36:06] the last day seventh angel that God's
[1:36:09] calling his people to himself. It's not
[1:36:12] through the cry of a church. It's not
[1:36:14] through the cry of an organization. It's
[1:36:17] not through a shout of a bunch of
[1:36:19] preachers. God used one man to bring the
[1:36:22] message of the hour. And then out from
[1:36:25] under him, the ministry of others will
[1:36:28] come and say what he said. Come on
[1:36:30] somebody, let's have church this
[1:36:32] morning. And through that, it will
[1:36:34] produce a bride around the world. Oh,
[1:36:37] you say, "Brother Donnie, how in the
[1:36:38] world can we ever come to the unity of
[1:36:41] the faith? The preachers don't even get
[1:36:43] along. Churches don't even get along."
[1:36:46] Well, I don't know how it's going to be,
[1:36:47] but if my God said it, it will be. Just
[1:36:51] because preachers have caused difficulty
[1:36:54] does not eradicate the need of the
[1:36:56] five-fold ministry. Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Because if you want to become factual,
[1:37:06] let's become factual for a few minutes.
[1:37:09] Where's a lot of these false doctrines
[1:37:11] in the message preached by preachers
[1:37:13] come from? They come from quotes and the
[1:37:15] message brought by brother Renham.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; So, should we throw the message away
[1:37:22] because people misuse the quotes? Look
[1:37:24] at the Lord Jesus. words that he said
[1:37:27] has caused people to stumble. Words that
[1:37:30] Paul said, word that the Bible said.
[1:37:32] Come on, somebody.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; So, we I guess we're supposed to do away
[1:37:36] with the Bible. Absolutely not. We just
[1:37:38] realize you got to have understanding.
[1:37:42] You've got to be able to read it in the
[1:37:44] light of the day you're living in. How
[1:37:46] glad I am we're living in this day.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Now, notice after he sings the words of
[1:37:52] this song, he said, "That's godliness.
[1:37:56] When he was smit on one side of his
[1:37:59] face,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; he turned the other one.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; When he was spoken rough to
[1:38:09] he didn't speak,
[1:38:14] he didn't r
[1:38:16] godly.
[1:38:18] Always looking for one thing. One thing
[1:38:23] I always do, that which pleases
[1:38:26] the father. Here is the summation of
[1:38:30] godliness.
[1:38:32] It will be God's traits as far as a
[1:38:37] human being can go each according to
[1:38:40] their own adoption.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus and a housewife. Jesus and a
[1:38:47] farmer. Jesus and a architect. Jesus and
[1:38:51] a preacher.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus living out his life.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus turning his cheek and his own
[1:39:00] human body.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus turning my cheek and my body.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus turning your cheek
[1:39:09] and your body.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:15] Notice he says Peter again and to
[1:39:19] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:39:21] patience and to patience godliness. Now
[1:39:24] you know I'm curious and I like the
[1:39:26] meanings of words. So I did quite a
[1:39:28] search on on the word godliness and the
[1:39:31] noun form of godliness is the quality or
[1:39:35] practice of conforming to the laws and
[1:39:39] wishes
[1:39:41] of God.
[1:39:44] devoutness and moral uprightness. You
[1:39:47] don't have it, brothers. You can't find
[1:39:48] it. The quality of being godly, obeying
[1:39:53] and respecting God. Godliness reflects
[1:39:58] divine character, encompassing reverence
[1:40:02] for God, devotion for God, and ethical
[1:40:06] conduct essential for spiritual growth.
[1:40:10] And all of that is summed up in these
[1:40:13] four words. To be
[1:40:16] God like
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; to be godlike.
[1:40:26] So can anybody imagine Jesus looking at
[1:40:29] pornography?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Uh brothers, I think I lost everybody.
[1:40:38] Testing one, two, one, two.
[1:40:42] Can you imagine Jesus hating?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Jesus
[1:40:51] not being kind and forgiving, not being
[1:40:55] merciful,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; godliness.
[1:41:04] 1 Timothy 2:1.
[1:41:07] Now, I not only wanted to look up just
[1:41:09] godliness, but godly.
[1:41:12] 1 Timothy 2:1, I exhort therefore that
[1:41:15] first of all, supplications, prayers,
[1:41:17] intercessions, and giving of thanks be
[1:41:19] made for all men, for kings, and for
[1:41:22] that those that are in authority, that
[1:41:24] we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.
[1:41:30] Wow, wouldn't that be awesome if every
[1:41:32] church member set that to be their goal?
[1:41:35] quiet and peaceable life in all
[1:41:39] godliness. Now, here's a little bit
[1:41:40] different Greek word and it is holiness,
[1:41:44] reverence, respect, piety towards God.
[1:41:51] Verse nine. In like manner also that
[1:41:54] women adorn themselves in modest apparel
[1:41:56] with shamef facedness and sobriety,
[1:42:00] not with broaded hair or gold or pearls
[1:42:03] or costly array,
[1:42:06] but which becomethst women professing
[1:42:11] to be like God.
[1:42:16] So, can you imagine the majority of
[1:42:18] Christian women in the day that we live
[1:42:20] whenever they dress the way they do and
[1:42:22] put their bodies on public display?
[1:42:27] And say they're being like God.
[1:42:31] Notice he wrote this. Women who profess
[1:42:34] godliness.
[1:42:36] And in this one, the meaning of this is
[1:42:38] reverence towards God's goodness. Now,
[1:42:41] again, it's a different word. Theoa. So
[1:42:44] it's a different word. So Paul would use
[1:42:46] one uh Greek root word and then another
[1:42:49] one then another one. So he uses several
[1:42:51] different words here, but it still comes
[1:42:53] back to the foundation of the word God
[1:42:55] in the New Testament comes from the
[1:42:57] Greek word theos. So it's to be like
[1:43:01] theos, which is the same Greek word word
[1:43:03] we get the word theophony from. So when
[1:43:06] we reach the elements of God's stature,
[1:43:10] climbing up higher, every step, every
[1:43:13] virtue that you and I come to, we're
[1:43:16] coming closer to our theophony body.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Let me close with this one. First
[1:43:28] Timothy
[1:43:30] 3:16.
[1:43:32] For without
[1:43:35] controversy,
[1:43:37] great
[1:43:39] is the mystery
[1:43:42] of godliness.
[1:43:46] So there is a mysterious form in this
[1:43:50] virtue that is not in faith
[1:43:54] or virtue or knowledge or temperance.
[1:43:58] Now notice the form that Paul describes
[1:44:02] this godliness. For great is the mystery
[1:44:05] of godliness. God
[1:44:10] was manifest in the flesh,
[1:44:13] justified in the spirit,
[1:44:15] seen of angels, preached
[1:44:20] unto the Gentiles. Who did? God.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:26] So the mystery of godliness is God
[1:44:31] in human flesh.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Preaching.
[1:44:36] Amen. Hallelujah. Preaching, working,
[1:44:40] living, doing what mortals will do.
[1:44:43] Great is the mystery of godliness.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; I about had a spell when I found this.
[1:44:54] God was manifest in the flesh, justified
[1:44:57] in the spirit, seen of angels, preached
[1:45:01] unto the Gentiles, believed on in the
[1:45:05] world. Here you go. Here's your finale.
[1:45:08] Received up into glory.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Great is the mystery of godliness. So
[1:45:15] God was manifested in his first seed
[1:45:18] son. Hallelujah. And what is going to be
[1:45:21] the pattern of that hair from
[1:45:22] thereafter? The stature of a perfect man
[1:45:26] was what? God in. Amen. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:45:31] I heard a little bit of brother Wayne's
[1:45:32] service the other night and I tell you
[1:45:34] one thing, it was absolutely awesome up
[1:45:36] at up at brother Ron's meeting and he
[1:45:38] was talking about that we have of the
[1:45:41] throne there in heaven. that God has a
[1:45:44] man set him on the throne because it was
[1:45:48] man who lost his position in the Garden
[1:45:50] of Eden. And God once more has achieved
[1:45:54] a human body sitting on the throne of
[1:45:57] God. What's it a sign of? That there's
[1:45:59] more sons and daughters of God coming
[1:46:02] and God is working out this mystery in
[1:46:05] your life. Oh, I know you think it ain't
[1:46:07] very deep. Brother Donnie being kind.
[1:46:10] Anybody can do that. And there really
[1:46:12] nobody will be able to attain to the
[1:46:14] mystery of godliness. Only the godlike
[1:46:17] theos children. Only the elect of God
[1:46:21] will ever be able to achieve to the
[1:46:23] stature of a perfect man. People can go
[1:46:26] to church. They can heal the sick. They
[1:46:28] can pray for the dead and them get up
[1:46:30] and still wind up being lost. But every
[1:46:34] man, woman, boy, and girl, seed of God
[1:46:36] that's ordained to eternal life, God
[1:46:39] will not rest until theos is developed.
[1:46:43] So in your soul that he can look at
[1:46:46] himself and look at you and say, I see
[1:46:49] the same thing. I see me in you.
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:47:00] Hallelujah. Listen
[1:47:06] to the New International Version. I
[1:47:09] thought some of these wordings was
[1:47:11] really interesting.
[1:47:13] Beyond all question, the mystery from
[1:47:16] which true God in the springs is great.
[1:47:21] He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated
[1:47:23] by the spirit, was seen by angels, was
[1:47:26] preached among the nations, was believed
[1:47:29] on in the world, was taken up into
[1:47:32] glory. God's word translation says it
[1:47:35] this way. The mystery that gives us our
[1:47:39] reverence for God.
[1:47:43] Don't you understand? This is why even
[1:47:45] Christians don't reverence God anymore.
[1:47:48] They don't reverence his word anymore.
[1:47:51] They don't reverence his house anymore.
[1:47:53] They don't even reverence his house
[1:47:54] enough to come and be at it.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; And some that do come and be at it, they
[1:47:58] don't reverence it. They text, they
[1:48:00] talk, they're back and forth, they're
[1:48:02] shopping, they're at Walmart, and
[1:48:04] they're supposed to be there reverencing
[1:48:05] the house of God. But this is the source
[1:48:09] that gives you your reverence to his
[1:48:12] presence and to his house and to his
[1:48:16] body.
[1:48:19] The mystery that gives us our reverence
[1:48:21] for God is acknowledged to be great. He
[1:48:25] appeared in his human nature, was
[1:48:28] approved by the spirit, was seen by
[1:48:31] angels, was announced throughout the
[1:48:34] nations, was believed in the world, was
[1:48:37] taken up to heaven in glory. literal
[1:48:40] standard version
[1:48:42] and confessedly
[1:48:45] great
[1:48:47] is the secret
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; of piety
[1:48:52] who was revealed in flesh. Who was the
[1:48:57] secret of piety?
[1:49:01] You see, friends, there's no way for us
[1:49:03] to ever truly get away from our
[1:49:06] hypocrisy
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; as human beings
[1:49:10] until we are truly born again.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can be as good a
[1:49:18] hypocrite as a human being.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; They can be deceitful. They can hate
[1:49:24] you. And yet before public eye, oh my,
[1:49:27] they'll put on the dog as we say, and
[1:49:29] they'll treat you so good. And people
[1:49:30] think, boy, they love them so much and
[1:49:32] they and in reality they hate you.
[1:49:35] They're saying thinking things about you
[1:49:37] in your heart. You understand that lays
[1:49:38] in every one of us.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; There's only one way for that to be
[1:49:42] eradicated. Where'd that come from? The
[1:49:44] devil.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Great is the secret of piety.
[1:49:54] He was revealed in the flesh, declared
[1:49:57] righteous in the spirit.
[1:49:59] seen by messengers, preached among
[1:50:02] nations, believed on in the world, taken
[1:50:06] up in glory.
[1:50:11] Can I read a couple more scriptures and
[1:50:12] we'll close. But refuse profane and all
[1:50:16] wives fables, and exercise thyself
[1:50:19] rather unto godliness.
[1:50:22] For bodily exercise profitth little, but
[1:50:26] godliness is profitable
[1:50:29] unto all things. So you see, once a
[1:50:31] person breaks into this virtue, you'll
[1:50:35] find every avenue of your life. It's
[1:50:38] more than just wearing the little
[1:50:40] bracelet around your arm. What would
[1:50:42] Jesus do?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; A lot of folks wear them certainly don't
[1:50:46] do what Jesus does.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; But when we get these virtues, we'll
[1:50:50] find them applicable. in every aspect of
[1:50:53] our life. In the way we treat one
[1:50:54] another, in the way we treat our family,
[1:50:56] the way we treat our wives, our
[1:50:57] children, in the way we treat sinners.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:51:04] 1 Timothy 6:3. If any man teach
[1:51:06] otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
[1:51:08] words, even the words of our Lord Jesus
[1:51:11] Christ, unto the doctrine which is
[1:51:13] according to godliness,
[1:51:16] he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting
[1:51:19] about questions and strives of words.
[1:51:24] Whereof cometh envy, strife, railings,
[1:51:28] evil surmisings, perverse disputings of
[1:51:31] men of corrupt minds, destitute of the
[1:51:34] truth, supposing that gain
[1:51:37] is godliness,
[1:51:39] from such withdraw thyself. But
[1:51:42] godliness
[1:51:44] with contentment
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; is great
[1:51:49] gain. Yes.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Godliness
[1:51:54] with contentment. So once you arrive to
[1:51:57] that level of godliness and you have
[1:52:00] contentment with it, you realize I am a
[1:52:03] wealthy person.
[1:52:07] Would somebody come out and help me jump
[1:52:08] off my vehicle so I can get to church?
[1:52:10] Could I borrow $3 to go get some gas?
[1:52:12] Could I borrow? People say, "Oh, they
[1:52:14] ain't worth nothing." It depends on how
[1:52:16] how you're measuring their wealth.
[1:52:18] Oh, if you can have money and have all
[1:52:20] them sort of things and have this too,
[1:52:22] fine, go with it. But if you can't have
[1:52:24] one or the other, I'd go with I'd forego
[1:52:26] the money. I'd rather stand on the side
[1:52:28] of the road and bump over some of these
[1:52:29] homeless people and say, "I'll preach
[1:52:30] for 25 cents. I'll preach for 35 cents.
[1:52:33] I'll dig a hole in your yard. I I I'll
[1:52:36] kill swamp rats. I'll do this, that, the
[1:52:38] other." I'd rather have to drink branch
[1:52:40] water and eat soda crackers, as a
[1:52:41] prophet said. And to know that I was
[1:52:43] right with God than to be the richest
[1:52:46] preacher in the world and to have fame
[1:52:48] and fortune and wind up being lost, what
[1:52:50] good would it do me?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; But godliness
[1:52:57] with contentment
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; great.
[1:53:02] Paul, a servant of God, an apostle of
[1:53:04] Jesus Christ, according to the faith of
[1:53:07] God's elect and the acknowledging of the
[1:53:09] truth which is after godliness.
[1:53:14] Let's stand together.
[1:53:20] Second Peter 3:11, seeing then all these
[1:53:23] things shall be dissolved, what manner
[1:53:26] of persons ought you to be in all holy
[1:53:29] conversation? Now this word don't mean
[1:53:32] what you think. It ain't just your
[1:53:34] talking.
[1:53:36] The word conversation is manner of life,
[1:53:40] conduct,
[1:53:42] and behavior.
[1:53:44] Matter of life, conduct, and behavior.
[1:53:49] What manner of persons ought you to be
[1:53:51] in all holy conversation
[1:53:54] and
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; godliness?
[1:53:57] Yes, sir.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:54:00] to be like
[1:54:03] God.
[1:54:05] Let's sing that little song, Harry. To
[1:54:07] be like Jesus.
[1:54:09] How many wants to be like him?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just heal the sick the
[1:54:15] way he did.
[1:54:16] I believe in miracles. You know I do. We
[1:54:18] have our our church has the supernatural
[1:54:21] signs of God among us and we're grateful
[1:54:23] for that.
[1:54:25] But we know you can have that and still
[1:54:26] not be like him.
[1:54:29] I personally have never asked God for
[1:54:30] wealth or riches. I've never asked him
[1:54:32] for things. That's not been my goal in
[1:54:34] life.
[1:54:36] But I know one thing. There's there's
[1:54:39] some words and I'm longing to hear. I've
[1:54:42] lived all my life since I've been a
[1:54:43] Christian for this simple goal in my
[1:54:46] life that I can hear these simple words.
[1:54:51] Well done,
[1:54:53] my good and faithful servant. Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care if nobody knows my name. I
[1:54:59] don't care if whenever I pass away and
[1:55:01] die, I ain't going to leave a whole lot
[1:55:04] of stuff behind me. That's for sure.
[1:55:07] If after I go my sermons are took down,
[1:55:10] I'm forgotten in a few years, which I
[1:55:12] will be,
[1:55:14] that don't matter to me.
[1:55:16] But what matters to me when I walk up
[1:55:18] before him and I take care of both hand
[1:55:20] and we walk up there side by side
[1:55:24] that he can look at me and say,
[1:55:27] "Thank you
[1:55:29] for suffering for my wife.
[1:55:33] I put you under so much stuff
[1:55:37] for my wife's sake."
[1:55:40] And I saw you along that journey and I
[1:55:42] know most of what you went through in
[1:55:45] life.
[1:55:47] It was not for yourself.
[1:55:50] It was my wife's family problems, my
[1:55:53] wife's marital problems. It was my
[1:55:57] wife's financial crisis.
[1:56:00] It was my wife's deaths. It was my
[1:56:02] wife's sicknesses.
[1:56:05] And you did that for my wife.
[1:56:12] It'll be worth it, brother John. You
[1:56:14] imagine when we walk up before him and
[1:56:16] the king stands there and he says, "I
[1:56:18] see what you've went through
[1:56:21] for my wife."
[1:56:23] And those of you that have reached out
[1:56:24] and helped one another and done this and
[1:56:26] that and the other to make life a little
[1:56:28] bit easier for other people, just
[1:56:30] remember he has a great book written
[1:56:32] called a book of remembrance.
[1:56:35] times when you've got up and prayed and
[1:56:37] you didn't feel like it. Maybe the Lord
[1:56:38] wake up at 1:00 in the morning or two
[1:56:40] and put me on your heart. I want to
[1:56:42] thank you for getting up and praying for
[1:56:44] me.
[1:56:45] I want to thank you for doing that.
[1:56:47] Maybe the Lord put Brother Daryl on your
[1:56:49] heart. You may not know he's out
[1:56:50] somewhere fighting a terrible, terrible
[1:56:51] battle, one of these other preacher
[1:56:53] brothers.
[1:56:54] And you stand before the Lord Jesus and
[1:56:57] he unveils all that stuff. I see
[1:57:00] everything you did.
[1:57:03] Aren't those the words you want to hear?
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Well done,
[1:57:07] my good and faithful servant.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; I don't serve God for reward. I I don't
[1:57:12] really even think that way. That's not
[1:57:13] my mind.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Way I figured even if I got a reward, my
[1:57:18] guardian angels between them and Carol,
[1:57:20] they'll get everything I'm supposed to
[1:57:21] get anyway.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; I'm so accidentrone this and that and
[1:57:26] the other. Guardian angels are good at
[1:57:27] give every farthing. And if there's
[1:57:29] anything left, Carol will get the rest
[1:57:31] of her for putting putting up with me. I
[1:57:33] apologize to her all the time. Not
[1:57:36] because I've been mean to her, not
[1:57:37] because I've ever run out on her or
[1:57:39] anything like that, but I just apologize
[1:57:41] for what I've put her through because of
[1:57:43] the ministry sake. So I don't serve him
[1:57:46] for reward. I don't even want one.
[1:57:50] But if I can know that he's pleased
[1:57:54] just a little bit, just well done.
[1:57:58] Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus.
[1:58:09] To be
[1:58:14] and remember Jesus never questions his
[1:58:17] word.
[1:58:19] Jesus never doubts his word.
[1:58:25] Jesus never takes the word of family
[1:58:27] members
[1:58:29] above his word. We could preach on this
[1:58:32] for years.
[1:58:34] Godliness
[1:58:36] all through my journey
[1:58:40] from earth to glory.

[2:04:05] that I might
[2:04:07] become him
[2:04:10] by grace.
[2:04:16] He
[2:04:18] became me
[2:04:21] that I might
[2:04:24] become him
[2:04:27] by grace.
[2:04:29] [Laughter]
[2:04:33] He
[2:04:35] took my place
[2:04:39] that I
[2:04:41] through his love could take him.
[2:04:50] Oh, he
[2:04:52] became me
[2:04:56] that I might
[2:04:59] become him by grace.
[2:05:06] For he
[2:05:09] became me
[2:05:12] that I might
[2:05:15] become him
[2:05:18] by grace.
[2:05:24] He
[2:05:26] became hallelujah God. Thank you Jesus
[2:05:30] that I might
[2:05:33] become. Aren't you grateful
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; that he would do such a thing?
[2:05:38] [Applause]
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; He
[2:05:43] took my place
[2:05:46] that I
[2:05:49] through his love
[2:05:51] could take him.
[2:05:58] Oh, he
[2:06:00] became me.
[2:06:04] that I might
[2:06:07] become him
[2:06:10] by grace.
[2:06:15] Oh, he

[2:06:21] that I might
[2:06:24] become him
[2:06:27] by grace.
[2:06:33] He
[2:06:35] became me
[2:06:39] that I might
[2:06:42] become him
[2:06:45] by grace.

[2:07:50] We worship you Lord God.
[2:07:55] Hallelujah.
[2:07:59] So he became me that I might become him.
[2:08:05] So he took on my image,
[2:08:09] felt my humanity
[2:08:11] that I might feel his deity,
[2:08:14] that I might feel his faith,
[2:08:17] his virtue.
[2:08:20] He fought human battles with my level
[2:08:22] and my measure of faith, my measure of
[2:08:25] patience,
[2:08:27] my measure of virtue,
[2:08:29] my measure of all of these great things.
[2:08:33] and he overcome my measure and he said,
[2:08:36] "Now I'm going to give you my measure
[2:08:39] back for yours."
[2:08:42] It sounds like to me you and I certainly
[2:08:46] got the best of the trade.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord God.
[2:08:56] We bless your name, Lord Jesus. Thank
[2:08:59] you, Father.
[2:09:01] Father, I don't know when and I don't
[2:09:03] know how many, but I know one thing for
[2:09:06] sure. There will be a people around the
[2:09:08] world that will obtain to this word.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They will have it, Father.
[2:09:18] They are unstoppable.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; They're undefeable.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot back them off from your
[2:09:25] word.

[2:09:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[2:10:29] What a mighty
[2:10:31] God
[2:10:33] Jesus is.
[2:10:36] Can we just close our eyes just before
[2:10:37] we go? Oh,

[2:10:44] God
[2:10:46] my Jesus

[2:11:30] glorious God. We worship you, Lord God.
[2:11:34] Hallelujah.
[2:11:36] What a mighty
[2:11:38] God. What a mighty Jesus
[2:11:42] is. I wish somebody would help me praise
[2:11:44] him. Oh, hallelujah. Why don't you
[2:11:48] praise yourself out of that valley? Why
[2:11:51] don't you praise yourself out of that
[2:11:53] old place you find yourself in? Give
[2:11:56] Jesus a sacrifice of praise. Worship
[2:12:00] him. Adore him. Bless his name.
[2:12:05] Oh my God. My God. We worship him. His
[2:12:09] miracle.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; God. God, we worship you, Lord. What a
[2:12:21] mighty God.
[2:12:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing it. Let us
[2:12:27] worship and sing with all of our hearts.
[2:12:30] What a mighty God mighty God. I know
[2:12:35] my
[2:12:38] Jesus. Sickness has to bow. Oppression
[2:12:41] has to bow. Heartache has to bow.
[2:12:44] Sadness has to bow. At the name of
[2:12:47] Jesus, every knee shall bow, every
[2:12:50] tongue shall confess to the glory of God
[2:12:53] the Father. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; My God. We worship you, Lord Jesus. We

[2:13:19] And he'd like to sing it back to you
[2:13:21] this way. Oh, what a lovely bride.
[2:13:27] My bride
[2:13:29] is.
[2:13:35] Oh, little bride, he says. What a lovely
[2:13:39] bride.
[2:13:41] He knows
[2:13:43] you are.
[2:13:48] Glory to God.
[2:13:50] He ordained and called and loved you
[2:13:56] before your mama or your daddy or anyone
[2:14:00] else ever knew you.
[2:14:04] What a lovely bride
[2:14:08] you are.
[2:14:12] Hallelujah.

[2:14:28] people in the name of Jesus. They shake
[2:14:31] this away from them. They are crashing.

[2:15:31] time?
[2:15:33] He may show up 4 days late according to
[2:15:35] your calendar, but you can take
[2:15:36] Lazarus's word for it. When he's 4 days
[2:15:38] late, he's still on time. He may not
[2:15:41] come as soon as you want him to, but
[2:15:43] he's still on time. He may not come when
[2:15:45] the doctor said if something don't
[2:15:46] happen then such and such a time, but
[2:15:48] he's still on time. We're wondering,
[2:15:50] well, how come we're still here after
[2:15:52] 63, but he's still on time? How come
[2:15:55] we're still here after 77 and he's still
[2:15:57] on time? After 1997, and he's still on
[2:16:01] time. And the devil said, "You're going
[2:16:03] to keep on trusting." Yes, we're going
[2:16:04] to keep on trusting because he's an on
[2:16:07] time God.
[2:16:10] Yes, he is. Come on, let's sing it
[2:16:12] together. Oh, he's an on time God.
[2:16:19] Yes, he is. Yes, he is. Well, he may not
[2:16:24] come when you want him to, but he'll be
[2:16:27] there right on time. Oh, he's an on time
[2:16:33] God.
[2:16:34] Yes, he is. Sing it again with all your
[2:16:37] heart. Sing it now. He's an on time God.
[2:16:42] Oh, yes, he is. Yes. About my father
[2:16:46] now. He's an on time God.
[2:16:51] Yes, he is.
[2:16:55] Well, he may not come when you want him
[2:16:58] to, but he'll be there right on time.
[2:17:03] He's an on time God.
[2:17:07] Yes, he is. Oh, listen to these words
[2:17:10] now. Well, you can ask the children of
[2:17:13] Israel
[2:17:15] trapped at the Red Sea
[2:17:20] by that mean old Pharaoh
[2:17:24] and an army.
[2:17:27] They had a water all around them.
[2:17:32] Pharaoh on their tracks. All
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; from Alabama where my God stand
[2:17:40] high just like that. Oh, he's an all
[2:17:45] time God. Oh yes, he
[2:17:50] is. Oh, he's anime
[2:17:54] God.
[2:17:56] Yes, he
[2:17:58] is. Oh, we may not come when you want
[2:18:03] him to, but be there right on time.
[2:18:08] God bless you, saints. The fear of God.
[2:18:11] Amen. Yes.
[2:18:15] Oh, hallelujah. You can ask the
[2:18:18] 5,000,000
[2:18:21] hungry souls. He fed
[2:18:25] on the banks of that river with two fish
[2:18:30] and five loaves of bread.
[2:18:34] What a miracle
[2:18:37] he performed for the multitude.
[2:18:41] But what he did way back then, he knew
[2:18:46] the day for me and you. Oh, he's an all
[2:18:51] time God.
[2:18:54] Yes, he is.
[2:18:56] Oh,
[2:18:58] an all time God.
[2:19:02] Yes, he is.
[2:19:06] Well, he may not come when you want him
[2:19:09] to, but he'll be there right on time.
[2:19:14] He's an on time God.
[2:19:18] Yes, he is.
[2:19:22] He's an on time God.
[2:19:27] Yes, he is.
[2:19:30] Oh, on time God.
[2:19:35] Yes, he is.
[2:19:39] No, he may not come when you want him
[2:19:43] to, but he'll be there right on time.
[2:19:47] He's an on time god.
[2:19:51] Yes, he is.
[2:19:56] He's an on time god.
[2:20:00] Yes, he is.
[2:20:03] Do you know he's an on time god?
[2:20:08] Yes, he is.
[2:20:13] may not come when you want him to, but
[2:20:17] he'll be there right on time.
[2:20:20] He's an on time god.
[2:20:24] Yes, he is.
