twelve yokes of oxen before him and he with the twelve and elisha passed by him and cast his mount o upon him and he left his ox and ran after elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have I done to thee and he turned back from him and took his jokes of officers and slew them and bought their flesh with the instrument of the altars and gave unto the people and they did he that he arose and went out there Elijah and ministered unto Him now let's turn right quickly to the book of Genesis Genesis the 19th chapter and one particular verse verse 26 and it reads but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt now let's get the last verse and we let you be seated look at the nice chapter and verse 62 and jesus said unto him no man has put in his hand to a plough and look back it's fit for the kingdom of God a man lives by his again Lord we thank you for the reading of your word and I bless it to our hearts in Jesus name Amen you may be seated bless the Lord I'm just gonna sit this on the side hey man I got a very very simple thought tonight a man it's very simple it's following Jesus amen and I could that would be my takes if I could a subtext will be a man distraction amen and when you following something is coming out there or as a result of and distraction is a thing that prevent something from giving full attention to something else it that's right and we realize that we are living in a time a man there is a lot of distraction amen but one thing I can truly say that the true Church of the Lord Jesus Christ that has their eyes on one thing and they have their eyes on Jesus and I want to deal tonight my a man I want to deal with Elijah and Elijah and I want to deal with the type of Elijah is a type of Christ and Elijah is a type of the church that's right now we realized that the prophet of God said Amen church amen the word Church me the call-out one is that's right it meant so Redemption has to part those are coming out and those are going into and I realize around this message of the hour there has been many that has come out but there hasn't gone into that's why so many are getting so distracted that's why so many are cool enough that's why so many are losing their zeal amen because of distraction but I'm so happy tonight to know that I have my eyes on one thing is the Lord Jesus Christ he's my joy tonight he's my peace tonight he's my great fountain tonight and whatever he go I will follow him and I'm happy to know that he not realize that my brother and sister tonight you know a lot of time we said I love the Lord Jesus and you know when I become a Christian amen the word Chris I mean christ-like and have a desire to follow the Lord my desire is to to lay down in following Jesus that's come a price that's come a price a lot of times you have to give up your friends sometimes you have to give up your best buddy and believe me tell you tonight no matter what it take whatever it say I'm following Jesus amen I'm falling him all the way no matter who turned and who go back I got one thing on my mind I'm going all the way I'm gonna see my Lord in peace a man and I believe brother Jack with all my heart we are getting so close to the going up the church a man because you can see things are cooling off but God got a bride in this hour they following the Lord Jesus Christ they father II the revealed word of the hour somebody say man tonight a man they got their eyes on one thing because the joy of the Lord is a sin I don't know about you tonight but I'm happy to be in church tonight I'm happy I could go chill of placing a folk on a wall well I could worship aren't you and a living God I'm happy to know that I can feel the presence of the Lord I'm so happy to know that I got true thing man and I got the spirit amen and I thank God that something is leading me in the right direction I don't know about you but this man called Jesus he takes me through a lot but what if he takes me I will follow him he may takes me through a month he may take me through tomorrow but it's all right I'm gonna follow him no matter where I go I got my eyes on the Lord all I'm alright I've lot of walk on the cloud somebody say man follow Jesus Christians around the world won't to see a great revival a great move of God the supernatural being done God won't - and we'll do this thing but he has to find Christmas in shape to be able to take whatsoever he doeth are you hear me God have to train us are you hearing me God had to take us through trials and and a lot of letdowns a man and you see what you do love him let me take my brother and sister come and go I'm gonna follow him I'm happy I I tell the church everywhere I go I'm happy this is so brother right here I'm not cooling off for nothing let me tell you know Bishop got me on fire no preacher put me on fire my mama didn't set me on fire my father didn't set me on fire but this word and I'm talking about the word for my day has me on fire and I can't stop it man I'm burning and try get a body change because the joy of the Lord is here the joy of the Lord is in this house and I believe tonight whatever I desire no he's on father him songwriters say I have this I decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back though the world may turn their back but I got my eyes on one thing and I believe we're living in our because so many churches are listen at me now let me make myself clear so many churches I didn't count any particular church but I have to be careful the way our worst thing because somebody go and tell I say that church I say I didn't say Happy Valley is cooling off I said churches as an individual are you hearing me photo have the joy of the Lord like that you sitting man but let me say you were God set me on fire and I'm running for my life I got my eyes on one thing know the bible begin to tell us how that Jesus if I could just slow down just a moment a man and the body was said in the Book of Luke the ninth chapter and if it's a seven verse and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord I would follow thee what's the Elva died out goeth and jesus said unto him fluxes have hosed the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head and he said unto another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first you go and burn my my father's buried my father pardon me and Jesus said unto him let the dead bury the dead but go and preach the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go in and and bid them for well which are at home at my house and jesus said unto Him no man has put in his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God I think God for calling tonight I think God I heard my God called me and when he called me out of the system I have no desire to look back when he called me for my love Babylon I have no desire to loop back to Babylon are you hearing me I have no desire to loop back to the things of the world I got my mind on one thing amen is getting a body change and I know in order to get a body change that I must eat this word are you hear me I must stay put in a presence of the Sun amen in order to get about a change I thank God for the call tonight do you realize that there are many flows that I call the Bible say Paul said not many wise not many nobles not many a mighty means are calm but you know God takes the god take the the most simplest thing and confound the wise man God take people like Peter or Egret man and shake the whole world God take a man like David a man after God's own heart a sheep herd a man not nobody so smart a man but somebody that's willing to lay down whatever it takes Lord our ladies down if this causing my hindrance if this causing my distraction if my husband is my wife calls my distraction Lord forgive me because I want to follow you the way I realize that summer called summer sent and some just get up and wind which one of you you're one of them either you've been called by God or you've been sent by mama some preacher are you i a man somebody say man but if God called you whatever it takes Lord I'm willing to go all the way you know the word Church me at woman's in the Bible woman's type of the church the natural types the spirit and I thought about in the book of Genesis how that the Prophet Abraham sent a warning a man down to a lot and his wife and his family telling him to come out as solemn a man because God was getting ready to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah that's right but she took it real slight no no let me back up and she got very I'm sure she might have got desperate she mana she Milan was getting ready to run out of the house and she thought about she she left with nice fancy shoe then when I got the six-inch heel you know because she just want to go back and get those shoes are you hearing me said that don't sound like somebody that - right maybe maybe maybe she was running out and she thought about maybe this she need to bring her television I got with me maybe she thinks she need to take her television but will you meet God tells you to go out you need to come out and don't look back for nothing no I love it so well that because like why she she did come out she did justify she came out she might have cleaned up she might have stopped cutting the loose ends you hear what I'm saying she she might have stopped doing those stay she might have stopped wearing pants a man putting on man she might have died and she might have clean up and look just like a Christian look just like a Christian faith for coming to church paying the tithe the dues and adult and all day but let me tell you when she came out she came out to probably God say she just had to take that one long look bang are you hearing me and we she look back my Bible said that she turned to a pillar of salt oh my god I wouldn't eat here tonight you could be sitting in here and look at yourself you might be turning to a salt you said what you mean if you start losing that desire something that's happening you don't have that zeal like you you sir then you might be turning to yourself you might come out a move your feet like you're you sir how you use a patch of feet and praise the Lord it might be starting from your feet coming up you might be turning to the song I don't know but when Jesus say come you need to go and don't be distracted I don't care what sailor who say keep your eyes someone said brother children where you go I said I'm going to wish it at all someone saw you going down your brother done you got to be careful I'm not hearing what nobody got to say I got my mind's on one thing I'm coming to preach what does said the Lord I'm not trying to be a big shot I'm not trying to be a big preacher I do want to preach to you what does say the Lord and so many and the sad thing about it sitting in church you know and I'm going to get your king in a minute here and I love this stretch of what Apostle Paul says in Corinthians think the thirteenth chapter maybe the feel first that I'm a man if I'm karate if I write all that the Apostle Paul says examine yourself that's what he's saying examine yourself and see whether you are in the faith I hear me see rather yo I in Christ see what Paul trying to say he say examine yourself and see rather you interface are you our a reprobate oh my god Lord don't let me be a reprobate oh god please Lord whatever Lord don't let me be a reprobate Lord let me examine myself you know it's so easy to come to church and look at everybody else and that's what the devil will to do you don't want you to see your own cell somebody say my amen but the hair I don't have time to watch you I got to watch me behind closed doors somebody say my my biggest hindrance me if I could get this oh boy - humming himself down and keep his eye on the Lord Jesus Christ Lord don't let me turn to a pillar of salt but let me keep my eye don't you Lord don't let my phicorp but let me stay on fire let my Firebird oh God feel my saucer tonight and let it overflow God keep that joy in my heart keep that joy in my heart I don't care what the world say I don't care how much the world say it may all this is wrong I don't have my oh one thing I'm keeping my eyes on the Lord because the Bible saying in the last day my bride a man he'll be a a quick short work there be a man we live in at a time when great falling away fall away from what does shoes my will your joy when your joy is leaving you when you come to church and really you don't want to really be here I'm just here because the Deacon may tell brother Donnie then I'm out of church

you're gonna be proven a man to walk this road everybody can't follow Jesus are you hearing me everybody can't follow him he'll take you down some rough road here take it through the pipe sometime brother I remember one day I was following him a man he walked by this plane and he looked at me and said going to pie I said me he said going to fire somebody say man property God say gotta take a

I'm happy to know that he is my light tonight he is my salvation tonight he is my joy tonight I'm gonna tell you tonight if you start losing your joy you need to come to the altar and you start losing

be inside of you hallelujah glory to God I think about old prophet Elijah I know Elijah was getting old the Bible let us know that Elijah was coming to the end of his journey a man he knew his time was getting short I don't know if he saw his his dear friend Amen at 56 or what but he know he was getting close to the end are you hearing me amen and he knew that email at that particular time Elijah a man amen amen had fallen I think so many other prophets kill a man up under the unknowing somebody say man but you know sometimes you could be insured you could be praising God just Oh God brother choosing preaching the faith message I got faith I claimed in my healing I claiming my deliverer I don't have that signal as soon as you get for under that on auntie you back on the same level somebody say man the same faith Amen you could lose that faith and allow Dahl to come back but let me tell you what Church of the Living God I got my wife mind on one thing I got my mind on the Lord tonight amen but Elijah knew that his time was drawing nigh and God began to talk to Elijah when he came out of the cave the God began to speak to him amen God wasn't in the lighting God wasn't in the Thunder hey man God wasn't in the fire but God wasn't that still small voice how many you ever heard that still small voice I told you you a child of God that voice I tell you you can't be lost that voice I tell you you come from eternity and you go on back with God that voice I tell you the devil can't stop you a man no matter what come ago that devil can't stop you why because you hear that steel smaller jaw somebody say man that still small voice Elijah knew that it's time he was getting old I could see him my brother I could see all Elijah God began to tell him how to not amen one to be king over Syria one to be king over Israel and Elijah I want you to be the prophet of God amen he told Elijah but I want you to go down and I'm Angie Liza a man a man knew his time was up and you know what I believe Elijah a man that was doing amen I believe God knew had that prophet storing up food because he knew his time was soon to come to him but one things I love someone how that God was training Elijah God was training the church somebody say my God was training to church so you have Malaysia are you hearing me and I can imagine old ball head Elisha all wrinkled man came up on the top of that hill and I could see the Sun glistening his eye as he began to look over the hill he look down in the field he could see that prophet down there flying in the field I could see had no idea it was that little point in time let me tell you church and living God some time in your lives you try to do things that - don't worry but when that time come when there's a season and there's a time in your life when you know it's the season you need to step into it and claim your delivers you need to claim your healing you need to claim you are overcome I and Elisha well down there applying but God was down there training him training this man with twelve oxen and I can imagine the monsters must have got out of line but God trained that man to hire to help patient the us getting out of line I think about a pastor he he must have gotta he must got he had must have to be strong it meant to lead God's people a man now they get out of line and a man he keep plying that word he keep whipping the word and sometime they get back out a lot but I can imagine Elisha was flying in the field and I don't prophet a God began to look down as he began to feel there are nineteen of God on his life and that prophet of God began to come down to heal to the lights of that church glory to God somebody say man where was you and this came to you somebody say man was you a man when elijah came down to you I will tell you where I was at I was in the Pentecost and man we were shouting a man we were speaking in tongues we were beating the tambourine we were singing on the choir hey man somebody say man we had Dicker's had two and three wide somebody say man hey man we had shackles on the choir but one day Elijah came down somebody say man that ball head prophet came down somebody and I thank God for it tonight I don't know about you but I was going astray man also thank God I thank God tonight that he reached down his hand for a poor rich Center like I have I thought I was in the truth I thought I was going in the right direction but I heard a prophet as he was coming down the hill I suggest just play but God was training him but you know what I love so that mantle that Elijah had off fit Eliezer perfect are you hearing me garden had garden had that garment Amen cut down to a side to defeat Elijah Lysa grown up defeat the garment somebody say my god got a road for you but he got to prove you he got to cut you down somebody say man maybe you got a little bit of Madison stealing there maybe this not that much time you you bear you can't hardly see just look just a little tiny in me justjust a little Madison your heart I mean it ain't that bad but I I ain't my brother do me bad I I just I I just can't forgive him I mean ain't that bad but you know I I love him how you know I love everybody but uh right now just can't let it go but that's why I came with that garment hey man and like she was planning to field working in my working on his jaw that was his occupation that was his way of brainy amen earrings into the home take care his family but he was coming why all of a sudden that old bow hair prophet come down and he took that man sir and he told it on that prophet and I can imagine when he must have dropped on that prophet he felt nothing when it hit him somebody say man and Elisha can't walk he kept walking him man he wasn't worried about a thing because God knows if he sent his word in this hour hey man it'll drop on the right seat God don't have to look back at you somebody say man god no if he cities were his words gonna call you somebody say man how many minimum any of time Elijah would go to a lot of church he said not go back to your own churches he said he'll go back to y'all home church but he know he knew if he put that word out there somebody say man he knew somebody gonna Satan wait a minute this copy is different somebody save me but when Elijah was flying when he got that army that garment owe him something felt different oh my god he felt power there was an auntie that was in that gun oh my he muscled look around a man he look around and the Bible said listen to me God and the Bible say he went walking after Elijah if that's what he said huh he didn't say that the Bible said he went right that's what you got to do in this out when it's time to go to church are you hearing me when it's time to praise the Lord you
