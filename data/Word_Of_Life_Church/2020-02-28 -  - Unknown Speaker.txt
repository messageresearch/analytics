the storm passes man god bless you tonight happy to see [Applause] we miss y'all when we're gone amen I'm glad God let us walk this journey together let's turn to Isaiah 53 if you would tonight we want to look at a continuation of the humility and the glory of canosa's and before we read the scripture I'd like to emphasize to you that this is part of God that Satan does not understand we accredit him with so much more really than what he does understand and this is part of God's being that is more than a being like himself can understand so then we look at it in a broader perspective that if Satan can't understand it then neither can his children understand when the children of God try to be like this and the attributes of their father it will make no sense somehow God hid it from Satan exactly when he come to the earth that he never was pretty convinced that it was him and he wasn't convinced it what damn he just kind of you know he just wasn't really sure he has a way of doing that don't now think how blessed you are God's open your understanding to help you to understand more and more about it and I thank God for myself the Sun look at this chapter 53 of Isaiah verse 1 who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed well he should grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him now remember God created this body of Jesus so it wasn't that he had a Jewish nose and Gentile eyes and Syrian ears and you know Mesopotamian fingers there was nothing from any human being at all so God could have created him to be the most handsome of men that ever lived on the earth but instead he chose him to be a very plain simple looking sort of person no beauty about him that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him in other words we wouldn't even look at him to even give him the credit that we would look his direction he was despised and we esteemed him not but now listen how that this parallels with the divine and the human surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows now Isaiah and this prophecy he takes a great mixture of adjectives nouns but the uses so many verbs which are words of action we're living in a now and Christian age and an adjective age when Christians want to be told out great they are they want to be preached they want the preachers to applaud them and just use adjectives after adjective after adjectives in the good way of course but when you go to preaching verb words a lot of folks go to having problems because they really don't want to do anything when it comes to the Lord on me but notice how that Isaiah whenever he mentions this now in verse 3 he's describing him by agita cease despise which is an adjective of course and it was rejected a man of sorrows an adjective acquainted with grief which is a cross over of an action part we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised again an attitude of describing him and we esteemed him not but now we come to the action part surely he has borne borne our griefs and not a nail not an adjective a word of action yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted many have you have a need to not request before the Lord all of us I'm sure Lord Jesus we bow our heads and we come to you as humbly as we know how first of all we want to say thank you thank you for your kindness to us thank you for your mercy thank you for your grace but thank you Lord for becoming one of us it was God above his people then it was God in his people and God become his people we thank you Lord that she would come to this earth Condon send to such a place that to this day still in the realm of the supernatural it must be overwhelming to both divine angels and those who follow to us it is still so profound as Paul said great is the mystery of godliness Lord I'm sure that we don't see it the way maybe others do I'm sure that if we look back in time and maybe a year or two from now or three what a memorial was think oh my how much more we seen but I do know this I'm grateful for what I see tonight and I want to see more tomorrow and the next day and so on and so on lord I pray that should help us tonight may the greatness of our God be so expressed before us tonight that we can see the contrast of your prayer thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and contrasts that father to the cosmos because we know there's two great kings that are at war two kingdoms and only two that are against each other every person in this building tonight every person that will hear this service where every one of us are identified in one or the other of those kingdoms may it be the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ for we ask it in your precious name and the Saint said God bless you may be seated I just think in my heart from his birth until 11 or so his life was certainly curious and different things about him that was different than other boys yet very similar no doubt his mother and Joseph being there with him and they would hear him say things see induce things not that there was miracles walking on water nothing like that yet and then when they lost him and they went to the temple and found him there as he was speaking words that a normal 12 year old boy should not know now the Bar Mitzvah for those of you that understand what that is it's whenever a young man actually becomes a son of the Torah and that is that he for his first time in life he's able to stand up and take the law and the priest tends in the law and they unroll it and he's able to stand up and take the law and read it and then to actually comment on the scriptures that he is read according to their tradition and their custom he is now a man which is about 12 to 13 years old called their Bar Mitzvah so actually someone we were there in Israel so they take him around and now of course they would take him to the Western Wall and they will take him up on their shoulders and they dance and have great time of Jubilee but the way that look at it this is when the young man actually enters into a time that he is what they call a son of the Torah no doubt the Lord Jesus had studied it no doubt he had read it but where would he have got such wisdom to where the doctors of the law would have set their and heard him and they were just marveling at the words that were being said and then when she and Joseph Kahn said son your father and I have been concerned about you we've been looking for you it said wish you're not I must be about my father's business as a matter of fact Joseph ain't no father now there must have been things that was different and you can imagine that Satan has always kept his eye on the fourth dimension he's always wanted to see how that God would use those prophets and they would break into that realm and see future things that he himself would marvel at in summits that they would call men's names hundreds of years before they were ever born they would tell about events and describe them in such a way that to this very day it is phenomenal how they could describe how a city would be taken over how many days they'd lay siege how many would die so on and so on and Satan must have marveled at the insight that these natural men somehow praying and being alone with God and he would watch them and all of the sudden they become very strange in this atmosphere and maybe they might jerk a little or quiver or their eyes become star gazed and they would just look there and become mesmerized as if they were paralyzed by the presence of God and all of a sudden things would start coming out of their mouths and as you know many of these prophets would have a ascribe with it because when they were in these visions they could not write them so some of the prophets had scribes and as they were in the vision the scribe was sitting there as a Penman so he would write down what the prophet would say the profit you know wouldn't have any recollection many of them once they come out of the vision and Satan must have Marvel as he heard these things and God let the parallel of the prophecies of the coming Redeemer be so mixed on the divine glory side with the human humble lowly side that without a real genuine understanding you'd see why it would be so easy to misunderstand it so you take the prophecy the first one that God Himself gave in genesis 3:15 when God said that he would raise up a seed and it would bruise the serpent well if you would take those of the serpent bruzer and you would take those of being the son of David and you would take certain ones of zechariah 6 12 or jeremiah 35 or you know it's zechariah 12 and you take some of these others and you would put them together you can see why that you would be looking for a mighty general to come not a baby so then you're trying to look and reconcile Isaiah 7:14 with a serpent brucer or Isaiah 9:6 was the son of David a great mighty king and you can see why that describes the Pharisees the doctors of the law they were looking for a mighty general to come down on top of the temple and announce his coming to care for and he would tell that all the people know the son of David has arrived so you know what they done they took quotes from the prophet and put together the coming of the Messiah and totally missed it because they hand-picked the quotes of the prophets and they put the advent of the coming of the Lord mixed in with her own generality of reasoning and totally missed it because they were not spiritual but yet yeah the woman - well yeah ignorant fisherman and so on and they did not depend just upon their fare sake for training and teaching but they would say words like thou art the Son of God the king of Israel we know Messias cometh him when he comes he will do these things either speak to thee em he and she dropped her water pot and went run into the city and say is not this the very Messiah now why was it that those prophetic prophecies did not confuse the elect as they did the learning because the learning was endowed with the satanic nature of religiosity which come with the element of human pride well I said a mouthful right then I'm telling you friends that Satan wanted to get his way in order to interject this greatest of all sings for sin inside of the human race that every individual that would be born add to the mixing of the seedlings every one of them would be tainted was an element of satanic arrogance and pride then they would tend to rely upon their own abilities or their own width or their abilities to be able to mechanize because man is good at operating and in feeding we can see that in the book of Genesis and Madison that being able to come up with ways to make himself a way back to God Adam showed us that in the Garden of Eden by the fig leaves so Satan knew with the fall of man the holy image of God left the men so leave the man alone with his intellect and with the word and the man will do his best to figure out a way back to God without the shedding of the blood and by using all adjectives and minimizing verbs right so we can say well I'm their son I'm mad and I'm mad and I'm mad I'm not mad and I'm that and it's all profession of course but he doesn't really have to do anything in exchange well praise God y'all required on me but notice then when God came himself now remember this one that we called Jesus he was actually the father before he was the sir [Applause] now I become Jesus was that which was created by the father and the father embodies in the son which is the human element but in order to bring us of course back to reconcile us notice in isaiah 53:10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul now notice it is a mixture of the divine and the human part of this the Spirit is doing but it must be in total correlation what's the submissive will of the Lamb it is the merging of the dove and the Lamb there are certain parts only the Dove can do only the Dove could bruise the Lamb you see the Lamb did not bruise himself but land did not lay upon himself the iniquity of us all but it was the Dove that laid upon the Lamb the iniquity of the soul it pleased him the dev to bruise the lamb hallelujah notice in verse 11 he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied he the dove shall see how the travail of the soul of the Lamb and he the Dove shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant by his knowledge shall my the Dove righteous servant the lamb justify many for he the lamb shall bear their iniquities therefore well ah the death divided him the lamb a portion with the Great and he the lamb shall divide the spoil with the strong the redeemed by the lamb well glory to God because he the lamb poured out his lambs soul unto death and he the lamb was numbered with the transgressors and he the lamb bear the sin of not everybody but many I'm glad I'm one of them and made intercession for the transgressors now in order for God to be able to reflect the epitome of his own heart toward reconciliation of the lost it must be the merging together of the divine and the human the divine cannot suffer death of course we know that and the human cannot be able to put sin upon itself if the human protects off sin to take off sin then it defiles the sacrifice so it must be that the holy will take the sins of the unrighteous and lay it over that part of himself which can bear sin and the Dove cannot bear sin only the lamb can do that and it must be a total complete submission of the Lambs soul the Lambs nature the Lambs desire in order to make it work exactly with the justice of God God cannot listen our God cannot make the lamb do something that is contrary to his own will he cannot make the lamb go he cannot make the lamb suffer he cannot make the lamb go through all of this extreme punishment that he's going to go through the lamb must be absolutely 100% willing there must not even be a point zero zero zero zero zero zero one left in his will that is not completely submissive to the nature of the duh that's exactly where God wants us now I'm talking about that converted part of you this right here will always kick against the will of God there's parts about this whole body a virus that can obey the word and there's parts about it he just don't like it just be honest well that's right because the body is not yet retained but we're leaving it that way but the lamb must absolutely totally be completely surrendered to the will of God now this is one reason why of course it he lived this separate holy life and he chose and come to live thirty years on the earth without the fullness of the Godhead in him he must also experience that life of a person we reach through this way that would be justified and sanctified he must be able to relate not only to Holy Ghost feel true word born believers but his high priest he must be able to relate to the people who were just keeping the law as he wants the Torah he must be able to relate to those that love God with all of their hearts he must be also high priest to those that are just sanctified aren't you glad aren't you glad he didn't just become high priests to those that had the Holy Ghost then that made the majority of our Christian life many of us wouldn't even have been had a high priest he said well I'm only high priests to those that are got the Holy Ghost all the rest if he just did whatever you got to do to get that but he said no I'm gonna come to the else and I'm gonna live as a man without the Holy Ghost I'm gonna live as a man that believes and obeys the word and that does every single act Lee right all praise God but then when he receives the fullness that day but he never takes that fullness in order to overcome Satan because then it would be unfair for us don't Eve must ear into this pack to where the Ludd the Lamb and the dove will merge together in one union and the lamb will totally be submissive by his own choice notices now Philippians chapter 2 verse 8 I'm being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself now notice God the spirit the Dove can lay on him the sins of the world he can allow him to be chastised our transgressions and so on but he cannot make him be humble Oh hallelujah he cannot do that the lamb must do it him sell the land must you don't you see why he went this way it was to make a way for us now the Spirit of God friend it's not gonna make us serve him God's not gonna grab people up with an apple and then just smack the fire item just kick them and beat them and stomp on grab you by the hair the head I'm pulling you through the gates I don't care if you want to go to heaven wrong I'll tell her to god I'm pulling you there well if he does you that will have to everybody else out here the same way but God wants of people that are willing to follow in the very path of the Lamb of God which was of self humiliation now we all know what it's like to be humbled and we know what it's like to be able to sharing that but yet here is a divine side of being rewarded and of course the kenosis of the lamb was in order to come to the glory of God and with the glory of his bride since the wife is the glory of the man then it must be that the lamb must humble himself now supernaturally the father cannot do that because if he does he like to do it for every other son and daughter of God this is why the Bible tells us we must humble ourselves right now the pastor he can't do it for you I've came to it for you notice been found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now we looked at this word the last time I dealt with it but it's look at it again bring low - lowered depress one soul bring down once pride to have a modest opinion of one cell now to be honest with you I've met folks and you have to that if they didn't have their self to talk about I'm not sure what they would talk about because the more you're around them the more they talk about themselves and then they wonder what one brother Donnie didn't say much or now talk to him could it be you didn't give me no room and yours already talking about yourself enough I didn't really want to join in I get sick of people here and people talk about themselves look friend you might be a millionaire sitting here tonight all that means is you're a millionaire dirt bag and in value you're not worth any more than I am I've buried a lot of folks over about a hundred and some since I've been here I never mile I've seen no casket lined up at hundred dollar bills if I was when they put him in that time everybody come through they wouldn't have them I never seen nobody buried what's her car what's her horse what's her house what's her cattle with her sheep but their stops and their bonds come on have you know and you never will I don't figure so what it really comes right down to it the only thing that we take with us out of this world is our character and the reputation and our legacy it's what we leave behind right and that's where it's more than all the money of course in the world anyway but yet people have an idea that humility is something to wear people you know they did RESP or now look hey you know what I was raised poor I know exactly many of you been raised poor and you know exactly what it's like to be poor and to be raised poor but people think humility is being poor that's not always true some people that are poor they got so much pride if somebody offered to help them their pride but let anybody else open they can have more pride than a rich man can that's right a great man is a man who's actually greater than you but he can convince you you're greater than him it's not a person who's all the time going around telling about how great they are they can sing better than everybody else play the guitar ever better than else and they can preach more and they have more visions and more dreams and so on that is a bag of wind [Applause] well praise the Lord y'all didn't say men much but it's the truth in hell now notice them the Lord Jesus was not made to do this by the Deaf but the land chose this on his own I remember the lamb is the human part look at the meaning of this word here to behave in an unassuming manner devoid of all holiness or metaphorically it means to bring into a humble condition reduce to meet her circumstances to assign a lower rank coma or place to a base to be ranked below others who are honored or rewarded now the nature of this humiliation it was genuine it was not that the Lord Jesus acted like he was humble and he did not impersonate a humble man but he was a humble man now in this don't don't get in your mind that just because he did not have a house and he did not have horses and he did not have chariots because we know in that day there would have been many many people that did not have a place to live there were homeless saying like there are now but it was not so much just because a lack of property but it was more a mindset than it was of how much you own you see a person actually can have a lot of possessions in this world but if they have them and use them the right way they can be more humble than a person that says flat broke all the time because it's not just what you own it's your attitude toward what you own well praise the Lord he owned everything did he not he owned everything but yet when you look at it he was so humbled that he stepped aside and laid aside of course the crown the diadem the roads and all of that but he laid aside all knowing he laid aside omnipotence he laid aside all of that and assumed a lower rank as Paul said so he come down and it was totally voluntary now this is what the Lord wants us to become as far as us humbling ourselves the God does not have to do it you know on sometimes we hate it but sometimes were hard-headed and stubborn goddess just what the fired of us he just has to take a stick and just beats us and we just you know ideas and that Daddy because he wants just because we're so stubborn and worse a hard-headed now I'm gonna go ahead and say Amen for me and now this amens for all the rest because y'all just sent over that funny-looking smile on your face what's this in Matthew 18:3 and said verily I say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven friends one of the truest signs that you'll ever know that you're under the rebellion of Satan away from the leadership is of the Holy Ghost it's when you cannot receive correction from the Word of God when the Deacons try to correct you or the ministers try to correct you and you receive nothing from nobody just remember you're under a satanic evil spirit not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can be corrected if it lives in you it will lead you to correction well I say I'm what to preach and a man too now watch Jesus now I know this is not nice we don't like it we that's not deep and we message people don't not even sure these scriptures are needed by I'm kind of different than a lot of message folks Jesus said this I believe it's needed well the I'll say in the US said cheap to come be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall notice again not the Dove of humbling the Lamb but now the same that the same sequence of events is going to happen in the prophetic timeframe when the Holy Ghost is going to burst the church whenever the Dove will come and live inside more Lambs and he will equip them and give them the ability to humble themselves now Fred this is from the divine side we can't do this on her own whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child oh wow the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven now don't raise your hands but is that your idea of who the greatest is in the kingdom of heaven praise God sweet Jesus brother Homer where you at buddy I heard you had some good meetings rushed back up here notice the words that Jesus uses is the exact same word that Paul uses Tapani oh the same Greek word the exact same meaning so it means then that we will have the ability within us to humble ourselves again in Matthew 23:12 whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased he that shall humble himself shall be exalted James 4:6 but he giveth more grapes wherefore he says God resisteth the proud but give us grace unto the humble I don't know about you but I sure need grace you see this is why the pride the proud man does not depend upon grace why his goodness generates from his own being from his own works for whatever he is look friends there's folks that are absolutely eat up with pride and I've never really done much in life but their pride is not from what they own it's not actually from what they've accomplished it's from them self itself generated don't you see what that ties it ties to the universal sin that was committed in the universe before sim was ever brought to the earth in reality they have nothing to be proud of their failure in business or a failure in this and a failure in that and yet they are so proud and where does it come from within themselves oh praise God so this is what James said that God does to the proud God resists the proud which is oppose oneself to range and battle against so and we lift up our self and pride and arrogance and this that neither God declares a war against you and you know is gonna win that war it hang will be you oh man notice this so God resisteth the proud I know I reach a lot of meanings of this words but to me that make them so real when we read him in the language they were written him and the proud means this showing oneself above others some do that but what they drive some do it but what they dress but other people do it by their spiritual means I'm more spiritual than other people at Happy Valley I feel this and I feel that I feel that and I feel there well God's got bringing for so much stuff and I had to just be honestly that the poor old devil has said and he done a lot of it a lot of its people but want to be bye-bye'd I felt led I felt led to do this and anything that's leading you contoured this word is a devil it ain't a holiness so people that look at themselves and they have such spiritual pride they are so much deeper oh they're so much more spiritual they've gone so far in God and in their pride they look down as Satan did on the Angels I might need to give me one then my bulletproof vest if I keep on preaching this way now this is what the Bible says that God does to those type of people so for those of you that are more wealthy and you're able to buy your clothes from the mall and say you come into the church and you happen to see a sister sitting there and a dress from Ross and in your pride know where she got that you need to get that devil off of you [Applause] that is from the holy ghost praise gone I'll test some of the worst ones in the message that's got this and that's preachers eat up with it Thank You Jesus brothers we model to just cut right here on out not even let's just go out on the internet I'm gonna be kilt again look at the meaning of it prior proud showing oneself above others now it's not that they are but they show their self that they are over topping conspicuous above others preeminent was an overwhelming estimate of one's means or merits despising others or even treating them with contempt holy why would God be so against this because it comes from Satan even when the Lord Jesus rebuked the scribes Pharisees Sadducees he never done in the spirit of pride it was not proud it was not arrogance it was in the spirit of love and trying to correct their error right but you've been around people and you know as well as I do that all my when you get around them and they just kind of look at you and you know they're looking at you and they feel so sorry for you maybe not so much your clothes maybe your dress you know what kind of parent to them and you look alright you're sort of kind of decent and they'll talk to you a little bit about the word and they still throwing things out there to kind of see where you are and then they see you're not where they think you're my brother they are you sure don't know very much do you you sure don't know but generally when I get around somebody like that and they go that attitude gentlemen what I do I go even lower than what they think I am because they need to feel bigger than me they need to feel bigger than me so I'm gonna help them I'm gonna add more done than what they think I am oh that's right why I'm helping them fall now I don't even understand this but there comes times to when people will not correct be corrected by the word I've actually had to give them enough rope knowing in time how would watch them hang themself because they will not match up to God's Word so a Holy Spirit goes before what a fool Lord keep me from such well hallelujah church but notice James says he give us more grace wherefore said God resisteth the proud but he give us grace unto the humble mama notice again James 4:10 humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up now this word is a different Greek word as far as lift and it is to exalt to lift up on high metaphorically to raise to the very summit of opulence Wow now this is what's amazing this is what the natural man wants but he wants to do it by his own merits or works or whatever more but God said no if you want divine opulence the only way you can do it is not step on everybody else but you to humble yourself and let me do it but if you try to do it yourself I'm telling you I'll declare a war against you so the Lord Jesus must come in this same human format and feel he must have felt by the Terry afford you know the port of pride he must have felt the pull of arrogance and so on no doubt he could have answered every question that everybody ever asked him he could have answered them and totally overwhelmed and proved how great he was which is what most of us would have done cause a lot of times we speak not only what we know but a whole lot more than what we know just in case they need that too and let's just be honest we make fools out of ourselves Abraham Lincoln said it's better to be silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and solve all doubts wisemen OMA but really for the Father Jesus the Lord Jesus to relate to those of us left with this tempered nature that Satan was able to inject in us this element of pride and arrogance and whatever more he must have felt this and overcome this with the spirit in him love imagination conscious memory and all the feelings the gates to the flesh the gates to the eye and all this is why brother Ram said that he would always have people to bow their heads when he was casting out Devils because he said that our is the gate to the soul so he said if people were looking and they were looking around whenever he is casting out Devils that them Devils look for a place to go and somehow them setting there with our eyes open don't ask me how don't understand it but it would gain an entrance so what was it that dollar heads shut their eyes which was a sign of humility look how many people raised their heads and raised their eyes and demons went in a why sign of rebellion sign of stubbornness all praise God you mean something that simple that's right something just that simple is that all praise the Lord notice first fella Peter chapter 5 verse 5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves under the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be closed o be closed with humility look at this word I've just not how to spell the other day I found this I'm not a knot or a band by which two things are fastened together closed this is what the word closed me so humility is something that our spirit our being is actually tied together it was the humility of God that tied the doves and the land together merging it in a slave's garment thank you Jesus to fasten or guard one's self this was the white scarf or apron of slaves so you knew a slave because he had no shoes on him right what no ring but they might have an earring or they might have something in their nose but would say was a sign that there was a slave but they were required to wear this type of garment you mean they had to dress a certain way well if they told the lessor I don't want to wear that white garment I have to wear a rainbow garment purple I like green I love this it shut your mouth and get this white slave garment all because you belong to me well praise the Lord this was the white scarf or apron of slaves which was fastened to the belt of the vest and distinguished slaves from free men so don't you see what being clothed in humility does it helps us to shut our mouths it helps us to keep our opinion to ourself many times and sing it going on Facebook family laundry our message laundry be quick to hear slow to speak slow to wrath so a real slave is not a troublemaker a real slave is never a person who tries to call us a split in the church a real slave is not one that tries to assert the authority of the pastor all the authority of the Deacons are those people that you have voted in to be able to represent you come on sings this was the white scarf or apron of slaves which was fastened to the belt of the vest well and distinguished slaves from Freeman also this refers to the overalls which slaves wore to keep clean while working and exceedingly humble god I don't mind telling your friends we can start out being clean in the work of the Lord but if we don't keep the slave guard on on by the gym we can become dirty while we're doing the work of the Lord now I don't mean we become dirty sexually we might not become dirty as for cigarettes or any of those things but I attitude becomes rotten well hallelujah we're living in a very trying age and the unredeemed bodies of God's children can be just as trying as in the other mortal you ever dealt with as a matter of fact she can be some of the most impatient people you'll ever deal with she can be unforgiving praise rather darling and if we're not careful about the DAO dealing with the people of God we will get dirty this is why we need a slave garment on to keep us unspotted from the world because we're dealing with people with attitudes we're dealing with people with unforgiving spirits we're dealing with people of pride and arrogance and worldliness and so on and so on and we deal with them all the time and if we don't keep the slave calling out on us if we're not careful we'll look around and find we've got the same attitude they've got and we're doing the same thing that they done and five years ago you condemned that now you're just like them why you took your slave garment off and you so I don't need it no more we need that now more than ever we need to be clothed in humility we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost old friends I don't want just a little doubt so the Holy Ghost a little teaspoon I want to be so full I'm running over with it [Applause] first Peter chapter 5 verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you into time now let's look a little bit of the degrees of our Lord's emptying of himself the kenosis and the degrees the depths of the degrees of humility are contrasted by the heights of the degrees of glory he went to the extreme to learn no other mortal could ever go and he's been raised to a higher sphere the NIA of the world will ever be attentive he not only humbled himself to be a man but he humbled himself to be a mortal depriving himself as we've done gone through knowledge and so on and so on but he also now listen this is Jesus he humbled himself not only to become a man but to become a dead corpse now I'm glad that there are Undertaker's I'm glad there's people that can work in that field but I'd rather be a painter and I hate painting I'd rather be a plumber or not hate plumbing I'd I can think of all kinds of things I'd rather be than to be a mortician I'm glad by the rockin and brotherly and these other folks is able to do this we need them I'm glad that there's people who can do it but I person just don't like hanging around dead bodies whether they're nodding or laying in a box either way I just don't so he ain't not only humbled himself to become a mortal man but a corpse friend Dan is our lowest degree as far as the human body now think of movie stars kings potentates magistrate's no matter who we are how great we are in this life when it comes to that we're all on the same plane lost are saved because the save part of us in the corpse is now gone so the corpse lying there will start to generated the nose of folium it is our worst crowning in our mortality as a mortal is to become a corpse praise the Lord oh no they can hold woman's body all they want to and think one day that science will be able to resurrect him and bring into life that's a bunch of baloney they'll never give him live for here the son of gods for so give him life one day it will be judged for what he's done man we'll never break into that realm to be able to impart eternal life there's only one that can do that but he humbles himself to be Amanda had a headache all such humility I lose himself to feel stress and duress and pain and all that such humility but notice it was not Christ that became a corpse it was Jesus well let me just go ahead and give you all the clue and if I go by the way of the grave the real Dhoni won't be a corpse that's right neither will you I mean you've seen enough funerals I grew up the church and we walked by and you know I only might touch on their hands I don't like I just don't know I'm not spooked or nothing like that I just don't cuz I know that anything I want to remember him whenever I saw them in their health so my mouth happy and shouting around and praising God Wow because that is the worst degradation that we're able to be identified with laying there lapis and you're laying there and people come around looking at you and you say leave me alone don't come on you're looking at me you can't say nothing you can do nothing they don't never fix your hair you got makeup on you what come on be honest laden sod that term has my corpse but the dev on the corpse the Father Christ chosen course so he had to humble himself to the death of the cross Jesus did he bought patiently endured the shame meekly and overcome yes hell in the grave the curse he was stood it obediently that the wrath of God could be satisfied the Justice of God could be pacified and you and I could be reconciled to the presence of Almighty God I was in a conference it was not accomplished by walking on water going into the hospitals and clearing out the hospital it was through the greatest act of humility this world has ever known he did not conquer sin nor Saints by walking on water he did not conquer sin by healing the sick he conquered sin by humbling himself praise be to God notice in hebrews 10:7 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God the lamb speaking to the dove verse 9 then said he lo I come to do that will of God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second wonder why Paul kept reiterating this over and over again that the man Jesus the man Jesus became obedient he wants to run a parallel that we can see if we are truly Christians with the Spirit of Christ sent us we will be obedient to his every word [Applause] Philippians today being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death he obeyed when obedience would render him a corpse and if God asks us to clean out the books for reading or the music for listening to or movies it's filthy that you're watching a pride and arrogance and a stuffed shirt and whatever more all we just moan and groan and bellyache acting like were giving up off the singing ever us and his was completely voluntary in the attitude of an obedience sir I get my cigarettes up you might as well keep them with that attitude because you come to church and you'll be mad at me and God out on me I'm just fine no I'll buy your back cuz until you get the right spirit on you it ain't gonna do no good [Applause] remember brother branham tell him brother Charlie's daddy about smoking the cigarettes and he said I'll go buy him a pack myself he won't smoke another one wise attitude was right that's right if I could live sorry cigarette if I Nevada said there you go back to what you can do again he said well what do I have to do I he said I told him nothing you accept what he's already done so what I can do that he said here's a creek oh the very form of his dance it was not a nice placid death that he goes in and lifestyle and folds his hand and he's able to do that but he dies the lowest death a man could die do you know that crucifixion was only safe a Roman citizen could not even be crucified a normal average everyday Roman citizen could not be crucified Jesus was subjected beneath them oh my notice in Galatians 3:13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree Hebrews softer looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy this is this who for the joy that was set before him this is the way my brother's sister we overcome hardships set the joy of your reward the rejoice over coming the joy the crown of life the joy of the things that lay in front of you who was for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God now you're not rejoice of this but can you imagine living in the first century and you're a Jew and you pick up and read the Torah where the Torah says cursed is every man that hangs on a tree or you're Greek you're a Gentile and your gods are gods that are Hermes and you know Herodotus and all these different gods and you dress them and splendor you dress them and roll your robes and you're this new Christian God I'm gonna cross naked you're gonna introduce this Jesus to a Greek the Greek who is accustomed to convey its divinities with great crowns great rules you imagine as they begin to hear about this this Jesus is Jesus and he the one that did get that they killed and he the one that they beat and stripped it and you say he's caught the Son of God not only that is God Oh No did you see why was a stumbling block to the Jews it looked like according to the very law he broke their law he didn't break it he fulfilled it he was the consummation of it all he pulled it within himself can have few more minutes let's contrast I'll say a 14 with Philippians 2 Philippians 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation L at this man being you to follow the same pattern made himself of no reputation to go upon in the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man I'm not himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now let's go to Isaiah 14:12 how art our fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning the word there's heylia light-bearer shining one Morningstar how art thou fallen from heaven now we see a new image represented in the prophetic inside of I said the prophet able to go to the very beginning of sin in the universe now notice he doesn't say that he had a parallel or a Winston or a big cigar a God called him on a website a God called him over in the court of heaven drunk oh my this magnificent monarch the height of this order of angels oh ma he was so beautiful and so magnificent and his excellence and glory that in his pride he got lifted up Lucifer also means Daystar hail L to shine or Lucifer Daystar so here is the beginning of sin in the universe they begin with two simple words I will so the son of the morning Lord Jesus the son of the morning or the morning star hmm Lucifer he begin to look around in heaven one day and he realized in this category of angels he was the greatest the most magnificent there was no one as great as him as far as angels and there's only one place for him to go in order to excel his greatness because within himself earned sin started and he began to look at himself instead of looking at the will of God because you can't say I will and God's will at the same time unless you say not my will but thy will be done well min Carol have this saying all the time at home people's gonna do what they want to do it's pretty simple but it's true well I'll tell you what if they're gonna do that I figure I will - they're gonna do what I wanna do I want to serve God I want to go to church I want to live right I want to say with this word people's leaving the message you know how they want to do it well if I want to do that then there are to be another people that has another will inside of them that lines up works a little the father and that's the same will the Lord Jesus a so the Lord Jesus was actually able to consummate the life's phase of this battle in the Garden of Gethsemane nevertheless not my will here is the Alma the answering in the contrast to what healy else said in the very beginning when sin first started I will and he says how long I won't do what I want to do I won't go the way that I wanna I will not go my way I want your will oh my goodness oh I gotta go a little bit farther here I don't leave you hanging too far listen let's look at his original position now did you know that in heaven the devil was God's right-hand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason he was brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God had created and perverted back into an evil thing which started all the sholden beginning then God back before the foundation of the world was ever late now listen when this happened what he's saying what Satan done in his so I ask you is this dangerous inhales pry went over in the north and set up a kingdom and fought against Michael which was Christ and His angels do you see it I do the right hand band of Almighty God was a Lucifer so one day in heaven he got tired of being the associate pastor into Saturday to start his own church [Music] [Music] the sound of the morning the first God granted him almost coworkers with him he was a co-worker partly equal was him this can't you see why Satan loves to do things I get in churches remember the day I was under meetings several years ago Madero pointed out a certain individual there at that place was a worker in that certain area where we were at war really dying that guy's such a blessing and I said I said brother Darrell people like that man right there are some of the most dangerous people you can have in a church he said really I said absolutely they get among the people and they talk and they do this and that and the other well little did I know that man just happened to be doing that very thing that same time that we was there just some years ago in Canada and I preached along this line about Satan being God's right hand man while they're on the pulpit some of the people I knew who most of them I didn't but there was a man said behind me that didn't know who he was I just knew this an associate on the local churches so I wrote this quote and I said like this better here he gets child to be an associate that introduced him tell me he was an associate on the church's there he decided been the associate here on the church and he wants to start his own church well in about three months they call me and said did you know I said no what he said that very man that you pointed to was behind the scenes working right then that's not important that I know what's important is God knew and he wanted him to know we do praise the Lord now friends I don't care P I feel then I feel that do whatever you want to do but when you follow into this line I'll tell you what I'm gonna call you anointed of the death I don't care but the horn does this very saying he's anointed to the death but alas brother down anybody else [Music] and any you follow them and something to revoke that's contrary to the word you're as bad as fallen angels oh boy it's getting warm in here ain't it man alive but you see it's not just that way in a family on a church rather church family but it also gets in homes uh-huh child begins to get or they think they know more than mom and dad sometimes alive can think she knows more and sometimes a wife does know more than us but but a single justifier to take his place it's even a man steps out of his place and the whole continuity of the home is broken and many times a woman has to step up and she actually becomes the priests of the home because a man's the second-story lazy that he won't take a spiritual position in the home which is an absolute shame your Jesus I'm leaving [Applause] you men get in your place be the spiritual priest of your home be the right kind of men in your home and your wives can be in their place and their children can be in their place best and let me finish this quote for you cannot notice this it was partly equal with him only Satan could not create God is the only creator but Satan took something God created and perverted it back into something else evil question answers Satan was the original archangel of God he wants dwelt in the heaven he wants was the greatest person in the heavens outside of God so there's only one person between him and his goals one person stopping him from being everything he aspires to in his dreams just so happens it's the eternal now if it's me a simple bullet in the right place wipes me out and grenade mashed potatoes that's what I look like but you can't blow God up can't shoot him can't kill him can't drowned him can't overcoming but he was so determined he's been trying for thousands of years then I would give him credit for this he's got much more of a determination than some of us did we go Solis little saying oh my brother darlings preach on me I'm going back no more I burned this Devils hat every time I come to church and he's the most faithful member I've got he's here when some of y'all stay at the house you got a head on a stream the devil said man I ain't streaming I'm going to church I'm gonna see what kind of trouble I can cause the line back demons don't sure they covet friends preachers call him alarms preachers I'm tell you what he's doing they call him but deceiveth they called him ever name imaginable and he's right there don't stop and don't even slow him down we beat him we thrash him we whip him we cast him out we call in everything we can call him in the confines of the Word of God and he's right back down to fight tomorrow like it's a brand new day and fight like he's gonna win but he's not the winner we read this to you Satan was the original Archangel of God wants throughout in heaven he was once the greatest person in the heavens now let's be honest if we was going to make ourself an enemy we would never make one that was this close now under the law of contracts you got to prove your greatness but your greatness has to be tried by negativity it has to be tried but something to contrast against it so there was no enemy there was nothing God could not make sense so it makes this being about which knowing his Satan had a soul and in his soul is where this sin was birthed at the universal sin but he don't want to make this little video guy here's Almighty God can do all these great things and how comes his little but he wants to make him right up here where he can look God face to face and tell him you said the devil talks his people into smoking dope with the devil and smarter than that he don't smoke though you don't drink he don't do no that said you'll never catch him there he wants to be like God Otis says he said he was God's right-hand man Wow so if Jesus pre-existed as a man in heaven as a little boy setting over by his daddy's right hand the right hand men to fellowship was Lucifer none another God he was God's right hand men to fellowship and listen what happened to him he got puffed up I'm above God's Word I'm above God's plan look friends bring it down home now this is what's still left in our unconverted flesh that when we hear something preach that we don't like we're guilty of that we struggle with or we take our shovel and give it to brother lack careful careful everybody's stepping on brother night y'all ready on three one two three don't you doc [Laughter] in that guy anything left let's put it on by the team you know what you're doing don't you you're puffing up in your heart I don't need that stuff you do while we're sewing so vineyard or not well I wish they would have to maybe they'll hear the tape but you were here so apparently you needed some of you right all my friends what a great treasure humility is being able tomboy yourself not only before God but before your brothers and sisters thank God it's better to get a few and they'd like to be remembered to have before the Lord you say God keep this evil thing away from me Pratt arrogance what's one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life is many times people who's got it so bad they don't think they do they don't think they did they don't even realize how much they brag on their sale and talk about their self and exhaust herself there so eat up with it they don't even realize Lord Jesus I know that worldliness Compass's so many many things but father we see right here the king of worldliness he didn't begin with smoking or drinking or lying and we know all that's attributes of unbelief but in his heart he was lifted up because of his pride it's amazing how brother Brendan catches that whenever he tells us about sisters and they come to the Lord and they let their hair grow to growing out and then they go to looking at their self and thinking how pretty and attractive they are and Satan takes that very thing that they're commanded in the word to do and if they're not careful he'll turn it into an element of pride if we're not careful you've allowed us to hear and see and understand things that the majority of the church world will never see never hear but God help us to realize pride will try to come in and make us arrogant we'll look down on others that don't know what we know don't hear what we hear instead of approaching it with a thankful heart with appreciation we approach it with an element of pride forgive us Lord the only thing good that we have in our hearts in Our Lives tonight is because of your grace so we have nothing really in ourselves to be proud of we can't boast or brag or anything about us if we have gifts you gave them to us Lord these brothers that have been successful many of them Lord they testify it's your grace and your goodness too may they always be that way but they never begin to sink in their mind well I've done this and I've done that God keep us from such stuff ministers that are here Lord the minister around the world to the bride we see it over and over again when preachers go to get and lifting it up and thinking there's something and thinking their gift is so elite and those so super spiritual and they're so far above everybody else lord help us to realize we're on our way out when they go to thinking of such help us Lord Jesus to realize the only way we can still be used consistently is wilmarie being used more and more is that we must maintain that littleness in our own sight it's not left up to other people to think little of us it must be self generated and it can only come divinely on the birth of the Lamb and our soul and that lamb goes to living out the merged nature of the Lamb and the dove merges in us by the miraculous new birth praise God praise God then that nature helps us Lord and it's a battle every day that we live father one way or another but we so thank you for your over income overcoming power in our lives I pray for each man woman boy girl Lord we know the way Satanists got this civilization set up it ain't enough anymore to have a college education it ain't enough Lord to have just a high school diploma but you got to have this degree in that degree on that degree on that degree we know where all that's coming from and Lord we're not saying so much that it's sin or wrong for people to do it but I pray you help our young people Lord to realize the more educated they become no more smart and the more brilliant they become in their mind help them father to realize that never replace his face help them father to always keep faith first even if their education says one thing and the word says something else they always stay with the word because all it'll take is one little professor that goes to question in this or that or the other and then another and then another then another then they got all kinds of questions in their mind and their faith is being questioned by their intellect but lord help us to believe if every college in the world says we're crazy ever professor says we're out of our mind what difference does that make we're not following professors we're following the Lord Jesus we love your Lord search our hearts and out would you Jesus see if there's any pride any arrogance Lord left and begin with me tonight Lord would you begin with me father God searched me I lay my life Lord as it would be upon a table whenever a person going for a PET scan or an MRI or a CT or whatever more and they follow the directions and they climb upon the table and do what they're told to do and then they let the machine do the rest of it and then the results are displayed and someone is to read it all Holy Spirit of God read the results of my scans and our Father Lord odda I don't want the people's opinion I don't want the Deacons opinion the trustees opinion I want your opinion I want you to scan me tonight as it were Lord and read it to me tell me the truth you always do if there's anything in me Lord God that's contrary to your will contrary to your nature show it to me Lord anybody else feel that same way tonight are you willing to get up on God's tables that were let God scan over your life just to see if there's anything there hallelujah Lord Jesus thank you for your word tonight father we rejoice in your presence lord help us I pray God help us Lord Jesus we worship your father with all of our hearts

rampant I know that the CDC and who and all those different folks are really worried about a pandemic level but I believe our God is still in the business of protecting his people thank you so once you remember all that but got a lot of sickness I know that you're aware of a different prayer requests and so many needs among the the Saints but the wrong Spencer began his treatment yesterday and they're doing what they called an immunotherapy which means they take the t-cells out of his body and supercharge them somehow put those his same t-cells back into his body and then it attacks the cancer in his body so we want to just pray for our brother that God will just be with him and God will help him they helped his body to be able to react to it because the cancerous in the fourth stage in both of his lungs and because it's in both lungs they cannot of course operate be able to take the lungs out and replace them but our God specializes and things that seem like just totally impossible when the doctors told brother Ron he said there's one thing about it this miracle will be truly authenticated because we've got test after test after test and proof after proof so I like I mean you got doctors that are testifying that God is able to move a man god bless you heard you had some good services from brother home of us here and so appreciate our brother coming up and and being with us god bless you let's pray together as we go Heavenly Father is we come to the close of this another service Lord and I realize myself and every person here will have to stand an answer at that day for this very service I will have to answer for what I spoke the attitude I spoke it in the Lord they will have to answer for their response they'll have to answer for what they do with it so we know that with the word comes great responsibility so it's not that we're just setting around and being fed all the time and pampered but it comes with an awesome position for us but we believe you empower us Lord to help us fulfill that responsibility so as we depart from this place in that Lord we're so grateful that we don't have to leave your presence but you'll go with us Lord we're just thinking of all the sickness and all the disease or we will look at our nation that the shape that it's in or never ever believed that a socialist running for president would ever get off the ground in our nation but we see it Lord how frightening that it is if we look at it humanly the Lord to see the government and politics and where they are it's so scary looking at it in the natural sense but we're so glad our faith is not in politics Lord Jesus I pray you would keep us Lord in this hour of Darkness keep us Lord Jesus safe and the protection of your word not only in the physical part but keep our souls Lord God folks are going astray folks think it ain't worth living no more but Lord Jesus we want to be in love with you more than ever before hallelujah because falling in love with Jesus was the best thing we ever done we was trapped in that other marriage and we didn't have no choice but once once we started hearing your words and feeling your sweet arms around us it was the best thing we ever done in our lives go with us now Lord keep your people Lord so much sickness abound but father we still fess and believe in claim that you are our healer go with us now Lord bring
