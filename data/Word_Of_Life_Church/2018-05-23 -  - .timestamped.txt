[24:49] [Music]
[24:50] [Applause]
[24:53] by the contrast of the paradoxical Union
[24:59] that's left in you after the new birth
[25:05] its read about it
[25:06] Song of Solomon chapter six verse three
[25:10] I am My Beloved's and my beloved is mine
[25:20] he feedeth among the lilies thou art
[25:27] beautiful
[25:29] o my love and the word love there's not
[25:32] a verb an action word but it's actually
[25:36] a noun which means an adjective
[25:39] describing a noun which is my companion
[25:44] thou art beautiful oh my companion as
[25:49] tearsa the word tearsa means favorable
[25:55] they are beautiful
[25:57] or my companion as favorable comely as
[26:04] Jerusalem terrible as an army with
[26:09] banners turn away thine eyes from me for
[26:16] they have overcome me the hair is as the
[26:22] flock of goats that appear from Gilead
[26:29] Wow
[26:33] beautiful comely companion fare
[26:39] favorable loved beloved cared for
[26:44] thought about redeemed justified
[26:48] sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[26:53] we've had George let's go home you heard
[26:57] more about Aaron in just a matter of
[26:59] minutes a lot of folks here old 30
[27:00] minutes we're a blessed people friends
[27:05] we're a blessed people let's pray
[27:08] together
[27:09] Heavenly Father thank you for your
[27:12] gracious mercy that has been extended to
[27:15] us we love you so much
[27:18] may you take your word tonight Lord and
[27:21] help us to see blessed God the extension
[27:27] of your mercy how it's been given to us
[27:31] father we love you we want you to know
[27:34] that we don't want you to have to assume
[27:37] or because you're all knowing that you
[27:40] just know it but we want to tell you we
[27:44] want to tell you daily weekly monthly
[27:46] yearly we want to say it many times
[27:50] during the day we just want to let you
[27:53] know you are our everything you're not a
[27:57] spare tire for the bride
[28:00] you are air everything Lord meet the
[28:03] needs of your children to not fathers
[28:05] who speak your word speak to us tonight
[28:08] Lord God we ask in the name of the Lord
[28:11] Jesus and the Saints said god bless you
[28:15] may be seated
[28:19] beautiful fair lovely without spot
[28:27] comely as tearsa beautiful as Jerusalem
[28:33] and yet to see what you are in the
[28:40] reality of your flesh how in the world
[28:43] could you ever see this part about you
[28:46] and you'd be able to acknowledge the
[28:48] other part that every one of us live
[28:51] with every day of our lives I think it
[28:55] will be one of the greatest greatest
[28:57] victories that God will help us as the
[29:00] people of the last day to be able to
[29:04] come to is an understanding not just of
[29:08] intellectually hearing it over and over
[29:10] and over again through repetition and
[29:12] then you intellectually begin to believe
[29:14] it because I say it of the ministers say
[29:17] it and then you grasp a hold of it and
[29:20] you wrap your mind around it a little
[29:21] bit but by divine revelation that God
[29:24] Himself reveals it to you that inner
[29:27] part of you which has been changed is
[29:30] this part that he actually sees right
[29:33] now right now for those that are truly
[29:37] born again and he does not deny the
[29:40] existing part that constantly needs to
[29:43] be corrected they may and there's a part
[29:47] of us that God so loves and can so
[29:50] praised and so adore and so lifts us
[29:53] into heavenly places and there's another
[29:55] part of us he has to wire out in every
[29:57] way every time we come to church it's
[30:00] all right
[30:00] and yet to a real believer they're able
[30:03] to divide that I imagined for those that
[30:05] would maybe not understand or those that
[30:08] would visit from time to time and they'd
[30:10] find it so hard to understand and so
[30:12] hard to comprehend because they hear
[30:14] such complimentary things in one way and
[30:17] such contrasting things in another way
[30:19] I'm sure it must be very confusing to a
[30:23] rebel aided son or daughter of God
[30:25] they're able to divide him and oh the
[30:27] Word of God is coming forth like a sharp
[30:29] sword that sword is dividing asunder
[30:31] between Marr and spirit and bones and
[30:35] all of that sort of thing calling for
[30:37] the seed of Abraham to be separated let
[30:39] us pick it up again worry stopped a few
[30:43] weeks ago before I left our trip to
[30:45] Israel let me begin again with the
[30:47] question answer 64 how can I take a
[30:50] cuckoo bird and make a grain of wheat
[30:53] out of it it's impossible for me
[30:56] to do it the only way it can be is
[30:59] because inside that cocklebur has been
[31:02] transmitted from a cocklebur of wheat a
[31:05] cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life
[31:09] now notice how this then you bury that
[31:13] cocoa burn and it'll produce a grain of
[31:16] wheat that's right see because there has
[31:20] been a life of wheat put in the
[31:24] cocklebur and the life of the cocoa bear
[31:27] has been taken out but the nature of the
[31:31] cocklebur is still sticky
[31:35] see and it will be until this new life
[31:38] has been fully developed out of the
[31:41] grounds raised up again now the new life
[31:46] put inside this old ground still does
[31:51] not change this old ground yet and make
[31:55] the old ground totally compatible to the
[31:59] new life it still leaves a struggle part
[32:03] of the mystery of what the song was
[32:04] solomon says is that she is as terrible
[32:08] as an army with banners so it shows us
[32:13] if there is an army there is a war going
[32:17] on that war is not just her facing the
[32:21] world her facing church anna t it is her
[32:25] facing herself now she is terrible as an
[32:30] army with banners and you got to know
[32:33] what banner to be identified with
[32:34] because a banner has an insignia
[32:38] you know how the roman soldiers were in
[32:40] the generals and the commanders in that
[32:42] they would have a certain thing of
[32:44] regalia which was a makeup of their
[32:47] standard they would have a certain thing
[32:50] of the battalion that they were in they
[32:52] would also have something of symmetry
[32:55] about their family name or each one of
[32:58] the things where it was a leaf or
[32:59] whatever more that signified the amount
[33:02] of people that they had killed or the
[33:05] amount of
[33:06] is that they had conquered someone a
[33:07] general would come and set down his
[33:10] standard the most people they look at it
[33:12] it was just a bunch of warm annotation
[33:14] and meant absolutely nothing but to
[33:16] someone who could read the banner when
[33:19] they put that banner down in the ground
[33:21] this general represented years and years
[33:24] and years of all kinds of battles and
[33:27] difficulties he'd come from this family
[33:30] from this line
[33:31] he went to this campaign and that
[33:33] campaign it was all written in the
[33:36] banner or the insignia that this man
[33:39] stood for it then all the troops stood
[33:41] behind him this is also their
[33:44] identification hey man
[33:48] well I'll tell you one thing our
[33:49] five-star general put his banner down
[33:52] you know what it cost us there's some
[33:55] gates on there
[33:56] it's signified he conquered the gates of
[33:58] hell there's some other gates on there
[34:01] that he conquered the gates of death and
[34:03] he conquered ever disease ever sickness
[34:06] ever trial ever tests all of it is on
[34:09] the insignia of our general and I'm
[34:12] standing behind him tonight what about
[34:14] you
[34:14] so I don't necessarily have to have all
[34:17] of that on my banner but I'm identified
[34:20] with the right general that's all that
[34:23] matters to me now in this I want you to
[34:26] notice how the Prophet lays this out
[34:28] again then you bury that cocklebur it'll
[34:31] produce a grain of wheat because there's
[34:34] been a life of we put in the coca berm
[34:37] and the life of the cuckoo bear has been
[34:40] taken out but the nature of the
[34:43] cocklebur is still sticky and yet you're
[34:45] beautiful
[34:46] you are beautiful and comely and
[34:49] faultless and the virgin bride and you
[34:52] were loved to the Father
[34:53] you're the predestinated seat of God
[34:56] your all these great wonderful things
[34:58] and as sticky as all get-out at the same
[35:05] time
[35:07] but there's two different people now I
[35:10] know nervous reading freak preachers and
[35:12] the message go to get nervous and you
[35:13] preach of this and my fault they don't
[35:15] understand this
[35:16] they're letting tradition behind them
[35:17] will never see ourselves under God opens
[35:20] this - I understand it what's this now
[35:23] and it will be until this new life has
[35:26] been developed out of the ground and
[35:29] raised up again when it comes forth that
[35:32] it's no more cocklebur but wheat but we
[35:36] but while it's here on earth and out of
[35:40] the earth and the cocklebur it's still
[35:42] sticky but it's God the nature on the
[35:47] inside of him of we and as long as
[35:54] you're in this life you're going to be
[35:57] sticky and have a carnal nature that's
[36:01] going to bother you as long as you live
[36:06] oh praise the Lord but the inside of you
[36:12] you're born again and when you're raised
[36:15] up you're in the likeness of Christ then
[36:17] all sin is gone from you see that's the
[36:20] thing now leaving us then was a carnal
[36:24] sticky nature let's look at it this way
[36:26] that certain sticky things will bother
[36:29] you that might not bother you and you
[36:34] might be sticky to something that you
[36:37] would life at and certain things that
[36:39] might be sticky to me
[36:41] other folks would look at and say I
[36:43] can't believe that bothers brother
[36:45] darling well you know each of us are
[36:48] made different our weaknesses our
[36:50] shortcomings our failures and Satan
[36:52] studies us and he knows us very well
[36:55] so he studies our weak tendencies that
[36:58] lean towards certain sticky things
[37:04] all night y'all are gonna just
[37:06] sanctimonious only now aren't you my mom
[37:09] you're gonna pull out your chair up a
[37:10] mask and that's all it is it's a mess I
[37:13] know every one of you well enough to
[37:14] know there ain't no angels here well I'm
[37:16] not saying the right sum here but I know
[37:18] they're not sitting in the pews tonight
[37:20] now every one of us are left with a
[37:23] carnal sneaking nature and as I said
[37:26] before the good thing about it is is
[37:28] that it does truly bother you because
[37:30] you are born again and whenever then we
[37:33] are truly converted and God makes us as
[37:36] beautiful as cheers a comely as
[37:38] Jerusalem oh my what a great thing that
[37:41] God has done inside of our soul and then
[37:44] left us captivated those who do that no
[37:46] doubt to yourself you know the tears it
[37:48] was actually Concord on the west side of
[37:50] the Jordan River and that's up in the
[37:53] northern part of the Land of Israel
[37:54] later become the capital of the Kingdom
[37:57] of Israel and whenever the kingdom was
[37:59] divided into two separate parts known as
[38:02] Israel and Judah tearsa became actually
[38:05] the capital so you're Solomon is don't
[38:08] even reached that place yet but Solomon
[38:10] is comparing the bride to that which is
[38:13] going to be conquered and the northern
[38:16] I'm southern kingdom it was a very
[38:18] beautiful place very place favor with
[38:20] God on the other side of the Jordan
[38:22] River it's actually in the country of
[38:24] Jordan now but yet it was the place of
[38:26] the capital city many great things
[38:29] actually happen there and we look at
[38:31] that why would Solomon not liken the
[38:33] bride to Bethlehem I know the Prophet
[38:35] did later why would she not like in the
[38:37] Gilead why was she not liking that so
[38:39] God has a reason showing that tearsa
[38:42] must be conquered Jerusalem had to be
[38:46] conquered it was taken away from the
[38:48] Jebusites you know what tears are was
[38:50] tears or was a Canaanite city a city
[38:54] about which they worshipped idols and
[38:56] they've done all kinds of terrible
[38:58] things and until Joshua came in and
[39:00] conquered it and then it later become a
[39:03] capital city now then look at the
[39:06] parallel of how the waves of people of
[39:08] God were held in our
[39:10] by nature we were lost without God we
[39:12] were born in this world seemingly with
[39:14] no hope and God began to conquer us and
[39:17] a two-fold way from the very capital of
[39:20] the Northern Kingdom from the genealogy
[39:22] of God from the southern kingdom which
[39:25] will follow up on the Adamic nature
[39:26] which will be redeemed the Earth's a
[39:29] body I'm talking about so the northern
[39:31] kingdom will be conquered already by the
[39:33] new birth and the southern kingdom your
[39:35] body will be conquered at the body
[39:37] change or the resurrection so you will
[39:41] be brought both tearsa and Jerusalem
[39:43] under the headship of one king because
[39:46] in the Millennium there is no divided
[39:49] Kingdom or in the 8th day but until that
[39:53] great day arrives and we are left here
[39:56] in this beautiful ugly situation we are
[39:59] well cheer and this absolute complete
[40:02] perfectly sinless and absolutely rotten
[40:06] stinking lowdown good-for-nothin bodies
[40:09] at the same time now if our soul was
[40:12] absolutely rotten and no good then would
[40:14] be like all the rest of the world and we
[40:16] wouldn't even me even have any magnetism
[40:18] whatsoever for preaching like this at
[40:21] all they were not even brought it
[40:22] wouldn't even make a lick of sense to us
[40:24] but because we had been divided by the
[40:26] new birth and when the Lord Jesus come
[40:29] upon the earth he was the beginning of
[40:30] this new race and that was that whenever
[40:33] the Spirit of God come in him at the
[40:34] river the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[40:36] and he was distilled I died in John 8
[40:39] baptized him and Carol I stood there
[40:41] just a few weeks ago of the Jordan River
[40:43] just as many as it ever was no doubt and
[40:45] yet whenever you stand there and see
[40:47] where Moses was when Moses was allowed
[40:49] by God to look across the river into the
[40:52] land and you look at the mountain where
[40:54] Moses was standing on and see where
[40:56] Jesus was baptized it was the same
[40:58] crossing where Joshua and the children
[41:00] of Israel come across so they stood
[41:02] there what was it then Jesus became the
[41:05] voice of the new race and that he would
[41:08] have two natures listen carefully now he
[41:12] would have the divine nature the
[41:13] fullness of the Godhead bodily but he
[41:15] was also still a man
[41:17] 100% man hundred-percent God so this is
[41:20] why the disciples misunderstood him part
[41:23] of the time it was the man talking all
[41:25] the time that was God talking well it's
[41:28] the same way with you and I we've got
[41:30] that divine nature inside of us which
[41:32] leads us by the Holy Ghost but we've got
[41:34] the human element that we have to deal
[41:36] with every day of our life
[41:38] now notice again question-answer 64 will
[41:41] read this about the Indian again since
[41:43] me received the Holy Ghost he said
[41:45] there's been two dogs in me one of them
[41:47] was a black dog and one of them a white
[41:49] dog and he said they argue at least once
[41:53] every 32 years and there's not much of
[41:56] an argument that goes on because I'm so
[41:58] full of the Holy Ghost that I never had
[41:59] any problems in the flesh that's not the
[42:04] question answers I read they argue all
[42:09] the time they growl and fight at one
[42:13] another oh praise God they argue all the
[42:18] time they growl and fight at one another
[42:21] and the white dog wants me to do good
[42:23] the black dog wants me to do that so
[42:25] well chief which one of them ones to
[42:27] fight said that depends on which one
[42:30] donnie feeds the most or gene feeds the
[42:34] mouse or TM or whoever you are
[42:36] same principle to applies to all of us
[42:39] there just depends on the warring of the
[42:43] body that's in you it depends on which
[42:47] one you cater to notice how identifies
[42:49] this now which nature you cater to the
[42:53] carnal nature I to the things of the
[42:55] world or the spiritual nature add to the
[42:58] things of God now this is not speaking
[43:01] to a person that has just been justified
[43:04] or sanctified they do not get a new
[43:07] nature in the soul by justification or
[43:10] by sanctification that can only come
[43:12] when the new verse has changed their
[43:15] soul this quote does not apply to
[43:18] Baptist it does not apply to messages
[43:22] who are born again it doesn't apply to
[43:25] Methodists who aren't born again it
[43:28] and apply the Pentecostals who aren't
[43:30] born again it only really really applies
[43:32] to the born again of tearsa and
[43:35] Jerusalem that's exactly right
[43:38] now what things are sticky - psalmist
[43:41] has said others were just life and
[43:44] that's some folks you know they have a
[43:45] problem with temper some have a problem
[43:48] with anger some are high patience
[43:50] asexually some have a problem with porn
[43:52] and others it's a what in the world's a
[43:54] matter to you old filthy thing you kind
[43:56] of be a Christian and you have a problem
[43:58] with that well it's easy to see but the
[44:00] way you are chatting them you don't have
[44:02] a problem with it but I wonder if we dig
[44:05] deep enough I'd say we'd find something
[44:07] there so long to you because you're just
[44:09] as sticky as they are only in a
[44:12] different way now does that justify
[44:14] anybody that has a problem pornography
[44:16] absolutely not
[44:17] no more than it justifies anybody that
[44:20] has a problem with anger or gossiping
[44:22] running their big long tongue and
[44:24] causing problems in a family or in the
[44:26] church well preach brother Donnie you
[44:29] see different things bother different
[44:31] folks some folks have you know they're
[44:34] sticky to money
[44:35] some folks are sticky because the more
[44:37] they get the more they want other folks
[44:40] are sticky because they don't ever get
[44:42] how much they want so they have a
[44:44] problem with those who get more than
[44:45] they get because they want more things
[44:47] and they're not smart enough to either
[44:49] be able to make more money so they have
[44:51] an attitude toward the rich so there are
[44:53] all the time care in that situation
[44:55] around are y'all gonna preach to me
[44:56] tonight and others will have a problem
[44:59] because of never feeling loved that
[45:01] devil loves Happy Valley because I don't
[45:04] know how many folks here feel so sorry
[45:06] for herself
[45:07] they're never bragged on enough they're
[45:09] never good or not they're never allowed
[45:11] was somebody appreciate me tonight oh my
[45:14] goodness I'll definitely want to be on
[45:16] that committee to help throw that devil
[45:19] down in hell for those that's never
[45:21] loved enough of those has never
[45:23] appreciated in that their nose has never
[45:25] told by me how good they are come on
[45:28] children that
[45:29] it's a devil that gets on people and
[45:32] folks need to get rid of it if you are
[45:34] coming here simply because how much I
[45:37] brag on you you better go somewhere else
[45:39] you ought to be coming here because you
[45:42] get your soul fair you get your body
[45:45] heal you feel the presence of God you
[45:48] watch the presence of God and this is a
[45:51] hospital
[45:52] and this is a refueling station and will
[45:55] not you to hand out diapers and
[45:57] pacifiers other folks fight an
[46:07] unforgiving spirit so things of that
[46:15] nature they're sticky and it just called
[46:18] clings rattle brother I hate to tell you
[46:27] but you've got this thing hanging on
[46:29] here what what are y'all laughing about
[46:43] huh well y'all look at that whatever but
[46:50] you see folks are so touchy in this day
[46:52] and age if they got something that big
[46:53] hanging onto him you can't tell them cuz
[46:56] they get mad and get offended at you oh
[47:01] my goodness oh you did not believe for
[47:03] in the hundreds of people that I've had
[47:05] tell me tell me the truth tell me their
[47:07] truth and you didn't then they leave or
[47:10] you do tumble truths and they get mad
[47:11] most folks do not want the truth
[47:13] I've time that Christians they don't
[47:16] care you tell no truths about somebody
[47:18] else but just don't tell the truth about
[47:20] them and then we've got all these things
[47:23] hanging on to us and others like I said
[47:25] oh my goodness that don't bother me well
[47:27] no whatever it is that bothers you
[47:29] though this said the devil will have it
[47:31] there and it'll hang on you like a ball
[47:33] fall I'm an ill just hang and you'll
[47:35] have a no stinking rotten attitude oh
[47:40] now you know the Bible sets us an
[47:44] emphatic law how that we as the saints
[47:46] of God should not even provoke one
[47:48] another really when it comes to problems
[47:50] in situations notices and the
[47:52] unpardonable sin no time said provoke
[47:54] their means to encourage encourage one
[47:57] another unto love and to good works if
[47:59] you see a brother in the church that's
[48:02] got something against the other brother
[48:04] don't say something to stir that thing
[48:07] up but say something that'll bring them
[48:10] together but it's amazing how many
[48:13] people when they see something going on
[48:15] in a family or in a church and city of
[48:18] trying say something to provoke one
[48:20] another to good works they'll take that
[48:22] thing and spread it around and they're
[48:24] actually adding more fuel to the fire to
[48:27] make it bigger and bigger there's
[48:30] something wrong with that person
[48:32] well hallelujah notice again if you're
[48:36] my brother tonight don't feel that way
[48:38] when you see your brothers falling out
[48:39] and sharp words between one another if
[48:42] you don't feel like bringing them
[48:43] together it's your time to go to the
[48:45] altar now if there's something on you
[48:48] that makes you want to sow discord and
[48:51] get among the saints of God and when
[48:53] there's a situation going on tell you
[48:55] right now
[48:56] if you fall into that thing over and
[48:57] over again you better go to praying well
[49:01] hallelujah
[49:02] I didn't realize that I was gonna be
[49:05] grub that I'm grabbing around your root
[49:08] Center something happened in your life
[49:12] there's something you've been deceived
[49:15] in my goodness deceived because you
[49:19] actually so discord among other discord
[49:22] and if you do that you're deceived well
[49:25] that's what he said you haven't the
[49:28] experience that God wants you to have
[49:30] but jesus said when he was reviled he
[49:33] reviled not again he was spoken evil he
[49:36] spoke not back again and when they're
[49:38] done evil to him I'll notice that he did
[49:41] good to them when they persecuted him
[49:45] and nailed him to the cross he looked
[49:47] down and said Father forgive them for
[49:49] they don't know what they're doing
[49:51] if that kind of spirits not in you the
[49:54] Holy Ghost has never entered you yet
[49:58] that was the same spirit in Christ Jesus
[50:05] the Bible said let it be in you and then
[50:11] we all have this stickiness called
[50:16] complexes complexes some of them we were
[50:24] born with some of them we inherited from
[50:28] our parents or uncle's or grandparents
[50:32] it's scary what we are
[50:36] notice this now this Centurion a
[50:39] Centurion is a man that I think the
[50:41] right word that the over century which
[50:43] would be a hundred men he put himself in
[50:46] the background I saw him at the man that
[50:48] came to Jesus of course and said I'm not
[50:50] worried that it come under your roof I'm
[50:51] not worthy to ask you for anything but
[50:53] would you grant this huh yeah I'll come
[50:55] no you don't need to come you don't need
[50:57] to come I'm not worthy of that I'm not
[50:58] whether if you didn't come all you gotta
[51:00] do just speak the word now he said he
[51:02] put himself in the background I want you
[51:05] to do that keep yourself in the
[51:07] background never be somebody that you're
[51:10] not
[51:11] I've often wondered when wheat was
[51:14] growing in the field you see the little
[51:16] wheat that sticks up and just feels like
[51:19] it's so the inferiority complex so now
[51:26] when the wheat is in this stage that it
[51:29] has no actually seed yet then the wheat
[51:33] head will stand right straight up it's
[51:37] showing its inferiority complex so it's
[51:41] trying to make itself look bigger than
[51:45] the brother it goes to church with or
[51:48] the sister now some folks came out
[51:53] saying this person or that person or
[51:55] that person or say I'll play them on the
[51:57] piano the drums of the guitar so many
[52:00] will try to do it by being super
[52:02] spiritual hey man boy if somebody all
[52:07] know this you'd want to roam Mountain
[52:09] tonight wouldn't it had a picnic yeah so
[52:15] then what is it it is an inferiority
[52:18] complex now you know what preachers
[52:19] fight this as well so for a preacher
[52:22] that just gets to preach say so many
[52:24] times and and a month and he don't get
[52:26] to preach every weekend or ever so often
[52:28] or a singer that is not you know as much
[52:31] of a blessing to the church as other
[52:33] singers are then if they're not careful
[52:35] they get all offended and get all bent
[52:37] out of shape and they get jealous and
[52:39] get mad whatever more look it's not my
[52:41] fault if you're singing don't bless the
[52:43] church it's not my
[52:45] that every preacher don't bless the
[52:47] church I want to bring folks in here
[52:49] that bless you I want to bring ministers
[52:52] in whether I'm here I'm gone and if I
[52:54] bring them in a few times and I don't
[52:56] you'll get reports back from the site
[52:58] I'm just gonna politely probably not
[53:00] call him anymore then folks they say oh
[53:03] well that's the way it is you go to them
[53:05] big churches and Lord you preach hard
[53:08] they won't have your back
[53:10] is it that or is it that you didn't feed
[53:13] the flock but you see an inferiority
[53:17] complex will always justify the one who
[53:20] has the head stuck up the highs well
[53:26] praise God my goodness I stood the other
[53:33] day and the ancient city of Nazareth
[53:35] they took a parcel of ground and they've
[53:38] reconstructed it's sort of like living
[53:41] farms and things we have around here so
[53:43] there's people walking around first
[53:44] century garments you know they're hewing
[53:47] stone and they're doing vineyards and
[53:49] all of yours and things like that we
[53:51] come over to a place which was an Olive
[53:53] Press it looked to be one probably 2,000
[53:55] years ago old very ancient event
[53:57] archaeological coins and different
[53:59] things there so here it was that the
[54:01] process of the way that they would did
[54:03] it perfect description when you look at
[54:04] the parable the way Jesus described it
[54:06] so it would be out of yard or a vineyard
[54:08] is very very similar so that have a
[54:10] hollowed-out feud places where they've
[54:11] taken trample it around and they either
[54:13] do it on donkeys or they take a round
[54:15] wheel and go round and around and around
[54:17] and around and oppress then it would
[54:19] come down that have three times which
[54:21] would say they'd pull it out three pulls
[54:22] out of the olives and they would take it
[54:24] out and press out the first press is the
[54:26] extra pure virgin then they would do the
[54:28] second then they would do the third and
[54:30] as they would do that there was a
[54:32] process but they also had what British
[54:34] took out to me one of the things was
[54:35] that there was a tower inside of this
[54:38] vineyard and one of the brothers hair
[54:40] asked the God said what's that up there
[54:41] for said that was a watchtower said why
[54:44] would you need a watchtower and a lot of
[54:47] yard or in all of your vineyard or
[54:49] someone tell you say because people
[54:51] would come in and steal them once they
[54:53] got right
[54:54] and then I realized and Jesus said it
[54:56] for us in the parable that he was
[54:58] talking about the ministry led by the
[55:00] Holy Ghost that God sets out his plants
[55:03] all over the earth and then he puts men
[55:05] in the watchtower so on the right the
[55:07] thieves would come in and try to steal
[55:09] the grapes and that should all the
[55:11] things that was going on all of your
[55:12] labor was gone so what did God do God
[55:15] put man with a watchful eye lid but the
[55:17] holy ghost in the watchtower and the
[55:20] watchtower wasn't 40 miles away it was
[55:22] right there it was in viewing this it's
[55:24] right next to the Olive Press amen right
[55:28] there where it was so they could watch
[55:30] what was going on that's the way the
[55:32] devil does the Church of the Living God
[55:34] so when the church grows and matures and
[55:37] become what God wants it to be then
[55:38] Satan tries to send in the bandits and
[55:41] the robbers of this and that but God has
[55:43] got Watchmen in the watchtower and
[55:46] they're trying their best to watch out
[55:47] over our souls in this end time and they
[55:51] knows we need them oh yes we need them
[55:54] now notice then how that people with an
[55:57] inferiority complex now the Prophet said
[56:00] you see that little way that sticks up
[56:02] it feels that inferiority complex
[56:04] there's nothing in that head a heavy
[56:07] head bowels a full head bowels a full
[56:13] heart will bow see Lord not worthy now
[56:18] people this all the time God is
[56:19] justified you know preachers I get so
[56:22] sick in my stomach and preachers all the
[56:23] time I want here and preaching I want
[56:25] and preach and I want there and I'll
[56:26] tell you what I've done there I was so
[56:28] annoying that I preach this and I think
[56:30] what do you got to prove are you trying
[56:31] to prove it to me I trying to prove to
[56:34] me how many places you go preach I'm
[56:35] really not interested in such stuff what
[56:38] are we doing I'll return to build
[56:39] ourselves the kingdom or the kingdom of
[56:41] God what do we intercept how many
[56:43] peoples on your mailing list how many
[56:44] people stream our services versus stream
[56:47] how many other says I really don't care
[56:48] I don't know how many people stream our
[56:51] services I don't know what countries
[56:53] they stream I don't have
[56:54] number that is the least of my concern
[56:56] if it was left up to me I'd dismantle
[56:59] the whole thing and nobody wouldn't
[57:01] stream anyhow I'm not interested in
[57:03] building a rage in our kingdom I'm
[57:05] interested in taking my gift my labor my
[57:09] ability my desire and trying to build
[57:12] out the kingdom of Jesus Christ anybody
[57:17] with me and that kid notice this in the
[57:37] doors of the door then there's a little
[57:39] compartment the heart called in
[57:41] different Oh what a condition that
[57:45] things get into a little indifferent you
[57:49] love to be just a little indifferent
[57:51] toward others you want your own way
[57:55] you'd be willing to let Jesus in but you
[57:58] want to continue to live in the same
[57:59] place you've always lived boy if he
[58:01] didn't describe the modern lyricism in
[58:04] the same place you've always lived you
[58:07] don't want to get away from your old
[58:08] associates you just don't want to give
[58:10] them that you think they're nice people
[58:12] and you just don't want to give them up
[58:15] so you want to be a little different
[58:18] mama that's another bad compartment in
[58:21] the heart then there's another little
[58:23] door called jealousy oh I don't know
[58:27] whether you Yankees know anything about
[58:29] it or not now he's in Newark New Jersey
[58:32] now some of you all have laughed at me
[58:34] and looked down that may have scorned
[58:36] for years and I've used the term Yankee
[58:38] I'm sorry you didn't know that was the
[58:40] term to proper use notice this now I
[58:43] don't know whether you Yankees know
[58:45] anything about it or not but down south
[58:51] you have a lot of it well let me just
[58:55] back that up here we're on 2018 we still
[58:58] have it
[59:00] mm-hmm oh just a little inferior to the
[59:04] other man just a little better than the
[59:05] other church if the Jones is painter
[59:08] steps Ridge you've got to have yours red
[59:10] oh what a horrible spirit to be in a
[59:15] Christian but remember you're beautiful
[59:25] and you're coming and your beloved and
[59:30] wonderful it's a good thing so long say
[59:34] because with all this tact on us would
[59:36] be a mess now y'all were professional
[59:42] hearers and you've been hearing me
[59:43] preach long enough to know that you're
[59:46] trying now to be real courteous and amen
[59:48] things that's burning their hide because
[59:50] you don't want to be so obvious when I
[59:52] really get down will you live oh my
[1:00:00] goodness oh my notice this God being
[1:00:04] misunderstood brother branham I'm saved
[1:00:08] I've been baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ but how do I get away from a
[1:00:14] stubborn spirit that I can't seem to
[1:00:17] break away from well now once you notice
[1:00:24] now what he calls them you serpents eat
[1:00:27] you child of the devil my Christian
[1:00:33] brother or sister whoever it may be now
[1:00:38] most times when you find people that's
[1:00:42] got stubborn spirits it's usually a
[1:00:46] complex that causes this a complex and
[1:00:54] what do complexes attach themself to
[1:00:59] cockle burrs
[1:01:02] there's not a soul here tonight that's
[1:01:04] born again that has a complex your Holy
[1:01:09] Ghost don't have a problem with my Holy
[1:01:11] Ghost because it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:01:14] but I guarantee our flesh will clash and
[1:01:18] something that will bother you and give
[1:01:21] you an inferiority complex
[1:01:22] a life that didn't go on something that
[1:01:25] somebody would say or do to me and all
[1:01:26] of it just hurt me so bad and you'd say
[1:01:29] grow up Tommy now notice where it comes
[1:01:40] from usually our complex that causes is
[1:01:43] either they have inherited it from a
[1:01:46] mother father uncle aunt mother father
[1:02:01] uncle and grandmother grandfather
[1:02:05] somebody like that and if you chase it
[1:02:09] back down through the life now I've
[1:02:10] taken it by experience under discernment
[1:02:12] because I've met cases on the platform
[1:02:18] thousands thousands now my question for
[1:02:25] you is those people that he met years
[1:02:28] ago this is 61 those people that he met
[1:02:31] years ago what happened to those
[1:02:33] stubborn spirits when they died
[1:02:52] so not to be too indirect
[1:02:58] [Applause]
[1:03:04] anybody ever gets stubborn oh I knew I
[1:03:10] was head of the Holy Ghost to preach
[1:03:11] this than that may y'all just hung
[1:03:15] yourself I'm having confirmed it I have
[1:03:23] met cases on the platform thousands of
[1:03:26] those that had that spirit and the first
[1:03:32] thing you know I chased that spirit
[1:03:33] right night by discernment that's what I
[1:03:39] love about a prophet of God another
[1:03:43] preacher standing out and pray and pray
[1:03:44] and pray and pray we're just not gifted
[1:03:46] like a prophet was to do that but that
[1:03:48] prophet is standing there and praying
[1:03:49] not only that he chase that thing about
[1:03:50] uncle songs over Lucy I mean whoever
[1:03:53] more chase that devil right back oh my
[1:03:55] goodness
[1:03:56] hallelujah I chase her spirit right back
[1:03:58] by discernment and found there was a
[1:04:00] granddaddy there was a grandmother there
[1:04:02] was somebody else back down there and
[1:04:05] you inherit that by but brother Donnie
[1:04:17] what about when I'm born again but you
[1:04:20] but Ellis we got to be born again right
[1:04:22] so what was born again this nature here
[1:04:25] was not the nature of sin this is what
[1:04:28] you inherited from them genetically what
[1:04:30] was born again was what she was born in
[1:04:32] sinful nature this is human nature
[1:04:35] this is what many of us have spent
[1:04:37] decades of our Christian life trying to
[1:04:40] perfect they're trying to perfect uncle
[1:04:43] Williams nature and ain't Suzy Bell's
[1:04:46] temper and your time to perfect daddy's
[1:04:48] arrogance and mama stubbornness and
[1:04:52] ain't Lucy's whatever Lord and uncle
[1:04:55] so-and-so you my y'all forget all that
[1:04:57] relatives what you need to focus on is
[1:05:00] what Papa God gave you to pray named
[1:05:03] Suzy Bell to subjection to the world and
[1:05:06] ain't Lucifer I mean a losing case you
[1:05:13] see what we're trying to do perfect our
[1:05:15] family why don't you admit it your
[1:05:17] family's like the rest of all of our
[1:05:19] sours a bunch of renegades and Lars when
[1:05:30] I brother Donnie that applies to
[1:05:32] everybody but the answer's no I've
[1:05:33] pastored enough yon sister know that
[1:05:35] covers them too and horns and Regan's
[1:05:39] and cuts and wit's ins as a matter of
[1:05:45] fact I don't see anybody in her that's
[1:05:46] exempt we're all on the same plateau so
[1:05:50] get your nose out of the air Oh brother
[1:06:02] Donnie it's a shame you couldn't have
[1:06:03] any aunts
[1:06:04] I have enough problems being a Reagan
[1:06:07] why would I want to be a Yas
[1:06:09] it's a shame it couldn't have been a bad
[1:06:11] wine the God's earth but I want to be a
[1:06:13] bap I need to be a new creature
[1:06:16] not a bad not a Reagan a new creature oh
[1:06:22] I know this hurt some of y'all's
[1:06:24] feelings it needs to be hurt
[1:06:27] you need to bring your family tree down
[1:06:30] where it belongs in the dirt
[1:06:31] with all the rest of us oh man praise
[1:06:40] the Lord
[1:06:42] stubbornness is not of God and now the
[1:06:57] only lady get away from that is you have
[1:07:00] to have faith to overcome that you can
[1:07:06] read all the self-help books you want to
[1:07:08] it'll never do it I'm not saying that
[1:07:11] there's not things that might not help
[1:07:12] you count to 145 and then whenever you
[1:07:14] get down 146 you'll match somebody's no
[1:07:17] Shore is the world if you're a Christian
[1:07:21] you're a son or daughter of God oh my
[1:07:24] goodness your son or daughter of God
[1:07:25] whatever it may be you'll never be able
[1:07:28] to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it
[1:07:31] I'll rebuild it it's right analyzing a
[1:07:35] rattlesnake so your money now what a
[1:07:49] strange thing would think we just
[1:07:51] rebuking that don't work on everything
[1:07:58] it's art analyzing a rattlesnake he's
[1:08:01] laying right there ready to bite you so
[1:08:05] what does the rattlesnake of
[1:08:07] stubbornness do when he bites you makes
[1:08:09] you more stubborn and he makes your
[1:08:12] stubbornness really stick out then you
[1:08:18] know you got serpent bit I mean snake
[1:08:20] bit something l wonder where the
[1:08:24] serpents 8 is why don't you wake
[1:08:29] but listen this cure if you will just
[1:08:35] ignore him and walk away from him he
[1:08:42] can't hurt you but that's true simple
[1:08:51] and how hard that is to walk away from
[1:08:57] see when you feel that you've got a
[1:08:59] stubborn spirit lay the thing on the
[1:09:01] altar and believe God that the thing is
[1:09:04] dead and you'll never have it no more
[1:09:08] and go home don't even pay any attention
[1:09:11] to it no more and the thing will leave
[1:09:16] you resist the devil and he will flee
[1:09:19] from you that's get away quickly so that
[1:09:22] would be my advice had overcome it we
[1:09:24] overcome the devil and this applies to
[1:09:27] everything no matter what you gone
[1:09:29] through we overcome the devil by faith
[1:09:33] [Applause]
[1:09:41] but then there's another kind of complex
[1:09:43] I realized that there's an element of
[1:09:48] people around the message that do not
[1:09:49] want the humanity of brother Brennan
[1:09:52] brother out folks have got mad at me for
[1:09:57] decades for making him brother and I'm a
[1:10:00] man I've told folks don't get mad at me
[1:10:01] for making a man get mad at God gods who
[1:10:03] want to make him a man but I do read
[1:10:08] enough to be able to pick out things
[1:10:10] that he said about his humanity he was
[1:10:14] not God he was born lost he had to be
[1:10:18] saved sanctified received the Holy Ghost
[1:10:20] just like me and you had to be baptized
[1:10:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus his name
[1:10:25] will not cast out devils his name will
[1:10:28] not raise the dead nor heal the sick he
[1:10:32] is not the third Adam
[1:10:35] he is our prophet of God and we thank
[1:10:38] God for it
[1:10:39] but we do not worship Him now I'm sure
[1:10:44] brother Branham brings to us the seals
[1:10:46] three months after and sending in the
[1:10:48] gap he's dealing with this complex and
[1:10:50] he's come to a climax to it and he said
[1:10:53] that the Lord spoke to him he said why
[1:10:55] do you wait for me to move you every
[1:10:57] time you move where is your reward then
[1:10:59] I've seen and said do you remember I
[1:11:01] told you don't you remember what brother
[1:11:02] Roberson told you in his dream or vision
[1:11:04] that he had done like Moses you've
[1:11:07] forgot the feeling the feeling of your
[1:11:11] people
[1:11:11] you forgot the call that I called you -
[1:11:15] can you imagine the only Gentile prophet
[1:11:19] we Gentiles ever had great major prophet
[1:11:22] not a man that had been preceded in that
[1:11:25] it had the ministry and the supernatural
[1:11:27] and the word March is one thing after
[1:11:29] another at another and yet come to a
[1:11:31] spot or God told him you forgot what I
[1:11:34] called you to do how is that possible
[1:11:39] complex why brother branham's flesh
[1:11:43] wasn't born again it was sticky
[1:11:48] go ahead and say man it won't hurt you
[1:11:50] you won't have a heart attack your kids
[1:11:51] won't die with cancer it's the truth
[1:11:56] you'll never see yourself if you don't
[1:11:58] look at him right that's why the devil
[1:12:00] is trying his best to absolutely make a
[1:12:02] god out of brother Branham if brother
[1:12:05] Branham was the wave sheaf and he was
[1:12:07] God then that means you've got to be God
[1:12:09] he was the first one to come to maturity
[1:12:11] so if he was God
[1:12:13] absolutely God then that means I've got
[1:12:15] to be in order to follow the same cycle
[1:12:18] of wheat and so do you so we're all in
[1:12:22] this well praise the Lord
[1:12:25] notice this you forgot the feeling of
[1:12:28] your people you forgot the call that I
[1:12:31] called you to I let the sick lame I want
[1:12:36] the Lord tell me where to go and what
[1:12:37] not to do that's wrong I had built
[1:12:40] myself a complex because the people
[1:12:44] didn't hear my message wonder what in
[1:12:49] the world he'd do now
[1:12:51] to hear what people are doing with it if
[1:12:55] they're not hearing it cause the complex
[1:12:58] what in the world would he do now to see
[1:13:00] what people are doing with his missus
[1:13:05] now this is a different complex of
[1:13:08] course than stubbornness this is
[1:13:10] different from an inferiority type of
[1:13:13] complex yet it has its strain and its
[1:13:16] roots still back to brother Branham
[1:13:19] being rejected as a young boy now he was
[1:13:22] rejected by his father because of course
[1:13:25] he was identified as being a he
[1:13:28] was rejected by the folks the young
[1:13:31] folks he went to school with remember
[1:13:33] when he was going to take the cigarette
[1:13:34] and smoke at the little girl laughter I
[1:13:36] didn't call him a and the sound
[1:13:38] come in the bush and here on crying
[1:13:40] remember that so you see this pattern in
[1:13:43] his life of being rejected rejected
[1:13:45] rejected rejected well then it turns now
[1:13:49] it becomes converted of course as a
[1:13:51] young man receives the call of God steps
[1:13:53] into the office of a prophet God gives
[1:13:55] him the great things in the
[1:13:57] understanding of the word but does that
[1:13:59] humanity becomes so subjected to the
[1:14:03] Word of God that the coca BER part which
[1:14:05] was always there is it always down
[1:14:08] totally annihilate and then way with
[1:14:10] absolutely not three months after the
[1:14:13] lamb takes the book and opens the seals
[1:14:15] we hear the confession of this man this
[1:14:18] is the reason I can follow this kind of
[1:14:20] a man a preacher that stands up and
[1:14:22] never lets on his humanity I wouldn't
[1:14:24] follow him nowhere because that's where
[1:14:26] he'll take you nowhere but this man was
[1:14:29] able to stand before a congregation
[1:14:31] knowing that these tapes would be played
[1:14:33] for years and years and years after he
[1:14:35] was gone for the day I'd be able to
[1:14:37] stand and admit that he was wrong
[1:14:40] come on church why is it that we have
[1:14:43] such a hard time admitting our fault and
[1:14:45] admitting our wrong and we want to blame
[1:14:47] everybody else you're not in the spirit
[1:14:49] of the message until you can be able to
[1:14:52] admit you're wrong and say it's my fault
[1:14:54] I'm the one to blame I'm the one to
[1:14:57] blame from my own shortcomings not my
[1:14:58] wife not my pastor not the church it's
[1:15:01] me in the need of prayer watch him you
[1:15:08] imagine this must have been embarrassing
[1:15:11] humiliating to stand and have to tell
[1:15:15] people this I built myself a complex
[1:15:21] because the people didn't hear my
[1:15:22] message god forbid that I try to compare
[1:15:24] the life of Moses but that's exactly
[1:15:26] what Moses did the people wouldn't
[1:15:28] listen to him when I went to deliver
[1:15:29] them so we just left them alone went
[1:15:32] into the wilderness but God turned him
[1:15:33] around he longed for God the suffering
[1:15:37] people further down in the message
[1:15:40] actually brings this now pressure of 173
[1:15:42] god bless you each one and we hope to
[1:15:45] see you again real soon till then will
[1:15:47] you do this one favor for me now both
[1:15:48] here and on tapes also your brethren
[1:15:51] pray that God will place into my heart
[1:15:56] that's something that I lost out there
[1:16:01] in that complex
[1:16:06] now this is one of the things that Satan
[1:16:09] wants us to have complexes for because
[1:16:13] we tend to lose things in complexes we
[1:16:18] can lose love respect honor trust burden
[1:16:23] desire so many many things brother
[1:16:26] branham a prophet of God preaching the
[1:16:28] word bringing the Word of God to the
[1:16:31] Gentiles he believed this but somehow he
[1:16:35] had lost an element of love still
[1:16:38] preaching still going oh it can happen
[1:16:45] to a song leader it can happen to a
[1:16:46] deacon that can happen to a library
[1:16:48] worker it can happen to a pastor can
[1:16:50] happen to a trustee it can happen to a
[1:16:52] mother it can happen to a father it can
[1:16:55] happen to some of the best of God's
[1:16:57] people why
[1:17:03] carnal sticky nature notices pray that
[1:17:11] God were placed into my heart that
[1:17:13] something that I lost out there in that
[1:17:18] complex it's so easy to build a compass
[1:17:22] now what did you notice he doesn't say
[1:17:24] the people built it he doesn't say the
[1:17:27] devil did he says he did but the people
[1:17:33] gave him the material to build it with
[1:17:39] so if you're an introvert and you come
[1:17:42] to a large church and you have a hard
[1:17:45] time making friends and whether it's a
[1:17:49] big church or a little Church you're
[1:17:51] gonna have cliques
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:17:53] hey man Melanie and the truth of it is
[1:17:58] there's always going to be people that
[1:17:59] you're going to be more comfortable with
[1:18:01] than other people
[1:18:02] because your stickiness is more sticky
[1:18:04] but their stickiness than it is with
[1:18:06] other people's stickiness so some of you
[1:18:10] can cling together because your
[1:18:12] stickiness is on the same frequency and
[1:18:14] other people you try to stick with their
[1:18:16] stickiness turns into thorns and you all
[1:18:19] for each other I need to take a vacation
[1:18:33] short I said well you say you just come
[1:18:36] back off of what I know it but boy I
[1:18:37] don't know what the world happened to be
[1:18:42] now because of this then brother branham
[1:18:46] recognizes something helps him brother
[1:18:49] he must have be able to see that he's
[1:18:51] lost something he's not feeling the same
[1:18:53] this is so ratchet
[1:18:55] don't you appreciate anion on a server
[1:18:58] of God like this against him before the
[1:18:59] people in Omaha so he's desiring notice
[1:19:04] what God does now God doesn't take sides
[1:19:06] with brother branham and blame the
[1:19:09] people and Sal tell what you do you
[1:19:11] stand out here Moses and I'll raise up a
[1:19:14] whole generation after you I'll kill
[1:19:16] them off out God don't do that God don't
[1:19:19] take sides with brother branham and send
[1:19:21] against the people God actually rebukes
[1:19:23] brother Brennan why because brother
[1:19:25] branham was wrong
[1:19:28] Oh Lord Jesus here we go again and
[1:19:43] because of the stickiness he lost
[1:19:48] something that carnal sticky nature so
[1:19:54] if you come to our church and you're an
[1:19:56] introverted type of person you don't
[1:19:58] make friends well you stand out there
[1:20:00] and you come in at the time and stand
[1:20:02] out there and already nobody comes to
[1:20:03] you and you're wanting friends and
[1:20:05] people don't think you do because the
[1:20:06] look you got on your face or because you
[1:20:08] never really say anything back so you're
[1:20:10] sending your misunderstood they
[1:20:11] misunderstand you you misunderstand them
[1:20:13] it ain't a friendly Church that beats
[1:20:15] all I ever heard in my life because I
[1:20:16] hear it all over the world people who
[1:20:18] come here to our church this one the
[1:20:19] friends church they were singing or life
[1:20:20] other people come in say well that ain't
[1:20:22] that ain't your friend a church at all
[1:20:23] something messed up somewhere somebody's
[1:20:26] got the green war on the blue post and
[1:20:28] the blue post on the purple wire or
[1:20:30] something something bad wrong now look
[1:20:32] what is it that pulls people through
[1:20:35] that it's the way they're wired in the
[1:20:37] frequency of their mind and they're
[1:20:39] pulling stuff through some of you
[1:20:40] tonight assent right now pulling what
[1:20:42] I'm preaching not through the ear of the
[1:20:44] Holy Ghost
[1:20:45] you're now pulling it through the Holy
[1:20:47] Ghost you are pulling it through your
[1:20:49] complexes that's why you walk out of
[1:20:51] here sometime
[1:20:52] mad or aggravated or whatever more to
[1:20:54] preacher because you sat there and
[1:20:56] pulled the sermon through your complexes
[1:20:58] and said of moving beyond your complex
[1:21:00] and said lord help me to get out of the
[1:21:02] way and you'll get up and stomp out and
[1:21:04] get mad he was throwing that right at me
[1:21:06] I'll tell you one high coming back no
[1:21:09] more you know why you sellin heard the
[1:21:11] whole servant through your complex
[1:21:13] why don't you die to that thing and let
[1:21:16] the Lord hear the word through the Holy
[1:21:18] Ghost instead of your inferiority soar
[1:21:22] nobody likes me
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:33] well I've had problems as people of
[1:21:36] happy valley I'd say you even had near
[1:21:41] as many as I have so if anybody's got a
[1:21:46] right to leave I did but I'm not basing
[1:21:57] my position on such stupidity and that's
[1:22:00] what it is
[1:22:02] well if you're gonna do that then this
[1:22:04] compared on down I'll show you how
[1:22:06] ignorant that it is I've had problems
[1:22:08] with humans so why don't you leave the
[1:22:09] human race and join the monkey race come
[1:22:14] on
[1:22:14] humans have lost cause you your problem
[1:22:17] people have called why don't you go join
[1:22:19] the Hogs it's in dirt face it you have
[1:22:30] all these complexes within yourself
[1:22:33] nobody likes me nobody wants to be
[1:22:36] around me and you live in that world man
[1:22:45] I wish some Sunday morning people
[1:22:47] could've been here tonight whoo what'd
[1:22:51] y'all think about if I preach this again
[1:22:52] in the morning
[1:22:59] now watch brother branham so he asked
[1:23:03] the people to pray for him now they
[1:23:04] changed us a little bit so they had an
[1:23:06] interview the other day with my brother
[1:23:08] Wei sitting there standing here in front
[1:23:11] a good man but built yourself around a
[1:23:14] complex another kind of a complex a semi
[1:23:20] all-new brother Wei but there's just a
[1:23:22] way they came here years ago they visit
[1:23:23] it was something y'all let me share in
[1:23:24] the church for I came here I had to
[1:23:27] interview the other day said would
[1:23:28] brother Wei standing here a good man I
[1:23:30] built itself around a complex another
[1:23:32] kind of a complex because by the way was
[1:23:35] not liked by the brand but the way we
[1:23:38] started the position of brother branham
[1:23:40] so apparently that kind of complex would
[1:23:42] not work for brother Wei but by the way
[1:23:45] had his own special complex it's a case
[1:23:49] of your have your own special I hate
[1:23:53] that thing don't you
[1:23:54] or maybe I should say things most of us
[1:23:58] have got more than one it's not Lay's
[1:24:01] potato chips nobody gonna have just one
[1:24:05] notice another kind of a complex that
[1:24:07] did the same thing by the way you can so
[1:24:10] easily do it let's just get a little
[1:24:14] something in your and keep thinking that
[1:24:23] way brother Donny don't want me brother
[1:24:27] don'ti don't want me brother Terry don't
[1:24:30] like me then it'll go from that thought
[1:24:32] to brother Terry hates me brother che he
[1:24:37] despises me that man I'll tell you what
[1:24:39] I believe he could run me over with his
[1:24:41] car if he could get by with it and
[1:24:43] where's it come from your mind but it's
[1:24:46] built from the focus of a complex within
[1:24:50] your being so you will interpret his
[1:24:53] body language you will interpret that
[1:24:55] smile and face it's the most always on
[1:24:57] there you will interpret that as
[1:25:00] ridiculing you
[1:25:02] he's looking down on you because you're
[1:25:06] pulling it through your complex which we
[1:25:10] all love and we baby you we change this
[1:25:15] Dappy do we give each pass see we've had
[1:25:19] him since we were kids a lot of they
[1:25:21] growed right up with us we feed it water
[1:25:24] it protected put sunscreen on it when
[1:25:27] we're outside in the summer days oh we
[1:25:29] love em we absolutely love that's why
[1:25:35] God won't help us until we get to a
[1:25:37] place that we realize these things are
[1:25:40] destroying us can have a few more hours
[1:25:51] minutes you just keep a little something
[1:25:58] in your mind and keep thinking that way
[1:26:00] now remember the mind is not converted
[1:26:05] the mind has got stickers all in it now
[1:26:10] remember a preacher to you years ago
[1:26:12] they're from things that happen in our
[1:26:14] life our brain is Bill's branches from
[1:26:17] the memory zones in the cells in our
[1:26:20] brain matter those are called dendrites
[1:26:24] it's like branches of a tree that begin
[1:26:27] to branch out now depending on how deep
[1:26:30] those dendrites are engulfed in your
[1:26:34] being
[1:26:34] whenever of the past memory whether
[1:26:37] painful or Pleasant will come to those
[1:26:40] Advan of the dendrites it will release
[1:26:43] endorphins it will release all types of
[1:26:46] different emotional things about you it
[1:26:48] will either make you smile or it will
[1:26:50] make you cringe with pain it will make
[1:26:53] you feel emotionally tore all to pieces
[1:26:55] because that dendrite in your mind you
[1:26:58] remember you see a certain thing an
[1:27:00] automatically takes you back to 20 years
[1:27:03] ago this certain certain thing happened
[1:27:05] where does that come from you wouldn't
[1:27:06] even think of about that but it runs
[1:27:08] into the dendrite of your brain it
[1:27:11] these systems of cortisol will cortisone
[1:27:14] whichever it is living under stress I
[1:27:16] was reading the other day for this
[1:27:17] talking about stress and that people
[1:27:20] that live under human beings were not
[1:27:22] made to live under the age that we're
[1:27:25] living friends do you realize we are
[1:27:27] under such stress every day of our life
[1:27:30] the rapture has got to be closed
[1:27:33] I judge that not just by Israel not just
[1:27:36] by communism but by the stress levels
[1:27:39] that's on the bride how much more can
[1:27:41] she take your body will release these
[1:27:52] things from your brain automatically it
[1:27:56] happens to you
[1:27:57] now here sends this brother way with the
[1:28:00] complex now listen how devastating these
[1:28:05] things can be oh my god go back and
[1:28:10] check about the scripture and see if
[1:28:11] it's right or not then you go from there
[1:28:13] yeah don't lose the feeling of the
[1:28:15] people must remember they're not made
[1:28:16] out of sawdust they're flashing by human
[1:28:19] beings with a soul pray for me all of
[1:28:21] you if you will
[1:28:24] then of course sister way starts
[1:28:27] screaming brother realm calms the people

[1:28:35] says her brother been quite enceladus
[1:28:37] goes down prays for him cause her
[1:28:40] brother way back from the dead actually
[1:28:44] what happened was by brother branham
[1:28:46] mentioning his name it made this complex
[1:28:51] make him so resentful because of what he
[1:28:54] said he died
[1:28:59] so his complex killed him physically
[1:29:06] thank God a prophet was there

[1:44:30] the new birth will issue forth the
[1:44:32] change to the body then the dirt will be

[1:49:18] could put them all on one end and we
[1:49:20] could compare it to the power of God the

[1:50:30] indo-aryan weak and tired and frustrated
[1:50:32] nervous and anxious Oh Lord God and

[1:51:21] but that which grows beyond the flesh
[1:51:23] and contaminates our walk that's what
[1:51:25] you're working on these sermons aren't
[1:51:28] to perfect the body they're to break the
[1:51:30] hold on the spiritual walk because that
[1:51:33] cocklebur wants to turn the inward and
[1:51:35] affect our peace affect our joy and rob
[1:51:39] us of what you've paid for help us then
[1:51:42] that Lord Jesus praise be to God praise

[1:51:50] from inferiorities we receive
[1:51:54] deliverance tonight from complexes we

[1:52:02] don't love us and I'm not welcome at the
[1:52:03] church and they don't need me no more we
[1:52:06] receive deliverance from that like we
[1:52:07] did smoking years ago and chewing and
[1:52:10] spitting and all kinds of stuff of the
[1:52:12] world because that kind of a devil is
[1:52:14] even more dangerous than a no smoking
[1:52:16] cigarette devil it's worse than a no
[1:52:18] chew and Apple tobacco devil it's worse
[1:52:20] than many of the ones who got delivered
[1:52:22] years ago because it's so deceiving it
[1:52:25] Couples itself with religiosity and it
[1:52:27] does a person come to church for years
[1:52:29] and set they're being hindered but Lord
[1:52:31] God we believe our time of deliverance
[1:52:33] is at an we believe father you want us
[1:52:36] to be what you've made us to be we may
[1:52:39] not be the brightest star in the
[1:52:40] universe but at least we are a star and
[1:52:43] we are in the universe and were made by
[1:52:46] the same God who made the brightest star
[1:52:48] so father we're not concerned about
[1:52:50] being the biggest or the brightest we
[1:52:52] just want to be what you made us to be
[1:52:54] Lord God help us I pray father to have a
[1:52:57] new understanding and they be able to
[1:52:59] hear the word of God not through fears
[1:53:01] and inferiority and complexes we're not
[1:53:04] coming roar to worship under complexes
[1:53:07] and pray and their complexes that
[1:53:09] identify herself under complexes but we
[1:53:12] want to be identified under the new man
[1:53:14] under the new race under the new birth
[1:53:17] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:19] we're gonna preach under the influence
[1:53:21] of the new man we're gonna live under

[1:53:42] everybody branham's or everybody's
[1:53:43] Smiths but to try to lead them to Christ

[1:55:24] the women's side from the men's side and
[1:55:26] the women are not allowed to come over

[1:55:30] there as a Gentile I had to take the
[1:55:32] little skullcap every man that comes
[1:55:34] their house - so you stand there and you
[1:55:36] pray because the women are not allowed
[1:55:38] to come on the same side
[1:55:39] so they got a little bitty old tiny
[1:55:40] portion and the man's got a great old
[1:55:42] big gigantic portion but it's priests
[1:55:45] and daughters of God tonight you Stan
