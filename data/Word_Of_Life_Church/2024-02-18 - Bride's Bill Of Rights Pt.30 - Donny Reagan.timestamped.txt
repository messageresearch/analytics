[40:42] shout of our king of our great
[40:47] king the tokens been
[40:50] appli he's cleaning from

[41:17] Lord
[41:19] hallelujah praise the Lord what a
[41:22] privilege for us to be gathered together
[41:25] here again today in the presence of God
[41:28] let's turn to Acts chapter 2 if you
[41:31] would verse
[41:33] one certainly appreciate blessings of
[41:36] the Lord each of you that are here with
[41:38] us today different visitors that are
[41:40] here with us from Brother Benton's day
[41:43] yesterday of Celebration we're so happy
[41:45] for our brother God God's giv him these
[41:48] years of life and years to be able to
[41:50] serve
[41:52] him Acts chapter 2 verse one I've been
[41:56] speak speaking to you for a bit on the
[41:59] bride's Bill of Rights and today I'd
[42:01] like
[42:02] to start off at least with the right to
[42:07] have one
[42:09] mind now you can really know that I
[42:12] Believe In Miracles if I believe that
[42:14] the bride's ever going to have one
[42:16] mind but I do believe that because it's
[42:19] God's
[42:20] word acts chap 2 verse
[42:24] 1 and when the day of Pentecost was
[42:27] fully
[42:29] come they were all with one
[42:33] Accord in one
[42:35] place now let me read to you the meaning
[42:38] of this
[42:39] word the Greek word is home us o madon
[42:45] home us o madon and it means with one
[42:49] Accord with one mind with one
[42:54] passion now listen that was with one
[42:56] Accord one mind and one passion the
[43:00] unique Greek word used 10 of its 12
[43:03] times in the New Testament occurrences
[43:07] in the book of Acts now listen to this
[43:11] further explanation of what it really
[43:13] means it's a compound of two words
[43:16] meaning to rush along and in unison to
[43:23] rush
[43:24] along and in in unison the image is
[43:29] musical a number of notes sounded which
[43:34] while different harmonize in pitch and
[43:39] tone so I'd like for brother Larry to
[43:41] demonstrate to us what some people have
[43:44] in their minds about themsel and the
[43:48] body and going to church and all of that
[43:52] so brother Larry is going to play for us
[43:55] one note
[43:57] for a few bars of
[44:00] [Music]
[44:14] music now that's the way some people
[44:16] want to serve the
[44:17] Lord now you've got all those keys on
[44:21] their piano all those strings the
[44:24] Beautiful music it can make
[44:26] and some people want to be a single
[44:31] note now brother Larry take both hands
[44:35] and spread out at least six
[44:38] fingers and put those notes together and
[44:42] make a chord I want you to listen to
[44:44] what the meaning of it is the image is
[44:46] musical a number of notes a number of
[44:49] notes are sounded which while different
[44:53] harmonize and pitch and tone now play it
[44:58] for
[44:58] [Music]
[45:02] us
[45:05] ah go
[45:07] [Music]
[45:07] [Applause]
[45:18] [Applause]
[45:24] ahead
[45:30] I want him preach we just let him play
[45:31] that for
[45:33] us now maybe it's just me I don't know
[45:38] but to me the latter one somewhat sounds
[45:41] so much more beautiful so much more
[45:45] full now they were the same notes and
[45:48] different pitch but they're harmonizing
[45:51] together so what does it take all them
[45:53] different fingers to make that that
[45:57] possible notice again in Acts chap 2
[45:59] verse 2 and suddenly there came a sound
[46:01] from Heaven of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[46:06] it filled all the house where they were
[46:07] sitting and there appeared unto them
[46:09] clothing tongues like as a fire as it
[46:12] set upon each of them and they were all
[46:15] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[46:18] speak oh my goodness must have been
[46:20] Pentecostals wasn't it and they begin to
[46:22] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[46:26] gave them utterance Now read with me
[46:29] also in Romans 12:
[46:32] 16 be of the same mind one toward
[46:37] another mind not high things but condem
[46:41] sin to Men of low
[46:45] estate be not
[46:47] wise in your own
[46:50] conceits Romans
[46:52] 15:5 now the god of patience and
[46:55] consolation ation Grant you to be
[46:59] likeminded one toward another according
[47:04] to Christ Jesus that you may be with one
[47:09] mind and one
[47:12] mouth now even though it's two different
[47:14] English words Accord and mind but it's
[47:17] exact same Greek word here that Paul is
[47:20] telling the Saints in Rome in Rome to be
[47:23] able to have that they would have one
[47:25] mind mind or be in one
[47:28] Accord and we'd let to be remembered
[47:30] today as we pray me too Lord Jesus as we
[47:34] have assembled here
[47:36] today Father we heard just a bit ago
[47:39] that sister Judy Dy had crossed over and
[47:43] brother Lloyd walls had requested prayer
[47:46] for a sister from their church and she
[47:49] had also passed this morning so while we
[47:52] were preparing to get ready to come to
[47:55] church to more of your children crossed
[47:58] over into that land beyond the
[48:00] river father we know that's what we're
[48:03] all headed toward and we believe that
[48:06] you've sent us a message in the last
[48:08] days that would help us to be ready for
[48:11] that hour we're asking today for your
[48:13] Divine help help me Jesus to get out of
[48:17] the way father speak through these lips
[48:19] of clay if there's anything of Eternal
[48:22] value that will come out of this service
[48:24] today it will certainly have to be you
[48:26] that does it so we commit this commit
[48:29] the speaker and the hearers everyone
[48:32] visible and invisible Lord together into
[48:34] your great hands have your way in this
[48:37] service in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[48:40] ask you amen God bless you you may be
[48:50] seated I'm sure for most of you it is
[48:52] the same as it is with me it's hard to
[48:55] imagine
[48:56] living in a world that was a
[48:59] paradise to where everything was in
[49:03] complete
[49:04] Harmony there was no
[49:06] dissension no division no one arguing
[49:11] fussing debating over difference of
[49:13] opinions and there was no difference at
[49:17] all in the sense of controversial
[49:20] difference such a Harmony that was
[49:24] existing in the Gard Garden of Eden and
[49:27] yet we don't know exactly how long that
[49:29] it
[49:30] lasted but we are certain of this it
[49:34] will be restored again and it will last
[49:38] forever but since that that fall of what
[49:42] man forfeited for all of us in the
[49:44] Garden of Eden we are striving to have a
[49:49] real Oneness
[49:51] back and God of course first established
[49:54] a Oneness
[49:56] in the hearts of his people by his death
[49:58] on Calvary that would be able to bring
[50:02] back in us the divine nature that we had
[50:05] lost in the Garden of Eden when we were
[50:08] at one time one with God so man was one
[50:12] with God he was one with his wife he was
[50:15] one with nature he was one with all the
[50:18] creation everything existed in a a
[50:21] beautiful wonderful Harmony but since
[50:24] then man has struggled Nations have
[50:28] struggled and are struggling today our
[50:31] nation is probably more divided today
[50:34] than it has been in many many years it's
[50:37] divided politically it's divided
[50:40] racially it's divided culturally anybody
[50:43] even know what the word means on our
[50:46] money ausum anybody know what that means
[50:48] in Latin airus
[50:50] Blum one of many so with many coming
[50:54] together different cultures different
[50:56] races we would blend together to be one
[51:00] nationality as far as Americans but yet
[51:03] in reality our nation is so far away
[51:06] from even what's written on our currency
[51:08] every day that we handle out and we buy
[51:11] this and that and the other many don't
[51:13] even what it means as far as on the bill
[51:15] itself and they certainly don't know
[51:17] what it means as far as principle that
[51:19] we would be able to have one nation
[51:22] under God which is the problem because
[51:24] when America turned God away we lost all
[51:28] hopes of ever having a true Unity anyway
[51:31] is that right and then we know that
[51:34] Satan doesn't just want to do that um
[51:36] nationally but he wants to do it in the
[51:39] church and we will have to say that he's
[51:42] been able to accomplish exactly what he
[51:44] set out to do but we know also that God
[51:48] had purpose to be able to have a
[51:50] restored unity in the hearts of his
[51:53] people it may seem to us that we are a
[51:56] million miles from True Unity because
[52:00] even inside of our own ranks of and and
[52:03] let's just look at Christianity in a
[52:05] global thing we look at it and we see
[52:08] that Christianity as a whole it's so
[52:10] divided so many different denominations
[52:13] so many different views so many
[52:16] different uh schools of Theology and so
[52:19] many that well if you don't believe the
[52:21] way we do you're not right you're not
[52:22] going and this denomination they're the
[52:24] only ones going the other denomination
[52:26] they're the only ones going and then we
[52:28] bring it on down a little closer to us
[52:31] and we realize that very same divisive
[52:34] Spirit has got in our own ranks as well
[52:38] and we know it started out to where that
[52:40] on the day of Pentecost they were
[52:42] waiting and waiting and the Bible says
[52:44] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[52:46] I remember Pentecost did not begin in
[52:50] Acts 2 the word actually means an end
[52:53] Gathering or it was a FES Festival of
[52:56] the Harvest and it had been something
[52:58] that they had celebrated for years and
[53:00] years but it just so happened that God
[53:03] chose to send the Holy Ghost on the day
[53:06] of Pentecost so whenever the spirit of
[53:09] God began to move and they were there
[53:11] waiting and praying and waiting and
[53:13] praying and the prophet dramatizes it a
[53:16] little bit for us and said they were
[53:17] saying well you know what I believe
[53:19] we've already got it another one said no
[53:21] no we've got to do this and that another
[53:23] one said no we got to do this but he
[53:24] said Peter stood up and said now
[53:27] Brothers the word has got something to
[53:29] say about this that Jesus told us it
[53:32] would come on a certain day so they had
[53:35] to wait and wait the concept that I grew
[53:38] up in as a Pentecostal that you had to
[53:41] te and you had to wait for the Holy
[53:43] Ghost totally wrong of course according
[53:45] to the Scripture it wasn't that they had
[53:47] to wait for the spirit of God to come as
[53:50] far as well you know you just beat on
[53:52] the Altar and beat on the altar but
[53:54] there was a certain day of arrival
[53:58] because it was timed according to the
[54:00] way that the Pascal lamb was offered and
[54:02] then there would be so many days to
[54:04] another Feast which is the Feast of the
[54:06] end Gathering or the Feast of Pentecost
[54:09] but we do not have to T in the day we're
[54:12] living for a certain day for 10 days 14
[54:15] days is that right whenever we can get
[54:17] out of the way and die that's when God
[54:20] wants to give us the Holy Ghost but it
[54:23] was actually set to come on this certain
[54:26] day and they must have had difference of
[54:28] opinions because to be honest let's give
[54:30] them the benefit of the doubt the Lord
[54:32] Jesus had slowly begun to unveil what
[54:35] the spirit of truth would be but he
[54:37] still didn't explain to them what the
[54:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost would be like
[54:43] John said there's one among you and he
[54:45] said I'm not even worried to unloose
[54:47] your shoes I baptize you with water but
[54:49] he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[54:52] and with fire but he still didn't go
[54:54] into any detail
[54:55] what does that mean exactly John John
[54:58] might not have known himself since he
[55:00] got it before he was ever born so he
[55:02] wasn't even conscious of it so to
[55:05] explain the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:07] I've not found no scriptures in the four
[55:09] gospels where it actually said well
[55:12] it'll be this way and that way and that
[55:14] way it's just like he said it's coming
[55:16] be ready be open and whenever it gets
[55:19] there you'll know you've got it so they
[55:21] really didn't know what to look for they
[55:23] didn't know if it would be an outburst
[55:25] of Joy now the Bible did not tell them
[55:28] it was going to be a Russian Mighty Wind
[55:30] Jesus never told them that y'all are
[55:32] going to be sitting in one place and the
[55:34] wind will come down but he said just go
[55:36] Terry in Jerusalem until you be a dude
[55:39] with power from on high so no doubt it
[55:43] took them a little bit of time because a
[55:46] lot of the men that were there were
[55:48] preachers and natur the more preachers
[55:50] you get together the more different
[55:52] confusion you can have sometimes and the
[55:55] more difference of opinion that you can
[55:57] have not always but yet we're all made
[55:59] different and and when you once you look
[56:01] at the diversity of God God did remain
[56:03] ever even one one of his preachers that
[56:06] that'd always be exactly the same but
[56:09] there is a Oneness that I believe before
[56:12] we leave this world in a Rapture every
[56:15] member of the bride of Christ will have
[56:18] now does that mean every one of us will
[56:21] start saying the exact same thing and
[56:24] we'll all worship with the exact same
[56:26] element of of of emotion and all that no
[56:29] I do not believe that for one minute I
[56:32] don't believe we can prove that by the
[56:33] Bible but I do believe we can all have
[56:36] one passion and we can ultimately have
[56:39] one desire and that desired is to be
[56:42] ready and to get every member whose name
[56:44] is on that book of life into the economy
[56:47] of God is that right and will we have
[56:50] other interests of course we will will
[56:52] we have even other Passions we will but
[56:56] they will not be the majority of the
[56:58] drive that's in our soul some of you are
[57:01] business people and you will always be
[57:03] thinking about different ways to do this
[57:05] or that the musicians we have in our
[57:08] church and the songs that the singers
[57:10] sing they will always be listening for
[57:12] new songs and they'll be finding new
[57:15] progressions and the chords and the
[57:16] brothers will be practicing this and
[57:19] that that's just something about human
[57:20] beings and will we ever be always be the
[57:23] same in that sense never but I believe
[57:26] with all of my heart God will have a
[57:28] people on this Earth around the world
[57:32] that will have the same drive the same
[57:34] goals the same passion the same baptism
[57:38] of the Holy Ghost they're not interested
[57:41] in building any man's Kingdom they're
[57:44] not interested in making this one
[57:46] preacher the great big guy Among Us and
[57:49] everybody else is nobody nope I don't
[57:51] believe we'll ever get to that spot but
[57:53] we will be at that spot to where we know
[57:56] that there is one great big one Among Us
[57:59] and his name is the Lord Jesus it's not
[58:03] any other preacher it's not any other
[58:05] man you believe that as
[58:07] well now Paul knew he was not there of
[58:11] course on the day of Pentecost but Paul
[58:13] knew and no doubt he had been told about
[58:16] it from the different Brethren and once
[58:18] he had his own experience with God he
[58:21] had experienced a Oneness now remember
[58:24] he was totally different than the rest
[58:26] of all the brothers his experience was a
[58:30] little bit different the Bible doesn't
[58:31] say that whenever Paul met him on the
[58:34] way to Damascus that there was a rushing
[58:36] Mighty Wind so the rushing Mighty Wind
[58:39] is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[58:41] but a changed life is a life that
[58:44] follows the word so there was no rushing
[58:46] Mighty Wind in any of the other
[58:48] instances that I found in the book of
[58:51] Acts yet there was tongues there was
[58:53] prophecy and there was different things
[58:55] like that so God never chose the wind to
[58:58] be the definite evidence of the Holy
[59:00] Ghost he never chose shouting to be the
[59:04] definite evidence he never chose running
[59:07] and yet we believe in all of those
[59:08] things but we know that God dealt with
[59:11] his people in such a way that it must
[59:14] have changed them where they all found
[59:16] them themselves wanting some of the same
[59:19] things about the kingdom of God and it
[59:23] must have been totally overwhelming when
[59:26] Satan saw what God did because he had
[59:29] been among the 12 the disciples and he
[59:32] had heard them arguing which one is
[59:35] going to be the greatest now which one
[59:37] of us is going to be able to sit on your
[59:39] right hand side and which one's on your
[59:41] left and which one's the second you know
[59:44] down and the third down he had heard
[59:46] them arguing and debating about that and
[59:48] got among them and anointed them of
[59:50] course and whenever he saw that
[59:53] disappear from among them same men that
[59:56] had it before he must have been in total
[59:59] bewilderment trying to understand what
[1:00:01] in the world happened to them are not
[1:00:04] these the same guys that was arguing
[1:00:07] about who have the biggest Ministry and
[1:00:10] who have the most that streamed them on
[1:00:12] YouTube that's the way we'd say it today
[1:00:14] and how many have the devot the most
[1:00:17] followers and how many countries will
[1:00:19] stream your services versus how many
[1:00:22] stream ours well when you hear that kind
[1:00:24] of talk you know you're listening to in
[1:00:26] and need the Holy Ghost I don't care if
[1:00:28] they've been preaching for 75 years once
[1:00:31] we get the true mind of Christ we
[1:00:33] realize it's not how big we are it's not
[1:00:36] how big our church is it's not how many
[1:00:39] people that we reach it's about us all
[1:00:42] getting together and we can single out
[1:00:44] that one note if we want to or we can
[1:00:47] put all of it together and play chords
[1:00:51] and let it be a beautiful harmonious
[1:00:54] orch minist that God himself ordained
[1:00:57] before the foundation of the world it
[1:01:00] must have been beautiful when the first
[1:01:02] church started out was such a thing and
[1:01:04] they found themselves in such
[1:01:07] commonality that what they did was the
[1:01:09] rich so what they had and they just had
[1:01:11] a common purse and they begin to delve
[1:01:14] It Out Among the people it must have
[1:01:16] been beautiful but you know what Satan
[1:01:18] saw that and he decided there ain't no
[1:01:20] way I'm going to let this go so he
[1:01:22] started bringing in division and started
[1:01:25] out maybe in a very small way but we see
[1:01:27] by the time it rolls on down into the
[1:01:29] Third Church age that they had so
[1:01:32] divided and split among themselves I
[1:01:35] find the same thing among us today I say
[1:01:38] it I with sadness in my heart but yet I
[1:01:41] really believe in spite of all of that
[1:01:44] that God is going to bring the real
[1:01:46] bride of Christ back to that true
[1:01:49] Oneness that fell on the day of
[1:01:51] Pentecost itself to where there were
[1:01:54] would be preachers all over the Earth
[1:01:56] and this would be the miraculous part
[1:01:58] about it many of them will not even know
[1:02:01] each other and that will be a wonderful
[1:02:03] thing but what will even be greater than
[1:02:05] that is some of them will know each
[1:02:07] other and they will know how they
[1:02:09] disagree with each other and they still
[1:02:11] will have one common goal now that is a
[1:02:14] miracle because they know well I differ
[1:02:17] with brother so and so on this and I
[1:02:19] differ with that but in reality when we
[1:02:21] all sit down and if we've all got the
[1:02:24] whole Holy Ghost and we've all got one
[1:02:26] passion and one desire and one main goal
[1:02:29] and one main achievement don't we really
[1:02:31] agree on more than we disagree on now we
[1:02:35] might shout a different way and some
[1:02:37] might do this and some's music you know
[1:02:40] they might just play all the old hymns
[1:02:42] and they don't want no new stuff and
[1:02:44] there'll always be those things among us
[1:02:47] but in reality whenever we sit down and
[1:02:50] I love to have fellowship with Brethren
[1:02:53] to when you can go to talking about the
[1:02:55] good things of God and you'll you know
[1:02:57] one will pull out a little quote and
[1:02:58] he's got a little agenda behind that and
[1:03:01] another one will pull out a little quote
[1:03:03] and he's got a little point he's trying
[1:03:05] to make and you know whenever you
[1:03:06] realize well they don't want to go that
[1:03:08] way they don't want to go on this
[1:03:10] agender that narrative and you get right
[1:03:12] back to the mainstream it's absolutely
[1:03:15] awesome let me say that about you visors
[1:03:18] you pardon me for a moment but our
[1:03:20] church here I wonder what God could do
[1:03:23] among us if we ourselves as Word of Life
[1:03:26] if we would hone down and focus on
[1:03:29] really what matters in life and when it
[1:03:32] comes right down to it it's not how many
[1:03:34] cars you've got how many trucks you've
[1:03:35] got how much money you've got how much
[1:03:37] money you're going to leave for your
[1:03:39] kids to fuss about when you're gone but
[1:03:41] it's actually going to amount to our
[1:03:43] calling God and what God ordained us to
[1:03:46] do and what God ordained us to be and US
[1:03:49] letting our light shine I wonder if we
[1:03:51] wouldn't find that we're in more
[1:03:53] agreement M than what we actually
[1:03:56] disagree on I wonder if everyone who
[1:03:59] claims this church to be your home
[1:04:00] church if we could leave this place
[1:04:03] today and desire to have one mind cuz
[1:04:06] this is your right now it's up to you
[1:04:09] whether or not you get it it's up to me
[1:04:11] whether or not I get it and I've done
[1:04:13] found out you know many many years ago
[1:04:15] in order to have one mind you're going
[1:04:17] to have to give up some things you're
[1:04:20] actually going to have to relinquish
[1:04:22] some things that might be what you think
[1:04:25] is a value but when you look at the True
[1:04:28] Value and you let the True Value
[1:04:31] outweigh the others many of you have
[1:04:33] heard me tell it and I tell it sometimes
[1:04:35] when every mid car will be out and we
[1:04:37] have six granddaughters as as most of
[1:04:39] you'all know three sets of twins so we
[1:04:41] bought lots of girls clothes and we'
[1:04:43] bought lots of girls little tits and
[1:04:46] lots of girls this and that and the
[1:04:47] other so years ago we was at TJ Maxx and
[1:04:50] this woman kept seeing us come in there
[1:04:52] buying two of this and two of that to is
[1:04:54] something else so she asked me the
[1:04:56] question one day don't you ever get
[1:05:00] anything so I said Well ma'am actually
[1:05:02] when we got married how many ever years
[1:05:04] ago it was then that I told her that
[1:05:06] it's been 50 now it'll be 51 in July and
[1:05:09] I told her you know whenever we got
[1:05:12] married say 40 45 years ago whatever it
[1:05:14] was we decided that everything was going
[1:05:17] to be 5050 $50 for her 50 cents for
[1:05:23] me I'm surprised your sisters didn't say
[1:05:26] amen and your brothers hoping and
[1:05:28] praying to God they don't right but
[1:05:30] whenever you look at it and you realize
[1:05:32] even in your home now those of you that
[1:05:34] are married and you know that peace is a
[1:05:36] wonderful thing but to be able to attain
[1:05:39] peace in your home you're going to have
[1:05:41] to give up some things and there may be
[1:05:43] days that you're actually right in your
[1:05:46] side of the argument but then you go to
[1:05:49] way being right versus losing three days
[1:05:53] of peace in your your
[1:05:55] home now you single folks will catch
[1:05:58] this by and by when the morning comes
[1:06:00] and when you wake up and realize you got
[1:06:02] married you realize what I'm talking
[1:06:04] about today you're looking at me funny
[1:06:06] but all these married folks have got
[1:06:08] that little smirky grin because they've
[1:06:10] done been there and done that and you
[1:06:12] realize peace is a great thing and it's
[1:06:15] the same way when it comes to us as the
[1:06:18] family of God but many people that it's
[1:06:21] not peace that matters it's their own
[1:06:23] way and they're right and it don't make
[1:06:26] no difference what they've got to do to
[1:06:28] hold on to it they're going to hold on
[1:06:30] to it I person feel sorry for people
[1:06:32] like that because they will never have
[1:06:35] very much of what God wants them to have
[1:06:38] because it's all self centered it's
[1:06:40] about me and Mine and Ours and our
[1:06:44] church and our family and what I believe
[1:06:46] and what I but you know what when you
[1:06:49] look at it according to the word you
[1:06:51] realize one mind is only achievable
[1:06:54] when we can all have one father one
[1:06:57] nature and one birth now I'm the oldest
[1:07:00] of seven kids all my siblings are
[1:07:03] totally different from me Carol is the
[1:07:05] oldest of eight all of her siblings are
[1:07:08] totally different from her and it's the
[1:07:11] same way in the family of God that we
[1:07:13] said here today and we come from
[1:07:16] different colors different racial
[1:07:17] backgrounds different cultural
[1:07:19] backgrounds and we have things that have
[1:07:21] molded us and made us to what we are
[1:07:24] some of us are more emotional than
[1:07:26] others some of you cry a lot some of you
[1:07:28] shout a lot some of you pout a lot well
[1:07:31] Glory some of you don't make a whole lot
[1:07:33] of emotion in church but you give all
[1:07:35] your emotion to volleyball and
[1:07:37] basketball and baseball I don't
[1:07:40] understand that kind of experience
[1:07:41] myself my God Is Bigger Than a piece of
[1:07:44] pig skin kicked around at a 50 yard line
[1:07:47] my God Is Bigger Than Michael Jackson or
[1:07:50] some other star out there dribbling down
[1:07:52] the court my God is a resurrection and a
[1:07:55] life and I've always wanted to praise
[1:07:57] him and serve him but I've come to
[1:07:59] realize God don't want me to make people
[1:08:02] that will be like me God wants me to
[1:08:05] help mold into them what he wants them
[1:08:09] to be not what I think they should be
[1:08:12] somebody say amen and you see one of the
[1:08:14] worst mistakes we make is whenever we
[1:08:16] get this image in our mind of this one
[1:08:19] particular person or that's the perfect
[1:08:21] Christian right there and then we go to
[1:08:23] trying to make everybody else just like
[1:08:25] them well God does not agree with that
[1:08:28] concept now let's go on if you would
[1:08:31] whenever Paul went to 1 Corinthians chap
[1:08:34] 1: 10 and he said now I beseech you
[1:08:37] Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:08:40] Christ that you all speak the same
[1:08:45] thing wow Paul believed in Miracles
[1:08:49] too that you all speak the same thing
[1:08:53] now this this is our
[1:08:55] right this is our
[1:08:58] right that you all speak the same thing
[1:09:01] and that there
[1:09:04] be no divisions among you but that you
[1:09:09] be perfectly joined together in the same
[1:09:13] mind now again same English word but
[1:09:17] certainly not the same Greek word so
[1:09:19] this again is newos which is
[1:09:22] understanding the high powers of the
[1:09:25] soul the faculty of perceiving divine
[1:09:29] things this is the only way this will
[1:09:32] ever be attainable is for every true
[1:09:36] Born Again Holy Ghost filled child of
[1:09:39] God to have the same newos well whose
[1:09:42] newos will it be it won't be mine and it
[1:09:46] won't be yours it'll have to be the mind
[1:09:48] of God so then God projects in us his
[1:09:53] own mind mind which is his own will now
[1:09:56] you remember when the spirit of God
[1:09:57] spoke to the prophet and he said pick up
[1:09:59] your pen and write and he said here is
[1:10:02] the secret that the bride has the word
[1:10:05] but she has the mind of Christ to know
[1:10:08] what he wants done with the word so we
[1:10:11] could all have the word and yet have
[1:10:13] hundreds of different opinions on what
[1:10:16] God done wants done with his word we do
[1:10:18] that's why we have such divisions Among
[1:10:21] Us so some would pick out certain quotes
[1:10:23] and they would say well this is the
[1:10:25] emphasis right here this is the bride's
[1:10:28] Revival and boy we've had so many
[1:10:30] so-called bride revivals and so they
[1:10:32] begin to focus on this Gathering of
[1:10:34] quotes and they say this is it right
[1:10:36] here oh everybody around the world this
[1:10:38] is what we all rally around and you see
[1:10:41] most of them wind up where they started
[1:10:43] following a man CU every one of them
[1:10:46] started with some man's idea and then
[1:10:49] they wind up gathering around a man then
[1:10:51] that man will have to go out to promote
[1:10:53] this idea and then churches will start
[1:10:56] following him and in time you'll find
[1:10:58] the exact same cycle that it's always
[1:11:00] been it dwindles down and it blows away
[1:11:04] and then you find them looking for
[1:11:05] another man well I don't know about you
[1:11:08] I found the man that I have been looking
[1:11:10] for a long time ago I thank God for
[1:11:13] every man of God but I'm not looking for
[1:11:15] any man to bring me a Revival in his
[1:11:17] briefcase I'm not looking I'm I don't
[1:11:19] know about you folks I'm not waiting to
[1:11:21] our special meeting in the last week of
[1:11:23] June to be able to have a good time I'm
[1:11:26] here today you're here today God's here
[1:11:28] today I say we have church I say we have
[1:11:32] church believe it or not it's a special
[1:11:34] meeting right here today because God has
[1:11:37] gathered here with the saints of God in
[1:11:39] the house of God and if we could bring
[1:11:42] our mind together in one Accord I wonder
[1:11:45] what God would do as a matter of fact I
[1:11:48] found it and studying this that the
[1:11:50] prophet said if everybody in this place
[1:11:52] would come together together in one mind
[1:11:54] and one Accord in five minutes time
[1:11:57] there would not be one sick person left
[1:12:00] Among Us in five minutes time and we're
[1:12:03] waiting on God and God is waiting on us
[1:12:07] but if Satan can sideline us and get us
[1:12:10] on a little agenda to where we begin to
[1:12:12] wait to hear the preacher with our
[1:12:14] certain cliches and our certain magic
[1:12:17] words you know what I'm talking about
[1:12:19] and we're waiting and we'll see what
[1:12:21] quotes that he reads and if he goes to
[1:12:22] say an Irish certain words then we know
[1:12:25] he's on board with us well what you mean
[1:12:27] is he's on board with your idea and then
[1:12:30] I wonder how much that we all so miss
[1:12:32] the moving of the Holy Ghost and people
[1:12:35] come in Bound and leave bound they come
[1:12:37] in sick and they leave sick they come in
[1:12:40] miserable and leave more miserable I
[1:12:43] don't think that's what God has in mind
[1:12:45] for church can anybody say amen I
[1:12:48] believe the Lord Jesus is here to heal
[1:12:51] the sick today I believe is here to fill
[1:12:54] with the Holy Ghost and if you're lost I
[1:12:56] believe he's here to save you right here
[1:12:58] today you can walk out of this place a
[1:13:01] brand new man or a new woman if we can
[1:13:05] come together in one mind and one
[1:13:09] accord or you can sit there in your
[1:13:11] chair and just plink on your little
[1:13:14] notes and you can go on and on over and
[1:13:17] over again or you can be able to get
[1:13:20] together with this one and with that one
[1:13:22] and with that one and with that one and
[1:13:24] with that one and with that one and
[1:13:26] depending on how long your fingers are
[1:13:28] you might be able to even go beyond six
[1:13:30] and then if you put them together with
[1:13:32] another and another and another what
[1:13:35] could God do I'll tell you what he's
[1:13:37] fixing to do he's fixing to raise the
[1:13:39] dead he's fixing to bring back limbs
[1:13:42] that have been missing these ain't my
[1:13:45] words before the bride goes home in a
[1:13:47] Rapture I believe that short quick work
[1:13:50] will be and there will be people who's
[1:13:52] got armed arms that are gone that will
[1:13:55] be recreated again don't you understand
[1:13:57] what that is it's a forerunner of the
[1:14:01] Resurrection Hallelujah there may be
[1:14:03] people that's bound with diabetes for
[1:14:06] years and somebody that's missing an eye
[1:14:09] and if God could get us together not
[1:14:11] following this man not following that
[1:14:14] man following this one up here we love
[1:14:17] one another we're striving together for
[1:14:19] one common cause let God be the
[1:14:22] preeminent one let us get out of the way
[1:14:25] let us get out of the picture and let's
[1:14:28] see what he will do Among
[1:14:34] Us oh
[1:14:36] my that you be
[1:14:39] perfectly joined together you know Paul
[1:14:42] was such a diverse man and very very
[1:14:45] educated man he would use examples of
[1:14:49] warfare and he would use examples in so
[1:14:52] many ways and these these words right
[1:14:54] here he's using examples of actually
[1:14:57] building and he's using the example of a
[1:14:59] man that would tank and the way they
[1:15:01] would do it in their day and join boards
[1:15:05] together and they would take a Tenon and
[1:15:07] they would put it together so he was
[1:15:09] laying it out that that's exactly what
[1:15:11] God wants that we would be perfectly
[1:15:13] joined together now you can't see it of
[1:15:16] course but this pull pit made by one of
[1:15:18] the brothers here in the church and
[1:15:20] here's one board here's another here's
[1:15:21] another here's another here's another
[1:15:23] and they're all put together joined
[1:15:26] perfectly together yet I run my hand
[1:15:28] across it and I don't feel one board and
[1:15:31] another board and another board because
[1:15:33] they were joined together then run
[1:15:35] through a planer and they make one
[1:15:37] beautiful image oh when God can get us
[1:15:41] out of the way and our own little petty
[1:15:43] ideas of this and that and the other and
[1:15:46] join with this brother and that sister
[1:15:49] and this brother and that sister and God
[1:15:51] run us through the Divide machine look
[1:15:54] out devil here we come you talking about
[1:15:57] a church that will stand in the last day
[1:16:00] and then we will be able to say I and my
[1:16:04] father are one not only will we say that
[1:16:07] but we will say I and my brother are one
[1:16:11] oh yes we disagree we may not agree on
[1:16:14] this little point and that little point
[1:16:16] but God is going to have a people
[1:16:19] together on the earth before the Rapture
[1:16:21] time who will be in one objective and
[1:16:24] one passion and one main desire of their
[1:16:28] life and what's that for to fulfill the
[1:16:31] word of God for our age I don't want to
[1:16:34] just quote the Bible I don't want to
[1:16:36] just quote the message I want to be the
[1:16:39] Bible I want to be an expression of
[1:16:43] God's
[1:16:46] word oh
[1:16:49] my notice that you be perfectly joined
[1:16:52] together other in the same
[1:16:56] mind recognizing goodness and hating
[1:16:59] evil the power of considering and
[1:17:01] judging soberly calmly and
[1:17:05] impartially that you be of the same mind
[1:17:08] in the same
[1:17:10] judgment 2 Corinthians 13:11 finally
[1:17:14] Brethren farewell be perfect be of good
[1:17:22] comfort be of how many
[1:17:26] Minds
[1:17:28] one
[1:17:30] mind same English word but here a
[1:17:33] different Greek word as well
[1:17:36] fro to have an opinion of on self to
[1:17:41] think of oneself to be
[1:17:44] modest not let one's opinion though
[1:17:48] just of himself exceed the bounds
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:54] of
[1:17:56] modesty
[1:17:58] wow so when Paul is telling them to have
[1:18:01] one mind this man's speaking about
[1:18:04] several diverse things isn't he so
[1:18:07] you've got to think the same thing of
[1:18:09] the cause of God and the purpose of God
[1:18:12] and then you have to look at yourself
[1:18:14] and not think boy I'm something man I'll
[1:18:17] tell you what I'm boy can I sing woo boy
[1:18:21] I can sing but boy I can play the guitar
[1:18:24] boy I can play that organ boy I'll tell
[1:18:27] you one thing am I a preacher or
[1:18:31] what you see a person who has that mind
[1:18:34] of themsel will never truly be able to
[1:18:37] be one with other people unless those
[1:18:39] other people are constantly flattering
[1:18:44] him oh Jesus you're going to get me in
[1:18:46] trouble now sir notice in Philippians 1:
[1:18:50] 27 only let your conversation be as it
[1:18:54] becometh the gospel of Christ so whether
[1:18:56] I come and see you or else be absent
[1:18:59] that I may hear of your Affairs that you
[1:19:03] stand fast in one spirit with one
[1:19:09] mind striving together for the Fai of
[1:19:14] the Gospel one Spirit one mind stve
[1:19:18] together now we say that we have been
[1:19:20] restored to the fa
[1:19:23] of the original Apostolic
[1:19:27] fathers have
[1:19:30] we we have one striving one
[1:19:36] face Philippians 2:2 fulfill you my joy
[1:19:41] that you be
[1:19:44] likeminded having the same love being of

[1:19:49] Accord of one mind let nothing be done
[1:19:54] through
[1:19:56] Strife
[1:19:58] contention
[1:20:00] electioneering or intriguing for office
[1:20:03] oh wow so you mean
[1:20:06] politics is in the
[1:20:09] church so there were actually
[1:20:12] politicians in the first church
[1:20:14] age and they were
[1:20:18] electioneering for positions in the
[1:20:21] church
[1:20:23] oh
[1:20:26] Jesus so don't let anything be done in
[1:20:30] Strife electioneering or intriguing for
[1:20:33] office a desire to put oneself forward a
[1:20:37] partisan and fractu spirit which does
[1:20:41] not disdain low
[1:20:44] arts in other words they will go to
[1:20:46] whatever means
[1:20:48] possible to get a
[1:20:51] position no wonder the prophet said
[1:20:54] politics is of the devil well let me

[1:22:10] courteous 1 Peter 4:1 for as much then
[1:22:14] as Christ hath suffered for us in the
[1:22:17] flesh arm yourselves likewise with the
[1:22:21] same mind
[1:22:23] for he that hath suffered In the Flesh
[1:22:27] hath
[1:22:28] ceased from
[1:22:31] sin now let's turn in Psalm 133
[1:22:36] ver1 same train of salt but a different
[1:22:39] word now Unity how many believes we need
[1:22:43] Unity if we ever had it before now I
[1:22:46] know you know it friends but Satan is
[1:22:48] trying his best to come among the people
[1:22:50] of God like never before not only in the
[1:22:52] church family but in between husbands
[1:22:55] and wives in between parents and
[1:22:58] children in between the youth Satan is
[1:23:01] trying to divide among our ranks to
[1:23:04] where certain youth youth leaders are
[1:23:07] projecting certain things and other
[1:23:09] church leaders are saying no we're not
[1:23:11] sending our youth to them meetings no
[1:23:13] more if they're going that way don't you
[1:23:16] see who the author of all of that is
[1:23:18] it's the devil and I believe with all of
[1:23:21] my heart that for the majority
[1:23:23] of the men that I know anyway the
[1:23:25] majority of them want the same thing
[1:23:27] they desire the same thing they want
[1:23:29] people to be closer to God they want
[1:23:31] people to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:34] but if Satan can sideline us and we go
[1:23:36] to majoring on a minor I don't care what
[1:23:39] the minor is and Satan don't either as
[1:23:42] long as you go to majoring on it you're
[1:23:44] going to mess up the program of God but
[1:23:47] if we could say okay well we disagree on
[1:23:49] this and that but can't we agree on the
[1:23:51] blood of Jesus saves us can't we agree
[1:23:54] on sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:23:56] Ghost and would say yes there's so much
[1:23:58] we agree on but we tend to focus more so
[1:24:02] on what we disagree on than what we
[1:24:05] agree on I'm reminded of gono whenever
[1:24:08] he was on the train and they were
[1:24:09] sending him down to Florida and removing
[1:24:12] him because our government made a treaty
[1:24:14] with him and they lied to him as most
[1:24:16] white men speak with forked tongue and
[1:24:19] whenever they did that and they lied to
[1:24:21] them and then there were the scouts
[1:24:23] which had actually worked for the
[1:24:25] federal government and they were the
[1:24:27] Apache Indians and whenever they got
[1:24:30] them and then they took their rank away
[1:24:32] from them they took their arms away from
[1:24:34] them and they throw them right on the
[1:24:36] same train and made them prisoners just
[1:24:40] like they did Geronimo and his band and
[1:24:43] the some of those men they absolutely
[1:24:45] hated those trackers they hated them
[1:24:49] because them Apaches LED them to their
[1:24:52] secret secet hideout in the cheras and
[1:24:54] in the desert Southwest so some of those
[1:24:57] men looked at them and they hated them
[1:24:59] but jono looked and he talked to his
[1:25:02] brothers and he said there are so few of
[1:25:05] us left there are so few of us left let
[1:25:09] us try to be able to get along and you
[1:25:12] think here is a man that looks at his
[1:25:15] culture they had lived there for
[1:25:17] hundreds and hundreds of years his land
[1:25:20] taken away from it by the White people
[1:25:23] and the prophet said the white man is
[1:25:25] the Renegade and as a white man I can
[1:25:28] say that because I was but I ain't no
[1:25:33] more I'm a saved white man what about
[1:25:36] the rest of you white folks oh well just
[1:25:38] tell you now the Renegade runs in the
[1:25:41] white culture so we think somehow we're
[1:25:43] Superior you ain't Superior just CU your
[1:25:46] Skin's lighter than somebody else you're
[1:25:49] as lost as lost can be till you find
[1:25:51] Jesus
[1:25:53] come on somebody say
[1:25:56] Amen but yet here they were they lost
[1:25:58] their wives they lost their children and
[1:26:01] now they're still arguing you done this
[1:26:03] you done that but jono being a real
[1:26:05] leader he realized they needed one
[1:26:08] another more than they ever had before
[1:26:10] let me tell you this we are losing in
[1:26:12] our ranks every day every day they're
[1:26:15] being called across the river and people
[1:26:18] are Falling Away I believe we need one
[1:26:21] another now more than ever before we
[1:26:24] ought to be determined that we are not
[1:26:26] going to allow the devil to divide us
[1:26:29] you think we're going to have one
[1:26:31] special section in heaven where only
[1:26:33] Word of Life Church lives where only
[1:26:36] Word of Life Saints live so you can live
[1:26:39] down Glory Avenue where it joins
[1:26:41] together with faith Avenue and
[1:26:43] Temperance Avenue and then somebody else
[1:26:45] from another church lives down another
[1:26:47] Avenue there ain't going to be no
[1:26:49] divisions in Heaven There ain't going to
[1:26:52] be no where you can't live and come on
[1:26:54] somebody I believe the real bride of
[1:26:57] Christ the prophet tells us before she
[1:27:00] gets ready to leave this world in a
[1:27:02] Rapture she will be like those people
[1:27:05] were that he saw in the sixth Dimension
[1:27:08] and what did that voice tell him that
[1:27:11] was there he said this is what you
[1:27:14] preached was perfect love this is what
[1:27:17] you preached was the Holy Ghost were
[1:27:20] they different yes they were different
[1:27:22] did they have different backgrounds yes
[1:27:24] they did but they had one Christ they
[1:27:27] had one common goal they had one main
[1:27:30] passion of their life and that is to let
[1:27:33] their light so shine before men that men
[1:27:36] might see your good works and glorify
[1:27:38] your father which is in heaven they
[1:27:41] desire to fulfill his word they desire
[1:27:44] to be able to reach out to the law come
[1:27:46] on preach with me this morning even if
[1:27:49] they don't go to our church I'm willing
[1:27:51] to pray for any man any woman any boy
[1:27:54] any girl if I can lead them to Christ
[1:27:57] even if they never darken this church
[1:28:00] door and they're not bride if I can lead
[1:28:03] them to the Lord Jesus and they wind up
[1:28:05] being a foolish virgin I will be
[1:28:08] identified with that person for eternity
[1:28:12] Hallelujah if I can lay my hands on
[1:28:15] somebody I don't care if they got bobbed
[1:28:18] hair I don't care if they got makeup on
[1:28:20] I don't care if they ain't even dress
[1:28:22] right if I can lay hands on them and let
[1:28:25] Jesus heal them it might be the bait
[1:28:28] that'll bring them to the word of God
[1:28:31] let's reach out let's love let's show
[1:28:34] Mercy let's show passion let's show the
[1:28:37] grace of God that's what we're called to
[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:50] do wa
[1:28:58] Psalm
[1:29:02] 1331 a song of
[1:29:04] degrees of
[1:29:07] David behold how
[1:29:10] good and pleasant it
[1:29:12] is for Brethren to dwell
[1:29:16] together and
[1:29:20] unity
[1:29:22] anybody know historically the time frame
[1:29:25] when this particular Psalm is
[1:29:29] written let me tell
[1:29:31] you there's been a civil war in
[1:29:35] Israel between the house of
[1:29:38] Saul and the House of
[1:29:41] David that Civil War has now finally
[1:29:46] been
[1:29:47] settled and the tribes are gathering
[1:29:51] under the Hedge ship of God's choice of
[1:29:54] being
[1:29:56] king and the spirit of God moves upon
[1:29:59] David's heart and he pins this
[1:30:02] Psalm Psalm
[1:30:05] 133 as he looks out and he sees from his
[1:30:09] Capital City the tribes harmonizing
[1:30:15] together instead of being Amazing Grace
[1:30:19] it's amaz s
[1:30:23] gra and he looks across the land and he
[1:30:25] sees the people of God coming together
[1:30:28] for what God called them to
[1:30:32] do and he says how pleasant it is for
[1:30:35] Brethren to dwell together in
[1:30:38] unity it is like to Precious
[1:30:43] ointment Glory upon the head that ran
[1:30:48] down upon the beard even Aaron beard
[1:30:52] that went down to the
[1:30:54] skirts of his
[1:30:57] garments now that would be such a
[1:31:00] peculiar way for us to look at this
[1:31:03] about
[1:31:05] Unity now the composition of this oil
[1:31:09] that he's referring to how good and how
[1:31:11] pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell
[1:31:13] together in unity it is like to Precious
[1:31:16] ointment so he says the precious
[1:31:19] ointment that ran down upon the beard
[1:31:22] even Aaron's beard so he's talking about
[1:31:26] the Holy anointing oil which was a
[1:31:31] composition of listen to this now sweet
[1:31:34] cinnamon sweet
[1:31:37] calamus cassia
[1:31:41] liia and olive oil 1 2 3 4
[1:31:49] five five elements
[1:31:52] or can I say
[1:32:00] fivefold so you pour in a little bit of
[1:32:03] Pastor and a little bit of evangelist
[1:32:05] and a little bit of teacher and a little
[1:32:08] bit of prophet and a little bit of
[1:32:11] evangelist and you got sweet anointing
[1:32:15] oil Hallelujah now remember this was
[1:32:19] sacred this smell could not be among the
[1:32:22] the the Ley the only person that could
[1:32:24] wear this was the chosen anointed ones
[1:32:28] of God so David looks at this of what
[1:32:32] God has now done that the body has
[1:32:34] finally come in to a Unison because with
[1:32:36] these two leaders so-called it was
[1:32:39] dividing the body of God it was dividing
[1:32:42] them whose side you are I'm on salsa oh
[1:32:45] you unbeliever I'll tell you one thing
[1:32:48] who I'm on David's side while the Lord
[1:32:50] sent the prophet Samuel over to David
[1:32:52] well he also sent him over to S I'll
[1:32:54] tell you one thing I'm still sending
[1:32:56] over well I'm on this side I'm on that
[1:32:58] side the devil said glory to God I can
[1:33:00] go down in hell and eat a moon pie and
[1:33:02] drink an RC I don't even have to do
[1:33:04] nothing with these people they're just
[1:33:05] fighting one another ain't it ashame
[1:33:07] that preachers do the same thing they
[1:33:09] get up in the pull pit and they blast
[1:33:11] this guy and blast that guy and I know
[1:33:12] some need to be blasted but instead of
[1:33:14] following the leading of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:16] well we've got to fix this and fix that
[1:33:18] you know what if we get anointed with
[1:33:20] this true anointing from the presence of
[1:33:22] God God leads us to deal with something
[1:33:24] let's deal with it and move on let's
[1:33:28] deal with it and move on there's more to
[1:33:31] the gospel friend there's more to eating
[1:33:33] the lamb than just the head when they
[1:33:36] had to eat the lamb they had to eat the
[1:33:38] whole thing you got to take the leg and
[1:33:40] you got to take the head and you got to
[1:33:42] take the neck and you got to take the
[1:33:44] rest of the body that's the way Christ
[1:33:46] the word is I don't want just healing I
[1:33:49] don't want just predestination I want
[1:33:52] election I want sanctification I want
[1:33:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost I want the
[1:33:57] placing of a son I want the whole L to
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:08] you now remember these ingredients were
[1:34:11] given to the
[1:34:14] Apothecary God was the one that gave
[1:34:17] them the exact
[1:34:19] ratio now if the Apo carry would have
[1:34:22] preferred a little bit of cinnamon more
[1:34:25] than cassia he could have totally
[1:34:28] altered the smell of the anointing oil
[1:34:32] yet he could have said I'm saying I'm
[1:34:34] I've got exactly what the prophet of God
[1:34:36] said
[1:34:39] Hallelujah but what he didn't say was
[1:34:42] that he kept majoring on a
[1:34:46] minor so if God gave them and said now
[1:34:49] tell what I want you to do this so I
[1:34:50] want you to mix in I want you to mix a
[1:34:52] tablespoon of sweet
[1:34:54] cinnamon and I want you to have a
[1:34:56] tablespoon and a half of sweet
[1:35:00] cassum and they don't want you to have a
[1:35:02] half a
[1:35:03] teaspoon of olive oil cuz a little goes
[1:35:06] along long
[1:35:08] way and then they said well I I've took
[1:35:11] every word glory to God I've studied
[1:35:13] this out I'll tell you one thing well
[1:35:16] maybe they did but it was just the
[1:35:19] ratio the ratio
[1:35:23] and then when they go to anointing the
[1:35:24] people with it and the people come up
[1:35:26] and they go to anoint them because
[1:35:27] that's what the preacher is doing he's
[1:35:29] anointing the people and is throwing
[1:35:30] that Holy oil right out on the people
[1:35:33] and the people's sharing it but the
[1:35:35] ratio don't match the original word and
[1:35:37] they
[1:35:41] go now we don't believe in gifts here at
[1:35:44] our church we don't believe in no
[1:35:46] emotion at our church ah your preacher
[1:35:49] mixed up the ratio didn't it am well
[1:35:52] come on somebody well glory to God I'll
[1:35:55] tell you one thing we believe in the
[1:35:56] gifts more than we believe in heer we
[1:35:57] believe what we're really focusing on
[1:35:59] that that's not the correct
[1:36:02] ratio now notice how it comes once it's
[1:36:05] all mixed together and then shake it all
[1:36:07] up
[1:36:13] together don't worry I'm not going to
[1:36:15] open it ain't that
[1:36:17] dumb I think it blow up like a time bomb
[1:36:19] wouldn't it
[1:36:22] then you say come here
[1:36:26] now so he take the lid
[1:36:30] off you and no and Aaron and the rest
[1:36:32] the priest now want you notice they
[1:36:35] didn't sprinkle
[1:36:39] them they didn't sprinkle them but there
[1:36:41] was enough oil to it run from the top of
[1:36:44] their head down their face on their
[1:36:47] beard and dripped off the beard to the
[1:36:49] skirt skrt it's not like you women
[1:36:51] wearing skirts but it's a Hebrew word
[1:36:53] which actually means the opening of the
[1:36:56] bottom garment so it would have been
[1:36:58] like the waistline so the oil comes
[1:37:01] right down their hair down on their face
[1:37:03] right down on their beard and was
[1:37:04] running down on their body remember over
[1:37:07] the urum Thum which had the names of the
[1:37:10] tribes you see God wants a priesthood
[1:37:13] preachers that are so anointed from the
[1:37:16] presence of God that when they come out
[1:37:18] from the presence of the Lord the
[1:37:20] anointing will start running down over
[1:37:22] the congregation it'll come down over
[1:37:24] their names and then they become oh
[1:37:27] Hallelujah they also become anointed
[1:37:30] because that man has been in the
[1:37:32] presence of the Lord oh God give us men
[1:37:35] like that give us song leaders like that
[1:37:38] give us people like that to say God we
[1:37:41] need your anointing to live in this
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:50] day
[1:37:53] as the
[1:37:55] doe of
[1:37:57] Hermon
[1:37:59] wow the Dew of
[1:38:03] Hermon and as the D that descended upon
[1:38:06] the
[1:38:07] mountains of
[1:38:09] Zion now here we're still talking about
[1:38:12] brothers dwelling together in this
[1:38:16] Unity now for us do means something
[1:38:19] totally different than them
[1:38:21] I if you've ever studied on do or
[1:38:24] not it's part of the abrahamic Covenant
[1:38:28] which begins in the Book of Genesis it
[1:38:32] was part of the patriarchal blessing
[1:38:35] whenever they lay their hands on their
[1:38:38] sons and they'd say may you have the
[1:38:42] Dew from
[1:38:44] heaven now to us it means a different
[1:38:46] thing because of where we live here in
[1:38:48] Tennessee we got all kinds of rains
[1:38:50] right but there in Palestine they didn't
[1:38:53] and still don't so do was a sign of the
[1:38:57] blessings of
[1:38:59] God that it amazing oh how we love rain
[1:39:04] you ever noticed how loud rain can
[1:39:07] be but have you ever noticed how quiet
[1:39:10] do
[1:39:13] is I love rain W Glory Hallelujah
[1:39:18] Hallelujah but boy I love that dud too
[1:39:22] don't you love them due drops from
[1:39:23] heaven where they just come down and
[1:39:25] they just appear and you don't know
[1:39:27] exactly even where they come from but
[1:39:29] all you know is you walk out of church
[1:39:32] soaking
[1:39:34] wet you didn't run you didn't jump you
[1:39:36] didn't shout and you say well Lord I I
[1:39:39] don't guess I got nothing out of service
[1:39:41] and you walk out of there and you feel
[1:39:42] like you weigh five pounds heavier than
[1:39:44] you did before and you're walking out
[1:39:46] and say praise God I feel refreshed it
[1:39:49] was due brother Johnson
[1:39:51] you know some of the ancient Travelers
[1:39:53] wrote about the D of Hermon and they say
[1:39:56] even to this day of course it's one of
[1:39:57] the very few places in in in Israel to
[1:40:00] where they actually get snow I saw a
[1:40:01] picture of the day video which part of
[1:40:03] the northern part there elevation pretty
[1:40:05] high and whenever these Travelers would
[1:40:08] travel through there they would have to
[1:40:10] absolutely waterproof their tents
[1:40:13] because whenever they would come out in
[1:40:15] the morning it was as if though it had
[1:40:17] rained all night long and there was no
[1:40:21] Thunder going on there was no lightning
[1:40:23] going on there was nobody jumping or
[1:40:25] nobody shouting now we believe in all
[1:40:27] that I love rain but I love Dew don't
[1:40:32] you I love the Dew drops of mercy so
[1:40:35] bright sometimes to be honest with you I
[1:40:38] don't need a
[1:40:39] thunderstorm sometimes I just need a
[1:40:41] calm drenching from the does of Hermon
[1:40:45] to where something just pulls your soul
[1:40:48] in the presence of God and then hard no
[1:40:51] noise going on and there ain't hardly no
[1:40:53] shouting going on and you're sitting
[1:40:55] there in the presence of God and you
[1:40:58] just get up to walk out and you just say
[1:41:00] glory to God and your clothes are just
[1:41:03] drenched your soul is drenched what is
[1:41:07] it it's the due of the abrahamic
[1:41:10] Covenant he's going to be there when you
[1:41:12] need him in them storms thank God for
[1:41:14] them Pentecostal storms but thank God
[1:41:17] you know what the word there means it's
[1:41:19] the Mist in the night that's what the do
[1:41:23] is the Mist in the night thank you Lord
[1:41:29] thank you Lord sometimes when you're all
[1:41:32] tore up a thunderstorm will scare even
[1:41:34] worse but when you're in the middle of
[1:41:36] your night maybe some of you there today
[1:41:38] you're going through the offest time in
[1:41:40] your life and you don't know what to do
[1:41:42] and you're praying for God to move and
[1:41:44] you're listening you're listen oh my I'm
[1:41:46] listening for the Thunder I'm waiting
[1:41:47] for the lightning and God may not choose
[1:41:49] out at all God they catch you right here
[1:41:51] in this service today and let the DU
[1:41:54] drops for Mercy start dropping right
[1:41:56] down on your soul and lift you out of
[1:41:59] that darkness and when you wake up in
[1:42:01] the morning you realize the DW from
[1:42:07] Hermon as the D of Hermon as the DW that
[1:42:09] descended upon the mountains of Zion for
[1:42:13] there the Lord commanded the
[1:42:15] blessing even
[1:42:17] life forever
[1:42:19] more if Ephesians 4:2 with all
[1:42:22] loneliness and meekness with
[1:42:23] longsuffering
[1:42:26] forbearing one another in
[1:42:29] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:42:32] the spirit in the bond of Peace there is
[1:42:37] one body and one Spirit even as you are
[1:42:39] called in one hope of your calling verse
[1:42:43] 11 and he gave some sweet
[1:42:46] cinnamon and some
[1:42:48] calamus and some olive oil
[1:42:52] Glory Apostles some prophets some
[1:42:54] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:42:57] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:43:00] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:43:03] the body of Christ
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:07] till Paul gave us the time frame when we
[1:43:12] would no longer need
[1:43:16] preaches want to know when it
[1:43:18] is till we all
[1:43:21] come in the unity of the
[1:43:24] faith oh brother Donnie that's why we
[1:43:26] just play tapes cuz all the tape people
[1:43:28] believe the same thing apparently you
[1:43:29] ain't talked to very many of them I
[1:43:31] ain't found very many believe the same
[1:43:32] thing there is divided they a't even got
[1:43:34] no preacher leading them they got
[1:43:36] businessmen so a lot of them's got
[1:43:37] they're as divided and split as they can
[1:43:39] be don't sit there and look at me and
[1:43:40] say well that's the answer that is not
[1:43:42] the answer God could have had the tape
[1:43:44] recorder invented 2,000 years ago he
[1:43:47] could have had Paul's voice recorded if
[1:43:49] that's what he wanted he start started
[1:43:50] it out with low down sorry rotten human
[1:43:54] beings that he filled with the Holy
[1:43:55] Ghost and called them to be Apostles and
[1:43:57] Prophets and evangelist and pastors and
[1:44:00] teachers but brother Donnie they have
[1:44:01] mistakes they match you why in the world
[1:44:05] would you want a perfect Pastor I
[1:44:06] wouldn't even fit with you all if I was
[1:44:08] a perfect Pastor what in the world would
[1:44:10] I want with a perfect prophet he
[1:44:12] wouldn't line up in me cuz I ain't
[1:44:14] perfect but I needed a man that was like
[1:44:17] I was I needed a savior that would
[1:44:19] become like I
[1:44:21] a savior that did not come as a God but
[1:44:24] come as a
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:29] man till we all come in the
[1:44:32] unity of the
[1:44:34] face and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:44:40] God unto a perfect
[1:44:43] man unto the measure of the
[1:44:47] stature of the
[1:44:49] fullness of
[1:44:52] Christ let me say this in closing if
[1:44:55] almighty
[1:44:57] God does not accomplish this
[1:45:00] verse how can I have any confidence in
[1:45:03] Malachi for if he can't fulfill EP
[1:45:06] fasions
[1:45:09] for but I ain't the least bit worried
[1:45:12] about it are you anybody here today
[1:45:14] nervous that this scripture ain't going
[1:45:15] to be fulfilled it's going to be
[1:45:17] fulfilled my brother and sister it'll be
[1:45:21] one of the greatest Miracles that has
[1:45:23] ever swept the Earth's after the
[1:45:27] fall that God will bring preachers
[1:45:31] around the world into the unity of the
[1:45:35] faith many of them have been through
[1:45:37] this and that and the other and they've
[1:45:38] learned and they've corrected and you
[1:45:40] know we we've all been that way but well
[1:45:42] you don't just judge them by what they
[1:45:44] were you look and see what their motives
[1:45:46] are now what are they trying to
[1:45:49] accomplish and God will sweep the Earth
[1:45:53] with one
[1:45:56] mind can you imagine then every member
[1:45:58] of the Bride around the world will have
[1:46:00] one
[1:46:01] mind so God from the throne room
[1:46:04] projects one thought
[1:46:07] today is Rapture
[1:46:11] Day everybody with that same
[1:46:15] mind will think the same
[1:46:19] thought
[1:46:20] praise the
[1:46:22] Lord praise the
[1:46:25] Lord let's Stand
[1:46:38] Together praise the
[1:46:43] Lord so we not only want the mind of
[1:46:47] Christ but we want to have the same mind
[1:46:49] as our brothers and sisters
[1:46:51] sisters as long as they have the right
[1:46:56] mind thank you
[1:46:59] Lord so how will God ever
[1:47:02] accomplish such a
[1:47:06] thing I don't want you to think me weird
[1:47:09] but I've been
[1:47:13] looking
[1:47:15] about people who
[1:47:18] have transplants
[1:47:21] heart liver things like
[1:47:26] that and I found so interesting I've
[1:47:30] been asked questions along them lines
[1:47:32] over the years actually people want to
[1:47:34] know it would be okay to have a heart
[1:47:35] transplant is that were you so you know
[1:47:37] all
[1:47:37] that but I never looked at it like I
[1:47:41] have in the last
[1:47:44] bit and what I found was so amazing was
[1:47:47] that a percentage of people
[1:47:51] who would have a liver transplant more
[1:47:53] so the
[1:47:55] heart but when they would get someone
[1:47:57] else's
[1:47:59] heart they would actually
[1:48:01] start having
[1:48:05] memories and one example I'll share with
[1:48:08] you this morning was an an 8-year-old
[1:48:11] girl that needed a
[1:48:13] heart a 10-year-old girl got
[1:48:17] murdered and they took her heart and put
[1:48:20] it inside this body of this 8-year-old
[1:48:24] girl this 8-year-old girl started having
[1:48:28] nightmares and
[1:48:31] dreams that someone was after
[1:48:34] her and she saw the face of this man and
[1:48:38] the clothes he was
[1:48:43] wearing and as they started researching
[1:48:45] it and she was so troubled she could not
[1:48:47] get away from it so I actually they got
[1:48:50] the law involved in
[1:48:53] it and through the dreams of this girl
[1:48:56] with this transplanted
[1:48:59] heart they actually found the
[1:49:02] murderer of that 10-year-old
[1:49:06] girl from the memory that was Resto
[1:49:09] restored started rather in that heart
[1:49:12] she
[1:49:14] received another one her appetite was
[1:49:18] changed of things that she like to eat I
[1:49:22] mean there's one story after another
[1:49:24] after
[1:49:26] another I find that very interesting but
[1:49:29] what I find more interesting than that
[1:49:33] is and what the scientists have said for
[1:49:36] years and years is the only part that
[1:49:38] can remember in your body is your brain
[1:49:40] but now they're having to rethink this
[1:49:43] thinking that in your cells cellular
[1:49:46] memory and also DNA memory and mRNA
[1:49:49] memory
[1:49:51] that they're saying it's stored not only
[1:49:53] in your brain but in your
[1:49:56] organs so I began to
[1:49:59] think well if somebody would get
[1:50:01] somebody else's
[1:50:03] heart and it would change their
[1:50:06] appetite so a
[1:50:08] woman got an A a heart and whenever she
[1:50:12] come out of the heart surgery and she
[1:50:14] got well she started wanting beer she
[1:50:19] never drank beer in her
[1:50:21] life but she wanted
[1:50:24] beer with chicken
[1:50:29] nuggets I mean it really puzzled her she
[1:50:32] she hated
[1:50:33] beer but she started loving beer and
[1:50:36] chicken nug she had to have her chicken
[1:50:37] nuggets with her
[1:50:38] beer through much research she found out
[1:50:41] she received the heart of an 18-year-old
[1:50:45] boy you guessed it his favorite food
[1:50:49] beer and chicken
[1:50:53] nuggets so me in my mind I begin to
[1:50:56] think
[1:50:59] okay so if that could be so in a human
[1:51:03] body it ain't no wonder he had to come
[1:51:06] to the
[1:51:08] Earth and give us his
[1:51:12] heart and then he would take out our old
[1:51:15] Stony heart as he said in the Book of
[1:51:18] Ezekiel that he would do
[1:51:20] and give us his heart then it would
[1:51:24] change our
[1:51:27] desires one woman which was a devout
[1:51:31] lesbian did not like men a devout
[1:51:35] lesbian got a heart
[1:51:37] transplant but when she woke
[1:51:40] up she didn't like women no
[1:51:43] more met a man fell in love with a man
[1:51:46] got married had
[1:51:48] children
[1:51:51] I said yep my Jesus will do the same
[1:51:54] thing
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:56] [Laughter]
[1:52:02] today so they found some of these
[1:52:06] people remembering things that they had
[1:52:10] never experienced but they go to
[1:52:12] studying the lives of some of these
[1:52:14] people that had donated their hearts and
[1:52:16] they was having recall of the life
[1:52:20] of someone
[1:52:23] else so again I think okay
[1:52:27] so whenever I'm sitting there and I'm
[1:52:29] hearing a prophet or some other preacher
[1:52:31] preach about I was in God's mind before
[1:52:34] the foundation of the world and there's
[1:52:36] a part of me that says glory to
[1:52:40] God what is it he changed my
[1:52:46] heart and gave me an
[1:52:48] identity with with
[1:52:50] him aren't you glad brother Ry aren't
[1:52:53] you glad
[1:52:57] Saints so that if that is true and this
[1:53:00] is his word though will not he project
[1:53:03] to us this desire for a
[1:53:06] Unison in our church body in our
[1:53:10] families in our homes in our fellowship
[1:53:13] with other
[1:53:15] churches around the
[1:53:18] world why because we've all got the same
[1:53:23] heart from the same
[1:53:28] donor so the donor's heart
[1:53:31] changes what we
[1:53:33] eat and then we actually start thinking
[1:53:37] his
[1:53:40] thoughts so whenever we hear the
[1:53:42] preacher stand up and read the quote and
[1:53:43] fure home that he thought of himself as
[1:53:46] being human and that transmitted him him
[1:53:50] down to be
[1:53:52] Jesus then we have no problem within our
[1:53:55] minds going back and thinking yeah and
[1:53:58] then when I come to the earth I was
[1:54:00] transmitted too I was a thought I've
[1:54:04] received his donor heart and his donor
[1:54:08] mind and it helps me to
[1:54:10] think like
[1:54:14] him let's B this
[1:54:18] together
[1:54:20] Lord
[1:54:24] Jesus heavenly father as we stand here
[1:54:28] today we're asking you Lord that you'd
[1:54:31] help
[1:54:33] us science say that they're going to
[1:54:36] have to
[1:54:38] rewrite some of their textbooks on these
[1:54:41] things that I've spoke about
[1:54:44] today I've read some of them years ago
[1:54:46] and I was just bewildered by it to be
[1:54:48] honest
[1:54:51] but as they've researched more and more
[1:54:53] in the last few years
[1:54:55] and started putting it all together
[1:54:58] they're finding that it's
[1:55:03] true oh Lord God what a wretched
[1:55:06] miserable condition that we were
[1:55:09] in we were in need of a heart
[1:55:15] transplant for our heart was filled with
[1:55:18] sin wretched and
[1:55:23] vow you pulled us
[1:55:25] up into the surgery room might have been
[1:55:29] a church altar it might have been in in
[1:55:32] a barn lot
[1:55:34] somewhere you opened us up took that old
[1:55:38] vow nature
[1:55:41] out and put a portion of your own
[1:55:43] hearted
[1:55:46] us when we woke
[1:55:48] up
[1:55:51] we started wanting food that we hadn't
[1:55:52] liked
[1:55:54] before food on election and food on
[1:55:57] Holiness food on forgiveness food on
[1:56:04] Mercy we
[1:56:08] started thinking of things that we'
[1:56:10] never thought of before that we were in
[1:56:13] your
[1:56:14] mind before the foundation of the
[1:56:18] world and when we hear the prophet say
[1:56:21] that we were part of those angels that
[1:56:23] did not fall in the
[1:56:25] beginning our dare say there's not a
[1:56:27] person here today that's born again and
[1:56:29] filled with the Holy Ghost that when a
[1:56:30] preacher goes to preaching and that they
[1:56:33] find a part of
[1:56:35] thems roaming out in that invisible
[1:56:42] World hallelujah
[1:56:45] hallelujah it's the
[1:56:47] deposit from you
[1:56:51] Lord Jesus if there's one here today or
[1:56:55] many they tried to be a
[1:56:57] Chris they've tried to do what's
[1:57:01] right but they've done it without a
[1:57:03] heart
[1:57:05] transplant
[1:57:08] Jesus they don't have to come to the
[1:57:10] altar I'll certainly pray with them if
[1:57:11] they choose to but they can stand right
[1:57:14] there at their
[1:57:16] seat and open up their heart and let you
[1:57:21] perform a heart
[1:57:24] transplant unlike when science started
[1:57:27] doing it years
[1:57:30] ago and those who was able to live was
[1:57:33] so
[1:57:35] few until they begin to develop drugs of
[1:57:38] anti-rejection
[1:57:41] they deemed it was not worth
[1:57:46] it to even do it
[1:57:50] but
[1:57:51] you once you share your heart with
[1:57:55] someone and it goes down into their
[1:57:59] soul you've never lost a
[1:58:03] case all of
[1:58:05] yours have a
[1:58:08] 100% survival
[1:58:11] rate they don't live 10 years or 15
[1:58:15] years they will live for eternity
[1:58:23] hallelujah oh Jesus may your spirit go
[1:58:26] Among Us here today father if there's
[1:58:29] any that's sick any that needs the Holy
[1:58:33] Ghost Lord maybe there's some here today
[1:58:35] that needs a good shower they just need
[1:58:37] a good dose of a good heavy
[1:58:40] rain there may be some others that just
[1:58:42] need some do lord they're in such a
[1:58:45] troubled spot Thunder would frighten
[1:58:47] them like would work on their
[1:58:51] nerves but may the DW from
[1:58:54] Hermon so saturate our souls here today
[1:58:59] Father oh Jesus and when we walk out of

[1:59:04] drenched in the lifechanging power of
[1:59:09] God we worship you
