[11:46] Now, everybody
[11:49] that lives
[11:51] around us,
[11:53] they want to tear this message
[11:57] lighthouse
[11:58] down.
[12:00] They say the big ships they don't cruise
[12:04] that oldfashioned way anymore. There's
[12:08] no use in it standing
[12:12] around
[12:13] within my mind. It goes back to that
[12:18] stormy
[12:20] night. Hallelujah. And just in time, I
[12:25] saw
[12:27] light
[12:30] from that old
[12:32] lighthouse.
[12:34] It still leads me home.
[12:40] And I thank God
[12:44] for
[12:46] my hand.
[12:49] I owe my life to him.
[12:56] Oh, for Jesus
[12:58] is the lighthouse.
[13:03] And from the rocks of sea,
[13:09] he has shown
[13:13] his light around me
[13:17] that I might clearly
[13:21] see.
[13:23] Maybe it was a call
[13:27] that I have
[13:31] to where would this
[13:35] be?
[13:37] He has shown
[13:39] his life. Oh yes, he has me
[13:45] that I might clearly
[13:49] see. And if it wasn't
[13:54] for
[13:55] the lighthouse,
[13:59] where would this ship be?
[14:06] Oh, if you love him, give him a good
[14:08] hand clap of praise tonight.
[14:14] Hallelujah. Somebody say praise the
[14:17] Lord.
[14:18] Somebody say hallelujah.

[15:44] Robinson sends this in. My brother
[15:46] Billy's uh son Billy Guthy called today
[15:51] and wanted to know how to pray. I told
[15:53] him, you talk to the Lord just like you
[15:54] talk to another person. First, you give
[15:57] your heart to the Lord and he needs
[15:58] healing in his leg. He fell a couple of
[16:01] months ago off of a ladder. Pray for his
[16:04] soul and a broken leg. Brother Greg

[16:32] It's good to be here. It's good that
[16:34] he's here. Amen. You know, I I usually
[16:40] don't say much, but

[16:46] sister-in-law
[16:47] was in a bad place. They sent her to ICU
[16:50] and
[16:52] uh didn't look good, but we had prayer
[16:56] and the Lord come on the scene. If you
[16:59] have a need, you might be in a spiritual
[17:01] ICU. You might be in a place that you
[17:05] don't know what to do, but he'll come on
[17:07] the scene. Amen. Let's go to the Lord.

[56:23] millions of voices

[56:28] about what a great great mighty
[56:30] conqueror he is. I want to be there,
[56:33] don't you? By the grace of God, we
[56:35] welcome you tonight. We've come
[56:38] expecting great things from the Lord
[56:39] these few days that we're gathered
[56:41] together. And without any further delay,
[56:44] we'll ask brother Matt Watkins if he
[56:45] would just come and bring to us what the
[56:48] Lord has placed upon his heart. No doubt
[56:51] our needs are as many and as versatile
[56:54] as the people that are here. We thank
[56:56] each of you for coming. All the effort
[56:58] that you've put forth to be here with
[56:59] us. You blessed us with your presence
[57:02] these couple of days. So, we just want
[57:04] to ask God to help us. Lord willing,
[57:07] tomorrow night, we'll be having a prayer
[57:08] line. Several several people have
[57:10] requested that we be prayed for. So
[57:12] we'll be starting the service tomorrow
[57:14] evening at 6:00. Give us plenty of time
[57:17] to pray for everybody. Uh brother Matt
[57:19] be speaking tonight. Brother Daryl
[57:21] tomorrow uh you tomorrow evening and
[57:24] then brother David Siler on Sunday
[57:25] morning. So for every service you can be
[57:28] with us. We thank you for that. If this
[57:30] is your only service and remember us the
[57:32] other two that God would just visit us
[57:33] in a special way. How many believes this
[57:35] is the time of our visitation? Imagine
[57:39] when Jesus goes into Jerusalem for the
[57:42] last time and he wept and he cried and
[57:46] he said, "If thou wouldest only had
[57:48] known the time of thy visitation, but
[57:52] now the time has come and passed, I
[57:55] don't want that to be said about us. I
[57:57] want to be able to recognize what God is
[58:00] doing." Sing something for us. Let's
[58:03] just open our hearts now. We invite
[58:05] brother Matt to come. whatever you have
[58:07] need of. Now, remember the Lord Jesus is
[58:09] mindful of your need.

[1:00:40] clap of praise? Oh, give him a real hand
[1:00:43] clap of praise. Lord, you're worthy.
[1:00:47] Yes, you are, Jesus.
[1:00:49] Amen. Lord, we just want to tell you
[1:00:51] that you're worthy of all of our praise.
[1:00:54] Lord, how insignificant, Lord, we feel
[1:00:57] as David did when he said, "What is man
[1:01:01] that you're mindful of him or the son of
[1:01:03] man that you visited them, Lord?" And
[1:01:05] that's truly how each one of us here
[1:01:07] feel tonight, Lord. God, but we just
[1:01:10] want to raise our hands as creation,
[1:01:13] Lord. when the rest of the world rejects
[1:01:16] you and turns away from you. We just
[1:01:18] want to raise our hands and say thank
[1:01:19] you Jesus for your grace in our life.
[1:01:23] Thank you for your love Lord that comes
[1:01:25] after us continuing again and again
[1:01:28] Lord. Thank you Lord that you never give
[1:01:30] up on us but you keep Lord pursuing us
[1:01:33] even after Lord the storms and the
[1:01:36] battles and the missteps and the
[1:01:38] mistakes Lord that we make. But yet,
[1:01:41] Lord, here we are tonight. Lord, when
[1:01:43] you've put a desire in our heart to
[1:01:45] serve you, Lord, I pray that you would
[1:01:47] just be praised now. We give you all the
[1:01:49] thanks, Lord. We love you with all of
[1:01:51] our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:53] Christ. Amen. Brother, if you could just
[1:01:55] place something maybe softly there. Why
[1:01:57] don't you just bow your heads with me
[1:01:59] again? I I wonder even before we start
[1:02:01] this meeting. Amen. Just feel the
[1:02:04] nearness of the Holy Spirit. Amen. in a
[1:02:06] building like this. No doubt you'd come
[1:02:08] from different, you know, stages of life
[1:02:11] and different stations. And some of you
[1:02:13] raising children, some of you
[1:02:15] grandchildren, some of you know
[1:02:16] children, but we're all at different
[1:02:18] parts of our journey. And we all come
[1:02:20] through different tests and different
[1:02:22] trials. And no doubt if I was to go
[1:02:25] through this room, there'd be just a
[1:02:26] multitude of needs. body uh sick in body
[1:02:30] diseases spiritual some lost some with
[1:02:33] lost children some we're praying for
[1:02:35] that God will bring back uh some needs
[1:02:37] maritally some in the church brother
[1:02:39] Donnie didn't come back there and give
[1:02:41] me the you know the secret intel on this
[1:02:43] family and this family he didn't sit
[1:02:44] none of us brothers down and give us any
[1:02:46] clues what to preach on uh but I know
[1:02:49] this we're a needy people
[1:02:52] I wonder if you'd have a need here
[1:02:53] tonight just before we start this
[1:02:55] service before we start these meetings
[1:02:58] Let's just say, Lord, here's a hand that
[1:03:00] I'm going to raise. I'm going to
[1:03:02] represent a specific need, Lord. You
[1:03:05] said to ask anything in my name and
[1:03:07] don't doubt and you'll have what you ask
[1:03:09] for, Lord. So, here's my hand. I'm
[1:03:11] lifting it up now. God is going to see
[1:03:14] all those hands. And behind that hand is
[1:03:16] a need that's represented. Why don't we
[1:03:18] just hold it up before the Lord and talk
[1:03:20] to him? Lord Jesus, Father, we we're
[1:03:23] believers of your word. We believe that
[1:03:26] you are still tonight the same Lord that
[1:03:29] you were the day that you created the
[1:03:31] world, Father, when a dark darkness was
[1:03:34] across the face of the deep and you
[1:03:36] spoke and said, "Let there be, Lord."
[1:03:39] And you're still the same Jehovah Gyra
[1:03:41] here tonight. And it could look
[1:03:43] impossible for a mother, look impossible
[1:03:45] for a father, maybe a teenager here
[1:03:48] that's struggling and just barely made
[1:03:50] it into the door. But I just want to say
[1:03:52] the miracle is that you're here. that
[1:03:54] Satan couldn't stop you. He tried
[1:03:56] everything to hinder you, but you're
[1:03:58] here tonight in the presence of God. And
[1:04:01] Lord, we just want to pull up a ta a
[1:04:03] chair to your table, Lord, and say,
[1:04:05] "Come be the need meter. Come and be
[1:04:07] make the difference in our life, Lord.
[1:04:09] God, I pray that your spirit would just
[1:04:11] take control, Lord, over from the front
[1:04:14] to the back door, Lord, on this
[1:04:16] platform. May we, Lord, not uh Lord, may
[1:04:19] we right now just enter into the channel
[1:04:22] of what the Holy Spirit wants for us,
[1:04:24] God. Lord, I believe that you want to
[1:04:26] speak. And I just want to raise hands
[1:04:28] and say, "I'm here to listen, Lord. I
[1:04:30] pray that you'd make me sensitive. Make
[1:04:32] us sensitive to what your spirit wants
[1:04:35] to say." Lord, if it be someone here,
[1:04:37] someone online, someone who will listen
[1:04:39] later. Oh God, may your grace just reach
[1:04:42] down, Lord, and touch your children. We
[1:04:45] ask it now, Lord, for you to have
[1:04:47] preeminence in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:04:50] Amen. You love him.
[1:04:53] Amen. If you have your Bible, we'll turn
[1:04:55] to the book of Job, chapter 23. Amen.
[1:04:58] God bless you. It's uh certainly an
[1:05:00] honor to be here with you and um just a
[1:05:02] privilege, amen, to be able to come here
[1:05:04] again and speak to you. And I just uh
[1:05:07] consider myself just uh the least among
[1:05:10] anybody really who could be up here. But
[1:05:13] I just want to say how thankful I am to
[1:05:15] be here. Brother Donnie, thank you.
[1:05:17] Amen. In the church here, amen, for the
[1:05:19] invitation and for allowing us to come.
[1:05:21] Amen. I appreciate my family and and
[1:05:24] friends and those that have traveled
[1:05:25] here. Amen. Don't you just love the Lord
[1:05:28] Jesus? Amen. Aren't you just glad to say
[1:05:30] I'm part of the family of God? Amen. I'm
[1:05:32] so glad to be part of that great family.
[1:05:35] Amen. One day trouble will be over. You
[1:05:38] know, one day suffering's going to end.
[1:05:40] Amen. And I just want to say happy day,
[1:05:42] Lord. Even so, come Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:05:46] But now we've got trouble. We've got
[1:05:49] problems. We've got issues. We've got
[1:05:51] circumstances. And if you tell me,
[1:05:53] Brother Matt, we don't have those
[1:05:55] problems. I don't believe you.
[1:05:58] It ain't just South Carolina. It ain't
[1:05:59] just Tennessee. It's all across the
[1:06:01] world. Amen. We all, every church has
[1:06:04] got different battles and different
[1:06:06] things that we're facing. Amen. But I
[1:06:08] just want to say, Lord, you're greater
[1:06:10] than all of my difficulties. You're
[1:06:12] greater than all of my problems. You're
[1:06:14] greater than all of my stress, anything
[1:06:16] the devil has tried to put in my life
[1:06:18] and in my way. God, you are bigger than
[1:06:20] all of those things. Amen. We just want
[1:06:23] to do our part here tonight. And I'm
[1:06:25] going to minister to you. And I I've
[1:06:27] known really the generally speaking, the
[1:06:29] direction I would go. Just a few things
[1:06:31] I was praying about, asking the Lord
[1:06:33] what he would have me speak. And then
[1:06:35] the Lord just quickened something to me.
[1:06:37] I actually ministered this only a few
[1:06:40] times and even the Lord uh revealed this
[1:06:42] to me months and months ago that I would
[1:06:45] stand here and I would preach this. So I
[1:06:46] just pray that the Holy Spirit would
[1:06:48] just make it real to you as he made it
[1:06:51] to me. Amen. And so we we just want to
[1:06:54] uh be used of the Lord and and and be
[1:06:57] sensitive to his spirit and just say
[1:06:59] just what he wants us to say.
[1:07:02] Amen. We believe he's in control. Amen.
[1:07:05] And so we just want to give him all the
[1:07:07] preeminence. Now I'm going to minister
[1:07:10] to you something that is very personal
[1:07:13] to me. It's very real to me. Some things
[1:07:16] you know you study. Some things you know
[1:07:18] that you you look at than other things
[1:07:21] you live. And uh and so what I'm going
[1:07:24] to minister to you tonight is something
[1:07:26] I've lived very personally. And I
[1:07:28] believe God is a personal God. I believe
[1:07:32] he's one who doesn't just give us great
[1:07:34] lofty things. That's wonderful. But I
[1:07:37] believe God can come down just to right
[1:07:39] at our seat on our row and just come
[1:07:42] right down into our living room right
[1:07:44] where we live. And God could bring a
[1:07:47] word and you you know really what you
[1:07:50] need is a word from the Lord. And you
[1:07:52] don't need a word from man or a word
[1:07:54] from science or a psychologist. We need
[1:07:56] a word from the Lord. And I believe that
[1:07:59] the Lord can give us a word. Amen. And I
[1:08:02] believe he's given us that here tonight.
[1:08:04] I want to minister to you tonight. And
[1:08:06] I'm going to title my sermon here
[1:08:08] tonight, broken
[1:08:10] but not bitter.
[1:08:13] You can be broken
[1:08:15] and not bitter.
[1:08:18] Amen. Let's look at Job chapter 23 and
[1:08:21] verse 8. Behold, I go forward,
[1:08:27] but he is not there,
[1:08:29] and backward,
[1:08:32] but I cannot perceive him.
[1:08:35] On the left hand, where he doth work,
[1:08:39] but I cannot behold him. He hideth
[1:08:42] himself on the right hand, that I cannot
[1:08:46] see him.
[1:08:49] But here's where Job's confidence laid.
[1:08:52] But he knoweth the way that I take.
[1:08:57] And when he hath tried me, I shall come
[1:09:02] forth as gold.
[1:09:06] Hebrews chapter 12. Just one more
[1:09:08] passage and then we'll have you be
[1:09:10] seated.
[1:09:14] Hebrews chapter 12. And I just want to
[1:09:18] begin reading here in verse 14.
[1:09:22] Follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:09:26] without which no man shall see the Lord,
[1:09:31] looking diligently lest any man fell of
[1:09:35] the grace of God, lest any root of
[1:09:39] bitterness springing up trouble you. But
[1:09:43] notice it doesn't stop with you and
[1:09:46] thereby many be defiled.
[1:09:51] Lord Jesus, we just ask you to come and
[1:09:53] bless us now. Lord, I pray that you
[1:09:56] would take my words, Lord. You know how
[1:09:58] Lord, how I've waited on you. Many
[1:10:01] things, Lord, as a man that we would
[1:10:03] love to preach many things. We
[1:10:05] directions we love to go, but we're your
[1:10:08] servant, Lord. And I pray God that you
[1:10:10] would just come and make this real.
[1:10:14] Come to every heart, every life, Lord.
[1:10:17] And may you bring a transformation so
[1:10:19] real that we can say we left here and we
[1:10:22] have never been the same before. I pray
[1:10:26] Jesus that you would just take full
[1:10:27] preeminence. I just become now
[1:10:30] subservient to you, Lord. I follow your
[1:10:33] spirit now. I pray that you would move
[1:10:35] in every life. We ask it in Jesus
[1:10:37] Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated.
[1:10:50] You know, it doesn't always make sense.
[1:10:53] Life is like a journey. We could look at
[1:10:56] you could find that in the Bible very
[1:10:59] starts with Abraham. And Abraham leaves
[1:11:02] everything that he knew, leaves his
[1:11:05] home, leaves his family. It was a hard
[1:11:08] thing. It wasn't easy for God just to
[1:11:10] say, "Get up." Doesn't give him an
[1:11:12] explanation. Doesn't tell him even where
[1:11:15] he's going. Think about that. But just
[1:11:17] tells him, "Get up out of this land.
[1:11:20] Leave everything you've ever known,
[1:11:22] everything you've ever worked for,
[1:11:24] everything that you thought your life
[1:11:26] was going in a certain direction. You
[1:11:28] had it mapped out so perfectly. You had
[1:11:30] everything lined out. You had planned on
[1:11:32] where you'd live, what your life would
[1:11:34] appear to be like, what kind of family
[1:11:36] you would have, what that circumstance
[1:11:38] would be. And you had everything mapped
[1:11:41] out. But what you didn't realize is that
[1:11:44] long before you ever started drawing
[1:11:46] your blueprint, an architect, before you
[1:11:49] ever breathed your first breath, was
[1:11:51] already engineering every part of your
[1:11:55] life. You see, this life is not about
[1:11:58] this life. As my dad says, it's about
[1:12:00] the next life. And so everything that we
[1:12:03] go through as sons and daughters of God,
[1:12:05] everything that we take in, every
[1:12:07] experience that we have, not all good,
[1:12:11] not all bad thankfully.
[1:12:13] But you know, life sometimes is a comes
[1:12:16] in your life and you realize that life
[1:12:18] can be full of trouble, full of
[1:12:20] problems, full of sorrow, full of
[1:12:22] difficulties and sometimes full of
[1:12:26] questions. Amen. It's amazing because so
[1:12:30] many times we end up somewhere each of
[1:12:33] us in our life no matter what journey
[1:12:35] that we have and all of us would be
[1:12:37] different from the next. Somewhere in
[1:12:39] your life you'll end up with this
[1:12:41] question. Why? And we've all asked that
[1:12:44] if we'd be honest here tonight. We
[1:12:46] didn't always understand everything. Why
[1:12:48] Lord? Why did this happen? Why did I go
[1:12:51] through that? Why did you take me
[1:12:52] through this weight? Many times we say,
[1:12:55] "What did I do?" do and we start
[1:12:56] tracking our life and looking what went
[1:12:58] wrong and what mistake did I make and
[1:13:01] why did this take place. You know, it's
[1:13:03] never wrong to ask why. But the problem
[1:13:07] is is many, if I could say it this way,
[1:13:10] many people die in the why.
[1:13:14] And they never make it past that
[1:13:17] question because they never on this side
[1:13:20] many times we don't always get the
[1:13:22] answers.
[1:13:24] It's amazing because I could say this
[1:13:26] for any servant of God and all the men
[1:13:28] of God here would agree. Preachers don't
[1:13:30] have everything figured out. I hate just
[1:13:32] to let the cat out of the bag and and
[1:13:34] bust us all. But let me just bust us all
[1:13:36] and expose us all and say we don't have
[1:13:39] all the answers. I know you might think
[1:13:41] that we do. You might think that your
[1:13:43] pastor does. But many times he looks at
[1:13:45] his own life and says, "I Lord, I don't
[1:13:47] I it doesn't exactly make sense. I I I I
[1:13:50] thought that I understood what was
[1:13:51] taking place, but I really, if I'd be
[1:13:54] honest, I don't really understand what
[1:13:56] you're doing in this part of my life.
[1:13:58] Many times we go through certain things
[1:14:00] and we could look back and you could
[1:14:02] say, I still, even to this day, I don't
[1:14:05] have the answer to why this took place.
[1:14:07] Why did it happen this way? Why did it
[1:14:09] take place this way? Friends, I can just
[1:14:11] say it this way. On this side, many
[1:14:13] times you only get one side of the
[1:14:17] story.
[1:14:18] But there's coming a day when you will
[1:14:21] get the other side of your story.
[1:14:25] Hallelujah.
[1:14:27] Brother Brandon would say it this way
[1:14:28] that God's prophets don't know
[1:14:31] everything.
[1:14:34] And he said, in fact, they only know
[1:14:36] what he allows them to know. Many times,
[1:14:40] even through visions, they're trying to
[1:14:41] make sense of certain things and why it
[1:14:43] took place and they interpret it one
[1:14:45] way. But many times we don't always
[1:14:48] understand everything that happens in
[1:14:50] our life. You know, it was never it's
[1:14:53] never the trouble. It's never what
[1:14:55] happens at the beginning because the
[1:14:57] beginning is our story. It's our it's
[1:15:00] our purpose that God gave us. You take a
[1:15:02] man like Joseph and Joseph was a man who
[1:15:04] was given a dream. Now, the dream you
[1:15:07] could say was the beginning of his
[1:15:09] story. It was the promise that God had
[1:15:11] made him. It was he put all of his hope.
[1:15:14] He banked everything upon that. That was
[1:15:16] the beginning of his story. And you
[1:15:18] could say the beginning was a dream. And
[1:15:21] then we could fast forward to the very
[1:15:23] end. And here's Joseph. He's on the
[1:15:25] throne. Here's his family. And he could
[1:15:28] say these words, what the enemy meant
[1:15:31] for my evil, God has used for my good.
[1:15:36] But you know, the trouble with Joseph
[1:15:38] would never be with the beginning or
[1:15:41] with the end. But the trouble comes with
[1:15:44] what happens in the middle.
[1:15:48] And you see, this is where our struggle,
[1:15:50] if we'd be honest, really comes. It's
[1:15:53] never the promise. Listen, friends, as a
[1:15:55] believer, you will never question the
[1:15:56] word of God. You can say with all of
[1:15:59] your heart, Lord, I want to say, I am a
[1:16:02] believer of everything you have spoken.
[1:16:05] I don't doubt it. I don't question it.
[1:16:07] Why? Because that's what a believer
[1:16:09] does. He believes what God says. You
[1:16:12] don't have trouble. Your trouble will
[1:16:13] never come with believing what he spoke.
[1:16:16] But the trouble will come when you look
[1:16:18] at yourself and you look at what he
[1:16:21] spoke
[1:16:23] and then you say, "Lord, it's
[1:16:27] not exactly matching up the way I
[1:16:29] thought it would."
[1:16:32] Can we be honest here? Put your angel
[1:16:35] wings and your halos off to the side for
[1:16:37] a moment.
[1:16:39] It's never the trouble. Sarah never had
[1:16:41] trouble with believing. It was when she
[1:16:44] looked, the trouble started. When she
[1:16:46] started looking in the mirror, she seen
[1:16:48] wrinkles. She's seen age. She's seen
[1:16:50] difficulties. She's seen problems. But
[1:16:53] my Bible says, where did she get her
[1:16:55] strength? Where she could be a believer
[1:16:57] and put her foot down and say, "God is a
[1:17:00] faithful promisekeeper." You know where
[1:17:02] she drew her strength? My Bible says she
[1:17:05] considered him, not her, but him who
[1:17:08] made the promise.
[1:17:10] that he was more than able to keep his
[1:17:14] own word.
[1:17:18] And so many times we don't understand
[1:17:20] it. It's not what happens at the
[1:17:22] beginning of our story or the ending. We
[1:17:25] know where we're going. We know our
[1:17:26] destiny, but it's Lord, I've got to live
[1:17:30] with the here and now.
[1:17:35] The prophet of God would say this. I
[1:17:36] think it's so powerful. In fact, you can
[1:17:39] display if you've got it, brother. You
[1:17:40] can. If not, it's okay. I'll just read
[1:17:42] it. So amazing. Abraham Lincoln actually
[1:17:44] was the man who said these words, 16th
[1:17:46] president of the United States.
[1:17:49] Something so powerful that he said.
[1:17:52] He said, "Nearly all men can stand
[1:17:56] adversity.
[1:17:58] But if you want to test a man's
[1:18:01] character,
[1:18:03] give him power." Come on.
[1:18:07] Nearly all men can stand adversity.
[1:18:12] But if you want to test a man's
[1:18:15] character,
[1:18:18] give him power. It's incredible because
[1:18:21] we can look at this and you could see
[1:18:22] these words and you know power is a word
[1:18:25] that we all are familiar with. We all
[1:18:26] understand it really well.
[1:18:29] And it's amazing when you look down
[1:18:31] historically, there's something about
[1:18:34] power. When we look at power given,
[1:18:37] power can become like an intoxicant,
[1:18:40] like an intoxicant, a drug to many men.
[1:18:43] It can become a a a drug that they use.
[1:18:46] Let me say it this way. Power many times
[1:18:49] can reveal character in ways that
[1:18:52] nothing else can.
[1:18:55] In fact, certain traits and certain
[1:18:58] certain uh uh uh tendencies in people
[1:19:01] will never come out in their life until
[1:19:04] you place them in the position of power.
[1:19:09] You see, power would be something that
[1:19:11] would become an illumination that would
[1:19:13] light who a person really is. Listen
[1:19:16] friends, who you see is not always who
[1:19:18] they are.
[1:19:21] Hello, somebody. Let me tell you, young
[1:19:23] sisters, who they look like is not
[1:19:25] always who they are.
[1:19:28] And you could see people a lot of times
[1:19:30] and and they look the part, they talk
[1:19:32] the part, they have all the right words.
[1:19:34] But let me say it like a prophet said
[1:19:36] it. Who you really are is not all the
[1:19:39] layers you see here on the outside. But
[1:19:42] who you are is not who you are. When
[1:19:44] you're in church, there's special
[1:19:46] meetings. It's a Friday night and
[1:19:48] there's a youth camp. There's a youth
[1:19:50] meeting. There's believers. your mother,
[1:19:51] your father's there. That's not really
[1:19:53] always who you really are. I'll tell you
[1:19:56] who you really are. You are who you
[1:19:58] really are when nobody else is watching
[1:20:01] and nobody else is pulling and nobody
[1:20:04] else is there to encourage you. That's
[1:20:07] who you really are.
[1:20:10] It's been power actually without
[1:20:13] character that has led to some of the
[1:20:16] most devastating times historically.
[1:20:20] It has been power corrupted without
[1:20:22] character that would lead to the
[1:20:24] subjugation of whole races of people
[1:20:28] just because of their skin color.
[1:20:31] And we see the same exact thing today.
[1:20:33] It is power without character.
[1:20:37] When it's exercised that has led to some
[1:20:39] of the most corrupt, terrible times in
[1:20:42] history. Counterwise, we could also see
[1:20:45] that power with character has been some
[1:20:48] of what we would call the golden ages of
[1:20:51] civilization. You could think of the
[1:20:53] divin kingdom and uh even to today. They
[1:20:56] don't point to Hezekiah. They don't
[1:20:58] point to Solomon. They point back to
[1:21:00] David, the Jews, to say this was the
[1:21:02] golden era. This was the golden age
[1:21:05] because David was a man after God's own
[1:21:10] heart. Amen. Now, if you want to see how
[1:21:14] God looks at power or how God gives
[1:21:17] power, you only need to look at the life
[1:21:22] of brother David.
[1:21:24] You see, there were two versions of
[1:21:26] David. And I'll give you both of them.
[1:21:28] And then if you want, you could say
[1:21:30] which one you would rather be. The first
[1:21:32] version of David is he's got about
[1:21:34] $450,000
[1:21:36] sitting in his bank account. He's got a
[1:21:39] 4,000 ft 5,000 foot mansion. That was
[1:21:42] his guest house. About a 15,000 foot
[1:21:45] home. He has a palace. He has a castle.
[1:21:48] He has maids made servants. He has no
[1:21:51] trouble. He had Man, you say, "Brother
[1:21:53] Matt, what who are we talking about?
[1:21:55] Donald Trump?
[1:21:57] You mean I can have that kind of Listen,
[1:21:59] this was a version of David. He had no
[1:22:01] stress. He had no trouble. He had no
[1:22:04] problems. He never worried. He wasn't
[1:22:07] trying to pay the light bill. Come on,
[1:22:09] somebody.
[1:22:10] He wasn't worried where his next meal
[1:22:12] would come to. He never fredded. He
[1:22:14] never struggled. He had everything in
[1:22:17] life at his fingertips.
[1:22:21] His feet would kick back, laying in the
[1:22:23] shade, people fanning him, feeding
[1:22:25] grapes, you know, to him. Just anything
[1:22:27] he wanted to eat, anything he wanted to
[1:22:29] drink, and life was just
[1:22:33] anything he wanted.
[1:22:34] Now, that's one version of David. Let me
[1:22:36] give you the second version of David.
[1:22:38] David is hiding in a cave.
[1:22:41] There's a man trying to kill him.
[1:22:45] He hasn't slept in 13 days. He ain't had
[1:22:48] a bath in 3 months.
[1:22:53] He stinks.
[1:22:55] He's stressed. He's troubled. He's only
[1:22:57] got a few friends, not many. just a few
[1:23:00] friends hiding, running for his life.
[1:23:05] And I ask you, which David would you
[1:23:07] rather be? The David in the palace who
[1:23:10] had no trouble and no trials and no
[1:23:12] problems, or the David who was stressed
[1:23:14] and worried and running for his life?
[1:23:17] I'll tell you what, before you answer,
[1:23:18] let me tell you what your Bible says.
[1:23:20] Your Bible says that the David that had
[1:23:22] everything going his way was the most
[1:23:25] carnal, backsliden, lustful David that
[1:23:28] we read about in the Bible, but the
[1:23:30] David with trouble and trial and
[1:23:32] tribulation and problems and stress was
[1:23:35] the David who wrote the book of Psalms.
[1:23:38] He was a man after God's own heart. Oh,
[1:23:40] we ought to thank God for our trouble
[1:23:43] and our trials and our tribulations.
[1:23:47] I could hear the prophet say, "Why does
[1:23:49] God let troubles come?" God harnesses
[1:23:52] trouble, puts pits in its mouth, and
[1:23:55] makes it obey him. And can I say as my
[1:23:57] testimony and those trouble and that
[1:24:00] trial brings us into a closer fellowship
[1:24:05] with him,
[1:24:08] we look so differently at life when we
[1:24:10] pulled it in that perspective.
[1:24:13] You see, it was David who wasn't just
[1:24:16] given the kingdom,
[1:24:18] but God brought him to the school of
[1:24:22] suffering.
[1:24:25] You see, that's a word that is so
[1:24:27] foreign to our world today. Suffering.
[1:24:32] Brother Brandham says this, I think it's
[1:24:33] so powerful and you could just display
[1:24:35] that, brother. Again, I'm just going to
[1:24:36] go through some of these quotes.
[1:24:38] Prophet's quoting Romans chapter 8. Why
[1:24:41] does he stand by? And if children than
[1:24:43] heirs, heirs of God, joint hes, if so be
[1:24:45] if so be that we suffer with him. And I
[1:24:48] know I know you've read these things a
[1:24:50] hundred times, but they're just so real
[1:24:52] to me. You just let me read them. Amen.
[1:24:55] He says, "If we suffer with him that we
[1:24:59] may also be glorified together. For I
[1:25:02] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:25:06] present time are not worthy to be
[1:25:11] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:25:15] revealed in us.
[1:25:18] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:25:24] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[1:25:27] reign. The reason for this is that
[1:25:30] character simply is never made without
[1:25:37] suffering.
[1:25:40] Character is a victory.
[1:25:44] It's not a gift. And a man without
[1:25:48] character can't reign because power
[1:25:52] apart from character is satanic.
[1:25:58] But power with character
[1:26:03] is fit to rule.
[1:26:05] You say, "Brother Matt, do you believe
[1:26:07] in power?" I believe with all of my
[1:26:09] heart in power, but I'm afraid many
[1:26:11] times we have misunderstood, as the
[1:26:13] prophet said, what power really is.
[1:26:17] You say, "Brother Matt, do you believe
[1:26:18] in power?" I believe with all of my
[1:26:20] heart. Let me just say this here for a
[1:26:22] moment. When you are born again by the
[1:26:24] spirit of God, your name is as good on
[1:26:27] the check as your father's name. All
[1:26:31] heaven backs up your authority. Listen,
[1:26:33] friends, I believe with all of my heart,
[1:26:35] there's not some kind of further fourth
[1:26:37] step or fourth work of grace that God
[1:26:40] brings you to. You know, this brother
[1:26:42] over here, he's got power, but this
[1:26:44] brother's never been adopted. He don't
[1:26:45] have power. How confusing that would be
[1:26:47] tomorrow night in the prayer line if I
[1:26:48] go to pray for somebody say, "Hey,
[1:26:49] brother, brother Daryl, I'm not an
[1:26:50] adopted son yet. Can you come over here
[1:26:52] and lay lay your hands? I'm born again,
[1:26:54] but I don't have You realize how
[1:26:56] confusing that would be. Now, we
[1:26:59] understand that there's a truth to
[1:27:00] that's not even what I'm preaching on.
[1:27:01] But what I'm telling you is is that you
[1:27:03] are truly, if you are truly sealed by
[1:27:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, all
[1:27:09] heaven backs up your word.
[1:27:13] And it ain't just preachers. Oh,
[1:27:14] somebody help me preach tonight. It
[1:27:16] ain't just preachers. It ain't just
[1:27:18] great men of God. Even if you are the
[1:27:20] skin on the bottom of the feet, you've
[1:27:23] got every devil in hell subject to your
[1:27:26] word. Oh, that ought to make you shout
[1:27:29] here tonight to know that all heaven
[1:27:31] backs up your word.
[1:27:36] Yes, sir. So, I believe with all of my
[1:27:38] heart and power, but can I just say God
[1:27:42] is not just willy-nilly giving out power
[1:27:44] to everybody to perform miracles, signs,
[1:27:48] and wonders? You see, we focus so much
[1:27:51] on power, but do we talk about
[1:27:56] character? Come on.
[1:27:58] Amen.
[1:28:01] Do we realize this is what the prophet
[1:28:02] of God taught us about power? That power
[1:28:07] apart from character is satanic.
[1:28:11] Hello, somebody.
[1:28:13] And since he wants us to share even his
[1:28:16] throne on the same basis that he Oh,
[1:28:20] there's the clue. He wants us to share
[1:28:23] me, brother Matt. me on his throne. Oh
[1:28:27] yes. Know you not that the saints of God
[1:28:28] shall judge there. Even angels even the
[1:28:32] even the the the the is this is what
[1:28:34] brother Brandham is saying here that he
[1:28:35] wants us he wants us on his throne. But
[1:28:40] here's why. Here's how on the same basis
[1:28:43] that he overcame and is set down in his
[1:28:47] father's throne. Then we have to
[1:28:51] overcome to sit with him. You believe
[1:28:55] brother Madam power? I believe more than
[1:28:57] ever with God we let me just say it this
[1:28:59] way. God wants to give you more power.
[1:29:02] God is not going backwards. He ain't got
[1:29:03] a gear of reverse. In fact, he ain't
[1:29:05] even got a gear of neutral. He has one
[1:29:07] gear and that is onward press on onward.
[1:29:10] Christian soldiers, I'm not looking for
[1:29:13] less power. I'm looking for more power.
[1:29:15] But I also want to say God can't give me
[1:29:18] power until my nature matches this
[1:29:21] Bible.
[1:29:24] You see, that was the purpose of the
[1:29:26] token. The token wasn't just an
[1:29:28] experience that you have. I believe in a
[1:29:30] one-time experience, brother. But let me
[1:29:32] just say the token, the purpose of the
[1:29:35] token was so that the nature of the lamb
[1:29:40] could come back on the worshipper.
[1:29:44] You say, "What part of me, brother Matt?
[1:29:46] I believe he's transformed my soul."
[1:29:48] Listen, friends, I believe the problem
[1:29:50] is is that many people have stopped with
[1:29:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the new
[1:29:54] birth. I believe it's the new birth. But
[1:29:56] let me just say, that's not when your
[1:29:57] journey ends. That's really when your
[1:30:00] journey just begins.
[1:30:02] [Applause]
[1:30:04] And so many people make that the finish
[1:30:06] line. Listen, friends, let me just say
[1:30:08] this. God doesn't just want to transform
[1:30:10] your soul. Come on. He wants to change
[1:30:12] every part of you.
[1:30:16] See, a lot of people, okay, Lord, I came
[1:30:17] to an altar. I repented of my sins. I
[1:30:19] had an experience in the Holy Ghost. I
[1:30:20] believe I'm sealed. But that's all,
[1:30:22] Lord. And you, Brother Brandon, doors
[1:30:23] end door. Go read what the prophet of
[1:30:24] God said. He said, many times we let him
[1:30:26] in and then we keep him there.
[1:30:31] You say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[1:30:32] saying? You're saying that there's
[1:30:33] something more than just being born
[1:30:34] again?" Oh, yeah. The Holy Spirit's
[1:30:36] activity in your life is not through
[1:30:39] when you're born of the spirit of God.
[1:30:41] It's just beginning.
[1:30:45] You say, "God wants to change every part
[1:30:47] of me." Yeah, he wants to. He wants to
[1:30:49] change your personality if it doesn't
[1:30:51] match his personality. Prophet of God
[1:30:54] said it this way. Even the very human
[1:30:56] life, think about that. The human life
[1:31:00] of Jesus was to be upon the believer.
[1:31:05] his humanity.
[1:31:08] That means that your temper
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:14] that don't matter, brother Matt, how we
[1:31:15] treat each other. Don't make a bit of
[1:31:17] that. That's just Baptist denomin as
[1:31:20] long as we got an experience in the Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost. Listen, friends, I'm all for an
[1:31:22] experience. But let me say, if that
[1:31:24] experience doesn't make you humble, if
[1:31:26] that experience doesn't make you love
[1:31:28] your brother, if that experience doesn't
[1:31:29] make you a a a servant of the living
[1:31:31] God, I don't want that kind of
[1:31:33] experience. I want a miracle. You say,
[1:31:35] "You believe in miracles?" I do. But the
[1:31:37] greatest miracle that I'm looking for in
[1:31:39] my life is that this Bible and the
[1:31:42] nature of Jesus comes back upon my
[1:31:45] nature and changes every part of me.
[1:31:50] Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] your temper, your patience. Listen
[1:31:57] friends, we could go down the list. Say,
[1:31:59] God wants to change every part. He wants
[1:32:02] to free you of complexes. He wants to
[1:32:04] free you of fears. He wants to free you
[1:32:06] of any lie that you're living in your
[1:32:08] life. Say, "God wants to change that
[1:32:11] part of me. Not just my soul, but my
[1:32:13] human spirit." Yeah, he does. In fact,
[1:32:15] he wants to go further than that. He
[1:32:17] wants to change your body.
[1:32:23] Hallelujah. And I say, change it, oh
[1:32:25] God. If you got to start right here,
[1:32:27] start with my nature. Start with my
[1:32:30] temper. Start with my attitude. Start
[1:32:32] with jealousy. Start with bitterness.
[1:32:34] Clean out every part that's unlike you,
[1:32:37] Lord.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah.
[1:32:43] You see, your body will just be the
[1:32:45] final change of everything else that's
[1:32:47] changed.
[1:32:49] You love him.
[1:32:53] Power without character. Brother Brandon
[1:32:55] says, "Power with character is fit to
[1:32:56] roll." Notice this here. And the little
[1:32:58] temporary suffering we go through now is
[1:33:00] not worthy to be compared. I love this.
[1:33:03] It's not worthy to be compared to the
[1:33:05] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:33:07] in us when he comes. Oh, what treasures
[1:33:10] are laid up for those who are willing
[1:33:12] into his to who are willing to enter
[1:33:14] into his kingdom through much
[1:33:17] tribulation.
[1:33:18] Think it not strange concerning the
[1:33:20] fiery trials that are to try you. It's
[1:33:22] what Peter said. Is it strange? Is it
[1:33:24] strange? I love the way Brother Brandham
[1:33:26] says that that God wants us to develop a
[1:33:29] Christlike character that comes through
[1:33:33] shouting, screaming, speaking in
[1:33:36] tongues, dancing.
[1:33:39] I'm all for all of that.
[1:33:43] But this is how God gives power. Amen.
[1:33:49] Is it strange? He wants to develop
[1:33:51] Christlike character through suffering.
[1:33:56] No, sir. And we all have trials. You
[1:34:00] want to put your hand up there and
[1:34:01] identify? I'm here, brother Bam. I'm
[1:34:04] right with you. Come on, somebody. Don't
[1:34:06] Don't leave them down. I said we all
[1:34:08] have trials. How many of you have a
[1:34:10] trial you're going through right now? We
[1:34:11] all have trials. We're all Yes, brother.
[1:34:15] tried and chasened his sons, not one but
[1:34:18] goes through it. And the church that is
[1:34:22] not suffering
[1:34:25] is the church I want to be a part of.
[1:34:31] Where's it at, brother Matt? Where's it
[1:34:33] at? I'll move my family. I'll sell my
[1:34:35] business. A church that's not suffering.
[1:34:39] Oh, buddy. You mean no problems, no
[1:34:41] issues, no tr no troubles?
[1:34:44] Ain't it amazing how much we try to
[1:34:46] photoshop and create perfect lives and
[1:34:49] perfect churches and perfect people and
[1:34:51] perfect preachers? Listen, if you're
[1:34:53] looking for a perfect preacher, you
[1:34:54] might as well leave now. But if you want
[1:34:56] to know a preacher who's got a perfect
[1:34:58] God and a perfect savior and his word is
[1:35:00] perfect and he can take that which is
[1:35:02] imperfect and through the foolishness of
[1:35:04] preaching could bring perfection.
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:08] Amen.
[1:35:09] The church that is not suffering. Oh
[1:35:12] man, where's that church at? I would
[1:35:15] love to find it. You will be looking for
[1:35:17] the rest of your life. If it's a true
[1:35:21] church of God, that is.
[1:35:24] You see the church that is not
[1:35:26] suffering. Oh, but brother Matt, I
[1:35:28] thought we was supposed to have a
[1:35:28] perfect life. No blemishes, no trouble,
[1:35:31] you know, perfect people, you know, just
[1:35:33] perfect lives, perfect marriages,
[1:35:35] perfect pastor, perfect everything.
[1:35:38] Isn't it so amazing this this way we try
[1:35:40] to look for in the cursed part of the of
[1:35:42] the of the world and we live on this
[1:35:44] side of eternity, yet we're still
[1:35:46] looking for some Eden experience.
[1:35:49] Listen, I believe we can have a true
[1:35:50] spiritually need Eden experience. But
[1:35:52] many times people look for an Eden
[1:35:54] experience, you know, an eat and a
[1:35:55] perfect church with no trouble and no
[1:35:58] trials and no problems and I'll just
[1:36:00] move and many people pack up. They think
[1:36:02] all my church is just full of them. And
[1:36:03] so they go from the next church to the
[1:36:05] next church to the next church to the
[1:36:07] next church. Yeah, I know y'all don't
[1:36:09] have anybody like that, do you, brother
[1:36:10] Donnie?
[1:36:12] looking for perfection when we don't
[1:36:15] realize because many times we so bad
[1:36:18] think oh well you know I'm just going to
[1:36:21] be you know uh uh disqualified you know
[1:36:23] and and and so let me just say this
[1:36:25] friends I'll just go ahead and say it
[1:36:26] how I feel it some you you you if you
[1:36:28] want to know what kind of people to
[1:36:30] surround yourself with don't try to
[1:36:32] surround yourself with people who have
[1:36:34] this perfect image and perfect life and
[1:36:36] everything looks like they got it all
[1:36:38] together and never have questions they
[1:36:40] and never question They got all the
[1:36:41] message figured out. They have all the
[1:36:43] answers. They can just answer all of
[1:36:45] your problem. Don't those are not the
[1:36:46] kind of people that will ever do you any
[1:36:48] good. But why don't you get around
[1:36:50] somebody who's went through tribulation
[1:36:52] and trouble and problems, but they came
[1:36:55] out on the other side and said, "If God
[1:36:58] brought me through it, brother, he'll
[1:36:59] bring you through it, too." Hallelujah.
[1:37:06] Those are the kind of men of God that
[1:37:07] can help you.
[1:37:11] But we want perfect life and no
[1:37:12] blemishes. I'm so so glad that we had a
[1:37:15] prophet who wasn't afraid and ashamed to
[1:37:18] be transparent before us. Tennessee, you
[1:37:21] know, in many places he talked about a
[1:37:23] woman. I was reading the other day, a
[1:37:24] Indian woman who was trying to do
[1:37:26] miracles. And brother Brandham knew it.
[1:37:27] She was just trying to make money,
[1:37:28] trying to get people to come to India.
[1:37:30] And brother Brandham said, "I knew the
[1:37:31] whole thing was a sham." And he started
[1:37:33] critic. Imagine here's a woman with not
[1:37:35] a real gift of God robbing people out of
[1:37:38] their money, their life savings, and
[1:37:40] brother Brandham starts criticizing
[1:37:42] that. Now, you think, "Wow, I'd
[1:37:44] criticize that, too." Here's what
[1:37:45] Brother Brandham said. Brother Brandham
[1:37:46] says, "You pray for me because I can't
[1:37:48] criticize that. If I do, I'll lose my
[1:37:52] favor with God."
[1:37:57] And somehow we think it's okay to
[1:37:59] criticize each other, criticize our
[1:38:01] pastor.
[1:38:08] You see, God cares. Can I just say God
[1:38:11] cares about those things.
[1:38:17] Let me go on.
[1:38:19] The church that is not suffering, is not
[1:38:22] being tried, hasn't got it. It isn't of
[1:38:26] God. You say, "Brother Matt, that was
[1:38:28] the Sermonian age, and they had to go
[1:38:30] through suffering. We're not going to go
[1:38:31] through I I believe with all my heart I
[1:38:33] absolutely brother Brandham said that
[1:38:35] the bride doesn't go through the
[1:38:36] tribulation. Why would a man love a
[1:38:37] woman? Take his wife and send her
[1:38:39] through persecution feast of trumpets
[1:38:40] 64. I believe all of that. But let me
[1:38:42] tell you what the prophet of God also
[1:38:43] says in the next quote. This special
[1:38:46] condition in Samra must be applied to
[1:38:51] Hello. Say it again.
[1:38:53] There is no age free from it. There is
[1:38:56] no true believer free from it. This is
[1:39:01] of God. It is needful.
[1:39:07] We need the Lord to teach us. Yes, we
[1:39:09] do. That we are to suffer and be
[1:39:13] Christlike
[1:39:15] in doing it.
[1:39:20] But we want the power. If I had a big
[1:39:21] red staples, what was it? The Staples
[1:39:23] easy button. Man, if I had a big red
[1:39:25] button here, Brother Donnie, and I said,
[1:39:27] if you could just come up here and push
[1:39:28] this button, you push it, man, you'll
[1:39:30] have all the power of God, you'll be
[1:39:32] able to speak to your family, cure all
[1:39:35] your problems, save all your kids,
[1:39:37] deliver yourself of all sickness, man,
[1:39:39] there'd be a stampede here in this
[1:39:41] church to come and push that red button.
[1:39:43] But what if I told you before you push
[1:39:45] it, before that there's power, there's
[1:39:47] got to be character. And before there
[1:39:49] can be character, there's got to be
[1:39:51] suffering. And through suffering,
[1:39:52] there's going to be a test. There's
[1:39:54] going to be a trial. There's going to be
[1:39:55] a problem. There's going to be a
[1:39:57] circumstance you got to go through.
[1:40:01] See, brother Matt, are you asking God
[1:40:03] for suffering? Nobody. My hands are
[1:40:06] tight down. But here's what I know. If I
[1:40:09] want power and I want to be like God,
[1:40:11] how many times have we prayed and said,
[1:40:13] "Lord, I want to be more like you. I
[1:40:15] want to be greater in your image. I want
[1:40:17] to do more for you." This is the way God
[1:40:20] brings it to pass in our life.
[1:40:25] Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:31] It'd be through some of those times in
[1:40:34] our life
[1:40:36] when it doesn't all make sense and you
[1:40:39] question things in your life and think,
[1:40:41] Lord, why am I going through this thing?
[1:40:43] Why did this happen? It would be through
[1:40:46] through some of those servants who have
[1:40:48] lived for God and they've had to suffer
[1:40:51] hard things, suffer through deep trials
[1:40:55] and tribulations and tests many times
[1:40:59] not understanding what is God even doing
[1:41:01] in my life?
[1:41:03] Why did this happen? Why did I go
[1:41:05] through it, Lord?
[1:41:08] And so many times some of the things
[1:41:10] that that happened to us, we don't
[1:41:12] understand. You know,
[1:41:15] back in 2013, actually, years ago now,
[1:41:19] was having your pastor, Brother Donnie,
[1:41:20] come and preach meetings.
[1:41:23] And and and I'll never forget that that
[1:41:25] week as I woke up sometime about 4:00 in
[1:41:29] the morning, Thursday, I think it was,
[1:41:31] just right before the meeting started on
[1:41:33] a Friday. And I I remember I got up to
[1:41:36] use the the the restroom and and and the
[1:41:38] next thing I know to get out of bed, I
[1:41:39] was laying on the ground filling the
[1:41:42] carpet around, thought, "What is
[1:41:43] happening?" Turned over and looked up in
[1:41:45] the dark room and never forget so vivid
[1:41:48] that entire room was just spinning as
[1:41:50] fast as I couldn't even make out the
[1:41:51] ceiling fan. Thought I was having a
[1:41:53] heart attack. And the fear and the
[1:41:55] anxiety gripped me so much I just I I
[1:41:58] blacked out. Just passed right out there
[1:42:00] on the floor. remember I woke up
[1:42:02] sweating and cold and and I looked up
[1:42:04] and the whole room was just moving and I
[1:42:07] didn't know what to do. I started
[1:42:08] crawling from my bedroom out to the
[1:42:11] hallway and to the living room and
[1:42:13] crawled up there on the couch.
[1:42:16] Remember I pulled myself up there and
[1:42:18] I'm just crying out to God saying,
[1:42:19] "Lord, I don't know what's happening. I
[1:42:21] don't know if I've had a stroke. I don't
[1:42:22] know if I'm have what what is happening,
[1:42:24] if I'm dying, what this is." But I
[1:42:26] remember the whole room was just
[1:42:28] spinning as fast as it could. And and
[1:42:30] the stress of that situation just became
[1:42:32] so great that I just lost consciousness
[1:42:35] again. And and the next thing I know, it
[1:42:38] was morning. My wife was waking me. And
[1:42:40] why are you on the couch? And and and I
[1:42:43] just remember as soon as I woke up, I
[1:42:45] looked up and she was just moving left
[1:42:46] and right just as fast. Couldn't even
[1:42:48] hardly make her out, make make her face
[1:42:50] out. And and I and I and I just said, "I
[1:42:52] don't know. Something something's
[1:42:54] happened." And and and I just remember
[1:42:56] in my right ear, I could just I could
[1:42:58] just hear just like almost like you had
[1:43:00] your if you was to take a sea shell and
[1:43:02] you just hear that, you know, that
[1:43:04] whooshing sound. And I I knew that
[1:43:07] something was wrong. I didn't know what
[1:43:08] it was. And
[1:43:12] friends, can I just say this? I feel
[1:43:13] this feel the Holy Spirit so strong.
[1:43:15] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:19] Life can change like that. That's right.
[1:43:27] And you're just cruising on autopilot
[1:43:29] and your life you think will just go one
[1:43:30] way and then suddenly everything that
[1:43:33] you just took little simple things that
[1:43:34] you take for granted
[1:43:37] and life just in an instant and in a
[1:43:40] moment life is different never the same.
[1:43:48] I I I say that with such sincerity
[1:43:51] that at that moment I I I remember I I I
[1:43:55] couldn't hear very well out of my right
[1:43:57] ear and and and I just I just didn't
[1:44:00] know what was happening. I thought I I'm
[1:44:02] not really sure what's going on. I I I I
[1:44:04] just thought, man, it must be wax or
[1:44:06] buildup. So, I did something really
[1:44:08] crazy I would never recommend. I went
[1:44:09] and bought one of those. You ever heard
[1:44:10] of those ear candles,
[1:44:13] man? Talking about a like a torture
[1:44:16] device. And believe it or not, you take
[1:44:18] this thing and I know it's going to
[1:44:20] sound crazy. You stick it in your ear
[1:44:21] and you light it on fire.
[1:44:26] So I lit that thing on fire and man, it
[1:44:28] starts pulling out the buddy. I don't
[1:44:30] mean to gross you out, brother David,
[1:44:31] but stuff came out of my head I never
[1:44:33] could imagine could have ever fit there.
[1:44:36] I mean, it was so great. I was taking
[1:44:37] pictures of it. I couldn't believe it.
[1:44:40] I thought, "Oh, buddy, we have found the
[1:44:43] problem."
[1:44:46] And uh but it didn't seem to do any
[1:44:48] better. I called might have been you,
[1:44:49] Brother Arvin. I can't remember if it
[1:44:50] was you, Brother Andrew. And I said, "I
[1:44:52] don't know what's going on. I could you
[1:44:54] look at me?" You know, and and so I I I
[1:44:56] forget if that was what night that was,
[1:44:58] but I went and and and and the brother
[1:45:00] looked at me and he took his, you know,
[1:45:01] that tool they got with the glass and
[1:45:03] the little light. And he I remember I
[1:45:06] forget he shined his light in there
[1:45:07] said, "Wow, man, your ear is clean."
[1:45:11] I said, "Yeah, I know. Take care of my
[1:45:13] ears.
[1:45:17] He said, "Man, it's whistly clean. Boy,
[1:45:19] goodness, ain't no wax in there." I
[1:45:21] said, "Yeah." And and so he said, "Well,
[1:45:23] you know, it could who knows what it
[1:45:24] could be? Could be just a, you know, ear
[1:45:26] infection of some kind and it was it was
[1:45:28] the weekend. You couldn't get to a
[1:45:29] doctor said on Monday you're probably
[1:45:30] going to want to go seen." And but it
[1:45:32] just seemed like from there it just got
[1:45:33] worse and worse and worse. And before
[1:45:36] you knew it, I couldn't even the vertigo
[1:45:37] was so bad. I couldn't walk at all. I
[1:45:39] had to be helped anywhere I'd go. I
[1:45:40] couldn't I couldn't walk and keep my
[1:45:42] balance. You know, balance is something
[1:45:43] you ought to thank God for that you're
[1:45:45] able to even stand up on your two feet
[1:45:48] cuz you can lose it. And when you do,
[1:45:50] buddy, you know what you lost.
[1:45:54] And uh and and I never forget there the
[1:45:56] the the that whooing sound just left and
[1:45:59] it went to just to a loud ring. It was
[1:46:02] tenitis, tonitis, however you want to
[1:46:03] call it. Loud loud ring that was louder
[1:46:06] than any everything else. And I I just
[1:46:09] couldn't hear. I I knew something was
[1:46:11] wrong. Uh, my phone could ring on the
[1:46:14] left, just right in front of me. And if
[1:46:15] my eyes wasn't looking at my phone, I
[1:46:18] thought it was in the next room, the
[1:46:19] kitchen. I couldn't tell where it was.
[1:46:20] I'd speak to my wife. She'd have to tell
[1:46:22] me, I'm in I'm in this room cuz I
[1:46:24] couldn't locate. It's actually
[1:46:25] physically impossible to localize sound
[1:46:28] without two ears. It's impossible. You
[1:46:30] don't you take that for granted. It's
[1:46:32] the same as vision. Without two eyes,
[1:46:33] you have no perception of depth. And so,
[1:46:36] I I couldn't figure out where sounds
[1:46:37] were coming from. And it was just a you
[1:46:40] know I and and and life I never forget
[1:46:43] in that moment trying to lay there and
[1:46:45] on the couch and just try to be normal
[1:46:47] in my mind not really knowing what is
[1:46:49] happening what's going on. That night we
[1:46:51] started services and brother Donnie was
[1:46:54] preaching and I remember I couldn't walk
[1:46:55] but I just wanted to be at church. I had
[1:46:58] I forget who it was come and get me,
[1:47:00] load me up in the car, take me to church
[1:47:02] and I said just put me in the sound
[1:47:03] booth and I laid back there in that
[1:47:06] sound booth just laid on the floor. No
[1:47:07] one could even see me. I just wanted to
[1:47:08] be in church so bad. And they brought me
[1:47:11] up there and laid hands on me, prayed
[1:47:14] for me, anointed me with oil. And I'll
[1:47:16] never forget Monday, I went the next day
[1:47:18] and I went to the ENT. And I and I go
[1:47:22] into that room and the aiologist says,
[1:47:24] "First, we're going to take a hearing
[1:47:25] test." And so they put me in that
[1:47:27] soundproof room. Yeah. Anybody ever had
[1:47:28] that have a hearing test? Some of you
[1:47:31] raise your hand. Don't make me Okay,
[1:47:32] good. I'm not alone in this. You know
[1:47:34] what I'm talking about. in that
[1:47:36] soundproof room, you know, and and and
[1:47:38] it's insulated and I got those, you
[1:47:40] know, the the things they put in my ear
[1:47:41] and I got this little clicker. He said,
[1:47:42] "All right, we're going to test your ear
[1:47:43] and you know when you hear these sounds,
[1:47:45] you're going to click it." So there it
[1:47:46] was, man. Beep click, beep, click, beep,
[1:47:49] click. You're just clicking, clicking,
[1:47:51] clicking, clicking with every frequency
[1:47:52] they go through. Hey man, you see, you
[1:47:54] know, it's every clicking away. He says,
[1:47:56] "All right, Mr. Watkins, we're going to
[1:47:57] we're going to test your your right ear
[1:47:58] now." And he says, "I I I want you to if
[1:48:01] you hear anything, just start clicking."
[1:48:02] So, I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.
[1:48:06] Finally, he opens the door. He said,
[1:48:07] "You did you didn't hear you didn't hear
[1:48:09] anything." "Hey, let's try it again." I
[1:48:10] said, "Okay, go ahead. I I thought he
[1:48:12] maybe didn't start it." And here it was
[1:48:15] again. Nothing.
[1:48:18] And so, he he opened the door and real
[1:48:20] somber look on his said, "Come with me,
[1:48:22] Mr. Watkins. Dr. Christian will see
[1:48:23] you." So, I go back there to that room
[1:48:25] and I, you know, just remember the
[1:48:27] confusion of what's happening and why
[1:48:28] was he concerned and this is, you know,
[1:48:30] you think this will go away.
[1:48:32] Okay, it'll come back. Things will be
[1:48:33] normal. You know, surely, you know, I'm
[1:48:35] only 30 something years old. As I'm too
[1:48:37] young to have problems like this,
[1:48:38] nothing will, you know, it's going to
[1:48:40] why why does he look worried? You know,
[1:48:41] my mind starts to mind battles start to
[1:48:43] come and you start to feel that anxiety
[1:48:45] and that pressure think what's going on.
[1:48:46] And and so I remember Dr. Christian
[1:48:49] opened the door with this clipboard.
[1:48:51] He said, Mr. Watkins, he said, I got
[1:48:53] good news and he said, I got bad news.
[1:48:55] Which one you want first? I said, I'll
[1:48:57] take the bad first. He said, "You have
[1:48:59] sudden sense of neuro hearing loss, also
[1:49:01] known as sudden deafness in your right
[1:49:04] ear." And he said, "It affects 6,000 US
[1:49:06] citizens roughly on average every single
[1:49:09] year. It's what they call an idiopathic
[1:49:11] disease, which simply means they're
[1:49:13] ignorant of why it happens, how to treat
[1:49:15] it, what to do, why did it take place."
[1:49:17] They have theories, think it was a a
[1:49:19] cold or something that struck the audio
[1:49:22] nerve. The audio nerve sits in a bone,
[1:49:23] it swelled, and then it died. And and he
[1:49:25] says, "I hate to tell you," said there's
[1:49:27] different severities with it. And he
[1:49:29] says, "There's certain DB that you can
[1:49:30] lose." And he says, "In many people, we
[1:49:33] can give steroids. They can get some
[1:49:34] hearing back, some all hearing back."
[1:49:36] Unfortunately, Mr. Watkins, in your
[1:49:38] case, he said, "Whenever there is more
[1:49:40] than 40 dB of loss and vertigo, we don't
[1:49:43] know why, but whenever it's associated
[1:49:45] with vertigo," he said it this way. He
[1:49:46] said, "There is no statistic to
[1:49:48] recovery, there's no way you'll ever get
[1:49:49] hearing back. I'm sorry to tell you
[1:49:51] that." And he said, 'You actually have
[1:49:54] more than 80 dB of loss. You have
[1:49:57] devastating hearing loss.
[1:50:01] And he said, 'But the good news is is
[1:50:03] that mostly you you can live a normal
[1:50:05] life. He said, you know, I give you
[1:50:07] hearing aid, but it only amplifies
[1:50:08] what's there and you have nothing there.
[1:50:09] He said, you you'll struggle socially.
[1:50:11] You won't want to be in big crowds. You
[1:50:13] won't want to be in any you want to have
[1:50:15] smaller settings and you won't want to
[1:50:16] go into rooms without noise treatment in
[1:50:18] loud areas. And he said, socially,
[1:50:20] you're going to struggle. He said, "The
[1:50:22] tonitis won't get better. It could, but
[1:50:24] it most likely won't." And he says,
[1:50:26] "You'll get you'll be able to walk
[1:50:27] again. The vertigo will go away." And
[1:50:29] and you and and I dealt with it for
[1:50:31] months after benign positional vertigo.
[1:50:33] And and uh and and so he just said, you
[1:50:36] know, and and that's it. And and we're
[1:50:38] sorry, but if you ever feel sorry for
[1:50:40] yourself, come to my office and I'll
[1:50:41] show you people who have no hearing at
[1:50:43] all. Your problem's only how big it is
[1:50:46] with perspective of other people's
[1:50:47] problems.
[1:50:50] And uh and I'll never forget uh that
[1:50:53] feeling of that's it. We'll see you in
[1:50:55] 30 days. We'll discharge you. It'll be
[1:50:57] over.
[1:50:58] And he walked out.
[1:51:02] I'll never forget the the the feeling
[1:51:06] of just being totally alone
[1:51:08] with my own problem that no one else
[1:51:11] could hear, no one else could see. You
[1:51:13] look at me, it doesn't look any
[1:51:14] different.
[1:51:17] And boy, the devil starts turning the
[1:51:19] screws on your mind.
[1:51:22] I remember going there laying at home
[1:51:24] there and trying to believe, trying to
[1:51:26] have faith. As many times it's easy to
[1:51:28] have faith for others, sometimes it's so
[1:51:29] hard to believe for yourself.
[1:51:32] And I remember I laid there, I was on
[1:51:33] the couch and just discouraged,
[1:51:35] fighting. I'm an optimistic person. Hard
[1:51:37] hard to get down. Always see the glass
[1:51:39] half full. Take it after my dad, the
[1:51:41] eternal optimist. And I I really
[1:51:43] couldn't get down. But, you know, it
[1:51:45] really started weighing on me.
[1:51:49] Life is never going to be the same.
[1:51:50] You'll never hear your children the
[1:51:51] same. You'll never live life the same.
[1:51:53] You won't be able to preach anymore. How
[1:51:54] could you preach like that? How could
[1:51:56] even in church? You're going to suffer.
[1:51:57] And and and and then weeks turned into
[1:52:00] months. And and I remember I was laying
[1:52:02] on my couch that night. I'd helped a
[1:52:05] little church set up. Maybe I think it
[1:52:06] was their live streaming or whatever it
[1:52:08] was. And and I wasn't there. I was at
[1:52:10] home on a Wednesday night. And a brother
[1:52:13] text me says, "Brother Matt, I know
[1:52:14] you're in church." He says, "Maybe could
[1:52:16] you get on and check our stream? We're
[1:52:17] having this problem." And and I remember
[1:52:19] I just I wasn't in church. I pulled it
[1:52:21] up and the pastor was out there and he
[1:52:23] was already talking and he said, "You
[1:52:26] you you people at the church, you know
[1:52:27] this brother." He named him. He said,
[1:52:28] "You know, sometimes the Lord gives him
[1:52:30] a word and and he he's a real unassuming
[1:52:32] brother, real humble." He said, "He
[1:52:34] doesn't make himself anything, but he
[1:52:36] came to me about 3 months ago and he
[1:52:37] gave me a little sticky note with
[1:52:38] something on it." And he said and he
[1:52:40] said and I he told me you know that
[1:52:42] brother this is for somebody and he said
[1:52:44] so I just put it on my desk thought it
[1:52:45] was for me maybe maybe it's for me maybe
[1:52:48] I'll understand it. And he said well
[1:52:49] tonight that brother came to me and he
[1:52:52] said brother I got to tell you the Lord
[1:52:54] told me that sticky note is not for you.
[1:52:56] It's for somebody else. They're going to
[1:52:58] hear it tonight. You've got to read that
[1:53:00] note tonight.
[1:53:03] Boy, I was listening with my one ear. I
[1:53:06] was listening as hard as I could.
[1:53:09] And he says, "So I don't know who you
[1:53:10] are." And he says, 'But I'm just going
[1:53:12] to read it. And he says, 'You take it
[1:53:14] from the Lord if it's for you.' He
[1:53:16] started reading these words when I
[1:53:18] cannot understand
[1:53:24] my father's leading
[1:53:28] and it seems to be but hard
[1:53:32] and a cruel fate.
[1:53:39] Still I hear
[1:53:41] that gentle whisper ever pleading,
[1:53:44] "God is working.
[1:53:47] God is faithful.
[1:53:49] Only wait."
[1:53:54] Never forget, I just started to weep
[1:53:55] there on the couch. My wife came home.
[1:53:58] She said, "What's wrong?" I said, "I
[1:53:59] know these are happy tears." I said, "I
[1:54:01] got to tell you what just happened." She
[1:54:02] said, "Do you not realize on the
[1:54:04] refrigerator what I put out of my little
[1:54:06] devotional she reads from a 19 1800s
[1:54:09] author?" And she wrote the very same
[1:54:11] exact thing on the refrigerator. I think
[1:54:13] it was that day when I can't understand
[1:54:15] my father's leading, and it seems to be
[1:54:17] but a hard and cruel fate. Still, I hear
[1:54:19] that gentle whisper of pleading. God is
[1:54:23] working.
[1:54:24] God is faithful.
[1:54:27] Only wait.
[1:54:30] Amen.
[1:54:34] I went through that month had another
[1:54:36] meeting there and brother Tim Pru,
[1:54:38] brother Timothy Pru was by I think it
[1:54:39] was they prayed for me just believing
[1:54:41] God was going to do something and and I
[1:54:43] I I went to the doctors my 30-day
[1:54:45] whatever it was discharge visit there to
[1:54:48] to to be discharged as a patient. I
[1:54:50] walked into that that that aiologist and
[1:54:53] the the aiologist said, "Sir, I I'm so
[1:54:55] sorry, Mr. Watkins said it's it's
[1:54:56] protocol. We got to do another hearing
[1:54:58] test." I said, "No, I want to do another
[1:54:59] hearing test." Amen. He said, "Okay,
[1:55:02] well, sure. You come on in then." So, he
[1:55:04] comes over, he puts his, you know, left
[1:55:06] ear, click, click, click, and he says,
[1:55:08] "All right, Mr. Watkins, I'm going to
[1:55:09] now test your right ear." I remember
[1:55:10] there in that room, I just bowed my
[1:55:12] head. I said, "Lord, I believe your word
[1:55:14] with all of my heart, and it does not
[1:55:17] matter what happens. That has nothing to
[1:55:19] do with it. I'm still a believer. You're
[1:55:21] still a healer. It changes nothing. The
[1:55:24] result changes nothing, Lord."
[1:55:28] And I waited and it wasn't like the left
[1:55:31] ear, but there it was. Beep click beep
[1:55:34] click beep click beep click. He came
[1:55:38] busting that door. He said, "Mr.
[1:55:39] Watkins, you heard that? Well, I want to
[1:55:42] test your your your discretion." He
[1:55:43] said, "I'm going to say 20 words." And
[1:55:45] he said, "I want you, if you could say
[1:55:47] anything you think I say, I want you to
[1:55:49] repeat after me 20 words out of 20,
[1:55:51] brother Donnie, I got 18 out of 20 words
[1:55:53] right." Hallelujah.
[1:55:56] Hallelujah.
[1:56:02] Nothing is too hard for the Lord.
[1:56:07] I walked into that office and Dr.
[1:56:09] Christian threw his clipboard. He said,
[1:56:11] "You proved me wrong. I have no
[1:56:12] explanation for what happened." He said,
[1:56:14] "You're not supposed to hear anything.
[1:56:16] I'm not trying to give you a false
[1:56:17] hope." I said, "But I wanted to say, you
[1:56:19] didn't give me any hope, doctor. My hope
[1:56:21] was in Jesus the whole time and my hope
[1:56:24] today is still in Jesus.
[1:56:28] Hallelujah.
[1:56:32] You say, "Brother Matt, why do you tell
[1:56:33] that?" Not just to give you faith, but
[1:56:35] to let you realize it doesn't always
[1:56:38] make sense.
[1:56:42] Even today, I don't have perfect
[1:56:43] hearing. I Lord gave me back between 50
[1:56:46] and 60 decimals or something like that.
[1:56:49] I don't hear perfectly out of my right
[1:56:50] ear, but I believe what God started, God
[1:56:53] will finish what he started in your
[1:56:57] life. God is not just a starter. He's a
[1:57:00] finisher of what he starts.
[1:57:08] It didn't always make sense. Didn't make
[1:57:10] sense to the disciples. They could not
[1:57:13] comprehend. How could a man who's chosen
[1:57:17] of God suffer? How? It doesn't make
[1:57:21] sense. How if you're called of God, if
[1:57:23] you're chosen of God, how could you go
[1:57:24] through suffering physically, bodily?
[1:57:27] Even the Apostle Paul knew this, wrote
[1:57:28] letters and saying, "Don't, you know,
[1:57:30] don't be troubled by my afflictions.
[1:57:32] Don't be troubled by my that that they
[1:57:34] arrest me, throw me into prison. I was
[1:57:36] ordained. I was destined for this." But
[1:57:39] they couldn't understand. Job's
[1:57:41] comforters, his friends couldn't
[1:57:43] understand. They could not make sense.
[1:57:46] How could a man who's called of God
[1:57:49] suffer?
[1:57:51] Is this not what Jesus was told us in
[1:57:53] Mark chap John chapter nine? When the
[1:57:55] man who was born blind, you remember
[1:57:57] that story? And he was born from birth,
[1:58:00] he was born blind. You know what the
[1:58:02] disciples ask? Think of the first thing
[1:58:04] that they go to when they see a a child
[1:58:08] who is suffering without a reason. He
[1:58:11] was born that way. And the first thing
[1:58:13] they ask him, "Lord,
[1:58:16] why was this boy born blind? Was it his
[1:58:21] father's sin or perhaps his mother's
[1:58:25] sin?" You see, they tried to much like
[1:58:28] us equate if I'm called of God, then I
[1:58:32] could never go through this. If I'm
[1:58:33] called of God, if I really had faith
[1:58:36] when I asked in prayer, God would have
[1:58:38] healed her. God would have healed him.
[1:58:40] They would not that would not have
[1:58:41] happened in my life. This is how we
[1:58:43] treat the promises of God.
[1:58:46] And immediately when it's when a prayer
[1:58:48] goes instead of a yes, it's a no. We
[1:58:50] say, "Well, there was something wrong
[1:58:51] with me. Something was wrong with my
[1:58:52] faith." like that little woman. You
[1:58:55] know, brother Brandon, did I not have
[1:58:56] enough faith? Yes, sister. You had great
[1:58:58] faith.
[1:59:00] Why was he born blind? Was it his
[1:59:03] mother? Was it his father? Oh, I love
[1:59:06] the words of Jesus when he says,
[1:59:09] "Neither was it his father or his
[1:59:12] mother?" But I want to tell you, there
[1:59:14] is nothing you can go through in your
[1:59:16] life, no suffering, no sickness, no
[1:59:19] trial, no sorrow that doesn't have this
[1:59:21] one purpose. that the works of God might
[1:59:25] be made manifest in your life.
[1:59:29] Hallelujah. You ought to shout right
[1:59:31] there and say, "Nothing that the devil
[1:59:33] could bring in my life has this purpose
[1:59:38] that God could be made manifest in my
[1:59:41] life." Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] You see, there's nothing you can go
[1:59:47] through in this life that doesn't have
[1:59:50] this purpose. And God knows what he's
[1:59:55] doing.
[1:59:59] God knows what he's doing.
[2:00:04] Then why is it happening, Job?
[2:00:09] Why is it happening? Come on, Job. Tell
[2:00:13] us.
[2:00:14] Let me tell you something. These friends
[2:00:17] are no friends at all.
[2:00:21] Come on, Job. Come on, buddy. It's okay.
[2:00:24] And for 30 chapters, they scrutinized
[2:00:28] him, questioned him.
[2:00:31] Come on, Job. Tell us, Job. Come on,
[2:00:32] fess up, Job. It'll be We'll still be
[2:00:34] your friends. We'll still love you. Tell
[2:00:37] us, Job. Why? No man goes if God could.
[2:00:40] You lost your family. You lost your
[2:00:42] wife. Your wife's wanting you to deny
[2:00:44] him. You lost your children in a
[2:00:46] tornado. Job, come on. That doesn't just
[2:00:48] happen to sons and daughters of God.
[2:00:51] No son of God could ever be called that
[2:00:52] way. And be really, Job, it's got to be
[2:00:54] some kind of sin in your life, Job. Come
[2:00:56] on. Tell us why. You know what the
[2:01:00] problem was? Job didn't know.
[2:01:07] He didn't love to give them an answer.
[2:01:10] But even he struggled with this
[2:01:14] question.
[2:01:17] Was doing everything right. I was living
[2:01:19] life just going my own way making
[2:01:22] sacrifices to God. I don't understand.
[2:01:26] You see what you will never find in your
[2:01:29] Bible. You will never find that before
[2:01:31] God ever put Job through anything, he
[2:01:34] sat him down and said, "All right, Job,
[2:01:35] take a seat. Now listen, buddy. He's
[2:01:38] about to go through some terrible
[2:01:39] things, Job. I You're about to go
[2:01:41] through some big problems. But I just
[2:01:42] want you to know, Job, it's me. Job,
[2:01:45] you're going to go through some
[2:01:45] difficulties, but just know, Job, before
[2:01:48] you ever face it. I just want you to
[2:01:50] know, Job, you can trust me that it's me
[2:01:52] doing it, Job. It'll all work out for
[2:01:54] you. Good.
[2:01:56] You will not find that in your Bible.
[2:02:01] You see, many side and many times, as I
[2:02:03] said, we only get one side of the story.
[2:02:05] It's sort of like, you know, a phone
[2:02:07] call. You answer the the phone and
[2:02:09] you're just hearing from one side of
[2:02:11] that phone call. You say, "Hello."
[2:02:14] Oh. Oh, congratulations.
[2:02:19] Congratulations. Is it? You love it. You
[2:02:22] love it. How much does it weigh? Oh, is
[2:02:25] it beautiful? Oh, is it diesel or fuel
[2:02:29] injected?
[2:02:35] You say, "Wait, what just happened,
[2:02:36] Brother David? You thought you knew what
[2:02:39] was h Oh, I hope you catch it here
[2:02:40] tonight. You thought you knew what God
[2:02:42] was doing. You had it all figured out.
[2:02:44] But he had another plan. He was working
[2:02:47] in another dimension. And it was all for
[2:02:50] your glory.
[2:02:53] Hallelujah.
[2:02:58] Hallelujah.
[2:03:01] You see, God would love, he would have
[2:03:03] loved to tell Job. You think even when
[2:03:06] Lazarus dies, he would have loved,
[2:03:08] that's why he he wept. He seen the
[2:03:10] suffering that Martha and Mary was
[2:03:12] going. He would have loved to tell them,
[2:03:14] but he knew they wanted a healing, but
[2:03:18] God wanted a resurrection.
[2:03:22] Oh, so many times we want a healing. And
[2:03:24] God saying, "I want to bring something
[2:03:26] greater out of your life than just a
[2:03:28] temporary moment. I want to have a
[2:03:30] resurrection.
[2:03:32] [Applause]
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:36] Why Job? Why must it happen? You see,
[2:03:39] Job got to a place to where he didn't
[2:03:41] understand either. He thought, I don't I
[2:03:43] don't know. I don't know what what what
[2:03:46] did I do? You go read Job 18, Job 19.
[2:03:48] Some people don't make it to Job 16.
[2:03:50] They leave the you know, as soon as his
[2:03:52] family listen what you will never find,
[2:03:55] let me give you something else with the
[2:03:56] book of Job. You will never find in your
[2:03:58] Bible that somewhere in Job's life that
[2:04:02] God sat him down and said, "See there
[2:04:04] now. Why I did this, Job, was because of
[2:04:06] this. Why I took your children is
[2:04:08] because of this. Why I took this because
[2:04:10] your boils here was why
[2:04:13] you say, "Brother Matt, no, no, no, no.
[2:04:14] Surely it's there. Go read Job."
[2:04:17] You won't find it.
[2:04:19] You won't find God in this life
[2:04:23] ever giving him the explanation.
[2:04:27] I hope you're hearing me tonight.
[2:04:29] You see this is people die in the why.
[2:04:32] Even Job himself started questioning.
[2:04:35] You go read Job 18. He sounds like an
[2:04:37] atheist. He don't sound like a believer.
[2:04:39] The bitterness started coming into his
[2:04:43] life.
[2:04:44] The bitterness and the bitter thoughts
[2:04:47] of why
[2:04:49] why do you charge me? Says in Job 16,
[2:04:52] why do you charge me like a warrior? You
[2:04:54] take your arch. You're an archer and
[2:04:56] your bow and you draw it at me.
[2:05:00] It have been better for me never to have
[2:05:02] been born. Amen.
[2:05:07] And he starts the bitterness. Listen,
[2:05:09] God intends the brokenness, but God
[2:05:13] never sends the bitterness. Amen.
[2:05:19] And if you let the devil, he'll take
[2:05:21] that question, he'll take that
[2:05:23] circumstance, and you say, "I still love
[2:05:25] God." You might still come to church,
[2:05:27] that don't bother him at all. But if he
[2:05:29] can corrupt your spirit, make you an
[2:05:31] angry person, make you a bitter person,
[2:05:34] make you a complex person, because he
[2:05:36] knows that that bitterness won't just
[2:05:38] affect you. It'll start channeling out
[2:05:40] to your husband, to your wife, to your
[2:05:43] children, to your church, to those
[2:05:45] around you. And thereby many become
[2:05:48] defiled
[2:05:50] and he uses the conduit of your pain.
[2:05:57] You see, you got to watch the devil
[2:05:58] because he can't get to your soul. He
[2:06:01] knows that. He will can never take you
[2:06:03] to hell. He knows that. So he will try
[2:06:05] to get to your human spirit and give you
[2:06:08] complexes and give you fears and give
[2:06:11] you anxieties
[2:06:13] and your life.
[2:06:17] We got a lot of crippled people. Maybe
[2:06:19] not physically naturally, but
[2:06:20] spiritually if God could ever pull back
[2:06:22] the scales, we'd see crutches. We'd see
[2:06:25] wheelchairs.
[2:06:27] We'd see people that are maimed. All all
[2:06:30] of these pains that we go through in
[2:06:32] life. And now the devil has started to
[2:06:35] use those things and those things that
[2:06:38] God sent in your life to bring
[2:06:39] character. Satan says, "I'm going to
[2:06:41] spin it around in their mind and change
[2:06:43] the narrative." And it's never about
[2:06:45] their character. It's cuz they did this
[2:06:47] or they did that and the reason their
[2:06:49] son don't serve God and he's been away
[2:06:51] is because of this mistake and that
[2:06:52] fault and that failure and their husband
[2:06:55] left and and this happened and they lost
[2:06:57] this loved one and God never did. I'm
[2:06:59] going to twist the whole thing around
[2:07:01] and make you bitter. It's what happened
[2:07:03] to Rachel. You go read your Bible of the
[2:07:05] book of of Genesis and Jacob has a, you
[2:07:08] know, Rachel, the story of Rachel, a
[2:07:10] woman who God gave her, you know, takes
[2:07:12] a barren womb and opens her, she she
[2:07:15] opens that womb up. She has a little boy
[2:07:17] named Joseph, a promise of God. But now
[2:07:21] something happens. And here's Jacob and
[2:07:23] and and and Rachel. They're on their way
[2:07:25] to to to to Jerusalem. And they're in
[2:07:28] the city, I think it was called Rama
[2:07:29] there. And and here's Rachel's going to
[2:07:32] have birth. She's going to give birth to
[2:07:34] this next child. It's so powerful
[2:07:38] because something very tragic happens in
[2:07:41] that birth.
[2:07:44] Something very terrible that Jacob never
[2:07:46] planned.
[2:07:47] Rachel never imagined.
[2:07:50] She looked for that looked for that
[2:07:52] child. But here a very sad terrible
[2:07:55] thing takes place in her life. And the
[2:07:58] Bible actually says she dies giving
[2:08:01] birth
[2:08:02] to that child.
[2:08:04] And in her death, as she's breathing, I
[2:08:08] hope you hear me tonight. As she's
[2:08:10] breathing, her last words, you see, your
[2:08:12] words have the ability to imprint
[2:08:15] something. Amen. Your words and what you
[2:08:18] confess have the ability to transfer and
[2:08:20] to go into someone's human spirit and it
[2:08:23] could change the course of their entire
[2:08:26] life. I'm following the Holy Spirit now.
[2:08:29] You watch what you say, mama, to those
[2:08:31] boys. Watch what you say, daddy, to
[2:08:33] those sons. Your words could change the
[2:08:36] course
[2:08:38] of their entire life.
[2:08:41] And you don't know it, but your pain is
[2:08:43] now transferring to them.
[2:08:47] And that mother as she's dying, Rachel.
[2:08:52] Rachel.
[2:08:54] And life didn't go the way she had
[2:08:57] expected.
[2:08:59] She's breathing her last words. And as
[2:09:02] she's going to give birth, she says, "He
[2:09:05] shall be called Bonai,
[2:09:09] the child
[2:09:11] of my sorrow.
[2:09:13] Imagine
[2:09:15] that. She's going to take her sorrow
[2:09:20] and pass it down to her innocent child.
[2:09:25] Oh, but I'm so glad the story doesn't
[2:09:27] stop there. But my Bible says a father
[2:09:30] stepped in the breach. He stepped in the
[2:09:32] gap and said, "He shall not be called
[2:09:34] Bonai, but he shall be called Benjamin,
[2:09:39] son of my right hand." What was it? He
[2:09:41] changed the course of that boy's life.
[2:09:44] And you can change the course of your
[2:09:47] family and your home and your marriage
[2:09:50] and your children.
[2:09:52] Hallelujah.
[2:09:55] Oh, you ought to whip the devil with
[2:09:57] your confession and say, "Satan, I'm not
[2:10:00] going to confess that I'm losing. I'm
[2:10:02] going to say I'm winning. I'm not going
[2:10:04] to confess that I'm defeated. I'm going
[2:10:06] to confess I'm already a victor in
[2:10:09] Christ Jesus.
[2:10:13] I'm going to take what the devil meant
[2:10:16] for my harm and I'm going to use it for
[2:10:20] good.
[2:10:24] He changed his entire life.
[2:10:30] And here's Job.
[2:10:32] I'm five minutes in overtime. Do y'all
[2:10:34] believe in overtime in Tennessee? I
[2:10:36] think you do.
[2:10:42] I'm not a long-winded preacher. Just
[2:10:44] depends on who you compare me to. I'll
[2:10:46] leave it right there.
[2:10:50] You love the Lord.
[2:10:53] Notice Job doesn't know
[2:10:57] I go forward. You're not there. I go
[2:10:59] backwards. What does he mean? He means
[2:11:01] I'm I'm looking in my past.
[2:11:05] I can't find you.
[2:11:08] I'm looking at my future. I don't see
[2:11:10] you there.
[2:11:13] I go left
[2:11:15] means he's trying everything.
[2:11:19] I go right. Behold, you're not there.
[2:11:24] Lord, what you saying? I'm trying to
[2:11:26] find you in any little detail I can. I
[2:11:30] know that if I could just see a trace
[2:11:33] of your hand in this suffering, I'll be
[2:11:36] okay. How many ever felt that way?
[2:11:40] J. Job gets to a place. He says, "Oh,
[2:11:42] that I knew where he lived. That I knew
[2:11:45] his address.
[2:11:48] I'd go to his door. I'd knock on his
[2:11:50] door. Oh, friends, can I just be honest?
[2:11:52] How many's ever felt that way before in
[2:11:54] your life? If I could just have a moment
[2:11:56] with him, if I could just have 10
[2:11:58] seconds just to ask him. I just got one
[2:12:00] question." Lord Job says if if I could
[2:12:03] if I could knock on his door, if I knew
[2:12:05] where he lived and I knocked, I know
[2:12:08] he'd open the door. I know he'd sit me
[2:12:10] down. I know he'd speak kind words to
[2:12:14] me. Hallelujah.
[2:12:18] I know he wouldn't hurt me
[2:12:21] if I could just have a moment.
[2:12:27] But I don't see you. Little did Job know
[2:12:31] in another dimension
[2:12:34] when he couldn't see, when he couldn't
[2:12:36] hear, when he didn't have no
[2:12:38] communication with, his name had came up
[2:12:40] before the throne of God.
[2:12:44] And God was so proud of Job.
[2:12:49] God says, "Have you considered
[2:12:52] my servant Job?" Hallelujah.
[2:12:55] that there's none like him in all the
[2:12:59] earth. He fears God's shoes evil. Oh,
[2:13:02] sure, sure, sure. God, yeah, he loves
[2:13:06] you. Yeah, your children love you cuz
[2:13:08] you put a hedge around them and I can't
[2:13:11] get to him. You know what the dumb devil
[2:13:12] didn't know? That when that was written
[2:13:14] in the Bible, his secret was dis our
[2:13:16] secret was discovered that God puts a
[2:13:18] hedge around his family. And the devil
[2:13:20] can't get beyond the hedge unless your
[2:13:23] father in heaven gives his permission to
[2:13:26] touch you. That means that no weapon
[2:13:28] formed. Doesn't mean the weapon won't be
[2:13:30] formed. It just means that it won't
[2:13:32] prosper in your life. God will bring it.
[2:13:36] God will make good. God will make glory.
[2:13:39] God will bring honor.
[2:13:42] God will bring beauty from ashes.
[2:13:47] Sure.
[2:13:50] It's just because you had him around,
[2:13:51] you won't let me touch them. God says,
[2:13:53] "Go ahead." You know the story. As it
[2:13:55] goes, Job gets to such a place as God
[2:13:58] just continues to move and this
[2:14:00] continues to go further. And Job's life
[2:14:02] begins to unwind and unwind and and
[2:14:05] unwind. He's not understanding. Lord,
[2:14:08] that doesn't make sense. And now that
[2:14:11] brokenness is starting to turn into
[2:14:13] bitter words.
[2:14:15] It finally comes to that crescendo
[2:14:20] and God says, "Who is this that
[2:14:24] darkeneth the counsel of God?" Stand up,
[2:14:27] Job. Amen.
[2:14:30] You know what God knows? What heaven
[2:14:33] knows? That Job's in a mess. Job's in a
[2:14:37] fit, man. He needs something. He's not
[2:14:40] seeing clearly. He's not speaking like a
[2:14:43] like a believer.
[2:14:45] everything that is lost. Even the
[2:14:47] angels, I'm sure, saying, "God, isn't
[2:14:49] this enough? Don't you think it's quite
[2:14:51] enough? Don't Don't you think, God, you
[2:14:53] ought to do something?" Listen, God
[2:14:55] knows how far he can take you. Don't you
[2:14:57] ever worry. God knows he'll never tempt
[2:15:00] you. My Bible says, "Above that which
[2:15:02] you can be tempted, but with that
[2:15:05] temptation, he will make a way of
[2:15:08] escape."
[2:15:10] Don't you think it's enough, God? My
[2:15:13] goodness. I'm looking at Job and I just
[2:15:15] I I don't know. God, you got to do
[2:15:17] something. God says, "Okay, okay.
[2:15:18] Listen. I got this. I got this." And God
[2:15:22] comes to Job
[2:15:24] and I'm going to tell you something in
[2:15:25] your Bible that I bet you most of you
[2:15:28] didn't know was there. I tell you, I'll
[2:15:29] be honest. I had no idea was in my Bible
[2:15:32] until I read it. And now I do. Job
[2:15:36] chapter 40. Turn there with me if you
[2:15:37] could quickly just on the screen. I just
[2:15:39] want to read it. Can we go just a couple
[2:15:40] minutes? I'm done. Amen.
[2:15:43] Notice this in Job chapter 40. I want
[2:15:46] you to notice because Job is in a fit.
[2:15:48] He's not understanding what's taking
[2:15:50] place in his life.
[2:15:52] And and he comes to Job 40 and God the
[2:15:56] angels are saying, "God, you got to do
[2:15:57] something." God says, "I got this. I got
[2:15:59] this." Now, Job, I want you to Now,
[2:16:01] Job's in a mess. He's in a fit. God
[2:16:04] says, "Job, I want you
[2:16:06] to consider
[2:16:08] two animals
[2:16:11] to
[2:16:14] two animals. Yeah. Yeah. Job. Uh angels
[2:16:19] no doubt are saying, "Where in the world
[2:16:21] is he going with this sermon?
[2:16:24] Animals. God, don't you see Job? He's in
[2:16:28] a mess, Lord. Oh, I got this. Don't you
[2:16:30] worry.
[2:16:32] I want you to think of
[2:16:34] the hippopotamus."
[2:16:37] The the the hippopotamus.
[2:16:43] Okay.
[2:16:46] I want you to consider
[2:16:49] the hippo
[2:16:51] and the crocodile.
[2:16:53] Okay. Okay. God. Okay. Job standing
[2:16:56] there wiping his eyes. Okay, Lord. The
[2:16:59] the the the the hippo and and God, don't
[2:17:02] you know what I'm what I'm going
[2:17:03] through? Don't you know, Lord, what I've
[2:17:05] went through? You're talking about
[2:17:06] animals, about a hippopotamus. Just hold
[2:17:09] on, Job.
[2:17:11] I want you to look at verse 15. I want
[2:17:14] you to behold now Bohemoth.
[2:17:18] He's not just a hippo. Actually, if you
[2:17:20] go look historically, and Jewish
[2:17:21] scholars say it was a prehistoric, three
[2:17:23] times the size of a hippopotamus.
[2:17:28] He eateth grass, he said, which I made
[2:17:29] with the eateth grass as an ox.
[2:17:33] And lo, now his strength is in his low
[2:17:34] endings, his forest is in the navl of
[2:17:36] his belly. He moveth his tail like a
[2:17:38] cedar. The senu of his stones are
[2:17:39] wrapped together. His bones are as
[2:17:41] strong pieces of brass. His bones are
[2:17:43] like bars of iron. He's the chief of the
[2:17:46] ways of God. He that made him can make a
[2:17:48] sword to approach unto him. Surely the
[2:17:50] mountains bring him forth food where all
[2:17:51] the beast of the field play. He lith
[2:17:53] under the shady trees. In the covert of
[2:17:56] the reeds and fins, the shady heat trees
[2:17:57] cover him. Verse 23. Behold now he
[2:18:00] drinkketh up a river and hasteth not. He
[2:18:02] trustth that he can draw up Jordan into
[2:18:05] his mouth. Do you know in Africa the
[2:18:08] hippopotamus kills more people, humans,
[2:18:13] than any other animal in all of Africa?
[2:18:16] We think of the lion, but the lion's a
[2:18:18] prey. A lion's an animal that moves at
[2:18:20] night nocturnally. But the hippos
[2:18:23] lay in places you never would expect an
[2:18:26] animal to be.
[2:18:28] And people stumble in thinking that it's
[2:18:30] safe to get in the water. And that hippo
[2:18:33] is known to kill more people per year
[2:18:35] than any other animal.
[2:18:37] And God says, I want you to think about
[2:18:39] him, Job. I want you to consider him.
[2:18:43] Think of how strong he is. His bones are
[2:18:46] like bars of iron.
[2:18:49] His tail is like a cedar. It crusheth.
[2:18:52] Now move on to Job chapter 41, the next
[2:18:55] chapter. Then he goes to Leviathan.
[2:18:58] Leviathan, a prehistoric crocodile.
[2:19:01] He says in Job 41:1, "Can you draw out
[2:19:05] Leviathan with a hook or his tongue with
[2:19:08] the cord which thou let us down? Can you
[2:19:10] put a hook in his nose?" Did you think
[2:19:13] God could be sarcastic? Well, Job 41
[2:19:16] will tell you God can be very sarcastic.
[2:19:22] Can you put a hook at his nose or bore
[2:19:25] his jaw through with an iron with a
[2:19:27] thorn? He says. He says, "Will, I got a
[2:19:30] question, Job. Will he make many
[2:19:32] supplications unto thee? Will he speak
[2:19:36] soft words unto thee? Will you make a
[2:19:40] covenant? Will he make a covenant with
[2:19:41] thee? Will you take him as a servant
[2:19:43] forever? Will you I got more. Will you
[2:19:45] play with him? Play with him as with a
[2:19:48] bird." Come on, Job. You can play with
[2:19:50] that crocodile. Go ahead, brother
[2:19:52] Donnie. They're not crocodiles, by the
[2:19:53] way. They're alligators.
[2:19:56] We live in Egypt according to brother
[2:19:58] Donnie and we got a lot of alligators.
[2:20:00] Yes, we do. But this was much bigger
[2:20:03] than any alligator we got back in South
[2:20:04] Carolina you got in Louisiana.
[2:20:07] And God says, "Will you play with him?"
[2:20:10] Come on. Will you? Will you? He says,
[2:20:11] "Shall the companions make a banquet of
[2:20:13] him? Shall they pardon among the
[2:20:15] merchants? Can you fill his skin with
[2:20:17] barbed irons or his head with fish
[2:20:18] spears? Lay your hand upon him.
[2:20:23] Remember
[2:20:24] the battle, do no more.
[2:20:28] What's he saying? I want you to catch
[2:20:30] this. What's he saying, Job? You've got
[2:20:33] to understand these are monsters
[2:20:37] in your life.
[2:20:40] And there will be monsters that come in
[2:20:43] your life, Job. And there will be
[2:20:46] questions that you wrestle with and you
[2:20:48] wonder about and it doesn't make sense.
[2:20:50] And those monsters, Job, I want to let
[2:20:52] you know, they will swallow you. They
[2:20:55] will chew you up. They will spit you
[2:20:57] out. They'll make you bitter. They'll
[2:20:59] make you backwards. They'll make you
[2:21:01] angry. They'll make you malice with
[2:21:03] jealousy and fearful. They will destroy
[2:21:07] you, Job.
[2:21:10] They will take your life and crush you
[2:21:14] and you will die in the wide. Job, I
[2:21:17] want you to know something, Job. There
[2:21:19] are going to become monsters in your
[2:21:21] life. But I got a revelation for you,
[2:21:23] Job. Here's the message I want to get to
[2:21:25] you, bride. I am the God of your
[2:21:29] monsters.
[2:21:31] I created the alligator. I created the
[2:21:34] hippopotamus.
[2:21:36] I can put a hook in his nose and make it
[2:21:39] obey me. Job, I am the God of your
[2:21:42] problems. Oh, you ought to rejoice,
[2:21:44] church. He's the God of our questions.
[2:21:50] Oh, give him a great big hand clap of
[2:21:52] praise. He's worthy of it.
[2:21:57] Hallelujah.
[2:22:00] I'm the God of your monsters joke. And
[2:22:03] when it doesn't make sense,
[2:22:07] I've got an answer.
[2:22:12] You know what Job says? Job says, "I
[2:22:16] spoke of things
[2:22:19] which I was ignorant of,
[2:22:22] and behold, I have heard of you by the
[2:22:26] hearing of the ears, but now now mine
[2:22:31] eyes have seen thee."
[2:22:37] Job stands up to his feet and he has
[2:22:40] this testimony that we know so well.
[2:22:42] Though the skin worms destroy my body, I
[2:22:46] shall see my redeemer.
[2:22:50] What was it? He couldn't understand it.
[2:22:52] He couldn't make sense of everything.
[2:22:54] But here's what he knows. My God is a
[2:22:56] faithful God. He never makes a mistake.
[2:22:59] He never makes a bad decision.
[2:23:01] Everything I go through is for one
[2:23:04] purpose. That the glory of God might
[2:23:06] come manifest in my life. And I say,
[2:23:09] "God, put me through what you got to put
[2:23:11] me through, but get glory out of my
[2:23:14] life."
[2:23:17] Oh, how many want to say, "Lord, I want
[2:23:19] the brokenness, but I don't want the
[2:23:21] bitterness in my life." Lord,
[2:23:25] you know what's so powerful? Brother
[2:23:27] Brand dramatizing in the message in
[2:23:29] tunement. He says, "Job, there he was
[2:23:31] with all the saints in paradise and he
[2:23:33] says, "Here comes a knock at the door."
[2:23:36] You know, I love it so much, brother
[2:23:37] Donnie. Job never got to knock on God's
[2:23:40] door,
[2:23:41] but God came knocking on Job's door.
[2:23:44] Hallelujah.
[2:23:45] [Applause]
[2:23:48] Brother Brandham says, "There was
[2:23:49] Abraham." He stood up. He says, "Sarah,
[2:23:52] Sarah,
[2:23:54] that Sarah, that's that's him. That's
[2:23:58] the one who spoke to me under the oak
[2:24:01] tree that day." About that time, Ezekiel
[2:24:04] stands up and says, "No, no, brother
[2:24:05] Abraham, that's the will. That's the
[2:24:08] will in the middle of the will. About
[2:24:10] that time Daniel stands up and says,
[2:24:12] "No, guys, you got it all wrong." That's
[2:24:14] that fire. That's that that fire, that
[2:24:16] pillar of fire that came in the lion's
[2:24:18] den when the lions are going to destroy
[2:24:20] me. About that time, Shadrach, Meshach,
[2:24:22] and Abednego stand up and say, "You guys
[2:24:24] got it all wrong." That's the fourth man
[2:24:26] I seen in the middle of my fire.
[2:24:31] About that time, Job stands up and says,
[2:24:37] That's my redeemer.
[2:24:43] What was it, friends? He got the other
[2:24:45] side of the story.
[2:24:49] Oh, and one day we're going to get the
[2:24:51] other side to the story.
[2:24:55] Notice they all seen him differently.
[2:24:57] Abraham seen him one way. Ezekiel seen
[2:24:59] him another way. Job seen him another
[2:25:01] way. Shadrach, Mishach seen him. Listen
[2:25:03] friends, when we get there on that day,
[2:25:05] he might have been someone different to
[2:25:07] you than he was me, but he will still be
[2:25:09] my God. He will still be your Lord. He
[2:25:12] will still be your savior. He will still
[2:25:14] be your friend. Oh, you ought to stand
[2:25:16] to your feet and say, "Oh, God, I'm
[2:25:19] looking for that day when all my
[2:25:21] questions are answered in Jesus." Oh,
[2:25:26] somebody ought to shout here tonight.
[2:25:29] Oh, you ought to give God praise.
[2:25:33] Hallelujah.
[2:25:36] One day,
[2:25:38] one day
[2:25:40] answered all
[2:25:43] his questions. Oh, bow your heads with
[2:25:45] me. Musicians, could you come? One day
[2:25:49] all of his questions. All of his
[2:25:54] wondering, all
[2:25:57] of his tossing,
[2:26:00] all of his turning,
[2:26:03] all of those long nights,
[2:26:07] waking up at 2, three, can't sleep.
[2:26:10] Mind's just racing.
[2:26:16] All those years,
[2:26:18] when they gonna come back,
[2:26:21] God, what's it going to take to get a
[2:26:23] hold of them?
[2:26:26] How many of us have prayed that in our
[2:26:29] prayer closet? God, I don't understand.
[2:26:33] I believe you, Lord. I trust you with
[2:26:36] all of my heart,
[2:26:39] but if I'd be honest right now, it just
[2:26:42] doesn't make sense, Lord.
[2:26:45] Oh God,
[2:26:49] I don't know why,
[2:26:53] but I trust you, Lord.
[2:26:58] You see, friends, your wounds
[2:27:02] have a sermon in them.
[2:27:05] Your story
[2:27:07] has a sermon in it.
[2:27:10] You've got to hear the voice
[2:27:13] of your sermon.
[2:27:15] Not the voice of failure,
[2:27:18] not the voice of defeat,
[2:27:21] not the voice of problems, but you've
[2:27:24] got to be able to hear the sermon, the
[2:27:27] drama, the story that God is trying to
[2:27:30] bring out of your life. If you could
[2:27:32] only look past the now,
[2:27:36] if you could only look past the current
[2:27:38] problem, and it looks impossible, and it
[2:27:40] looks like it'll never get better, looks
[2:27:42] like it'll never get any better.
[2:27:44] Oh, but hold on.
[2:27:48] When I cannot understand my father's
[2:27:50] leading and it seems to be a hard and
[2:27:52] cruel fate, still I hear that gentle
[2:27:56] whisper pleading, "God is working. God
[2:27:59] is faithful.
[2:28:01] Only wait.
[2:28:04] Just wait on the Lord."
[2:28:06] You see, in Job's life, it was all going
[2:28:09] to make sense on that day.
[2:28:11] And friends, can I just say that when we
[2:28:14] get on the other side and we're walking
[2:28:16] streets of gold, oh, and there's a
[2:28:18] there's no problems and there's no
[2:28:20] sickness and there's no cancer, there's
[2:28:22] no TB, there's no depression, there's no
[2:28:24] anxiety. I just want to say it'll all be
[2:28:27] worth it then. It'll be worth every
[2:28:30] meeting. It'll be worth every youth
[2:28:32] camp. It'll be worth every trial. It'll
[2:28:34] be worth every test. It'll be worth
[2:28:36] every prayer, every question, everything
[2:28:39] we've ever went through in our life.
[2:28:40] It'll all be worth it on that day
[2:28:46] when he wipes every tear from our eyes.
[2:28:49] When he gives the answers to all of our
[2:28:51] questions, it'll be worth it on that
[2:28:55] day. Your wounds carry a message. Do you
[2:28:59] realize that Job
[2:29:01] lived
[2:29:03] 140 years after the trial? Do you know
[2:29:08] he had grandchildren?
[2:29:11] Do you know God restored everything back
[2:29:13] in his life? And I could imagine, oh, if
[2:29:15] I could just preach for one more moment
[2:29:17] here, do you realize how many times
[2:29:20] people came to him with lost children
[2:29:22] they had lost and and families that had
[2:29:24] been destroyed? And now Job could take
[2:29:27] what the devil meant to destroy him. And
[2:29:29] he could beat the devil with his own
[2:29:32] testimony and say, "Brother, God brought
[2:29:34] me through it. God will bring you
[2:29:36] through it. God took me through it. God
[2:29:39] will bring you through any situation.
[2:29:42] You got to let God use your bruise.
[2:29:48] You got to let him use your wound. Every
[2:29:51] head bowed, every eye closed. I wonder
[2:29:54] if there'd be someone here tonight who
[2:29:55] could just say with an uplifted hand to
[2:29:58] say, 'Lord,
[2:30:01] I'm just going to raise my hand
[2:30:05] and I'm going to say, "Here's my wound,
[2:30:07] Lord.
[2:30:09] Here it is.
[2:30:12] I be honest. Here's that pain.
[2:30:16] Here's that hurt.
[2:30:20] Here's all my tears of cried. Here's
[2:30:25] all those questions I've asked.
[2:30:29] Here they are, Lord. Here's all my
[2:30:32] tossing, all my turning.
[2:30:36] Here's all my sweat.
[2:30:40] Oh God,
[2:30:43] here's my tears. Here's my worry. Oh, I
[2:30:46] raise it up to you now. Here's my fear.
[2:30:48] Lord, I'm going to give you the chance
[2:30:49] to do it. Here's my depression. Here's
[2:30:52] my anxiety.
[2:30:54] Here's my bruise. Lord,
[2:30:58] would you use it, Lord Jesus?
[2:31:02] Could you ask that with an honest heart?
[2:31:05] Would you use it, Lord, for your glory?
[2:31:10] Would you use it, Lord,
[2:31:13] if it could better somebody else? If
[2:31:15] what I've went through, if what I'm
[2:31:18] going through Oh, listen friends. You
[2:31:20] say, "Well, you don't know what happened
[2:31:22] to me. You don't know I got a right to
[2:31:23] get upset. I got a right to be angry.
[2:31:26] You don't know, preacher, what you're
[2:31:27] talking about. You don't know what they
[2:31:28] did to me." Yeah, but you don't know
[2:31:30] what kind of weapon you could be in the
[2:31:33] hands of God if you will change your
[2:31:35] testimony, change your attitude and say,
[2:31:38] "I might have went through it. I might
[2:31:39] have be going through it, but my God is
[2:31:42] still faithful. He is still worthy of
[2:31:45] all of my praise. I'm not going to stop
[2:31:47] worship. I'm not going to stop praise.
[2:31:49] My God knows what he's doing and I trust
[2:31:53] him with all of my life.
[2:31:56] Lord, we do today. We raise our hands as
[2:31:58] we close now and say, Lord, we trust
[2:32:00] you. We know you know what you're doing,
[2:32:04] Lord. I just want to say that with an
[2:32:06] uplifted hand. Lord, you know what
[2:32:09] you're doing. And if I've allowed my
[2:32:11] brokenness to become bitterness, then
[2:32:13] here tonight, I am letting it go in the
[2:32:16] name of Jesus. I am letting it go. I am
[2:32:19] throwing it down. I am washing it away.
[2:32:22] I'm asking, oh God, come and purge my
[2:32:24] mind. Come and purge my spirit. If I've
[2:32:27] got unforgiveness, how many can say,
[2:32:28] "Lord, come and wash me of it here
[2:32:30] tonight, Lord. If it's in my heart, oh
[2:32:33] God, I want my character to match your
[2:32:35] character. I want my nature to match
[2:32:37] your nature. I want the nature of my
[2:32:39] lamb to come back on my life. If there'd
[2:32:42] be anything in between my soul and my
[2:32:44] savior, I confess it now."
[2:32:48] and ask you to deliver me of it. Jesus,
[2:32:50] I pray, oh God, you've seen the hands
[2:32:53] that are up everywhere.
[2:32:55] I pray you'd greet every I pray you'd
[2:32:57] meet every need, Lord, that's in this
[2:32:59] building here tonight. Come and do it.
[2:33:02] Come and do what only you can do, Lord
[2:33:04] Jesus. Come and bring beauty from ashes,
[2:33:10] restoration
[2:33:13] from ruin.
[2:33:14] Only you can do that. You can sing.
[2:33:22] Yes, Lord.
[2:33:25] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:33:27] Only you have that power, Lord.
[2:33:30] Come and bring beauty from it, Lord
[2:33:32] Jesus.
[2:33:34] Oh, can I do it? Can you do it, friends?
[2:33:36] Come and take it from my hands, Lord. I
[2:33:38] got to I can't do it anymore. I'm going
[2:33:40] to let it go now. I'm going to let it
[2:33:43] go. I'm going to let my bitterness go.
[2:33:46] I'm going to let that grudge go. I'm
[2:33:48] going to let that thing that's been
[2:33:49] hindering and defiling my family. I'm
[2:33:52] going to not let it go any further. I'm
[2:33:55] going to change the narrative and say it
[2:33:57] shall not be called uh uh Boni, the
[2:34:00] child of my sorrow, but I'm going to
[2:34:01] rename it. It shall be the song of
[2:34:04] victory. It shall be the song of
[2:34:06] dancing. It's not going to be mourning
[2:34:08] in the house of God. It's going to be
[2:34:10] shouting and rejoicing in the house of
[2:34:12] God. It's not going to be depression.
[2:34:14] It's going to be victory in Jesus. Yes,
[2:34:18] Lord. Yes, Lord Jesus. I just came into
[2:34:22] a valley. When like I've never been
[2:34:26] before.
[2:34:28] I keep searching for a way out. It seems
[2:34:32] like padlocks are on the door. Oh, there
[2:34:36] must be another sunrise,
[2:34:39] another sunset that I'll see. God will
[2:34:44] make this trial a blessing and the whole
[2:34:49] wide world see.
[2:34:52] God will make this trial a blessing.
[2:34:58] Though it sends me to my knees,
[2:35:02] though my tears flow like a river,
[2:35:06] yet in him there's sweet relief. There's
[2:35:10] no need to get discouraged.
[2:35:14] There's no need to talk defeat. God will
[2:35:18] make this trial a blessing
[2:35:22] and the whole wide world
[2:35:25] see.
[2:35:27] [Music]
[2:35:28] I am not the first one to come into this
[2:35:34] place.
[2:35:36] You see every child of God,
[2:35:40] these tests we must face. It is here
[2:35:45] that God will mold you and make you what
[2:35:49] you ought to be. God will make your
[2:35:53] trial a blessing and the whole wide
[2:35:57] world
[2:35:59] see.
[2:36:00] God will make this trial a blessing.
[2:36:06] Though it sends me to my knees, though
[2:36:10] my tears flow like a river, yet in him
[2:36:15] there's sweet relief. There's no need to
[2:36:19] get discouraged.
[2:36:22] I'm not going to talk defeat. God will
[2:36:26] make this trial a blessing and the whole
[2:36:31] wide world
[2:36:33] see.
[2:36:34] [Music]
[2:36:36] Now I'm standing on the mountain
[2:36:40] looking back. I can't see. When I was in
[2:36:44] my lowest valley, his strong hand was
[2:36:49] leading.
[2:36:50] Oh, it's good to see the sunshine
[2:36:55] and to taste sweet victory.
[2:36:58] God is my tri blessing. Oh, the love he
[2:37:04] has
[2:37:06] for me. God will make this trial a
[2:37:11] blessing.
[2:37:13] Oh, it sends me to my knees. Though the
[2:37:17] tears flow like a river.
[2:37:21] Yeah, he sweet relief. There's no need
[2:37:26] to get discouraged.
[2:37:28] I'm not going to talk defeat. God will
[2:37:33] make this trial a blessing and the whole
[2:37:38] wide world see.
[2:37:41] God will make this strong a blessing.
[2:37:46] Though it sends me to my knees.
[2:37:50] Don't tears flow like a river. Yet it
[2:37:56] sweet relief. There's no need to get
[2:38:00] discouraged.
[2:38:02] There's no need to talk defeat. God will
[2:38:06] make this trial a blessing and the whole
[2:38:11] wide world will see.
[2:38:17] Hallelujah.
[2:38:20] Hallelujah.
[2:38:24] I know
[2:38:28] the hardest
[2:38:30] trial of my life.
[2:38:34] The day that the
[2:38:37] train struck the car,
[2:38:42] two of my family was killed,
[2:38:47] but a little girl was dying.
[2:38:50] And I remember
[2:38:57] in the emergency waiting room,
[2:39:02] Cheryl was crying and she was shaking
[2:39:06] and she said she was going to be sick
[2:39:09] and I got a waste basket for her.
[2:39:17] She said, "I don't understand.
[2:39:21] Why is this happening to us?"
[2:39:26] He said, "You're gone all the time
[2:39:29] preaching?
[2:39:33] Why would the Lord do this to us?"
[2:39:38] And I said, "I don't know.
[2:39:42] I don't know why,
[2:39:45] but sometimes he doesn't ask us to
[2:39:48] understand why.
[2:39:50] He just says, "Can you trust me?"
[2:39:57] And I can say that no matter how dark it
[2:39:59] is,
[2:40:01] there is a man who can turn on the light
[2:40:07] and he can make your bitterest waters
[2:40:11] sweet.
[2:40:13] And maybe that's where you're at this
[2:40:15] weekend. Maybe you have come
[2:40:18] and you're going through such a hard
[2:40:20] trial.
[2:40:22] Maybe you've come
[2:40:24] with a report from a doctor that's not
[2:40:27] good. And maybe you have reached your
[2:40:30] land of morra, the land of bitter water.
[2:40:34] But maybe you're here for your greatest
[2:40:38] miracle.
[2:40:41] That God can just show you just how
[2:40:44] great he is.
[2:40:47] Have you enjoyed the word of God?
[2:40:50] Amen.
[2:40:58] Amen.
[2:41:02] Just before we go, I have a prayer
[2:41:04] request for brother Matt Carter.
[2:41:07] He's in a lot of pain in his back and
[2:41:09] hip and shoulder.
[2:41:11] Let's just pray for our brother. Just
[2:41:14] let's just bow our heads.
[2:41:19] Almighty God,
[2:41:25] creator of heavens and earth,
[2:41:28] the giver of every good gift.
[2:41:33] Lord, we bow in your wonderful presence
[2:41:38] and in our hearts there's thanksgiving
[2:41:40] for the revelation of your word.
[2:41:45] And Lord, you see this need of our
[2:41:47] brother Mac
[2:41:51] who is in a lot of pain.
[2:41:55] But we are so glad that you are our
[2:41:57] healer
[2:41:59] and that you bore our pain at Calvary.
[2:42:05] So Lord, we pray that this anointing we
[2:42:07] have felt among us would go to our
[2:42:10] brother Lord
[2:42:12] and that the pain would leave his body
[2:42:14] that he could come here this service
[2:42:17] tomorrow and testify of your goodness
[2:42:20] and your mercy and your grace
[2:42:24] for Lord what we cannot do we are so
[2:42:27] grateful you can do.
[2:42:29] So Lord, we get him into your hands and
[2:42:32] we ask, oh God, that you just move for
[2:42:35] our brother.
[2:42:37] And Lord, not only for him, but also for
[2:42:39] the hands that were raised here this
[2:42:42] evening.
[2:42:43] May we open up our hearts, Lord, to
[2:42:46] receive of thy word.
[2:42:49] May it bring forth fruit, God, for thy
[2:42:52] glory.
[2:42:54] Bless your people, Lord, we pray. We
[2:42:57] thank you, Lord God.
[2:43:00] that we can call upon you an everpresent
[2:43:03] help in the time of trouble. We commit
[2:43:07] our brother in your hand and these other
[2:43:09] needs into your hands for your glory
[2:43:13] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[2:43:17] saints. And it been good to be in the
[2:43:19] house of God.
[2:43:21] Amen.
[2:43:28] Amen.
[2:43:30] I'm so glad that we serve a God who
[2:43:32] knows all about us. Aren't you?
[2:43:36] Amen.
[2:43:37] Can we just sing one more before we go?
[2:43:39] I think they're maybe getting some
[2:43:41] things ready over there. Can we just
[2:43:42] sing us one more, brother Harry? Just
[2:43:44] Can we worship him just just a little
[2:43:47] bit more? Amen. Oh, I
[2:43:51] will praise
[2:43:53] the Lord.
[2:43:54] [Music]

[2:48:29] Heavenly Father, as we
[2:48:32] come to the close of this service, Lord,
[2:48:37] what a wonderful word of God that we've
[2:48:39] heard, God.
[2:48:42] Lord, to see that
[2:48:44] trials and tests and situations in our
[2:48:48] lives are not
[2:48:50] always because that we displease you,
[2:48:52] but it's because
[2:48:54] you have confidence, Lord,
[2:48:58] that these things will make us better
[2:49:00] Christians, characters, Lord, that's
[2:49:02] developed to serve you better.
[2:49:06] And Lord, we're just grateful for those
[2:49:07] things that we've heard.
[2:49:10] Help us, dear God, to take these things
[2:49:12] into our hearts, Lord.
[2:49:14] And when the trials come, and maybe not
[2:49:16] tomorrow, it might be next week or next
[2:49:18] month, but when it comes, may we
[2:49:20] remember these things that we have
[2:49:21] heard, dear God. Lord, and Lord, may we
[2:49:24] use them against our enemy.
[2:49:28] For Lord, truly, truly, we're more than
[2:49:32] conquerors through Christ Jesus.
[2:49:34] Father, we ask that you restore the
[2:49:36] strength of our brethren. Bless this
[2:49:37] family, Lord, that made the effort to
[2:49:38] come. We pray each one that's come out
[2:49:41] tonight, Lord. Give them traveling grace
[2:49:42] on the way home, Lord. And those that
[2:49:44] are streaming, Lord, and at home, we
[2:49:46] pray, dear God, that your anointing
[2:49:48] would move upon them and bless them with
[2:49:50] the words also, Lord, be with those who
[2:49:53] prepared the food, Lord. And may it be
[2:49:55] used for the nourishment of our bodies.
[2:49:57] We pray that we could serve you better.
[2:49:59] And Lord, as we dismiss from this
[2:50:01] congregation, may we never dismiss from
[2:50:03] your presence, Lord. May we come to love
[2:50:06] you and know you more. We pray, Father,
[2:50:09] we ask that you'd just bless the
[2:50:10] remainder of these services this
[2:50:11] weekend, Lord. That when everything's
[2:50:13] said and done, we can testify, Lord,
[2:50:17] that you're the God who cannot fail.
[2:50:21] Lord, we commit these things into your
[2:50:22] hands for your glory. We thank you for
[2:50:24] the opportunity to serve you, Lord.
[2:50:27] Thank you for this great message. Thank
[2:50:29] you for sending us a prophet. Thank you,
[2:50:32] oh God, for the word that we're hearing
[2:50:35] will change our bodies, Lord. We're so
[2:50:38] grateful for that. Now, go with your
[2:50:40] people, we pray, in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:50:44] God bless you, saints. Do you love him
[2:50:45] tonight? Has it not been good to be in
[2:50:48] the house of God?
[2:50:50] Amen. As we dismiss, sing us something,
[2:50:52] brother Harry. Water you turned into
