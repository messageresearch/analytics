[26:47] special way and then I'm so glad the

[26:51] sometimes we really need the Lord to
[26:53] move and I'm so glad he always does when
[26:56] we need him most
[26:57] amen I told the brothers in the back
[26:59] I've traveled 4,000 miles by playing six

[27:06] in the last 10 days and I'm tired can I
[27:11] be honest with you today
[27:13] Amen bodies a little bit physically worn
[27:15] out I thought he might old brother Terry
[27:17] said I think that was the hardest
[27:19] physically that I've ever had to preach
[27:21] this was a struggle physically and he
[27:24] said well I don't think anybody noticed
[27:25] it brother I said well good amen that's
[27:28] what happens when the Spirit of the Lord
[27:30] takes over Amen that's what we always
[27:32] want
[27:33] Amen we always find that when we come to
[27:35] the end of our own strength that's when
[27:37] his strength takes over
[27:39] so we're so glad to be here as we said
[27:43] last night the Lord really just did
[27:46] something really special there I see one
[27:47] of the brothers Amen that was here at
[27:49] the camp so good to see you again
[27:51] brother and we had such a wonderful time
[27:53] amen it was something so special the
[27:55] Lord did just there at those meetings I
[27:58] told her and brother I said it was
[28:00] amazing it's like I've never had
[28:02] anything happened like that in all my
[28:04] years of ministering I walked on to the
[28:07] camp from the very first day we
[28:09] registered and that they showed me gave
[28:11] me the key to my room and I walked in my
[28:13] room and and I can't even hardly know
[28:17] how to explain it but from the moment I
[28:19] walked in there
[28:20] or I could even hardly get my luggage
[28:21] put on the floor the Holy Spirit of the
[28:24] anointing came in that room and I
[28:26] dropped my luggage and fell to my knees
[28:28] before I could do anything and the Lord
[28:31] just begin to move and God met me in
[28:33] that room three days in a row just like
[28:34] that and I said it was so hard to
[28:38] explain that knowing that I felt felt
[28:40] the same as if I had just finished
[28:42] preaching an anointed service and was
[28:45] about to pray for people
[28:46] yet I hadn't preached anything yet but
[28:49] God was so dealing with my heart I think
[28:51] anybody could have preached and the Lord
[28:54] would have done something God really
[28:55] really just moved in such a special
[28:58] special way I tell you what Lord's doing
[29:00] something right now amen 66 people I
[29:04] know the number was 68 at first but that
[29:06] was asked brother Ron how many was it I
[29:08] know it was a lot and and it was amazing
[29:10] even at the baptismal as the the people
[29:12] that came to be baptized in him one disc
[29:14] came and another came and another came
[29:16] and there were ministers coming and
[29:18] counselors adults not just God moving on
[29:20] the young people but God moving on the
[29:22] hearts of his family the Spirit of God
[29:25] is moving it's moving in all the earth
[29:28] Lord moving me how many want to pray
[29:32] that today the Spirit of the Lord is
[29:33] moving move Olga didn't me and that
[29:36] don't pass me by and then praise the
[29:39] Lord well it's so good to be here again
[29:40] as we said we always enjoy coming amen
[29:43] and just enjoy the presence of the Lord
[29:45] if you have your Bible return to the

[30:02] like to go just a little bit different
[30:03] direction today and I've only ministered
[30:07] this ever just one time and the Lord
[30:10] just began to deal with my heart and and
[30:12] recently and just started stirring this
[30:15] up in me again and I just knew the Lord
[30:18] was dealing with me and just over the
[30:19] past few days even here just in my
[30:22] prayer closet the Lord just bringing
[30:24] this up again in my life and I'd like to
[30:26] speak to you this morning on called out
[30:30] of judges and in
[30:31] Ruth called out of judges and into Ruth
[30:36] a man let's read it verse one of judges
[30:39] chapter 1 it says now after the death of
[30:43] Joshua came to pass that the children of
[30:45] Israel asked the Lord saying who shall
[30:47] go up for us against the Canaanites
[30:50] first to fight against them and the Lord
[30:53] said Judah shall go up behold I have
[30:55] delivered the land in his hand
[30:59] Judah Cain said unto Semmy and his
[31:01] brother come up with me into my lot we
[31:04] may fight against the Canaanites and I
[31:06] likewise will go with thee into thy lot
[31:09] so Simeon went with him let's turn to
[31:12] chapter 2 and the Bible says here I'm
[31:16] sorry stay in chapter 1 let's go to
[31:18] verse 21 first the children of Benjamin
[31:22] did not drive out the Jebusites that
[31:24] inhabited Jerusalem but the Jebusites
[31:27] dwell with the children of Benjamin in
[31:29] Jerusalem unto this day the house of
[31:31] Joseph they also went up against Bethel
[31:34] and the Lord was with them verse 27
[31:36] neither did Manasseh drive out the
[31:38] inhabitants of Beth she Ann and her
[31:40] towns nor Tanic and her towns nor the
[31:43] inhabitants of door in her towns nor the
[31:46] inhabitants of Eve liam and her towns
[31:48] nor the inhabitants of Magda go and her
[31:51] towns but the Canaanites would dwell in
[31:53] that land verse 29 neither did ephraim
[31:57] drive out the Canaanites that dwell on
[31:59] gazer but the Canaanites dwell in gazer
[32:01] among them neither did Zebulon drive out
[32:04] the inhabitants of katrana or the
[32:06] inhabitants of may hell all but the
[32:08] Canaanites dwell among them verse 31
[32:11] needed it Asher drive out the
[32:13] inhabitants of aiko nor the inhabitants
[32:15] of Zion nor the nor of a Balaam nor of
[32:19] Aksum no you say brother Matt why are
[32:21] all these towns so important we get the
[32:24] point they didn't have victory but you
[32:27] see judges was going to record these
[32:30] were individual people an individual
[32:33] potential for victory or defeat and God
[32:37] was going to record the areas in their
[32:40] life that they could never get victory
[32:45] and he says this brother had victory
[32:47] here but he could never get victory here
[32:49] he had victory I wonder if my life could
[32:51] be read that way had victory here but
[32:54] never over a temper never over this in
[32:56] his life he had victory here but God
[32:58] gave him a great victory here but then
[32:59] there was a great defeat here oh boy how
[33:03] closely related are we to these
[33:05] scriptures that's why I love this Bible
[33:06] and it says here in verse let's look
[33:09] here in verse 33 neither to Neptune I
[33:12] drive out the inhabitants of
[33:13] beth-shemesh nor the inhabitants of
[33:15] Bethan F verse 30 verse 1 of chapter 2
[33:19] and an angel of the Lord came up from
[33:22] Gilgal to Bochum and said I made you to
[33:24] go up out of Egypt and have brought you
[33:26] into the land which I swore in to your
[33:28] fathers and I said I will never break my
[33:30] covenant with you and you shall make no
[33:32] league with the inhabitants of this land
[33:34] you shall throw it on their altars but
[33:36] you have not obeyed my voice why have
[33:41] you done this let's just bow our heads
[33:43] here just for a moment
[33:45] Lord Jesus father we so trust in you
[33:48] this morning Lord we're looking to your
[33:50] hand father to your voice Lord I pray
[33:54] that we would hear that voice today
[33:56] father may it just be that still small
[33:58] voice that really changes us father into
[34:02] that realm past our emotions Lord past
[34:05] what we feel past what we see or what we
[34:07] hear Lord we're looking to that unseen
[34:10] to move into that soul realm today Lord
[34:13] we pray father that you would just move
[34:16] amongst us again as we seen you moved
[34:18] last night
[34:18] Lord I pray that you would to speak to
[34:21] your children we ask in Jesus Christ's
[34:23] name amen you can be seated
[34:31] I want you to pause your spot there in
[34:33] judges chapter two and I'm just going to
[34:36] I'm gonna go very slow and teach Amen
[34:39] this morning I'm actually a lot of
[34:40] people don't know that but back at home
[34:41] I teach an adult Sunday School I've done
[34:44] that for many years with just the adults
[34:46] there at our church and this is this the
[34:48] the channel that the Lord has brought me
[34:50] in this morning and I just want to go
[34:53] slow through this I want you to turn to
[34:54] Judges chapter 17 and I want you to read
[34:58] this one verse in judges 17 verse 6 this
[35:01] is gonna be the refrain that you hear
[35:04] throughout this entire book of Judges
[35:07] and there's a constant message in this
[35:09] book and it says here in judges chapter
[35:11] 6 17 and verse 6 it says in those days
[35:16] there was no king in Israel every man
[35:20] did that which was right in his own eyes
[35:24] this is the key to the entire book that
[35:27] you read here in judges and it has this
[35:30] constant message all the way from
[35:32] beginning to end as you study this book
[35:35] and I'm sure that many of you have
[35:37] studied this book and studied certain
[35:39] highlights of judges you know the story
[35:42] if you went to Sunday school as a child
[35:45] I'm sure you've heard the story of
[35:46] Samson and Delilah and we hear the story
[35:50] of Gideon you may know that story today
[35:53] the story of Gideon and how the Lord
[35:55] Shrunk his army and God did a great
[35:58] thing in Gideon's life and he had mighty
[36:00] victory over the Midianites you may have
[36:02] heard the story of of Deborah or a
[36:04] barrack or some of these highlights but
[36:08] I want today just to open the entire
[36:10] book and what the significance of this
[36:14] book was and what you'll find throughout
[36:17] the entire book of Judges is that
[36:20] there's this constant message that you
[36:22] hear throughout this entire stall of the
[36:25] stories that you read you'll hear this
[36:28] message there was no king there was no
[36:31] king and the people did write did that
[36:34] which was right not in God's eyes but in
[36:37] his own eyes I believe this is a very
[36:40] fulfillment of the day and age that you
[36:42] and I live in to where
[36:43] people have no king they have no
[36:45] absolute they have no authority and they
[36:48] became their own moral authority of
[36:51] their own moral interpreter to life and
[36:55] we see the mess that the world is in
[36:58] today from people who has literally
[37:00] exalted the thought of man to a place to
[37:03] where man is God and man chooses what's
[37:06] right and wrong judges was very similar
[37:09] to the age that you and I live in that
[37:12] they had rejected this this time period
[37:14] in this in this in this and this age
[37:17] here that they were in they had rejected
[37:20] the Lord and you'll see this constant
[37:23] cycle that that there was no king and
[37:26] and everyone did that which was right in
[37:29] his own eyes it's amazing because when
[37:32] you read the entire chapter the entire
[37:35] book of Judges you'll find that Israel
[37:37] the Bible says was in Egypt for many
[37:41] years the Bible says they were slaves in
[37:43] Egypt until the iniquity of the amorite
[37:47] was full and when the the cup of the
[37:51] amorite was full and overflowing God
[37:54] waits for that time period you see God
[37:56] has a season for everything he's not
[37:59] aimlessly just picking timeline and
[38:01] picking when this will happen and you
[38:03] know wins that wins the body change
[38:04] gonna happen when's the rapture of the
[38:06] church gonna happen when am I gonna send
[38:08] the seventh angel messenger know all of
[38:10] these things were ordered very ordered
[38:13] from the Lord and they all had a perfect
[38:15] time in a perfect place and at the right
[38:17] moment God sent a message and at the
[38:20] right moment and the right condition God
[38:22] sent a messenger and we find even here
[38:25] in judges the Bible says when the
[38:27] iniquity of the amorite s' was full this
[38:31] in other words God was saying that this
[38:32] land of Canaan was such a corrupt land
[38:35] it was such a corrupt people it was it
[38:39] was such a corrupt filthy society that
[38:43] God waited for that iniquity to get to
[38:46] such a place and when it reached the
[38:48] brink or the height of its corruption
[38:51] God sends a deliverer and delivers God's
[38:54] people out of Egypt
[38:55] and Israel was chosen to be God's
[38:59] punishment for sin the Bible says that
[39:04] Israel was going to begin to afflict
[39:07] the Philistines and afflict the amorite
[39:09] and afflict the Canaanites so the very
[39:12] purpose of why God delivered them out of
[39:15] Egypt was to dispossessed the Canaanites
[39:18] from the land of Canaan and to take the
[39:21] land back now very sadly as we know the
[39:25] story as they come out from Egypt as we
[39:28] spoke on last night they come out of
[39:30] Egypt and God delivers them with a
[39:32] mighty hand and they go through the Red
[39:34] Sea and we know all of the journey that
[39:37] they that they went through when you
[39:38] read the scripture and you follow that
[39:41] story all the way through the wilderness
[39:43] and yeah you have many events that
[39:45] happen in that place but now they come
[39:48] to the very purpose of why God had led
[39:51] them out they come to the very
[39:53] fulfillment or the very reason that
[39:55] you're going to deliver the land from
[39:58] its oppressors you're going to take
[40:00] possession back what God had promised
[40:03] your father's you're gonna you're gonna
[40:05] have full complete victory you're gonna
[40:08] dis possess the inhabitants of the land
[40:10] I want you to look here in numbers
[40:12] chapter 33 very familiar Scripture but I
[40:15] want you to turn there in your Bible if
[40:17] you have it Numbers chapter 33 and we'll
[40:19] just pause there and judges just here
[40:21] for just a moment God brings them all
[40:24] the way through Egypt and all the way
[40:26] out of Egypt and through the wilderness
[40:28] and now God is going to give them
[40:30] instructions through a prophet and the
[40:32] Bible says here in numbers 33 that the
[40:36] author is gonna start to list in
[40:38] chronological order all of the places
[40:41] where they camped and they come all the
[40:44] way down if you read every single verse
[40:46] you come all the way down to the very
[40:48] last encampment and it says in verse 49
[40:51] they pitched by Jordan from Beth Jesu
[40:55] moth even unto Abel shittim and the
[40:57] plains of Moab the Lord spake unto Moses
[41:00] and the plains of Moab by Jordan near
[41:02] Jericho now notice the Lord is going to
[41:04] change something there's gonna be a
[41:06] dispensational change there's going to
[41:08] be something
[41:09] about to instruct them and he's gonna
[41:12] say up until this point I've been
[41:14] leading you up until this point I fought
[41:17] your battles up until this point I
[41:19] delivered you from your oppressors I've
[41:21] sent a Holy Spirit I've sent an
[41:23] anointing a pillar of cloud a fire by
[41:26] night and a cloud by day enough I've led
[41:29] you all the way to this point I've
[41:31] opened the Red Sea I've rained manna and
[41:35] quail for your food and for your bread
[41:37] and I've brought you all the way out of
[41:40] the world
[41:40] I've sanctified you I filled you with my
[41:43] spirit I've gave in you my very own life
[41:46] I gave you not just the gift of the Holy
[41:48] Ghost but I gave you the Holy Ghost
[41:50] himself as what God is saying to us
[41:52] today but now it's gonna come to a place
[41:56] in your life where you're gonna have to
[41:58] put action to your faith the Bible says
[42:02] here and notice what he says to Moses in
[42:05] verse 51 speaking to the children of
[42:08] Israel and say unto them when you are
[42:10] passed over Jordan into the land of
[42:13] Canaan then you shall drive out some of
[42:17] the inhabitants of the land so we try
[42:23] that again
[42:24] then you shall drive out all the
[42:26] inhabitants that you don't really care
[42:28] for particularly like then you shall
[42:32] drive out just you know the ones that
[42:33] really don't bother you you know and the
[42:36] ones that really don't mean anything to
[42:37] you no the scripture says this is how
[42:40] you're gonna have victory in Canaan
[42:42] you're to drive out all a ll all of the
[42:48] inhabitants of the land from before you
[42:51] and destroy all their pictures and
[42:54] destroy all their molten images and
[42:56] quite plucked down all their high places
[42:59] what was God commissioning these
[43:02] Israelites to he was saying I want you
[43:05] to go in and I want you to completely
[43:08] annihilate completely annihilate this
[43:14] race of people and I want you to go
[43:17] further than just destroying them I want
[43:20] you to destroy all their images
[43:23] I want you to destroy all their pictures
[43:25] I don't want your children to ever know
[43:28] that there was a people who existed in
[43:31] this land before you did and God was
[43:36] saying I don't want there to be a trace
[43:38] I don't want there to be a hint I don't
[43:40] want there to be a smell because I want
[43:43] you to have such victory because this is
[43:46] your land and the devil doesn't belong
[43:48] in your land the devil doesn't have any
[43:51] place in your mind he doesn't have any
[43:53] place in your spirit he doesn't have any
[43:56] place in your mouth he doesn't have any
[43:58] place in your ears he doesn't have any
[44:00] place so that's why the Bible says give
[44:02] no place to the devil resist the devil
[44:05] and he shall flee from you you say how
[44:07] much of God how much of the of God is
[44:10] supposed to possess me 100 percent of
[44:13] your body your mind and your spirit is
[44:16] to be possessed by the Holy Ghost
[44:18] I notice what God says here he says I
[44:23] want you to destroy all of them and he
[44:26] says and you shall dispossessed the
[44:28] inhabitants of the land and dwell there
[44:30] in for I now here's the promise for I
[44:34] have given you the land to possess it
[44:38] here's a promise I have given you the
[44:41] land to possess it then that's all I
[44:44] need God is a promise that's not all you
[44:46] need you got to put action to that
[44:48] promise because that promise is going to
[44:52] be very conditional in their life notice
[44:55] what God says you shall dispossessed the
[44:59] inhabitants of the land and dwell
[45:01] therein for I have given you the land to
[45:05] possess it so let's close our Bible
[45:08] let's in the service right there that's
[45:10] all we need just to promise amen praise
[45:13] God God says that ain't all verse 55 but
[45:19] boy that's a big word what do you mean
[45:24] but not hold on a minute I thought you
[45:26] just promised it to me but here's the
[45:28] condition if you will not drive out the
[45:32] inhabitants of the land from before you
[45:34] then it shall come to pass
[45:36] that those which you let remain of them
[45:39] shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns
[45:42] in your sides and shall vex you in the
[45:45] land wherein you dwell God was promising
[45:52] this and you'll find this promise played
[45:54] out so true in the book of Judges he was
[45:58] promising them I'm gonna give you
[46:00] victory you're gonna fight for every
[46:02] inch of ground that I'm gonna give you
[46:04] you're gonna have to fight for it not
[46:06] only are you gonna have to fight for
[46:08] every inch of ground you're gonna have
[46:10] to fight just to maintain the ground I'm
[46:13] gonna give you you know sometimes real
[46:15] victory is not gaining new ground it's
[46:18] holding the ground that God's already
[46:19] given you and not backing up from the
[46:22] faith God put inside your heart and God
[46:24] says you're gonna fight for every inch
[46:26] of it you're gonna hold your ground and
[46:28] you're gonna have complete conquest of
[46:30] this land but if you decide not to obey
[46:35] the voice of the Lord then I want you to
[46:39] notice what happens in this book of
[46:41] Judges he says here it shall come to
[46:44] pass they'll be thorns and they'll be
[46:46] pricks in your eyes
[46:48] and so God commands all of these words
[46:51] he commands them to these Jews and says
[46:53] go in and have victory what potential or
[46:56] what a wave of revival that Israel was
[46:59] riding on just coming through the land
[47:02] and now they're at the climax now
[47:03] they're at the point of possession now
[47:05] their God is with filmin and God's
[47:08] already given a promise and he's given
[47:10] I'm a prophet and he's giving them the
[47:11] word but as we just read in judges it
[47:14] happened so differently than what you
[47:16] might would have expected the Bible
[47:20] comes to Judges chapter 2 after all of
[47:22] this in complete victory and I want you
[47:24] to notice what happens here the Bible
[47:27] says as we ended reading on verse 2 why
[47:30] have you done this judges chapter 2
[47:32] verse 3 says wherefore I also said I
[47:35] will not drive them out from before you
[47:37] but they shall be as thorns in your
[47:39] sides and there God shall be a snare
[47:41] unto you and it came to pass when the
[47:44] angel of the Lord spoke these words unto
[47:46] all the children of Israel that the
[47:48] people lifted up their voice in
[47:50] wept they called the name of that place
[47:51] Volcom and they sacrificed there unto
[47:54] the Lord and notice what it says here in
[47:57] verse 7 and the people served the Lord
[48:00] all the days of Joshua and all the days
[48:03] of the elders that outlived Joshua who
[48:06] had seen all the great works of the Lord
[48:08] that he did for Israel the first
[48:12] generation never has a problem they
[48:14] always can live to the victory or the
[48:17] level of the previous generation they
[48:21] have no trouble living that far but but
[48:24] now watch what happens when Joshua dies
[48:26] and not only Joshua even after Joshua
[48:30] dies the Bible says that they even after
[48:32] Joshua goes off the scene the elders are
[48:35] there and they live a good lives they
[48:37] live righteous lives under the elders of
[48:40] the message but now when that generation
[48:42] starts to die off notice what happens
[48:46] here in this pattern of judges the Bible
[48:49] says they bury him verse 10 and also all
[48:52] that generation were gathered unto their
[48:54] fathers and there arose another
[48:56] generation after them which knew not the
[49:00] Lord what a sad verse nor yet the works
[49:04] which he had done for Israel and the
[49:06] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[49:08] of the Lord and served Balaam they
[49:11] forsook the Lord God of their fathers
[49:12] which brought them out of the land of
[49:15] Egypt and followed other gods lowercase
[49:19] God's not God but gods
[49:27] you say brother Matt what happens when a
[49:29] person leaves the truth they don't
[49:31] always get sinful they sometimes get
[49:34] more spiritual or let me rephrase that
[49:38] they get more religious but they're not
[49:43] serving capital g.od they're serving
[49:45] lowercase G OD they're serving the gods
[49:50] of the people idolatry they're serving
[49:53] the gods of the people that were
[49:55] supposed to be driven out but now God
[50:00] says because you didn't drive them out
[50:02] now they're gonna be there for your
[50:04] children to see and for your children to
[50:07] worship and the Bible says that exactly
[50:10] what God says they become thorns in
[50:12] their eyes and pricks and their sides
[50:15] because why because they had to watch as
[50:18] the children who they raised in the
[50:20] message and told them the ways in the
[50:22] words of the Prophet the people who sat
[50:24] in church and went to church their
[50:26] entire life they watched an entire
[50:28] generation of message young people
[50:31] completely leave the Lord and it was a
[50:35] prick in their eye I can imagine it
[50:37] would be and the Bible says that they
[50:40] that noticed this they forsook verse 12
[50:42] the Lord God of their fathers which
[50:44] brought them out of the land of Egypt
[50:45] and followed other gods of the gods of
[50:47] the people that were round about them
[50:49] and bowed themselves unto them and
[50:51] provoked the Lord to anger and they
[50:54] forsook the Lord and served bail and
[50:57] Ashtaroth and the anger of the Lord was
[51:00] hot against Israel and he delivered them
[51:02] into the hands of their spoils that
[51:03] spoiled them he sold them into the hands
[51:05] of their enemies roundabout so that they
[51:07] could no longer stand before their
[51:09] enemies wheresoever whithersoever they
[51:11] went out the hand of the Lord was
[51:12] against them for evil as the Lord had
[51:15] said and as the Lord had sworn unto them
[51:18] and they were greatly distressed
[51:20] nevertheless notice this nevertheless
[51:23] the Lord raised up judges which
[51:27] delivered them out of the hands of those
[51:30] that spoiled them yet they would not
[51:32] hearken unto their judges but they went
[51:35] a whoring after other gods and bow
[51:37] themselves unto them they turned quickly
[51:40] out of the way which their fathers
[51:42] walked in obeying the commandments of
[51:44] the Lord but they did not so and when
[51:47] the Lord raised them up judges then the
[51:49] Lord was with the judge and delivered
[51:52] them out of the hand of their enemies
[51:53] all the days of the judge for it
[51:57] repented the Lord because of their
[51:59] groanings by reason of them that
[52:01] oppressed them and vex them and it came
[52:03] to pass when the judge was dead that
[52:07] they returned and corrupted themselves
[52:09] more than their fathers in following
[52:13] other gods to serve them and to bow down
[52:15] unto them they ceased not from their own
[52:17] doings nor from their stubborn way now
[52:21] what you'll notice is there's a pattern
[52:23] as we said it we don't have time to
[52:26] cover this entire book of Judges nor the
[52:28] Book of Ruth but we want just to bring
[52:31] out something to you today and you'll
[52:33] notice that there's this pattern all the
[52:36] way through this book of Judges there's
[52:38] this cycle and God has a message through
[52:41] this book of Judges and through this
[52:42] book of Ruth I want to read you what the
[52:44] prophet of God says in the kinsman
[52:46] redeemer he says now many people look at
[52:49] this book of Ruth as they say it's a
[52:52] love story of the Bible the Bible is a
[52:55] love story the whole Bible the whole
[53:02] Bible is a love story not only is it a
[53:06] love story it's a prophet not only is
[53:09] the Bible a prophet you say the Bible a
[53:12] prophet it's a prophet it prophesies and
[53:15] he says it's not just a love story
[53:18] it's a prophet it's not only a prophet
[53:21] it's also a history not only is it a
[53:24] love story a history and a prophet it's
[53:27] God Himself because in the beginning was
[53:31] the word and the Word was with God and
[53:33] the Word was God
[53:34] so the word is God own print that oughta
[53:40] settle it brother God own print Jehovah
[53:44] printed on a book hallelujah oh this
[53:48] quote will get me excited he says it's
[53:50] God Jehovah printed on a book and
[53:53] none of it just comes some kind of a
[53:55] fiction tale don't ever don't let
[53:57] anybody ever tell you this is fables and
[53:59] stories and tales this is Jehovah
[54:02] printed on a book let me tell you what
[54:06] this is this is the voice of God to you
[54:10] my brother and my sister it's the Word
[54:12] of God brother Branham says there's none
[54:15] of it just a fiction or a tale it's
[54:17] absolutely the truth every single phase
[54:21] of it
[54:21] hang your soul it's there it's the truth
[54:29] and God will back up his own word this
[54:35] story speaking of that story of Ruth was
[54:37] written and all the old manuscripts when
[54:40] they were segregating the Bible the holy
[54:41] men when they were trying to put it
[54:43] together the Old Testament this book of
[54:45] Ruth was one of the most outstanding he
[54:48] said it was one of the outstanding books
[54:49] that they accepted why if it's just a
[54:53] love story why would the writers ancient
[54:56] sages accept this Book of Ruth is what
[54:58] he's speaking of as inspired because
[55:01] there's a hidden revelation in it and in
[55:07] this revelation you catch the real
[55:10] meaning it'll bring you real close to
[55:13] God he says in this Book of Ruth there's
[55:19] a real hidden revelation and it's more
[55:22] than just a love story it's a prophet
[55:24] it's more than just a prophet this book
[55:26] is more than just a prophet it's a
[55:28] history book oh that's what I love so
[55:32] much about when you study the Word of
[55:34] God this Bible is more than just
[55:36] prophecies and more than just divine
[55:39] sayings but it's actually unique in that
[55:42] it's mostly history and profit at future
[55:46] you ever study the Quran or you study
[55:48] any of the other books or look at some
[55:50] of their sayings the Quran is just
[55:52] filled with spiritual sayings and
[55:55] spiritual things it doesn't tell much
[55:57] history because it doesn't have a place
[56:00] in history it doesn't have a place in
[56:02] the mind of God but the Bible doesn't
[56:05] just
[56:06] prophecy but it also records history but
[56:13] it records a very special type of
[56:15] history it records history when there
[56:19] was no historian to write it down on a
[56:22] piece of paper do you realize the Bible
[56:24] tells us the history of the beginning of
[56:27] the earth and how the earth was formed
[56:29] yet there was no writer or historian to
[56:32] take a pen and write it down yet the
[56:35] Bible gives us the history of the
[56:37] beginning of the earth you go read the
[56:40] book of Revelation it'll give you the
[56:41] history of the end of the earth yet
[56:45] there's no historian to tell you how to
[56:47] ride it or to watch it all happen
[56:49] why is it because it's a book of
[56:51] prophecy it's a love story and there's a
[56:55] revelation inside of it and I say God
[56:57] give me that revelation that'll bring me
[56:59] real close to God give me that
[57:01] revelation Lord more than just the
[57:03] letter give me the word today brother
[57:07] madam says it's more than just a history
[57:10] it's more than just a love story hang
[57:12] your soul and I'm going to say today
[57:14] Lord I'm hanging my soul on this book
[57:19] and I want you to notice what this
[57:22] history of judges records the history of
[57:26] judges records this cycle of judges
[57:29] notice what we just read here in judges
[57:31] chapter 2 it says nevertheless the Lord
[57:34] raised up judges this is what happens as
[57:38] you see this constant refrain all the
[57:41] way through this book of judges you're
[57:43] gonna hear this message
[57:44] there's no king and you're gonna notice
[57:47] that there's this pattern through the
[57:48] entire book of judges you're gonna
[57:51] notice that there's this cycle this
[57:53] roundabout in the book of Judges and it
[57:56] just keeps repeating itself
[57:59] you have oppressor and then you have
[58:01] deliverer then you have oppressor then
[58:04] you have deliverer
[58:05] I want you to notice brothers if you can
[58:07] pull that PowerPoint up on the screen I
[58:09] need you to this to be quick today but I
[58:12] even titled this part of this section of
[58:16] judges and Ruth the circle
[58:19] and the line the circle and the line I
[58:22] want you to notice this circle of this
[58:25] pattern that we see here you notice this
[58:28] list of oppressors I go to the next
[58:30] slide brother you would have the king of
[58:32] Jericho that would raise up and would
[58:35] oppress the Israelites and so God raises
[58:38] up Oh Theo this straight judge and we
[58:40] don't have time to get into their life
[58:42] today but we just want to highlight just
[58:44] some of a few of them here today as you
[58:46] study this book of Judges he would raise
[58:48] up a king of Jericho and there would be
[58:50] a judge named öthey el and then he would
[58:53] raise up the king of Moab and then God
[58:55] would raise up even another judge and
[58:58] these judges would begin to deliver
[59:00] Israel from the oppressor then the
[59:04] ammonites would come in and they would
[59:06] oppress Israel so God would raise up a
[59:08] Shamgar and we know the story of Shamgar
[59:11] a man who was sick and tired of being
[59:13] ran over his entire life so he picked up
[59:16] a little off school just a little bit of
[59:18] faith and said I'm sick and tired of
[59:20] being sick and tired I'm so disgusted of
[59:24] my my own condition in my own life I'm
[59:26] gonna choose to do something about it
[59:29] and I'm gonna put faith in God and the
[59:31] Bible says that Shamgar had a great
[59:33] victory in his own life and for his own
[59:36] family but what were these men they were
[59:38] judges the Amalekites would come in and
[59:41] then God would raise up Deborah and then
[59:44] he would raise up through Deborah
[59:45] barrack and you know the story of
[59:47] Deborah and barrack and how they went in
[59:49] jointly and together to battle what were
[59:52] these men the Bible calls them judges
[59:54] but I don't want you to think of judges
[59:57] like a court judge but actually more
[1:00:00] properly that word could be Savior now
[1:00:06] not the Savior there's only one Savior
[1:00:08] just like there's no healer amongst this
[1:00:11] there's only one healer but God brother
[1:00:14] Branham says uses the agency of man and
[1:00:17] through faith in that gift or that
[1:00:19] vessel God can heal you through the
[1:00:22] preaching of the word God can heal you
[1:00:24] you notice how important is to believe
[1:00:27] the vessel whom God had sent that's why
[1:00:30] the angel of the Lord tells brother
[1:00:32] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:00:37] nothing will stand in your way not even
[1:00:40] cancer what was it it wasn't that
[1:00:42] brother branham was God it wasn't that
[1:00:44] brother branham was a healer it wasn't
[1:00:46] that brother Branham wasn't absolute but
[1:00:48] he was a representative of the mercy in
[1:00:53] the grace of God through divine healing
[1:00:55] and if you could believe on the vessel
[1:00:57] whom God had sent oh this is for free
[1:01:00] here today if you could believe on the
[1:01:02] man God sent to your life you can
[1:01:05] receive deliveries that's why it's so
[1:01:08] important for you to have confidence in
[1:01:10] your pastor that he's more than just a
[1:01:12] man getting behind a desk and revealing
[1:01:14] thoughts and ideas and concepts to you
[1:01:17] but it's God using the agency of a man
[1:01:20] to deliver you out of your situation to
[1:01:24] deliver you out of your oppressors thank
[1:01:32] you lord
[1:01:33] notice these Philistines would come he'd
[1:01:36] raise up a savior he'd raised up a judge
[1:01:39] he'd raised up they were saviors of the
[1:01:42] situation he'd raise up listings we all
[1:01:47] know the story of Gideon and how Gideon
[1:01:50] has an army and we all we know the
[1:01:52] entire story even afterwards they try to
[1:01:55] they try to raise up Gideon even after
[1:01:58] all the victory that Gideon has the
[1:02:00] people look to Gideon and say a wool
[1:02:02] will crown you King and then your son
[1:02:04] will reign in your stead and Gideon says
[1:02:06] Oh DUP a minute he already have a king
[1:02:08] his name is Jehovah
[1:02:11] you just got to obey your king you see
[1:02:17] that Judge was sent to turn their hearts
[1:02:19] back to God king of haze or we find in
[1:02:24] judges would raise up and there was a
[1:02:26] mighty story of Toula Midianites would
[1:02:28] come in and you had the jet the judge or
[1:02:31] the savior chair then you had the
[1:02:33] Amalekites and God would raise up jephta
[1:02:36] and then the Philistines would come
[1:02:38] again and and through this entire
[1:02:39] history of 52 years there was going to
[1:02:42] be oppressors and oppressors and then
[1:02:44] got a raise up a judge and he
[1:02:46] to deliver those people then the Ipsen
[1:02:49] came and the ammonites came and then God
[1:02:50] rose up Elon the ammonites come again
[1:02:53] later and God raises up another judge
[1:02:55] named abdun then we find the story of
[1:02:58] the Philistines and God raises up Samson
[1:03:02] Samson was not about a strong man it was
[1:03:05] actually about a very weak man Samson
[1:03:09] was not a great big muscle-bound man
[1:03:12] with you know the mister atlas or some
[1:03:16] kind of great bodybuilder that's brother
[1:03:17] madam said even that wasn't Samson
[1:03:19] if Samson was some big you know
[1:03:22] muscle-bound guy why would Delilah look
[1:03:25] at him and say wherein does your great
[1:03:27] strength lie because within him he
[1:03:32] looked like nothing but it was the
[1:03:34] anointing of God on his life
[1:03:37] you see Samson was not the story of how
[1:03:40] strong the human is it was how weak a
[1:03:43] human is apart from the anointing of God
[1:03:47] and God would raise up this pattern of
[1:03:53] judges he would raise up oppressors but
[1:03:56] notice what judges I don't want you I
[1:03:57] want you to leave that there brother if
[1:03:59] you have a Bible use it today
[1:04:00] judges chapter to notice the Lord raised
[1:04:03] up judges verse 16 of judges - which
[1:04:05] delivered them out of the hand of those
[1:04:07] that spoiled them yet they would not
[1:04:09] hearken under their judges 'but went
[1:04:11] whoring after other gods bowed
[1:04:13] themselves to them notice what brother
[1:04:15] Branham says here just hold your place
[1:04:16] there in verse 17 brother Branham says
[1:04:18] in the Ephesian Church age the next
[1:04:20] slide now history keeps repeating itself
[1:04:25] this is the pattern or the cycle that
[1:04:28] you find in judges it's a constant
[1:04:31] repetitive circle history keeps
[1:04:34] repeating itself in the generation of
[1:04:37] Israel we see revival in one generation
[1:04:39] only to see the fires fading in the next
[1:04:42] in the third generation embers may be
[1:04:44] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[1:04:47] may be no vestige whatsoever of that
[1:04:49] original flame then God lights the fire
[1:04:52] again and the same process is repeated
[1:04:57] notice these words
[1:05:00] history keeps repeating the same process
[1:05:03] is repeated the fervent desire to please
[1:05:08] God the passion to know his word the cry
[1:05:11] for reaching out in the spirit all
[1:05:13] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:05:15] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:05:17] God its cooled off and became a bit
[1:05:20] formal that's what was happening back
[1:05:22] there to the Ephesians that second
[1:05:24] generation coming on was just like
[1:05:27] Israel now he goes and points back at
[1:05:30] this pattern again this great cycle this
[1:05:32] process this is what you find when you
[1:05:35] read the story of Judges you find a
[1:05:37] deliverer an oppressor God delivers then
[1:05:41] they sin then they repent then God
[1:05:43] delivers then they sin then they repent
[1:05:45] then God sends a deliverer and you find
[1:05:48] this constant cycle repeating over and
[1:05:51] over and over listen what brother
[1:05:54] Branham says about the cycle he says
[1:05:56] when they the second generation was just
[1:05:58] like Israel they demanded a king to be
[1:05:59] like other nations when they did that
[1:06:02] they rejected God but they did it anyway
[1:06:09] that is the history of the church it
[1:06:13] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[1:06:16] things they used to do and start doing
[1:06:18] things they wouldn't do initially they
[1:06:20] change their manner of dress their
[1:06:22] attitudes and their behavior they get
[1:06:24] lacs
[1:06:25] that's what Ephesus means relaxed and
[1:06:28] drifting and then he says that cycle of
[1:06:34] revival and death has never failed
[1:06:39] because this is a pattern of judges the
[1:06:43] pattern of the judges in your own life
[1:06:46] and people's lives are so much like
[1:06:48] judges - where are we going cycles and
[1:06:52] in patterns and revivals and we go from
[1:06:56] one revival to the next revival brother
[1:06:59] Branham says history just continues to
[1:07:01] repeat itself on the generation of
[1:07:03] Israel we see fire in one generation
[1:07:06] then the second the fire phase then the
[1:07:08] third it goes down then the fourth
[1:07:10] there's no vestige of that original
[1:07:11] flame then that revival
[1:07:14] Dyess than god likes the fire again and
[1:07:16] that cycle just keeps repeating that
[1:07:19] cycle just keeps repeating judges is
[1:07:22] about cycles it's about a circle but I'm
[1:07:25] going to tell you about another book
[1:07:26] named The Book of Ruth and the Book of
[1:07:29] Ruth doesn't have any cycles it doesn't
[1:07:31] have a circle it's actually a line a
[1:07:34] straight linear path and God says I want
[1:07:38] you to come out of judges get off of the
[1:07:40] pattern of revival and then death get
[1:07:43] order get off of the cycle of up and
[1:07:46] down and step into a little land named
[1:07:48] Bethlehem where there's a girl named
[1:07:51] Ruth and God says there's going to be a
[1:07:53] difference between judges and Ruth
[1:07:55] judges is going to be a circle but Ruth
[1:07:58] is going to be a royal line and brother
[1:08:03] Branham says this is that cycle that
[1:08:05] circle and and and what you find is is
[1:08:09] that people's lives are so much the same
[1:08:12] you notice what happens to Israel they
[1:08:15] begin to get revival fires burning only
[1:08:18] to see the generation fade in the next
[1:08:21] and he says and that psycho just repeats
[1:08:24] itself they get away from God they go on
[1:08:28] that roundabout of life that circle of
[1:08:32] life
[1:08:32] you know what that roundabout is is that
[1:08:35] that roundabout circle that circle of
[1:08:37] judges where you know you get you going
[1:08:40] to life and you step on the roundabout
[1:08:41] in life and then you grow up and you get
[1:08:44] a job and you get a good career you
[1:08:46] marry a girl or you marry a boy if
[1:08:49] you're a girl and and and you you you
[1:08:51] have a family and you have a home and
[1:08:53] then you get a job and you get in that
[1:08:55] rut that circle you go to church on
[1:08:57] Sunday go to work on Monday and then you
[1:08:59] just go after work you come home and you
[1:09:02] veg on entertainment you go to bed you
[1:09:04] wake up the next day and you go back to
[1:09:06] your same job you go back to church on
[1:09:08] Sunday back to the career on Monday and
[1:09:11] on Tuesday on on Wednesday and you're
[1:09:13] going in that circle you go home you say
[1:09:15] hello to the family you watch a
[1:09:17] entertainment you feed yourself from all
[1:09:19] the things in life you deal with all the
[1:09:21] problems you wake up you do it all over
[1:09:23] again the next
[1:09:25] then on Wednesday you go to church then
[1:09:26] you go on Thursday back to work and
[1:09:28] you're on that cycle over and over again
[1:09:31] and you work a job and you work a career
[1:09:34] and then after 40 years or so you retire
[1:09:38] and then you step off the roundabout
[1:09:42] about the spot where you stepped on and
[1:09:45] you go through that circle over and over
[1:09:49] and so many people are on this pattern
[1:09:51] of a circle with no purpose in their
[1:09:53] life no purpose never identified the
[1:09:56] plan of God for their life they just
[1:09:57] live in a life they go to church they go
[1:09:59] to work they go to church they go to
[1:10:01] work they raise kids and they go through
[1:10:03] that entire round about you know the
[1:10:07] point have you ever been in the traffic
[1:10:08] circle around about you know what those
[1:10:10] are here in Tennessee we got a lot of
[1:10:12] them back home you know the purpose of
[1:10:14] that roundabout is not to stay on the
[1:10:16] roundabout and if you do you get the
[1:10:20] horn honked at you and people wonder if
[1:10:22] you're from there the purpose of the
[1:10:24] roundabout is to get off of the
[1:10:26] roundabout and get back on the line that
[1:10:30] God has for your life I've got a very
[1:10:32] simple message for you this morning get
[1:10:34] off the roundabout of judges and coming
[1:10:37] to the Book of Ruth where there's a
[1:10:39] purpose and a pattern for your life get
[1:10:44] off of the circle of life of just going
[1:10:47] through life and going through the
[1:10:49] motions and say god I don't want to go
[1:10:52] in a rut and in a pattern oh is there
[1:10:54] somebody here today they could say God
[1:10:56] take me off of the roundabout of life
[1:10:59] let me step out of judges and let me
[1:11:01] step into Ruth let me step into the
[1:11:04] pattern and the life that God has for me
[1:11:08] hallelujah
[1:11:15] come out of judges and come into Ruth
[1:11:18] you see Ruth was the answer to judges
[1:11:23] Ruth was the answer to this cycle of
[1:11:27] revival and death as you study this
[1:11:30] pattern over and over and over again
[1:11:33] you'll find that every time the people
[1:11:35] got close to God God sent a deliverer
[1:11:38] notice what happens here as we go
[1:11:39] through this God would send delivers but
[1:11:42] God gives them this this law of blessing
[1:11:44] and cursing and he says then it shall
[1:11:46] come to pass this is Deuteronomy chapter
[1:11:48] 28 it shall come to pass if thou shalt
[1:11:51] hearken diligently unto the voice of the
[1:11:53] LORD thy God to observe and to do all
[1:11:56] his commandments which I command thee
[1:11:57] this day if the LORD thy God will set
[1:11:59] the own a high above and I set the own
[1:12:01] high above all nations of the earth and
[1:12:03] all these blessings shall come on thee
[1:12:07] and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken
[1:12:09] unto the voice of the LORD thy God verse
[1:12:13] 15 but it shall come to pass if thou
[1:12:15] will not hearken unto the voice of the
[1:12:19] LORD thy God to observe to do all his
[1:12:22] Commandments and his statutes which I
[1:12:24] command thee this day that all these
[1:12:27] curses shall come upon thee and overtake
[1:12:30] thee you see living for God is very
[1:12:35] simple
[1:12:37] you're either living under blessing or
[1:12:40] you're living under curse this is the
[1:12:44] pattern you see in Israel as long as
[1:12:46] they were close to God
[1:12:48] blessings came but the minute they got
[1:12:50] away from God and got away from His
[1:12:53] Prophet
[1:12:53] and got away from his teaching and away
[1:12:55] from his Commandments as soon as
[1:12:57] obedience leaves your life cursings
[1:13:00] follow says that that simple brother mat
[1:13:04] it is that simple you either live under
[1:13:07] blessing or you live under curse and
[1:13:11] when you disobey the Lord when you're
[1:13:14] disobedient in your life cursings come
[1:13:17] in so much that the Bible says they
[1:13:20] overtake you
[1:13:23] and sorrow comes upon sorrow and pain
[1:13:26] comes upon pain and hurt comes upon her
[1:13:30] and damage comes and leads to more
[1:13:32] damage this is what we see in Israel you
[1:13:35] see the problem with this cycle this
[1:13:37] circle this roundabout is you're not
[1:13:40] just going on a circle literally like
[1:13:42] this but it's a spiraling circle where
[1:13:45] you go lower and you go lower and you go
[1:13:48] lower and you go lower and you go lower
[1:13:50] and you go lower it's a cycle that leads
[1:13:54] you down further and further and further
[1:13:57] and further you even watch Jonah in his
[1:14:00] life when he rebelled against God the
[1:14:02] Bible says he went down to Nineveh he
[1:14:05] went down to the boat he went down into
[1:14:07] the bottom of the boat then he went down
[1:14:08] into the belly of the well he went lower
[1:14:12] and lower and lower and lower and this
[1:14:15] is the cycle of God in your life or the
[1:14:17] cycle of death the recycle the cycle of
[1:14:20] a circle or a line in your life that
[1:14:24] roundabout will take you lower and lower
[1:14:27] and lower that cycle will go lower and
[1:14:31] lower and lower where you have no
[1:14:35] purpose you're just aimlessly
[1:14:38] something very dangerous and wondering
[1:14:40] in life whether Branham says what
[1:14:44] happens after a while a spiritual
[1:14:45] amnesia sets in you go around and around
[1:14:48] and around and around and around you
[1:14:50] know what happens after a while when you
[1:14:51] go around and around and around do it
[1:14:53] sometime you get dizzy you lose your way
[1:14:59] spiritually you lose your way you lose
[1:15:03] your direction you don't know left you
[1:15:05] don't know right you don't know forwards
[1:15:06] you don't know backwards and you're
[1:15:08] trying to raise kids and your kids need
[1:15:09] the Holy Ghost and you're fighting
[1:15:12] devils and your marriage is in trouble
[1:15:13] and you're going around and around and
[1:15:15] around and around and around and
[1:15:17] everyone in your life needs direction
[1:15:19] but you're spinning in a circle
[1:15:23] and you go around and around and around
[1:15:27] but when you're on the line God has a
[1:15:33] purpose in your life your life has a
[1:15:36] purpose your job has a purpose your
[1:15:39] career has a purpose your church has a
[1:15:41] purpose you have a purpose in life
[1:15:44] everything just clicks and make sense
[1:15:48] you're living for a purpose you're
[1:15:50] serving God for a purpose you're raising
[1:15:52] a family for a purpose for a line for a
[1:15:56] plan but just as in the book of Judges
[1:16:01] the people gets away from the law of
[1:16:03] Moses away from the Levitical order and
[1:16:06] now their life goes from a line to a
[1:16:09] circle and anytime you get away from God
[1:16:12] your life turns into a circle it's a
[1:16:17] circle or line never would have thought
[1:16:22] we would've been back to elementary
[1:16:24] school would we back to shapes but this
[1:16:28] is how true this pattern this principle
[1:16:30] is in your life do you study judges it
[1:16:32] was a constant circle over and over and
[1:16:37] over again it's a circle the people get
[1:16:40] away from the law and then their life
[1:16:42] becomes a cycle I want you to look at
[1:16:44] this next slide brother if you can just
[1:16:45] go to to a few slides down in fact go
[1:16:48] all the way down to the very last one
[1:16:50] notice this pattern that you see in
[1:16:53] judges and here's this constant refrain
[1:16:55] in those days there was no king in
[1:16:59] Israel every man did that which was
[1:17:03] right in his own eyes when you walk by
[1:17:08] your own eyes this is how you walk you
[1:17:12] may think you have direction you may
[1:17:14] think you're planning your life you may
[1:17:16] think everything's working you got a
[1:17:17] plan you got a career
[1:17:19] raising kids getting more money bigger
[1:17:21] job bigger bank account bigger house but
[1:17:23] if you ever pull back and you look from
[1:17:25] the sky view your life is just a big
[1:17:29] circle
[1:17:31] and then they allow compromise you
[1:17:35] notice this pattern of sin notice that
[1:17:38] circle I have there this was the cycle
[1:17:39] this cycle in the book of Judges repeats
[1:17:42] seven times God's number of completion
[1:17:47] God's number of perfection both for evil
[1:17:51] and for good seven times the cycle
[1:17:55] repeats the people with sin they would
[1:17:58] go into slavery to that sin because
[1:18:00] that's what sin brings it brings bondage
[1:18:02] and it makes you a slave it doesn't as
[1:18:06] we preached last night it doesn't give
[1:18:07] anything back it just takes away and
[1:18:09] this cycle and judges as they would sin
[1:18:13] there would be sedition that would be
[1:18:15] either would be adjusted to our total
[1:18:17] backsliding and turning away from God
[1:18:18] and then that cycle would lead them from
[1:18:21] sin it would lead them to slavery and
[1:18:23] then from slavery they would lead to
[1:18:25] repentance and they would begin to cry
[1:18:27] out and call out to God say God deliver
[1:18:29] me God kill me God save me deliver me
[1:18:32] from this problem deliver me from these
[1:18:34] chains again then God would send a judge
[1:18:36] you'd send a deliverer it send a Savior
[1:18:39] and God would set him free and then
[1:18:42] they'd go right back notice what the
[1:18:44] Bible says here it says it came to pass
[1:18:46] in verse nineteen when the judge was
[1:18:49] dead that they returned and corrupted
[1:18:52] themselves more than their fathers so
[1:18:56] how long would they stay in that revival
[1:18:58] as long as the judge lived but as soon
[1:19:01] as the judge died they'd go right back
[1:19:05] to sin the only problem is this time it
[1:19:07] was worse and if you're not careful when
[1:19:12] you live in the pattern of judges you'll
[1:19:13] get freed from addictions and freed from
[1:19:16] problems and freed from issues you'll
[1:19:18] come to this altar you'll get excited in
[1:19:20] a meeting that God will come down and
[1:19:21] deliver you and if you're not careful
[1:19:23] you'll go right back to that sin and
[1:19:26] Jesus says when an unclean spirit is
[1:19:29] going out of a man he leaves and he
[1:19:32] finds the house notice the house is
[1:19:33] clean and sweat it says when the unclean
[1:19:35] spirit it's going out of a man he says
[1:19:39] it goeth to Dry places seeking rest
[1:19:42] because that spirits
[1:19:44] gotta have a house to live in and he
[1:19:47] says but when it findeth none it cometh
[1:19:50] back to the house that he was delivered
[1:19:53] from and Jesus says and he finds it
[1:19:56] swept and garnished and clean you know
[1:19:58] one of the most dangerous spots you can
[1:20:01] be in as a Christian it's clean but not
[1:20:05] filled one of the most deadly spots we
[1:20:11] see it in people's lives so many times
[1:20:13] brother branham said they live in
[1:20:14] varying degrees of sanctification they
[1:20:17] live in this pattern of judges where
[1:20:19] they're clean but then they go right
[1:20:21] back and brother Jesus says when he
[1:20:23] comes he finds the house swept clean and
[1:20:25] garnished but it's empty and he says
[1:20:28] then it goes and gets seven more spirits
[1:20:30] worse than the first and Jesus says the
[1:20:34] condition of that man is worse than
[1:20:38] before the spirit had left time you
[1:20:42] would be better dirty than clean but
[1:20:47] empty so that's a bold statement well I
[1:20:51] got the words of Jesus to back it up he
[1:20:54] says the condition of that man is worse
[1:20:56] than when he first started and we get to
[1:21:01] a place if we're not careful we live
[1:21:03] under such the pattern of judges that
[1:21:05] God cleans us god saves us but we go
[1:21:09] right back to the sin and you watch a
[1:21:11] person's life if they go back after sin
[1:21:13] after revival after a deliverance after
[1:21:15] a move of God that neck sin is always
[1:21:18] worse than the first and that bondage
[1:21:21] it's greater and it gets greater and it
[1:21:23] gets stronger and it gets stronger and
[1:21:25] it gets stronger and then it leads them
[1:21:31] to slavery and then you find them as
[1:21:35] they come back and they begin to weep
[1:21:37] and they come back to repentance but if
[1:21:40] you're not careful if you stay in the
[1:21:42] pattern of judges and you never make it
[1:21:44] out of judges into Ruth you go through
[1:21:47] that cycle for year after year after
[1:21:49] year after year
[1:21:53] compromise
[1:21:55] they allowed men to stay in the valley
[1:21:58] they got victory on the mountain but
[1:22:00] they never got victory in the valley
[1:22:01] that's what judges to records judges one
[1:22:04] it says that they got victory over all
[1:22:07] of the over the Canaanites and the
[1:22:09] mountains but they could never get
[1:22:10] victory in the valley and what was and
[1:22:14] it was compromised on the Word of God
[1:22:16] God said drive them all out all of them
[1:22:19] out of your life those allowances led to
[1:22:23] alliances because they never drove out
[1:22:27] all the enemies they said hey since
[1:22:29] you're gonna live here anyways let's
[1:22:31] just be allies you know the problem with
[1:22:34] that it was okay for the parents but
[1:22:37] guess whose eyes those young men started
[1:22:39] seeing started seeing non-israelite
[1:22:45] girls and the Bible says they allowed
[1:22:47] mixed marriages and God was so clear are
[1:22:54] you with me here today I don't want to
[1:22:56] go here by myself I want you to come
[1:22:58] with me God was so clear on mixed
[1:23:01] marriages
[1:23:02] he was so clear you're to marry a Jew is
[1:23:05] to marry a Jew and Israelite marries an
[1:23:07] Israelite because what happens when an
[1:23:10] Israelite marries a Canaanite tell you
[1:23:15] what happens it never works never works
[1:23:20] let me tell you something young people
[1:23:23] ought to stop here just for a moment be
[1:23:25] careful who you give your heart to be
[1:23:27] careful who you give your emotions to
[1:23:29] and you say gods leading me to date that
[1:23:31] girl from school just to go to church
[1:23:33] know this she believed the message no
[1:23:35] she's a good Baptist girl she loves the
[1:23:37] Lord she's got a real heart for God be
[1:23:39] careful we've gotten to such a place in
[1:23:44] our own ranks and the message to where
[1:23:46] we were sort of compromising to what we
[1:23:48] used to preach and what we used to
[1:23:50] believe
[1:23:55] these are the men are they good people
[1:23:58] I'm sure they're good people
[1:23:59] and very rare cases I've seen it seen
[1:24:03] God do something Mira miracle very
[1:24:05] special and God brought that person to
[1:24:07] the truth but very rarely you say
[1:24:12] brother Matt does that mean that we just
[1:24:14] you know everybody's let me tell you
[1:24:16] something young people some of the worst
[1:24:18] girls and some of the worst boys girls
[1:24:21] are sitting right in your church don't
[1:24:24] think just because they go to this
[1:24:26] church so they claim the message or
[1:24:27] believe the Prophet you better be led of
[1:24:30] the Spirit of God you better say do they
[1:24:32] have the same passion and zeal that I
[1:24:34] have for the Lord and the truth and His
[1:24:37] Word does my heart match their heart
[1:24:40] [Applause]
[1:24:42] they'll lead you astray
[1:24:48] booyah they compromise them when
[1:24:55] compromise comes conduct changes the
[1:24:58] conduct leads to sin slavery then
[1:25:00] repentance then salvation then back to
[1:25:03] sin and back to repentance then back to
[1:25:06] slavery back to repentance back to
[1:25:07] salvation and it brings corruption to
[1:25:10] the children of Israel it leads them and
[1:25:13] binds them in idolatry and immorality
[1:25:15] and we noticed this pattern just repeats
[1:25:18] over and over and over seven times and
[1:25:22] judges we see this pattern repeat the
[1:25:26] cycle of revival and death this getting
[1:25:32] away from God and living under the
[1:25:34] cursing of God but do you not want to
[1:25:37] know how to live under the blessing you
[1:25:38] see cursing or blessing is not a choice
[1:25:41] it's not you know like in school you
[1:25:43] have your you have your your required
[1:25:45] assignments then you have your
[1:25:46] extracurricular stuff you can just
[1:25:48] choose sort of an option if you want to
[1:25:50] do it or not well blessing or cursing
[1:25:52] don't work that way it's a required
[1:25:54] assignment you're either gonna live
[1:25:56] under the blessing of God or you're
[1:25:58] gonna live under the curse of God you
[1:26:00] say what would determinate your
[1:26:02] obedience to God or your disobedience to
[1:26:04] God
[1:26:05] as long as they live disobedient
[1:26:08] cursings followed their life but let me
[1:26:11] tell you something brother if they lived
[1:26:12] obediently blessings was a automatic
[1:26:17] blessings came automatically from God in
[1:26:20] fact the blessings were so great God
[1:26:22] said if you'll live close to my word and
[1:26:25] be obedient I'm not just gonna pour out
[1:26:27] blessings but those blessings are going
[1:26:29] to become so strong in your life they
[1:26:32] overtake you you say what are they
[1:26:35] overtake they overtake your issues they
[1:26:38] overtake your problems they overtake
[1:26:40] your burdens they overtake your family
[1:26:42] they overtake your children oh they
[1:26:45] overtake your church and God says I'll
[1:26:47] bless you abundantly I'll pour out a
[1:26:50] blessing
[1:26:51] it'll be so big you can't even contain
[1:26:54] it I want that kind of a blessing here
[1:26:57] today I say God's that my life live so
[1:27:00] close to you that I live under the
[1:27:02] blessing of God it's going to be a
[1:27:09] circle or a line it depends on if your
[1:27:13] life is in touch with the Lord in
[1:27:19] Israel's life their pattern
[1:27:21] unfortunately so sadly as you follow
[1:27:24] this book and you go all the way through
[1:27:26] the history of this book you'll find
[1:27:28] this pattern we come to the very end of
[1:27:31] Judges the very last part of Judges and
[1:27:35] it's a very sad story in fact I can't
[1:27:38] even repeat some of the stories here in
[1:27:40] judges if you've ever studied them and
[1:27:42] studied the entire book and the mixed
[1:27:44] audience some of the things you read
[1:27:45] about are so bad and they're so vile and
[1:27:49] so filthy you almost can't even believe
[1:27:52] it's in the Bible you can't believe
[1:27:55] these are stories that you read out of
[1:27:56] they'll tell you what your open your
[1:27:58] Bible sometime read something you've
[1:27:59] never read before you go look at the
[1:28:03] last parts of judges this book the Bible
[1:28:07] tells us of this historical time where
[1:28:10] you have both the northern tribe and the
[1:28:12] southern tribe you have Dan in the north
[1:28:15] and you have Benjamin in
[1:28:17] Souths and what you find at the very
[1:28:20] last story of judges after this pattern
[1:28:23] of savior deliverer then back to sin
[1:28:25] than to slavery then to repentance then
[1:28:27] Savior then back to sin then back to
[1:28:30] slavery then back to repentance then
[1:28:32] Savior and God leads them through this
[1:28:33] pattern over and over history keeps
[1:28:36] repeating itself but we come to the very
[1:28:38] end of this book and the Bible tells a
[1:28:41] story of both the northern tribe of Dan
[1:28:45] and the Benjamin tribe of the south and
[1:28:48] the Bible says what you have is two
[1:28:51] Levites both one in the north and one in
[1:28:54] the south and it's actually a Levite
[1:28:56] that leads both of them into calamity
[1:29:00] preachers are sometimes God's biggest
[1:29:03] trouble a man where he gets off on the
[1:29:08] will of God or the anointed of God for
[1:29:10] his life a leader can lead can do more
[1:29:14] damage a leader can do more damage and
[1:29:19] and I'm not just talking about a leader
[1:29:21] as a pastor because pastors are leaders
[1:29:24] preachers are leaders but let me tell
[1:29:26] you something fathers your leaders too
[1:29:28] and a man doing what's right in his own
[1:29:32] eyes and he's led astray can do more
[1:29:35] damage and it can wreck that family and
[1:29:37] that wife and those children worse than
[1:29:40] the devil ever could and we find even in
[1:29:44] the north there's a man named Micah I'll
[1:29:46] just tell you these stories and maybe
[1:29:48] you've never heard them before but you
[1:29:51] find in the story the story of this man
[1:29:53] named Micah and the Bible says that
[1:29:55] Micah steals 1,100 pieces of silver from
[1:29:59] his mother this is the LAT one of the
[1:30:01] last stories and this northern tribe and
[1:30:03] the Bible says that this man Micah takes
[1:30:06] these 1,100 pieces of silver he takes
[1:30:09] them for himself and now his mother he
[1:30:11] starts to get very fearful because now
[1:30:14] his mother begins to say curse it as the
[1:30:16] man who stole she starts to pray
[1:30:18] cursings upon his life and the scripture
[1:30:21] records that this man gets so fearful
[1:30:23] Micah comes back and says here and he
[1:30:26] gives the silver back to his mother and
[1:30:29] his mother looks at him
[1:30:31] you've done a good job son I'm glad that
[1:30:33] you brought them back you've been a good
[1:30:35] boy and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
[1:30:37] take that silver and I'm gonna make you
[1:30:40] a little silver God and I'm gonna give
[1:30:42] him to you and I'm gonna give you and
[1:30:45] the mother actually creates and she
[1:30:47] begins to take the silver and melt it
[1:30:49] and she creates an idol for her son
[1:30:54] sometimes it's parents who shove idols
[1:30:57] down the faces of their kids sometimes
[1:31:02] mothers and fathers are trying to live
[1:31:03] out the dream or childhood they never
[1:31:05] had in their life through their
[1:31:08] children's life they shove them into
[1:31:12] sports when they don't want to play
[1:31:13] sports they shove them into school when
[1:31:16] they'd want to stay homeschooled they
[1:31:18] shove them into career when they just
[1:31:20] wanted to be a carpenter or a framer or
[1:31:22] a plumber thank God for plumbers and
[1:31:29] they can live their life or their
[1:31:32] childhood they give their children a
[1:31:34] silver god
[1:31:39] and this mother gives Micah this God and
[1:31:44] now you notice what mother says I'll
[1:31:46] give you this silver God and I'm gonna
[1:31:48] give it to you and you could put in your
[1:31:50] collection of God's because her son was
[1:31:53] already collecting little idols Micah
[1:31:55] already had a chest full a trunk full of
[1:31:57] closet full of idols idolatry leads to
[1:32:00] more idolatry and she says I'm gonna
[1:32:04] give you and you can add it to your
[1:32:05] little collection of idols what a mom
[1:32:08] and Micah now grows up and Micah has a
[1:32:12] son and Micah makes his son a priest and
[1:32:16] Micah looks at his son now as priests
[1:32:19] once a son was not a Levite but this is
[1:32:21] how backslidden Israel is at this point
[1:32:23] makes him a preacher when he's not
[1:32:26] called to be a preacher makes him a
[1:32:28] leader when he's not called to be a
[1:32:30] leader
[1:32:30] some men are called to lead others are
[1:32:33] called to follow God is called both and
[1:32:35] ones not greater than the other but you
[1:32:40] better find your position and if you're
[1:32:42] a leader you better be a leader and not
[1:32:44] a follower and if you're a follower you
[1:32:46] better be a follower and don't try to be
[1:32:48] a leader find your position on how God
[1:32:51] has made you where God has called you
[1:32:53] get off of the circle get on the line
[1:32:57] because God has a plan for every single
[1:33:00] individual's life God has a purpose and
[1:33:03] a calling that's why the Bible says make
[1:33:05] your calling and your election sure and
[1:33:11] she says I'm gonna make you a priest and
[1:33:13] she take he take Mike it takes his son
[1:33:15] and makes him a priest even though the
[1:33:17] little boy wasn't a Levite but now here
[1:33:19] what you have in Micah's house is now
[1:33:22] there's a real Levite running retreating
[1:33:25] from the southern tribes he's here a
[1:33:27] scandal a great bad situation in
[1:33:30] Bethlehem Judy of all places and the
[1:33:33] southern Levite this priest is running
[1:33:35] for his life and he runs into Mike as he
[1:33:38] runs to the northern tribes and he goes
[1:33:41] into Micah's house and now this priest
[1:33:44] this Levite running to the North lodges
[1:33:47] in the house of Micah where his son is a
[1:33:50] false priest and now this Levi starts to
[1:33:53] see the silver gods and the idols and
[1:33:56] then Micah's house and he sees this
[1:33:59] priest over him and now Micah offers him
[1:34:02] a position now he's a real Levite he's
[1:34:05] really caught of God and Micah says I'm
[1:34:07] gonna offer you something if you'll stay
[1:34:10] here in my house and be my private
[1:34:12] preacher my private priest my private
[1:34:15] pastor I'll pay you a salary and you can
[1:34:20] be the priest over all these idols and
[1:34:23] do you want to know what a backslidden
[1:34:25] heart of a leader does it becomes a
[1:34:30] hireling for money and it takes a gift
[1:34:34] that God really put in his life and he
[1:34:36] sir comes to the pressure and the Bible
[1:34:41] says that this real Levite priest this
[1:34:44] is the end of judges this real Levite
[1:34:46] priest becomes a priest over the house
[1:34:49] of these idols and these gods he takes
[1:34:52] the salary and becomes a private priest
[1:34:55] for this one single family and now
[1:35:02] what's going to happen through this as
[1:35:04] Micah says my son wasn't a priest but
[1:35:06] now I've got a real priest I've got a
[1:35:08] real Levite I've got a real man of God
[1:35:11] but he didn't have a real man of God he
[1:35:14] had a backslidden heart a lukewarm heart
[1:35:18] of a leader who used his gift a real
[1:35:20] gift that God placed in his life for the
[1:35:23] wrong purpose but now here comes a
[1:35:30] little bit of time later take that story
[1:35:32] and time goes on a little bit later in
[1:35:35] the tribes of dan dan who failed to take
[1:35:38] the land and judges that God had given
[1:35:40] him in the south now Dan migrates north
[1:35:44] and now Dan lodges in the same house
[1:35:49] where you had a preacher who wasn't
[1:35:51] called
[1:35:51] and now you have a preacher a priest
[1:35:53] who's serving as a private priest and
[1:35:55] now Dan comes into this house and he
[1:35:59] sees all the gods and he sees the
[1:36:01] private priest and Dan says I've got an
[1:36:03] idea
[1:36:04] hey man you're a real Levite
[1:36:06] are you making just a little bit of
[1:36:08] money we'll pay even more money than
[1:36:10] what they're paying you and you could be
[1:36:12] the priest over an entire tribe not just
[1:36:16] a single family and guess what that
[1:36:21] backs let him priest did he said sign me
[1:36:25] up the Levite accepts it takes the job
[1:36:32] this Levite who is so backslidden in his
[1:36:36] heart to where he's preaching over idols
[1:36:39] known idols known idolatry in this
[1:36:42] single house but he never says a word
[1:36:44] against it and now Dan hires him as his
[1:36:47] Levite and that's why Dan is recorded as
[1:36:52] one of the most idolatrous tribes in all
[1:36:55] of Israel because a leader brought in
[1:36:59] idolatry and it corrupted the entire
[1:37:01] church with idolatry and just as Judas
[1:37:11] Iscariot goes missing from the Twelve
[1:37:13] Apostles Dan goes missing in the Book of
[1:37:18] Revelations say brother Matt how because
[1:37:24] one man one bad mom one evil son one
[1:37:28] evil priest that cycle led worse and
[1:37:31] worse and worse and worse and down they
[1:37:36] go and down they go and down they go I'm
[1:37:39] just on a cycle in a circle you're going
[1:37:41] further and lower lower lower and Dan is
[1:37:45] wiped off dennis has taken off he's he
[1:37:50] goes missing the Bible doesn't even
[1:37:51] record him in Revelations and notice
[1:37:55] what happens because of priests because
[1:37:58] a Levite it's a very sad story and now
[1:38:03] the other one is even worse that's the
[1:38:05] north
[1:38:05] now let's hear about the south now the
[1:38:09] southern tribe of Judah Benjamin
[1:38:12] it's another Levite a man from Ephraim a
[1:38:15] Levite
[1:38:16] from the tribe of Ephraim takes a
[1:38:19] you buy
[1:38:20] from guess where Bethlehem of Judea he
[1:38:24] takes a concubine and the Bible says
[1:38:26] through this story of their life that
[1:38:28] she eventually gets fed up with this man
[1:38:31] and she leaves him and runs back to her
[1:38:33] daddy and now the story goes where this
[1:38:36] Levite from the southern tribe of
[1:38:38] Benjamin is running to the house of this
[1:38:40] girl her father and the Bible says that
[1:38:42] they argue and he's trying to get her
[1:38:44] back and he argues with the dad and they
[1:38:47] argue all afternoon and all morning and
[1:38:50] finally finally he gives in and gives
[1:38:52] his daughter back to this man but now
[1:38:55] it's very late in the day and they try
[1:38:58] to travel out of Bethlehem Judea and the
[1:39:01] Bible says that they travel through the
[1:39:02] night but it gets dark and then make it
[1:39:05] to the town of Jerusalem which at that
[1:39:07] time was still a pagan City and that
[1:39:10] Levite says there's no way we can settle
[1:39:13] down here for the night we've got to go
[1:39:15] in a little bit further so they move on
[1:39:17] into the tribe of Benjamin and the Bible
[1:39:21] says that they make it to Gibeah where
[1:39:23] the Benjamites are settled when they get
[1:39:26] there they start to set up a tent this
[1:39:28] man in his concubine and the Bible says
[1:39:31] that a man of Gibeah walks out and says
[1:39:32] hey you're never going to make it out
[1:39:34] here in that tent you need to come
[1:39:35] inside and he invites this man this
[1:39:38] Levite priests from the southern tribe
[1:39:40] into his home and the story goes that he
[1:39:43] stays in this home he goes in there in
[1:39:46] the house and before he can get settled
[1:39:49] in that home there comes banging at the
[1:39:52] door and it's a group of homosexuals now
[1:39:58] I told you you go read this story of
[1:39:59] judges guarantee you never read some of
[1:40:01] this almost exactly like what happens in
[1:40:06] lot in Sodom and these men are banging
[1:40:10] on the door saying send out the man who
[1:40:13] came to camps in doubt that Levite out
[1:40:15] here and that man of Gibeah gets so
[1:40:18] scared that the Bible records that he
[1:40:21] takes that he takes that that the his
[1:40:23] daughter the concubine of this man and
[1:40:26] says I'm not going to send you this
[1:40:27] Levite but you can have his concubine
[1:40:29] and he sends out that concubine and the
[1:40:31] Bible records that they so brutal
[1:40:33] to file her that she dies and in the
[1:40:39] morning when the dawn comes in the
[1:40:41] daylight breaks there's this concubine
[1:40:44] laying dead on the ground you imagine
[1:40:49] the failure of one man what the
[1:40:51] consequences and the collateral damage
[1:40:55] when you get away from God and you're
[1:40:58] living on that cycle say brother Matt
[1:41:03] that's a horrible story it gets worse
[1:41:05] judges is gonna keep going down further
[1:41:08] and further and those men take the body
[1:41:12] of that concubine and they cut her up
[1:41:13] into 12 pieces go read your Bible and
[1:41:17] they send a piece to each of the tribes
[1:41:21] of Israel say how can that be judges a
[1:41:26] pattern a circle around about bowing
[1:41:29] down and down and further and further
[1:41:31] and further you see when you get away
[1:41:33] from God there's nothing impossible for
[1:41:37] you to do you go further in things you
[1:41:40] would have never thought you could ever
[1:41:42] partake of places you would go solo you
[1:41:46] could never imagine you could stoop that
[1:41:48] low and now that this happens all of
[1:41:59] Israel unites together and says how
[1:42:02] could such a horrible thing happen they
[1:42:04] unite together in the Bible records that
[1:42:07] they band up and say we're gonna make
[1:42:09] Benjamin how could Benjamin allow such a
[1:42:11] thing to happen how could they allow
[1:42:13] such an atrocity under their watch and
[1:42:16] all of Israel comes together against
[1:42:21] Benjamin and for the first time and only
[1:42:24] time in their history
[1:42:26] Israel has Civil War you know what
[1:42:30] happened with this civil war that we had
[1:42:32] in American history and lives and men
[1:42:36] died arguing and fighting arguing and
[1:42:39] fussing and fighting and they get so
[1:42:41] much away from God so much away from the
[1:42:44] plan of God so much of the word of
[1:42:46] that civil war breaks out in Israel and
[1:42:48] they begin to fight one with another and
[1:42:51] it gets so bad that the scripture
[1:42:55] records Benjamin is so defeated and so
[1:42:59] destroyed and there's so much bloodshed
[1:43:01] and Slyder the result was the tribe of
[1:43:06] Benjamin almost like Dan gets wiped off
[1:43:11] almost completely annihilated you say
[1:43:14] Israel this was Israel this is the story
[1:43:20] of the judges every man did that which
[1:43:24] was right in his own eyes and Benjamin's
[1:43:30] almost completely wiped off
[1:43:32] there's only 600 minute ride that had
[1:43:35] thousands when the war's over there 600
[1:43:39] men no women no children go read your
[1:43:45] Bible they never realized what would
[1:43:49] happen but Benjamin's almost completely
[1:43:52] wiped out and then they realized what's
[1:43:55] happened to us we were twelve tribes now
[1:43:58] we're 11 and now Benjamin almost gets
[1:44:01] wiped off you say what happened brother
[1:44:03] Matt the judges cycle happened and they
[1:44:07] went further and further and further you
[1:44:10] say that's a horrible story brother Matt
[1:44:12] that's how judges ends that's what how
[1:44:15] your life ends when you get on that
[1:44:17] circle of judges that's how your life
[1:44:19] ends up when you get in a circle and you
[1:44:22] go around and around you say how much
[1:44:24] longer can a person go from one revival
[1:44:26] to the next deliverance back to sin back
[1:44:29] to revival back to deliver its brother
[1:44:31] you won't stay on that cycle you'll keep
[1:44:33] going down further and further and
[1:44:36] further and further and further let me
[1:44:38] give you the message of God today get
[1:44:40] off of that circle
[1:44:41] get off of that circle you say brother
[1:44:47] Matt that's a horrible story but I'm not
[1:44:49] just preaching about judges I'm
[1:44:51] preaching on getting called out of
[1:44:53] judges and into another book named Ruth
[1:44:56] you see the most special part about this
[1:44:59] story of judges and Ruth is that your
[1:45:01] English Bible separates the two books
[1:45:04] and in your English Bible
[1:45:08] it ends with Dan wiped out and Benjamin
[1:45:12] almost annihilated but go pick up a
[1:45:15] Hebrew Bible you see in the Hebrew Bible
[1:45:17] they weren't two books they were all the
[1:45:20] same book it was the same story what was
[1:45:25] God saying judges it's not it's not
[1:45:28] gonna end with judges your life is not
[1:45:31] gonna end with Benjamin dining and and
[1:45:33] eying and getting wiped off but I've got
[1:45:35] a line that answers the circle and Ruth
[1:45:39] it's gonna be a little girl who's
[1:45:41] anointed and redeemed of the Lord it's
[1:45:43] not going to end in calamity my brother
[1:45:46] and my sister and let me tell the devil
[1:45:48] today you might have brought us through
[1:45:50] a circle of cycles of revival and death
[1:45:53] but God's gonna plan before the
[1:45:55] foundation of the world and it's not
[1:45:57] going to end in defeat it's not gonna
[1:45:59] end with people leaving church and
[1:46:02] backsliding into sin and addiction it's
[1:46:05] gonna end in a line a line of redemption
[1:46:09] oh you ought to rejoice tonight today
[1:46:14] and say God take me off the circle put
[1:46:18] me on the line of redemption it's not
[1:46:22] gonna end with Benjamin it's not gonna
[1:46:24] end with Dan dying the story is the same
[1:46:29] it's one book judges and you say what
[1:46:36] was different about Ruth's brother Matt
[1:46:37] what was so different you see Ruth had a
[1:46:41] purpose past present future it wasn't
[1:46:48] just going to be a circle of repeating
[1:46:49] it was going to be a past of who she was
[1:46:52] a present of who God made her
[1:46:55] and a future of who she was gonna be and
[1:46:57] if you're an elected member of the
[1:47:00] family of God my life isn't a circle a
[1:47:02] pattern of history but my life is who I
[1:47:05] used to be and now who God has made me
[1:47:08] but it goes further than that who I'm
[1:47:10] gonna be I'm gonna be an overcomer I'm
[1:47:13] gonna be redeemed of the Lord Oh can you
[1:47:15] say yeah man this morning my life isn't
[1:47:17] going to end in a circle it's gonna end
[1:47:19] in a pattern a line a linear litterer
[1:47:23] why Oh give the Lord a praise this
[1:47:28] morning hallelujah stand to your feet
[1:47:34] this morning musicians if you would come
[1:47:36] we're out of time it's not gonna end in
[1:47:40] a circle it's gonna end in a straight by
[1:47:49] your heads with me if you could brothers
[1:47:51] if you could just play something here
[1:47:53] this morning whatever the Lord put upon
[1:47:54] your heart brother Harry it's not gonna
[1:47:57] end in judges you see judges was a land
[1:48:02] where everyone did that which was right
[1:48:05] in his own eyes tells that sad story of
[1:48:08] human history even today people live
[1:48:11] with that philosophy if it feels right
[1:48:13] if it seems right do it must be right
[1:48:20] you see they had no King in those days
[1:48:24] and sin leads to slavery and slavery
[1:48:29] leaves to repentance and dependence
[1:48:32] leads to deliverance but then back to
[1:48:35] that same cycle I wonder if every head
[1:48:38] could be bowed every eye closed just go
[1:48:41] ahead and play something this is how
[1:48:44] judges ends it ends with corruption
[1:48:50] and let me give you the warning of God
[1:48:52] my brother my sister if you don't get
[1:48:56] off that cycle and get off that pattern
[1:49:00] of judges of revival and death revival
[1:49:05] and Zen back to sin back to repentance
[1:49:07] back to slavery back to repentance from
[1:49:10] one meeting to the next from one service
[1:49:12] to the next and you get in that cycle
[1:49:14] and we're all susceptible to it as
[1:49:16] children of God get in that cycle of
[1:49:18] life to where you just get in a rut
[1:49:20] maybe you're here today and maybe you
[1:49:23] feel even identified maybe you're not
[1:49:24] sinful or backslidden but you feel like
[1:49:26] lord I've sort of got into that rut of
[1:49:28] life to where I'm just going through the
[1:49:31] circles oh just be honest today raise a
[1:49:33] hand to the Lord say God would you take
[1:49:35] me off that circle would you put me back
[1:49:38] on the straight path the straight and
[1:49:40] narrow would you put me back on that
[1:49:42] life that has a purpose where church has
[1:49:45] a meaning preaching has a purpose living
[1:49:47] for God has a purpose my job has a
[1:49:49] purpose raising a family has a purpose
[1:49:51] Oh sister brother you can get so
[1:49:53] depressed in that in that state of that
[1:49:55] pattern but God is saying I'm calling
[1:49:58] you out of judges and I'm wanting to put
[1:50:00] you in Ruth you know the beauty of Ruth
[1:50:07] that land of Bethlehem is that from
[1:50:12] judges to Ruth it was only two miles
[1:50:15] away
[1:50:17] only two miles only two miles you say
[1:50:26] I'm in a pattern I'm in a circle I'm in
[1:50:28] a ride I'm in that cycle but that line
[1:50:31] of Ruth is only two miles away my
[1:50:33] brother that land of Bethlehem was just
[1:50:36] two miles away that's how close you are
[1:50:40] to the fire and the revival of God
[1:50:43] that's how close you are you say I fell
[1:50:46] on a fallen so far I'm so far away
[1:50:48] brother Matt you don't know my condition
[1:50:50] today you're only two miles away my
[1:50:52] brother and let me tell you something
[1:50:54] about that land of Bethlehem there's a
[1:50:56] different atmosphere in that land
[1:50:58] there's a different anointing in that
[1:51:00] land the atmosphere feels different the
[1:51:03] atmosphere the filling in Bethlehem is
[1:51:05] not a feeling of cycles and torment and
[1:51:08] struggle and war and and and death and
[1:51:11] and murder and all of this terror that
[1:51:13] you read and judges in Judah in
[1:51:16] Bethlehem there's none of that there's a
[1:51:18] little girl who's being called to the
[1:51:20] throne there's a redeemed lady there's a
[1:51:23] redeemed woman there's a plan of
[1:51:25] redemption just outside of that circle
[1:51:31] of judges my brother and my sister is a
[1:51:35] line of Ruth and I wonder if you'd raise
[1:51:38] your hand today with every head bowed
[1:51:40] and every eye closed owned her fathers
[1:51:42] and mothers and children and teenagers
[1:51:44] could say to the Lord Lord take me out
[1:51:47] of that atmosphere of judges and plant
[1:51:50] me in that atmosphere of Bethlehem plant
[1:51:53] me Lord in that atmosphere where there's
[1:51:55] no fear there's joy where there's no
[1:51:58] hate there's love where there's no
[1:52:00] stress there's peace oh god it's only
[1:52:04] just a mile away all we got to do is
[1:52:06] walk to that land we don't have to stay
[1:52:08] off that in that cycle we don't have to
[1:52:10] stay in that roundabout we can today
[1:52:13] Lord step off of that roundabout you're
[1:52:17] calling us to Lord we preach last night
[1:52:20] Lord on the bondage the captive daughter
[1:52:22] of Zion Lord you're not wanting us to go
[1:52:25] into captivity again and then back to
[1:52:26] freedom them back to captivity them back
[1:52:28] to freedom but you're calling somebody
[1:52:30] today child step out of that circle step
[1:52:35] out of that cycle of death
[1:52:36] it's a winding ever winding road that
[1:52:40] leads further and further and further
[1:52:41] and further
[1:52:42] but today can you hear the voice of the
[1:52:45] Lord saying come out of judges let me
[1:52:50] bring your home into a different
[1:52:51] atmosphere let me bring your home into a
[1:52:54] different feeling Oh Lord yes oh yes
[1:52:58] Lord
[1:52:58] I raise my hands here today Lord with
[1:53:01] every believer here in this building
[1:53:03] I say yes Lord call my life out of that
[1:53:06] cycle call me out of that random
[1:53:09] wandering call me out of that
[1:53:11] that one during that circuit is to go
[1:53:13] around and that dizziness of life
[1:53:15] call me into de Ruth Lord call me into a
[1:53:20] different atmosphere call me into a plan
[1:53:23] a purpose of life or life has a meaning
