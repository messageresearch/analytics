[33:11] I have to say it's
[33:13] hard for me to comprehend that one day
[33:16] angels will bow their holy heads
[33:22] if you can imagine it
[33:24] when the redeemed are gathered there and
[33:26] we are changed by the power of God
[33:28] the prophet said that the angels will
[33:31] circle the Earth
[33:33] was about his
[33:35] as we are singing and worshiping and
[33:38] blessing our God
[33:40] wow
[33:42] those of us which were lost and
[33:44] seemingly without a hope
[33:46] and yet angels will have to hold their
[33:49] peace while we sing
[33:51] that's wonderful in it
[33:54] let's turn tonight to First Corinthians
[33:55] if you would chapter 12 verse 17.
[34:00] I mean it's happened to be in the house
[34:01] of the Lord
[34:03] amen it's wonderful for us to be
[34:05] gathered together
[34:08] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 17.
[34:11] let's look tonight by the hope of the
[34:13] Lord
[34:15] on a parallel of
[34:17] Israel in the Old Testament and the
[34:20] Church of course in the New Testament
[34:22] and will
[34:24] pick up this where Paul is speaking
[34:26] about the body
[34:28] if the whole body were an eye where were
[34:32] the hearing
[34:33] if the whole were hearing
[34:36] where
[34:38] where the smelling
[34:41] but now haths
[34:43] God
[34:44] set the members every one of them
[34:48] in the body
[34:51] now listen how he does it
[34:53] and he asks you all if you're okay with
[34:55] it and then if you all agree with him
[34:57] then he
[35:00] as it has pleased
[35:04] yeah him
[35:07] so you mean it doesn't even ask us
[35:09] it's if it's if it's okay
[35:12] I guarantee you what I'd answered him
[35:14] and he'd said I want you to preach you
[35:17] okay but I said no sir I'm not I have a
[35:20] problem with that
[35:21] that's what I told him whenever he
[35:23] called me
[35:24] I said no I I don't want to preach I
[35:27] can't preach no no I made all kinds of
[35:29] excuses Moses did Brother Ram did every
[35:32] God called Manuel
[35:34] that's right
[35:35] but God didn't even ask me
[35:38] he didn't ask me if it's okay
[35:41] then he calls me into the ministry and
[35:43] then he don't ask me which one I want
[35:45] saying that and what kind of God is this
[35:47] An Almighty one
[35:49] so he tells you what to do
[35:52] and the strange thing about it is he
[35:54] makes you like it
[35:56] and you think well really in all reality
[35:58] I wouldn't want to do anything else but
[36:00] please him and you think that I just say
[36:02] that that'd come out of my mouth that I
[36:04] honestly say I want to do what I don't
[36:06] want to do but I want to do what he
[36:08] wants me to do even though I don't want
[36:09] to do that even though I don't want to
[36:11] do it at all you say but Rudy would you
[36:13] want to be anything else no
[36:15] I would and you wouldn't eat if you're
[36:17] called of God
[36:18] so it sets it in the body as it has
[36:22] pleased him
[36:23] I mean let to be remembered tonight as
[36:25] we pray
[36:28] Erica went to her
[36:30] cancer doctor the other day and he told
[36:34] her about
[36:36] an immunotherapy drug that they wanted
[36:40] her to try
[36:42] immunotherapy Works different than
[36:46] the other things that she's done
[36:49] the immunotherapy there's like 105 or so
[36:53] right now they're constantly making them
[36:56] but they work with your immune system
[36:59] and they beef up the T cells and it just
[37:03] depends on what type of cancer of course
[37:04] you have and things but Erica's
[37:08] Insurance last week turned her down
[37:13] I don't know why
[37:16] because this treatment wasn't but forty
[37:18] thousand a month
[37:24] but somehow
[37:27] somebody must have got a prayer through
[37:29] him
[37:31] because this week
[37:33] she got approved
[37:35] [Applause]
[37:45] so now instead of the Parker family
[37:47] paying 40
[37:49] 000.
[37:50] they will pay
[37:52] for
[37:53] dollars
[37:56] a month
[37:57] so everybody what's your view of it well
[37:59] my view of it is this almighty God is
[38:01] her healer
[38:03] if he wants to use a little dab of chemo
[38:05] and a little dab of immunotherapy and a
[38:07] whole lot of prayer and a whole lot of
[38:09] this and that and other I really don't
[38:10] care how he does it
[38:13] I just want her heels yeah
[38:16] yeah so I guess it was supposed to come
[38:18] in today and she'll she'll begin that so
[38:20] you'll remember her in prayer I'm just
[38:23] waiting every day myself for the angel
[38:25] of the Lord to pass through our house
[38:28] and make her well we're not just
[38:30] believing God that these cancer cells
[38:32] are going to die in the liver
[38:34] and in the brain and wherever else that
[38:36] they might be
[38:37] I'm asking God for this
[38:40] that he'll restore every side effect the
[38:44] chemo is caused
[38:46] every side effect that's still there
[38:49] because of the other things hey look you
[38:52] know the prophet said ask God for big
[38:54] things and many of them
[38:58] so why should we ask just for healing
[39:00] and kind of resume from that why not ask
[39:02] for a complete restoration amen where
[39:05] the doctors say it's all in her liver
[39:06] but I'll tell you one thing my daddy is
[39:08] the first one to ever make a liver he
[39:10] can make another one
[39:12] so whatever you need tonight
[39:15] ask God for great things and many of
[39:18] them
[39:19] or you like the little fish in the ocean
[39:22] that would say I better drink of this
[39:24] water sparingly
[39:26] what if the Pacific runs out what if the
[39:29] Atlantic runs out or a little mouse in
[39:32] the Garners of Egypt and there's
[39:34] millions of grains in that Garner and he
[39:38] says I better allot myself to maybe one
[39:40] grain per day
[39:42] because what if this famine goes on for
[39:44] maybe 12 or 14 years
[39:47] God gave you a checkbook and the Dow
[39:49] preached it to us several years ago and
[39:51] the deposits already made in your name
[39:54] in your account he knew everything he'd
[39:57] ever need from the day you got saved to
[39:59] the day you die of the day of your
[40:00] raptured and he's covered everything
[40:03] you'll ever need from that point
[40:05] are you afraid to cash the check
[40:08] let's believe him tonight shall we I
[40:11] mean I'd like to be remembered as we
[40:12] pray God bless you
[40:14] Heavenly Father we counted such an honor
[40:16] that we could be gathered together here
[40:18] tonight Lord in your great presence
[40:20] we thank you Father that
[40:23] we're not only here in the visible
[40:24] audience of many many hundreds of your
[40:27] children
[40:30] but Lord God there's a greater number
[40:32] than that
[40:34] there's a great host of your angels
[40:39] we believe that they are here with us
[40:41] father
[40:42] they encamped about us
[40:45] Lord God we just asked tonight that you
[40:48] would
[40:49] take this service and speak to us from
[40:51] your word
[40:53] we said a lot Lord but we we're a needy
[40:57] people we know that
[40:58] but our God has all of our needs covered
[41:01] amen
[41:02] Lord Jesus we bring all the petitions
[41:05] before you tonight
[41:06] we agree together for the sick
[41:09] for the wounded The Afflicted Lord those
[41:12] that are sad oppressed whatever their
[41:15] need is tonight
[41:16] would you speak to him Lord your word
[41:19] may your presence come and arrest us as
[41:22] it were
[41:25] Hallelujah
[41:27] may your love conquer us
[41:31] and then may the banner be stretched
[41:34] over us
[41:35] with your name written all over it
[41:37] father
[41:39] speak to us tonight father in the name
[41:42] of Jesus Christ we pray
[41:44] for his sake and for his glory
[41:47] the Saints said amen God bless you you
[41:51] may be seated
[41:54] turn with me to numbers
[41:57] chapter 1 verse 52.
[42:00] and the children of Israel shall pitch
[42:02] their tents
[42:04] every man by his own camp
[42:07] and every man by his own standard
[42:12] throughout
[42:14] their host
[42:16] so the children of Israel shall pitch
[42:19] their tents every man by his own Camp
[42:22] notice the divisions
[42:24] so there's camps
[42:27] and there are different standards and
[42:30] every man by his own standard throughout
[42:33] their host
[42:35] notice verse 53.
[42:37] but the Levites
[42:39] shall pitch round about the Tabernacle
[42:43] of testimony
[42:45] now listen why
[42:47] that there be no wraths
[42:50] upon the congregation
[42:53] of the children of Israel
[42:56] and the Levites shall keep the charge of
[43:00] the Tabernacle
[43:02] of the testimony
[43:04] so they're going to be to the east the
[43:07] West the North and the South
[43:11] but the Levites
[43:13] are in a different position
[43:16] the Levites are going to be all around
[43:18] the Tabernacle
[43:21] for what reason
[43:23] so none of the children of Israel
[43:26] will die
[43:28] so you mean the Levites are standing
[43:33] there
[43:34] as part of God's mercy
[43:37] so that the Shekinah Glory
[43:40] will not kill any of the tribes
[43:45] now why would that be so essential and
[43:48] so necessary you see so that no man
[43:52] not being a levite would approach this
[43:57] sacred holy place
[44:00] so someone from the tribe of Reuben
[44:03] which was the firstborn from the tribe
[44:06] of GAD nephtali issachar on down on down
[44:10] on down they could not come
[44:12] directly themselves and if anyone tried
[44:16] to approach that spot the Levites would
[44:20] have stopped them
[44:22] so the Levites were God's bumper of
[44:26] Grace
[44:27] that would separate the people of God
[44:30] from his presence of them entering in
[44:35] to Divine judgment
[44:37] now you know God has always had a
[44:41] Ministry he himself was the first one
[44:44] that ministered to his children in the
[44:46] Garden of Eden
[44:48] and now we can see the anatype of the
[44:52] New Testament Church
[44:54] that even though every believer in the
[44:56] New Testament will have direct access to
[44:59] the throne of God they don't have to
[45:01] have a priest of course to pray for them
[45:03] but they will have a Ministry which will
[45:07] stand there in the presence of God and
[45:11] bring and constant reminder to the rest
[45:14] of the body the flock
[45:17] the thoughts of God and the Divine
[45:20] protocol of God on how to approach him
[45:25] so you know it makes me feel really sad
[45:29] and heavy for those who feel like they
[45:32] really don't need a minister they really
[45:34] don't need a preacher
[45:36] well first of all they don't believe the
[45:37] setting of the Old Testament or the
[45:40] setting of the new
[45:41] now God himself is the one that sets a
[45:46] certain order now I realize a lot of
[45:49] people they identify order as
[45:53] organization
[45:54] but God doesn't
[45:56] you see God has always had order and he
[46:01] always will
[46:02] but what man does man tries to take an
[46:06] organizational system and replace the
[46:10] divine order of God and if we're not
[46:13] careful we are independence of course
[46:15] and we don't want any organization we
[46:18] don't want no system over us at all but
[46:21] being Independence if we're not careful
[46:24] it will tend to make us to where we defy
[46:29] any order whatsoever
[46:32] so we then think that we are outside of
[46:36] the Divine protocol of God or the order
[46:40] of god notice in Numbers chapter 2 verse
[46:44] 17 then the Tabernacle of the
[46:46] congregation Shall Set forward with the
[46:49] camp of the Levites in the midst of the
[46:52] camp as they encamp
[46:56] so shall they set forward now notice how
[46:59] they're to set
[47:01] the rest of the tribes are setting
[47:04] somewhat different but the Levites every
[47:08] one of them no matter which side they
[47:10] are on they all have one common goal and
[47:14] that is they are setting forward toward
[47:17] the midst of the camp now notice how
[47:20] Moses writes this so they shall set
[47:23] forward so none of them were allowed to
[47:27] Camp backwards none of them were allowed
[47:31] to Camp sideways
[47:33] none of them could take their tent and
[47:37] turn it away
[47:39] from the Tabernacle of testimony they
[47:42] were forbidden the only way the Levites
[47:46] could camp was forward
[47:49] so God never leads any god-called man to
[47:53] ever Lead You backwards
[47:57] every God called man will always lead
[48:00] the people of God in a forward Direction
[48:04] so for those who have hung around the
[48:07] message for years and years and desire
[48:10] to take the people back in whatever
[48:13] direction that might be now some of
[48:15] course want to go back to 1906 Pentecost
[48:18] well I've been there and done that you
[48:21] ain't taking me back there I want to go
[48:23] back to Pentecost but the Acts 2 1 not
[48:27] the 1906 one come on somebody well then
[48:30] there's others that don't want to go
[48:32] back to Pentecost but they revert back
[48:34] to Baptist or they revert back to Church
[48:37] of Christ or whatever they were and then
[48:39] they'd take the message Theology and
[48:41] then their church has become As Dead As
[48:43] a hammer they don't even believe in the
[48:45] move of the spirit of God anymore but no
[48:48] God call man is ever going to take you
[48:51] backwards in the sense to an
[48:53] organizational system because his tent
[48:57] always pitches forward
[49:00] now what was the representation of the
[49:04] Tabernacle sitting in the middle now
[49:06] notice sin as every man is in his place
[49:10] by their standards now remember this is
[49:13] a god of order so they couldn't just say
[49:16] oh you know what I'd like to be over
[49:19] there or let's just say it what people
[49:20] say today I I I feel led I feel led to
[49:25] go over there and actually I I'm of the
[49:27] tribe of Reuben will say and and
[49:29] remember the friend we're really good
[49:31] buddies and brother Fred no doubt he
[49:33] would have been to the tribe of Judah
[49:34] because he's a praise God he loves to
[49:36] praise loves to Worship the Lord and and
[49:39] brother Fred would have no doubt been in
[49:41] the tribe of Judah and I'd say you know
[49:42] what I I really like hanging around
[49:45] brother Fred and I like some of these
[49:47] other praise folks so I I think that I
[49:49] feel led myself to go over there and
[49:53] kind of camp out with Judah because
[49:55] after all ain't we all go into the same
[49:57] place and then we all worshiping the
[49:59] same God but I was forbidden by God
[50:02] himself to do that because I was
[50:06] committed to camp in a certain Camp
[50:10] under a certain standard
[50:13] well praise the Lord so I could not just
[50:16] say well I feel led to go over there
[50:19] this week and then I feel led to be over
[50:21] there next week and I feel led to be
[50:24] over there the next week and as a matter
[50:26] of fact if you run that through the New
[50:28] Testament you'll never even find them
[50:30] words
[50:31] well I feel led to do this and I feel
[50:34] led to do that and I feel led to do that
[50:37] but you see one reason people like that
[50:39] so much is because the way they look at
[50:42] it that trumps the word
[50:45] no matter what the word says if they
[50:47] feel led to do this or that or the other
[50:49] then you know what that's higher than
[50:51] the word that shows you a non-holy
[50:54] ghost-filled person
[50:56] anybody that's got the Holy Ghost will
[50:58] never put any feeling above God's word
[51:02] they will judge whatever they feel led
[51:06] to do by God's word and if God's word
[51:09] says something different than what they
[51:11] feel led to do they'll say that was the
[51:14] devil because God's word is always right
[51:17] is anybody going to say Amen with me
[51:20] tonight
[51:21] now you see they did not have a choice
[51:24] of where they could be now no doubt some
[51:28] of them that were reubenites and they
[51:31] might have been nurtured more like
[51:33] gadites or maybe some of the gadites
[51:37] would have been natured humanly I'm
[51:39] talking about like the issacharites and
[51:43] that said well you know what I actually
[51:45] like them better I like that camp over
[51:48] there better God never gave them a
[51:51] choice God said if you are of God you go
[51:55] there
[51:56] God then say is that okay with everybody
[51:58] but God said that's where you go and you
[52:02] can't in your family now they could not
[52:05] do as they wish to do they could not do
[52:08] what they wanted to do but they had to
[52:11] go where God told them to go anybody
[52:14] preaching with me tonight so it was not
[52:17] a camp in a random manner that they
[52:21] would share and then they was over there
[52:23] and you say well where's brother so and
[52:25] so oh well he felt led to uh to move
[52:28] well he felt led to go over here to this
[52:31] other camp and uh well now wait a minute
[52:34] wait a minute he was part of this Camp
[52:35] right here and this was his post of Duty
[52:39] and and his seats are not being filled
[52:41] there because him and his wife and son
[52:44] and daughter was there oh yeah but but
[52:46] he decided he wanted to go over here or
[52:48] go over there that's not the way it
[52:50] worked
[52:51] uh let me just give you an update that's
[52:54] not the way it works in the Holy Ghost
[52:56] Field Church in the New Testament either
[53:00] now watch this is God's own choice
[53:04] remember this place is God's place of
[53:07] worship so God is a god of order and a
[53:12] god of efficiency and a god of divine
[53:16] protocol that hates confusion
[53:20] God is not the author of confusion
[53:24] whether it's in a church or in a family
[53:27] or whatever it is or a move of God God
[53:29] is not the author of confusion the devil
[53:32] does that so God wanted them to be
[53:35] arranged in a camp manifest so they
[53:41] would have known exactly where each
[53:44] person was so in the tribe of God was
[53:46] set up and God himself was the one that
[53:49] even told them because remember there's
[53:52] going to be four directions and God
[53:54] himself was the one that told them which
[53:57] ones to go East which wants to go west
[54:00] north and south they did not randomly
[54:03] draw it it was not a lottery they did
[54:06] not vote he was not even asking them
[54:09] which side do you want God told them
[54:12] himself and Moses being the mouse piece
[54:16] of God was the one that God used and
[54:19] gave this manifest fast now to the
[54:22] people so the various tribes of Israel
[54:24] had to be placed in order and the whole
[54:28] had to be put under a strict regulation
[54:32] this was needful for encampment for the
[54:37] March and for worship
[54:40] now remember people get in their mind
[54:42] that order will that they think that's
[54:45] bondage you know oh my anything we've
[54:48] got to do I hear some of the message
[54:50] preachers make their remarks every now
[54:53] and then and I don't mind to tell you it
[54:55] rubs this preacher the wrong way
[54:58] that they will make their remarks about
[55:01] church order and I've heard some of the
[55:04] message preachers kind of you know
[55:06] saying that in a slanderous way in a way
[55:11] of a reproachful way but I would like to
[55:14] remind those preachers the same Prophet
[55:18] that you quote about Acts 2 and the same
[55:22] Prophet that you quote about Pentecost
[55:25] and the same Prophet that you quote
[55:27] about Miracle signs and wonders it's the
[55:31] same Prophet that use the words Church
[55:35] order
[55:36] unless of course we're going to start
[55:38] running a cafeteria and we're going to
[55:41] make the message like a cafeteria and we
[55:45] go through and pick out which quotes we
[55:47] want and which ones we don't want
[55:51] Church order if it's drawn exactly the
[55:54] way God's Prophet said it was set up
[55:56] because whether or not you all believe
[55:58] it he was found exactly the direction
[56:00] from Saint Paul
[56:02] and if it's run exactly that way Church
[56:05] order is not sent to take out gifts it's
[56:09] not to sin to take out the manifestation
[56:12] of the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you what
[56:14] it's sent for it's to keep people who
[56:17] are in the flesh operating so-called
[56:20] gifts that are not even prophesying in
[56:23] the first place and they give wrong
[56:25] tongues and they give wrong
[56:27] interpretation well come on somebody
[56:29] it's sent to weed them out so we can
[56:34] have real genuine ones instead of ones
[56:37] that ain't even real now you believe
[56:39] whatever you want to believe I do not
[56:42] believe my God hints and misses I do not
[56:47] believe that if a person is speaking in
[56:50] tongues and interpreting or prophecy
[56:52] whichever way that it is I do not
[56:55] believe it will hit three out of five I
[56:58] do not believe it will hit four out of
[57:00] five if it's God it will hit five out of
[57:04] five
[57:05] I do not believe a man with real genuine
[57:08] discernment is going to hit two out of
[57:11] five three out of seven four out of
[57:13] eight I believe a real gift of God from
[57:16] the presence of God God does not lie and
[57:22] remember when brother random set his own
[57:23] church in order it was for that reason
[57:26] and some of the people left of course
[57:28] and went to Junior Jackson's church
[57:30] because he didn't believe in church
[57:32] order and so brother Branham you know
[57:35] deals with the question answers on the
[57:36] seals question answer 64 again and he
[57:39] tells them that a lot of the people were
[57:41] speaking in tongues and saying things
[57:44] that never did happen it was not even
[57:46] Prophecy in the first place yeah the
[57:49] Lord say I'm coming soon that ain't
[57:51] prophecy well come on don't get quiet on
[57:54] me he said God does not repeat
[57:57] repetitious things and God does not
[58:00] repeat those but you know scripture yeah
[58:02] the Lord say I'm coming soon that is not
[58:05] prophecy and yet some of our message
[58:07] people are going right back in the same
[58:10] way Allah friends I'm going to preach
[58:12] West or without you it's up to you
[58:14] I'm trying my best to hold a standard up
[58:18] before you all do you want a standard
[58:20] with my picture on it
[58:22] is this what we're wanting at our church
[58:24] I'll tell you some of the standards that
[58:27] are being raised in the message it's got
[58:29] the pictures of the message people's
[58:32] favorite preacher
[58:34] and if you look around you'll see all
[58:36] kinds of standards that are being raised
[58:38] in the message now a standard is an
[58:40] Ensign or a flag
[58:42] and it's something that people rally
[58:45] around it was the custom of the Romans
[58:48] that they would have a standard which
[58:51] was the Roman Standard and then they
[58:54] would also have a standard of their
[58:57] leading general
[58:58] Vespasian or whoever born it was so they
[59:01] would have a mixture of several
[59:03] standards when they would go out to
[59:05] battle so they would have the Roman
[59:07] Standard and then if this particular
[59:09] platoon was from a centurion was there
[59:12] he might have a standard and there would
[59:14] be a general that would have his
[59:16] standards I'll tell you one thing if
[59:17] you're very spiritual tonight and you'll
[59:19] think back to every man-made move that
[59:22] has been in this message and you look at
[59:26] the standard that was raised when they
[59:28] raised it up you know what you'll find
[59:30] on that standard it will not be the
[59:33] Tabernacle of testimony it will not be
[59:36] the Tabernacle of the congregation but
[59:38] it will be the image of some preacher
[59:42] you look at every one of these moves
[59:44] that have been in our ranks and look and
[59:47] see if a preacher is not the main one
[59:49] that started boy some of y'all require a
[59:51] bunch of Baptists tonight
[59:53] and you look at every one of them and
[59:55] look how they started and look how they
[59:58] end and if it is a man-made move it will
[1:00:02] come to naught
[1:00:04] Amen brother Dottie well I can preach an
[1:00:06] amen to if I need to it's just taking me
[1:00:09] doubly long I better preach two hours
[1:00:11] and a half in order to get an Irish
[1:00:13] sermon or you all can say man and all to
[1:00:15] work an hour and ten
[1:00:18] but you see myself I'm not interested in
[1:00:21] having a standard hanging over our
[1:00:24] church with my picture on it or some
[1:00:27] other man's picture on it I'll tell you
[1:00:29] who I want to be on our standard the
[1:00:31] Lord Jesus himself
[1:00:34] well come on Amen
[1:00:38] now you see God is this God of order so
[1:00:42] the children of Israel would be gathered
[1:00:44] under this order so that would be now
[1:00:46] listen so you understand it each tribe
[1:00:49] would have its own standard but when it
[1:00:52] come to them setting around the
[1:00:54] Tabernacle and when it come to them
[1:00:56] marching and when it come to them
[1:00:58] worshiping they were divided into four
[1:01:02] major groups so now there's 12
[1:01:05] birthstones and there's 12 standards
[1:01:07] each child has a birthstone each tribe
[1:01:10] has a standard but when they set up
[1:01:12] around the Tabernacle which is their
[1:01:15] position in Christ as we look at it in
[1:01:18] the New Testament there was four major
[1:01:20] subgroups and that was they would sit
[1:01:24] down there was four major standards and
[1:01:27] there would be three tribes or four
[1:01:29] gathered under each one of those yep
[1:01:32] they would have their own tribal
[1:01:35] standard and then they would have many
[1:01:37] of them a family stay standard so they
[1:01:40] would have all of these different
[1:01:41] standards what was it for in case you
[1:01:44] got turned around you could be able to
[1:01:46] look around and see where you belonged
[1:01:49] so you look and say okay my goodness now
[1:01:52] you imagine when they set this up it is
[1:01:54] estimated that there was
[1:01:57] 2.2 million people that were here when
[1:02:01] this is written in the book of numbers
[1:02:02] so
[1:02:04] 2.2 million people this Camp was Miles
[1:02:08] spread out this way and this way and
[1:02:12] this way and this way we're talking
[1:02:14] about an encampment so large it would
[1:02:17] have been a good sized city so if you
[1:02:19] would have got turned around you know
[1:02:21] imagine these tense a lot of them look
[1:02:22] similar so you get out you're going over
[1:02:24] here to visit somebody from the Reuben
[1:02:26] you're going over there to naftala to
[1:02:28] visit somebody over there and you're
[1:02:30] coming back around and you're saying oh
[1:02:32] my goodness what in the world where am I
[1:02:34] where am I well you know if you would be
[1:02:37] able to be trained and taught thought
[1:02:39] you'd be able to look up and you'd see
[1:02:41] hanging up on a pole that would be your
[1:02:44] banner your tribal standard well now
[1:02:47] once you get there there's three if not
[1:02:50] four tribes in that direction where you
[1:02:52] are you still don't know exactly where
[1:02:55] you're going so what you do once you get
[1:02:58] into the subgroup you identify yourself
[1:03:00] okay I'm in the right camp at least I'm
[1:03:03] in the right Camp I'm in the camp of
[1:03:06] Judah but I live in a certain place in
[1:03:10] the camp of Judah so I just can't come
[1:03:12] in the camp of Judah anywhere but I've
[1:03:15] got a certain camp and I've got another
[1:03:18] trouble because action I'm not of the
[1:03:20] tribe of Judah but that's the subtribe
[1:03:23] that I belong to so then you go to
[1:03:25] looking around and you're looking and
[1:03:27] you're looking and you're looking for
[1:03:29] your own tribe oh okay there it is over
[1:03:31] there it is I found it now I found it so
[1:03:34] now you get over there now you're in
[1:03:35] more the direction of where you should
[1:03:38] be but you still belong to a certain
[1:03:40] family inside that certain tribe inside
[1:03:43] that certain Camp inside this certain
[1:03:46] encampment can't you see why Satan hates
[1:03:49] order and this is why people don't know
[1:03:51] who they are they don't know where
[1:03:53] they're supposed to go to church they
[1:03:55] don't know who the pastor is come on
[1:03:57] somebody they don't know if they belong
[1:03:59] in the seven Thunders they don't know if
[1:04:00] God's got seven Hunters they are not
[1:04:02] even sure they're not sure if they're
[1:04:03] supposed to be in the two soul group
[1:04:05] they're not shifting she just plate
[1:04:07] tapes only and stay home they don't know
[1:04:09] where to go let me tell you some friend
[1:04:10] there's a lot of mixed up people inside
[1:04:13] the ranks of this message
[1:04:15] and it's so sad so you find some then
[1:04:18] that are raising new flags and new
[1:04:21] standards and they say well we're a
[1:04:23] message search over here but we're
[1:04:25] really not going to preach the message
[1:04:26] what we're going to do is we're going to
[1:04:28] kind of hold it to ourself so that we
[1:04:31] can kind of build up our church you know
[1:04:33] and we're going to build up our church
[1:04:35] but we're not going to preach on
[1:04:36] earrings and makeup and dress and we're
[1:04:39] certainly not going to mention brother
[1:04:40] Ram's name because if we do that would
[1:04:43] run people off so we're just flying up a
[1:04:46] new standard and it's kind of got this
[1:04:49] man's picture on it and that man's
[1:04:51] picture you know this and that and the
[1:04:52] other and understand they're trying to
[1:04:53] figure what in the world is all that I
[1:04:55] don't understand it at all and you're
[1:04:57] trying to identify what it is well but
[1:05:00] each one of us in reality every person
[1:05:02] here is identified by a standard every
[1:05:05] one of you men women boys girls you all
[1:05:08] are identified by a certain standard I
[1:05:11] hope it's the right one
[1:05:12] now the Lord Jesus has got a standard by
[1:05:16] which he will fly over his bride it will
[1:05:19] be those under that Banner that go in
[1:05:24] the Rapture you see he's not looking for
[1:05:27] the seventh under Banner because that is
[1:05:30] a man-made system he's not looking for
[1:05:32] the two Soul Banner he's not looking for
[1:05:34] the purusia banner because again that's
[1:05:37] a man-made system but what he's looking
[1:05:39] for is the banner that he himself
[1:05:42] stretched over his elect and they will
[1:05:46] be gathered from the four corners of the
[1:05:48] Earth in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:05:51] eye
[1:05:52] praise the Lord now from all of these
[1:05:55] camps of course there will be elect that
[1:05:57] will be called out of all that so they
[1:05:59] were under this strict regulation for
[1:06:02] encampment for March and movement can
[1:06:05] you imagine now 2.2 million people and
[1:06:08] they all get ready to move okay they're
[1:06:10] going somewhere all right well they're
[1:06:12] moving from here and they're fixing to
[1:06:14] head down to Greenville will say 2.2
[1:06:17] million people well can you imagine them
[1:06:19] all too hey I'll see you I'll see you
[1:06:21] down there I'm going down this way hey I
[1:06:23] know there's a shortcut across the
[1:06:25] mountain down there and I'm going down
[1:06:26] there Moses said no
[1:06:29] no
[1:06:31] the Levites are going to carry the word
[1:06:33] on their shoulders
[1:06:35] and everybody will get right in line and
[1:06:38] they even had to march in a certain
[1:06:40] order
[1:06:42] they had to move in a certain order they
[1:06:45] had to go to church in a certain order
[1:06:47] well praise the Lord they had to leave
[1:06:51] in a certain order they had to move in a
[1:06:54] certain order they had to change
[1:06:55] encampment in a certain order well
[1:06:58] praise the Lord you see God himself is
[1:07:02] the one who Institute this now notice
[1:07:04] again every man in his place by their
[1:07:08] standards so every individual has
[1:07:11] several identification parts that will
[1:07:14] identify where it goes so we'll be under
[1:07:16] a sub count then he will find his own
[1:07:18] tribal standard and then he will find
[1:07:21] his own family so the Tabernacle was
[1:07:24] what it was in the center of all this
[1:07:27] and came up now notice this you can read
[1:07:30] this with me on the east side of the
[1:07:32] camp where the tribes of Judah issachar
[1:07:36] and sibulan now notice again they did
[1:07:40] not toss Lots they did not vote well I I
[1:07:44] like Judah I'd like to be on Jewish side
[1:07:46] you never got to choose that actually
[1:07:48] God himself was the one that gave these
[1:07:51] names to Moses can't you see why the
[1:07:54] prophet of God told us if we would go to
[1:07:56] God and ask God Lord why am I here why
[1:07:59] am I here that we would save ourselves
[1:08:01] and God so much trouble if we find Where
[1:08:05] We Belong
[1:08:06] notice so the east side is the tribes of
[1:08:10] Judah and issachar and Zebula on the
[1:08:14] south side of the camp the tribes of
[1:08:17] Reuben Simeon and Gan on the west side
[1:08:22] of the camp the tribes of Ephraim
[1:08:25] manessa and Benjamin now these are the
[1:08:29] tribes which are all the descendants of
[1:08:32] Jacob's favorite wife Rachel
[1:08:35] so God let all of them be in the same
[1:08:38] camp or in the amazing how he does
[1:08:40] things on the north side of the camp are
[1:08:43] the tribes of Dan Asher enough tally
[1:08:47] let's show them some images Brothers
[1:08:49] now it was God himself who orchestrated
[1:08:53] this and this is all by his divine order
[1:08:57] and I want you to notice an artist's
[1:08:59] rendition anybody see a symbol in that
[1:09:01] layout that you recognize
[1:09:04] what do you see across
[1:09:07] a cross
[1:09:09] now look at them how that it's laid out
[1:09:12] so here are 2.2 million people and
[1:09:15] notice what is in the middle the
[1:09:18] Tabernacle so every person's life is
[1:09:22] supposed to be aimed toward the
[1:09:25] Tabernacle what's in there the word and
[1:09:27] Grace of course and the Manna the second
[1:09:30] eye the presence of God the pillar of
[1:09:32] fire at night and here they are sitting
[1:09:34] all around camped around the presence of
[1:09:37] God that every life should be focused on
[1:09:42] the word and the word Christ Jesus
[1:09:44] should be the center of the focal part
[1:09:47] of the camp Oh I'll tell you one day if
[1:09:51] we could ever get him the focal part of
[1:09:52] our life you talking about some camp
[1:09:55] meetings we'd have some
[1:09:58] oh my so notice now God is the one who
[1:10:03] laid this out and even even in the size
[1:10:05] and all that we've dealt with of course
[1:10:06] years ago but the the length was a
[1:10:09] certain size the breath was a certain
[1:10:10] size so many cubits high so much this so
[1:10:13] much that silver on this part gold on
[1:10:16] that part blue on this purple on that so
[1:10:18] it was not a haphazard something you
[1:10:21] know I wonder sometimes if we don't take
[1:10:23] it too lightly when we come to the house
[1:10:25] of God people won't even pray before
[1:10:27] they come to church they won't read the
[1:10:29] Bible they'd rather stand outside and
[1:10:31] talk 30 minutes before church and then
[1:10:33] walk right in out of that old carnal
[1:10:35] Fellowship thing instead of coming in
[1:10:37] and sitting down and closing their you
[1:10:39] know the world off to him and reading
[1:10:41] their Bibles sitting there reading a
[1:10:42] message book and praying and said oh God
[1:10:44] come this way to not Lord I've got a
[1:10:47] need my brothers and sisters have needs
[1:10:49] I wonder I wonder if it would not make a
[1:10:52] change and how the presence of God would
[1:10:55] feel more welcome if we ourselves would
[1:10:58] put forth effort
[1:11:00] but we're afraid somehow I think we're
[1:11:03] so afraid of what God might do but I
[1:11:06] want you to notice now God is the one
[1:11:08] who placed him notice these tents how
[1:11:10] they're set out notice the post they're
[1:11:13] spaced exactly on the outer wall the
[1:11:16] stakes are exactly on the outer wall now
[1:11:19] let me show you some scriptures okay
[1:11:21] Brothers hold those for a minute just
[1:11:22] fade out the screen Genesis chapter 22
[1:11:25] verse 9. let's see how God relates to
[1:11:28] order and they came to the place which
[1:11:30] God had told him of this is Abraham now
[1:11:33] and Abraham built an altar there and he
[1:11:36] laid the wood
[1:11:41] I wonder why I didn't just throw it over
[1:11:43] in a big pile and just say you know pull
[1:11:45] that old lighter over there and tell him
[1:11:47] why am I gonna I don't want to get no
[1:11:49] form I don't want to get no fashion I'll
[1:11:51] tell you one thing the glory to God I'm
[1:11:53] a free man Hallelujah I'm free out here
[1:11:58] a lot of folks don't even understand
[1:11:59] Freedom do they
[1:12:01] I was in such bondage in Pentecost
[1:12:04] and shouted nearly every night
[1:12:07] but if I didn't shout I was backslid
[1:12:11] uh-huh got the spot if you didn't speak
[1:12:13] in tongues if he didn't run the owls if
[1:12:16] you didn't do this and that and the
[1:12:18] other and that's just as much a form as
[1:12:21] people who said in church and never move
[1:12:23] their arms
[1:12:24] and you get under such legalism that if
[1:12:27] you don't run and don't jump then you
[1:12:29] ain't had church and you sat around and
[1:12:31] judged the people around you and let me
[1:12:33] just go and tell you the truth there's
[1:12:34] some people in the church that probably
[1:12:36] never will shout
[1:12:39] as a matter of fact I doubt very
[1:12:42] sincerely
[1:12:43] Jesus ever did
[1:12:46] you want to see Saint Jesus Christ
[1:12:48] preach like me
[1:12:50] do you say Jesus Christ preached out
[1:12:52] brother Daryl
[1:12:54] do you think Jesus was a you know some
[1:12:56] type of evangelist that just run back
[1:12:58] and forth across the platform but the
[1:13:00] Bible says he's sat and talked but there
[1:13:04] was never anybody any more anointed than
[1:13:06] he was
[1:13:07] but if we're not careful we sing
[1:13:10] emotions is the anointing now the
[1:13:13] anointing will move on our emotion but
[1:13:15] it does not mean that everybody that is
[1:13:17] emotional is Anointed if that's so at
[1:13:21] the Cincinnati Reds ball game they ought
[1:13:23] to have a great powerful anointing
[1:13:26] well come on you can see that down into
[1:13:28] a little deal down here in Elizabethton
[1:13:30] sometimes the way they scream and holler
[1:13:32] and carry on they ain't got a bit more
[1:13:34] anointing than the Man in the Moon now
[1:13:36] watch Abraham laid the wood in order and
[1:13:38] bound his son Isaac and he laid him on
[1:13:41] the wood Exodus 26 17. two tenons now
[1:13:45] this was a tabernacle that I just showed
[1:13:47] you there two tenons shall there be in
[1:13:50] one board now the tenants is what joined
[1:13:52] it together set in order one against
[1:13:56] another Thou shalt out make for all the
[1:14:00] boards
[1:14:01] of the Tabernacle so once you saw in one
[1:14:05] board you saw in every other board so it
[1:14:08] was not random that God said well put
[1:14:10] two yours through their father y'all
[1:14:12] just do whatever you want to do I you
[1:14:14] know I really don't even care y'all just
[1:14:15] do whatever you want to do
[1:14:18] you understand that's where laodicea is
[1:14:21] so if they want to come to church with
[1:14:23] alcohol on the breath they do I mean go
[1:14:25] said the way they look at it God you
[1:14:27] know God loves us the way we are and
[1:14:29] just be what you are so you just come to
[1:14:31] church dress anyway live anyway do
[1:14:33] whatever you want to do and God accept
[1:14:35] that that is a lie straight from the
[1:14:37] pits of hell oh yeah you come to God
[1:14:40] being a drunk he'll save you but there
[1:14:42] are no drinking Christians
[1:14:46] oh Hallelujah but we've got Christian
[1:14:49] drug addicts and we've got Christian
[1:14:51] alcoholics and now of course we got
[1:14:54] Christian transgenders
[1:14:58] you got to be kidding me we've got
[1:15:00] Christian homosexuals we've got
[1:15:03] Christian well come on don't sit there
[1:15:05] and look at me funny we've got pastors
[1:15:07] that are transgenders we've got
[1:15:10] Christian pastors that are homosexual I
[1:15:13] don't care what they say God's word
[1:15:15] condemns such a thing it is contrary to
[1:15:19] his Bible
[1:15:22] but you see when we do away with God's
[1:15:24] order then we think somehow we will
[1:15:27] force on God what we want God to have
[1:15:30] there ain't nobody telling me to clot my
[1:15:33] hands there ain't nobody telling me to
[1:15:35] say Amen bless God nobody's telling me
[1:15:38] that well you're allowed to see a man
[1:15:40] you see you won't follow God's protocol
[1:15:43] oh my goodness brother Donnie I'm not
[1:15:46] going to do such thing well I'll say it
[1:15:48] as it's been said before you know I
[1:15:50] don't care if God shouts Me dances me
[1:15:53] jumps me around jerks my head jerks my
[1:15:55] foot my leg I don't care what he does I
[1:15:58] don't care if I speak in tongues singing
[1:16:00] tongues or crow in tongues as long as
[1:16:02] I'm saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:04] that's what matters to me I'm more
[1:16:07] concerned about God's order that I am a
[1:16:09] lot of folks ordered
[1:16:14] notice in Exodus 39 37 the pure
[1:16:17] Candlestick with the lamps thereof even
[1:16:20] with the two lamps to be set
[1:16:23] in order and all the vessels thereof and
[1:16:26] the oil for Life Leviticus 1 7 and the
[1:16:29] sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire
[1:16:31] upon the Altar and lay the wood in order
[1:16:35] upon the fire First Kings chapter 18
[1:16:38] verse 33 Elijah and he put the wood
[1:16:44] ah
[1:16:46] so this is out to the prophets of Baal
[1:16:48] have jumped and screamed and hollered
[1:16:50] and carried on why didn't he just go
[1:16:52] over there and grab a hold of a
[1:16:53] sacrifice and just cut its net pile it
[1:16:55] up on the rest that stuff he said I
[1:16:56] ain't doing nothing like that God's a
[1:16:58] god of order so what did he do he had
[1:17:00] Stones brought in and the right amount
[1:17:03] of stones and he had a ditch dug I
[1:17:06] imagine taking the wall to set up that
[1:17:08] church wouldn't you and he went to land
[1:17:09] it all out he wanted everything to be in
[1:17:12] order but Divine protocol he knew God
[1:17:14] had a spiritual numerology he knew it
[1:17:18] was threes it was fives it was sevens it
[1:17:21] was 40s it was 21s he knew that God had
[1:17:24] a spiritual numerology and that God must
[1:17:27] be worshiped in the right way you all
[1:17:30] understand the same thing tonight God
[1:17:32] must be worshiped the right way and I'll
[1:17:34] tell you what the Jesus said the father
[1:17:36] is going to seek such to worship him
[1:17:38] those that worship Him in spirit and in
[1:17:41] truth some people have a lot of spirit
[1:17:44] and ain't got much truth a lot of folks
[1:17:46] have got a lot of Truth so they say and
[1:17:48] ain't got much spirit I want both here
[1:17:50] anybody else want that I want spirit and
[1:17:53] I want truth I'm not interested in
[1:17:55] fanaticism oh sure I'll take a little
[1:17:58] bit of wildfire instead of no fire at
[1:18:00] all but I don't figure we have to have
[1:18:02] Wildfire or no fire I figure we can have
[1:18:05] the right amount of word and spirit and
[1:18:08] worship and singing and praying come on
[1:18:10] somebody I believe the Lord God wants us
[1:18:13] to be able to have the divine order that
[1:18:16] don't mean we don't praise him that
[1:18:18] don't mean we don't worship him but it
[1:18:20] means we come with respect into his
[1:18:24] August course we don't come in and just
[1:18:26] throw our sacrifice down and just give
[1:18:29] him whatever we want but we give him
[1:18:31] things that cost us something sometimes
[1:18:34] it ain't him wanting your money it's him
[1:18:36] wanting your hands raised up he knows
[1:18:39] your arms are tired because you've
[1:18:41] worked hard today but he says daughter
[1:18:43] do you love me enough to raise him tired
[1:18:46] arms do you love me enough son to raise
[1:18:49] them tired arms oh they're hurting and
[1:18:52] they're aching more the glory to God if
[1:18:54] you raise them up when you take them
[1:18:56] back down you might get healed well that
[1:18:58] happened to a young brother sitting
[1:19:00] right here tonight that happened not
[1:19:01] long ago I made that very remark in the
[1:19:04] service and he couldn't hardly even
[1:19:06] raise his arms but he put his arms up in
[1:19:09] the presence of God and went to Worship
[1:19:11] in the Lord and what he took him back
[1:19:13] down they were healed Hallelujah God may
[1:19:17] be waiting for you to raise them tired
[1:19:19] arms he may be waiting for you to clap
[1:19:22] them tired hands he may be waiting for
[1:19:25] you to put Force the effort well you
[1:19:27] told my brother this is the order of
[1:19:29] Melchizedek it is the order of sacrifice
[1:19:33] it is the order of worshiping God
[1:19:35] whether you feel like it or whether you
[1:19:38] don't you go to church and you love and
[1:19:41] you praise Hallelujah because you are
[1:19:44] called to do so
[1:19:54] notice Elijah put the wood in order
[1:19:58] and cut the Bullock in pieces
[1:20:00] and laid him on the wood notice
[1:20:03] everything so meticulously done and said
[1:20:07] Phil
[1:20:08] for I mean it was what the number four
[1:20:10] represents anybody
[1:20:12] four is the number of Earthly
[1:20:14] Deliverance
[1:20:16] Earthly delivers that's what the prophet
[1:20:18] said fill four barrels less water why
[1:20:22] not five why not three this time four is
[1:20:25] the number of Earthly deliverance and
[1:20:28] the people of God's fixing to be
[1:20:29] delivered from Baal worship
[1:20:32] fill four bottles of water and pour it
[1:20:34] on the sacrifice and on the wood you
[1:20:37] know the rest of the story First
[1:20:38] Chronicles 15 13 for because he did it
[1:20:41] not at the first the Lord Our God made a
[1:20:44] breach upon us now notice a general Visa
[1:20:47] broke the Commandment of God and God
[1:20:49] then made a breach
[1:20:52] a breach upon the children of Israel for
[1:20:55] that we sought him not
[1:20:58] after the do order
[1:21:03] do you understand there's been four
[1:21:05] great dispensations since the cross
[1:21:08] of God pouring out of his anointing from
[1:21:12] around the throne
[1:21:14] after each one of those pouring out of
[1:21:17] the beast's power the people got away
[1:21:19] from the worship under that do order
[1:21:22] our time will not be any different
[1:21:26] Satan will be allowed an opportunity to
[1:21:30] try to pull us out from under the do
[1:21:33] order of divine worship and revelation
[1:21:37] of the word
[1:21:38] under the eagle anointing
[1:21:43] but we're not going to let him have it
[1:21:47] Hallelujah
[1:21:48] now you saw that's Old Testament well
[1:21:52] New Testament First Corinthians 11 34 If
[1:21:55] any man hunger let him eat at home that
[1:21:58] you come back together into condemnation
[1:21:59] and the rest
[1:22:02] will I set
[1:22:08] Paul the first church hates messenger
[1:22:11] a man of the Holy Ghost is going to set
[1:22:14] some things in order
[1:22:16] in the New Testament Church
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:22] First Corinthians 14 40.
[1:22:25] let all sings
[1:22:27] be done
[1:22:33] oh
[1:22:35] decently
[1:22:36] and in order
[1:22:38] wow so you mean people can worship God
[1:22:41] and be emotional and I mean I'm talking
[1:22:44] about having a spell
[1:22:46] and do it decently
[1:22:51] it's either spirit of God Will Never
[1:22:53] Move On a Woman to make her Shout
[1:22:56] and do it ungodly
[1:22:58] or a man
[1:23:00] peace brother Donnie I'm with you
[1:23:02] brother Donnie Amen brother Tony Lord of
[1:23:05] God brother Noni see I told you I can do
[1:23:07] that
[1:23:08] so this man wants a move of God Among
[1:23:12] the people but he knows god well enough
[1:23:15] to know God will never do anything
[1:23:16] indecent
[1:23:18] ungodly or filthy
[1:23:22] praise the Lord
[1:23:25] yes I told Carol several years ago the
[1:23:27] message people and many of them have
[1:23:28] never even seen a Pentecostal move
[1:23:30] they've never really seen much
[1:23:32] manifestation of gifts
[1:23:34] she can stand to be a witness to this
[1:23:36] tonight we've talked about it several
[1:23:37] times and I've told her I said if there
[1:23:39] ever breaks force a move around this
[1:23:41] message
[1:23:42] that's of the supernatural order
[1:23:45] that's gifts
[1:23:46] it will be absolutely amazing how many
[1:23:49] people will follow it and leave the word
[1:23:51] for it
[1:23:53] why they never saw it
[1:23:56] and you see if you've never saw it and
[1:23:58] known what it was because we've had two
[1:24:01] moves by the same name
[1:24:03] it's real easy until I use the same name
[1:24:06] and slip the lighter and try to identify
[1:24:10] people that it's the former
[1:24:12] so you can understand what I'm saying
[1:24:14] we've got two moves call Pentecost the
[1:24:17] original and the 1906.
[1:24:20] and if Satan can't convince you that you
[1:24:22] don't need Pentecost then he'll do his
[1:24:25] second scheme and that is try to slip in
[1:24:27] 1906 Pentecost and convince you it's the
[1:24:31] original
[1:24:34] praise those are
[1:24:36] but remember God will never do anything
[1:24:39] out of order
[1:24:41] and the church said
[1:24:44] now I saw a man one night a preacher an
[1:24:46] attempt down at all been in Kentucky and
[1:24:48] Carol and I was at that meeting and that
[1:24:50] preacher prayed for a woman unbuttoned
[1:24:52] or blouse put his hand right in her
[1:24:54] blouse
[1:24:56] uh-huh
[1:24:59] prayed for her
[1:25:01] a Godly
[1:25:04] indecent
[1:25:07] call me out
[1:25:09] after he called her out
[1:25:11] and told me the words
[1:25:14] that I prayed that day
[1:25:18] repeated the words of my prayer
[1:25:22] in the way that I prayed them
[1:25:27] if that ever breaks out in our ranks
[1:25:30] God have mercy
[1:25:38] hello
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:44] God never does anything at order
[1:25:47] don't you can you imagine how I felt
[1:25:50] when I was sitting there of course I'm
[1:25:51] questioning that man absolutely I'm
[1:25:53] questioning I'm sending us an owl in the
[1:25:55] world I'm sentenced close to him to
[1:25:57] brother Benton to where the woman was
[1:25:59] and I thought Lord
[1:26:01] say how can that be
[1:26:04] and call me out right after that and
[1:26:06] tell me the words that I said and then
[1:26:07] there you said thinking how can that be
[1:26:09] oh you can't imagine how I heard a tape
[1:26:13] July the 25th
[1:26:17] 1965 the anointed ones at the end time
[1:26:22] and when I heard that brother Jim I
[1:26:24] thought oh praise be to God
[1:26:28] praise be to God thank you Lord no
[1:26:31] friends I'm not interested in going back
[1:26:33] to that you know what because that was
[1:26:36] not the original ax come on that was
[1:26:39] laodicea and it was a mixture of the
[1:26:42] good and the bad I want the original I
[1:26:45] want the truth but I am not accepting no
[1:26:48] faith I am not accepting a hit and a
[1:26:51] miss and a hit and a miss and a hit and
[1:26:53] a miss that might work on your own Model
[1:26:55] A but I don't want a Model A I want
[1:26:58] Rapture power I don't want no hit no
[1:27:01] Miss no hit no mess I need head on all
[1:27:04] cylinders I need to leave this world
[1:27:07] we need to get out of this place
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:16] ah
[1:27:17] notice the meaning of this word this new
[1:27:19] testament word
[1:27:21] order I thought the meaning of this in
[1:27:24] the name of this word in the Greek
[1:27:25] actually was absolutely beautiful it's
[1:27:28] the word Taxi
[1:27:31] t-a-x-i-s Taxi and it means an
[1:27:35] arrangement Arrangement a fixed
[1:27:37] succession observing a fixed time
[1:27:40] orderly condition the post rank or
[1:27:45] position which one holds in a Civic or
[1:27:47] other Affairs and since this position
[1:27:49] generally depends on one's talents
[1:27:52] experiences resources character fashion
[1:27:56] quality and style
[1:27:59] so you mean this is the word that Paul
[1:28:02] used describing the Church of the Living
[1:28:04] God
[1:28:07] Hallelujah so you see God is not against
[1:28:10] divine order as a matter of fact he's
[1:28:13] the author of it
[1:28:15] First Corinthians chapter 16 verse 1
[1:28:17] Paul said now concerning the collection
[1:28:20] for the Saints as I have given
[1:28:25] to the churches of galatia even so do
[1:28:28] you Titus 1 5 for this cause left eye
[1:28:32] thee in Crete that thou shouldest
[1:28:37] now remember there's over a hundred
[1:28:39] cities in the island of Crete they had
[1:28:41] had a Revival from the north to the
[1:28:43] South very narrow Island thousands of
[1:28:45] people live there and Paul was God
[1:28:47] called away and Titus is going in Paul's
[1:28:52] dead and Titus is actually going to go
[1:28:55] in the churches and work with the local
[1:28:58] churches and going to ordain elders
[1:29:02] you see the church was not multiplied by
[1:29:06] a one-man feeling led to go here in
[1:29:08] another and feeling led to go there and
[1:29:10] another and feeling led to go there but
[1:29:12] it was organized under the apostolic
[1:29:15] order well come on somebody preach with
[1:29:17] it under the apostolic order you didn't
[1:29:21] just go out and start a church that's
[1:29:24] not the Bible show me
[1:29:26] show me
[1:29:28] you did not go out and start a church on
[1:29:30] your own you were sent from the church
[1:29:33] that's how the church gave birth they
[1:29:36] didn't miscarry they gave birth then
[1:29:39] Paul had sent this man and he was to
[1:29:42] ordain Elders in every city well wait a
[1:29:45] minute what about this guy didn't he
[1:29:46] fill it feel that show me in your Bible
[1:29:48] and I'll preach it but until you do I'll
[1:29:51] preach this and I'll tell you before you
[1:29:52] even search it you ain't going to find
[1:29:54] it because it's not the original order
[1:29:56] now most of us absolutely are so against
[1:29:59] organization and why are we because it's
[1:30:01] a man-made system right but not only
[1:30:04] does man make systems but man makes
[1:30:07] churches too
[1:30:08] you see a man-made church does not have
[1:30:11] a foundation off the word
[1:30:13] a man-made church does not give birth
[1:30:16] the way the word says neither does it go
[1:30:19] out from the church the way the word
[1:30:20] said
[1:30:21] testing one two I must be losing and
[1:30:24] losing you all somehow
[1:30:27] you see God
[1:30:33] God will not last
[1:30:37] oh but we've got God's blessing those
[1:30:39] sure the children of Israel had them for
[1:30:40] years and years and every one of them's
[1:30:42] days was numbered and those unbelievers
[1:30:44] died in the wilderness and yet God fed
[1:30:46] them God watered them God give them
[1:30:47] clothes and ain't none of us God's ever
[1:30:49] blessed like them and yet they were
[1:30:51] doomed and Damned
[1:30:52] the blessing didn't change one thing
[1:30:55] oh the prophet said a young man come to
[1:30:57] him not long ago and said brother
[1:30:58] Branham the lord loves me so much he'll
[1:31:00] just let me get by with anything I can
[1:31:03] just do anything I want in case you
[1:31:04] understand that's what blinds people
[1:31:06] when they leave the word and the
[1:31:08] blessing of God continues on they said
[1:31:10] see that I must be in the will of God I
[1:31:13] must be in the will of God God's
[1:31:14] blessing me boy I'll tell you one thing
[1:31:16] but God is trying you don't you
[1:31:19] understand why the prophet said in God's
[1:31:20] chosen a place of worship why this God
[1:31:22] even allow those other gates in order to
[1:31:26] tempt you by
[1:31:27] in order to see will you stay with my
[1:31:31] word will he allow false prophets to
[1:31:34] come Among Us yes he will will he allow
[1:31:37] false preachers to rise up yes he will
[1:31:40] what for in order to try his bride and
[1:31:43] when it's all said and done that bride
[1:31:46] will never move from that word
[1:31:53] oh my notice Isaiah 62 10. now watch
[1:31:58] can I have a few more minutes
[1:32:02] God all down through the Old Testament
[1:32:04] in various situations and dispensations
[1:32:07] he would use these terms of lifting up a
[1:32:10] standard
[1:32:12] and this was scripture he says go
[1:32:14] through go through the gates prepare you
[1:32:16] the way the people cast up cast up the
[1:32:19] highway gathered out the stone lift up a
[1:32:22] standard
[1:32:24] for the people
[1:32:26] lift up a standard
[1:32:29] so this was also an illusion to the
[1:32:31] soldiers because the soldiers in the
[1:32:34] middle of battle and everybody's
[1:32:36] fighting and dust is arising and bullish
[1:32:38] is going off and people are bloody and
[1:32:40] some of them is falling and some is
[1:32:42] running you'll imagine trying to find
[1:32:44] which side you're on
[1:32:45] and then you wake up in the middle of
[1:32:47] that battle and you look around and
[1:32:49] everybody you look at is not on your
[1:32:52] side
[1:32:53] and you found yourself in the middle of
[1:32:56] the battle
[1:32:57] and you swap sides
[1:32:59] and you wasn't even aware you had it in
[1:33:02] the world did you get into that you got
[1:33:03] under a delusion of some sort you got
[1:33:05] amnesia and you don't even know which
[1:33:08] side you go on oh well what am I doing
[1:33:09] oh no what and what I'm on the enemy's
[1:33:12] lines I'm on the enemy's side how could
[1:33:15] that be how am I going to find my way
[1:33:16] back God said lift up a standard
[1:33:19] somebody raised up a standard high so
[1:33:22] they can look and see they got caught
[1:33:24] away for a little bit they got
[1:33:26] sidetracked for a little bit but raised
[1:33:28] a standard that's what I'm trying to do
[1:33:30] friends I'm trying to raise the standard
[1:33:33] other true men of God that's what
[1:33:35] they're trying to do oh they got lots of
[1:33:37] opposition and it confuses the people
[1:33:39] because one preacher will lift up this
[1:33:41] standard and another preacher said no no
[1:33:43] no don't believe him I've got the
[1:33:45] standards then another and said no no no
[1:33:47] both of them are wrong I've got the
[1:33:49] standard but you remember a god-called
[1:33:52] man will never leave that word and he
[1:33:55] won't dissect that word and take one
[1:33:57] quote here in one quote there and then
[1:33:59] you send them 52 more and they won't
[1:34:01] even read one of them there's something
[1:34:03] wrong with the standard he's flying come
[1:34:06] on children the Holy Ghost can say Amen
[1:34:09] to God's word
[1:34:13] hmm
[1:34:15] notice I'll say 11 10 and in that day
[1:34:18] there shall be a root of Jesse hear the
[1:34:20] Lord Jesus in the prophecy which shall
[1:34:22] stand for an in sign
[1:34:26] of the people
[1:34:28] something lifted up a standard a signal
[1:34:31] a banner a standard
[1:34:34] I was a rallying point
[1:34:37] can't you see we've been here we've been
[1:34:40] here for many many years and many times
[1:34:42] we've been here
[1:34:44] and Satan will raise up a man
[1:34:47] and he'll start blowing the trumpet
[1:34:49] and holding up the standard this is it
[1:34:52] this is the bride's Revival
[1:34:54] and people go to hearing about him oh
[1:34:56] yeah they come here they come man they
[1:34:58] go to moving they go to doing this and
[1:35:00] that and Heather it don't take them long
[1:35:01] been there to realize I didn't know
[1:35:03] bride's Revival it's an emotional stir
[1:35:06] jumping and shouting around some man in
[1:35:08] his gift
[1:35:13] 49-22 thus saith the Lord God behold I
[1:35:15] will lift up my hand to the Gentiles and
[1:35:18] set up my standard to the people
[1:35:22] and they shall bring listen to this
[1:35:25] they shall bring the Suns and their arms
[1:35:28] and thy daughter shall be carried upon
[1:35:30] their shoulders
[1:35:32] praise God you see whenever it's the
[1:35:35] standard of God it's not only good for
[1:35:37] Daddy it's good for Mama it's good for
[1:35:40] you youngins it's good for the
[1:35:42] backslider Psalms 60 and 4 thou Hast
[1:35:45] given a banner something lifted up a
[1:35:48] standard a signal thou Hast given a
[1:35:50] banner to them that feare thee that it
[1:35:53] may be displayed because of the truth
[1:36:01] oh praise the Lord
[1:36:04] and I've been wanting to get to this
[1:36:06] verse right here all night long
[1:36:11] Song of Solomon Chapter 2.
[1:36:14] verse 4.
[1:36:17] he brought me
[1:36:20] to the banqueting house
[1:36:23] and His Banner
[1:36:25] over me
[1:36:27] was love
[1:36:29] now what you notice
[1:36:31] the two-fold of this
[1:36:33] from the groom to the bride
[1:36:37] he brought me
[1:36:39] to the banqueting house
[1:36:42] actually this word
[1:36:44] has a couple of different meanings
[1:36:47] one of them is
[1:36:49] the house of wines w-i-n-e-s
[1:36:55] so it wasn't just a kitchen
[1:36:58] where they sampled it
[1:37:00] but it was a room
[1:37:02] where they become so intoxicated
[1:37:06] revelation after revelation after
[1:37:10] revelation
[1:37:11] he brought me to the banqueting house
[1:37:14] the one use of the Hebrew word there is
[1:37:17] House of wines
[1:37:19] but it has multiple aspects and the
[1:37:21] meaning of the word and it also means
[1:37:24] that it is a house
[1:37:27] it signifies wealth
[1:37:31] and the food that is prepared in this
[1:37:35] place is not your ordinary Fair
[1:37:38] it's not your ordinary stuff
[1:37:42] it's food that are real fine Delicacies
[1:37:48] now some of this may not sound very fine
[1:37:51] to some of you but in different parts of
[1:37:53] the world where I've been
[1:37:55] some of the people in that place wanted
[1:37:57] to give me some of their Rarities
[1:38:00] and I just assume they help them
[1:38:04] Lord have mercy I mean to them it's
[1:38:07] precious to them it's you know
[1:38:10] and I say brother I'll tell you what I I
[1:38:12] believe I'm fasting today
[1:38:16] well they take an egg and bury it in the
[1:38:19] ground and leave it there for several
[1:38:21] weeks
[1:38:23] uh-huh and you can imagine what it
[1:38:25] smells like
[1:38:26] but to them it is a delicacy you know to
[1:38:30] the Romans a peacock said on the table
[1:38:34] before a magistrate on a great banquet a
[1:38:38] peacock would have been set there and
[1:38:40] they There's real artisans in the way
[1:38:42] they would prepare the Italians and they
[1:38:45] would set it with the tail all spread
[1:38:47] out in the head and then they would take
[1:38:50] to meet of course and lay it out so when
[1:38:52] you walked in there the food you were
[1:38:55] eating let you know how he thought about
[1:38:58] you

[1:39:04] your position and the man giving the
[1:39:07] banquet the food that he fed you let you
[1:39:11] know what he thought about you

[1:45:56] this is my 21st day my whole trip I
[1:46:01] watched every bite I ate
[1:46:04] until they convinced me
[1:46:06] it was good
[1:46:08] and it was some of the best looking food
[1:46:10] I'd seen
[1:46:12] and I ate and I paid
[1:46:15] I was so weak when I got to church I
[1:46:18] couldn't hardly even stand up
[1:46:21] I told the brothers and sisters you're
[1:46:22] gonna have to walk beside me to get me
[1:46:24] out there's no way I'm going to get
[1:46:25] there
[1:46:26] so they helped me get out on the
[1:46:27] platform
[1:46:28] and I took my text
[1:46:32] read the scriptures
[1:46:33] and I said a lot to preach to you this
[1:46:36] morning
[1:46:36] on a drink
[1:46:38] for the king
[1:46:42] where by the time the Lord got done with
[1:46:44] that service the king had a drink you
[1:46:46] can imagine
[1:46:47] I mean them people shot and screaming
[1:46:49] the anointing come on me in a matter of
[1:46:52] minutes it was like a jar of bolt of
[1:46:54] light and hit me I never had not one
[1:46:56] more stomach pain I never had one more
[1:46:59] weakness I run I screamed I hollered I
[1:47:01] shouted there was a wet Trail back and
[1:47:03] forth across that Pulpit oh my did we
[1:47:06] have a Time
[1:47:08] and as soon as the anointing left me and
[1:47:10] I walked that off that platform I
[1:47:12] grabbed my belly again
[1:47:13] I nearly died
[1:47:15] I know some of y'all remember not when I
[1:47:17] got home my eyes changed colors my eyes
[1:47:20] turned the color of orange about that
[1:47:21] sister's blouse color her blouse
[1:47:25] it took me weeks and weeks to get over
[1:47:28] it
[1:47:29] because the food looks so Sumptuous it
[1:47:33] looks so nice and they gave me their
[1:47:36] word
[1:47:37] this won't hurt you
[1:47:43] I'd have been better off to brush my
[1:47:45] teeth and Coke and went to bed
[1:47:48] preachers will lie to you
[1:47:51] they will tell you this is God's word
[1:47:54] this will help you this is what you'll
[1:47:57] need but don't you never
[1:47:59] leave God's Great program
[1:48:02] [Applause]
[1:48:11] Hallelujah
[1:48:15] don't you love him
[1:48:18] so here we are sitting in this Grand
[1:48:21] banqueting Mouse
[1:48:24] all the stately dignitaries are there in
[1:48:27] all the magistive
[1:48:29] his omnipotence
[1:48:32] All These Fine Delicacies are there
[1:48:35] wow we're looking at this food and say
[1:48:37] man a lot I never see no food like that
[1:48:43] now when you raise poor like I was
[1:48:46] we had beans taters and maters
[1:48:50] and then other meals we had maters
[1:48:52] taters and beans
[1:48:55] you see Mama Said in a different way so
[1:48:57] it makes you think had something more
[1:48:59] I was giving Eliana a little update on
[1:49:02] her puppy's background yesterday I took
[1:49:05] her to a doctor's appointment
[1:49:08] she's talking how crowded it is in their
[1:49:09] house and how small their bathroom is
[1:49:12] and all I said yeah honey I know but I I
[1:49:14] just don't know what else we can do I
[1:49:15] just don't know anything else we can do
[1:49:16] about it I said but let me tell you a
[1:49:18] story
[1:49:19] you see when poppy was a little boy we
[1:49:21] lived in a house that didn't even have a
[1:49:25] bathroom in it
[1:49:28] we didn't have running water the running
[1:49:31] water was me running outside to bring
[1:49:33] the water in
[1:49:35] that was running water
[1:49:41] and Mom and Daddy
[1:49:42] finally got an FHA loan
[1:49:45] I was able to build a house I'm sure you
[1:49:48] remembered Harry little Brick House
[1:49:49] pretty little house 1200 square feet
[1:49:54] three bedrooms one bath
[1:49:57] a mama and a daddy
[1:50:01] and seven young ones
[1:50:06] Ellie's conclusion to that story was
[1:50:08] well I guess we're blessed
[1:50:10] ah
[1:50:12] because I got three bathrooms in their
[1:50:14] house
[1:50:17] boy when we moved into that house I mean
[1:50:20] we was uptown
[1:50:23] we had brick wow
[1:50:26] and we could go into the bathroom and do
[1:50:29] this and water would run out of that
[1:50:32] thing
[1:50:33] man alive
[1:50:37] well when I was in Pentecost
[1:50:40] I eat Chucks every way they could be
[1:50:43] prepared
[1:50:45] dried shocks
[1:50:46] wet Chucks
[1:50:49] scalloped Chucks
[1:50:51] deep fried chunks barbecue Chucks
[1:50:55] marinated Chucks
[1:51:00] but I don't mind telling you since I've
[1:51:02] been called to the banqueting Temple of
[1:51:04] the king
[1:51:05] I don't eat no more shucks
[1:51:09] no
[1:51:16] and then people leaving this word
[1:51:19] and want to take us with them
[1:51:23] just cause they lost their mind don't
[1:51:25] mean we're losing hours
[1:51:27] we want to go about yourself can you
[1:51:28] imagine myself some of the people that
[1:51:30] have said in the message said in message
[1:51:32] churches and left a message and gone
[1:51:34] back to trinitarian churches and some of
[1:51:36] them that was baptized in the name of
[1:51:37] the Lord Jesus had been re-baptized in
[1:51:39] the name and titles
[1:51:41] and they said under this message
[1:51:44] or they may have said under but they
[1:51:45] sure didn't have no revelation of it
[1:51:48] but you know the prophet said about some
[1:51:50] of them people he said this food was too
[1:51:52] rich for him
[1:51:54] made him sick to their stomach
[1:51:56] I've come to realize that some that set
[1:51:58] in our own church was the same way I
[1:52:01] preached you hard for him
[1:52:03] I preached too much of the message for
[1:52:06] them
[1:52:07] and I studied too much
[1:52:09] and I preached too high
[1:52:12] they'd rather have a preacher that don't
[1:52:14] really do a lot of preaching
[1:52:16] and don't really demand much of them you
[1:52:19] know a lot of folks want a condo priest
[1:52:20] type
[1:52:21] just goes around fellowships with
[1:52:23] everybody and consent preaches about 15
[1:52:25] or 20 minutes
[1:52:26] can you honestly believe that's going to
[1:52:28] put you in a rapture
[1:52:35] I desire more than anything in this
[1:52:38] world
[1:52:40] to leave here when the Rapture comes
[1:52:43] and I believe my diet
[1:52:46] will determine
[1:52:48] whether I go or not
[1:52:55] if I'm sitting at the table
[1:52:57] and he himself is handing me Delicacies
[1:53:01] here Donnie
[1:53:03] have you ever tried this before
[1:53:07] the oh my Lord
[1:53:10] what is that called
[1:53:12] deity of Jesus Christ 1949.
[1:53:17] deity is no longer in heaven
[1:53:20] but it's on the earth and the hearts of
[1:53:24] the Believers
[1:53:26] wow man that is strong stuff
[1:53:29] that is good stuff Lord you got any more
[1:53:32] of that you just getting started boy
[1:53:35] yes I've got more I've got more and
[1:53:38] there's more to come with it
[1:53:40] you imagine them sitting down there in
[1:53:41] the land of Egypt
[1:53:44] Moses given them again orders
[1:53:46] take a lamb do this certain certain
[1:53:49] thing sought it with don't do it this

[1:53:58] herbs that you like lay aside the
[1:54:00] seasoning your favorite season don't
[1:54:02] even cook it that way at all
[1:54:05] do such ancestor with the blood do this
[1:54:07] do this do the boy it looks like a bossy
[1:54:09] bunch
[1:54:13] or Feller sent another hunt in his back
[1:54:15] all humped over
[1:54:16] hey boy them all day one day you cooked
[1:54:19] a lot of lamb

[1:54:46] little warm feeling go over that hump in
[1:54:48] his back
[1:54:52] glory to God
[1:54:55] what was they doing eating the lamb
[1:54:58] before the journey
[1:55:00] you're either going to eat yourself to a
[1:55:02] Rapture or you're going to eat yourself
[1:55:05] to a nuclear annihilation
[1:55:12] to me there's no comparison
[1:55:16] so what do you say we sat at the
[1:55:18] banqueting table
[1:55:20] and then we look up and we say
[1:55:25] I'm sitting at his banqueting table
[1:55:28] and His Banner
[1:55:30] his end sign over me
[1:55:34] is his name
[1:55:39] love
[1:55:41] for God
[1:55:43] is
[1:55:46] so he conquered you not by fear not by
[1:55:50] trauma
[1:55:51] he conquered You by love
[1:55:55] told you into the banqueting house
[1:55:58] and then brother Daryl set up the

[2:05:38] praise the Lord
[2:05:42] I was uh brother Samuel Browning's on
[2:05:44] Thursday
[2:05:46] night and a brother came into the study
[2:05:49] I was wanting a prayer cloth and he was
[2:05:52] going to take it right after service up
[2:05:53] to another city to I believe it was his
[2:05:56] sister-in-law
[2:05:58] they was hoping that she would be alive
[2:05:59] when they got there because cancer was
[2:06:02] consuming her body and
[2:06:03] so me and brother Browning and the
[2:06:05] brother prayed over this little piece of
[2:06:06] prayer cloth and so they they left after
[2:06:09] service and went up there and brother
[2:06:11] Samuel sent me a text yesterday that
[2:06:14] foreign
[2:06:15] when they got up there she was still
[2:06:17] alive and she actually gave her heart to
[2:06:19] the Lord surrendered to the Lord
[2:06:21] and she said I'm not going out of here
[2:06:23] in a body bag I'm going to live
[2:06:26] the tumor was so large in her esophagus
[2:06:28] that actually caused her lung to
[2:06:30] collapse since she was on six liters of
[2:06:32] oxygen
[2:06:33] the next day she was down to two liters
[2:06:36] of oxygen there was no fluid in her
[2:06:38] lungs she was sitting up eating a
[2:06:40] hamburger and when the doctor came in he
[2:06:41] said he was totally amazed because he
[2:06:44] figured she had done be gone
[2:06:46] but that's just the god that we served
[2:06:50] amen
[2:06:54] he's so wonderful
[2:06:57] me and Cheryl was in Pawnee Oklahoma a
[2:07:00] week before last I believe it was and
[2:07:02] brother Joel Pruitt's wife he's been
[2:07:05] Pruitt's brother from down in Hardy
[2:07:06] Arkansas she had been bit by a tick that
[2:07:09] placed the bacteria in her body that
[2:07:11] made her extremely allergic to any kind
[2:07:13] of meat
[2:07:14] they actually gave her an EpiPen and
[2:07:16] said if you eat some meat unbeknownst
[2:07:18] and it causes your throat to swell use
[2:07:21] this pen
[2:07:22] and so she came up for prayer on Friday
[2:07:24] night and the saints of God prayed for
[2:07:26] the sister when the service was over she
[2:07:28] went over to the fellowship hall ate a
[2:07:30] big bunch of barbecue I talked to
[2:07:31] brother Joel the other day said brother
[2:07:33] now she is completely healed
[2:07:36] waiting there
[2:07:38] amen
[2:07:45] but you know the Lord Jesus he never
[2:07:48] said did you feel it
[2:07:51] but he did say did you believe it
[2:07:54] when Lazarus got the worst news that any
[2:07:56] man could ever get
[2:07:59] he said trouble the master no more your
[2:08:01] little girl is gone
[2:08:04] Jesus gave you the answer to every bad
[2:08:07] report you'll ever get
[2:08:08] when he touched him on the shoulder and
[2:08:10] said two words only believe
[2:08:15] only believe
[2:08:17] do you believe
[2:08:19] he said brother I've got a problem then
[2:08:22] you're just a candidate for a miracle
[2:08:24] all miracles start with a problem
[2:08:27] amen
[2:08:32] the day of the accident
[2:08:35] with brother Homer and Rachel was was
[2:08:38] killed and Jessica was hurt so bad
[2:08:40] there was an ambulance there for
[2:08:42] Rachel's body and I asked if I could put
[2:08:44] my family in that ambulance
[2:08:47] so we all gathered in the back of the
[2:08:48] ambulance
[2:08:50] and we begin to pray
[2:08:53] and I told my family
[2:08:56] he brought us to his banquet table
[2:08:59] and His Banner Over Us his love
[2:09:04] that's what we prayed
[2:09:06] because that's just the kind of God that
[2:09:08] we serve no matter what we face in life
[2:09:10] he's got it all in control
[2:09:13] and the Bible says all things sometimes
[2:09:16] even when we don't understand
[2:09:18] it's still working for our good
[2:09:21] to bring us to that place he had of us
[2:09:23] in his mind before there's a real world
[2:09:26] do you love him tonight
[2:09:28] bro said he wants to heal you a thousand
[2:09:30] times more than you want to be healed
[2:09:33] so when we pray whatever it is that's
[2:09:35] bothering you you just lay at the feet
[2:09:37] of Jesus
[2:09:38] and take his freedom
[2:09:41] for he said whom the son hath made free
[2:09:43] is free indeed
[2:09:46] amen
[2:09:47] let's just lay hands on one another
[2:09:49] tonight
[2:09:55] Heavenly Father
[2:09:59] thou has raised Christ from the grave
[2:10:02] I sent the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:04] into the hearts of the Believers
[2:10:07] for father as our pastor are quoted Lord
[2:10:09] and deity of Jesus Christ in 1949

[2:10:20] believe that we're the Tabernacle that
[2:10:21] the anointing of the almighty God that's
