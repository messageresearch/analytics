[0:00] no one says Paul in second Corinthians
[0:02] chapter 10 verse 1 now I Paul myself
[0:05] beseech you by the meekness and
[0:10] gentleness of Christ on what grounds
[0:15] does this man have to beseech him as if
[0:19] though he had tapped into the very
[0:22] nature of God he didn't say my

[1:32] suchlike closes a lot of our problems if
[1:34] you can only say really what our trials
