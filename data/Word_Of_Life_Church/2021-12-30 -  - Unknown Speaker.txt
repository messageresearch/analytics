verse one when sanbalad and tabai and gashim the arabian the rest of our enemies heard that i builded the wall there was no breach left therein though at that time i'd not set up the doors upon the gates then sanbalad and yashim sent unto me saying come let us meet together in one of the villages and the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief now you see nehemiah had the answer to the
