specific reason best to believe the word for this hour to be a beaming light in a dark world I heard brother Brent selling to take the other day that the the world is he's getting more growth than darkness all the time every day we live it's more dark getting more dark but he said there's a great light that's pressing down light will overtake darkness anytime do you believe that with all your

offering this morning you have to remind them all the time to do their job bless their hearts don't you look at me like that praise the Lord we appreciate these guys totally god bless their hearts they bear all of our visitors today we want to say we welcome you glad to have you in the house of the Lord those that would be streaming today we pray that this service would be a great blessing to those folks as well as I will say we have some visitors with us today but their sister green from over in West Virginia I believe that's where they live that's brother Brendan's mother and father and the brother Brandon and his father they have some songs this morning I don't know exactly how they have that put together but if they come on the platform at this time now you go ahead and laugh you'll get old one day it's coming just to be sure it's coming you are not to tell me that way Brandon praise the Lord but we certainly appreciate brother Brendan Green and his family sister named Ian and the boys we certainly do and we're so glad to have brother sister green senior with us this morning into service and we're just trying our best to get them to be Carter County people hope that'll work out don't know if that he will but I hope they will don't you go brother Brandon and his father a nice hand this morning as they get ready to sing for you enjoyed the service last night we enjoyed the message it's so true about fear I knew as a young man God had called me to minister but so many times we let fear be that guiding force you know we I kind of thought well I may not be as good as the next guy and I may make a mistake God said you probably will the devil kept saying well you're not worthy the Lord said you're right but he said because of the blood of Jesus Christ that was spilled I made you worthy so you never give a preacher that God has taken the fear away a mic so I appreciate I'd been sick back in the back in the winter and early spring and I appreciate all the prayers and about the last five or five weeks or so felt felt a lot better and also just like to praise the Lord for I've got a brother that has terminal lung cancer started in his throat thought they had it cleared up went to his lungs a little bit over a year ago but for about the last two months he's been completely off of oxygen he's off of his steroids they tried two medicines and each medicine the cancer grew each time and finally it come down to where they said we don't have any other choice there was no other medicine that's been proven that can help they said we've got two that will try one doctor even refused to try and he said I want to try he's got a little nine-year-old girl he said whatever I can do he went for a scan about two weeks ago he got his report and they said that the cancer had decreased by 50% I don't believe it was the medicine I believe was the hand of God you know my brother had run he had run from the Lord for many many years sometimes the Lord allows tragic things to happen in her life to get us where we need to be and so for the last four or five months he's been sitting in church he's giving life to the Lord he told me said in February he said the battle stopped he said I give up he said so I'm okay if God takes me and it's his will he said I'm fine with that but he said I'm glad that I'm still here and that God has given me another opportunity to live a few more days so I thank the Lord for that God still a healer I agree with the brother he said the world thinks we're crazy they do but let me be numbered among the crazy and I'll serve God with all of my crazy heart because he's worthy of our praise he's worthy to be honored I thank him that it's all him and none of me them the minister said last night he said right here it's all of it's all the Lord it's none of us and so I appreciate the Lord because he's been good to me he's blessed me just to know him in the fellowship and the fullness of his spirit to know God that that he has given us what we need in this dark age we are living in a dark age and so I appreciate the Lord for his love and for his great mercy I was on a mountain and one tree from the fountain

always to compensate by the Donny for having us amen again Ephesians chapter six we'll have you turn straight to the word amen and we just want to read starting with verse 10 starting with verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand to stand against the wiles of the devil what are the wiles of the devil good question we're going to look at that today for we wrestle not notice this it doesn't say that we don't wrestle because we do it's not what Paul's saying he's saying we don't wrestle we don't fight we don't we don't war no we do war but we don't war against flesh and blood issues or flesh and blood problems or flesh and blood addictions you may have addictions people may be addicted but the problem is not a flesh and blood issue but we wrestle against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day you are in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me that other utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 one more scripture will have you be seated second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 we'd like to speak to you this morning on a title dimensional discernment dimensional discernment less Satan verse 11 of 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord this morning God that you've gathered us and assembled us here again Lord under that name that is above every name Lord it's higher than any sickness higher than any disease Lord that name is higher than any addiction Lord or problem that we could face today Lord so we lay all of our burdens at the feet of Jesus this morning Lord you told us cast your cares upon me for I careth for you so we cast them down Lord Jesus this morning we lay them down Lord and I pray God that you would just come speak word Lord a word of refreshment to your body Lord may we just be attentive to the Word of God that goes forth Lord I pray that you would bind every evil spirit that would try to hinder the preaching of your word this morning Lord may you bind every evil spirit that would try to hinder the receiving of that word Lord in the bringing forth I pray God you would be with us Lord in this church this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this morning dimensional discernment we like to look at and and and just for a few minutes here to look at this multi-dimensional world that we live in and the first part of this will just be laying a foundation so just stay real attentive this morning is we'll be going through this quickly through some scriptures and some things the Prophet had to say about this but what we need to have happen this morning and if I could accomplish this purpose it would be to have our spiritual eyes opened because Paul said we shouldn't be ignorant of Satan devices that when he speaks of devices he's speaking that Satan has a plan or a tactic or a scheme and the prophet of God says it this way that overcoming is recognizing the devil's tactics to recognize the devil's schemes and he's got a playbook that he's playing by just as two teams that would face each other the one team would study the weaknesses and the strengths of the other team and they would literally devise a plan or a playbook to exploit the areas of weakness in the other team and Satan has devised the playbook against humanity against God's people and he wants to enact those plays and he wants to enact his schemes but Paul said we should have wisdom our spiritual eyes should be open so that we're not ignorant of Satan's tactics were not ignorant of his devices oh no brother Matt don't go there Paul says were not ignorant of his devices were not ignorant of his tactics but what we're speaking of when we speak on dimensional discernment is understanding that there is a kingdom understanding the kingdom of the devil and of Satan understanding the reality that there is angels and there is demon spirits and that there's demons that are lurking in another world in another dimension that tries to influence you every day of your life angels both good and bad a bad angel is called a demon spirit that's what a demon is it's a fallen angel an angel has a free will they have the ability to make a choice their disk their their their position that God gave them was to be a messenger and they can have a choice to choose to deliver that message or to rebel against God we're told in the scripture very clearly that angels rebelled against God and against heaven and that they left their own Jude says that they left their first estate they left their habitation and those angels that were good angels created for good purposes became bad with bad intents and they become demon spirits what the Apostle Paul is saying here in Ephesians 6 is that there's a real struggle a real battle a real war that's taking place and it's not against flesh and blood it's not a physical what we need to understand and as mature Christians today is that no matter what issue you bring up today no matter what problem or sin or disease or addiction that it's not a flesh and blood battle that you're facing today but it's a spiritual battle and it's a real battle that's really taking place right now in another dimension Paul says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against spiritual wickedness in high places that word high places that Paul is speaking that is another dimension it's it's an atmosphere that we wrestle our war our struggle every day as a believer as a Christian and sometimes we can get confused and think that were we're dealing with real sit with with sin that is physical or we physically fall or we physically say the wrong thing but what you have to understand as a believer is that there was a spiritual influence that caused the natural response or action of doing the wrong thing that before you said the wrong thing there was a spirit in another dimension that influenced you whether you seen it or didn't see it or heard it or didn't hear it there was a spiritual action or pressure or influence that you're subjected to as a believer that causes every bad action are you with me here this morning and you may look at addictions today and you may look at a person who has a nicotine addiction or a drug addiction or a sex addiction or some addiction to popularity or money or fashion and you may look at those things and and think we're struggling against alcohol and if we could just defeat the alcohol the person may be addicted by it by a spirit of alcoholism but what you have to understand is that that's not alcoholism that you're facing or you're battling but it's a spirit a demon spirit that for some reason that person has given access to that demon to dwell inside of their spirit and that demon builds a stronghold in that man's life and we label it alcoholism but it's a stronghold a drug addiction is a stronghold a sex addiction is a stronghold no matter what you face today and are tempted within your flesh it is a spiritual battle taking place in an angelic dimension and you are call in the middle of a good influence coming from above and a bad influence coming from beneath and every single day your mission is to have victory in a dimension that you can't see and that can't feel and that you can't touch but it's taking place and the battle and the struggle is to get victory in that dimension hallelujah are you here today so we as believers need to understand that these problems are not flesh-and-blood issues but they're spiritual wickedness in high places and you could be demon-possessed today in this church sitting here hearing the Word of God you could be and so you can fight it in Jude that the scripture tells us that there's real angels the Bible says that they kept there they kept not their dwelling place but they left their own habitation and what we realized is that the demonic world is a real world the underworld is real it's not some Hollywood film that they create and they create my evil evil things that you see today produced by Hollywood even just the labels and the and and the images that they create they're tapping into another dimension that is a real dimension it's not fake it's not man thinks that they've created this world and their imagination and they think they crown them and give them a prizes and awards and say oh you you you you you acted so great in that film and you played that part so well in that film we're going to give you a an Oscar we're gonna give you an award what they don't realize is that the ability was given by a spirit who anointed that individual and gave them an inspiration to play a part to deceive the world no matter what you look at in the news today and you read about mass shootings in a every single day it seems like we turn on the news and there's another school shooting and someone's went up in the school and shot the shot people and and turns on fire alarms and as people are running outside it's gunning people down and you ask what happened was that person just a bad apple did they did they just have a messed up childhood no my brother it is demonic oppression that has literally infiltrated the minds of humanity to where the only thing that keeps an unconverted person sane is low in order and rules and regulations but by nature they are literally a beast by nature and more than ever before you're living in a world that the Prophet would call an age of total neurotics the brother madam said the world I promised I will go to a place to where they go completely insane and we're seeing the manifestation of it today it's the because you say why is it brother Matt why does that happen because a book but they've disregarded and then they've taken out of their schools but they've take it out of there and people don't want to preach it anymore but a book prophesied in the book of Revelation and said that the demon the dragon has unleashed forces and unleashed his wrath upon humanity it was prophesied in Scripture and it's happening before our very eyes the scripture says that that D that dragon has unleashed his wrath and fury the Bible says it this way that Satan has poured out his wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and as the time gets shorter and shorter he gets angrier he gets more desperate and what you're seeing today is desperation attempts trying everything he can to for it the plan of God but it won't be thwarted no weapon formed against this church shall prosper no tactic and no scheme that Satan wants to plan our devised or give us devices by but God's bride I'll have a supernatural discernment of a dimension of another world she'll be so on fire with the Holy Ghost and so rested there will be the Bride of Christ brother Branham said it this way she'll be in the very image of Jesus Christ her senses will be exercised to discern both good and evil so the scripture says what is it what the Bible teaches us is we just have to not get ahead of ourselves this morning but that there's the Bible what we understand from the scripture is that there's a real world there's real beings called angels intelligent creatures in the world that are supernatural beyond our human senses and they are there all the time I'm not just speaking of demon spirits I'm speaking of angelic spirits also but there's spirits all the time what the scripture teaches is then Jesus you see dealt with these even in his earthly ministry he deals with some of these spirits a demonic oppression and men people that were totally possessed and couldn't even speak they were so possessed by an evil spirit what the Bible teaches us is that there's good angels and there's bad angels and that you as a present believer are literally surrounded by a spiritual host of good and wickedness at all times and there are certain conditions that you can create that allow or invite the wrong spirit and there are certain conditions that you can create that invite or allow the right spirit that's why we don't go to certain places why because we're inviting the wrong spirit but there are certain places that we do go like Church why we're inviting the right spirit right and so these bad angels are not what we learn is there not in some underworld or some lair are somewhere way below that if you dig far enough you'll eventually come to the demons domain that demon spirits are not in some other world or other some millions of millions of miles away but what we learn that they're just right here right now just in another dimension and the real battle taking place right now is not happening on earth in a flesh and blood battle but it's happening in heavenly places got this chart here that if the brothers can just display it's a very busy chart and you may not be able to get too much from it the image that I had displayed the very first one but it just goes to show some our brother in the Philippines crater if you ever if you want it you can get with me I can get it to you it's a great way to describe the multi-dimensional environment that man lives in yeah brother you could go ahead and display that one that you got there yep it does it display it shows how that man lives in a multi-dimensional environment if you can't get it that's okay but where are we as humans are subjected to this environment at all times and this chart shows the different dimensions that we have here you notice over to that what would be your left you have the first dimension being liked the second dimension being matter and the third being time and you'll see how that the fourth dimension is this blue strip that goes from the very bottom all the way to the top and this is that fourth dimension that interacts with all of the dimensions that exist and that fourth dimension brother branham called science this is where television exists this is where internet radio waves science always is moving within and without even right now as I'm speaking to you today there is horrible images images you would never want to see that are flashing through this room right now there's voices that are taking place can you hear them can you see those images right now no no you can't there's ballgames in sports that are taking place and literally there's an image going across this room right now but you can't see them you can't hear them but if I take then place the right device that can tune into that dimension you would suddenly the images that are moving through this room now they were there all the time they didn't just suddenly appear if I was the stick of television right here and turn it on they wouldn't just magically appear but they were there before I turned the TV on the only difference was is that something I play something in front of you that have the ability and in a crystal to tune in to that other dimension are you with me here this morning it's the same exact way when the worship service begins to go and songs are being saying some people are literally existing and singing the songs of Zion in a physical dimension only but others are tapping out of this dimension and turning a crystal in their own spirit and type it into another dimension and those are the ones that are really worshiping God in spirit and in truth what is it it's worship from another dimension I want to be one of those worshipers I don't just want to be trapped here in this physical world of pain and sickness and problem but when I worship the Lord I want to move out of this world into a world that maybe I can't see with my eyes or hear with my ears but my spirit is tuned and synched with that dimension hallelujah and you have that fifth dimension the underworld brother branham says it this way that right underneath this dimension and underneath this realm of humans is the realm of the regions of the lost and just below that is the river the region of demon spirits and he says it this way that right below that is the very lair our kingdom of Satan Hell itself and then you're here caught in this realm and this light and matter in time but just above that is the sixth dimension where paradise is it's where the prophet went to and remember he said I've seen real bodies real people I was looking back at my body laying on a bed I was watching what was it he had stepped of that dimension he didn't know a million miles he didn't get on a car or our-our-our a plane and fly somewhere he literally changed the mentions and there was other people who was walking healthy without issues without problems without sickness without paying they were living real life it's just another dimension and then right above that as that seventh dimension called heaven where God dwells and what we understand through the teaching of the message is that man lives in this multi-dimensional environment and were subject to those seven dimensions around us at all times what we learn is that heaven and hell is not some million miles away but it's just across the chasm and when we die we don't go somewhere on a trip we don't get on a plane and fly off somewhere we don't get on some fast car and go and go off somewhere millions of miles away but the Prophet says when we die we just change dimensions that's it and the only thing we take all of our possessions stay in this dimension but our character comes in this dimension that's why every sermon that's preached the Holy Spirit is trying to work on your character he's trying to work on your spirit he's trying to work on your life what is it it's the only thing valuable rather you can't take that car you can't take that house you can't take that bank account but there's what else you can't take you can't take your problems you can't take your sicknesses you can't take that back pain over there you can't take those headaches that disease you can't take it over there the only thing over there is life real life's real living real joy real happiness Oh somebody say praise the Lord this morning ain't gonna take any my troubles but I'm not gonna take some million mile journey I'm just gonna change dimensions as the song says I'll speed up just a little bit and now slow down so the prophet teaches this if you're a Christian and you've been born again when you die you go to a place called the sixth dimension place of paradise where the dead in Christ await and goes back to being young again and to a celestial body waiting for the day when Christ shall come back to earth again in a rapture to pick up that body that you left behind and we literally will raise our mortal body and that theophany body and mortal body will make up one body called the glorified body well raised it in a raise from the dust of the earth to a body that's immortal and incorruptible in a glorified body one that's not limited that's the body Christ wants to get you to but if you're a sinner and you die and you missed or you didn't see the gospel of Jesus Christ and you've rejected it maybe you've never rejected it by saying I don't believe it or blaspheme dydt but you never took the opportunity or the chance to get your life wrapped up in Christ and die from your old man and be regenerated unto a new birth by the Holy Spirit by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if you die in that condition and you died without repented of your sins and never receiving Christ you go to a place called the fifth dimension there on the chart you have it that dark place that fifth dimension where the souls of the wicked are imprisoned awaiting the great white throne judgment to be judged according to the deeds done in their body brother brandon says it this way and the brothers had the quote he says no light matter and time and our five senses contact film dimensions light matter and time our sight contacts light our feeling contacts matter and so forth now he says but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building right now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact that but yet they have a tube or a crystal that picks up those ether waves and manifests them so you see right in this building this is from present stage in my ministry right in this building right now and this building is live actions of people in the air live voices they're here we know it they're absolutely the truth and the only thing you do they catch it on I don't understand the mechanics of those things that science has invented but we know that it proves to us there is a fourth dimension now the fifth dimension is where the sinner goes the fifth dimension is the kind of well the horrible dimension now this man when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth dimension and God is in the seventh dimension now then you see the Christian when he dies he goes under the altar of God right into the presence of God hallelujah under the altar and he's at rest to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and take that it shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on earth and he cannot go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood he's called my goodness he's caught he can't come back to earth because as times finished here on earth he's caught between he's in a nightmare see he can't go in the presence of God to rest he can't come back come to earth because his time's up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment a horrible thing to be in and now in this vision I believe I was called to that sixth dimension looking back down here I could see back see sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's earthly but sight is a greater thing than that the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses would contact so what is this other dimension it's another place it's another world it really exists right now the only difference is is that you don't have the tool or the crystal to tune in to be able to see with your two eyes that are the dimension but it's there all the time it's there all the time no matter what you see or what you feel or you maybe you say I can't I can't see it today but it's here right now the fourth dimension proves that it even right now there's voices there's people there's images the brother Bantam says that there's actions moving right through this room right now and if you take the right instrument it Tunes in to that other dimension and God sent a prophet who had an instrument to where he could see past what you see with your own two eyes and he could peer into another world or another dimension and then use his voice to try to describe it and use our imagination as we tried to imagine it but it's a real place Jesus dealt with this even in his ministry you notice some of these spirits the Bible says in Matthew 4:20 for his fame went throughout all Syria they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the palsy and He healed them let's turn over to mark chapter 5 quickly if you have your Bible I didn't knot it and give you this a brother so if you just want to stay right there if you have your Bible let's turn there today mark chapter 5 verse 1 that came over onto the other side of the sea end of the country of the gadarenes and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him a man immediately met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because that he had been oft bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him always day and night he was in the mountains in the tombs crying cut of himself with stones but when he saw notice who he's talking about he's not referring to Legion because Legion is the spirit the name of the demon spirits that are and that are possessing the man he's speaking about the man are you with me notice what he says he says and when he had his dwelling among the tunes and and and in verse verse 5 and always day and night he was in the mountains verse 6 but when he who he this man the man before he was possessed before he had demon spirits he was a good man he had good intentions maybe he came to church he wanted to serve God he was a good person in his heart and his core he was a good individual he didn't start off bound and the scripture says in verse 6 but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him what was it any cried with a loud voice now what happens now you see the difference between humanity and add angelic world because the man is going to worship but the Spirit is going to despise and speak against Jesus verse 7 and he cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the Most High God I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not it's almost an oxymoron in verse 60 s worshiping in verse 7 he s cursing him now this man didn't start off this way this man started off a good man bondage and chains that he had physically the chains that you could physically see they didn't start there but what started was changed in his spirit and trains in his mind as he fed on that addiction and he fed on that spirit and he fed on the wrong thing and he watched the wrong thing he said their own thing and he refused to heed the voice of God and eventually that spirit literally possessed his body he was literally possessed by a demon spirit notice what it says here do you realize that that when you become possessed by a demon spirit it's the same when you receive the Holy Ghost what is receiving the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of God literally possessing your body and you are possessed you say do we have any possessed people here today I hope we do I consider myself to be possessed I consider myself to be possessed of a Holy Spirit a spirit that literally has to possess the body and takes control of my actions and takes control of my voice and my man and what I faked and where I go and what I say why do you live the way you live because there's a spirit that is possessing you how would it be possessed come out of the man notice what he says here verse eight Jesus says come out of the man thou unclean spirit he asked him what is thy name he answered saying my name is legion for we are many he besought him that much that he would not send them away out of the country now there was nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding all the devil's besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forthwith Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea there were about two thousand how do you get to the place to where you're bound by two thousand demon spirits because you give heed to one you allow one and then another once you allow one it's just a domino effect the next and the next and the next and the next and the next and the next to where you're totally bound and you become like Legion was a social reject no one wanted to be around and he was angry all the time never knew why he had anger and wrath and he was always upset maybe it started with just a temper and he sent the wrong thing and that spirit that voice that came to him to try to correct him and said make that right you shouldn't have spoke to her that way you should - shouldn't have spoke to your children that way but pride kept him from repeating and he held that anger in that's when the Bible says don't let the Sun go down upon your wrath make it ride don't let the devil have a place but he continued to give him place and continued to feed and feed and feed on the addiction and feed on the addiction coming to church looked fine everybody thought he was a good believer no issues no problems but inwardly there's a spirit a lion that is consumed in his body consumed in mine consuming his faults consuming everything he does and he never brings it subject to the Holy Ghost say that cannot happen to me it can happen to any one of us the Bible says that he verse 14 and they that fed the swine told the city in the country and they went out into the sea where did this evil begin we got out we gotta move past this just for a moment we've got a he says where does it where does evil come from you say where did it come from man it didn't come from man when God created man God said it's good it's a good creation man is not evil within the creation of man it didn't come from nature nature is under a curse nature was originally good but where did it originate from let's find out notice Ezekiel chapter 28 turn in your Bible I didn't send this back so let's let's use our Bible today amen let's hear the rustling of those leaves this morning turning Ezekiel chapter 28 look at where excuse me we're gonna look at where evil became from where it originated from Ezekiel 28 verse 1 the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man saying to the Prince of Tyrus thus saith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God thou though thou set thine heart as the heart of God behold Thou are wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee verse 12 son of man take up a limitation upon the king of sight Tyrus saying to him thus saith the Lord God thou sittest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been and eat in the garden of God what's he talking about here every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz diamond the Beryl the Onyx the Jasper the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle gold the workmanship of that tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in the day that was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so that was upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that that was created until iniquity was found in thee that's the origination of evil and they try to figure out science and where does morals come from where does evil come from they tried to sin under experiments and research and doctors and and scientists looked at it that all they got to do is turn to Ezekiel you'll find it right here this is where it started the very beginning the seed started in Lucifer by the multitude of that merchants they have by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and now a sin therefore our caste is profaned out of the mountain of God I would destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted I wisdom by reason of that brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee Isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut to the ground which did weaken the nation's for a Taoist said in thy heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the mountain of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt here's what God says and all your boasting and all your motion that you want to boast and say I'm gonna be this and I'm gonna be that God says yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that shall see thee shall look narrow shall narrowly look upon thee and consider the saying is this you know what you're gonna do when you see the devil it's gonna go that little that little peon that little shrimp that little that little oh that's who bothered me Maya that's who I was that's who was bothering my family that's who I was so intimidated by when the doctor gave me a bad report that's who I was so nervous and fearful of the Bible says they'll look upon him narrowly saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble and that did shake the kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroy the cities thereof that opened not the house of the prisoners that's why the brother branham says he's just a bluff he's just a liar he's just a bluff Oh Satan we're here to expose you today you do you think you've been hiding long enough but God's family is gonna expose you in their lives I want to say like Jesus you have no part in me you have no part in my family you have no place in my mind hallelujah notice what it says about this man in revelations 12 verse 4 and his tell his tale the dragon this is what Satan does his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels he deceives a third part of heaven who do you think you faced every single day of your life fallen angels rebellious spirits started in hell yeah rebellious spirits started in hell that's why the Bible equates it to this sin of witchcraft are you here today yeah we better not go down that that that alley will get lost the Bible says that a third of heaven it would mean how many is that I don't know but I guess it would be millions of demon spirits that have been unleashed upon the earth millions of spirits notice what the prophet of God says here he says in the message and brothers you have this in the message proof of his resurrection now the same thing is wrong with you is wrong with that woman setting yonder noticed this the same thing wrong with you he points to a woman is the same thing wrong with that woman sitting over yonder looking right at me on the end of the road ride out there with a little round hat on there's a dark string a dark string now notice no one's seen it but a prophet was there and he looked into another dimension and there was a string going from that lady all the way over the audience attaching of this lady over here there's a dark string the lady looking across this lady's head looking at me right here with their handle that's it lady that's right here it is coming from one to the other it's evil powers pulling a dark streak yeah you realize when you're in church and you have a spirit of doubt that spirit of doubt can jump on somebody else who was not doubting before but suddenly they're afflicted without trying to hear the Word of God and it started because you gave the devil place in your mind but the very same opposite effect can happen when you start to pull on the Word of God and you start letting go of that oppression and depression somebody else that's afflicted with depression suddenly has the power to let go they don't realize it's happening in another dimension somewhere that's why it's important that we pull on the Word of God even if you don't feel like you need it today pulled for someone else and say God set him free this morning let them be free of that spirit let them free of that oppression that'll be a free of that addiction Lord but the powers of Hell be cast aside and let Christ come into the building today it's evil powers pulling a dark streak he says in darkest hour Jesus comes now here's two spirits calling one to another I only wish that my lovely audience could only be in this dimension and see this this woman standing here is suffering with the same thing that that woman sitting there with her hands cross like that here's a dark line sees it again because the spirit that's on this woman is calling to the spirit for help just like Legion why did you come to torment me why did you come to torment us what have I to do with thee Jesus son of God of the Most High what have I to do with thee Jesus what is that the man wants to worship God but the Spirit that is possessing him is resisting the Word of God in so much that he literally thinks that Jesus is there to torment him do you realize that's what Satan can do to some people who are in so much need of God they're in so much need of the Word of God to come and set them free yet they sit there with their arms crossed and folded and they think the preachers they're just a torment film or to make a mad or to pick on him when it was the opposite Jesus was there to set him free he was there to set him free of that problem don't let the devil tell you that the preaching of the word is trying to torment you are trying to pick on you it's here to set you free today it's here to break every chain in your life today he says oh I wish my lovely audience could only be in this dimension and see this this woman standing here is suffering with the same thing that woman sitting there with our hands cross right like that there's a dark line because the spirit that's on this woman is calling to this spirit for help and it's both the same disease arthritis to both and if you listen to the tape the women start screaming and God sets both of them free though only one of them came to the altar to be prayed for because a person tuned all hallelujah because there was a person who had the ability to peer into another dimension and exposed not just the spirit on this lady but to expose it in the audience and when the devil is exposed he only has one choice and that's to run for his life he only has one option when he's exposed has to call for help and go run it like a coward because that's what he is but God set them both free because God delivers and God saves and God heals you say can't he do it for me he can do it for you right now under the preaching of the word of God he could set you free in your seat right now where you sit hallelujah what if I told you that your heart trouble can be made well in Jesus name do you believe it he says to the woman on the stage do you believe it then go woman starts to walk on the stage as you hold your just a moment just a minute prophet says demons screamed what happened this woman brother Branham simply has her and the prayer line she's coming before do you believe Jesus Christ can okay then go ahead the woman starts to walk off the stage brother Branham starts to go to another person says hold on hold on just a minute a demon just screamed you believe it he says demons scream something called for help demon power it come from the audience when this woman was healed that demon spirit screaming to one for help it's the spiritual world we're not talking about the outside it's the spiritual friends they're just as real as your real and I see them many times when they leave I've seen them leave right from this platform I've seen them some of them in the shape of bats looked like long hairs hanging on their legs but when you came up here and you watched that person come and get prayed for and they raised their hands and the preacher bowed down and kneeled down and prayed with him you didn't see anything but in another world Satan has been defeated that person has been set free and that spirits looking and calling for help and running for his life looked like a little hairs hanging out but an epileptic demon looks like a tortoise with round legs hanging up like that usually but usually a demon of oppression seems to be more of a cloud form like a wave and it just makes a real funny sound when you're in that other dimension to see the spirit you see how important it is to have discernment of that dimension if I can get you accomplish one thing here today it'll be this to make you understand this is a real world these are real demon spirits that can really possess you and attack you and it's important more than ever before that we realize that we need to have our senses exercised to discern both good and evil to be mature Christians to understand we're not dealing with flesh and blood here we're dealing with spiritual wickedness in high places you may think that's wrong but some of these days you'll realize if you could only take a spiritual looking-glass and look into your soul you'd out and you'd find out what it looks like and the greatest devil the chief of all Devils [Applause] [Music] that's gotta be pornography er or murder rape molestation er some kind of horrible no prophet says the chief of all Devils is unbelief the chief the captain the chief the leader the main one the main the biggest the greatest is unbelief why do you think more than and more than any other spirit that we face at the closing scenes of history is Satan trying to get people to disbelieve the Word of God because he's the chief of all Devils and he affects you he affects me affects our children he affects our family trying to get us to doubt the Word of God are you hear this today and these angels that afflict and Satan's scheme has been thoroughly written about in the scripture his plan and his blueprint more than ever before he's attacking like a roaring lion the scripture calls him a roaring lion our adversary is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour you say brother Matt what does the demons want to do what is their purpose do they have a purpose they do a demon spirit wants to deceive you into until you're thinking it's so crooked and you look at things so backwards until you can't see straight until you can't see the truth the demon spirit wants to delude your mind from what's right and twist you and destroy you either physically mentally emotionally or socially person would you Satan wants more than ever before to make you a hermit to go into here for and no more you think fellowship is not important you're mistaken thank you could just come to a church and go home and be with your family and don't have anything to do with anybody anywhere there's a spirit trying to lead you there's a spirit trying to do that to you trying to separate you from everybody else he wants to make you like Legion to push you away from society Legion literally live by himself couldn't be around anybody or he'll destroy you if he can't get you that way he'll destroy you spiritually the scripture talks about this leader of the demons the person that we call the devil we call him the devil generic name just the devil that was just a devil the devil made me do it well the scripture gives this devil five names and twenty four titles in just the New Testament alone this powerful angel what the scripture calls him the anointed cherub the anointed cherub means he was closest to the throne of God so you can be closest to the throne of God and still rebelled the scripture calls him in the Bible here's his name's Satan Abaddon in Greek that a bad a name means apollyon means destroyer another name given to him is Beelzebub another name given in the Bible is Belial and in another place they call him Lucifer there is nothing sweet or tender or kind about any of those names did you just feel a sweet spirit when I say that Lucifer oh just melts my heart just does something to me Beelzebub but what about when I say Jesus [Applause] emanuelle does it do something to you give us fill that gentle spirit Jesus that's why it's important to say his name he shall be called Prince of Peace he's called everlasting father he's called son of the morning he's called the lily of the valley oh I love him don't you he's typed as different animals in the scripture in the Bible the Bible refers to him as a serpent a snake in the grass a red dragon cruel and powerful he's described in the New Testament as a prowling lion do you realize when you go out of church today and you walk out those doors there's a prowling lion following behind you let me ask you if you've turned on the news today and Happy Valley Elizabeth and whatever your newspaper is or however you follow your news here and there was a picture of a lion prowling the streets of Elizabethton and I couldn't find it and the news article was a lion on the loose how many of y'all would be going downtown to Elizabeth's in today with your children and your families and if you were forced to go in public would you just be sort of just walking around casually not really care if you're watching or looking no but do you realize this is the reality that the scripture gives you that in this atmosphere in this dimension there's a prowling lion on the loose trying to devour you that's why Paul said put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand the wiles of the devil [Applause] it's called the ruler of this world the Prince of this world Jesus calls him the god of this world you know he's the only person Jesus ever called God it's out of his father the god of this evil age we'd like to look at something today and it's gonna this it's gonna be lengthy brothers if you'll go ahead and pull up that article felt led to read this I want you to look at one of the schemes of the devil just as we close just give me can I have just about 15 20 more minutes I want you to look at just some of the sudden this article that I found believe the Lord led me to it and I read it to our church and it's good it's gonna be it's gonna be quite shock you know I don't think I'll have any trouble keeping anyone's attention and you'll see why when we begin to read it but the scripture says we're not ignorant of his devices is that what your Bible says I want you to read from this children psychologist today as he wrote this article called the undoing of families and the social medias attack an assault on young people he says here my practice is a child adolescent psychologist is filled with families like Kellis these parents say their kids extreme overuse of phones video games social media is the most difficult pairing issue they face and in many cases it's tearing families apart preteen and teen girls refuse to get off their phones even though it's remarkably clear the devices are making them miserable I also see far too many boys there's gaming obsessions lead them to forego interest in school extracurricular activities than anything else productive some of these boys as they reach our later teens use their large bodies to terrorize parents who attempt to set gaming limits common thread running through many of these cases is parent Gilda's as so many are certain they did something to put their kids on a destructive path now listen close hear what none of these parents understand is that their children's and teens obstructive obsession with technology is the predictable consequence of a virtually unrecognized merger between the tech industry and psychology this alliance pairs the consumer the consumer tech industry's immense wealth with the most sophisticated psychological research making it possible to develop social media video games and phones with drug-like powers to seduce young users these parents have no idea that lurking behind their kids screens and phones are a multitude of psychologists neuroscientist and social science expect spurts who use their knowledge of psychological vulnerabilities to devise products that capture kids attentions for the sake of Industry profit what these parents and most of the world have yet to grasp is that psychology a discipline that we associate with healing is now being used as a weapon against children nestled in an unremarkable building on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto California is the Stanford persuasive technology lab notice the word persuasive technology founded in 1998 the labs creator dr. BJ Fogg is a psychologist and the father of persuasive technology a discipline in which digital media and apps including smartphones social media and video games are configured to alter human thoughts and behaviors as the labs website boldly proclaimed machines designed to change humans Fogg speaks openly of the ability to use smartphones and other digital devices to change your ideas and actions quote we can now create machines that can change what people think and what people do and the machines can do that autonomously called the millionaire maker Fogg this man has groomed former students who have used his methods to develop technologies that now consume kids lives as he recently touted on his personal website my students often do groundbreaking projects and they continue having impact in the real world after they leave Stanford for example Instagram has influenced the behavior of over 800 million people and the co-founder was a student of mine intriguingly there are signs that fog is filling the heat from recents currenty the use of digital devices alter behavior his boast about instagram was president as web says lays of January 2018 has been removed Falls web fogs website also has lately undergone a substantial makeover as he now seems to go out of his way to suggest his work has benevolent aims move on down brother just just to the slide later while fog emphasizes persuasive designs sunny future he is quite indifferent to the disturbing reality now that hidden influence techniques are being used by the tech industry to hook and exploit users for profit his enthusiastic vision also conveniently neglects to include how this generation of children and teams with their highly malleable minds is being manipulated and hurt by unseen forces he calls the section weaponizing persuasion if you haven't heard of persuasive technology that's no accident tech corporations would prefer it to remain in the shadows as most of us don't want to be controlled and have a special aversion to kids being manipulated for profit persuasive technology also called persuasive design works by deliberately creating digital environments that users feel fulfill their basic human drives to be social or to obtain goals betters and real-world alternatives kids spend countless hours in social media and video game environments in pursuit of likes friends game points levels because it's stimulating they believe this makes them happy and successful and they find it easier than doing the difficult but developmentally important activities of childhood while persuasion techniques work well on adults they are particularly effective at influencing the still maturing child and teen brain video games better than anything in our culture deliver rewards to people especially teenage boys says Fogg teenage boys are wired to seek competency to master our world and get better at stuff video games and dishing out rewards can convey to people that their competency is growing you can get better at something second-by-second I'm just I'm just leveling up just got to get to the next level you think it's an accident it's not and it's persuasive design that's helped convince this generation of boys they are gaining competency by spending countless hours on game sites when the sad reality is that they're actually just locked away in their rooms gaming ignoring school and not developing the real-world competencies that colleges and employers demand now this man only sees this from a psychologist view I want you to put on your spiritual thinking caps this morning and see the spiritual implications of this likewise social media companies use persuasive designed to prey on the age-appropriate desire for preteens and team kid 's especially girls to be socially successful this drive is built into our DNA since real world relational skills have fostered human evolution the Huffington Post article what really happens on a teen girls phone describes the life of 14-year old Casey from Millburn New Jersey with 580 friends on Instagram and 1110 on Facebook she's preoccupied with the number of likes her facebook profile picture receives compared with her peers as she says if you don't get 100 lights you make other people share it so you get 100 or else you get upset everyone wants to get the most likes it's like a popularity contest article author Bianca Bhaskar says that there are costs to Casey's phone obsession noting that the girl's phone be it on Facebook Instagram or iMessage is constantly pulling her away from her work sleep conversations with her family Casey says she wishes she could put her phone down but she can't I wake up in the morning and go on Facebook just because no it's not just because it's because there was a there's a psychologist and neuroscience who has designed something you think you're just looking in a screen what you don't see behind that app is an addiction happening it's not like I want to or don't I just go on and I'm like forced to I don't know why I need to Facebook takes up my whole life BJ Fogg may not be a household name but Fortune magazine calls him the new guru you should know and his research is driving a worldwide legion of user experience UX designers who utilize and expand upon his models of persuasive design as Forbes magazine writer Anthony week Auster notes no one has perhaps been as influential on the current generation of user experience designers as Stanford researcher BJ Fogg UX designers come from many disciplines including psychology as well as brain and computer sciences however the core of some UX research is about using psychology to take advantage of our human vulnerabilities that's particularly pernicious when the targets are children as Fogg is quoted in Koster's Forbes article Facebook Twitter Google you name it these companies have been using computers to influence our behavior however the driving force behind behavior change is a computer the missing link isn't technology it's psychology says Fogg UX researchers not only often follows Foggs model but some may also share his apparent tendency to overlook the broader implications of persuasive design they focus on the task at hand building digital machines and apps the better demand users attention compel users to return again and again and grow business bottom lines let it less considered can be how the world's children are affected by thousands of UX designers working simultaneously to pull them onto a multitude of digital devices and products at the expense of real life according to BJ fog the fog behavioral motto is a well tested method to change behavior and in its simplified form involves three primary factors motivation ability and triggers describing how his formula is effective at getting people to use social network the psychologist says in an academic paper that a key motivator is users desire for social acceptance although he says an even more powerful motivator is the desire to avoid being socially rejected regarding the ability Foggs suggests the digital product should be made so that users don't have to think hard hence social networks are designed for ease of use finally Fogg says that potential users need to be triggered to use a site this is accomplished by a myriad of digital tricks including the sending of incessant notifications urging users to view friends pictures and connect your app out to our notice what he's trying to do they're always notifications you ever notice your phone look at my phone today I got one two three four five six seven eight just on my phone right now you know what that causes it causes an autopilot till when I get done preach and I get done praying and I get back to my car and start managing the first thing I do [Applause] [Music] telling them that they're missing out that's what it's trying to do to tell you're missing you're missing you're missing the university better get to it some people can't even avoid it in church preachers preach and phone vibrates a man brother you preach it telling them they're missing out while not on the social network are suggesting that they check yet again to see if anyone liked their post or photo fogs formula is the blueprint for building multi-billion dollar did multi-billion dollar social media and gaming companies however moral questions about the impact of turning persuasive techniques on children and teens are not being asked for example should the fear of social rejection be used to compel kids to compulsively use social media is it okay to lure kids away from school tasks that demand a strong mental effort so they can spend their lives on social networks or playing video games that don't make them much at all and is it okay to incessantly trigger kids to use revenue producing digital products at the expense of engaging with family and other real important life activities prophet of God prophesied said the families in trouble you know why the church is in trouble you know why the church is in trouble because the family's in trouble and the church is made up of the families and the families are made up of how much value you have one with another he says daddies are at the at the ball at they at the pool hall Mama's at the stitch and so Johnny's driving his hot rod the family's in trouble separated are you with me persuasive technologies worked because of their apparent triggering of the release of dopamine notice a powerful neurotransmitter involved in reward attention and addiction in the Venice region of Los Angeles now dubbed silicon beach the start up dopamine labs boast about its use of persuasive techniques to increase profits connect your app to our persuasive AI and lift your engagement and revenue up 30% by giving your users are perfect burst of dopamine a burst of dopamine doesn't just feel good it's proven to rewire user behavior and habits Ramsey Braun the founder of dopamine labs says in a KQED science article we have now developed a rigorous technology of the human mind and that is both exciting and terrifying we have the ability to twiddle some knobs in a machine learning dashboard we build and around the world hundreds of thousands of people are going to quietly change their behavior in ways that unbeknownst to them feel second nature but are really by design programmers call this brain as it compels users to spend more time on sites even though they mistakenly believe it strictly due to their own conscious choice social networks and video games should I yell him to stop should I stop same response I got from my church they said no don't stop keep reading why because it hits home you know what I'm doing right now I'm hitting a funny bone you know you hit your funny bone and get your attention don't it it makes you realize how wrapped up we are in the world wide web how wrapped up and wrapped up Satan wants to wrap our families on social networks and video games use this use the trusted brain manipulation techniques a variable reward think slot machine users never know when they will get the next light or game reward and it's delivered at the perfect time to foster maximal stimulation and keep them on that site banks of computers employee AI to learn which of a countless number of persuasive design elements will keep users hooked a persuasive persuasion profile of a particular users unique vulnerabilities is developed in real time and exploited to keep users on the site and make them return again and again for longer periods of time this drives up profits for consumer and Internet companies whose revenue is based on how much their products are used clandestine techniques that manipulate users to fulfill a profit motive are regarded by programmers as dark design why would researchers why would firms resort to such tactics as former tech executive bill David L says it is Atlantic article exploiting the neuroscience of Internet addiction the leaders of Internet companies face an interesting if also morally questionable imperative either they hijack neuroscience to gain market share and make large profits or they let competitors do that and run away with the market there are a few industries is cutthroat and unregulated as Silicon Valley social media and video game companies believe they are compelled to use persuasive technology and the in the arms race for attention profits in survival children's well-being is not part of the decisions cupcakes while social media and video game companies have been surprisingly successful at hiding their use of persuasive design from the public one breakthrough occurred in 2017 when Facebook documents were leaked to the Australian the internal report crafted by Facebook executives showed the social network boasting to advertisers that by monitoring post interactions and photos in real time the network is able to track when teens feel insecure worthless stressed useless and a failure why would the social network do this the report also bragged about Facebook's ability to micro-target ads down to the moments when young people need a confidence boost and these neuroscientists and psychologists think that they're so intelligent and so smart what they don't see is that in another dimension there's a smart devil and smart demons who is anointing their minds and hands and ideas when they write ideas on paper who do you think is the master of targeting and micro targeting temptations just at the right time that temptation that lures you comes at the very right moment [Music] persuasive technology the use of digital meat I'm almost done Digital Media to target children deploying the weapon of psychological manipulation of just the right moment is what makes it so powerful these design techniques provide tech corporations a window into kids hearts and minds to measure their particular vulnerabilities which can then be used to control their behavior as consumers this isn't some strange future this is now Facebook claimed the leaked report was misrepresented in the press but when child advocates called on the social networking to release it company refused to do so preferring to keep the techniques that uses to influence kids shrouded in secrecy the official tech industry's line is that persuasive technology or technologies are used to make products more engaging and enjoyable but the revelations of industry insiders can reveal darker motives video game developer John Hobson who has a PhD in behavioral and brain science wrote the paper paper behavioral game design he describes the use of design features to alter video game player behavior sounding much like an experiment an experiment or running lab animals through their paces answering questions such as how do we make players maintain a high consistent rate of activity and how to make players play forever now one of the most popular video games that's being played right now on xbox in place pramatta uprichard against video games I mean that's not what I'm doing here today do you think I am you've missed it sorry if you got excited and you have some against video games and you thought I was I'm sorry to disappoint you it's not what I'm doing trying to get you to have dimensional discernment one of the most popular video games that has kids are playing right now the graphics they used to think it was all about graphics get it more real and more real or more real the most popular video game being played right now won't even give it a mention but you teenagers know what I'm talking about graphics aren't even that special graphics really aren't that great but yet people want to play it more than ever before because there's a neuroscience there's that there's an addiction of persuasion to get you to perform and you're getting better and you're getting better and you're getting better oh I'll read it from down here if I need to I'll bring my laptop down here no one will have to see my face these video game developers are asking how do we make players play forever revealing the hard science behind persuasive technology Hobson says this is not to say that players are the same as rats but that there are general rules of learning which apply equally to both after pinning the paper Hobson was hired by Microsoft where he helped lead the development of the Xbox LIVE Microsoft's online gaming system he also assisted in the development of Xbox game Xbox games popular with kids including these in the Halo series the parents I work with simply have no idea about the immense amount of financial and psychological firepower aimed at their children to keep them playing video games forever that's why you don't just give your child a video game and say just get whatever you won't play anything you want I really don't care do you really not care do you really really do you really not care two parents not care anymore do you realize you're releasing that child to let them shut their door and lock them self away and they're in a room with psychologists and neuroscientists and perverted minds of with demon spirits hallelujah and they're trying to destroy everything you're trying to build they're trying to tear everything you try to do down hallelujah you okay he says here the officials Peck tech line official tech industries lines the persuasive technologies are used let me let me find my place again where I was he says that the parents I work with simply have no idea the immense amount of financial psychological firepower aimed at their children to keep them playing video games forever another persuasive technology expert is bill Fulton a game designer who training who's training cognitive and quantitative psychology he started Microsoft's games user research group before founding his own consulting agency phone is a transparent troponin is transparent about the power of persuasive design and the intent of the game in industry disclosing and big four accounting firms Pete PwC's tech business journal if game designers are going to pull a person away from every other voluntary social activity or hobby or pastime they're going to have to engage that person at a very deep level in every possible way they can this is a major effect of persuasive design today building video games and social media products so compelling that they pull users away from the world world to spend their lives in for-profit domains but to engage in a pursuit at the expense of important real world activities is a core element of addiction and there is increasing evidence that persuasive design has now become so potent that it is capable of contributing to video game and Internet addiction diagnoses that are officially recognized in China South Korea and Japan and which are now under consideration in the unite an addiction to the Internet an addiction to video games you think you're not living in Satan's Eden you are not only dis persuasive design appear to drive kids addictions to devices but knowledge of addiction is used to make persuasive design more effective at hijacking the mind as dopamine labs Ramsey Brown acknowledges in the episode of CBS's 60 minutes since we figured to some extent how these pieces of the brain that handle addiction are working people have figured out how to juice them further and how to bake that information into apps the creation of digital products with drug like effects that are able to pull a person away from engaging in real-life activities and is the reason why persuasive technology is profoundly destructive today persuasive design is like distracting adults from driving safely productive work and engaging with our own children all matters which need an urgent attention still because the child and adolescent brain is more easily controlled than the adult mind the use of persuasive design is having a much more hurtful impact on kids persuasive technologies are reshaping childhood luring kids away from family social work schoolwork and spend more time more and more of their lives sitting before screens and phones according to the Kaiser Family Foundation report younger u.s. children now spend five and a half hours each day with entertainment technologies including video games social media and online videos even more the average teen now spends an incredible eight hours a day playing with screens and phones products productive uses of technology were persuasive design is much less a factor are almost an afterthought as US kids only spend 16 minutes each day using the computer for home or school how much time did they spend reading their Bible how much time do they spent at the family altar how much time did they spend and listening to the message and we wonder why we're losing our kids we blame it on the pastor and we blame it on the preacher and we blame it on the message told man we're in some deep water yeah really hits home donut the combined effects of the displacement of vital childhood activities and exposure to unhealthy online environment this is the very last one that I sent you brother a wired generation falling apart one of the last ones the combined effects of disk of the displacement of vital childhood activities and exposure to unhealthy online environments is wrecking a generation in her recent Atlantic article have smartphones destroying a generation dr. Jean twinge a professor of psychology at San Diego University describes how long hours spent on smartphones and social media are driving teen girls in the u.s. to experience high rates of depression and suicidal behavior you say for the matter you preaching against videogames not what I'm doing you preach it against phones and obviously not what I'm doing guilty if that's what I'm doing I'm trying to get you to understand that there's another dimension and that there's another world and us as believers more than ever before need to have our senses exercised to discern another dimension to realize that there are certain conditions we can create in our home that invite the wrong spirit there are certain things we can watch in our home that invite the wrong spirit there are certain places that we can go that invite the wrong spirit there are certain things we can play and watch and and take part of and have on our phones that invite the wrong spirit but there's the right things you can place before your children and before their eyes that create the right spirit I want to create the right spirit in my home I want to say God let me be let me discern that there's another dimension and there's a Holy Ghost that can really influence my children and influence my family and influence their decision it's called the Tolkien and I can apply it to my home in so much that it affects the very minds of my children the influences of their behavior I want them to be influenced from above how many people here today want to say Lord let me be influenced from above let me discern another dimension where you can influence my behavior you can change my behavior your word you know what this word does it's persuasive design it persuades you to live right it persuades you to talk right it persuades you to go right it persuades you to live right why because it's designed to give you strength it's designed to give you faith it's designed to give you hope if you just feed upon it today o stand to your feet and rejoice this morning hallelujah o glory to God praise You Lord Jesus hallelujah simmer the map what I want to get questions and emails after I leave here what are we trying to do we're trying to get you to understand there's a real world and he wants your mind those demon spirits want to wreck you and twist you spiritually physically emotionally anoint you

discernment let me understand I'm not wrestling against flesh and blood addictions that happen in my family or my life or my children or my loved ones that's not a flesh and blood problem it's a spiritual wickedness in high places that's why we preach against how yes why we preach how you address because it carries spirits so why we preach on what kind of music you listen to because it carries spirits rap music is not created to give you joy it's not created to give you love country music has not given made to make you more happy rock and roll music is not it's not there to make you joy to make you joyful or happy is there to anoint you with the wrong spirit to lead you down a path of self-destruction there's the right condition in their own condition I want to create the right atmosphere I'll bow your heads with me this morning every head bowed just play something for me if you could we are not ignorant the scripture says of his devices how many want to say here maybe

brother Adam said he thought that way just go live with the Indians then he found out there was bad Indians - it's bad no evil no matter where you go it's the flesh and blood the phone is not the
