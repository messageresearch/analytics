wow look at that let's power us together heavenly father life to us is still such a great mystery how it can be that a man and woman can fall in love and their dna be able to mix together and produce such a wonderful wonderful thing as a child we're so grateful our brother and sister that they desire lord jesus to be able to bring up a child in the admonition of the lord when many are brought in this day lord they're raised by babysitters the raids by all sorts of other alternatives father i pray that you would bless my brother and sister and help them lord that they can be able to instill in their daughter the ways of life the ways of truth lord god they want to bring her back to you today to be able to offer her little life to you i pray father that you just take her life keeper what an

like this and realize that when you were here they brought little children to you so that you might be able to just touch them and bless them father we know that we've been given a responsibility as your church as your people to be able to take our children oh jesus if you was here today how happy these moms and dads would be to bring their little children to you and lay them in your arms you're not visibly here but yet your presence is here so we can bring our children into your great courts father we just pray that you would help them we know that really it's more than dedicating a baby but it's a mother and father accepting that awesome responsibility of being able to be a mirror of the grace and the mercy of god to be able to find grace when they needed and disciplined when they needed it's such a balance lord i pray that you should help them help my sister to be able to reflect dear god what a godly mother is my brother a godly father to be able to instill in their little son dear

old enough to be able to accept you may his heart be tender toward you lord we dedicate his life to you in jesus christ can we stand together we welcome you today in the name of the lord jesus what's a great privilege for us to gather together in it in the house of the lord certainly thank god for his mercy to each of our hearts genesis chapter 1 verse 26 we've been speaking about reconciliation through kenosis canosis being the emptying out the changing of almighty god from something which could not be understood or comprehended to a form that would be an act of such humiliation yet be able to relate to his people we want to look here at god making the first man this morning and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness now those of you that went to school very far know that us means more than one there's only one god and there's only one image notice let us make man in our not images but image so what is it spirit and word because god ain't two and god ain't three and god ain't four but hero israel the lord our god is one and god said let us spirit and word make man in our plural image singular what kind of god then are we serving what kind of god are we talking about we're talking about a god that reveals himself in three offices the same way that you revealed after our likeness again not plural likenesses so there wasn't an old man there and then a young man called jesus and god said and i'll tell you what let let us make ma'am to look like both of us i'll give him my eyes and and your nose jesus and he can have my ears and he can have your hands jesus god only had one image and that was christ after our likeness let them now here we go to a real plurality let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the earth and over everything that every creeping thing that creep us upon the earth so god created man in his own image again one image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them wow so god made one man after the image of us and then he made an us after the image and that one god so here was a man that was plural too male and female created he them in what image the image of god verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and still yet just in one image what was it spirit form and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over every living thing that move us upon the earth notice this now whenever we come to genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life so the man in genesis 1 26 was one man now we go to genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed man out of the dust of the ground well where was that other guy i thought god had already made man in his own image but you see this man is not in the image of god he's made to the dust to the ground and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living yehesh which is soul animated being became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man man never actually came from the dust of the garden of eden but from the dust outside the garden then he was brought into the garden and there he put the man whom he had formed i mean like to be remembered today as we go before the lord heavenly father we love you so much we are so grateful to know that the very same god who brought our earthly father adam on the earth is the same one that's bringing us today back into your great paradise father we pray that you would help us today as we've assembled lord not just as a protractive gathering not because we didn't have some other place we could go we could have we could have went here and there but we chose to come here we ask you lord that you would meet with us as you said in your word that you would we know your way of meeting with us can vary from service to service based upon our needs based upon the things that each of us come today with requests and desires in our hearts so we're laying them before you and we by no means would try to tell you how to do this or that or the other so what we're asking is that you would just have your way and if you will have your way it will be perfect help me lord that i can get out of the way lord god may you be able to use that part of yourself that you placed in me shut my mouth to anything that would be displeasing to you lord open the ears and the hearts of your children speak to us your great words it's in the name of the lord jesus we ask it and the saints said amen god bless you you may be seed in our minds we can only imagine what it must have been whenever father decided to expand his creation he had already created the universe and millions billions of stars the expanse of the universe to this day still going on and science still seeing more and more as they're able to put their instruments out farther and make better instruments but of all the things that he had made none of them was his crowning achievement like man was and yet he chose not to make man first but he chose to make man in this final stage of his creation the angels of god must have stood around him that day as they saw the father's handiwork and they looked to see something breaking from the logos because we know that the creation was actually coming into view by the visible presence of god which was christ the logos it was the pre-existent stage before he became known to us as jesus the man but it was god had already given birth himself to what the prophet called a son and a son was something that came out of the invisible one and we know that the bible tells us that he is the invisible god and he was the firstborn the lord jesus became the firstborn then of every creature so the invisible wanted to become visible the intangible wanted to become tangible that which had no molecular structure no atoms no time no molecules but he wanted to be something that could be touched and felt and spoken to and he wanted to be able to touch back he wanted to be able to look at people and people to look at him but without a change in him that would be totally impossible since jesus says in saint john 4 that god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth right in this building today are many many spirits they are not so much inside these four walls as they are inside of another realm or another dimension there could be thousands times thousands of angels and demons gathering around us in this little small gathering of people and yet it would be unseen to our eyes we might feel from time to time an impulse or an influence on our being a strange peculiar something whether it's righteousness or evil that would come against us and we don't see it and we cannot touch it but yet it's it's an influence and we know that that's the way demons work and that's the way angels work but yet all around us basically what we know is light matter time science we believe by faith there is a place that the unbeliever goes when they die and that the believer goes when they die but yet we've never been there so we really don't know what it's like people have died they say and went there and came back and told us various things that they saw so it is a realm that remains a mystery to us for sure but the lord wanted to expand himself into this realm that he was bringing everything else if you were the eternal you could actually become no greater than what you were you couldn't become any wider any taller any more vast in your understanding or your wisdom but the only way to really make yourself known greater would be in the act of condensation which is very hard for us because we think greater is bigger smarter more educated so we expand our boundaries and many times that means walking on others to do it it doesn't matter who we hurt or none of that just as long as we get bigger and we get greater and so on and so on but that's not the way that he wanted to be so in order to become greater an expression i could never become greater than what he already was but reach greatness by expression through smallness now listen this is more than the human mind can comprehend and process because as i said we think greater is us being bigger and we want to make our business bigger and greater and expand and go on and on make more money which revolves involves making you know taking more time away from uh many times important things in our life but bigger that's the way bigger and greater and expanding is but that's not the way god thought about it in order for the eternal to become in greater expression of himself he had to do it through the act of condescension so he must by the act of creation create something that would allow him to come into a lower form you see already we don't like that to become lower to become greater that makes no existence it makes no sense to us but we have never existed in the realm of eternity when the eternal was everything there was so you could not go beyond it you could not be greater there's no expanse greater than he himself but he wanted to do this through the act of condescension so he began the kenosis actually before there was ever a world that was ever visible and that was out of the being of the eternal come let's say like this was like a little white light and that little white light began to play as it were around the father's door and it was something that was of the eternal yet an act of condescension by creation that he expanded something jesus said that he came forth and proceeded from god so he was not a little boy there in heaven he was not another man there in heaven and god was you know thousands of years old jesus was about 30 something years old no jesus was not a boy in heaven he was the logos but remember that god had all of these attributes in his being and he wanted to express them but the way he chose to express him was not by the act of creation around you see how do you went straight to the book of the lamb's book of life i'm gonna have only brought into existence those attributes which was in the lamb's book then many many millions of people that will be there through the grace version of the way he chose would have never been there had he only chose the lamb's book of life so god before the foundation of the world made two books one would be the lamb's book and the other one would be the book of life so god's mercy is so great that it's goes beyond the jews right and he believes the jews are the chosen people they were that's right but and yet the grace of god even goes beyond his bride and it goes to a group that will show up in the book of revelation that these are they which came out of great tribulation and they have washed the robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb these are they that have the ability as a mortal to choose eternal life now they don't have it here in this life but they have the ability to choose and their name is not blotted out of the book of life so the grace of god went to the lamb's book but it also spilled over if i consent that way over into the book of life now in the book of life your chances of your name being removed and remaining are entirely up to you you see those whose names are in the lamb's book of life are placed there before the foundation of the world they are written indelibly by the blood of the lord jesus they were called by the eternal before the world ever began they cannot be removed a bit more than his name which was the first and the top of the book but there are those in the book of life which can be removed and if people turn down god's word and refuse what god sends to them then it will be removed but those who choose to have their name remaining in the book they accept the lord jesus as their savior and they walk in whatever portion of light that god gives to them then they're able to maintain that now whenever we go back then to this man that was formed in genesis 1 26 i want you to notice how that moses when he frames this and he wants to bring god into the compound revelation of god's character when it comes to genesis 2. in genesis 1 the bible says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of god now those words are in the hebrew rock elohim ruach elohim and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and you know the rest of the story but notice when we come to chapter 2 that moses does not choose the name ruach elohim but he chooses the name lord god now this is the first time that the compound redemptive name of god is chosen to be revealed and it's revealed in the act of creation when it comes to his children so moses did not say god formed man he did not say the spirit of god rurak elohim now the words are are like an eagle so the spirit was coming upon this great thing that he made and he took his wings this is the hebrew meaning of that word that he took his wings and he began to flutter over the earth so ruach elohim began to flutter over the earth and bring creation into view but whenever he went to make this man he did not choose the attribute of rurak elohim but he chose adonai elohim or jehovah lord god so it is the compound redemptive name of god that is revealed when god is expressing what his attribute of sonship notice this in genesis 2 7 and the lord god formed the lord god formed now this is a different word than the genesis the word in genesis 1 26 when the scripture said that he created him that was my spoken word but this is formed it is a word that would be used as a potter that would take the elements of clay and he would start forming and putting together in a shape or a mole now in this sense it was more of a free-handed work it was not that he had a mole there and a shape and he poured the pliable clay inside of that but he took as it were his hands and his fingers and he started molding and forming as you and i did whenever we were children and we would take play-doh or clay or red mud or whatever it was that you used to play with and you would take that and you'd start making and shaping and molding so here the lord god began to form this man and i want you to notice how moses writes this and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground so he actually does not take a manic or a shovel or something like that and go beyond the dust and then down into the top soil and then down into the layers of the stratus of the clay but he actually scoops up right off the top of the earth and he begins to gather together the dust and he makes man a forms man of the dust of the ground now what's this word i'm not sure if you're familiar with it or not but the word man actually in hebrew is adam or the english word is adam so the word man means adam now watch what he does so it is mankind you can see the hebrew word there mankind adam or the first man so the lord god formed adam or the first man out of the dust of the ground now look at this word adomah so here is the man and the word adam actually means red so the man was actually taken from the dust of the ground his name originates with the very place where he come from so where was this other man of genesis 1 26 that the bible said and god made them male and female where was this man at when this man was being formed now he was there in a spirit realm right god had already made him now the man in genesis 1 26 is not a future unveiling that god is actually going to wait till the man of genesis 2 7 is made and then further enveloped that word but this man was already there in existence before the man of genesis 2 7. now if you look at that carefully you'll find yourself so watch then god actually forms adam from the dust of adam on and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul so then the spirit man is now breathed into mammal for adam this adam was a mammal a warm blooded animal the height of animal life now in that so god merged a spirit image into a natural body just like we have today and god makes this man and he gives him dominion over the fish of the sea follow the air over everything that he had and god also of course makes known to the man the lamb's book of life now god in the beginning had adam and eve stayed in their place and at this place of course she was still in him her identity had not yet been separated but god knew that what the woman would do once she separated her from adam as long as she was in adam she could never fall but to further express his attributes the fall was necessary but he couldn't make them fall and then save them and raise them up and be just so he could put them on a basis of what we identify as pre-moral agency adam did not choose to become a son of god he was made that [Applause] [Music] but he chose whether to continue to walk with god or not he did not choose well do i want to be a son of the devil or do i want to be a son of god that was not the choice that adam made it was to be in fellowship with god or listen to the lie of the enemy now i wonder what happens then whenever people are born again now when we come from here let us skip over and we'll pick up in john chapter 3 and we find a educated well-scholared well-versed hebrew which my new the law no doubt and with great anticipation had waited for years and years for the kingdom of god to come to the earth as a man which had a background under the great teachers of the day no daddy had an opinion and a view of what the messiah would be so he hears of this guy from nazareth and he follows him a little bit and he starts seeing the things that are transpiring and this man decides to make a visit to the lord jesus his name is nicodemus he comes to the lord and jesus goes to setting force the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven he didn't come right out and tell him where it would be like reading a newspaper but he veiled it in scriptural terms so he speaks these words to this man you must be born again other man looks at him and said born again how can a man when he's old enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born again and jesus still does not come real plain with it but he says the wind blows where it will and you don't know where it comes or where it goes so is everyone that's born of the spirit you might just said thanks that really helped me that was really informative wow jesus never did actually break down the mystery of the new birth to this man did he show me well when you come on over and paul the apostle is able to catch by revelation and simplify much more of what god was wanting to achieve by the new birth you know that god had after this man in genesis 1 was breathed into the visible image in genesis 2 and further on of course in chapter 3 the man falls so there's a man in genesis 1. there's a man in genesis 2 and there's a prophetic man in genesis 3. now that man in genesis 3 was prophesied by god himself whenever he spoke that there would be a serpent bruiser that would come and bruise the serpent's head and he called him a hymn not a woman but a him so the man of genesis 3 is going to merge the man of genesis 1 back into the man of genesis 2 because whenever the man fell in genesis 3 then that spirit image which was breathed into him the man of genesis 1 left him now there again it's hard for us to comprehend because we was not there but adam actually sinned and fell he had the same color hair same color eyes he didn't gain no weight he didn't lose no weight all of that he looked exactly the same but something left him and what was it it was that spirit image of genesis 1 which could not fall now there was something that god breathed into him now you've heard me say it many times before and other men of well as well of course but i'm not sure exactly what adam did have in the garden of eden but whatever he had he lost whatever he had he fell from and what you and i have got if we've got the holy ghost you can't never fall from it so whatever we've got brother jack actually takes us further back than adam had in that sense in the garden of eden and the church said now if you were sealed by the holy spirit according to ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed to the day of your redemption so according to peter if you do these things ye shall never fall so there is this token of security that puts the real believers so far back into christ that they can never never fall from that state in the presence of god so apparently the man of genesis 3 which was the lord jesus as we know him now the fulfillment of the serpent bruiser emmanuel and all of that has actually been able to through the power of negotiation and reconciliation he's been able to negotiate with whom himself and bring his own blood and pay the price now remember isaiah prophesied about him and said that he would bruise him it would please the spirit god to bruise him and he would make his soul an offering now what a peculiar thing a soul for an offering i thought the blood was the offering i thought that it was an animal life not in the new covenant it is not the blood of an animal that we're saved by it is not by do's and don'ts it is the soul of an innocent one that saved us why is god focusing on the soul now what is the soul well the soul is the nature of your spirit so there was something then about adam's soul that departed out of his body now we know according to the blasphemous names 1962 prophet said whenever he breathed into adam's nostrils he became an eternal person with god so god actually breathed into this animal body called adam he breathed into him on a deposit of a great reflection of the eternal how in the world did adam ever die then at the age of 930 years old unless there was something that left out of him when he fell from his place all of us know of people that used to serve the lord and used to go to church and used to be you know christians as we'd call them yet many of them today don't want anything to do with the lord they want nothing to do with church well at one time it seemed like they had something with god do we know people like that they had something with god they seemed to love to go to church what happened to them well they fell from whatever it was that they had but apparently whatever they had would not keep them well praise god that's why i'll tell you one thing it takes more than saying god sent a prophet to keep you it takes more than saying well i believe in the cross you can believe that and be lost well i believe god still loved the world that's well and good but if you don't know him not to know his word not to quote the prophet well the prophet said this that's good we do that and we believe that it's not knowing brother branham that gets you to heaven it's knowing the lord jesus it's not coming to this church it's not coming to some other church it's meeting him and the dead has been settled and he's actually taken your fallen nature upon him and he exchanged his nature for yours glory to god he actually took your fallen nature and gave you part of his nature which was the nature of god oh my help us lord now notice that when this man fell it put all of mankind of course in the old testament that god would accept a substitutionary life and he would accept the lamb which was the first one that we know that god himself slayed the lamb through the skins and behind the bushes to his son and daughter and they come out veiled in that but yet that could never take away where the sin actually laid because now they moved from a dispensation of innocence into a dispensation of conscience and now even though they would do wrong and ask god to forgive them yet the conscience was still there to remind them you did this and you did this and you did this and through the all the old testament under the levitical order and no matter how much they loved god look at david what a display of a man that had an ungermatized seed of god's election inside of him to love god the way that man loved him it's definitely a deposit of election but he could never be born again he could feel the spirit of god oh he would get anointed and play his harp and write beautiful songs and psalms and so on and we still love them today do we not and he was really anointed but the anointing would come on the outside of him and the anointing would inspire him but the anointing never went inside of his nature and destroyed that nature and make david a new creature so he could love god he could sing he could shout he could prophesy things that would come to pass and yet steal another man's life and cause that man to be killed why because his love for god could never be quickened by eternal life he had a seed and it laid there but the old testament could never bring it to life there was no lamb in the old testament that had a soul all glory there was no lamb because a spirit but no animals have spirits but they do not have a soul but there was no lamb there was no turtle dove pigeon ox whatever it was in the old testament that ever had a soul that could stand in substitutionary value for the soul of man so man's nature then inside of him and the law was constant don't do that and don't do that and don't do that and they wanted not to do it many of them didn't want to do it but there was no power in them to help them not to do it and then god would let judgment fall upon them and god would punish them and then that oh god we're so sorry please forgive us lord we're so sorry please forgive us and it wasn't no time that's right back at it again why because there was this problem was a soul problem it was a soul problem in reality every bit of our problems when it comes to this is a love problem from the soul a love problem from the soul this is why folks that just accept christ as their savior put their name on a church book they'll never be able to really be a real real sold out christian because the love of the nature of the world is still there they've accepted him as their savior but not as their lord now what's this in question answered so what then does the new births what is it actually for what good does it do well the way that many have watered it down on the day that we're living in that it basically saves you and yet god leaves you in this sinful state that you really can't keep from sinning and nobody can live a perfect life and and everybody you know everybody's so flawed and we are we know that but yet if the new birth does not do something inside of our soul different from the old testament lamb we might as well all just get a goat or a turtle love or a pigeon and just offer that because if the blood of the lord jesus does not do something from within then he's no more than another goat or a turtle dove or an ox of the old testament then why would god offer the soul of the lamb of god unless the soul of the lamb of god is going to come back and deposit part of his own nature inside of his own children hallelujah oh my notice this in question answers if god made man in his own image what kind of man did he make then a question a spirit man in genesis 2 there was no man to till the soil so here this man of genesis 1 26 is already in creation and yet there's no man to till the soil well why wasn't there because a spirit does not plow a garden a spirit man does not go out turn pick fruits and and trim this and do this no he does not do that so there was no man to be able to till the soil so notice what he says there was no man to till the soil and god made man out of the dust of the earth not in his image but in the image of animal life now this is what we know so well today don't you love hate yourself look be honest friends we've got this love hate relationship with ourselves we do and yet we know that it's you know it's that thing that's inside of us to protect ourselves to feed ourselves and so on there's something wrong with us if we do not do it but yet it's not the real us so here this man now comes into view and he said he was made not in the image of god this is not in the image of god but in the image of animal life and he put the spirit of man in this animal man so the man of genesis 1 26 is now breathed or spoke into the man of genesis 2 7. so this item now what was his name before he was adam what was he he got this name adam actually took on the dust image now your name being jeremy your name being jack and yours been keith's and you know all you different names but what is that that's the name that was given to your dust body by your dust body parents but more than likely that won't be your real name in heaven right you'll have a word name amen now we call this man adam because that's all we know him by but that doesn't mean that's really his name in the book of life his name might be something totally completely different remember the lord jesus according to the book of revelation will receive a new name is that right and i will write on them my new name so his new name is not the name now what is his name now jesus christ which is what the name of the dust body well glory to god donnie reagan jim brown fred smith whatever it is that's the name of your dust body but yet there is another name by which you will be called at that day notice he said he put the spirit of man inside this animal man here and he became a living soul so when this spiritual part went inside of this natural part then it makes the man different so the man stands there with his toes the prophet liking the question answers and he said he still there like a a tree and his toes is like roots in the ground and he's standing there but he's not moving he's not breathing there's nothing going on he's just a an animal a corpses would say standing there and then god comes and breathes not just any spirit not just any attribute but the attribute which he had made for this body i hope you understand that when you took the breath of life the same almighty god breathed the seed of life inside of you [Applause] it was not your mama seed or your daddy's seed or somebody else's seed it was you it was to be you before the foundation of the world now you put the spirit of man in this animal man here and he become a living soul now that's the difference between a man and the animal the animal don't build automobiles he doesn't do things like that to help his living and so forth like that he's an animal dumb brute he hasn't got a soul now you look at the birds today and the way you know now we're going into the fall and they won't be making it but it won't be too long spring will roll back around again and you'll see the robins and the cardinals and the different ones and they'll start making their nests and you know what they're making their nests exactly the same way that they did when adam was in the garden of eden doesn't it amazing that you don't find any robin standing in line at home depot or lowe's and they're checking out some little mini tuba fours and little mini guns and you know they got little mini shingles and and little mini hammers and they're in there and they're just you know getting all their white why y'all doing there birds we're fixing to building this well i thought you you no no no no we were updated we're that day we built little shingles and we got little flushing toilets in our house and little little tiny faucets and stuff and everything we've got hair dryers and no they do exactly the same way they did years ago look at the cattle this winter in the wintertime and the horses and they'll they'll stand right out and you're freezing to death you've got on all my all kinds of warm clothes and them cattle stand right there and say how in the world do they do it they wear the same coat that their grandparents and grandparents and grandparents did after the fall from the garden of eden and you build them a barn and they ain't got enough sense to get in and sometimes they'll walk in and walk out is that right why they don't have a soul so you never see them out building a barn putting a heat pump in the barn and doing all that they don't have a soul but look at man he keeps progressing more and more and more man through electronics through science through space through all that he's doing it'll be unbelievable when you think about it if time will tear another 20 years what man will be able to do but you see by doing this man then comes to the spot to where he becomes the god of his own existence because he can look around he can see the dog the cat the cow the horse the giraffe whatever more and they don't do any more than what they've done for thousands of years but man keeps getting higher and higher and higher and higher so he becomes to the spot to where he does not need god anymore in his life if he needs new medicine he makes it if he needs bigger hospitals and more machines to do greater scans he just keeps on through scientific research and he finds it and he provides everything he thinks that he needs but he can't minister to his own soul [Applause] so then what was god's purpose when the lord jesus introduced this strange doctrine that would be later known to us and down through 2000 years of church ages called the new birth or being born again what was the plan and purpose of god in order to bring the new birth so what is the new birth well it's something that happens supernaturally we know it's not natural it cannot be although the natural elements are instruments by which god will use and we hear the gospel we send you a preacher preach and something moves on a heart or maybe you pass a church sign and something strikes your heart with conviction and you see that and all of a sudden you feel like you need to ask god to forgive you you need and god uses that human instrumentality but yet the work if it's true is a work from within so it's something that supernaturally comes from heaven projected down to create an atmosphere around you and then it pulls you inside that atmosphere notice this and now notice all things 1952 when the worshiper is purged it's when he is born again when his old nature dies and a new nature sets in so then when we are born we receive this old nature it's a sinful nature it was our first husband that had the rule over us and every one of us got it whenever we were born that's why our children as we dedicated those beautiful little babies a while ago but yet if time will tear in the lord will will hold off his coming for a few years they will have to give their heart to the lord jesus is that right a person could be raised in the church dedicated to god raised in the church never do any things that many worldly children would do they've still got to be born again why they got an ill mean nature which is of the world now watch this then he becomes a part of god so when the old nature dies and a new nature sets in well how does it set how does it get there what causes it when is the moment of this transformation then he becomes a part of god a son of god he gets new life and the life is the greek word there zoe which means the life of god and you become an offspring of god so you see what god wants to do in the new birth is exactly the same thing to you that he did in a similar fashion to adam in the garden of eden thousands of years ago and that was breathe your spiritual identity into this animal life body this is why that we cannot do it on our own well i'm going to church i'm going to get saved today i'm going to how can you do it did any of you decide that you wanted to become immortal on the earth was it any of your all's choice that here you were you were a little germ in your father's body and a part of you there inside of your father which was in your grandfather which was in his father and did you decide as a little germ i i want to get out of here i don't like being here in the lords of my great great great great great great grandfather but i want to be a man i want to live on the earth as a man or i want to be a woman why of course not you had no choice whatsoever but down through the stream of time you came and by the sovereignty of god it could have been another come out of there another you know mixture of the chromosome from the mother chromosome from the man if it had been another one it would have been a girl it would have been another one but you know what god chose you to be more a matter of fact the prophet said the natural birth is a greater mystery to him than the than the virgin verse was so but there was something who determined that you come well i made up my mind you didn't have a mind well i you was no i you was a gene in the loins of your father so who was it that decided that it was time for a son or a daughter or another child to be added to the family mother and father talking about it you mean you were actually brought to this earth without a choice oh my goodness now y'all gonna get in trouble if you agree to this you mean you actually were born into this world without a choice [Music] how many of you chose to be born into the earth how many of you chose to be a human instead of a dog none of you wow so you mean you were actually born a human by a will which was superior to your own you're sitting there looking at me nodding your head with your little masks on and you're then they're nodding your head that you did not choose to be here that you did not choose the day you would be here did any of you choose your family would be nice sometimes if we could have [Music] you can choose your friends but you can't always choose your family can you so that we we did not choose the family we were born in the time we were born in we didn't even get to choose if we was a man or a woman whatever we were but that choice was made by someone else now you don't mean to tell me you think it was just of your mother and father to bring a human into this age when there's so much sin and so much wickedness and it's just of them to put you here as a mortal you're hung you might as well say amen what if they could do that and he said well it wasn't that it was unjust it was love oh i see so your father loved your mother and they decided after however long they'd been married they wanted to have a child and you are the product of that love then you come to this earth as a productivity of a man loving a woman a woman loving a man and then you're brought to the earth without your own choice without your own consideration and you think that's just could not thou almighty from back in eternity through his seeds as it were down through time and said there will be a moses there'll be an aaron there'll be a levi there'll be a david there'll be a samuel there'll be a donny there'll be a nathan there'll be a carol there'll be this and that and the other if your mother and father if your mother and father could be able to do what about your father that loved you before your mother was ever born now what is this thing then of the new birth why is it so oh my was it so imperative why is it absolute absolute necessity to get it then if it is can't you see it will be one of the main things that satan will try his best to confuse people on if he can confuse them that they have the new births when they really don't or if he can try to convince them they don't when they really do it will be one of the most terrific things that he confused people on and their entire journey as a mortal because if they think they've got it and they really don't have it they will not go away in the rapture if they don't think they have when they really do they'll never be able to accept fully who they are because they're always looking at their human mistakes and their human errors and say oh if i could only be born again or if i only had the holy ghost and yet it's setting inside of your soul it is you oh hallelujah it loves you it's sealed you it is him that gives you the strength you need from day to day and you're wishing you had it so the greek word is zoe which means the life of god and you become an offspring of god and god can't hurt you without hurting himself praise me to god this the cruelty of sin so the soul of man is the nature of the spirit now when you're reborn you don't get a new spirit you get a new nature of that spirit it's the same spirit but a new nature of it you take two men stand them together both look alike one of them a sinner one of them are christian one man say i got the spirit same as you have see but one of them is different his soul his nature's different he's been changed oh so you mean brother donnie that he quit drinking he quit smoking no that's not what i'm talking about at all a person could drink they could drink so much every day they could they could smoke they could take all kinds of pills they could have 57 girlfriends they could cuss they could live the office terrible life ever was and if they would make up their mind and they had the ability to quit all of those above mentioned things they are still as lost as they were before because we do not find ourselves he finds us we do not change ourselves we do not transform ourselves amen we kick into action once the transformation has started in the cycle of our soul that's when we start doing things that's when we start sanctifying ourselves that's whenever something starts moving in us and our works become the expression of his face which has been born in us but there ain't but one person that can cause the new birth and that's the almighty there ain't but one man in the earth one man in the earth that could have caused me as a mortal to come to this earth because i was in the loins of don reagan him and my mama marion 18 19 years old me being born and lived with a little shack right up next to windy y'all know where windy is and i tell my chicago it's not windy city but it's windy there's one little store and the road comes up like this and turns around that little store and then you got a fork that goes this way and a fork that goes that way and if you fork left right there and drive out that gravel road about a half a mile that's where i was brought back i was born our little old lean to house sat right down that gravel road cars had come by mama said the dust would come to in the house now there's purdue people that lived around there there was chaplains there was all kinds of other people but i could not glory i could not be taken back to their house now they had nicer houses in my mom and daddy the folks down this way the bertrams had a nice brick house the purdues lived up this way and had a nice big two-story country style house but i could not have been taken to their house and called to bertram because i was a reagan now as poor as i was as underprivileged as i was i'd still rather lived with my mom and daddy because if i would have went into the bertram house that always been something inside of me you know it is folks that are adopted and they're adopted into a family even when they're young and there's something inside them they want to try to make the connection with their biological parents lord of god hallelujah don't you understand when you were born into this world you were taken to the bertram house of sin or the produce how a house of sin but there was something down inside of you that long to know who your biological father was there was something inside of you that wanted to know there's got to be more to go into just going to church there's got to be more to god than just signing your name on a book what was it it was that little seed of god inside of you crying for identity [Applause] what's this god's provided way conversion is the holy spirit that moves the old nature out and the new nature comes in which is the holy ghost so you see whenever you look at what so many folks believe the new birth is today i accept jesus as the son of god i accept him as my savior you're born again and where did you get that out in the bible did peter and them on acts chapter 2 when they went up to the upper room do they sit there we believe jesus christ the son of god we accept him as our savior their birth come from heaven [Applause] right the pillar of fire divided himself in the upper room and their births come from heaven well guess what if you ever get it yours will come from the same place during the preacher in the world oh so-and-so is my favorite preacher i don't care who it is how favorite he is he cannot be able to give you a new birth no one can do that but god notice this so conversion is the holy spirit that moves the old nature out and the new nature comes in which is the holy ghost again the lamb and the dove if you want to be a christian just ask christ and he will take your own nature out and put a new nature in notice he's not saying smoking he's not saying drinking he's not saying running around or your wife or your husband you see you get rid of the sin problem and the attributes of sin fall off they just automatically die then you don't have to impersonate anything it's just your normal life that you're living a friend for those that are really born again it's no harder for them to live a born-again life and it is a center to live their life as a matter of fact to me it's much easier to live a holy ghost field life than it is to live a sinner you look out here at the centers and what they're doing and their master don't love them you'll never prove to me that the devil has love he hates that's right he don't love his people he's not going to take them to heaven he cannot give them a new body he cannot give them peace he cannot give them joy to me it'd be much harder to live for him out there in the world than it is to live this kind of a life oh brother donny don't you struggle don't you struggle to be a christian no i never have struggled since i was a 12 year old boy and i'm 64 years old oh but boy i just feel the pull of the world oh my my well apparently i must have got a a real dose of something whenever i started i never oh i'm thinking about giving up well i'm thinking about giving up really we're this close to the end of the way and you're thinking about giving up my you need to fall in love with the lord jesus because it's sweeter and sweeter as the days go by [Applause] notice as long as you got malice envy strife and all these things of the world you mean to tell me malice is a worldly thing envy is a worldly thing strife people who love to argue that is a worldly attribute well praise the lord the bible said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god's not even in you see because the life of god isn't in you the life is in there it just produces itself it just lives its way out can you imagine imagine adam getting up in the morning saying man i'm struggling today it's so hard for me to be adam wow i wish i was bob i wish i spread i wish i was oh man it must have been wonderful being adam well let me just go ahead and say that you think i'm crazy anyway i don't mind telling you it's wonderful being the holy ghost phil donny i'll tell you one thing friends i would not be want to be a cardinal donny reagan that didn't have the holy ghost oh goodness no there's too much stuff from the reagan side and on the show side my mother side no way what i want to live in this world and go like a lot of my family have gone uh-uh but it is joy unspeakable and full of glory being donny reagan filled with the holy ghost how many knows what i'm talking about it is peace that passes understanding when the world don't know what we're going to do they're terrified about kova they're scared to death about how the president is going to do this and that and the other they're scared about the economy they're scared about this and every day we're getting closer and closer and closer to our future home oh it's wonderful somebody ought to say amen with me if you're really filled with the holy ghost today you can say it's great to be filled with the holy ghost and be a nathan davis it's great to be a son of god and be a jd whitson it's a privilege to be a skipwalker and filled with the holy ghost i'd rather be that than anything else i know in this earth let me have a few more minutes kenna until this body has been redeemed it's subject to sickness again exactly right now it's got to die it's got to perish so did the soul have to perish the thoughts the soul is the nature of the spirit and those thoughts and so forth in you had to perish before the new man could be born into you to make you a new creature god ain't wanting to take your old nature and remodel it [Music] he's wanting to kill it hebrews chapter 6 part 2 your old nature oh brother donny that scares me when you read them quotes oh my scarecrows are for crows but i know so and so on so and so and so i don't care what so-and-so does scarecrows shouldn't scare eagles don't you know why satan uses scarecrows to keep you and i away from the truth that lays in the word [Applause] your old nature died the nature of the world and you become a new creation and your desires of that whole life that had a beginning when god breathed the breath of life into your nostrils when you took that breath of life as a baby god breathed into you that natural life he was born and your name was put on the book of life and your record was quiet for years until you told your first lie maybe you and your little brother was playing with something you shouldn't have been playing with and you knocked it off and mama comes screaming and crying mom it wasn't him it wasn't me he was healed i promise i swear to god yeah right and something in you then made you feel horrible as a little child you know what i'm saying notice this oh my the life that life of your carnal nature died it had a beginning and it had an end don't you see why folks are trying to preach the new birth that god takes that nature that you was born with and saves it and fills it with the holy ghost and transforms it god does one thing with it kill it and god takes that deposit of himself and quickens it with his own soul glory to god that's the part of you that can be said you've never done it in the first place notice since that life of carnal nature died it had a beginning and it had an end and it died and was done away with forever that old nature god came in with the new nature did you see why satan would want to interrupt this program of god he'd much rather offer people a church membership what don't don't don't take that new birth stuff don't get that life of jesus that'll make you a little immature god that'll make you deity in a human body don't get that just cheer your hair just take some tapes and stay home and play tapes and go to church every now and then and you know just be a pretty good guy you'll go to hell you'll be lost but this is what happens god came in with the new nature then love joy peace long suffering generous peace boy we must need to hear that twice didn't we patience and meekness and kindness that entered and taken the place of malice and temper and hatred and emulation oh you mean you can't have both of them it took its place when you passed from death unto life let me read this a little close there's people here perhaps in our audience that's never accepted this formula but as far as receiving the holy spirit and being inoculated a nature in there that takes the old nature out and puts the new nature in they've never did that i pray thee father that tonight that they will receive it wow so only father can cause this to happen if you come up to pentecost to route the way myself and some of these others did and you went up to the altar and they beat you on the back jesus you got it i'll tell you what i got and it bit my tongue off because you're slamming the bottom of my jaws you got it you got it but many of them spoke in tongues and didn't have it many of them joined the church and didn't have it we've seen in our own ranks many that come around us that didn't have it why people can't give it to you they can't beat it in you they can't stomp it in you they can't do a little they can't do that there's only one person that can father god's children and that is god there's only one person that can breathe eternal life into us and that is the eternal himself [Applause] let's stand together i got way too much to look at can i read you one more notice what happens to you then thy sage will possess the gate of his enemies they become a new creature they're a new nature they're they're a new being a new creature there the greek word says new creation he's quoting now from second corinthians 5 17 if you'd like to read it a new creation you have been recreated again from what you were to the image of a son of god and a daughter of god it's just such and all it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a sinner can be made to become a christian now remember who is saying these words this is a man this is the year 1961. this is a man who has seen the dead raised this is a man who has seen god take congressman upshaw which had been crippled for years and years and make him walk he'd seen florence nightingale which was only the skeleton of a person and see the dove come on the window and set on the window seal and god miraculously healer he had seen it in arkansas eight days and nights on the platform thousands of miracles seen it in south africa when they led this african boy and he was so out of his mind with a chain around his neck like a dog and he seemed the spirit of god after prayer raise him up to his feet and restore him in his right mind he had seen some of the greatest miracles that human eyes had ever behold and yet he says the greatest miracle that's when you are born again isn't it amazing many of us that are born again and yet we think we don't see no miracles every day you live in this earth and your birth holds itself it's a sustaining miraculous power of god let's bow our heads if you would oh jesus maybe there's some here today under the sound of my voice or some that have streamed this service today or will stream it from different parts of the world you love the lord and you go to church or maybe you're sick today and you can't go or but you believe that god's word is right and true as far as for you to say personally that you have this i'm not your judge but you just look at your own heart your own life if there's anything missing from that today why don't you ask father father please come please come i'm not standing outside of eden's gates as it were 4 000 years ago but i'm standing here in happy valley today i need you to pass my way and breathe into me lord god your life heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth from whence we were taken if time would go on one day we will return but we're so thankful heavenly father that our man of genesis 1 when the man of genesis 2 if we would relate it to us as well how many of our buried lord the years that i've been here over 30 years now how many of their bodies are laying over here at the cemetery bluntville kingsport sullivan county jonesboro but yet lord god when the life left their body that real spirit being that was inside of them in a moment was carried over to the other side and entered into a theophany body with the hope that their dust body will be raised again except this time it won't be animal life it'll be zoey life in the human body lord god if there's one here today or one who will hear this service they've never met you that way lord i pray you it helps them father we don't want to be religious we want to be born again lord we could be called by all kinds of names we could call her and church name all sorts of things we could belong to a denomination or organization or we could be known as followers of the message that's no more than just another term if we don't know you so lord we want to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we pass from death unto life that we're not having to make ourselves live this life that it's you paul told the saints of his day that he desired to labor on them until christ would be formed in them so we know the further revealing of this word is christ actually is the new man of our soul the new man versus the old man lord jesus i'll worship you today i thank you father for my own personal miracle god you've allowed me to lay my hands on many many folks i've seen folks heal with cancer i've seen cross-eyed straightened out lord i've seen so many wonderful things that you've done lord god i thank you for my personal greatest miracle is changing me from a mixture of a reagan and a shoat and my first marriage that had to rule over me and somehow you got that nature to reason together with you and you killed it and the miraculous new birth started forming in me thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus i today am a miracle hallelujah hallelujah you've healed me so many times thank you for that you've delivered me so many times but i know if i live long enough i'll get sick again but once you liberated me from my first husband and we talk about the husband dying that's only half of the equation not only did that first husband die but that person he's married to had to die together the whole union was annulled not only did our first husband which had to rule over us die but we died to death with him praise god and we were recreated and the image of god thank you lord jesus we love you today father we worship you lord god can we just raise our hands friends in the presence of the great king well if this has happened to you today you ought to be one of the happiest people that's alive on the face of the earth many people have gathered today in religious places and they've said the rituals and the routines many hindus have gathered and many people of islam they will pray several times today and put down their prayer rug and their face toward mecca and call upon a god who they call allah which does not even exist the shintos many the taoist many of the different religions of the world they will get alone and meditate and try to think the problems away think the seriousness of the state we're in a way but you and i couldn't think it away talk it away carry it away there's only one person that could take it away and that was our father praise god thank you lord jesus we worship you mighty god thank you for condescending so low lord that would you would come down to this earth not only become a human but become sin the snake on the pole angels would hide their face from you spirit god would hide man would curse and spit on you you'd be so out of the economy of god that it pleased the father to bruise you and lay on you the iniquity of us all but isaiah went on to say after you have made your soul an offering you will see your seed look this way today lord jesus we're not all of it but we're glad we're part of it amen look this way today lord god standing in this place or some of your seed we're able to stand here today redeemed because your soul was not only offered your soul was accepted hallelujah so you're able to go not only in place sacrificial blood and symbol upon the altar in hebrews as paul so beautifully declared it but your soul was accepted for mine then i become born again i receive a portion of you back in me glory to god we worship you lord god thank you lord jesus come and just worship him a little bit now saints walmart in his presence think of it any of you that used to sit around with a cigarette between your fingers a can of beer a bottle or whatever it was pills looking for happiness searching for something but jesus got a hold of your life oh he didn't eliminate all your problems we know better than that but he eliminated your biggest problem which was a soul problem your problem wasn't drinking your problem unsmoking it was a soul problem god accepted a work of his own hands in the mediatorial aspect to offer a soul in place of ours so that we could be born again and he would come by where you as a knelt down on an altar or out in a barnyard somewhere or wherever it was that he dealt with you and you were born afresh and you took the breath of eternal life never to die again oh jesus oh jesus how many appreciates that miracle of the new birth that's happened to you sing something hey

was rebuilt herod enlarged it taken him 46 years to do it there was a place written with your name on it it was on the outside and it said something like this upon pain of death any gentiles entering from this point on will be killed you had no right in the holy place you had no right in the holy of holies but upon pain of death he took it for us and said children don't stay out now come on in come into the holy of holies now you can walk right up before the throne of god and raise your hands and say abba father i by father i'm redeemed can we just worship him a little before we go hungry i

on the hearts of the people to go back and rebuild they'd be dedicated again that day and the scripture said many of the people wept they wept and they cried because the glory of the first temple was so stupendous so the ministry went among the people and they said quit crying there's a time of rejoicing here they were they'd labored and done everything they could to bring the glory of god back among the people but they were so sad father may you help us as we deal with covet and we deal with all kinds of things that's around us satan trying to steal our joy and our peace may i be one of
