========================================

great loss in their family possibly facing another May the spirit of God move forward nor would pray for sister Elaine Burdette today that should be with her brother Tim takes me back just a few minutes ago saying they're giving her fluids and we pray for your mercy to our sister Lord we know there's a lot of sickness going on flu coveted different types of viruses but we believe your God over the viruses God over the flu God over everything speak to us today minister to the needs of your people we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated it's hard for me to imagine I have to be honest how that David by this time must have felt we've all fallen short of the glory of God we've all made mistakes I doubt there's a person here today that doesn't have regrets of all kinds of things in life not only of the way we've treated the Lord but of the way we've treated others and maybe things that we've done and said that if we could do it over we certainly would do it over again but I can't say that I've ever stood where David is standing never had a man killed never taken another man's wife and never done all the lying and conniving that David had to do to make this happen and then after it happened apparently he thinks he can be able to go right on and everything will be just fine as a matter of fact the prophet quotes this and he says that David whenever he had taken your eyes wife that David actually thought he could hide it from God which is really amazing to me how anyone can think they could hide anything from God but it shows whenever we backslide and go to getting away from the Lord we may not be doing what a lot of people in the world would do but yet in our heart we just are not loving him the way we used to and not feeling toward him the way we used to and we find ourselves not only feeling that way toward the Lord but toward people and to the church and to his body and all of that so it was a long scenario that had now developed and David has finally his conscience has caught up with his wrong and he's been smitten and you can hear him as he's reaching out to God and he's certainly a Broken Man and he's acknowledging his sin he's acknowledging that he done a terrible terrible wrong many of them actually broke four of the Ten Commandments in doing this and yet somehow the mercy of God was still there for David now we've left him here for for a couple of weeks and I'm sure it's been hard on you all it's been hard on me because he's one of my favorite Bible characters I just have to be honest and say and I used to say I've said it to you before that I thought what grace of God to Bathsheba but actually after preaching this I've thought what grace of God to David so I guess we've all kind of been there to where we look down our nose that people were saying plural so-and-so plural so and so boy it'll be the grace of God if they ever get to heaven won't it but I think the more we look at ourselves the more we realize it'll be the grace of God if you make it it'll be the grace of God if any of us make as far as the words there's none of us of course that are worthy in our natural birth but let us let us resume here in Psalm 51 if you would and let's look in verse 7. David goes on to say Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be wider than snow now I can't say again that I understand why it's taken so long for this guilt to catch up with him but somehow he had hardened his heart he had become indifferent toward the lord and had become indifferent toward wrong in thinking that he would be able to get Bible with this but now it's all kind of caught up with him and he's he's a scriptural man he's a man that still loves the Lord and I hope you understand this he's still a man that is after God's Own Heart and he's a man that God had made a covenant with before this ever happened and even though he's done wrong God will never let that Covenant go so notice he says Purge me with hyssop now this was a common weed it first shows up to us in the book of Exodus when the children of Israel are going to leave the land of Egypt so it was a weed that was very common you didn't have to go to Evergreen to get it you didn't have to go to a special plant shop to be able to get it but it was everywhere so they were to take hyssop they were to dip it and the spill blood and be able to put it over the lentil and the doorpost of their home so they did the same thing with the cleansing of leprosy they also did the same thing in the cleansing of a person who had touched a dead body so David is recognizing that what he has done is a horrible sin so it's associated with deaths It's associated with Leprosy which is sin it is associated was he Angel of Death if God God had not been merciful to David his own judgment would have been pronounced upon him now look at how fast repentance can be able to stand between mercy and Justice because David's own judgment was let the man who has done this when Nathan the prophet told him about the parable and he said let the man who has done this he must surely die and Nathan said you're the man but David repented and repented in such a genuine way that God said to Nathan Nathan to David you shall not surely die but the sword will never leave your house look how fast repentance can be able to spare someone's life I love repentance myself I thank God for it how many still needs it well praise the Lord not everybody well that's good now David is now though at the spot to where he's feeling so saddened he's feeling so heavy and so burdened and it's like he cannot say it enough I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and we know that when whenever we repent it's not that God requires us to say it over and over and over and over again we don't believe that we have to do Penance we do not believe that we have to say so many Hail Marys and all that sort of thing but when we genuinely do it and do it once as far as God is concerned that's enough but what I'm seeing is a man that recognizes he's done so wrong and he's fell so far remember this is not now a little Shepherd boy which is in his teens but it's a middle-aged man which is the king of Israel so had he been a Shepherd boy hardly nobody would have even known him maybe his mother his father possibly his brothers but now not only does David know it the kingdom knows it the enemy knows it all kinds of people know what this man has done no doubt as he's feeling the layers of his sin he's repenting in different stages repenting to God repenting to his kingdom repenting to his family repenting to Bathsheba remember Bathsheba had no rights and we we have no recording in the scripture that she was actually guilty on any part if she would have refused him he could have absolutely have her kill remember in those days there was nobody above the king as far as the law now we know how it is in our politics today that people think they can do certain things using it by with it and some of them can it depends on how far they are you know the politicians today can get by with things that you and I would try to do we'd be thrown in jail and they'd throw away the key but our politicians do it all the time and because of who they are they can get by with it is that right that's right or they'll have all kind of hearings and nobody ever hardly ever gets thrown in jail but yet David it was the same way in the sense of who's going to penalize him oh but you see there was one that was still above David and that was God and God had a prophet who was not afraid to walk into David's court and condemn the man for the sin that he had done but now the condemnation is no longer necessary we don't find Nathan ever coming back again and reminding him remember remember remember remember it was not necessary now because David's hardened conscience had been awakened By The Sword of the spirit and David was so smitten there wasn't a day went by I dare say there wasn't an hour that went by that he had not all thought about what he had done how could I have done this how could I have stooped so low and we know it's a delicate balance because the Lord wants us truly repent and then the Lord wants us to accept his forgiveness for that but I hope you understand what I'm going to say that myself I worry about people that do terrible wrongs and they just say well I'm sorry and also what I did wrong and I'm okay now that really troubles me because you think do they understand the weight of what they have done do they understand the consequences of what they have done and then on the other hand I worry about people that do wrong and they're just constantly repenting repenting month in month out year in year out you know to me there's got to be a balance in there somewhere that we find that spot to where you know how it is even with your children when they do wrong and you tell them that they're wrong and you correct them and you deal with them however you correct your children and you don't want them being wrong for so long and feeling under that oppression of being wrong that they just become so despondent they don't want to live then you know you've penalized them to such a severe level they don't want to live no more right and it's the same way with the spirit of God he wants us to feel wrong to know that we've done wrong but he wants us to accept that forgiveness and be able to not only allow him to forgive us but for us to forgive ourselves I don't know about you I'm my worst one when it comes to condemning and all that sort of thing if I trespass against many of you you would forgive me it might hurt your feelings and all of that and I would forgive you but for me I'm the worst one oh I just pick I'll pick it I pick it I go on and pick it I won't forgive myself I knew better I should have I should have and I stare say I'm not the only one and David is still under this time is it the wrong time is he at the right stage forgive me I think that David is still in this delicate balance trying to find that spot but David sees the measure of what he's done now remember the way that Nathan likened him he likened it that David was a sheep stealer even though it was uh uriah's wife but it was something that was so dear and David had stolen something that cost him nothing so the way the prophet conveys it he conveys that it was Uriah that took this little sheep and raised it up and nurtured it and fed it and taken care of it and David it cost him nothing at him no investment whatsoever in the sheath but he took something that did not belong to him and this is the way that Nathan sets it forth and God doesn't like sheep stealing no he doesn't whether it's a king or a preacher or whoever it is God has a major problem with it and if you're a Christian you should too but yet the ways that God conveys it was this man had invested so much time and so much labor and so much work in the sheep and David thought nothing of that all David wand wanted was something that would satisfy his passions at the time and he sent her back home she was now defiled so David is going through all of these layers of this sin which had accumulated no doubt it was over a period of time and now it's at that spot to where he's realizing he needs cleansing now he goes on to say in verse 8 make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice now it had been some time since he'd been able to enjoy his joy of the Salvation the Lord had given him unto the Old Testament dispensation so he was depressed he was sad he was weary he was despised on them now they're talking about the sweet psalmist of Israel we're talking about a man that would write songs that we still sing to this day a man that was so inspired and could pick up an instrument and all of a sudden the Lord just come to him and give him words that are so anointed that we Rejoice send them to this very hour is that right but yet even this man which had been so blessed by God no doubt he would pick up his harp and he couldn't play he would pick up and go back and look at the songs that the Lord had given he said oh my I remember those days I remember when I was under his anointing but now he tried to sing and he couldn't write he just put his pen back down he would try to pray oh Lord anoint me oh Lord give me something give me something fresh how many has ever been there and yet he had come to that spot that his Joy was gone and it was as if though David was likening this to bones that had been broken so he was not only dealing with a broken Joy but he was dealing with as it were a broken bone both of you that have had them you know how painful that it can be so it's not only that he was likening it to a bone that was out of joint but one that had been broken notice he says whenever make me to hear joy and gladness now it wasn't that there wasn't happy things around him but it was like he did not have the ability and the capacity to be able to receive them what was it his sin had so taken from him his Joy of loving the Lord and no doubt David was one of the happiest people you'd ever want to be around people must have just loved to be around him and he was conscious would say maybe humming a song or singing or song and just what the Lord had gave him you know blessed be the Lord blessed be his name and blessed be his courts and I'd rather live a day in the house of my God to live a thousand years in sin and people would just marvel to be around him and they was noticing being around David that he was just so quiet he wasn't whistling anymore and he wasn't humming anymore and he wasn't singing anymore and they just noticed he was really down and weary oh my what a sad thing it must have been in the whole Kingdom of Israel as they would talk about him that come into Jerusalem and it was like something had hovered over the entire city and this city was known for its Splendor it was known for its beauty but it was also known because the king that was there was a great harpist and a great singer and no doubt people would come from all over the kingdom just to hear David sing special songs and they would just love to hear frame do a concert and one of his main musicians was a man by the name of my skill and my skill was a very talented guy many of the Psalms are written to different ones and they would take those psalms and their musical instruments or how the people must have destroyed when word would get Out Among the jerusalemites and they'd say David's singing today and David's playing and they said Oh you mean King David himself yes and they'd get all their instruments together and that's set up somewhere in a court or in a park somewhere and David would pick up his harp and he'd go to strumming across through there and people that was oppressed and sad they just begin to feel better and their burdens would get lighter as David was charged taking his finger and remember this was the same anointed man that began to play for King Saul when the spirit of the Lord had left him and the evil spirit troubles Saul and when David but picked up his string instruments and started raking across there that devil would leave him shame on you that don't believe in music and church oh Hallelujah but David would try to reach down and pick up his harp and say I just can't do it I just can't do it and the people that think when are we going to have another concert as we'd say when it's King David going to sing another song oh it's been forever since my skill told us that that King David whether they're still playing or they're still singing and we're asking well where's the king where's the king always really he's really busy and he just got a lot on him right now and he's kind of low David was now feeling bruised and broken notice in verse 9 he says hide thy face from my sins and blot out all uniniquities created me a clean heart o God huh I find this amazing because this man in the Old Testament has a very wonderful perspective of how he's going to have to be changed he can't do it himself no doubt he's done everything that the law would provide for him to get out of this slump that he's in but he just can't do it but he sees there's one way out and that is a new creation create in me listen what he says create in me a clean heart now this is quite an admission it's an admission no doubt that he thought he'd never have to make that David has a heart that is corrupt and vile and wicked no doubt I never thought he would ever be saying such a thing that my heart is not clean my heart is not right before God well you all are quiet this morning create in me a clean heart oh God oh hallelujah it's defile with Sith I'm the great singer of Israel I'm the Great Joy bringer to the camp I'm the Goliath Slayer I'm the bear killer I'm the lion killer but now I ain't got enough joy to even pick up a sword I just feel so low and so despondent God I need your help you think you didn't know it before now he did but it never been to where he is now or maybe some of you are the same place today you've never been quite Where You Are and you say what do I do which way do I go and one of the worst things you can do is go away from him and one of the worst things you can do is go away from church it always amazes me when people need help from the Lord and help from the body and one of the first things Satan will try to do to them is pull them away from the word pull them away from fellowship isolate them and then they go to getting colder and colder and more indifferent you're going to preach with me today now David is actually he must come to the core of his problem he must come to the spot that he's not blaming Bathsheba he's not blaming the man who went and got Bathsheba he's not blaming the captain of the Guard why did you not stop me he must come to the core of the problem that the problem is himself and David realizes even with the New Testament perspective which is marvelous to me because the shedding of the blood of a lamb could never Quicken a soul and make a soul realize how treacherous that he really was he this man had reached a great place under an Old Testament dispensation and he had finally realized that even under the law now remember there was no law there was no sacrifice that accompanied the law that was an atonement for murder now there was a trespass offering there was a peace offering there was all kinds of different offerings designated for different things and there was actually no offering that was given specifically for adultery so if you commit adultery then you get this particular offering and you do this and this and this or if you murder a man you take this offering there was no offer so David said what am I going to do there's no particular offering designated for murder for adultery and I realize unless God changes me I have the potential of doing the same thing again come on let's be honest once you break over and do something wrong it's much easier the next time to do the same thing or worse so David had confronted himself and realize he needed Supernatural help the law couldn't do it the law could not create now David is asking for something that will not be granted for thousands of years but somehow that seed in him knew there's coming today when people will be able to be recreated again so he realizes he cannot clean his heart he cannot change his nature so watch he says renew o my create in me a clean heart and then renew a right Spirit within me which is repair or to renew oneself now once you notice that he's saying this in the state that at one time he did have the right Spirit he had the right attitude and the right love for God but something has happened so he's not asking he's not praying the sinner's prayer he's praying as a backslider I need to be renewed refreshed in the presence of the Lord and then he says renew a right Spirit In Me and the word right it's not in the sense that you and I might think but the word right is to be firm or to be stable to be established to be fixed or enduring now David is praying and asking God to clean him and create within him something that he did not have before and also asking him to give him a stability because he's broken over once and he's afraid he might do it again so he's saying God give me a right Spirit a right attitude an attitude which will be fixed on the foundation of your word that I will never do this again well I hope you understand today that God granted at least this height of this prayer because we have no record David ever did this again so there was something that become established inside of David now literally the translation here right spirit is constantly firm and not yielding to Temptation notice in verse 11 that he says cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me in my mind I wonder was he going back to the days of Saul and did he remember how Saul got in such a terrible State and hey becomes so beside himself that he had a flashback of Saul God don't take your spirit for me don't take your spirit for me the way you did for himself don't take your Holy Spirit from me now remember they did not have it in the Old Testament the way we do by birth but it was an anointing which would come on them remember the Bible speaking about Jeremiah and Ezekiel the prophets and the spirit of the Lord would come upon them but as it came so would it leave it never came in their soul and changed their nature but it would anoint them to write to prophesy to do Mighty works of God and then it would leave them and David saw how it left Saul and his heart is so troubled he's afraid now that God will take it from him oh God cast me not away from thy presence and take not the Holy Spirit from me verse 12 restore unto me the joy not of my salvation but of thy salvation restore unto me a singer a musician a harpist a man that wrote oh such beautiful words I I love to just read his words and just to hear him talk because he was a man that had tapped into a great source of God remember this man never went to college he never graduated from Bible school but he went to Sheep School he went out there to the school of Nature and he was in the presence of God you can tell the man had been divinely touched by the presence of God but somehow this experience had so robbed him of his joy that he just couldn't write no more he couldn't sing no more and even the words no doubt that God had spoke through him he would go back and re-read them and it's like it would just fall on on ground that could not even give birth to it it would no longer moved and he said Lord please restore unto me the joy of thy salvation oh Lord God and uphold me with thy free spirit notice in verse 13 then will I teach I love this because he knows God is going to do it notice the way he says it maybe possibly perhaps that he says then will I teach transgressors thy ways now friends that's all he said brother Donnie I've done wrong I've done this or that yes we all have but we've got to have the confidence Lord God I'm asking you to forgive me I'm asking you to restore me I'm asking you God to have mercy on me and when you do because I know you will I will be a witness of your mercy I will be a witness of your grace don't just wallow in your sin and don't say well I've sinned I might as well forget it I might as well turn away don't you do that you confess no God's going to forgive me and when he does I'm going to go among the people and say the Lord can forgive you because he forgave me oh Hallelujah can't you hear it in his voice it's the anticipation of forgiveness and restore Joy it's not yet there but he anticipates it and may I tell you it did come he's vowing to teach others now remember God does not make us sin and God does not lead any of us never will God lead any of us to break his word never I don't care who you are preacher Prophet nobody no but then when we repent and make it right God will take that thing and turn it around and God can use our fall God can use our failures our mistakes and display his grace ever let him I mean seen him do it now notice in verse 15 oh Lord open thou my lips and my mouse showed my mouth shall show forth I praise you imagine brother Jack he couldn't even praise him no more he's in a spot in his life that this man loved to worship this man loved to praise God but now he's so despondent he needs God to even open his mouth and so I could go to church brother lord said yes everybody praise the Lord and it just I ain't got nothing to praise him for well I don't believe that from any of us is the truth but you know what he meant it's just like there was no fountain in there pushing the joy out there was no Fountain it's just repeating words how many in here besides me has ever worshiped the Lord out of routine well I guess me and Harry and brother Bert and just a few more the only guilty ones well you all pray for us you little angels well I have I praise him and I didn't feel like it I've worshiped him whenever I didn't feel like I preached to you time after time when I was sick I couldn't hardly hold my head up I was so weary and so exhausted and just so burdened I didn't feel like walking out the door to even take a text but I done him you've come to church you didn't feel like it ain't that right you worshiped them you didn't feel like it but thank God those times don't last but David was in this time and it seemed like it would never break away oh listen to this verse 16. for thou desirest not sacrifice else else would I give it thou delightest not in burnt offering now he knows the law he knows there's no burnt offering that'll expiate this sin but he does know what it is the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a broken and a contrite heart now you realize if they offer the lamb a total of a pigeon whatever more they did if it was not accompanied by a broken spirit and a broken and contrite heart it was worthless oh my when we mess up God wants us to repent yes but not just words he wants us to do it from a broken and a contrite heart and a broken Spirit I'm so wrong Lord oh my the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit of broken and contrite heart oh God thou Wilt not despise or turn down now as great as the repentance of David is this whole scenario is not changed because David knew how to repent and how many agree with me he did the man knew how to repent the man knew how to make things right with God but that was not the only reason we're going to find a change in the scenario now we're going to get to Bathsheba but I felt like we had to kind of get David saved again before we went on with the blessings of God on him and bathsheba's marriage so God is going to turn this around but it is not just based upon David's ability to repent but it is also tied further back than that it is based on what I told you that the Lord had spoken to me a week before last when I woke up early one morning and I heard the voice of God say the sure mercies of David and I knew there was a scripture in the Bible but I just couldn't recall what it was so I said Lord don't let me forget this because it's about 2 30 or something like that in the morning and I'm where I made it really weird whatever's the last thing on my mind when I go to sleep whenever I wake up it's the first thing that'll be on my mind when I wake up so I committed it to that department in my quick recovery part of my brain and then whenever I woke up about 5 30 or so the next morning sure enough it was still there so I got up and got my phone and typed it in and I found what it was but I still wasn't sure exactly what it was the sure mercies of David now God had made a covenant with with Abraham and God had made of course what we call the adamic Covenant in the Garden of Eden and then after the fall God made another Covenant and God has made covenants all down through the Bible and God made one of course with Abraham and it was a covenant that I will bless your seed but David fit Under The Canopy as all the children of Israel fit under that canopy of the abrahamic Covenant but God on the occasion would pick out certain of those Jews and make a further extension of that Covenant with them said like this he would modify the abrahamic Covenant in a more personal way to that individual now David was one of those individuals now one of the differences between Saul and David was they were both of course of the children of Israel but God never made a covenant with Saul like he did with David so Saul was under the abrahamic Covenant as David was but David was under the abrahamic Covenant but also the davidic Covenant everybody with me so far first Samuel 13 13 and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thouest not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now with the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever so now we see that Saul has been given a conditional status by which if he obeys God then God will establish his kingdom forever not the Saul would live forever but that would be of the seed of his body when he would die one of his sons would take him and he would die one of his sons would take it and it would go on for anion or space of time which is what the word forever means so it would go on and on and we know that King Saul actually reigned for 40 years but God knew what Saul would do when you look at Saul Saul was a perfect epitome and a type of the people of Israel at that time remember God did not want them to have a king in the first place and they was rebelling against his prophetic leadership yet through the prophets down through the times is that right so they rejected God and God gave them a leader which matched the way they were now you watch leaders and you'll see how they really are you see the reason our nation is in the state that it is because our leaders are a very annotype of the people that they're ruling so their lives are rebellious they were you know dope heads and this and the other so what are they doing they're passing all these laws or the legalizing marijuana and doing everything why because they've sucked on them cigarettes whenever they was in high school and now they're congressmen and Senators well don't get quiet on me so what is it the leaders reflect the desire of the people you see if the people of this assembly ever get to a spot you don't want truth you don't want righteousness you don't want God's word then God will give you a leader which will match your desire but as long as you want truth and righteousness and Purity God if I die God will raise up an oven he dies God to raise up another as long as you want truth and righteousness and Purity God will always have a man before you that will preach you the truth why well that's just the way God does America wanted people like Abraham Lincoln and James Madison and different ones at that time frame well they wanted Abraham Lincoln today of course not the woke society that killed Abraham Lincoln you wouldn't have to worry about John Wilkes boots they'd get rid of him well praise the Lord so it's the same way with Saul so Saul was the epitome of the people he had a rebellious heart he didn't know how to repent blaming other people that was the way the children of Israel were but when they come to the second generation of the kingship now with David the hearts of many of the children of Israel had now changed so this is why God is searching a man after his own heart why because the people's hearts have changed don't you see why we needed a prophet of the heart now Bible call for Prophet was not a prophet of our heads but a prophet of our hearts behold I will send unto you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts not the head and if we as message people ever turn this message into a head message guess what a lot of our preachers will be they will be head preachers which is what's going on in our ranks right now that's why they're against the Pentecostal experience they're against emotion and shouting and praising God and that's going to lean in more toward intellectualism why because many of the message people that's what they want but God still got some Holy Ghost anointed men that are preaching a New Birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost why because we got people that's what they want to hear well praise the Lord now what Saul would have been established forever if he would have been obedient but look at verse 14 but now thy kingdom shall not continue on what basis his disobedience had David had this same Covenant his kingdom would have stopped the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee based upon his behavior his actions what he did and the Lord knew that so the Lord had sought him a man which I find this amazing because the Lord sought him a man but he was a boy when others see a Shepherd boy God may see a king whenever people see a male boy God may see a man a valiant Soldier so God sought him a man now notice he's not the epitome of the rebellious the stubborn the hard-headed but he was a man after God's Own Heart read with me in Acts 13 21 and afterwards they desired a king and God gave them Saul the son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said as I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will oh wait a minute now whoa whoa whoa whoa what about Bathsheba what about Uriah second Samuel 7 16. and that house and thy kingdom God's speaking to David shall be established forever oh I'd say the devil broke out in a cold sweat wouldn't you God never said this to Saul now remember he's already under the abrahamic Covenant but now God is making a covenant in particular God made a covenant with the church for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved that is a Covenant of Grace but God made another Covenant with the bride anyone who wants to be saved can be saved but God made a covenant with her before you ever knew me I foreordained you before the foundation of the world and I have established you as being part of me before the world ever began hallelujah oh praise the Lord thy Throne shall be established forever Psalms 89 1. my skill of Isam the ephrasite I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever with my mouth so I make known Thy Faithfulness to all generations for I have said Mercy shall be built up forever Thy Faithfulness shall thou establish in the very heavens I have made a covenant with my chosen I have sworn unto David my servant wow so God has got a chosen among the chosen I'm glad to be the chosen but just to be honest with you I'm glad to be the chosen among the chosen some folks are the Frozen among the chosen but I want to be the chosen Among The Chosen no cheer well that's what you get when you get you know six foot icicles in the pulpit and you get refrigerator preachers what do you get ice cubes in the pews well that's what refrigerators do they they make cold church members they make cold church services I'll tell you one thing I I don't want no cold church service myself I'm not looking for ice cubes that you all sit there and sat there like this and never worship God and never move an eyebrow never move your hands and never move nothing and I stand up here and I rotate like this and then I rotate back this way and if somebody brought a microwave to church we'd all be scared to death because it would humble us all down and we would melt in the presence of the microwave we're not looking for a microwave but we're looking for the presence of the pillar of fire with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll come in and set us free and heal the sick and baptize with the Holy Ghost and save the Lost Hallelujah and we'll raise the Dead one day and change our mortal bodies [Applause] so naturally that makes refrigerators and ice cubes quite uncomfortable I have made a covenant with my chosen I have sworn unto David now you realize part of these are prophetic in a double way speaking to David but also the Messianic David well let me just go ahead and drop it for you you say Joseph was of the lineage of David but on the line of Solomon and there was a king that was so vile and so rotten that God said never again well I allow one of those seeds to set on my throne but Mary was also of Joseph or of David rather but she come from the Nathan line now Nathan was David and bathsheba's third son named after the prophet Hallelujah so God allows Christ Jesus to come through the Nathan side not the solomonic side no doubt the devil thought when God said that in the Old Testament I have destroyed the Messianic prophecy I have annihilated it because now the son of David can never be born I have destroyed the solomonic view but God had it coming through another side the bride's side whoa Hallelujah he had it covered not through Joseph but through Mary Hallelujah remember she's the fifth woman in the genealogy of Christ written in Matthew Luke records the Joseph side but all Matthew records Mary side the bride's side hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] that's what you call sovereignty sovereignty means that God can step in in urgent situations and bring his own word to pass in his own way and nothing can stop it well glory be to God that's the way you and I got saved that's the way you and I got the Holy Ghost that's the way you and I come to the word of the hour that's the way we'll be raptured Divine sovereignty will thus surround the body change I have made a covenant with my chosen I have sworn under David thy seed when I establish forever and build up thy throne to all Generations verse 34. my Covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips once I have sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David Isaiah 55 3. and climb your ear and come unto me here in your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure Mercies of David I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure Mercies of David and this is after Uriah this is after the incident with Bathsheba how can this continue repentance and a covenant to The Chosen among the chosen you see the loving kindness and the extended mercies to David gives a covenant which can never be altered never it's the Everlasting Covenant notice in Psalms 132 11 the Lord has sworn in truth unto David and he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thython God God almighty God tells a man from your body I will come and sit on the throne then tell me how many Devils Out of Hell could stop that well let me just go ahead and say I don't care how much David messed up I don't care how many shortcomings David had God but turn the man around now did that mean that he could do whatever he wanted to do absolutely not he paid and he paid for years but that Covenant cannot be broken so is the Covenant with the bride of Christ it is a covenant that's just as Eternal as he is himself Hallelujah all glory to God you see the sure mercies of David are they loving and merciful promises that God will extend down into that Messianic line to establish an everlasting Kingdom that will never end and give peace and happiness to Israel notice in Acts 13 33 speaking about the Lord Jesus being raised from the dead God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he has raised up Jesus again and it is also written in the second Psalm Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he sat on this wise I will give you the sure Mercies of David oh so the sure mercies of David from Isaiah 55 3 extended right on down from the Old Testament to the New Testament and when God raised up Christ from the dead the sure mercies of David was continuing on and you know why we're saved today the sure mercies of David not King David of the Old Testament King Jesus of the new but what is it it's through the extension of the son of David of the fruit of his body already he's setting on the throne of our hearts this day through what the sure mercies of David don't you understand as the bride of Christ how could the church ages go into such Darkness they would put him out and he would still be merciful the sure mercies of David but not King David of the Old Testament but the David of lacks chapter 13. I know we save today the show mercies of our David is it any wonder that whenever they come into the City and they needed something they'd cry out oh Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me amen Hallelujah Hallelujah so the sure mercies of David extended over the Seal of Rome when they roll the stone over that grave and put the Signet of Rome God said I will extend the sure mercies of David can you imagine on that third Moon death checked in with Satan Satan checked in with death hey death how is it everything's good well cool our modern terminology we're good no shaking disciples are tore all to pieces the church is divided 47 ways Peter's gone by fish and the others are doing this that and the other we're good Hallelujah but remember God had said of the fruit of thy body while I set upon thy throne and I will extend this your mercies of David unto him but all of a sudden I can see an eyebrow maybe a finger what was it David was waking up Hallelujah he had done took a journey down into hell of course in the form of theophany and he knocked on the door of gate the gates of hell down there preached of the souls that was in prison went over to hell and knocked on the door of hell and Satan come to the door I said ah you have arrived have you he said yes I am here my blood is still hot on Calvary so what I'm glad to see you I thought I got you when I killed Abel I thought I'd got you when I tried to kill them children down there under the reign of pharaoh I thought I got you when I got Jeremiah but now I finally got you Jesus could have come back and said yeah now that you've got me what are you going to do with me because you can't handle what I've got so he reaches inside Hallelujah he reaches insides and jokes the keys off of hell and Satan ain't even got the keys to his own house and Jesus took the keys of death and hell and the grave I'm smoking and marijuana and depression and sadness inside trouble and hardly why the sure mercies of David are extended right up through the resurrection Satan how's it on your side always good he paid me a little visit took the keys that's okay we'll get some more made but he kind of disappeared I ain't seen him in a day or so I'm not and I'm not sure exactly where he went but all I do know was actually left here I heard a bunch of shouting and screaming over in Paradise so I kind of figured he got amongst them Holy Rollers over them they started having Church hallelujah oh that's the way it is when Jesus shows up the prophet said there's always a bunch of noise where Jesus is Oh Glory you imagine knocking on the door and Abraham comes to the door and he opens the door he said Sarah Sarah come look see who it is it's him that come and met us that day and Ezekiel got up and said my lord it's that wheel in the middle of the wheel and then Jeremiah said this and I hear somebody way in the back said make way make way my name is we've had my name is David and said my son is that my lord inside my resurrection I have been waiting Hallelujah glory to God what must God fixing to do extend the sure mercies of David through David oh thank you Lord laughs Hallelujah so I actually finally got him calmed down a little bit they say my children we're going to make a little Whistle Stop I need to stop up and see my young ones up there on the other side Abraham said he said okay if we walk around a little oh sure just go ahead we'll meet again a couple of days so Abraham and Sarah went down through your career you know they could travel like a thought so that thought about being in career in the two that it wasn't a career and then the thing being back about you know Jerusalem it's cool there was it wow what a beautiful land he told me hey did someone says y'all this is something you know go by the cave of Matt Taylor no I don't want to go back there we've been raised from the dead oh what's he doing up there making himself known to his brothers Matthew 27 53. the most bodies of those Saints which slept a rose and entered with him in his resurrection the sure mercies of David went beyond a natural throne it went into hell it went into Paradise and emptied it Paradise has had a For Lease sign on it for two thousand years nobody else needs to go there Hallelujah why the sure mercies of David I once was lost but now I'm found how am I found the sure mercies of David you was blind now you see how the sure mercies of David not King David of the Old Testament but Jesus David oh thou son of David have mercy on me ah let me share a few more things with the former class watch this years and years even hundreds of years after David is gone David is the model by which kings are judged First Kings 11 4 and it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect but the Lord his God that's what's the heart of David was the king standard First Kings 11 6 Solomon did Eve on the side of the Lord and went not fully out to the Lord I steal David his father this is after repentance for those of you that have done terrible wrongs and you feel like you can never be the same you can never be restored that's alive the devil this is after Bathsheba this is after Uriah why First Kings 11 11 wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee and thou has not kept my Covenant my statutes which I've commanded Thee I will surely Rim the Kingdom from thee and will give it unto thy servant notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake God is still doing things because of his friendship with David and David ain't even here no more wouldn't that be an awesome testimony to have that you live your life and you complete your life and you finish it and you're gone in the sixth Dimension and you've been gone from the earth for years and God is still doing things based upon your friendship oh foreign Church the other day hands up our praying praying for different folks that was sick just loving the Lord just worshiping him just praising him and the spirit of God spoke to me and said a bride stay active she has sparked of my godhead I reacted about like you Lord have mercy foreign mortar off my hands wiped it off on my britches got my phone typed in deity in you first sermon I find it deity of Jesus Christ 1949. deity is no longer in heaven but it's in you deity is not in a Manger he has a covenant which is this is why hell hates you oh hell hated Saul hell hey diminutive Kings but can you imagine hell hated David if he could stop that seed coming through David he could stop the Messiah if he can stop there being a bride in every age there cannot be a rapture don't you see the Rapture is not a word it's an event concerning people of the book so if Satan can pull people in every generation away from the word and if he will not have a bride to present himself there's no need in having a rapture but he's done I'll notice it's done too late I'll set this down too late hallelujahs don't been declared in the world there is going to be a rapture hallelujah it's in the future to be that's what Believers believe oh notice this in verse 12 not withstanding and thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake but I will Rend it out of the hand of thy son verse 13 hellbid I will Rend away notice how he says that all the kingdom but will give One Tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen verse 34 albeit I will not take the whole Kingdom out of his hand now notice one king I draw another after another isn't it amazing that through this davidic line it's like Satan bombards him bombards him with evil and wickedness why is it Satan knows that's the line that the Messiah is supposed to come to her so he tries to corrupt every one of them and nearly done it praise the Lord go ahead devil your mouse will get out your white flag and surrender because the end's already been declared in this battle and we win all right we can read in the back of the book we win this war how bad I'll now take the whole Kingdom out of his hand but I will make him Prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake whom I chose verse 35 but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it to thee even ten tribes and unto his son will I give one tribe that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem well Satan challenged Billy Graham's message no doubt no doubt when Oral Roberts started out sincere this out the other men these other men Satan challenged him but there ain't never been a challenge like against this Malachi full message why it's the bride message the body change in message but God has reserved himself a seed for the Rapture which will be a light not only before him but before that prophet of Malachi 4 every preacher that still standing up in the pulpit and preaching the truth is a light in Johnson City a light down in Minden Louisiana a light up in Chicago alive in Harare Zimbabwe a lot in Kenya a light in Tanzania a lie all around the world someone said of one man going around now God's got men everywhere churches filed up everywhere brothers that just talked to someone yesterday brother bear called for their intanzania talked to his son and right now they're going out among the Village People the Messiah is the name of them maybe you may not know their culture but to write down the maasa and they went out and drove like eight hours to get out in a village of 30 or 40 of them and they've received the message of the hour you imagine there's a light right out in the middle of Tanzania in the middle of King you're out in the middle of nowhere Hallelujah they ain't got no electricity they ain't got no air conditioners Ain't Got No 10 television thank God they ain't got no internet but somehow somebody took the gospel of the end time and God's got a light out there in the mosamora God's got a light in Johnson City and the holiday here God's got a light over here over there over there over there why because he will not allow his word to fall to the crowd he's saving the end time word for his prophet's sake and for his son's sake and for his name oh foreign First Kings 4 7 go tell jeroboam thus saith the Lord God of Israel for as much as I exalted thee from among the people and made thee Prince Over My People Israel rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to thee yet thou Hast not been as my servant David who kept my Commandments who followed me with all his heart to do only that which was right in mine eyes what how can God say that some of y'all are happy today now ain't you we got we got David redeemed y'all leave out here shouting say praise God I always wanted to meet him you'll meet him God said he always done that how can God say such a thing of a repentant believer and everlasting friends if God had not ordained there would not be a a bride program said he would be a mighty discouraged person if he did not believe in election or predestination if God had not ordained it this way Satan would have absolutely contaminated every one of us don't send her look at me like you're some self-righteous something another look at all of our mistakes in our shortcomings I ain't talking tom having you as a sinner I'm talking about since you got saved many of you since you got the Holy Ghost why can't he take us the same reason that he couldn't that day right down the road a few miles he went and created a body and put on Humanity Gabriel Michael and I start walking up the road the prophet tells us them is there anything too hard for the Lord and tell us in 1960 let's just say that Sarah got up that day in a bad mood there's running out of food for the cattle and the water was low all kinds of things going on she told Abraham she said Abraham I seen miss a lot down there the other day why she had some of the nicest dresses and she had this and that and that that Caravan from Hollywood Egypt Hollywood the same thing that caravanimate they took this nest and I want you to look at me I mean here I am I've got a lot where I had this old long hair and I've got this long dress and I've got this and other he said little did she know the Lord was coming right up the road so here he comes and whenever he speaks Abraham here said what's the voice I've heard all my life and Sarah like the bride laughed and God said what is your life she said I never done it you mean call God a liar to his face the prophet said why didn't God kill her because her her husband had a covenant you know how Donnie Reagan ain't done dead you know why y'all ain't done dead wiped off the Earth because her husband has a covenant our lord Jesus is our covenant maker and our covenant keeper don't you love him today the sure of mercies of David asparagus together Heavenly fathers we contemplate the things that we've heard today we're asking you Lord Jesus that you would help us Lord we have all fallen short of your glory so many times sometimes in the midst of Trials and tests we've tried to believe and yet fear but overwhelm us and we would worry that you wouldn't show up or a doctor's report would give us a bad scan or a bad test and fear would grip our hearts but you were merciful to us sometimes we act like you've never even moved for us before and yet you've moved thousands of times in our lives we thank you for it we thank you your forgiveness extends to us Lord even when we fail to believe help us Jesus Lord God I pray for those that are here present those that have streamed the service maybe some sick some weary maybe Lord there's some that's actually find themselves in that state similar to David maybe they haven't done what he did but they just find churches such a burden form living for you is such a difficult thing Lord they don't want to go to hell they don't want to be lost but they feel like they're acting they feel like they're just putting on something because you're just having to press and press may they be able to scan and search their heart today and say like David did restore unto me the joy of thy salvation Lord God open our ears that we can hear Joy a preacher can preach until he blew in the face as we would say but if our ears aren't open to hear those words and those quotes and scriptures to lift us up it won't do us any good help us father would you move among us today Lord father we pray for those that are sick we know have different ones with coveted flu various things some Lord fever and just so much going around God we pray for each of them today father God in the name of Jesus May the sure mercies of David of the New Testament be extended to us Hallelujah we know Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we know Lord Jesus after the great marriage supper the bride and the groom have been United by an invisible Union we know that but one day we will be United physically in that we will have a body like yours when we finally arrive in that flesh glorified flesh the product of that Union between the bride and the groom will be the millennium the son of David hallelujah hallelujah we know Lord that after David repented and made this thing as right as he couldn't make it in the Old Testament then the Bible says David went into his wife Bathsheba to comfort her and you gave them a son and she called his name Solomon but you renamed him and you called him Jedediah Jedediah beloved of the Lord he was called five or six different titles we know in the Old Testament he called himself the preacher referred to himself as Lemuel different names titles nor do we know one day after our Union has been consummated the son of David will set up his throne upon the Earth and we will walk out on the ashes of the wicked the Millennium could not be produced after the opening of the seals the Millennium could not happen after we got the Holy Ghost it had to happen after the marriage supper of the Lamb thank you Lord Jesus Solomon could not have been the firstborn because she called him the son of her vows but her first child was born under broken vows but Solomon was the son of her vows glory to God so is the millennium the product of the vows between the bride and the groom and the vows you made to the son of David in Psalms ask of me for thine inheritance the heathen and I will give it thee and you will set upon the throne of David and it's awesome to think about you will be there the king and the Bible tells us in the Old Testament that David himself will be among us a prince so the davidic Covenant will be lived right out in the millennium so we'll go up to the throne and be worshiping and praising and there will come King David I'm sure Harry's going to be there and all these musicians and all the musicians down through time that's played for you but boy how they'll want to lay down their organs and their guitars and their Steals and whatever more when little David comes up and says Brothers y'all join me here let's play a millennium song Hallelujah Hallelujah that old day they'll have to walk away from the throne and look back at the throne and there was set the Lord Jesus in a glorified body Hallelujah and he will be called the son of David what an honor that David will walk among us and we'll go around shaking his hand hugging his neck and calling him Prince and we'll say David you're going to go up to worship the David they say yeah let's go out and worship David praise the Lord Lord this is not a fairy tale it's a true reality of your word May there not be a one of us missing if that day Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus oh praise the Lord praise the Lord God praise the Lord God we worship you Lord Jesus can we just raise
