[music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; How many's glad you're a sign of the cross and that Calvary was a success? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; If you would have known me way back [music and singing] then and how I used to live, [music] it would be easy to See, it was all about me. I [singing] had nothing to do. But I [music] remember the day [singing] I found grace and a hole in my heart was filled. Now [music] I'm a [singing] brand new man because of nail pierced hands hanging on Calvar's [music] hill. I'm just a sign of the cross. Not perfect, just [music] dreaming. You see, I once was lost. But God's blood was shed [music] for me. Nothing I done, it's all God's [music and singing] son hanging on Calvary Street. Jesus [singing] paid my call. I'm just a sign [music and singing] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; It's easy [music] to see I'm a simple man that fits the glove [music] of a wondering soul that just didn't know about God's love. But now I've seen the light [music] because he's opened my eyes from the darkness. I've been set free. Now for the rest of my days, I [music] just want to stay kneeling at my Savior's feet. I'm [music and singing] just a sign of the cross. Not [music and singing] perfect, just redeemed. You see, I once [music] was lost, but God's blood was shed [music] for me. Nothing I've done, it's all God's son hanging [music and singing] on Calvar's tree. Jesus made my call. I'm just a sign of the cross. Nothing I've done. [singing] It's all [music] God's son hanging on Calvar's tree. Jesus paid my cost. I just decided [music] the cross. Yeah, he [singing] paid my cost. I'm just a side [music] of the cross. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, &gt;&gt; you remember the little boy coming down the street one day and he went inside the bar and he told the owner. He said, "Sir, your sign's down." So he walks out there and looks at it and said, "Sunny." Took his rag and polishes his sign. He said, "You must be mistaken. My sign's not down." He said, "But I mean your best sign." And the drunk was laying in the gutter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody's a sign today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sign of grace. Sign of mercy, sign of forgiveness. I want to be a sign of God's love and mercy. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a baby dedication today. Brother Jake and Sister Lydia, if they'll bring a little baby girl, we'll dedicate her to the Lord today. Praise the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Bring them [singing] in. Bring them in [music] from the [singing] fields of sin. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bring them in. Bring [music and singing] them in. Bring the [music] little ones to Jesus. [singing] Wow. Oh, ain't that a beautiful little thing? &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, what a great gift that you've given to my brother and sister. With it comes such an awesome responsibility. I believe they are willing today to assume that responsibility to be able to take their little daughter to raise her in a way the best to their ability that would please you. We know that our children much of what they will become in life is greatly affected by us as parents and adults that affect them. So I pray Lord Jesus that your grace would be upon her. Lord if time should get should have enough time and get old enough. May her heart be surrendered to you when she's young before the evil days come upon her. I pray for her mother the fifth gospel. Help her Lord Jesus to be able to influence her. I pray for her father. May she be able to see a godly man, a man that loves Jesus. May she be able to hear prayers and music and all sorts of godly input in her life. Keep her from the evils of the day and the darkness of the hour that we're living in. Lord Jesus, I dedicate her life to you today for a life service in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Congratulations. [applause] Can we stand together? Second Peter chapter 1 verse 2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world, world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. Let's bow our heads together as we pray over the word today. Heavenly Father, we believe what we have read here today are your great words. You inspired men that they would be able to write the Bible. We know and are able to hear as we turn from page to page, chapter to chapter, book to book that these words are not the words of mere mortal men. their thoughts from a great creator, the only one who could put such things together. Then we call on you today to help us. It'll take your same inspiration to help us to believe it. And then once we believe it, to listen to it and to accept it and live it. For we know that our lives need to be daily sermons, constant sermons after we become Christians, that we're living a life that is pleasing to you. Speak to us today once again from your word. Father, we ask in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. [clears throat] So happy we could be together today. Aren't you glad to be able to come to church? &gt;&gt; What a great privilege it is for us as the people of God. And what an honor it is to be able to assemble ourselves together in in his in his presence. But not only in his presence, but actually in one another's presence. What a great thing it is for people to understand. I realize for a lot of people, church is just going to church. It's a social thing. they don't really get that much out of it. Uh they go to see one another, visit one another, exchange their business ideas and different things like that of what they've done during the week. But I'm so grateful that God is God of people who understand why we go to church and the reason of it. And well, you know, we've been looking at it and I want to go back that way just a little bit today on the attribute and the aspect of godliness. And God loves to go to church himself. God loves to be where his children are, where his people are that he can be able to assemble together with them in order to do things for them. Because the way God looks at it, there's always been special places on the earth that have been set aside for his honor and his glory. The most fought over city on the face of the earth. Jerusalem been taken over and over again. Conquered by every man, every potentate that was coming to take the east. They always wanted Jerusalem as a prize. Still is today. The most sought out place that has ever been on the face of the earth. Why? Because God loves it so much. And we know then that there's a spiritual answering to that, a parallel to that of us being able to come together in the house of God. Whether it's a place like this, this size, whether it be this size over here, u God does not so much impressed by whether there's stained glass windows and gold on the altar, whether there's fine fancy woodwork. What what really gets God's attention is when people come together with a divine purpose, that is to worship him. to worship him and to hear from him that they can see their shortcomings and find out how to be better people. How many came for that reason today? And we know the Lord Jesus himself actually went to church whenever he was here on the earth. And he never found an actual ideal church whenever he was here. You can imagine living now in the first century. So they had synagogues. So Jesus went to the synagogue at Capernium and I told you Carol and I stood there several years ago and they had dug down several feet and found that original Roman era synagogue and they just recently found another city there called Basadia where Peter and Andrew and them different ones are from and it's quite an amazing thing when you think that the Lord Jesus would have went to such a place that was far from imperfect. Nobody ever got saved. Nobody ever got healed. Nobody ever got delivered. But Jesus went to church anyhow, which is a pretty good example, I think, for us as his children. I don't mind telling you before we go further into this today that there would that would be a real difficult time for me to go to some churches and make that my home church. If there was churches that was teaching ideology that was contrary to the word of God, it would be very hard for me to go there. I I don't mind. I'll go a little farther. It would be hard for me to go to some message churches and make them my home church because some of them are so far off of the beaten paths of the word of God. But I will say this, and I was thinking about it earlier this morning. I'm just so grateful that God has allowed us to be able to have a place where we can come together, worship him, see God, not only read about what God did, but see God doing the same things that he's always done. And I trust that we always count that a great honor. In Luke 4:1 16, speaking of Jesus, he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and as his custom was. Now, Luke wasn't actually there, of course, at the birth of the Lord Jesus. And Luke wasn't one of the original 12. Luke actually came in years afterwards. So, Luke must have found this out. Part of it by divine inspiration, but part of it by going around and talking to people that was around Jesus. So Luke had found this out somehow that it was the custom of the Lord Jesus to go to church. So it wasn't something that Jesus visited, you know, twice a year, three times a year, but a custom was something that you do over and over and over again. Now, can you imagine going to church over and over and over and over and over again? You saw nobody healed, nobody saved, nobody delivered, but you kept on going anyhow. Would you do that? &gt;&gt; Now, you see, Jesus went because he knew there was one good thing that he could get out of the service. He heard the word being read. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, would that be worth it to us to get up, get ready, and drive to church just to hear the word be read? &gt;&gt; Wow. Now, you see what that shows me? It shows me that Jesus had a reverence and an honor and a sacredness for church that most of us don't have. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; The sacredness was knowing God's word was going to be there and that it was going to be read. But many folks go to church out of selfish ideas. What am I going to get? What am I going to take from the service? How am I going to be helped? Are they going to sing my songs? My favorite preacher going to preach? And church really ain't about God. And it's not really about them ministering to others. It's about will the service suit them &gt;&gt; and will their favorite people and I hope sister so and so is wearing that dress and I hope brother Donnie wears that suit I like. And you know is brother Donnie preaching today? Oh, I hope he is because if he ain't there, I'm not sure I can get anything. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; If the word of God is going to be read and the preacher, you may not get five five words out of what he has to say, but if he reads one scripture, you ought to be saying, "Boy, wasn't that scripture awesome? Wasn't them quotes he read, wasn't that absolutely awesome? Wasn't it wonderful to shake the saints of God's hands? Wasn't it something to be there?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. I think sometimes we need a little bit instruction maybe on church. Now, I want you to listen to this. I love the way the prophet said this. He says, "And I say you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through till the Holy Ghost sets her soul on fire. There's no signing cards. God's in their heart. God, he loves to worship." Amen. God's in their heart. God goes to church. He loves to worship. Now, I read this one and the next one I'm fixing to read you the last time we spoke on this, but it's so good. Now, you've got tapes on that. You've got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline of the church, how we behave oursel in the church of God. But of course this quote cannot apply to you if you don't come to church &gt;&gt; because the tapes was not on how to behave yourself in your house &gt;&gt; but how you behave yourself in church. So this is one quote that a lot of the message people will never have to worry fulfilling will they since they don't come to church &gt;&gt; and they see no need in it. &gt;&gt; Oh my praise the Lord. Now watch this. How we behave oursel in the church of God. How we got to come together here together and set together in heavenly places. Got to Got to &gt;&gt; don't stay home. &gt;&gt; Now you tell me how people say they believe this is the voice of God on these tapes. And I'll tell you what, they are liars. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about people that ain't got a church in their community to go to. I ain't talking about people that are invalid and people that are sick that their desire is to be in the house of God. I'm talking about people that could go and won't go. &gt;&gt; They're liars. &gt;&gt; I do not care what their name is. I don't care how long they've been in the message. And they say this is the voice of God. They are liars. And all liars go to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. and word of life said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, tell us the truth. Brother Donnie, if God is in your heart, you see that's the problem. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, can you imagine if you get into sports, baseball, basketball, whatever your deal is about sports and all that. My goodness, in Tennessee is playing, we'll say Tennessee is playing against Kentucky AND BOY, YOU'RE THERE for Tennessee and and then the Mayo, you get a free ticket. You and your wife and your youngans all get free tickets and you don't know how you got them. and you get free tickets and you've got the best place in the building or coliseum or whatever it is. I don't know anything about all that stuff, but you get all that and you're say, "Well, should we go? Honey, what do you think? I hate to go there. There ain't no telling how many homosexuals will be there. There ain't no telling how many perverts, how many liars, how many people drinking beer, smoking cigarette, chewing tobaca, cursing, lying. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to go, do you, honey? But it's Tennessee against Wildcats, you know, and they said this is the biggest game of the year and and they give us these free tickets, but it would be an ungodly atmosphere for us to go. Some of y'all as guilty as a hound dog in the hen house. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all's blushing. I ain't seen you blush in a while. Would you let the homosexuals, the adulterers, the liars, the perverters keep you from that ball game? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, you do let them keep you from going to Walmart, right? &gt;&gt; So, all of you now, you order your groceries from Walmart cuz it's such an ungodly atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And yet, if people won't speak to us, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; We don't like this, we don't go to church. We don't like that, we don't go to church. &gt;&gt; Preach it. And the Lord Jesus purchased tickets for every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be held accountable for not using your ticket. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder to get in there and fellowship with your brother. So you see, going to church is not just about God in the sense of you hearing the word and you just worshiping him and you just singing to him. It's also about fellowship &gt;&gt; with your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it's time you got to praying. Cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Amen. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Notice this message entitled the token. &gt;&gt; We should love one another more than we ever did in all of our lives. There should be such a hunger to get to church. &gt;&gt; Notice the title token. There should be such a hunger to get to church. There should be such a hunger for us to get to one another. &gt;&gt; It should be a love affair. &gt;&gt; Not just with you and God, &gt;&gt; but with you and your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been missing brother Louie and Sister Glenda Sabath. &gt;&gt; Weren't y'all glad to see him up here today? [applause] There ought to be something in us godly. Notice again in who is Jesus, we should assemble ourselves together. The Bible tells us that as we see the end approaching, not of forsaking the assembling of ourselves together. It'll it'll not only do that, it'll strengthen you and your strengths will strengthen the church. Can't you see why Satan don't want people to go to church? &gt;&gt; So, your strengths will strengthen me. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you rob me. And you rob those around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not only robbing yourself, you're robbing us. &gt;&gt; How many robbers will there be in heaven? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Wow, man. This makes me want to have a church revival. All right. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this in question answers. You see, when the prophet went to Arizona, there was a bunch of the message people that moved out there with him. But he didn't start a church. &gt;&gt; So, the people had the tapes, they had the books, but they also had the prophet himself. but they didn't have a church to go to. Now, a lot of people would think that was the ideal setting, but I want you to listen what happened to those message people that were in that setting. Now, I know a lot of times I speak of the Calvinistic belief. Now, don't think that that lets you loose to do anything you want to do. A fellow the other day, I said, "Did you go to church?" He said, "I went hunting. The man's wife come to me and she's coming from the laundromat on Sunday. I said, "Why didn't you go to church?" She said, "I done my washing." I said, "You shouldn't have done that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, this is supposed to be the voice of God on tape. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Well, she said, "I'm not an old legalist." I said, &gt;&gt; "But I saw you were a Christian." &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice this is a message woman &gt;&gt; and they're there around the prophet himself. But because they didn't have a church to go to, it started working on their attitude. &gt;&gt; Now watch, when you lose the sacredness of church and you lose the sacredness of his presence, you also start losing the sacredness of the resurrection. You see, don't never forget one of the reasons that we come to church on Sunday is to honor the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So when you don't do that and you see no need to do it, you start actually dishonoring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it goes to losing its value. Now he said, "But I thought you were a Christian." She see I said, "Do you know you're putting a stumbling block in somebody's way?" &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe this and I don't have to do those things. I'm not a legalist. Well, but look, my brother, sister, look here. Paul said, "If eating meat puts a stumbling block in my brother's way, I'll eat meat no more as long as the world stands." Right. &gt;&gt; And I think that'd be a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Now watch. So brother Perry Green and many of you know the history of the message, how it come about there in the west. Brother Perry Green went there and there was assembly of God church and they merged together with another church. So it left this building vacant and empty. Brother Green goes in there and starts a church. Now brother Brandham comes and he wants him in the dedication part. So this is his subject that he deals with and notice his title. What house will you build for me? And now that brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe in, we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service and take every place that we can. I wonder why brother Brandham didn't turn it into a tape only church. Now, if that was the perfect way and that was God's provided way, as we're hearing it said over and over and over again now, that this is God's way for us to hear tapes only, then wonder why Brother Brandham was not the founder of that move. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't. &gt;&gt; The founding of that was not God's prophet, &gt;&gt; cuz he was a scriptural prophet. And if this message come to turn our hearts back to the original faith, do you think they sat at home and read Paul's books? &gt;&gt; Preach, brother Donnie. Do you think they sat at home and looked one another, you know, and just said, "What are you going to do today?" Well, I'm going over to the coliseum to watch the games. &gt;&gt; I'm going here. I'm going there. They went to church. &gt;&gt; Even though in the first century it could have cost them their life. But they went anyway, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that he's encouraging the messaged people at that time what to do about this church. If we are asked and called on to pray, to seek, to do, let's be soldiers. Let's be anxious to do it. Keep the message &gt;&gt; honorable. &gt;&gt; Amen. and live the right kind of life. Don't let no smut. &gt;&gt; It's sad a lot of message people never read this quote &gt;&gt; or they never believed it after they read it. Don't let no smut come upon it. We're living too late now. We're too late in the hour. Let's live it clean. Anybody agree with that today? &gt;&gt; My life, your life, all of our lives need to be picked up before God. Now watch. He's going to tell us what the message people had got into in that Tucson area with no church to go to. &gt;&gt; Our young people just ride around from place to place, show to show, &gt;&gt; right? message people &gt;&gt; and they had not just the tapes, not just the books, the prophet of God was there with them, too. &gt;&gt; And this is what they had got into. Why church didn't mean nothing. Well, brother Brandham made a preaching. I ain't going I ain't going that old ASSEMBLY OF GOD. I AIN'T going here. I ain't going there. And little did they know, Satan was taking the preciousness of honoring the resurrection away from them. &gt;&gt; So the women went to the laundromat. The men went hunting on Sunday. The kids rode around on their bicycles and went from show to show to show. And they're trying to tell everybody, "YOU WANT WHAT I GOT? Y'ALL are blind. Y'all a bunch of leans. You got to come AND FOLLOW US." WELL, WHERE DO YOU GO TO CHURCH? WE DON'T BELIEVE IN GOING TO CHURCH. WE GO TO the laundromat. And you think you're a light &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus help us. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my young people just ride around from place to place, from show to show and drifting further and further away &gt;&gt; from God. Notice he didn't say from the tapes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say from the prophet. &gt;&gt; From God. Now that's the truth. I see it in my children. &gt;&gt; So you mean the Brandom family was not exempt from drifting &gt;&gt; because they didn't have a church? &gt;&gt; Oh, you ain't going to hear this preached by very many. I know you're certainly not going to hear this promoted from headquarters, but I'm called to preach all the message. [applause] I ain't cutting no corners for nobody. It's time that we fess up. Do we believe this is the truth or are we a bunch of rotten, sorry hypocrites? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many message preachers run across across this very quote and they will not read it cuz they don't want to cause nobody hurt feelings? Well, I don't want to hurt your feelings either, but I'd rather hurt your feelings now than for you to go to hell and you point your finger at me and God say, "You're guilty, preacher." [applause] Mhm. Oh my. I see it in my children. COME ON, PROPHET OF GOD, BE HONEST WITH US. &gt;&gt; I see it &gt;&gt; myself. You mean brother Brandham needed Harry to go to church? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message? Praise God. Does this sound like a hypocrite to you? Does this sound like a guy that's trying to hide things from you? This guy exposed his own family and exposed himself. &gt;&gt; I can follow such a man. You've got to assemble yourselves together TO WORSHIP GOD. THE BIBLE said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we see this day approach and that much more come together. If there's only two people there, &gt;&gt; you be one of them. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we come together and worship together, then we're just something another about it. Jesus said, "Well, there's two or three gathered in my name, there I am in their midst." &gt;&gt; Trying to do God a service. He's in Freeport now. But this time, people had already began to misunderstand things that Brother Random had said. So he he was calling the people out from from systems and denominations and people were taking quotes that he said remember this is about a year after what he said in question answer 64 and you're in 3 months something like that four months so he had already picked up on it that it was starting to follow the followers of the message that the followers of the message thought well they don't need to go to church they don't have to go to church so they were isolating quotes and pulling them out and saying Well, brother Brandham said, "Come out of church. Come out of church." Now, watch what God's having him to say. This is just a month and a half or so, or a month actually before he he's taken from the earth. The handwriting is on the wall. The second coming is at hand. The bride is being chosen, watered out. Now, that don't mean draw out from church. Now, watch. It's amazing that now he's going to insert this just a little while before he leaves the earth. Why? The spirit of God has already brought his attention to it that some of the message people are taking these quotes and they're making it sound like you don't need to go to church no more. So the Holy Ghost said, "Let's go ahead and take care of this before you leave." &gt;&gt; Amen. Not draw out from church. That means draw out from denominationalism. &gt;&gt; You must go to church. Everybody read this together with me now on three. One, two, three. You must go to church. &gt;&gt; Now, your own voice is on God's recording. &gt;&gt; Now, it just won't be me you'll hear at the day of judgment, but you'll hear yourself. I can quit now if y'all want me to, but I got a lot more [applause] &gt;&gt; now. YOU MUST GO TO CHURCH, BUT DON'T JOIN ANY ORGANIZATION. JESUS WENT &gt;&gt; all the organizations, &gt;&gt; but he never joined a one of them, &gt;&gt; MODERN EVENTS. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE CHURCH. WOW. I want you to go to church. Don't forsake to assemble yourself together. But what I'm trying to tell you to do is press into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And word of life said, &gt;&gt; now let's change. In order to be godly, we have to love what God loves and we have to hate what God hates. Now, this is a little bit, you know, this this would be a little bit difficult maybe for some people, but there are things that God absolutely hates. &gt;&gt; He despises. Now before we go on into this, let me reassure you that God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. &gt;&gt; God hates sin, but he loves the sinner. But there are some things that God detests, and it's actually an abomination to him. Read with me in Psalms 45:6. And this is a messianic psalm of the [clears throat] Old Testament. Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter. I'd like to preach these couple of verses to you sometime on a separate thing. But thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. This is a messianic psalm. And David is actually calling the Messiah God. This is one of the scriptures that the rabbis use. And when they believe that the Messiah will be God himself. So he said, "Thy throne, oh God." So he's calling the Messiah God. Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness. Therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. So the Messiah hates wickedness. I mean believes he hates sin. He hates ungodliness. All right. Now then if we are going to be like God, we must also be like God in love and in hatred. But we cannot hate upon our feelings being hurt by this certain individual or that individual and then we express hatred toward them out of hurt feelings or disappointment. There's only one source by which hatred can be perfect. &gt;&gt; That's from a godly heart. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. The only way you and I can hate sin in the right way is when our heart is right before God. Because if we're not careful every time, we will lump the sin with the sinner and we'll throw the baby out with the bathwater and we will develop something against the individual. And even though they may repent and make the situation right, we will never let it go in our mind. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, you thought going to church quotes was tough? You ain't heard nothing yet. But see, God is able and has the capability of being able to hate the sin. Oh, it's so vile in his sight. And yet, if the sinner repents of that sin, then God no longer holds that past against them. We need help to be able to do likewise. &gt;&gt; Now, watch. This is part of God's character, not dealing with angels, but dealing with humans. And we need to be godly, not only dealing with God, but godly dealing with our brothers and sisters and godly dealing with the lost world. Read with me in Proverbsap 6:1 16. Now I want you to listen to these things carefully. [snorts] These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay, seven are an abomination unto him. It do you good to keep these verses real close to you. &gt;&gt; A proud look. &gt;&gt; It might be safer for me to go back in my office and finish this sermon. &gt;&gt; So, six things that God hates. Yay. Seven are an abomination. Now, it's one thing for God to hate a thing and then for it to move into the abominable aspect of God looking at it as an abomination. So, God hates a proud look, &gt;&gt; a lying tongue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll pay everybody a penny a piece for amens from this point on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all must not have no lunch money. These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay. S seven are an abomination unto him. A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. &gt;&gt; Now remember, there's more than one way you can kill people. And you don't kill them necessarily in this day with a knife or a gun, but you kill their influence. You tell lies on them. You tell things to bring down their character. &gt;&gt; Oh my. A proud look, a lying tongue. I want you to notice he's not mentioning anything about homosexuality. &gt;&gt; And yet homosexuality is an abomination. Do you understand? A lying tongue is an abomination. Just like two men getting married, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; An abomination. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; an heart that devisth wicked imagination. So then a heart, notice he doesn't say a mind, but a heart. Why? Because out of the heart, Jesus picks this up in the New Testament. Out of the heart proceedth wicked, evil imaginations and on and on and on. You remember the the scripture. So a heart that would devise wicked imagination. So they think and they ponder over snares and over difficulties and over things that will cause people to to stumble. Now this is an abomination to God. Feet that be swift in running to mischief. So people then that they're fast. They're not slow held back by. They're just quick and doing what they can to to bring trouble and cause all kinds of heartaches and difficulties. That is an abomination to God. And you know what's difficult about it is some of these people right here might have long hair. They may wear long dresses. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Some of these people are here as message preachers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Any of you business brothers hiring this week? I might lose my job after today. Ah, a false witness that speaketh lies. So, A PERSON SAYING, "BROTHER DAVE SWANSON, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE THIS AND brother Maddie, he done that and that." And boy, brother Dave Swanson. Oh my. I'll tell you one thing. Do you understand? If you are bearing lies. &gt;&gt; Now, you might not have even made up the lie, &gt;&gt; but you're carrying somebody else's lie. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible tells us to be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath. A lot of our motor mouths &gt;&gt; need to shut up. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; a false witness that beareth wise, and he that sweth discord among brethren, &gt;&gt; an abomination to God. God actually hates these things. &gt;&gt; So a person that would try to go amongst our church or go amongst a a family and so discord, &gt;&gt; do you understand the way God feels about that? &gt;&gt; He hates it. &gt;&gt; Let you know wherever church splitting preacher stands then. &gt;&gt; Now I guess the question is how do you feel about him? So we love we love abominations if we love these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'd say the fell down at the Baptist church down the road got more amens than I got this morning. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 1:14. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hatest. They are a trouble. This is God talking now. Unto me. I am weary to bear them. And yet the new moons and the feast were things he gave them. &gt;&gt; So they were doing things that God gave them to do. But now God says, "I hate it. I HATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING." WHY, LANCE? You imagine they could come back and say, "But God, it's in your word. Your prophet said at the new moon and the Sabbath and and the feast to have a feast and dance before me and do what?" How could you do that? &gt;&gt; Because they lost the sacredness of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It just become ritual and routine. &gt;&gt; I don't want church to become that for us. I know some of you have wondered for years and years and other preachers have even asked me about it. Brother Donnie, why don't you have communion once a month? Cuz I've been to some of the churches who have communion once a month and I've seen the way they take it and it's no more than a ritual. &gt;&gt; It's like picking up a peanut butter cracker and drinking a glass of Kool-Aid to some of them. I do not want that. I am not going to have it in our church. I'll have it three times a year, four times a year, every other year. And if it gets to a spot to where that it's just common and ritual, we don't understand how sacred this is. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THE PROPHET SAID, I just finished a study this week. 342 times that the prophet uses the word sacred. 40some different times. Sacredness. Ah, I was overwhelmed by the things that I found. sacred desk, sacred pullpit, sacred word, sacred moment, sacred gifts, all the things that he said was sacred. As I studied them, I realized how that that element of sacredness is leaving our ranks. Oh, may God help us. That going to church will ALWAYS BE SACRED. THAT SINGING, clapping our hands, hearing the word read, oh my, living a Christian life, honoring the resurrection WILL ALWAYS BE SACRED. BECAUSE IF NOT, IF IN TIME GOES ON, GOD WILL SAY TO SOME OF THE MESSAGE PEOPLE, I HATE I HATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING. &gt;&gt; I HATE YOUR DEDICATING BABIES. I HATE THE WATER BAPTISMS. I HATE YOUR COMMUNION SERVICES. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU ARE DOING IT WITH no feeling, no love. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God even told him, "Your sacrifices are going to stink &gt;&gt; and my nose." &gt;&gt; Zechariah 8:1 17. Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath. For all these things that I hate, sayeth the Lord. Malachi 2:15, therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. Now remember marriage and divorce is very rampant at the end of the Old Testament age. The Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away. You know how God feels about divorce? He hates it. &gt;&gt; But in the age we live in. Yeah. Whatever. I made a mistake. I changed my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Lord of mercy. If you get any choir, the seats is going to start crying out. My my. For one coverth violence with his garments, sayaith the Lord of hosts. Therefore, take heed to your spirit that you deal not treacherously. Now, hate is a it's a difficult subject in studying. It's a difficult subject in bringing it together. AND YET, GOD WANTS HIS children to hate certain things. Notice my words. Things. Certain things. In Revelation 2:6, but thou but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Now notice how that this church that this is written to in the church age that they were displaying godliness and God wanted to make note of it because it meant so much to him. I can tell by the look of most of you on your face that you're puzzled by this. You think why? Why would that matter? Because to be like God is more than just hair and dress and jumping up and down and shouting. It's loving what God loves, hating what God hates. &gt;&gt; And God God wanted these people to know he was proud of them because they had moved into this attribute which very few ever will that they hate what God hates. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOTICE God amened their godly attribute. HERE IS GOD SAYING back to them, "Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE DOING RIGHT. YOU HATE NOTICE GOD DOESN'T say they hated the nickelans." Now remember this was people in this first church age which had already got under this thing and the prophet says they wanted to get away with that fanatical bunch of Christians speaking in tongues and all that sort of thing. BUT IT WAS ALSO THE ministry the CLERGY THAT WAS TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF God out of the people and make them the big man. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. BUT GOD WANTED EVERY PERSON in the church to HAVE HIS PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T WANT IT TODAY IN THIS MESSAGE FOR THE PASTORS AND THE PREACHERS to be the only one that God hears and the only one that God loves. God loves you and God wants to dwell IN YOU. GOD WANTS TO HEAR YOUR PRAYER. GOD WANTS TO LIVE IN YOUR soul just AS REAL AS HE DOES THE GREATEST preacher in this message. &gt;&gt; SO NOTICE GOD amens now hate. Ain't that strange? [snorts] But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickelans which I also hate. Verse 15. SO HAST THOU ALSO THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. NOW NOTICE we move to another church age. So it went from deeds. So they just kind of started among the people trying to divide them and separate them and pull them off to their little agenda. &gt;&gt; And God called it deeds. But already the saints of God, full of the Holy Ghost, THAT'S OF THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT ain't right. That's off the word. They're trying to pull people off the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this verse, God didn't comment them because they loved. But God commented because they hated, &gt;&gt; not people. &gt;&gt; So hast thou also THEM THAT HOLD THE DOCTRINE. So now it moves to the doctrinal stage of the nicicoatans which thing I hate. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice in this church age by the time it comes to them, God don't say to this bunch of overcomers that you all hate it too. But God said, "So hast thou also them that hold." So now by this church age they had let some of them people come among them. &gt;&gt; GOD CANNOT AMEN THEIR ACTION. BUT GOD IS TELLING THEM HIS GODLY VIEW. I HATE THIS THING. HOW CAN YOU all tolerate it &gt;&gt; and put your arm around their neck and hug them and oh praise God. God said I hate this thing. But you all have it among you. &gt;&gt; So God hated their deeds AND THEIR DOCTRINE. YOU SEE, GOD HATES [snorts] THE character and the ways of the wicked. And the feelings OF ALL OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUS, godly people are the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:3. AND I HATED ESAU. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Romans 9:13. AS IT IS WRITTEN, JACOB HAVE I LOVED, but Esau have I hated. Now you see the problem is that we when we read such scriptures we evaluate this word by the way we understand hate. &gt;&gt; So we think God hates like me. Uh-uh. No he does not. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not hate the way humans hate. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even mean what you think it does. &gt;&gt; Genesis 29:29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilha his handmade to be her maid. And he Jacob went in also unto Rachel. And he loved also Rachel more &gt;&gt; than Leah. and served him yet seven other years. But notice the key now to verse 30 is in actually verse 31. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated. Now wait a minute. Verse 30 didn't say that Jacob hated her. &gt;&gt; It said that he loved Rachel more. Now, I want you to keep in mind now the way God had Moses to write it. SO, WITH A GODLY hatred in the way that God looks at people and God say, "I love you. I hate you. I love you. I hate you. I love you. I HATE YOU." GOD CAN SAY, "I LOVE YOU." But then God can look at others and say, "But I love you more." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And God noted this in Genesis and said, let me read it to you again. And he went also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah. And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, or in other words, loved less, &gt;&gt; there you go, friends. Godly hatred does not hate like humans. It does not corrupt the heart. It is never reacting out of selfishness and vindictiveness at all. IT ACTUALLY BREAKS THE HEART OF the recipient, the one who has it. When they hate evil, it actually burdens them. It actually breaks the HEART FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE bound in wickedness and idolatry and sin. Now, we've all no doubt heard preachers preach from the pull pit. And ain't a question in my mind, some of them have preached out of hatred. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they ain't no question about they've been flat mad. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't mad at the devil. Sometimes it's mad at me. sometimes is mad at you. Sometimes he's mad at somebody else. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you know it as well as I know it that a preacher can stand up there and burn your hide. But you know that if that man loves you, he's doing that because of the love of God in his heart. You know that, right? You've experienced that. And then you've known others and you just felt like they throw this at you and throw that at you and you just felt some ain't right about that. Some just ain't right about it. And a lot of times it ain't right. They may be saying the truth, BUT IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE. THEY'RE SAYING IT OUT OF human anger, human vindictiveness. AND WHENEVER GOD SAYS, "I HATE THIS AND I HATE THAT." IT'S NOT FROM A HUMAN anger that God is mad. You are you broke MY WORD. YOU STEPPED ON MY WORD. I WANT TO GET BACK AT YOU. NO, THAT'S THE WAY US HUMANS DOES. BUT WHEN GOD SAYS, "I hate," he says, "I want you to be better." Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to be changed. So God loved Jacob more than he did Esau. Now watch this. In Luke 14 26, the words of the Lord Jesus himself. If any man will come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters. So you mean the requirement to be a Christian is to hate your daddy, hate your mother, hate your wife, hate your children. Oh, I saw the light come over some of you. Praise the Lord. You're smiling now, Brother Danny. Thank God. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; If any man COME TO ME AND HATE NOT HIS FATHER, NOW LET'S TAKE IT LITERALLY JUST LIKE JESUS said it. In order to be a Christian, YOU GOT TO HATE EVERYBODY around you. I know some people that sure would fulfill that easy enough. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And they ain't a Christian a bit more than the devil is. &gt;&gt; You know why? They can't do it from a godly heart. Jesus is not teaching us to hate OUR FATHER. JESUS IS NOT TEACHING TEACHING US TO HATE OUR MOTHER. HE'S teaching us to love them less. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love God's word. Don't you? Oh my. &gt;&gt; If any man come to me AND HATE NOT HIS father and mother and wife and children and BRETHREN AND SISTERS, YAY, AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO, he cannot be my disciple. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Matthew 10:37, he that loveth father or mother. You see, this is one of the great things about God having four gospels. &gt;&gt; For those of you that never really studied your Bible that much, you'd be surprised how many of these same instances are written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And all four of them will say it a little bit different way. and they're recalling the same story. &gt;&gt; Well, come on now. Folks have left the message for doing that. And I've sent quotes to a bunch of them in scriptures and told them if they don't quit believing the Bible, they're a bunch of hypocrites. Cuz the Bible is wrote the exact same way. &gt;&gt; Now, here, I want you to notice this. Now, Matthew is writing the same instance, but notice how he phrases it. He that loveth father or mother more [groaning] &gt;&gt; than me. &gt;&gt; How many love yourself here today? DIDN'T YOU ALL HEAR WHAT I SAID ABOUT LYING TONGUES? How many love yourself? I'm putting my hand up cuz I do. There ain't nothing wrong with ME LOVING MYSELF &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I DON'T LOVE ME more than I LOVE HIM. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS ME TO LOVE MY SISTERS, my brothers, my family. I love my MOTHER AND MY FATHER AND both of them are gone. I still love them. I love people that don't love me. And there's nothing wrong with that. As a MATTER OF FACT, HE WANTS ME TO. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT ME TO LOVE ANYONE more than him. SO WE SAY, WELL, I HATE MYSELF. AND THE TRUTH of that is yes. And in our language of scriptural meaning and understanding, it simply means I love myself less. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SAY GOD HATES EVERYBODY BUT THE BRIDE. THAT'S contrary to the Bible. The Lord Jesus, the very heart of God in John 3:16 says this, "God so &gt;&gt; loved, &gt;&gt; not hated. &gt;&gt; GOD so loved the bride, [screaming] the world, THE WORLD. GOD HATES THEIR SIN. HE HATES THEIR FAIL." But God loves them. IT'S NOT EVEN HIS WILL THAT ANY SHOULD PERISH. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, BECAUSE OUR MESSAGE IS SUCH A MESSAGE OF SEPARATION AND ISOLATION FROM THE WORLD, WE WILL NOT EVEN LET OUR LIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. I AIN'T GETTING AROUND THAT BUNCH OF DEVILS. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF Baptists and men wear shorts. THEY DO THIS, THAT, THE OTHER. WELL, LET YOUR LIGHT SOUL SHINE THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR LIFE. BROTHER DONN, IS IT OKAY TO LOVE THEM? BY [screaming] ALL MEANS, LOVE THEM. LOVE THE DRUNK ON THE STREET. LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOST WITHOUT GOD. LET THEM KNOW THE REAL LOVE of God. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Get out of here, devil. Thank you. Notice Psalm 139:22. I hate them with perfect hatred. Praise the Lord. Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; All of our nurses standing post supposed to do now. I HATE THEM WITH PERFECT HATRED. I count them mine enemies. YOU SEE, A perfect hatred of evil can only proceed from a heart which loves those that are in that sin and filth and debauchery. AND YET HUMANS WILL TRY TO USE THIS scripture and justify their hatred for people who've hurt them &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, David said he had a perfect hatred. I HATE THIS BROTHER." I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. HE LEFT my church. This man done this. THIS WOMAN DON'T I I HATE HIM. IT'S A perfect hatred. Don't sound perfect to me. I mean, I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have thought perfect hatred would cause you to bust your teeth with your goodness. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It cannot be perfect if it doesn't proceed from a heart filled with love &gt;&gt; for those people who've done you wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many has been hurt by people? &gt;&gt; This is the most honest y'all have been all morning. I figured I'd get you somewhere. How many's been hurt by people? So, you're going to ride all people off then, right? &gt;&gt; What? How many's been hurt by preachers? I put my leg up, too. Yep. I do the other one, too, but I can't spread ride that part. OH, HOW MANY BEEN HURT, LET DOWN, DISAPPOINTED? WE ALL HAVE. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU SHALL NEVER BE HURT AGAIN. AND you realize who you're robbing the most by that attitude? Yourself. &gt;&gt; SURE, WE'VE BEEN HURT BY PEOPLE. SURE, WE'VE BEEN LET DOWN BY PEOPLE. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME GOOD, GODLY people left in this world. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN HURT BY PREACHERS, LET DOWN BY PREACHERS. SO HAVE I. BUT THAT DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT SOME MEN OF GOD IN THIS WORD THAT STILL LOVES THE LORD JESUS WITH ALL OF THEIR HEARTS. BUT KEEP IN MIND, EVERY PREACHER, I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS, HE IS A HUMAN BEING AND HE IS A work in progress. Amen. &gt;&gt; Read with me in Galatians 5:1 19 and we'll start closing down. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred. So you mean God would put human hatred right next to witchcraft? &gt;&gt; Yeah. and idolatry and emulation and wraths and strife and seditions and hearsay. So God cannot hate with this kind of hate. &gt;&gt; Can y'all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let's see if you can amen this. Then God don't want you to. &gt;&gt; It's not godly. to hate people &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; It's ungodly. &gt;&gt; Our hair, our dress, we don't go here, we don't go there, we don't do that. Oh, that's well and good. But what good does all of that do if you've got a heart full of hate? Amen. &gt;&gt; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, reings, and such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, what a terrible thing &gt;&gt; to go to church for years of your life and have a heart full of this type of hatred &gt;&gt; and wind up being lost. &gt;&gt; This is serious. Yes. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:9, he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; is in darkness even until now. &gt;&gt; He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother. So there is a way apparently that a person can absolutely hate their brother and be convinced that they're right with God. He that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness. So he behaves his mannerism is in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. You see it's the type of hatred that Satan wants in our hearts. It would be a similar hatred that Iran has for Israel. &gt;&gt; Just in the last six months, they have sent over a billion dollars to Hezbollah in the country of Lebanon to build up their arms to try to destroy Israel. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THEY'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS sending it to Hamas, to the other in Fatada, the other different groups. Why? Because they hate Israel so bad. And yet Iran is fixing to have to evacuate their capital city of Thrron, which holds millions of people, because they have no water. Look, I I realize I'm not the smartest kid on the block, but you think, why didn't they take some of that money and figure out how to do desalination plants or pump water from here to there to there? But it's like they are obsessed &gt;&gt; with destroying Israel. And I like what I heard Marco Rubio say a little while back as he was standing under a portion of the Temple Mount where archaeologists have put big Ibeams of steel and dug down and found the original steps where the people would come from the pool of Sylum and go up to the temple. AND MARCO RUBIO STOOD THERE AND he said, "Where are all those nations who tried to destroy Israel?" &gt;&gt; The Romans, he said, "Their kingdom has been annihilated. THE ASSYRIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. THE BABYLONIANS HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED. &gt;&gt; And there's one people left, the people of Israel." Oh my. [applause] &gt;&gt; But you see WHAT HATRED WILL DO? HATRED WILL DRIVE people to annihilate themselves &gt;&gt; because they hate this entity OR THIS GROUP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOT NOT ALL, BUT SOME OF THOSE who've left the message, they have such a hatred FOR GOD'S PROPHET. THEY HAVE SUCH A HATRED FOR THIS MESSAGE AND SUCH A HATRED for you who follow it and a hatred for the preachers. Some of them hate me so terribly. They would kill me &gt;&gt; if they could get BY WITH IT. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY IT TO YOU THIS WAY. IF I WAS THINKING ABOUT leaving the message, and I ain't, I certainly wouldn't go to none OF THEM BECAUSE I DON'T SEE more of God in their lives. I see less than what they had when they was among us. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT SOME OF THE PREACHERS that have left and preaching and saying and doing the things they're doing and they want to win me. They want to win you. THEY WANT US TO FOLLOW THEM. AND WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? &gt;&gt; COME ON SOMEBODY. BUT YOU SEE WHEN YOU GET SO UNDER HATRED, YOU LOOK AT THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE THEIR LEADERS ARE UNDER THIS HATRED. for the Jews and they can hate him till they burn turn blue in the face and bury every one of them. And when there is no more Iran, Israel is still the chosen nation of God. AND WHEN OH MY ALL THE MESSAGE FIGHTERS AND ALL THE MESSAGE HATERS DIE, GO MY TO THEIR PLACE WHEREVER THAT WILL BE AND THEY STAND BEFORE GOD. DON'T WORRY LITTLE CHILDREN. ONE OF THESE DAYS THIS WORD WILL CATCH YOUR SOUL OUT OF HERE. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF HATRED. IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF VARIANCE AND STRIFE, BUT out of love. &gt;&gt; The stand [applause] first John 3:15, "Whosoever hateth his brother &gt;&gt; is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 verse 20. And if a man say, [snorts] "I love God," and hateth his brother, he is a &gt;&gt; liar. &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? How many wants to be godly? &gt;&gt; Love the things God loves &gt;&gt; and hates the things that God hates. &gt;&gt; And look at things that are sin and evil and wrong and out of a heart of love. Brother Malachi, not vengeance, vindictiveness, but out of a heart of love. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, as we stand here today, Lord, I realize this has not been a sermon that made us all probably really happy and they just want to get up and run around the building. Probably most of us wanted to crawl out. Father, we we want to thank you for truth. &gt;&gt; We desire, Lord Jesus, that we can be godly. I'm sure like me, these people have been overwhelmed, all this that we've looked at under the attribute of godliness. But we thank you for it, Father. For truly we desire to be godly. Lord Jesus, I ask you that you'd help each man, woman, boy, and girl. May we search our hearts. I know some of them, Lord, have been so hurt by people and disappointed and let down, and they've been through so many things. as I sat back in the office and whenever I counsel them and hear the terrible things that many of them have been through, not only these people, but ones I've had to talk to around the world, they've experienced heartbreaking things. But yet, Lord Jesus, we believe that your power can so come into our lives that it helps us instead of being harsh, mean, full of hatred, vindictive, we can be forgiving, loving, gentle, and kind. Father, we want to hate the deeds of the nickelans, but yet love them. We don't want to be like that church age as time went on into another church age. And then when it become doctrine, God could not say to the people of that age, you hate it cuz I hate it. But God said, you have. So they had allowed the doctrine of the nickelans. And God had to separate himself from where the church was standing. And God let them know, I hate that thing, but it's easy to see you don't. You've embraced it. Maybe under the disguise of love. But how can it be true love when we love something that you hate? You hate discord. You hate division, telling lies, spreading gossip. You hate all these things, Lord. So, how can we embrace them and say, "Well, it's the work of God. Oh, yes, God is doing this and doing that." When God himself says, "Don't identify me with that. I hate that." So, how is it, Lord, that we can embrace so many this compromising spirit comes in the ranks of our message? And like Israel, we'll let the Amorites live and the Hittites live and the Jebusites live. It started with just one of the small tribes and then it grew from one to the other to the other until before long in their ranks were unbelievers, infidels, agnostics, marrying among them. What a sad thing. It won't be but a few more settings of the sun. We can already see it, Lord. As I see preacher friends of mine that they don't believe this that the prophet taught and some don't believe that that he taught and some don't believe this that he taught. Well, this this was just an idea in the 50s and the 60s and brother Brandham was under this influence of this and that and the other. I never thought I'd ever live to hear such words comes out of message men's mouths, but here we are. So, Father, we pray you'd help us &gt;&gt; to stay true. And then, Lord, we we admit we need your help. How do we treat those brothers who say such things? How do we treat them? When we see the prophet teaching this, this, this, don't do that, don't do that, don't do that, and they do it and they bless it and say it's of God, then how do we treat them? Do we shun them? Do we stay away from them? Do we not speak to them anymore? Or do we disagree with what they're doing and still pray for them and love them from our heart? We need you, Lord. David faced the same thing. It's easy to stand when a bear is charging against you and and raise up against him and take his life. A lion charges against you and you pick up a piece of armament and you take his life. But how do you deal with King Saul? A man who is the anointed of the Lord. A man who is a king chosen by God himself. Teach us, Lord. We know David slipped into the cave and just cut a small piece of his garment off just to let Saul know how close it got to him. And the Bible says his heart smoteed him. &gt;&gt; We need help, Lord, to know how to deal with the times that we're in. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I don't mind telling you, Lord, I'm shocked and surprised by some of the things I hear some of the message preachers saying and doing. We just need your help cuz we don't want to compromise, Lord God. Neither do we want to get to a spot we think we're the only just us and four more and no more. That's all. No, Lord. We don't want that old ecclesiastical thing. &gt;&gt; Teach us, Jesus. We love you, Father. with all of our hearts, praise the Lord. I wonder how many of you today would just with your heads still bowed, please raise your hand to the Lord and say, "Lord, I I I need help. I I realize, Lord, maybe I've been I've been supporting things and standing with things just that you hate. It makes me feel awful, Lord. makes me feel awful. I want to be right. Lord, teach us. God bless you. Now, I'm going to pray for pray for each of you. Also, we got this prayer request here. Please pray for Lincoln Hornyak. He's been taken to the ER for continued vomiting that is recurring. Heavenly Father, we pray for Brother Lincoln today. Lord, you see this need in his body, Lord Jesus. What's causing this vomiting? In the name of Jesus, I resent this thing from our brother. May the spirit of God move forward. Lord, we join our faith together as your believing children. Lord, we know this is one of the many reasons why we don't want hatred in our hearts. For we know if we hide sin or we've got things in our heart, you won't hear us when we pray. And Lord God, we've got so many needs among us in the day and hour that we live. We don't want our prayers hindered. The husbands and wives don't need to argue and fuss and debate and so on in their home. Peter wrote about it lest their prayers would be hindered. We need each other so desperately in this hour. Father, help us Lord. It's easy for me to see, Father, why the very last attribute before going up into your love is brotherly kindness. Is it that it will be the hardest to achieve? It will be the very capping stone by which divine love sets on top of the closest connection to God himself. brotherly love. Teach us, Jesus. Teach us, oh God. Teach me as a minister. Help me, Father. Help me to know how to deal with issues. Father, help me. I pray, Lord. Oh God, we love you today with all of our hearts. Jesus, come near us now, Lord. If you see anything in my heart, Lord God, that I'm identified with that you hate, make it known to me, Jesus. May you search every heart. Begin here on the platform with me first. Then Lord, while you're here, go to the musicians, song leaders, deacons, trustees, all of us. Father, go to the mezzanine in the back. Go to the sound room up in the top the audio brothers there in the internet. Go out on the streaming. Father, may every heart be searched today. What a heartbreaking thing to know that we love something you hate or we hate something or someone that you love. Saul developed a hatred in his heart against a man who was after your heart. It shows us what hatred can do. And Saul's love changed from the love the way a father would love as a son to way an enemy would hate another enemy. Keep me from such Jesus. Keep our church from hatred. Keep us Lord God from the evil of rottness and corruption in the last day. Father grant it Lord Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing something for us. Hey. Oh my. Let's just allow before we go here. I won't keep you much longer. The presence of God just to come by our way now in this cleansing, scouring type of service. Let him look down deep in us. Remember, you're a triune being. your outward being, your flesh, your spirit, imagination, conscience, memory, reason, affection, and then your soul. May the spirit of God search every avenue of every one of us right here today and see if he finds anything that displeases him. Are you willing to let go of it? Are you willing to let go if he finds something? Would you just raise your hand to him and say, "Lord, take it from me, Jesus. You have my permission. Oh God, hallelujah. We worship you, Lord. We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; to be [singing] like Jesus. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; like Jesus on [singing] earth like &gt;&gt; help us Lord from the front to the back Lord God to be [music] like him &gt;&gt; godly like him all through [music] life's journey [singing] from earth to [music] glory my own.

I came back [music and singing] to him. A vessel [singing] unworthy. [music] So [singing] scarred by sin. But he [music] did not [singing] despair. He [music] started over [singing] again. And I'm blessed [singing and music] today. He didn't throw the clay [music and singing] away. Over [music] and over he pulls me [music and singing] and makes me into his likeness.
