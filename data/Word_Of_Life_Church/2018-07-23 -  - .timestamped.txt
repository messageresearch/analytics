[0:00] you see there's a certain thing in you
[0:02] that you thirsts for and you can tell by
[0:05] notice you can tell what's in you by
[0:08] your sole desire what that desire is now
[0:11] you think that sole desire of that thing
[0:14] ultimately that you want which is
[0:16] reflecting your nature and he said now
[0:18] that the nature of the thirst that you
[0:21] had let me read it again it can tell you
[0:23] in your soul what this desire is about
[0:27] the nature of the thirst that you have
[0:30] so if you thirst for fame or fortune or
[0:33] science or more education more education
[0:35] I'm not against education out on this
[0:37] education becomes your beloved and
[0:39] remember as we looked at those things
[0:41] that's not music education science all
[0:43] of those there every one of them are
[0:45] dead they cannot love you back many of
[0:47] you your your beloved is music the
[0:49] absolute is so absorbed in music and you
[0:52] love music they get music can never love
[0:54] you but because music does not have
[0:57] feeling without human beings which
[0:59] produce the music take the human beings
[1:02] out of the production of music and what
[1:04] do you have you'll have notes on sheet
[1:06] music for those of you who can read it
[1:08] and if you don't then you have those who
[1:09] plays here so where does that come from
[1:12] it comes from live human beings who were
[1:15] taking their ability to be able to put
[1:17] the notes together the shape notes and
[1:19] all that and they are making the music
[1:21] but can the music itself love you back
[1:23] if you're not can it look at you and say
[1:26] I love you can your mommy say I love you
[1:28] can your all those things that we spend
[1:31] so much of our time on daddies have the
[1:33] ability to say I'm going to take you to
[1:35] paradise absolutely not
[1:39] then why do we make them our beloved
