[39:29] amen if you have your Bibles and turn to
[39:33] I'll read one scripture then we'll sit
[39:34] and we'll read some more scriptures here
[39:36] uh Genesis chapter
[39:39] 3 and we're going to read verse
[39:52] 5 for God doth know that in the day you
[39:55] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[39:59] you shall be as Gods knowing good and
[40:01] evil and when the women the woman saw
[40:03] that the tree was good for food and it
[40:04] was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to
[40:06] be desired to make one wise she took off
[40:08] the fruit of the fruit thereof and did
[40:10] eat and also gave also onto her husband
[40:14] with her and he did eat you could be
[40:17] seated as you're seated if you we're
[40:19] going to read also in Luke 23 and
[40:22] Revelations
[40:24] 5 Luke 2332 and 3 three as I read these
[40:29] you're going to think brother Joe those
[40:30] scriptures make no sense together and
[40:33] they really
[40:35] don't but they
[40:38] will and there was also two other
[40:42] maleactors LED with him to be put to
[40:45] death and when they were come to the
[40:47] place which is called Calvary There They
[40:50] Crucified him and the maleactors one on
[40:53] the right hand and the other on the left
[40:57] in Revelation 5 we're going to read 3
[40:59] through
[41:01] 5 and no man in heaven no man or nor in
[41:04] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[41:06] to open the book neither neither to look
[41:09] thereon and I wept much because no man
[41:11] was found worthy to open to read the
[41:14] book neither to look there on one of the
[41:16] elders said unto me weep not Behold The
[41:20] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[41:21] David hath prevailed to open the book
[41:24] and to loose the Seven Seals
[41:29] thereof now you look at those and you
[41:31] think those don't make any sense
[41:34] together and they really
[41:35] don't when you read
[41:38] them but with permission from brother
[41:41] Donnie Brothers you got that picture you
[41:43] would put up for me I asked brother
[41:45] Donnie if this would be all right to do
[41:46] this and he told me I could I don't know
[41:50] if we have it yet but y'all remember
[41:52] when Brother David Mayer was here
[41:54] preaching a few months ago when he
[41:57] mentioned the painting
[42:00] Checkmate so as he's talking about that
[42:02] painting and everybody know that
[42:03] painting was done by Frederick marit's
[42:06] wretch and
[42:08] he I don't know what went through his
[42:10] mind when he made this painting but this
[42:11] painting was of a man losing his soul to
[42:14] Satan in a game of
[42:17] chess and The Story Goes and I I'll tell
[42:20] you the history of it but the story goes
[42:22] that this painting was hanging in the
[42:23] Lou and the grand Chessmaster walks by
[42:26] this painting as he walks past this
[42:28] painting he stares at it for a
[42:30] while and he looks at the painting and
[42:33] he stands
[42:34] there and he calls the M they say he
[42:37] calls the museum cator over and tells
[42:39] him this is not
[42:42] right the King has one more move yeah
[42:47] amen so how these scriptures go
[42:51] together along with many other in your
[42:53] Bible these are three times that Satan
[42:55] thought he had checkmated God God yeah
[42:59] in the
[43:00] garden at
[43:02] Calvary and over your
[43:05] Redemption Satan had it perfectly
[43:08] planned out when they put him in the
[43:10] ground he said
[43:14] Checkmate
[43:15] so later that week I was telling brother
[43:17] Jimmy this and and I hope and pray to
[43:20] God that I can give it to you the way
[43:24] this message was GI to me
[43:27] later that week I woke up you can take
[43:29] it down there Brothers if you
[43:32] will I woke up in the 2: in the
[43:36] morning now again I'm I'm not a
[43:38] spiritual person like you know I don't
[43:40] have visions and dreams and and things
[43:43] like
[43:44] that but there's sometimes that that I I
[43:47] wake up in the middle of the night and
[43:49] I'm I'm wide awake and I'm usually woke
[43:52] up by a
[43:54] thought and this thought that that came
[43:56] to me was the King has one more
[44:01] move as I'm sitting there laying it
[44:04] laying that Revelation
[44:06] 55 started going over and over in my
[44:09] head and it didn't go like I just read
[44:12] it to
[44:13] you what how I got it was one of the
[44:16] elders he says I wept much because no
[44:19] man was found worthy to open the book
[44:21] could read the book to open and read the
[44:22] book and neither to look there on one of
[44:24] the elders said unto me weep not the
[44:27] King has one more
[44:29] move that's how it was given to
[44:33] me and you got got to look it Satan's
[44:36] for for now this is probably going to go
[44:38] slow so I
[44:41] apologize Satan's from the moment in the
[44:45] garden you know Satan's been trying to
[44:47] Checkmate that seed every time he
[44:51] can that's been his purpose when God
[44:54] stands there in the garden and tells
[44:55] Satan
[44:57] the seed of the woman will bruise your
[44:59] head and you will bruise his
[45:02] heel God told Satan what his move was
[45:04] going to be because brother brandham
[45:06] said God said I'm going to provide a
[45:10] deliverer so we we look at that and we
[45:13] know it's it was in Satan's nature to
[45:15] always to to get one up on God even when
[45:17] he was in heaven brother brandom said
[45:19] when God created Lucifer when the the
[45:22] closest angel that could ever be to God
[45:23] when God created him God knew he was
[45:26] going to be a devil
[45:28] you got to understand this this this
[45:30] whole game this whole chessboard that
[45:32] God laid out he knew every move before
[45:36] it was ever made you know when I was
[45:38] studying this I got to think of my
[45:39] father-in-law
[45:41] Jack I've never beat him in Checkers in
[45:44] fact I gave up 20 years
[45:46] ago never played him
[45:49] anymore when you made your first move
[45:52] Papa would let you make the first
[45:55] move and then he knew every move you was
[45:57] making after
[45:59] that I don't know how he done it I still
[46:02] think he
[46:02] cheated
[46:05] but I've never I've never seen anybody
[46:09] beating and that's when I I got to
[46:11] thinking of that you know that's the way
[46:13] God was God God laid the board out he
[46:16] saids Satan Make Your
[46:19] Move make your
[46:22] move and Satan says I I'm going to
[46:24] ascend to the north sides of Heaven
[46:27] want to be like
[46:29] God and you know where that move got him
[46:31] it got him cast
[46:34] out but God always had a move to counter
[46:37] Satan's
[46:39] move brother brandham says in the
[46:41] infallible proof of the resurrection and
[46:42] now when God had promised a royal seed
[46:44] that would come forth as a savior it's
[46:46] been the work of God's enemy the devil
[46:48] to destroy that seed all the way down
[46:51] the first thing when the righteous son
[46:53] was born Abel and the unrighteous was
[46:54] born Cain first he slew able thinking he
[46:57] was getting that righteous seed that was
[46:59] Satan's move he knew he had to get get
[47:02] the seed and God allowed it every move
[47:04] that Satan has made and and I want you
[47:06] to realize that in your life tonight
[47:08] every move that Satan makes in your life
[47:10] is
[47:11] allowed if you are a bride of Christ you
[47:14] are a son and daughter he cannot do
[47:16] anything just like job he could not
[47:19] touch job until God took the Hedge down
[47:22] and God allowed him so any move that
[47:25] Satan has on us son or daughter of God
[47:28] is
[47:30] allowed why cuz God's got to move to
[47:33] counter
[47:35] It Go Satan will never make a move in
[47:37] your life that God don't have another
[47:40] one God always has a
[47:44] move so we we look at at this says for
[47:48] he was standing there when God
[47:50] pronounced the Everlasting Earthly
[47:53] judgments upon the people and upon the
[47:54] serpent upon the ground and he promised
[47:56] that the through the woman would come a
[47:58] seed and this seed would bruise the
[48:00] Serpent's head and the serpent found
[48:01] that all that seed all down through the
[48:03] age and he still fighting it then when
[48:07] he slew Abel he thought he got
[48:11] it Satan thought he had
[48:13] Checkmate when he got
[48:16] able he destroyed the only righteous
[48:19] part of the seed then God raised up Seth
[48:21] to take his place a beautiful type of
[48:23] the death of Christ and resurrection of
[48:25] Christ and then he thought he had him
[48:27] when he got the
[48:28] prophets he thought he had him when he
[48:30] got John but when he finally slew the
[48:33] righteous seed and he was buried on the
[48:35] third day Satan thought this a
[48:37] Checkmate I've got him
[48:40] now God raised him up from the dead the
[48:42] Lord
[48:43] Jesus now to give you the the actual
[48:47] history of this painting
[48:51] on I'm not a I'm not into art so y'all
[48:55] that probably know this history better
[48:57] than I do I apologize and I'm not into
[48:59] chess so I know nothing about either one
[49:02] of them so I'll take Corrections
[49:06] later but the the history when I looked
[49:09] up the history on the Checkmate painting
[49:12] used to be in the Lou in 1999 it was
[49:14] sold to a a private
[49:18] buyer but back in the late in the middle
[49:20] 1800s Paul morphe was considered The
[49:24] Grandmaster the chess Grandmaster
[49:27] of the
[49:29] world and one one evening he was got
[49:32] invited to this rich man's house in
[49:34] Richmond
[49:35] Virginia and this rich man had a
[49:37] copy of this
[49:40] painting over the
[49:43] mantle and that's where Paul morphe
[49:45] stands and and looks at the painting for
[49:47] so long and he stares at it and they say
[49:51] he actually pulled out a
[49:52] chessboard and set all the pieces back
[49:55] up
[49:58] and won the
[50:00] game so I got to looking at that picture
[50:02] and the picture that they showed there
[50:04] is
[50:05] in the the story that the artist wret
[50:09] was trying to make was this guy I
[50:11] thought you know a lot of these painters
[50:13] expressed things that happen in their
[50:15] life they would express it in
[50:17] painting I thought what kind of Life did
[50:20] this artist have that he was actually
[50:23] painting a picture of the devil winning
[50:26] right
[50:27] this guy look if you look at the picture
[50:29] and then I got to look at the picture
[50:31] this man is he's lost he's got this look
[50:34] on his face just like of defeat yeah and
[50:38] and I noticed he he's playing this game
[50:41] but the problem with him is he's looking
[50:43] at his opponent's
[50:45] pieces instead of his
[50:48] own he's looking at what the enemy is
[50:51] doing to him instead of looking what he
[50:54] could do right and so many times in in
[50:57] our life you know this is a game of life
[51:00] I don't want to offend nobody well you
[51:01] shouldn't call this a game of life
[51:02] that's what brother brandham called it
[51:03] I'll read you the quote in a minute
[51:04] you're in a game of
[51:08] life and brother brandham said you have
[51:10] to play by The Game of Life by God's
[51:13] rules and understanding that you if you
[51:18] understand God one little bit you got to
[51:20] understand that you have an opponent
[51:22] that God has allowed to sit across from
[51:25] you God's already played the game yeah
[51:29] he's played the entire game he's won the
[51:31] entire game amen he's never lost
[51:36] right and now it's your
[51:39] turn so what did what did Jesus come to
[51:42] do to play the game and win to show that
[51:45] no matter who your opponent is across
[51:48] from you no matter where his pieces are
[51:51] are on the board how many of the pieces
[51:53] of your chest pieces he has taken it
[51:55] doesn't matter
[51:57] you always have a move your king is the
[52:00] most important piece on the board amen
[52:03] your king will always have a
[52:07] move how many understands where the word
[52:10] Checkmate came
[52:13] from Checkmate is a is a Persian word
[52:16] came from shamat or sham
[52:19] mate it means your king is
[52:23] helpless your king is useless
[52:28] and sometimes that's all we hear we we
[52:31] we don't hear anything else because
[52:32] that's you know we would never say that
[52:35] but our actions do come
[52:37] on when we get to the point where where
[52:40] we think we can't we've got nothing left
[52:42] because we're looking at everything the
[52:44] enemy is doing we're looking at what
[52:46] Satan's doing in our lives and and we
[52:48] can't see what God already said he would
[52:50] do for
[52:51] us do you realize you make your king
[52:55] helpless you make him helpless God is
[52:59] moved by
[53:02] faith God is moved by faith it takes the
[53:05] hand of Faith to reach out to God and
[53:07] pick him up Pi the king up and move him
[53:09] over here yes sir it takes Faith yes
[53:15] sir the brides in a game is a
[53:19] game the game of
[53:22] life and God left the
[53:24] blueprint brother brandom says faith
[53:26] over Victory that's the way it is with
[53:28] human life you can't play the rules of
[53:30] the game of Life wrong and expect to
[53:34] win you've got to play it according to
[53:37] God's word what do we have in God's word
[53:40] anything you ask in my name I will give
[53:43] it to you I'll be with you even in you
[53:47] to the end of the
[53:49] world if you have faith the grain of a
[53:51] mustard seed you could say to this
[53:53] mountain be thou lifted up and cast to
[53:55] the seed it will be so
[53:57] that's God's word
[54:02] amen Satan's always tried to beat God
[54:05] since his
[54:06] existence and it's the god in you that
[54:09] he's trying to
[54:11] beat if you have the Holy Ghost if you
[54:14] have the Holy Ghost he's going to do
[54:17] everything he can to beat
[54:20] you he's one of his strategies is to get
[54:23] you to look at his moves oh yes come on
[54:28] thank you have to understand your
[54:29] adversary the Bible says he's worthy
[54:33] adversary he's
[54:35] worthy unless you let the king play the
[54:37] game oh you let the king play the game
[54:41] he's no match for your king amen amen
[54:44] he's no match he's already proved it and
[54:47] and we claim to have the king in here
[54:53] yeah we read in Isaiah
[54:57] how art thou fallen from Heaven o loose
[54:58] for Son of the morning how art thou cut
[55:00] down to the ground which weakest the
[55:02] Nations for thou Hast said in th heart I
[55:04] will Ascend un into heaven I will exalt
[55:06] my throne above the stars of
[55:08] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[55:11] the congregation the sides of the north
[55:13] I will Ascend above the heights of the
[55:15] clouds I will be of the most high here
[55:17] is Satan trying to to tell what his move
[55:23] is and it got him beat but said when he
[55:26] made Lucifer he knew he'd be the
[55:30] devil he had to let it be there to show
[55:33] that he was he was the Savior the Christ
[55:37] he had to let it happen so many times
[55:41] Satan all these events play out through
[55:44] the scriptures when Satan's looking for
[55:46] that seed in the garden when he slew
[55:49] Abel when that seed is carried over in
[55:51] the ark and when you see it coming on
[55:53] down every time Satan tries to stop it
[55:55] he thinks he's checkmated God yes
[55:58] sir and when you stumble and you fall
[56:02] and you make a mistake he's standing
[56:04] over you saying
[56:06] Checkmate he's telling you I've got
[56:11] you you can every one of you can sit
[56:13] here
[56:14] tonight only you and God knows your life
[56:18] only you and God knows if you're an
[56:20] unbeliever only you and God knows if
[56:22] you're a mate
[56:24] believer or a True Believer
[56:31] but God knows
[56:32] everything every mistake that you've
[56:34] made every fault and failure that you've
[56:36] make you can't cover it from
[56:39] God but a true
[56:41] bride will always look to that King for
[56:43] the next
[56:44] move instead of focusing on the faults
[56:47] and failures a true bride will always
[56:50] get back up and get back in the
[56:54] game I I love that that God hinted
[56:57] hinted to the devil what he was going to
[56:58] do in the
[56:59] garden I'm I'm going to bring a
[57:01] deliverer and he's going to he's going
[57:02] to destroy you yeah he's going to put
[57:05] his his heel on your head you'll not
[57:08] have dominion over him you'll not have
[57:09] dominion over his
[57:11] seed and God told him that God didn't
[57:13] hide that from him but yet God still
[57:16] allowed these
[57:21] moves so brother brandom says in God
[57:24] commissioning Moses
[57:26] God promised he could do it God said we
[57:29] could do it God promised our fathers
[57:30] that we was going that we what our land
[57:32] and that what belonged to us no matter
[57:34] if they got the walled cities they look
[57:36] like Giants and everything else he said
[57:41] quit looking at Giants yeah that's what
[57:44] he told Moses when you go into the land
[57:46] you don't look at the Giants what was
[57:48] the report from these people that came
[57:50] back why they were they were looking at
[57:52] at all the moves around them that the
[57:54] enemy was making we look like grass
[57:56] Hoppers their cities are so big they're
[57:58] so w there we can't overcome them their
[58:01] their Warriors are like giants there's
[58:03] nothing we can
[58:04] do we can't take
[58:07] it when you get that attitude you're
[58:09] already
[58:10] beat you're already beat when you look
[58:13] at the problems in your life and we all
[58:15] have them and you say I don't see no way
[58:17] out of this I I don't I don't see no way
[58:20] to get through
[58:21] this you're already defeated yeah you we
[58:25] we we've been taught year after year
[58:28] after year from from the prophet already
[58:31] bringing it all the way to this you
[58:33] don't look at circumstances and symptoms
[58:36] that's right you you don't you don't
[58:38] look at the things that that are falling
[58:40] apart around you the whole world is
[58:42] falling
[58:44] apart we don't look at circumstances he
[58:46] said quit looking at Giants and start
[58:48] looking at God's word and when men and
[58:50] women quit looking at their sicknesses
[58:52] and diseases and start looking at what
[58:54] God said about it you'll take over
[58:57] you will
[58:59] overcome are you sick quit looking at it
[59:03] yeah he said you could have healing are
[59:06] you depressed he said you could have joy
[59:08] you could have peace everything you have
[59:11] in your life it's just one move
[59:14] over you make that move by the hand of
[59:17] Faith picks it up and moves it to that
[59:19] next
[59:20] spot all things are subject to Christ
[59:23] Jesus Christ all things are subject to
[59:25] you in prayer when you ask in his name
[59:28] and
[59:31] believe in perfect faith I I'm reading a
[59:35] lot we'll get we'll get out of it here
[59:36] in a minute now remember they had the
[59:38] power Jesus had given them the power to
[59:41] heal the sick to raise the dead and cast
[59:43] out Devils just a few days before that
[59:46] they had the power but not the faith to
[59:48] use the
[59:51] power what did what did Brother brandom
[59:53] say about the power that we all had you
[59:55] you you know how brother Brandon went
[59:56] through that description of the the
[59:58] planets and the universe and the
[59:59] galaxies and Beyond how many light years
[1:00:01] it was away and he said all the the
[1:00:04] power that God used to create that so
[1:00:07] that same power is in you but if you
[1:00:09] don't have faith you can't use
[1:00:12] it you might have all the chess
[1:00:14] pieces but if you don't know how to play
[1:00:16] chess brother Rob you've lost yeah if
[1:00:20] you don't if you don't understand the
[1:00:22] game if you don't have the ability to
[1:00:24] say I know how this piece moves I know
[1:00:27] this this little horsey thing goes up
[1:00:29] two and over one
[1:00:32] yeah I know these little castle looking
[1:00:35] things can only go straight or sideways
[1:00:37] if I right or
[1:00:39] wrong you have to understand you have to
[1:00:42] know what you're you've been given
[1:00:44] that's right you have to know the
[1:00:46] ability just because you have the power
[1:00:48] that don't you know what what did
[1:00:50] Brother bandom say about having power
[1:00:51] without character is satanic yeah but
[1:00:54] having power with God
[1:00:56] faith you'll overcome anything that
[1:00:58] comes in your life you'll overcome
[1:01:00] anything that he brings against you yes
[1:01:02] sir but you have to understand the game
[1:01:05] you're in Hallelujah good you know I was
[1:01:08] talking to to brother Jimmy back there a
[1:01:10] while ago and while I was studying this
[1:01:14] I was I was thinking you know for all my
[1:01:16] life I thought God's final move for my
[1:01:19] Redemption was the
[1:01:21] cross I thought that was God's final
[1:01:24] move for me brother Jackie was the cross
[1:01:27] cross I said brother Jackie it occurred
[1:01:29] brother Jimmy it occurred to me that if
[1:01:31] that was God's final move I have to stop
[1:01:33] at John
[1:01:35] 316 that's where I got to
[1:01:38] stop God's got no more moves for me
[1:01:41] because I don't understand the game any
[1:01:42] further than that come on there's so
[1:01:46] much more to the game beyond the cross
[1:01:49] yeah when you're playing the game of
[1:01:51] redemption I would have loved to been in
[1:01:53] J in John's spot when he went up in into
[1:01:56] heaven and he's he's weeping because
[1:01:58] there's this book and no one can open
[1:02:01] the book
[1:02:03] yeah and John's weeping and John said I
[1:02:06] looked everywhere John made every move
[1:02:08] he could make to find somebody that was
[1:02:11] worthy to open that
[1:02:13] book so what was God's final move for my
[1:02:19] Redemption the cross was one of his
[1:02:23] moves right he went and hell that was
[1:02:26] one of his moves he kicked the door in
[1:02:29] he conquered death Hell In The Grave
[1:02:32] that was one of God's moves yeah but his
[1:02:35] final move for me Redemption was when he
[1:02:37] took the
[1:02:38] book he took the
[1:02:41] book that's all I needed for
[1:02:44] Redemption I couldn't be still sitting
[1:02:46] at the foot of the cross there's much
[1:02:48] more to this game of redemption than
[1:02:50] sitting under the cross you can't play
[1:02:52] this game without the cross you can't
[1:02:54] play it without the cross
[1:02:58] because the game's over if that's where
[1:02:59] you
[1:03:01] stop
[1:03:03] amen but the brands had perfect
[1:03:06] Faith they had the power Jesus had given
[1:03:09] them the power to heal the sick to raise
[1:03:10] the Dead cast out Devils just a few days
[1:03:13] before
[1:03:14] that they had the power but not the
[1:03:16] faith to use the power now there's the
[1:03:19] brandom
[1:03:22] Tabernacle they have the power but not
[1:03:25] the faith
[1:03:26] to use the
[1:03:29] power the bride today you have to have
[1:03:33] that the holy spirit is here with the
[1:03:35] power but you haven't got the faith to
[1:03:38] move
[1:03:40] it see what I mean it takes Faith to
[1:03:42] move it and all things are possible to
[1:03:44] him that believe you just just be that
[1:03:48] simple in your faith then God will go to
[1:03:50] work for you he's obligated to his word
[1:03:52] all things are possible to them that
[1:03:53] believe whatsoever things when you
[1:03:55] desire believe that you shall receive
[1:03:57] them you shall have them they'll be
[1:03:59] given to you
[1:04:02] amen that's God's requirement and faith
[1:04:04] is what it takes to move God so when
[1:04:06] you're in the game and you're in the
[1:04:07] spot you have no what you don't know
[1:04:09] where your next move is my first
[1:04:11] suggestion is quit looking at the
[1:04:13] enemy's
[1:04:15] pieces but what doesn't matter what he's
[1:04:18] moved around you he might have moved a a
[1:04:20] a besetting sin up around you and got
[1:04:21] you in a corner whether it be lust
[1:04:24] whether it be bitterness whether it be
[1:04:26] this or that whatever it is he's got you
[1:04:27] in a corner and you don't see no way out
[1:04:31] always look for your king oh always look
[1:04:34] for your
[1:04:38] king and you're in this spot and you you
[1:04:41] don't know which way to
[1:04:43] go but if you have the power and the
[1:04:47] faith that's what picks up your king and
[1:04:50] moves
[1:04:52] him there's not one move on the on your
[1:04:55] Board of
[1:04:57] life that keeps that King from moving
[1:04:59] wherever he has to
[1:05:01] move it doesn't matter if he's got every
[1:05:04] one of his pieces you're in the center
[1:05:07] of the board and every piece is around
[1:05:09] your piece you still have a
[1:05:12] king and he's got one more
[1:05:16] move you know what when I when I was
[1:05:19] reading the history on
[1:05:21] this when I was his reading the history
[1:05:24] on this and it came to me that a lot of
[1:05:27] these
[1:05:28] other famous chess players came and
[1:05:31] looked at the same painting and and they
[1:05:33] said poor Paul morphe was wrong this
[1:05:36] can't be
[1:05:37] done you know what it really resonated
[1:05:40] with me because I I said that's the
[1:05:43] bride today that's what the bride is
[1:05:44] hearing
[1:05:45] today from people around there they're
[1:05:47] looking at you say you can't live that
[1:05:49] way I know you're past come on you can't
[1:05:51] do that I know what you've done in your
[1:05:54] life
[1:05:57] some of some of you have have have
[1:05:59] probably haven't seen people in your old
[1:06:01] life and and you might have been the
[1:06:03] worst in the
[1:06:05] crowd and then you might go visit them
[1:06:07] you ain't seen him in 20 years and
[1:06:08] they're going to they're not going to
[1:06:10] believe that God got a hold to
[1:06:14] you my dad will tell you that his
[1:06:17] friends he was
[1:06:21] rough but there's always going to be
[1:06:23] people that tells you I don't need a
[1:06:26] pastor you don't need a pastor you don't
[1:06:28] need a preacher you don't need to go to
[1:06:30] church come on there's no such thing as
[1:06:32] a
[1:06:34] prophet they're always going to tell you
[1:06:36] there's always going to be naysayers in
[1:06:38] your life get used to it yeah get used
[1:06:41] to it true you don't you don't quit your
[1:06:44] football team being a fan because
[1:06:46] somebody told you they ain't no good do
[1:06:48] you you don't quit the things that you
[1:06:51] enjoy because somebody's talking bad
[1:06:52] about it why would you let that change
[1:06:54] what you believe
[1:06:56] when you got people telling you you
[1:06:58] can't do it come
[1:07:00] on as long as you got a king that has a
[1:07:03] move you can do anything through Christ
[1:07:05] Jesus
[1:07:11] anything it's the difference being
[1:07:13] consumed by your enemy's position people
[1:07:16] become consumed by it I've had people
[1:07:20] have things in their life and say well
[1:07:21] Joe I I can't get over it I I can't get
[1:07:24] over it I can't get rid of this this
[1:07:26] thing I've prayed for people that that
[1:07:29] have had problems in their life and you
[1:07:31] go with them and you pray with them the
[1:07:33] years later they still have the same
[1:07:36] thing they might have the power but they
[1:07:38] don't have the faith right and they
[1:07:41] haven't made that King their

[1:12:26] it's freely given and you can't play
[1:12:28] this game without
[1:12:29] it you can't all you'll do all you'll do
[1:12:33] is is is open open the box put the
[1:12:35] pieces up and then you're
[1:12:37] lost because you have to have the Holy
[1:12:39] Ghost to play this game amen you have to
[1:12:43] have the Holy Ghost to move the king yes
[1:12:46] sir thank you Lord I'm scooting through
[1:12:49] here
[1:12:57] you know what I studying said begin to
[1:12:58] look at
[1:13:00] David looking at
[1:13:04] David is David was the type of guy we
[1:13:08] know that the scripture says that when
[1:13:09] he fought Goliath that he was 15 years
[1:13:13] old brother brand mentioned he's 15
[1:13:14] years I was looking up history and
[1:13:16] history was saying David was about 15
[1:13:18] years old when he he met with Goliath
[1:13:21] but I always looked at David and and
[1:13:22] thought you know but God used David in
[1:13:25] this took David down in this Valley to
[1:13:27] fight this this giant because he wanted
[1:13:29] to show comparison in size it maybe he
[1:13:33] did so no matter how big your your trial
[1:13:37] is you can still overcome it but you got
[1:13:41] to understand Goliath was the
[1:13:45] champion the enemy's Champion it was
[1:13:48] going to take a king to beat this guy
[1:13:52] oh it was going to take a king and where
[1:13:55] was the king at the King was sitting up
[1:13:58] in his tent didn't even have his armor
[1:14:00] on because he offered it to David
[1:14:04] yeah but read the chapter before that
[1:14:07] chapter 16 1
[1:14:09] Samuel God says I've rejected Saul as
[1:14:13] king he tells Samuel go to the house of
[1:14:16] Jesse I have a king amongst them he
[1:14:19] didn't say I will have one he said I
[1:14:22] have
[1:14:23] one and there Sam anoints David so David
[1:14:27] fights Goliath as a
[1:14:31] King David is a king God says this is a
[1:14:34] fight for a king you can't face him
[1:14:36] unless you are a
[1:14:37] king so David Gets anointed king of
[1:14:41] Israel one chapter before and you got to
[1:14:44] understand something it wasn't it wasn't
[1:14:47] David it was David's faith in God that
[1:14:50] took him down in the valley it wasn't
[1:14:52] God's faith in David
[1:14:57] what did David say David goes into the
[1:14:58] into the army in the camp and say what's
[1:15:00] going on I'm he was just there to bring
[1:15:02] food to his brothers he didn't come
[1:15:04] there looking for a fight he didn't come
[1:15:06] in there trying to to find somebody to
[1:15:08] whip Hey where's the biggest giant hey
[1:15:10] give me some armor give me something I I
[1:15:12] can use I'm great at this game he just
[1:15:15] want to say
[1:15:16] hello how y'all
[1:15:19] doing he didn't realize he was a king
[1:15:25] and God God takes him and then he hears
[1:15:27] the
[1:15:28] enemy he hears the boast of the enemy
[1:15:33] yes he says Let Me In the
[1:15:37] game that ought to be the Cry of every
[1:15:40] one of us
[1:15:41] tonight when you see your brother and
[1:15:44] sister the enemy coming against them
[1:15:47] Lord let me in the
[1:15:49] fight this is this is a fight for a king
[1:15:53] yes you you can't beat the enemy if
[1:15:57] you're not a
[1:16:00] king how many knows your Kings
[1:16:04] Tonight the same chapter when John said
[1:16:08] behold the L lamb of the tribe of Judah
[1:16:10] has prevailed read read down a few more
[1:16:13] verses you've been made Kings and
[1:16:16] Priests that's right why because he knew
[1:16:19] when he was putting you in the
[1:16:23] game he was putting you in the the
[1:16:26] game it would take a king to win this
[1:16:29] one it takes a king to win the battles
[1:16:33] because you're fighting what does what
[1:16:34] does it say in that same scripture you
[1:16:36] fight against powers and
[1:16:38] principalities that's what it takes so
[1:16:40] it takes a king so David goes down in
[1:16:42] there into this Valley he tells Goliath
[1:16:45] I come to you in the name of the most
[1:16:48] high God in the name in it yeah not by
[1:16:53] the name he was in it

[1:16:58] against Satan every day of your life
[1:17:00] when you wake up in the morning you
[1:17:01] better step into that

[1:17:28] under his own name I'm David of the
[1:17:30] House of
[1:17:34] Jesse God said I'm sending a king down
[1:17:36] there I've never looked at it that way
[1:17:40] before that David was already anointed a
[1:17:43] king and then God the next chapter God
[1:17:46] throws him against the biggest enemy
[1:17:48] Israel
[1:17:50] has the entire
[1:17:52] Army Israel's entire Army was scared of
[1:17:55] this guy yes sir I think the Bible says
[1:17:57] over 800,000 men or something like that
[1:17:59] was in the is the Israelite
[1:18:01] Army every one of
[1:18:04] them and what happened with David David
[1:18:07] didn't look at the moves that the
[1:18:10] Philistines were making that was just
[1:18:12] another chest piece to
[1:18:14] him it was just another piece I got to
[1:18:17] take that one too I've already killed a
[1:18:20] lion I've already killed a bear I'll
[1:18:22] take care of him too right
[1:18:25] amen that ought to be our attitude
[1:18:26] towards everything that comes in our
[1:18:28] life I had a toothache yesterday but I
[1:18:30] prayed about it and God took it away I
[1:18:32] had a headache day before that God took
[1:18:35] it away now I have cancer well God's
[1:18:37] going to take that away too
[1:18:39] yeah quit looking at the size of your
[1:18:41] enemy yes quit looking at the things in
[1:18:44] your life that you put size to that you
[1:18:47] put volume to amen that doesn't matter
[1:18:50] to
[1:18:51] God God don't look at how big something
[1:18:54] is how huge something is God don't see
[1:18:57] size God sees
[1:19:00] Faith that's all he sees is
[1:19:04] Faith you got to understand faith is the
[1:19:08] substance of things hoped for but fear
[1:19:10] takes that substance away fear takes it
[1:19:14] away from
[1:19:16] you David had no
[1:19:19] fear fear had took all the
[1:19:22] substance from Israel yes sir Israel no
[1:19:26] longer knew how to fight they didn't
[1:19:28] know how to
[1:19:30] fight they were worried about food David
[1:19:33] was bringing in what did David's
[1:19:35] Brothers tell him David you need to go
[1:19:36] back home you need to going back home
[1:19:38] that's what that's what the devil's
[1:19:39] telling you hey this fight's too big for
[1:19:41] you go back home gohe close close the
[1:19:43] board up you can't play this
[1:19:46] game but it's fear we get the fear in
[1:19:48] our life and we lose the the the fear
[1:19:51] blurs our vision of our King
[1:19:54] he's sitting there on the
[1:19:56] board he's dying to
[1:19:59] move he's dying to move God wants to
[1:20:02] move for you in more ways than you can
[1:20:05] ever
[1:20:07] imagine more ways than you can imagine
[1:20:10] or you could be this little guy up here
[1:20:11] in this in this in this
[1:20:14] painting
[1:20:16] lost lost because he couldn't see what
[1:20:19] he
[1:20:20] had we so often we Lo lose the vision of
[1:20:23] what we have
[1:20:25] we we lose the vision of what God's done
[1:20:27] for us you know that's that's one thing
[1:20:29] that always baffled me about the
[1:20:31] children of Israel I was gay LAX
[1:20:33] Virginia last night this Lord put this
[1:20:35] on my heart as the children of Israel
[1:20:37] they they God brought them out they were
[1:20:40] in Egypt and they and they they watched
[1:20:42] all all the plagues that God did for
[1:20:44] them brought upon on the
[1:20:46] Egyptians they saw all
[1:20:49] that they they they heard the cries as
[1:20:52] as God took the life of the the
[1:20:55] firstborns of Egypt they seen how God
[1:20:57] saved their firstborn under the blood of

[1:22:43] them we brought him on brother Lance

[1:22:48] prayed for him four years
[1:22:51] old he was 20 years old and he was
[1:22:54] sitting up there at College 1 in the
[1:22:56] morning took his glasses off and as soon
[1:22:57] as he took them off his eyes
[1:23:03] crossed and he said he sat down on the
[1:23:05] bed and he
[1:23:06] said Lord I'm sick of
[1:23:11] this I'm sick of
[1:23:14] this you've got to get sick of your
[1:23:16] enemy amen you've got to get

[1:23:42] of his eyes and he saw two hands when
[1:23:44] you're crosseyed one hand looks two he
[1:23:47] said and he
[1:23:49] prayed put that hand up there and there
[1:23:50] was two hands and he said he watched as
[1:23:53] those two hands became War

[1:24:04] contacts but he had a king that he
[1:24:06] trusted

[1:24:55] and that's what happens we get to a
[1:24:56] point we're

[1:25:41] again and he came and took the book out
[1:25:44] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:25:45] the throne and when he had taken the
[1:25:47] book The Four beast and 4 and20 Elders

[1:25:52] of them Harps and golden vials full of
[1:25:54] voters which are the prayer of the
[1:25:55] Saints they sang a new song saying Thou
[1:25:57] Art Worthy to take the book and open the
[1:25:59] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[1:26:01] redeemed us to God by the blood of every
[1:26:04] Kindred tongue and people of the nation

[1:26:08] us unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[1:26:13] shall reign that's the outcome of you
[1:26:16] winning the game you shall reign on the
[1:26:21] earth you should be reigning right now
[1:26:23] yeah
[1:26:25] there shouldn't be one thing that hell
[1:26:27] has against you that you can't overcome
[1:26:29] you've been given everything that you
[1:26:31] need to overcome that's
[1:26:33] right you and you get reminded
[1:26:37] weekly and it shouldn't be
[1:26:40] weekly you should be reminding yourself
[1:26:42] every morning when you wake up yeah you
[1:26:44] should be reminding yourself when you go
[1:26:46] through your
[1:26:47] day you should remind yourself when you
[1:26:50] come home you should remind yourself
[1:26:51] when you lay down at night and then
[1:26:55] repeat amen that's how you play the game
[1:26:58] yes sir that's how you overcome because
[1:27:01] he is a worthy at adversary but he's no
[1:27:03] match for your
[1:27:06] king you know look at the
[1:27:11] moves when you think you know when when
[1:27:13] you have to make a move
[1:27:15] and you think well I I'll get
[1:27:18] in I'm get in trouble if I do that I
[1:27:20] don't I don't know if I should do that
[1:27:21] you know God's leading you to do
[1:27:23] something you better do
[1:27:25] it if you feel like God is leading you
[1:27:27] to make a move you better make a move
[1:27:31] amen don't consider your own feelings
[1:27:34] don't consider your own
[1:27:36] thoughts you know like I told somebody
[1:27:38] before there's a
[1:27:40] difference a lot of times people feel
[1:27:42] led to do something it's it's something
[1:27:44] they want to do really
[1:27:46] bad just because you have a great great
[1:27:48] desire to do something doesn't mean it's
[1:27:51] God leading you sometimes it's the
[1:27:53] opposite
[1:27:55] it sometimes God's leading you to do
[1:27:58] something and to get there you got to
[1:28:01] fight that's the way he works I don't
[1:28:04] know why am I happy about it not
[1:28:07] really try being called to preach
[1:28:11] sometime I don't I don't enjoy it I've
[1:28:14] never I've had people ask me you know
[1:28:16] does it ever get the nervousness get any
[1:28:18] better
[1:28:20] never never and I told Brother Jimmy W
[1:28:23] ago I said I pray it never does get any
[1:28:25] better pray it never
[1:28:28] does the worst feeling that the worst
[1:28:30] feeling to have in the world and I hope
[1:28:32] to God it never
[1:28:33] leaves because that will keep you
[1:28:36] humble that will keep you humble to the
[1:28:38] point when you know you're walking out
[1:28:40] here and you're going to handle the word
[1:28:43] for somebody and somebody's soul is
[1:28:45] resting on that and it's in your hands
[1:28:47] for what you
[1:28:52] say Christ
[1:28:55] when Christ played the
[1:28:58] game look at the moves he
[1:29:01] made he knew when he made a move it was
[1:29:04] going to get him beat he did it
[1:29:07] anyway he know it was going to get his
[1:29:09] beard plucked out and he did it
[1:29:11] anyway he made Moves that got him hung
[1:29:13] on a cross got a spear in his side got
[1:29:17] him
[1:29:20] beat he made that move so you wouldn't
[1:29:22] have to
[1:29:25] he made it so you wouldn't have to that
[1:29:27] was the price that he was willing to pay
[1:29:29] hey I I'll give myself up for this part
[1:29:31] of the game but hey this game ain't
[1:29:34] over that's why Satan thought he'd won
[1:29:37] that's why he said Checkmate the king is
[1:29:39] now
[1:29:40] helpless he's useless I killed
[1:29:43] him and he thought it was over Satan
[1:29:47] thought the game was
[1:29:49] over yeah and then he heard a
[1:29:52] knock hey I got got some more
[1:29:55] moves I've got more moves I ain't
[1:29:58] done Satan went to go get a drink of
[1:30:00] water and do a Victory lap and he heard
[1:30:04] heard a
[1:30:05] knock this game ain't
[1:30:09] over the game as long as there's a
[1:30:12] king the game's never
[1:30:14] over I hope we never never forget
[1:30:19] that brother Bram said broken sisters
[1:30:21] I'm looking at a man now sitting in the
[1:30:23] back here
[1:30:25] I remember telling him that in an Old
[1:30:28] Barn stall One Day by a Manger he said
[1:30:31] but I'm no good he said I know you're
[1:30:34] not I said I'm not
[1:30:37] either but he said you're looking at
[1:30:39] what you
[1:30:40] are quit looking at what you
[1:30:45] are and look at what he
[1:30:48] is quit looking at what you are you're a
[1:30:53] horrible chest
[1:30:56] player you
[1:30:58] stink at
[1:31:02] chess that's just the way it is I do too
[1:31:06] I ain't no good at
[1:31:08] it but I'm not looking at my
[1:31:10] ability I I'm looking at the grandmas
[1:31:15] yeah that's who I'm looking at you don't
[1:31:17] look at your own abilities I I've got
[1:31:19] this in my life I got that in my life
[1:31:21] quit looking at that yeah look at the
[1:31:24] one that can take that
[1:31:26] away we we we're looking too too much at
[1:31:29] ourselves and then some people are
[1:31:31] totally off the opposite of that look
[1:31:33] how great I
[1:31:34] am look at me look at me everybody pH me
[1:31:37] on Facebook 40 times a week you can look
[1:31:39] at me how good I
[1:31:43] am you stink at chest just like the rest
[1:31:45] of us
[1:31:47] amen everybody in
[1:31:50] here but it's not you playing it's the
[1:31:53] one inside you playing that's the king
[1:31:56] in here I I hope I hope this is is is
[1:31:58] getting through and I know it's simple
[1:32:01] it ain't deep I'm never I'm never deep
[1:32:05] so I know I got a lot of quotes in that
[1:32:07] but it's just a just the way it
[1:32:09] is though I speak this is mighty
[1:32:12] conqueror though I speak with tongues of
[1:32:13] men and
[1:32:14] angels and have not love I am nothing
[1:32:16] but become as a sounding brass and a
[1:32:18] tinkling symbol though I have love to
[1:32:20] move mountains and have not and have not
[1:32:22] love I am nothing I I have power to move
[1:32:24] mountains and have not love I am nothing
[1:32:27] so if we're going to play this
[1:32:28] game as we would call it if we're going
[1:32:31] to win we've got to get
[1:32:33] back to the winning
[1:32:37] principle all these great signs and
[1:32:39] wonders that we've seen to God we give
[1:32:41] praise but if those things isn't built
[1:32:44] upon Godly Christian love and respects
[1:32:46] for God and his people it'll fail in
[1:32:49] other words you got to play the game
[1:32:51] right yes you got to play it the way God
[1:32:54] intended you got to give the glory to
[1:32:55] God not
[1:32:57] yourself just because you you prayed for
[1:33:00] somebody and they got well you you
[1:33:01] shouldn't get the glory you ain't the
[1:33:03] one that made him well you ain't the one
[1:33:05] that healed him it was God just CU you
[1:33:07] preached a a message in in 400 people
[1:33:10] came to the altar you don't go sing your
[1:33:12] own
[1:33:13] Praises that was God clearing the
[1:33:16] board that was nothing you done why
[1:33:19] because you're supposed to get yourself
[1:33:20] out of the way
[1:33:21] anyways it's not you it's the king
[1:33:25] amen what's the littlest piece on there
[1:33:27] is that a
[1:33:28] rook
[1:33:30] Pawn you're smaller than
[1:33:32] that so am
[1:33:34] I we don't even belong on the board but
[1:33:36] it's his grace that put you
[1:33:40] there God will always get
[1:33:45] Glory you know when I studying this
[1:33:50] and you know thinking God always get
[1:33:52] glory for everything thing even in this
[1:33:54] game of life it's not you that wins it
[1:33:56] and I got to thinking of the blind man
[1:34:00] blind
[1:34:01] barus and as Jesus passed by he saw a
[1:34:04] man who was blind from
[1:34:07] birth and his disciples asked him saying
[1:34:09] master who did Sin this man or his
[1:34:12] parents that he was born blind and Jesus
[1:34:13] said neither hath
[1:34:16] sinned nor this man nor his parents but
[1:34:18] the works of God should be made manifest
[1:34:24] you know I got to thinking about that
[1:34:25] that God
[1:34:26] arranged the board in this man's
[1:34:32] life he was born defeated it looked like
[1:34:36] yeah born
[1:34:37] defeated
[1:34:40] blind and you know and they thought well
[1:34:43] somebody had sinned either he him or his
[1:34:45] parents and we we look at things in our
[1:34:46] life we think this thing is going wrong
[1:34:48] because I've done this or because I've
[1:34:50] done that that's the Enemy talking to
[1:34:51] you
[1:34:53] I've done this so God's punishing me for
[1:34:55] this if it's something you ask for
[1:34:57] forgiveness
[1:34:58] from God don't see it no
[1:35:01] more so it was they were looking as God
[1:35:05] Who had who had Sinn him or his his
[1:35:07] parents and Jesus had neither this is so
[1:35:10] that that the works of God should be
[1:35:12] made manifested in him that's so the God
[1:35:14] would receive
[1:35:16] Glory that's what it's all about is God
[1:35:18] receiving Glory it's not about you and I
[1:35:21] this whole thing that we're in it's
[1:35:23] about God yes you know we're we're so
[1:35:26] close to to the end and we've got I just
[1:35:30] I don't know how to say this there's so
[1:35:32] many things H you know I believe we're
[1:35:34] trying to get make a Rapture I believe
[1:35:36] with all my heart the messages that
[1:35:38] we've been hearing of forgiveness and
[1:35:40] getting um nothing
[1:35:43] between you and a brother your sisters
[1:35:46] nothing between that and I believe we're
[1:35:48] getting a point for in a Rapture in in
[1:35:51] in in this body you can't have nothing
[1:35:53] between you and God God if I would ask
[1:35:55] you raise your hand who who wants
[1:35:57] something between you and God
[1:36:02] nobody but we we have things between
[1:36:05] each other we pit the game against each
[1:36:10] other God's going to take the bride out
[1:36:13] as a
[1:36:14] body and he can't do that till all
[1:36:18] that's laid
[1:36:19] aside anything you have against the
[1:36:22] brother or sister until that's laid
[1:36:25] aside you're going to remain in this
[1:36:27] game on and on and
[1:36:33] on when the bride recognizes who she
[1:36:36] is that's a body move that's not me
[1:36:40] recognizing I'm bride that's not me
[1:36:42] recognizing hey I'm winning this game
[1:36:44] brother Jackie's winning the game
[1:36:45] brother Rob's winning the game it's not
[1:36:46] that it's when the bride gets to the
[1:36:48] point to realize I've won this game now
[1:36:52] I know who I am
[1:36:54] that's that's when you get the
[1:36:56] trophy Lord that's when you get the the
[1:37:01] final the
[1:37:03] Rapture it's it's not it's not about
[1:37:05] just you playing we've got to help each
[1:37:09] other yeah and we can't do that when we
[1:37:11] got these things in between
[1:37:14] us let's stand
[1:37:18] together I hope what what I said has
[1:37:20] made sense to you tonight
[1:37:23] yes amen you know I I
[1:37:34] didn't I don't know that you truly got
[1:37:36] it the way I did but I I hope
[1:37:39] so when you look at it it's it's not
[1:37:42] about it's not about us anymore it's
[1:37:44] about
[1:37:45] God it's about your
[1:37:47] king you know we we sing all these songs
[1:37:50] of Grace what he's done for us the mercy
[1:37:54] that he's done to to us I was talking to
[1:37:57] a brother I had lunch with a brother
[1:37:58] today he's talking about all the I said
[1:38:00] there's you know everybody that
[1:38:02] everybody here has got things in their
[1:38:03] life that you don't want nobody to know
[1:38:05] about you don't want nobody to know
[1:38:07] about you got and but you think of God's
[1:38:09] grace that brought you over that that
[1:38:12] brought you you know if they put every
[1:38:14] one of our sins on the on the screen
[1:38:16] this tonight we'd all leave
[1:38:18] embarrassed but it was his
[1:38:21] grace he said let me play the game for
[1:38:23] you you because you're going to get
[1:38:25] worse you're going to get worse but you
[1:38:27] got to get to a point where you have
[1:38:29] faith you got to move God by
[1:38:32] faith it's it's not your own
[1:38:34] abilities you have none we have no
[1:38:38] abilities if you could tell me anybody
[1:38:40] in here can tell me one ability that you
[1:38:42] have that God
[1:38:45] needs one human ability that you have or
[1:38:49] anybody has that God is really dying to
[1:38:52] use
[1:38:55] comes down to one thing he just loves
[1:38:57] you so much that's why he keeps us
[1:38:59] around he don't need us he don't need us
[1:39:02] to do anything he needs us to love him
[1:39:06] back we we can't comprehend God's love
[1:39:09] is it always amazed me you know when the
[1:39:11] Bible says you know that that you know
[1:39:14] no greater love than a man laid down his
[1:39:15] life for his brother there's no greater
[1:39:18] love but there was a different
[1:39:20] love there was a love that we can't
[1:39:22] comprehend and that was when a God took
[1:39:25] his own son and killed him for
[1:39:30] you we a there ain't a dad in here to
[1:39:33] take your son and kill him for anybody
[1:39:35] because you don't understand that kind
[1:39:36] of love that's how God loves you that's
[1:39:40] why he's willing to move these pieces
[1:39:42] for you you just got to trust him got to
[1:39:45] have faith it doesn't matter if it's
[1:39:46] cancer it doesn't matter you you can
[1:39:48] come in here and criticize and be a
[1:39:50] critical spirit all you want to it
[1:39:52] doesn't matter
[1:39:54] matter it doesn't matter you're not
[1:39:56] going to change God no you're not going
[1:39:58] to change the holy spirit amen you might
[1:40:00] grieve
[1:40:02] him but he'll never lose power it's
[1:40:05] power
[1:40:08] hits I pray that something was said that
[1:40:11] would help
