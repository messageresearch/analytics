prayer requests for brother James Turrell let's remember him brother Brandon Green would like for us to remember his boss and family and prayer his grandfather is in hospice care just asking the Lord

called atrial fibrillation the top part of heart beats too fast and you have an increased risk of a stroke etc the doctor gave me some choices because it's happened a couple of times because of the chemo it caused my heart to the heart strong functionally but the electrical part is not so I don't know exactly how to proceed he offered me a pill every day plus blood thinner or a pill that I could take if it goes into bad rhythm just take it and it would put my heart back in rhythm but every time that happens it increases your chance of doing it again so anyways I don't want to take blood thinner I don't want to take the daily pill but what does he want so if you would cuz he said if we asked he would help us understand what to do cuz he gives us doctors he gives us dentist and all these things to help us so if you wouldn't mind pray with me that he would leave me in the direct way I'm healed I mean God will do it again he's done it once but sometimes he leads us in paths and we

appreciate all those that put forth all the effort to make that possible for our young people brother David did a great job and speaking the singing and all of that together so appreciate it from most of you dolt that were not there it was rooted in us and real blessing not for us to give all of those that did all that if we could just and I say anything where's the lawyer how many has a major tonight or more than one maybe multiple we believe they're serving a god to nine it is so mindful of our needs more than likely the Avenue by which our needs will be supplied is through the eyes of our heart when our eyes and a heart become open to understand maybe not just necessarily what I need is but know that he who understands I need as the sufficiency to be able to take care of him sometimes he says yes sometimes she says no sometimes he says wait a while but whenever he does if we believe he's sovereign and he's in control then we know that his his desire is for our good you believe that remember he loves you exactly the same way he loves the Lord Jesus would he ever hold anything from the Lord Jesus that was good for him can you ever stop eleven you know thou lovest them as thou lovest me and thou lovest me from before the foundation of the world that had nothing to do with you that doesn't it was your choice that doesn't do with how good you are and I'll flip it around that doesn't do that bad you were here it had to do with him choosing us in himself open the eyes of my heart Lord was singing together shall we when I spread the David to come and just bring to us to not what the Lord is placed upon his heart it's a great night to be together in it [Music] praise the Lord so no matter what you have made of [Music] what I wanna see everybody now [Music] [Music] shiny your glory you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey Archie glad he can open our eyes because we was blind one day but Jesus opened our eyes let's just buy our hearts if you win Lord we want to thank you tonight for vision to be able to see not just naturally but to be able to see spiritual things in your word we know Lord that you told us when you was here that you hid things from the eyes of the wise and the prudent but you revealed them unto babes and Lord that's why we want to be we want to be as children that whatever you would say them Lord we could take it to heart or we wouldn't have to take and meditate it and wonder if it's right and wondering how it's all going to work we want to be like little children that whenever the father the mother would say something they would simply believe them because they always told them the truth Lord you've never lied in lying isn't I even in your character you've given us great truth in this day you've sent us this great endtime message Lord and you have opened our eyes to be able to see it and for that we are so thankful tonight father well yes Lord for these next few moments a time that you would just come now help us Lord as we look into your word that you would just take it Lord break it to our hearts Lord that we could have understanding we pray while we ask that you would just come and charge the atmosphere that's here in this place tonight Lord that we can look into the things Lord that has great value to the heart of Uri lay and we ask that Lord that you'd help me to be able to step aside Lord that you can just use this Lord I'm aware Lord of my ability lord it's so small but my confidence isn't in man my confidence is in you and this congregation Lord they've come to hear something from your word tonight and I pray Lord that you would help us in Jesus name and everybody said a man god bless you we greet you in the name of Lord Psalms 102 verse 13 certainly good to be here this weekend with you in the house the Lord and just under anticipation for what the Lord is going to say you believe you'll speak to us amen he never disappoints Psalms 102 verse 13 thou shall arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her yay the set time has come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favored the dust thereof so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord so he's going to appear in glory he shall appear and he's also going to create a people nurse shall praise him for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the Lord behold the earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner and to loose those that are appointed to death I'd like to speak to you tonight on loose from the house of your bondsman may the Lord has blessings for the word you can be seated tonight we appreciate the opportunity to be here with you in the service and the house of the Lord we know by looking at the Old Testament that the Old Testament would be a shadow or a type of what God's going to do for us in the New Testament the Prophet would say that if you see the shadow you'd have a pretty good understanding by looking at the shadow of what's actually coming in reality and we know that within God of course we know was all these attributes that was within his being of course the attribute of being a healer and then attribute of being a deliverer Savior Redeemer all those things that laid within our God we know that God would actually through shadow and through time he would take and begin to unveil the mystery of his attributes that laid within him down through time even through the shadow of the old testament and we know that corss God would unfold himself that God would reveal himself by the characteristics of what his name is and we realized that God who of course would have never he would have never allowed sin to be able to come in he would have never allowed sickness to be able to come in he'd never allowed unbelief to be able to take place had he not had a way to be able to redeem back every one of his children that would come underneath it so before actually there was ever a time that men would fall that yet within God's mind he had already had a way by attribute to be able to bring back his sons and we know that God of course is a great Redeemer you believe that he is not only Redeemer but we know that our God is a restorer and not only is he restore but we know that we returns down to the Old Testament that God would give us glimpses of his mercy glimpses of his love and how that he would betray himself and he would begin to show grace and actually many times that he would show favor and many times the favor that he would show would be things that is unmerited they really didn't deserve it but yet God would have to show mercy they really didn't earn it but yet God would show mercy to them and we know that he would of course show this unmerited favor unto his children even from the very beginning whenever the garden was put there and how that God of course I had seen that when the woman had failed and that saying had came in and we know that course that there was something that was laying within Adam that God would bring out a characteristic within Adam that Adam would not leave her in this fallen state but Adam of course being made in the image of God being made in the likeness of God that of course wouldn't leave her like that but you realize something calls to Adam to stand for his wife and even though she was in a faulted condition Adam of course would stand beside her and we see it's a display of favor it's an act of love it's an act of mercy and not only an adamant of course Adam was only reflecting God how that God of course would reveal his attributes of mercy even from the beginning he would show His redemptive attributes when it would come to his children he would actually express this kind of Allah and we see how they God would would come down into the garden as the puppets say they would be there in the evening time as they would come together to be able to fellowship with one another but this evening is different than most evenings Adam does not show up at the place of that's been provided to worship the woman does not show up in the place that's been provided to worship so God of course the Bible would tell us that God he would actually begin to run he would run through the garden screaming out Adam or art thou in that something that God would come down he would come down into the garden and express attributes he would come running through the garden looking behind the trees as it was looking behind the rocks he's running through the garden and he's hollering out Adam or art thou and the puffy would say it like this and in the inner Vail he said notice it's nothing that you do or what you can do it's what God notice it's what God's done for you in Christ and no man never sought God no man never sought God man don't seek God God seeks man the very beginning in the Garden of Eden it proved it now watch God's going to start this from the very beginning he's going to prove that man does not seek after God but that God comes running after man and he tells us that from the very beginning he proved it that Adam Adam ought to have been running through the garden whoring father father were art thou but it was God that was running through the Garden of Eden saying Adam over art thou think of that big God was searching for something even though we would say well Adam was lost wall we looked at loss different than the way God looks at los alamos not lost as in Ana was completely out of each of God Adam was not at a reach of god but God come running down through the garden and he's searching for Adam he's looking for Adam in my he was screaming out but him says at one place he was screaming out Adam or art thou to think of that that in all-knowing God a God that knows the beginning to the end is running through the garden screaming Adam where art thou a God that knows about every flea that would everybody'd sigh God that would know everything that's about you he would know every animal he would be able to name the stars he'd be able to name every plant that there is but yet here God is in the garden and he's running and he's screaming out Adam where art thou God no Brad a wash he's an all-knowing God he knows exactly where Adam was God but ask in a deloria's because he didn't know that he's displaying attributes of mercy he's displaying attributes of redemption he's displaying attributes of love to give Adam of space to be able to repent and to come searching for him God went looking for him and Adam should have went looking for God but it was it to be because men don't seek God God seeks after man oh god know that and wasn't behind the bushes where he was looking at he knowed he wasn't behind the tree or behind the rock he knew where he was hiding that but God still yet was displaying some redemptive quality hey man be the light because Adam belong to God Adam was God's Son Adam belong to God God created Adam and God but I'm gonna give Adam to the devil and I'm gonna give you I said God gonna give you to the devil you're not the devil's property you don't belong to the devil you're God's attributes that he can reach down to where you're at we see how that when Adam stepped out of his position of sonship once he steps out of his place that there begins to be a pull upon the attribute of God but now the attribute can actually come to display and they become the manifestations we'd say the attribute has to be pulled on in order to send God into action on your behalf that attribute has to be pulled off you want to know him as healer you've got to pull upon that attribute of healer you want to know him as restored you've got to pull on that attribute to restore what if God do God killed a lamb God kill the lamb they've been amazing he didn't tell Adam you go kill your lamb why didn't he tell Adam to go find the lamb why didn't he tell him to go kill a lamb but notice Adam wasn't gonna provide this sacrifice but God was going to provide this sacrifice if God created everything in the garden - bye - bye - bye - then tell me where did that lamb come from you tell me where that lamb come from and I'll tell you where that RAM on the mountain with Abraham come from you tell me where that RAM on the mountain with Abraham come from and you tell me where those squirrels and the trees that day Kentucky come from our God is a creator and he was going to create a body to be able to show rediff - worked all of mankind he's telling you oh my can imagine when he wraps those skins around his children God's letting them know this is your way back this is how you come back it's because they're God's children they're God's people even when it come to Israel Israel did not choose Jehovah to be their God and you did not choose cross but Jesus Christ chose you st. John 15:16 you've not chosen me but I've chosen you that you're damned that you should go forth and bring forth fruit so truly God chose Israel and God's the one that made the covenant with Israel now there's many of nations that God could have chose that's true there was a meaning that God could have chose besides Israel but I want to tell you there was nations that was a minimum number that God could have chose there was those as we would say that would have been oh my there was a better farmers that could bring forth better crops there was those people that was better and better educated than what they was there was those that was made of a of a higher advanced civilization but God looked beyond numbers God look beyond culture God look beyond civilization or hallelujah God look beyond education God don't save a man because he's smart God don't save a man because he's similar God saves a man because he purchased him back him by his blood he comes hurry Dean back sons God moves by the promise of his word and God looked at his word all friends don't you see God cannot bypass his word I said he cannot bypass his word Israel with God's people Israel being blessed it's not what Israel did for themselves it's what God done for them it is Rabine holy it's not what they did within themselves it's what God blessed them by if they're redeemed it's what God did for them notice indeed romani 7/6 that the scripture says for thou art a holy people that means set apart you're separated so God tells Israel you're a separated people you're separated into the LORD thy God and the Lord thy God have chosen thee he's chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the earth God chose these people they're gonna be a holy people now they don't mean they're gonna be without false they don't mean they're gonna be without mistakes they don't mean they're gonna make every decision right we know they didn't come up but I want to tell you it's beyond what man sees listen this ain't them calling themselves holy this is God : he's speaking by the utterance of his word and God's telling him you are holy Deuteronomy 7 and 7 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you're the fewest of all the people but because the Lord loves you hallelujah the Lord loves you notice he said because he would keep the oath he has love has been given by an oath and God must keep his word he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your father's that the Lord brought you all this of this has the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and he redeems you he redeems you out of the house of the bondsman he redeems you out of the house of the bondsman notice how the house of the bondsman from the hand of Pharaoh king of sin [Applause] he redeemed you out of the house of the bondsman out of the king of all sin that's where he got you at he was blacked out in sin but I want to tell you God tell her you is that and he loosed you from the house of that puzzle notice the principle of this Lucy is that God which gives his oath and what God would give his oath he is now required because he must keep his word he would loose his people with a mighty hand so then it's the oaths of God the very spoken word of God God would use his word and he's bound to his word that he would loose his people because he loved them he loved them now this word love here it literally means covenant love it means marital love or what we call elective love now if it's st. John 3:16 for God so loved the world that's not married to love that's Paul's mouth love that's just like if I had a piece of candy in my hair and I could take us for God so loved the world I could give that to every person that's in this building but when you talk about elective love you take that one piece and you give it to one individual and you're showing favor to that one individual and let me tell that's the way God chose you he come to her you as a he found you in the house of that bondsman I showed you his love - normally 14-day for down - holy people the LORD thy God and the Lord has chosen thee to be a peculiar people they don't mean strange that only not that means a treasured people hallelujah hallelujah thou art a treasure he scene value in you I'm gonna setting in he seemed value in that you know God looks within his people and he said he's chosen thee because you are a peculiar treasure and himself above all the denominations that are upon the earth and the Lord has a vouched he's a vouched thee this day to be his treasured people as he promised thee that thou should us keep all of his Commandments look at this word of vouched it means arm art to speak to utter to say in one's heart to think to command to promise to intend to be said to be called to make a vow by speaking the Lord has made a vow by speaking he has a vows so God's Word is over his people now notice his words not based upon how good you are come on it's not based upon merits of Deeds and merits of her but he advanced he spoke his word over you and listen it's his word that holds you he spoke his word of risk of people and he commanded and said you are mines first night cleaning to make the high above all nations which he had made in praise he made you in praise he didn't want you to be a bunch of grouch he want a bunch of sad face people he made you to be a people in praise and he named that thou may us be a holy people and to the LORD thy God what's the amount as he hath spoken because he spoke his word over them you're a high above all nations because of the spoken word because of his spoken word you'll receive preferential treatment you receive favor from God because his Lord has a vouched to you isaiah says it like this thou who not taken from the ends of the earth and i'd called me to be a chief of me in thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant what's this part I have chosen thee and not cast thee away it ain't that they haven't give him reason come on somebody it's not because they weren't perfect and they want pol it and they never do nothin wrong it's because his word is over the earth and because his word is over the earth he simply cannot cast them away as though they don't belong to him he's tell him I can't throw you away I can't cast you away why because my love is a vast hallelujah which means she's chosen he sets his word upon her and he can't change his mind of his word as their 4301 but now the set the Lord that created thee Oh Jacob he that formed thee O Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art mine so there not here's my chance come on they're not there just by coincidence he created this people he formed this people and he redeemed you he loosed you because he called you by name hallelujah whenever she would fall when she would become disobedient to God's Word when she started looking at these other gods God simply cannot just forget about her and she did she went the horn that's other gods but God cannot forget about her so what's he gonna do they start pulling upon those attributes within him and he would display attributes of mercy they didn't deserve it but mercy ain't something you deserved he would show favor let me say this there's nothing that can stop our God our God will run after his people God I ran after Adam the father ran after the prodigal son come on in so much it would almost look like the very love of God is reckless it wouldn't look like God's love it's so reckless it looks like he would just allow anything and anything goes and whatever happens let me tell you something friends it looks like God's love is reckless but I want to tell you it's a left of lunch and he cannot forget about who he created I want to tell you here's a love will chase you down I believe that tonight there ain't no shadows as a songwriter said there ain't no shadow he won't light up there's no mountains he won't climb up there's all he's coming to get you hallelujah there ain't no whoa he won't kick down there ain't no life he won't tear down there ain't no seal he won't tread down he's coming after you there ain't no place so dark hallelujah there ain't no place so dark that God's hand can't reach down and be able to pick you up how the muck in the Mar this world nothing can stop our God I said nothing can stop our God there ain't no condition so bad there ain't no drug habit so bad there ain't no alcoholism so bad that our God's hand can't reach right down into the Mara that unbelief and pull them back to where they're supposed to be sin can't get that black that God can't get to him he's a vouched he's a vouch for his children it would almost look reckless how much he loves her that he would display within the scripture that he would tell a prophet I want you to go marry a woman of the Hoarders sounds reckless still it sounds reckless but God's love would actually favor a prophet and tell him go take a woman of the whoredoms and Hosea being obedient Hosea I want to turn the Lord Senator Hosea don't take into the a wife of the whoredoms and the children of Hoarders that shouldn't offend you that God can take children's out of whoredoms that shouldn't offends you that God can take children as denominations that shouldn't offends you that God's reach can reach right there and talk and follow sysm right down in the Catholic come on its end offends you that God can take and bring his children right out from a monster's whoredoms for the Lord had committed great whoredom the land it would committed great whoredom departing from the Lord so he went and took go home or the daughter knobbly of notice this woman did not go looking for Hosea come on but notice this woman she wasn't trying to find him oh no Hosea was been a vouched by God's Word and so the world said Hosea looking for this woman if Hosea being obedient to God oh my he's displaying something within his life so Hosea finds this woman he marries this woman he loves this woman he cares about this one what's Hosea do it he's reflecting Almighty God [Applause] you thank God quit loving is or when she went down into whoredoms there ain't no sin that can stop God's love it almost looks reckless come on oh my for a while while they're married everything seems good everything seems fine he pride provides for her oh my he takes care of her but some of those old paramours some of her old lovers got to coming back around and pulling on this woman some of them old ladder started coming back around and all my she found herself in the arms of her old paramours now let me tell you about this one she had no intention of going back to hosea she has no intent listen she ain't come running back to him saying forgive me I'd done wrong let's make this work that's not what she's doing but Hosea we're running after her why God's display the attributes of his love within Hosea by looking for this woman what has she done to married him to do this what has she done to deserve him to come looking for her she ain't done one thing this made her a recognizes she's wrong and decided to come back to God this isn't her trying to work things out come out this is Hosea he went down to where she was I said he found her and he got her out of the lap of her paramours he found her with her lovers and he called her out of the house of whoredoms [Music] and neither did you try to work things out with Jesus you never sought after God come on we was out in the world living in the pleasures of the world after he left the world walking last the world Jeffster laughter we was in the arms of the paramours of Laodicea come on church he found you living in sin who looks like this is reckless Hosea it looks reckless that you would do this God's just expressing attributes notice the Bible says in Hosea 2:14 so therefore behold I will lure her I will over her and bring her to the wilderness and speak comfortably to her she ain't trying to find him I'm gonna bring her and I notice he's going to bring her out he's going to carry her out you talking about grace you talking about God's love you talking about God's mercy he's bringing this parallel for what God had done for Israel is now what this prophet is doing for this woman for God brought them out of the house of the bondsmen of Israel and now here is this prophet a man hears a prophet carrying her out of the house of her paramours taking a rat from the arms of her lover's he called Egypt out of sin into the wilderness the first Exodus he called them out here in the 3rd Exodus he's calling the bride out of the church watch he called Abraham and a Babylon and singing to the wilderness he called Israel out of sin and he led them to the wilderness and now he has to lure the church away from those old Paramore so it might look reckless that God would go looking among that system to find it but I want to tell you God's got some children down there he had some people down there people that he created people that he for they his love can I cast aside and do away with us he went searching for her hallelujah and he went searching for you and I so he goes beyond the camp just for her and he tells her I'm gonna lure you out here until the wilderness and when I get you to the wilderness I'm going to speak comfortably to you so he's not just gonna give her the written word but I'm gonna speak comfortably to her so she's gonna have more than just written she's gonna have spoken words a living voice from a living man to a living group she's gonna hear that original seed hallelujah right from the mouth of hosea the prophet notice his terminology speak comfortably it literally means to speak to the one's heart hallelujah he's speaking to the heart it means to speak comfortably means to change your heart from a time of mourning to a time of joy notice he's not speaking to her eyes he's not speaking to her head he speaking to her heart Malekith or didn't come to turn your head back so he speaks tenderly to the heart of this woman hallelujah and he's taking and transforming her thinking he's transforming her mind from a time of mourning from a time of dread and he changes her mind to a talent rejoicing he's referring to in Israel could be taken into captivity and it's those as though she's asleep and she's slumbering and she's in captivity she shackled up she's in a miserable condition her heart is mourning because of the condition that her body's in notice what God tells Israel how the amplified awake awake and put on your strengths Hosain put on your beautiful garment o Jerusalem the holy city from henceforth there are so no more coming to you the uncircumcised and the unclean hallelujah I said to him o lovers is done shake yourself from the dust and arise sit erect and a dignified place o Jerusalem loose yourself from the bonds of your neck o captive daughter of Zion not o captive daughter of the world no no captive daughter of Babylon but old captive daughter of Zion he's letting her know you need to wake up and take those chains off shake yourself from the dust you need to arise I've reached down and I've chained those shackles I will loose the shackles from your nests you're not down no more you're not no more evolution now wake up rep you lass who you are recognize what your name is your lose from your Wiseman the Redeemer loosed her but she's gotta recognize what he's done for her she's got to recognize her place she's got to recognize her position she's got to recognize what he's done for her she's got to see it's hard time I said it's your time it's your season it's your hour it's your day take them chains off of your neck I've reached down and I've broke the shackles of your neck let's just reach up and take that shackle off I've already loosed it but just take it off your neck they would put the shackle on the neck and the neck but of course control the head and they would take and put it on the neck to cause the voice to become so whisper or they couldn't even hardly speak well they couldn't even hardly talk wearing that old shackle around their neck and that's what Satan wants to do with the Church of God that's what Satan wants to do with the minister in this hour he wants to put a shackle around their neck they're trying to quieten the voice but I want to tell you the spirit and the bride say come which tells me that God has unloosed us from the house of our buzz' we refuse to be shackled any longer we've got something to do we got something to believe we've got something to say in this hour it's letting her know you gotta cast aside and you're being loosed from the chains of your paramours Isaiah would go on to save her thus saith the Lord you were so for nothing he shall be redeemed you shall be redeemed without money how is that gonna be redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ for thus saith the Lord God my people went down first with some of this they went down first into Egypt to sojourn there my people did my people did and many years later their Syrians oppressed them for nothing now I've delivered you from both Egypt and Assyria you'll remember that's where the sin was so great before the eyes of God and God tells them just like the sin was done in Egypt just like it was in Syria what Ben can prevent me from delivering you at a Babylon laughs I feel like running around this ability can I ask you tonight what devil can stop our God what Idol can stop our God what seeing what sickness what strand of unbelief can stop our God from delivering us from the house of the bondsman tonight butter if a Babylon couldn't stop them if Egypt pen star feel if Assyria couldn't stop you there any nobody can stop them you'll remember Egypt had the greatest military on earth during that time but God sent one man hallelujah I guess the whole army and the whole army could not stop one man [Applause] rise from the dust come to your place come to your position so Jose is going to lure Merl a he must bring her out of the house of her lover's brings her outside confusion brings her outside unbelief it brings her away so she can't focus on nothing else but him and him alone you don't want us focusing on nothing else but him and him alone you know what you look at you looking at him with one eye and look at your paramour so Laodicea with the other eye that somebody wants he wants us to come out into the wilderness away God did not leave us in our sin he did not leave us in our belief but he alerted us away let me tell you this sin was committed and God cannot simply overlook sin it must be dealt with come on I said it must be dealt with once he makes a mandate of his law the law being holy there had to be something that would answer the question of that law that was held against them now she's done wrong Israel's done wrong Hosea's bride done wrong she committed acts she's condemned by the law listen friends we're not trying to get around it we was guilty and God simply cannot overlook his words so it must be dealt with how is he going to do this something has got to lose her and redeem her to bring her back from the law I said something's got to redeem her he must restore the fellowship hallelujah Hosea can not touch it until she gets restored back to what she fell from now remember Isaiah had RA prophesied over Israel concerning their Redemption so she's held by prophecy she's held by God's Word it's prophetic utterance that has being held over her and Isaiah says in the amplified for your husband is your maker the Lord of Hosts is his name your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel who has called who is called the god of the whole earth for the Lord has called you like a wife who has been abandoned and grieved in the spirit a lot of life married in her youth but she was later rejected and scorned says your God so like a wife that has been abandoned and because she had been abandoned by her own reason by her own mistakes it brings grief that's what sin does sin brings guilt come on sin brings grief sin brings condemnation but if there is no sin there is no guilt if there is no sin there is no condemnation Israel sin has caused them to be separated it's caused them to be set apart from him because of their perverseness because of their depravity that they've caused by these other lovers because of their unbelief they caused themselves to be locked up in these houses she feels abandoned but God didn't leave her she left God a woman who was married in her youth he speaking of immaturity she was in a state of immaturity and in her immaturity she ran after these other lovers because of her immaturity she went into default because of her sin she feels this abandonment then Isaiah says this for a brief moment I abandoned you a brief moment I abandoned you but with great compassion come on he's referring to though the law judged us because the law condemned us come on it made us wrong but notice it's just for a brief moment notice the contrast the abandonment was brief but the mercy was great the abandonment was brief but the compassion hallelujah the passion that he would gather her awed by its great then he says in outbursts of Wrath I hid my face as it was just for a moment think about it as though he would just turn his face just for a moment he would look away he would look away just for a moment and that moment at times she felt grief and seeing it in and all the condemnation just for a moment he turns his face Oh but what everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you says the Lord your Redeemer God had to judge that sin and he did Judge it he judged it in the body of Jesus Christ and you should say amen to that because God's wrath fell upon our husband [Applause] why and he turned his face only for a minute our husband took our ass the Sun refused to shine the moon refused to give us life it's always just for a moment he'll Bank is just why because law judge the scene I paid for my sins in the body of my husband we was guilty by birth into this world do you know that's right he was guilty board the nature of a sinner opponents and God's wrath had to be poured out because the soul that sinneth shall surely die something had to be struck my judgment and God's law could not be broken due to the consequences of breaking and God could not not keep his word something had to appease God's justice thus in question had to be answered something had to bring me back to fellowship something had to redeem you how the house of your bondsman we was born in the falling condition we was born in a fallen state come on that's not the way we should have been here we're signs were daughters we're attributes of God we live in a fallen world you know this was right we live in a fallen creation and everything's groaning and travailing and pain right you live in a fallen world and we know we're living in that kind of a condition this nation has fallen morals has fallen come on marriage has fallen that's the state and condition everything that's around us the bodies we live in they're falling the earth is groaning the bodies we live in we see it every day oh my nobody born saved everybody was born in this condition we was born shackled up we was born in the house of the bondsman we didn't have a choice come on I said God put us here God planned us here God placed us here no matter what kind of value made he was still in that condition he's allowed there better I'll make things matter I'll stop this I'll quit this he was still in a falling condition but the abandonment was just brief just for a moment my only hope has that God would reach their tour I was at he would reach down to where you was at that his arms would reach all the way Tory was at and he would get a hold of you and that's what we need and listen friends that's what Israel needed that's why I don't need it that's what we needed we needed rescued from ourselves this is why we need deliverance preached in the house of God this is why we need Liberty to preach in the house of God hallelujah I needed deliverance and you need to deliverance but I couldn't help myself and you couldn't help yourself we're his victims he was in this house of this bondsman I needed something that could take and stop my fall I need something that could get a hold of me just like you needed something to get a hold of you to stop this fall we were sinking in the depravity of sin and living in the arms of paramours of Laodicea I needed something that was strong enough you needed something that was strong enough hallelujah there was only one that can do it the one who have bounced for you Hosea's wife was in a falling condition but Hosea didn't give up on her he cannot simply cast her away and God cannot cast Israel way and God cannot cast you away but that Ash have you been pulled on the love it compels him to go looking for you he may have found me like that but he didn't leave me like that he may have found you like that but he didn't leave you like that I'm told that I gotta reach down into the sand where you was at he's God that's rich in mercy you believe that didn't matter the condition it didn't matter how Baxley didn't matter how much of a drunk it didn't matter how much don't be stuck in your veins he can't forget about you so God got ahold of you God chose more grace than what man chose it's as though his love is so reckless that there ain't no boundary he won't cross there ain't no situation he won't get down into it's though it's just reckless love that had all cost exactly at all cost I said it all cost he would get a hold of you oh my had it been me and you I'm sure we wouldn't we give up on ourselves a long time ago we win at Oh God he should have just left us in the house of our lovers come out but I want to tell you Hosea couldn't give up on her Adam couldn't give up on her and God take him up on you the arm of God saved us by his power God's arm symbolizes his strength his arm symbolizes Redemption his arm symbolizes power lower to God so we had the strength of God we got the redemption of God and we got the power of for David set like this and Psalms 98 more in a hurry Oh singing the Lord a new song sing unto the Lord a new song not the songs of your paramours not the songs are those who lovers sing a new song unto the Lord for he had done marvelous things his right hand and his holy arm has gotten him it has gotten him the victory Jeremiah would top it like this all Lord God behold thou has made the heaven and the earth by by great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee but maybe you just don't understand my situation you don't understand my God's Word there's nothing too hard for thee but you don't know what I'm dealing with you don't know the power that my God has you don't know his capability I said there is nothing too hard for the Lord [Applause] Moses would tell us in Deuteronomy 719 the great temptations which that I saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the Lord that God brought thee so God was going to bring them out and he was going to do it by his arm so he put a man in his hand he's always used man come out and he always will use man what does he need just get somebody surrendered in his head God's never been left without a witness stretch that arm we're about the Lord that God brought the out so Israel came out of Egypt by stretched out arm he redeemed them from sin by his arm with his power that's the six six wherefore saying to the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage and I'm gonna read a new with a stretched-out I don't think you're understanding me which stretched out arms he's gonna read English with stretched out arms he would redeem us from the life of our paramours with how stretched their arms he will reach down to were you as a what's he the revealing the mystery retention how about stretched out arms he would redeem there he would catch you in your sia he would reach down towards there was a stretch arms hallelujah don't you see he caught you that they're covering he caught you that day he redeems you that day he showed us he would reach all the way from heaven all the way down to the blackness of this earth and with a stretched out arm how he would stop the fall he would catch you from the fall how with an outstretched arm he's agonizing because your sins was heavy but he caught you your life was marked but he caught you with an outstretched arm God was a spirit and a spirit can't bleed so he had to stretch himself from heaven all the way they'll burst I said he stretched his arms all the way from heaven all the way down he became one of us he became a man how about stretched out arms he come down into a body he condon send into a body he had to create something that's what he'd done in the garden that's what he'd done for Abraham rather that's what he's got to do for you he's Jehovah Jireh he's a provider and Adam's race was facing abandonment so God allowed sin he allowed this the judgment of sin to strike him and just for a moment it's as though his head was turned from us we needed a cover we needed his eyes upon us we needed his mercy upon us he realized we needed him to look upon us did not Isaiah tell us who has believed our report and to whom come on is the arm of the Lord revealed whom is the arm of the Lord revealed what's he's showing us he come down and become a man he shall grow up before him as a tender plant has a root how's the dry ground is no former covenant but when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he was despised rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it was this we hid as it were our faces did not I had him hide did not they not hide they heard he was despised and we esteemed him not his grief so great because he taunted Sinan and stretched out his arms oh my he realised it's as though one would hide his face it means to hide his face the hiding of face is a sign of guilt the hiding of the face as a sign of condemnation it's a sign of being a cursed it means to look away because it's so detestable that you can't hardly stand it that he would have to look away are you with me now he realized it would be a top of leprosy that the leper would be required to cover up his face and Jesus became a leper for me all but God would unfold the mystery of it whenever Moses went down there that day into Egypt and he would take that hand which had no leprosy at all and he would reach it into his bosom and he would pull it out and I'd be in the last stages of leprosy but it wouldn't stay that way he would reach back into his bosom and he would pull that hand back out and the hand would be back to its original condition it was before the leprosy struck it don't you see friends that's the story of your life the first time he was born he was pulled from the bosom of God he was born in a lepers condition but leprosy all over you why did God do he took your life and he puts you back into his bosom hallelujah he puts you back into his bosom and when you come out of the bosom of cross he was back to your original condition where he never sinned in the first place you never had leprosy to begin with I wasn't born to be a leper I was born to be a child of God a son of God but here to put me into his visor that's what he did that their Calvary he reached into his bosom and he pulled you back out to bring you back Oh God and then what would he do shine his face upon you the face shining is a sign of grace his face as a sign of his presence hallelujah oh my god commended the priesthood to tell the people to let his face shine on you for numbers would saying number six twenty-three speaking to Aaron and his son saying on this wise he shall bless the children of Israel watch this not curse them but this is a sign of blessings the Lord bless thee and keep thee the Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the word gracious means to show favor number says the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they should put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them his face is a sign of His grace his countless lifted upon you as a sign of peace it's a sign of favor it's a sign of mercy it's a sign of love think about it simply because he stretched out his arms and reached down to where you was at it wasn't because she was deserving of it and neither was I it's because he have vouched his love and by that love covenant he knew exactly where you would be yet he knew what you'd be dealing with he knew what you'd be going through he knew what trouble you'd have but let me tell you if he can deliver his children out of Egypt if he can deliver them out of Assyria then tell me what can stop me from delivering you now right here in the most wicked day that there ever has been tell me what can keep God from getting the hold of you stretched out arms he stretched all the way down to the Laodicea and he unlocked those shackles from their neck and he said arise awake and arise you're free rise from the dust arise put on these attributes of God sit in this place I've redeemed you by mighty hand let's bow our hearts a few fish praise be to God praise be to God oh I feel the presence of God in this place I don't know who I'm preaching to deny but let me tell you I believe that God can reach down no matter how far down you are that's the kind of God that we serve even right now he's even that way right now you may look at yourself and you may even despise yourself you may despise maybe some words it comes out of your mouth thoughts that comes to your mind maybe you despise that but I want to tell you he was despised for you he was stricken for you he suffered pain for you that you can be free too that you don't have to be bound by that old bondsman no longer you don't have to be left in the house of mourning he's come to speak to your heart to turn your heart back to bring comfort to you that's the kind of God we serve that's the kind of God we serve Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are so thankful Lord that you've reached down to where we are at Laura not because we was deserving it's just because we're your sons we're your daughters of God for your children your offspring your progeny and what can't you do to get us back no doubt Lord to the eyes of many it looks almost reckless the way that you can get us but what man don't understand what the world don't understand is nothing can stop you nothing's gonna stop you from getting your people there ain't nothing that can stop you from getting to us oh Jesus Lord if you've got a run force you'll run after us or whatever we hid behind wherever is that whatever denomination we hid behind you knew where we was at that's why you stretched out your arms

strong and so forceful in the Greek that it is actually a demand an intent a desire that is so fervent I will that those that thou gavest me may be with me where I am what if he wills it guess what it
