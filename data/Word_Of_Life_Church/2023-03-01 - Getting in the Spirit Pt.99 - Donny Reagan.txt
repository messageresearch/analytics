Jesus can you imagine living in the Old Testament the days of Moses Joshua the judges Prophets The Patriarchs and you would have heard their prophecies and tried to understand that there would come a day when God would move out of a house and live in human bodies it would have been just you think really you've got to be kid God would want to do that yes he actually did want to do that think what a privileged people We Are Tonight that we have deity living in our human bodies are we blessed but brother Donnie I got a headache I got a backache I'm going through this half the other but my brother's sister the healing power of Jesus Christ lives in your body tonight amen praise the Lord let's turn to one of those prophets of the Old Testament Zechariah chapter 6 verse 11. now this is one of those that we was speaking about a week or so ago that God would take a scenario in that day and would speak it in a prophetic way this is one of those situations it's the rebuilding of course of the temple and God did it in different phases Nehemiah had a part Zachariah Malachi haggai were Minor Prophets as they were called they were prophets of this rebuilding time zerubbabel which is another great man that God used Nehemiah the cut Bearer now we've moved over into another phase of that whenever God is going to have them to make a crown for Joshua and this is not Joshua course in the time of Moses but it's another one which was a lineage of a priest and God is going to have the prophet Zechariah to make this crown but yet God is going to have Zechariah to speak Words which will come into existence hundreds and hundreds of years after this actually takes place now this is our setting then take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jose deck the high priest and speak unto him now notice what he's going to tell Joshua thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the Lord now what would you would have said if you'd have been living in that day and you would have heard this prophecy you said okay now that's a Vindicated prophet of God he can only speak when he says thus saith the Lord he can only speak at the divine inspiration so Joshua dies he lives his life and he dies and people's thinking oh my goodness this Vindicated Prophet how could he not be anointed of God how could this be but you're just there as a Believer you're just holding on to the word and you're thinking I don't understand exactly how it could be but that man was a Vindicated prophet now what he said was exactly right but it was veiled veiled away from those that were not quickened to life now look in verse 13. even he shall build the Temple of the Lord the temple of the Lord now this is in the time when the house of God is being rebuilt and yet the prophet is speaking of the future building imagine the people saying the poor guy I mean he you know he's he's been alone out there by himself he's just lost it that's all he can say we're we're rejoicing because we got a new house to worship God and here this man is talking about some other time he was talking about some other time and he shall bear the glory and he shall sit and Rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne now according to the law this cannot happen God never you hear me never ordain one man of the levitical order to be both priest and King so now if we would check him by the word where would we find in his scriptures to prove this could happen well I got you all listening anyway now we're looking back at it of course from This Way backwards and to us I said well sure that makes perfect sense he was talking about another dispensation but they didn't know that they didn't know what was going on he shall be a priest upon his throne and the Council of Peace shall be between them boast between what office of King office of priest or reconciliation shall be brought together in a Unity of peace that mean a lot to be remembered to notice we pray you want your heart open tonight to the word wedding comes just to sing right when he just come to see one another and just well you know it's Wednesday night I think we'll go to church oh I want to hear from him so bad tonight amen Heavenly Father we thank you so much we're so grateful that we have our place back where we can worship how thankful we were able to have the holiday and when we had it but Lord how grateful we are to have our place back where we can meet with you and we can meet with each other father there's just something about having your own place father God we're looking for you to speak to us and looking for you to anoint us it wouldn't do much good Lord if you just anoint me I would be blessed and I would receive and I would be able to speak your anointed word but what good would that do if you don't anoint them and give them the ability to hear not only with their ears on the side of their head but to be able to hear with their heart so we pray tonight that you would come anoint the speaker anoint the hearers anoint your word that it might be made and manifest in each of Our Lives for it's in the name of the house of God in the name of the house of God the Lord Jesus that we ask it and the Saints said amen you may be seated you see you put your name on the door or the doorpost or the lentil so when people come up a stranger and they're looking for your house they can be able to see it on the mailbox on the outside or see it on the door see it somewhere that identifies who lives inside of that house well the house of God started out being very vague it was obscure it wasn't really plain for them to understand where does God dwell Moses had seen him in different forms and he had developed this curious desire to see him and he asked the Lord if he could see his face and he said no man can see my face and live but I will set you in a place and I will put my hand over this place and when I pass by I'll let you see a part of me so Moses gets into the cleft of The Rock and God in the form of Christ which was a theophany that this is pre-human existence then Christ moves back his hand and as he walks past Moses said it looked like the back part of a man so that didn't satisfy Moses he only wanted to see more well God decided he wanted to live among them so instead of one man seeing him and him telling others God said I will improvise and I'll make a way where that I will come down in a house attempt a temporary dwelling because I want to dwell with you all I want to hear you laugh I want to hear you talk about your problems and your issues and your troubles I want to hear you talk about the weather I want to hear you talk about the things that concern you I want to I want to dwell among you so he gives Moses the pattern by which he lays it out now Moses doesn't just pick his own desire and say you know what I've always thought to rectangular type of structure myself or maybe maybe Moses preferred a circle or maybe Moses locked a hexagon Moses from the land of Egypt maybe he wanted a pyramid but you know God never even asked Moses what his particular taste was God never asked him even what material that he preferred now no doubt Moses being from the lineage natural speaking and raised up among the Pharaohs they wanted something of a more permanent residence so they use Stone I've stood there several several years ago still able to see the Sphinx which was carved thousands of years ago the Pyramids of Giza the step pyramids seeing many of the Great statues of the Pharaohs that were carved thousands of years ago and still so perfectly that you could see the Contour of where their eyes were and see the wrinkles in the the knuckles on their hands carved out a solid Stone so maybe Moses would have had a idea now God I think really that stone ought to be what we built this out of you know Stone would be all right if you're going to leave this place of worship in one place but since you're going to be a traveling people you definitely don't want to Rock Church do you so God told them what to build it out of now how many beliefs God knows what he ought to build his church out of now I want you to think with me tonight that the institutions that God chose in the beginning and those that God ordained but of course before the foundation of the world are the ones that Satan hates so much now since God never ordained organization since God never ordained lots of the things that man does God never ordained a banking system God never ordained many of the things that men do much of what our society is made out of and much of what our desire our society depends upon but isn't it amazing that Satan doesn't fight that near as much as he does the original ones that are thousands of years old wonder why Satan hates marriage so much wonder why he hates the family so much wonder why he hates the church so much because it's God's original institutions so Satan if he cannot destroy it he will try to mock it so what does he do he mocks marriage now he knows he'll never annihilate marriage so what's he do he mocks marriage so he has a man to marry a man a woman to marry a woman a man to marry a pizza a man to marry a dog a woman to marry a cat well you know what some of the dumb people I've met that could be a perfect mate for him I don't know you know they might ought to marry a donkey that's about the I accuse him of them of God so why does Satan do that because he hates God's institution now God of course chose marriage first before the prevalence of family notice the order so God could have made a father and a daughter God could have made a father and a son and placed them in the garden of Ed just created both of them in that image God could have created a mother and a daughter a mother and a son but what did God do but Divine protocol God put the order and divine order was what a man and his wife no children yet so this was the divine order that God chose then what did God do God's plan was to further expand that family that man and woman through the mixing together of their genes and their DNA then there would be a family on the earth so what did Satan do Satan come to the very first Union him that God had on the earth which was marriage now it wasn't like Adam had a whole bunch of choices there was only one man and one woman so Satan attacked the very first design of God that he placed upon the Earth in that he pulled the woman out of her position but first he had to pull an instrument out of its position that instrument was a very curious instrument it was an animal which was the closest one to the human being now we know that man is a warm-blooded animal which makes him a mammal but yet here was the the one that was closest to the man now he had a a place for a soul but he didn't have a soul but he had blood that was so close to the human being he could think he could reason he could talk he had an ability about him that he was not like a donkey or like a horse or a cat or cow but he was something so similar and God made him of course that way as the missing way so Satan's Next Step was to get to what God's next unfolding stage was the family God was not satisfied with just the man and his wife so God was going to unfold it further into a family so Satan thought he beat God to the program so what does he do he goes to the woman through which God was going to bring forth she was the channel by which God was going to expand this creation on the earth and use her as to propagate the family so Satan beat Adam to this woman then Satan becomes as we know the father of Cain is this right according to the Bible he was of the wicked one the Bible never cause Cain the son of Adam and the church said he was of the wicked one which in case you don't know it was not Adam so what did Satan want to do he wanted to interrupt God's program so every institution then that God chose Satan hates it and despises it he knows he can never stop the real Church of the Living God he knew you know whenever he was there for the first few years in the book of Acts it's like he was learning because God was bringing forth something totally new he could see the type in the Old Testament he could see God choosing Israel and saw that God had was was going to do something special with a group of people and and a type of that they were a church for sure but coming on the day of Pentecost God started something that was relatively new and that God had come down and unveiled himself in human beings and then Jesus had begun to give little excerpts of the identity of this new move when Jesus was the first one one to say in Matthew Upon This Rock I will build my Church okay so Satan hears this for the first time now the New Testament is where he begins to hear this reiterated over and over again so Satan you'll imagine he don't even know what a church is because he's never exactly seen one there was no New Testament Church so he hears Jesus say church he hears Jesus say it again he hears the disciples as they begin to discuss it so he doesn't yet really know what it is so he sees the Lord Jesus as he ascends up into heaven and he sees the disciples as they're trying to figure out what do we do where do we go we don't know what to do so he sees them as they go to the upper room and they begin to tear they begin to wait he's not even sure how long they don't know how long they're praying they're waiting they begin to discuss maybe we've got it maybe we've already got it we just don't know it yet but then he began to hear a sound Come From Heaven and it come on a certain day a certain day that was absolutely prophetic and the Bible tells us when the day of Pentecost was fully come now remember this was named not after the Pentecostal experience it was already called Pentecost before they got the Holy Ghost so the Feast of Pentecost had been celebrated for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years before acts 2. so it was the Feast of the in gathering and it was of course seven sabbaths after the waving of the sheep that happened upon the day of atonement or Yom Kippur so here the spirit of God descends on this certain day and they begin to stagger around like drunk people and they were speaking in tongues and it was tongues that they never heard before they never knew and the miracle was not only them speaking in tongues but say I would have been there you would have been there you would have been there and there was Parsons and Greeks and all the rest of these people and they were outside and they heard us and we stagger out and we're just going on and on and speaking and speaking and we'll say brother Jim was a Greek and I I'm you know I'm Simon Peter I didn't know one word of Greek and I'm standing up I'm praising God worshiping God and what am I doing I'm speaking Greek and brother Jim Hughes hears me say my Lord that's my language well here was another guy from Syria and another from Lebanon and another one from here there there now they knew that these guys were ignorant and unlearned they knew they wasn't a theologian among them they knew they barely knew Hebrew much less any other languages can't you see why God will use sometimes people that are ignorant and unlearned I'm glad he's still using this the same kind so Satan you imagine on the day of Pentecost he didn't know what to make of it all he's trying to figure out what in the world is this now he didn't know that God had already sowed invisible predestinated seeds inside the hearts of these individuals that started out with 120 and then it starts multiplying getting greater and greater but as it starts we see a number that comes up right along side by side with these which was the original ones that received the Holy Ghost but what you find is the Bible says that there was added to the church so many but the Bible doesn't say they got the Holy Ghost now Wayne oh that there were others at the house of Cornelius and others and whenever they went there and the apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost was by the hands of the Apostles is that right so whenever they went there some of them would speak in tongues some of them would prophesy but they took note about every one of these people that they all had a life change now and then Satan as he was watching because he's trying to pick up the methodology of God he don't understand it we imagine he heard them guys speak in tongues and they were shagging around like drunk men well we go to the house of Cornelius and we see them and their experience was a little bit different and no doubt the devil's taught what in the world is going on well whenever we come to Acts chapter 10 and we come to some of the other examples in the word you don't see to where it was exactly the same every time that they spoke in Greek or Aramaic or Hebrew or Syrian or whatever it was but it was a little bit different I wish somebody would hear me tonight now you know that's what really bothers me sometimes is that people want everybody to act just like them or they think their church is the model Church in the message and everybody ought to act like their Church well I don't even want you to act like me much less some other Church to be honest with you friends every church has its personality and the people who come to that church is what makes up the personality of that church just like your family so when it was you and your husband then you was a certain personality in your home that was the congenial mixing together of you and him he come from a certain normal in his family you come from a certain normal in your family then what did you all do you came together in one household one apartment one trailer whatever it was and you started creating a new normal for you well your mom and dad started noticing those things you all done the way you eat supper what time you ate supper everything they noticed it wasn't the way they raised you well no because you've got another person over there that also has another normal too so then you all start creating your new normal now that new normal will exist until a little one comes along then when that little one comes along he turns your normal or she upside down how many of your parents can say Amen to that then whenever another one comes along then that one kind of changes your Norm well it's the same way with churches well somebody will move here from there and somebody will get saved and they've got their background under this and that and the other you know and a lot of times people think the way they are they attribute it to how spiritual they are but if you would have seen them on this out there in the world you would see a lot of the very same things you see about them now they used to do that same thing for the devil now some of y'all used to ride them old hog motorcycles and you wore them leather jackets man you're a higher blue in the wind so when you come to church you know they don't have a leather jacket or a Harley-Davidson but you're one of the wildest people in church and yet some of you totally attribute all of that to the Holy Ghost you need not to take a little walk down memory lane and think back to where you were back then now you see the problem is when we want to take ourselves as the example and judge everybody else by us well I I'm the only spiritual one and Word of Life everybody else is dead compared to who I said compared to who well praise the lord well then other people over there is Pentecostal compared to who you see whenever we go to using ourself as the example instead of using God's word as the example that's what we do we create our own little organization and that everybody that acts like us belongs in our little organization well I didn't know I was going to go this way tonight but apparently the Lord knew that we needed it amen now you see the thing that God wanted was to be able to have a place among his people so God begins to give Moses all the design of the Tabernacle and he begins to declare the particulars of what size he wants it to be he wants it to be three-dimensional outer Court inner quote and the holiest of holies but he doesn't tell him just to bring whatever they want to whatever type of wood whatever type of material but God designates certain material God designates certain colors now God did not want them to pick whatever color they like now maybe somebody there didn't like blue God didn't ask their opinion if they like blue or not God designated blue and God designated scarlet and God designated of the metallurgical family what that is is different types of metals so God said I want you to use silver for the sockets now the sockets were set so when the posts come up on on the side and that have a little thing on the top and there was a socket so the socket was the place by which the ball on the Mast standing up on the side would fit into it so you watch then what Redemption does Redemption is the recipient to be able to join the two together they were not made of gold but they were made of silver they were not made of brass they were made of silver so then silver speaks of redemption but then the altar was not to be made out of silver and the holy of holies the cherubims were not to be made out of brass but they were to be made out of gold so what if Moses said you know you know what God I really think you could use a little bit of help with interior design work now it just so happens that we've got a few ladies that used to decorate the palace down in Egypt and they decorate they come from egyptology I mean they are some of the best in all the land of Egypt so I have appointed them to help us decorate the Tabernacle of God now they honestly think that instead of using blue it would be more pleasant if he went with some more neutral color because in their view God this blue is only a Time color it will go out in time God never asked for their opinion now you're what I find amazing is a lot of people would say Amen to the statements that I just made but yet when it comes to the Church of the Living God in the New Testament they want to assume that they have the right to tell God in the New Testament what to make his church out of in the New Testament well you know what I ain't too smart but I figure if God didn't want their opinion in the old he don't want ours in the new so God don't want membership God don't want denomination God don't want shaken the preacher's hand put your name on the church book what does God want Holy Ghost fill people Born Again experience now notice then so the mother and the father don't have an experience with God and then it's handed down by heredity to their children so your daddy's got the Holy Ghost your mama's got the Holy Ghost and you come in automatically because Mom and Daddy said no the way it's designed by God the master builder is that every person in the body must be born again well why is that necessary it's because the material that he is gathering comes from a converted Soul you see it's not coming from an intellectual conception of the Gospel well I come up to the Altar and I had the minister to pray for me and I give my life to Christ now that means so many things to so many different people and that is a story but that is not what God is looking for for the material God does not just want confessions now when a person comes I confess I am a sinner I am lost without God Lord Jesus say me that is a confession stone that is a storm but what is that a lot of people all they amount to and they gather them together in churches by the hundreds of heaps so it's one that saved here one saved there one saved there but the prophet likened that to stones and their power and a big pile but they don't want to be shaped by a stonemason so a stone Mason now for those of you that's got a good eye you'll be able to look at these pillars right here and this one up here behind me and you'll be able to see that all of these Stones didn't just fall into place like that so whenever you go to land I'm according to your style you will lay a certain pattern you're going to land out you're going to create holes you're going to create holes and you know it might be that four inch square one there might be that five inch one on the bottom but you're going to lay it out through there and you've got to keep an eye on it make sure it don't go do this that on you because it'll get crooked and then you're going to leave some holes somewhere and you can look and look and look all you want to but you ain't going to find no Rock that's going to fit every one of them holds so you know what you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to cut that raw now you're going to take a diamond side cutter or you can get a wet saw which mother David hair let us use and you run that saw now that stone through that saw and you can put it up if you wish with that straight edge that you just cut but if you'll notice these Stones they are made to where they have accents and dips and adjacent points that stick out on the side and a trained eye will go right to that stone and say that stone is cut so when brother Dave and I were laying these Stones whenever we weren't doing it the horrible God of course we had to get up and have brothers to do it for us so they would cut the stone and we would call down I need a four inch or three and a half inches long I need a five inch or seven inches long well maybe they come in nine inches or ten inches or 12 inches well we ain't got one well cut me one well they cut it they run it through the saw and then they take a little chisel and then they go to chipping on the end of that so when you look at it most of you won't be able to know which one was cut and it'll look like a positive say how did they get that all together Blood Sweat and Tears had a wet saw now to make it look that way so it it looks does it not look beautiful yeah it looks really nice well you think wow man Dave about David how did they do that that looks like it all just fit well it looks that way but that wasn't quite the way it happened and it's the same way with the body of God which is the habitation of the Holy Ghost now people look and say oh my look at them Believers praise the lord lord they are good strong people they love the Lord they trust him oh you ought to seen this when he found us you ought to see this when he first got a hold of us you ought to seen us a year actually got saved or maybe five years after we got saved you ought to seen us 20 years people look at a preacher and say wow my goodness look how God's blessed them look at this and that and the other yeah you ought to been with me and my wife y'all have been with us years ago when was traveling around in a tent and staying in a pup tent in the rain in the storms didn't have enough money to buy food so we waited on people who visited the tent meetings to bring us food and if they didn't bring us much we didn't have much did we Harry I preached in places before and you didn't have the money for a hotel and if people didn't put you up well you sweating your vehicle you just done what you had to do and people look oh my my look at them now look at them now take a trip with me down the road though and then people look at you and they get jealous of what you are now and they don't want to look back at all the years of the chipping and the and the saw and same way with you not just a preacher now but the same way of you as a child of God those of you that are talented to sing or play music or whatever it is and God's called you and placed you in the body people say oh I'd love to sing like that I love to be able to play the piano like brother laying out but you love to be able to be here on all the hours that he comes and practices with the people would you love to be here with all the brothers that do the sound equipment and the lights and this and that and the other people saw I'd love to be this and that a lot of times what we want is the glory we don't want the chipping part oh praise the Lord now if you would have been in here and some of you were because I saw you as you visited and I had a machine over here and brother Dave had one over here and there's rocks laid around us everywhere and you would have seen bits and pieces of rock and shattered pieces and when you go to chipping it all it's it's without doubt some of it you're absolutely going to break them and hey and when you do and yet you look at it say wow what a finish work oh everything just come together wow did they have something to go by not really no some of it just come together as it did but you see God had something to go by and it was a master plan so it started unfolding that plan in the Old Testament in the book of Exodus in order to start making a house a tabernacle a tent I want you to notice what God called that tent he called it a tent of the congregation wait a minute I thought God is going to live in there why would God call it a 10 event of the congregation or a tabernacle of the congregation I thought it was supposed to be the Tabernacle of the Lord why would God name it after his people now remember it never was given a human name in order to personify to make it a living thing they they leaned too much toward idolatry anyway and the Shekinah Glory of God came down into this place and there they knew God was there and he was there for it many many years but God of course this was not ultimately where he wanted to go notice with me in Isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit all my to revive the spirit of the humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones so God God wanted to even in this shadow in the book of Isaiah God wanted to let them know now they probably tried to read this and think what is God meaning what is God actually getting that notice he says that I dwell in the high and lofty place with him that is of a contrite and humble Spirit God dwells in the high and lofty place with him that is of a humble and contrite spirit to revive the heart of the contrite once so as the Tabernacle was made of different material of Timber some of shittim wood some of gold some of silver some of purple some of blue different colors reflecting different things the blue of the Heavenly of course the Royal being that of divinity and the kingly representation and so when we come to the New Testament then that the Lord Jesus also purposed to make a body now it's not this this is not the place where when we walk out of here that God dwells in here if you come in here and you're here you can hear him tall and you can hear God say things oh sure come in here and pray if you wish to but yet this is not the house that has made God house in the book of Acts chapter 7 it says the most high does not dwell in buildings which are made by hands the reason he's here tonight is because you were here so do we consecrate this place yes should we respect it absolutely but I want you to notice in Saint John 14 23 Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me almost up to the topic guys sorry I skipped on you a little he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him now listen to the words of the Lord Jesus when we're talking about we and us we're not talking about two Gods but we're talking about Father and Son in other words word and spirit father and son is not an old man and a young man but father is Spirit light and sun is spoken word so father God wants to indwell our bodies with both him and the sonship which his father Spirit word son he that does this has both Father and Son theologians lean more toward the logos this is why they preach mainly Christ Christ Christ Christ New Testament cross cross cross cross why they haven't gone any farther than where they're preaching just keep that in mind when you're listening to a man listen to where he preaches and see if he can lead you to a Rapture if he preaches only about the cross you better be hung you another preacher we got to hear Rapture stuff friends not just the cross now notice he that will abide in me notice the Lord Jesus as he says this if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him I may believe she has the spirit of God in you tonight any of y'all got the human body of the Lord Jesus in you anybody so what do you have Jesus is speaking and saying if any man will keep my words me and my father will come into him so is it two gods one of them that sits on the big throne and the other one a little God sits on the other Throne you believe in arianism he was a theologian in the first century that started coming up with this idea of messing with the godhead preaching that Jesus was less than God if for around the nazia council uh-huh but he became God now no he was God and became man and somebody said amen my Lord Jesus did not become God he was God but he become man that he might take my sins upon him so notice that he said we will make our Abode with him so we're looking at you agree with me that we is more than one we is more than one so is it two beings is it two Gods is it two separate entities one is older than the other one or is it not what Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and life is it not what Jesus said in Saint John 4 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth in other words father and son so he that comes this way receives both father spirit and Son which is worth theologians will only come toward the logos which is the son the fanatical emotional type only one the spirit but we want both I want both Father and Son now I hope you understand what I'm saying I have both Father and Son living in me tonight you say what are you talking about I've got the Father which is the spirit I have the son which is the word which is quickened by the power of the father so all glory to God both Father and Son spirit and quick and word is what will take the Rapture now this is what he is looking for to build his house out of in this day he started it in the book of Acts out of the material that he wanted so they did not take cold dead theologians he did not take people that just run and shout and jumped all the time and didn't want no teaching of the word but we realized from the book of Acts 2 they jumped they shouted they hollered they spoke in tongues but they also knew about the doctrines of the word of God I find this so amazing that Peter started out to be an ignorant and an unlearned man the prophet of God tells us he couldn't even sign his name but when you get time I'd like for you to read the Epistle of Peter and when you do you are truly going to read a miracle because you're going to read and you're going to say where did this man get this understanding where did this man learn how to write where did this man get the ability to use some of these words every time you hear Brother Joel Farney preach you say another miracle because only first God saved he couldn't read either he couldn't even read the Bible and how did he learn to read by preaching God's word so what'd he get both father and son I don't want just the son the dead cold letter I don't want your spirit I want Father and Son Spirit now down to him which is invisible Immortal the only wise God the Dominion power and Glory forever remember father God is not a man when will we ever grasp this God is not a man he is not a human being God is a spirit oh what a Unity that Jesus Promised in this notice so both Father and Son again in Saint John 17 23 I and them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou Hast sent me so how is the world going to know that God the spirit sent Jesus The Living Word when we become in perfect Oneness you see it's not just handing out tracks it's not just saying well I I believe every word of the Bible I believe every bit of it no that's not the way they will know how many of them still don't know to this very night it's when the Oneness of God Is So made manifest and Perfection well then if you were the devil and you heard this what would you try to do what would you try to do you would try to stop that church which you're not from being that perfect Oneness and then if you saw a body if you saw a family if you saw a group that was heading toward that Oneness what would you do you would do everything in your power to try to divide them that's what he does to families they don't just get a church in mind but that's what he does to families Satan can't stand it when husbands love their wives and wives loves their husbands and children love their parents and they have a unit and they come to the house of God and they worship and they love and they serve the Lord you watch The Devil he will set his sights on them he will attack them like no other family in the same community if all hell will break loose it'll attack that family like nobody else why he hates God's original choice and when he sees the family whether you're rich whether you're poor whether you've got land or ain't got no land if you've read every day of your life for 75 years of your life you can have this Oneness with God which makes you more wealthy than the greatest man on the Earth praise be to God notice this in verse 26 and I had declared unto them thy name and will declare it so what name did Jesus say so did Jesus go around and saying I declare the name of Adonai I declare the name of that or him El Shaddai Jehovah Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissi Jesus never quoted any of those but yet according to him we believe what he said right I have declared thy name but remember name to the Hebrews meant more than saying Donnie or Joe or Fred the word name comes from the Hebrew word in the Old Testament and it means your reputation or your character so Jesus declared the reputation of God the character of God amen and he bore the human Redemptive name of God which was Yeshua or Jesus notice I have declared unto them thy name and will declare that the love we're with thou Hast loved me may be in them you mean the Lord Jesus wants the father God to love us in the way he loved the sonship that love may be in them and I in them now watch Ephesians chapter 2 verse 22 and whom ye also are building together for a habitation of God through the father the spirit whom you are built so what is the mechanics then what is the building material what's the material what's the material in this carpet Walnut the fur all different types of wood carpet metal in the chairs foam on the padding all types of different material steel aluminum concrete paint all over this whole building it's all types of different materials would it be good to put the steel here would it be good for me to try to stand up and preach on a steel beam now I can remember when I was a young fella many years ago the anointing hit me one night brother hell and the Holiness Church I went to and I took off running they had pews I walked the backs of them don't try this at home now like a streak alive jump off the back and jumped up and run back dare say it better be the Lord now if I do it and God takes material and he gives some one way and some another way and sometimes things that we think are so contrasting but yet I'm really glad those beams up there are made of steel instead of marshmallows wouldn't that be scary are you all glad with me I'm glad that's some real strong being boys some of them great or big things great big ones right there and you think they're pretty Decor you think that's just there for pretty that's there to hide them great big steel beams that's holding this thing up I'm glad we've got an architecture that that architect God that went through all of it in the stress load check this and check that and he'll have to sign off on this thing when we finally get our final uh completion of it all and say that yet everyone was tested every Speck of concrete that we poured we had to have the city's approval so they come out and take so much of the concrete and take it back to the laboratory and test to make sure that it meets the right kind of pressure well that's kind of the way God is doing his bride God takes his bride back to the laboratory the word God sometimes really cranks down on the pressure I've got a receipt for every check that I wrote plus the ones brother John babbro whenever he was taken care of all of that and I made I don't know how many out to this company so they could test every load of concrete I'm thinking they're ripping us off I don't like paying them much money so I asked that God one day why am I having a pass he said because I don't want you to get bad concrete he said because if you'd seen some of the concrete that I've seen poured in buildings and in floors and for Footers you'd be glad I said I'm so glad I'm writing these checks for this concrete I don't like trials no more than you do I don't like trying times I don't like tests that you go through there are sometimes you don't know if you're going to make it or not come on somebody preach with me but oh brother I want my life to be so God can put a sticker as it were on my life and say he passed the test amen he passed the test I want to tell you friends the floor you're setting on past the test the mezzanine passed the test the foundation passed the test the sidewalk past the test well that's real good for the building but I want to pass the test to but I've tried when I'm testing when I go through things I don't understand I want God to be able to put that stick around and say Donnie you passed daddy you passed oh I love this one Paul must have been astounding to the Believers of that day now you imagine by now the book of Ephesians is written around 58. 58 to 60 A.D so the church is not even 30 years old yet so they're they're hearing these things and Satan Harry is still learning now but now he's already got himself a church too so God wanted a church if he can't stop the church what he's got to do is name him one except just keep them from getting the Holy Ghost well as a matter of fact the prophet said they started on the day of Pentecost the Catholic Church said well every time I say that people look at me like I don't know what start on the day Pentecost yeah not the ones in the upper room the others that didn't get the Holy Ghost so God wanted to make a habitation for the spirit of God and it would be a building that would grow all over the world all over the world it's unbelievable some of the Nations that I've been to in the world they don't have electricity they don't have toilets in their house some of them don't have running water but they have books tapes Bibles healing in the sick casting out devils even lepers getting healed and it ain't just the preachers a lot of them don't do like some of the lazy Americans to think well we pay the preacher to do our praying for us we pay the preacher to heal the same we pay the preacher to do all that and all they do is come in and Nod every now and then I met the little sister in India who run out of flower I met the little sister who run out of oil and didn't have nothing to eat and the Lord God come in her house as he did the Widow of Zara pass and flourish this little sister's Cruise of oil and her flower meal until the Lord God sent rain in her province in India you see I believe he can do the same thing right here in America if we ever get to that spot oh brother Donny but we've got the welfare we've got food stamps and we've got I'm nothing against any of that at all but what if we run out of that one day our nation is busted we are bankrupt oh my remember faith is like muscles and if you don't use the muscles in your body and they will start getting so soft and you get to where you can't lift nothing you can't do nothing is that right you all know that you've dealt with people in your family or friends and they become bedridden and they get to where they can't hardly walk they can hardly lift nothing why because her muscles and their body are losing that ability to live and then the doctors will tell them well we've got to put you in therapy we've got to give you therapy what do they do well they go to lift and they go to moving around that's the way faith is sometimes our Faith's muscle we just turn into a Big Blob of fat oh my goodness we just turned into a blob of fat I don't want Faith fat I want Faith muscles Hallelujah I don't want to look like a polar bear where I'm just a girl around with fat all over me but I want my muscles whenever they tense up that the devil says watch out boys that dude is bad I'm telling you that dude has been lifting them barbells watching Hebrews 13 8 Saint John 15 7 Psalms 37 1-4 Psalms 103 verse 3. oh yeah it ain't easy and it makes us really difficult and really tired when we're going through it but brother sister whenever we need God in a hurry I don't want somebody praying for me that's got to go through Mary and Joseph and Saint Cecilia and somebody else I want somebody that can talk directly to the man himself and I want to know they've done it before and I want to see some muscles on their arms [Applause] so just imagine you're in a hard spot an automobile has fell on you and I walk up and I'll go come on you just say dear God let me die that puny thing but I don't know about you when I need help I want somebody that's got some Faith muscles they don't brag on their self and they ain't nothing good within themselves but they've been there a few times but it's odd they'll stand with you brother Jonathan whenever it's on sometimes it's going rough that's the kind of people I want all those folks y'all sure if you're standing there and you're showing up a parade there's all kinds of folks that can polish their medals and they polish their boots and they stand up to a man they glisten like Ajax himself they come up there they're Mr Clean they know how to do that yeah yeah yeah they know how to walk they know how to hold their face they know how to be Mr cool I don't want somebody like that my goodness if I'm in a if I'm in a street fight I want a man that you hear him go and you look around man he may have one eye and he may have a Big Slice across his nose and he may kind of walk sideways like that but she watched that old boy fight he can drop 10 Philistines faster than you say Jack Robinson that's the guy I want on my side right there I don't want that old boy sitting there so let me show you how voila we're not beating the drums we're fighting devils come on children we're not on a dress parade we've not come in this place to show people how big we are how pretty our place is we've got folks dying we got folks sick our nation is lost we've got loved ones that need to be filled with the Holy Ghost we've got children that need to be brought back to god let's use our face muscles we're not going to a parade we'll parade after a while right now it's war time right now it's war time [Applause] oh notice Ephesians 4 15. but speaking the truth and love May grow up grow up into him now not grow up to him but grow up into him glory to God you imagine if Satan read this he thought what in the world What could that preacher mean they're going to grow into him how is that possible I can hear them down in the hill as they called a demonic conference and he began to tell him look guys we've got our work cut out for us I thought when Jesus left we had this thing well you know how they were Peter James and John well I'll be jealous of one another wonder who had the most people streaming their services wondering who had the biggest Search Wonder this and that and the other that was going on you realize on the early days of Pentecost man those men started out really anointed they started out really anointed and you know what some of them guys will do whenever Jack Coe would get a certain size tent then some of the guys from work from some of the other big name preachers would go in the night and measure Jack Coast Tent and then order one bigger so they could say they had the biggest gospel tent in the world and then whenever they would get it it didn't last long because somebody else from or Roberts University they'd come over and measure them then they wanted the biggest gospel town in the world oh my that was what it turned into then it turned into colleges and who was the biggest and who was the greatest I look at what they produce now come on children oh I'm so glad God sent us a man that did not have an agenda I'm glad God sent us a Prophet by the day that did not want to compete with man he was not worried about him no as a matter of fact somebody stole his little gospel tent right off from under him and he let him get away with it that's a real man that's got character that don't take all of his sermons and stand up there and defend himself preach the word preach the word and God will fight for you live the word Saints and God will fight for you believe the word and God will fight your cancer for you how will he do it in your body he will fight it but speaking the truth and love May grow up into him grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together fitly joined together Paul hears using Carpenter's terms in the Greek so you look at this handrail here tonight cut by real fancy machine one of the brothers at the church has but we could have pile that Lumber up there this beautiful Walnut Lumber and said machine go after it but that machine couldn't but there had to be the mind of a man that programmed that machine to make these cuts these here and these here exactly the same they had to be the mind of a man same man that programmed that machine to make fish cuts now I could have made them but I'd use the jigsaw and I'd have been sanding for the rest of my life trying to get all the cuts out of it so God had it in his mind well I like this design I like this you know this radius to it and then I thought well if it got that I don't think that a square Pulpit would look right I've been pretty Square all my life you know never fit here and never fit that so I thought why not get a Pulpit that will sort of match that hey man so God thought I wanted people that'll match me I want a house I want a place to worship that'll match my house so what did God do God made him a human house on the earth and he called that human house his son amen and he called his son the logos the way and gave him the human name of redemption Jesus Christ and God said this is my first son but this ain't my last one oh Glory this is my first one but I'm going to make another at another and another and another and I'm here to tell you tonight he's still making them he's still making them he's working on me he's working on you and we're growing up into him the more we grow we grow into His Image until finally we disappear in His image completely gone [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] let me find a place to close notice this verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together now the brother who cut all this and cut all this oh I like them seems I like that tight tight several years ago this brother made a Pulpit in a certain church I was preaching it was a temporary Pulpit that was only going to last for a while but I was preaching about eternity where brother Bram said the sixteenth of an inch once they break into that 150 million years of life space sixteenth of an inch he said it's about like you know just a sixteenth of an inch in eternity so I looked down that pulpit and there's some pretty good sized little cracks in there and had some filler in it and I said whoever it was built this that's about 150 million years of life space right there nobody look around oh whenever he started making this stuff I'd come in and they said what are you doing there what are you doing he didn't want me to call his name why it's it's Joy so don't you see what Satan wants to do he wants us to have a big old gap between us he wants us in our Theology and our love for one another and our forgiveness for one another oh my we got our gaps are so big we have to buy government issue caulk yeah we got about a big old caulking my goodness we may have to get that spray foam stuff that expandable kind because we're so far apart in love and we're so part of going don't get quiet on me in hell but the body of God has not made that way [Applause] if a man can make a structure like this where it's so tight you can't even hardly tell we're two separate pieces joined together right right but I was adjoined by biscuits you don't know what biscuits are not the kind you eat no no no not jelly it's a piece of wood you take a biscuit cutter and it cuts indentions in this wood and you slide that biscuit and get it wet with glue and you put it inside both parts and then you clap that's where the Lord does US sometimes he'll clamp us right next to somebody in the church we don't like and you think they have ruined my favorite seat all right now this couldn't be for the internet streamers because all of them don't go to church so it must be for somebody here tonight [Music] For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted knit together to cause to coalesce let me all know what finger joints are and lumber and drawers and stuff like that just cut so fine yeah colonize together according to the effects you're working in the measure of every part so every part some little teen any parts and some bigger parts some fat parts some bikini part but in the body God hasn't put together like a car now what gets all the glory all the visual stuff the hands y'all want to know what time it is time around look the hands and the numbers but where's the power come from I don't care what name you put on them anymore most of them is battery operated from China anyway so you can call them whatever you want to many of us want the glory well I've got to be visible I've got to be out here I want that is there anybody willing to go behind the scene of the clock to go on the back part of the clock be the one who I will Lord Jesus use me you need somebody that'll be in in the low light I'd much rather be there than where I am I would that God had never called me to preach I want to go I could have been an ordinary person I went to God no one a name I would to God know Africans no Indians no one ever even heard the name Donnie Reagan me humanly I wish you'd left me alone just leave me in Kentucky alone I don't want to come here in the first place I told him so he wore me out I regretted it people who want some great big something you just keep in mind those who want it more than likely ain't called to have it it's the god that's running from it brother Dan Davis they told me years ago he said if you ever hear that brother Henry green passed away and I said where's brother Dan they said he left two days ago because he did not want that position and he was the one who got it why that's the way God's man is most of us if I'm so I wish I didn't have to go through this I wish I didn't have to go there most of the parts feel that way but look at what they turn into this well it's nice yeah it's nice but one of these days this will be turned into a nuclear Heap there'll be nothing left all of our labor all of our sweating all that we've done I'm so glad our hope is not this if this is our hope friends we're lost but I'm so glad what we're building tonight ain't this but it's this right here thank you from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint Supply us do you notice the way now that Paul now he's using about construction terms but also the body so every joint supplies according to the effects you're working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so the word compact it is to call us to coalesce join together to cause a person to unite was one in a conclusion or come to the same opinion wow so we come together in a conclusion now will all the bright people ever believe exactly the same things no they will not not before the Rapture anyway we will have our differences we will have our little ideas of this and that but that's not what we're coalesing on we're collacing on the essential parts for the rapture what is needful to get us out of this place I've been in churches all over this world Latin America Africa India Europe I have never never seen two of them that were exactly alike now you'll see similarities in the Latin America similarities in Venezuelan churches similarities in the Mexico churches similarities in the southwest churches similarities in the north similarities in Africa but if you're around them long enough you realize the personality of that church is unique to that church itself God loves variety have you been watching Venus in Jupiter no you didn't know that meant out okay well let me update you a little bit it only happens every so many hundred years so it started with the quarter moon then Venus and Jupiter Allied like this I saw them all ago I was at walking praying before I come in and they're just like this right above each other God made them that way they only get in that past ever so many hundred years certain constellations have passed by and the way you see it I said well not long ago and it hadn't been that way since 5 700 years ago so it was right after Adam and yet they go through this big pattern out there and they find their spot and every now and then they get to this certain place to where you can look up and say oh my goodness I mean Carol was out here a month and a half ago two months ago after Dark I stopped up here to take a picture of our church three crosses lights on top sent to Carol she pulled it up there was two blue lights hanging right over it one of those Comet things that it passed right over the top of where the cross was huh I like those things now you think they've been doing that for who knows how long but it just so happened we just got this lined up that's the way we are you see this thing has been going on for so long and God's waiting and waiting on us to get lined up and it ain't how great we are ready to end how big we are it's actually who we fellowship with yeah so you see that's what happened with Venus and Jupiter it's been going on the last little bit is Venus and Jupiter has caught the moon here in this Crescent this quarter Crescent so as it's done now they're identified right there in our star same with us we battled this we battle that and it may be that God will put you in alignment and you're there for just a short span I'll live if the Lord tears in a few years I'll be gone another preacher will step here and take over if the Rapture don't come I'll live my life in a few years after I'm gone folks I never remember me no more I'll never remember hardly nothing I'd done I'll just be you know an old coat and I turn the ground the church Will Go On but I've lived my life and I've declared myself according to the Creator who put me in the heavens isn't that what you want to do can you imagine just being a meteorite just floating around falling stars people call it you never accomplish anything you never leave a mark behind you you never influence people in the right way wouldn't it be awful for your life to be known as a tale Bearer or a troublemaker or one who you know just afflicts the body of God how many have you noticed in the Old Testament of the Kings and the Nations their identity is only on the negative side the only reason they even found their place in the Bible was because they stood against the people of Israel what a reason to exist God don't never let me be there God don't never let me be be a burden to some man of God cause some servant of God to spend night after night awake tormented God help me take me off the Earth Lord before I do such a thing how many wants your place in the body correlates together to be compacted with our heads bowed I wonder each of us from the front to the back and the mezzanine those of you that are streaming tonight we said brother Donnie I've never spoken tongues in my life and you know what you may never well I I've never shouted like others do I wish I could I believe in it but I've never done it yeah you may never know I don't know but the important thing is if you do what God wants you to do you have completed your journey and when you do you'll hear those most wonderful words well done by good and faithful servant oh that'll be worth it all how many that's what you want you don't want to be like your sister don't want to be like your brother well I wish I could be like that person maybe you've got your goals sent on the wrong person maybe what you need to do is realign and say Lord what do you want me to be what do you want Heavenly Father we know our life takes all types of twists and turns Lord whenever we built the church down in Kentucky and the fall of 1982 and finished step in the spring of 83. then Lord whenever we started having services and but then Harry and Carol was already listened to the message trying to tell their old hard-headed brother and husband Lord little did we know little did we see and understand what you had laid in front of us Lord we thought by then we was probably some of the last ones you had taken your Prophet 1965 so we thought oh there could be no no time already left but Lord I'm glad I was born under that urgency if I would have known that would still been here in 2023 I'm out of come in a lot slower because you know me I don't like change Donnie don't like chains especially big change I'm so glad you put a fire under me Lord so here we are tonight Whoever thought that we would be alive in this earth March the 1st 20 23. we never thought we'd ever be here tonight and yet Lord we don't know how much longer we have but we want to be faithful as long as we're here I hope we get to live to see the rapture but if we don't we want to leave something behind us that can point to those who were following may I leave Footprints Lord may I leave an impression a good one May these parents maybe these grandparents may we leave an impression on our children our grandchildren that they can be inspired by the life we live the determination we have by our face muscles in Christ Jesus take each man woman boy and girl father may you just mold each of us that we can be compactly joined together fitly joined Lord we don't want no caulk put between us as it were we've all been around construction enough to know the painters can have a pretty tough job depending on the Carpenters and how well they cut them cuts the painter have to go back and try to make it look good I don't want that in my life father I don't want a bunch of caulk in me and a bunch of filler and a bunch of expandable foam or it has to be expanded out to fill up the lacks in my life oh Jesus compact me together Lord I see this as an individual I see it as a family I see it as the body of God if we're built this same way as an individual and our families built that way that we come together in the house of God our church will be built the same way so we're compacted as individuals our experiences fitly joined together Faith virtue knowledge Temperance all these things fitly joined together then we take them individuals and they have a family and their families are raised that way then we bring together in a church and our church is that way that's the type of church that you claim is your own that you said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it now Lord if I have built this church it's puny and it'll never stand the test of time if brother Tim Pruitt brother Ron Spencer brother Mike wall senior brother Lloyd on and on and on I could go Naaman Servants of God if it's by the Lord's Church brother Donny's Church brother Tim's church if that's all it is it'll never stand the test of time but if it's your church there ain't enough powers in hell to shake it down troubles will come and the devil will try it but when it's all said and done the church still holds together shall stand upon the Rock of Ages sickness can't tear apart distress can't tear apart tribulation can't tear apart nothing will Lord because it's your church Hallelujah oh we love you tonight father We Worship You Lord God can we just raise our hands now in the presence of the king I want you to think now friends as we come to the close of this I'm not sure that all of us will ever know all the intricacy of our spiritual walk with God you say well God's coming to be a preacher but what kind of preacher well God's called me to be a pastor well he may have and that may be seasonal God's called me to be an evangelist well it may have and that may be seasonal too but the thing you want is God where you want me when you want me how you want me that's what I want Lord same with lay Fox God calls you to fit in the body some of you move up you move up you get more experience then you're given more responsibility in the body from the charge of what God wants you to be but every step you want it to be led of the spirit of God do we not and remember what you do affects others what you do affects others so we're not here tonight on our own well I want to do this and I want to do that do you understand when you make that decision your decision may be affecting me it may be affecting your mother your child your grandson your granddaughter or people that you come to church with this is why we need to pray before we do this or that or the other and the church said why because we're fitly joined together so how can I take this part of this all to rail off without splintering and busting and dividing this joint right here I saw how it was put together you're not going to get it apart easy so what if I take it apart here here's another scene here's another scene I'm not going to get it apart easy it'll Splinter it'll bust it'll Shred what you do what I do affects those that were glued to oh praise the Lord how many loves him with all your heart how many loves each other I hope this brings us to a conscious level of responsibility that you're not just responsible for you or you and your family but for those that God puts us together with amen amen oh my let's sing something together let's just worship him a little bit before we go can we still
