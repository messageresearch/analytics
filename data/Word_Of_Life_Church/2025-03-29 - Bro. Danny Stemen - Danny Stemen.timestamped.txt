[34:55] [Applause]
[35:09] [Music]
[35:12] I cannot imagine when millions of
[35:15] people will come back down to this earth
[35:18] after it's been fully
[35:20] redeemed the prophet gives us a little
[35:23] imagery of what it'll be like that those
[35:26] that have been saved by the grace of God
[35:28] and come down Through the Ages and
[35:30] overcome all the things in life that
[35:32] they
[35:33] overcome We Gather on the earth and we
[35:35] start singing songs of
[35:37] redemption and the angels will circle
[35:41] around the earth and they'll just bow
[35:45] their
[35:46] heads because they've praised him for
[35:48] millions and millions of years they've
[35:51] blessed him they've worshiped him adored
[35:54] him but they really can't sing the word
[35:58] I
[36:00] once was
[36:03] lost but
[36:06] now I'm
[36:08] found I was
[36:11] blind but
[36:13] now I
[36:16] see so when we sing it they just drop
[36:20] their
[36:22] heads maybe saying things like this
[36:25] listen at her listen at
[36:29] her how his heart must be
[36:32] thrilled he's waited for her for all
[36:35] these
[36:35] years now she's come back
[36:39] home this is why we go to church this is
[36:42] why we pray this is why we read our
[36:45] Bibles this is why we do things that are
[36:48] right not because of
[36:51] fear I've not been fearful of hell for
[36:55] many many years when I was in pent cost
[36:57] I was scared of Hell terrified I lived
[37:01] under legalism and I so afraid my view
[37:04] of God was so warped and that I thought
[37:08] God was out to get me and he's waiting
[37:10] for every mistake that I made and he's
[37:14] with his hand back he's going to swat me
[37:16] and he's going to get me so you see it
[37:18] wasn't just this message that changed my
[37:21] theology about doctrines and serpent
[37:23] seed and stuff like that it changed my
[37:26] view about
[37:28] God 42 years ago this week I stood in
[37:32] Monella Kentucky March the 27th
[37:36] 1983 I was a Pentecostal
[37:39] pastor and I introduced the message of
[37:42] the hour to that little church that I
[37:45] preached 42 years
[37:48] ago do you have any regrets Brother D oh
[37:50] I've got a lot of regrets but ain't none
[37:52] of them because I ever come to the
[37:55] message cuz I love it now more than I've
[37:58] ever loved it and to me it doesn't make
[38:01] us want to make an idol out of brother
[38:03] brandom but it makes us so grateful that
[38:06] God sent him to us that he would be able

[42:11] God's here to give it to you God's here
[42:13] to give you a refreshing he's here to
[42:14] pull you out of wherever you're at amen
[42:17] we don't have any other friend like
[42:19] Jesus amen so let's bow our heads for a
[42:21] word of prayer father we love you Lord
[42:24] we thank you for your love that you have
[42:27] for the children Lord and the love that
[42:29] you've shed abroad in our hearts by the
[42:31] Holy Ghost we ask Lord that you would
[42:33] take these words Lord that you have
[42:35] given me Lord and may you get the honor
[42:37] for them Father may they not be mine but
[42:40] may they be yours Lord that may be put
[42:42] in their hearts Lord uh as inspiration
[42:46] father to to lift and to strengthen your
[42:48] children father you know you know them I
[42:50] I know hardly any of them Father but you
[42:52] know them so I pray that you come Lord
[42:55] and speak to them in a special way way
[42:57] we give you the glory and honor for it
[42:59] in Jesus name amen amen I'm want to have
[43:03] you turn in your Bibles to Ephesians the
[43:06] 2
[43:09] chapter brother brandom preached a
[43:12] message um called the message of
[43:15] Grace and he took his text out of
[43:20] Zachariah 47 that says who art thou oh
[43:23] great
[43:24] Mountain before zerubabel you shall
[43:27] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[43:30] The Headstone thereof with shoutings
[43:32] crying Grace Grace unto it that word
[43:37] grace in the Old Testament means favor
[43:41] it means acceptance this means unmar
[43:45] favor or Regard in God's
[43:49] sight in the Primitive Hebrew it means
[43:52] to bend down or to stoop in kindness to
[43:55] someone inferior I aren't you glad that
[43:57] he
[43:58] has amen so I I want you to know that
[44:03] without Grace we don't have a
[44:05] message and God certainly believes in
[44:09] Grace amen and and we're find here with
[44:12] Paul and Ephesians 2 we begin to read
[44:14] verse one and you hath he quickened who
[44:17] were dead in trespasses and sins where
[44:20] in time pass you walked according to the
[44:23] course of this world according to the
[44:25] prince of the power of the air the
[44:27] spirit that now worketh in the children
[44:30] of
[44:31] Disobedience among whom also we had all
[44:33] our conversation in times past in the
[44:36] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[44:40] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[44:42] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[44:45] others but God who is rich in Mercy amen
[44:49] for his great love where with he loved
[44:51] us how many got a Bible here raise your
[44:53] hand all right I want you to read that
[44:55] verse again with me will you but God who
[44:58] is rich in Mercy for his great love
[45:02] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[45:05] dead in sins hath quickened Us Together
[45:07] by Grace you are saved and has raised us
[45:10] up together and made us sit together in
[45:13] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[45:16] the ages to come he might show the
[45:18] exceeding Riches of his grace in his
[45:20] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[45:23] for by grace are you saved through faith
[45:26] and that not of yourself it is the gift
[45:28] of God not of Works lest any man should
[45:31] boast for we are his workmanship created
[45:35] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[45:37] God hath before ordained that we should
[45:40] walk in them God bless you you can be
[45:43] seated may he bless the reading of his
[45:45] word amen in the in the New Testament
[45:48] here the word Grace thank you brother uh
[45:50] sure
[45:52] yeah amen appreciate it the word grace
[45:56] in the New Testament I'm not going to
[45:59] try to pronounce the Greek version of it
[46:01] cuz I'm not Greek amen but it it means
[46:04] graciousness it means especially the
[46:07] Divine influence upon the heart and Its
[46:11] Reflection In The
[46:13] Life um including
[46:17] gratitude acceptable benefit favor Grace
[46:21] gracious and
[46:23] joy amen you know uh as I heard brother
[46:27] Donnie speaking about brother brandham
[46:30] we love brother brandham we love amen
[46:32] that God Amen has sent his message
[46:35] through him to us amen but we also know
[46:39] that he did not send him to us so that
[46:41] we might follow him in the sense of
[46:44] following a man Amen brother bham said
[46:46] in the church age book last page he said
[46:49] not for one moment do I come Amen to
[46:52] make you followers of me he said but I
[46:54] come I want to see one thing and that is
[46:57] a true spiritual relationship
[46:59] established between God and man amen
[47:02] that is still the drive amen that is
[47:04] still the message amen and that is still
[47:07] what God is doing is to establish a true
[47:10] relationship so there's no wall between
[47:13] you and God Amen so that your perception
[47:15] of God is amen of not of some Earthly
[47:18] father who is an abuser or somebody who
[47:20] hates you and somebody that I got to try
[47:22] to please him to get his favor and and
[47:25] and and so we're always trying to please
[47:27] that man amen and that's many view many
[47:30] times the view of a denomination if you
[47:32] don't please us you're out of here amen
[47:34] but that's not our God God is always
[47:36] working in Divine favor to win your
[47:40] heart amen God does not want you to make
[47:43] a choice because you have to make a
[47:45] choice out of fear he wants you to make
[47:47] a choice because he won Your Heart by
[47:51] love praise the name of the Lord so then
[47:54] one of the uh when brother bam was
[47:56] preaching C is this the time or is the
[47:58] the is this the sign of the end sir uh
[48:01] 1962 and he's and he's speaking about
[48:04] some of the things that that the angel
[48:07] the seventh angel what he would uh what
[48:09] the Mysteries that he would he would
[48:11] show and and so he actually begins to
[48:14] read the list that that is in the
[48:16] scoffield Bible but then he goes beyond
[48:19] and he says now that's some of the
[48:20] mysteries of this angel that he's
[48:22] supposed to wind up he said but may I
[48:24] say this with reverence and not ref
[48:26] referring to
[48:27] myself but referring to the angel of God
[48:31] Amen you understand this message is not
[48:34] cly devised fables amen amen how the
[48:38] enemy is trying to make it now like it's
[48:40] the message of a man and so if it's a
[48:42] man's message you can walk away from it
[48:45] so easily but I want to tell you if it's
[48:47] not a man's message you'll never get
[48:49] away from it no matter how much you walk
[48:53] away it'll either save you or it'll
[48:56] haunt you
[48:58] praise the Lord and so amen he said now
[49:01] I want to say this with reverence amen
[49:03] that not referring to myself but
[49:05] referring to the angel of God the
[49:06] serpent seed been a hidden Mystery all
[49:08] through the years he said Grace
[49:10] straightened
[49:11] out not
[49:13] disgrace but real true Grace there's a
[49:18] real true Grace there's also a disgrace
[49:21] but there's a real true Grace amen he
[49:24] goes on to say about eternal secur not
[49:26] there's there's no Eternal burning hell
[49:28] and then he said that's one of the
[49:30] Mysteries and then he says the mystery
[49:32] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[49:34] sensation but the person of Christ
[49:37] performing in you the same works that he
[49:40] did now I understand that this quote has
[49:43] been misused and abused all down through
[49:45] the years but I'm not here Amen to try
[49:47] to bring another version of I just want
[49:49] to say it how the prophet said it and
[49:51] bringing you into that version amen
[49:53] because that's the version that
[49:55] works amen amen what has a prophet been
[49:59] dealing with he has been dealing with
[50:02] for years because the the ministry of
[50:04] the angels to take all the loose ends of
[50:07] the battles that all of these
[50:09] denominational ideas amen they've been
[50:11] fighting over the Holy Ghost they've
[50:13] been fighting over Doctrine they've been
[50:15] fighting over hell they've been fighting
[50:17] over evidence of the Holy Ghost and all
[50:19] these things it's the ministry of the
[50:22] Angel to come and bring the truth the
[50:26] original Faith back to the people so
[50:29] they can believe again and be
[50:32] free for years denominations
[50:35] denominational ideas denominational
[50:38] characteristics amen have interfered
[50:40] with how the Holy Ghost moves right and
[50:44] we've put interpretation on it how you
[50:46] should act if we're not careful in the
[50:48] message we're put another evidence again
[50:50] other than what the prophet
[50:52] said come on Amen but I want to tell you
[50:55] we don't have to fear any man because no
[50:58] man gave it to you here's a prophet
[51:01] saying I didn't even give it to you it
[51:03] came from the angel of
[51:06] God
[51:08] hallelujah but man has always
[51:12] interfered and tried to tell you how you
[51:15] should receive it well I just want to
[51:17] say the way the prophet said it the
[51:18] evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving
[51:21] the word for your age as it was in every
[51:24] age he that hath an ear let him hear
[51:27] what the spirit is saying to the church
[51:30] if God gave you an ear he said blessed
[51:32] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[51:35] that they hear for many have desired to
[51:38] see the things you see and to hear the
[51:40] things you hearen thankk you Lord amen
[51:43] because not everybody has that
[51:45] ear God has to give it to you and if you
[51:48] have an ear to hear the word of God
[51:51] you're blessed
[51:53] today amen so he said it's it's Grace
[51:56] straightened out not
[51:58] disgrace brother brandom and Satan's
[52:00] Eden and I trust you don't mind me
[52:02] reading these things he said I heard
[52:04] brother Neville say this morning someone
[52:06] might have been asking him why didn't
[52:07] preach on the Holy
[52:09] Ghost why didn't I do this he said here
[52:11] it is the Holy Ghost is the action in
[52:16] you it's a
[52:18] life not an
[52:21] emotion not some sort of a fleshly
[52:25] evidence but it is is a person Jesus
[52:28] Christ the word of God now listen
[52:33] established in your heart this is the
[52:36] desire of God this morning is to
[52:38] establish the word in our hearts because
[52:41] when the word is established in your
[52:42] heart it's to Quicken you to every word
[52:47] of this age that's why you're here amen
[52:51] that's the predestination the calling
[52:53] the election of God that's why you're
[52:55] here that's the part you have to play
[52:58] because God Amen solded the word through
[53:01] the prophet amen that that word was
[53:03] given to Faithful Men to bring out the
[53:05] same word I'm going to tell you God's
[53:07] not afraid to use
[53:10] men our problem in this hour is people
[53:13] don't trust the Holy Ghost anymore to
[53:15] get the job done so we got to
[53:17] interfere but God is Not Afraid Amen in
[53:21] the hands of men if the men are Holy
[53:23] Ghost filled amen it is still amen the
[53:26] Same
[53:28] Spirit and so God would commit just like
[53:31] Paul did to Timothy find Faithful Men
[53:33] and teach them the things that I have
[53:34] said amen so that they might spread the
[53:36] word out that's what God is looking to
[53:38] you to do brother brandom is not here to
[53:40] do the work
[53:42] anymore he's already sold the word but
[53:44] now it is your turn to rise up and take
[53:48] your position praise the Lord there's
[53:50] only one that can do it that's the Holy
[53:53] Ghost amen right he said said now watch
[53:57] the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in
[54:02] demonstrations so now here is the the
[54:05] prophet of God making a difference
[54:07] between
[54:08] demonstration and action right amen he
[54:12] said now watch it in action what it does
[54:16] according to the
[54:20] word praise the Lord let me just stop a
[54:23] minute and take a drink see I'm not in
[54:25] the basketball game
[54:31] anymore in the message of
[54:34] Grace brother Ram said now according to
[54:36] the prophecy there will come The
[54:37] Headstone what is The Headstone
[54:40] headstone is amen the Fulfillment the
[54:42] Perfection it's the word made flesh it's
[54:45] when Christ comes and that's when he
[54:47] came I want you to notice when The
[54:49] Headstone comes a prince is going to cry
[54:51] out the message here cry Grace Grace for
[54:54] it's by grace are we saved not of Works
[54:57] lest any man should boast and the
[54:59] message of Grace has been tramped under
[55:02] the feet of men until it's become a
[55:04] disgrace some of them run out into
[55:06] eternal security some of them run into
[55:08] everything but the true message of Grace
[55:11] Remains the Same that's what I'm that's
[55:14] the title this morning the true message
[55:16] of Grace and there is where Satan tries
[55:20] to knock it out of the church so he's
[55:23] going to try to knock the true message
[55:26] of Grace out of the church but it's the
[55:28] grace of God that we're all saved by I
[55:31] mean how many of us can understand that
[55:32] it's nothing you done amen that that
[55:35] merited you that favor but it was God
[55:38] stooping down to somebody who could not
[55:40] get up there and he stoop down to where
[55:43] you
[55:44] were oh maybe you don't understand that
[55:47] yet but you got to go through a process
[55:48] that you
[55:51] understand none of us are
[55:53] entitled but we are predestinated
[55:56] there's a
[55:58] difference entitlement thinks I deserve
[56:01] something but predestination is all
[56:04] about
[56:06] Grace Hallelujah now he said amen it's
[56:09] the grace of God we're saved by it's the
[56:11] deity of Jesus Christ if the Lord could
[56:14] come here come there and confirm that
[56:16] this is the truth not only that but by
[56:18] his word he confirms it's a truth and by
[56:21] signs and wonders he confirms it's a
[56:23] truth then also Grace is the
[56:28] truth you understand then why would
[56:31] anybody criticize and say grace is wrong
[56:34] that were saved by works you see this
[56:36] was the problem in Galatians they was
[56:37] trying to go
[56:39] backwards they was trying to to bring in
[56:41] circumcision again upon the upon the
[56:44] Gentiles and say you got to observe the
[56:45] law of Moses in order in other words you
[56:47] got to become a Jew and then become a
[56:50] Christian amen and Paul would write
[56:52] those words even though I are even an
[56:55] angel from heaven say anything different
[56:57] than what I have already preached see
[56:59] there's the
[57:01] action let him be a
[57:03] cursed you see it has to be by the
[57:06] original word God's not interested in
[57:09] our thought he's interested in our
[57:13] life praise the
[57:15] Lord he said now why would anybody uh
[57:19] criticize that we're saved by grace and
[57:22] and that we're and that and and say
[57:24] grace is wrong we're Saved By Word we
[57:26] are saved by grace through faith not
[57:28] works works shows you've been saved you
[57:31] see there's an outworking of Grace in
[57:32] our life but what saves you is the grace
[57:35] of God grace saves you Grace is what God
[57:37] does for you works is what you do for
[57:40] God you see the Gratitude of Grace to so
[57:43] appreciation of what God did for you but
[57:45] by Grace you're
[57:46] saved this is a little lengthy but just
[57:48] bear some people think because I joined
[57:50] the church put my name on the book
[57:53] that's all I have to do some people
[57:55] think because I shout that's all I have
[57:57] to do others think I speak in tongues
[58:00] that's all I have to do some thinks
[58:02] because I got power to heal the sick
[58:04] that's all I have to do but it's not
[58:07] it's the grace of God that saves you
[58:10] God's Amazing Grace so in other words he
[58:12] said you could do all those things and
[58:15] not have Grace right he said uh I cannot
[58:20] trust in any Merit some say well there's
[58:22] a great man that man I heard him stand
[58:24] up and do this I heard him stand up and
[58:25] do that Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13
[58:28] though I speak with tongue of men and
[58:30] angels and though I have discernment and
[58:32] though I have gifts to feed I'll take
[58:34] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[58:36] I can move mountains with faith and
[58:38] though I have knowledge to understand
[58:39] all things I am nothing till love comes
[58:42] in which is
[58:44] Grace God has to do it you can do all
[58:47] those things and be lost it's Grace that
[58:50] saves you his grace to the human race
[58:54] amen Jude would say amen I write you
[58:57] beloved to give all diligence amen of
[58:59] the common salvation it was needful for
[59:01] me to write you and exhort you you
[59:03] should earnestly contend for the faith
[59:05] which was once delivered unto the Saints
[59:07] for there are certain men crept in
[59:09] unawares who were before of old ordained
[59:12] to this condemnation ungodly men watch
[59:15] turning the grace of our God into
[59:19] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[59:21] God and our savior so that's the enemy's
[59:25] attempt he's always always going to
[59:26] attempt to take Grace out of your life
[59:30] because if you lose sight of what Grace
[59:32] is there's no more outworking of Grace
[59:34] in your life amen and your witness
[59:37] becomes stale and it becomes no good
[59:39] because amen we cannot carry this
[59:41] message oursel it must be the spirit in
[59:43] us that will carry that message amen if
[59:46] the Spirit Carries the message it'll
[59:47] give the true interpretation amen of
[59:50] what amen the characteristic of what he
[59:52] wants you to
[59:53] see amen I and I I and I love these
[59:56] things the prophet says about Grace and
[59:58] I'm trying to lay a foundation and
[1:00:00] obviously it's a big
[1:00:01] one amen we won't try we won't hold you
[1:00:05] long hopefully
[1:00:07] maybe
[1:00:09] amen here's another thing about Grace
[1:00:12] Grace is
[1:00:17] Sovereign do you know what Sovereign
[1:00:19] means Sovereign means one that exercise
[1:00:23] Supreme permanent
[1:00:26] auth
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:29] Authority so if Sovereign Grace is from
[1:00:32] a sovereign one it what can it do
[1:00:36] Sovereign can do whatever it
[1:00:42] wants amen it can do whatever it wants
[1:00:46] amen Sovereign Grace can only be given
[1:00:50] by one that's Sovereign and God is
[1:00:52] Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace
[1:00:55] therefore being Sovereign Grace don't
[1:00:57] have to ask
[1:01:00] anybody amen isn't that wonderful I
[1:01:03] don't have to it doesn't have to ask can
[1:01:04] I do this or shall I do this or can I or
[1:01:07] must I or will I it does it
[1:01:09] itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he
[1:01:13] can save the vest he can save the most
[1:01:15] immoral he can save the most impure now
[1:01:19] now I'm coming down now he's scooping
[1:01:21] down to our level he knows where we've
[1:01:23] been he knows what we've done he knows
[1:01:26] our battles you may be condemned but
[1:01:29] he's not here to condemn you he's here
[1:01:31] to convict you back to the grace of God
[1:01:34] it's not time to give up it's time to
[1:01:37] get
[1:01:43] up
[1:01:47] amen amen Grace is not just when he
[1:01:51] takes you out of the
[1:01:53] dirt no but Grace is what we live by
[1:01:58] Grace is what carries us Grace is what
[1:02:00] finishes it it's all the grace of God
[1:02:04] Amen you know uh Paul he's telling
[1:02:07] Timothy Timothy's a young man you're
[1:02:09] familiar with the scriptures amen let no
[1:02:11] man ah all right there goes they can't
[1:02:16] pass me the ball again I just lost that
[1:02:18] scripture amen huh let no man despise I
[1:02:22] you thank you and he's older than me
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:28] amen let no man despise thy youth you
[1:02:30] know what Paul is doing now Paul Paul
[1:02:33] had a established the Ephesian Church on
[1:02:35] the word of God the whole book of
[1:02:37] Ephesians a wonderful book amen
[1:02:38] parallels Joshua amen it's the crossing
[1:02:41] over it's the placing of God's people in
[1:02:44] their position in Christ and and now
[1:02:47] it's it's a wonderful book but a year
[1:02:49] after that he's already telling Timothy
[1:02:52] they're already coming in preaching
[1:02:54] something else come on and I can't get
[1:02:57] back there but you're going to have to
[1:02:59] do it and over 25 times in the book of 1
[1:03:03] Timothy and second Timothy he encourages
[1:03:05] Timothy in some way to be strong to stir
[1:03:07] up the gift of God let no man despise
[1:03:10] thy Youth and he tells him be
[1:03:13] strong in the grace of God Don't Be
[1:03:17] Afraid Amen to tell these men amen
[1:03:20] they've been swerved aside by Vain
[1:03:23] jangling and genealogies and all these
[1:03:25] false sciences and everything else and
[1:03:27] they've got caught up away from the
[1:03:29] original word Don't Be Afraid preach the
[1:03:33] truth the truth will fight the
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] battle amen so that word be strong it
[1:03:41] means to empower or to increase in
[1:03:44] strength you're going into a situation
[1:03:46] it's not going to take it from you it's
[1:03:48] going to increase God actually causes
[1:03:51] trials if you now trials can destroy a
[1:03:53] person but a child of God amen he has
[1:03:56] that Channel with God Amen that as he
[1:03:59] goes through trials he actually gets
[1:04:01] stronger not
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:05] weaker stronger not weaker not in
[1:04:10] himself in Grace
[1:04:14] right so much grace is even for
[1:04:17] unanswered
[1:04:19] prayers Grace is an answer to unanswered
[1:04:23] prayers
[1:04:27] if you can receive
[1:04:29] it his grace is
[1:04:31] sufficient Paul said I was buffeted by a
[1:04:35] messenger of the devil and he said I
[1:04:38] besought the Lord three times to take
[1:04:40] this from me now he had just got done
[1:04:42] talking about all the revelations he had
[1:04:44] and where he had been the Realms he had
[1:04:45] been into I knew a
[1:04:47] man but he then begins to say but I've
[1:04:49] been buffeted and I've and so now here's
[1:04:51] a man who has such
[1:04:53] access and yet God
[1:04:56] won't answer his prayer to be delivered
[1:04:59] from this
[1:05:00] messenger the way he wants it to be how
[1:05:03] many times if we prayed and it didn't go
[1:05:06] the way we
[1:05:08] prayed but it didn't mean it was a lack
[1:05:11] of faith and it didn't mean that God
[1:05:14] didn't
[1:05:16] answer but Grace will give you knowledge
[1:05:20] and so he's he's there and he said I
[1:05:22] besought the Lord three times and he
[1:05:25] said that it depart from me and he said
[1:05:27] to me my grace is sufficient for
[1:05:33] thee you know what suff sufficient means
[1:05:35] it means to be possessed of unfailing
[1:05:42] strength the sufficiency of God is
[1:05:46] unfailing
[1:05:47] strength the sufficiency of God even
[1:05:50] means to be satisfied how can we be
[1:05:53] satisfied When God says no
[1:05:56] but God causes us to be satisfied
[1:05:58] because we know it's what he
[1:06:02] wants amen sufficiency my grace is
[1:06:05] sufficient means it's a strong
[1:06:07] wall Lord I have put my grace around you
[1:06:11] and Paul you're still I it's I'm going
[1:06:13] to allow that Messenger to come and
[1:06:15] Buffet you but you remember that your
[1:06:18] infirmities I rest amen I come to your
[1:06:24] weakness you see young people we're not
[1:06:27] careful we begin to think God despises
[1:06:29] young uh not young he despises weak
[1:06:32] people that we should only we interpret
[1:06:36] what we think strong faith looks
[1:06:38] like and we think strong faith is a
[1:06:41] force field around us that trouble can't
[1:06:43] get
[1:06:45] through and that's a
[1:06:47] lie faith is trusting God because God
[1:06:51] has to have a witness in every situation
[1:06:54] he had a job and it's God's prerogative
[1:06:57] whatever we go through it's God's
[1:06:58] prerogative he may commit you to death
[1:07:00] he may commit you to trouble like job he
[1:07:02] may commit you to some kind of trial but
[1:07:04] he trusts you to go through it and give
[1:07:06] God the glory in everything you're going
[1:07:09] through amen we're not here to be
[1:07:11] disappointed in our father we're here to
[1:07:13] give glory to his
[1:07:17] name praise the
[1:07:19] Lord them are the good works of
[1:07:24] God so Paul would preach Grace in
[1:07:28] Ephesians and he would mention it 12
[1:07:30] times the word Grace speak of it over
[1:07:33] and over and over Amen brother bam said
[1:07:37] in the Masterpiece he said now watch
[1:07:40] every Masterpiece is put on a
[1:07:42] foundation amen and he talked about
[1:07:45] Michel uh Michelangelo's Monument of
[1:07:47] Moses he say it's on a three or four
[1:07:49] foot piece of marble it's got a
[1:07:51] foundation he said God when he prepared
[1:07:53] this masterpiece he would take pat he
[1:07:55] took the Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:07:58] and Joseph and he and he made a
[1:08:01] foundation and we know that Abraham amen
[1:08:05] amen amen is
[1:08:08] Faith and then we know that Isaac is
[1:08:11] love and then we know Jacob is Grace
[1:08:14] brother bam said anybody read the life
[1:08:15] of Jacob has to believe in grace that's
[1:08:18] who I'm G to talk about here for a
[1:08:19] moment and then he said Joseph who is
[1:08:22] perfection so you notice amen Faith
[1:08:26] brings forth love love brings forth
[1:08:29] Grace love and grace brother bam said
[1:08:31] are
[1:08:32] sisters you cannot have one without the
[1:08:35] other love and grace have to go
[1:08:38] together so if you really love somebody
[1:08:41] amen it is not a narcissistic love that
[1:08:43] I only love you if you Pat me on the
[1:08:46] back no amen the love of God love and
[1:08:48] Grace has to go
[1:08:50] together amen there's a lie being told
[1:08:53] Amen in our age amen that if you really
[1:08:56] love me you're bear with me I'm going to
[1:08:58] tell you real love amen agape love is
[1:09:00] not allowing you to do whatever you want
[1:09:02] but real agapy love comes to the
[1:09:05] need amen if I wanted to be like you I
[1:09:07] say I love you do whatever you want I
[1:09:08] want to be like you then I got to become
[1:09:10] friends with what you're doing ien I
[1:09:12] don't become friends with what you're
[1:09:13] doing but if I have agape love amen I
[1:09:16] can speak to the need that's real
[1:09:18] love amen real love that can lift us up
[1:09:21] why because agape love had to speak to
[1:09:23] me
[1:09:27] amen so here's this foundation and
[1:09:28] brother B said that God put amen he
[1:09:31] begin to he began to build the body off
[1:09:33] of that Perfection so you have love you
[1:09:35] have faith love grace and grace brings
[1:09:38] forth
[1:09:39] Perfection amen every one of them you
[1:09:42] can find Jesus Christ in every one of
[1:09:43] these life is this something that all
[1:09:45] these Patriarchs not one of them had a
[1:09:49] Bible none of them had 12200 messages 13
[1:09:53] million commentaries none of them had
[1:09:55] amen YouTube to access and see what
[1:09:57] somebody's opinion on it amen nobody
[1:10:00] could go to the bishop Google and find
[1:10:01] out what do you that really mean nobody
[1:10:03] could use
[1:10:05] AI they had none of it but God took
[1:10:08] their life and he gave them a word and
[1:10:11] then he'd begin to build through that
[1:10:13] life because that life was going to be
[1:10:15] the
[1:10:16] foundation right see it's a
[1:10:19] life it's a person it's a life right
[1:10:24] amen and he begin to built through it in
[1:10:25] Abraham amen we can see all the works
[1:10:27] that God done through him amen the faith
[1:10:29] of Abraham the altars he built amen you
[1:10:32] can see amen the love of God in that you
[1:10:34] could see the type of Christ there Amen
[1:10:36] in Abraham the life of a man the stages
[1:10:38] of the church in the life of Abraham you
[1:10:40] could see the first coming you could see
[1:10:42] the second coming in the life of Abraham
[1:10:44] you saw
[1:10:46] Calvary How could a man live like that
[1:10:48] he didn't
[1:10:49] know cuz he didn't have nothing to go by
[1:10:52] he just followed God
[1:10:55] yes and God said I can use that then he
[1:10:58] had a son his name was Isaac Isaac amen
[1:11:00] there's only a few chapters of him amen
[1:11:02] but in that amen we see a type of the
[1:11:04] bride and Jesus Christ and his love for
[1:11:07] her and how he come and got somebody who
[1:11:09] is like him same
[1:11:12] blood amen came from the same
[1:11:15] country come on church amen that's my
[1:11:19] God God could take a life and show me
[1:11:22] there that by faith this morning I can
[1:11:24] look back all the way to men who don't
[1:11:26] have the Bible and see myself in the
[1:11:29] Bible and then it brought forth of Jacob
[1:11:34] now Jacob is just a mama's
[1:11:38] boy how many Mama's Boys we got here
[1:11:42] today when that takes
[1:11:45] guts praise the Lord for
[1:11:48] guts amen I like that well I guess I am
[1:11:53] too we're just joined forces
[1:11:59] now I I want you to see that always the
[1:12:01] message is always the word made
[1:12:03] flesh so to backtrack just a little bit
[1:12:06] so you had Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph
[1:12:08] and then he built upon that the prophets
[1:12:10] the body is formed by the prophets not
[1:12:12] formed by the law it's formed by the
[1:12:13] prophets and then out of the prophets
[1:12:15] come Jesus Christ The Headstone true
[1:12:19] amen when he come amen John wrote the
[1:12:21] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:12:25] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[1:12:27] only begotten of the father full of
[1:12:32] grace and truth that's why his Doctrine
[1:12:35] was
[1:12:36] different John bear witness of him and
[1:12:39] cried saying this was he who whom I
[1:12:41] spake he that come after me is preferred
[1:12:43] before me because he was before
[1:12:47] me and of his fullness have we all
[1:12:50] received and
[1:12:51] Grace for Grace look what happens when
[1:12:54] it comes to the Stone and the words made
[1:12:56] flesh and then it's Grace for Grace
[1:12:58] Grace just keeps coming
[1:13:01] out just keeps
[1:13:06] giving so now we come to Jacob Jacob is
[1:13:09] raised in a message
[1:13:12] home and he's twins we know how the
[1:13:15] prophet used Esau and Jacob as twins to
[1:13:18] describe the the the true church and the
[1:13:20] false church and how close they are I
[1:13:22] remember uh uh brother Homer Brown you
[1:13:24] remember brother Homer Brown and he's my
[1:13:26] wife's grandfather and and and and I
[1:13:28] have I have twins as well and when they
[1:13:30] were small uh he called me up and he
[1:13:33] goes hey brother Danny he goes um uh I'm
[1:13:35] preaching on twins at the church and I'd
[1:13:38] like you to send me pictures of your
[1:13:41] boys and I said
[1:13:44] nope amen cuz you're not going to use my
[1:13:46] boys my twins as example of biblical
[1:13:52] twins so he laughed he said he he
[1:13:55] understood because my boys are not Esau
[1:13:58] and Jacob all right they're both Jacob
[1:13:59] and Jacob anyway that's just what I have
[1:14:02] to say as my right as a father say nope
[1:14:05] you're not going to use them like that
[1:14:08] sorry brother Homer I know you've went
[1:14:09] on to be with the Lord and I love you
[1:14:10] and amen but I thank you for doing
[1:14:14] that full of grace and truth now amen
[1:14:18] Paul wrote about them he said the
[1:14:19] children Esau and Jacob being not yet
[1:14:21] born neither having done any good or
[1:14:23] evil that the purpose of God
[1:14:25] according to election my
[1:14:28] stand not of works but of him that
[1:14:34] calleth calleth it was said unto her the
[1:14:37] Elder Shall Serve the younger so now
[1:14:39] Jacob is raised in a message home it has
[1:14:41] the word of God present Truth for their
[1:14:43] day given to the parents the Elder Shall
[1:14:46] Serve the younger that was the
[1:14:48] word and God's going to bring it to pass
[1:14:51] I don't know how he's going to bring it
[1:14:53] to pass but he said said he would right
[1:14:56] so it's not my job to give
[1:15:01] God my opinion on how it should work I
[1:15:05] have to step back and let him do it
[1:15:07] because if I manufacture it I've now
[1:15:11] stepped into the permissive will of God
[1:15:13] and not the perfect will he always make
[1:15:15] the permissive will amen for his glory
[1:15:18] but the permissive will has a lot of
[1:15:21] damage oh yes a lot of hurt even a lot
[1:15:25] of
[1:15:26] death a lot of
[1:15:28] division but God will make it work for
[1:15:30] his glory in other words he'll still
[1:15:32] bring it all the way
[1:15:34] around and make it happen the way he
[1:15:38] said but it may delay
[1:15:41] it so now here's Jacob and here's Esau
[1:15:46] two
[1:15:47] boys and those two boys cause a division
[1:15:49] in the family now Isaac's a
[1:15:51] prophet but it caused a division in the
[1:15:54] family
[1:15:55] because Jacob was mama's favorite and
[1:15:58] Esau was daddy's favorite and Esau's a
[1:16:01] prophet Esau knows what God has said I'm
[1:16:03] sorry J uh Isaac knows what God has said
[1:16:09] right but because Isa uh because Esau is
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:14] firstborn amen the blessing is for him
[1:16:17] and the birthright blessing is for
[1:16:20] him the the abrahamic blessing amen the
[1:16:24] the blessing from Eden the serpent
[1:16:25] Bruiser is to go through the
[1:16:29] firstborn it was all to go through
[1:16:32] that but God had said the Elder Shall
[1:16:35] Serve the younger how's that going to
[1:16:37] happen how's the birthright going to
[1:16:39] fall upon this man when we already got
[1:16:41] division in the Church of
[1:16:44] Isaac and and now they get older and you
[1:16:48] know as time gets near for fulfillment
[1:16:50] we start becoming impatient right we
[1:16:53] start starting p
[1:16:55] Bush and came time that Rebecca heard
[1:16:59] Isaac tell Esau go make that venison
[1:17:03] that I
[1:17:05] like and when you come back we'll eat it
[1:17:08] and I'm going to give you the blessing
[1:17:09] Rebecca heard
[1:17:11] it so she came and told Jacob said Jacob
[1:17:16] your brother's going out to the field to
[1:17:17] get some
[1:17:18] meat he said we've got to do
[1:17:21] something to get this
[1:17:23] blessing she goes I tell you what I've
[1:17:26] got some of your brother's
[1:17:29] clothes and I know how to make the food
[1:17:31] the way he
[1:17:32] does so now you let me make this meal
[1:17:37] and I'll dress you in Esau's
[1:17:40] clothes you have to pretend you're
[1:17:44] Esau and you'll get the
[1:17:48] blessing now there is how the church got
[1:17:53] involved the Holy Ghost without
[1:17:55] sensation because she is producing a
[1:17:59] sensation that looks like someone else
[1:18:02] and God does not want you to look or
[1:18:04] smell like anybody
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:09] else now I could wear these brothers
[1:18:11] coats and I could act like them and you
[1:18:13] could think woo he's got it can you
[1:18:15] imagine if I preach like Brother David
[1:18:17] I'd been to the hospital twice
[1:18:18] already I'd be the chiropractor I'm jerk
[1:18:21] himself around I admire that man he's
[1:18:23] like a cat you know I I
[1:18:26] you see what Ian are I preach like
[1:18:27] brother Donnie no way but if I wore his
[1:18:32] coat and his cologne you have cologne on
[1:18:35] brother yeah okay I'm not going to ask
[1:18:37] you what kind I'm a little afraid and
[1:18:40] and then she takes the church hands him
[1:18:44] this bowl of meat and the church says
[1:18:47] here's your brother's clothes now you
[1:18:49] got
[1:18:53] it and you know Isaac is old and he's
[1:18:58] blind amen and he's like he hears Jacob
[1:19:01] talking so he's confused and he goes
[1:19:04] well you sound like you sound like Jacob
[1:19:09] but you smell like Esau come come here
[1:19:12] I'm G to come here come here okay I'm
[1:19:15] going to really get him now hug me hug
[1:19:17] me oh yes this is definitely
[1:19:21] Esau definitely Esau all right amen and
[1:19:24] then he put the blessing on him and
[1:19:27] Jacob stole the blessing now something
[1:19:29] had happened a while back and what
[1:19:31] happened was Esau had sold his
[1:19:34] Birthright for a bowl of
[1:19:37] pottage because he was so
[1:19:40] hungry amen and there was something in
[1:19:43] Jacob that desired he wasn't a good
[1:19:46] person he was he was a deceiver that's
[1:19:49] what supper is amen or Jacob means a
[1:19:51] supper he's a
[1:19:53] deceiver and I want to tell you I don't
[1:19:55] care if you said in a message church if
[1:19:57] you sow to the flesh you're going to
[1:19:59] reap corruption but if you sow to the
[1:20:02] spirit of God you're going to reap amen
[1:20:05] what is put in there is that true amen
[1:20:08] so here is a man trying to be what the
[1:20:11] church is telling him to
[1:20:13] be but it's not what God Said
[1:20:17] right it's what she said
[1:20:20] right I want to tell you amen you're not
[1:20:23] here to put a coat of a Church on you're
[1:20:26] not here to put the cat of your favorite
[1:20:27] preacher on come on Church you're not
[1:20:30] here to say what church you attend
[1:20:31] because I want to tell you something I
[1:20:33] got news for every one of you there is
[1:20:34] not one Church in this message taking a
[1:20:37] Rapture it is individuals it is
[1:20:40] individuals that have a relationship
[1:20:42] with God them are the ones taking a
[1:20:44] Rapture amen my church is not taking a
[1:20:47] Rapture it's the people out of
[1:20:50] it so your church cannot save you that's
[1:20:55] there's no man can intervene for you but
[1:20:59] weep not
[1:21:00] John for the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:21:04] he has
[1:21:05] prevailed no Prophet no man no Priest No
[1:21:10] Pope Jesus
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:13] Christ and if you're in
[1:21:16] him you can no more die than he can
[1:21:19] die you can't go to hell cuz he already
[1:21:21] went to
[1:21:23] hell Hallelujah destined for amen a body
[1:21:26] change ca he already amen paid the price
[1:21:29] bought you with the price you're not
[1:21:30] your
[1:21:31] own so then why would I settle for my
[1:21:34] brother's coat but he got his he got the
[1:21:38] blessing from
[1:21:40] Daddy and just after he
[1:21:43] left here comes his brother
[1:21:45] in Esau's coat and now it was Esau with
[1:21:50] his meat the Bible says Isaac trembled
[1:21:56] CU now he realized I've given the
[1:21:58] blessing
[1:22:00] away and I can't get it
[1:22:04] back that's what Paul was referring to
[1:22:06] when Esau sought it with tears but there
[1:22:08] was no place for
[1:22:10] him because he counted as a common he
[1:22:13] counted the birthright as common in
[1:22:14] other words when he went and sold his
[1:22:17] Birthright for the bow of poage the
[1:22:19] temporary was more important to him than
[1:22:21] the the
[1:22:23] Eternal and he saw no value because the
[1:22:25] birthright is actually spiritual not
[1:22:28] just natural things and so he put the
[1:22:31] value in the natural let me tell you
[1:22:33] young people you put all the value of
[1:22:36] God into the natural things you're going
[1:22:37] to miss it if you put it only in just a
[1:22:40] career and how how well you're doing and
[1:22:42] you start losing interest in coming here
[1:22:44] and you start mixing up and other things
[1:22:46] that's not the
[1:22:48] birthright you might say oh hey let me
[1:22:50] tell you I know it's God he opened the
[1:22:52] door don't you know the devil knows how
[1:22:53] to turn doors
[1:22:57] OBS he knows how to open
[1:23:00] doors because of that door takes you out
[1:23:03] of church takes you out of Fellowship
[1:23:05] that wasn't God that opened the
[1:23:07] [Applause]
[1:23:11] door
[1:23:13] Hallelujah so what did the
[1:23:16] birthright for
[1:23:19] Jacob produce at that
[1:23:22] time Esau came out of that meeting with
[1:23:25] his daddy so angry he said the time of
[1:23:27] my daddy's morning is coming and when
[1:23:30] he's dead I'm going to kill
[1:23:33] him so the church found out about
[1:23:37] it it's kind of like what we
[1:23:40] do he we find out about a problem let's
[1:23:42] just send them
[1:23:43] away get them out of here I want tell
[1:23:46] you what tell you what this cost Jacob
[1:23:48] it cost him this is the last time he's
[1:23:49] going to see his
[1:23:50] mother he's being sent away and his
[1:23:54] father told him his father told him you
[1:23:56] go down uh to
[1:24:00] laan your mother's brother go down there
[1:24:03] take a wife from somebody from there
[1:24:06] from of our own blood but you're going
[1:24:08] to have to get out of here now he's
[1:24:10] going to be gone for 20
[1:24:12] years 20 years but he got the birthright
[1:24:16] from his
[1:24:17] brother by
[1:24:20] deceit and I want you to notice when
[1:24:23] Esau sold his Birthright his name
[1:24:27] changed to Edom he became known for what
[1:24:31] he gave it up
[1:24:35] for you want to start a YouTube channel
[1:24:37] against this message that's the only
[1:24:40] thing you'll be known
[1:24:43] for you want to try to use your
[1:24:45] Instagram to try to pull children out of
[1:24:47] the church that's all you're being known
[1:24:51] for hello Edom that's all you want to do
[1:24:56] that's good now you're going to try to
[1:24:57] kill your
[1:24:58] brother but you're the one that gave it
[1:25:03] up you're the one didn't think the
[1:25:05] message meant anything yes sir you saw
[1:25:08] no value in
[1:25:09] it but here's a boy he's not even born
[1:25:12] again but there's something down in his
[1:25:15] heart said I got to have
[1:25:17] it I got to have
[1:25:20] it and I trust there somebody like that
[1:25:23] in here I got to have it
[1:25:24] [Applause]
[1:25:28] so off goes Jacob he's
[1:25:32] running and he comes to
[1:25:35] bethl the Bible says he goes down there
[1:25:37] and he lays down takes stones of the
[1:25:39] place and he lays his head down on it
[1:25:43] and he goes to
[1:25:44] sleep now according to the Bible bethl
[1:25:47] is where his grandfather Abraham had
[1:25:49] been true and built
[1:25:53] altars but to this young man he wasn't
[1:25:55] building ERS he was
[1:26:01] sleeping he was using the stones of the
[1:26:05] place to
[1:26:06] sleep and he didn't know God was
[1:26:10] there maybe I'm speaking to a Jacob
[1:26:13] right now don't know God's right here in
[1:26:14] this room right
[1:26:16] now but as he's sleeping the angel of
[1:26:19] the Lord appears to him now we're
[1:26:21] talking Grace right
[1:26:24] and he began to and he saw a ladder
[1:26:27] going to
[1:26:29] heaven and angels ascending and
[1:26:32] decending the Lord spoke to him appeared
[1:26:35] to him and said I will not leave
[1:26:41] you until I have performed the
[1:26:44] word that I said to Abraham and to
[1:26:50] Isaac he was just on the
[1:26:52] Run he didn't even know know God was in
[1:26:54] that place and the angel of the Lord was
[1:26:56] right there with him right you
[1:27:00] see God called you you may not even know
[1:27:04] it
[1:27:07] yet but when he appeared and he saw this
[1:27:10] Vision he woke up and he's afraid he
[1:27:11] said God was in this place I didn't even
[1:27:12] know it brother Bram said he said God
[1:27:15] was showing him Jacob's Latter was
[1:27:18] Grace and he said it was hooked he
[1:27:21] hooked it he hooked it to the throne
[1:27:25] and anchored it in Jesus Christ and put
[1:27:27] you in the middle he said there's no
[1:27:31] way you can be miss
[1:27:35] it wait a minute it's hooked to the
[1:27:39] throne amen Anchored In Jesus and I'm
[1:27:42] here amen so if I go back
[1:27:45] down he's still there and if I go up I'm
[1:27:50] getting closer
[1:27:54] oh it's
[1:27:56] Grace here's Jacob now he's going to run
[1:27:59] he goes he goes into to laan's territory
[1:28:04] and as it is with many amen he falls in
[1:28:07] love amen but the thing of it is he had
[1:28:10] slded to the
[1:28:12] Flesh and he met his match in
[1:28:15] laan so now you have two deceitful
[1:28:19] businessmen in the same family you
[1:28:22] imagine I'd like to have laan and Jacob
[1:28:23] said here as businessmen not as changed
[1:28:26] yet and let them stand up and give their
[1:28:27] testimony how they tried to keep
[1:28:29] cheating one
[1:28:30] another can I have your daughter yeah
[1:28:32] you can have her then he gave her
[1:28:33] another
[1:28:34] one I mean what would you no wait a
[1:28:36] minute no
[1:28:38] I'm let's not even go there what would
[1:28:40] you do
[1:28:41] amen he married n he gave him his oldest
[1:28:44] y
[1:28:46] Leah and then he said all right you're
[1:28:48] going to have to work for this other one
[1:28:49] seven more
[1:28:50] years man he was getting everything out
[1:28:53] of Jacob he could he was janum dry and
[1:28:55] that man was talented he knew how to cut
[1:28:56] a deal he was a Donald
[1:28:58] Trump of
[1:29:02] Genesis I mean know he was better than
[1:29:04] Donald Trump you got it I mean I mean he
[1:29:05] was bigly back there amen so
[1:29:12] amen so he's just draining him
[1:29:15] everything he
[1:29:16] can Jacob has been in a season of this
[1:29:19] weakness for 20
[1:29:21] years down there now he's got got two
[1:29:24] wives he's got
[1:29:28] children and things
[1:29:30] are he's he's wanting to get out of
[1:29:32] there because he's being ripped off so
[1:29:34] many
[1:29:35] times and he's like I I just want to get
[1:29:38] out of
[1:29:41] here and so they cut a deal I I could
[1:29:44] read it to you but for the sake of time
[1:29:45] it want and he went to to to Laban and
[1:29:48] he said listen uh if I could uh uh you
[1:29:51] know they they had their talk about
[1:29:52] wages and they complained and they
[1:29:54] fought about it and you said you've wed
[1:29:56] I've been here 20 years done this that
[1:29:58] and the other weighs my rages 10 times
[1:30:00] whatever more and so they're fighting
[1:30:02] and and so forth and he said he said if
[1:30:04] I could just have the I believe is a
[1:30:06] speckled and so forth the of the stock
[1:30:08] and everything and so laan says all
[1:30:10] right you can do that's a good deal but
[1:30:11] then he went and told his son said hey
[1:30:12] go pull them all out all the ones he
[1:30:15] wants get them out but they was great
[1:30:18] for one
[1:30:19] another I hope we don't have anybody in
[1:30:21] here like that you know and uh so his
[1:30:26] life is a mess his life is a
[1:30:30] mess but God had never left him in all
[1:30:33] of those
[1:30:37] messes the angel of the Lord actually
[1:30:39] appeared to him said I've seen all that
[1:30:41] laan has done for you and done to
[1:30:44] you I've seen all that Laban has done to
[1:30:47] you and he told him what to do and how
[1:30:49] take and so he he actually became very
[1:30:52] wealthy from the Angel's advice
[1:30:56] and when he done that it caused division
[1:30:58] again now here comes division because
[1:30:59] now he's ripping off the
[1:31:04] family and God is using
[1:31:07] trouble to drive him back
[1:31:11] home maybe I speak to a young person
[1:31:13] that's in trouble right now you know
[1:31:15] there's a there's a painting and I know
[1:31:18] it's been embellished on and and and
[1:31:20] locations changed and everything but the
[1:31:22] painting is of of the the devil and a
[1:31:24] young man playing a game of chess and
[1:31:26] it's called The Game of Life Checkmate
[1:31:28] and I I did research on it tried to find
[1:31:30] out where it came from because you know
[1:31:31] people have moved it all the way over to
[1:31:33] the lou and everything else but I found
[1:31:35] out it happened right here in the states
[1:31:37] 1888 there was an article written and it
[1:31:38] was about uh the chess champion a man by
[1:31:41] the name of Paul morphe and it was
[1:31:43] during the time of the Civil War and
[1:31:44] they' they'd have a chess club and
[1:31:46] they'd all come together these Champions
[1:31:47] would come together and play play chess
[1:31:49] and everything and so this Reverend had
[1:31:50] invited this chess champion over to his
[1:31:52] house and these Champions are there and
[1:31:55] and uh they're they're eating and and he
[1:31:58] looks up and he sees this picture of of
[1:32:00] the devil playing chess with this young
[1:32:01] man and and uh and it's called Checkmate
[1:32:04] and what it is is the devil's pieces are
[1:32:06] vices and the young man's pieces are
[1:32:08] virtues and every move the devil was
[1:32:10] making was taking a virtue from that
[1:32:11] young man and the painting has the young
[1:32:14] man down to no more moves he's there
[1:32:15] with his head in his hands the game is
[1:32:17] over it's called Checkmate and so this
[1:32:19] this champion this this Paul morphe he's
[1:32:22] he's uh he's eating food and he's
[1:32:24] looking at that and he just keeps
[1:32:25] looking at he gets done eating he goes
[1:32:27] over and he stands in front of that and
[1:32:28] he looks at it for a while and then he
[1:32:30] turns to the rever he said I believe I
[1:32:33] can take this young man's game and
[1:32:38] win and they said there's no way he's
[1:32:40] come down there's no more moves he said
[1:32:42] but I see Mo I see that I can win the
[1:32:44] game he said set the pieces up exactly
[1:32:47] how it is right there in the picture and
[1:32:50] so champion after Champion came and
[1:32:53] played chess with him on that move and
[1:32:56] every man was defeated by this
[1:33:00] Champion that when the young man thought
[1:33:02] it was all over and all the vices has
[1:33:06] ruined his life and his virtues are
[1:33:09] taken away a champion looked at his life
[1:33:12] and said you know what I can take that
[1:33:14] young man's game and I can win the game
[1:33:17] of
[1:33:18] life amen that's the Jacob that I'm
[1:33:21] talking about let me tell you something
[1:33:24] Jacob it's not over for you the angel of
[1:33:26] the Lord is still with you and he can
[1:33:29] take it even if your virtues are gone he
[1:33:31] can still win the game of
[1:33:36] Life blessed be the name of the
[1:33:41] Lord I look around the room and I
[1:33:43] believe the holy spirit is seeing some
[1:33:44] more young people I can take your game
[1:33:46] amen yes virtues might have been taken
[1:33:48] from you but I can take your game and I
[1:33:50] can still win why I'm the Champion am
[1:33:55] that's
[1:33:55] right oh come on somebody we got a God
[1:33:59] owns a cattle on a thousand hills his
[1:34:02] grace is greater his love is
[1:34:06] stronger you don't understand it but my
[1:34:09] God loves
[1:34:16] you that kind of Grace is what I need
[1:34:24] Angel of the Lord told him it's time to
[1:34:27] go back home go back to bethl where you
[1:34:29] first saw
[1:34:31] Grace go
[1:34:33] back so he left
[1:34:36] secretly amen laan laban's Sons heard
[1:34:40] about it and they chased him and they
[1:34:42] called him why'd you leave and you know
[1:34:44] the the story you know how they talked
[1:34:46] and everything young people I'm coming
[1:34:48] down to the end and I just what I want
[1:34:49] to tell
[1:34:51] you when he finally released him when
[1:34:53] Laban released him do you know Jacob
[1:34:57] still does not truly have the
[1:35:03] birthright he has the
[1:35:06] knowledge he has the
[1:35:10] Heritage he even has
[1:35:13] visions and he has
[1:35:15] visitation but he hadn't been
[1:35:18] changed you know why he hadn't been
[1:35:20] changed he hadn't left the past behind
[1:35:24] and he hadn't made it
[1:35:28] right no no matter he say well I got the
[1:35:30] birth right but he done his brother
[1:35:34] wrong so all this trouble between Jacob
[1:35:37] and
[1:35:39] lean they came to an agreement they said
[1:35:42] we're going to build a pillar right here
[1:35:44] it's going to be a pillar of witness for
[1:35:45] our agreement we're not trouble one
[1:35:47] another anymore and here's what this
[1:35:50] means when we build this that means I
[1:35:52] will never cross over over that and you
[1:35:54] will never cross over that yourself in
[1:35:56] other words you will never go
[1:36:01] back there's a lot of people sitting
[1:36:04] churches but they're always talking
[1:36:06] about what's happened come on come on
[1:36:09] come on always talking about the past
[1:36:11] always like you're a victim or something
[1:36:14] all
[1:36:15] right how can anybody stand in the
[1:36:17] presence of the Lord I'm not saying
[1:36:19] something hadn't happened to you and you
[1:36:20] had went through abuse or any kind of
[1:36:21] trouble it's not what I'm saying but how
[1:36:23] can anybody stand in the presence of the
[1:36:24] Lord and say I'm a
[1:36:27] victim when the unsearchable riches of
[1:36:30] his grace is poured out upon us and he's
[1:36:32] followed you even through all the
[1:36:34] trouble you've been he's followed you
[1:36:36] and he's called at your heart and now
[1:36:37] he's brought you to a place it's time to
[1:36:39] come home it's time to come home but if
[1:36:42] you're going to go home you can't ever
[1:36:43] go back and you got to tell God I'm
[1:36:46] never going
[1:36:49] back oh I wonder if we have any young
[1:36:52] people in here like that I'm never going
[1:36:53] back
[1:36:55] I'm going to I'm going to build a pillar
[1:36:56] of witness right here in this church
[1:36:58] right now I'm not going back to
[1:37:00] bitterness I'm not going back to memory
[1:37:02] I'm not going back to defeat I'm not

[1:46:18] Lord
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:21] amen so so grateful for God's grace I
[1:46:24] couldn't help but thinking when brother
[1:46:26] Danny was preaching brother Brandon
[1:46:29] preached a message I think it was in '
[1:46:30] 63 and he titled a message called
[1:46:34] Grace brother Brandon was telling the
[1:46:38] people he said I'm going to explain
[1:46:39] grace to you in the best way I know
[1:46:43] possible it began to tell a story of of
[1:46:46] a king that had a rich he was a rich man
[1:46:48] he was a king and he had a
[1:46:50] son he started to tell how how some man
[1:46:54] murdered his son violently and there was
[1:46:57] this big Manhunt this man they went out
[1:46:59] and they found this man they passed
[1:47:01] sentence on him and they they put him in
[1:47:03] a sail and got ready to execute
[1:47:06] him the king said I want to go down
[1:47:08] there and talk to him I want to find out
[1:47:10] why he killed my
[1:47:11] son so he said the King goes down there
[1:47:14] and he walks into the sail and this this
[1:47:17] man is he's skinny his eyes are are sunk
[1:47:20] back in his head his face is all drawn
[1:47:22] in he's wearing nothing but a loin
[1:47:25] cloth and the King ask him says why did
[1:47:28] you kill my son why would you do such a
[1:47:30] violent thing what did did my son do
[1:47:32] anything to you and he said no sir he
[1:47:35] said he did nothing I was jealous of
[1:47:38] him and and and I'm crying not because
[1:47:41] I'm going to be executed but I'm I'm
[1:47:43] crying because I did such a violent act
[1:47:47] and brother brandom said that the king
[1:47:49] looked on him and said bring my robe
[1:47:52] put it on him destroy the
[1:47:55] records and he said a big limousine
[1:47:57] pulled up outside and the the king took
[1:47:59] the man out of the
[1:48:00] cell and put him in the limousine and
[1:48:03] took him to his his house to live with
[1:48:05] him and he became his
[1:48:09] son he said that was me and you in that
[1:48:11] cell because we killed his
[1:48:15] son and we look at we that that's God's
[1:48:19] grace and a lot of you are dealing with
[1:48:21] things in your life and you you many
[1:48:23] times you you might wake up in the
[1:48:25] middle of the night and say Lord why am
[1:48:26] I going through
[1:48:28] this if he showed that much grace to you
[1:48:32] that he would clothe you in his own
[1:48:35] garments what makes you think he
[1:48:37] wouldn't give you Grace for the little
[1:48:38] bitty thing that you're going through
[1:48:40] right now our problem is when we walked
[1:48:43] into his house with his robe on we we
[1:48:45] look in the mirror and we still see
[1:48:48] ourself we still see the the person that
[1:48:51] was laying in the cell
[1:48:54] but when Grace walks in the room he sees
[1:48:56] the Son and Daughter of a king than you
[1:48:58] so if you can trust God God will never
[1:49:01] bring you
[1:49:02] out of of where you were in
[1:49:06] sin and let you go through something and
[1:49:10] not help you through it he's not that
[1:49:12] kind of God when you're going through
[1:49:14] something right now if you're I've said
[1:49:16] it here before if you're a son and
[1:49:17] daughter of God you're going through
[1:49:19] something it's because God looked at you
[1:49:21] and said you're worthy to take
[1:49:23] this you've got shoulders that are wide
[1:49:27] enough somebody else can't take that
[1:49:30] because you're a King's son you're a
[1:49:32] king daughter a King's Daughter so trust
[1:49:34] God with everything that you anything
[1:49:36] you're going through just trust God with
[1:49:40] it where's uh brother I want you to come
