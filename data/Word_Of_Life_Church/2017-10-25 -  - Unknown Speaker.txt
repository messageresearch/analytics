of the way dear God that you could come and speak to us tonight by your word I pray best for the Donny dear Lord and assembly here I pray father Lord may your hand be upon him dear God we just love and thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's name and the bride said amen God richly bless you if you have your Bibles tonight we will invite you to the book of Saint Luke chapter 22 verse 39 a man we certainly loved the Lord tonight don't you and they certainly say we appreciate brother Donnie friend not necess way to be in service with you tonight and certainly appreciate really Donnie and they stand on the word and the balance City the Lord has just really blessed our brother the balance in the message and has just really been a blessing in my heart so I definitely appreciate that and certainly loved the Lord tonight amen amen Saint Luke chapter 22 verse 39 I'm not a good public speaker so we just got to start preaching hey man hey st. Luke chapter 22 verse 39 the Bible says this and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said to them pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him I just loved that verse right there and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleepy rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation I want to speak tonight out of verses 42 saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done may God add the Blessed fruit of his word as you're seated tonight and I want to speak to him this thought of fully surrendered fully surrendered and brother Branham would tell us in a message and from that time he says God only wants one man he said that he can fully get in his complete control he said one man that will fully surrender to Him he said that's all God wants us to find one man that can fully surrender to him you know I believe tonight that we are as the bride of Jesus Christ must be a surrendered people not so much to the enemy that we're surrendering into the power of the enemy but we are surrendering to God and I hear brother Branham say this tonight I just want to lay a foundation if that's okay and I want to ask you this tonight maybe the question has been in many people's mind of what is my purpose of being here what is my purpose of being here but I was studying two messages and I heard brother Branham make these two statements and he says in leadership he said there's only one form of eternal life he said and that comes from God he said and he foreordained every creature that would ever have it just as you were in the gene of your father you as a gene in God so he says just as you were a gene and your father you are a gene in God one of his attributes to begin with he said or you'll never be there so the very evidence of why you're here tonight is because you had representation somewhere else Amen you had representation in another civilization you see we're not here tonight just just just people sitting on pews but we've got representation somewhere beyond Laodicea somewhere beyond the kingdoms of this world you've got representation in him he says now he said you'll never be there you come forth from the betting ground of your mother your father didn't know you you're in his loins and when you come forth and betting ground of the mother then you became a human being and are made in the image of your father now you can fellowship with him he said in the same thing by God so the same thing is happening by God he says he says now you can fellowship with him he said if you've got eternal life he said the life that you come in the natural after physical life that was by your father and the only way you can come born again is the only way it has to be from your heavenly Father his attributes he said all the father's given me will come to me see he said I'll not lose a one of them you know I take a confidence tonight I take assurance tonight and knowing that God will not lose or one of us he'll not leave so one of his sons he'll not lose a one of his daughters if he has placed you here tonight you are here on divine commission from the presence of Almighty God you are here by hand selected by God to whip every devil out of hell to stand against every power that Satan is loosed in this hour you see we are more than just people on the earth tonight we are from heaven we come from God and we must go back to him he says it like this he says see he says you are here I just love that you are here how many's here tonight you are here he says because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world he said that's exactly right your Genie said your spiritual gene of your heavenly father I love that he said is a part of God's Word he said that to me so he says I've said it like this with Jesus when he was here because he was the word now let's just this he was the word he said he sees that you suffered with him you died with him you were buried with him and you rose with him and now full glory to God and now you are sitting in heavenly places with him tonight the position of the believer it's not under the devils feet the position of the believer tonight is in heavenly places amen you know we preach a lot about finding our position and I believe that but I think we also need to tell the devil he's got a position the devil's got a position it's not in the heart of a believer glory to God it's not in the heart of a church it's under the feet of the bride of Jesus Christ I love this he says and then I am God who is rich in mercy he said and then after a while you heard the gospel he said maybe you went to church you picked out fits in that and went from denomination to denomination but one day Oh glory to God but one day he said you being a part of God he said you had to be a part of the word and he said and when you heard the word you knew where you come from you know what was the truth he said you were always you were always he said the seed was in you always you see I'm not gonna back up on preaching the revelation of this message because this is the only hope that we've got in Laodicea it's the power of representation that come from another kingdom that come from another dimension in the midst of such darkness in the midst of such confusion a theologian couldn't break through it but God sent a prophet I'd known it with the pillar of fire to break through denominationalism to break through ever spirit and bring a Liberty to the sons and daughters of God that's why we're here tonight glory to God he said you were always he said the seed was in you always I love this the word seen the word the word seen the word it recognized itself Christ recognized himself in a group of people that was born in sin shapen in iniquity but there was a promised seed somewhere that was coming to destroy the kingdom of Satan [Applause] if Satan was that to that seat back there he's after it tonight Oh Gouri nicest that was before the foundation of the world you saw the word and you come to it you saw the world and you come to it but what must you do when you come to that word you must surrender when you come to the place that God for ordained for you to come to you must surrender to what he's brought you to my brother him says I was look if we quote just a minute I believe in quoting the Prophet he said now I was going to choke him but I'm going to say it he said man is omnipotent he said you don't believe that but he is thank God for a prophet that would not choke the vindication of God speak it out of him a man listen to say man fully surrender to God is omnipotent a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent I [Applause] didn't say that the Prophet said that a man fully surrendered to God what is he surrendered to the flesh the flesh has got nothing to do with this he is surrendered to the scene that is only it oh come on church he is surrender to that see that God placed there that the word saw the word and came back to who it was I don't know about you but thanks be to God for the day that the word saw the word and I come back to who I was I was in sin but that was not my eternal destination I was bound in sin but that was not where God was going to leave me he was gonna send a message to strike something and call you out of it [Applause] he said did not he's saying mark 11:22 what several things you saying don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass did he not say that he said what happens when to omnipotence meet you want to see hang around a little bit longer what happens when two armed epithets meet when God and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to shake so the Prophet was saying that when a man so surrenders to God when a man pours out everything that he is to God he is surrendering to the Lord on the inside of him Oh glory he is surrendering to the word that is only inside of him and when that man meets God something's got to shake oh I heard really bad let me say last night on the way back the message the way back he said oh they was giving Jesus a hard time he said they were going around saying he's a man trying to be a God I felt no for the gym they've got that wrong he is a God trying to become a man to reach down and pick up men and bring them back to the position because the scripture said ye are as gods and the only thing the word brings forth is children of God the word don't bring forth natural the word brings forth supernatural [Applause] he said whatever you say with that creative power listen what God has placed in you with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out younger and brings things to pass so when you speak the word when a son of God takes the word of God in his heart and places it upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking oh glory that is the same as theity speaking he said it brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because to omnipotence have met I really met him talks like this he says because to omnipotence of men but first a man must be fully surrendered and I'll say this tonight we are either surrender to the devil or we are surrendered to God there's no in-between there's no purgatory in this thing you're either fully sold out to God or you're fully sold out to the devil there's no gray lines there's no more compromising this is seed time this is time for the sons and daughters of God to manifest what's on the inside of them [Applause] let me say this tonight either Satan has possessed or temple or goddess for sister temple either the devil is possessed your temple or the power of the resurrected Christ that's so possessed your temple you see people can sew straighter to the devil until he actually speaks through them or people can so sure in her to God until he speaks through it let me ask you tonight who's speaking out of you [Music] when we say things like I'll never make it that's not God well preach somebody when we say things like I'm a failure and because of my background because of my childhood and because of things I've been through I'll never obtain this promise that my friend is the devil speaking out of your lips but he's got no right to your lips tonight he's got no right to speak out of you there is a holy God that is desiring to possess your temple to where you start saying the same thing he says you say I can't make it but God rise up inside of you and say you are ready made it I can't take a rapture but the power of God raises up and says a rapture was made for you to make [Applause] people consider to God until he speaks to him look at the maniac of Ghaderi the Lord comes to him the Lord Jesus comes to me and says what's your name and those demons had supersets that man's temple that they spoke out of him and said we are legion for we are many look at the man that came to brother Branham says I'll break every bone in your body do you really think that man would have said that if the Holy Ghost was in there because the word can't fight the word that's why I got a problem with people saying they believe God sent a prophet but yet they're always fighting what the Prophet said either we believe what he said or we don't [Applause] well and I think we're you know we're counting the day in time we just need to kind of back up off the saying what brother I'm saying kind of back up off you know just preach something simple what are we thinking friends we're fixing to step into another dimension we're this close why do you think we're going to go back and start preaching dead denominational ideas that's got no power it's got no life in them listen to me they're not the only thing that's got life is this message the only thing that's got power is this message they will scare to death to say something brother branham said Oh glory to God they're scared to death to get us a brother branham said well they might think I'm a denomination they might think I'm a closer let them think I'm a closer I don't care I don't care listen to me I've seen funerals beat dentists 4 o'clock and watch a man of God get up and read a quote and say this is a quote that this man believed and watched the power of God break across an audience simply by the words of a prophet what could happen inside of living Tabernacles if we would so eat on those words and so possess those words into ourselves what could happen among us tonight [Applause] people get them quote politicians but they won't say brother Ram said I've heard preachers get up and quote aaand who was the alcohol and drinking preacher but let him say William Branham and they're scared to death I'm not scared to say the name William Branham I was proud of God to preach a message and it's a message of life and I'm gonna say when a prophet's already said and watch the power resurrection come behind those words and rip off the chains of captivity rip off the chains of homes what families come back together watch there'd be race what's all these things happen simply because we are manifesting what God has called us to don't be scared of it we're called to it we're called to this message we've been equipped to carry this endtime word bothered of God hallelu we're here for a purpose I [Applause] gotta tell that old wine they will get off my property cuz I'm gonna start speaking the word I'm not going backwards I'm going forward brother Ram didn't walk out there that day preach that message why Christ speak go back and preach it for Moses day and say Moses stood there and cried the whole time he never spoke he just stood there and cried what brother him said but him said he spoke what was there when you get a revelation of that title why cry speak why cry about these infirmities speak to him why cry about our fears speak to him why cry about our sicknesses start speaking them you've got a right to speak the word I say thanks be to God thanks be to God but we can speak something of life and then said I'll break every bone in your body but look at a man so possess the power of the Holy Ghost he looks at him and he says you'll fall across my feet so you got two vessels one is possessed of God and one is possessed of the devil and you got a meetin somewhere and one says you'll fall across my feet and the other and the other says I'll break every bone in your body but who's got Authority a downcast defeated devil or a son of God who's got Authority the devil or a son or daughter of God the devil is a liar can you say Amen he is the father of all lies he couldn't tell the truth if his life depended on it so I ain't gonna believe one thing he's got to say I'm gonna believe the promise of a resurrected Christ and that man fell across the prophets feet [Applause] and the police officer comes and says the rest says can you just move him off my feet the police officer says is the man delivered they said no he worships that spirit he worships that spirit think of that he worships that spirit but how does he worship does he contact that spirit and pull it out and bow to it and reverence it by speaking hooks by speaking things that that devil wants him to say he is actually giving worship to that devil he is actually surrendering to the devil by what he's saying god help us tonight friends when that Devil depressor to that demon of all kinds of things speaks out of us we are actually worshiping that spirit but I'm not called to worship a defeated devil I am called tonight to worship a resurrected Christ [Applause] remember says I was born in this world not by the will of man or not by man but by the will of God by design for the nation of God not by my holiness I have none but unnies saying I have no holiness I have no merits but are you gonna see I'm bout to shout I have got representation somewhere and it comes from another Kingdom its conduct from a different world brother Branham says you have to be born by the will of God to be saved he says the nominee the church age book he says denominations are coming together by the will of man so there's actually a wheel driving that spirit but it's not the will of God it's the will of a system it's the will of a man that is uniting denominations together well what you not in this bride together the will of some man or the will of God you see by the random says that every person is born on the earth with the wheel think of that but our will is not always his will but least I love this but we serve a God that is a personal God and he cares he's interested in you he's interested in the small things he's interested in the great things he's interested in things that might seem insignificant to others it matters it matters to God because he is a personal God [Applause] so things that you might be ashamed of all glory things you might be ashamed to say that somebody or to say pray for me or to say help me you might be ashamed of that but God is a personal God and he cares about the smallest things he cares about the big things he cares about all things [Applause] the good thing about our personal God is he is a sovereign God I love this and saw their names supreme ruler or possessing unlimited ultimate power remson Laodicean church in the church age Bicky says he is a southern god pretty Blaine he is a sovereign God and by his own counsel he purposed the plan of salvation of his own of his own elect which he foreknew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the Holy Spirit I love this and the Holy Spirit carefully execute the will of the Father the [Applause] Holy Ghost carefully not haphazardly but carefully execute the will of the Father so I might come to church tonight I need healing brother Donnie might come the church not need encouragement for the West might leave victory so what does God do anoint one preacher for healing one preacher for for encouragement one preacher for victory the same preacher because there's a gift only inside of that vessel there is a gift on the inside that vessel that surrenders to the will of the Father Oh God don't you see why brother Adam said every preacher has gotta meet God on the backside the desert and get an experience with the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is got to end well that surrendered vessel to carefully execute the will of the Father to carefully bring you what you need and bring you what you need it's the will to father that he bring these things to you [Applause] surrender surrender to what God I love that he carefully carefully execute the will of the Father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he is in the midst of his church this great creator Savior God is faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep I love this his very existence is for his own the very reason he exists for the Charlie it's for you and for me [Applause] don't you let somebody bitching if the Holy Ghost it's some third person of some Godhead Trinity the Holy Ghost is the person indwelling our hearts feeling our souls changing our life healing our bodies raising the dead given the Holy Ghost casting out Devils bringing people to an experience the Holy Ghost is here for the very existence of this the very reason he exists is for the bride [Applause] foolery to God [Applause] that's why they come to brother Branham said brother Brennan likes you taking this message out in denominations he said it's not their food he said it's not their food he said this is bride food it's too rich for them [Applause] why would you go and sit me with people that hate you when you can go sydney with people that love you [Applause] hello why would you go and sit with people that can't stand what you believe and try to feed on this message when you can come and sit with brothers and sisters of like precious faith that love it [Music] you don't think I think a proper knew what he was talking about when he said Pentecost has died she's dead brother she denominated and God passed her by but when he passed her by he brought the same fresh manna rod on out of that denomination and he said us in heavenly places he found representation here he found representation there he said there is my self I will feed my bride the very reason I will exist brother been in the very region I will exist is be for them [Music] [Applause] he loves them and he cares for them and his eye is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are here with God in Christ it means exactly what it says oh I am so glad that my god abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true the word he will back it up he is fearless he will leave none of us but raise us up he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last days I am glad that I am resting in his faithful Ness I'm not resting in my own good works because I have none I'm not resting in my own marriage I'm not resting to what I can bring to Jesus because all I can bring him is nothing but filthy rags but I am resting I am resting in a seat of God that's got the power to bust forth revelation it's got the power to change our bodies I am resting I am resting in him I am resting in God tonight [Applause] brother Raymond says all ages that lark God before there was light you were God before there was the heaven you were God and when all life is finished and those stars are shining and the solar system is vanished you'll still be God he was God before the first star he was God before the first Sun he was God before the first sickness he was God before the first hospital room he was God before the first funeral home he was God before the first psychologist well I won't preach that and he'll be God when there is no more cancer he'll be God when there is no more high blood pressure he'll be God when there is no more hospitals he'll be God when there is no more sickness he'll be God when there is no more depression he'll be God when all else is failed he'll still be God [Applause] when there is no more obama when there is no more politics when there is no more Isis when there is no more terrorists he'll still be God he's God and God don't ever change and God don't lie glory to God hallelujah he says how come in that with we lil insignificant man try to comprehend in our mind or let Satan deceive us by trying to make us doubt what you said is truth surely you keep your word they'll do its look and seek out diligently over to God throughout all the earth to find someone a lot of em said in the church age book that the message is not broadcast out because it's not for everybody come on friends it's for that elected go back and say the church age but brother Branham plainly lays it out the purpose of the message was election to come and get what belong to God why are you sitting here tonight because you belong to God why are we rejoicing because we belong to God you can show your glory through for you're so anxious to let people see the great God who made the promise keep the promise he's so anxious to find somebody that believes the promise but also believes he's able to keep the promise is there anybody among us tonight that believes he is able to keep his promise that's all he's looking for tonight it's somebody that believes God is more powerful to fulfill [Applause] why did brother Branham say in the message it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness because God is looking for somebody as he said and God keeps his word every scripture must be fulfilled so God is looking for somebody that says God made the promise but he's able to keep it thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus that he won't somebody that he can manifest that promise through you are sovereign he says even over unbelief your grace overrides our husbands glory to God your grace Lord overrides our I believe your grace overrides it don't you see why prophet could preach the message of grace because what overrode a prophet getting so depressed that he got down actually take a gun and kill himself grace oh how many times is God's grace overrode some of our decision well I'm gonna quit I'm not gonna go to church I don't know how many times is God grace we're overrode bad and brought you to the house of God and you there and the Shekinah glory begin to fall and the Holy Ghost forget to speak into your life and begin to speak in your heart and you begin to wave your hand he's beginning to clap your hands you begin to worship God what was it it was God's amazing grace Oh riding our unbelief [Applause] hallelujah my god it was great it was great to goddess it was grace that ballast and it'll be grace it'll keep us [Applause] thank you Jesus when God chose you he didn't take counsel from no one concerning you glory to God hallelujah that'll make a pista pillion shout and speak in tongues glory to God God didn't take counsel brother damn concerning from anybody concerning you when he chose you he didn't call everybody out of your past and say what do you think about brother so-and-so but God before there was a star before God there was four there was anything when it was God and God salts alone he placed a predestinated sheet of lies on the inside of your soul and he invested everything he's got inside of a bunch of sinners that had been saved by God's amazing grace [Applause] knowing knowing see the new birth is not a question for a son of God because he knows when he chose him they would come to a new birth [Applause] he knew exactly where you would be he knew exactly what you would do and he knew that you would surrender to the word inside of you so he called you knowing you had come home knowing you would come back to the word knowing these things would happen [Applause] what a terrible shape who would be here tonight if we was riding on our natural birth well I about to shout right now if we was riding on what our family used to be and on what our ancestors used to be I think be to God that every son and daughter of God can come to the altar the Lord Jesus Christ and find a real fresh experience we're not riding on something dead we're riding no life tonight we are riding on the new birds we are riding on an experience of the word of God coming in our hearts [Applause] he chose you not based on what you weren't oh I love this but on the potential I bought he placed inside with that revelation with that revelation we can shake the kingdom of Hale do you realize that not the theory motion not with your feelings not with sensation but with that revelation that God chose you brother Branham said you look at the woman at the whale he said before she got into predicaments she was in he said she no doubt she was raised in a good home she was raised in her faith believe at home but he said when she met a man by the name of Jesus it changed her life Oh glory to God he said it changed her life he said what happened he said from that time she could say I was a prostitute but now I am a blood washed daughter of the Living God well I don't know about you but thanks be to God for the day he overshadowed my soul thanks me for God the day he said the Holy Ghost looking for me he sought you out he sought me out and now you can say I used to be a drunk but now I'm a Holy Ghost drunk I used to be a liar but now I'll tell the truth [Applause] thanks be to God scepter on that time we're not the same we'll tell me we're not the same we are sons and daughters of God who have surrendered to him glory to God hallelujah [Applause] from that time from that time and from this time I gotta hurry because I'm running out down we see there is two wheels it's the will of man and the will of God we see there is the perfect wheel and we see there is the permissive wheel now let's just go ahead and face facts another enemy said your natural birth was brought here by the permissive will of God did he not say that so what's it going to take to override that permissive wheel and in grasped us and bring us back into reach myself happy hey man what's it gonna take to bring us out of that permissive wheel and bring us right back into the perfect wheel it's gonna take nothing less and nothing more than the overshadowing power the same Holy Ghost that overshadow the Virgin will marry and impregnated her as a spoken-word scene it's gonna take that same Holy Ghost to overshadow your soul and birth you out of your natural desire and birth me out of your natural habit and bring you back to the spiritual gene that he placed inside of you the old man must die the old man must die and the new man must be resurrected hallelu must be resurrected it's just in your nature it's a change of nature it's just as easy for sons and daughters of God the still most views and say amen to the message of the hour and say Amen - what brother Branham says that is it for a drunk not to get in his truck and turn on a country song it's just that easy we're not here fighting and pressing into something it's birthing us it's pushing us back to a fully surrendered vessel that God can come down and so possess that temple that you go to speak in the same word a prophet spoke and watch it happen [Applause] let me say this - not the will of God is not just a wish and the will of God's not a desire the will of God will be manifested and all hail can't stop it hell couldn't stop it back then how do you think hail is gonna stop it now he'll couldn't stop that seed from coming forth and bruised in the head of that serpent how do you think it's gonna stop it now there is something pulsating there is a laughing hallelujah there is a life on the inside of every son and daughter of God we're giving birth not two natural sons it's not too natural daughters there is a seed of God given birth to a heavenly son into a heavenly daughter and this same Holy Ghost for the Donnie one day it's gonna burst us right back in to the same place we came from [Applause] how could really madam say you came from God I just stepped out on faith I said they come from God how am I gonna tell they're gonna get back their nonsense nonsense a prophet come with a word of God to tell you come from God but he didn't just tell you you come from God he told you a way to get back to God [Applause] it's not by dr. Dobson it's not my smiley face in Texas it's by the word of a vindicated prophet they had to kill her a fire accompanied his ministry that's the only way that's the only way that's the only way that's the only way that's the only way you're gonna step back into eternity that's the only way you're gonna step out of time and step back into eternity the only way it's gonna happen is that a word of Malekith or no way else that's the only way it's full and it's trauma this bullet it's strong it's pulling you back you look like you came from it's not it's not it's my spirit I will pull you back I will pull you back I [Applause] will not place you here without hope I will place you there with faith the same faith that father Abraham had it's the same face I'm gonna give you [Applause] and it's not you pushing it's the word drawing [Applause] it's the word drawing it's the word drawing I said I'm gonna tell them they come from God and then I'm gonna preach a message to get him back to God Oh God don't you see if something's ever birthed inside of you there ain't enough Devils inhaler talked you out of it you know how I know what my last name is I got it at birth I come from my father I come from my mother I'm identified by that name they give me at birth but brother Benton preached in 1965 the invisible union of Riley Lord Jesus Christ he said that old man must die Oh God you use Center to the name drunk let's say drunken you'd say here I come let's say liar here you'd come alive but now you'll answer those names anymore you know why because it's not a merit of your own it's not nothing we've done on our own it's been the grace of a sovereign God with unlimited power with all militants to speak in the hearts of people and say you will fulfill every scripture that's wrote about you it's just that ii [Applause] have a few more minutes now close REM says this is cheesy my brad the other is pregnant it by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride where to go the body of Christ isn't finished yet so it's a work in progress you build a house you get done on the outside you ain't got nothing on the inside you move from the outside to the inside you move from the outside of the inside and people drive by that house and say there ain't nothing going on there what's happening I mean yeah there's a truck there but we don't see nobody working but what's happening the workings going on on the inside oh don't you see why I probably had to come and preach women out of high heels without a bob-tailed shirts and out of earrings and everything else and preach men out of 65 shorts don't you see why I profit had to do that because he had to get the outside right so the Holy Ghost on the inside could go to refinishing and go to finish in the inner man [Applause] he had to finish the inside the soul the real you it must be complete [Applause] it must be complete the inner man is renewed day by day by day for it again there's a man one time God told me at the paint store said this man come in he was a painter he said was painting the house it was worth over I think he was like over one or two million dollars he said I was in there painting inside somebody stuffed one day knocked on the door I was the door I said sir what you need he said I want to buy this house he said I don't own the house he said I'm just painted he said well who owns it he said I'll get you the number he said but sir he just bought this house he's not gonna sell this house man looked at him and said he'll sell it one way or the other he got that guy's phone number he called him he said how much you want for this house he sent some house I just bought it said leave that painter alone let him get done in there he come back two days later he said I want that house and I'm willing to do what I got to do to get that house he said call the man that owns it you're talking the wrong guy he looked at it the paint was chipping on the front it didn't have shutters he's in terrible condition but the owner knew the value okay he said I want the house the guy called the owner said so this is the last time I'm telling you I want to buy this house he said how much do you want for it he said I want two point five million he said I'll have my wife write the check he wanted the house nothing was going to stop him from getting that house because he wanted his family to move into that house and live inside that house don't you see why when the devil had you on the auction block of sin he said they're not for sale I'm not giving him out but cross it the only way I'm gonna break this cycle is by going to a cross and I'm because I won't that vessel I will me at all on my family my genes to move inside of there and display myself I [Applause] want that house when I buy that house it will be a fully surrendered house let me say this to you not closing in the garden we found the Lord Jesus down and he's praying he's praying what is he praying there was something inside of that Cup that passed by him - glory to God - look inside that Cup and say I want to do it for them but that flesh was still there don't you see what I'm saying is arising the son he said he had to die a man the spirit left him in the garden what was the Lord what was God trying to show you by birthing that son of God dispensation Jesus on the earth he was trying to prove that men can live and women can live for the Holy Ghost and whip the devil every day of their life by his example son so he ghosts the garden and he kneels down in the garden and as he kneels in the guard he begins to pray he sees something inside of this Cup that causes him to say father let this cup pass from me but there was something there had to be a means glory to God there had to be a means by which he could redeem his people so he Lucifer the contradiction of sinners he kneels in the garden he begins to pray and he sees something in this cup then as he's praying it calls him to say father father let this cup pass from me and he's praying so hard it was not a little prayer but let's get down and pray god bless mommy god bless daddy God but it was not a prayer life bad he actually got in and begin to pray till he begin to sweat and as he begin to pray the sweat begin to drop from his brow and the capillaries begin to bust and he begin to pray to actually great drops of blood begin to fall the Puffin of God said it all hail had lined up around the labor there was a it's the Battle of the mind going back and forth that's what we're in right now the greatest battle ever fought is the battle of the mind and here he is the spirit left him in the garden so he's brand he's gonna die as a man and as his prayer in the Benham since all past sins all present sins and all future sins rested upon this man's decision and as you begin to pray he began to pray so earnestly and all hell will stand there waiting to hear a few words that would change the destiny of souls forever glory it would change the destiny of souls forever he begin to pray and as these words come across his mouth I could imagine hail just just fell apart why he was a son the example son he was a surrendered vessel to what the word the father he said I can do nothing left the father shows me first and he surrenders by saying father not my will but thy will be done and brother Branham says this he says and Jesus was here can friend he said now God did not spare his own son from this cruel testing that he will not spare you or I from the cruel testing and Jesus was here confronting the greatest test he ever had Gethsemane lay just before him where that once and final all-sufficient test must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulders there was no one in all heavens the earth could ever stood it but him and to know that all the sins of past sins in president sensing future sins rested up on this decision and listed this not what he was walking on water not when he was turning Brenner or not when he was taking a feeding 5,000 or turning water into wine no his greatest test his greatest victory of his Messiahship was what yielding to the word yielding to that word oh god what's the greatest thing is for us is to deny our flesh deny our self deny his eyes and say god I come to you and I surrender all that I am I surrender all that I am to you and it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or approved his great Messiahship that's when he said to God not my will but thy will be done that was the greatest victory he ever won is when he fully surrendered and close did I say this tonight the brothers just saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done what does that word will mean it means desire it means pleasure what one wishes or has determined shall be done used to the purpose of God the Blessed man comes through Christ of what God wishes to be done by us commands precepts real choice inclination desire once you see why God placed that seat inside of you because he knew he knew he knew that that seed would break forth let me say this tonight we will not go on a rapture and the seat of God be subject to our own sorry stinking rotten flesh we will go in a rapture and our flesh will be subject to the word that was placed inside of us before the foundation of the world and the greatest victory you ever had I'm sorry it's not when you might have went and done something greater the greatest victory you ever had is when you come and said Lord I surrender to the pool I surrender to what's pulling me how many people is God passed by their way and with the turgon and with the pullin but because it was not easy because it was not something simple they pushed it away but you sit here tonight not by nothing we've done but because the word seen the word and the word started dry as the musicians are coming tonight the word the word started drawing the rim told that story he said I was out there he said that little that little drop of water it begin to smile it began to have a revival he said I asked is it because I drink from his ecause I do this he said no if it could only speak little bit saying because I'm going back to where I come from something was pulling him it was not him pushing himself up it was something pulling all God friends do you not see tonight why it wasn't some music it wasn't some gift or some talent that really got ahold of you it was the word connecting back to the word and started pulling oh I'm gonna start there in the first church day and he's pulled seed all the way through seven church ages until now he's got to this last Church days and you sitting on those pews tonight are the final voice to the final generation you are the culmination of what seven church ages have been it's ride time now it's ride time now it's time to go home it's time to go home the world is falling apart and it's time to go back to where you come from [Applause] you see what it's time to do is for Eagles to spread their wings the rest of that Eagle can go a long time before he recognizes what he is he says when you surrender fully he'll come in fully but until you surrender fully he can't come in fully it's like the lady that had that dream that time she died and then her dream she died and went to heaven and she stood before the Lord and she said Lord why why on earth why was the only thing that you used of my of me was my hands why my hands to cook my hands to help people why was that the only part you used them and he said because that was all you surrendered to me and think about it tonight God wants all of us our mind our ears our eyes our lips everything we are he wants us all to surrender fully to his will he said surrender think of this surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking why do people fight against us all the time why they fight against lubbers why they fight against us because they refused to surrender do what the word said whether profit breach but I'm asking you tonight in the name of the Lord surrender surrender I told somebody the day I said I study awhile and repent a whole lot well I thought it was this way but you're a prophet of God say this and you say Lord I'm wrong I'm sorry it's that way but the hardest thing for many people to say is I was wrong and brother branham taught it right I was wrong on my the other 70 I was rolling all these things and because of that people get complexes and they birth Wars out of their life fighting against that because they refused to surrender to what a prophet already said what's the only way we're going to get victory in this age is to surrender to what the word said the surrender to what brother Branham said because he could tell us the way back Oh hallelujah he could tell us the way back if I've never been to town I'm not gonna try to go on my own I'm gonna ask somebody that's been there and God sort of props for how we come and how we got back and then he come and said this is how you're gonna get back surrender surrender your life surrender your all surrender listen this surrender your prestige think of that surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost that's what he's here to do I love this he's praying since he's already struck two or three here in the building there's more right there he said warning the Holy Ghost just keep believing glory to God either right or wrong he says humbly your own thinking humble your own thinking humble your own thinking why did God bypass scholars and bishops and reveal it to three wise men because they surrendered their thinking humble your own thinking humble your own ways you see God sends no one away empty except those who come for themselves God since not a one of us away empty unless we come full of ourselves and not willing to say get self out of the way I don't care about my this I don't care let me ask you this people say oh I can't go back on something I can't I can't say I was wrong a prophet of God said I was wrong a prophet stood and cried I was wrong I almost made the greatest mistake of my ministry I almost made the Antichrist Christ again I was wrong if a prophet can say that I can scream the top of my voice I'm wrong I'm wrong I want to be burst into the heavenly kingdom I don't care about my reputation I don't care about some ministry I don't care about who's the greatest among us I care about a rapture I care about getting out of here I'm willing to come and say I was wrong God forgive me I surrender my all I surrender mall extend their feet to me god help me to surrender my thinking my thoughts my prestige my agenda all that I am God help me God God help me to surrender Heavenly Father but we were so late in the hour lord father I look out upon the Carnation tonight Lord and I see many faces Lord of people that's fought this battle for years Lord Lord I see my young brothers and my young sisters father Lord standing for this endtime message god lord help us to not discern their Lord Lord maybe there's something we thought we were a ride owner or we thought we'd talked this rider we thought we've done it the right way but Oh God a prophet sent by God with the pillar of fire to show light unto this door caged and revealed to us not only that we were wrong but that he was wrong and he went right back and say I was wrong here but the holy ghost dropped down into the room oh god that's the only way we're gonna change the Lord it won't be about some man preaching it into us it'll be by the Holy Ghost dropping down in the room and changing this Lord Lord I pray for myself tonight dear God Lord I don't want to just be right because Lord I'm a minister because I I study about God I want to be right because that's what your word requires of me Lord Lord your word don't just requires to to be well polished in the clothes and be able to say what the prophets said but Lord your your requirement is to be able to live what that prophet said I mean dog the only way we're going to do that is to surrender to that word on the inside of us God that word that it's pulling us cord that word that is drawing us dear God oh god I can feel the tug tonight dear Lord it's coming from another dimension Lord I can hear him saying press on little bride press on little bride surrender to the word surrender to that word stay with what that prophet talk don't say nothing else and it will bring you home Lord Jesus we need you tonight dear God helpless tonight lord help us tonight God to come to you Lord and say Lord I was wrong I surrender I had a wrong attitude I had a wrong outlook I had a wrong spirit lord I was wrong God I want to be right Oh help us tonight Lord to be as your prophet taught us and spoken words original seed that your example son seed manifested your life and will be this because son of God's seed brings forth son of God's City or god help us to live the kind of life that he lives not a life of argued and fussing and fighting and well I don't believe it the old God no help us to live a life that he could go to that garden and get down on his hands and knees and doesn't crying out and praying God Oh father let this cup pass for me but Lord I'm not gonna be selfish Lord not my will but thy will be done glory to God hallelujah hallelujah old friends whatever it is right now maybe the Lord is pulling at your heart to surrender tonight what would it be would it be a pride spirit would it be prestige would it be oh I don't need the Holy Ghost I can make it on my own I don't need a new birth my parents are so and so my daddy so and so that is a lie you must be born again or what is it to not surrender to him surrender he's passing through here I believe he's here tonight I believe he's walking up and down these aisles tonight I believe he's willing them sons and daughters don't say Lord I don't surrender to the enemy I refuse to surrender to Satan but God why you're pulling in my heart I surrender all that I am to you oh that I am Lord all that I am Lord oh what would it be tonight friends talk to him tonight oh let him letting me we're getting ready to end this year and go into a new year we're fixing that people gonna turn new pages on calendars and start new chapters and books and all but let this be the night that you don't just turn the page but you rip the book out and throw it away and let God begin a surrender through you not that you can walk out and say glory to God I surrender to that no you can say thanks be to God he surrendered through me would it be that flesh that's always trying to fight us and trying to pull us in the wrong direction oh I thank the Lord that he didn't he didn't send this example son down here pull him out of the flesh let him overcome but he let him overcome right through the flesh proving to us that we can walk the same trail we can walk that same trail and we can overcome the same way he did by simply taking the devil right back to the word and saying Satan it is written help us tonight dear god help us tonight Lord Jesus all friends just just just just talk to him for a few moments his brother Harry let me sing something for sis just worshipping for a minute

seen I'll never change old God don't let the day ever be birthed in my life that that would be said of me Lord help me always to have that Holy Spirit inside of me bringing most stubborn rotten flesh submissive to the word to say Lord I will trust you I will trust you friends God is calling to you tonight he's calling out to you and don't worry you say but then I'm afraid to trust the will of God listen to me they're not friends the will of God will never lead you where the grace of God cannot sustain you he left three Hebrew children to the fiery furnace but the grace of God sustained them he

annoying our sisters faith may there be no evil outcome of his Lord but may it be another opportunity about which the Spirit of God can be able to bring deliverance one more time and the lives of your children Lord we don't pray repetitively over these things and asked over and over again because you didn't hear it's the first time but we believe the words of God come through our lips so we're taking that sword and just keep hammering at the devil is it Lord not because if we pray 500 times you'll hear us but we believe if we pray in faith you hear it's the first time but we just keep asking and believing and thanking you for it knowing that you're mindful Lord God we believe you in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you Saints we have him service again in the morning my goodness

what a privilege said under the word of Hey praise the Lord another lot of folks sick a lot of different things that are going on and sister Betty Walter I guess her situation is probably about the same maybe getting a little bit lower each each our blood pressure heart rate this then the other but you know if God's not done with her life she could be laying there and absolutely no life at all in our body but if God's not done the devil ain't won't take her but if the Lord is finished with her then certainly would want to keep her here and certainly in the condition that she's in but let's just pray for her and pray for the family that God would be with them and and strengthen them as well it's going to face each one of us we're gonna go but that open door of death or we're gonna meet it in the rapture whichever it is for the will of God for our lives is exactly what he wants here brother BAM say it and I heard it for years and years ago was the first time it just really amazed me he said whenever God is finished with me in life I'm finished with life so I thought well I guess that's the way it is our purpose is done we've completed it we've fulfilled it and then we're going to that place it's waiting for us but let's just pray for the family and God will be with Simmons strengthen them god bless you saying sorry and shake hands until I tell them it's been good to be in the house of the Lord some Jubilee praise the Lord feel [Music] [Music]
