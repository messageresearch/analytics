[15:24] clap of praise this
[15:26] [Music]

[15:54] be near forever. Thank you, Lord. Cuz
[15:58] I've never been this home sick before.
[16:06] Oh, see the bright light
[16:09] shine. It's just about home
[16:15] time. I can see my father
[16:20] standing at the
[16:23] door. This world's been a
[16:27] wilderness and I'm ready for
[16:32] deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been
[16:37] this home

[16:54] No one's old or nobody feeble or feeble
[16:59] anymore.

[17:05] crying. I feel like I've spread my wings
[17:09] for
[17:10] flying. Cuz I've never been this home
[17:15] sick before.
[17:19] Oh, see the bright light

[18:13] door. This world's been a
[18:18] wilderness and I'm ready for
[18:21] deliverance.
[18:24] Oh Lord, I've never been this whole
[18:32] single. This world is just a wildlife.
[18:41] Oh Lord, I've never in this home seek me
[18:48] before.
[18:53] [Music]
[18:59] Hallelujah. Will be done as our singers
[19:02] come to give us a song this morning.
[19:03] Sister Isabelle, if you'll come and
[19:05] brother Josiah, if you'll come to the
[19:07] platform and we'll enjoy your specials
[19:09] this morning. But let's sing a song this
[19:11] morning. A little chorus we sing quite
[19:13] often around here. It's already done. Do
[19:17] you believe the work is already done? I
[19:20] believe we're just waiting for a body
[19:21] change and we're looking forward to
[19:23] that, aren't we? Let's sing you with all
[19:25] of our heart this morning, if you

[20:14] is over.
[20:17] Victory
[20:18] won. It's
[20:21] already
[20:26] done. It's
[20:28] already
[20:32] done. Yes, it's
[20:35] already
[20:39] done. Oh, our battle is over. Sweet
[20:46] victory
[20:47] one, it's
[20:50] already
[20:55] done. Give our singers a nice hand as
[20:58] you're seated today.
[21:17] [Music]
[21:30] It's not what I prayed for. It's not
[21:34] what I
[21:36] wanted. It's not something I understand.
[21:42] [Music]
[21:44] My
[21:47] circumstances, they seem so
[21:50] confusing. I'm placing it all in your
[21:55] [Music]
[21:57] hands. Your ways are higher than
[22:04] mine. I want mountains to move.
[22:09] You want me to
[22:11] climb, so I'm going to trust your work,
[22:17] your will, and your
[22:22] time. Cuz your ways are higher than
[22:27] mine.
[22:29] [Music]
[22:41] One day I'm sure I will look back and
[22:47] marvel at how you knew best all along.
[22:56] you see from
[22:58] heaven. You know it's the hard times
[23:03] that make my face steady and

[23:10] strong. Your ways are higher than
[23:16] mine. I want mountains to
[23:20] move. You want me to climb.
[23:25] So I'm going to trust your work, your
[23:30] will, and your
[23:35] time.
[23:39] Oh, your
[23:41] ways are so much higher than mine.
[23:50] [Music]
[23:54] Your ways are
[23:56] higher than mine.
[24:01] [Music]
[24:07] [Music]
[24:17] [Applause]
[24:33] God bless you this morning.
[24:41] [Music]

[24:45] song, you can sing it with me this
[24:48] [Music]
[24:59] morning. Let the
[25:01] weak say I am strong.
[25:06] Oh, let the poor say, "I am
[25:12] rich." Let the blind say, "I can

[25:21] Lord has done in me. Oh, let the weak
[25:27] say I am strong.
[25:31] Oh, let the poor say, "I am
[25:36] rich." Oh, let the blind say, "I can

[32:37] amen to
[32:38] [Music]
[32:39] that? Praise the Lord. Praise the
[32:43] Lord. Hallelujah.
[32:47] Thank the Lord for his mercy to us all.
[32:50] We welcome you here today. We have
[32:52] several visitors that are here. Um came
[32:56] for the school graduation which turned
[32:58] out so beautiful yesterday. Want to say
[33:00] how much we appreciate all of the effort
[33:03] and all the work, the students, the
[33:05] parents, the teachers, the faculty and
[33:07] all that that did it. It's imparted a
[33:11] wonderful thing in the lives of these
[33:13] children. We're grateful we would be
[33:14] able to have it here in the mountains of
[33:17] Tennessee to be able to bring all these
[33:19] Yankees and Southerners and Canadians
[33:23] and all
[33:25] together. As I sat yesterday and I heard
[33:29] the different teachers as they was
[33:31] describing their students and this one
[33:35] got a award for that and another one got
[33:37] an award for that.
[33:39] In my mind, every time I go to a
[33:42] graduation, I think what it'll be one
[33:45] day when we all walk before the Lord.
[33:52] I want to be faithful on that day. Don't
[33:54] you? I'm not interested in rewards and
[33:58] payback or nothing like that. If I can
[34:01] just hear these simple, powerful words,
[34:06] well done.
[34:08] effort, success, this. No. No. Just as
[34:13] long as I know that I've pleased him. Is
[34:17] that what you want from your heart?
[34:26] Amen. It's one of the things that I love
[34:29] about him so
[34:30] much is that we unworthy ones, he
[34:34] changes us and helps us. He gives us the
[34:37] strength to do what he calls us to do.
[34:40] And then just like him, when we get
[34:42] there that day, he gives you a reward
[34:46] for doing what he helped you to do.
[34:52] Truly, totally selfless.
[34:55] That's our God. You sisters, you may
[34:59] think you've done nothing, but you may
[35:00] be one of the very ones that out of your
[35:03] home, God will produce a boy, maybe a
[35:07] preacher's wife, a pastor's wife, or
[35:09] something like that that will affect
[35:11] thousands of people. You remember the
[35:13] prophet telling us about the little lady
[35:15] had a burden on her heart to have a
[35:17] meeting and she goes and rents a place
[35:20] and a preacher comes and preaches. God
[35:22] wanted that woman to have a reward.
[35:27] You're worth something today. It's
[35:30] wonderful to be together, isn't it?
[35:32] Praise the Lord. We have brother Michael
[35:34] Ray here with us today and we're so glad
[35:36] to have him with us. And um he don't
[35:39] want to ride on his father's coel or his
[35:42] grandfather's coel, but he's brother
[35:44] Biscll's grandson and brother Tom Ray's
[35:46] son. Um but he has his own identity.
[35:50] He's brother Michael Raid and we're
[35:52] grateful to have him with us and we just
[35:55] want him to come and uh speak to us
[35:57] today. How many come with needs on your
[36:00] hearts? No doubt our needs would be as
[36:04] diverse as the congregation that's
[36:06] gathered here today. So no matter how
[36:09] spiritual we might think we are and how
[36:11] much great mysteries that we understand,
[36:14] I hope that we never forget
[36:18] how to contact the Lord Jesus.
[36:21] There are many many great theologians in
[36:23] the New Testament, but how many of them
[36:26] could stop Jesus in his tracks?
[36:31] That's the kind of believer I want to
[36:32] be.
[36:34] Can we sing together touching Jesus? and
[36:36] we'll just invite brother Michael to
[36:37] come and let's just open our hearts now.
[36:40] Now, God knows what he's studied and the
[36:42] direction that he's studied. But maybe
[36:45] you have a need today that will lay
[36:47] outside the confines of what he's
[36:50] prepared. But keep in mind, the Lord
[36:52] Jesus loves you so much that he'll cause
[36:55] him to veer off of that, maybe for a
[36:58] sentence, a paragraph because you have a
[37:01] need. You believe that? Let's sing it
[37:04] together. A
[37:06] woman tried so
[37:10] many
[37:11] [Music]
[37:15] physicians yet grew
[37:19] worse. So did
[37:21] Jesus she came.
[37:28] And
[37:30] when that
[37:33] crowd tried to restrain
[37:37] [Music]
[37:39] her, she
[37:42] whispered these words,
[37:45] hallelujah, through her pain. Sing it
[37:49] now with me. Oh, touching Jesus.
[37:54] [Music]
[38:00] [Music]
[38:06] will never
[38:08] be the
[38:12] [Music]
[38:13] same. And there's
[38:17] only one
[38:19] way to touch
[38:23] him. Oh, just believe.
[38:26] Just believe when you call
[38:30] on his name one more time now. Oh,
[38:37] touching
[38:39] Jesus. Oh, is
[38:41] all that really
[38:47] matter and your
[38:50] life will never
[38:53] be the same.
[38:59] And there's
[39:02] only one
[39:04] way to touch
[39:07] him. Just
[39:09] believe. Just
[39:12] believe when you call
[39:15] on his
[39:19] name. Amen. You believe that this
[39:22] morning? Amen. and we just call on his
[39:25] name. He's that close. Too many times I
[39:28] think people think he's far off in some
[39:30] distant place, but he's right here
[39:31] present. Right here present. You just
[39:33] need to call. Amen. Isn't that just just
[39:36] what they did as brother Donnie was
[39:37] mentioning in scripture? You just need
[39:38] to speak out. Maybe maybe blind
[39:40] Barnameus. His faith cried out and he
[39:42] was there. Amen. I greet you this
[39:45] morning. It's uh well I'm just going to
[39:47] take it in for a moment and just uh so
[39:50] honored and privileged to be here with
[39:51] you and I've we've of course known of
[39:56] the congregation here in Tennessee for a
[39:58] long long time but to to be here in this
[40:00] capacity is was never in my wildest
[40:03] imaginations but the Lord has a whole
[40:05] different trajectory for our lives and
[40:08] sometimes it takes you on a maybe a 180
[40:12] and uh so here we are and we're just
[40:14] thankful to be
[40:15] sojouring with you today. I greet you
[40:16] from brother Tom indeed and the
[40:18] congregation back home and my grandma
[40:21] sister R brother Ed Bisco. They would be
[40:23] I'd be reminis reminiscent to not uh
[40:26] remiss to not regret you from them. And
[40:28] so we just we're fighting the battle up
[40:31] in Canada. I know there's a few here
[40:32] from Canada. Brother Kyle, Sister
[40:34] Christina, I think I seen brother Ben
[40:36] and Sister Well, Amanda, where are you
[40:39] here? Wave your hand at me. I know
[40:40] you're here. There we are. I knew you
[40:41] there. And then some old friends are
[40:43] here. Sister Heidi and I seen brother
[40:45] Nathan. My goodness, we're just so
[40:47] blessed to be part of the family of God
[40:50] and do thank you for opening the the
[40:52] congregation here and all your help
[40:53] yesterday. You just were a real
[40:55] expression of Christ. That's what was
[40:57] just so beautiful just to see the body
[41:00] just joining together from all ends of
[41:03] the earth. That's just a little taste of
[41:05] heaven. Amen. Because that's what the
[41:07] body is from all over the world. And so
[41:09] we just so thank you and butter Donnie
[41:12] so appreciate you. We haven't maybe had
[41:15] a lot of time together but your life has
[41:16] impacted. We were speaking in the office
[41:18] there and I'm just I can say I've been
[41:21] impacted. I know the other side you'll
[41:23] find out the greater but my life hasn't.
[41:26] I just thank you for your testimony for
[41:28] this gospel message that's been around
[41:31] the world. Amen. You have a you have a
[41:33] precious pastor. We do indeed.
[41:42] So this morning we'll just I'm just uh
[41:45] there's been some giants of this message
[41:48] preachers that have preached from this
[41:51] church and uh and I'm not one of those.
[41:54] So just a little simple word this
[41:57] morning, but you pull because it doesn't
[41:59] really matter. Actually, it's all words.
[42:01] So then it's all simple. And so it
[42:04] doesn't really matter how where and in
[42:06] the depths and such. If it comes from
[42:08] from his word, then it it'll feed our
[42:10] souls this morning. Amen. So we'll just
[42:12] turn to the word and not take any more
[42:16] time. We're turn to Genesis
[42:25] 11. You going to pull this morning for
[42:27] me? Yeah. I do. I'll need it. It's going
[42:29] to take me a moment to settle down.
[42:31] All them
[42:36] butterflies. Genesis
[42:41] 11. We'll start at verse one. And the
[42:43] whole earth was of one language and of
[42:46] one speech. And it came to pass as they
[42:49] journeyed from the east that they found
[42:51] a plain in the land of Shannar, and they
[42:53] dwelt there. And they said to one
[42:55] another, "Go to and let us make brick."
[42:58] And burned them thoroughly. And they had
[42:59] brick for stone and slime had they for
[43:01] mortar. And they said, "Go to and let us
[43:04] build us a city and a tower whose top
[43:07] may reach into the heaven. And let us
[43:09] make us a name lest we be scattered
[43:12] abroad upon the face of the whole
[43:15] earth." If you go back in scripture and
[43:17] even brother Brandham speaks about it,
[43:19] God had actually desired and he had
[43:21] instructed them actually to multiply and
[43:23] replenish the whole earth. and and their
[43:25] objective now was though to be united
[43:27] here underneath their own desire for a
[43:29] name for themselves. And we'll maybe go
[43:31] into some further scripture, but I'll
[43:33] let you sit and take your seats. But
[43:35] before we do that, let's just have a
[43:36] word of prayer.
[43:40] Heavenly
[43:42] Father, Lord, we stand here Lord
[43:44] tonight, this morning and conscious Lord
[43:47] that there is each one that are
[43:49] listening this morning standing here.
[43:52] Each one is a soul that you paid a price
[43:55] at Calvary for each one worth Lord is
[43:59] we've been told worth more than a 10,000
[44:02] worlds. the value that you place in one
[44:07] precious son or daughter here this
[44:09] morning. And Lord, here there's many.
[44:11] And Lord, to stand here, Lord, and to to
[44:14] speak in this capacity, I Lord, I pray
[44:16] there's not a word of my own thought
[44:19] would be expressed, but that the only
[44:20] thoughts would come from the very throne
[44:22] of God this morning, Lord, because
[44:25] that's what will feed a hungry heart,
[44:27] Lord. Maybe somebody here is thirsty and
[44:30] Lord, they need living water like that
[44:31] little woman that sat at the well. Or
[44:33] Lord, maybe somebody is in dire need of
[44:35] some food, some spiritual food in due
[44:37] season. And you alone, oh God, would
[44:39] break the very bread of life to them,
[44:41] Lord. So I pray this morning, Lord, it
[44:43] wouldn't just be a service, but Lord,
[44:45] it' be a time where we can be refreshed
[44:47] and renewed and strengthened and
[44:48] comforted, Lord, brought, Lord, just
[44:50] that little bit closer to your side. and
[44:53] you could Lord come and your presence
[44:55] would draw near and we would leave here
[44:56] Lord never the same again Lord we just
[44:58] don't want to come to a Sunday morning
[45:00] service we want to come to where we can
[45:02] encounter the almighty God and Lord we
[45:04] could our children could know and that
[45:06] you're a living God still the same today
[45:08] Lord not just a God of scripture but if
[45:10] you could raise up out of history as
[45:12] your prophet said and Lord we could just
[45:14] worship together and you'd be pleased
[45:16] Lord to dwell within your praises and
[45:18] within Lord our presence this morning we
[45:20] commit Lord those that would hear and
[45:22] myself that would speak to you in the
[45:24] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[45:27] Amen. You may have your seats this
[45:32] morning. I feel like I'm a little bit uh
[45:35] I need to grow a few inches cuz uh this
[45:38] is definitely high up on me here, but
[45:41] maybe we'll we'll just
[45:43] uh share a little bit from our heart.
[45:45] The scripture there says, as I was
[45:47] saying there, go to let us build a city.
[45:49] And they said, go let us make a name.
[45:51] This was the Tower of Babel. Of course,
[45:52] we'd have heard this in our Sunday
[45:54] school when we were little children. And
[45:56] their objective was to build something
[45:58] that was great, something that was
[46:00] mighty, some accomplishment that they
[46:02] had done themselves, something that they
[46:04] had they had desired to do. If you look
[46:06] at the scripture, it says, "Let us make
[46:08] us a name." They that's their whole
[46:11] desire was somehow to raise themselves
[46:13] up. But God, he had actually had a
[46:15] desire to scatter the people. He wanted
[46:17] the earth to be filled with life. They
[46:19] said, "No, no, no. We we want to make us
[46:21] something. We have our own names sake to
[46:24] be made. We we need to put an image out
[46:26] there of who we are and and what we can
[46:28] do and and what we're made of and what
[46:30] we're about and and how big we are lest
[46:32] lest we be scattered. They didn't want
[46:34] to be scattered. They didn't want that
[46:36] really to to replenish and to let that
[46:39] life force go out upon the earth. They
[46:40] said, "No, we're going to be here and
[46:41] we're going to do something for
[46:42] ourselves." And and today I can imagine,
[46:45] you know, how not much has really
[46:46] changed God's seed is is desires to send
[46:49] forth. But unfortunately through the
[46:51] world today too many are concerned and
[46:53] we live in an age that is very
[46:54] self-centered and and all they care
[46:56] about is really let us let me make an
[46:59] image unto myself. Let me create my own
[47:01] Instagram profile or let me create my my
[47:04] new explatform or or this or that or the
[47:06] other. Let me project what I am and what
[47:08] I can do. Now that spirit hasn't changed
[47:11] since Genesis till now. Amen. And so
[47:14] that continues in scripture. He says,
[47:15] "And the Lord came down to see the city
[47:18] and the tower." So God now has stepped
[47:20] down to see what the children of men had
[47:22] built. And the Lord said, "Behold, the
[47:24] people is one." God recognized that they
[47:27] had come together as one. They were
[47:29] united and they have all one language.
[47:32] And this they begin to do. And now
[47:34] nothing, listen to what what God is is
[47:36] saying here. Now nothing will be
[47:38] restrained from them which they have
[47:40] imagined to do. Anything that is in
[47:43] their heart, anything that's in their
[47:45] imagination, nothing can be restrained.
[47:47] They've united together and they can do
[47:49] anything they desire. Think about that.
[47:51] This is a an observation as the Lord
[47:53] came down. He said, "Go to let us go
[47:56] down." And there confound their language
[47:59] that they may not understand one
[48:01] another's speech. And they at that
[48:03] moment were unified together by their
[48:06] language. This is what gravitated them
[48:08] together. And in a moment that language
[48:10] is is is is what made them one. And in a
[48:13] moment
[48:15] they were no longer one.
[48:18] Amen. Their unity disintegrated. The
[48:20] moment their language was removed. They
[48:22] no longer could communicate to each
[48:24] other. They they couldn't express what
[48:25] was in their imagination. And here now
[48:28] one was speaking this language and
[48:29] another was speaking another. And the
[48:31] unity was broken.
[48:35] And just like that, they were suddenly
[48:37] separated. And what had united them was
[48:40] was not of a of a heavenly nature. I
[48:42] could say it was of a natural ability
[48:44] that they had within their human human
[48:46] uh being and to to project their own
[48:48] aims. And the scripture continues. So
[48:50] the Lord scattered them abroad and from
[48:53] fence upon the face of all the earth and
[48:55] they left off to build the city.
[48:57] Therefore the name is the name of it
[48:59] called Babel because the Lord did there
[49:01] confound the language of all the earth
[49:04] and from then did the Lord scatter them
[49:05] abroad upon the face of the earth and so
[49:09] here we see the the beginnings of in
[49:11] Genesis as the people now scattered
[49:13] broken and separated and I'll just point
[49:15] and I'll maybe just read the scripture
[49:17] in John 17 and 10 Jesus saying and all
[49:20] mine are thine and thine are mine and I
[49:23] am glorified in them and now I am no
[49:26] more in the world, but these are in the
[49:28] world. And I come to thee, holy father,
[49:31] keep through keep through thine own name
[49:33] those whom thou hast given me. Jesus is
[49:35] praying that they may be one as we are.
[49:42] God had a desire for unity. He had a
[49:45] desire for union that they may be one as
[49:49] we are. And so I want to take up just a
[49:51] little thought this morning and maybe if
[49:53] I could title
[49:56] it unified by our identity or united by
[49:59] our identity and unity is is is
[50:02] something that uh people can come
[50:04] together in a moment to find a common
[50:06] ground. It's it's when people can can
[50:09] find maybe a common cause and it can be
[50:11] as small or as great as as one can
[50:14] imagine. You know some people unite on
[50:16] soggy Rice Krispies. Brother Kyle, as I
[50:18] heard yesterday, you know, you know, you
[50:20] find someone that has a common like as
[50:22] you like and suddenly you're best
[50:24] buddies and uh because you know, you
[50:26] have this interest or a hobby that you
[50:28] find common ground on or or you unite.
[50:31] Many of course countries have united to
[50:33] conquer and and they've come together
[50:35] because they they desire for their for
[50:37] for unification. I would say the world
[50:40] longs for unity. They really do. It's
[50:43] why everyone is so inclusive today. You
[50:45] know, they're trying to come up with
[50:46] some way to bring a unification of the
[50:49] world in some way, but it's a perverted
[50:51] way. But it's something they thirst for.
[50:54] They thirst for unity, something inside
[50:56] of them, cuz at the beginning there was,
[50:58] then they were broken up because they
[51:00] had a perverted desire. But God desires
[51:03] unity. That's his heart. And so, man, it
[51:06] has it built in. And so, there's a
[51:08] incredible power that can come with that
[51:10] as we see in the in the scripture that
[51:12] they had, they were not restrained. And
[51:14] so man seeks it because they know with
[51:16] unity there is indeed power. There's an
[51:18] ability and and if I could just maybe
[51:20] drop in a little uh anecdotal piece of a
[51:23] factual piece of nature for you that
[51:25] could maybe uh bring this out. There's
[51:28] uh there's a Japanese honeybee in Japan
[51:31] and uh there's also a Japanese hornet in
[51:35] Japan. And so these two uh live in the
[51:37] same world in the same area but the
[51:39] hornet is actually the largest in the
[51:41] world. It is two almost has 2 in or so
[51:44] long. It's got a quarter inch stinger
[51:46] and it's got a wingspan of about 3 in.
[51:49] You they're they're big. They're they're
[51:51] monsters and they pack a wallup of
[51:53] wallops of a sting. Not that I've ever
[51:56] had one, but I can imagine. And so these
[51:58] hornets are so large they can actually
[52:00] take on 10,000 count honeybee hive. If
[52:04] there's 10,000 or so bees in a in a hive
[52:06] of a honeybee, they only a dozen or so
[52:09] of these hornets can wipe them all out.
[52:11] quite immediately. They go in there with
[52:12] their with their pinchers and and just
[52:14] tear them apart. And you real you'll
[52:17] notice that an American and and a hybrid
[52:20] and import um honeybees actually cannot
[52:22] stand against these hornets. But the
[52:24] native Japanese honeybee have figured
[52:26] out how to deal with them. And so these
[52:29] hornets will send in a scout and they'll
[52:31] send in it to try and find where the
[52:33] honeybee is. And they'll come into their
[52:35] into their uh into their hive. And the
[52:36] the honeybees will not do nothing until
[52:39] until that hornet touches one of the
[52:44] honeybees. They they kind of let let it
[52:47] be. But the moment it takes and starts
[52:49] to attack one bee, the bee after bee now
[52:52] in the hive start to conglomerate on
[52:55] this hornet and they create what they
[52:57] call a beeball on this hornet and they
[52:59] just continue to grow grow grow and grow
[53:01] until they completely surround in
[53:03] unified force against this hornet as
[53:06] he's tried to come in invade their
[53:08] territory. But they find here's an
[53:10] attacker. And so they come and they they
[53:11] create a a whole ball around him and
[53:13] they surround him and intensify the heat
[53:16] around him and they raise the heat just
[53:21] um not even a degree above what that
[53:23] hornet can handle and they kill him.
[53:27] They have figured out the strength of
[53:29] unity.
[53:31] They figured it out. Nature figured it
[53:33] out. If a bee can figure it out, surely
[53:37] surely man, surely God's people, we can
[53:40] understand God's desiring to unify with
[53:43] his people. Amen. And so all other
[53:45] ground, as we know, the scripture is
[53:46] sinking sand. And and and if if it isn't
[53:49] Christ, if it isn't the word, at some
[53:51] point, whatever you're founded on,
[53:52] whatever you're unified on will crumble.
[53:55] That's just the the bare facts of it.
[53:57] Balum, we see that happen. Kora unified
[54:00] people. They they they they they brought
[54:02] people together, but their unity I could
[54:04] say the unity in itself isn't
[54:06] necessarily the key, but what they were
[54:08] unified on was the problem. So whatever
[54:11] you're unified on is the key to unity.
[54:14] That's really where where it counts. And
[54:16] so some, you know, have unions and are
[54:19] teetering on a fine edge because indeed
[54:21] it's just a whisper away from fracturing
[54:23] their foundations. We've seen conquerors
[54:25] over time try and do that and bring
[54:27] certain things together for their own
[54:29] desires. But human unity is fragile.
[54:32] It's fickle and it's finite.
[54:35] It is. And if you don't know what fickle
[54:37] means, it's an older word. It's changing
[54:39] frequently, especially in regards to
[54:41] one's loyalties, interests, and
[54:43] affections. So, humans unity, if it's on
[54:46] a humanistic aspect, it's sitting there
[54:48] and it's really only based on some
[54:50] interests and affections. And we know
[54:52] that interests change. You grow. And we
[54:54] know interests change as we heard at the
[54:56] grad yesterday. And so humans change and
[54:58] they can get into a problem when they
[55:00] unify on some humanistic aspect. And if
[55:04] we go into scripture just as a a bit of
[55:06] a foundation or or sometimes I find
[55:09] myself going I go down the uh you know
[55:11] kind of go down the negative road to
[55:13] show the positive. And uh so I'll just
[55:15] I'll just going to go down there a
[55:16] little bit. Help me. And then we'll jump
[55:17] back on the other side. Is that okay?
[55:19] The law of contrast is sometimes an easy
[55:22] lesson. Yeah.
[55:25] Jehoshaphat in the scripture,
[55:28] he gets approached by Ahab. And Ahab
[55:30] says, "Hey, Jehoshaphat, we've got land
[55:33] to take. There's our God-given
[55:36] possession. You know, this is a good,
[55:38] you know, a good idea. We we should go
[55:39] and take our land. Would you come and
[55:41] and join with me, please? You know, your
[55:44] armies and your chariots and and your
[55:45] horses and let us all be one,
[55:47] Jehoshaphat." And so Ahab had a desire,
[55:50] but his desire, I don't really think,
[55:52] was to to possess what God had given
[55:54] him. Ahab's desire was not quite
[55:56] founded, I don't think, on really the
[55:58] real foundation. Then Jehoshaphat, you
[56:01] know, he was seeing through he wasn't
[56:02] really seeing through it all completely
[56:04] because he was getting drawn
[56:07] into, well, that sounds like maybe a
[56:10] good idea. I mean, what he's saying is
[56:11] is not too terrible, but you got to be
[56:13] very careful what you listen to and what
[56:15] you get caught up with because it's very
[56:18] subtle how that drawing into, hey, be
[56:20] part of what I what we are and you're
[56:22] like, well, you're trying to discern and
[56:24] got tripped up sounding the the idea
[56:27] sounded pretty good. It it sounded
[56:29] right. Well, yeah, that is our land. You
[56:31] know, we should we should go out there.
[56:33] But if you don't be careful, unity on
[56:35] the wrong basis can get you in deep deep
[56:38] trouble. deep trouble. Jehosh
[56:40] jehoshaphat knew and I I just wonder you
[56:43] know Ahab had been prophesied to die.
[56:45] Elijah had already prophesied that the
[56:47] dogs would lick his blood blood and here
[56:49] Jehoshaphat was in this position and
[56:51] Ahab worked on him. Brother Brandham
[56:53] said he was a borderline believer a
[56:54] lukewarm halfbaked so-called believer.
[56:57] That's that's brother Brandham. He was a
[56:59] pretty good fellow. He repented many
[57:01] times. Brother Brandham said he was
[57:02] caught up in the things of the world but
[57:04] was it was he had enough to believe some
[57:06] scripture. you know, let's claim some
[57:08] land. And so, you know, there was
[57:10] enough. He looked good enough. Or maybe
[57:12] he came to church often or somebody, you
[57:14] know, it's like, yeah, he's a pretty
[57:15] good believer, but he was not all the
[57:17] way. But Abraham said, a pretty good
[57:18] fellow and he was repented times, but
[57:21] he's lukewarm, halfaked, and so-called.
[57:23] So, here was Ahab, and he calls for
[57:25] Jehoshaphat to make an alliance or a
[57:28] union and unite. But Abraham says,
[57:31] Jehoshaphat was invited down to visit
[57:33] Ahab. Ahab showed him all his all the
[57:35] fiery that that that Israel had. And
[57:38] that's when a believer can get into the
[57:40] wrong company. When Jehoshaphat went
[57:42] down to fellowship with Ahab, he got in
[57:44] the wrong pew. He got in the wrong pew.
[57:47] Somehow he got he came to church or
[57:49] something like that. He got in the wrong
[57:50] pew with Ahab. And Ahab started to talk
[57:52] to him, but it wasn't of the right
[57:54] origin. The unity wasn't coming from the
[57:56] right channel. And he started to poke at
[57:58] at Jehoshaphat. I don't know how long he
[58:00] he tried to poke him, but he did for
[58:01] long enough. And Joseph started to lean
[58:04] in. He says, "Now," but the Ram says,
[58:05] "Now, there's so many times that people
[58:07] can do that with good intentions, people
[58:09] don't mean to do wrong, but they can get
[58:12] caught up with what sounds good. It's a
[58:15] real issue, but they don't see the
[58:17] spirit behind it.
[58:20] And then they don't consult God and what
[58:23] about it and what they and what they
[58:24] should be doing." And Abraham says on at
[58:26] one time then when a believer got in the
[58:28] wrong company, he says, "We have that
[58:29] all the time. A believer by the name of
[58:31] Jehoshaphat got on the wrong company.
[58:33] And when a makebeliever and a believer
[58:35] get together, you got trouble. So we had
[58:38] trouble here. And so Jehoshaphat not
[58:40] realizing it unites with Ahab and he
[58:43] becomes part of Ahab's cause. You don't
[58:47] realize what you actually join yourself
[58:49] to. When you you unite with somebody,
[58:51] you realize you're actually united with
[58:53] everything that they are. You've united
[58:55] with their whole cause. You've
[58:56] identified with everything that they
[58:58] are. Willie, whether you like to or not,
[59:00] you have because you've you've saddled
[59:02] yourself up beside them. And so now his
[59:05] problems is your problems. His worries
[59:07] are your worries. His beliefs almost
[59:09] look like your beliefs. You're like,
[59:10] "Well, no." But no, you've identified
[59:11] with that. You got to be careful. See
[59:14] through it, please, brothers and
[59:16] sisters. We can look at the scripture,
[59:17] but we're living in a day and age where
[59:19] the Satan is so subtle, trying to unite,
[59:21] trying to get you off the word just a
[59:23] little bit. unite with something that's
[59:25] just twisted just a little. It looks
[59:27] pretty good. But it's of death because
[59:29] it's hybrid.
[59:31] And a hybrid religion, a hybrid word is
[59:33] death all the way through. And
[59:35] Jehoshaphat needed to see through it.
[59:37] And here he gets right now mixed up with
[59:39] Ahab. He's assumed now all Ahab's
[59:42] problems. Ahab's enemies were now
[59:44] Jehoshaphat's enemies. Think about it.
[59:47] Jehoshaphat wasn't fighting them people
[59:48] before, but now he's with Ahab. I got to
[59:50] fight with him. Well, you know, let's
[59:52] go. You've saddled up now. Now here we
[59:54] roll. And so Jehoshaphat now is
[59:56] associated. He has to accept the things
[59:58] that he normally maybe wouldn't do.
[1:00:01] Ahab might come with his whole strategy
[1:00:03] and say, "Hey, this is what I think we
[1:00:05] should do here. We should move our
[1:00:06] armies this way." And Josh's like,
[1:00:07] "Yeah, I don't know. That's that's a
[1:00:09] terrible idea. I I really don't like
[1:00:10] that. You know, actually, Jehoshaphat,
[1:00:12] I'm going to disguise myself and you're
[1:00:14] going to go like looking like kings."
[1:00:17] Uh, that really puts me at a
[1:00:19] disadvantage, doesn't it? No, I think
[1:00:21] that's a really good idea, Jehoshaphat.
[1:00:22] You look all you you dress in your
[1:00:24] kingly robes. I'm going to disguise
[1:00:25] myself so they don't know what I look
[1:00:26] like. Yeah. Well, so then I'm the
[1:00:29] target. Well, I don't agree with that,
[1:00:31] Ahab. Tough luck. You You join with me.
[1:00:34] I call the shots now. Jehoshaphat, wait
[1:00:36] a second. Isn't this a 50/50? No, no,
[1:00:39] no, no, no. I'm I'm running this army.
[1:00:41] I'm running this battle. And suddenly,
[1:00:43] Jehoshaphat realized he sucked into more
[1:00:45] than he bargained for.
[1:00:50] You got to watch what you unify with cuz
[1:00:52] you might get sucked into more than you
[1:00:53] bargain for. And so Jehoshaphat now is
[1:00:56] is gets here. And he comes to pass when
[1:00:58] the captains of the chariot saw
[1:01:00] Jehoshaphat that they said surely look
[1:01:02] at this now. Now if I go back
[1:01:05] Jehoshaphat did have a little bit there.
[1:01:06] I don't want to skip too far but I'm I'm
[1:01:08] racing against the clock. Of course he
[1:01:10] called for Micaiah. We know that he
[1:01:12] called for the prophet and they he said
[1:01:13] you know they everybody was saying you
[1:01:15] can go. It's good to go. And Jos said,
[1:01:17] "I I'd like to hear from a a prophet,
[1:01:20] please." And so he he his heart was
[1:01:22] stirring. Something's a little off here.
[1:01:24] Something's a little wrong. I need to We
[1:01:25] need to go back to the word. I just
[1:01:27] don't I just don't quite see this lining
[1:01:28] up. I need to go back to the true word.
[1:01:30] I need to get into the message myself. I
[1:01:32] need to hear from the word of the hour.
[1:01:36] Give me a prophet that's true. I don't
[1:01:39] like him. I don't like what he says. He
[1:01:41] kind of preaches against me, but it's
[1:01:43] true word. I know it's too tough. I got
[1:01:45] to hear it. Sometimes it tells me I
[1:01:46] can't do this. I shouldn't do that. Ah,
[1:01:48] grace against me. Come on, Ahab. I want
[1:01:50] to hear the truth.
[1:01:53] Something in Jehoshaphat rang out cuz a
[1:01:57] seed inside was just grading against it.
[1:02:00] It got sucked in, but he was grading.
[1:02:03] Amen. So they go forth into battle and
[1:02:08] surely it came to pass when the captains
[1:02:09] of the chariot saw the Jehoshaphat that
[1:02:12] they said surely it is the king of
[1:02:15] Israel. Yeah I can bet you Jehoshaphat
[1:02:18] said see I told you Ahab. Thanks a lot.
[1:02:20] It's like well you
[1:02:22] unified. And so he's there in his
[1:02:24] chariot and he says and and they turned
[1:02:26] aside to fight against him. So now it's
[1:02:29] like Jehoshaphat suddenly the target and
[1:02:31] the scripture says he cried out.
[1:02:35] Jehoshaphat came to a point where he was
[1:02:37] not willing to take the hit for Ahab any
[1:02:40] longer. He came to the point where he's
[1:02:42] like, "Forget it. I'm not willing to go
[1:02:43] down this road any longer. I It's not
[1:02:45] true. It's I'm not falling. It's it's
[1:02:47] off a little bit and I'm willing to I
[1:02:49] need to cry out, oh God, take me. Save
[1:02:52] me from this."
[1:02:55] Nothing mattered anymore because now it
[1:02:57] was Jehoshaphat's life on the line. You
[1:02:59] come to a point where you realize my
[1:03:00] family's gone this way. My life has gone
[1:03:02] this way. I've gone off the edge to be
[1:03:04] an edge. I' I've unified with things of
[1:03:06] the world and I'm done with it. Oh God,
[1:03:08] I'm crying out this morning because I
[1:03:11] need to come back to the word.
[1:03:17] You should have never been there in the
[1:03:19] first place. Amen. And I wonder how many
[1:03:22] believers are getting in
[1:03:23] trouble in times and they may even be in
[1:03:26] a battle and it looks like everything is
[1:03:29] against them and they get because they
[1:03:31] get caught in the wrong union as
[1:03:33] Jehoshaphat did and they don't realize
[1:03:35] that the battleground around them is
[1:03:36] actually really the cause of a wrong
[1:03:40] alliance and mistakes they've made,
[1:03:43] trials they've had actually the trials
[1:03:45] that Jehoshaphat was going through is
[1:03:47] because it was his choice. He made a
[1:03:49] wrong choice. We've all made wrong
[1:03:51] choices. I've made wrong choices.
[1:03:56] But you know what the difference
[1:03:59] is? Jehoshaphat was willing to do
[1:04:05] something.
[1:04:07] Jehoshaphat cried out.
[1:04:12] Jehoshaphat did something. He didn't
[1:04:14] hunker down in his idea. Well, this just
[1:04:17] is what it is. and and and and and
[1:04:19] that's too much pride. You mean I got to
[1:04:20] humble myself and I got to make this
[1:04:22] right here. I got to do that or I got to
[1:04:23] walk back and I got to go talk to the
[1:04:25] pastor and and tell him, you know, I was
[1:04:26] wrong here. I shouldn't have never done
[1:04:27] that. You know, no.
[1:04:30] Jehoshaphat humbled himself. Yeah. He
[1:04:33] was a king, but he humbled himself. And
[1:04:36] the scripture says he cried
[1:04:41] out. But if you go into second
[1:04:43] Coronicles, it goes even a little
[1:04:44] further than just
[1:04:46] that. cuz if you leave it there, it
[1:04:48] cried out. He's like, "Well, what what
[1:04:50] happened?" But 2 Chronicles 18:31 says,
[1:04:53] "And it came to pass when the captain
[1:04:55] saw Jehoshaphat, and they turned there,
[1:04:56] and the compass about him to fight, but
[1:04:58] Jehoshaphat cried out." And it continues
[1:05:01] on, and it says, "And the Lord helped
[1:05:04] him, and God moved them to depart from
[1:05:07] him." If you cry out, don't hunker down
[1:05:10] just because you've got maybe stuck in
[1:05:12] some sort of unification with something
[1:05:14] that you know is wrong. cry out. And the
[1:05:17] Lord helped him. The Lord stepped on the
[1:05:19] scene. The Lord says, "I see you. I know
[1:05:21] you maybe made a bad choice. That's
[1:05:23] okay. I'm still here. You're still mine.
[1:05:26] You're still my seed. Just cry out.
[1:05:29] Don't get all condemned and oh, down and
[1:05:32] the devil pound on you. Yeah. No one's
[1:05:33] going to accept you anymore. No one's
[1:05:35] going to even want to talk to you
[1:05:36] anymore. You should be ashamed of
[1:05:38] yourself. You just go in your little
[1:05:39] hole and hunker down until the end of
[1:05:41] time." No. cry out and say, "Oh God,
[1:05:44] restore unto me the joy of my
[1:05:46] salvation."
[1:05:48] And your scripture says, "And the Lord
[1:05:51] helped him. And if he helped
[1:05:52] Jehoshaphat, if he's the same yesterday,
[1:05:55] today, and forever, I can tell you if
[1:05:57] you cry like Barnameus, if you cry like
[1:06:00] the woman in the in the well, or anybody
[1:06:02] in scripture, he will help you."
[1:06:06] Sometimes we just don't cry.
[1:06:11] Don't get sucked in to some alliance
[1:06:13] with some union with something of the
[1:06:15] enemy and stay there. Not a moment
[1:06:18] longer.
[1:06:20] Jehoshaphat's there for you.
[1:06:25] Cuz a trail of of a wrong
[1:06:30] union. When you
[1:06:33] unite, you create a
[1:06:35] covenant. A union is a covenant.
[1:06:39] You know, when someone makes a covenant,
[1:06:42] it does more than just bring people
[1:06:45] together. They when you enter into an
[1:06:47] alliance or a covenant or a union, it's
[1:06:50] it's something more. You're joining at a
[1:06:52] layer much deeper than hey, hey buddy,
[1:06:54] how's it going? Yeah. Hey, great. Great.
[1:06:55] Having a good day. See you later. That
[1:06:57] that's that's not a union. When you
[1:06:58] unite, it's you're becoming one.
[1:07:05] Scripture in Exodus 34 says, "Observe
[1:07:07] that thou which I commanded thee in this
[1:07:09] day. Behold, I drive out before thee the
[1:07:11] Amorite, and the Canaanite, the
[1:07:12] Hitittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite,
[1:07:14] and the Jebusite." This is God speaking,
[1:07:17] "Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a
[1:07:22] covenant with the inhabitants of the
[1:07:25] land, whether thou goest, lest it be for
[1:07:28] a snare in the midst of thee." God is
[1:07:31] warning, don't unite. Don't make an
[1:07:33] agreement. Don't make an alliance with
[1:07:36] the inhabitants of the land. He says,
[1:07:38] "But
[1:07:39] ye shall destroy their altars, break
[1:07:42] their images, cut down their groves, for
[1:07:45] thou shalt worship no other god, for the
[1:07:47] Lord whose name is jealous."
[1:07:53] That's a strong scripture. Why is his
[1:07:56] name jealous? He said, "Really?" Because
[1:07:59] we we often have a a negative
[1:08:01] connotation to jealous ether jealousy or
[1:08:04] or someone has a that's a it's a
[1:08:06] negative word in our mind jealousy. But
[1:08:07] God has actually said his name is
[1:08:10] jealous because God when he would when
[1:08:12] he identifies in scripture and if we go
[1:08:15] to verse 15 he says lest they'll make a
[1:08:17] covenant with the inhabitants of the
[1:08:19] land and they go a whoring after their
[1:08:22] gods. God always, if you see often in
[1:08:25] scripture, when they start to go and
[1:08:27] unite with idol worship, he relates it
[1:08:30] to whoring. He relates it to a union, a
[1:08:33] false perverted union with a perverted
[1:08:36] life that comes out of it. And so God's
[1:08:38] saying, "I'm jealous over you. I desire
[1:08:42] unity with you." It's a jealousy of a
[1:08:45] husband for a wife that someone is
[1:08:46] trying to make approaches and he's
[1:08:49] jealous over you and he says don't you
[1:08:51] dare go a whoring after another god.
[1:08:54] Don't you dare unite with something
[1:08:56] that's perverted because out of that
[1:08:58] union produces perverted life.
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:04] You and I have been trained to believe
[1:09:06] that God's heart is a heart of love
[1:09:09] because we have a fuzzy self-centered
[1:09:11] possessive desire. this kind of
[1:09:13] definition of love. We we tend to
[1:09:14] imagine that God's just always
[1:09:16] forgiving, which he is, but generous and
[1:09:18] kind and overlooks his children's
[1:09:20] mistakes and rebellions and holds his
[1:09:22] breath until eventually stop acting like
[1:09:24] we are and return to his care. But we
[1:09:27] don't realize that God's a jealous God.
[1:09:30] Do not care. He God cares for you. He
[1:09:32] desires your unity. He desires your
[1:09:34] relationship and he's fervent for it.
[1:09:37] And so he's passionate in scripture. He
[1:09:38] says, "Don't go a whoring. Don't make a
[1:09:41] relationship with another idol. And
[1:09:42] that's in that's in Israel. But what
[1:09:44] about today?
[1:09:47] What about today? God's just as
[1:09:49] passionate about our spiritual walk.
[1:09:51] Just as passionate about our natural
[1:09:53] desires. If we place anything above him,
[1:09:56] it's an idol. It could be an interest.
[1:09:59] It could be a desire. It could be a
[1:10:00] sports. I don't really care what it is.
[1:10:02] But if it's above him, you are going a
[1:10:04] whoring after it. And he's saying, "I'm
[1:10:06] jealous over you. I desire a union with
[1:10:08] you. Kill it. Knock it down. Kill the
[1:10:11] idol. Break the statue. I just want you
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:21] cuz idolatry was always connected with a
[1:10:24] wrong union.
[1:10:29] It relates to a marriage union.
[1:10:32] The worship of another God was viewed as
[1:10:36] entering in to a perverted
[1:10:39] relationship. And God hated it. He hated
[1:10:43] it. And he's jealous. My name is
[1:10:46] jealous. Because a union is actually the
[1:10:49] passing of life. It's the transition or
[1:10:52] the transferring of life from a man to a
[1:10:54] woman. And idolatry as a union was
[1:10:57] passing perverted seed which brought
[1:10:59] forth perverted life. And Israel was
[1:11:03] forgetting that they have been called,
[1:11:06] as we go through the different
[1:11:06] scriptures, Israel been called to be a
[1:11:08] separate people, a peculiar nation, not
[1:11:12] to be united with any other. We know
[1:11:16] this. Anything before God was an
[1:11:22] idol. You know, it always starts small
[1:11:25] though. It's not really a big deal. It's
[1:11:28] a little harmless, especially in this
[1:11:30] age. We have to tolerate so much or they
[1:11:33] try to tell us we have to tolerate so
[1:11:34] much. We don't have to tolerate nothing.
[1:11:37] You don't have to you don't have to
[1:11:38] succumb to anything. Hollywood pushes
[1:11:40] its way in your face. Politics push it
[1:11:42] way in your face. Music, fashion, I
[1:11:43] don't really care what it is. Your
[1:11:44] culture, social culture, I don't really
[1:11:46] care what it is. It pushes change in
[1:11:48] your face. You have to accept it. You
[1:11:50] have to believe it. You just have to
[1:11:52] tolerate this. I don't tolerate nothing
[1:11:54] that is beyond this right here. If it
[1:11:56] isn't on the word, if it doesn't align
[1:11:58] with that, I will not unite with your
[1:12:00] idea because I will not accept your
[1:12:02] battle. I will not accept your redeem
[1:12:04] all the the the consequences of it. I
[1:12:07] unite with the word and the word alone.
[1:12:09] That's more prevalent in this age than
[1:12:10] any age. Never. Never just take a step
[1:12:13] as Jehoshaphat did. Well, it's all
[1:12:16] right. Maybe I should. You shouldn't.
[1:12:18] Stay right here. Stay right here.
[1:12:21] Amen.
[1:12:25] Often people leave this
[1:12:29] message and often they become more
[1:12:33] spiritual.
[1:12:36] And it has this
[1:12:39] perception, why we've never had it
[1:12:40] better. You just give it time. You just
[1:12:44] give it time. And you find out because
[1:12:46] it takes time for a little seed to grow.
[1:12:50] and you just don't move and you just
[1:12:53] watch the life and you watch the life
[1:12:55] and then you just wait and you watch
[1:12:57] that life. It'll either be true if it's
[1:12:59] on there. If it's not, it'll be deformed
[1:13:03] and perverted and in time anyone that I
[1:13:06] know
[1:13:10] don't get sucked into the very
[1:13:12] tendencies of the beginnings. Oh, it
[1:13:15] looks pretty good. It isn't good. You
[1:13:16] just watch it. Amen. Amen. Israel got
[1:13:21] confused on their identity of really who
[1:13:22] they were. They had gotten Balam had
[1:13:25] tried to suck them in and they'd created
[1:13:27] some unions and such and you know I can
[1:13:29] imagine you know Balam and the Amorites
[1:13:31] and the Moabites you know the Moabites
[1:13:33] trying to tell them that they were the
[1:13:34] same. And if you take a step back and
[1:13:36] realize that the Moabites in Israel had
[1:13:38] nothing in common in their identity of
[1:13:40] who they were and Israel should have
[1:13:42] taken a step back and and said wait a
[1:13:44] second where do I come from? Where is my
[1:13:47] identity? Because Moab would have had to
[1:13:49] go back and put their identity in a in a
[1:13:52] perverted relationship with Lot. Israel
[1:13:54] would go back to their identity and say,
[1:13:56] "Wait a second. I come from the lineage
[1:13:58] of Abraham. I come the lineage of father
[1:14:00] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. That's
[1:14:02] where I come from. And you're telling me
[1:14:04] I'm the same as you and you come out of
[1:14:06] Lock B. That's not what I'm identified
[1:14:08] with." They should have taken that step
[1:14:10] back and realized there was nothing the
[1:14:12] same with their identity and where they
[1:14:14] came from. That's good. My identity is
[1:14:16] in the covenant that Jehovah made with
[1:14:17] my father Abraham. We're a chosen
[1:14:19] people. We're a holy nation. We're
[1:14:21] peculiar people. That's what they should
[1:14:23] have been saying. No, we're the same. We
[1:14:26] worships very similar. No, you don't. I
[1:14:28] worship the true and living God. And I
[1:14:30] just can tell you just by looking at
[1:14:32] everything around, we're not the same.
[1:14:37] But it just takes even just
[1:14:39] one. And I haven't I'm sure I really
[1:14:43] want to
[1:14:45] long I'm going to book an appointment
[1:14:46] with Caleb in scripture. And so I have
[1:14:49] many million years reserved with him. So
[1:14:52] you'll have to take a second seat after
[1:14:54] me cuz he's one of my favorite of
[1:14:55] scripture. And he's he knew his lineage.
[1:14:59] You know, he I I I note in scripture,
[1:15:02] note his verbiage. Note his
[1:15:04] words. He spoke in Numbers 13 and 30.
[1:15:08] And Caleb stealed the people before
[1:15:10] Moses. You know the scripture. And he
[1:15:12] said, "Let us go up at once and possess
[1:15:15] it."
[1:15:17] He said a certain word in scripture.
[1:15:20] It's let's possess it. Because if we can
[1:15:22] go back, he can track his identity back
[1:15:26] to his father Abraham who said in
[1:15:28] Genesis when the angel of the Lord came
[1:15:30] to Abraham the second time and he said,
[1:15:32] "By myself have I sworn, sayeth the
[1:15:34] Lord, because thou hast done this thing
[1:15:35] and has not withheld thy son, thine only
[1:15:38] son, that in blessing I will bless thee.
[1:15:40] Multiplying I'll multiply. Thy seed is
[1:15:41] the stars of heaven and the sand which
[1:15:43] is upon the seashore and thy seed shall
[1:15:46] possess the gates of the enemy." That's
[1:15:49] what Caleb was reaching back and saying,
[1:15:51] "That's what I'm uniting with. That's
[1:15:53] where I come from. We can possess it
[1:15:56] because the promise is there." Moab
[1:15:58] couldn't go back to that. Yes, sir.
[1:16:02] Good. I wonder about the spiritual
[1:16:05] seed of Abraham, the royal seed. Can we
[1:16:08] get caught like maybe and cry out maybe
[1:16:11] like Jehoshaphat? We sometimes we can
[1:16:14] get confused on our identity and oh
[1:16:15] maybe slip into that but because we
[1:16:17] didn't come from a harlot mother. We
[1:16:19] didn't come from some denominational
[1:16:21] system that says well we just kind of
[1:16:23] look the same. We can worship the same.
[1:16:25] No we cannot. We have a word of the
[1:16:26] hour. I can go back to where the source
[1:16:29] came from. That my identity is straight
[1:16:31] from the word of the lord. Not from some
[1:16:33] system not from some unification that we
[1:16:35] see going on today. We're not unified
[1:16:38] with that. We are unified with the word
[1:16:39] of this hour.
[1:16:46] My eternity doesn't my my identity
[1:16:49] doesn't go back to some nice council
[1:16:50] 325.
[1:16:53] I ain't going to some celebration 1700.
[1:16:55] That's not where I came from. I came
[1:16:57] from eternity and I go back to eternity.
[1:17:00] I don't have an origination here on this
[1:17:02] earth. I come from the eternal seed of
[1:17:04] God.
[1:17:08] Oh glory. Thank you. It's important to
[1:17:12] recognize your
[1:17:15] nationality. I realize I'm speaking in
[1:17:19] America. I do realize
[1:17:22] that, which should be a plus because
[1:17:24] then you really, really get
[1:17:26] it. But, you know, that's why the
[1:17:28] Olympics is a big deal because everybody
[1:17:32] rallies around their nationality. Yeah.
[1:17:35] You could be living in America, but your
[1:17:38] roots go from Sweden. Well, I wonder who
[1:17:43] are you cheering for suddenly. Well, you
[1:17:46] know, it's Swedes that I'm cheering for.
[1:17:49] Or maybe it's Norway or maybe it's China
[1:17:51] or wherever it is. But somehow something
[1:17:53] greater than maybe just your habitation
[1:17:55] takes effect. Maybe where I'm planted
[1:17:58] don't matter no longer, but where I came
[1:18:00] from suddenly has a very powerful pull.
[1:18:05] And so they cheer. They Yeah. Go
[1:18:09] Norway. Well, you're red, white, and
[1:18:11] blue. Well, yeah, I know, but actually I
[1:18:13] come from Norway. Who knew? Every four
[1:18:17] years you find
[1:18:21] out. And suddenly it conjures up a level
[1:18:26] of unity you never see in other aspects.
[1:18:30] Way beyond the Rice Krispies, but a cow.
[1:18:32] It goes somewhere deeper.
[1:18:36] Brother Brandham says, "Let me take it a
[1:18:38] little
[1:18:39] further. The scriptures is what tells
[1:18:42] you what you
[1:18:44] are." And I wonder what could really
[1:18:48] happen or I should say what is
[1:18:51] happening when the church of the living
[1:18:54] God starts to recognize
[1:18:57] my nationality.
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:01] Hey, where you really came from. It
[1:19:04] isn't a red, white, and blue banner. It
[1:19:06] isn't a red maple leaf. It isn't nothing
[1:19:07] to do with that. I come from another
[1:19:09] country. And when we can come to that
[1:19:11] recognition, the unity is at another
[1:19:14] level.
[1:19:18] I said, let's identify who we are a
[1:19:20] little bit. Can we do that this morning?
[1:19:23] Let's let's go back and find my type,
[1:19:25] your type, because it's always good to
[1:19:26] to rehearse where you came from. Amen. I
[1:19:29] They can reminisce. You know, when
[1:19:30] people get together, have been apart for
[1:19:32] a long time that are come from the same
[1:19:33] place, they start talking about
[1:19:34] different things. Hey, do you remember
[1:19:36] this? Yeah. If I was going on the Norway
[1:19:37] thing, hey, the Lepsa, you like the
[1:19:38] Lepsa? I love Lepsa. I mean, yeah, I
[1:19:40] know the best Lepsa comes from here. I
[1:19:42] don't even know there's any Norwegians
[1:19:43] in here. But you start to talk about
[1:19:45] your origin. You start to to discuss all
[1:19:48] the all the different things you love
[1:19:50] there. Maybe some you haven't had a
[1:19:51] certain piece of food for so long,
[1:19:52] you're like, "Oh, I just wish I could
[1:19:54] have certain such such food." Yeah, I
[1:19:57] know. We don't get good stuff here. So
[1:19:59] you talk on that level. So let's talk
[1:20:00] about our origin.
[1:20:05] You can find a match in
[1:20:08] scripture where you are and who you are,
[1:20:10] who you can line up with because
[1:20:12] scripture is where you come from. And so
[1:20:15] if you can find yourself here, you can
[1:20:17] actually then you know where you do come
[1:20:18] from because this is telling you as
[1:20:20] brother says scripture is what tells you
[1:20:22] what you are.
[1:20:24] And so you can say, well, many can go in
[1:20:25] there and I can see ones that have have
[1:20:27] perseverance or those that have courage
[1:20:29] or those that have patience or
[1:20:31] steadfastness or Job and different ones
[1:20:33] longsuffering through through hard pains
[1:20:35] and such. But I want to go even deeper
[1:20:37] than that because there's a strain that
[1:20:39] goes deeper than just identifying with
[1:20:41] someone that was perseverant or David
[1:20:43] with with great courage because there's
[1:20:45] a strain that goes somewhere deep past
[1:20:48] the surface level of our beings. And
[1:20:50] it's when the word was made manifest in
[1:20:53] their hour, something triggered. It's
[1:20:57] called faith. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:00] They believed.
[1:21:03] When God came by Abraham's way, he
[1:21:05] believed. Yes, he did. When the widow of
[1:21:08] Zarapath stepped out on Elijah said,
[1:21:09] "Bake me a cake." And she's all she had
[1:21:12] was just nothing left but for herself
[1:21:13] and she's going to die. And he says,
[1:21:14] "Bake me otherwise." And then, you know,
[1:21:16] we'll go from there. Kind of thing. and
[1:21:17] she just trusted in the word that was
[1:21:20] speaking to her in that moment. That's a
[1:21:23] strain that runs through all of God's
[1:21:26] people. It can point you back to your
[1:21:30] origin when the word comes by your way.
[1:21:33] Like a Peter when he said you're from
[1:21:35] your name is is Jonas and and he points
[1:21:38] to Nathaniel and said I seen you under
[1:21:39] the tree or the woman at the well. All
[1:21:41] of them had the same strain. They
[1:21:44] believed the word as he stepped by their
[1:21:46] way.
[1:21:48] Then in this day, if the word of this
[1:21:50] hour would start by your seed and shines
[1:21:53] a light on your life, what is you're
[1:21:55] going to what's your heart going to do?
[1:21:56] It responds and it tells you where you
[1:22:00] came from.
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:08] Shunomite woman, Jeremiah, Paul,
[1:22:10] Polycarp, Luther, all had a word come in
[1:22:12] their hour.
[1:22:15] And in this
[1:22:18] hour, heaven's homeland security is
[1:22:21] coming by
[1:22:23] and is doing doing identity checks. He's
[1:22:26] looking for a passport. You know what
[1:22:28] they're looking for? The word's looking
[1:22:30] for a faith response to the word of this
[1:22:33] hour. When this message came by your
[1:22:36] way, you say, "Can't sell believe?" And
[1:22:39] the word presents a check. Uh, can I see
[1:22:42] your identity? You know what it looks
[1:22:44] for? It's like, I see faith. I see
[1:22:46] faith. I see response to the word. I
[1:22:49] made an understanding, brother Michael,
[1:22:50] but I believe it. That's all heaven's
[1:22:53] looking for. It's like, yep, there it
[1:22:55] is. There's another one face seat of
[1:22:56] Abraham. There's another one face seat
[1:22:58] of Abraham. There's another one like the
[1:22:59] one at the whale. They got the same
[1:23:01] identity on the check with the word of
[1:23:03] this hour. I can say they're
[1:23:06] homebound. Amen.
[1:23:12] Fathan and Kora in the scripture, they
[1:23:15] went along for so long. But when it
[1:23:17] started getting a little tighter, that's
[1:23:19] when you realize then you can see, hey,
[1:23:21] where's the identity? Where's your
[1:23:23] identity?
[1:23:24] It's going to come. It's coming. It's
[1:23:26] here. It's getting squeezing. The
[1:23:28] pressure is becoming so tight, this
[1:23:29] going that way, someone going this way,
[1:23:31] and you finding out, wait a second, and
[1:23:33] I'm walking alone. That's okay. God's
[1:23:35] people have always walked alone. Micaiah
[1:23:37] walked before Jehoshaphat alone. Elijah
[1:23:40] walked alone. Many in scripture walked
[1:23:42] alone. That's your identity. Standing on
[1:23:45] the word. If it's alone, so be
[1:23:50] it. So be
[1:23:55] it. The 70 he left went to weed them out
[1:23:59] when the word got real
[1:24:02] tight. Oh my. But through all them dark
[1:24:09] ages, God was waiting for a
[1:24:12] time. He'd prepared a word for a special
[1:24:16] hour
[1:24:19] to ignite. He knew it'd be a dark age in
[1:24:23] Leosia. He knew it'd be oh gross
[1:24:26] darkness fill the earth. He knew young
[1:24:28] people that it would be difficult. He
[1:24:30] knew what you'd be going through. He
[1:24:32] knew you'd be hammered and hammered
[1:24:33] through ad and this ad and through every
[1:24:35] app and social media platform and
[1:24:37] everything. All the pull and the draw
[1:24:38] and the desire and the tanalization of
[1:24:40] entertainment. He knows and he knew. So
[1:24:44] he prepared a word for this hour to
[1:24:47] ignite a recognition of where you came
[1:24:51] from. That's why we cherish this message
[1:24:54] because it's bringing to you the reality
[1:24:56] that we're heavenbound. a reality of
[1:24:59] your identity that you came from God and
[1:25:01] you're going back to God.
[1:25:06] That's why Brother Brandham could speak
[1:25:07] on the ego scream because that's exactly
[1:25:09] what was happening. The message would
[1:25:11] scream out and bring you back to that
[1:25:13] pro little ego as you know the story
[1:25:15] probably 1,800 times. But I'll tell it
[1:25:17] to you again because there he was
[1:25:19] pecking his life out in misery on the
[1:25:21] worms of this world and he's wondering
[1:25:23] man living surely he would look down and
[1:25:27] then look up and look down and look up
[1:25:30] and man we're just not the same. No,
[1:25:37] some of you that maybe were sitting in
[1:25:39] some denominational system and you would
[1:25:41] go to church maybe day in and day out or
[1:25:43] week in and week out and you'd be like,
[1:25:44] "Man, it just ain't hidden." You know,
[1:25:47] but what else is there? This is the best
[1:25:50] I can see that old chicken eating the
[1:25:52] worms. Really? Is this all there is? My
[1:25:54] soul crith for more. My deep calleth for
[1:25:58] more. But this is all I see around me.
[1:26:02] That's why God prepared this message
[1:26:06] to help you to look up a little bit,
[1:26:09] hear something a little different that
[1:26:11] starts to trigger something. You
[1:26:12] realize, you know, that first time in
[1:26:14] that story when that little eagle would
[1:26:16] have seen mama
[1:26:18] eagle.
[1:26:20] Wow, look at that creature. That is the
[1:26:23] most stunning, amazing thing I ever saw.
[1:26:27] Amen.
[1:26:32] Wait a second. There's something similar
[1:26:36] to what I see. There's something similar
[1:26:39] to what I hear that's calling something
[1:26:41] here. That must be where I belong.
[1:26:44] Hallelujah. Amen. Then you look at the
[1:26:47] chick and you say, "Exactly right. I
[1:26:49] knew I wasn't like you. That's what I'm
[1:26:51] like. Oh no, that's the enemy. Run for
[1:26:53] the
[1:26:57] hills." We'll leave it there.
[1:27:03] Why? Because God was desiring to unite
[1:27:06] you with him.
[1:27:10] Cuz God is desiring union.
[1:27:16] It's not dos and don'ts, young people.
[1:27:19] It's far beyond dos and don'ts.
[1:27:22] Cuz when you recognize his love is
[1:27:24] calling you. It's a love relationship.
[1:27:27] You say, "Lord, you've called. You saved
[1:27:30] me." And you start to go through
[1:27:31] scripture what he did for you. I say,
[1:27:33] "Lord, the dos and don'ts fade away."
[1:27:36] And all these things and all your eyes
[1:27:37] stay on him.
[1:27:45] The son of man, Christ
[1:27:49] Jesus, united heavens and earth. God
[1:27:53] reconciling man when he came to break
[1:27:57] the
[1:27:58] curse that divided and broke fellowship
[1:28:00] and broke union and he comes down to
[1:28:03] mend
[1:28:05] that a complete union. Now God dwelling
[1:28:08] in flesh. Brother Brandham says when God
[1:28:10] and Christ became one when the dove came
[1:28:12] down on the lamb heaven
[1:28:15] and earth kissed each other
[1:28:19] and God and man was reconciled together.
[1:28:22] He says, "Why?" It was one of the
[1:28:23] greatest moments the world has ever had.
[1:28:27] God desiring to unify once again with
[1:28:32] his creation.
[1:28:36] But this was not the end. The end all, I
[1:28:39] should say, as God had he he's going to
[1:28:42] bring now peace and men the chasm. The
[1:28:44] image that he had made now was redeemed.
[1:28:51] But God had a greater desire than to
[1:28:52] leave it just there.
[1:28:57] This hour he was going to reveal himself
[1:29:01] again as a son of man for the whole
[1:29:04] purpose so that you could come to
[1:29:07] yourself and recognize your identity and
[1:29:11] realize I don't just want to come and
[1:29:13] mend the chasm but I need to I need to
[1:29:15] abide within you. Yes. wasn't just to
[1:29:19] come and and redeem man that way, but
[1:29:21] God wanted to come now and abide within
[1:29:24] and unify him with you
[1:29:30] and that aspect of coming to
[1:29:32] yourself and when you realize where your
[1:29:36] identity is and God can reveal that to
[1:29:38] you in such a revelation and and that
[1:29:41] union then therefore cannot it can't be
[1:29:44] broken. Revelation can't be broken. When
[1:29:47] God reveals that to you, it's you and
[1:29:49] your alone. Devil can't put his little
[1:29:50] fingerprints or his toe printints on
[1:29:52] that area that God alone has. So when he
[1:29:55] reveals where you came from, now that is
[1:29:57] tied for all eternity because there's
[1:29:59] nothing that can break it. It's like the
[1:30:01] prodical son when he was there there in
[1:30:04] the in the pig in the mud mud pit of of
[1:30:06] sin and despair and there he was
[1:30:07] wondering and and in the muck of shame
[1:30:09] and condemnation. But something changed.
[1:30:12] An angel came by his way and he came to
[1:30:16] himself. That wasn't something he
[1:30:18] conjured up. It wasn't something that
[1:30:20] he, oh, I must, I must, I must believe,
[1:30:21] I must believe. No, nothing of that
[1:30:23] nature. It was God that descended and
[1:30:25] said, listen, boy, get up and go back.
[1:30:28] God brought him back to himself. A
[1:30:31] revelation came upon him of what? Who he
[1:30:35] was.
[1:30:37] He sat there and said, "Wait a second.
[1:30:41] What am I doing here? I am actually the
[1:30:44] son of my father. Why am I in the pig
[1:30:48] pen? That was a revelation God gave of
[1:30:50] his identity. His identity never was
[1:30:54] broken ever. He just came to recognize
[1:30:57] it was there. Your identity has never
[1:30:59] come out of nowhere. It was always
[1:31:01] there. God always knew you. He had you
[1:31:03] in the foundation of his mind before the
[1:31:05] foundation and you just came to the
[1:31:08] recognition. Yes, sir.
[1:31:11] That's what this message is. Has the
[1:31:14] power to bring recognition back to your
[1:31:17] soul of where you originally came from.
[1:31:21] Hallelujah.
[1:31:26] It didn't matter what the prodical son
[1:31:27] did. It didn't matter his all his
[1:31:30] mistakes, how vile and how wretched, how
[1:31:33] terrible and how down. It didn't change
[1:31:36] his identity.
[1:31:38] That's true.
[1:31:40] I don't care how heavy the condemnation
[1:31:42] that the devil puts upon you. It don't
[1:31:45] change your identity. Amen. Amen. All
[1:31:48] you got to come to is allowing God to
[1:31:51] straighten your soul with revelation and
[1:31:54] it's over.
[1:31:58] It's
[1:31:59] over. Amen. That's that is a unity.
[1:32:03] Believing on his word will bring life.
[1:32:07] We can see it all through scripture.
[1:32:08] Abraham believed God's word brought
[1:32:10] forth in Isaac. Hannah believed the
[1:32:13] priest's word and she brought forth a
[1:32:16] Samuel. Shunimite woman believed the
[1:32:18] word of a prophet brought life to her
[1:32:20] son twice.
[1:32:21] Actually, Elizabeth brought forth a son.
[1:32:24] Mary by faith in the word of God brought
[1:32:28] forth the word of God.
[1:32:32] And so when you unite with the word, the
[1:32:35] inevitable production is life.
[1:32:42] But Abraham says, "There you are. That's
[1:32:45] oneness with God." When that power works
[1:32:48] in me, works in you, we are one. He said
[1:32:52] one is with God is to have God's spirit
[1:32:54] in you agreeing with the word all the
[1:32:56] word the whole word and make it
[1:32:59] manifested in
[1:33:02] power. I thought
[1:33:04] Lord if we could just come to a place
[1:33:08] where we can
[1:33:09] recognize really what lies within
[1:33:12] you like well brother Michael I'm just a
[1:33:16] believer here in Tennessee. No, no,
[1:33:18] you're not just a believer in Tennessee.
[1:33:20] You are actually omnipotent.
[1:33:27] You say, "Well, that's a tough one to
[1:33:28] swallow." Well, wait a second. Wait a
[1:33:29] second. Does eternity lie within you? It
[1:33:33] does, doesn't it? Because you're a seed
[1:33:34] of God. If you're a seed of God, you
[1:33:36] come from the eternal thoughts of God.
[1:33:38] And God does not have any time bound
[1:33:39] elements to him. So, he's eternal. So,
[1:33:41] therefore, who's eternal with him? Amen.
[1:33:43] So then if he's omnipotent, who is also
[1:33:46] filled with omnipotence? It would be his
[1:33:48] people. And so therefore, if you realize
[1:33:51] that you are walking with that seed
[1:33:53] inside of you, therefore the scripture
[1:33:55] then says, if two or three whatsoever
[1:33:58] you bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:33:59] heaven, and whatsoever you you loose on
[1:34:01] earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again,
[1:34:03] I say unto you that if two of you shall
[1:34:06] agree on earth as touching anything that
[1:34:08] they shall ask, it shall be done of them
[1:34:11] of my father which is in heaven. Why?
[1:34:13] Because two
[1:34:14] omnipotants actually are coming together
[1:34:17] agreeing on the word of God. Your
[1:34:19] origin, your identity is there and you
[1:34:22] realize, wait a second, we have the
[1:34:24] power within us because the life of God
[1:34:27] is flowing through me and through you.
[1:34:29] So we agree on any one thing. Who is now
[1:34:32] coming behind that?
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:39] You're calling on the power of all
[1:34:42] heaven. I have in my notes somewhere. I
[1:34:44] I can't even imagine Satan when he tried
[1:34:47] to tempt the King of Kings. You know
[1:34:50] that Satan
[1:34:54] actually Satan knew God on so many
[1:34:57] different
[1:34:59] levels. He was
[1:35:01] a
[1:35:03] Lucifer, angel of light. This He was
[1:35:06] powerful. He'd seen God in action. He'd
[1:35:10] seen God do so many things in heaven
[1:35:12] that I would even know how to describe.
[1:35:15] Lucifer had a second seat to it all. He
[1:35:17] had a front ring seat of all of God's
[1:35:19] power that uttered through the
[1:35:21] eternities as he as he worked his
[1:35:22] wonders. And then he saw God in his
[1:35:27] fury as
[1:35:29] Satan pulls away, takes the angels out,
[1:35:32] and they the war. And Satan knows the
[1:35:35] fury of God. Satan's seen God at work
[1:35:38] more than you and I have seen than ever.
[1:35:42] He knows who the King of Kings is. He
[1:35:46] does. Oh, yeah.
[1:35:48] and he comes
[1:35:51] down and he sees this little humble
[1:35:54] man and he's wondering who is
[1:35:57] this? But Abraham says he didn't believe
[1:36:01] that he was
[1:36:02] Emanuel and he's like who is this? Satan
[1:36:05] has seen God. He'd seen him in fury.
[1:36:07] He'd seen him in glory. He'd seen him
[1:36:09] shining. He'd seen him manifest
[1:36:10] attributes you and I haven't. And he's
[1:36:12] wondering who is this? And it was God.
[1:36:14] And he's confused. Well, dude, turn
[1:36:17] these stones into bread. And he's trying
[1:36:19] to he's trying to find out. Are you
[1:36:21] really the creator? Are you really the
[1:36:23] one that can preserve yourself? I've
[1:36:25] seen God show his force. I've seen God
[1:36:28] show his fury, but this isn't matching.
[1:36:30] Turn the stones into bread. It is
[1:36:32] written, "Man shall not live by bread
[1:36:34] alone." That's an odd response. Well, I
[1:36:37] know that's in the scripture. And so, he
[1:36:39] throws it again. And he throws it again.
[1:36:40] And God spokes back the word to him.
[1:36:42] Speaks the word back to him. Devil's
[1:36:43] just scratching his head. Who on earth
[1:36:45] is this? I just don't believe it's
[1:36:47] Emanuel. There's no way this can be God.
[1:36:49] He's too humble. He's too simple. He's
[1:36:51] too He He I just can't even see it. He's
[1:36:53] from an illitant bird. There's no way
[1:36:54] this is the son of God. No way God would
[1:36:57] go into humble flesh like this. There's
[1:36:59] no way omnipotence reigns in that
[1:37:01] fleshly body.
[1:37:05] Amen.
[1:37:08] And the only time he got an answer to
[1:37:11] his
[1:37:12] question is when he stepped into hell.
[1:37:17] Hallelujah.
[1:37:19] Praise the Lord. That's when he found
[1:37:20] out who he really was. He says, "You've
[1:37:24] wondered, devil. You've wondered and
[1:37:25] you've wondered and you wondered. Wonder
[1:37:27] no longer. I'm going to take them keys
[1:37:29] from you. I've conquered everything
[1:37:31] you've tried to give and I'm stripping
[1:37:33] you of death and hell in a grave and
[1:37:35] I've come to show you my true identity.
[1:37:39] Hallelujah. He's doing that to you.
[1:37:42] Every day he pounds you, he's wondering,
[1:37:44] "Are you really a son and daughter of
[1:37:47] God? Can you really be that? There's no
[1:37:50] way. She's too humble. She's too simple.
[1:37:53] There's no way. She's got mistakes. I
[1:37:55] mean, I pound her and I pound her and I
[1:37:57] pound him with her faults and his faults
[1:37:59] and he was tripped up here. How on earth
[1:38:02] could omnipotent be inside that body?
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:06] Hallelujah.
[1:38:11] Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] It's okay, devil. We've got a time
[1:38:19] coming when you're going to wonder no
[1:38:21] longer. When we sit beside the king in
[1:38:24] his throne and we stand there before the
[1:38:27] world and you can wonder all you want,
[1:38:29] but at that moment, you're going to
[1:38:32] start gaping.
[1:38:34] They were
[1:38:36] all this
[1:38:39] time I wasted my energy for nothing.
[1:38:43] Yep, you did. Yes, sir. Because we're
[1:38:47] more than conquerors
[1:38:49] cuz I got his life in me. I'm identified
[1:38:52] with him and he's identified with me.
[1:38:58] I can't wait for that moment.
[1:39:01] Because he still has that little
[1:39:03] question. He saw the miracles. Devil saw
[1:39:05] all the signs. He saw all the wonders
[1:39:08] and still wondered
[1:39:13] until we'll say it all together when we
[1:39:16] get there. Devil wonder no longer.
[1:39:22] Amen.
[1:39:30] Said, "Brother Michael, I have so many
[1:39:32] mistakes." Well, we took care of that,
[1:39:34] but I'll just take care of it a second
[1:39:35] time just in case you missed the first
[1:39:38] time. God didn't unite with your flesh.
[1:39:46] No, he united with your soul, your
[1:39:48] faith. That's what connects you.
[1:39:52] But Abraham says, and just to give you
[1:39:55] the quote from questions and answers so
[1:39:56] you can take it home with you and put
[1:39:58] that in your pocket and for the next
[1:40:00] time the devil comes to your door
[1:40:01] outside in the parking
[1:40:03] lot. He says, "How can I take a cocker
[1:40:05] and make it a grain of wheat out of it?"
[1:40:07] He said, "It's impossible." And you know
[1:40:08] the quote, he said, "Inside the cockar
[1:40:10] has been transmitted from a cockab to
[1:40:12] wheat, cockar germ called wheat life."
[1:40:16] And brother goes through the quote. But
[1:40:17] the nature, he says, of the cockab is
[1:40:19] still sticky. See, it will be it will be
[1:40:23] until this new life has been fully
[1:40:25] developed out of the ground and raised
[1:40:27] up again. So, we're dealing with this
[1:40:29] flesh until that time. He says, "And the
[1:40:31] cockabore is still sticky, but it's got
[1:40:33] a nature on the inside of it of wheat."
[1:40:37] So, you will make mistakes. We will
[1:40:40] stumble, but you'll get up because
[1:40:42] something inside of you drives you to
[1:40:44] get up. You can't quit whether you like
[1:40:46] it or not. You feel like someone
[1:40:47] throwing someone in the towel. Sometimes
[1:40:49] your family is moving this way and that
[1:40:51] way and you feel alone. But something
[1:40:52] inside, what is it? It's your identity.
[1:40:55] It's where you came from.
[1:41:02] Man, that's why the devil pounds you to
[1:41:05] try and make you forget.
[1:41:08] He tries and makes you forget.
[1:41:11] You know, it's not a wonder that
[1:41:13] Alzheimer's or dementia is so prevalent
[1:41:16] in this day. Natural type
[1:41:19] spiritual spiritually. There's a lot of
[1:41:22] spiritual Alzheimer's out
[1:41:25] there. Satan's so wre havoc. People have
[1:41:28] got confused and wandered on this idea
[1:41:31] of what the gospel message is. And the
[1:41:33] church has become so watered down and so
[1:41:37] weak need and not following the true
[1:41:40] word. They're trying to maybe look maybe
[1:41:41] trying to get people to to like what
[1:41:43] they're doing and they become more like
[1:41:45] rock bands than than a church service.
[1:41:47] That's a hey
[1:41:49] I nothing compares to worship by the
[1:41:52] true believers like this morning when
[1:41:55] you can just come with pure worship. Oh
[1:41:57] but there's churches are trying to
[1:41:58] fabricate something. It's that they got
[1:42:00] spiritual but ram called spiritual
[1:42:02] amnesia. He says how can you be a
[1:42:03] Christian and deny the word? You can't
[1:42:06] do it. He says, "If I'm living in this
[1:42:08] generation, what this portion of word
[1:42:09] has promised for this generation, I've
[1:42:11] got to be that. If I'm going to be a
[1:42:13] Christian, I got to be identified with
[1:42:15] all that the Bible preaches and stands
[1:42:18] for everything. Every bit of it. I can't
[1:42:20] pick and choose. If I'm identified with
[1:42:22] it, I'm identified with all of it."
[1:42:24] Amen.
[1:42:26] The problem is people don't know what
[1:42:28] they're identified with. And if I could
[1:42:29] say this morning, some of you, well,
[1:42:32] help me. uh you know we maybe we'll be
[1:42:34] the 51st state sometime so I can kind of
[1:42:35] walk here prematurely.
[1:42:40] Okay. But if we I I have to say the US
[1:42:43] has forgotten a lot of what it stood
[1:42:45] for. What it founded on and what it
[1:42:48] fought for. It's it's forgotten that if
[1:42:50] they if they've got an amnesia or an
[1:42:52] Alzheimer's disease of what has what
[1:42:53] those original articles were founded on.
[1:42:56] If you go back to that life and liberty
[1:42:58] and the pursuit of happiness, freedom of
[1:43:00] religion and one nation under God,
[1:43:02] they've left God. They now are even
[1:43:05] fighting for the They're not even
[1:43:06] fighting the same nation anymore. It's
[1:43:08] broken. Unity, the union.
[1:43:13] Amen.
[1:43:14] The definition of what even the
[1:43:16] forefathers fought for, of what America
[1:43:18] even defines,
[1:43:20] are very two different things. That's
[1:43:22] right.
[1:43:23] what people are fighting for now and
[1:43:25] really what the American Constitution as
[1:43:27] such even came up to uphold and to
[1:43:29] identify what you fought for your rights
[1:43:31] and rights and freedoms is so different.
[1:43:37] You know, I
[1:43:41] wonder if the men that fought for these
[1:43:44] way back would stand today. Yes, sir.
[1:43:47] They said that's what we fought for.
[1:43:51] What a terrible terrible
[1:43:54] moment. His wounded leg, blood running
[1:43:57] down. He's got a bullet wound here in
[1:43:59] his arm. He's leaning on his musket. And
[1:44:02] he could be brought to time and said,
[1:44:05] "This is the state of the union."
[1:44:12] And he'd hang his head and he'd weep. I
[1:44:14] didn't fight for that. That's not what I
[1:44:16] stood for.
[1:44:18] That's not what my forefathers stood
[1:44:19] for. That's not what was written on the
[1:44:20] page. That's not what was written there.
[1:44:23] I didn't fight for that. Steven and Paul
[1:44:26] and Peter, they brought forth in time
[1:44:28] and they see the denominational system
[1:44:29] and Rome raising its head. They said,
[1:44:31] "No, that's not what we fought for. We
[1:44:33] didn't stand for that."
[1:44:41] And not so long ago, then people went
[1:44:43] through and they started slashing
[1:44:44] everything down. We no longer want to be
[1:44:47] identified for that part of
[1:44:49] history. But that that's that's just
[1:44:51] part I mean there brother says is the
[1:44:53] good and the bad. There's all parts you
[1:44:55] identified with it all. You're
[1:44:56] destroying my identification.
[1:44:59] I don't want it no more.
[1:45:02] Brother says I must never forget this. I
[1:45:04] want to remain a true American citizen.
[1:45:06] I must remember that I'm I'm what my
[1:45:08] nation is for I'm identified by my
[1:45:10] nation. Catch the spiritual parallel
[1:45:12] please. to forget her, to fight for her,
[1:45:14] or to die for her, or to stand for all
[1:45:15] she stands for. I must stand for it.
[1:45:17] What my nation is, I am. What it stands
[1:45:20] for, I stand for it. Amen. You cannot
[1:45:22] forget what your nation stands for
[1:45:24] because then how do you fight for it?
[1:45:29] If you don't know what you're fighting
[1:45:30] for, you're like, well, I don't know.
[1:45:31] How do you have ferocity in the battle
[1:45:33] if you don't even know what you believe
[1:45:34] in? Well, you know, I think we I think
[1:45:38] we stand for for truth. Uh, what is
[1:45:42] serpent seed exactly? Haven't really
[1:45:44] been in the message lately. What do we
[1:45:45] What do we believe? Oh, yes. We believe
[1:45:47] in one
[1:45:49] God. No, no, you need to know what
[1:45:52] you're fighting for. Amen. They knew
[1:45:56] what they fighting for. I wonder if they
[1:45:58] someone read them the declaration or all
[1:46:00] of their desires. Here's what we're
[1:46:01] fighting for. We're not getting taxed.
[1:46:02] We're not having this. We're not being
[1:46:04] on the oppression. Yeah, that's exactly
[1:46:05] what I'm here for. Sign me up.
[1:46:10] Let me just read for you what we're
[1:46:11] fighting for. And we can go through
[1:46:13] scripture after scripture after
[1:46:15] scripture. And you're like, "Yes, I
[1:46:16] believe that. I believe that. I believe
[1:46:18] that. That's exactly what I'm fighting.
[1:46:20] Sign me up."
[1:46:26] Amen. But says, "You're no more an
[1:46:28] American citizen when you can't become
[1:46:29] part of it. And you're no more a
[1:46:31] Christian when you can't become part of
[1:46:33] him." Amen. Amen.
[1:46:37] And down through the ages, Satan's been
[1:46:38] trying to cancel or distort or create a
[1:46:41] a different remembrance of who God is.
[1:46:44] Trying to remove the statutes of what we
[1:46:46] stood for. I'd say if I could say, well,
[1:46:48] what are the articles that Christ stood
[1:46:50] for? Where are they? What is it that he
[1:46:53] hung on a cross
[1:46:56] for? That would take a very long long if
[1:46:59] I took the scroll of the of our
[1:47:02] declaration. Amen. of independence.
[1:47:05] That's right. This is my Declaration of
[1:47:07] Independence.
[1:47:09] I've seen yours.
[1:47:11] I've walked in there. I've looked at the
[1:47:12] original signatures and it's an amazing
[1:47:15] thing. I'm not even American, but I
[1:47:16] stand I almost salute. My
[1:47:18] goodness. I feel it. You walk in that
[1:47:21] rotunda and we
[1:47:24] Wow. I went in Canadian. I walk out
[1:47:26] like, "Oh, I feel like an American."
[1:47:31] It's amazing with the natural
[1:47:33] nationality, the power of it.
[1:47:37] Brothers and sisters, thank you, Lord.
[1:47:40] What about when we start to look at the
[1:47:43] word of God,
[1:47:46] not signed by John Hancock, his big
[1:47:48] fancy Jay, whatever is their age, signed
[1:47:51] in blood from Calvary's cross. And we
[1:47:54] can walk up to the word and we can start
[1:47:57] to read it. say, "Oh, God, I want to
[1:47:59] read my declaration. I want to read my
[1:48:02] freedom. I want to read what I'm
[1:48:03] fighting for. I want to read what I'm
[1:48:05] identified with because I'm a soldier of
[1:48:07] the cross of Calvary.
[1:48:10] This message, this word, lest we never
[1:48:13] forget." What do we stand for? If I
[1:48:17] could hold the volumes of this message
[1:48:18] here and stack them up high, God, we
[1:48:21] stand for this word.
[1:48:24] One word, one baptism, one faith, a
[1:48:28] united bride.
[1:48:34] Everything, our conduct, our respects,
[1:48:36] our home, our dress, our appearance,
[1:48:37] it's all there. It's all in our
[1:48:39] declaration.
[1:48:43] You know, it says in there, there's a
[1:48:44] word.
[1:48:48] We hold these truths to be self-evident
[1:48:50] that all men are created equal and that
[1:48:51] they are endowed by their creator with
[1:48:54] certain unalienable rights that among
[1:48:58] these are life, liberty, and the pursuit
[1:49:00] of happiness. My somebody was inspired.
[1:49:05] You know that word
[1:49:07] unalienable is quite a word. It means
[1:49:10] impossible to take away or give up.
[1:49:15] That's in your earthly declaration.
[1:49:18] Unalable. Unable to be taken away from
[1:49:20] or given away by the possessor. Freedom
[1:49:23] of religion. The most inalienable of
[1:49:25] human rights. Oh my goodness. That's
[1:49:29] your natural. Amen. What about this?
[1:49:32] Unal inalienable. Unable to be taken
[1:49:36] away. Once it was signed and sealed on
[1:49:38] Calvary, there's no way your rights and
[1:49:41] freedoms can be taken away. I started to
[1:49:43] look through. I said, "Well, do we even
[1:49:45] have an idea of what those even are?
[1:49:47] What my what my where my identity is? I
[1:49:50] that's what the whole loosing of the
[1:49:51] seals has been is to identify who you
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:59] are. That's why then when you become
[1:50:02] identified with all of this, every
[1:50:05] aspect of it, then you can realize when
[1:50:07] brother Brandham says I'm identified. I
[1:50:10] was there
[1:50:12] with Abraham when he put the sacrifice
[1:50:15] of Isaac on the altar. I was there. Why?
[1:50:18] Because he's identified with everything
[1:50:21] Abraham is and identified with. I'm
[1:50:23] identified with Joseph. I'm identified
[1:50:25] with Jacob. I'm identified. I was with
[1:50:27] Moses. I was with David. I was with the
[1:50:30] Hebrew children. I was with Daniel. I
[1:50:32] was at Pentecost where the Holy Ghost
[1:50:33] came down. Why? Because I'm part of him.
[1:50:36] I was there with him at the cross. I'm
[1:50:38] identified with his sacrifice. You're
[1:50:40] part of him. You're united.
[1:50:43] Amen.
[1:50:46] Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:49] But the Rabb says, "Don't get spiritual
[1:50:50] amnesia cuz you'll identify yourself
[1:50:54] with something
[1:50:56] else." He said, "Stay right with that
[1:51:02] word."
[1:51:05] There are so many freedoms in the
[1:51:06] scripture. I don't even have time
[1:51:08] because of my time is up. Freedoms from
[1:51:11] guilt and sin and shame. And if you need
[1:51:15] to go through your declaration, just go
[1:51:16] to Romans 8:1. That's right. There is
[1:51:19] therefore now no condemnation.
[1:51:22] You haven't gone through your
[1:51:23] declaration. You maybe need to. You need
[1:51:26] to walk through there and say, "Well,
[1:51:27] I'm have a need in my body." You need to
[1:51:30] go through your declaration of
[1:51:31] independence. And that's where you'd
[1:51:32] say, "He shall lay hands on the sick,
[1:51:33] they shall recover. He's the healer of
[1:51:36] all my diseases. By his stripes, I'm
[1:51:39] healed. Yes. It's in your declaration of
[1:51:42] independence. You say, "Well, brother
[1:51:44] Michael, I'm in desperate need. I need
[1:51:46] his help. I need the Lord." Well, just
[1:51:49] go
[1:51:51] to article number Psalms 12:21, sorry,
[1:51:55] 2:8. My help cometh from the Lord, which
[1:51:58] made heaven and earth. Amen. He will not
[1:52:00] suffer by thy foot to be moved. He that
[1:52:02] keepeth thee will not suffer. Behold,
[1:52:04] slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel
[1:52:06] shall neither slumber nor sleep. The
[1:52:08] Lord is thy keeper. The Lord is thy
[1:52:10] shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall
[1:52:12] not smite thee by day, nor the moon by
[1:52:14] night. The Lord shall preserve thee from
[1:52:16] all evil. He shall preserve thy soul.
[1:52:18] The Lord shall preserve thy going out
[1:52:20] and thy coming in from this time forth,
[1:52:22] even for ever more.
[1:52:25] My help cometh from him. My help cometh
[1:52:28] from the Lord, the writer and the center
[1:52:30] of my
[1:52:32] declaration. Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] As we come to a
[1:52:41] close, at least I try to. Now I'm going
[1:52:44] to
[1:52:46] descend. You know, when a husband and
[1:52:48] wife
[1:52:51] unite, there's something that happens.
[1:52:55] Everything that the husband
[1:52:58] has becomes
[1:53:00] hers. This is what union does, you know,
[1:53:04] in engagement and when they're seeing
[1:53:06] each other before and they're getting to
[1:53:08] know each other, she has no claim on
[1:53:12] nothing. Nothing. And he actually don't
[1:53:14] have much. He doesn't got no
[1:53:15] responsibility. You know those awkward
[1:53:16] times when the first time he he pays for
[1:53:18] her lunch, it's like, well, I kind of
[1:53:21] want to pay for her, but it's kind of
[1:53:23] weird, maybe. It's a friend. She's like,
[1:53:25] "I've been paying for my own." It's It's
[1:53:27] that I'm just going from experience.
[1:53:29] It's kind of that awkward moment that
[1:53:30] first time you're like, "No, I got it.
[1:53:31] You know, you want to be the man."
[1:53:32] "Yeah, I got your I got your lunch." And
[1:53:33] she's like, "Well, no, it's okay. We're
[1:53:35] not in her mind." She's like, "No, we're
[1:53:36] not there yet." And he's like, "Well, I
[1:53:38] really hope we're there. No, we're not.
[1:53:40] I'll pay for my own lunch. Thank
[1:53:42] you." You know, but you know, if the
[1:53:44] relationship is is to be, it progresses
[1:53:47] a little bit and he kind of starts to
[1:53:49] take, you know, more and more, but he
[1:53:51] doesn't have to. and and and and she and
[1:53:54] she has no claim on it's like, "Hey, pay
[1:53:55] for me, will you?" She's like, "I'm not
[1:53:58] even married to you yet. We're not even
[1:53:59] engaged. What are you doing? What this
[1:54:01] whole thing's off?" No, that's not it.
[1:54:04] It just kind of slowly gets there. But
[1:54:06] the moment they come to an altar, the
[1:54:09] moment they come into union, the moment
[1:54:12] they are united as one, everything
[1:54:15] changes. Everything. When she comes to
[1:54:18] that moment, he now assumes all her
[1:54:21] needs, everything. There's no way he can
[1:54:24] disassociate himself from it. And she
[1:54:26] has all claim. Honey, I have a great
[1:54:29] need. And he says, "Here I am. I am
[1:54:31] everything you need. All that I have. My
[1:54:34] whole kingdom is yours. Not even up to
[1:54:36] half. Everything.
[1:54:39] Everything changes there. So the
[1:54:42] resources of your husband is at your
[1:54:45] disposal. Amen.
[1:54:48] She don't beg no more. Can I please get
[1:54:51] a hundred bucks?
[1:54:54] No, that's not how God works. Well, I
[1:54:56] put you on a budget, hun. Uh, looks like
[1:54:58] you're stuck to uh $10 more dollars this
[1:55:00] month and you're getting ain't no more
[1:55:01] food for this house. And if the kids
[1:55:02] starve, tough
[1:55:08] luck. I don't know if you're running
[1:55:10] home that way. That's all right. I'm not
[1:55:12] here. That's the pastor's job. But I
[1:55:15] know my God. Don't run my union with him
[1:55:18] as my husband, as his bride. He don't
[1:55:20] run that with me. Say, "Oh, God, I'm in
[1:55:22] need. I've been here before. I'm needing
[1:55:24] you greatly this morning. My household
[1:55:27] or or my this or my job or I'm in a need
[1:55:29] of this. I'm in great financial need. I
[1:55:31] need a job. Oh, God. Would you come?
[1:55:33] Would you provide for me? My family, my
[1:55:35] my loved ones have gone astray. I need
[1:55:37] you to step and intervene." Well, you've
[1:55:40] been here before in prayer, and I've
[1:55:41] heard you time and time again, and it's
[1:55:43] just done and over. All right. No, that
[1:55:45] is not how it works. All the resources
[1:55:49] of heaven are at your disposal. Thank
[1:55:52] you, Lord. Brother Brandham says in a
[1:55:54] quote, he says, "Now, brethren, when the
[1:55:57] brethren receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:55:59] Ghost, this is the summit. This is all
[1:56:02] of it." He says, "But brethren, that's
[1:56:04] wrong. There's no summit to God's power.
[1:56:08] We move on and on. It's the unlimited
[1:56:11] resources of God has never been tapped.
[1:56:14] Yet blessings and power that we know
[1:56:17] nothing about. I say get on your knees.
[1:56:20] I say cry out to your husband that
[1:56:22] you've united with. Say, "Oh God, you're
[1:56:25] the untapped resource. I need more." He
[1:56:28] says, "I have it. I have it." You
[1:56:31] haven't even begun to tap into the
[1:56:33] resources of glory.
[1:56:36] Amen.
[1:56:37] It's at your disposal. But have you
[1:56:40] asked him recently?
[1:56:43] Don't be shy. Don't be bashful. Maybe
[1:56:46] like
[1:56:47] Jehoshaphat, you need to cry out. So, oh
[1:56:52] God, I need your intervention right now.
[1:56:57] He's just waiting. You know when blind
[1:56:59] Barameus was there at the gate and he
[1:57:01] was going to cry out the crowd is
[1:57:03] shouting and yelling and Baram speaks
[1:57:06] about him being distance away Barameus
[1:57:09] voice could never get through the crowd
[1:57:10] and he says that faith reached out to
[1:57:12] him. I just wonder God knows all things
[1:57:16] and he must have been walking away and
[1:57:18] he's like two one zero there it is
[1:57:24] finan waiting for the cry. I just wonder
[1:57:27] whose cry he's waiting for right now. He
[1:57:30] knows this is welling up like
[1:57:32] Jehoshaphat's cry. And you come to that
[1:57:34] moment and say, "Oh, God." Maybe not
[1:57:36] audibly, but maybe from here, from your
[1:57:39] heart, you start to cry out cuz he's
[1:57:41] here. He's here to answer your
[1:57:44] need. I don't serve a God that's
[1:57:46] disappeared since Calvary. I don't
[1:57:49] believe in a God that disappeared since
[1:57:51] 1965. I don't believe a God that
[1:57:53] disappeared since yesterday. He's here
[1:57:55] today.
[1:57:57] He's here
[1:58:07] today. A limitless
[1:58:10] God. Oh my, I just got too much here. I
[1:58:13] need to move on. My I'm so sorry.
[1:58:17] what that union
[1:58:19] does. You know, when there's
[1:58:22] union,
[1:58:25] inside of that bride is certain
[1:58:27] potentials and inside of the groom is
[1:58:30] certain
[1:58:31] potentials, but they can't be made
[1:58:33] manifest until there's a union. They can
[1:58:36] sit there dormant for so long. And
[1:58:39] inside is better brand
[1:58:42] scriptures, there was the promised seed
[1:58:44] inside of Abraham. But it needed to
[1:58:46] become manifest. It was sitting there.
[1:58:48] And there were certain attributes of
[1:58:49] Sarah, but they needed to be combined.
[1:58:51] And there's attributes in him that he
[1:58:54] needs you
[1:58:56] to be made manifest throughout. That's
[1:58:58] right.
[1:59:00] That's what this message came here at
[1:59:02] this hour to bring a union.
[1:59:05] Brother Brandham even says in a quote,
[1:59:08] he says that Jesus, there were certain
[1:59:10] parts of his ministry that he could not
[1:59:12] fulfill and he's left it for you.
[1:59:18] That to me is powerful. And I've thought
[1:59:21] about that here. Jesus Christ, the
[1:59:25] creator said, "No, there's a portion of
[1:59:27] my ministry that I need to leave to my
[1:59:31] bride."
[1:59:33] Amen. What a responsibility you have
[1:59:38] to now complete the ministry of Jesus
[1:59:42] Christ living in flesh today. Amen.
[1:59:50] That puts a responsibility on our
[1:59:51] shoulders.
[1:59:53] Say, Lord, that that's what you're
[1:59:55] asking of me. Yes.
[1:59:57] Because every bride walks, wherever she
[2:00:00] walks, she carries the identity of her
[2:00:02] husband. She represents him everywhere
[2:00:06] she goes. And you represent him
[2:00:08] everywhere you go. I'll even read this
[2:00:12] scripture as we wind down here
[2:00:19] now. the kingdom of
[2:00:25] heaven and all of its power. Think about
[2:00:29] the kingdom of heaven and all of its
[2:00:33] power. That's a big phrase because my
[2:00:36] mind actually stops somewhere. What is
[2:00:40] all the power of heaven?
[2:00:46] Luke 17:20 says, "And when he was
[2:00:48] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[2:00:50] kingdom of heaven of God should come, he
[2:00:52] answered them and said, 'The kingdom of
[2:00:53] God cometh not with observation. Neither
[2:00:56] shall they say, low here or low there,
[2:00:59] for behold, the kingdom of God is within
[2:01:03] you." God has placed all the power of
[2:01:07] heaven in you. That is to me powerful.
[2:01:10] Satan took Jesus up on the mountain.
[2:01:12] Abraham said showed him all the kingdoms
[2:01:13] of the world. He said Jesus said, "Get
[2:01:15] thee hence behind me, Satan." That's
[2:01:16] right. He wasn't he wasn't care. He
[2:01:18] said, "If the kingdom of this world, I
[2:01:19] could call legions of angels, but my
[2:01:21] kingdom is not of this world, but my
[2:01:22] kingdom is in heaven." And he said, "The
[2:01:24] kingdom of God will be within you." So
[2:01:26] therefore, the legions and powers of the
[2:01:29] backing of the holy angels, he says,
[2:01:31] "Hallelujah is in you." Was born into
[2:01:33] the deity of Christ by the baptism of
[2:01:35] the Holy Ghost. Yes sir. Who are you
[2:01:38] this morning? Who is Christ Jesus? He's
[2:01:41] in you as much as you'll let him be.
[2:01:43] He's pressing, trying to get into you,
[2:01:46] to move into you today. And you stand
[2:01:48] off and wonder and look and gaze and
[2:01:49] hold back a little. Don't do that. He
[2:01:51] said, "Move straight into the kingdom of
[2:01:53] God." The hour is here. The hour for the
[2:01:57] power of Almighty God, all of heaven's
[2:02:00] forces, the angels, and the power
[2:02:01] thereof is right here, pressing into you
[2:02:05] and me to say, "Go be my representation.
[2:02:09] be my bride. Finish my ministry.
[2:02:12] [Applause]
[2:02:15] That's what the union has come to do. To
[2:02:18] get you to remember where you came from
[2:02:20] so that you and all the power of heaven
[2:02:23] can end this final age with your
[2:02:25] shoulders back. Young people walking in
[2:02:27] a gross darkness and say, "I'm sorry,
[2:02:29] devil, but you cannot have me because
[2:02:31] I'm a son of
[2:02:34] God.
[2:02:39] Abraham says, "Listen closely. The
[2:02:42] kingdom of God is his word made power."
[2:02:44] If you want to put that down, he says,
[2:02:46] "The kingdom of God is God's word made
[2:02:47] power." What is the kingdom of God? Is
[2:02:50] within you. The kingdom's in you. And
[2:02:51] when the word comes in, what does the
[2:02:53] word begin? It turns itself into power,
[2:02:57] making it say just exactly what it said.
[2:03:01] Amen.
[2:03:03] That's why he says, "Take no thought for
[2:03:04] what you should say because he is the
[2:03:08] power within you that is making sure you
[2:03:10] say what it said."
[2:03:14] You know, I think of all the resources
[2:03:16] of the enemy's
[2:03:21] kingdom. Satan needs a
[2:03:24] vessel. Legion was a vessel that he
[2:03:26] could express his demonic power through
[2:03:28] for a period of time.
[2:03:30] Pharisees were a vessel to express his
[2:03:32] religious demonic powers. Caesar was a
[2:03:35] vessel to express political demonic
[2:03:38] powers. They were all Satan's powers
[2:03:41] uniting with a vessel to express the
[2:03:44] attributes from in Satan's kingdom. And
[2:03:46] if that's how Satan works, we know that
[2:03:48] that's the perversion of how God
[2:03:50] manifests because God is desiring a
[2:03:53] uniting. God is desiring to manifest his
[2:03:56] own power. And if Satan has billions and
[2:04:00] billions of people to manifest his
[2:04:03] attributes through willing, they're
[2:04:05] willing to unite with that power. And
[2:04:08] you look at all of those, they're
[2:04:09] they're they're given over in such
[2:04:12] desire and they give themselves heart,
[2:04:14] soul, everything they have, and they
[2:04:16] throw themselves into everything that
[2:04:18] Satan is drawing them towards. I
[2:04:19] thought, "Oh, God, if that's what
[2:04:21] Satan's people are willing to and
[2:04:23] desiring to unite, surely there's a
[2:04:25] people." What about the vessels of God
[2:04:28] that are desiring with everything within
[2:04:29] them to say, "Oh God, I desire to unite
[2:04:32] with the Christ, the son of the living
[2:04:34] God, be expressed through me." Oh, I
[2:04:38] sure hope God isn't short changed that
[2:04:40] he's like, "Is there is there one? Is
[2:04:44] there just is there two Satan all
[2:04:46] through the world? Billions of people
[2:04:48] that he's just expressing through. Look
[2:04:49] at that. Look at that attribute." And
[2:04:50] God is saying, "Is there anybody willing
[2:04:53] to give themselves so surrendered, so
[2:04:56] surrendered to set aside everything of
[2:04:59] this world? I desire union.
[2:05:03] I've come with this age. I've come with
[2:05:04] this message. I've brought a prophet
[2:05:06] down your down in your day. I've
[2:05:08] preserved all that he said. There's a
[2:05:09] voice in this hour so that you could
[2:05:11] know where you came from. So that you
[2:05:14] could desire. Is anybody prerecting your
[2:05:16] heart?" God is saying, "Anybody,
[2:05:18] anybody, do you desire to unite with
[2:05:21] me?"
[2:05:23] And I can imagine Satan strutting
[2:05:26] through all humanity saying, "Look at
[2:05:28] all mine. Look at all
[2:05:31] mine." He said, "Lord, this morning, if
[2:05:34] you could walk through this little
[2:05:36] service, you can say, "Look at all mine.
[2:05:41] Look at all
[2:05:42] mine. The fairest of 10,000. their
[2:05:45] beauty beyond no beauty. I said, Lord,
[2:05:48] that's what I want to be identified
[2:05:49] with. I just want to surrender it all. I
[2:05:52] want you to be able to unite with this
[2:05:54] being, this vessel, this soul crying
[2:05:56] out, oh God, in this last day. I don't
[2:05:58] want any area of my life. If I need to
[2:06:00] shutter it, I need to cast this aside or
[2:06:02] that aside or this interest or that
[2:06:03] interest. I need to check my gauges.
[2:06:05] Lord, I want you to have full access to
[2:06:08] everything this being can be. Empty me
[2:06:10] out so that you may pour in. That's my
[2:06:12] cry this morning as we stand this
[2:06:14] morning. Is that your cry? Is that your
[2:06:16] desire? Say, "Oh God, I want to be a
[2:06:18] willing vessel. I want to I desire,
[2:06:21] Lord, that there's something I need a
[2:06:22] uniting awaken to me my identity this
[2:06:25] morning." If that's your crying, you
[2:06:28] call out to him. Maybe you need to be
[2:06:30] like a Jehoshaphat this morning and say,
[2:06:32] "Oh God, I'm in a fix this morning. I'm
[2:06:35] in a situation. Can you just please help
[2:06:37] me if that's your need? You just pray to
[2:06:39] him. I don't need to pray for you. I'll
[2:06:41] pray, but you pray too. You say, "Lord,
[2:06:43] this is my need." Why don't you bow your
[2:06:44] heads this morning? Heavenly
[2:06:46] Father, Lord, there indeed is billions
[2:06:50] and billions of people and Satan has his
[2:06:53] hands on so many. And Lord, it's like he
[2:06:55] has just full access to to all the
[2:06:57] things of this world and to present his
[2:06:59] enticements. But Lord, there is indeed a
[2:07:01] people. It's a small little group. Your
[2:07:03] prophet said a little, very, very, very
[2:07:06] few. Because Lord, you've chosen a
[2:07:09] little elect lady to be a representation
[2:07:11] of your pure word in this hour. Lord, we
[2:07:14] lift our hands as we see the world is
[2:07:17] uniting. Rome is uniting. The Aoda
[2:07:20] churches are uniting. If that's in the
[2:07:22] negative, there's got to be the positive
[2:07:24] that's happening. You're bright around
[2:07:26] this world. We're not uniting on our
[2:07:28] ideas. We're not uniting on some false
[2:07:30] idea what this message is. We're uniting
[2:07:32] on the true word alone. on what this
[2:07:34] word pure word of the hour Lord cast
[2:07:36] aside we cast aside everything that's
[2:07:38] contrary to your word this morning and
[2:07:41] may you have your way move and deal Lord
[2:07:44] I pray amongst your people that Lord we
[2:07:47] could be so surrendered your prophet oh
[2:07:49] what an example he was that he was so
[2:07:51] surrendered that Lord you could work
[2:07:53] through him Lord we're not prophets but
[2:07:55] we're your bride and we desire oh that
[2:07:58] you could complete the ministry that
[2:08:01] Lord you've given to us to complete in
[2:08:03] this last stage, Lord, that we could be
[2:08:05] eternal life, bearers of eternity, Lord,
[2:08:09] amongst the dark hour. I commit your
[2:08:11] people, Lord, into your hand. May you
[2:08:14] bless them this morning. Would you touch
[2:08:16] their hearts in Jesus Christ's holy
[2:08:19] name? Amen.
[2:08:23] Amen.
[2:08:26] Hallelujah. God bless you. God bless
[2:08:29] you.
[2:08:50] Thank you,
[2:08:52] Lord. Oh, don't you appreciate the word
[2:08:54] of the Lord today?
[2:08:59] This is your
[2:09:01] house. Let's sing it
[2:09:03] together. Father, come and
[2:09:09] dwell. This is your
[2:09:15] house, a holy house.
[2:09:22] Well, the
[2:09:23] lost and the lost and the lonely bring
[2:09:27] their burdens and their
[2:09:31] cares. This is your
[2:09:36] house. This is your
[2:09:42] house. Come and
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:46] dwell. Let's just worship him now. We
[2:09:51] dedicate this temple to you Lord. We
[2:09:55] dedicate this temple Lord.
[2:10:00] Let your glory fill. Let it fill your
[2:10:04] sanctuary.
[2:10:10] Be
[2:10:10] enthroned in the
[2:10:14] praise of your people.
[2:10:20] Lord, we agree.
[2:10:23] In what? In unity. In unity.
[2:10:28] Everybody now. This is your house. This
[2:10:33] is your house. Father, come and
[2:10:40] dwell. This is your
[2:10:43] house, oh Lord
[2:10:46] God. A holy house of
[2:10:51] prayer where the lost and the
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:56] lonely remember. Yes.
[2:11:00] All your cares. This is your
[2:11:06] house. This is your
[2:11:11] house. Father, come and dwell.
[2:11:15] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:11:19] Holy Spirit. Holy
[2:11:21] Spirit overflow. Overflow this place.
[2:11:26] Oh granted our God. Oh
[2:11:30] decorate our
[2:11:32] homes with grace with mercy.
[2:11:39] Let healing and let healing and
[2:11:43] redemption find search.
[2:11:50] Lord, have your way. Have your way.
[2:11:54] Thank you, Jesus. We
[2:11:56] humbly praise you, Lord. This is your
[2:12:01] house, oh God. We dedicate our lives,
[2:12:04] Father. Our bodies and lives are so
[2:12:09] warm. This is your house. Hallelujah
[2:12:13] Jesus. Thank you
[2:12:15] Lord. Holy house of
[2:12:20] prayer where the lost and the
[2:12:25] lonely bring your burdens to him and all
[2:12:29] your cares visit your house.
[2:12:36] This is your house. This is your
[2:12:41] house. Amen.
[2:12:47] And we're going to have you, if you
[2:12:50] would, to just lay your hand over on the
[2:12:52] person standing there by you on the
[2:12:54] shoulder. Take him by the hand. If you
[2:12:56] don't feel comfortable, if it's a sister
[2:12:57] or whatever, you can move if you'd like.
[2:13:00] Jesus said, "These signs shall follow
[2:13:03] them that believe.
[2:13:05] If you notice, he didn't just limit it
[2:13:07] to the
[2:13:09] preachers. Only God knows how many sick
[2:13:11] are here today. Maybe how many weary.
[2:13:15] Maybe some of you that are facing
[2:13:17] decisions in your life and you feel the
[2:13:20] spirit of God spoke to you this morning
[2:13:22] from what you heard. Now remember,
[2:13:25] Brother Michael and I did not sit down
[2:13:27] and talk together. Now, Brother Michael
[2:13:28] preached this, preach that, preach
[2:13:30] something else. But I know as the
[2:13:33] pastor, God used our brother here today
[2:13:37] to speak the very secrets of people's
[2:13:41] hearts. That's the discernment I believe
[2:13:43] in in this hour. The word is a
[2:13:47] discerner. Let's just pray for each
[2:13:49] other, shall we?
[2:13:51] Heavenly Father, as your prophet would
[2:13:53] have the people to do this multiple
[2:13:55] times and he would say eagle to eagle,
[2:13:59] believer to
[2:14:01] believer, Lord God, you see the needs of
[2:14:04] your children today. Hundreds of your
[2:14:06] people gathered here in this place. We
[2:14:09] believe that you've spoken to us. Lord,
[2:14:12] you spoke to me. I believe that you
[2:14:15] spoke to many, many more.
[2:14:17] Oh Jesus, we as American citizens, for
[2:14:21] those of us who are as our brother
[2:14:23] brought it so beautifully to us, Lord,
[2:14:26] our Declaration of Independence and
[2:14:28] Lord, our Bill of Rights and all that's
[2:14:31] given to us as believers, it parallels
[2:14:34] spiritually of what you've done for us.
[2:14:37] Oh God, I pray for your children today.
[2:14:40] Lord, in the name of Jesus, for those
[2:14:43] who are sick and need healing in their
[2:14:45] body, those who are oppressed of the
[2:14:47] devil, we say to your enemy and our
[2:14:51] enemy, take your hands off of God's
[2:14:54] property in the name of Jesus, sickness
[2:14:58] and disease and anxiety and suicide, may
[2:15:02] it leave the children of God right now
[2:15:05] in the name of Jesus Christ. Father,
[2:15:08] maybe there's some here today and
[2:15:10] they've tried and tried to press through
[2:15:12] and they just can't break it. But may
[2:15:15] the chain be broken right here today in
[2:15:18] the presence of Almighty God. Father, we
[2:15:21] pray for one another. Lord, for the
[2:15:23] young, for the elderly, for the sick,
[2:15:25] for the weary, whatever they are. We
[2:15:28] don't want to just limit it now to the
[2:15:29] visible audience, but for those who have
[2:15:31] streamed, those who go back and archive.
[2:15:34] Lord, may the power of God just fill
[2:15:36] their car so much they'll have to pull
[2:15:38] over on the side of the road while the
[2:15:41] anointing of the Holy Ghost comes inside
[2:15:43] their car, inside their home, inside
[2:15:46] their office. Lord Jesus, you see your
[2:15:49] bride has so many needs in this hour.
[2:15:52] May the glory of God overshadow the
[2:15:55] earth. Minister to the needs of your
[2:15:58] wife, heavenly father. Heal those that
[2:16:00] are sick. Deliver those that are bound.
[2:16:03] Oh granted I pray father in the name of
[2:16:07] the Lord Jesus Christ and the saints of
[2:16:10] God said thank you.
[2:16:13] Hallelujah. Oh we worship you Lord
[2:16:16] Jesus. Can we just lift our hands now in
[2:16:19] the presence of our great
[2:16:21] king. Whatever you had need of just tell
[2:16:24] him I receive it right now Lord. I
[2:16:27] receive healing of this cancer in my
[2:16:30] body this tumor. Whatever it is, in the
[2:16:33] name of Jesus, may it leave my body
[2:16:35] right now in Jesus Christ's name. Praise
[2:16:39] the Lord. Praise the
[2:16:42] Lord. Hallelujah. We worship you, Lord
[2:16:46] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:50] Hallelujah.
[2:16:52] Whatever's on your heart. Amen. Praise
[2:16:55] be to God. Don't you love him today,
[2:16:57] saints? What an honor it is for us to be
[2:17:00] together in the presence of God.
[2:17:06] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[2:17:09] Lord. Praise the Lord. We say to our
[2:17:13] guests today, brothers and sisters, we
[2:17:15] thank you for staying over different
[2:17:17] ministers I know that's here today. And
[2:17:19] I was thinking as our brother was
[2:17:21] speaking about things that bring us
[2:17:22] together and the school from from
[2:17:26] Cloverdale had brought uh many of these
[2:17:28] people here this weekend and they come
[2:17:30] together for what purpose to be able to
[2:17:32] see their children be able to graduate
[2:17:34] and give their appreciation to the
[2:17:37] teachers and all that. But I was
[2:17:39] thinking what a greater thing we have to
[2:17:42] come together the revealed word of this
[2:17:45] hour that God has given us. And we will
[2:17:48] fight for our
[2:17:51] rights.
[2:17:53] Amen.
[2:17:56] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. All we can
[2:18:00] do is pray for our Canadian brothers and
[2:18:02] sisters that maybe they'll become our
[2:18:04] 51st state. A minute. I'm just saying,
[2:18:07] you know,
[2:18:09] just Amen. It breaks your heart as an
[2:18:13] American citizen to see what our nation
[2:18:16] was and what it has become.
[2:18:20] I pray to God that one day we don't look
[2:18:22] back with regret and look at our message
[2:18:25] and say, "This is what we had 30 years
[2:18:28] ago, 40 years ago, and look at what we
[2:18:31] are now. We're worldly. We're powerless.
[2:18:34] We're this or that. God forbid that that
[2:18:36] ever happens. God forbid that that ever
[2:18:39] happens. It's up to us whether it does
[2:18:41] or not. It's totally up to us as the
[2:18:44] people of God. What do we want it to be?
[2:18:48] To me, we'll still need the same power.
[2:18:50] We still need the same resurrection, the
[2:18:52] same Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you.
[2:18:56] Harry, sing something for us. Let's just
[2:18:58] sing a little bit before we go. There's
[2:19:00] two times that a preacher wants to
[2:19:01] preach. That's when a preacher gets up
[2:19:03] and can't preach. when a preacher gets
[2:19:05] up and can preaches something. You know
[2:19:07] which one that was today. Thank you,
[2:19:08] brother Michael. God bless you. We're so
[2:19:11] appreciate you being
[2:19:14] here. Praise the
[2:19:17] Lord. Amen. God bless you. I give myself
[2:19:21] away. Yes, Lord. Let's just sing this
[2:19:25] before we go, can we?
[2:19:28] I give myself away.
[2:19:32] So you there's anything you
[2:19:35] can't I give myself away.
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:40] I don't have much Lord. You can take it,
[2:19:43] Father. I give myself
[2:19:47] away so
[2:19:49] you can use me. Here I am. Here I am.
[2:19:57] Here I stand.
[2:20:01] Lord, my
[2:20:04] life is
[2:20:06] in your
[2:20:09] hand. Lord, I'm
[2:20:14] going to
[2:20:18] see your
[2:20:21] desires
[2:20:23] revealed in
[2:20:25] me. I give myself
[2:20:29] [Laughter]
[2:20:31] [Applause]
[2:20:34] away. I give myself
[2:20:38] away so
[2:20:40] you can use me. I give myself
[2:20:51] away. I give myself away.
[2:20:56] know
[2:20:57] you can use me. Take my
[2:21:03] heart. Take my
[2:21:08] life as a
[2:21:12] livinging sacriice.
[2:21:17] Oh
[2:21:23] my. Oh yes Lord
[2:21:27] I place him
[2:21:30] in your
[2:21:33] hands. I give myself
[2:21:41] away. I give myself away.
[2:21:46] Oh,
[2:21:47] you can use me. I give myself
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:21:57] away. I give myself
[2:22:01] away so
[2:22:04] you can use
[2:22:06] [Music]
[2:22:08] me. My life is not my own.
[2:22:13] To you I
[2:22:16] belong. Lord I give myself I give
[2:22:21] myself to
[2:22:23] you. Oh my life is not my
[2:22:29] own to you. I
[2:22:32] belong. Lord I give myself. Amen. I give
[2:22:36] myself. Mean it with all your heart as
[2:22:39] we sing it.
[2:22:41] Hallelujah. is not mine. My life is not
[2:22:45] mine, Lord Jesus. You I
[2:22:49] belong. I give myself. I give myself to
[2:22:55] you. I give myself away.
[2:23:00] Hallelujah. Make your offering to him
[2:23:02] this morning. Raise your hands there.
[2:23:06] Give Jesus the offering of yourself.
[2:23:10] He don't want your money. He don't want
[2:23:13] your car. He wants
[2:23:15] you. Give yourself to it.
[2:23:20] Oh, grab it, Lord God. Give myself
[2:23:24] away so
[2:23:26] you can use me. I give
[2:23:31] myself away.
[2:23:36] Lord, I don't know how much more life I
[2:23:38] have left over. How much strength I
[2:23:41] have, God, but I give it to you. Take
[2:23:45] me, Lord. Take every person
[2:23:50] here for granted.
[2:23:53] Lord, I give myself
[2:23:58] away. So
[2:24:00] you can
[2:24:02] use
[2:24:05] me. Our
[2:24:07] father, we thank you for this
[2:24:10] weekend. We're so grateful that we could
[2:24:13] be able to spend time
[2:24:15] together. Some of these graduates, Lord,
[2:24:18] the farthest traveled was a family from
[2:24:20] New
[2:24:21] Zealand, some from the east, some from
[2:24:24] out west, some from Canada, different
[2:24:27] places. For some of them, it was the
[2:24:29] first time in life they had ever met.
[2:24:34] And in my mind, I think of what your
[2:24:36] prophet
[2:24:37] said. One of these days,
[2:24:41] hallelujah, we will get together with
[2:24:44] the rest of the group and we will come
[2:24:47] up missing on the earth.
[2:24:49] the resurrection will take place. And he
[2:24:52] he called it a sweep that would come
[2:24:55] over us and in a moment we'll be changed
[2:24:58] and we're getting together with the rest
[2:25:01] of the
[2:25:02] group, Lord. People that we've never
[2:25:05] met, people that we've not even known in
[2:25:08] life, but we're getting together in
[2:25:10] another dimension. And he said, we come
[2:25:13] up missing on the earth. Then we know it
[2:25:18] won't be long. We'll be traveling like a
[2:25:22] salt. Father, may there not be a one of
[2:25:24] us missing, Lord. Oh, we believe that's
[2:25:28] a prayer that's according to your word.
[2:25:29] For every name is written in that lamb's
[2:25:32] book of life. Not a one has ever been
[2:25:34] taken out, or shall they ever be. We may
[2:25:38] never gather again quite like this, but
[2:25:41] Lord Jesus, we're longing for that time
[2:25:44] when we'll gather together up at your
[2:25:46] house. Go with those, Father, that'll be
[2:25:49] traveling back, flying, driving,
[2:25:51] whatever they will be. Give them of your
[2:25:53] traveling mercy until we meet together
[2:25:56] again, if not in this life, before your
[2:25:59] throne, Lord. Granted, I pray in the
[2:26:02] name of
[2:26:03] Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Would you
[2:26:06] just turn around, shake hands with
[2:26:08] somebody, two or three people around you
[2:26:09] there, it's been good to be in the house
[2:26:11] of the
[2:26:13] Lord. Amen. God bless
[2:26:17] you. God bless each of
[2:26:19] you. Thank you for coming and spending
[2:26:22] this time with us here in Tennessee.
[2:26:25] We're so grateful to have all of
[2:26:28] you. Sing again, every whatever is on
[2:26:30] your heart. God bless you. Let's sing
[2:26:32] together as we go and you'll be
[2:26:34] dismissed in the fear of God.
[2:26:38] Come. Hallelujah. Sweet Jesus. Yes,
[2:26:42] Lord.
[2:26:43] Come take me away.
[2:26:49] I really don't belong here
[2:26:53] now. I want to see your face.
[2:27:02] Come sweet

[2:27:24] to come.

[2:28:06] Lord. Jesus, come
[2:28:12] today. Lord, you made me
[2:28:17] happy. And Lord, you've been so good.
[2:28:25] Lord, you turn my life
[2:28:29] around when I didn't think you
[2:28:35] could. Now I love this life of
[2:28:41] mine. I love each passing
[2:28:46] day. Oh, but with every breath I
[2:28:52] take inside my heart I
[2:28:57] say. Oh,
[2:29:00] come sweet
[2:29:04] Jesus. Take me from this
[2:29:09] place. I really don't belong here now.
[2:29:17] I want to see your
[2:29:20] face. Oh,
[2:29:24] come sweet
[2:29:27] Jesus. Come take me
[2:29:33] away. I really want to see you,
[2:29:39] Lord. Jesus come today.
[2:29:46] Lord, we are your
[2:29:50] people preparing now to
[2:29:56] be the bride pure and
[2:30:01] holy for all the world to see.

[2:30:13] angels, take us all
[2:30:19] away to the place that you've
[2:30:24] prepared a
[2:30:27] neverending
[2:30:29] day. Glory cry
