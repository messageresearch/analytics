the order of the service I had this old old song on my heart and I thought we might sing it tonight as brother Donnie would come out Jesus is the sweetest name I know you know they tell you in sales if you meet someone remember their name people love hearing their name you tell them their name so I tell you there's there's one name that's the sweetest name I know tonight that's Jesus oh Jesus is

yes Jesus is the sweetest name I know and and he's just the same as his lovely name and that's the reason why love him so yes Jesus is the sweetest name I know oh yes Jesus is the [Music] [Applause] sweetest and he's just the same as his lovely name that's the reason why I love him so thank you Lord for Jesus is the sweetest name I know praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus well it's not only his name but it's it's mine yes and yours if you're a part of the Bride it ought to make it even more precious to you should it not that's right let's turn tonight to 1 Corinthians if you would CH 12: 7 greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus trust you're all doing well am has been fighting the devil yes am's been winning okay good praise the Lord you're winning that's good if he's fighting you it means he ain't got you yet and you also need to let know every day he ain't going to get you either CU you're a son or daughter of God you're already an overcomer by the grace and the mercy of the Lord 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all now we're going to speak tonight the Lord willing on the gifts of the Spirit now listen why they are gift the manifestation of the spirit manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit and it's not p r o p h t but profit and that is to make something grow or as you understand in a business you don't start a business so you can do it for charity you don't start a business so you can lose money you start it so you can make money well when God gives spiritual ual gifts they're to be a profitable spiritual endowment so God wants it to profit very first verse but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom now this is not Rama but logos the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts plural of healing so there's not just one there's multiple Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles now not believing in Miracles but actually the working of Miracles is given to some people so God in them will have them to lay their hands on people or sometimes just to speak to them and tell them be healed receive your healing whatever it is and that is a working of Miracles now notice how that he identifies every one of these is given by the spirit of God they're not man-made we don't learn them we don't wish we had them and try to get them ourselves to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits notice now it's not the word commonly used discernment but Discerning of spirits keep it in its proper connotation and it brings a whole new meaning to it to another the Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues now diverse means variegated it's many different kinds so it would be languages both human and Angelic so it's diverse kinds of tongues so that's given to People by the spirit of God to another the interpretation of tongues I love verse 11 but all these workers that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so it's not according to the people who receive them by their will but according to the spirit of God and the church said amen praise the Lord I wonder how many's got a request on your heart tonight that you'd like to signify or i' hold that request on your heart also like to remember brother Michael Carter in prayer and uh heard from him today and he's having to take some treatments some radiation in his back it took some last week and some more this week so we want to remember our brother that our father would just move for him and his great time of need also have some prayer claes here tonight as well Lord Jesus we count it such an honor that we could be assembled here tonight father in your presence and not only just with you because we could have actually gathered in your presence in our bedroom or in our closet at home or in our living room but there's something about us being able to gather together with people of like Precious face and we're grateful that we have that opportunity Lord that we can do so we pray father that we would take advantage of it every time that we can to be able to come and may we cherish it may we love it and just the prophet said that his people at his church loved one another so much at a certain time frame there that they went through at the brandham Tabernacle and when it would come to closing out the service and them leaving they would just grab one another and weep after the Sunday service because it would be till Wednesday before they'd be able to see one another again they had such love for each other I pray father that you'd help us Lord that we could feel that way about one another father that we could so love each other and realize that we are not complete without our brothers and sisters not only in our local assembly but of those of like Precious Faith around the world even those that are in the sixth Dimension as well father you saw the hands that were uplifted the request what they had on their heart Lord I pray over them I pray over these prayer claws dear God you see what they're going for in the name of Jesus would you move and meet these needs help me tonight Lord as I look into your word help me to be able to move aside and speak through me the words of life I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints you may be seated and believes in the gifts of the Spirit oh my mic must have cut out on me how many believes in the gifts of the Spirit I do oh okay all right that's that's I thought that's what yall should be doing raising your hands you know the gifts are a very difficult and touchy thing sometimes really in some ways it shouldn't be and then in other ways you think that it's pretty inevitable that it's going to be there's very few things given to us by God that have been so controversial down Through the Ages Grace has been argued about uh Mercy has been argued about who would get it and how far could you go or you couldn't get any more of it you know and all that uh but when it really comes down to a lot of the um Charisma type of things which is where the Greek word comes from the word gift Charisma which is charismatic it's been one of the most controversial things that God gave to the New Testament Church sad in one way yet you can see why that Satan would want to attack them now these gifts that we're that we've just read about tonight are different than the ministerial gifts which are offices which is not the same thing as the gifts of the Spirit the word here spirit is Numa Numa and it's a word that we get those of you that are familiar with pneumatic tools this is the Greek word that it comes from Numa so pneumatic it's a tool that is used for for something and the Greek word there is a gift as God gives to people to minister inside the body so we know of course that the five full ministry that's what they are but they too are a gift and it's no wonder why then really that Satan of all the messages that have been down through time that Satan in the last greatest message would try to attack the use the benefit whether it's even needed or not of the fivefold ministry and it would be the message of restoration that he wants to do it well to me that proves that it's very very much needful and yet Satan any of God's gifts Satan hates them you have to understand that in the very beginning when God started this New Testament Church that Satan was unclear of what God was going to do the Lord Jesus had given a little bit of word about it but it was still unclear as to what it was going to be now he saw the Lord as he called these Apostles that was a new word entirely new in the New Testament never used in the Old Testament so he called them Apostles and he called them disciples the word disciple was not so much a new one uh because some of the rabbis had also used a similar word in the Greek language in the Aramaic so so it was a similar word but Satan was totally caught off guard that the Lord Jesus had said I've chosen you and you are to be my Apostles and Satan thought wow Apostles I like it so what what's this all mean I don't know exactly what he's doing here this is something totally new and he could see then that when Jesus sent him out in Matthew 10 and he sent him out by twos and that Jesus had given them power and authority to be able to heal the sick cast out devils and Satan saw that there was something different about this power that were given to these men now you've heard it preached before and it's in the in the New Testament the word the Greek word exusia and then also dunamus now dunamus is something that you have by inherit nature but exusia is something that's given to you by someone who is above you and they delegate to you an element of of authority to do these certain things so you're not doing it because you have an inherit nature you're doing it because your boss said you could do it so that's exactly what Jesus did in Matthew 10 so Jesus gives them exusia Authority and said go heal the sick go cast out Devils they were not born again now they did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's under the exusia order that false anointed ones are able to do the same thing in this day not that it is an inherit Nature by a new birth or a nature change so Jesus sent them out and they did it now Satan was learning so he thought my this this is incredible so they can go out and actually do the same things that he did but they don't have the same thing he has how can that work excuse you delegated authority so he could see that the the apostles were gifted above the other people now remember in that original 12 was Judas es scariot Simon's son and Jesus said have not I chose 12 of you and one of you is a devil but remember in the church book The Prophet lays it out for us that Judas Ministry was not weaker nor was it inferior to the other 11 so one's a devil and 11 more are elected but yet looking at them and judging them by miraculous maybe even by understanding because Judas shared a certain knowledge of the message of the day so no doubt Judas could preach and talk talk about reconciliation Redemption Grace you know whatever more that the rest of the Apostles preach Judas could preach it and he wouldn't have to take a backseat to none of them he could heal the sick cast out Devils whatever they would do and the Devils Jesus said I beheld Satan as Lightning cast down out of heaven and the disciples come back and rejoice in Matthew 10 because the Devils were subject to them Judas was rejoicing right along with him so there was a devil casting out Devils but he didn't do it under the anointing or under his nature he done it under exusia Authority oh you're quiet on me that but now think Judas rejoiced as well because he had spoke to them devils and them Devils had left people but he didn't do it because of his nature he did it because Jesus gave him the the authority to do so so he was gifted he was called he was anointed and he was a devil he shared knowledge of the Mysteries of the kingdom of God and he was still a devil but the Lord chose to start out the New Testament was something totally different than the old now remember he chose a priesthood in the beginning actually it was to be under the abrahamic Covenant that God would allow the firstborn son and he would be the priest inherit he would be the one that would go to God then it would be the father and then of course God substituted the tribe of Levi and let them be the ones that would be the priest so it was automatic if you daddy was a priest you're going to be one your son's going to be one it was handed down from one generation to another to another but God said I'm not doing that in the New Testament in the New Testament all of my men will receive a personal call from me cuz your daddy's a preacher don't mean you're supposed to be one right that's right because every God call man now some people think their preachers when they're not every preacher is not a godall man amen that's right but God calls every individual that's going to preach the gospel God himself calls them they don't go by a feeling they don't go by a dream they don't go by well I've had this told to me my goodness I don't know how many times over the decades brother Donnie I I I I was reading my Bible before church and you or or My Pastor got up and preached for the same thing I felt like I'm called to preach and I tell them all the same story that same situation happens to my wife and I know she ain't called although she was called out in Pentecost by preachers who had discernment and told her she was called to preach she was also called out by another preacher in Pentecost who supposedly had discernment and he told her she had cancer I'll tell you what that preacher was anointed with demons no doubt that man was sincere but he was anointed with a demon out of hell to try to get my wife to accept that but she refused it that's what you need to do when preachers call you out and tell you things that are contrary to the word amen praise the Lord would stop some of this stuff if we' do it well how in the world will I get off on that oh my now watch what God is going to do is going to be totally different than the levitical order totally different than what God had done for thousands of years dealing with Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph then on down then it would come to the patriarchal Avenue then it would come to the levitical order but God interrupted all of that now he called Peter and Peter was married we don't know if Peter had children or not but if they were there's none of them by name that's been given that after Peter passed away then his son got the keys that wasn't the way God done it so Paul was not even a married man so there was no Apostolic succession in the way that it was in the Old Testament so God now is going to do the ministration of the New Testament totally by Divine gifts now those Divine gifts will not come by mother wanting her son to be a preacher it will not come by a grandfather and he has this certain special favorite grandson and he just knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that that grandson's going to be a preacher and he starts telling him from the time he's five or six years old you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a preacher you're going to be a preacher there's been many a person that has put their grandson or their son under a absolute torment for years of their life when God never called them but mama daddy grandpa grandma told them there's going to be a preacher come on now don't get quiet on me but you know what if God himself don't call you forget it for those of you that attended brother Lewis La Funeral Service you heard a little excerpt of a clip that was played in 1961 that was whenever his parents took him and his brother Johnny to the Tabernacle and brother brandham prayed over them and referred to them as little preachers or something like that you know brother Lewis that that taunted our brother tormented him for years and he come to me and said brother Donnie if I fail God if I miss god brother Brandon prayed over me or said those words over me that I miss somehow God I said brother Lewis if you would study dedications the way I have over the years you would find out nine times out of 10 when a boy was coming up to be dedicated brother Brandon would pray or hope or ask God to make him a preacher you know why ca to him that could be one of the greatest things that God could do for a man so that lets you know these anti- preachers belong that say they believe the message don't brother random wanted his own boys to be called to be preachers cuz to him that was the highest order that there was pressing play is Antichrist to say that replaces God's gifts well you might as well go ahead and get with me now I'm going to have church with or without you to say that pressing play does away with God's Ministry is Antichrist you show me where God's Prophet taught it and I'll preach the same thing but until you do I'm going to blast that demonic devil out of the pits of hell because that's where it comes from it's not Apostolic it's not according to the message it's from hell I'll tell you the devil would like nothing better for every God called preacher to sat down and stop preaching and press play and Press Play service I your service if I feel led to play a tape I will feel led by the spirit of God I don't have a headquarters that tells me what tape to play I don't have a headquarters or a bishop over our church come on somebody a nicolate and spirit that sends out a text and says we're playing this at a certain certain time I don't get those texts I get my inspiration from the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that hears you cry and pray and here's you and your wife discussing certain things and the same Holy Ghost will anoint me to get up and preach the very same thing you all talked about well come on somebody that's the God I'm serving tonight and I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever well praise the Lord now the Lord Jesus was the one who decided to set the order of of the church and he chose the apostolic order the apostolic order so he would choose the apostles first he did not choose pastors first he did not choose evangelists he did not even choose prophets first as far as major Church AIDS Messengers he could have chose Paul first if he had wanted to Paul was on the earth that was not the order the order is going to be Apostolic order which is what Satan is against in and around this message so what Satan wants to do is replace Jesus on choice and I remember the people around the message who fight preachers they're not they're not fighting me they're not fighting these preachers here in the church they're actually fighting the Lord Jesus himself well good luck with that is all I can say he was the one who chose to make it this way if you don't like him go to him and complain about him and get off of my back about it okay just go to the man himself and say Jesus I don't like it because you chose preachers I just don't like it well that's what he chose and others might say I don't like speaking in tongues and I don't like that well that's your problem the Lord Jesus is the one who said these things in the church and Word of Life said oh my brother Donnie I've had a lot our problems with the gift and I've seen a lot of this that and the other so have I but that don't change God's word come on somebody there ain't no need for us to hide behind scarecrows and say well this and your claim that they spoke in tongues and this and said this and that I'll tell you one thing I don't even want nothing to do why in the world would we not want anything to do with God's word praise the Lord now in this in the office calls a person the prophet tells us could actually have more than one call in his life well it's the same way with the spiritual dispensing now what it is it's like the seven rainbow colors the seven Church AG Messengers all dealing with the church comes through sevens and fives and it's like the spirit of God can give a man like Paul dealt with him when he said that if there's someone that speaks in tongues and the church if there is no interpreter then let them hold their peace so it would be as if though you know I get done preaching here tonight and someone would stand up and start speaking in tongues and oh my it might really genuin be the Holy Ghost and they are so fired up and so charged up you know but there's nobody to interpret so people just leave and you know it kind of gets really quiet and creates that odd something that it always does and then you think okay what what's supposed to happen here well according to what Paul said that individual unless there be an interpreter is to hold her peace amen is that right now unless Paul said that they should pray that they could interpret themselves so then a person could have speaking in tongues and they could also have the ability to interpret their tongues but if they only have speaking in tongues then their speaking in tongues must be coupled together in order to be used by God in the ministry of the Church they need another person to work together with them to make their gift complete you that you understand that so speaking in tongues it's awesome it's wonderful so you're alone with God you're praying you know you're going down the road or whatever it is you might even come up around the Altar and you're just praying and boy you're just having a blessed wonderful time but you know what those tongues are not for interpretation if there's no interpreter there or you yourself do not interpret now watch let's go back through this again in verse 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so the manifestation of the gifts are not to make some uh more known than others the manifestation of the gifts are not to make some more popular more famous it has nothing to do with making you and I anything but subject Ive servants to the will of God now this is one thing I look for in gifted people is what do they do with these gifts do they use them in such a way that always points these fingers right like this praise the Lord do they have a problem with pointing to other gifted people people as well as thems or are their gifts always superior their miracles are more miraculous which I'm not sure how that works exactly their Divine healings are more Divine now you see I have a problem with that attitude now I know some of the message people don't want to hear it but that's a straight up Pentecostal that's all it is it's just outright flesh that is contrary to the Bible we do believe the Bible around in here right but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the Spirit by the spirit the word of wisdom the word of wisdom now notice this is the most Superior gift of all nine huh I mean I kind of thought that it'd be a little bit quiet in here tonight but I didn't realize you could hear a mouse walking across cotton balls notice this the prophet said love God's love it'll take to place of speaking in tongues and that's all right he said it'll take to place of gifts wonders and signs and everything else and if you haven't got love to accompanies that what good do the signs do you God tries to do it across the nation but it wouldn't work the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge well it's apparent from a lot of what I've seen not only just in Pentecost but in the ranks of the message that the three on the the bottom of the list are the ones that so many people want which shows they don't have number one yet now you can do whatever you want to with my words okay just you know just do whatever you want to with my words but if I were you I would be careful when I'm reading scripture and reading from a Vindicated prophet's message now what so the greatest one then is wisdom the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge if you haven't got knowledge you haven't got wisdom how to control your knowledge what Good's your knowledge going to do you see what I mean seek the first things first wow so we're at the bottom seeking for the bottom first or the ones on the bottom the last of the list are the things that are deemed so super spiritual and wisdom the first how many sermons you ever heard preached on it oh it's getting warm in here ain't it man oh my we've gone after gifts we've gone after this we've gone after that because the supernatural was done but brother don't seek gifts don't seek favor with denomination you imagine putting that in the same sentence seek the love of God do it Brethren now brother Donnie are you saying then that we should not absolutely have no gifts no I'm not saying that at all I'm saying there's a proper order by which we seek them I believe if we would have perfect love perfect love would produce perfect gifts as a matter of fact I just quoted to you a quote I didn't give you the city in the day but perfect love would produce perfect gifts so what then will we have if we have imperfect love nine times out of 10 imperfect gifts which the prophet said can be questioned which will cause problems which is probably what a lot of us have seen through the years that's why somebody quiet on my that you've been burnt by them now if you'll notice the routine of the gifts again he says the first is a gift of wisdom thank you the first is the gift of wisdom that is the best gift of the group anybody here tonight know what the gift of wisdom is if we don't have wisdom we don't know how to use knowledge now watch he goes again in this same thinking is the second gift and we can't use the second gift without wisdom how we going to use the last gift interpretation or next to the last speaking in tongues our Zeal has eat up our wisdom so our Zeal for the gifts has eat up our wisdom wiom which is the best one of all praise the Lord now I've heard it through the years and I'm sure we'll continue to hear it that Brothers have said well you know brother brandham taught those things and that was for his church only and all of that and our church is Sovereign and at our church we're going to do it this way and that way I I want someone here or someone that'll hear this to show me where any church in this message has the right to claim sovereignty over God's word if you are saying you are sovereign over God's word you are a you are a prosper stitute you are committing fornication with the devil you show me where God's Prophet ever said any church including his own had sovereignty over the word of God friends that's what the Catholic Church does they say the Bible don't matter the denomination say it don't matter don't you understand where the message people are going many of them they're claiming sovereignty over scripture or sovereignty over the teaching of the message of the hour well we know the prophet we know the prophet Tau that we know he Tau it but this is the way we do it at our church but it ain't the way we're going to do it at ours not as long as I'm the pastor anyhow our sovereignty comes in under the headship of the word of God not against it well praise the Lord oh Jesus here we go y'all going to stand with me now right hey I'm taking my stem of the word will you taken yours now notice he says our Zeal has eat up our wisdom and our Zeal for our denominations and our enthusiasm has eat up the wisdom off the vine Brotherly Love now let's go back to where Paul says this in verse 8 for to one is given by the spirit the word the logos of wisdom let's look at the meaning of this word Sophia Sophia Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God it ain't no wonder that takes precedence over speaking in tongues so would the Supreme intelligence of God ever lead any of us to step over the top of the word of God or the word of the message of the hour it proves we're lacking wisdom when we think that we are superior and our understanding to the seventh Church age messenger we lack wisdom amen we need more Sophia praise the Lord Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God the wisdom of God as events in forming and executing counsels in the formation and government of the world and the scriptures so the first thing Paul said now before you all start focusing on tongues interpretation prophecy all that first get wisdom so you'll understand how in the formation of these gifts disciplinary action how you going to deal with them this is why we've got a lot of the stuff we've got people hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss and if you call them on the carpet they get mad and leave oh my don't tell me I dealt with that when I first came to Happy Valley years ago some of You original people that was there when I came there things that was going on things being said thus sayith the Lord this thus sayith the Lord that well whenever I was visiting as a visiting Minister I didn't say nothing about it but when you all voted me in and the deacons told you all brother Donnie will not be able to be run brother Donnie will not be able to be controlled so they give you a heads up for you newcomers is come in well you come in after the ship done already sailed so that was the oses that I took this church I could be led by the spirit of God preach the word of God is that right some of You original ones is that right is that what you were told and look do we want to change from that now because we're all these years later down the road do we want to say well look at what is goddess it's brought us a lot of trouble it has caused us trouble but it's brought us a lot of Supernatural too it's brought us a lot of Miracles and it's brought us a lot of healing it's brought us a lot of Joy it's done a lot of great things for us I'll choose that that way myself now notice the importance and the value of wisdom so this now it's not man-made wisdom and it's not the wisdom that comes with old age by being around a long time you know and you get you get wisdom and there's there's some folks in I took the church years and years ago and they come and they sat there for a while but I was way too Pentecostal for him and too fiery and this and that and the other so a couple of them come to me and say brother Donnie we love you and you're really anointed and we I I knew exactly I always wait for that one word But but so they lay all the butter on then they drag out the butcher knife you know and well you're this and you're that but you know but brother Donnie you know you're you're young and and we like a man with a with gray in his hair oh if they' waited around a little while that would have showed up too oh but you know we want this and man with wisdom and people think because somebody's old that they got wisdom some of the dumbest people I ever dealt with in my life is old people well Hallelujah you you young people can say amen for a few years can't you come on brother Malachi say amen for me buddy you know a lot of time people think glory to God I tell one thing I've been around forever in a day we can tell it too don't mean they got a lick of wisdom this wisdom is not brought on by age God gives this in his body I think we need more more men of God to seek God for this gift right here our churches would be run different some of our meetings would be run different oh come on I feel like having church tonight preachers need wisdom pastors need wisdom evangelists need wisdom the ministry needs wisdom to know how to run special meetings to know how to run youth camps to know how to counsel people to know how to lead the people of God oh you don't know how much I pray for it constantly because sometimes I get hit with situations and I get caught right in the middle of situations and I've seen it so many times that de the devil loves to slam my back against the wall and if I go this way he's caught me if I go this way and say well it's this way or that way and the devil loves to stand right thr he poin his finger at me say ahuh I've got you now you know I always tell him uhuh devil I'd like to remind you of this situation and that situation and that situation and you know what he has to do stick his tail between his legs and go back down to Hell like a little beat down pup why because wisdom is here among us if we will only ask almighty God for it I don't need just knowledge knowledge I thank God for knowledge and I still got a pretty good memory I thank God for the ability to study but I do not just need knowledge I need Divine wisdom I need the wisdom of God to know how to run this church I've been pastoring for decades but my experience alone will not get us out of here I need the wisdom of God to know what to preach how intensely to say it when to preach this and when to preach that I need the wisdom of God every day of my life to be able to live a life that is pleasing to the Lord I know you pray for me for strength and I appreciate it but add one more thing if you don't mind to that request wisdom wisdom oh my Lord Jesus can you imagine what God would be able to do among us if we would get in the divine order of what he really wants us to have wisdom again let's look at it Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God this B passes our flesh this bypasses Satan can you imagine a Son of God filled with the Holy Ghost has the ability to receive a thought from God a rainbow word from God bypasses his flesh bypasses his Spirit bypasses demons a direct thought from the mind of God on how to do this and how to do that I've seen him do it so many times I always Marvel at it sir oh what a blessed thing it is do we need it friends am notice so the first one wisdom the second notice how it's given for to one by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge look at knowledge now we use this a lot because it's a word that's used a whole lot in the New Testament Noti this the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion but remember this is not by studying it's not by studying this is a gift of the spirit watch this I found this amazing and how the prophet tapped into this about a word of knowledge or I think Pentecost failed well if Pentecost failed how do we figure we're going to better it if we go the same way they did you know what if if we're not careful in 10 or 15 years we're going to say where I think message people failed I don't want them saying that about us friends I don't want them saying that about our church I don't want them saying about that about me brother Dave as a minister as a pastor the of the word of God do you want that said about you I don't he could take the prophets with the gift of knowledge and for show them what was going to be and they can speak it because it's a word of knowledge that God gives to his prophet and he foretells it before it comes to pass because God knows all things I want you to notice how he catches this then that God would bring this gift into the prophets of the Old Testament of course and they were able to foree or for know events that was going to happen thousands of years down the road what was it a word of knowledge now that would have been limited only to the prophets who were so designed that their first conscience and their subconscious was side by side so they could have a dream as we would say with their eyes wide open so they could stand right there and travel dimensionally just like the prophet I see you I see you coming home from school you got on a yellow chicken dress there's a dog at you I see you come up on the porch you fill through the door he could go from where they were backwards he could come to present time and go to the Future and cover a span of 60 70 80 90 years just like that and it was a word of nosis a word of knowledge you see what was it that Peter manifested that day the spirit of God when ananas and Safara had lied and Peter when they come up and Peter said why is Satan putting your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost God dropped that word down inside of Peter now Peter wasn't even a prophet right but he had the Holy Ghost now watch the prophet goes on to say here in person nature of Christianity so God had took Ezekiel high and far up to see round about 2600 years remember Ezekiel Saw the Millennium things that he saw still has not yet happened think of it a prophet is also a gift of knowledge a knowledge like an attorney who studies the books and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're playing paying for what he knows to present your case before the judge wow what a way to explain it a gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which goes up and find out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible That's What We believe a't it notice jump on down there a bit and the prophet goes up and sees sees the time coming see it's only a gift of knowledge that he brings down and puts it on paper so God can allow in the body now remember there's only one for an age a prophet with the sign praise the Lord can God allow people in his body remember this is not just now to to the office Ministry but this is to the body as well my Ministry to lay hands on the sick it's been by Divine gift to bring the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in Presence by discernment of spirit which is called in the Bible a gift of knowledge in doing so makes him manifested before the people then they receive him as their healer and that settles it I've seen Lots called discernment I do not believe in but I know there's truly a Discerning spirit of God the gift of knowledge that calls and speaks and it's perfect five out of five five out of 10 NOP it's perfect every time if it's a gift from God so wisdom is first knowledge is second notice the third to another pistus Faith a conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things generally with the included idea of trust and holy fervor the conviction that God exists and is the Creator and ruler of of all things the provider and bestower of Eternal salvation through Christ now God gives to every man that believes a Measure of Faith but some have this gift of faith which is above the average believer's Measure of Faith to believe that there is a God and that God can heal and God can save and there's a heaven and there's a hell to every believer is given this Measure of Faith to be able to believe God for certain things but to some is given the gift of faith and they by that gift can pray and they can bring the presence of God right down around people other preachers other people may be standing around and praying too but if they don't have that gift that one individual that's got that gift with that fervor and that something and then what does that do it creates more faith because people know God God God mov moves for that man God moves for that man we've all seen it have we not so faith of course this is substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen but here is a special endowment which is what the gifts are a special endowment which is separate from your salvation separate from your new births it is an endowment given by the spirit of God the Charisma given for what purpose to profit the body now where do these gifts belong they don't belong in the White House White House don't want this they don't belong in in the Senate house down in in Nashville where do they belong in the church but let me tell you something we cannot produce these gifts on our own it takes the Holy Ghost to produce them and I want every one of these gifts in our church but we're not going to get them because we are desire spiritual gifts we're going to get them whenever we say God pour out your presence Among Us let it be real Let It Be genuine Lord we don't want no fake we don't want this and that and the other we want the real thing I don't know about you I would like to see all nine manifested in a true right way before God before I leave this world praise the Lord is that asking too much I don't think so this is a portion of the word like Malachi 4 other portion of the word of God to another by The Same Spirit to face to another by The Same Spirit then the gifts of of healing now we know that God loves humanity and he wants people to be healed so much that the prophet said that God heals by love God heals by music God heals by medicine God heals by surgery this is why the prophet prayed for doctors every day that they would find a cure for cancer well praise the Lord if he did that as message followers shouldn't we be doing the same he prayed constantly that God would help him he did not reprimand and rebuke on a Sal for coming up with the polio vaccine he was grateful to God that he let that come upon the Earth is that right but yet here we're talking about an endowment and any of you that's ever been to a doctor or you've ever had a stay in a hospital you know that there are some nurses no doubt that are called to be nurses and they come in and they've just got something about them and they don't just push that needle in your arm they push it in your arm in a different way you know what I'm saying they're just something about it and it's the same about doctors you know as soon as you go in and sit down and you talk to some doctors you know why they are there it's because they've got that big house in the ridges and they know they've got a Porsche car and that their child's got a BMW and they've got this big bank account they've also got a vacation home on Blowing Rock and they've got another vacation home down in Tampa and that's the reason they're a doctor to make all that money and you can tell by their attitude so you're number three 85 get in sit down shut up next one 386 387 the more they get the more payment I get but then you've got others and they are so concerned about you and they're asking how are you and you tell me which is very rare doctors is like preachers they don't want you to tell them nothing but they ask well you tell me how are you doing both carolly and I went to a Cardiologist yesterday well how are you all doing what's going on with y'all how are you been well you tell me if you got any problem s anything going on no no we're doing good we're doing well that's awesome to Carol said you don't even need a cardiologist you don't even need to be here but he was a man that was very caring and you see what that is a person that's called to do it they do some of the same stuff got access to the same scripts and they can write the language you know and all that but there's an attitude that comes with it that you cannot learn at ETSU you've seen nurses and they didn't care a bit more about you they've shown more affection toward a donke than they would a human being and budy they go to drawing blood out of you and it's like they're drawing out of a turnip cuz they slam your arm down there dear God help and that they don't care a bit for you because it's become so common and so cold there're so Pat on you now calm down honey you okay how in the world can they tell we're nervous just because we've got the beads of sweat that big coming out all over our face how do they have that discernment but there is a call it's the same way when it comes to the spirit of God and the way he gives out these gifts so God is looking for people that he can give special endowment to that he knows are not going to take it and lift themsel higher above their Brethren because it's not to profit you it's not to profit me it's not to profit the individual that's got it it's to profit the Church of the Living God God give us people that he can be able to give such things and it'll not go to their head Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another working of Miracles Bo I tell you one thing there's something about the gifts of healing and the work of Miracles now let's just be honest in face facts some of these things are going to be more Visual and they will be more talked about and they will be more desired than the greatest ones which are wisdom and knowledge but yet whenever you look at it if we don't tap into that Avenue first from the top and work our way from the top down to what God wants us to have it's no wonder that we have the stuff that we have working of Miracles to another prophecy prophecy which means what repeating scripture yeah the Lord say I'm here yeah the Lord say I'm going to bless you so what if Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15 would have said yeah the Lord say I'm going to bless y'all I'm so glad Moses didn't believe the Pentecostal version and some of the message version of Prophecy right that's why Moses said behold the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me from among your brethren and he goes on to Define and Define that's prophecy Oh Glory to God y'all get nervous tonight don't be nervous it's good it's good till another Discerning of spirits Discerning of SP Spirits deis discern distinguishing judging I want you to notice what this precedes notice what this proceedes Discerning of spirits then tongues interpretation and prophecy oh my so that's why we need Discerning of spirits is it okay all right now watch the prophet of God is he takes this and he said now question answer say for instance I'm going to say we spoke in tongue somebody that is a gifted bunch of men Leo raised up spoken tongues and a brother here brother Willard give the interpretation all right now I want to say brother Neville and brother juny and brother Willard Collins was the discerners the discerners so does that mean then that brother juny Junior Jackson brother Willard Collins and brother Neville are standing in the church Discerning people you see friend this just absolutely blows me away that we have got message preachers that are putting their own interpretation on this word and will take their own opinion above a Vindicated prophet and if you think brother Bram taught this on in his church I say shame on you for not taking time to sit down and get your computer in your lab and typing it in and find out that he preached It All Over America cuz he was sent to correct the Pentecostals and they refused Elijah's meal offering and now some of the message preachers are refusing Elijah's meal offering too but I want Elijah's meal offering myself cuz God knows I mixed up enough poisonous porridge in my life anybody else say Amen to that I've got enough wild Gorge brother Steve and mixed in a little bit of this and a little bit of that I'm just going to be frank and honest with you tonight I'll be something a lot of preachers won't be I'll be honest I mixed up a lot of pottage and I pulled a lot of gourds and mix this that and the other but thank God for a prophet with enough meal to pour down inside my understanding of predestination and my inside of predestination got healed praise God my insight on women preachers brother Larry got healed yeah cuz I used to preach for women preachers when I was back there in Pentecost I preached eternal hell back there in Pentecost I preached tongues as the evidence back in Pentecost I preach a lot of them things and I did have a little bit of Truth not very much it's very little but once I found Elijah's meal stored up in the last day and begin to pour that on my election it brought my election to a Divine Healing it brought my predestination it brought my my ideology of the godhead oh I tell you friends if you haven't tried it you ought to try it you ought to tried every aspect of your life it'll heal your resentment attitude it'll heal your inability to forgive and love and just have joy in your life every day some of you let the devil Rob you your joy of per of serving God you need to take some of Elijah's meal and pour it in that Joy praise God get up in the morning with a smile on your face with a song in your heart saying out of my way devil I'm serving God today I don't care what's in my path greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Glory so brother Neville brother juny and brother Willard Collins are the discerners so what and who are they Discerning they are Discerning the tongues and the interpretation which came forth so someone spoke in tongues someone interpreted so you've got discerner setting there two or three and they are Discerning that Spirit yes amen then if they agree and said that was the Lord that was the Lord that was the Lord now of course this would make it quite sticky yeah because a prophet would have them to write down this prophecy and bring it to the pull pit and he would read it and then brother Neville's name would be on it brother Collin's name would be honored and whoever someone spoke thus sayith the Lord the tongues interpretation and the discerners all three said it was thus sayith the Lord then of course if it didn't happen public embarrassment a now we want to claim sovereignty don't we our church is above this really so I wonder where what else you'll start being above you see all it takes for a preacher on one little bitty tiny thing to start saying well we don't want that in our church that's not the way we're going to do it you just opened up the floodgates of hell cuz you'll start with one little thing that you think is insignificant then another then another then another and three years from now five years from now what where you going to be at then friends it is so dangerous amen amen oh my right God help us amen now watch the example that a prophet gave describing prophecy Leo spoke and Willard gave the interpretation here and said thus sayeth the Lord Wednesday night there's coming a woman in here she's going to be violent tell brother brandham not to rebuke her because she's insane but but tell him to take her over to the corner because it was in a corner where she did a wicked thing on one time and a certain thing taking place now that sounds very good doesn't it now but the first thing you know in the old scripture no matter what the prophet said or what anybody else said it was tested by the urum Thum first you see where brother random is going with this straight back to the Scriptures it went to the word and if them Li didn't flash then let it alone first thing you know now watch let's take it back to the word this man spoke in tongues sound it all right this one interpret it sounded all right but the word said let it be judged by two or three judges First Take It to the urum Thum now the first thing Willard colins says it was of the Lord juny says it was of the Lord two out of three all right it's put on a piece of paper spoke right out here in the church then when the people who sees it read it notice before it ever happens and then see it happen and they say brother that's God that's what I want in our church yes sir so the spirit of God could speak and say Sunday morning there'll be a man come in dressed like so and so and so and so tell brother Donnie to pray for him he'll have this certain thing his name will be so and so oh you can see why people don't want to do that cuz if they're wrong everybody's going to know they're wrong so what are a lot of our prophecies and our discernments they're so generic that's right even if you miss it you can't prove it wrong cuz I wouldn't want I said no I didn't say it that way no you misunderstood what I said well glory amen hallelujah somebody dial 911 get the ambulances lined up for after church now listen this is the way the prophet the same Prophet that we want to study his quotes and prove without a shadow of doubt that the gifts are supposed to be restored in the last days and yet we won't take his same message and prove how they ought to be restored and how what they ought to be restored to well thank you Jesus but what if it don't happen yes now we're going to get to another thing I could hit right here is all prophecy and interpretations and message prophecy now just a minute now what if it don't happen then Leo has spoken a false spirit Spirit he gave a false interpretation and you gave a false judgment then get that thing out of you that's wrong leave it alone that's it's not just a mistake sir I said it's not just a mistake amen the one who's the author of so many of these hit and misses around our message ranks it's not just mistakes it's demons amen yes sir praise the Lord thank you Lord everybody that gets mad at me now you can line up in line to buy me and Carol steak supper we'll take your name and address after church okay even you online too i' be getting a bunch of gift cards after that woo praise the Lord now watch see that's a regular Saints meeting I think that's what's in the Bible because Paul said if one prophesies and something someone bring prophesied something be revealed to one that's sitting there let him first hold his peace until this one speaks first you may all prophesy one by one that couldn't be in a regular meeting now I find it amazing that preachers will stand up and defy the prophet of God on this teaching I don't care how long you've been preaching what are you want a ribbon a star a button the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ teaching amen am don't smell that is it just me I me I took a shower before I come to church friends let me just tell you as we go on in time we are going to be shocked at people that will turn from this word but don't believe it'll be a total repudiation it will not be a total denial it will be a dissecting that's right come on I want I don't want I want I don't want I want I don't want may God help us amen do you realize when reding in the realm of spiritual gifts the realm realm of demonology lays right there listen to it Harvest Time December 1964 Satan can hand out those Supernatural gifts by the handfuls why because the realm of gifts lays so close to the realm of demonology this is why we needed this kind of te teaching that's right people think brother R was trying to take our Liberty are you kidding me he was sent by God to break them denominational bounds and then he would lead us back into another bondage he's not trying to take our freedom he's trying to keep us from evil spirits now I ask you what was on the preacher that told Carol she was called to preach yes sir what the Holy Ghost what was on the other preacher that told her she had cancer God Don't Lie oh my argue do whatever you want to do but listen Brothers those of you that disagree with me let me just let you know tonight you are not disagreeing with me you are disagreeing with God's Prophet any you in our church that disagree you're not disagreeing with your your pastor you're disagreeing with your Prophet messenger but this is the issue God being misunderstood brother REM says if you Brothers will trust my understanding of the scriptures I'd like to come down and meet with you and we could set these things in order that's the sad part brother Smith some of the preachers in this message have been preaching so long now and they've got so much you know know years behind them that they can question brother brenham's understanding of the scriptures well I hope I don't never live that long I hope if I you know it's amazing a lot of preachers don't mess up in their 30s brother Ron spencon I was telling about it last week lot of preachers don't mess up in their 40s and 50s some do but it's amazing how many preachers it's when they get up in their 60s and 70s when they get their Kingdom secure and they become you know where they can handle the word and they can Venture without Authority and purum I hope and pray to God that if God ever sees I would do such a thing he would take my life amen yes sir and put me in a free mature grave before I would bring reproach on the Lord Jesus amen and his word am and this message and you amen yes people let's stand together now that couldn't be in a regular meeting you know that the gifts now to be sure that it's of God CU if it's just foolishness it ain't of God you mean to tell me there could be tongues and interpretation and even so-called Discerning of spirits that would be nothing but foolishness poor brother Donnie that's scary stuff I know it's scary it's scary both ways it's scary to call something foolish that's God it's just as scary to call something God that's foolishness right brother Rob oh my goodness if it doesn't come to pass it's not of God it's got to come to pass and therefore in our churches oh no oh no oh no not just in my church but in our churches who's here question answer 61 message preachers message churches oh my goodness so brother brandom intended for this to be more than eth in pen Street oh no how terrible how traumatic it that's not the way I look at it I look at it as keeping demons out of our ranks brother Donnie what if it don't happen but four or five times a year by putting them back there I'd rather for it to be real and be four or five times a year than every time we come to church and'll be nothing but flesh yes sir cuz it's only a matter of time that an evil spirit will start saying things initially it'll start out you can't really pinpoint it initially nothing that you can really say is really missing it so generic demons know how to be generic remember each demon has its own personality all of them have it Blended in that personality an element of genericism where they can remain very neutral remember they're the kings of deceivers they know better than to give the very first one to be so far out and so false nobody else that even want to hear it anymore so what do they do it very generic and remember you are dealing with beings that know how to say things in such a way that you can't say it's right or you can't say it's wrong neutral just all neutral and then when he gets the people caught up in it then this will be wrong that'll be wrong oh my goodness friends there's people in our church that have come from churches and told me just a few years ago and people man man that even said under brother brandham himself and yet people getting up and speaking in tongues and prophesying and telling them you've got married the wrong person you need to leave your husband you need to leave your wife telling people to cut their hair you cannot believe all the nonsense and the trash a so-called Message Church of a preacher that brother brandham calls his name on tape that don't mean nothing come on but it starts out oh yes generic generic may God help us as I said I'd rather have it five times a year and it be right than every service hit Miss hit miss a lot of name Prophecy in the first place brother Donnie how can you say that I judge it by the word if it don't tell you what you prayed if it don't tell you what you was thinking about if it don't tell you things that's going to be forget it that's right I said forget it her and I knew a woman Carol knew her well as well an angel of God walked into her room one night handed her a Bible and told her she was called to preach she didn't even know where the Bible come from it was not her Bible it was not her husband's Bible they'd never even seen the Bible and I say angel of God in the sense that it was a created angel of God in the beginning which sold his Birthright and become a demon and this woman started preaching because an angel appeared into her room and called her to preach woo thank God for mercy don't you love him with all your heart how many wants the real me too Church well he said Brother D you think that's going to encourage us to seek after the real if it'll encourage you to seek after anything it'll encourage you to seek after the real there's too much heaven's just full of the real and genuine why do we want to fake we don't want it we want real hey and I was talking about it one time he said you know brother Donnie I've thought about it he said what if the gifted people met in our church and other message churches and that meet Sunday nothing happened then meet Wednesday nothing happened they meet Sunday nothing happened that meet Wednesday nothing happened how many of them would be faithful just to keep on meeting and waiting and praying or whether it say well the Lord don't want us to do it so I guess we'll just be out there in the church we'll just do it this way God will try Us by his word oh I want to be faithful to it don't youen let's bow our heads together praise the Lord oh Lord Jesus Lord I remember when my poor heart finally saw this message of what it was and once I begin to acknowledge and accept brother randam as the seventh angel and a Vindicated messenger of the last day and I listen to the anointed ones at the end time it answered so many questions for me I'd seen men and all the things that they had done and the way that they had lived I just could not understand and Lord I sought when I left Pentecost that I would be free from that but as I was communicating with a brother today from another state and he had a relative in his family that was dying and he told me today that several famous message preachers told him several things concerning this relative and every one of them was wrong even a member of brother Ram's family give him a cloth a blanket to take and lay on this individual and told him that if he'd lay that on him prove for him that'd be well but they died I felt so sorry for the brother and I apologized to him in the text cuz I could just hear it even though it was words I could hear his hurt and I could feel his pain because I know the disappointment that I had and even though we try our best to spare message people of the same disappointment some of them are going headlong right into it and I've done seen it some of them are going to be so stubborn and so hard-headed they will not stop until they make the office mess that ever was and there have to be public acknowledgement there'll have to be public shame and humiliation and they've been El of people that'll be hurt and scarred and then the preachers going to have to answer for all because we step over the teaching of this word forgive us human beings for our hard-headed ways our stubbornness forgive us Lord sometimes I don't know why you even fool with us not just when we're Sinners but after we become saved and even after we've preached for decades and we can get so set in our ways and so stubborn people would just listen to the Harvest Time real well and they'll listen to it very carefully how that Satan moves in that Realm of the supernatural Satan will get a man so caught up and people calling for him to come here and go there and he won't even stop and pray no more they want him so much and he's in such demand Lord God help help me help me Jesus help me to stay true I pray tonight before my church that if you were to see that I would ever head down that pass that I would become stubborn hard-headed cannot be corrected by the word please father take my life please Lord don't allow my my position to bring reproach upon you help me Jesus help me that I can always have a teachable spirit no matter how long I've been preaching how long I've been around the message help me Lord that I can maintain the ability to be able to stand up behind the pulpit and say I was wrong help me to be able to apologize and say I was wrong please forgive me I know it's a rarity among preachers but I want to be that Rare Breed I want to be of that breed that say I exalted myself above the message help us Lord Jesus for I truly believe if you can find men of that caliber we are yet to see the phenomenal and the supernatural help us Lord your Prophet tells us a man sent from God God call man 1958 that you had a Revival that you was going to shake but you'd have to have some men to bring it with men that have been shook to their very core he describes a men that it'll be that you'll use never mention nothing about Pride arrogance stuffed up hard-headed stuff shirt as a matter of fact that's not qualifications but disqualifiers help us Lord I know my people here love me I pray father I can always live a life and preach the gospel in a way where they can continue to do so I pray Lord they wouldn't forget to pray for me I pray that they would not be negligent on their part as the Sheep to pray that God will give me wisdom God will give me knowledge as we Face One Challenge and one trial after another from without out and from within help me Lord give me wisdom we're going through Waters that we've never been before Lord I need you Lord Jesus I'm not ashamed to stand here tonight and and say you as say to you as a man sometimes I get afraid I get afraid oh God my flesh becomes weary I need you Lord Jesus these are a great people I'm referring to tonight your people help me Lord God we worship you tonight Jesus we bless your name oh hallelujah how many of you tonight love him with all your heart you want God to help you maybe some of you feel like you're gifted in your life what I'll tell you what you want to do is check your motive your objective if you'll listen to a little simple tape very simple but very profound at the same time called discernment of spirit in 1960 it'll unveil a lot about motive and objective and of people that are gifted and what you can look for and what you can watch about people oh I pray that God will let his great Supernatural fall Among Us like never before and if we will pray and be sincere here what will happen before we leave this world remember the prophet told us that he believed there would be missing limbs that would be restored remember I told you that years ago when I was a Pentecostal preacher that God told me the dead would be raised in my Ministry I've seen it twice since I've been here I believe we will see such phenomenal things if we can just keep our hearts our attitudes and let's seek the gifts in their proper order let's start with wisdom with knowledge then when we get tongues we'll run its manifestation Lance through the gift on top wisdom which will always put God's word first we run interpretation through knowledge nosis the proper understanding of the word which includes also the word of the hour so tongues an interpretation of that wisdom it's easy to see why you get Bible saying almost anything it don't even have to be prophetic and people just accept it oh my I seen something not not long ago and a preacher had preached and my you know the people had said amen and Hallelujah and that sort of saying while the preacher was preaching then somebody got up spok in tongues and somebody supposedly interpreted people went wild they was screaming they was holling they was running they nearly knocked the chairs over in the church and what was said was not even prophetic there was nothing said that was even prophetic at all and yet a preacher had labored and labored and labored in the word and they sat there and said amen praise the Lord you can see the camera on some of them you know they're twiddling with their thumbs and they're doing this and that and as soon as tongues and interpretation come they went wild and then people wonder why I worry about stuff cuz I saw the same thing when I was a Pentecostal preacher now you show me that where that carried on in the Tabernacle and that was the brother brandham had the example and I'll stand up Sunday morning and apologize but until you do I'm going to keep on preaching it well praise the Lord I got my name embraced from some context tonight I guess off the phones and I lost some friends and buddies and Pals but that's all right I'm going to stand for this word if I have to stand by myself I won't have to because God's got people everywhere that believes the message of the hour right down to the gifts and right down to the election and all the rest of it and I'll tell you friends we're going to be glad after a while that we've took s with Jesus amen Hey sing something for him see if you can lift them out of this place I've brought them down to amen can we give the Lord a a wonderful
