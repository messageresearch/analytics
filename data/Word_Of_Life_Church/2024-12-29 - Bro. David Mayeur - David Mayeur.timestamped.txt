[44:01] Donnie it's good to be back I was here

[44:07] services and I remember we had Mighty
[44:11] services and it ought to be every
[44:14] service like
[44:16] that amen I remember when we we went
[44:19] there was a prayer line we went back to
[44:20] the office of brother Donnie and and
[44:22] there was brother Ron brother Donnie
[44:24] they had to be taken care of and and
[44:27] remember the words of Brother Don he
[44:28] said you should have
[44:31] seen all the
[44:33] casualties from the
[44:39] enemy amen so what about this
[44:42] morning this is the last service of
[44:45] 2024 amen but let's give a good knockout
[44:49] once again to Satan and Satan's kingdom
[44:53] amen Satan has fought many have stayed
[44:57] home because of sickness but we still
[44:59] serve a living God Amen he is still the
[45:03] same yesterday today and
[45:06] forever amen so I certainly count it a
[45:09] great honor to be standing here amen
[45:12] before the redeemed of the Lord and it's
[45:15] a great blessing to be standing here
[45:17] amen and it's always good when the
[45:19] saints come together because I always
[45:22] remind and I'm just quoting the word we
[45:24] were together before the found of the
[45:28] world Amen so maybe this is the first
[45:30] time you see me you hear me that doesn't
[45:33] matter I have no new doctrine I have one
[45:35] Doctrine that's Jesus Christ amen and I
[45:37] certainly appreciate your pastor brother
[45:39] Donnie his precious wife the family and
[45:43] as the word says uh speaking in
[45:45] Corinthians about the foolishness of
[45:47] preaching how I love and I thank God for
[45:51] be standing with true Servants of God to
[45:54] be on the battlefield that don't bend
[45:57] don't bow but that stand on the pure
[45:59] word of God Amen and we can be thankful
[46:03] for that because it's really God's grace
[46:06] Amen to have uh and and I want to thank
[46:08] you all because you have to share your
[46:11] pastor share the ministry and and so I
[46:14] want to do it live and thank you from
[46:16] the bottom of my heart for sharing your
[46:19] pastor with the rest of the Bride
[46:22] overseas you know sometimes we stay and
[46:24] we we stay focused on our little that's
[46:27] my little area but thousands many people
[46:31] have been tremendously blessed amen by
[46:34] the the the ministry of brother Donnie
[46:36] Reagan and so we I want to thank you

[46:39] him amen and Lord willing he will be
[46:41] back at Easter in in our Easter meetings
[46:43] so thank you amen and and we're not
[46:46] ashamed of the Gospel you know when the
[46:48] word talks about foolishness of
[46:50] preaching amen I love when the word is
[46:53] being preached in power in manifestation
[46:57] amen because that's what God gave us the
[46:59] most powerful weapon which is his word
[47:03] so even though I can feel weak you can
[47:05] feel weak the word is still an atomic
[47:08] power do you believe that amen and to
[47:12] think that we live in such a a
[47:14] tremendous time where we see Israel is
[47:17] in in in its
[47:19] Homeland we see what's going on and and
[47:22] and we live in a special time amen
[47:26] really when when you think about how God
[47:29] chose us for such a time as this amen
[47:31] and and we are standing here amen and
[47:35] and watching the word being manifested
[47:38] before our
[47:39] eyes like the prophet said we need to
[47:41] pinch oursel once in a while whether
[47:43] we're young whether we're old and and
[47:45] and and oh I've heard it preached before
[47:48] yes but now my eyes can see amen what's
[47:52] going on the King of the North to see
[47:54] Israel amen so it's a glor glorious time
[47:58] amen and it's a glorious time just to to
[48:01] end the the the year 2024 and to start a
[48:06] new one and and the Lord put something
[48:09] on my heart and I pray it will be a
[48:10] blessing amen but we have so much to
[48:14] Rejoice
[48:15] about because we live in this season of
[48:18] light and that's not because it's
[48:20] Christmas there's a lot of decoration or
[48:23] I'm not talking about that light we walk
[48:25] in the light
[48:27] amen God gave us his light the only
[48:30] light that you can receive is his word
[48:33] amen and God came down and gave us an
[48:36] open book amen revealed himself the word
[48:39] so by God's grace amen we can walk in
[48:43] the light so this morning I say like we
[48:45] heard it behold I bring you good tidings
[48:49] of great
[48:50] joy that's the
[48:53] gospel wonderful news amen so we
[48:56] certainly glad and to see brother
[48:58] brandham he had seven Visions how many
[49:00] remember that amen and and people try to
[49:04] put God in boxes you know we we we try
[49:06] to limit God six already has been has
[49:10] been done away with there's one
[49:14] left and I saw
[49:17] ashes Saints to be living in such a
[49:21] glorious time where in a twinkling of an
[49:24] eye think of it
[49:27] amen I have some back pain I have some
[49:29] pain here think of it in a twinkling of
[49:32] an eye I shall be changed amen mortality
[49:35] will take on
[49:36] immortality amen and that's for young
[49:39] for old because often young people they
[49:41] think oh we are still strong and uh I'm
[49:44] looking to say young people here and
[49:46] then we're in good health no no that's
[49:47] for all of us we will be changed amen
[49:51] and we have a glorious body awaiting for
[49:52] us amen so may God be uh worshiped and
[49:57] adored because he is worthy amen and as
[50:00] we go to the word so once again thank
[50:02] you from the depths of my heart and it's
[50:05] a great uh I'm so glad my wife is here
[50:09] sister an and my two daughters amen I
[50:11] bring you greetings from the church back
[50:13] home in France so Philly yeah that's

[50:17] he's been a great blessing also Through
[50:18] The Years amen so God bless you we love
[50:21] you dearly and we all love you dearly
[50:24] amen with the love of the Lord if can
[50:26] open the bibl our Bibles to John
[50:34] 14 and if I may ask you preach with me
[50:42] please it's not because it's the last
[50:44] final
[50:45] service preach with me you know the word
[50:48] of God tells us that we have to water
[50:50] the word with our Praises not what
[50:53] Brother David says what God tells us
[50:56] amen with our praises and the more we
[50:58] water the word the the seed the more it
[51:00] will
[51:02] grow amen and have the preeminence in
[51:05] this amen so if we can read the word in
[51:10] John 14:
[51:15] 18 I will not leave you comfortless I
[51:19] will come to you just this verse we can
[51:24] Rejoice amen yet a little while and the
[51:27] world see me no more but ye see me
[51:30] because I live ye shall live also and at
[51:35] that day ye shall know that I am in my
[51:38] father and ye in me and I in you amen
[51:45] two more portions Revelation 19 verse 7
[51:50] starting with verse
[51:52] 7 and I know you have the King James
[51:55] version but I I'm going to read the
[51:57] Amplified because we know the King James
[52:00] probably can quote It Off by heart but I
[52:02] want to make a a point here so verse
[52:07] seven let us rejoice and Shout for joy
[52:11] exalting and
[52:13] triumphant let us celebrate and ascribe
[52:16] to him glory and honor for the marriage
[52:19] of the Lamb has come and his bride has
[52:22] prepared
[52:24] herself and verse 8 she has been
[52:27] permitted to dress in fine radiant linen
[52:30] dazzling and white for the linen the
[52:33] fine linen amen is a
[52:35] righteousness the living upright The
[52:39] Godly living and the conduct and right
[52:41] standing with god of the Saints God's
[52:44] holy people and verse n and then the
[52:47] angel said unto me write this down
[52:52] blessed or to be envied H are those who
[52:56] who are summoned or invited or are
[52:59] called to the marriage supper of the
[53:01] lamb and he said to me these are the
[53:05] true words of God so
[53:11] blessed are this
[53:13] people that are called
[53:16] summoned to the wedding
[53:19] supper my let it be a reality that we
[53:22] realize because the prophet tells us
[53:24] amen when the brides know her position
[53:27] then the Rapture will take place we are
[53:29] a blessed
[53:32] people
[53:34] hallelujah amen revelation
[53:40] 22 verse
[53:45] 20 say Amen when you're
[53:50] there he which testify these things
[53:53] sayth surely I come quickly amen even so
[53:59] come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord
[54:02] Jesus Christ be with you all
[54:06] amen and these are the final words of
[54:09] the Bible amen and we are ending a year
[54:12] so I could say May the grace of our Lord
[54:14] Jesus Christ be with us all amen amen
[54:19] may God have the blessing to the reading
[54:21] of his word let's bow our heads for a
[54:23] word of prayer dear heavenly father
[54:27] Lord God we count it such a great honor
[54:29] to be standing on Holy Ground this

[56:16] draw my title amen let us rejoice with a
[56:20] exceeding great joy amen when you look
[56:23] up the word exce exceeding it means
[56:27] extreme great
[56:31] extraordinary to go past a certain
[56:34] limit so we always put ourselves we put
[56:38] the prophet says we limit
[56:41] God Amen but when we receive like David
[56:44] he he he said restore unto me the joy of
[56:47] my salvation he didn't Lo he didn't lose
[56:50] his salvation but he lost his Joy so
[56:52] with the word that we have received if
[56:55] we can see there's so much to Rejoice
[56:58] about we live in a world if we look to
[57:01] 2024 I don't know your situation you
[57:04] have I've had many hardships but here we
[57:08] are here we are amen we are here to show
[57:12] Satan that we are on The Winning Side
[57:15] amen no matter how I came in I know God
[57:18] has never failed me and he will never
[57:20] fail
[57:22] me amen so 2024 no matter amen
[57:28] I put it
[57:29] here no matter what we've been through
[57:33] let us rejoice greatly
[57:37] Rejoice Oh Brother David you don't know
[57:40] my situ I don't need to know because I
[57:42] know somebody that is watching over us
[57:45] amen and he's still The Great I Am he is
[57:47] still the same one that is working today
[57:51] all things can we say all things for my
[57:55] good we don't see it necessarily amen
[57:58] many times amen whether it's in in in in
[58:02] brother Donnie's life in brother bram's
[58:03] life in brother's life in my life we
[58:05] don't see the things we think oh this is
[58:08] chaos this is how is how I'm going to
[58:11] get out of this trial but God works all
[58:15] things for my
[58:18] good amen so let us be
[58:23] exceedingly to go past a certain limit
[58:27] amen we ought to be the happiest people
[58:28] on the
[58:29] Earth have a smiling face whether it's
[58:33] the right or the wrong president amen
[58:36] I'm not concern I can say it I'm not
[58:38] from
[58:40] America don't throw something at me
[58:43] now amen I don't care what president is
[58:46] I know one thing that God's word will
[58:50] manifest
[58:52] itself whether it's the right or the
[58:54] wrong I hey God will never fail and his
[58:58] word can never
[58:59] fail so he said let us be glad and
[59:02] rejoice and he said I'm quoting his word
[59:06] there will be a bride without spot or
[59:10] wrinkle amen amen so let us go amen and
[59:14] get in the spirit of worship says a
[59:16] prophet amen he says our spirit is clean
[59:19] it's fresh it's real it's sober and
[59:21] serious amen full of the joy of the Lord
[59:25] the Christian
[59:26] how many Christians do we have this
[59:28] morning good now here the Christian
[59:31] ought to be just as exuberant and full
[59:35] of his pleasure in the Lord as the world
[59:38] is when it Savers and delights in its
[59:41] Pleasures so we can see we can walk and
[59:44] I know it's it's it's probably the same
[59:47] we see in Europe people they are not
[59:51] ashamed to have purple hair to have
[59:54] green hair to work man working in scour
[59:58] hey maybe I get I will offend somebody
[1:00:00] but hey I'm standing for the word of God
[1:00:02] Amen they are not ashamed to walk amen
[1:00:06] and to give glory to Satan so why should
[1:00:09] I be ashamed if the word of God tells me
[1:00:12] I can be as exuberant even more why
[1:00:16] because God's word will never fail
[1:00:20] me I pray it may be an encouragement for
[1:00:22] you amen we hear what's going on Wars
[1:00:26] rumors of War amen turmoil there where
[1:00:29] amen but nature is
[1:00:33] groaning amen for what the manifestation
[1:00:37] of the Sons and Daughters of God Amen so
[1:00:40] we can Rejoice because everything is
[1:00:43] indicating the coming of the
[1:00:46] Lord everything is indicating the coming
[1:00:48] of the Lord he says we're right at the
[1:00:51] door and before one bomb think of it
[1:00:55] people are living
[1:00:56] In
[1:00:57] Fear And The Prophet tells us fear is
[1:01:00] the worst thing that Satan can put on
[1:01:02] you I'm afraid I'm going to get this I'm
[1:01:05] afraid I'm going to get this I'm afraid
[1:01:06] I'm afraid I'm afraid and the word of
[1:01:08] God tell us let us
[1:01:11] rejoice exceedingly Rejoice amen and
[1:01:14] brother brother Daryl was telling me how
[1:01:16] he preached on Amen the weapons that God
[1:01:18] gave us if we can Rejoice even in the
[1:01:21] trial if we can worship even in the
[1:01:23] trial even if I can kneel down and and
[1:01:26] pray Lord I need you you will see the
[1:01:29] walls will come trembling
[1:01:33] down amen amen so before one bomb can
[1:01:37] strike oh the church will be gone home
[1:01:39] in
[1:01:40] glory think of it people that live under
[1:01:44] fear and wey we can be at peace amen a
[1:01:49] peace Beyond any understanding tell me
[1:01:54] brother tell me sister how comes you can
[1:01:57] have this Joy well this joy that I have
[1:02:00] the world didn't give it to me and the
[1:02:02] world can't take it
[1:02:04] away the holy ghost that I have the
[1:02:07] world didn't give it and the world can't
[1:02:09] take it
[1:02:10] away I don't know if you know that song
[1:02:12] but I love that song just telling Satan
[1:02:15] boo
[1:02:17] devil amen amen the prophet he tells us
[1:02:20] a story about this Cowboy you know the
[1:02:22] story amen the armor company how he was
[1:02:26] looking for a wife a
[1:02:29] bride amen and as he goes and he he sees
[1:02:33] all these women amen but there's one he
[1:02:36] says I've been watching you I have found
[1:02:38] and I I see that you are a virtuous
[1:02:40] woman woo the bride amen that is a part
[1:02:45] of himself amen is a virtuous spoken
[1:02:49] word bride amen so this man he says
[1:02:52] you're a virtuous woman amen I'm here
[1:02:56] amen for to find a wife and you meet
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:01] specification think of
[1:03:03] it you
[1:03:05] meet that
[1:03:07] specification how we're going to see
[1:03:11] bear with me amen so we
[1:03:14] see the as Brandon bam tells a story
[1:03:17] this lady she said but I'm not
[1:03:19] worthy that's what I say I am not worthy
[1:03:24] but then the prophet goes on to tell H
[1:03:26] there's the law of redemption amen and
[1:03:28] he takes the example of this mule you
[1:03:30] know the story amen has his ears down
[1:03:33] his knees
[1:03:35] all like sometimes we are like we
[1:03:40] feel amen but then Mama tells don't you
[1:03:45] worry it ain't know how you look where
[1:03:48] you come from because there is a perfect
[1:03:51] lamb that has been sacrificed for you
[1:03:54] and I amen so by God's grace amen Satan
[1:03:59] tries to remember where we come from he
[1:04:01] tries to remember our past but Saints
[1:04:04] let us talk him about his future his
[1:04:07] future is in the Lake of Fire And even
[1:04:10] this morning his place is under my
[1:04:14] feet come on Saints amen it's we should
[1:04:19] when we come to church no matter how we
[1:04:22] feel Amen brother brand he talks about
[1:04:25] amen how we are kicked around like a
[1:04:27] ball like a
[1:04:28] football that's how we go through
[1:04:31] sometimes but then when the word is
[1:04:33] being preached you say amen and
[1:04:36] something is happening deep inside
[1:04:38] because something greater is in you than
[1:04:42] all those that are against
[1:04:45] you amen and that ain't a fairy tale
[1:04:47] it's a
[1:04:49] reality amen amen so she says I'm not
[1:04:52] worthy but you mean that specification
[1:04:55] and amen a man of that caliber she says
[1:04:58] oh hey that's the way I felt says a
[1:05:01] prophet one night when I got the
[1:05:04] invitation to come to the wedding
[1:05:07] supper Hallelujah the prophet saying
[1:05:10] that's how I felt unworthy I'm a sinner
[1:05:13] but saved by God's grace but he invited
[1:05:16] me he chose me he elected me he loved me
[1:05:20] and he wrote my name in the book before
[1:05:22] the foundation of the world and when he
[1:05:24] invited me
[1:05:26] am think of it let me I have often asked
[1:05:29] the
[1:05:30] question have you ever gone to a wedding
[1:05:33] with a sad face let me pull on my
[1:05:36] glasses I see you better
[1:05:39] like
[1:05:41] anybody I hope it's not a bride and the
[1:05:43] groom because then they need
[1:05:46] counseling so to go to a wedding it's a
[1:05:50] party it's a feast it's a
[1:05:52] celebration and the prophet tells us
[1:05:55] when I got got this invitation not to
[1:05:57] any
[1:05:59] wedding my
[1:06:01] wedding and I got invited to the wedding
[1:06:04] supper I could but
[1:06:06] Rejoice amen unworthy I am but by God's
[1:06:11] grace he said I was
[1:06:13] worthy
[1:06:15] hallelujah amen amen amen and he goes on
[1:06:18] to say Amen when the man he replied when
[1:06:21] she said I'm not worthy I'm looking for
[1:06:24] virtue
[1:06:25] my you know what virtue says the
[1:06:27] prophets it's obedience to the word of
[1:06:30] God virtue is strength and when you
[1:06:32] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:06:35] says I'm quoting amen I have no message
[1:06:38] of my own we can only be a echo of the
[1:06:42] pure word not add and not take away
[1:06:45] that's why God bless my precious brother
[1:06:47] Donnie and brother Dar and the ministry
[1:06:49] that stand for the purity of the
[1:06:52] word amen cuz remember Satan is also
[1:06:56] there amen and it would be so close till
[1:07:00] it would deceive the very elect if it is
[1:07:04] possible but it
[1:07:05] ain't because the bride is part of the
[1:07:09] word amen so he's looking for virtue
[1:07:12] amen and when you receive the baptism of
[1:07:13] the Holy Ghost you have the virtue seal
[1:07:17] in you amen come on
[1:07:21] now Lord so blessed is the man says
[1:07:23] Jeremiah that trusted in the the Lord
[1:07:26] and whose hope the Lord
[1:07:28] is how many want to trust in the Lord
[1:07:30] for
[1:07:31] 2025 oh I have no job I don't care
[1:07:35] that's right I have no home I don't
[1:07:41] care because Satan can try to put a lot
[1:07:43] of things on
[1:07:45] us but what God has given us goes
[1:07:50] beyond that's why I can Rejoice
[1:07:54] exceedingly
[1:07:57] Rejoice Brother Lou s I'm one of them
[1:08:00] I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can
[1:08:04] say I'm one of them I'm one of them that
[1:08:08] should be the hym of of the Church of
[1:08:11] the Living God because I'm the one that
[1:08:14] got
[1:08:16] elected Hallelujah isn't he wonderful
[1:08:20] amen because we know we live in a Time
[1:08:23] amen Matthew 24 says for the then shall
[1:08:25] be Great Tribulation such as as was not
[1:08:29] since the beginning of the world to this
[1:08:30] time nor ever shall
[1:08:34] be so for the bride it's a rejoicing
[1:08:37] time but for the
[1:08:41] others there can be much joy even though
[1:08:44] they act like they are
[1:08:47] rejoicing they think many people think
[1:08:49] I'm
[1:08:51] free since I'm out of the message I'm
[1:08:54] free
[1:08:56] they are more changed than ever some
[1:08:59] people in their lives live in such a
[1:09:03] mess it's about time you get in the
[1:09:06] message and you will see that you will
[1:09:09] have rejoicing exceeding rejoy because
[1:09:13] God when he reveals himself to
[1:09:19] you come on
[1:09:21] church amen the Rapture is unique
[1:09:25] yes sir there won't be many raptures
[1:09:27] several raptures if I miss that Rapture
[1:09:30] I'll take the next one like a plane or
[1:09:32] like a bus or like a
[1:09:34] train no he Rapture his
[1:09:36] bride and the prophet goes on to say
[1:09:39] that others they will be still preaching
[1:09:42] about the Rapture think of it
[1:09:45] amen hallelujah so he came first to
[1:09:48] redeem his bride then he comes to catch
[1:09:50] her away and then he comes with his
[1:09:53] bride amen and when he Comes This Time
[1:09:56] hardly none but those who are ready will
[1:09:59] know when he comes
[1:10:02] amen think of it yes sir Nobody Knows
[1:10:05] the time the day the hour so forget
[1:10:08] about all these
[1:10:11] theories but nevertheless the prophet
[1:10:13] tells us we should be ready at any time
[1:10:15] and expecting him here in the next
[1:10:17] minute the next hour any
[1:10:19] time so what should be our expectation
[1:10:22] even ending 2024 and beginning 2025
[1:10:26] what should be our rejoicing just in
[1:10:31] service just when we
[1:10:34] come no day after day after day amen
[1:10:39] because it's in the hardest trials amen
[1:10:41] that he comes on the scene where he says
[1:10:44] this is a man-sized job amen when those
[1:10:47] three Hebrew boys they were in the F
[1:10:49] they were in the have you ever been in
[1:10:52] that condition thank you neither have I
[1:10:56] but the prophet tells us they were
[1:10:58] rejoicing hours after hours after hours
[1:11:04] rejoicing my what were they rejoicing
[1:11:06] about because the I am came down and
[1:11:10] they were having Fellowship they were
[1:11:12] having oh a glorious time amen when he
[1:11:16] comes down think of it the natural
[1:11:21] attributes laws have no impact right
[1:11:25] that's right the only thing that got
[1:11:28] burned were the
[1:11:30] ropes their clothes didn't even
[1:11:34] smell how great is my
[1:11:38] god yes we can sing it all together my
[1:11:42] How Great Is Our God amen amen and he's
[1:11:45] still the same for us amen so only those
[1:11:48] that know him amen that already will
[1:11:51] know when he comes so we read Revelation
[1:11:53] 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:11:56] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:11:57] Lamb has come and his wife
[1:12:03] hath excuse my English I'm not perfect
[1:12:06] in English but I know that
[1:12:08] half it's done
[1:12:10] it's not
[1:12:13] future do we have any any any teachers
[1:12:17] here I'm
[1:12:19] simple but simple fate moves mountains
[1:12:25] had made herself ready amen and the
[1:12:28] lexican uses the word excuse my
[1:12:30] pronunciation HTO Mao amen which is the
[1:12:33] necessary preparation and it says also
[1:12:36] to prepare the minds of men to give the
[1:12:40] Messiah a fit
[1:12:44] reception that's why we have to be
[1:12:46] transformed by the renewing of our
[1:12:50] mind that's why we don't need knowledge
[1:12:53] in the head but Born Again
[1:12:56] experience Moses had to get rid of all
[1:12:59] his knowledge many people can quote the
[1:13:01] word can quote from Genesis to
[1:13:03] Revelation can quote every every message
[1:13:07] quote and it's only head knowledge amen
[1:13:10] but that doesn't move God but when
[1:13:13] somebody with simple faith can start
[1:13:16] claiming God's given promises amen he
[1:13:20] comes on the scene not sometimes every
[1:13:24] time
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:29] Hallelujah so God is uniting his bright
[1:13:31] there's a uniting time and that's what
[1:13:34] is going on right now are you hearing me
[1:13:39] it's going on right now what is she
[1:13:41] uniting for the Rapture amen what is she
[1:13:44] uniting with the
[1:13:46] word she's uniting herself with what
[1:13:50] thus sayith the Lord regardless of what
[1:13:54] any did denomination what anybody can
[1:13:56] else what can say about it why because
[1:14:00] she is the chosen one the bride the
[1:14:03] elected lady she is she's United herself
[1:14:07] with her bridegroom see and the
[1:14:10] bridegroom is the
[1:14:14] word think of the privilege yes

[1:14:20] million yes sir yeah that we can sit

[1:18:44] and night but since when there's the
[1:18:47] elect lady listen to the nonsense of

[1:19:26] somewhat promises that's at least well
[1:19:29] close to two per
[1:19:35] day and we have legal possession by
[1:19:38] Jesus Christ every believer in here I
[1:19:42] asked already how many believers do we
[1:19:43] have and you raised your hand every
[1:19:45] believer in here has a bang book from
[1:19:48] the deposit that was made at Calvary for
[1:19:52] me for us amen and and that's where he
[1:19:56] beat Satan to
[1:20:01] Pieces that's why I'm
[1:20:03] saying he's but a
[1:20:06] loser 600
[1:20:08] somewhat and he says Promises of Divine
[1:20:10] Healing and we sat here slumbering oh my

[1:20:18] believe him amen amen maybe 20 and
[1:20:22] sometimes we will fall yes the just can
[1:20:25] fall but he seven times even but he
[1:20:27] raises up
[1:20:29] again don't stay on the
[1:20:31] floor you say I can do all things
[1:20:34] through Christ Jesus which strengthens
[1:20:37] me don't depend on your strength don't
[1:20:40] depend on your knowledge amen only
[1:20:42] depend on our Lord Jesus amen hallelujah
[1:20:46] he is still so believe in him he is
[1:20:49] still a mighty
[1:20:50] God time cannot change him right amen
[1:20:56] ages do not time
[1:21:00] him come on church he is still the
[1:21:04] Mighty God he is still the I
[1:21:08] am Brother David I heard that over yes
[1:21:11] but it has to become a reality where I
[1:21:14] know that my redeemer liveth I know in
[1:21:16] who I
[1:21:19] believe if the prophet tells us we ought
[1:21:22] to be the happiest people on the Earth
[1:21:29] the happiest people on the Earth yes sir
[1:21:32] and it's not just putting on a smiling
[1:21:37] face and brother on ask how are you
[1:21:39] doing I'm
[1:21:45] fine right the happiest people why
[1:21:49] because I've got an invitation yes oh
[1:21:52] yeah there's a marriage going on right
[1:21:55] now it's a reality and I got the
[1:21:58] invitation to the wedding supper and in
[1:22:01] one moment in a twinkling of an eye I
[1:22:04] shall be caught up amen together with
[1:22:07] those that were asleep before they will
[1:22:09] rise first and then together we will be
[1:22:14] raptured that's oh that's enough
[1:22:16] material for me to shout and rejoice I
[1:22:20] think brother Daryl one time in a church
[1:22:22] back home he says that ought to make the
[1:22:24] Pope
[1:22:26] shout well he doesn't have the
[1:22:27] Revelation brother Daryl
[1:22:29] but I see the
[1:22:31] point but what about the bride what
[1:22:34] about the elected lady we can't but
[1:22:37] exceedingly Rejoice because God is so
[1:22:41] good to us amen his coming is so
[1:22:43] imminent he is gathering his elect
[1:22:46] together amen oh he says he's calling
[1:22:49] his elect together in Oneness with
[1:22:52] himself with the same kind of ministry
[1:22:55] that he had the prophet says great is
[1:22:58] the mystery of
[1:23:00] godliness what is godliness to be like
[1:23:06] God Luke 24 speaks we all know how they
[1:23:11] received the promise T ye in the
[1:23:16] city let's not limit it because the
[1:23:19] promise was not just for a city
[1:23:25] I will send you the comforter I will
[1:23:27] send you and I will guide you he also
[1:23:30] says I will
[1:23:33] restore amen so until you be endued with
[1:23:38] power if you look to the Lexicon it
[1:23:40] means to put on to be clothed to be
[1:23:44] arrayed
[1:23:48] woo to be
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:23:51] arrayed with fine needle work he uses
[1:23:54] yes sir the word of God you know many
[1:23:57] people they try to change the word to
[1:24:01] their
[1:24:02] condition you know the wedding dress I
[1:24:05] needed a little bit more and a little
[1:24:06] more this and a little bit more like
[1:24:07] that no no no I need to be
[1:24:12] changed
[1:24:13] shaped according to the
[1:24:16] word are you with
[1:24:18] me amen so many people come and my
[1:24:21] situation is different the word is the
[1:24:24] word word it doesn't change no matter
[1:24:27] what I think no matter what brother darl
[1:24:30] brother Donnie it's God's word and he
[1:24:33] will not change
[1:24:35] it that's why I can Rejoice because you
[1:24:38] know why because when he reveals himself
[1:24:41] to you
[1:24:43] personally then you rejoice because I
[1:24:46] can see my name in the book I have an
[1:24:48] invitation I know I'm going to the
[1:24:50] wedding supper amen and that's a reality
[1:24:53] amen that nobody it's not an
[1:24:55] interpretation that somebody can give
[1:24:57] you amen that Brother David brother
[1:25:00] Donnie whoever gives you no it's God
[1:25:03] personal dealing personally with
[1:25:08] you that's why amen it will be so close
[1:25:12] but thank God you know God he doesn't
[1:25:15] make
[1:25:18] mistakes boo Satan amen so we have to be
[1:25:22] unded dressed PR with this word and
[1:25:26] that's what is going on now the prophet
[1:25:28] says where the word becomes you and you
[1:25:30] become the
[1:25:31] word me yes you
[1:25:34] yes hallelujah amen those who he called
[1:25:38] he justified those who he justified amen
[1:25:41] he already glorified and every redeemed
[1:25:43] person in the world this morning that's
[1:25:45] under the blood of Jesus Christ filled
[1:25:48] with the Holy Ghost has everlasting life
[1:25:51] and cannot perish and is already in
[1:25:53] heavenly places with Christ Jesus yes
[1:25:56] sir and shall never come into
[1:25:58] condemnation yes sir so if we are filled
[1:26:01] with the Holy Ghost the Lord our
[1:26:06] fibers and beings has already been
[1:26:09] preserved in God and there is a
[1:26:12] glorified body
[1:26:13] Hallelujah there is a glorified body
[1:26:16] already waiting and you have to go to it

[1:26:42] future is
[1:26:47] glorious we we'll we'll go a little
[1:26:50] deeper because as long as we are on
[1:26:52] earth no B Ms can
[1:26:57] fall
[1:26:59] okay 1 John 3 beloved now are we the
[1:27:02] sons of God and it do not yet appear
[1:27:05] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:27:07] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[1:27:10] we shall see him as he is you know the
[1:27:14] story about that little lad who was
[1:27:16] walking in the house and he comes by a
[1:27:19] mirror the mirror is the word of
[1:27:22] God and he goes in front of the mirror
[1:27:25] that's
[1:27:27] me that's why God came down with an open
[1:27:30] book no one was worthy it ain't a man
[1:27:33] it's God himself taking the book opening
[1:27:37] the seals thereof so we can see our true
[1:27:41] identity that's me Hallelujah I'm the
[1:27:45] pure virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:50] Christ amen that goes a trillion times
[1:27:55] above whoever can be soall
[1:28:01] important I'm the son of Mr
[1:28:07] President I'm the Bride of Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ oh Hallelujah greatly exceedingly

[1:28:20] John 10 I and my father are one yes have
[1:28:23] you been so long with Me That You Don't
[1:28:27] See you see this Antichrist spirit that
[1:28:30] still tries Amen to bring in Trinity
[1:28:33] we're talking in the office with brother
[1:28:34] darl amen and it would be so close till
[1:28:37] it deceive the very elect if a
[1:28:39] trinitarian Doctrine comes in we know
[1:28:42] that it's
[1:28:43] wrong so we know so that the same it
[1:28:46] will be so close it will
[1:28:48] be even in the
[1:28:51] message we don't like to hear it yeah
[1:28:54] but it's still the
[1:28:57] truth that's why you pray for your
[1:29:00] pastor you pray for the
[1:29:02] ministry amen Jesus said at that
[1:29:07] day that's this
[1:29:10] day I'm quoting a prophet at that day
[1:29:13] that's this day when this Revelation is
[1:29:16] made known you will know that I am in
[1:29:18] the father and the father in me and I in
[1:29:20] you and you in me when the Revelation is
[1:29:22] made manifest and that that day you
[1:29:24] shall know that I am the father and the
[1:29:26] father are one I am in the father and
[1:29:28] the father is in me I like this
[1:29:30] mathematics very
[1:29:32] simple
[1:29:34] am told you I'm
[1:29:36] simple and then when the Revelation
[1:29:38] comes forth then it's I in you and you
[1:29:42] in me there you are I love how the
[1:29:46] prophet makes it so easy yes s there you
[1:29:50] are can somebody write a thesis on it or
[1:29:53] a doct doctorate or in PhD and explain
[1:29:56] me how I don't need any explanation
[1:29:58] because God himself used some vocal
[1:30:00] cords to tell me there we are that's
[1:30:03] God's
[1:30:06] plan God had attributes amen and way he
[1:30:09] had amen attributes and we are his
[1:30:12] attributes amen so God's desire way from
[1:30:15] the beginning was to manifest to become
[1:30:19] tangible and how thankful we can be when
[1:30:22] we see Israel in his is in the in the
[1:30:25] Homeland amen they reject it but how
[1:30:29] thankful we can be that we have seven
[1:30:32] Church ages yes sir they rejected thank
[1:30:35] God and the prophet says there's a
[1:30:38] limited
[1:30:39] time so don't play with time I'll do it
[1:30:42] tomorrow I'll do it next week oh maybe
[1:30:45] next year no now is the day of your
[1:30:48] salvation now is the day when you give
[1:30:51] it all to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:55] amen he says at first it is a thought a
[1:30:58] thought and then a word and a word and
[1:31:00] when a thought Express is a word than
[1:31:02] it's spoken it has to happen Therefore
[1:31:05] your name was in his thinking that's how
[1:31:09] you have eternal life if you got eternal
[1:31:12] life you always
[1:31:17] was hallelujah oh yes I can exceedingly
[1:31:21] Rejoice about thaten
[1:31:24] amen thank you Lord and then it's spoken
[1:31:28] it has to happen amen oh anything that
[1:31:31] was eternal never did begin and cannot
[1:31:34] end so you are only in his thinking your
[1:31:37] name who you are and what you are that's
[1:31:40] the only way you could ever have eternal
[1:31:43] life CA you always
[1:31:49] was Lord people are looking not going to
[1:31:52] give names but invest trillions of
[1:31:56] dollars to go to
[1:32:00] Mars sorry it's your
[1:32:02] money your
[1:32:05] taxes there's probably some life out
[1:32:10] there Satan was cast down here on the
[1:32:15] earth and God had such a perfect plan
[1:32:19] that he placed us here on the earth and
[1:32:22] God wants to show his Glory we're going
[1:32:25] to come to that in a moment yes he does
[1:32:27] even on this Earth amen so let them look
[1:32:30] for Life here's real life and the real
[1:32:34] life is his
[1:32:37] word
[1:32:39] hallelujah he says you actually know
[1:32:41] nothing about it but yet science and
[1:32:43] God's word proves that you were in your
[1:32:44] father and you know nothing about it
[1:32:46] that's why we have spiritual Amnesia and
[1:32:49] the word of God brings us back to our
[1:32:52] original
[1:32:54] condition not what you think not what
[1:32:57] you can see not what you can feel what
[1:33:00] God says about
[1:33:02] it amen every Son of God and every
[1:33:05] daughter of God was in God at the
[1:33:06] beginning he knowed it and he wanted you
[1:33:09] to become so he could contact
[1:33:13] you thank you amen he desires Fellowship
[1:33:17] he desires this communion with
[1:33:21] you and he wanted you to become so he
[1:33:23] could contact you speak with you and
[1:33:25] love you and Shake Your
[1:33:28] Hands think of
[1:33:30] it shaking your hands I'm shaking the
[1:33:34] hands of God a Son of God a part of God
[1:33:37] in you it's a reality amen God bless you
[1:33:42] Brothers I'm not going to do the whole
[1:33:43] church
[1:33:45] because but that's God Amen that's why
[1:33:48] he says amen now when the Holy Spirit
[1:33:52] was sent amen
[1:33:54] he divided
[1:33:56] himself and now is in a many membered
[1:33:59] body on
[1:34:01] Earth hallelujah amen that's why he says
[1:34:04] and Shake Your Hands how can I show you
[1:34:07] I just showed
[1:34:10] you when the two were on the way to EMAs
[1:34:14] amen Jesus appears to them and he goes
[1:34:16] what straight to the
[1:34:19] scriptures that's the best thing that we
[1:34:22] can give you
[1:34:26] brother
[1:34:28] Donnie I need some advice I need some
[1:34:30] counseling nothing against
[1:34:33] counseling but if you seek me you shall
[1:34:35] find
[1:34:37] me the problem is we have it's easy
[1:34:41] now we we went with with our kids we
[1:34:44] went to Pigeon
[1:34:47] forest and and there was an old phone
[1:34:50] that I still use so don't call me old
[1:34:52] now
[1:34:54] you know the
[1:34:56] one some younger ones here have never
[1:34:58] seen something like that they don't even
[1:35:00] know how to use it so and it's the same
[1:35:03] today oh we have a mobile phone and we
[1:35:05] can text and we can
[1:35:09] amen right seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:35:13] God amen
[1:35:16] amen and you will see if you knock with
[1:35:19] all your heart he will open that's right
[1:35:22] thank you Lord if if you seek with all
[1:35:24] your heart you shall find yes so when
[1:35:26] Jesus appears to them he goes to the
[1:35:29] scripture and he says don't you know
[1:35:31] that the scripture must be fulfilled
[1:35:33] Hallelujah screams brother Branham I
[1:35:35] feel awful good right now how many feel
[1:35:38] awful good this
[1:35:41] morning don't you know the scripture has
[1:35:44] got to be
[1:35:45] fulfilled yes now we can believe that
[1:35:49] for those two on their way to em but now
[1:35:53] what about the scripture concerning the
[1:35:54] bride that's right I'm asking you
[1:35:58] Saints scripture has got to be fulfilled
[1:36:02] don't you know that God's word will not
[1:36:05] return to me void and it will
[1:36:10] accomplish what why it has been given
[1:36:13] there's not one promise not one are you
[1:36:16] hearing me not one promise that
[1:36:20] God will not manifest that's righten
[1:36:23] even if Satan with all his power all his
[1:36:26] demons assembl thems not
[1:36:30] one
[1:36:32] listen
[1:36:33] Joshua
[1:36:36] savior we see he gets instructions from
[1:36:38] the angel clear instructions and God has
[1:36:42] ways of doing like I said before amen
[1:36:44] our thoughts are not his
[1:36:49] thoughts that's that's why he let thy
[1:36:52] will be done Lord
[1:36:54] yeah so Joshua gets clear
[1:36:57] instructions Amen to go into to conquer
[1:37:00] the land and we see how Jesus comes from
[1:37:03] a lineage that why would he choose that
[1:37:08] lineage to confuse all the
[1:37:13] intellectuals so we know
[1:37:16] that boas comes from the lineage of
[1:37:19] Salon Salon was married to Rahab we can
[1:37:22] read that in Ruth 42 21 and Salomon beg
[1:37:24] boas boas be Obed and Obed be Jesse and
[1:37:26] Jesse be got Avid and then in Matthew 1
[1:37:28] we see all the lineage and beg
[1:37:30] Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was
[1:37:32] born Jesus who is called Christ so out
[1:37:36] of a lineage why would he do
[1:37:38] that now when Joshua he had to take the
[1:37:43] Land There was a
[1:37:46] Rahab somebody
[1:37:48] unworthy like me
[1:37:53] but she believed the
[1:37:57] word she believed independently of what
[1:38:01] the people could tell her yes sir you're
[1:38:05] no good good at nothing you're your life
[1:38:10] is is miserable your life is evil yeah
[1:38:14] she believed because she even
[1:38:17] testified you
[1:38:19] know all this big army here
[1:38:23] are shaking in our
[1:38:26] boots think of
[1:38:29] it we are afraid because we know how God
[1:38:32] is with you so she believed amen and
[1:38:36] bringing it back because the word is
[1:38:38] filled with types just like
[1:38:41] Rebecca the word the message was
[1:38:44] sufficient for her she believed it amen
[1:38:48] many people say I want to I want to see
[1:38:50] first no I believe it
[1:38:54] amen so we see Rahab she believed the
[1:38:58] word she applied the token to her house
[1:39:01] and her household yes sir come on Mom
[1:39:04] and
[1:39:05] Dad no matter how far away he may be God
[1:39:10] still brings back
[1:39:15] prodigals so Joshua gave clear
[1:39:17] instructions in Joshua 6 he says utterly
[1:39:20] destroy all that is in the city
[1:39:24] both man woman young old Ox sheep ass
[1:39:31] with the edge of the sword why would he
[1:39:33] give that
[1:39:36] much information or
[1:39:40] Direction an ox we're going to need the
[1:39:42] meat a sheep we're going to need the
[1:39:45] meat because God's plan is perfect
[1:39:53] I can see a few years later the high
[1:39:58] priest standing before Rahab and
[1:40:02] Salomon saying into this holy State
[1:40:06] these two persons present come to be
[1:40:09] joined and if there's any person here
[1:40:13] that can show a Just Cause why they
[1:40:15] should not be lawfully joined together
[1:40:18] in this holy
[1:40:20] matrimony do you now speak
[1:40:23] or from Hereafter forever hold your
[1:40:27] peace so Joshua gave instructions
[1:40:30] received from God so that there could be
[1:40:33] no witness whatsoever that could say yes
[1:40:38] Rahab she's not
[1:40:41] worthy
[1:40:43] amen now I had we had our Lord and
[1:40:49] savior come down to pay the price for
[1:40:55] me think of
[1:40:57] it you know when somebody is kidnapped
[1:41:00] they ask for a
[1:41:02] ransom he has millions or
[1:41:06] whatever God put himself the price he
[1:41:09] said this is the price that is required
[1:41:12] and there is no one nobody but God
[1:41:16] himself that could pay that
[1:41:19] price that's how valuable you are
[1:41:23] amen think of it that's why his
[1:41:28] blood washes away all of my sins
[1:41:33] Hallelujah and if Satan comes the
[1:41:35] accuser of the Brethren when he comes to
[1:41:38] accuse you you've done this you've done
[1:41:39] that you're not
[1:41:41] worthy pardoned
[1:41:45] forgiven you've never done it in the
[1:41:48] first place where's that first place in
[1:41:51] God's thoughts before the foundation of
[1:41:53] the world Amen that's why I can greatly
[1:41:56] extremely
[1:41:58] Rejoice amen amen amen isn't he
[1:42:01] wonderful amen we can see amen when
[1:42:04] omnipotence speak then the miraculous
[1:42:07] takes place that's why in John 14 he
[1:42:11] says the works that I do shall you do
[1:42:12] also and God he came in our
[1:42:15] generation think of it God came down in
[1:42:18] our generation to pick up all the Loose
[1:42:21] Ends amen amen
[1:42:24] so the bride can see her
[1:42:28] identity so there is not an eight
[1:42:30] messenger
[1:42:32] coming are you hearing
[1:42:34] me there's not somebody coming no God
[1:42:39] did it very well at the voice of the
[1:42:42] seven Angel when he shall become be when
[1:42:45] he when he shall
[1:42:48] sound the mystery shall be
[1:42:51] revealed thank you Jesus
[1:42:54] Jesus so we see the Bible is full of
[1:42:57] types Rahab Ruth Ruth and boas
[1:43:00] Esther but you
[1:43:03] know they are the
[1:43:09] types but we
[1:43:11] are the true Bride on the earth yes Lord
[1:43:15] that which is in type is now a reality a
[1:43:20] manifestation of God's word yes sir as I
[1:43:24] said
[1:43:30] before while the bride is still
[1:43:33] here we still have a work to do yes
[1:43:37] sir Satan can boast but let let us put
[1:43:40] him back in his rightful position amen
[1:43:43] Romans 8 says for I reckon that the
[1:43:45] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:43:47] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:43:50] which shall be revealed in US
[1:43:55] Lord remember the wedding dress
[1:43:57] arrayed
[1:44:00] indued with God's word yes
[1:44:04] sir now Isaiah 60 speaks of the time
[1:44:08] we're living says arise Shine for thy
[1:44:10] light has come amen and the glory of the
[1:44:13] Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The
[1:44:16] Darkness shall cover the Earth and grows
[1:44:18] Darkness the people but the Lord shall
[1:44:19] arise upon thee and His glory shall be
[1:44:23] seen upon
[1:44:25] thee when the Lord in the beginning he
[1:44:28] said let there be
[1:44:31] light remember that he made the sun to
[1:44:36] shine during the day and the moon to
[1:44:39] reflect the sunlight during the
[1:44:42] night stay with me a while
[1:44:46] now God Will Shine for his light says a
[1:44:49] prophet and he is doing it just before
[1:44:51] the coming of the lord it's not man man
[1:44:53] is out of it it's God God does it
[1:44:56] because he promised it so we see the
[1:44:59] moon is a type yes sir the prophet picks
[1:45:03] it up amen and the moon has no light by
[1:45:08] herself that's why we have no
[1:45:12] glory of
[1:45:14] ourselves I have a great Revelation you
[1:45:17] should listen to me and all this
[1:45:20] nonsense on God uses
[1:45:23] what surrendered
[1:45:25] vessels and the prophet says as soon as
[1:45:28] somebody thinks he has something God
[1:45:30] withdraws
[1:45:31] himself amen God bless the
[1:45:35] ministry true Ministry true five-fold
[1:45:38] Ministry Hallelujah so the Moon is the
[1:45:42] wife of the
[1:45:45] Sun and when when the Sun goes away the
[1:45:48] Moon reflects the light of the sun is
[1:45:50] that right on Earth and when Jesus was
[1:45:53] taken away we are the bride which is the
[1:45:55] Moon to reflect the light of the gospel
[1:45:59] and we can't reflect it until he Shines
[1:46:02] on
[1:46:03] us that's why when he said be my
[1:46:07] Witnesses you can be a witness unless
[1:46:10] you have a real lifechanging Born Again
[1:46:14] experience many people can talk about
[1:46:16] the word but there's no reality
[1:46:20] behind amen amen
[1:46:23] Hallelujah so God said to the Moon to
[1:46:26] watch the boundaries of the sea and when
[1:46:28] the Moon Turns its head the tide goes
[1:46:31] out how many knows that that the moon
[1:46:34] has an effect on the tide the tide goes
[1:46:37] out and when it turns its head back the
[1:46:39] tides follows my the
[1:46:43] moon if it would ever move out of its
[1:46:45] place and I love how brother Donnie and
[1:46:48] there's
[1:46:49] only yeah brother Donnie can bring
[1:46:55] space beyond space to such a
[1:46:59] reality as I said he's been such a
[1:47:01] tremendous blessing to us and the bride
[1:47:03] all over the world and we love him
[1:47:05] dearly and here the prophet says yes yes
[1:47:09] we're not worshiping man but we truly
[1:47:11] it's an honor to have him as a real
[1:47:13] friend amen and I love him dearly amen
[1:47:16] so we see if if that Moon would go just
[1:47:19] a little out of its its position
[1:47:23] see what happened if it move out it
[1:47:25] would move out of its place the waters
[1:47:27] would cover the Earth like it was when
[1:47:29] God started it in Genesis 1 wow but the
[1:47:32] moon set there and when it just even
[1:47:35] turns its head the ties start running in
[1:47:38] now Isaiah 59 tells us that so shall
[1:47:42] they fear the name of the Lord from the
[1:47:43] West and his glory from the rising of
[1:47:45] the sun when the enemy shall come in
[1:47:47] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[1:47:49] shall lift up a standard against him and
[1:47:51] the Redeemer shall come come to Zion
[1:47:53] which is a type of the Bride amen and
[1:47:55] unto him that turned from transgressions
[1:47:57] and Jacob sayeth the Lord so you see the
[1:48:00] moon in the night
[1:48:04] time the word of God tells that there
[1:48:06] will be light in the evening
[1:48:10] time the moon reflects the light of the
[1:48:13] sun and the Rapture will take place the
[1:48:16] church will be taken home and then the
[1:48:19] tribulation will set in so I said
[1:48:23] there's not one bomb and I'm quoting the
[1:48:25] prophet there's not one bomb can that
[1:48:27] can drop unless we're taken out raptured
[1:48:32] away so it seems that the enemy comes in
[1:48:37] like a flood trying to take over our
[1:48:42] lives to bring depression to bring
[1:48:45] sickness to bring all kinds of things to
[1:48:47] say I'm going to pull and get you
[1:48:50] children
[1:48:54] but there's a bride on the
[1:48:56] earth that has received the open book
[1:49:00] and that can draw a limit because the
[1:49:04] moon when it turns
[1:49:07] its side the tie has to go in or
[1:49:12] out come on
[1:49:18] now we see even when Moses when they
[1:49:21] were between
[1:49:23] the sea and Pharaoh you know how the
[1:49:26] prophet says when oh Moses we're lost
[1:49:30] often some people they scream oh 2025 is
[1:49:33] going to be horrible no no not for
[1:49:36] me does that mean I will have no trials
[1:49:39] no sir no brother no sister but even in
[1:49:43] the trial in the deepest trial we can
[1:49:46] give glory to God because I know I have
[1:49:48] a wedding supper to attend and there's
[1:49:51] the uniting time going on right
[1:49:56] now sir amen so when the sea got in
[1:49:59] their way on the road to the promised
[1:50:01] land god looked
[1:50:03] down from the pillar of fire with Angry
[1:50:07] Eyes the pillar of fire hasn't left us
[1:50:11] people think the prophet has left so the
[1:50:12] pillar of no he's still present he's
[1:50:15] still a very present help in time of
[1:50:18] trouble amen now we see that in
[1:50:20] Revelation 10
[1:50:23] we see verse one and I saw another
[1:50:27] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:50:28] clothed with a with a cloud and a
[1:50:30] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:50:32] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:50:35] pillars of fire Hallelujah M and we know
[1:50:40] we have seen the prophet says headship
[1:50:43] is here now we have seen the cloud
[1:50:47] appear now if headship is here now where
[1:50:50] is his body
[1:50:53] we are his
[1:50:57] body Ephesians 1:22 and had put all
[1:51:01] things under his feet and gave him to be
[1:51:04] the head over all things to the church
[1:51:06] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:51:08] that fill it all in
[1:51:11] all and when he says hup is here you
[1:51:14] know what he says after that's the
[1:51:16] devil's
[1:51:19] answer you have any question head is
[1:51:23] here that's the devil's
[1:51:25] answer oh think of it
[1:51:28] Saints so what happened we read the
[1:51:31] angel come down feed as pillars of fire
[1:51:35] plural what happened in the upper room
[1:51:37] bear with me a
[1:51:39] moment when did I
[1:51:44] start what was God doing in the upper
[1:51:47] room he was separating them tongues of
[1:51:50] fire was separating that big pillar of
[1:51:52] fire and dividing himself among the
[1:51:55] people the Holy Ghost separated itself
[1:51:58] on the day of Pentecost God separating
[1:52:00] himself that day you'll know that I am
[1:52:03] in the Father the father in me and I in
[1:52:06] you and you in
[1:52:07] me amen thank you God was in one man
[1:52:11] Christ Jesus in him dwelt the fullness
[1:52:13] of the godhead bodily now when the
[1:52:15] pillar of fire came down and Pentecost
[1:52:16] notice tongues of fire set upon each of
[1:52:19] them that was God separating himself
[1:52:22] self or dividing himself from the pillar
[1:52:25] of fire into each member of his church
[1:52:29] amen now God could be universally all
[1:52:33] over everywhere at one
[1:52:38] time praise the
[1:52:42] Lord hallelujah and on the day of
[1:52:44] Pentecost when this great light that's
[1:52:47] why I said we're living in the season of
[1:52:49] light right amen
[1:52:53] we walk in the light amen when the great
[1:52:56] light came in there God divided himself
[1:52:59] we become God's own life in us the Holy
[1:53:02] Ghost God dividing himself making him
[1:53:05] Sons and
[1:53:07] Daughters yes you've heard it I know
[1:53:09] you've heard it I'm preaching to oh yes
[1:53:12] a word founded
[1:53:16] church but it's good to refresh our
[1:53:19] memory amen because Satan bombards es us
[1:53:24] so we we answer when he comes in with
[1:53:27] reasoning with doubt we answer him by
[1:53:29] the word with faith in the word of God
[1:53:34] and Revelation 10:2 says and he had in
[1:53:36] his hand a little book open and he set
[1:53:38] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:53:40] foot on the earth now we see there two
[1:53:43] beasts
[1:53:44] Rising bear with me a moment I'm trying
[1:53:46] to wind up here
[1:53:48] but it's a symbolic
[1:53:53] the Beast cannot come into power
[1:53:56] unless he lifts his feet from the earth
[1:54:01] until I Rapture my bride and my
[1:54:05] bride has her feet on your hates on your
[1:54:08] head
[1:54:14] Satan a beast comes out of the land you
[1:54:17] can read it and that's what is so
[1:54:19] amazing that
[1:54:21] people they and triy
[1:54:24] to explain many
[1:54:27] things but God himself came
[1:54:30] down with an open
[1:54:34] book that's why when John saw that no
[1:54:37] one was worthy he wept but then a bloody
[1:54:42] lamb came forward and could take the
[1:54:46] book and open the seals
[1:54:50] thereof why
[1:54:52] who was it
[1:54:57] for think about the privileged Saints
[1:55:00] think about the the honor we have think
[1:55:04] about what a beloved people we are am
[1:55:07] that's why I can yes exceedingly
[1:55:10] Rejoice Amen in the good and in the bad
[1:55:14] times because his word will never fail
[1:55:18] amen so the Beast that comes out the
[1:55:20] lamb there's this American Spirit sorry
[1:55:22] Saints I'm quite the prophet explains it
[1:55:25] very
[1:55:26] clearly all Fashions all things that
[1:55:29] come from Hollywood and all these things
[1:55:32] but oh we have received the light the
[1:55:35] open book and we can put our feet upon
[1:55:37] it head and even though we are living in
[1:55:41] L that's right lukewarm lah has no
[1:55:46] effect on me because in this lapse of
[1:55:49] time of laa we're living in the bride a
[1:55:52] because we have been called out
[1:55:57] of so L this here has no impact on me I
[1:56:01] can put my feet on Satan's
[1:56:07] head Brother David you're oldfashioned
[1:56:10] give me that old time religion give me
[1:56:12] that old time religion it was good for
[1:56:15] brother random it was good for brother
[1:56:17] Paul and it's good enough for
[1:56:20] me Hallelujah amen amen so then there's
[1:56:24] a beast that comes out of the sea Rome
[1:56:26] amen and we are not bound by any
[1:56:29] doctrine of Trinity we're not bound by
[1:56:32] popes we're not bound by Bishops we're
[1:56:34] not bound by
[1:56:38] headquarters amen come on Saints amen
[1:56:42] we're not bound by the Antichrist
[1:56:43] Spirits amen but they are under our feet
[1:56:48] as long as the bride is on the earth
[1:56:50] amen this Beast cannot come in into
[1:56:53] power thank the
[1:56:55] Lord cu the Holy Spirit In Our Lives
[1:56:58] makes us Spillers of fire plural Glory
[1:57:03] praise the Lord and we put him under our
[1:57:06] feet Yes s why cuz greater is he that is
[1:57:09] in us than he that is against
[1:57:13] us let me tell you we are not a defeated
[1:57:18] people we are not a defeated bride
[1:57:21] that's right we're an overcoming people
[1:57:24] we are a chosen people for such a time
[1:57:27] as this amen amen we can rise above
[1:57:31] every trial every Temptation amen and
[1:57:33] the prophet says and let them know that
[1:57:35] they can possess the Gate of every enemy
[1:57:37] because every enemy has been put under
[1:57:40] the feet of Christ and every enemy is
[1:57:43] under your
[1:57:45] feet you see how he makes it personal is
[1:57:48] under your feet as long as you are in
[1:57:51] Christ because everything is under his
[1:57:53] feet how do we get into him by one
[1:57:56] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:57:59] and we've been made
[1:58:02] partakers right
[1:58:04] partakers that means we have a
[1:58:10] partall of the same blessing the same
[1:58:14] power yes s so we did not receive just a
[1:58:18] little message a boohoo hooo
[1:58:20] message yeah
[1:58:24] we have received
[1:58:25] a
[1:58:27] sure
[1:58:29] certain word of
[1:58:32] God coming from God himself to his
[1:58:38] bride and that's what is going on now as
[1:58:41] he reveals himself service after service
[1:58:45] day after day amen every member of the
[1:58:48] Bride receive not all at the same time
[1:58:52] but at God's appointed time and when the
[1:58:54] last one will come in and realizes
[1:58:58] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:00] and when we realize who we are amen then
[1:59:04] the Rapture will take
[1:59:06] place Lord so when you realize the power
[1:59:10] the moon has not by itself but by
[1:59:14] reflecting that's why he says you have
[1:59:16] to go to the angel and eat the go take
[1:59:19] the open book eat the open book yes sir
[1:59:24] representing what so you become the
[1:59:29] book the word becomes you and you become
[1:59:32] the word amen and although many people
[1:59:35] can say well and when the seventh seal
[1:59:37] opens there was a silence for half an
[1:59:38] hour many people think sh there has to
[1:59:41] be
[1:59:42] silence please don't Worship in church
[1:59:47] what if you don't cry out these Stones
[1:59:51] no that's what
[1:59:54] these stones will cry
[1:59:56] out and what happens during the lapse of
[2:00:00] silence for about a half an hour what is
[2:00:02] he doing as the headship is here he's
[2:00:05] revealing his secrets to his bride and
[2:00:08] as she receives the word as she receives
[2:00:11] her true identity amen she rejoices she
[2:00:14] gives Glory when the seals are open amen
[2:00:17] the prophet says that John which is a
[2:00:20] type of the Bride when he saw his name
[2:00:23] amen when first it was crying but then
[2:00:26] when he saw that he opened the book he
[2:00:29] shouted he rejoiced everything in heaven
[2:00:32] everything on Earth and everything under
[2:00:34] the Earth
[2:00:37] shouted
[2:00:39] Hallelujah glory be to God and you know
[2:00:42] why I love how the prophet
[2:00:44] says he
[2:00:46] says he must have
[2:00:48] looked beyond the curtain of time
[2:00:53] and
[2:00:54] say there's
[2:00:57] John and there's another quote maybe I'm
[2:01:01] sure you know and I love it and I take
[2:01:03] it for me where the Prophet says and
[2:01:06] I've seen you all over
[2:01:10] there talking about ex exceeding extreme
[2:01:15] enjoying my I know where I come from by
[2:01:19] God's grace and I know where I'm going
[2:01:22] I'm not from this Earth I come from God
[2:01:25] and I go back to
[2:01:27] God amen amen amen isn't he wonderful
[2:01:31] Glory let me wind up amen so we see that
[2:01:36] God gave his voice to us amen
[2:01:40] so she's already united we go to the
[2:01:44] wedding supper we're not going to the
[2:01:47] wedding we're going to the wedding
[2:01:49] supper the wedding is here yes he says
[2:01:53] not the marriage we're going to the
[2:01:54] wedding Supper The Rapture is going to
[2:01:55] the wedding supper when the word here
[2:01:57] unites with the person and the two
[2:02:00] become one and then what does it do it
[2:02:04] manifests the son of man
[2:02:08] again and whatever the son of man done
[2:02:11] he was the word the church does the same
[2:02:16] thing
[2:02:17] amen the church does the same thing I'm
[2:02:20] not going to go into but Esther which is
[2:02:23] a glorious type of the bride and the
[2:02:27] bridegroom there's so
[2:02:29] many I'm not going to call them nuggets
[2:02:32] because they're atomic
[2:02:34] bombs that shows us that God's word
[2:02:39] cannot
[2:02:41] fail and whatever that he has sealed
[2:02:44] like amen he says Amen in Esther 8
[2:02:47] whatever the king is whatever write ye
[2:02:51] also for the Jews as it like at you in
[2:02:52] the king's
[2:02:55] name and seal it with the king's ring
[2:02:58] for the writing which is written in the
[2:03:00] king's name and sealed with the king's
[2:03:01] Ring May no man
[2:03:06] reverse the
[2:03:09] book God wrote it yes he wrote my name
[2:03:13] we heard it in the beginning my name in
[2:03:14] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:03:16] foundation of the world he sealed it
[2:03:20] thank you Lord Satan would have
[2:03:22] but Satan is out of the
[2:03:25] picture he's but a bluff the prophet
[2:03:28] says he's but a stump on the side of the
[2:03:31] road but it's our duty to put him under
[2:03:34] our feet to put him in his rightful
[2:03:38] position amen so thank God for a sealed
[2:03:41] word and God himself comes down and in
[2:03:44] our generation to open the seals thereof
[2:03:49] and to
[2:03:50] reveal you are my
[2:03:52] precious you are my
[2:03:56] beloved and we are uniting here and
[2:03:59] getting ready for the wedding
[2:04:04] supper and nobody can reverse nobody can
[2:04:09] revoke it can change it can can take my
[2:04:13] name away think of it nobody can erase
[2:04:17] my name
[2:04:23] that's why when he the prophet speaks
[2:04:26] about Oneness about the deity he says
[2:04:30] that's makes Satan
[2:04:33] mad how many here love to make Satan
[2:04:38] mad we shouldn't be afraid and we should
[2:04:41] act according to the
[2:04:43] word that's what shakes
[2:04:49] him he says I am the word and if you
[2:04:52] want deity in your midst then welcome
[2:04:53] and receive the
[2:04:56] word deity is not in heaven it's in you
[2:05:00] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:05:02] Ghost thank
[2:05:04] you so I'd like to take wind up with
[2:05:08] this and I'm sure you heard a
[2:05:12] story about a painting how how Satan I
[2:05:15] just go to I said Satan is but a bluff
[2:05:20] yeah and there's a painting that is
[2:05:22] hanging or used to hang in Lou in Paris
[2:05:26] maybe some of you have
[2:05:28] visited beautiful place and if you go
