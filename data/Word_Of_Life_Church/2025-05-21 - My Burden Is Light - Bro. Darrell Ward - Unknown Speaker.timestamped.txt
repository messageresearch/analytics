[33:15] he walks
[33:18] beside
[33:21] me and heaven is in my
[33:27] you.
[33:29] Oh,
[33:31] I'm going to
[33:35] make
[33:37] it
[33:40] [Music]
[33:46] through. Tired of the
[33:50] good intentions I've had.
[33:55] Sometimes my strength can
[34:01] fail.
[34:02] Though I have tried the very best that I
[34:09] could, my
[34:12] weaknesses
[34:14] [Music]
[34:17] prevail. Then I
[34:21] remember the promise he
[34:25] made that in my
[34:28] weakness
[34:30] he is
[34:32] strong. And that's when I
[34:36] know
[34:38] whatever may
[34:40] come is steady
[34:44] hand
[34:48] me and
[34:50] I'm going to make
[34:55] it. He's already said that I
[35:04] would. And
[35:06] I'll keep on
[35:11] trusting that he's working everything
[35:15] for my good.
[35:20] And
[35:21] he walks
[35:23] beside
[35:26] me and
[35:28] heaven is in my view.
[35:34] Oh,
[35:36] I'm going to
[35:39] make
[35:41] it
[35:45] [Music]
[35:49] through.
[35:51] I'm going to make it.
[35:57] He's already said that I
[36:04] would. And
[36:06] I keep on
[36:11] trusting that he's working everything
[36:15] for my
[36:17] [Applause]
[36:17] [Music]
[36:19] good. And
[36:21] he walks beside me.
[36:27] And heaven is in my
[36:32] view.
[36:34] Oh,
[36:36] I'm going to
[36:39] make
[36:41] you
[36:49] through. And
[36:51] he walks beside me.
[36:57] And heaven is in my
[37:02] view.
[37:04] Oh,
[37:06] I'm going to
[37:09] make
[37:11] you
[37:15] [Music]
[37:21] through.
[37:23] [Applause]
[37:36] [Music]
[37:44] Amazing
[37:46] grace, how
[37:48] sweet the sound
[37:52] that called my
[37:55] heart
[37:58] awake. The
[38:00] veil was
[38:02] torn. The truth came
[38:06] down. No
[38:08] more. The
[38:10] road of
[38:14] fake. From
[38:16] tapes
[38:18] only. I
[38:20] walk
[38:22] away. God
[38:24] opened up my
[38:29] eyes. The
[38:31] word
[38:33] alive. It began to
[38:37] blaze and
[38:39] broke
[38:41] deceptions ties.
[38:45] My chains are
[38:47] gone. I've been set
[38:51] free. The Lord
[38:55] himself revealed to
[38:57] [Music]
[38:59] me. That truth still
[39:03] preached alive and
[39:06] pure in Jesus
[39:10] Christ. I'm safe and
[39:15] sure in
[39:17] Jeff first sunville I once had
[39:22] stayed but
[39:25] question
[39:26] stirred
[39:30] inside I
[39:32] prayed oh Lord please show the
[39:37] way he never
[39:41] did not
[39:44] die. My chains are
[39:48] gone. I've been set
[39:52] free. The Lord
[39:55] himself revealed to
[39:59] me. That truth still
[40:03] preached alive and
[40:07] pure in Jesus Christ.
[40:10] [Music]
[40:12] I'm safe and
[40:13] [Music]
[40:15] sure to John sinc
[40:19] city I was
[40:23] led the
[40:25] message strong and
[40:30] pure where the
[40:33] path preaches what
[40:36] profit
[40:38] said and
[40:40] Christ alone A home draws
[40:44] near. No man is
[40:48] placed above that
[40:52] voice. I'm thankful
[40:55] for this holy
[40:59] stand where the truth and
[41:03] freedom it still is.
[41:08] And Christ
[41:10] alone, he draws so
[41:14] near. My chains are
[41:18] gone. I've been set
[41:22] free. The Lord
[41:26] himself revealed to
[41:29] me. Now I
[41:33] rejoice in word and light.

[46:39] Where would we be without him?
[46:43] I'm so glad in such a troublesome time
[46:47] that we have peace and we can rest on
[46:50] the word of God knowing that emotions
[46:53] will fail us, sensations will fail us,
[46:55] nations, governments, politicians, but
[46:57] the word of God will never fail us.
[47:00] Amen. You know, as we've said it many,
[47:02] many times, the prophet said it many,
[47:03] many times. Jesus never ever said, "Did
[47:06] you feel it?" But he did say, "Did you
[47:09] believe it?" "If thou can believe."
[47:13] Amen. It's the theme of the bride. Amen.
[47:15] It's all he ever asked us to do was to
[47:17] believe him. Amen. So, we're grateful
[47:20] for that tonight. If you have your
[47:21] Bible, turn with us to the book of
[47:22] Matthew. Want to read from Matthew
[47:23] chapter 28 starting at verse one. We
[47:26] certainly appreciate the song service
[47:29] and the presence of the Lord that we
[47:31] feel among us this evening. and we just
[47:33] trust the Lord will get us out of the
[47:36] way that he can speak to your heart
[47:37] tonight. It's just a simple little
[47:38] thought, but it's really the only kind
[47:40] that I can bring, but we trust it'll be
[47:42] a a blessing to you. But we want to read
[47:45] from Matthew chapter chapter 28 starting
[47:47] at verse
[47:48] one. Amen. Certainly uh heard some good
[47:52] reports of the over the weekend. We
[47:55] hated to to miss it. It's one of the bad
[47:58] things about being an evangelist. you
[48:00] don't get to stay home too often and you
[48:02] miss a lot of things. And I I remember
[48:04] one time at at Happy Valley, I I went
[48:07] into the bathroom after service and
[48:09] there's a brother there and he said,
[48:11] "Where do you go to
[48:14] church?" I said, "I go here." He said,
[48:18] "Well, who are you?" I said, I thought I
[48:21] need to stay home more
[48:23] often. He said, "Oh, I'm sorry, brother
[48:25] Daryl." He said, "I stream and I I
[48:26] didn't recognize you, but just so
[48:29] comical." We said, "Where do you go to
[48:30] church?" I thought, "I've been here
[48:32] since I was a little boy." Amen. May the
[48:35] Lord bless you. Matthew 28, starting at
[48:37] verse one. Do you love him tonight?
[48:40] The Bible says this, "In the end of the
[48:42] Sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the
[48:44] first day of the week, came Mary
[48:46] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[48:48] tomb. And behold, there was a great
[48:50] earthquake, for the angel of the Lord
[48:52] descended from heaven, and came and
[48:54] rolled back the stone from the door and
[48:55] sat upon it. and his countenance was
[48:58] like lightning and his remnant white as
[49:01] snow. And for fear of him the keepers
[49:03] did shake and became as dead men. And
[49:07] the angel answered and said unto the
[49:09] women, "Fear not, for I know that ye
[49:12] seek Jesus which was
[49:15] crucified. He is not here, for he is
[49:18] risen as he said. Come see the place
[49:23] where the Lord laid, and go quickly, and
[49:27] tell his disciples that he has risen
[49:29] from the dead. And behold, he goeth
[49:32] before you into the Galilean, there
[49:34] shall you see him, for lo, I have told
[49:37] you. And they departed quickly from the
[49:39] tomb with fear and great joy, and did
[49:41] run to bring his disciples word. And as
[49:44] they went to tell his disciples, behold,
[49:46] Jesus met them, saying, All
[49:49] hell. And they came and held him by the
[49:51] feet and worshiped him. Then said Jesus
[49:55] unto them, "Be not
[49:57] afraid, go tell my brethren." Glory. Go
[50:02] tell my brethren that they go into
[50:04] Galilee, and there shall they see me.
[50:09] May the Lord add his blessing to the
[50:10] reading of his word. We want to speak to
[50:13] you for a few minutes this evening on my
[50:15] burden is
[50:18] light. And we take a little thought out
[50:20] of that of
[50:21] barriers of light. The bearers of
[50:26] light. Heavenly
[50:29] Father, Lord, we are so grateful to be
[50:31] living in this
[50:33] hour as we see, Lord, the things that
[50:36] your prophet has told us coming to pass
[50:39] right before our very eyes, Lord, of a
[50:41] pope coming out of the United States.
[50:44] today, Lord. Uh, Brother Donnie sent me
[50:46] that
[50:47] little text, Lord, of the car that they
[50:50] were saying now that you can purchase
[50:52] for so many thousands of dollars and
[50:54] it'll drive you down the road and you'll
[50:56] be able to to to sleep or watch a movie
[50:58] or play a game. And oh, God, how we're
[51:01] so grateful, Lord, to be living in the
[51:03] hour that the very prophecies are being
[51:05] fulfilled before our very eyes. And
[51:08] Lord, we see the condition of the world.
[51:09] And you said, "When these things begin
[51:10] to come to pass, you told us, Lord, to
[51:12] lift up our eyes, for our redemption
[51:14] drawth nigh." And Lord, it stirs our
[51:16] hearts to know if that part of the
[51:18] prophecy is true, then the rest of it's
[51:20] true also, Lord. For you said, "In this
[51:22] hour there shall be light in the evening
[51:24] time." And Lord, may the revelation
[51:26] strike our hearts tonight just what that
[51:28] light is, Lord. And we pray, dear God,
[51:31] for the needs of your people. For Lord,
[51:33] we believe that you are our healer and
[51:35] the sustainer of our lives, Lord. for
[51:37] those that are afflicted and able to be
[51:38] here tonight and sick and body. I pray
[51:41] in the name of Jesus by the same
[51:43] anointing that raised my Lord from the
[51:45] grave, may it move, dear God, upon their
[51:47] lives and restore their health. For you
[51:49] said in your word, I will restore saith
[51:51] the Lord. Y bless your people tonight,
[51:54] Lord. We pray as we commit this service
[51:56] into your hands for your glory in Jesus
[51:58] name. And the saints said, "Amen." God
[52:01] bless you. You may be seated. Now, in
[52:03] our scripture reading this evening, we
[52:05] find that Mary and Martha is making her
[52:06] way down to the tomb of Jesus. And as
[52:09] they were making their way down to the
[52:10] tomb, there was a great earthquake. And
[52:13] an angel, oh my, descended from heaven,
[52:16] and rolled away the stone, and sat upon
[52:19] the stone. And the keepers of the grave,
[52:23] they did shake, and became as dead men.
[52:25] And the angel said unto Mary and Martha,
[52:27] "Fear not, for I know that you seek
[52:29] Jesus, but he is not here. He has risen
[52:33] as he has said. And go quickly and tell
[52:36] his disciples that he has risen from the
[52:38] dead. And behold, he goeth before you
[52:39] into Galilee, and there shall ye see
[52:41] him. For lo, I have told you. Now Jesus
[52:44] said before his crucifixion in John
[52:46] 21:19, he said these words unto them,
[52:49] "Destroy this temple, and in three days
[52:51] I will raise it up again."
[52:53] Now we see the fulfillment of this that
[52:55] the angel is now coming forth after 3
[52:58] days of a dead cold dark tomb comes a
[53:02] message from God through the lips of an
[53:04] angel messenger that he is alive. So we
[53:07] see that as Mary and Martha was making
[53:10] their way to the tomb to see the body of
[53:12] Jesus they are met by an angel and this
[53:15] angel has come to the church because
[53:17] remember now a woman types the church.
[53:19] Is that what the prophet of God said? So
[53:21] we see now that these women are typing
[53:23] the church and the angel comes to the
[53:25] church with a fresh urgent message. Go
[53:28] tell his disciples he is alive. Now
[53:31] notice this message did not come to the
[53:33] world for he said a little while the
[53:35] world will see me no more but ye shall
[53:36] see me for I'll be with you even in you.
[53:39] So the message didn't come to the world
[53:40] but he said go tell my disciples. Amen.
[53:44] In a little while the world see me no
[53:45] more but ye shall see me. The message
[53:48] came to his disciples. So here comes the
[53:52] women, the church. See, and the angel
[53:53] that has brought the message. Now he
[53:55] places this burden upon these sisters
[53:58] who is a type of the church to bring the
[54:00] gospel light to the disciples who are
[54:02] still in the cold darkness of despair
[54:05] because Jesus had been taken from them
[54:07] and the burden was placed upon them to
[54:09] go tell them I am alive. Now this
[54:11] message that's going to be brought it
[54:13] will not be a secondhand religion. It
[54:15] won't say, "Well, you know, we don't
[54:17] know, but that's what the angel said,
[54:18] but we don't really know." But it will
[54:20] not be just a secondhand experience, but
[54:22] it'll actually be a firsthand
[54:24] experience. For as Mary and Martha were
[54:27] making their way back, Jesus himself
[54:29] appeared before them and said, "Oh,
[54:31] hell," which means, "Oh, joy." And they
[54:33] came and held him by the feet and
[54:34] worshiped him. Now, after the appearing
[54:36] of the Lord, now they're running with
[54:38] not only with the message of he is
[54:40] risen, but now they're running with the
[54:41] message of where he is.
[54:45] Not only are they running with the
[54:47] message that he's living, but they're
[54:48] running with the message he's here.
[54:50] Amen. And Mary and Martha ran with this
[54:52] message with the proof of life. Now, a
[54:55] lot of times when someone is kidnapped
[54:56] and and they're helped for ransom,
[54:58] people who are holding up for for
[55:00] ransom, they'll ask for for a payment.
[55:03] So the people that's paying the money,
[55:05] they want what they call the proof of
[55:06] life. And they want something that will
[55:08] let them know that the person is still
[55:10] living. Like a phrase that only they
[55:12] would know or or a song or something,
[55:14] some kind of proof of life to show
[55:16] before they pay the money that the
[55:18] person is still actually alive. Now
[55:20] remember when Jesus walked on the road
[55:22] to the two to to Emmas and they got into
[55:25] the little room, the Bible said that he
[55:27] took and he broke the bread. And when he
[55:29] broke the bread, he done it just the way
[55:31] he did before the crucifixion. And their
[55:33] eyes were open and they knew that it was
[55:35] Jesus that he was alive. Now Mary and
[55:38] Martha is running with this message and
[55:40] a proof of life that not only said,
[55:42] "I've seen him and I've touched him.
[55:44] He's alive. He's well and he's here."
[55:48] Now the burden of bringing that message
[55:49] of light was given to the church. The
[55:52] burden was placed on the church. You go
[55:55] tell them I'm alive.
[55:58] Now Mary and Martha, the message was
[56:00] more than just words. Amen. They had
[56:03] actually experienced what they were
[56:05] saying.
[56:07] And the burden was placed upon them to
[56:09] go tell my brethren not only is he alive
[56:13] but I am here. Amen. Now we see in the
[56:16] scripture that Paul in Thessalonians 15,
[56:19] he said, "For our gospel came unto you
[56:21] not in word only but also in power and
[56:24] in the Holy Ghost and in much asuranc as
[56:26] you know what manner of men we were
[56:28] among you for your sake." Paul said, "We
[56:30] didn't come with just quotes. We didn't
[56:32] come with just a few tracks, but we come
[56:34] with power and authority with the word
[56:36] of God and the Holy Ghost to back it up.
[56:39] We come with the assurance that Jesus is
[56:42] with us. Not only is he risen, but he is
[56:45] here. And Paul knew that burden to bring
[56:49] the gospel was placed upon him. For Paul
[56:52] knew it was. He said he found out that
[56:54] he was harnessed to something like you
[56:55] put a horse in a harness to it to pull
[56:57] something. And Paul knew after this
[56:59] experience and three and a half years of
[57:01] typing the experience that he had with
[57:03] the Bible, he realized that God had
[57:05] chosen him and harnessed him by the Holy
[57:09] Spirit to pull the gospel life into the
[57:12] present of the Gentiles. The spirit
[57:14] itself harnessed him. He was yolked to
[57:18] the gospel,
[57:20] but not just word only, not just pass
[57:23] out some tracks, but he come in the
[57:26] power and demonstration of the Holy
[57:28] Spirit that the life that was in Christ
[57:30] was now being represented in his church.
[57:33] Amen.
[57:35] Amen. Jesus said in Matthew 11:30, he
[57:38] said, "For my yoke is easy and my burden
[57:43] is light."
[57:44] Now the prophet told us scripture has a
[57:47] compound meaning and I believe that
[57:49] Jesus was saying come all ye that are
[57:51] heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[57:53] Take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[57:55] and I will give you rest for my yoke is
[57:57] easy and my burden is light. Now we know
[58:01] Jesus was talking about that. But I want
[58:03] to take this saying my burden is light.
[58:06] And I want to look at that phrase for
[58:08] just a few minutes if you allow me to.
[58:11] My yoke is easy. My burden is light.
[58:16] Now, burden according to Webster means
[58:18] exactly what you're thinking. It means
[58:19] right now. It means what most of us
[58:22] think about it. A burden that is it's a
[58:24] load or something oppressive or
[58:25] something that's worrisome. But
[58:27] according to Webster, there's another
[58:30] definition of burden. And it also means
[58:33] a duty or a
[58:36] responsibility. Glory. Jesus said, "My
[58:39] duty, my
[58:41] responsibility is
[58:43] light." And at a very early age, Jesus
[58:46] knew what his purpose was for when he
[58:48] was but 12 year old. His mother, you
[58:52] know, they lost him and they traveled
[58:53] back three days. And where did they find
[58:55] him? They found him in the temple. And
[58:57] Mary said, "Your father and I have
[58:59] sought you with tears." And Jesus being
[59:03] the word corrected the error. Yes. He
[59:06] said, "Know ye not. I must be about my
[59:09] father's business." Now, Joseph was a
[59:12] carpenter, but Jesus wasn't in there
[59:14] getting contracts.
[59:17] So, the father he was speaking of was
[59:19] not Joseph.
[59:22] Hallelujah. But he was in the temple
[59:24] expounding on the word. His duty, his
[59:27] responsibility was to do the father's
[59:30] business. Amen. Amen.
[59:33] Look, when you place a grain of sea uh
[59:36] seed in the ground and it comes up,
[59:39] there are carriers, there are shucks
[59:42] that carries the grain. They carry the
[59:45] seed to maturity to bring it back to
[59:48] grain again. And you harvest it. You
[59:51] harvest it when it reaches the ability
[59:54] to reproduce itself again. If you
[59:56] harvest it before it reaches maturity,
[59:59] it can never reproduce itself. So, you
[1:00:01] plant it and there's all kinds of shucks
[1:00:03] and carriers that bring the seed up. But
[1:00:05] when it comes back to the original seed,
[1:00:08] when it comes back to maturity, then you
[1:00:10] can harvest it because you can have
[1:00:12] another crop. Amen. And brother Ben
[1:00:15] speaking of this and the seed is not air
[1:00:17] was shook. He said, "Now notice there
[1:00:19] will be no more carriers, mother
[1:00:21] churches, denominations. After this
[1:00:23] carrier shook because after the shuck,
[1:00:25] there's no more. There's nothing left
[1:00:27] but them and just the grain."
[1:00:31] Is that right? It's got to be grain.
[1:00:33] It's got to be the same kind that went
[1:00:35] into the ground.
[1:00:38] Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today,
[1:00:41] and forever. And a spirit come upon the
[1:00:44] bride to do the same thing he did.
[1:00:47] What's it doing? It's reproducing again
[1:00:50] the grain. Amen.
[1:00:53] What is that spirit that comes up on the
[1:00:55] church? It is the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:58] The life that he lived. Can you say amen
[1:01:00] to that?
[1:01:03] And that comes back upon the bride. What
[1:01:06] for? Not to make an organization. Not to
[1:01:09] make a denomination. Not to be a man
[1:01:11] follower. No sir. But what for? To
[1:01:14] reproduce Jesus Christ again. making him
[1:01:17] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:01:19] That we don't have to go back to 65 and
[1:01:21] find the God of history. That God of 65
[1:01:24] is the God of 2025 doing the same thing
[1:01:27] now in his bride. Amen.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] Amen. Notice Jesus. The word yet young.
[1:01:36] Well, when I get old, I'll do something.
[1:01:38] He was 12 years old. The word yet young
[1:01:42] spake for itself. No, you not. I must be
[1:01:46] about my father's business. And the
[1:01:51] prophet said, "There's the secret of the
[1:01:53] message." Now, just exactly the father's
[1:01:57] business. What is the father's business?
[1:02:00] Could you think of what the father's
[1:02:02] business was to him? What was the
[1:02:04] father? I must be about what is the
[1:02:07] business? To fulfill what Isaiah said.
[1:02:12] His business was to fulfill the words of
[1:02:15] the prophets.
[1:02:18] Amen.
[1:02:20] To fulfill what Isaiah said, "A virgin
[1:02:22] shall conceive." To fulfill what Isaiah
[1:02:24] said again, "The lame shall leap like a
[1:02:26] heart, and all these things that would
[1:02:27] take place like Moses said, the Lord
[1:02:30] your God shall raise up a prophet like
[1:02:32] it unto me." It was the father's
[1:02:34] business to fulfill the words of the
[1:02:38] prophet. Oh, hallelujah. Well, if it
[1:02:41] come down through them stalks of them
[1:02:42] natural women, what about these stalks
[1:02:44] of these spiritual churches women? Women
[1:02:46] means churches. See, is that right? Then
[1:02:47] what is it now? We must be about the
[1:02:49] father's business. The wheat would cry
[1:02:53] back. The grain, the wheat would cry
[1:02:56] back. Then what does that tell us? The
[1:02:58] bride is not immune.
[1:03:01] She has a voice. For she'll have thus
[1:03:03] saith the Lord or keep still.
[1:03:08] Amen. She'll not be a freak bride.
[1:03:11] She'll not have a finger missing or a
[1:03:12] leg missing or an eye missing. And she
[1:03:14] can talk but can't hear and hear but
[1:03:16] can't talk. No sir. A perfect bride for
[1:03:18] a perfect bridegroom.
[1:03:23] Amen.
[1:03:24] Hallelujah. Amen. We must be about the
[1:03:27] father's business. The wheat would cry
[1:03:28] back. Yes, sir. The grain. We have a
[1:03:30] duty. We have a burden. Not just to set
[1:03:33] on a pew, not a creed, not a
[1:03:36] denomination. What must we do?
[1:03:39] We must vindicate Malachi 4, vindicate
[1:03:42] Luke 17:30, vindicate Hebrews 13:8,
[1:03:46] vindicate St. John 14:12, vindicate all
[1:03:49] of his word.
[1:03:52] Who was Christ? He was the fullness of
[1:03:55] the word. Who is the bride? The fullness
[1:03:57] of the word.
[1:04:02] Amen. Oh, God. I see it, but I want to
[1:04:05] see it more. Amen.
[1:04:08] Do you believe him, friends?
[1:04:11] Amen. To vindicate all of his word,
[1:04:13] vindicate Revelations 10th chapter, the
[1:04:15] opener of the seven seals and the
[1:04:17] mystery of God, even the serpent seed,
[1:04:18] and all would be manifested, marriage
[1:04:20] and divorce, and all these other
[1:04:21] mysteries that's been hidden under the
[1:04:23] pillars from these years from
[1:04:25] theologians and so forth. But it's now
[1:04:27] the hour that the father's business,
[1:04:31] Amen. That's the father's business. It's
[1:04:33] now the hour for what? To vindicate. to
[1:04:36] vindicate this message.
[1:04:41] Not by a website. Not by a website. No
[1:04:44] sir. How will we vindicate this message?
[1:04:47] Because the message will become flesh.
[1:04:50] Vindicated. How? By manifesting it in
[1:04:53] our lives. Amen. Not a quote, not a tape
[1:04:56] player, but a life lived by the word. Is
[1:04:58] the word expressed?
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:04] Oh, hallelujah. Do you see it, friends?
[1:05:07] Do you see who you are? It's Noel
[1:05:10] someday. No, no, it's now. We are now
[1:05:13] sons and daughters of God.
[1:05:16] I didn't come to mix up a doctrine. I
[1:05:18] come to straighten one out, to get away
[1:05:19] from this fear and scare that you don't
[1:05:21] know who you are. You're not going to
[1:05:22] be, but you are now sons and daughters
[1:05:25] of God. You always were sons and
[1:05:27] daughters of God. He wrote my name. He
[1:05:32] wrote your name with Jesus. He wrote
[1:05:35] your name with Jesus
[1:05:38] in the lamb's book of life. Before the
[1:05:40] foundation of the world, before there
[1:05:43] was a star, before there was air. Come
[1:05:45] on, somebody. He wrote your name.
[1:05:53] The mayor of Johnson City don't know me.
[1:05:55] The governor of Tennessee, he don't know
[1:05:57] me. Donald Trump, he don't know me. But
[1:05:59] the God who created the heavens and the
[1:06:02] earth, he knows my name.
[1:06:10] be about the father's business to what?
[1:06:12] To vindicate these things. Vindicated
[1:06:14] how? By manifesting it in our
[1:06:17] lives. Re said, "You think they'll
[1:06:19] receive it?" They don't want it. Said,
[1:06:22] "Our denomination don't teach us that."
[1:06:24] Well, the Baptists don't teach that.
[1:06:27] That's why I'm not there.
[1:06:29] Presbyterians don't teach that. That's
[1:06:31] why I'm not there. The Bible teaches it.
[1:06:34] That's why I'm here.
[1:06:37] Thank you, Lord. I think they'll receive
[1:06:39] it. They want to be dignified. Says,
[1:06:40] "Our denomination don't teach us that,
[1:06:42] but the Bible does, and God vindicates
[1:06:45] it to be true."
[1:06:47] Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:51] Amen.
[1:06:53] Jesus burden, his burden, his duty, his
[1:06:56] responsibility was to bring that gospel
[1:06:59] light, the light of the father, the
[1:07:01] logos to bring it before the people to
[1:07:03] fulfill the promised word. My burden is
[1:07:07] light. My
[1:07:08] responsibility is light. He said in John
[1:07:12] 12:46, I am come a light into the world
[1:07:15] that whosoever should believeth on me
[1:07:18] shall not abide in darkness. Then spake
[1:07:21] Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the
[1:07:23] light of the world. He that followeth me
[1:07:25] shall not walk in darkness, but shall
[1:07:28] have the light of
[1:07:31] life. John 12:27. And now my soul is
[1:07:34] troubled. And what shall I say? Father,
[1:07:36] save me for this hour, for this cause
[1:07:39] came I into this hour. What was he
[1:07:42] saying? I am here fulfilling what the
[1:07:44] word said I would do. What the word said
[1:07:47] I will be. What the word says I am.
[1:07:50] Jesus had perfect faith because he knew
[1:07:52] who he was in the word. You will have
[1:07:54] perfect faith when you realize the word
[1:07:56] is speaking of you.
[1:08:00] Hallelujah. From this hour for this
[1:08:02] cause I came into this hour. Pilate
[1:08:04] therefore said unto him, "Art thou a
[1:08:06] king?" Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that
[1:08:08] I am a king. To this end was I born, and
[1:08:11] for this cause came I into the world
[1:08:14] that I should bear witness of the truth.
[1:08:18] And everyone that is of truth heareth my
[1:08:22] voice.
[1:08:24] Have you heard his voice?
[1:08:28] Amen.
[1:08:30] Think of it. Think of this. The logos of
[1:08:34] God came down, picked up some dust,
[1:08:36] blowed into it, and stepped into this
[1:08:39] dust. The logos of God picked up some
[1:08:41] dust, stepped into it, and talked to
[1:08:44] Abraham and told our father Abraham, "I
[1:08:47] will give you a son." And that same God
[1:08:52] came in the flesh of Jesus. He was
[1:08:54] yolked to the father in so much he said,
[1:08:56] "I only do what I see him do. Let not
[1:08:59] your hearts be troubled. If you believe
[1:09:01] in God, believe also in me. For I and my
[1:09:05] father are one. The same God that picked
[1:09:08] up dust, blew in it, stepped in it, and
[1:09:10] spoke to our father Abraham, that same
[1:09:13] God became flesh in Jesus Christ.
[1:09:19] What is it? The prophet said, the same
[1:09:21] pillar of fire that followed the
[1:09:23] children of Israel. It's the same thing
[1:09:25] here today. The same Christ, any Bible
[1:09:28] student knows that pillar of fire that
[1:09:29] led the children of Israel through the
[1:09:31] wilderness was the angel of the
[1:09:32] covenant. Christ the logos that went out
[1:09:35] of God in the beginning and when it was
[1:09:36] made flesh and dwelt in a human body
[1:09:38] here on the earth named Jesus. Look what
[1:09:41] it did then. Look what it did when it
[1:09:43] come down in some flesh and talked to
[1:09:44] Abraham. Look what it did when it was
[1:09:46] here on the earth and talked in
[1:09:48] Galilee. The same God who picked up dust
[1:09:52] and spoke to Abraham is the same God who
[1:09:55] picked up the body of Jesus and walked
[1:09:57] the shores of Galilee.
[1:10:01] Do you believe that?
[1:10:05] If you believe that, you've got to
[1:10:06] believe the rest of it. Well, here it
[1:10:08] is. Here it is. Back again
[1:10:11] tonight, dwelling in all of us.
[1:10:19] The same God that picked up dust and
[1:10:22] spoke to Abraham is the same God who
[1:10:24] walked in the body of Jesus on the
[1:10:26] shores of Galilee. is the same God that
[1:10:28] is in his church tonight. Amen.
[1:10:35] It's here back again tonight. It's here
[1:10:37] back again tonight. It's here back again
[1:10:40] tonight. Dwelling in all of us. The
[1:10:43] universal church doing the same thing.
[1:10:45] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:10:48] and forever.
[1:10:51] Now the prophet, he picked up on the
[1:10:53] people when he was preaching it. He felt
[1:10:55] him pull back and he said, "Now to clear
[1:10:57] your minds," he said, "I feel it. I feel
[1:11:00] it." To clear your minds, you're saying,
[1:11:03] "Christ is not a light." The prophet
[1:11:05] picked up on it because some of the
[1:11:07] people when he was expressing this, some
[1:11:09] of the people were saying, "But Christ
[1:11:10] is not a light." And brother Brandham
[1:11:12] said, "Now to clear your mind because I
[1:11:14] feel
[1:11:16] it. Christ is not a
[1:11:19] light, but Christ is a light. Christ is
[1:11:25] a light.
[1:11:27] Amen. Well, I'll admit it. Y'all just
[1:11:29] sit there.
[1:11:31] That's not my words. That's the prophet.
[1:11:33] You say you believe. That's what the
[1:11:35] prophet is telling you tonight. People
[1:11:37] say, "Well, Christ is not a light." He
[1:11:39] said, "I feel that Christ is a light."
[1:11:42] His burden, his duty, his
[1:11:44] responsibility, his burden, his duty,
[1:11:46] his responsibility was to bear that
[1:11:48] light before the people. God laid that
[1:11:51] burden on him. Go and declare to Israel
[1:11:53] after 400 years without a prophet, I am
[1:11:56] alive and that I am here.
[1:12:01] God said, "Go tell him I'm
[1:12:03] here." Paul met that same light. Did he
[1:12:06] not meet it on the road to Damascus and
[1:12:08] a light struck him down? What did the
[1:12:10] light say? What did it say? I am Jesus
[1:12:15] whom thou persecutest.
[1:12:18] Yes, sir. A light, a voice spoke out of
[1:12:22] the light said, "Saul, Saul, why
[1:12:24] persecutest thou me? Who are you, Lord?
[1:12:27] I am Jesus. Whom thou
[1:12:32] persecutest?" Paul met that same light
[1:12:34] on the road to Damascus, and a light
[1:12:36] struck him down, and a voice spoke and
[1:12:37] said, "I'm Jesus. Go tell them, Paul. Go
[1:12:39] tell them I'm alive and that I'm here in
[1:12:42] my
[1:12:42] church." Paul said, "I've not failed to
[1:12:45] declare unto you the full counsel of
[1:12:47] God." Paul was yolked to that light and
[1:12:50] the burden was placed upon Paul to go
[1:12:52] and tell them I am
[1:12:55] alive and the word was made flesh and
[1:13:00] dwelt among
[1:13:03] us. Amen.
[1:13:07] And now the word is made flesh in his
[1:13:11] church
[1:13:12] dwelling among us. Amen. Oh, if I could
[1:13:16] only see Jesus, brother Daryl, he's
[1:13:18] sitting right beside you. Oh my.
[1:13:22] It's where he said he would be in this
[1:13:25] hour.
[1:13:27] A little while the world will see me no
[1:13:28] more, but you shall see me. Word of
[1:13:31] life, church. You shall see me. How? For
[1:13:34] I'll be with you, even in you.
[1:13:40] The word made flesh in his church,
[1:13:42] dwelling among us. His angel is in his
[1:13:44] hand. Ministers, God is depending upon
[1:13:47] his church. God is relying on us of this
[1:13:49] age to bring the gospel light to a dying
[1:13:53] heathenbound traditional world. God is
[1:13:57] laying the burden on me. God is laying
[1:13:59] the burden on you. And woe unto us if
[1:14:02] the heathen dies without knowing it.
[1:14:08] He has placed the
[1:14:10] burden to bear the light to a dying
[1:14:15] demon bound
[1:14:18] world. God is laying the burden on me.
[1:14:20] Woe unto us that the heathen dies
[1:14:22] without knowing it. Oh, they carry
[1:14:23] reading and writing in rivick and a few
[1:14:25] religious pamphlets and they've made no
[1:14:27] more than a bunch of
[1:14:29] proelites. I mean the gospel the gospel
[1:14:32] is not word only. Paul said so. Paul
[1:14:34] said, "The gospel didn't come to us
[1:14:35] through word only, but the word was made
[1:14:37] manifest." And when the word by the Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost, the word is planted into the
[1:14:41] heart that's got the Holy Ghost, it
[1:14:43] produces what the word said it would.
[1:14:48] Amen.
[1:14:50] And the word can discern the thoughts of
[1:14:53] the heart. That's why you can talk about
[1:14:56] something coming to church and the
[1:14:58] preacher can get up and say it word for
[1:15:00] word
[1:15:03] because God is in his
[1:15:09] people. The gospel out has been yolked
[1:15:12] again today. God placed the burden upon
[1:15:14] us. Go and declare he's alive and that
[1:15:19] he's here. You said, "Brother D, I'm
[1:15:21] just not a good speaker. I can't stand
[1:15:22] on the corner and pass out a track. I
[1:15:24] can't stand on a corner and testify. But
[1:15:26] you see, my brother, my sister, it's not
[1:15:27] so much what we say with our mouth. It's
[1:15:29] what we live with our lives.
[1:15:32] I'd rather somebody live me a sermon,
[1:15:34] then preach me one.
[1:15:40] Amen. The burden upon us to go and
[1:15:43] declare he's alive, that he's here. You
[1:15:44] can't declare that unless you've been
[1:15:47] yolked, harnessed, and the burden has
[1:15:50] been placed upon you.
[1:15:53] Bring the gospel light. The burden is
[1:15:55] upon us. Not to bring a creed, not to
[1:15:58] bring a quote, but the gospel with power
[1:16:01] and demonstration with the proof of
[1:16:03] life. The bride must declare that Jesus
[1:16:06] is alive today.
[1:16:09] Amen. Proof of life. He's alive. How?
[1:16:12] Not by passing out a track. How? By the
[1:16:16] life he lived. Is alive by doing what he
[1:16:19] did when he was here. And those that
[1:16:22] believe will vindicate that by doing the
[1:16:24] works that he did according to St. John
[1:16:27] 14:12.
[1:16:30] Mother walked in the light she had. But
[1:16:31] the day has come when the gospel light
[1:16:33] is shining. The theology of Christian
[1:16:36] churches is dying. It's failed.
[1:16:39] Denominations have failed. That's why
[1:16:42] the prophet said, "Come out of hermen,
[1:16:46] my people."
[1:16:50] God's taking you now. God has taken you
[1:16:53] now to reveal himself again through his
[1:16:56] church, the resurrected body of the Lord
[1:16:59] Jesus Christ. He's taken me. He's taken
[1:17:02] you to reveal himself
[1:17:08] again. Resurrected out of his churchity.
[1:17:11] Resurrected our co-formal churches.
[1:17:12] Resurrected out of fanaticism. God's
[1:17:14] bringing forth a bunch of bones and
[1:17:17] putting skin on it in the power of the
[1:17:19] Holy Ghost that'll bring the gospel in
[1:17:21] the last days with signs and wonders to
[1:17:23] the end of the world. They'll teach the
[1:17:26] Bible. They'll stand by it. They'll live
[1:17:28] by it. They'll not compromise right or
[1:17:30] left. That's right. They'll stand right
[1:17:31] on that word and move on. And God will
[1:17:34] be with them daily confirming the word
[1:17:36] with signs and wonders following. All
[1:17:38] you stars, all you morning stars, arise
[1:17:40] and shine. Thy light has come.
[1:17:43] Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] Proof of his life.
[1:17:49] Proof of his life. Amen.
[1:17:53] Our burden is light. Our responsibility,
[1:17:57] our duty, our burden is to bring that
[1:18:02] light. We are light bears.
[1:18:07] Then spake Jesus again saying, "I'm the
[1:18:09] light of the world. He that followeth me
[1:18:11] shall not walk in darkness, but shall
[1:18:14] have the light of life. As long as I'm
[1:18:16] in the world, I am the light of the
[1:18:19] world. And then he said in Matthew 5:14,
[1:18:22] "Ye are the light of the world." Amen.
[1:18:27] Jesus said, "I'm the light of the
[1:18:28] world." Then he said, "You're the light
[1:18:30] of the world." So who's the light of the
[1:18:31] world? Jesus or you? He said he was.
[1:18:35] Then he said you was.
[1:18:38] How could that be? Because now he's in
[1:18:41] you. Amen.
[1:18:45] Oh
[1:18:47] God, you're the light of the world. A
[1:18:50] city that's set on a hill that cannot be
[1:18:54] hid. Prophet said, "Almighty God, we
[1:18:57] thank thee tonight from the very depths
[1:18:58] of our heart for the love of Christ
[1:19:00] that's been shed abroad in our heart in
[1:19:01] these last days by the Holy Spirit. We
[1:19:03] thank thee because we have the privilege
[1:19:05] of assembling ourselves together and
[1:19:07] worshiping me thee and having this
[1:19:08] blessed assurance that someday you're
[1:19:10] coming for your church. We thank thee to
[1:19:13] be the lightbearers of this age. What is
[1:19:18] a lightbearer? It's someone who carries
[1:19:21] the light.
[1:19:24] We thank thee. We thank thee to be the
[1:19:26] lightbearers of this age.
[1:19:30] To be here ready to manifest the
[1:19:32] promised word for the age that we are
[1:19:34] now living in.
[1:19:38] Not Luther's day, not Wesley's day, not
[1:19:41] Pentecost with the restoration of the
[1:19:43] gifts, but our day, our hour, our
[1:19:46] message, our word, our light, the
[1:19:50] evening
[1:19:51] light to manifest the promised word for
[1:19:54] the age we're living in now. Knowing
[1:19:55] that beginning you allotted out of your
[1:19:56] word, knowing the end from the
[1:19:57] beginning. Each age you allotted your
[1:19:59] word to that age. Somehow we don't know
[1:20:01] how it ever happened but in each of
[1:20:03] those ages as we look back thy word and
[1:20:05] we see there there was an anointing that
[1:20:07] come on that age to fulfill that word
[1:20:11] then what comes upon us an anointing
[1:20:13] from God to do what? To fulfill the word
[1:20:15] for our hour
[1:20:18] and in the days that we're now living in
[1:20:19] there's aotted word promise for this
[1:20:21] age. We believe the Holy Spirit is here
[1:20:22] on the earth now trying to find
[1:20:25] hearts to manifest and to bring to pass
[1:20:30] by vindicating the word that's now
[1:20:32] prophesied for this day and this
[1:20:36] hour. Think of it. Think of this before
[1:20:39] we
[1:20:40] close. What was Jesus manifested for?
[1:20:47] To show God.
[1:20:49] Amen.
[1:20:52] Philip said, "Show us the father. It'll
[1:20:54] satisfy us." He said, "Have I been with
[1:20:57] you all this time?
[1:20:59] When you see me, you see the father."
[1:21:03] What was he manifested for? To show God.
[1:21:06] And the same word that speaks for the
[1:21:08] groom speaks also for the bride. Then
[1:21:10] what is this bride manifested for? To
[1:21:14] show God. Yes, sir. Thank you. Not an
[1:21:18] organization, not a denomination.
[1:21:22] Amen. Amen. But the word manifested in
[1:21:26] flesh. He sent back the life he lived by
[1:21:30] to the church. How? By the Holy Spirit.
[1:21:34] God purposed. We find here in sending
[1:21:36] the Holy Spirit was for one purpose. He
[1:21:39] sent the Holy Spirit for one purpose.
[1:21:42] that God himself might dwell in his
[1:21:45] church and continue his plans through
[1:21:48] the church. God was in Christ continuing
[1:21:51] to pass through Christ out of Christ
[1:21:53] into the church continuing his work
[1:21:57] through the church. He that was, he that
[1:22:01] is, and he that's to be in this day the
[1:22:05] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[1:22:08] was manifested for that purpose.
[1:22:16] And through that purpose, he would
[1:22:18] achieve the church that he, the fullness
[1:22:20] of God, might bring to pass every
[1:22:22] promised word of God in these last days
[1:22:25] when he can get the
[1:22:27] preeminence, the preeminence in the
[1:22:30] church. You see, God don't need my
[1:22:32] education. God don't need my ability. He
[1:22:34] just needs my skin. It's not how much I
[1:22:38] can know. Come on, somebody. It's how
[1:22:40] much we can yield. It's how much we can
[1:22:42] yield to that life.
[1:22:46] What did brother Brandham say the gift
[1:22:47] was? The gift was getting William
[1:22:49] Brandham out of the way. He said the
[1:22:50] greatest enemy I got is William
[1:22:52] Brandham. The gift is getting myself out
[1:22:54] of the way. It's relaxing and getting
[1:22:55] out of the way that he can speak.
[1:23:00] He wants the preeminence in you and the
[1:23:02] young people and mom and daddy, brother,
[1:23:03] sister. He wants that preeminence in our
[1:23:06] life. Amen. Why? That he can show
[1:23:09] himself
[1:23:12] alive. Amen. Is this all right?
[1:23:19] The position, the preeminence in his
[1:23:22] place in the church. Jesus said, "He
[1:23:24] that believeth on me, the works I do
[1:23:25] shall he also. Even more than this shall
[1:23:27] he do, for I go to my father." That was
[1:23:29] his purpose. There was the
[1:23:31] manifestation. And now today, he wants
[1:23:34] to get
[1:23:36] somebody that can so see it that they
[1:23:40] can let the word manifest
[1:23:43] through them.
[1:23:46] Amen.
[1:23:48] Somebody who can so see the message of
[1:23:50] the
[1:23:51] hour that they can manifest that message
[1:23:56] through them.
[1:24:00] Oh God, help me Lord Jesus.
[1:24:04] He wants to get somebody. I said, "God,
[1:24:07] let it be me." He wants to get somebody
[1:24:10] that can so see it that they can let the
[1:24:13] word manifest through them. Hallelujah.
[1:24:16] Jesus so seated, so perfectly born for
[1:24:19] the day until God expressed every move
[1:24:22] that he made. He was God's revelation.
[1:24:24] He was God revealed. Then this ransom
[1:24:28] church of the last day purposed by God
[1:24:30] to be here. What is she? Not a creed,
[1:24:33] not a dogma, not a cult. She's God's
[1:24:36] revelation. God revealed in flesh. Once
[1:24:40] again,
[1:24:42] not God above us, not God with us, but
[1:24:46] God in us.
[1:24:50] He took some dust, blew on it, stepped
[1:24:52] in it, spoke to Abraham, took a body,
[1:24:55] walked on the shores of Galilee. Now
[1:24:56] he's taking another body. The same God
[1:25:00] above us, with us, now in us. Christ,
[1:25:04] the mystery of God revealed. What did he
[1:25:06] tell us? All God was, he poured into
[1:25:09] Christ. And all Christ is, he has poured
[1:25:12] into his church. And Christ was the
[1:25:14] mystery of God revealed. But the bride
[1:25:16] is the revelation of where he is today.
[1:25:22] There would come a time that would come
[1:25:23] forth. He could express himself in the
[1:25:25] fullness of his God. and deity through
[1:25:27] his church to have the preeminence in
[1:25:29] this church. Oh my, the anointed man.
[1:25:31] Now the anointed man. Who was the
[1:25:34] anointed man? Jesus Christ. But who is
[1:25:37] the anointed people? His bride.
[1:25:42] Oh my. The anointed man. Now the
[1:25:44] anointed people. Oh my. To bring back
[1:25:46] the anointed bride and the bridegroom.
[1:25:49] Cuz you see, the prophet said, "If you
[1:25:50] want to see what a man really is, look
[1:25:52] at what he marries."
[1:25:54] Then what must Christ take as a union to
[1:25:56] himself? It must be someone just like
[1:26:00] him.
[1:26:02] That's right. Got the same genetics. Oh,
[1:26:06] God. That's why he's not ashamed. Go
[1:26:08] tell my brethren. Hallelujah. Amen. He's
[1:26:13] not ashamed to call us brethren.
[1:26:18] Oh, help us, Lord Jesus. Amen. Do you
[1:26:21] love him tonight? Amen. There would come
[1:26:22] a time come forth when he'd express
[1:26:24] himself in the fullness of his godhead
[1:26:25] deity through his church and have the
[1:26:27] premise in his church, the anointed man
[1:26:29] now, the anointed people on my to bring
[1:26:31] back the anointed bride and the
[1:26:33] bridegroom anointed. Why? By accepting
[1:26:35] what Eve turned down and Adam coming
[1:26:38] back with the anointing of the word
[1:26:40] because he said my word is spirit
[1:26:42] anointed with the word. What Eve turned
[1:26:44] down he comes back and we accept.
[1:26:49] Notice secondly, the manifested Christ
[1:26:51] in you, the hope of glory. That great
[1:26:53] manifested God in Christ. That great
[1:26:56] manifested God in Christ. And now Christ
[1:27:00] manifested in you. You said, "Bel,
[1:27:04] you're sure reading a lot because I want
[1:27:05] you to know these are not my words.
[1:27:09] I'm only rehearsing in your ears what
[1:27:11] the prophet has already told you." Yes.
[1:27:14] Amen.
[1:27:18] Look, what was once God's great
[1:27:21] secret, great mysterious secret that was
[1:27:24] in his mind, God had this great
[1:27:28] mysterious secret in his
[1:27:31] mind. But who could get into God's mind
[1:27:34] to get this secret? Moses could not even
[1:27:38] get into the mind of God. He could only
[1:27:40] go back to the beginning. That's how he
[1:27:42] wrote in the beginning that as far as he
[1:27:44] could go back and nobody had access to
[1:27:47] the mind of God. And God held this great
[1:27:50] mysterious secret in his mind. Even the
[1:27:52] angels who had never sinned yet they
[1:27:55] could not partake of this great secret
[1:27:59] that was in God's mind. For who had
[1:28:04] access to God's
[1:28:08] mind? What was once God's great secret
[1:28:12] that was in his mind before the
[1:28:14] foundation of the
[1:28:17] world is now made
[1:28:23] manifest.
[1:28:25] Where where
[1:28:26] where is this great? It was once in
[1:28:30] God's mind but it's not there
[1:28:33] now. Where is it at? Where is this great
[1:28:37] mysterious secret that was once in God's
[1:28:41] mind before the foundation of the world?
[1:28:44] Here's what the prophet said. Look, what
[1:28:46] was once God's great secret, great
[1:28:48] mysterious secret that was in his mind
[1:28:50] is now put in the hearts of the
[1:28:53] believers.
[1:28:55] Where is this great secret? Where is
[1:28:57] this great? It's in your heart.
[1:29:02] It was once in God's mind, but it's now
[1:29:05] been placed in the heart of the
[1:29:06] believers. That his body of Christ, what
[1:29:08] was once God's great secret in his mind
[1:29:10] before the foundation of the world is
[1:29:13] now made manifest where? In you. Think
[1:29:18] of it. Because God promised it and he
[1:29:20] keeps his promises. He cannot fail. His
[1:29:22] promises are always true. Yeah. Paul
[1:29:25] says, "Anybody ever seen that picture of
[1:29:27] light, the angel of the Lord, the pillar
[1:29:29] of fire? They've got it. Science has it.
[1:29:31] Washington has it. Yeah. Right. And I
[1:29:35] know the doubters and the liars, you
[1:29:36] know, that try to condemn this message
[1:29:38] say it's not there. But I want them to
[1:29:39] know they're a liar. It is there. Me and
[1:29:41] my wife went to the Library of Congress.
[1:29:43] Me and Sher and Jessica went there a few
[1:29:44] year ago. We went up there on the second
[1:29:46] floor up there to the the Library of
[1:29:48] Congress. We walked in. They looked at
[1:29:50] Sher. They told us exactly where it was
[1:29:54] at. We pulled it out. We took pictures
[1:29:56] of it. It's there. It's there. It's
[1:29:59] there. You ever seen that picture of
[1:30:00] light, the angel of the Lord, the pillar
[1:30:02] of fire? They've got it. Science has it.
[1:30:04] Washington has it. Now the church has
[1:30:07] got it in
[1:30:09] reality. They've got it in a picture,
[1:30:12] but you've got it in reality. You've got
[1:30:14] it in reality. That same pillar of fire
[1:30:17] that led the children of old is leading
[1:30:19] us in this Exodus. Hallelujah.
[1:30:24] You've got it in reality. It's here with
[1:30:26] us. It's leading us just as it led
[1:30:29] Israel. It's still leading the church.
[1:30:31] There's not a wind strong enough that
[1:30:33] will stop this bride
[1:30:36] that will stop you. There's not a
[1:30:38] sickness. There's not a trial that'll
[1:30:40] keep us from achieving God's great
[1:30:42] purpose for our lives. There's something
[1:30:45] burning in us, a fire, a light that's
[1:30:47] burning, a light that's been lit by God.
[1:30:50] A breeze can't blow it out. There's no
[1:30:52] cold spell in the church can blow it
[1:30:54] out. There's no indifference among the
[1:30:56] people. No persecution of the world that
[1:30:58] can blow this flame of God out. For God
[1:31:01] purposed that this torch light of
[1:31:02] freedom will burn until the coming of
[1:31:04] the Lord. And no power, nobody on the
[1:31:07] internet, nobody that can write a book,
[1:31:09] nobody will stop this message.
[1:31:15] All they do will damn their souls down.
[1:31:21] If you don't believe it, you better keep
[1:31:23] your mouth shut because you will
[1:31:25] condemn. Out of your own mouth, you will
[1:31:26] be justified. Out of your own mouth, you
[1:31:28] will be condemned. That's thus sayith
[1:31:29] the spirit of God. Hallelujah.
[1:31:35] We're not playing church anymore,
[1:31:36] friends. It's here. This is who we are.
[1:31:38] This is what the purpose of the message
[1:31:40] was to come. Was to bring a body on the
[1:31:41] earth who had God had the preeminence in
[1:31:43] that he could express himself through.
[1:31:45] And no persecution of the world can blow
[1:31:48] that flame out.
[1:31:51] It'll burn to the coming of the Lord. No
[1:31:53] powers. It will only make it burn
[1:31:56] brighter. Oh, I've been touched by a
[1:31:59] fire. Let the world come and watch me
[1:32:01] burn.
[1:32:05] Hallelujah.
[1:32:08] Anybody ever been on fire?
[1:32:11] I
[1:32:11] have. I was burning some leaves one
[1:32:14] time. Had a little pair of raggedy jeans
[1:32:15] on. I was out there burning them leaves
[1:32:17] and I sitting on that hole, you know,
[1:32:18] watching it burn just thinking about
[1:32:20] things and kicking leaves up in there.
[1:32:23] All of a sudden, I thought, man, my legs
[1:32:25] awful
[1:32:26] warm. And I looked down, fire was coming
[1:32:28] up my leg. I threw that hole. I screamed
[1:32:30] like a woman. I said, you crickets I'm
[1:32:34] on. I was one second away from ripping
[1:32:36] my britches off. Why? I was on fire.
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:41] Don't tell me we're on fire.
[1:32:43] Can you imagine? Come on.
[1:32:46] If you you expect somebody to do that
[1:32:48] when you expect somebody to throw a hole
[1:32:50] and scream like a woman when they're on
[1:32:52] fire.
[1:32:54] What if I said oh
[1:32:58] my Well, look. I'm on
[1:33:02] fire. My goodness. It's already to my
[1:33:06] knee. You'd say he's
[1:33:09] crazy. I'm on fire. Oh, saints of God.
[1:33:12] We're on fire. Listen to me. We are not
[1:33:14] muted. We have a voice. I say it's time
[1:33:17] to bring this light to a dying world and
[1:33:19] let them know who we are. We are the
[1:33:21] bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. And he has
[1:33:24] manifested himself through us with signs
[1:33:26] and wonders. Blinded eyes come open. The
[1:33:28] lame walk. The dead are raised. That's
[1:33:30] what God said he would do.
[1:33:34] We're now living. God has come on the
[1:33:36] scene to vindicate and prove his
[1:33:37] promises. It's the light of the hour so
[1:33:39] we can rise and shine. The light shines
[1:33:42] upon us again today. The word is being
[1:33:44] made manifest. It's the light. That's
[1:33:47] what that's what. Then what was he? What
[1:33:50] was he? He was God's light. He was God's
[1:33:55] light. He said, "I am the light of the
[1:33:59] world." And then he said, "You're the
[1:34:00] light of the world." So if he was the
[1:34:02] light of the world and he was God's
[1:34:03] light and you're the light of the world,
[1:34:05] then who are you? You are God's light.
[1:34:09] That's right. Amen. Bearers of the
[1:34:13] light. My burden, my duty, my
[1:34:16] responsibility is not to make a creed,
[1:34:18] not to make a dogma, not to make an
[1:34:19] organization, not to make a kingdom for
[1:34:21] myself, but my duty, my responsibility
[1:34:24] is to bear this light.
[1:34:28] That's true. Not only did he say I'm the
[1:34:31] light of the world, but he said you're
[1:34:32] the light of the world. If his word is
[1:34:34] in you bearing record of itself, then
[1:34:36] you're the light of the world. We find
[1:34:37] the light of each age made manifested
[1:34:39] just the same. Jesus was the light of
[1:34:41] his hour because he was the promised
[1:34:43] word of the hour. And the word of God
[1:34:45] made manifest is always the light of the
[1:34:49] hour. Listen to me as we close. The
[1:34:52] evening light here come the evening
[1:34:54] light. The evening light is not a sign.
[1:34:57] It's not just a church sign. It's not
[1:34:59] just the name of a church that's in the
[1:35:00] message. Evening light tabernacle.
[1:35:02] Evening light church. Send the light.
[1:35:04] It's more than that. The evening light
[1:35:06] is not a name on the church. It's not
[1:35:09] even a song. The evening light is you.
[1:35:14] Amen.
[1:35:16] In the evening time, it shall be light.
[1:35:23] Oh,
[1:35:24] lightbears. Lightbears, rise to your
[1:35:27] God-given purpose. Hallelujah. Yield
[1:35:30] your will to his
[1:35:33] purpose, not my will, Lord. Let thy will
[1:35:36] be done. Isaiah said, "Arise and shine,
[1:35:39] for thy light has come, and the glory of
[1:35:41] the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold,
[1:35:43] darkness shall cover the earth, and
[1:35:45] gross darkness, but the people, but the
[1:35:47] Lord shall arise upon thee, and his
[1:35:50] glory shall be seen upon thee, and the
[1:35:53] Gentiles shall come to thy light." Amen.
[1:35:57] and the kings to the brightness of the
[1:36:02] horizon. Oh
[1:36:08] God, it's my desire. Brother
[1:36:15] Harry, I want my wife. I want my
[1:36:18] children. I want my grandchildren. I
[1:36:19] want my friends
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:22] to see
[1:36:24] Jesus. to see that
[1:36:26] light. That's what I want to
[1:36:29] see. God, help me to yield to that.
[1:36:32] Amen. God, help us to yield to that.
[1:36:37] That's a
[1:36:39] story just come to my
[1:36:41] mind. Oh
[1:36:43] my. Hey, some
[1:36:45] men. They lived in New Jersey. They
[1:36:48] worked in New York. And every Friday
[1:36:51] they would catch a puddle jumper flight
[1:36:52] from New York over to to New from New
[1:36:55] York over to New Jersey and eat supper
[1:36:57] with their wives. They was businessmen.
[1:36:59] They worked in New York City through the
[1:37:01] week and then on the weekend they would
[1:37:02] fly back on Friday and eat supper with
[1:37:04] their wives. And so business last a
[1:37:06] little bit longer. When they got to the
[1:37:07] airport, they were running late. And
[1:37:09] when you're running late at the airport,
[1:37:11] there's only one way to get to the gate.
[1:37:13] That's run. I've done it a time.
[1:37:19] And they come around the corner and they
[1:37:22] saw this girl, but it was too
[1:37:24] late. They knocked her
[1:37:26] down. Knocked her apple cart over.
[1:37:28] Knocked her apples everywhere. But they
[1:37:30] kept running. But when they got down to
[1:37:32] the gate, one of them got to feeling
[1:37:34] bad, Brother Larry. And told his
[1:37:36] buddies, he said, "You all go on. I'm
[1:37:37] going to go back and check on her." They
[1:37:39] said, "You better come on. Your wife's
[1:37:41] expecting you." Said, "Tell my wife what
[1:37:42] happened. She'll understand. Tell her
[1:37:44] I'll catch the later flight. I'll see
[1:37:45] her after a while." And he goes back and
[1:37:48] when he goes back to where the little
[1:37:49] girl is, she's in the floor and she's
[1:37:51] crying. He's saying,
[1:37:53] "Jesus, would you help me? Jesus, please
[1:37:56] help me." Anybody been in New York City?
[1:37:59] Too friendly. People walked right by her
[1:38:01] and never paid no attention to her. And
[1:38:03] he said, "I'll help you." And he set up
[1:38:05] the chair. He set her up. He gave her
[1:38:08] handkerchief. Here, wipe your tears.
[1:38:09] I'll I'll take care of. He set up the
[1:38:10] apple cart. He picked up all the apples
[1:38:12] that was bruised. He set them off to a
[1:38:13] side so she wouldn't sell a bruised
[1:38:15] apple. He took his right and cleaned out
[1:38:17] all the apples. He cleaned them up. He
[1:38:18] stacked them all
[1:38:20] up. He reached in his pocket. He pulled
[1:38:22] out $20. He said, "Now here, this is
[1:38:25] enough to cover every apple that was
[1:38:27] bruised, and we're so sorry that we've
[1:38:28] done this. We didn't mean to. We was
[1:38:30] running late. We didn't see you, and I'm
[1:38:32] sorry." He said, "Now, you're back in
[1:38:34] business." He said, "I've got to go see
[1:38:35] about my flight." And as he turned to
[1:38:37] leave, this little girl spoke for the
[1:38:39] first
[1:38:40] time. He realized she was blind.
[1:38:45] And he she spoke for the first time and
[1:38:47] she said,
[1:38:51] "Mister, are you Jesus?"
[1:38:56] He said, "No." Wh Why would you say
[1:38:58] that? She said, "Well, I was just asking
[1:39:01] Jesus to help me and I heard you say,
[1:39:03] "I'll help you." And I thought maybe he
[1:39:06] was him.
[1:39:08] He said,
[1:39:10] "No, no, I follow him.
[1:39:14] And all the way that night looking out
[1:39:16] the window of an airplane, he thought
[1:39:18] about those words, "Mister, are you
[1:39:23] Jesus?" And I wonder,
[1:39:26] friends, if my neighbor was
[1:39:30] blind, they couldn't see the eagle
[1:39:33] that's on our house. They couldn't see
[1:39:35] the Malachi 4 license plate that's on
[1:39:37] our car. They couldn't see our wives
[1:39:40] with their dresses and their long hair.
[1:39:44] Do we live such a
[1:39:47] life that if our neighbor was
[1:39:50] blind, they could still see Jesus?
[1:39:54] Amen.
[1:39:55] What does it
[1:39:57] take a surrendered life?
[1:40:01] someone if he could just find someone,
[1:40:04] he said, who would so yield herself that
[1:40:08] he could
[1:40:10] manifest himself through. And I say
[1:40:13] tonight, I don't know about you friends,
[1:40:15] but when I was looking at this, studying
[1:40:17] this, I said, "Oh
[1:40:20] God, let it be
[1:40:23] me. Let it be
[1:40:25] me that someone, Brother Jack, can see
[1:40:28] Jesus in me.
[1:40:31] Is that your desire tonight? Amen. My
[1:40:34] duty, my responsibility, we was born for
[1:40:37] a purpose
[1:40:39] and that's to be a lightbearer to this
[1:40:42] dying generation. Amen. And all he needs
[1:40:46] us to do is to yield ourselves to him.
[1:40:49] Are we willing to do that tonight as we
[1:40:52] bow our heads?
[1:40:55] Oh
[1:40:57] God, thank you Lord
[1:41:02] Jesus. Lord, I seek
[1:41:05] you. Help me find
[1:41:09] you. How I need your
[1:41:15] touch. Find my dry and broken places.
[1:41:22] Thirsty for your
[1:41:27] love. Lord, forgive
[1:41:30] me if I've
[1:41:33] wondered far away from
[1:41:38] you. You are all I've ever
[1:41:44] needed. Come and make me
[1:41:47] new. Pour your spirit out on me.
[1:41:52] Fall just like the
[1:41:55] rain.
[1:41:57] Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall
[1:42:01] aresh on
[1:42:03] me. Fill my cup
[1:42:07] again. Heal my heart and make me whole.
[1:42:15] I need you now. Pour your spirit
[1:42:26] out.
[1:42:29] Hallelujah. Lord, I seek
[1:42:32] you. Help me find
[1:42:36] you. How I need your touch.
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:44] Find my dry
[1:42:47] and broken
[1:42:51] places thirsty for your
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:42:58] love. Lord, forgive
[1:43:01] me if I've
[1:43:05] wondered far away from you.
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:13] You are all
[1:43:16] I ever
[1:43:20] need. Come and make
[1:43:24] me. Pour your spirit out on
[1:43:29] me. Fall just like the
[1:43:34] rain.
[1:43:36] Saturate my thirsty soul.
[1:43:40] Come and fall aresh on
[1:43:44] me. Fill my cup
[1:43:49] again. Heal my heart and make me
[1:43:56] whole. I need you
[1:44:00] now for your spirit.
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:09] Oh
[1:44:09] friends, is that your desire tonight
[1:44:12] more than just a song? Even though it's
[1:44:14] such a beautiful song, but does the word
[1:44:18] speak to your heart tonight to say,
[1:44:20] "Lord, I want to take this yoke. I want
[1:44:23] to my burden, my
[1:44:25] responsibility. Lord, I've drifted. I've
[1:44:27] got caught up in this or that, but oh
[1:44:29] God, I want to turn back
[1:44:31] tonight. I want to put that yoke back on
[1:44:34] me. I want to be yolked to you, yolked
[1:44:36] to your word, yolked to your spirit,
[1:44:38] yoke to your life, that I may be a light
[1:44:43] bearer, that my friends and my neighbors
[1:44:45] and my family and my
[1:44:47] co-workers could see
[1:44:49] Jesus. You see, you may never take a a a
[1:44:53] Bible and preach a sermon, but you could
[1:44:54] live your sermon every day of your life.
[1:44:59] And if this song is more than just a
[1:45:01] song to you, but it's actually a prayer,
[1:45:03] I wonder tonight if you would just slip
[1:45:05] up to your feet and slip up your hand
[1:45:06] and say, "Lord, that's me tonight.
[1:45:08] God, pour your spirit out on me.
[1:45:11] Lord, I need you,
[1:45:14] Lord. I want to be that bearer of light.
[1:45:16] I want that re light to be manifested
[1:45:18] through me. I want to yield to what your
[1:45:20] word says I'm to be in this hour.
[1:45:24] I don't care what the world thinks. I
[1:45:26] don't care what the internet says. I see
[1:45:29] the word being manifested.
[1:45:31] Amen.
[1:45:33] Oh Lord, I was thinking that Isaiah
[1:45:35] spoke a virgin shall conceive in 800
[1:45:38] years before that prophecy was
[1:45:39] fulfilled. And a prophet of God stood in
[1:45:42] our generation in 1954 and said, "There
[1:45:44] will come a pope out of the United
[1:45:46] States." And nine months later, the man
[1:45:48] was
[1:45:49] born. Oh God, we're living in the very
[1:45:51] hour that the words of the prophets.
[1:45:54] God, we're not just reading the quotes.
[1:45:56] We're living them. Lord, this is who we
[1:45:59] are. This is the hour. Oh God, as these
[1:46:01] things that you said it would take
[1:46:03] place, the car and the things you spoke
[1:46:05] through your prophet, the world council
[1:46:06] of churches and the mark of the beast,
[1:46:08] all these things that are coming to
[1:46:09] pass, Lord Jesus, earthquakes and
[1:46:11] diverse places, pestilence, famines,
[1:46:13] wars, rumors of wars, threats of nuclear
[1:46:15] holocaust, all these
[1:46:18] things, oh sea,
[1:46:21] raging, signs of the end
[1:46:23] time. But you said when these things
[1:46:26] begin to come to pass, then lift up your
[1:46:28] head, oh God. And we know that you'll
[1:46:31] catch this bride away when we reproduce
[1:46:33] you again on the earth. So Lord, we
[1:46:34] stand here tonight with our hearts to
[1:46:36] you,
[1:46:37] Lord. We say,
[1:46:39] "Father, I yield myself to you, Lord. I
[1:46:42] give myself away. I surrender to you
[1:46:45] tonight." Is that your prayer? Then in
[1:46:47] your own way, would you just say it in
[1:46:48] your own prayer to your own way to your
[1:46:50] Lord tonight to say, "Lord Jesus, I
[1:46:53] desire this tonight, Lord, more than
[1:46:54] anything in my life, dear God, I want to
[1:46:57] be a yielded vessel. I want to be
[1:46:59] surrendered to the purpose for being
[1:47:00] upon the earth. I want to be yolked to
[1:47:02] the gospel that I may bring forth that
[1:47:04] light. Lord Jesus, I give myself to you
[1:47:07] tonight. I surrender myself to you,
[1:47:09] Lord. Forgive me of my sins. Forgive me
[1:47:11] of my shortcomings. Forgive me of my
[1:47:12] weaknesses. Lord God, mold me into that
[1:47:15] image that you're pleased to dwell in
[1:47:16] that you can reflect yourself through.
[1:47:18] Hear our cry tonight, Lord. Hear our
[1:47:20] prayer tonight. We pray. God, may signs
[1:47:23] and wonders be wrought at our hands. Our
[1:47:24] sick will be healed. Our lost will be
[1:47:26] found. the weak will be made strong.
[1:47:28] Grant it tonight, oh God, as you
[1:47:29] promised in these last days, you would
[1:47:31] pour out your spirit, Lord
[1:47:33] Jesus. Grant it today, Lord. I lift my
[1:47:36] heart. I lift my hands to you. And I
[1:47:39] say, oh God, let me be that surrendered
[1:47:41] vessel. Let me be that surrendered life,
[1:47:44] Lord, that others may see
[1:47:47] Jesus. Grant it tonight, Lord, we
[1:47:50] pray. Grant it tonight, Lord, we pray in
[1:47:54] Jesus name.
[1:47:56] Amen.
[1:47:58] And
[1:47:59] amen. Hallelujah.
[1:48:03] Lord, I seek
[1:48:06] you. Help me find
[1:48:09] you. How I need your touch.
[1:48:18] Find my dry
[1:48:21] and broken
[1:48:24] places thirsty for your
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:31] love. Lord, forgive
[1:48:35] me if I've
[1:48:39] wandered far away from you.
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:47] You are all
[1:48:50] I ever
[1:48:53] needed. Come and make me
[1:48:57] [Music]

[2:01:13] away. I give myself
[2:01:16] away so
[2:01:18] you can
[2:01:24] [Applause]
[2:01:35] I give myself
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:42] away. I give myself
[2:01:45] away so
[2:01:47] you can
[2:01:49] use. I give myself
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:01:57] away. I give myself
[2:02:01] away so
[2:02:03] you can use me.
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:14] There's a voice
[2:02:17] calling
[2:02:20] me from an
[2:02:23] old rugged
[2:02:27] tree. And it
[2:02:30] whispers draw
[2:02:33] closer to me.
[2:02:39] Leave this world
[2:02:42] far
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:44] behind. There are new heights to climb.
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:57] You will
[2:02:58] [Music]
[2:03:03] find
[2:03:06] whatever it
[2:03:08] takes to
[2:03:12] draw to you.
[2:03:16] That's
[2:03:17] what I'll be
[2:03:21] willing to
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:26] do. And
[2:03:30] whatever it
[2:03:33] takes to be
[2:03:36] more like you.
[2:03:41] That's
[2:03:42] what I'll be
[2:03:45] willing to
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:51] do. Take the
[2:03:54] new things. God bless you
[2:03:57] saints. May the Lord bless you richly.
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:08] be
[2:04:10] closer to
[2:04:16] thee. Let
[2:04:19] the appointments
[2:04:22] come only
[2:04:25] days without the
[2:04:28] sun through sorrow.
[2:04:33] like you
[2:04:35] I
[2:04:40] become for
[2:04:44] whatever it
[2:04:46] takes to draw
[2:04:50] closer to
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:53] you. That's
[2:04:55] what I'll be
[2:04:59] willing to do.
[2:05:01] [Music]
[2:05:06] And
[2:05:08] whatever it
[2:05:11] takes for my
[2:05:14] will to
[2:05:18] break. That's
[2:05:20] what I'll be
[2:05:23] willing to do.
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:30] and
[2:05:33] whatever it
[2:05:36] takes to be
[2:05:39] more like
[2:05:42] you. Oh, that's
[2:05:44] what I'll
[2:05:48] be
[2:05:53] to. Amen. Did we enjoy the word of the
[2:05:56] Lord this evening?
[2:06:02] Amen. Let's sing a song as we go. Hoping
[2:06:04] the day star will shine upon us
[2:06:06] throughout the rest of the week and have
[2:06:08] service on Sunday morning. Amen. Liy of
[2:06:12] the
[2:06:14] valley, let your
[2:06:17] sweet fill my
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:26] life. Those who share show
[2:06:31] me how to grow in beauty in God
[2:06:37] [Music]
[2:06:39] [Applause]
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:43] sight of
[2:06:46] 10,000 make a
[2:06:50] reflection of your
[2:06:57] Heat. Heat.
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:15] Heat. Heat.
[2:07:21] [Music]
[2:07:29] Oh, let your words speak to
[2:07:33] me. Show me what I've never
[2:07:37] seen
[2:07:39] [Music]
[2:07:44] before. Lord, I want to be your
[2:07:48] witness. You can take what's wrong and
[2:07:52] make it right.
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:08:01] Shine on
[2:08:03] me. Let your love shine on me in the
[2:08:08] light.
[2:08:16] I see a world that's
[2:08:19] dying, wounded by the master of the
[2:08:30] sea. Roing in the
[2:08:34] darkness, haunted by the years of
[2:08:38] past defeat.
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:46] And I see standing near me, Lord,
[2:08:50] shining with compassion in your
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:08:58] eyes.
[2:09:01] Oh, star shine on
[2:09:04] me. Let your love shine through me in
[2:09:09] the night.
[2:09:13] [Applause]
[2:09:17] Give me I'll
[2:09:20] follow anywhere you open the
[2:09:31] door. Let your words speak to
[2:09:35] me. Show me what I've never seen.
[2:09:45] me. Lord, I want to be your
[2:09:50] witness. You can take what's wrong and
[2:09:54] make it
[2:09:59] right. Oh, I pray all shine on me.
[2:10:06] Let your love shine through me in the
[2:10:15] night.
[2:10:17] Oh, leave me Lord, I'll
[2:10:21] follow. Anywhere you open, I'm the door.
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:50] Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey.
[2:10:52] [Music]
