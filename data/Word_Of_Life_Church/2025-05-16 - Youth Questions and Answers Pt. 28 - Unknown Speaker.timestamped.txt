[7:23] Good evening. We're just gonna start
[7:26] with a song or two here and and try to
[7:29] make the Lord welcome
[7:31] here. Don't know what Brother Donnie has

[7:36] can speak to every one of
[7:37] [Music]
[7:40] us. It's me. It's me. It's me, oh Lord.

[8:44] it's me, oh Lord, standing in the need

[9:08] [Music]
[9:10] This time we're going to ask
[9:13] um ask brother Ryan to come pray over
[9:15] the prayer requests. We've got uh one
[9:17] request. It says a sister in Scotland
[9:19] that's in the hospital needs our
[9:20] prayers. There's anybody else that would
[9:22] have a a need but raise your hand.
[9:26] There's a lot of unspoken
[9:28] requests. Just just go to him right
[9:34] now. Let's pray. Dear heavenly father,
[9:37] we just come before you. Father, we
[9:39] thank you for being with us this week,
[9:41] Father, and just giving us a place to
[9:43] come to tonight, Father, together.
[9:45] Father, we just pray for the blessing of
[9:47] your word. Father, be with Brother
[9:49] Donnie as he speaks to us, Father, and
[9:51] bless all my brothers and sisters here,
[9:53] Father. I pray for our sister in
[9:55] Scotland, Father, you see your need,
[9:56] Father. Pray you be with her, Father.
[9:58] Pray that you touch everyone, Father.
[10:00] Please meet their needs, Father. We just
[10:01] praise you. We just want to create an
[10:04] atmosphere for you just to feel feel
[10:06] welcome, Father. That you feel
[10:08] comfortable, Father. You want us just
[10:11] come and and and speak to us and just
[10:13] have your way, Father. Help us all to
[10:15] just surrender what's on our hearts.
[10:17] Surrender what's on our minds, Father,
[10:19] and just be able to enter in and and
[10:21] really focus on what you have to to tell
[10:24] us this evening. Father, we just love
[10:26] you with all our hearts, Lord, in Jesus
[10:28] name. Amen.
[10:33] Amen. Let's see. Oh, he's got it all in
[10:43] control. Oh, he's got it
[10:47] all in control.
[10:52] Oh, he's put that
[10:57] reassurance way down in my
[11:04] soul. He's got it all in
[11:10] [Music]
[11:14] control. I put my
[11:17] life in his hands.
[11:20] [Music]
[11:24] I put my
[11:26] life in his
[11:29] [Music]
[11:31] hands. So every road I walk
[11:35] down, I'm sure is in his plans.
[11:42] [Music]
[11:44] I put my life in his
[11:49] hands. Give it all to him. Oh, he's got
[11:54] it all in
[11:58] [Music]
[12:00] control. He's got it
[12:04] all in control.
[12:07] [Music]
[12:08] Oh, he's put that
[12:13] reassurance way down in my soul.
[12:20] Oh, he's got it all in
[12:26] control. I put my life in his
[12:29] hands. I put my life in his hands.
[12:38] Oh, I put my
[12:42] life in his
[12:44] [Music]
[12:46] hands. So every road I walk
[12:51] down, I'm sure is in his
[12:55] [Music]
[12:58] plan. I put my life in his hands. One
[13:04] more time.
[13:07] Oh, he's got it all in
[13:13] [Music]
[13:16] control. He's got it
[13:19] all in
[13:22] [Laughter]
[13:24] control. He's put that
[13:27] [Music]
[13:29] reassurance way down in my soul.
[13:35] [Music]
[13:36] Oh, he's got it all in
[13:43] [Music]
[13:44] control. Amen. regardless of what you've
[13:47] gone through today, I pray that like
[13:50] like we said earlier that we could just
[13:51] set aside our burdens and
[13:53] just surrender to whatever his will is
[13:56] for for this
[13:59] [Music]
[14:01] evening. At night, I lay in
[14:06] bed and I
[14:09] begin to cry.
[14:13] [Music]
[14:16] And my mind just fails to
[14:22] know
[14:24] exactly why.
[14:26] [Music]
[14:30] Oh, I can't
[14:33] explain with tongue or
[14:36] pen the spirit
[14:40] groing deep
[14:44] within. It must be
[14:47] God here in my
[14:51] soul cuz I feel the pull.
[14:56] [Music]
[14:59] I
[15:00] feel the
[15:05] pull. I hear the
[15:13] call. Oh, and I know his
[15:17] spirit's
[15:19] moving
[15:21] me to give my
[15:25] all. Give him your all time.
[15:29] He speaks to
[15:36] me and
[15:42] [Music]
[15:44] I Lord please come and
[15:49] take control.
[15:52] I feel the
[15:55] [Music]
[16:00] voice. I win to hear the
[16:04] word and with each
[16:08] line and phrase.
[16:12] [Music]
[16:14] Oh, he was
[16:18] drawing
[16:20] me to
[16:21] give a
[16:24] higher praise.
[16:28] [Music]
[16:30] Oh, there's a
[16:33] deep call to the
[16:37] deep like a great
[16:41] magnet
[16:43] pulling
[16:45] me. I know for
[16:49] sure I'll reach the
[16:52] goal. Cuz I feel
[16:58] [Music]
[17:00] the I
[17:02] feel
[17:04] [Music]
[17:07] the I hear the call.
[17:13] [Music]
[17:16] Oh, and I know his
[17:20] spirit's
[17:22] moving
[17:24] me to
[17:26] give my
[17:31] all. He speaks to
[17:36] [Music]
[17:39] me and
[17:41] I agree.
[17:45] [Music]
[17:48] Oh Lord, please come and
[17:53] take
[17:55] control. I feel the
[17:59] pull. Sing it one more time from your
[18:01] heart before the dawning
[18:03] comes. I feel the pull.
[18:09] [Music]
[18:12] I hear the
[18:18] call. Oh, and I know his
[18:23] spirit's
[18:25] moving
[18:27] me to give my
[18:34] all. He
[18:36] speaks to me.
[18:43] And
[18:49] I Oh Lord, please come and
[18:56] take
[18:58] control. I feel the pull.
[19:08] [Music]
[19:17] Thank you, Lord
[19:20] Jesus. How blessed we
[19:22] are to feel a pull for
[19:25] God that's beyond
[19:29] oursel. It's
[19:31] beyond what many people in the age that
[19:34] we live in feel. They feel so so
[19:37] satisfied just going to church once
[19:40] every now and then and being a member of
[19:43] some sort of church and they do good
[19:47] deeds and good traits that they have
[19:50] about their life and they feel so good
[19:53] about themsel. Aren't you glad you've
[19:56] got something in you that hungers for
[19:58] more than that? We're blessed. Jesus
[20:01] said, "Blessed are they that hunger and
[20:03] thirst after righteousness, for they
[20:06] shall be filled." Such an honor for us
[20:09] to be together tonight. Um we'll um pick
[20:14] up on this one question that we've been
[20:15] on for a good while. I've told you last
[20:18] time that we met, we're calling it
[20:20] questions and answers, but for the last
[20:22] little bit, it's been question and many
[20:24] answers about the same question. But
[20:27] it's been a really good question. Can
[20:29] you explain why brother Brandham is a
[20:31] vindicated prophet and why the message
[20:34] is correct? I have a difficult time
[20:37] speaking to why I believe what I
[20:41] believe. Let's just bow our heads
[20:43] together and
[20:44] pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you once
[20:47] again that we could gather together in
[20:49] this place that you've given us, Lord.
[20:52] It's a meeting place between you and
[20:55] your children. We're so honored, Father,
[20:58] that once again you would be with us in
[21:00] this building that you have allowed us
[21:04] to have and that we consecrated to you.
[21:07] Now, we're praying that you would just
[21:09] come and help us. We need your spirit,
[21:12] your presence. Father, you see that I've
[21:15] studied and I've I've tried to look at
[21:18] every aspect of the word prophet and
[21:20] prophesy and prophecy and prophesied and
[21:24] prophet singular, plural, every form
[21:27] that I could be able to find it from the
[21:29] word to be able to bring to these young
[21:32] people that are here and all those
[21:33] that'll stream it, Lord, so we can have
[21:36] a substantial foundation for what we
[21:40] believe. We know that we're unusual and
[21:43] more peculiar as far as the world would
[21:45] look at us. But we know, Father, that
[21:48] you always do things according to your
[21:50] word. So speak to us tonight once again.
[21:54] Help me that I can be sensitive to the
[21:56] spirit of God to follow, Lord, your
[21:58] leading. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[22:02] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[22:04] Thank you for coming again tonight.
[22:08] I'd like to uh start out in in the book
[22:11] of Matthew chapter
[22:13] 23:34. Probably most Christians today in
[22:17] Christendom wouldn't have a problem and
[22:19] being able to see that God used prophets
[22:22] in the Old Testament. But where a lot of
[22:25] them have an issue is that whenever you
[22:28] would come to the New Testament and they
[22:31] would say, "Well, the law and the
[22:33] prophets were until John and after that
[22:35] time every man presseth his way into the
[22:37] kingdom of God." As if though that God
[22:40] has no more prophets in the New
[22:43] Testament. I mentioned it to you before,
[22:44] but just to reiterate it to you again
[22:47] that saying the law and the prophets was
[22:49] a common terminology and a common
[22:52] vernacular that was used in the New
[22:54] Testament referring to the Torah which
[22:57] is the first five books of Moses and
[22:59] then from the prophets on. The Sadducees
[23:02] only took the first five books of Moses.
[23:04] The Pharisees believe the first five
[23:06] books of Moses and then also the rest of
[23:08] the prophets. Now can you imagine how
[23:11] much that the Sadducees missed that
[23:14] mean? They did not believe Jeremiah,
[23:16] Ezekiel, Zephani, Hagi, Malachi,
[23:20] Zachchariah, Obadiah, Amos, Hosea, on
[23:24] and on and on that they did not take. So
[23:27] all they took was the first five books
[23:29] of Moses. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
[23:31] Numbers, Deuteronomy, of course, and
[23:33] that's all that they would take. So the
[23:35] book of Judges, Ruth, all the rest of
[23:37] it, they didn't want a thing to do with
[23:38] it. So how much of the Old Testament
[23:41] they totally missed because that was
[23:45] their mindset. Now let's bring it over
[23:47] to the New Testament then of most modern
[23:50] Christians today. Then what will they
[23:52] take? Well, they say they take the New
[23:54] Testament. A lot of them don't even take
[23:55] the Old Testament. But a lot of them
[23:57] will fight over the Ten Commandments.
[23:59] And then I say, "And where did them ten
[24:02] commandments come from? The New
[24:03] Testament. The Old Testament." So they
[24:06] do believe certain parts of the Old
[24:08] Testament. they'll take the part that
[24:09] they believe. But for us to, you know,
[24:12] being raised, many of you are you young
[24:14] people that have been raised in the
[24:15] message now, uh for some as myself that
[24:18] was not raised in it and um I had to be
[24:21] able to be introduced to it and be able
[24:22] to see it from the scripture first. And
[24:25] once it was pointed out to me from the
[24:27] Bible, then I felt it was my obligation
[24:30] because I was already preaching and
[24:31] pastoring a church. I felt that it was
[24:33] my obligation to go into the scripture
[24:35] and be able to look and see, did God
[24:38] promise in the New Testament that he
[24:41] would send prophets and use prophets?
[24:43] Would they be of the same caliber as
[24:46] they were of the Old Testament? Or were
[24:48] they men that would just stand up and
[24:50] say, "Thus sayith the Lord, you're
[24:52] sick." And thus sayith the Lord, you've
[24:53] got a problem. And thus sayith the Lord,
[24:55] you've got this and that. Or would it be
[24:57] men of the same caliber like it was at
[25:00] the Old Testament that the Bible says
[25:03] that the word of the Lord came to the
[25:06] prophets. Now that's not exactly the
[25:08] same thing as the modern day prophets.
[25:11] Now look at the words of the Lord Jesus
[25:12] in Matthew chapter
[25:14] 23:34. Jesus says, "Wherefore, behold,
[25:18] I send unto you
[25:21] prophets." Now this is after John the
[25:24] Baptist. Now either the word does not
[25:28] bear
[25:29] continuity or people who preach this
[25:33] don't bear continuity. I tend to think
[25:36] it's the people. Don't you? Because God
[25:38] cannot lie. So now the Lord Jesus
[25:41] saying, "Behold, wherefore behold, I
[25:44] send unto you prophets and wise men and
[25:48] scribes, and some of them you shall kill
[25:51] and crucify. Some of them shall you
[25:54] scourge in your synagogues and persecute
[25:57] them from city to city. Now, it tells us
[26:00] who's going to allow this persecution.
[26:02] The Romans did not have synagogues. The
[26:06] Greeks did not have synagogues.
[26:09] Synagogues were what place of worship?
[26:12] Jews. So Jesus not only said I'll send
[26:15] prophets, but he told who would be some
[26:18] of the main persecutors of those
[26:20] prophets, which was of course the Jews.
[26:22] Look also in Matthew
[26:24] 26:56. But all this was done that the
[26:28] scriptures of the
[26:31] prophets, the scriptures of the prophets
[26:36] might be fulfilled. So you mean that the
[26:40] that the prophets actually prophesied
[26:44] and spoke what would later be identified
[26:49] as
[26:50] scripture. Praise the Lord. But all this
[26:53] was done that the scriptures of the
[26:57] prophets might be fulfilled. Then all
[27:00] the disciples forsook him and fled. Now
[27:03] remember that Jesus from the uh from
[27:06] Good Friday on down, he fulfilled more
[27:08] scriptures in those last 72 hours of his
[27:11] life than he did for 33 and a2 years.
[27:14] And he is now quoting of course the
[27:16] things that was going to come to pass.
[27:18] But yet it was identified that what
[27:21] those prophets said was actually
[27:24] scripture. Luke 1 69. and he hath raised
[27:29] up an horn of salvation for us in the
[27:32] house of his servant David as he spake
[27:36] by the mouth of his holy prophets. Now
[27:40] this was God in reference here to the
[27:42] scripture that God actually spoke by the
[27:46] mouth of his holy prophets which have
[27:51] been since the world began. Again, Acts
[27:55] 3:1 18. but those things which God
[27:58] before had showed by the
[28:02] mouth of all his prophets. So if God did
[28:06] this in the Old Testament and God would
[28:08] send a New Testament prophet, how would
[28:11] God use that
[28:13] man? Would he just use him in visions
[28:16] and he would see things about people's
[28:17] lives and and tell them now you got a
[28:20] burden and you were praying? Or would
[28:22] not God, if he's going to send a
[28:24] prophet, would not he have the same
[28:26] caliber of man on the earth that would
[28:29] be able to catch the word of the Lord?
[28:32] Now, I know it would seem unusual for
[28:34] people that would come to our church and
[28:35] they would not have a clue as far as to
[28:38] what we believe. And we've seen all
[28:39] kinds of people that's come since we've
[28:41] built our new facility here. And some of
[28:43] them come one service, some of them
[28:45] can't even stay one service. And then
[28:47] someone will come back three or four
[28:48] times and then they decide it's not for
[28:50] them, which is understandable. And then
[28:52] they see us put scriptures up on the
[28:54] screen. More than pro more than likely
[28:56] most of them would have no problem with
[28:57] that. But then as I go to quoting from
[29:01] the message of the hour and then it
[29:04] would change from Acts 3:18 to Christ
[29:06] the mystery of God revealed or then came
[29:09] Jesus and called or at thy word or
[29:11] whatever it would be and they would look
[29:13] and see that thing. Oh my goodness. What
[29:16] I heard about these people are true.
[29:19] They're weird. They're very strange.
[29:21] They're quoting from men. Yeah. Sort of
[29:24] like their Baptist pastor does when he
[29:27] quotes from Chuck Swindoll.
[29:30] Sure. Or from Focus on the Family.
[29:34] Except I'm quoting from a prophet and
[29:37] they're quoting from an educator
[29:40] or a psychologist. But they have no
[29:42] problem in doing that because that's the
[29:45] way that men will do it. They get
[29:47] inspired from reading of this
[29:49] psychologist or this man. Well, as Billy
[29:52] Graham said, such and such and so and
[29:54] so. And my goodness, they don't get
[29:56] persecuted for quoting Billy Graham, but
[29:59] yet they think that we are so weird and
[30:01] so strange. But I wonder if we would
[30:04] have lived in the first century. Now
[30:06] remember they say historically that the
[30:08] first book of the New Testament was
[30:10] written was probably the book of
[30:12] Corinthians which was written around 50
[30:14] to 53
[30:18] AD. So the Holy Ghost fell in
[30:21] 33
[30:23] AD. So the New Testament church was
[30:26] established for 20 years before they had
[30:29] any New Testament scriptures.
[30:32] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wasn't
[30:34] even
[30:35] written. Wow. Wonder what they preached.
[30:40] So you can imagine then whenever they
[30:42] get these Bible scriptures that you and
[30:44] I read and love, how they must have
[30:48] rejoiced. And Paul told them, now
[30:50] whenever you read this letter, I want
[30:52] you also to read the letter from Leodysa
[30:56] and then I want you to get the letter
[30:57] from Thessalonica. So, you know what
[31:00] they done with those books as it were in
[31:03] that day? Similar to what we do with our
[31:06] message books today, just like we by the
[31:09] grace of God are continuing to help get
[31:12] the message books into parts of the
[31:15] world that do not yet have it. Now, it
[31:17] must have been such a blessing and they
[31:20] would have looked at it and said, "Oh
[31:22] my, this is from God's prophet and this
[31:25] is the word of the Lord." How many
[31:29] believes that's exactly what it was, the
[31:30] word of the Lord. Now notice again in
[31:33] Acts 3:1 19, this is what they told went
[31:36] on to tell them. Repent ye therefore and
[31:39] be converted that your sins may be
[31:41] blotted out when the times of refreshing
[31:44] shall come from the presence of the
[31:47] Lord. and he shall send Jesus Christ
[31:49] which was preached before you whom the
[31:52] heaven must
[31:54] receive until the time of
[31:59] restitution of all
[32:01] things. Now listen what is absolutely
[32:05] essential before the the Lord Jesus can
[32:09] come. The
[32:11] restitution of all things which God has
[32:15] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[32:20] prophets since the world began. So Jesus
[32:24] can't even come until all things have
[32:28] been restored or restituted to what? To
[32:33] the Torah, first five books of Moses.
[32:36] Was it just the law? What what's what's
[32:39] going to be restored? Back to what
[32:42] standard will it be restored to? Well,
[32:44] in the New Testament, we know that it
[32:46] was built upon the foundation of the
[32:48] apostles and the prophets. Is that what
[32:51] the Bible says? Notice in Romans 3 21,
[32:56] but now the righteousness of God without
[32:59] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[33:04] the law. First five books of Moses and
[33:08] the prophets, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
[33:11] Habacook, Nehemiah, on and on and on and
[33:13] on. the law and the prophets. The
[33:16] righteousness of God without the law is
[33:19] manifested being witnessed by the law
[33:22] and the prophets. Now here Paul in the
[33:24] New Testament is still referring back to
[33:28] the prophets. So this was the apostolic
[33:31] church and they still believed in
[33:35] prophets. Oh my goodness. And yet so
[33:38] many people say they are
[33:41] apostolic and make fun of prophets.
[33:43] Well, they're not the original
[33:44] apostolic, are they? 1 Corinthians
[33:47] 12:28. And God has set some in the
[33:50] church.
[33:52] First,
[33:53] first
[33:56] apostles.
[33:57] Secondarily,
[34:00] prophets. Thirdly, teachers. After that,
[34:03] miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
[34:08] governments, diversities of tongues.
[34:11] Now, here they are
[34:14] years years after the founding of the
[34:17] church, and they're still saying that
[34:20] God set prophets in the church. And the
[34:24] young people said, "Amen." Ephesians
[34:27] 2:19, "Now therefore, you are no more
[34:29] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[34:32] citizens with the saints." Now, this is
[34:34] not just the Ephesian church, but us as
[34:36] well. and of the household of God and
[34:40] are built upon the
[34:43] foundation of the
[34:46] apostles and prophets.
[34:50] Now, do you understand every Baptist
[34:52] church, Methodist, Church of God,
[34:56] Nazarene, Catholic, Unitarian,
[34:59] Universalist, Church of Christ,
[35:02] so-called Church of the Brethren, on and
[35:05] on and on. There's hardly any of them
[35:10] can fulfill this one scripture that we
[35:13] just
[35:14] read that are based upon the apostles
[35:18] and the prophets. Because the apostles
[35:21] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:23] Christ. And how do the Baptist churches
[35:26] baptize? Yes, sir. Titles, father, son,
[35:31] holy ghost.
[35:33] How do most of the Pentecostal churches
[35:35] baptize? I know I was one of them.
[35:38] Titles, father, son, holy ghost. They're
[35:41] not built on the doctrine of the
[35:44] apostles and the prophets. The prophets
[35:47] in the Old Testament never prophesied of
[35:51] three individual beings in the godhead.
[35:56] But they would say things like this.
[35:58] Deuteronomy 4:35, "Unto thee it was
[36:02] shown that thou mightest know that the
[36:05] Lord, he is
[36:08] God." Here, O Israel, the Lord our God
[36:12] is one. Isaiah said, "There is none
[36:16] beside me." So it ain't like there was
[36:19] an old God, an old man, and a young God
[36:22] sitting beside him. That old God, the
[36:24] ancient of days, said, "There ain't none
[36:27] beside me on either hand, right hand or
[36:30] left hand. There ain't nobody beside me.
[36:33] I am your husband. I am your
[36:36] maker." Amen. That's the doctrine of the
[36:39] apostles and the prophets. Now, think
[36:43] where we'd be tonight if God had not
[36:45] sent a prophet in our day to
[36:49] restore all things. Where would we be?
[36:52] another Pentecostal church baptizing
[36:57] entitles. What would we be today? Pretty
[36:59] much like everybody else. But God said,
[37:03] "I will restore, saith the Lord."
[37:06] Notice again here in Ephesians 3:5,
[37:10] which in other ages was not made known
[37:14] unto the sons of men, as it is now
[37:18] revealed unto his holy
[37:22] apostles and prophets by the spirit.
[37:26] Now, here's the
[37:28] apostolic foundation of what God's going
[37:31] to restore his church back to. 2 Peter
[37:34] 3:2 that you might be mindful of the
[37:37] words which were spoken by the
[37:41] whole oh my goodness scripture after
[37:45] scripture after scripture where the New
[37:48] Testament preachers referred back to
[37:53] prophets. You know what? As I read this,
[37:55] I'm beginning to wonder who the strange
[37:58] people really are. I'm beginning to
[38:01] think it ain't us after all, brother
[38:05] Maurice. It ain't us that's so far out.
[38:09] Actually, we believe the Bible,
[38:13] old and new testament,
[38:16] that you might be mindful of the words
[38:20] which were spoken before by the holy
[38:22] prophets and of the commandment of us,
[38:25] the apostles of the Lord and Savior.
[38:29] Now, Revelation
[38:31] 10:7, but in the days of the voice of
[38:34] the seventh angel. Now, what can become
[38:37] very confusing whenever people read this
[38:40] and they might hear us refer to this and
[38:42] say, "Are you saying that William Brham
[38:47] was an
[38:49] angel?" in the sense that this word is
[38:53] used in the Greek in the New Testament
[38:56] and the word angel means a messenger.
[39:01] Now it does not mean a holy heavenly
[39:05] being with wings on his back that's
[39:09] flying across the heavens and from be
[39:11] you know from building to building and
[39:13] he appears over there and then he flies
[39:14] over there and then he flies over there.
[39:16] But it's angelos which is the same word
[39:20] that is used for messenger. So in the
[39:23] days of the voice of the seventh
[39:26] messenger when he shall begin to sound
[39:30] the mystery of God should be finished.
[39:33] God never commits the preaching of the
[39:36] gospel to
[39:38] unredeemed
[39:39] angels.
[39:41] Unredeemed angels cannot feel like you
[39:45] do. You don't need an angel with wings
[39:48] on his back to be your pastor. You don't
[39:52] need an angel with wings on his back to
[39:55] be a p an evangelist like some of the
[39:57] brothers that are here tonight. But you
[40:00] need one, a messenger that has
[40:03] temptations like you, troubles like you,
[40:07] and they can cry like you cry. And they
[40:10] can feel fear and anxiety like you feel
[40:14] it. An angel of God that's never sinned,
[40:17] they cannot relate to your everyday
[40:20] troubles. As a matter of fact, Peter
[40:22] said talking about the baptism of the
[40:24] Holy Ghost, how great that it was. And
[40:26] he said, "The angels of God look into
[40:30] it." And that word means to peer. Per to
[40:35] look into it with wonder and amazement.
[40:41] And the angels are flabbergasted, as we
[40:44] would say, by the mystery of the baptism
[40:47] of the Holy Ghost and how God could love
[40:49] you and I and forgive us and give us so
[40:52] much mercy and grace. I'm I'm glad I'm
[40:56] very very glad to be honest with you
[40:58] that I ain't got a pastor that's an
[41:00] angel like that. Can you imagine one of
[41:02] them angels? They're trying to look into
[41:04] the Holy Ghost and say, "Why does God
[41:06] even love you, Levi? You sorry outfit.
[41:09] You've messed up so much. you've made so
[41:11] many mistakes like all the rest of these
[41:12] young people and the preacher preaching
[41:14] too and them angels that say, "God, why
[41:17] do you even fool with them?" But God
[41:20] don't commit his gospel of grace to
[41:22] beings like that. But he commits it to
[41:24] men like this man and that man and that
[41:28] man and men that were just like you and
[41:32] courage. People are saying, "Oh my boy,
[41:34] men of God, they have so much strength
[41:37] and courage. They're never afraid.
[41:39] They're just as afraid as you are.
[41:43] They're just as afraid as you are. But
[41:46] they are called by God to meet the
[41:49] challenge of this hour. I can follow an
[41:52] angel like that.
[41:54] Now notice in First Kings 16:7, and
[41:58] let's look a little bit of this from
[42:00] from the mirror of the Old Testament,
[42:03] how that the word actually came to the
[42:06] prophets. First Kings 16:7. And by the
[42:08] hand of the prophet Jahu, the son
[42:13] Haniah, came the
[42:16] word of the Lord.
[42:19] Now I want you to notice how the author
[42:21] of Kings
[42:23] attributes what came through these men.
[42:28] The word of the Lord against Bashe and
[42:33] against his house even for all the evil
[42:36] that he had done in the sight of the
[42:37] Lord in provoking him to anger with the
[42:40] work of his hands and being like the
[42:42] house of Jeroboam because he killed him.
[42:45] So now think God could have printed them
[42:47] a Bible and just said, "Here, hand this
[42:49] out. Hand this out in the kingdom and
[42:51] give this to everybody." But instead of
[42:53] God doing that, God had already chose
[42:56] his way. I'm going to speak it by the
[42:58] mouths of my prophets. Jeremiah 28:12.
[43:02] Then the word of the Lord came unto
[43:07] Jeremiah the prophet. After that,
[43:10] Haniah the prophet had broke the yoke
[43:14] from off the neck of the prophet
[43:19] Jeremiah. So here we got two
[43:22] prophets. One of them was sent by God,
[43:26] but both of them are saying God sent
[43:29] him. So Jeremiah makes this wooden yolk
[43:33] first and then another one out of iron.
[43:36] This one's the wooden one. So he walks
[43:38] in with his hands. The yolk is around
[43:41] his neck. A big long bar sticking out
[43:43] maybe about like this. So his hand would
[43:45] be chained on this side, his hand on
[43:47] this side, and this would be around his
[43:50] neck. And he's yolked. Haniah runs up to
[43:54] him and said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord,
[43:56] you're lying. You're picking on God's
[43:59] people. You're saying harsh, cruel
[44:02] things." and he grabs this yoke and he
[44:04] jerks it off of Jeremiah's neck and he
[44:06] breaks it and says, "Thus saith the
[44:08] Lord, I'll break this yoke in two
[44:12] years." So now you're the children of
[44:15] Israel, which one are you going to
[44:18] believe? Now, depending on if you're a
[44:21] spiritual Israelite or a carnal
[44:24] Israelite, if you're a carnal one,
[44:27] you're going to gravitate toward the
[44:29] man, which is always a sign of a false
[44:31] prophet, to lessen the severity of God's
[44:35] judgment. And they're always leaning
[44:38] toward the broad way, which leads to
[44:43] destruction because it's it's the easier
[44:47] way. One of the signs of a true prophet
[44:49] of God is not just what he says comes to
[44:52] pass and it will, but he will always
[44:56] point to people to the straight and
[45:00] narrow way. It's the hated way. It's the
[45:03] despised way. But God knows he can trust
[45:07] his prophets.
[45:09] Now God tells Jeremiah, "Go and tell
[45:14] Haniah, saying, Thus sayeth the Lord,
[45:18] thou hast broken the yolks of wood, but
[45:21] thou shalt make for them yolks of
[45:25] iron." And he did. Of course, Haniah
[45:28] keeps on prophesying. Then Jeremiah
[45:31] turns around and tells him, "Thus saeth
[45:33] the Lord, you will die this
[45:37] year." And he
[45:41] did. Now look in Jeremiah chapter 46.
[45:45] and the word of the Lord which came to
[45:47] Jeremiah the prophet against the
[45:51] Gentiles against Egypt against the army
[45:55] of
[45:56] Pharaoh king of Egypt which was by the
[45:59] river Euphrates and Cares. Now remember
[46:02] Jeremiah was one of the few Israelite
[46:06] prophets that was sent to Gentiles as
[46:09] well. So was Elijah. Some of them such
[46:12] as Amos and Habac and them, they were
[46:16] Jewish prophets only. They never
[46:17] prophesied to the Gentiles. But the
[46:20] spirit of Elijah not only speaks to the
[46:23] Jews, but also to the
[46:27] Gentiles. Notice again Jeremiah 47:1.
[46:30] The word of the Lord that came to
[46:31] Jeremiah the prophet against the
[46:34] Philistines before that Pharaoh smokeote
[46:38] Gaza. Now notice this over and over
[46:40] again that God gives his word. So if God
[46:44] had something to say for the age, he
[46:48] didn't say it to the king. Now there was
[46:51] thousands of priests, but the word of
[46:54] the Lord never came to a priest. There
[46:57] was thousands of
[46:59] Levites,
[47:01] coites,
[47:02] cherosites, all kinds of people
[47:04] associated with the tabernacle and
[47:07] worship and all kinds of things. You'll
[47:10] never find the Bible saying the word of
[47:12] the Lord came to a Levite. The word of
[47:16] the Lord came to the cherosite. The word
[47:19] of the Lord came to the heart player.
[47:21] The word of the Lord came to the Larry
[47:24] player. But the word of the Lord came to
[47:27] the prophet.
[47:29] It's the same today. Now, we got some
[47:31] great musicians around the message,
[47:32] great singers, great preachers, great
[47:35] pastors, great evangelists. But the word
[47:37] don't come to a pastor. It comes to a
[47:40] prophet. And the young people said,
[47:43] notice in Daniel chapter 9:2, in the
[47:46] first year of his reign, I
[47:49] Daniel
[47:51] understood by
[47:54] books. Oh my
[47:56] goodness. So, here is Daniel the prophet
[47:59] now down in the
[48:01] kingdom which Nebuchadnezzar had carried
[48:04] them
[48:05] down and he's been there for quite some
[48:08] time.
[48:10] And Daniel was reading some message
[48:13] books.
[48:17] Praise the Lord. You know who had
[48:20] preached them message books? Jeremiah
[48:24] the prophet. Now Jeremiah was already
[48:27] gone. And how did Daniel
[48:30] know that there was supposed to be a
[48:34] pope that would come out of
[48:36] America? Now I'm updating it.
[48:40] How did Daniel know that? How did we
[48:42] know that? Because he had a prophet to
[48:45] tell us way back in
[48:48] 1954. Now, I mentioned it to you last
[48:51] week that that last time that they had a
[48:54] pope come in, I'd done a little research
[48:55] and a little bit of looking and the the
[48:57] theologians and all those great people
[49:00] said there will never be a pope that
[49:02] will ever come out of America. One of
[49:05] the brothers in her church heard me say
[49:06] that. He even asked AI and AI had said
[49:10] it would be totally impossible. This was
[49:13] before it happened. Totally impossible
[49:15] for one to ever come out of America. But
[49:19] you know what? When God says something,
[49:21] it don't make no difference what AI
[49:23] says. It don't make no difference what
[49:25] theologian said. When God says it, it
[49:28] will come to pass. Now, can you imagine
[49:31] when Brother Brandham saw a car
[49:36] 1933, a car going down the road with no
[49:40] steering wheel and a man and a woman had
[49:44] a table in there and they were playing a
[49:47] game. Now, somebody told me the other
[49:49] day that Brother Rob
[49:52] Weber had a
[49:54] car. I I suppose this is facts, right?
[49:58] And he beckoned that car. Is this true,
[50:00] brother Rob? To come and pick him up.
[50:04] You some of y'all seen it. Now, you
[50:07] imagine years ago when brother Brandham
[50:09] said that that people thought that's
[50:11] crazy. That's absolutely crazy. One of
[50:13] the brothers in our church, which drives
[50:15] a tractor and trailer all over America,
[50:18] had told me the other day that he has
[50:20] seen multiple tractors and trailers out
[50:24] in California, out in Las Vegas. He saw
[50:27] them tractors and trailers backing into
[50:31] freight docks. 40 foot trailer with a
[50:35] tractor probably wind up being 52 to 55t
[50:39] long. Backing the trailer in beside
[50:42] another tractor and trailer by remote
[50:46] control or a computer or something and
[50:50] there ain't nobody in there. Can you
[50:51] imagine going up and knocking on the
[50:53] window say, "Hey buddy, you're in the
[50:54] wrong lane." And there ain't nobody in
[50:56] there. There ain't nobody in there. Now,
[50:59] if people would have said that years
[51:00] ago, they said, "You're out of your
[51:02] mind." But God's word never fails.
[51:06] Listen, young people, don't you listen
[51:07] to the eyes of of or the ears rather,
[51:10] mouths of the unbelievers and let that
[51:12] go into your ears and sew a seed in your
[51:14] heart to try to make you doubt the
[51:16] message of the hour. Because who but a
[51:20] prophet of God would be able to look
[51:22] ahead in time and see things that seem
[51:26] like it was totally impossible for it to
[51:29] be. Oh my. So Daniel said in the first
[51:33] year of his reign, I Daniel understood
[51:37] by
[51:38] books the number of the years whereof
[51:43] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[51:46] the prophet. I love it when these
[51:48] prophets will refer to other prophets
[51:52] that he would accomplish 70 years in the
[51:57] desolation of Jerusalem. Now, how did
[51:59] they know it was getting close? Cuz they
[52:02] had been studying the books of Jeremiah.
[52:08] Praise the Lord. Now, we can study the
[52:11] books of Paul and we should do that. But
[52:15] God has also given us a prophet in this
[52:18] day which has given us updated
[52:22] prophecies which will not will never
[52:26] never clash with them scriptures. But
[52:29] all it does is update us and bring us to
[52:32] a spot to be able to say Paul never saw
[52:35] America being destroyed and on fire. He
[52:39] never saw Los Angeles sink. Right? Paul
[52:42] never wrote that. Naam never wrote that.
[52:44] Habacook never wrote that. Obadiah,
[52:46] Amos, Hosea, none of those prophets ever
[52:49] wrote that. They never saw America being
[52:52] destroyed. They never saw America being
[52:55] written in in Revelation chapter 13. Who
[52:58] can make war with the beast? Look at it.
[53:02] Look at it. Just a change of the
[53:04] president and 120 days, however long
[53:08] it's been, it's absolutely unbelievable.
[53:12] And I know some of the things that are
[53:14] happening are remarkable, but on the
[53:16] other hand, they are frightening as well
[53:20] because we can see what the change of a
[53:23] president does to where the nations
[53:27] around the world just six months ago had
[53:30] a total different outlook of us in
[53:33] America. Why? Because we had such a weak
[53:36] leader. Now, I'm neither a Democrat nor
[53:38] a Republican. I ain't never voted in my
[53:40] life and I'm too old to start doing it
[53:41] now. I don't care nothing about
[53:43] politics. I care about prophecy.
[53:46] Amen. I care about prophecy. But look at
[53:49] what the change of the leadership has
[53:52] done to our nation. And look what it has
[53:55] done. The strength that has brought back
[53:57] to our image. And remember, America is
[54:01] identified prophetically. Well, how are
[54:03] we going to be able to know where
[54:04] America fits? We're going to read
[54:07] Revelation. We will, but we won't find
[54:09] her name in there.
[54:12] We're going to read Thessalonians. Yeah,
[54:14] we will, but we won't find her name. But
[54:17] God said, "Now, children, in the last
[54:19] days, I want you all to study the books
[54:22] of prophecy of your hour, and you'll be
[54:25] able to find the name of your nation
[54:28] spoke out." And I'll vindicate this man,
[54:32] and I'll give him prophecies that'll
[54:34] happen in your days. Now think young
[54:36] people how blessed you are. You are
[54:39] setting in the hour of modern events
[54:42] made clear sir by prophecy.
[54:46] You imagine brother Neville some of the
[54:49] old-timers that lived back in the day
[54:51] when brother Random was here and they
[54:53] they died. They went down believing
[54:56] there would come a time that there'd be
[54:58] a car on the road and they probably
[55:00] talked about it and said, "How you
[55:01] reckon it'll ever be? How will it be?" I
[55:03] don't know, brother. Boy, if that
[55:05] prophet saw it, it'll be that way. And
[55:08] your eyes are seeing it. And whenever he
[55:11] said there'd be a pope from America out
[55:13] of the United States, I thought, "Oh my
[55:15] goodness, can you imagine?" Brother
[55:16] Neville and the trustees and the deacons
[55:18] and the preachers and all them. And they
[55:20] lived and died and they've gone on to
[55:22] their reward and they never got to see
[55:24] it. But you in your lifetime have seen
[55:28] one prophecy after another. Oh, we say
[55:32] he guessed it, Brother Donnie. I'll tell
[55:34] you what. If he guessed it, I'd like for
[55:36] you to make a guess like that.
[55:40] I'd like for all these people that are
[55:42] attacking us and all these folks that
[55:43] have left the message, the believe the
[55:45] sign, which they don't believe the sign
[55:46] anyway. They're non-believers of the
[55:48] sign. I'd like for them to make a a
[55:51] prediction and let let's let them give
[55:54] us one.
[55:58] Testing one, two, three. One, two,
[56:00] three. Come on. They stream our
[56:03] services. They always stream these. They
[56:04] hate these prophet ones. I make a
[56:07] challenge to any of you believe the sign
[56:10] people.
[56:12] You make your prediction. Amen. You make
[56:15] your
[56:17] prophecy. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[56:21] Now listen. Daniel
[56:23] says that he would accomplish 70 years
[56:26] in the desolations of Jerusalem. And I
[56:29] set my face unto the Lord
[56:33] God to seek by
[56:36] prayers and supplications and fasting
[56:39] and
[56:40] sackcloths and
[56:43] ashes. That's kind of what was doing
[56:45] here last night. That somber. Wasn't
[56:47] that a somber service last night? Wasn't
[56:49] it? I I I've thought about it all day. I
[56:51] I've been under that influence all day.
[56:53] Just I've not been able to shake it.
[56:56] Why? Because we look and see our
[56:58] prophecy. These are our prophecies,
[57:01] brother Joe. Our day, God has allowed
[57:04] us. You understand that people have
[57:06] lived the the way that God showed them.
[57:09] And many of them live their entire life
[57:11] and maybe never get to see one prophecy
[57:14] come to
[57:15] pass. And God has allowed us in this
[57:18] generation to see one after another
[57:20] after another. And they're happening so
[57:22] fast, we can't even hard to keep up with
[57:24] them. How blessed we are.
[57:26] Notice in Haggi 1:1, "In the second year
[57:30] of Darius the king, on the sixth month,
[57:31] and the first day of the month came the
[57:34] word of the Lord by Haggi the
[57:38] prophet, unto Zerubbabel the son of
[57:41] Sheil, governor of Judah, and to Joshua
[57:44] the son of Josedc the high priest,
[57:46] saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of
[57:51] hosts, saying, This people say, the time
[57:55] is not
[57:57] come the time that the Lord's house
[58:00] should be built. Then came the word of
[58:03] the Lord by Haggi the prophet, saying,
[58:05] Notice how prophets
[58:08] words could be
[58:10] prolonged or they could be for a timely
[58:14] season such as a present tense
[58:18] word. So the people were saying, "It
[58:20] ain't time to build the house of God. It
[58:22] ain't time. No, no, let's put it off."
[58:25] And God gave them a word for right then.
[58:27] Now this is not for future
[58:29] generations. And then he says it is time
[58:33] for you all ye to dwell in your sealed
[58:37] houses and this house lie
[58:41] waste. That's what I love about God when
[58:44] he gets ready to say something. If it's
[58:46] for a future, he can say it in such a
[58:48] way. If it's for present tense, he'll
[58:51] charge the anointed servants of God and
[58:53] they say, "You you're you're building
[58:54] your own houses and you're making them
[58:56] beautiful." And look at the house of
[58:58] God. Look in Zechariah 1 verse one. In
[59:01] the eighth month, in the second year of
[59:04] Darius came the word of the Lord. I'm
[59:08] sure you're getting the pattern here. So
[59:10] the word of the Lord came to the
[59:12] prophets, the son of Bachariah, the son
[59:15] of Idu the prophet, saying, The Lord
[59:17] hath been so displeased with your
[59:20] fathers. Therefore say thou unto them,
[59:21] thus sayith the Lord of hosts, turn ye
[59:23] unto me, sayeth the Lord of hosts, and I
[59:25] will turn unto you, saith the Lord of
[59:29] hosts. So God established Israel on the
[59:35] word of his prophets.
[59:38] Now, let's let's look if we can, we'll
[59:40] change it here in just a little
[59:42] different direction. Watch false
[59:44] prophets. Jeremiah 14:14. Then the Lord
[59:47] said unto me, "The prophets prophesy
[59:51] lies in my name. I sent them not,
[59:54] neither have I commanded them, neither
[59:57] spake unto them. They prophesy unto you
[1:00:00] a false vision and divination and a
[1:00:03] thing of not and the deceit of their
[1:00:07] heart. Therefore, thus sayaith the Lord
[1:00:10] concerning the prophets that prophesy in
[1:00:13] my name. Now, they're not stand up and
[1:00:14] say, "Hey, I'm telling you a lie. I'm
[1:00:17] telling you in the name of Daryl Ward.
[1:00:19] I'm telling you in the name of Donnie
[1:00:20] Reagan." But they actually sit up and
[1:00:22] say, "I'm telling you this in the name
[1:00:25] of the Lord God of Israel." In the name
[1:00:28] of the Lord of hosts, this and this and
[1:00:31] this. And God said, "They're liars.
[1:00:35] They're
[1:00:36] liars. Thus saith the Lord concerning
[1:00:39] the prophets that prophesy in my name. I
[1:00:41] sent them not. Yet they say, sword and
[1:00:45] famine shall not be in this land." Watch
[1:00:48] the sign now of false
[1:00:51] prophets. It's always prophecy of good.
[1:00:57] God loves you and oh, he wants to bless
[1:00:59] you and oh my, all you got to do is sew
[1:01:03] a little seed into my ministry and then
[1:01:06] God will bless you. Remember, nothing
[1:01:09] from nothing leaves nothing. So, if you
[1:01:12] need to be blessed financially, send us
[1:01:15] $5 and then God will send you 10. Send
[1:01:19] us 15 and God may send you 150. Uh,
[1:01:23] brother, uh, uh, what about what about
[1:01:25] should I live a holiness life? Oh, you
[1:01:27] don't need that. That was in the Old
[1:01:29] Testament. But be sure and enclose your
[1:01:32] offering with your prayer
[1:01:35] request. Mhm. Well, brother, do we need
[1:01:38] to get on fire with God? Do we need to
[1:01:40] have an oldfashioned revival? Oh, no.
[1:01:42] The church has moved beyond that. Now
[1:01:45] God understands where we are. False
[1:01:48] prophets are still in the land, are they
[1:01:50] not?
[1:01:51] Notice in Lamentations 2:14, "Thy
[1:01:54] prophets have seen vain and foolish
[1:01:58] things over thee. They have not
[1:02:05] discovered." Ah, so they can see all
[1:02:09] kinds of spiritual things
[1:02:12] so-called, but they don't see the sins
[1:02:14] of the people, the iniquity of the
[1:02:17] people.
[1:02:19] Oh my goodness. They have not discovered
[1:02:22] thine iniquity to turn away thy
[1:02:27] captivity. So their captivity was linked
[1:02:31] to their sins. But false prophets are
[1:02:34] saying, "Oh, it's fine. It's fine. God
[1:02:37] understands. That's what the blood is
[1:02:40] for. That's what the blood is for.
[1:02:42] Because none of us can be perfect in
[1:02:45] this life." And God gave the blood
[1:02:47] because he knew that you would fall
[1:02:49] short of the glory of God and you would
[1:02:51] sin and even the preachers would drink a
[1:02:54] little bit on the side and the preachers
[1:02:56] would you know that they wouldn't be
[1:02:58] able to live right either and and God
[1:03:00] knew it would be that way but that's why
[1:03:03] he died on the
[1:03:04] cross turning the grace of our God into
[1:03:10] lasciviousness. God knows the reason why
[1:03:13] people can't live right in this day.
[1:03:15] they're not born again. That's the very
[1:03:18] reason if you get that snake killed out
[1:03:21] of your heart and you get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:23] in there, you can overcome every devil
[1:03:26] out of hell that comes your way. As a
[1:03:30] matter of fact, you are more than a
[1:03:33] conqueror. You won't just meet the
[1:03:35] challenge of the hour. You will have
[1:03:37] more power, more joy, more peace.
[1:03:40] Hallelujah. God ain't running out and
[1:03:42] just handing it out by thimbleful at a
[1:03:45] time and said, "Now stretch this out
[1:03:47] about six months if you can because I'm
[1:03:49] running short on joy up here in heaven.
[1:03:51] I'm running show short on joy and and
[1:03:54] power and peace." But God said, "I'll
[1:03:56] tell you what, children. I've got so
[1:03:58] much goodness and so much mercy and so
[1:04:00] much power. Oh, you'll never run out."
[1:04:03] The prophet said, "Can you imagine a
[1:04:05] little bitty fish being out on the ocean
[1:04:08] and saying, "I better drink of this
[1:04:10] water sparingly because I might run
[1:04:13] out." Oh, that would be about us trying
[1:04:16] to exhaust the blessing of God. There
[1:04:18] ain't no way we can ever do it. Notice
[1:04:20] in Matthew 17, now the same Lord Jesus
[1:04:23] that said he would send prophets also
[1:04:25] warned us about false ones. Beware of
[1:04:30] false prophets.
[1:04:33] which come to you in sheep's
[1:04:38] clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
[1:04:44] wolves. So you know what they do, right?
[1:04:47] So they put on a sheep's
[1:04:52] costume. So they put it on, put their
[1:04:55] hand in, their arm in, then they zip it
[1:04:59] up.
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:03] And then
[1:05:05] [Music]
[1:05:07] they How's that
[1:05:10] sound? Now they can't really do what
[1:05:13] they
[1:05:18] do, but they've got to go
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:32] But Jesus said they'd be clothed in
[1:05:35] sheep's clothing. So they'll come right
[1:05:38] among the sheep and they'll eat
[1:05:41] grass. Of course, it makes them sick to
[1:05:43] the stomach because it's too rich for
[1:05:44] them. They're meat eaters. Wolves don't
[1:05:48] eat
[1:05:48] grass. Ain't it amazing how far a false
[1:05:52] prophet will go to impersonate a real
[1:05:55] one.
[1:05:57] Now Jesus said, "But inwardly they are
[1:06:00] ravening wolves." Luke 6:26, "Woe unto
[1:06:04] you when all men speak well of you. For
[1:06:08] so did their
[1:06:11] fathers to the false prophets." Oh, so
[1:06:15] here's another sign of a false prophet.
[1:06:17] They don't hardly make anybody mad.
[1:06:20] They're just politicians like, you know,
[1:06:23] so they don't Oh, brother, where do you
[1:06:24] stand on this? Uh, where do you
[1:06:28] stand? Now, this may surprise you, but
[1:06:31] there are message preachers that are the
[1:06:34] same way. As a matter of fact, I'm on a
[1:06:35] chat with some, and you go discussing
[1:06:38] this or that or the other, you will
[1:06:40] never know where certain men stand until
[1:06:43] everybody else on the chat tells where
[1:06:46] they stand. And then this one, this one,
[1:06:49] and this one will finally voice where
[1:06:52] they
[1:06:53] stand. You talking about a
[1:06:56] coward and preach the
[1:06:59] message? Well, glory. Oh, so you thought
[1:07:03] all the false prophets was just out
[1:07:05] there. No, no, I tell you, they're not.
[1:07:07] They're right among us as well. Now,
[1:07:10] notice Acts 20:29. For I know
[1:07:15] this. I know
[1:07:17] this, that after my
[1:07:21] departure shall grievous
[1:07:25] wolves enter in among
[1:07:29] you, not sparing the flock.
[1:07:33] Now watch the sign of a false pastor,
[1:07:36] false apostle, false teacher, false
[1:07:39] prophet, whatever they are. Their
[1:07:43] concern is not about sparing the
[1:07:48] flock. It's not sparing the flock. It's
[1:07:52] dividing the flock, confusing the flock,
[1:07:58] deceiving the flock. But a true servant
[1:08:02] of God wants to spare the flock. Spare
[1:08:05] them what? False prophets, false
[1:08:09] teaching, confusion, anything that would
[1:08:12] that would weaken their walk with God.
[1:08:16] But a false one, it's all about
[1:08:21] them. Oh, how it must have broke Paul's
[1:08:23] heart to write this. But I'm sure glad
[1:08:25] he did. also of your own
[1:08:30] selves. Of your own selves. So it'll be
[1:08:33] men from among your own ranks. Men who
[1:08:36] say they believe my message. Paul could
[1:08:38] say also of your own selves shall men
[1:08:42] rise speaking
[1:08:44] perverse things.
[1:08:50] Oh, so this is another sign of a false
[1:08:54] one. To draw away
[1:09:00] disciples after
[1:09:05] Christ. After
[1:09:07] who?
[1:09:09] What? After them. Now what? What are
[1:09:13] these people? False
[1:09:16] leaders. False prophets.
[1:09:19] Notice again in Revelation 2:14, "I have
[1:09:22] a few things against thee, because thou
[1:09:25] hast there them that hold the doctrine
[1:09:29] of Balum, who taught Bailac to cast a
[1:09:34] stumbling
[1:09:35] block before the children of
[1:09:39] Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto
[1:09:43] idols, and to commit fornication."
[1:09:46] Now, this is of course the church age
[1:09:49] that God's saying, I've got something
[1:09:51] against you
[1:09:53] all because you actually, he said, you
[1:09:56] have them there that hold the doctrine
[1:09:59] of
[1:10:00] Balum. Now, this is amazing because you
[1:10:03] don't find these words being said quite
[1:10:05] like this in the Old
[1:10:07] Testament. But this is God speaking to a
[1:10:11] prophet on the aisle of Patmas. And
[1:10:13] these are the words of the Lord Jesus.
[1:10:15] And the Lord Jesus calls this the
[1:10:17] doctrine of Balum. So what was the
[1:10:20] doctrine of Balum? It was that he taught
[1:10:25] Bailac, King
[1:10:27] Bailac, how to cast a stumbling block
[1:10:31] before the children of Israel.
[1:10:33] So, Josephus says, and Tacticus and some
[1:10:37] of the other historians of this time
[1:10:39] frame writing back about what happened
[1:10:42] was that the daughters of Moab were
[1:10:45] very, very beautiful women, dressed
[1:10:48] ungodly, acted
[1:10:50] ungodly, and Bailac tried to get Balum
[1:10:53] to prophesy, we looked at it several
[1:10:55] weeks ago, against Israel, but God
[1:10:57] wouldn't let him do it. His prophecy was
[1:11:01] 100% accurate. One of the most profound
[1:11:04] prophecies of the Old Testament, Numbers
[1:11:07] chapter 24, a star shall arise out of
[1:11:12] Jacob. But yet, it was not the prophecy
[1:11:15] of Balam that was wrong. It was the
[1:11:19] doctrine. So once Balam got down out
[1:11:22] from under the anointing, he looked out
[1:11:24] upon the children of Israel and he
[1:11:27] says, "I know a way you can get them."
[1:11:31] So then Joseph says that they built up
[1:11:34] they had little booths on the outside of
[1:11:37] the camp of Israel. Now they're camping
[1:11:38] near the land of
[1:11:40] Moab. So they'd have little booths sort
[1:11:43] of like we do whenever we have our fall
[1:11:44] fest and they have people, you know,
[1:11:46] fixing donuts over here and frying
[1:11:48] baloney over here and this and that over
[1:11:50] there. So these women, these beautiful
[1:11:53] women were out there and they had this
[1:11:55] little booth over here and this little
[1:11:57] booth over there and they started
[1:11:58] flirting with them sons of
[1:12:02] God. And then it went from one thing to
[1:12:04] another to another. And then they
[1:12:07] started actually committing adultery
[1:12:09] right
[1:12:11] there. Now that is the doctrine of
[1:12:15] Balum. Now, here we are thousands of
[1:12:17] years later in this church age and God
[1:12:20] said, "You've got some in the church
[1:12:22] there and they're preaching the doctrine
[1:12:25] of
[1:12:26] Balum." Now, you imagine they would have
[1:12:28] said, "Wow, we're not preaching the
[1:12:30] doctrine of Balum." My goodness, we've
[1:12:32] not even referred to Balum. But what was
[1:12:35] Balum's doctrine?
[1:12:39] interject sin in with the truth in order
[1:12:42] to divert the the attention of the
[1:12:45] people little by little and you'll pull
[1:12:49] them away from the
[1:12:51] word and then you will force the hand of
[1:12:55] God to punish his own
[1:13:00] children. It's a very cunning thing,
[1:13:03] isn't it? Oh my. So he says, "Who taught
[1:13:08] bailac to cast a stumbling block before
[1:13:11] the children of Israel to eat things
[1:13:13] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[1:13:17] fornication." Any you Bible readers
[1:13:19] remember how this plague was actually
[1:13:23] stopped when God sent forth a plague
[1:13:26] among the children of Israel and
[1:13:29] thousands of them. What was it? 14,000.
[1:13:31] I think it's been a while since I read
[1:13:33] it, but I'm thinking over 14,000. Was it
[1:13:36] Brother Daryl? something like that that
[1:13:37] died. And here come a man that would
[1:13:41] have seemed so cruel and so
[1:13:44] hard. And one of the Israelite men took
[1:13:48] one of the daughters of Moab to his
[1:13:50] tent. And here come this man with a
[1:13:53] javelin in his hand and thrust this
[1:13:59] Israelite and this Moabitete woman
[1:14:01] through with a javelin and killed them
[1:14:06] both. And it stopped the
[1:14:09] plague. And God said because Phineas did
[1:14:13] this I will make an everlasting covenant
[1:14:17] with him.
[1:14:20] But most people would think that man was
[1:14:22] a murderer. He was so cruel. He had no
[1:14:27] love. But you see, he did have love. But
[1:14:31] he had love and the right priority. He
[1:14:34] no doubt loved that man. And he hated to
[1:14:37] have to do that. But he loved his God
[1:14:40] more than he loved that man. And the
[1:14:42] spirit of God must have inspired him.
[1:14:44] And whenever he ran in and put that
[1:14:47] javelin right through that man and that
[1:14:49] woman and the plague of God was stayed
[1:14:52] and it so moved the heart of God. Oh may
[1:14:56] may we be like the Phineas in the
[1:14:59] message of the hour and not not just
[1:15:02] necessarily preachers but may we stand
[1:15:04] as young people and say Lord let let me
[1:15:07] be a light. Let me be one that will
[1:15:10] stand for the truth in this end time. Oh
[1:15:14] my. Let's read a few more. We'll stop.
[1:15:17] So this is the way we'll know a false
[1:15:19] prophet. Matthew 7:16. You shall know
[1:15:22] them by their fruits. Do men gather
[1:15:26] grapes of thorns or figs of thistles. A
[1:15:32] false
[1:15:33] prophet can say so much of the word. The
[1:15:38] Bible says this and the Bible says that
[1:15:40] and the Bible says something else and
[1:15:42] the Bible says this, but remember,
[1:15:46] listen to them long enough and they will
[1:15:49] leave the
[1:15:51] word. They can't be false and always say
[1:15:55] 100% with the word. Totally against
[1:15:57] their nature. Matthew
[1:16:00] 24:11, "Many false prophets shall rise
[1:16:05] and shall deceive
[1:16:07] many." Now, boy, the Baptist would all
[1:16:09] say, "Amen to that scripture." And the
[1:16:12] all the unbelief the sign would say,
[1:16:14] "Amen to that scripture." Yes, sir.
[1:16:16] That's exactly what we're talking about.
[1:16:19] False prophets in the land. Well, now I
[1:16:23] guess there's something about this I I
[1:16:24] apparently don't understand.
[1:16:27] So, we will say, amen, that there are
[1:16:30] false
[1:16:31] prophets, but it don't make no sense
[1:16:34] that there will be false ones. If there
[1:16:36] ain't no true ones,
[1:16:40] it's impossible for there to be false
[1:16:42] prophets. Unless there's been a true one
[1:16:45] in the land somewhere, if not, the false
[1:16:48] ones would be the true one. There could
[1:16:50] not be counterfeit money, you know, you
[1:16:53] unless there was a real money. If not,
[1:16:55] the counterfeit would be the real.
[1:16:59] Notice now, for there shall arise,
[1:17:01] Matthew
[1:17:03] 24:24, false
[1:17:07] Christs, notice not false
[1:17:11] Jesuses. How many of you people that
[1:17:14] know any Spanish people whose name is
[1:17:18] Jesus? Anybody? Yeah, there's lots of
[1:17:21] them. It's a common name.
[1:17:24] It's a common name, Jesus, Jesus. But
[1:17:28] when Jesus said this, he did not say
[1:17:31] that there would be false
[1:17:34] Jesus's but false Christ. And what does
[1:17:37] the word Christ
[1:17:39] mean, anointed ones, the
[1:17:43] Messiah? So in the world of Christendom,
[1:17:46] they won't say, "I'm Jesus. I'm Jesus.
[1:17:49] I'm Jesus." But they say, "Glory to God.
[1:17:52] We've got the anointing. We've got the
[1:17:54] Holy Spirit in our church. We've got the
[1:17:58] anointing." And is it real? A lot of
[1:18:00] times it is. But you don't judge them by
[1:18:03] the anointing. You judge them by the
[1:18:05] word they preach. But now listen what
[1:18:08] they will do. For there shall arise
[1:18:10] false Christs and false prophets, and
[1:18:14] shall show great
[1:18:17] signs and wonders in so
[1:18:21] much that if it were
[1:18:26] possible, they shall deceive the very
[1:18:29] elect. Which shows
[1:18:31] me this move will not be out just in the
[1:18:37] denominations, but some of this will be
[1:18:39] around the message of the
[1:18:43] elect. How could it almost deceive the
[1:18:46] elect unless they come in contact with
[1:18:49] it face to
[1:18:52] face? It's got to be that close to us.
[1:18:59] And the young people said, "Oh, Brother
[1:19:02] Donnie, that scares me. That scares me."
[1:19:04] You don't have to be scared. Be filled
[1:19:06] with the Holy Ghost. Pray. The Holy
[1:19:09] Ghost cannot be deceived. And if you'll
[1:19:12] pray and be filled with the spirit of
[1:19:14] God, and you check every man, including
[1:19:17] me, I'm not a bit worried about you
[1:19:20] checking me by the scripture. Check me.
[1:19:23] Check me. You need to Yes. Check brother
[1:19:27] Joe. Check brother Daryl. That's why
[1:19:29] that I can check brother Brandon by the
[1:19:31] scripture.
[1:19:34] Why? He was a word prophet. If brother
[1:19:36] Brandon wasn't a wasn't a right along
[1:19:39] and total agreement with the word of
[1:19:40] God, how could it be a prophet sent from
[1:19:42] God?
[1:19:44] Second Peter chapter 2 verse one. But
[1:19:48] there were false prophets also among the
[1:19:51] people, even as there shall be false
[1:19:54] teachers among you. Privy shall bring in
[1:19:59] damnable heresies. Now notice privy
[1:20:03] which means they will start in
[1:20:08] private. So they'll go from house to
[1:20:11] house or you know have a little meeting
[1:20:13] and you know just just two or three of
[1:20:15] us and well the pastor don't need to be
[1:20:18] here that's okay you know they just you
[1:20:20] know I'm kind of wondering about brother
[1:20:22] Donnie ain't you all you know I'm kind
[1:20:23] of wondering about him and so they meet
[1:20:26] privately well not this is just us you
[1:20:30] know well if you got something to
[1:20:33] say it in front of
[1:20:36] me unless of Of course, you're a
[1:20:40] coward. Cuz I will confront
[1:20:45] you. Hello. Don't pass out on me
[1:20:49] now. Huh? Hey, I am sent for now anyway
[1:20:55] as a shepherd to watch over this
[1:20:59] flock. So, I am more than willing to lay
[1:21:02] down in front of the
[1:21:04] gate and dare the devil.
[1:21:08] to try to come over me. Would you want
[1:21:10] any other kind of pastor? Would you want
[1:21:13] a pastor that say, "Oh, I'm so scared of
[1:21:16] the
[1:21:18] devil. I'm afraid the devil might get
[1:21:21] me. So, I'm going to come back to and
[1:21:22] hide with you all your sisters. I'm
[1:21:24] going to get among you." And your
[1:21:25] brothers, I'm going to get among you.
[1:21:26] Devil, please, devil, don't bother
[1:21:29] me. Is that the kind of man you want
[1:21:31] watching after your soul?
[1:21:35] I want a man that's wilder to stand
[1:21:36] there and
[1:21:39] go, "All right, devil. Come if you will,
[1:21:43] but I'm warning you. You'll leave
[1:21:44] without a nose, an ear, an eye, three
[1:21:48] toes on one side, five on the other.
[1:21:50] You'll go out of here dialing 911 if you
[1:21:53] got any fingers left. I'm warning you.
[1:21:55] We're not compromising here. We're
[1:21:57] called to protect these young people.
[1:22:00] We're called to lead them to the Holy
[1:22:01] Ghost. were called to preach the word.
[1:22:03] Yep. That's the kind of man I'd want to
[1:22:05] sit under if I wasn't a
[1:22:08] preacher. Let's stand together. We'll
[1:22:10] pick it up
[1:22:14] again. Praise the Lord. Can I read you
[1:22:18] just a couple more verses? You rest
[1:22:19] yourself there and we'll we'll change
[1:22:21] and go a little bit different direction
[1:22:22] next time. Let's jump down here to 1
[1:22:24] John chapter 4 verse one. Brothers.
[1:22:27] Beloved, believe not every spirit, but
[1:22:31] try the
[1:22:32] spirits, whether they are of God,
[1:22:34] because many false
[1:22:36] prophets are gone out into the world.
[1:22:39] Hereby we know, hereby know ye the
[1:22:42] spirit of God. Every spirit that
[1:22:44] confessth that Jesus
[1:22:48] Christ, not has
[1:22:50] come, but is come
[1:22:55] in the
[1:22:56] flesh is of
[1:22:58] God. Now remember this is first John. So
[1:23:01] this is written around 93 to 94 AD.
[1:23:08] So John is not referencing now back has
[1:23:11] come. He's already come. Almost every
[1:23:13] denomination believes that. But do they
[1:23:16] believe he
[1:23:17] is present tense
[1:23:20] come? That he is here now by the baptism
[1:23:23] of the Holy Ghost in his people hereby
[1:23:25] know the spirit of God. Every spirit
[1:23:27] that confessth that Jesus Christ and
[1:23:30] come in the flesh is of God. Every
[1:23:32] spirit that confessth not that Jesus
[1:23:34] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[1:23:38] God. And this is that spirit of
[1:23:40] Antichrist which you have heard that it
[1:23:43] should come. Even now
[1:23:47] already is it in the
[1:23:50] world. 93 AD and it was already
[1:23:55] here. How much greater is it now? Thank
[1:23:59] God for the truth.
[1:24:01] Let's bow our heads
[1:24:05] together. Heavenly Father, how we love
[1:24:08] you
[1:24:09] tonight. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful
[1:24:12] for the
[1:24:13] scriptures. We thank you for our
[1:24:16] Bibles. Lord, I I I'm so grateful that
[1:24:21] you allowed us to be able to have your
[1:24:24] word written down.
[1:24:27] We know in the days of Luther, it's no
[1:24:29] wonder that there was such darkness on
[1:24:31] the earth and why it was called the dark
[1:24:34] ages. But you made a way so that the
[1:24:37] printing press couldn't be invented. And
[1:24:40] Lord, whenever they started printing it
[1:24:43] and the Bible started being printed,
[1:24:45] they had to smuggle them in. They had to
[1:24:47] sneak them in every way by ships, by
[1:24:51] donkey carts, every way to get the word
[1:24:54] to the people. And what did it cause? A
[1:24:58] revival. The people were ignorant for
[1:25:01] years and
[1:25:03] years of what the Bible actually said.
[1:25:07] And you moved on Luther's
[1:25:10] heart to start translating it because
[1:25:13] the church didn't want him to have the
[1:25:15] Bible. And the church, the Catholic
[1:25:18] church I'm referring to, told them they
[1:25:20] couldn't understand it. No way. They
[1:25:21] didn't need to read it. But Martin
[1:25:24] Luther wanted to help get the Bible in
[1:25:26] the hands of the people. People like
[1:25:29] him, John Hus, John Wackliffe, many of
[1:25:33] those men. Oh, I can't wait to meet
[1:25:35] them,
[1:25:36] Lord. They labored day and night till
[1:25:39] their eyes would oh would hurt so bad
[1:25:43] because they were sitting there. They
[1:25:45] didn't have AI. They didn't have a
[1:25:47] printer, but they'd have to write each
[1:25:49] copy so they could get it among the
[1:25:52] believers. It caused a revival. Oh,
[1:25:56] Jesus. Here we are in this day. We've
[1:25:58] got it on our phones. We've got it on
[1:25:59] our iPads, our
[1:26:01] laptops. Shame on us, Lord. If we don't
[1:26:04] really read it and feed on it and
[1:26:07] appreciate it, Father, we love you
[1:26:09] tonight, Lord Jesus. I pray you'd bless
[1:26:12] these young people, Lord God. Keep them
[1:26:15] in your mercy and your grace. Father,
[1:26:18] thank you for this time we've had
[1:26:19] together. Bless him, Father. I pray in
[1:26:21] Jesus name.
[1:26:30] Amen. Because of who you are, I give you
[1:26:36] glory.
[1:26:41] Because of who you are, I give you
[1:26:49] praise. Because of who you
[1:26:54] are, I will lift my voice and say, Lord,
[1:27:00] I worship you because of who you are.
[1:27:08] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[1:27:17] are. Jehovah
[1:27:22] Gyra, my
[1:27:26] proider
[1:27:31] Jehovah. Lord, you reign in victory.
[1:27:37] Jehovah
[1:27:41] show my prince of
[1:27:45] peace. Lord I worship you because of who
[1:27:52] you are.
[1:27:56] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:05] are. Because of who you are, I give you
[1:28:13] glory.
[1:28:15] Oh, because of who you are, I give you
[1:28:20] praise.
[1:28:25] Because of who you
[1:28:29] are, I will lift my voice and say,
[1:28:34] "Lord, I worship you because of who you
[1:28:42] are." Lord, I worship you because of who
[1:28:48] you are. Sing it to him tonight.
[1:28:53] Jehovah
[1:28:56] Gyra, you're my
[1:29:01] proider. Jehovah
[1:29:06] n Lord, you reign in victory.
[1:29:11] Jehovah
[1:29:16] Shalom, my prince of
[1:29:20] peace and I worship you because of who
[1:29:26] you
[1:29:29] are, Lord. I worship you because of who
[1:29:35] you are. Sing it one more time.
[1:29:39] Jehovah
[1:29:43] Gyra my
[1:29:47] proider. Jehovah
[1:29:52] n Lord you reign in victory.
[1:29:58] Jehovah
[1:30:02] Shalom, my prince of
[1:30:06] peace, and I worship you because of who
[1:30:12] you
[1:30:15] are, Lord. I worship
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:23] you. Amen. Can we just give a hand for
[1:30:26] what we heard tonight? Just appreciate
[1:30:28] that brother Donnie musicians and told
[1:30:33] me to close. So close. Um I was just
[1:30:37] thinking about it and you know we're all
[1:30:39] wondering how many parts there's going
[1:30:41] to be and there's just so much to learn.
[1:30:43] There's so much to know and we
[1:30:44] appreciate every bit of it
[1:30:46] but you know you can only contain so
[1:30:49] much in your mind and you can only try
[1:30:51] to explain so much to someone else. But,
[1:30:55] you know, someone should just if you
[1:30:57] really want to tell someone about the
[1:30:58] message and what we believe, just say,
[1:31:00] "Look at me. It's working." You know, I
[1:31:03] heard a testimony. Brother Cadre Diggs
[1:31:07] said, um, he met with an atheist one
[1:31:09] time and the guy he doubted his
[1:31:12] testimony that Brother Cadre was healed
[1:31:14] from cancer and he said, "It's a
[1:31:16] complete miracle." And the guy said, "I
[1:31:17] want to see the scans. I want to see the
[1:31:19] doctor notes. I want to see it all." And
[1:31:20] he said,
[1:31:21] "Well, why would you want to see that if
[1:31:23] you can look at me? I got a scar right
[1:31:25] here. My eyes a little bit turned right
[1:31:27] here. My family can tell you that I had
[1:31:30] cancer, but I'm healed." And that's how
[1:31:33] it should be with us. We can just go up
[1:31:35] to someone and when they say, "Why do
[1:31:36] you believe what you believe?" I can
[1:31:38] say. I mean, maybe I can't say all the
[1:31:41] quotes and all the scriptures at that
[1:31:42] moment, but my life's been changed
[1:31:45] forever. I'm not the same. I'm not just
[1:31:47] going to church. I'm not just living a
[1:31:50] different life when I get home, but
[1:31:51] truly I've been changed. It's like we're
[1:31:54] saying, it's nothing that we can
[1:31:55] actually really do or study to learn to
[1:31:58] figure out how to be better, but just
[1:32:00] because of who he is and what he's done
[1:32:02] for us. So, let's just keep that in our
[1:32:04] hearts and let's pray.
[1:32:07] And Lord Jesus, we love you, Lord. And
[1:32:10] we're just so grateful for all that you
[1:32:11] do for us, Lord. And we're just so
[1:32:15] grateful for men of God, Lord, who can
[1:32:17] come and take the time and to to bring
[1:32:19] these quotes, these scriptures, Lord
[1:32:21] Jesus, to help us understand, Lord. And
[1:32:24] I appreciate that how Brother Donniey's
[1:32:27] been showing it to us, Lord. We can
[1:32:29] point to the Bible, Lord. That's that's
[1:32:30] our source, Lord. It's your word,
[1:32:32] Father. It's the truth. But Lord Jesus,
[1:32:35] above all, we want it to be our hearts
[1:32:36] that prove who you are, Lord. We want it
[1:32:39] to be our lives to prove that your
[1:32:40] ministry is still here. That you're the
[1:32:42] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:32:44] Lord. That you're still giving out the
[1:32:45] Holy Ghost, Father. That you can change
[1:32:47] any heart, Lord Jesus. So, Lord, may we
[1:32:50] yield to that. And maybe, Lord, one or
[1:32:53] some of us here might not have a life
[1:32:56] like that, Lord. And when we look at our
[1:32:58] own lives, we can just think that, well,
[1:33:01] I'm not really proven it. But, Father,
[1:33:04] you can change that, Lord, if we would
[1:33:05] just yield it to you. So we just trust
[1:33:08] in you in all things, Lord. May we ever
[1:33:10] step closer, Lord, to that perfect image
[1:33:12] that you have of us, Father. Trusting
[1:33:14] that you'll take us there all the way,
[1:33:15] Lord. We We can't do it ourselves, Lord.
[1:33:17] And we failed so many times, but Lord
[1:33:19] Jesus, we just yield to you, oh God.
[1:33:22] Move for us and your people around the
[1:33:24] world, Father. We trust you. We love
[1:33:26] you, Lord Jesus. We pray that you bless
[1:33:28] us, every single one, as we leave
[1:33:30] tonight. Just keep your mercies around
[1:33:32] us, Father. And may we just think of you
[1:33:34] and let these things dwell in our
[1:33:36] hearts, Lord. It's in Jesus Christ's
[1:33:37] name we pray.
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:43] Amen.
[1:33:45] Thanks.
[1:33:47] Thanks. I give you
[1:33:50] thanks for
[1:33:52] all
[1:33:54] you've
[1:33:58] done. I am so
[1:34:01] blessed. My soul has found rest. Oh
[1:34:07] Lord, I give you
[1:34:12] thanks. I give you thanks this
[1:34:15] moment and I will
[1:34:19] continually for each day I live. Your
[1:34:22] grace you give. I'm blessed
[1:34:26] abundantly. I can't forget the moment
[1:34:30] when in my life you made such a change.
[1:34:34] Cuz when the spirit came, I've not been
[1:34:37] the same. And I want to give you
[1:34:41] thanks.
[1:34:43] Thanks.
[1:34:45] Thanks. I give you
[1:34:48] thanks for
[1:34:50] all
[1:34:52] you
[1:34:55] come. Oh, I am so
[1:34:59] blessed. My soul has found rest.
[1:35:05] Oh, I give you
[1:35:08] thanks. Oh, you're always right beside
[1:35:13] me. You hear me every time I pray. Since
[1:35:18] I first began, you're my dearest friend.
[1:35:22] And I give you all the
[1:35:25] praise.
[1:35:26] Thanks.
[1:35:28] Thanks. I give you thanks.
[1:35:32] for
[1:35:33] all
[1:35:35] you've
[1:35:39] done. I am so
[1:35:42] blessed. My soul has found rest. Oh
[1:35:48] Lord, I give you
[1:35:52] thanks. Let's sing this song as we go.
[1:35:55] Just as you leave, you're
[1:35:58] dismissed. Can't you see?
[1:36:02] See
[1:36:04] why I'm so
[1:36:09] happy I've
[1:36:12] accepted the
[1:36:14] word of the Lord.
[1:36:21] The
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:23] revealed
[1:36:25] word that was
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:31] spoken by the
[1:36:34] prophet of
[1:36:37] Malachi 4.
[1:36:42] Oh, can't you
[1:36:46] see
[1:36:48] why I'm so
[1:36:53] happy I've accepted
