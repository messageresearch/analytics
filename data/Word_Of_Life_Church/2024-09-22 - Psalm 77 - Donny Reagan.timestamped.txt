[49:49] Lord Psalm 771
[49:57] to the chief
[50:00] musician to
[50:03] jusen a
[50:05] Psalm of
[50:07] ASF a Psalm of
[50:10] ASF I'm not sure if you're familiar
[50:12] whether or not but David wasn't the only
[50:15] one that actually contributed to the
[50:18] Book of Psalms there were some other men
[50:21] that did as well some of them were in
[50:24] charge of the music some of them
[50:26] actually
[50:27] wrote part of the Psalms this one is
[50:30] what is called a Psalm of
[50:33] ASF a Psalm of ASF I want you to listen
[50:37] to the words now
[50:39] carefully I
[50:42] Cried unto God with my
[50:45] voice even to God with my voice and he
[50:50] gave ear unto
[50:52] me in the day of my trouble I sought the
[50:55] Lord
[50:57] my SAR ran in the night and ceased
[51:02] not my soul
[51:05] refused to be
[51:08] comforted I remembered
[51:11] God and was
[51:13] troubled what a strange thing to
[51:16] say I remembered God and I was
[51:22] troubled I
[51:24] complained and my spirit
[51:27] was
[51:29] overwhelmed Sil
[51:31] La thou holdest mine eyes
[51:36] waking I am so
[51:39] troubled that I
[51:41] cannot
[51:43] speak I have considered the days of old
[51:48] the
[51:49] years of ancient
[51:52] times how may like to be remembered
[51:54] today as we pray
[51:57] we have several needs of course in our
[52:00] church and I'm sure that all of you are
[52:02] very familiar of them some very very
[52:04] serious and we want to keep our brothers
[52:06] and sisters before the Lord in prayer
[52:08] we'll pray over this prayer call for
[52:10] brother Steve Newsome today so I
[52:12] appreciate if you'd remember uh me for
[52:15] that as well let's let's pray
[52:19] together Lord Jesus we bow our heads to
[52:22] the dust of the Earth from whence we
[52:24] were taken and no one day we will return
[52:27] to that unless we're called away in a
[52:30] Rapture
[52:31] first father as we approach your word
[52:34] today we're asking for your help you saw
[52:38] the needs that were signified by the
[52:41] uplifting of hands all over this place
[52:43] today and we're just bringing them
[52:46] before you some might seem small some
[52:50] might seem totally
[52:52] impossible some might seem as if though
[52:54] there's no way for it to happen but we
[52:57] know our God Specializes in
[53:01] impossibilities so father we bring them
[53:03] all to you large mediumsized
[53:07] small dear God we're asking today for
[53:10] your help help me
[53:13] Jesus help me to be able to get out of
[53:16] the way
[53:18] father to speak the words that will be
[53:22] beneficial to your people
[53:24] today we commit the service and the word
[53:26] to you now father speaker and hearer in
[53:29] the name of the Lord
[53:31] Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless
[53:35] you you may be
[53:46] seated we don't know too much about
[53:50] Asaf we certainly don't know what he was
[53:54] dealing with
[53:56] what he was going through whenever he
[53:59] actually pinned these
[54:02] words but it must have been
[54:04] something so
[54:08] tremendous and it left
[54:10] him
[54:12] speechless it left him to where that he
[54:16] was
[54:17] so overwhelmed by the circumstance the
[54:22] events one or many that he was going
[54:25] through
[54:26] his sleep was being taken at
[54:30] night the thoughts of his mind were
[54:33] overwhelming him the surroundings that
[54:37] was near him the daytime the
[54:40] nighttime everything was
[54:44] interrupted and he does the only thing
[54:47] that he knows to do now being being a
[54:50] psalmist and a
[54:53] singer and a musician they live in a
[54:56] different world anyway they operate of
[54:59] course by inspiration the only true
[55:01] songs that can ever be written are by
[55:04] inspiration some people write songs and
[55:06] you can tell they wrote them but when
[55:08] God gives them to you it's different and
[55:11] then whenever you climb into that sphere
[55:13] and you get it from God and then you
[55:15] come back down it's not when you're up
[55:16] there when it's there it's awesome
[55:18] wonderful but it's when you come back
[55:20] down in the transitory time of coming
[55:23] from the high to the low and from the
[55:25] low to the high
[55:27] so ASF must have been that type of an
[55:30] individual that he knew what inspiration
[55:33] was and he knew what it was like to walk
[55:35] in the presence of God and to be blessed
[55:39] by God let's read verse one again if you
[55:42] don't mind to the chief musician now
[55:45] apparently this this brother had a a
[55:48] joint working together and we know that
[55:51] the Levites actually there were
[55:53] songwriters and singers and musicians
[55:56] and so on as part of the Levites the
[55:58] Levites also took care of the sacrifices
[56:01] they also bore the we of the Tabernacle
[56:03] and the temple several things that they
[56:05] did but some of them would be more
[56:07] songwriters some of them might write the
[56:09] songs and they may not be singers others
[56:12] might sing and they may not write there
[56:15] was probably some of them that were
[56:16] blessed to sing write and play music but
[56:20] ASA we don't really know to the extent
[56:23] of what that he did but ASA actually
[56:26] gave this to the chief musician so it
[56:30] was the musician that was in charge of
[56:33] the choir or the music and that day
[56:35] maybe he was the one who put the
[56:36] instruments together so ASAP received
[56:39] this no doubt from he felt like the Lord
[56:43] a Psalm of Asaf I Cried unto God with my
[56:47] voice even to God with my voice now the
[56:52] Hebrew mannerism whenever they would
[56:55] repeat something something twice and you
[56:57] notice the Lord Jesus did it often in
[56:59] the New Testament and he would say
[57:02] verily verily I say unto you well Jesus
[57:06] didn't stutter it wasn't that he had a
[57:08] stuttering problem but it was their
[57:10] mannerism whenever they would repeat the
[57:12] same thing twice there was a great
[57:15] significance in what they were about to
[57:17] say so Asaf wants to make it sure to the
[57:21] readers now remember this was a Psalm
[57:24] which was a song but we know they put it
[57:27] together and we identify it as scripture
[57:30] so he said I Cried unto God with my
[57:32] voice even to God with my voice and he
[57:36] gave ear unto me now he recognizes that
[57:41] the straight that he's in that he's went
[57:44] to God and he he says it to verify it
[57:46] that he Cried unto God and that God did
[57:49] hear him and then he says in verse two
[57:51] in the day of my trouble I sought the
[57:55] Lord
[57:57] and my SAR ran in the night in other
[58:00] words my troubles did not dissipate they
[58:03] did not lay back even when the night
[58:06] season would come and we know how that
[58:09] is sometimes when we get our sickest is
[58:12] in the nighttime fever's raging and we
[58:14] can't rest and just adds to what we're
[58:18] already going through seems like so he
[58:21] said my sore ran in the night whether it
[58:25] was a natural Affliction that he was
[58:27] describing or whether he was taking a
[58:29] parallel which many time these writers
[58:31] would do that they would use a
[58:33] parallelism which was they would take a
[58:36] natural thing and use them words to
[58:38] describe a spiritual thing we don't know
[58:41] but we just know that he wanted us to
[58:43] get the impact of it my S ran in the
[58:45] night and ceased not my S ran in the
[58:50] night and ceased not my soul refused
[58:56] to be comforted now watch we're getting
[58:59] into where the trouble is laying in the
[59:03] basis of this Psalm uh I'm I'm sure
[59:07] probably if you've been saved very long
[59:09] that most of us have been in a spot like
[59:12] this maybe never quite to the depths
[59:15] that Asaf was at but he was in a spot to
[59:19] where that people were coming around him
[59:22] and maybe even the presence of God and
[59:24] maybe he was remind Ed of a former Psalm
[59:28] say F Psalm 46 Psalm 33 Psalm 103 the
[59:33] blessings of the Lord whatever it was
[59:35] and yet there was something about the
[59:37] situation he was in he was in such deep
[59:41] despair that his soul refused
[59:46] Comfort I want you to think it wasn't
[59:49] that Comfort was not offered but he
[59:53] himself actually refused it
[59:56] anybody ever been there where people try
[59:58] to encourage you and most of the time
[1:00:02] when a child of God will do that it's
[1:00:05] not that they're trying to be mean it's
[1:00:07] not that they're trying to be
[1:00:09] indifferent but what they do is we let
[1:00:12] me say it this way we that we evaluate
[1:00:15] the comfort that they offered us and
[1:00:18] that it was so small in comparison to
[1:00:23] what we are going through
[1:00:26] and people will say well I know what
[1:00:27] you're going through and and we may not
[1:00:29] say it out loud but we will say it
[1:00:31] sometimes in our heart no you
[1:00:34] don't no you don't you don't know what
[1:00:36] I'm going through well I lost a a
[1:00:39] husband I lost a wife I lost a daughter
[1:00:42] but see the way we look at our own
[1:00:44] situation we consider ours so special
[1:00:48] and so unique not another human being on
[1:00:51] the Earth has ever been what we've been
[1:00:53] through and just remember when you're
[1:00:55] thinking that that's the devil right it
[1:00:58] is not the spirit of God because no
[1:01:01] matter what we go through many people
[1:01:04] have been before us and the Lord Jesus
[1:01:06] has went through more than us all put
[1:01:09] together but notice what a situation now
[1:01:13] that a person can be in so ASF says that
[1:01:17] that I rejected all those consolations
[1:01:21] were offered to me by my friends by my
[1:01:24] superiors by my my comrades my
[1:01:26] contemporaries and I remember this
[1:01:28] brother would have been a man of renown
[1:01:31] to be identified as one of the chief men
[1:01:35] you'll find his name several times in
[1:01:36] the Book of Psalms whenever this man
[1:01:39] would have come around and they was
[1:01:40] having singing conventions and they were
[1:01:43] practicing music this man would have
[1:01:45] been a man that the musicians and the
[1:01:48] singers and the orchestration guys all
[1:01:51] of them would have said wow wow there's
[1:01:53] brother as Hey Brother as how are you
[1:01:55] doing how you doing
[1:01:56] so he was not what we would say that
[1:01:58] nobody knew him so no doubt whatever it
[1:02:01] was he was going through the different
[1:02:03] ones had tried to encourage him and try
[1:02:05] to lift him up but he refused the
[1:02:10] Comforts as if though they were they
[1:02:12] were too weak for his case others maybe
[1:02:17] were untrue maybe others were without
[1:02:20] feeling you know you You' you've been
[1:02:23] there when people just try to well I
[1:02:24] know what you're going through and we
[1:02:26] all go through it and which is one of
[1:02:28] the worst things you can say by the
[1:02:32] way I've stood in many many funerals and
[1:02:36] stood at the head of the
[1:02:37] casket by the
[1:02:40] families and here are some of the things
[1:02:42] that people
[1:02:43] say and you think they've been better
[1:02:45] off they had even open their mouths just
[1:02:48] shake your hand and smile and go on and
[1:02:51] then you can watch the families as they
[1:02:54] say these feelings
[1:02:56] that words without feelings and and it's
[1:02:59] just like that it's you know nothing
[1:03:01] there and maybe ASA had received a few
[1:03:05] of those but the danger was not so much
[1:03:08] the Frailty or the failure of the people
[1:03:12] maybe they just didn't know what to say
[1:03:14] and in that time who does who
[1:03:17] does but his
[1:03:19] soul
[1:03:21] refused Comfort when we get to our
[1:03:25] friends
[1:03:26] we're in a serious
[1:03:28] situation maybe he considered them
[1:03:32] unhallowed they were not sacred enough
[1:03:35] for the declared situation to be able to
[1:03:39] use such frail words to en to encourage
[1:03:43] or comfort him with such
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:48] distress so he said I refused him people
[1:03:53] said we're sorry I hate you going
[1:03:56] through this I'm so
[1:03:59] sorry he said I wouldn't even hear
[1:04:02] them you know I found that God in his
[1:04:04] mercy no matter what we're going through
[1:04:07] God puts people in our lives and around
[1:04:11] us to help us but it doesn't do any good
[1:04:15] if we don't receive
[1:04:19] it as you know it won't be but a few
[1:04:22] weeks away
[1:04:26] that it will be a
[1:04:28] year on the 16th day of
[1:04:33] October that the Lord decided it was
[1:04:36] time
[1:04:37] for my little girl to come
[1:04:42] home and I don't mind telling you I
[1:04:45] don't know how we as a family would have
[1:04:48] been able to go through what we've been
[1:04:50] through with that if it hadn't been for
[1:04:53] you all my friends
[1:04:56] around the world I'm constantly getting
[1:04:58] things from people all over the
[1:05:02] world I don't know how we would have
[1:05:04] dealt with it without your prayers your
[1:05:08] emails your texts your cards but you
[1:05:11] know what no matter how much the Lord
[1:05:13] would have put it on your heart to say
[1:05:16] something to me or to Carol or to the
[1:05:18] girls or to Lance or to the Parker side
[1:05:20] of the family which loved her as if she
[1:05:22] was their own daughter it wouldn't do
[1:05:24] any good no matter how much you felt led
[1:05:26] to do it if we wouldn't receive it as
[1:05:30] from the Lord
[1:05:31] himself I believe God uses his
[1:05:36] children to be God and
[1:05:39] skin to be able to put their arms around
[1:05:42] us and help us but we have to receive
[1:05:46] it so whatever it was that Asaf was
[1:05:49] going through it must have been
[1:05:51] something very similar to what Jacob
[1:05:55] went through
[1:05:56] whenever the brothers come back and told
[1:05:59] him that Joseph had been killed and
[1:06:02] Genesis
[1:06:05] 37:35 and all of his sons and his
[1:06:07] daughters rose up to comfort him but he
[1:06:13] refused to be
[1:06:16] comforted and he said for I will go down
[1:06:19] unto the grave unto my son mourning thus
[1:06:23] his father wept for him him now he don't
[1:06:27] know it but he's
[1:06:29] actually doing all this for a lie right
[1:06:33] it wasn't even the truth and it's the
[1:06:36] same way when you and I go through
[1:06:37] things and the devil tells us that God
[1:06:39] don't love us and God don't care for us
[1:06:43] and if he loved you how would he let
[1:06:45] this happen and let that happen that is
[1:06:49] a lie and yet we will allow the devil to
[1:06:52] make us feel terrible and if we're not
[1:06:54] careful we'll get an attitude against
[1:06:57] the only one that can help us through
[1:06:59] those problems somebody say amen amen
[1:07:03] now what here Jacob no doubt it was
[1:07:05] absolutely
[1:07:07] overwhelming how he must have felt when
[1:07:09] his sons come he don't know they're
[1:07:11] lying to him and they tell him is not
[1:07:13] this your son's coat and we found it out
[1:07:15] there and they took a a blood of an
[1:07:17] animal and put it on there and you're
[1:07:19] this Prophet is being deceived by his
[1:07:23] lying Sons
[1:07:26] isn't it amazing and God lets him
[1:07:29] believe
[1:07:31] that is that right notice again in
[1:07:34] Jeremiah 31 a prophecy that would be
[1:07:37] fulfilled hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:07:40] later whenever Herod the king would
[1:07:43] actually send out a proclamation that
[1:07:46] all the newborn children males 2 years
[1:07:49] old and younger were going to be killed
[1:07:52] they're trying to kill the Messiah of
[1:07:54] course thus sayith the Lord a voice was
[1:07:56] heard in Rama
[1:07:59] lamentation and bitter weeping
[1:08:02] Rachel Rachel weeping for her children
[1:08:07] refused to be comforted for her children
[1:08:12] because they were not what a dangerous
[1:08:17] position that we as children of God can
[1:08:20] get to and I've seen it so many times as
[1:08:22] a pastor that when people will get low
[1:08:25] and they go to missing church and they
[1:08:26] go to pulling away from the body and I
[1:08:29] will call them the deacons will call
[1:08:31] them maybe you will call them because
[1:08:33] they're your friends oh everything's
[1:08:35] good we're fine you know but you can
[1:08:37] tell something's not right and they
[1:08:39] don't come to functions anymore they
[1:08:41] don't hang around if it's youth they
[1:08:43] don't hang around the youth and and come
[1:08:45] to youth meetings and you know what the
[1:08:46] devil's doing he's trying to isolate
[1:08:49] them away from the body amen and believe
[1:08:52] it or not no matter what we do and how
[1:08:54] much we we do nine times out of 10
[1:08:57] people who get in that frame of mind
[1:08:59] will always blame me or they will blame
[1:09:02] the deacons or they will blame the
[1:09:04] church I find that to be so amazing most
[1:09:08] of them will never take the blame where
[1:09:10] it should be which is on themsel they
[1:09:13] were the ones who pulled away from us
[1:09:16] they were the ones who isolated away
[1:09:19] from us but you understand what's going
[1:09:20] on in their mind the devil has got this
[1:09:23] whirlwind going on they don't understand
[1:09:26] where they are they don't understand why
[1:09:28] God's letting this go on in their life
[1:09:33] so Jacob was at that spot the children
[1:09:36] would not be restored back of course in
[1:09:38] the New Testament and Rachel in the
[1:09:41] symbol there Rachel was weeping and
[1:09:44] crying and would not be comforted notice
[1:09:48] as ASAP goes on in verse three I
[1:09:52] remembered God
[1:09:58] and was
[1:10:01] troubled why in the world would anybody
[1:10:04] remember
[1:10:06] God and be
[1:10:09] troubled what often
[1:10:12] occurs help me Lord
[1:10:16] God in the case of a good man or
[1:10:20] woman that by dwelling on this
[1:10:23] dark incomprehensible
[1:10:25] ible situation that they're going
[1:10:28] through and things that God allows to
[1:10:31] come to pass in their life the soul
[1:10:35] becomes so
[1:10:37] sad and so
[1:10:39] troubled to an extent of bordering on
[1:10:45] murmuring and
[1:10:47] complaining anybody ever been there
[1:10:49] besides me
[1:10:55] and
[1:10:58] Rebellion I remembered
[1:11:01] God and was
[1:11:04] troubled he who is the
[1:11:07] Wellspring of our
[1:11:09] being he who is that every blessing
[1:11:13] we've ever got our entire life he is the
[1:11:16] source of it all and yet we remembered
[1:11:21] God and we were troubled
[1:11:25] hope this don't sound unusual to you but
[1:11:28] for those of you that have prayed for
[1:11:30] God to do a certain thing and whether it
[1:11:32] was a a sickness or trouble that you
[1:11:35] were going through and God didn't answer
[1:11:38] it in the way that you saw and you felt
[1:11:41] a little disappointed sometimes a lot
[1:11:44] disappointed you don't have to raise
[1:11:46] your hand on this but if any of you
[1:11:47] that's ever been through such a thing
[1:11:50] and then somebody else will turn into
[1:11:53] testimony that they prayed about this
[1:11:55] and this and this and God did it for
[1:11:59] them and he didn't do it for
[1:12:02] you isn't that an unusual feeling that
[1:12:06] we feel when God does that anybody ever
[1:12:09] experienced that and you find yourself
[1:12:12] sitting there in church when someone
[1:12:14] reads that praise and say oh everybody
[1:12:17] around you that hasn't experienced that
[1:12:19] maybe and they're just praising the Lord
[1:12:21] and the brother or sister who turned in
[1:12:23] that testimony they're so happy and
[1:12:25] they're so grateful to God of what God
[1:12:28] did and you're sitting there with some
[1:12:31] mixed
[1:12:33] feeling and you're thinking God I thank
[1:12:35] you that you did that for
[1:12:38] them but why didn't you do that for
[1:12:42] me I believed you I loved you I asked
[1:12:45] you with all of my
[1:12:47] heart you told them
[1:12:50] yes and you told me no come on I mean
[1:12:54] knows what I'm talking about oh I see so
[1:12:59] there's some asfs and Asaf s's I guess
[1:13:03] that are here in the service today wow
[1:13:06] so this must be the
[1:13:08] reason why
[1:13:11] yesterday when I thought I was ready for
[1:13:14] today and the Lord totally turned me
[1:13:17] completely
[1:13:19] around and in a matter of 45 minutes or
[1:13:22] so he started opening up this Psalm to
[1:13:25] me to be honest with you this has never
[1:13:27] been one of my
[1:13:29] favorites how many's got favorites and
[1:13:31] then others you read them and they're
[1:13:32] God's word you know but somehow the Lord
[1:13:36] just opened this up I thought God
[1:13:37] there's got to be a reason there's got
[1:13:39] to be a reason oh Hallelujah maybe
[1:13:42] there's more than
[1:13:44] one now notice where he where he is in
[1:13:48] this and his his
[1:13:50] heart his heart is
[1:13:54] distracted so he
[1:13:56] says I thought of God I I remembered God
[1:14:00] and I was I was troubl you know memory
[1:14:03] is one of the the great things that God
[1:14:06] gives us it's a wonderful thing
[1:14:09] attribute of the spirit of course we
[1:14:12] know but we also know the
[1:14:15] memory can be so
[1:14:17] painful so
[1:14:21] hurtful things we've done wrong things
[1:14:24] where we fallen short of the glory of
[1:14:27] God things that we wish we could go
[1:14:30] back and redo and undo and
[1:14:35] erase isn't it amazing that one aspect
[1:14:38] of memory how
[1:14:41] joyful and yet how
[1:14:44] painful Carol and I was walking through
[1:14:47] troyers
[1:14:55] one day this
[1:14:59] week and those of you that know what it
[1:15:02] is it's a grocery store type thing but
[1:15:03] where they package their own foods and
[1:15:05] things like
[1:15:07] that and I got a buggy up in the front
[1:15:10] door and started down the right hand
[1:15:14] side and meandered our way through
[1:15:16] there and as I started getting close to
[1:15:19] this certain section
[1:15:26] all of a sudden I
[1:15:29] started having these
[1:15:34] flashbacks it was the bread
[1:15:39] section and they have
[1:15:41] a a bread there called a sourdough
[1:15:46] bread and all of a sudden as I walked
[1:15:49] through
[1:15:51] there I relift
[1:15:55] time and time
[1:15:57] again how many loaves we've purchased
[1:16:00] for
[1:16:02] Erica cuz she loved it and there was
[1:16:06] times when she was taking her chemo that
[1:16:07] she could already eat anything but she
[1:16:10] was able to eat the souro bread so
[1:16:14] sister Robin which worked there kept her
[1:16:17] supplied in
[1:16:19] it we didn't know but it was a big sale
[1:16:22] day and there's people in there
[1:16:23] everywhere
[1:16:25] and I
[1:16:29] tried to find a place where I could get
[1:16:35] away cuz tears is pouring out of my eyes
[1:16:37] and my wife is comforting me
[1:16:42] and you know it is people looking at you
[1:16:44] with your eyes all bloodshot and they
[1:16:46] think you've been on a drunk or
[1:16:49] whatever but what did it brother
[1:16:52] ter memory yes sir
[1:16:58] memory notice in verse four he said thou
[1:17:01] holdest mine eyes
[1:17:04] waking I see this is the
[1:17:08] danger literally thou keepest the
[1:17:11] watches of my eyes my grief is so great
[1:17:16] God I can't
[1:17:19] sleep I'm
[1:17:20] troubled I can't
[1:17:23] sleep notice and he says I cannot
[1:17:28] speak now think of who this is saying
[1:17:31] this a
[1:17:33] singer a
[1:17:35] songwriter a man that was identified in
[1:17:38] one of the special categories of the
[1:17:41] children of Israel a
[1:17:45] psalmist a
[1:17:47] psalmist a man that was used by God for
[1:17:52] what words words right this defined this
[1:17:57] man's life the
[1:18:00] usage of
[1:18:04] words but brother Robbie no longer
[1:18:07] knew what to
[1:18:11] say you
[1:18:13] imagine how he must have
[1:18:16] felt that holdest mine eyes waking I'm
[1:18:19] troubled that I cannot
[1:18:21] speak his Spirit was so Sun with
[1:18:25] weariness and
[1:18:27] heaviness anybody ever be broke in your
[1:18:30] spirit I'll tell you I went through it
[1:18:32] several times in my life friends as a
[1:18:34] minister where you get under such a load
[1:18:36] for people either because the church
[1:18:39] body's going through so much and let me
[1:18:41] tell you something I may not see you all
[1:18:44] every day of the week Carol and I may
[1:18:47] not be able to shake every one of your
[1:18:48] hands every time we have church but you
[1:18:51] are constantly on our hearts when you're
[1:18:54] going through through anxiety and
[1:18:55] troubles in your life we bear those
[1:18:59] burdens right with you because God has
[1:19:01] given us a shepherd and a shepherd's
[1:19:05] wife we have you on our
[1:19:08] hearts and let me tell you something she
[1:19:11] may be a silent partner in this work but
[1:19:14] she is a great one I thank God for my
[1:19:17] wife
[1:19:25] for the last week or so been waking up 2
[1:19:27] or 3:00 in the morning not able to go
[1:19:30] back to sleep because so many people
[1:19:33] going through this and that and the
[1:19:36] other so we know what that's like do we
[1:19:39] not to lose sleep and whenever we go
[1:19:42] through that then of course the devil
[1:19:44] loves to talk to us in those we hours of
[1:19:47] the morning does he know you see Asaf is
[1:19:51] so shut up within himself it's as if
[1:19:54] though the Fountain of the flow of words
[1:19:58] by divine inspiration were not even
[1:20:01] there look in verse five he says I have
[1:20:04] considered the days of
[1:20:08] old the years of ancient
[1:20:12] times I called to
[1:20:15] remembrance as he's remembering of
[1:20:17] course the good
[1:20:19] times oh boy man I remember how it used
[1:20:24] to be
[1:20:26] I had this walk with God I was this and
[1:20:29] that my I remember the trials used to
[1:20:32] wasn't so bad I many remember those days
[1:20:36] I'm trying
[1:20:38] to I'm trying to but remember better
[1:20:42] days are ahead of
[1:20:45] us I've considered the days of oh so his
[1:20:48] mind is going back the years of ancient
[1:20:51] times and I call to remembrance my
[1:20:56] song in the night why is he remembering
[1:20:59] it because in this state of his
[1:21:03] life it's like he can't get a
[1:21:12] song he can't even
[1:21:17] harm among all the pains and
[1:21:21] Pleasures which make up a part of the
[1:21:23] human life lought in
[1:21:27] life this is one of the most painful the
[1:21:31] more real the more
[1:21:34] Vivid the
[1:21:35] pain and
[1:21:38] pleasures of
[1:21:41] memory every one of you are sitting here
[1:21:44] today and you have
[1:21:46] both isn't it amazing how extreme they
[1:21:49] can be and how
[1:21:51] contrasting they can be one from the
[1:21:53] other the pain
[1:21:55] and the
[1:21:57] pleasure of
[1:22:01] memories so Asaf remembered the ancient
[1:22:05] times the former
[1:22:08] days he goes back and he said I called
[1:22:13] to remembrance my song in the
[1:22:17] night Lord
[1:22:19] God my song in the night which had been
[1:22:24] an occas
[1:22:25] by which he could praise the Lord he
[1:22:28] could lay down at night thank you Lord
[1:22:31] for the day thank you for your blessings
[1:22:33] thank you for peace thank you for water
[1:22:36] thank you for food thank you for this
[1:22:38] and all my just had such joy and he
[1:22:41] couldn't not even sleep maybe for a
[1:22:43] while he just reach over and had a pad
[1:22:46] maybe and a pencil as we'd say in this
[1:22:47] day and he' ride over there there it
[1:22:49] right there was another song and that
[1:22:51] was oh my my what great songs of victory
[1:22:56] but now
[1:22:58] ASF is singing a different
[1:23:03] song but I'm so glad God anointed
[1:23:08] ASF to write Psalm
[1:23:13] 77 as sure as I'm a servant of
[1:23:16] God this is sent not only for Word of
[1:23:19] Life
[1:23:20] Church but it's sent for others around
[1:23:24] the world world Amen I've never even
[1:23:26] preached on Psalm 77 before in my
[1:23:29] life the Lord God no doubt had this
[1:23:32] written for people down to the ages but
[1:23:35] it's spoken today for somebody right
[1:23:37] here in this
[1:23:38] audience listen to him children you know
[1:23:41] me I'm a dummy but our God is absolutely
[1:23:45] perfect oh my I called to
[1:23:49] remembrance my song in the night I
[1:23:52] commune with my own heart heart and my
[1:23:56] spirit made diligent search I'm looking
[1:24:00] I'm trying to find have I done something
[1:24:02] wrong if I miss the Lord
[1:24:04] somehow why am I going through this
[1:24:08] time that's a wise thing to do is it not
[1:24:12] there's nothing wrong with that the
[1:24:13] matter of fact the prophet tells us that
[1:24:15] that he himself would go through those
[1:24:17] times and he would turn every stone over
[1:24:19] in his life and find out God is say
[1:24:22] something I've done wrong he would ask
[1:24:25] God and if there was something done
[1:24:27] wrong he'd fix it and he said then you
[1:24:30] turn every stone in your life and it
[1:24:32] seemed like God still don't
[1:24:35] answer and he said that's the time to be
[1:24:38] certain of
[1:24:42] god
[1:24:45] notice in Psalm 42 verse
[1:24:48] 8 now he could refer to this
[1:24:51] Psalm yet the Lord will command it
[1:24:54] loving kindness in the
[1:24:56] daytime and in the night his
[1:24:59] song shall be with me Hallelujah now you
[1:25:03] better believe the devil knows God's
[1:25:06] word this is a promise of God this one
[1:25:10] was written by King
[1:25:13] David you imagine the devil saying to
[1:25:16] Asaf so if you are such a chosen vessel
[1:25:19] of God how come your song ain't in the
[1:25:23] night
[1:25:25] he ever use the word against you of
[1:25:27] course he will of course he will yet the
[1:25:30] Lord will command his loving kindness in
[1:25:31] the day time and in the night his song
[1:25:34] shall be with me and my prayer unto the
[1:25:37] god of my
[1:25:39] life but ASF said I ain't got no
[1:25:44] song don't seem like I've got nothing to
[1:25:47] be happy
[1:25:49] about notice in verse seven will the
[1:25:53] Lord last off
[1:25:56] forever will he be favorable no more now
[1:26:02] watch in this part of the psalm he moves
[1:26:05] into the
[1:26:08] Avenue of
[1:26:10] unanswered
[1:26:14] questions and watch him he has one after
[1:26:20] another after
[1:26:22] another amen will the Lord cast off
[1:26:26] forever and will he be favorable no more
[1:26:30] if I lost favor in his sight will the
[1:26:33] Lord cast me off
[1:26:35] forever is his Mercy clean
[1:26:40] Gone
[1:26:41] Forever does his promise fail forever
[1:26:45] more look at him brother Daryl one
[1:26:47] question after another after another
[1:26:50] after
[1:26:52] another and no one
[1:26:56] answers it's a question and answer
[1:26:59] series between ASAP and
[1:27:02] God and ASA is is submitting the
[1:27:06] questions to
[1:27:07] God but God does not
[1:27:14] answer is this Mercy clean Gone Forever
[1:27:18] does his promise fail forever more has
[1:27:21] God
[1:27:22] forgotten wow to be
[1:27:25] gracious now remember this is a singer a
[1:27:28] songwriter a musician who stood under
[1:27:31] the anointing of God rubed shoulders
[1:27:34] with King
[1:27:36] David one of the most shouting dancing
[1:27:38] men of the Old
[1:27:40] Testament but I guarantee you ASF saw
[1:27:43] David in those low times as
[1:27:48] well how low this must have been for a
[1:27:51] guy that we'll call him the service Le
[1:27:54] leader so when the children of Israel
[1:27:57] would come on the days of the Feast of
[1:27:59] trumpets and the Feast of atonement and
[1:28:01] Y Kor and all these great feasts it was
[1:28:04] brother Asaf and he would get up there
[1:28:06] and they'd strike up the orchestra and
[1:28:08] they would start singing and oh my
[1:28:10] they'd worship God and worship
[1:28:13] God now Asaf is in this place brother
[1:28:16] Asaf would you lead us in a song
[1:28:18] Brothers
[1:28:19] I I just don't think I can do it today
[1:28:24] y'all pray for
[1:28:26] me you imagine the congregation saying
[1:28:29] what is brother ASF going
[1:28:32] through we can tell something's
[1:28:34] bothering
[1:28:36] him has God forgotten to be
[1:28:39] gracious has he in
[1:28:42] Anger shut up his Tender
[1:28:46] Mercies now look at the the degree of
[1:28:49] angle by which he
[1:28:51] approaches and he's asking God all these
[1:28:54] different things wh what is this friend
[1:28:56] is this an unbeliever is this an
[1:28:59] Infidel this is a person that
[1:29:02] God is being silent to
[1:29:07] them and they don't know what to
[1:29:11] do in reality this is one of the most
[1:29:15] pitiful helpless human beings you'll
[1:29:19] ever run
[1:29:22] across they have known the mercy of God
[1:29:25] they've known the grace of God they have
[1:29:27] my they have been so blessed in the
[1:29:30] Heavenly places in
[1:29:32] Christ but when they get down they get
[1:29:39] down oh
[1:29:42] my and I
[1:29:44] said this is my
[1:29:48] infirmity something must have
[1:29:53] happened this is my
[1:29:55] infirmity but I will
[1:29:59] remember the
[1:30:01] years of the right
[1:30:03] hand of the most high
[1:30:07] amen now I guess the question is for you
[1:30:10] and I
[1:30:12] today what will we
[1:30:15] make verse 10
[1:30:18] say in our
[1:30:21] story now I've read to you these n
[1:30:24] verses and we go in to the the drama of
[1:30:28] his life and the loness of his
[1:30:31] battle now something happens apparently
[1:30:34] between verse 9 and verse
[1:30:36] 10 did he see lightning hear thunder did
[1:30:39] he see a flash of light or was there
[1:30:42] just a germ of life on the inside of his
[1:30:44] soul and the spirit of God simply Struck
[1:30:47] it and he said Hallelujah this is my
[1:30:51] infirmity but I will remember the
[1:30:55] years listen the
[1:30:59] years of the right hand of the most high
[1:31:03] amen now we see a person in verse 10 who
[1:31:07] is somehow brother Daryl by the grace of
[1:31:10] God been able to rise above verses
[1:31:14] 1-9 and realize God has been so good to
[1:31:19] me if God never answers another prayer
[1:31:23] if God never heals my body another time
[1:31:27] if God never even looks my way once more
[1:31:30] if the Lord never does one more good
[1:31:33] thing for me the rest of my life I want
[1:31:36] to tell you today as a 68 year old man
[1:31:40] who's been serving Jesus and preaching
[1:31:42] for 50 years and living for him since I
[1:31:45] was 12 years old he has been so good to
[1:31:49] me he has healed me when I'm sick he's
[1:31:52] Lifted Me Up When I was down he has
[1:31:55] given me friends around the world he's
[1:31:58] helped me when I did not deserve it he's
[1:32:01] been good to me when I did not deserve
[1:32:04] it he's Lifted Me Up When it seemed like
[1:32:07] there was no way out oh I wish somebody
[1:32:10] would preach with me this morning now
[1:32:12] let's leave verse 9 and get up to verse
[1:32:15] 10 and let us realize God has been good
[1:32:19] to us all no matter what we're going
[1:32:22] through today and you may have heard
[1:32:24] devastating news but you don't want to
[1:32:27] wallow in just verse one and two and
[1:32:31] three and four and so on to verse n but
[1:32:35] you want to rise by faith and say but I
[1:32:39] remember when I was lost I remember when
[1:32:43] I was out there in the world and Jesus
[1:32:46] found me I remember I was in darkness I
[1:32:50] remember the years of blessings on my
[1:33:04] life and I
[1:33:11] said this is what's important about this
[1:33:14] verse it was not the levitical choir
[1:33:18] standing behind
[1:33:19] him maybe by now even King David had
[1:33:22] heard that his main Psalm writer next to
[1:33:28] him was going through such a
[1:33:31] dilemma and David said he'll help your
[1:33:34] brother
[1:33:35] ASF maybe jedu and and the other
[1:33:38] ministers and the Ministers of music and
[1:33:40] they all came to him but it wouldn't do
[1:33:42] any good until ASF made this his
[1:33:49] confession I'm the Lord God that Health
[1:33:52] the
[1:33:54] Hallelujah I'll never leave thee I'll
[1:33:57] never forsake thee I'll go with thee all
[1:33:59] the way to the end of the
[1:34:02] world and I said this is my infirmity
[1:34:06] but I will remember the
[1:34:09] years of the right hand of the most high
[1:34:11] now you know symbolism of course of the
[1:34:13] Old Testament of the right hand God said
[1:34:15] that by his right hand and by his right
[1:34:17] arm that he brought salvation the right
[1:34:20] arm is a symbolism of power he did not
[1:34:23] live under the influence of the left
[1:34:26] hand but he lived under the influence of
[1:34:29] the right hand for years Oh Glory I will
[1:34:34] remember the works of the Lord surely I
[1:34:38] will
[1:34:39] remember thy wonders of all what's going
[1:34:43] on with him Harry something now from
[1:34:46] within his Spirit remember memory is an
[1:34:49] attribute in your spirit and Satan has
[1:34:52] access to it just like God does but keep
[1:34:55] this in mind it will depend upon which
[1:34:58] one of those memories that we will focus
[1:35:01] on come on somebody oh I don't mind
[1:35:04] telling you I've got a lot of memories
[1:35:06] about a lot of things in life just like
[1:35:08] you do but you know what Carol and I was
[1:35:10] talking before we come to church and was
[1:35:12] talking about erican coming up on the
[1:35:15] oneye anniversary and all of that and I
[1:35:17] said but you know what honey I said God
[1:35:20] in his Mercy allowed us he blessed her
[1:35:23] us rather by allowing her to be a part
[1:35:26] of our family God blessed you sister
[1:35:29] Linda and allowed you to be married to
[1:35:31] brother Jimmy God blessed you sister
[1:35:33] Judy and let you be married oh
[1:35:36] Hallelujah to your husband God bless you
[1:35:39] mothers and fathers and whatever more
[1:35:41] that lost a son or a daughter and God
[1:35:44] blessed you to let it be part of your
[1:35:46] union if you look around today you've
[1:35:49] got a whole lot more to praise him for
[1:35:52] oh I know you may be setting here with
[1:35:54] pain and sorrow and you're going through
[1:35:56] a lot of things in life but don't just
[1:35:58] count verse one verse two verse three
[1:36:01] down through verses nine I think it's
[1:36:04] time for some of you at Word of Life to
[1:36:06] move into verse 10 of your life and say
[1:36:10] yes I think of my sister yes I think of
[1:36:14] my brother my father but God let me
[1:36:16] enjoy all these years with her and God
[1:36:20] let me enjoy all these years with my
[1:36:22] husband and the good thing about it is
[1:36:25] soon and very soon we're going to meet
[1:36:27] them all again and we will never part
[1:36:31] again I refuse to let the devil dominate
[1:36:35] my life I've got this big old hole in my
[1:36:38] heart no doubt it will never be totally
[1:36:41] completely filled but I've still got a
[1:36:44] church to Pastor I've got sermons to
[1:36:47] preach I've got sick to pray for come on
[1:36:49] children let's have
[1:36:51] church I've got people to encourage I've
[1:36:54] got to work before me I refuse to let
[1:36:58] the devil rob me of the rest of my life
[1:37:02] I'm not going to sit around and be sad
[1:37:05] and depressed I have no time for
[1:37:09] depression I have no time to be down and
[1:37:13] out I've called of God to walk in
[1:37:16] Heavenly places
[1:37:24] say so brother I will remember the works
[1:37:28] of the Lord surely I will remember thy
[1:37:33] wonders of
[1:37:35] all I will meditate
[1:37:40] also of all thy Work and
[1:37:45] talk and
[1:37:48] talk so you're going to meditate you're
[1:37:51] going to sink on it and then you're
[1:37:53] going to talk about it don't you
[1:37:56] understand the devil does exactly the
[1:37:57] same thing he'll get you and I to think
[1:38:00] about the downside the bad side the low
[1:38:02] side the painful side all that sort of
[1:38:05] thing and then what do we do most of us
[1:38:06] don't keep it to oursel but we talk
[1:38:08] about it well I don't understand why God
[1:38:10] let this happen I don't understand
[1:38:12] you're doing exactly what the devil
[1:38:14] wants you to do but oh Asaf must have
[1:38:17] got a new song hallelujah oh he said I
[1:38:20] will meditate on the good things of God
[1:38:24] I'm going to think about the days of old
[1:38:27] I'm going to remember the right hand
[1:38:28] blessing as a matter of fact I think I'm
[1:38:31] going back under it right now I'm I'm
[1:38:33] getting under that right hand blessing
[1:38:35] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[1:38:38] come on children somebody say Amen you
[1:38:40] imagine him saying praise the Lord I may
[1:38:43] not feel no better I may not shout the
[1:38:46] first time I go back to church but I'm
[1:38:48] still a Son of God I'm an heir of
[1:38:51] eternal life he loves me and spite of
[1:38:53] what the devil said he's on my side he's
[1:38:57] for me and if God be for us who can be
[1:39:00] against
[1:39:08] us I will meditate also of all thy Work
[1:39:12] all thy Work and

[1:41:48] I

[1:44:33] God the water
[1:44:36] salty and they were
[1:44:39] afraid the depths also were
[1:44:44] troubled imagine
[1:44:46] Jesus could have quoted this scripture
[1:44:49] after the boat
[1:44:51] ride on the sea of G gilee when he was
[1:44:53] there that night and when it was such a
[1:44:55] tumult wouldn't you and he stepped to
[1:44:58] the bow of the ship and said peace be

[1:45:04] and said this day this scripture is
[1:45:08] fulfilled well let me tell you something
[1:45:10] he's still a seaw walker he's still a
[1:45:13] water calmer he still can take oh

[1:46:11] water saw thee oh God the water saw
[1:46:15] thee they were afraid the depths also
[1:46:19] were troubled the clouds poured out
[1:46:22] water
[1:46:23] the skies sent out a sound thine arrows
[1:46:28] also went abroad the voice of thy
[1:46:30] Thunder was in the heaven the Lightnings
[1:46:32] lightened the world the Earth
[1:46:36] trembled and
[1:46:38] shook thy
[1:46:41] way is in the
[1:46:47] sea and thy
[1:46:50] pass in the Great Waters
[1:46:55] maybe some of you are there
[1:46:57] today and you're wondering why in the
[1:47:00] world am I am where I
[1:47:03] am maybe his path for you and this
[1:47:06] season is in the
[1:47:09] waters and in the
[1:47:12] sea but remember our God is still a sea
[1:47:15] walking God
[1:47:19] Amen and I know we talk about Peter
[1:47:23] we talk about him failing and he
[1:47:27] did but I don't want you to leave Peter
[1:47:31] in the
[1:47:32] water him and Jesus was a ways from the
[1:47:35] boat how far we don't know come on now
[1:47:38] but Jesus reached down and picked him
[1:47:40] back
[1:47:41] up Peter still had to walk back to the
[1:47:47] boat W Glory
[1:47:54] maybe you failed in a miracle let God
[1:47:59] complete your way back to the boat for
[1:48:03] you let him reach down and pick you back
[1:48:06] up and say come on boy let's walk back
[1:48:09] to the water you imagine Jesus and Peter
[1:48:11] walking back to the water I fell but I
[1:48:14] got back up again I fell short of the
[1:48:17] glory of God but he reached down and
[1:48:20] picked me up how many can say Amen to
[1:48:22] that
[1:48:26] today hallah thy way is in the sea and
[1:48:29] thy paths and the Great Waters and thy
[1:48:33] footsteps are not known
[1:48:35] Hallelujah thou lettest thy
[1:48:38] people like a
[1:48:41] flock by the hand of
[1:48:44] Moses and
[1:48:46] Aaron a
[1:48:48] PSAL of as
[1:48:54] like many of our songs they can start
[1:48:56] out pretty sad but the ending can be
[1:49:02] tremendous yes sir maybe the song of
[1:49:04] your life today you're in that chorus
[1:49:07] that place of the music the prophet told
[1:49:10] us that the great story of God is like a
[1:49:14] Divine
[1:49:17] Symphony the symphony written by these
[1:49:20] people who write them somehow they hear
[1:49:23] all this in their head which is always a
[1:49:25] Marvel to me how they can do it and they
[1:49:27] will have the flute and the OBO and the
[1:49:29] first vile in and and then the cello and
[1:49:32] you know the base and and all these
[1:49:34] things and they can hear all this going
[1:49:35] on in their
[1:49:37] heads so in the Garden of Eden the
[1:49:41] father allowed the symphony to start
[1:49:44] playing
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:09] and the devil come in Devil and they saw
[1:50:12] uhhuh I destroyed it
[1:50:15] all so the father come on the other side
[1:50:18] of the Garden of Eden and started saying
[1:50:32] down through time he's felt like he's
[1:50:34] destroyed on the cross he felt like he
[1:50:36] got the sheet music and annihilated it
[1:50:40] all but then he he's a knock on the door
[1:50:43] of
[1:50:48] hell and there stands the mro himself
[1:50:51] and when the devil opened the door he
[1:50:57] [Applause]
[1:51:03] went you thought when Jesus went away
[1:51:05] that was the end of the church they
[1:51:07] fussing fighting arguing debating Ain't
[1:51:10] No Way in the world they'll ever get
[1:51:12] together but on the day of Pentecost
[1:51:15] here come the Great Master right what
[1:51:18] did he do
[1:51:25] and what did they do started speaking in
[1:51:27] tongues wo glory to God what was it the
[1:51:31] language of the master he saw down
[1:51:34] through seven Church ages he had
[1:51:35] annihilated the church in the days of
[1:51:37] Luther in the days of West and the days
[1:51:39] of
[1:51:40] Pentecost come on now but he sent
[1:51:43] another message on the earth in the last
[1:51:45] days and the devil said now what's he
[1:51:46] going to do with
[1:51:48] this so the master walked to the pull
[1:51:51] pit and said
[1:51:55] and what did we start
[1:52:05] doing and what are we waiting for the
[1:52:09] great mro
[1:52:11] himself when some morning between 7 and
[1:52:15] 9 we feel a sweep go over
[1:52:19] us Lord God
[1:52:23] and we'll see our mothers our children
[1:52:25] our fathers standing around us and we
[1:52:28] know won't be long we're going to be
[1:52:30] changed what's he doing everybody's
[1:52:33] taking their chair in the
[1:52:35] orchestra so we're all getting together

[2:00:45] lifter of my

[2:01:48] you're the glory and the lifter
[2:01:52] of
[2:01:57] my
[2:01:59] hallelujah
[2:02:01] hallelujah you know Saints I
[2:02:06] remember even though it's
[2:02:09] been 29
[2:02:12] years just the other day
[2:02:15] I drove across the railroad
[2:02:19] track and I was back there again
[2:02:23] again and I started
[2:02:25] weeping because it was so
[2:02:28] real but you know one thing I found in
[2:02:31] the troubles that we have went through
[2:02:33] in our lives is that in our darkest
[2:02:35] times that's when God always showed up
[2:02:37] the
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:39] greatest and sometimes you wonder you
[2:02:42] say why is this Affliction of this back
[2:02:44] trouble or whatever it would
[2:02:46] be but I wonder sometimes if we don't
[2:02:49] endure those things so we can have
[2:02:50] compassion on someone else who's going
[2:02:52] through
[2:02:53] that because when you can't get out of
[2:02:56] bed in the morning or you lay your head
[2:02:58] on the steering wheel and cry because
[2:03:00] you can't really get out of the car to
[2:03:01] pump
[2:03:02] gas and was so comes up and says I've
[2:03:05] got my back you can understand it
[2:03:06] because you've been
[2:03:08] there amen the greatest thing we can
[2:03:11] ever do for one another is have
[2:03:13] compassion for one
[2:03:16] another as the soldier boy was trying to
[2:03:19] carry the man off the battlefield he
[2:03:20] said sorry g ain't
[2:03:22] Heavy He's My
