TRANSCRIPT
========================================
revelation 20 and sex bus and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so the Saints will resurrect in glorified bodies and share the kingdom with the king according to what you have done with what God's given you and life will be the delegated authority given to you in the Millennium now remember it's not just about what God does it all and I'll just kind of set around one of my sons and no no no no you see those things you and I can do with what God gives us God gives you a gift what do you do with that gift God gives you an ability God puts money in your hands God puts different things in your hand and your reward now remember the saints of God will not be judged before the white throne judgment we go before there the seat of Christ but it's only for rewards you're going to be standing before him according to what according to what you've done what's what God put in your hands well I got nothing you've got time you've got your life you've got your minds you've got your wheel you've got all of that and God will make a sense of how reward is determined according to what we do with what God puts in our hands oh all better Donnie I'm not sure I believe that well Matthew chapter 19 verse 28 jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration of the Son of Man will sit in the throne of the glory he shall also set with me upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel now these of course are apostolic judges will everybody get that nope Matthew chapter 25 verse 21 his Lord said unto Him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord now here we're not telling our preachers you ever tell my lay folks God puts things in our hands abilities influence gifts talents so on and so on your reward will be according to what you do with them now some people want to do the minimum requirement what do I have to do just to barely make it in I don't have people I can't even say they love God anybody that don't want to give him their all that's all he's done for us I don't understand it I got to be honest I just don't understand some folks it's like they're afraid they'll do too much really you're gonna do too much for God you're going to pray too much read your Bible too much give up too much there ain't no way
