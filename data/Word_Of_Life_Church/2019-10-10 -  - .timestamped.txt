[26:51] Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates
[26:54] thereof are burned with fire come let us
[26:58] build up the wall of jerusalem that wiii
[27:00] be no more a reproach verse 18 then i
[27:05] told them at the of the hand of my lord
[27:08] which was good upon me and also the
[27:10] king's words that he had spoken unto me
[27:12] and they said let us rise up and build
[27:14] so they strengthened their hands for
[27:17] this good work they heard the word and
[27:20] they began to do something about what
[27:23] they heard
[27:24] they didn't wait for the man of God to
[27:26] do all the work since they strengthened
[27:30] their hands for this good work
[27:32] revelations 12 and 11 and they overcame
[27:35] him by the blood of the Lamb and by the
[27:37] word of their testimony and they loved
[27:39] not their lives unto death let us bow
[27:42] our hearts and heads to him Heavenly
[27:44] Father we counted an honor a privilege
[27:48] to stand before your purchased people
[27:51] and I'm reminded now and hear the
[27:53] prophet speak and say that if he had a
[27:55] charger of the literal blood of Jesus
[27:58] Christ the purchase of that blood has
[28:01] more value than the blood itself so lord
[28:05] I stand humble I stand quiet and Lord
[28:09] that's how I come before you today
[28:10] that's how I come before the people of
[28:12] God and I saw hundreds of hands lifted
[28:14] up this morning saying that there were
[28:16] needs and there would be no way that I
[28:18] could speak and meet or do anything
[28:20] about them other than you would come and
[28:22] speak the words of life unto us O God
[28:25] may you be the encourage or may you be
[28:28] the uplifter today O God we find
[28:30] ourselves here in your presence and we
[28:33] simply want to submit ourselves and get
[28:35] out of the way father not just me as the
[28:38] minister but as the people as well may
[28:40] they set themselves a sighs maybe the
[28:42] pressures maybe they got a call this
[28:44] morning and it's disturbed them it's
[28:46] rattled them it's left them unsettled
[28:47] and they're not certain what they're
[28:48] going to do but the one who can do is on
[28:51] the scene so may you have the
[28:54] preeminence in your place rightfully in
[28:56] this service and it's in Jesus Christ's
[28:57] name we pray amen you may have your
[28:59] seats I always find inspiration from
[29:05] this when I'm ministering the Prophet
[29:08] says and by the way I forgot my I've
[29:11] lost them somewhere I don't know where
[29:12] they are my my reading glasses and you
[29:15] would think with having two pair of
[29:16] contacts I'd be able to see but I'm past
[29:18] forty hey man hey man I wonder
[29:23] oftentimes what the people when I was
[29:25] growing up wearing glasses they call you
[29:27] four-eyes and I wonder what they call me
[29:29] now that have eight
[29:35] but in the message here you him way back
[29:37] in 1956 way back in 1956 that were still
[29:42] truth that's what people out on the
[29:45] internet don't I know y'all don't
[29:46] believe that stuff but he says we must
[29:49] be inspired by the Word of God that will
[29:51] bring Christ to his word we must be
[29:54] inspired so you come today and you have
[29:58] to be inspired by the Word of God and
[30:00] that inspiration of that word will bring
[30:03] Christ to his word so if you're not
[30:06] inspired today Christ is not coming to
[30:09] you you take it up with the Prophet and
[30:13] back in 1956 but we must be inspired by
[30:17] the Word of God that will bring Christ
[30:19] to his word and blend them together so
[30:24] you have a part to play in the service
[30:26] today whatever you get out of this
[30:27] service is up to you because he's
[30:30] waiting on you to be inspired and quite
[30:35] frankly I don't know of any other way to
[30:36] preach but under inspiration so I
[30:40] believe that he's gonna come to me
[30:42] because I'm inspired by the word and he
[30:44] will come to you if you become inspired
[30:46] by the word we must be inspired by the
[30:48] Word of God that will bring Christ
[30:50] that's powerful inspiration is what
[30:53] brings him to his word but I thought his
[30:57] words were life his words are life but
[30:59] there has to be some inspiration and
[31:03] then blend them together and make it
[31:06] speak and act just like it did in the
[31:10] days of old did you catch that Jesus
[31:15] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[31:18] forever so the way that God acted in the
[31:21] Old Testament he can act here today in
[31:24] 2019 is that Alright so therefore if
[31:31] he's gonna act and do that he's gonna
[31:33] make you do like some of those other
[31:34] people did
[31:38] I'm reminded of a group of people that
[31:41] gathered in the upper room one day and
[31:43] they came out in an inspiration under
[31:46] the influence of their inspiration they
[31:50] didn't sound like they sounded when they
[31:52] went in because they went in odd they
[31:54] went in afraid they were uncertain but
[31:56] when they came out they had a new life
[32:00] on the inside of them they had a new way
[32:03] of walking they had a new way of talking
[32:05] they had confidence so I implore you
[32:09] today get under the inspiration of this
[32:11] word because we are fixing to take a
[32:14] body change we're fixing to get out of
[32:18] here now I need to start acting like I'm
[32:20] already changed you need to start acting
[32:24] like you're already in your new body hah
[32:30] that's not in my notes that's just
[32:33] something I read before I preach because
[32:36] I like that quote because I want the
[32:39] people to be inspired not by me not by
[32:42] brother Donnie not by any other men of
[32:44] God but be inspired by the Word of God
[32:47] because this word is life hey men
[32:53] blessed assurance Jesus the word is mine
[33:02] now when you have possession of
[33:04] something you can have confidence that
[33:07] little ladies stand up you're singing
[33:09] while ago is mine
[33:10] I know y'all love it but not like I love
[33:13] her huh those little knucklehead kids of
[33:19] mine I love them I know you do too but
[33:22] not like I do because they're mine huh
[33:26] it's Jesus yours today what are you
[33:31] gonna do for him today
[33:32] how are you gonna show the world that he
[33:35] is yours I'm only here a second Peter
[33:38] says to stir up your Mount your pure
[33:40] Minds by way of remembrance so things
[33:43] that you're here today that you will
[33:44] hear today out of this mouth will be
[33:46] things that you've heard before I'm only
[33:48] trying to stir up up your heart and
[33:49] quite frankly only a
[33:51] your heart can be stirred so if you
[33:53] don't have a pure heart I expect you to
[33:54] just look at me today I expect you to
[33:58] just sit and look some of you even be
[34:00] kind and give me this huh but a pure
[34:06] heart I'm gonna hear your heart say hey
[34:09] man I wanna hear your heart say sick and
[34:13] boy huh a pure heart by way of
[34:21] remembrance because when you get
[34:24] attached to something that you remember
[34:25] there's an identity with that that
[34:27] begins to stir something within you
[34:29] because when you hear something new you
[34:31] little crosses oh no I don't have
[34:34] anything new to give to you the only
[34:36] thing I want you to see today is Jesus
[34:38] Christ and my guarantee today I'll do
[34:42] this usually wherever I go I tell people
[34:44] that when you buy something you always
[34:46] want to guarantee you will look that
[34:47] thing over and you will inspect it what
[34:50] kind of warranty doesn't have what kind
[34:51] of guarantee huh so I guarantee you
[34:57] you're gonna hear things you've heard
[34:58] before I guarantee you gonna hear me say
[35:02] something
[35:02] I didn't probably mean the same because
[35:06] I'm human hello huh but I guarantee you
[35:17] if you look close enough if you tuned in
[35:20] your ear hard enough you will see and
[35:23] hear Jesus Christ that's my guarantee
[35:27] and with that I'll say this in closing
[35:33] I'm gonna take care of that now is that
[35:35] all right preachers lie all the time but
[35:45] I want to take our thoughts today and
[35:47] just go through a little bit of
[35:49] inspiration how the Lord dealt with me
[35:51] on this I don't even know how it's gonna
[35:53] come out because this is this is new to
[35:55] me but building among the rubble now
[36:04] it's been some time since this thought
[36:06] began to pulsate within me and the Lord
[36:07] begin to direct me this way and I never
[36:09] could quite formulate it I'm still
[36:11] working on this y'all y'all bear with me
[36:13] that all right because quite frankly I'm
[36:15] among people that know me and you know I
[36:17] think about that song you probably heard
[36:19] I want to go to church you know with a
[36:21] preacher and and and and it talks about
[36:23] you know among people that see me at my
[36:25] worst
[36:26] y'all know me huh that's right
[36:32] but as the Lord began to deal with me on
[36:35] this I began to realize that there are
[36:39] people sitting here today their life is
[36:42] in ruins and nobody knows it your spouse
[36:49] may not even know the hell that you're
[36:51] dealing with mom and daddy may not know
[36:55] it but today is your data rebuilds your
[36:58] walls now I can say that with confidence
[37:03] because I was once trapped in that
[37:05] condition coming to church discouraged
[37:10] singing my songs y'all see me standing
[37:13] right up here singing praise God brother
[37:15] joy building among the ruins Jerusalem
[37:23] that word means peace so they were
[37:26] building back the walls of peace
[37:29] so there's chaos there's hail broke
[37:32] forth in your life it's time to rebuild
[37:34] peace the Spirit of the Lord is letting
[37:37] you know that you have the ability to
[37:38] rebuild that peace
[37:41] the walls of the city they were in ruins
[37:45] and to the natural eye it was just
[37:48] rubble huh and from the stories told by
[37:56] those who had seen the destruction there
[37:59] was no way anything of value could be
[38:01] salvaged there was complete ruination
[38:03] people looking at your life maybe you're
[38:05] thinking of someone right now you think
[38:06] there's no hope for that person get
[38:10] Jesus Christ in your pocket huh so many
[38:17] times we've written people off hmm we'd
[38:24] find ourselves trapped in that mindset
[38:26] where we won't even call them sister or
[38:28] brother hello don't he want to sit
[38:31] beside them on the Pew because to our
[38:35] natural either life is just rubble but
[38:39] there's a soul in that body there's an
[38:43] opportunity for God to move in that
[38:45] person's life and what have you done
[38:48] you've written him off and still saying
[38:49] that I'm of Jesus Christ that I'm a
[38:52] Christian how many people did you know
[38:55] that Jesus Christ wrote off I can find
[38:59] in the Bible where he went and traveled
[39:01] many miles just for one now I don't like
[39:06] getting on airplanes I hate flying I
[39:09] hate it but I don't care where I have to
[39:13] go what I have to do if I can be an
[39:15] inspiration to just one person
[39:18] because as you see my inspiration has
[39:21] come from the fact that I know that
[39:22] people are sitting in churches and there
[39:24] are dying and nobody around them is
[39:29] doing anything about it they know what's
[39:31] going on in their lives they sometimes
[39:32] they know the chaos that's breaking
[39:34] forth in their lives and they won't even
[39:36] call them because I don't want him to
[39:37] think I'm being nosy
[39:40] [Music]
[39:42] be Jesus Christ be loved that's a simple
[39:48] unction that I fall under inspiration of
[39:50] is simply be Jesus Christ
[39:53] simply be love to those who I don't care
[39:55] what they look like I don't care what
[39:57] they smell like
[39:58] I don't care what they've done to you I
[39:59] don't care what they're doing to you now
[40:01] I don't care what they're going to do to
[40:03] you but if you would be love to that
[40:05] person that you would be fulfilling more
[40:09] of the purpose of what Jesus Christ
[40:11] wants done in this age then you rallying
[40:15] around your pet quote then you hold it
[40:19] so fervently on to that doctrine and you
[40:22] hold it on that thing is going to send
[40:24] you to hell because you missed an
[40:25] opportunity to be like Jesus oh I heard
[40:32] you sing that song I saw you close your
[40:35] eyes and look at all sanctimonious tears
[40:41] trickling down your cheeks but then
[40:45] you've written that person off hello but
[40:50] the homeowner Longoria is this all right
[40:52] can we go off brother Terry did you hear
[40:58] what I just say brother Don are you
[41:03] sorry outfit
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:10] Nehemiah 1:4 says and it came to pass
[41:13] when I heard these words that I sat down
[41:15] and I whipped and lorn certain days and
[41:20] fasted and prayed before the God of
[41:22] heaven because my brother is in trouble
[41:26] his walls his defense is crumbling
[41:31] my sister is in trouble and I sat down
[41:34] and I wept and I cried before the God of
[41:37] heaven their peace is gone their
[41:40] Jerusalem
[41:42] Nehemiah he hears the reporting becomes
[41:44] concern about the ruins or the current
[41:47] condition of the means of protection did
[41:52] you catch that he hears the report and
[41:56] he becomes concern about the ruins
[41:59] he becomes concern about the current
[42:02] condition of the means of protection the
[42:06] walls are down there is access to the
[42:10] temple because if you look at it
[42:11] chronologically in the scriptures it's
[42:13] it's Ezra Nehemiah Esther but it's
[42:17] actually as rrah Esther Ezra the
[42:23] Nehemiah because the temple is is we
[42:32] found out the temple it was was rebuilt
[42:35] in Ezra so the the there is access to
[42:41] the temple now I've come across this old
[42:42] quote when I was looking at some of
[42:43] these things and it says the more
[42:46] economically and culturally developed a
[42:49] city is the greater the value of things
[42:52] in the city thus the greater the need
[42:57] for the wall so there's a great value
[43:02] that's in a soul that's in a body and
[43:04] the devil knows that
[43:07] sister there's great value in you the
[43:09] devil knows that huh that's why he's
[43:16] tempting you brother too to go untrue to
[43:18] your virtue now we hear so much about
[43:20] the women keeping their virtue there's a
[43:22] virtue to be had a new young man there's
[43:26] a virtue to be kept in you you to keep
[43:28] that virtue as well the Spirit of the
[43:33] Lord told the Prophet don't smoke don't
[43:35] drink or defile your body and I often
[43:39] thought if that's one quote that
[43:41] everybody should keep it's that one huh
[43:47] running around oh wow Josiah here I go
[43:52] maybe somebody back here behind this
[43:54] stuff Oh No maybe brother Donnie has
[43:58] some people hiding out back here ah
[44:01] maybe the piano let's go see not under
[44:05] there I don't see anybody back here so I
[44:09] guess this is for you
[44:12] [Applause]
[44:17] huh because the walls have crumbled the
[44:23] walls have fallen and other people are
[44:25] in harm's way did you know that you
[44:28] cannot one person somebody out of their
[44:30] healing out of their salvation because
[44:32] of the condition of the walls in your
[44:33] life it's time to rebuild the wall
[44:37] Saints now the walls of your life can
[44:42] never be rebuilt unless you are first
[44:44] concerned about their condition running
[44:47] b-bomb okay okay what I do don't pray
[44:53] for me well I'm going to there's no hope
[44:57] for me oh yes there is because I know
[44:59] Jesus Christ I may not be able to do
[45:04] anything for you but he can now I know
[45:07] this is simple and as I've come to say
[45:12] my simple understanding of this walk
[45:14] with the Lord is simply going to get me
[45:16] out of here one day take and compare
[45:24] what you are now listen to me take and
[45:26] compare what you are now to what you
[45:29] could be under God or take and compare
[45:35] what you are now to what you used to be
[45:37] I know I'm speaking to three groups of
[45:41] people today the believer the unbeliever
[45:43] in the make believer so I know this fits
[45:46] you somewhere because I know for myself
[45:49] I could have been further along in him
[45:52] huh we so often we hear the statement
[45:58] that maybe we've even said it before I
[45:59] became a Christian 40 years ago I became
[46:02] a Christian 10 years ago I became a
[46:03] Christian let me ask you a question what
[46:07] have you become since you became
[46:13] if you became something then you should
[46:16] be continuing to become that very thing
[46:19] that you said you became huh is that
[46:25] real was that a simple enough question
[46:30] resurrection of Lazarus because we find
[46:36] out that that that would Nehemiah here
[46:38] this this this crying that he did this
[46:41] weeping this wailing it wasn't some
[46:43] little dried confession
[46:46] you know the resurrection alas was the
[46:49] prophet says and today brother Tim
[46:51] talking last night he didn't read a
[46:52] quote will I'll fill in for you brother
[46:54] Tim I'll take care of that today for you
[46:56] buddy and today they talked taking the
[47:00] Holy Ghost put a wafer under your tongue
[47:02] or shake hands with the minister oh
[47:04] brother the Prophet says I'm sick and
[47:06] tired of that old dry eyed confession
[47:12] there's no more to it then there is like
[47:15] a fellow trying to get a drink of water
[47:16] out of an old dry rag somewhere that's
[47:23] right what we need today is a good fresh
[47:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost come down and
[47:28] stir up the people again that's what we
[47:32] need today is a good fresh baptism of
[47:35] the Holy Ghost
[47:37] he's up in Erie Pennsylvania and he says
[47:40] I was watching your Lake out there the
[47:42] other day when I went down there it was
[47:44] having a big revival now if a body of
[47:46] water can have a revival under the
[47:48] inspiration of the wind of God then you
[47:52] tell me what you can have you tell me
[47:54] what I can have that we're just two
[47:59] jumping and bouncing in a jumping I said
[48:01] there's no more water in it when it's
[48:03] smooth but it's got a revival that's
[48:07] what we need today the wind blowing on
[48:10] us kinda shaking you up a little bit
[48:14] just a little bit of wind kind of
[48:16] shaking you up getting you out of your
[48:17] comfort zone
[48:19] and everywhere I'll preach I know that
[48:22] there's cute folk everywhere it's cute
[48:24] folk and Happy Valley I know you I've
[48:29] set beside some of you you say you
[48:33] usually set beside your wife with you I
[48:34] didn't say beautiful I say cute she's
[48:38] beautiful I'm gonna be getting trouble
[48:46] but the inner veil he says there's a way
[48:49] that seemeth right unto a man but the
[48:50] end thereof is the ways of death
[48:52] it might seem alright intellectually
[48:56] your soul will always testified to the
[48:59] Word of God if it's born again down in
[49:05] my soul cries holy Oh down in my soul
[49:14] cries holy there's something on the
[49:18] inside it just can't you can't contain
[49:22] it so that's why I worry about the cute
[49:25] folk that come to church you never see
[49:29] them move you never see them waving
[49:30] Eraserhead you never see them do
[49:32] anything but sit there and look like a
[49:35] bump on a pickle
[49:42] your song says I know I've been changed
[49:47] ah
[49:49] no I've been changed ah no I've been
[49:56] changed because the Alpha and Omega done
[50:01] sign my name you can't help but let it
[50:10] come out you can't help but express it
[50:13] let me get along if you got an
[50:16] intellectual faith
[50:17] oh you'll agree sure say that Bibles
[50:20] right
[50:21] intellectual faith will agree with that
[50:23] the devil says the same thing so is he
[50:29] your brother or your adversary if you're
[50:34] saying the same thing is the devil devil
[50:36] say the same thing as you get a new
[50:39] language about you if you got an
[50:43] intellectual faith the Bible's right the
[50:45] devil says the same thing the devil says
[50:46] there's a God in heaven there's a Jesus
[50:48] cry the devil says this certainly they
[50:52] believe the same thing oh you say the
[50:54] devil believe in Jesus Christ certainly
[50:56] they publicly confess him said thou art
[50:58] the Son of God thou art the Christ the
[51:00] Holy One why do you come to torment us
[51:03] before our time comes
[51:04] certainly they publicly confessed him to
[51:07] be the Son of God publicly the devil
[51:12] you see these musicians going to these
[51:15] award shows and everything in you you'll
[51:16] find out that there's they're beginning
[51:18] to join forces the Christian so-called
[51:20] artists are beginning to join forces
[51:22] with the worldly secular musical artists
[51:27] now this may not mean anything to some
[51:29] of you but some some it will capture
[51:31] your attention Kanye West he's been
[51:35] having Sunday morning services saying
[51:39] he's a Christian that's what he says so
[51:42] I say okay
[51:45] but where's the change where's the
[51:50] identification and ministers with a
[51:55] shallow experience and with the bogus
[51:57] religion ministers go out and have
[52:00] people to make such a dry-out confession
[52:02] as that and go back out in the world and
[52:04] live like the world and claim that
[52:05] they're Christians now if you're going
[52:07] back out into the world doing let the
[52:09] world does you're not a Christian you
[52:10] didn't have an experience I implore you
[52:13] I invite you to come to an altar today
[52:18] you cute folk don't like the altar from
[52:25] that time that's about the way serving
[52:27] the Lord you know you've got to put your
[52:28] heart in it high you've got to be
[52:31] sincere you've got to meet God not go to
[52:34] church and make some cold dry out
[52:36] confession go down there and stay down
[52:38] there you've got to meet Jesus Christ
[52:41] there's no way that you can encounter
[52:44] Jesus Christ and never ever ever be the
[52:47] same because there's something about
[52:53] that atmosphere that environment brother
[52:56] Tim was talking about last night and the
[52:57] Prophet said I was thinking about this
[52:59] as he was mentioning the Prophet said
[53:00] whatever environment you are in that's
[53:03] what you are watch your friends young
[53:11] people since watch that little boy
[53:15] that's got his eye on you
[53:18] young men around the message defiling
[53:21] message girls young message girls
[53:25] defiling young message boys what's wrong
[53:29] what's wrong come on in brother I'm home

[53:46] never cover sin coming to Happy Valley
[53:48] saying this is your home church will
[53:50] never cover sin no dry convention will
[53:55] ever cover sin no dry confession because
[54:01] of birth as we know is a mess
[54:03] [Applause]
[54:05] now grew up out in the country I grew up
[54:08] in a hollow holler for some of you folk
[54:12] we still refer to their own places the
[54:15] holler you going out in the Halloween
[54:16] but not in the holler down the line but
[54:19] I seen a few pigs born in my day it's
[54:24] nasty it's messy is that Alright he said
[54:30] well you look good in your suit I didn't
[54:32] think you were a country boy yeah
[54:35] grew up no running water in the house
[54:38] come on ma huh Toton and fetching water
[54:44] getting in the old number 11 I think it
[54:46] was bathtub to take a bath and I'm the
[54:48] youngest of six so I wasn't too clean
[54:53] when I got out of that water no dry a
[55:02] confession will never cover sin it takes
[55:04] sorrow and repentance and the grace of
[55:07] God that covers sin for the blood of
[55:09] Jesus Christ the one that God killed at
[55:12] Calvary to cover sin God killed his own
[55:15] son for you when nothing else could help
[55:22] love lifted me the son he bled and died
[55:27] is that right
[55:30] we're familiar with and know the message
[55:33] the Prophet preached convinced then
[55:35] concern listen to Nehemiah as he prays
[55:38] the mi 141 verse 1 a chapter 1 verse 4
[55:41] if you want to read with me Nehemiah 1
[55:43] okay everybody see my coat right
[55:47] looks good alright y'all know I'm not
[55:54] vain I'm just pretending I'm just
[55:56] playing but it's kind of sort of good to
[55:59] get value out of something you bought
[56:01] you know you don't want to just anybody
[56:04] see it huh
[56:06] but watch Nehemiah as he begins to brave
[56:09] begins to get concerned verse one
[56:12] diverted up chapter 1 verse 4 and it
[56:14] came to pass when I heard these words
[56:15] that I sat down and wept and more in
[56:17] certain days and fasted and prayed
[56:19] before the God of heaven fasting you
[56:21] don't hear that word much anymore I
[56:23] digress verse 5 and said I beseech thee
[56:26] O Lord God of heaven the great and
[56:28] terrible God that keepeth covenant and
[56:29] mercy for them that love him and observe
[56:31] his Commandments let 9 here now be
[56:33] attentive in thine eyes upon that open
[56:36] that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy
[56:37] servant which I pray before the noun day
[56:39] and night for the children of Israel thy
[56:41] servants and confess the sins of the
[56:43] children of Israel which we have sinned
[56:45] against thee both I and my father's
[56:47] house have sinned he was covering
[56:49] everybody he was making sure that the
[56:51] entire church was covered verse 7 he
[56:57] says we have dealt very correctly
[56:58] against the we-we-we we have dealt very
[57:02] correctly against thee and have not kept
[57:04] the commandments nor the statutes nor
[57:06] the judgments with south commend us I
[57:08] serve as Moses remember verse 8 I
[57:10] beseech thee the word that thou
[57:12] commandest thy servant Moses saying if
[57:14] you transgress I will scatter you abroad
[57:17] among the nations that's God's word you
[57:20] transgress there will be a scattering
[57:22] your walls will crumble huh but if you
[57:27] turn onto me and keep my Commandments
[57:28] and do them though there were of you
[57:31] cast out until the uttermost part of the
[57:33] heaven yet will I gather them from
[57:35] thence and I believe that's what God is
[57:36] doing today he through this message of
[57:39] beginning to gather those who have been
[57:40] scattered he's beginning to gather those
[57:43] who are broken down who are so weary
[57:45] they can't think that they're going to
[57:46] make another step maybe you haven't been
[57:50] to church in a long time today is your
[57:52] day huh though that were you cast out on
[57:59] the other most part they haven't yet
[58:00] will I get
[58:01] from thence and we'll bring them unto
[58:02] the place that I've chosen to set my
[58:04] name I'm trying to hurry versed here now
[58:06] these are thy servants and not people
[58:08] whom thou has to redeem by that great
[58:10] power and and by thy strong hand he
[58:13] didn't write them off no doubt there was
[58:16] somebody in that group that nehemiah was
[58:18] praying for that didn't he am i wrong at
[58:20] some point in his life because these
[58:22] were people too they bled just like you
[58:26] bleed they wake up in the morning their
[58:28] hair is all over their head just like
[58:30] you they got these little track marks
[58:33] down the side of the cheek okay cute

[58:52] these are your people Lord they're in
[58:54] trouble these walls in their lives are
[58:57] down and that that's or the pulsation
[59:01] that begin to begin to burn within me

[59:05] church and they're hurting and people
[59:08] are just walking by them out in the
[59:09] vestibule hello how many cute folk we

[59:24] verse 11 o Lord I beseech thee let not
[59:26] thine ear be attentive to the prayer of
[59:28] thy servant and to the prayer of thy
[59:29] servants who desire to fear thy name and
[59:32] prosper I pray thee and I serve in this
[59:34] day and granting him mercy in the sight
[59:36] of this man for I was the king's cup
[59:38] bearer he begins to go in prayer and
[59:41] he's seeking wisdom on what he's to do
[59:44] and he's also praying over the people
[59:49] because he become concerned then there

[1:01:11] ammonite you gotta watch those i'ts when
[1:01:15] they heard of it it grieved them
[1:01:16] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[1:01:19] seek the welfare of the children of
[1:01:20] Israel any time you go to do and wanting
[1:01:22] to do good there's gonna be some i'ts to
[1:01:25] rise up now that I is an enemy of God
[1:01:29] it may be outward or sometimes the eye
[1:01:32] tis this thing right here
[1:01:38] all your cute folk now huh the flesh
[1:01:45] will rise up and say you said you will
[1:01:48] rebuild but I'm gonna oppose you because
[1:01:51] you know that scar that's got you
[1:01:53] trapped in as I've come to say we get
[1:01:55] stuck on stupid so many times maybe it
[1:02:00] was an abuse or an offence in your life
[1:02:02] and you get stuck on that very thing
[1:02:05] you are greater than the trial there's
[1:02:09] something on the inside of you that's
[1:02:10] greater than that thing that's trapped
[1:02:12] you you're getting stuck on stupid
[1:02:15] you're getting stuck on flesh this flesh
[1:02:17] you cannot bring before God I'm getting
[1:02:21] ahead of myself this fourth of our
[1:02:24] position comes forth from within and
[1:02:26] without it is a resistance against the
[1:02:29] work that God is doing in your life the
[1:02:31] trial comes to shake you listen the
[1:02:34] trial comes to shake you to put you to
[1:02:36] the very bottom to see where and how you
[1:02:38] will stand what do you do when you've
[1:02:42] done all you can seems like you can't
[1:02:46] make it through huh and the song goes on
[1:02:50] to say you just stand when there's
[1:02:54] nothing left to do you just stand and
[1:02:56] watch the Lord see you through yes after
[1:03:00] you've done all you can you just
[1:03:04] complain no that's the wrong song turn
[1:03:11] the station that's the wrong station we
[1:03:14] listen to gospel music around here not
[1:03:16] down in defeat station or at least I
[1:03:24] hope you do huh whether it be southern
[1:03:29] gospel whole LA y'all forgive me it's
[1:03:36] good to
[1:03:42] ah I just had to make you feel good but
[1:03:49] it is a resistance against God's work
[1:03:51] the trial comes to shake you to see
[1:03:54] where you're gonna stand in how but we
[1:03:56] only have to go through the Prophet says
[1:03:58] we only have to go through these schools
[1:04:00] of sufferings to know how the other
[1:04:02] fellow feels so sometimes when you're in
[1:04:07] that Valley when you're low and you're
[1:04:09] saying why me Lord
[1:04:10] think about that quote right there
[1:04:13] sometimes he lets us go through these
[1:04:15] schools of hard knocks so we will know
[1:04:18] how that other brother that you wrote
[1:04:19] off oh yeah there he is again
[1:04:24] the one that you wrote off and you said
[1:04:26] wasn't gonna make it wasn't worth
[1:04:27] anything now you know how he feels now
[1:04:30] you know how she feels when all is well
[1:04:35] in your home and nobody's died oh that's
[1:04:38] sad oh wait then it comes your house
[1:04:43] because in fact that's where he's
[1:04:45] picking up on that quote someone had
[1:04:46] passed away and he girls refer about his
[1:04:49] dad passing away and he says sometimes
[1:04:51] we go through these things so we'll know
[1:04:52] how the other person feels cuz God he's
[1:04:56] building his church out of material
[1:04:58] which he made I got a hurry he will use
[1:05:01] these things to fulfill his purpose
[1:05:03] therefore the reason that's the reason
[1:05:05] why we go through these things you're in
[1:05:07] the midst of this Saints you're in the
[1:05:09] midst of this brother/sister you're
[1:05:10] going through this very thing right now
[1:05:13] to serve the purpose of God he's working
[1:05:17] a work in you that's gonna be glorious
[1:05:19] is gonna be beautiful hmm
[1:05:22] these experiences they build our
[1:05:25] character and mold our image the mistake
[1:05:30] listen the mistake is not to define who
[1:05:33] you are
[1:05:36] see that's how the devil would twist
[1:05:38] things he will get you to make a
[1:05:41] decision he will get you to do something
[1:05:43] that you should not have done huh and
[1:05:46] then he'll make you pay for it and then
[1:05:51] he will trap you in that mental
[1:05:53] condition and make you think that that's
[1:05:55] all that you will ever be but you're
[1:06:01] more than that you've been bought with a
[1:06:05] price maybe you didn't know that but I'm
[1:06:07] here to let you know you have been
[1:06:09] bought with a price you say me brother
[1:06:12] Joel yes you but you don't know what I
[1:06:15] did I don't need to know what you did
[1:06:17] all that you need to know is what he did
[1:06:20] for you
[1:06:25] Nehemiah chapter 3 i'ma run through this
[1:06:28] real quick
[1:06:29] we found out the rebuilding begins
[1:06:31] that's what and we and we thing that
[1:06:33] that's amazing to me about Nehemiah 3 is
[1:06:36] how it starts out turn with me named
[1:06:37] Nehemiah 3 and 1 the rebuilding begins
[1:06:40] the reconstruction of the defense's
[1:06:43] starts and the breaches are closed up
[1:06:47] the holes the gaps and the Elijah of the
[1:06:50] high priest rose up with his brethren
[1:06:52] the priest and they builded the sheep
[1:06:54] gate so they start at the Sheep gate no
[1:06:59] maybe sometimes I'll have time
[1:07:00] nehemiah's gates and all there's some
[1:07:02] beautiful types all throughout and then
[1:07:03] maybe you've studied it before but but
[1:07:05] it won't have time to get into all of it
[1:07:06] and I just want to focus on that one
[1:07:07] just just for a moment in in verse 1 the
[1:07:12] Sheep gate now the Sheep gate was the
[1:07:15] gate through which the Sheep who that
[1:07:17] were used for sacrificed or brought into
[1:07:19] the city and route to the temple and
[1:07:20] that's a perfect place to start a sheep
[1:07:24] a sacrifice so blood Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:29] best place to start
[1:07:31] you say ah brother Donny was here I talk
[1:07:33] to brother Donny after sir you'll need
[1:07:34] to talk to brother die that may be good
[1:07:36] and fine if that will help do that but
[1:07:38] talk to Jesus Christ so that began
[1:07:42] building at the Sheep gate sacrifice
[1:07:46] blood Christ that's where you start and
[1:07:50] there are other gates that we could get
[1:07:52] into but but we we just don't have time
[1:07:54] and we're just going through them Oh
[1:07:56] we'll just we'll just keep going but the
[1:08:00] Sheep gate find Jesus Christ today
[1:08:04] Saints said well jewel why you saying
[1:08:08] that isn't that who we are isn't that
[1:08:11] what we're supposed to be doing in that
[1:08:13] what we're supposed to be saying the
[1:08:15] mysteries of great the seven seals of
[1:08:16] thunders and all that all that's
[1:08:18] wonderful is great it identifies Who I
[1:08:20] am but if I miss Jesus Christ I missed
[1:08:23] it all you said well tell me something
[1:08:27] supernatural jewel said I mean I will
[1:08:29] thank you the supernatural in you should
[1:08:35] speak louder than the natural that's
[1:08:41] super that's powerful because that
[1:08:47] supernatural that's in you will empower
[1:08:49] you to do what you cannot do because see
[1:08:53] when I was in my condition of my falling
[1:08:56] crumbled walls and I've shared this with
[1:08:59] you before maybe you forgot I'll tell
[1:09:00] you again cuz this is wonderful it's
[1:09:02] become more of Who I am but I'm sitting
[1:09:05] back before it here in the church before
[1:09:07] service just praying just pondering over
[1:09:09] the service discouraged down and I heard
[1:09:11] the sphere of the Lord speak to me and
[1:09:12] said the you that was you before there
[1:09:16] was you that's you
[1:09:20] now you believe what you want and you
[1:09:23] say what you want but the Lord spoke to
[1:09:24] me and he was letting me know that this
[1:09:28] that you've become that's not you you're
[1:09:35] looking at me today with natural eyes
[1:09:36] and I'm looking upon you with natural
[1:09:37] eyes I know that's not the real you and
[1:09:39] that's what I'm after it doesn't matter
[1:09:43] what you've done because there's a
[1:09:44] supernatural nough sinew and it will
[1:09:47] empower you to do what you cannot do the
[1:09:51] super Necedah sinew is an attribute of
[1:09:54] God's thinking military did you hear
[1:09:59] what I just said the supernatural
[1:10:02] necessity is an attribute of God's
[1:10:04] thinking he said oh I want to do
[1:10:07] something for Jesus Christ but become
[1:10:10] that suprem naturalness greater than
[1:10:13] Solomon he says when his program was
[1:10:15] laid out the whole thing you were
[1:10:17] recognized in that program when he began
[1:10:22] to lay out his program the Prophet says
[1:10:24] you were recognized in that program
[1:10:26] because you got eternal life I'm not
[1:10:31] talking to the cute folk cuz they don't
[1:10:33] realize that they have it but you that
[1:10:36] do know you should be swinging from his
[1:10:38] chandeliers because you got eternal life
[1:10:46] the word eternal never did begin and
[1:10:48] never can it never can it in you are an
[1:10:51] attribute of God's thinking before the
[1:10:53] world was ever created many times we
[1:10:57] think about attributes we think about
[1:10:58] healing all of these things but you are
[1:11:00] an express attribute of God's thinking
[1:11:03] and that life that's the only way you
[1:11:07] can have eternal life and that life that
[1:11:10] he was thinking of you is in you now
[1:11:14] that life that he was seeking of then
[1:11:16] it's right in you if we could just
[1:11:18] realize that the rapture will go
[1:11:23] how many wants to rapture realize that
[1:11:27] life that's in Yui has always been in
[1:11:29] you I'm here to quicken a life quicken a
[1:11:33] seed to wake us
[1:11:36] there's no way to separate it it's in
[1:11:39] there to stay you can't get rid of
[1:11:41] eternal life no matter how much you sin
[1:11:43] no matter how much drugs you put in your
[1:11:45] veins no matter how many women you sleep
[1:11:47] with no matter how many men you sleep
[1:11:49] but you cannot hide eternal life the
[1:11:54] devil tries to make you think because of
[1:11:55] what you did and what you said he wants
[1:11:58] to trap you in that but I'm here to let
[1:11:59] you know today that there's eternal life
[1:12:01] inside of you you can't get away from it
[1:12:05] the devil's got you trapped he's trying
[1:12:08] to make you think that that's all that
[1:12:10] you will ever become hear me building
[1:12:16] among the rubble you look around your
[1:12:19] life there's no way I can do this with
[1:12:23] Nehemiah what to survey the the the
[1:12:26] ruins there was no place even that he
[1:12:28] could cross over you're trapped in that
[1:12:31] condition and you think there's no way
[1:12:33] out
[1:12:35] sometimes you have to start building
[1:12:37] from within I want to go back in the
[1:12:42] scripture to be able what was the first
[1:12:45] thing he did when revelation of the
[1:12:46] light struck his path yeah what was the
[1:12:50] first thing that he did he went looking
[1:12:53] for blood when revelation struck that
[1:12:58] boy's path he went on a search for some
[1:13:01] blood cruelty of sin noticed beautiful
[1:13:05] time here he comes dragging the little
[1:13:07] lamb pulling him on what caused him to
[1:13:09] do that I could imagine the little
[1:13:13] fellow flake falling probably knew what
[1:13:15] was near dragging the little feet
[1:13:17] perfect type of Christ dragging the
[1:13:19] cross beautiful God's lamb coming down
[1:13:22] through Jerusalem falling weak
[1:13:24] Here Come the little fellow bleeding
[1:13:26] along and when he got him up to the
[1:13:28] great rock laid him upon the rock taking
[1:13:30] a piece of sharp rock I don't know guess
[1:13:32] they had no knives in those days laid
[1:13:34] him the prophet didn't know did you
[1:13:37] the Prophet didn't know
[1:13:41] hello internet people we still believe a
[1:13:45] profit that don't know everything so
[1:13:51] what if those men didn't fall off the
[1:13:53] bridge sir he's human
[1:13:59] I'll let brother Donnie do it then I
[1:14:01] don't know guess they had no knives in
[1:14:03] those days laid them like that took him
[1:14:05] to the back of his head took him by the
[1:14:07] back of his head and pulled him up like
[1:14:09] this this is a horrible thing it's ugly
[1:14:11] it's dirty it's nasty
[1:14:14] it's a bird who can ready to take place
[1:14:17] took a wrong and beat it through his
[1:14:20] throat on that rock died the lamb
[1:14:22] bleeding bleeding blood splashing his
[1:14:24] little arteries cut the blood flying all
[1:14:26] over his little white wool become bathed
[1:14:28] red with blood God looked down from
[1:14:30] heaven and said that's it that's it now
[1:14:34] you got it that's the way the blood
[1:14:36] spurting from his little veins so can
[1:14:41] God look down in this service today and
[1:14:43] look at your life and say that's it
[1:14:45] that's the blood that I'm looking for
[1:14:48] so when he when the light first struck
[1:14:50] his path he went looking for blood and
[1:14:52] when Cain saw his brother what did he
[1:14:55] see blood he saw Jesus Christ in the
[1:15:03] prefigure he saw the coming of the one
[1:15:06] that was two redeemed he saw that blood
[1:15:09] and you know what he rejoins he was a
[1:15:11] praise God that's that New Age Bible
[1:15:15] that puts everybody in and makes
[1:15:17] everybody great y'all didn't bring out
[1:15:21] to this church did you okay you internet
[1:15:26] whatever camera whether you internet
[1:15:27] folk when Cain saw his brother what did
[1:15:31] he see he saw blood and he hated it he
[1:15:35] hated Jesus Christ he hated the things
[1:15:38] of God opposition
[1:15:42] immediately revelation opposition you're
[1:15:47] sitting here looking at me now our
[1:15:49] position is I don't believe that well
[1:15:54] I'm glad you let me know that because
[1:15:59] this isn't for you because believers
[1:16:01] believe I thought that was gonna go by
[1:16:09] me but I couldn't I couldn't let it go
[1:16:12] ah Abel was covered in the manifestation
[1:16:18] of his revelation do you hear that how
[1:16:22] much time I got him have to go rather
[1:16:25] than convert to God's Way Cain chose to
[1:16:28] destroy the system of God did you catch
[1:16:32] that rather they convert he wanted to
[1:16:37] destroy he did not feel accepted with
[1:16:41] his evil lifestyle that's where we are
[1:16:45] in this age now people don't feel
[1:16:49] comfortable around you and your
[1:16:51] godliness because of their lifestyle so
[1:16:58] what are they gonna try to do they're
[1:17:00] gonna try to kill you they're gonna try
[1:17:03] to destroy your name your character your
[1:17:05] influence now if you don't have a life
[1:17:08] if you don't have a walk that's up to
[1:17:11] you but we are here to stand against
[1:17:15] every evil spirit
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:20] he did not feel accepted with this evil
[1:17:22] lifestyle Kane thought if I kill it
[1:17:25] then I won't have to look at it I won't
[1:17:27] have to look at what God accepts if I
[1:17:30] get rid of it I won't have to look at it
[1:17:32] if I can just get him fired I won't have
[1:17:35] to be around him opposition they wanted
[1:17:41] he wanted to kill the light so he could
[1:17:44] feel good in his darkness that's what
[1:17:48] this age is doing today they're wanting
[1:17:50] to snuff out and kill destroy the light
[1:17:53] so they can feel good in their darkness
[1:17:58] because evil deeds are done in darkness
[1:18:01] they want to murder the truth so they
[1:18:04] can feel good in their life the devil's
[1:18:09] out to murder you he's out to kill you
[1:18:14] huh Jesus Christ God has come to call
[1:18:23] you today he's calling you what is he
[1:18:27] calling me for what is he calling me to
[1:18:30] brother Joel he's calling you to the new
[1:18:33] you he's letting you know today you
[1:18:37] don't have to stay in that condition you
[1:18:41] don't have to stay where you are you
[1:18:42] don't have to be bothered by that little
[1:18:44] Jezebel girl in the schoolhouse walking
[1:18:46] down the halls you see her every day and
[1:18:48] your friends are talking about it look
[1:18:49] at that look at that you don't want to
[1:18:51] look but pressure what are you a
[1:18:59] that devil

[1:19:30] to see that the you that was you before
[1:19:32] there was all this chaos before there

[1:19:43] there has to be a rebirth there has to
[1:19:45] be something to happen in your life in
[1:19:47] the message questions and answers he
[1:19:50] says someone asks the question please

[1:19:54] of the Bronte heroes where I might have
[1:19:55] trouble I can't see it very well I
[1:19:58] forgot to blow it up make it bigger so I
[1:20:03] can see it so don't laugh at me I'm just
[1:20:06] I'm just trying to see please explain
[1:20:09] the mystery of the translation by the
[1:20:10] end I always try to work this in because
[1:20:13] it's real it's just a change to our
[1:20:16] bodies let's say our you know what I
[1:20:18] mean when I say that I don't mean to be
[1:20:20] sacrilegious I don't mean to say ours I
[1:20:22] don't mean to say this Church I mean to
[1:20:24] say every believer Abraham he was
[1:20:25] looking for a promised son that was
[1:20:27] promised him is that right and the
[1:20:29] church is looking for a promised son to
[1:20:31] the bride is that right the bride is
[1:20:33] looking for the promised son before the
[1:20:35] promised son could come to Saren Abraham
[1:20:37] their bodies had to be changed is that
[1:20:42] right she was too old to have a baby she
[1:20:45] had no milk veins in her breasts her
[1:20:46] breasts was dried up her room wasn't
[1:20:48] fertile she was sterile she could not
[1:20:50] have the baby
[1:20:51] her heart was too old to stand labor so
[1:20:54] what happened God changed her back to a
[1:20:56] new young woman and he did Abraham the
[1:20:59] same thing because he said his body was
[1:21:00] as good as dead see and he had to change
[1:21:02] that their body in order to receive the
[1:21:05] promise that he had to change their body
[1:21:07] in order for them to receive the
[1:21:08] promised son I know you know this but
[1:21:10] you're gonna hear it again today because
[1:21:12] maybe somebody didn't catch it the last
[1:21:14] time
[1:21:15] and he cannot receive the promised son
[1:21:17] that's promised us today in these bodies
[1:21:19] that we live in these bodies are sin you
[1:21:22] cannot receive the word in this body so
[1:21:27] you got to go searching for that you
[1:21:29] that's really you because the
[1:21:32] intellectual conception of who you think
[1:21:34] this is all about you will miss it as
[1:21:37] far as the East is from the West this
[1:21:39] for the the the this first conscience
[1:21:42] controls the body with CJ's feel smelly
[1:21:44] here and it's just got us all scrupled
[1:21:45] up see taste feel smell in here and I
[1:21:49] was hoping that maybe I and my thought
[1:21:50] was going a different way even looking
[1:21:52] at just looking at the appearances and
[1:21:54] the message I preached on that but but
[1:21:56] anyways see taste feel smelling here to
[1:21:57] get you all scooped it up with reason
[1:21:58] and everything else but that that new
[1:22:00] body that comes from this born-again not
[1:22:03] this conscience it will pass away it's
[1:22:05] that inside something that lives
[1:22:07] everybody understand it's Amen it's not
[1:22:11] the outside see taste feel smell in here
[1:22:13] it isn't it's subject to death and will
[1:22:16] die but the inside part of you hold on
[1:22:18] Saints but the inside part of you down
[1:22:22] in here inside that is the person that
[1:22:25] cannot die and that's the person that
[1:22:30] the new life starts from that's the
[1:22:34] person that you that's really you that's
[1:22:36] the person that this new life starts
[1:22:38] from from the new birth and it builds
[1:22:41] another person in the image of this
[1:22:45] person you are around that life it
[1:22:48] builds another person around that
[1:22:50] changed body that changed life so
[1:22:55] potentially it's in here and what is it
[1:22:57] the word promise before the foundation
[1:22:59] of the world and around there this only
[1:23:01] reflects the negative that will reflect
[1:23:03] the positive of the word see and the
[1:23:05] same thing our translation of the bride
[1:23:07] will be the same thing I've got a new
[1:23:11] home over in Zion and it's mine the word
[1:23:15] is what's changing our bodies the words
[1:23:19] given to us to produce a rapture the
[1:23:22] word has not given us to us to fight
[1:23:24] over and bicker over
[1:23:26] it's given to us to change our very
[1:23:28] bodies you say I don't believe that it's
[1:23:33] not for you it's for believers is that
[1:23:41] right as the book of Nehemiah comes to a
[1:23:44] close chapter 12 we find the dedication
[1:23:46] of the walls and the people rejoicing
[1:23:48] singing they're praising they're
[1:23:50] shouting huh because there's been a
[1:23:55] change there's been something to happen
[1:23:56] they they directed the walls that their
[1:23:58] city was now protected that the temple
[1:24:02] was now protected that that value that
[1:24:06] was on the inside of them there was
[1:24:08] something that they realized that I got
[1:24:11] a hold of something that's now gonna
[1:24:12] hold me because I cannot hold myself
[1:24:17] there was music and there was great joy
[1:24:20] there was rejoicing they gave expression
[1:24:22] to the inward work that was going on
[1:24:25] inside of them hmm you said brother I'm
[1:24:30] just a pickle we'll bump on brother I'm
[1:24:34] more than a pickle
[1:24:36] I've got eternal life inside of me there
[1:24:40] is deity in tabernacle in human flesh
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:46] huh chapter 13 we found out even after
[1:24:52] all that worship there's still some
[1:24:53] strongholds there's still a few more
[1:24:55] things that nehemiah has to take care of
[1:24:57] and Nehemiah he took a firm stand and he
[1:25:00] declared both in Word and in action he
[1:25:04] said no not in my house not where I live
[1:25:10] you're not taking my son hello mama
[1:25:15] you have to say devil you're not getting
[1:25:19] my girl you're not getting my grandbaby
[1:25:23] [Applause]
[1:25:25] huh cuz there's still some strongholds
[1:25:29] he resisted the evil Nehemiah thirteen
[1:25:32] seven we found it and I came to
[1:25:34] Jerusalem and understood of the evil
[1:25:35] that Elijah did for Tobias now it Elijah
[1:25:39] was a priest and he got indeed allied
[1:25:43] with tobiah now Tobias we knows you know
[1:25:45] the story was one of the first ones that
[1:25:46] began to begin - mm poke it poke it in
[1:25:50] the amaya be that thorn in his flesh so
[1:25:52] what's the ministry doing hanging out
[1:25:54] with this one that's I don't know and
[1:25:58] understood of the evil that he lied she
[1:26:00] did for Dubai and preparing him a
[1:26:01] chamber in the courts of the house of
[1:26:03] God he drugged him up in the house of
[1:26:04] God after I put working building this
[1:26:08] thing I'm gonna allow the devil to come
[1:26:10] back up am i uh huh I worked hard to
[1:26:14] build this wall huh allow the devil to
[1:26:20] come no I don't think so ah and it
[1:26:24] grieves me sword near mine says
[1:26:26] therefore I cast forth all the house
[1:26:28] folds tougher to buy out of the chamber
[1:26:31] he took everything that that till I had
[1:26:34] drug in and he kicked it out now let's
[1:26:38] break old school was that all right
[1:26:40] he kicked out his stuff he kicked out
[1:26:45] his TV that's that's that's short for
[1:26:50] television
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:54] he kicked out all of his old bad
[1:26:58] websites Harlequin romance brother Joe
[1:27:03] is my favorite literature that's a lie
[1:27:09] they lying to you in those books they're
[1:27:13] lying to you on those websites
[1:27:18] I better shut up yeah then I commanded
[1:27:24] and they cleanse the chambers 13 and 9
[1:27:27] and thither brought I again the vessels
[1:27:30] of the house of God with the meat
[1:27:31] offering and the frankincense he's
[1:27:32] beginning to bring praise he's beginning
[1:27:34] to bring that new life he's beginning to
[1:27:36] bring that joy back in there's still
[1:27:38] some strongholds he needs to get rid of
[1:27:40] Nehemiah 13 to 23 says in those days
[1:27:43] also I saw Jews that had married wives
[1:27:45] of Ashdod of Amon and of Moab strange
[1:27:50] women hmm now my boys know you will not
[1:27:58] bring those strange women up in this
[1:28:00] house I told you I was gonna leave you
[1:28:04] alone I didn't tell you saying you
[1:28:06] specifically I got the other two I said
[1:28:10] my boys and their children speak half in
[1:28:15] the speech of Ashdod and cannot speak in
[1:28:17] the Jews language they forgot how to
[1:28:21] speak boo devil the simple quotes in the
[1:28:26] message they couldn't even quote them
[1:28:27] anymore huh because of a strange woman
[1:28:33] that they drug in and could not speak in
[1:28:36] the Jews language but according to the
[1:28:38] language of each people
[1:28:39] Nehemiah 1325 says and I contended with
[1:28:41] them now watch what near my does says
[1:28:45] well that's my baby and you know bring
[1:28:48] her on to the house I know she looks
[1:28:50] like Jezebel and bring her on bring him
[1:28:53] on to the house I know he's here spirit
[1:28:55] and his lips and his tongue in his big
[1:28:57] toe
[1:28:59] it's okay uh-uh not nehemiah and i
[1:29:05] contended with them and cursed them and
[1:29:07] smoked certain of them he took care
[1:29:11] business he began to clean house and
[1:29:14] this is what he did and I plug off their
[1:29:17] hair I'm sure there was some women in
[1:29:22] this group too
[1:29:23] and made them swear by God saying you
[1:29:28] shall not give your daughters unto their
[1:29:29] sons nor take their daughters unto your
[1:29:31] sons or for yourselves
[1:29:34] Nehemiah thirteen and twenty eight sets
[1:29:36] and one of the sons of joy joy joy
[1:29:40] odda the son of Elijah ship the high
[1:29:43] priest was son-in-law as some like
[1:29:44] musicians come with son-in-law dissemble
[1:29:47] on the horn right
[1:29:48] therefore I chased him from me if you
[1:29:55] don't get anything else out of this
[1:29:57] sermon today chase the devil from you
[1:30:03] you have the power you have the voice
[1:30:08] because this is the days of the voice is
[1:30:12] it not that voice just wasn't crying out
[1:30:15] through the words or do the body in the
[1:30:18] mouth of William Mariam Brenham that
[1:30:20] voice is to be cried out in my life in
[1:30:22] your life I don't want it to just be
[1:30:27] stuck in the Prophet I want it to be me
[1:30:29] I want to become this word and
[1:30:31] coincidentally I say that so many times
[1:30:34] the the Malachi 4 actually speaks of you
[1:30:37] before it even speaks of the Prophet it
[1:30:42] identifies Yuka because it says behold I
[1:30:45] send you so the importance of you is
[1:30:51] great so the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:30:56] wanting you to chase these things from
[1:30:59] your life this foremost enemy Semillon
[1:31:04] he had done more than any other to
[1:31:07] frustrate the purpose of rebuilding now
[1:31:11] you know the
[1:31:12] problem in your life that's frustrating
[1:31:15] the purpose of you living for Jesus
[1:31:16] Christ nobody else may know that thing
[1:31:20] but you know it it's kept you stuck on
[1:31:25] stupid for years but today is a new day
[1:31:31] [Music]
[1:31:33] today is the day of your salvation today
[1:31:36] is the day of your deliverance there's a
[1:31:41] song and it says this is a simple song
[1:31:43] don't go play anybody I know yeah I
[1:31:45] don't guess but it says Lord deliver me
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:51] cuz all I seem to do is hurt me hurt me
[1:32:00] that's all it says Lord deliver me from
[1:32:05] me because the theme that you're doing
[1:32:10] is not hurting anybody but you but
[1:32:17] you'll find out eventually it's gonna
[1:32:19] eat out into the church and begin to
[1:32:22] affect the church you'll knock somebody
[1:32:26] else out of their healing stand with me
[1:32:30] building among the rubble
[1:32:42] do you love him Italy good to us I told

[1:32:50] care of that all right

[1:32:56] truly Saints it's time to rid these
[1:33:00] things out of our lives
[1:33:01] that's that simple by the jaw I know I
[1:33:04] know I understand that I believe that
[1:33:08] but it's things that we need to hold on
[1:33:10] to things that we need to get ahold of
[1:33:12] let me say that way things that we need
[1:33:14] to get ahold of this gonna change our
[1:33:16] very body because we cannot trust this
[1:33:19] there's so many people that you say well
[1:33:22] I can't trust him I can't trust her you
[1:33:24] can't even trust yourself

[1:33:31] are when you are by yourself can I come
[1:33:36] in when you're by yourself that's who
[1:33:42] you really are
[1:33:45] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:33:52] for this time these words this
[1:33:54] inspiration this little thought and I'm
[1:33:58] nothing Lord but just simply a spare

[1:34:21] you've called me to be and express it in
[1:34:22] the way that you've given me unction to
[1:34:25] expression so I pray that it's found
[1:34:27] somewhere to settle that they can take
[1:34:28] it tomorrow and feed upon it and come
[1:34:32] against the enemy to fight the fight
