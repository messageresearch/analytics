figure out who they are oh boy they're in for trouble since i'm the only guy wearing it it must be me and it's so wonderful to be be together today house of the lord certainly appreciate the opportunity let's turn to the book of ruth if you would ruth chapter 3 verse 1. the rob is still on for tomorrow night 6 o'clock okay question answers for the youth tomorrow night supper provided at six okay i think we might have the service part maybe over here tomorrow night so we can stream it and be able to record it um our youth has asked a bunch of good questions and i think that it wouldn't would be a benefit for more than just the youth actually so if you can't stream it tomorrow not they'll be able to record it so you can you can hear it i like question answers well some of them anyway of course an interest is tricky but it's it kind of tells you where people are and what they're dealing with what they're thinking about where they are in their life and had some really good question answers so well questions would be good i guess it's yet debatable to see what the answers will be right i've been studying on them now for for a couple of weeks so we just come expecting the lord to to meet with us once again ruth chapter 3 verse verse 1. then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz our kindred with whoms maidens thou was behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking let's pray together lord jesus how we love your word how we thank you father for making a way that it could be written down for us that we would be able to read it it's easy for us to see how that story is told from one generation to the next if your words would have been simply handed down from one generation to another generation to another generation to another generation verbally only what would we have wound up with in this age but you wanted your word to be written down and we thank you lord that we're living in an age when also you sent us a prophet with a message and you didn't just want people that were around him telling their children them telling their children but you made a way so that it could be recorded that we would be able to hear the voice of our messenger we're the only church age that has been able to hear the voice of their messenger even though he's been gone from the earth for decades and we're so grateful that we live in that age that we can hear the voice of the seventh angel so we're here today father because we believe that you're still the same god and you're desiring to speak to us today so we've got ready and we come to church we've just decided that today's a day that we're going to hear from god we've decided that we're going to open our hearts because we're here we're going to just present our needs before the almighty god that you'll take a minister and move him aside and help him to be able to speak to us father we love you we worship you with all of our hearts bless us as we sit together in jesus name amen god bless you you may be seated protocol can be a strange thing the way to approach something or the way to come to something or someone it could vary from one to the other it can vary in diplomats i've been in different parts of the world and flew on flights with diplomats i was on a flight one time in africa and there was there was a pretty high ranking official that was on the flight and it wasn't really hard to tell that he was high ranking because he wanted everybody else on the plane to know he was so he had a position and he had an attitude with that position he wanted to be treated different he wanted to sit in a certain spot and he demanded coffee and he demanded what they call biscuits which is cookies to us but he demanded this special treatment one of the brothers that i was with just so happened that they had assigned him this famous important man's seat and this guy got all been out of shape he was so angry and so mad so he demanded a certain protocol he demanded to be treated a certain way which was above everybody else on the plane well myself i thought the pilot was much more important than he was i mean that's just me okay that was just my view about it because i figured we could make it without that guy i didn't figure we could make it without the pipe but this attitude of this individual was that pretty much he he was the top dog well i guess if you're talking about dogs you are but since i ain't no dog i don't have a dog in this race but that doesn't do away with there is an approach and there is a protocol and god has one and naomi now she of course knew the law she knew the leverage law that she was going to teach ruth about ruth being a muabidest we don't know if she understood exactly what she was being told to do but what was really important wasn't so much that she understood it but that she obeyed it with the right type of attitude you know god has many ways by which he differentiates his elect just between people that don't want to be lost and the elect the elect are not people that just don't they want to skip out on hell but the elect they love god so much they want to do whatever he wants them to do it might seem foolish to the eyes of the world it might seem very very simple to the eyes of others but to the elect it's not that way at all if god wants them to do something they will do it whether or not they even understand it now she's giving her a fivefold manner by which she must approach boaz now remember the jews tell us that boaz was about 80 and ruth was about 40 or younger so this within itself is kind of odd now especially for our western civilization for them it was not so much but she must know and learn what is the right approach naomi wants to give her rest as she calls it in other words she wants her to be married she wants her to have a husband that will give her a name a protection a place provided to where she will be able to live and naomi knows the law of god well enough to know that by the leverage law that if you had a husband that died and there was a near kinsmen then that near kinsman was obligated by the leverage law to take that woman to be his wife whether it was a brother it could be a stepfather an uncle a cousin and then whenever they would have a child that child would actually bear the name of that dead husband it would also receive a portion of his inheritance so naomi doesn't just leave ruth to a spot well honey just do whatever you think i'll tell you what you just whatever you think uh whatever you want to do and let's say it this way however you feel led now being a pastor for about 40 years now i found out that when people say those words it's like those words override every scripture they override every quote when people say they feel led to do something well this is the way i look at it again i'm a simple sort of a fellow i don't figure the holy ghost is going to lead me or you or anyone else to go contrary to his word so when we feel led to do something we need to check and make sure that what we feel led to do is not contrary to the word so ruth now she's a moabitess no doubt they did not approach it this way back in the land of moab whether it made sense or not she's going to do it and god is going to honor her and we will pick it up with boaz as well that boaz even as much as he wanted her to be his wife and as much as he believed no doubt it was the sovereignty of god but boaz would not commit himself to her until the closest of kin resolved his rights i wish a lot of preachers could understand that i wish a lot of our folks in the message could understand that so the first thing that she does is bathes her cell now she washes as we said before there was no showers there was no bathrooms in their houses so you know a bass was something of of a rarity of sorts that was one thing that the romans did in every conquest that they would make the romans brought highways they brought aqueducts they brought water they brought so many things along in their civilization as i stood a few years ago and saw the roman aqueduct which had been buried by years of accumulation of sand and standing there in the land of israel and looking at that massive massive aqueduct which they had built in order to bring water you know the city of laodicea was quite unique in that the romans had built two separate aqueducts for laodicea because there was a hot spring in one direction and there was cold water in another direction so they built an aqueduct for the warm water now whenever john wrote what the lord said about being lukewarm they knew exactly what he was talking about because they had received that hot water when it left its origination by the time it reached laodicea it was lukewarm so they knew exactly what john was meaning so god is the same way in the sense that he wants us to be able to obey his word whether we understand it whether we don't that's not the thing it's he checks us by our obedience and our love to him is not just by words but more so by obedience now james said be therefore not a forgetful hearer that is one that hears the word they may rejoice in it shout in it talk about how good it is but then they forget to obey it but ruth is truly a genuine type of a gentile an elect gentile we have no place here written in here or in josephus or any of the rest of the histories that i could find that ruth questioned one thing that naomi said now we don't know if she understood it if it made sense as a matter of fact what she's going to ask her to do is very embarrassing and very humiliating it could be interpreted as if the ruth is a foul woman that's right but ruth does not question she simply has confidence in the one giving her the instruction so she doesn't say i'll tell what i'm going to pray about this do you mind if i go on a three-day fast well you can if you want to but the festival will be over time you get down with your fast and you'll miss your window of obedience so now it is now or wait until next year you know that's the time for us to move when the spirit of god is moving on our hearts so notice what the writer said wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee now this is a accumulative type of saying that was very common among not only the jews but the middle eastern people and for some of them is still there today having been there in some of the markets and i stood in durban south africa several years ago and there's quite a a population of east indians in durban i was there brother naomi and i do and several indian believers that are there and he wanted to take me to their market and i i went there to their market and all for those of you that like indian food and you smell all those different spices and those leaves and nuts and things that's in there it's just overwhelming so they have big old things that look safe similar to us a 55-gallon drum and that size and they would have this spice and it was yellow and this one was red this one was orange and this one was green and it was just unbelievable the the fragrances that were there then in another part of that market they would have sandalwood and they would have pieces of balsam and pieces of fur and they would have myrrh and they would have frankincense so you would come from one set of aromas and fragrances and move from there to another well brother naomi wanted to do me a favor so he bought me up a bunch of spices i'm a tennessee boy okay now i do like indian food yeah i do like it i don't like it quite as strong as they like it but he bought me this and he bought me that and he bought me something else and you know i'm going from there to johannesburg to the meetings and i've got my suitcase so i don't know anything else to do other than put it in the suitcase well by the time i got to the meetings you can guess what i smell like so i thought i i've got another week or ten days you know this what in the world am i going to do with all of this stuff herein lies the mystery of which i will not reveal but needless to say i didn't smell that way after that meeting that's all that will be said but whenever god now you know the natural types to spiritual so god has a way for us to approach him now sinners can come to god as they are even a backside look at the prodigal son he come to his father which was in tight uh smelling without a ring without shoes without proper garments a sinner can come to god you know with cigarette on their breasts and alcohol and whatever more but for a son or daughter of god to approach god that way you're going to get in trouble big time because god has a protocol and i find it amazing myself how that people will approach gifted men of god and they they think that they can come however they wish and i i'm reminded of the story that i heard brother billy paul tell and it was of a minister that come to have a private interview with brother branham and brother billy brings the man in and gives him so much time and the man gets up and he comes out walks out the door brother billy paul goes back to brother branham and getting ready to bring the next person in and these were brother branham's comments when billy walks in he said that man is fixing to make the most terrible mistake horrible mistake of his entire life and brother billy said daddy did you tell him he said no he didn't ask me he told me now the man had come in and told brother branham he was going to go here and there and there and travel overseas and be a missionary going to india going here there there so instead of approaching god's gift in the right way he come telling the man of god what he was going to do instead of saying look brother branham this is what i'm feeling led to do what would be your advice now that would have been a total different approach that would have been an approach that would have been acceptable to god then the man would have left a way for the spirit of god to be able to corrected him through that prophetic gift you understand so you see something even like that can change you say why why would god do that because god demands respect now i'm certainly not no prophet certainly not no great spiritual person but over the years i've had so many people come and tell me i feel led to do this and i feel led to do that and i feel led to do that and most of the time when they tell me that unless i feel that urge of the spirit of god i very rarely say anything you know why they have already offended the spirit of god by the way they approached him they have offended the presence of god by overstepping the boundaries of his word and i don't want to offend him by catering to them now if he nudges me then i will say something and i have but there's been so many times that i've sat right there in my office and people would come in i feel led to do this or i'm going to do that and i'm going to do something else and most of the time in my heart i know they're missing god a million miles but unless god nudges me i'll say well god bless you i love you i'll be praying for you hope god will go you say brother donny why would you do that because me offending god's going to get me in trouble you see god has a protocol and that is that we must approach him in the right way now naomi knows that about god and even does so does boaz know that about god but ruth is kind of just learning this new way oh i wish we could be taught i wish god would help us my we we in the message think we know so much we know the thunders and we know the seals and there's all kinds of people that do and they still don't know the divine approach to almighty god god you don't approach god for healing because you've got long hair because you've got a nice long dress and it's decent you approach god by faith you don't approach god well god look at me i look holiness you owe it to me you don't know how to approach god you don't approach god because god owes you anything god owes us nothing it is his mercy that we get anything from god this is why the prophet said that he had seen saints of god walk across the platform and not get healed and watch sinners come across the platform and walk off well why the center knew they was nothing the sinner knew they deserved nothing they were worth nothing but they had enough faith to touch god and that church member walking across with an attitude well god you owe me this and you owe me that and totally miss their healing i want to know god's approach myself now ruth is simply following in a great line of the way this has gone before and many that will follow here after let's look at her her grandson or great-grandson rather in second samuel 12 20 then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel now this setting is of course after david's child has died with bathsheba and the lord told him that he was going to take the child and david fasted and prayed and cried and lamented and now of course the servants come in the doors and they're kind of whispering to one another and they've not yet told david what's happened but david perceives that god has taken the child they asked david to eat when the child was alive he would not do it and no doubt david looked you know totally exhausted and worn out because he'd been petitioning god but now the baby is dead and now what does david do david changes his apparel david changes his look because the look that he had matched one that was in sorrow and mourning and he wanted to appear in the presence of god as one that was afflicted so this is why they would tear their garments so they would come up to the top like this and they would tear their garment and rip their garment as job did and many others and they would reach down and the ashes where a fire had been and they did that as a symbolism of wood which had been in one form now it was changed by fire and they looked at themselves as being the same way that they were one form and then god let trials and tests come and they saw themselves as that piece of wood which had been changed from a carbon form and a live tree now unto a carbon form which had been burnt which had been tested which had been tried so they would take that ashes and put it upon themselves and they would look so different they would look afflicted but that look was fitting for someone needing a touch from god but now david says i need to change my appearance i need to change the way i look because i bore that image and god has not heard me god decided to take me take my son rather now david says that he rise the bible says he rose up from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel notice now the sequence the way that it comes so he washes himself then he is anointed why not anoint yourself before you get washed that's why a sinner cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost you see god is not going to indwell a temple that is filthy and full of a vile rotten nature so god has a divine way of approach so he washed and he anointed himself and he changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshiped now notice it is bringing a complete change did the sorrow of his child been taken was it gone probably not it may have took him years if he ever got over it but yet he saw you know what i cannot bring the child back to me but i can go to the child so i'm gonna go not was being angry at god i'm not gonna go being mad at god but the only way i will be accepted is to approach him notice david is approaching god he's not approaching people well brother what do you think i should do and sister what do you think i should do but he knew this was the right approach to god so he washes and then he anoints himself in order to be pleasant to be around now the anointing of course in the old testament was oil but it was symbolic in the new testament of the spirit of god anointing us so notice he came into the house of the lord and worshiped then came into his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did it so he was fasting he was mournful he no doubt had ashes all over him tears he must have looked like an absolute mess he was clothed with sackcloth but they noticed a change why because his attitude is changed god is not going to raise a child up god is not going to heal the child now i must go on with this portion of my life well he'd realize that the approach to god was not go to the house of god to worship looking like a mourner don't you understand what naomi is instructing ruth what to do ruth was still in her closing of widowhood she was wearing the clothes of a widow now we know our nation used to do that of course whenever a woman would lose her husband then she would put on black and she would wear it for however long however long society deemed it you know necessary to wear it so people would look at her and their children as well and they would see them with black they would see them with an armband on and they would knew that they were a widower well ruth had been wearing these with hood clothes but naomi said look girl if you're going to become a bride you got to change your clothes you got to get them black garments on that old black dreadful thing that's hanging around you you can't worship you can't sing you can't praise god you go to church and you sit there like a bump on a pickle you don't ever raise your hands in the presence of the lord look girl if you're one to get marriage you got to act like a bride not a widow well praise the lord amen notice again in exodus chapter 30 verse 35 that god had a divine protocol for the priests coming into his presence now the priests were called out of the tribe of levi and they were the ones that god had chose they were the tents or the tithing of the tribes they were to be the firstborn in symbol that god would allow to come into his presence but even if that they could not come just however they wished so they could not just say well i'll just pick this out and i picked out and i'll put this on i'll put that and god said nope that's not the way it's going to work i'm going to tell you what to wear i'm going to tell you when to wear it i'm going to tell you what you're going to smell like and i'm going to tell you nobody else in the camp better smell like that because they're going to get in trouble if they do so you see a lot of folks think in the new testament that god threw away all the protocol so that's why they come to god many of them have went to church today around the world and women have worn many skirts into church if they wore any skirt at all many of them have wore shorts to church they come to church looking like sailors are tattooed from the top of their head to the bottom of the little t9c toe and they feel like oh i'm a christian that drinks i'm a christian that smokes marijuana how in the world could you mix him two terms together that's not a child of god oh yes sir brother donny the lord jesus hung around sinners that's right he did his reputation was made among sinners but go ahead and finish the reality of that truth sinners didn't change him he changed the sinners so god today still has a protocol and this is one of the major things of course that separates the bride from the church because the church feels like god will accept just anything they give him you know whatever if they want to come to church looking like who knows what then god will accept that and you know they'll be that way the rest of their life don't don't get in my closet don't get in my music don't get in my movies don't get in my computer i'm a christian but i'm going to do what i'm going to do no you're not a christian because if you are a christian your life belongs to the lord jesus you are not your own you are bought with a price is that right now what if i start to pick up this handkerchief and whenever i do this handkerchief knows exactly where it's hidden it's heading straight from my forehead it's heading straight for the sweat running down beside my sideburns it's heading straight for the sweat popped out on my upper lip and the handkerchief will say no no don't do it don't do it don't do it i can't stand sweat i hate sweat i don't like having your old dirty nasty sweat all over like it or lump it you're my handkerchief like it or lumpy you're my shirt you're going to be wet you're going to be stinking when i get done but you're my shirt well praise the lord lord if the lord jesus wanted to use me for a doormat i'd be wanna be one of the happiest doormats that was ever laid in front of the house of god oh i know some of you feel like you've got the uppity up and you're this and that and the other come on down on the earth with the rest of us dirtbags [Applause] notice what god says in exodus 30 35 thou shall make it a perfume a confection after the art of the apocalyphere tempered together pure and holy and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put it before the testimony and the tabernacle of the congregation so here is a certain perfume and it's going to be in the presence of god and somebody else is going to have a matching fragrance so they're going to have this in the house of god and then the priests are going to be anointed with the same smell now can you imagine the average israelite they never got to wear this smell but they knew who priests were even if they didn't have the robes on you know why they could smell them your imagine when they would get around them and then is that what it smells like in his presence i know who you are he didn't have the bonnet on he didn't have the ephod on he didn't have all the priests garments on but he still had that aroma on him oh it's the kind of child of god thou shalt put it before the tavern the testimony of the tabernacle of the congregation for i will meet with thee and it shall be unto you most holy and as for the perfume which thou shalt make you shall not make it to yourselves now this is not to be commercialized well let me say the same way today the gospel is not to be commercialized either oh it's been commercialized and it'll be commercialized further we go on in time we know that but the real truth of the gospel is not to have money made with it come on saints say amen it is the truth whenever we have to start charging for this and selling coffee and buying donuts and i passed the thing the other day going to the the meetings over and reusing and uh i saw one here in johnson city too well they was going to have the animal shows on a certain certain day i thought i would have pretty much thought that been common every service you know animal shows but yet having animal shows and petting zoos and all kinds of stuff to draw a crowd when we do that it's time to shut up the house of god and go home come on children and as for the perfume which thou shalt make it shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof now the composition was actually a mystery everybody did not know what the composition was but it was given to the prophet from god and then given to the apocaly and the apocalypse was the one that took this composition and molded it together so was it this way that he had will say so much sandalwood and so much myrrh and so much aloes and so much cassia so he take a little bit of church ages and then mix a little bit of the seals and then mix a little bit of justification oh hallelujah you know if i was a lay member and i was looking for a church to go to i wouldn't want to find one that all they preached about was just the seals all the time you might find somebody there the sauce needs to be saved they might need to hear about salvation i wouldn't want to just go to church at all they preach the bible salvation neither because there might be somebody there that needs a holy ghost what i would look for is an apocary which is like what we call today a modern walgreen or cvs now i understand they're experiencing a lot of shortages in our drug stores and that's because a big portion of our drugs come from china well you didn't know that well that's the truth of it so you have to wait for certain certain things but god has an apocary his message of the hour and it has so much healing it's got so much deliverance it's got so much baptism of the holy ghost it's got mysteries it's got deep thought oh somebody i don't want deep down i don't want to be well you complain to god he's the one that had it wrote in his bible apparently mysteries are important to god [Applause] so watch what they do now so they make this perfume praise the lord whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto shall even be cut off so if you die to even smell like a preacher i wonder what you're going to be when you try to impersonate getting in the pulpit and you're not called to do it i'm convinced friends we've got men in this message that say they're called to preach and been more called to preach than a donkey look how they divide the word look at the doctrines look at the messes a lot of them been made don't tell me god calls somebody like that make him an ignoramus well priest mother dawning amen god calls his men and god anoints his men with the composition that he himself chooses for their gift oh man there's things about brother tim pruitt i wish i could make a preacher you know just make a certain preacher so i'd pull so much of brother tim and that i'd pull so much of brother ron and then i'd pull so much of this brother and i would take none of me believe that i'd take none of me but i'd take so much mother daryl and i take so much of this together and i've added all together man what in the world would i get a big square mess you know why because god don't do it the way we want it done god does it the way he wants it done and he sends men and calls them and makes the composition even of their gift and sends them out but to everyone anointed to smell the same way hallelujah [Applause] now notice exodus 40 and verse 9 thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle so here goes moses now let's get that monitor too man that guitar player needs it it's really annoying these drums so when you come in [Music] every priest was not anointed just those that were called into his divine presence some were disqualified they had certain birth defects and this and that they were qualified disqualified they could not receive the anointing oil so here this priest walked in the presence of god and he begins to smell is that me or the house of god both and why in the world people don't don't want to go to church it's beyond me i want you to notice this oil was not used to anoint her kitchen table this oil was not used to anoint their monitor it wasn't used to an onto a computer it was used to anoint the house of god and the worshipers in the house of god so here was something else that pulled them together that identified them as worshipers you're not a worshiper just because you come here this morning you're not a worshiper just because you're sitting in the pew you're a worshiper because you raise your hands and you raise your voice oh some of you will cry some of you may shout god don't want us to be necessarily like individuals god wants us to reflect the composition of the spirit of god in us some of us the holy ghost moves on us we may dance a little bit back and forth while some of you would pass out a few ever dance my you wouldn't know what to even do some of your wife and your kids but you know what we're not wanting you to be like me we don't want you to act like brother daryl or act like somebody else but you want to give the composition of the way that god made you pardon me for saying so but i can see brother jim babb sitting right over on the end of that pew right now with his eyes like this with his hand and his face over his face like this never seen him run never seen him around the backs of the pews but he was a worshiper let me tell you something him and brother gene and all the rest of our loved ones that have crossed over you think they worshipped here you ought to see them now praise be to god why because what they were anointed with that same fragrance is in the sixth dimension you see the holy ghost that he gives you in this life is yours for eternity it will be yours forever a lot of people don't want that i just don't understand friends thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all his vessels notice his his vessels and sanctify the altar and shall be on the altar shall be most holy and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot and sanctify it and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door the tabernacle of congo congregation and wash them with water and thou shalt put upon aaron the holy garments and anoint him notice the order the protocol wash him first and sanctify him that he may minister unto who the priest is not ministering to the people but ministering unto god lord general we could ever get this right we when we come to the house of god i believe it changed us forever we're not here worshipping one another we're not here so that people will think you're spiritual or whatever more we're here ministering to the king of kings we're ministering to the lord so we're worshiping him and we're anointed by the spirit of god and we are ministering lord jesus we worship you we praise you notice proverbs 27 and 9 ointment and perfume rejoice the heart y'all know what aromatherapy is right [Music] it is amazing that smell can be attached to the heart now of course the greek word heart the new testament is cardia which is where we get cardiac and all that from but it was considered by the jews hebrews of the old testament jews of the new that it was the seat of your emotions so fragrance amen could be so moving that the seat of the emotions was moved upon by fragrance if you think that ain't true let somebody in front of you run over a skunk and you follow right in behind that smell how many has ever done it what do you have to do you didn't even run over the dude i mean you wouldn't even you know nowhere clear near of it rather and yet you'll have to roll down your windows many times because your car why is it my car loves that smell why is it that your truck will hold that smell you have to roll down your windows and let that out well i'm going to tell you one thing we and i were stinkers we were stinkers we smell like the devil well praise the lord and remember by the way i'm talking about his old dog and he said boy he'd kill him out there and he said he hated the skunk and he said he'd say get him boy get him get him you'll imagine it brother branham would have nodded amen [Applause] no fritz would have looked back to me and that's all you got billy you want me to go get that skunk and you're nodding well that's the way some of y'all do the preacher look if you want me to get that skunk say so don't just nod at me with a grin say so get him mother daughter get him preacher amen go astray brother brown said he hated a skunk but he said he'd just rattle that bush a little bit get him boy get him and he said the biggest stinker i know of is the devil well i hope you understand that the next one that had the closest claim on us was the devil so what does that make you he's a big skunk you're a litan that's why we acting like the devil we live like the devil we lived in the world and i'll tell you what we stunk and we were nowhere acceptable in the presence of god it was only the mercy of god that would even let us come to an altar and get saved how did he do it through the fragrance of the gospel of jesus christ but after you're called into the body don't think you can come to church with your besetting sins and you're lying and your adulteries and this and that and think he will accept you now you're a priest the protocol is applied differently go to solomon says ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel wow you know a real friend will tell you the truth even if it hurts your feelings oh not my friends they don't ever tell me the truth then they're not really your friends because they know you're a baby and they know you'll pout on them acts chapter 10 verse 37 that word i say you know which was published throughout all judea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached how god anointed jesus god anointed jesus of nazareth isn't it amazing he doesn't call him jesus from eternity jesus from heaven jesus from the seventh dimension jesus of nazareth isn't it amazing how many times you ever noticed in the new testament how many times they kept referring to him as jesus of nazareth that's right you see they had a true revelation they had the epoch of their mix upright they could preach jesus of nazareth they could also preach him being the logos they could preach him being the son of god son of man son of david they had the right mixture from the father's apocalypse [Applause] notice now the lord jesus though he was born the word he was not the messiah until god anointed him when after john washed him john washed him the anointing came on him and the father changed his clothes on mount transfiguration glory be to god the lord jesus following the same pattern that he gives us notice god anointed jesus what was god doing god was saying this is my beloved son this is my messiah my christians i love the hebrew words of this god anointed yeshua with ruach hey kadosha god anointed yeshua with rock you see this is the word in the book of genesis and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the deep and that word spirit is ruach elohim ruach elohim but here is ruach heyday kodesh another attribute of god now the fullness had come down and god is anointing jesus but some of y'all been okay with jesus teaching and him sitting down in a chair which all thought he was anointed the bible says that he sacked [Applause] so imagine he was saying come unto me all you that labor and are heavy lane i'll give you rest but my yoke is easy and my burdens are light and you're sitting and say i've never seen no preacher set well he's our own priesthood brother donald i'll tell you that right now he showed on priests like brother daryl brother ron so we measure people whether they're anointed by whether they preach like brother donahue brother ron or brother darren [Applause] then neither should you judge people because they don't shout the way you shout and say they're not anointed what's that's causing them tears to come out of their eyes what's causing that something to jump inside of their soul and say lord god i love you with all of my heart maybe you're anointed to jump maybe you're anointed to shout they're anointed to cry or as long as i'm anointed brain god as long as i'm anointed to do his service that's what i want [Applause] notice ii corinthians 2 15 now paul's speaking about the ministry and he said for we are unto god a sweet saver look at this word yehudia sweet smelling incense an odor or something sweet smelling an odor of acquiescence satisfaction this is the title given to true gospel preachers and no wonder if satan hates them you see it's an illusion to what we just read about of the priest anointed by the spirit of god and they can come with that anointed word maybe you got a no sire attitude you had pickles for breakfast and snack as a matter of fact you've been on a diet of pickles for 14 days and 40 nights but if you can get under his presence it'll change you from an old dill pickle to a cinnamon roll like fluffy and so sweet takes away that old bad attitude sometimes we need help come on what from what the ministers of god are anointed it's amazing to me how a preacher can tear us one side and down the other rip us up one side and down the other and we barely make it to the car we barely can make it through the drive through but after wobbly go to feeling better and somebody say where you been church you mean that's the way you look every time though sometimes i look worse are you going back you better believe i'm going back attitude off of me it got rid of my temper it got rid of that old rotten thing that i needed off of me yes i'm going back [Applause] [Music] so now ruth's third act of preparation is to change clothes she's to put off the garments of a sorrowing widow and put on the garments of a young lady looking for a man she's no doubt a poor woman but nearly every jew would have had at least one one festive garment you may have a lot of sad days in your life a lot of trials you're facing right now but if you look in your holy ghost closet i dare say you'll find at least one garment of praise you see naomi somehow believed that ruth was to be a bride clothing in the scripture has a spiritual identification we know that that's why we believe we have to dress a certain way in this day you see our parents tried to cover themselves genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit there evan did he and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked so after they ate disciple they decided to cover the sinful part so they made fig leaves and tied around their mouths so they never eat apples again notice the eyes of them both are open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin cloths now the english says aprons but look at the word here it's chogori which is a girdle or a loin covering a long cloth why would you eat an apple and cover with a loin cloth well glory [Applause] and they made themselves aprons out of what fig leaves so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves a loin cloth now notice and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden of the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said her name where art i and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked now they're closed with aprons but still feel naked that's what churchianity will do for you that's what just being religious i'll do for you [Music] now it had covered that certain part of the body of which they were guilty of course but ended amazing brother dale that the apron could not go to the conscious apron could not go to the conscience all it could do would cover a certain part of the flesh but it could not go to the conscience and be able to redeem the conscience from the guilt of disobedience to his word [Music] genesis 3 21 and unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats huh well they got to sew in and made aprons god made coats this word castle ness is a tunic or an undergarment a long shirt like garment huh so the lord god made them a long tunic and no doubt hers has made one way and his has made the other god don't ever break his principles you wouldn't have looked at both of them and said which is a woman well they said well we can't define what a woman is they are birthing people they're administrating people a bunch of idiots [Applause] heathens [Applause] worthy of hell [Applause] we wonder why our nation gone where it's at they've turned down god and now god is turning them down and turning them over to reprobates that they don't even know what a woman is or what a man is and the politicians are afraid to say it well here's one preacher that ain't in the beginning he made them male and female hallelujah that's the bible go ahead and put me on youtube i'm already on there anyhow don't you gonna get us in trouble so what else is new and then to adam also until his husband oh no whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that's the letter c inversion yes wife show me where god ever joined two men together in all mary gays show me where god ever joined two women together now male lesbians it won't be enough for their wings tonight to put out a fire will they i'll be here you'll be all right you will well you we might be able to put that far the skin you imagine every time we looked at it it was god's provision of mercy god went out there and got an innocent animal i had to die now you imagine we're talking about a tunic had to be a pretty good sized sheep where god put them together we don't know exactly what it was how god went about doing it but god the prophet said god throwed it over into them behind the bush because they was over there afraid god i can't look at you god i can't come to church lord have mercy friends if people get nervous being around a preacher if people get nervous and don't want to look at a preacher don't want to be around a preacher can you imagine what it's going to be on the day of judgment when you stand before almighty god an innocent animal had to die that man and woman might have a new beginning and be reminded every day of their life this is my nerve how can we sit here today and say we are the redeemed of the lord we are the church of the living god we are a habitation of the spirit because our garment that we grab ahold of by mercy and we say lord you gave us this new beginning i'm so glad his mercies are renewed every morning myself [Applause] let me find a place to cause them genesis 41 14 then pharaoh sin and call joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in unto pharaoh his prison garments would have not met the protocol to walk in before the king of kings so either the prison guards or someone in pharaoh's court brought joseph some clothes imagine he bathed himself shaved combed his hair put on these garments walked right out of prison into the court of the camp praise be to god you're gonna walk right out of this hill you're gonna walk right out of this laodicea and in a moment be changed in the twinkin of an eye and walk right into the presence of almighty god you see gifts of clothing was the most common gift in the bible that was given to people pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on joseph's hand and raid him investors of fine linen now watch what happens is that after joseph gets into his position will say joseph got saved out of the prison then joseph moves into the land of adoption what he had on was fitting to meet pharaoh but not fitting to be adopted so those of you that are just saying well i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved but you got to move into the land of adoption there's more to this great plan than just preaching the cross 365 days a year there's more than just saying well god sent a prophet there's more to it than that i want to know what he said i know god sent a prophet tell me what he said tell me what to do so noticing joseph now stands there just just shortly out of prison and pharaoh takes his own ring off his finger and slide it over on joseph's hand and he raided him investors are fine now this is a linen that i've told you before in times gone by this linen was worth more than gold it was made from the flax that was grown by the river now that's washed down where the blue and the white nile both come together the top soil as it travels those hundreds of miles and it makes us this beautiful linen and whenever they would wire and the sun would shine on it history records have herodotus and different historians that talk about them when the people would stand on that white linen and the egyptian sun would shine on them you could hardly look at them standing there in glistening white garments praise be to god so from a prison to standing there in white garments let me close i'm reminded of the sardisian church age when the lord jesus promised the rewarding overcomers you shall walk with me in white for you are worthy you imagine brother paul the worthy one speaking to mortals and saying you are worthy why were they dressed in white they were dressed in it here hallelujah fine linen clean and white was granted to her she's been washed in the blood of god's own son let's marry it hallelujah praise the lord maybe there's some under the sound of my voice today and you love the lord jesus with all of your heart but you've never received the holy ghost maybe there's some here today that's maybe never even made the commitment or maybe you have years ago and you've got cold you'd like to be renewed in his presence whatever your need is remember you're not approaching a man we're not approaching happy valley church but we're approaching the king what is the protocol come into his presence with thanksgiving and praise into his courts with praise how'd the prophet tell us to even pray he said don't go to the lord and just start making your requests no not sure if it's an emergency that's one thing but when we come to fellowship with the lord we should start with praise adoration love thanksgiving then start making our needs known don't come with me lord i need this i need that johnny needs that susie needs this billy needs that and fred needs that and donny needs that god is not a sears and roebuck house we're replacing our order but he has a protocol praise the lord praise the lord thank you lord jesus praise the lord i mean it wants to come god's way of protocol raise your heads and look at me there's a suit store about north carolina that i bought some suits from in the past brother joe green told me they was going out of business so the other day i wanted to go over and look and see if they had it so the man that that was there i've talked to him before is an indian man and he's going out of business and long story short he oh yeah i'll make you a good deal make you a good deal so i found some suits there and he said i don't know if you know or not but i have a bridal store right back here he said has some dresses for the lady my lady was standing there by me so i said okay we will we'll go you know we'll look at it so the name of the story was beautiful bride something like that beautiful bride well they had wedding dresses they had veils they had all kinds of things so his wife from that store and so we walked in she said well what can i help you with and carol said well i'm just just looking a little bit just looking they had all kinds of dresses with bling i mean bling a ling a linga lingalin all kinds of stuff and girls i'm not sure i'm gonna find anything in this place but she got to looking and she found a pretty blue dress it was bling-less and just a dressy type of thing to wear to a wedding you know she's not looking for another man i mean y'all's weddings is what i'm talking about so she says can i get this one now if she would have got that dress by and got down in the floor and screamed and pounded it i love her but i would have walked out of there and left her on the floor i wonder how jesus feels when we come to him like beggars not beggars so she found a dress that was befitted for the occasion and she knew the protocol she didn't get mad she didn't throw a fit but she just simply asked so you don't have to come today and as a sinner oh god oh god i'm so wretched i'm so what if you're a sinner come that way but if you're children of god don't come that way come calling him papa oh father i'm your needy child father i've got i've got weaknesses you know i do i've got issues i've got problems i've got worries but i believe you love me and i believe you'll reach out your scepter to me today come on esther can you move past your fear move past your anxiety but what if you want what if he won't guarantee he will esther didn't even have a promise that a hazardous would even reach out his scepter to and if he didn't she's dead but somehow she believed the love she had for him and the love he had for her he would extend his mercy let's not approach him as sinners let's not come to church as people that are ignorant no doubt when we relocate we're going to have visitors galore we will have some that will visit for one time and one time only so brother donnie what are we going to change absolutely nothing we're still singing we're still worshiping we're still preaching the same thing don't look for me to change what i've preached for all these years i'm going to preach the same thing and if there's a seed praise god we're too close to home we're too close to home to change now we'll have some that will come and visit in our midst and we'll come and say lord have mercy on goodness gracious but remember you you still look like that god have pity on you stand again what about it ruth will you listen to instruction i won't get over to it in the very next verse here maybe next week but ruth affirmed to her and said all that you have said i will do no questions no reasoning i don't understand it i just take your word for it amen this bower hits again if you would whatever you have need of today sickness maybe it's an evil spirit that's tormenting you glory to god let's approach him today with this protocol lord jesus is your children father we're coming now into your presence because we have been invited to do so lord god we don't want to be as the shoe am i too just a few days after her wedding she began to feel different and one night when you come knocking on the door you've been out walking and she was awakened by the sound of your voice and you're rapping on the door but yet she was so sleepy she just couldn't get up so she laid there and laid there and slumber finally she got to thinking about it and she got up she went to the door and she said when i took a hold of the handle my hands dripped with myrrh where you had been there wanting to come in she's not approaching you as a sinner but she is now your wife this is a very sad portion of the song of solomon but i'm glad it's there because it helps us to see there'll be times in our life that will get indifferent we'll just layer to see a pressing against us we'll get sleepy as it were and tired which are there still knocking or she went through the night went out and the watchman found her and they beat her she couldn't blame you for that that was her own negligence and she kept saying have you saw him whom my soul loveth i missed him i missed him i was lazy i quit reading my bible i quit praying i couldn't listen to tapes i've got indifferent i've got cold but i'm looking for him she went looking for a church it wasn't looking for a preacher she was looking for you because she had experienced you and after experiencing you what preacher could ever take your place what thing of the world could ever take your place or jesus maybe they're similar today that that's kind of where they feel they are they've just gotten a little bit cold a little bit indifferent but lord they want to be back in fellowship with you again oh jesus my lord oh gentle dove of god coo to us here this morning father it's amazing you can coo to the sick coo to the center coup to the backslider too cool to the indifferent all with a different octave in your voice and make the pull in one call oh jesus oh jesus we worship you this morning lord come and just raise our hands of the presence of the king you need healing he's got it for you you need a renewal of your walk he's got it for you you need a refreshing from the presence of the lord maybe you don't smell like his presence anymore you've been hanging around leia to see you you smell like the wrong kind of music you smell like the world and the filth of the world if you get close to him let him cleanse you you'll begin to smell like him again his mercy his kindness his forgiveness we worship you jesus sing something for us here can we just i ran his presence now don't worry about glory going to lunch don't worry about who you're who you're meeting after church let's just take a few minutes now while we're in the presence of the king oh friends let the spirit of god deal with each of our hearts may begin with me i know i'm telling you i need more of him today i want more of his love more of his mercy more of his kindness more of his understanding i want to be an apothecary that if the lord god sends a sinner here that i'll be the right type of druggist that i by the spirit of god can fill that script and i'll preach acts 2 38 and lead them to repentance if he sends another one and they need the holy ghost i'll be the right kind of pharmacist and i'll preach acts 2 and 4. if he sends another that needs forgiveness on and on and on i want to be that kind of pharmacist if you understand what i'm saying the prophet said that god wrote to us an eternal prescription and he gave it to us by dr simon peter i'm sorry i don't have a script made out in the name of titles all minds made out in the name the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah let's worship him now shall we worship brother donia i don't really need anything this morning well that's good i'm glad god bless you i'll tell you what this me and you just go to his presence and let's just love him maybe you don't have a pressing need and a pressing burden to be honest with you sometimes brother dale i'll have needs in my heart and i won't even mention them to him because i think lord all i ever do is come ask for this and ask for that remember this brother there and this brother friends i'm in contact with people around the world i get prayer requests from around the world almost every day heartbreaking things things that are so terrible and if god don't move there's no way that people will be able to live and survive but sometimes you just think god you're more to me than that i just want to come and love you not ask for this and ask for that and ask for something else can we just love him how many wants to just love him this morning [Music] reaches out to you you're all of joy from morning soaks me makes me and i will go to your secret place to your glory

of you know our precious sister had a fall this week and fell on a piece of rebar and come right there to ride just within inches of of taking our eye out but the mercy of god was whether we're just just going to ask the lord to be western there'll be no no negative things that'll come with this heavenly father lord as i looked at that picture that my brother said it was just heartbreaking but then i looked at it in another way and i thought it's mercy it was mercy given thank you so much lord that you spared our sister we don't always understand why these things happen to us in our life but lord we know that you're with us and you watch over us and you help us even when bad things happen oh lord god we're praying for our sister today father you see this need in her body may there be no evil that will come of this may there be no lasting effects that will be in her sight lord lord god may she be able to testify for the rest of her life that your hand was upon her that you gave her your mercy granted father in jesus name amen did brother lilly mention the sister from brother mike wallace church this morning we certainly want to have a special prayer for her this morning 35 year old sister gave birth to her four child her fourth child and somehow started having things going on in her body and they finally determined that it's a gross prohibiting the blood from flowing up into her brain now she's at this swelling i heard from brother mike this morning before coming to church and the brothers has been there of course day and night saints have been praying from around the world we want to just pray for not only her but her husband the children and the church family can we take her before the throne of god lord jesus you don't always promise us that the bad things will happen to the bad people and only good things will happen to your children but what your promises is you'll make all things work together for good to them that love the lord as i sent brother mike that quote this morning that i've shared with so many down through the years and the prophet talked about a man that was a captain flying a plane his brothers did several of them jim mosley and the man was out flying a plane and the crop dusted and done different things but something happened and he he crashed and he laid in the fire for 10 hours before they could get to him and they couldn't even have a viewing of course at his funeral and the prophet talks about it he said sometimes we just don't understand these things and then he quotes romans 8 28. i'm not glad that situation happened to that brother he had a wife 28 years old had a couple of children that was left behind i'm not glad for the situation that happened but i'm so glad that brother random said even he didn't understand when such things happened and he could still quote romans 8 28. so lord you see this situation with our sister 35 years old young mother of four children now that husband i'm sure must be crying with everything he knows to cry out with believing asking petitioning brother mike lord i know he's a pastor that loves the sheep of god no doubt that church family today they're so broken this is their song leader and his wife we pray for him today father we know enough about you to know that we don't want to ask against your will so if it's your will that this our sister come home then we certainly will accept that and we will know it's the right choice but lord until that happens we're asking you for healing we're asking you for mercy by this stage the doctors have no hope no answers but we know if it be your will even now lord jesus you are the jehovah of miracles so father we ask in the name of jesus your will would be done concerning this situation father and whatever the outcome is whatever the answer is when it comes we will give you thanksgiving and praise knowing that you know best we may not understand all these things on this side but if we still want to know them i'm sure they'll be made clear on the other side we committed to you today father we ask you now that you'd go with us as we depart from this place we say it's been good to be in your house lord thank you for water to wash us thank you for the anointing of the last day message to anoint us father that we can be prepared for our bridegroom go with us now bring us back at the appointed time we pray in the
