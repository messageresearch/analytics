[8:02] timely as we can but you know this is an
[8:05] opportunity that God has given to us I
[8:07] heard a a statement the other day that
[8:09] just was so profound it was very simple
[8:12] but it was so profound to me
[8:15] anyway a man that very famous an old man
[8:20] gave him a poem and in one line of that
[8:24] poem it
[8:25] said whatever you do
[8:28] today make it as
[8:30] positive and as eventful as you can
[8:35] because you're swapping one day of your
[8:37] life for whatever you get done today and
[8:41] I thought you know that's that's quite
[8:43] profound it's very simple but what we do
[8:45] today we're trading the day of our life
[8:47] for it how many of you want to do
[8:49] something real good

[35:57] [Applause]
[36:04] [Music]
[36:23] hallu that was awesome was
[36:27] just wonder what
[36:33] it's often wonder about what it's going
[36:35] to be like when we gather there that day
[36:39] and all the singers that have been down
[36:41] Through the Ages that have used their
[36:42] talent for the Lord won't it be
[36:45] something and it won't be just a few
[36:47] specials it'll be special all the
[36:51] time I realize a lot of folks that don't
[36:54] believe in music in church
[36:57] they have a hard time going to heaven
[36:59] because John saw Harps up there and must
[37:02] have been singing and shouting and
[37:04] praising God and
[37:05] worshiping well we ain't going to work
[37:08] we're not going to argue we're not going
[37:10] to fuss which takes up a lot of our time
[37:12] in life so what are we going to do we're
[37:14] going to worship we're going to praise
[37:16] we're going to I Love The Way the
[37:18] prophet brought it and he said that
[37:21] heaven is a
[37:22] continuation of this same life there'll
[37:25] be avenu in that city parks Rivers
[37:31] streams that we will eat we will plant
[37:35] we will enjoy like it was supposed to
[37:37] been in the Garden of Eden in the
[37:39] beginning except this time there be no
[37:43] sin a't it wonderful what a promise

[41:55] and
[41:58] you know what to me makes that song so
[42:00] good it's not the
[42:03] tune but it's the fact that it's the
[42:07] truth it's not just a mythical song that
[42:10] someone imagined in their mind and wrote
[42:12] but it's the
[42:13] reality of what he done for

[43:08] bring but I trust it'll it'll speak to
[43:11] your heart Luke Chapter 2 we want to
[43:13] read now from verse
[43:15] 8 very familiar scripture to us
[43:19] all the Bible says this there were in
[43:23] that same country shepherds abiding in
[43:25] the field keeping watch over their flock
[43:27] by
[43:27] night and lo the angel of the Lord Came
[43:30] Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[43:32] Shone around about them and they were
[43:35] sore
[43:36] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[43:40] not for behold I bring you good tidings
[43:43] of great joy which shall be to all
[43:47] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[43:50] the city of David a savior which is
[43:53] Christ the lord and this shall be a sign
[43:56] unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped
[43:58] in swaddling clothes lying in a
[44:02] Manger so that he wouldn't looking for
[44:04] him in the Hilton or the Ritz or
[44:07] the cuz he wasn't
[44:10] there you'll find him lying in a manger
[44:14] and suddenly there was with an angel a
[44:16] multitude of heavenly hosts praising God
[44:18] and saying glory to God in the highest
[44:20] and on Earth peace Good Will towards men
[44:24] and it came to pass as the Angels were
[44:26] going away from them into the heaven
[44:28] that the shepherd said one to another
[44:30] let us now go even unto Bethlehem and
[44:33] see this thing which has come to pass
[44:36] which the Lord hath made known to us
[44:40] aren't you glad he's made it known to
[44:42] us and they came with
[44:45] haste that's the way we need to be
[44:47] running they came with haste and found
[44:49] Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a
[44:53] Manger just the way the angel said let
[44:57] us
[45:00] pray heavenly
[45:02] father thank you Lord for loving
[45:06] us we commit this congregation and
[45:08] oursel into your hands For Your Glory in
[45:13] Jesus name God bless you you may be
[45:16] seated this
[45:17] morning you know we are indeed a
[45:20] privileged
[45:21] people to be alive this morning and to
[45:24] come to this
[45:27] church on the
[45:29] eve of
[45:31] Christmas gathering here with a group of
[45:34] believers who have a revelation of what
[45:37] Christmas really is and what it means to
[45:40] us you see Christmas to so many people
[45:43] means so many different things Christmas
[45:46] to some means Santa Claus and reindeer
[45:49] and elves to others its families and
[45:52] Gatherings and food and
[45:54] laughter
[45:56] to others it's a depressing time because
[45:59] of memories of better Christmases
[46:02] past or because they don't have the
[46:04] means to provide gifts for their family
[46:07] or for their
[46:08] friends but is that really all that
[46:11] Christmas is just a festive holiday just
[46:13] an
[46:14] event but you know I believe all real
[46:17] Christians know what the world has made
[46:21] Christmas isn't Christmas at
[46:24] all and the fact of all the eror the
[46:27] prophet said in everything there is
[46:29] about it there's something about it that
[46:30] the world tries to make it an exmas you
[46:33] know they try to take Christ out of the
[46:35] whole thing all right and we know that's
[46:37] true I was getting off a plane the other
[46:39] day when I was preaching up in Michigan
[46:41] as I pass the stus at the door she said
[46:44] happy holiday because to say Merry
[46:47] Christmas is Politically
[46:50] Incorrect but no matter what they tried
[46:52] to do to Christmas God still got a
[46:55] Christmas in in it somewhere hasn't he
[46:57] he sure has the prophets said he's got
[46:59] something about it the very names and
[47:01] thoughts of the birth of the Lord Jesus
[47:03] said oh the world puts a Santa Claus in
[47:05] this place sure the world has made it an
[47:07] exmas and a happy holiday but not the
[47:11] Christians to the Christian it's still a
[47:14] Christmas you see Christmas is not a
[47:17] celebration but it is and it should be a
[47:20] day of
[47:22] worship because we all know that Christ
[47:24] was not born in December Brother Don
[47:27] saying in this prayer but somewhere in
[47:28] April or May or something like that but
[47:31] the prophet said it this way he said
[47:32] what difference does it make see today
[47:35] we are even if they was doing it in July
[47:37] or in August or whenever it might be
[47:40] it's still the sacredness of remembering
[47:43] that God gave us the hope that we have
[47:47] in us Christmas Is A Day to Remember to
[47:51] Remember what Christmas did for us and
[47:54] that's my message this morning for just
[47:57] a few minutes I want to speak to you on
[48:00] Christmas
[48:04] Memories last night we had my family
[48:08] it's Christmas and we gathered together
[48:10] over at CB's
[48:12] house and we took time we went around to
[48:15] each one and gave them an opportunity to
[48:18] tell their favorite Christmas
[48:22] memory and as people begin to talk we
[48:24] cried so and we laugh some because
[48:28] there's just something about
[48:31] remembering that it warms the heart you
[48:35] see as long as you remember that
[48:38] person's still in your
[48:39] heart and as long as you can remember of
[48:42] Christmas that memory it'll warm your
[48:45] heart and I say let this Christmas Eve
[48:49] this time to take some time to set aside
[48:53] to slip off somewhere and to
[48:56] remember Christmas Memories you say what
[49:00] should I remember remember a promise
[49:03] that God made us for he said in Isaiah
[49:06] 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us
[49:09] a son is given and the government shall
[49:11] be upon his shoulders and his name Shall
[49:13] be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[49:15] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[49:19] Peace we remember Isaiah 7:14 therefore
[49:22] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[49:25] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[49:28] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[49:31] right we remember the promise of numbers
[49:34] 24:17 I shall see him but not now I
[49:37] Shall Behold Him but not n th shall come
[49:40] a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall
[49:44] rise out of
[49:46] Israel Christmas Memories that first
[49:49] Christmas was the Fulfillment of the
[49:51] coming Messiah spoken by the prophets of
[49:55] God
[49:56] that first Christmas was the Fulfillment
[49:58] of their prophecy showing that what God
[50:01] spoke to them was the truth and in
[50:04] Matthew we find speaking of Joseph that
[50:07] while he thought on these things behold
[50:08] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[50:10] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[50:13] David fear not to take unto thee marry
[50:16] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[50:18] her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall
[50:20] bring forth a son and they shall call
[50:23] his name Jesus for he shall save his
[50:26] people from their sins now all this was
[50:30] done that it might be
[50:32] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[50:35] by the prophet saying Behold a virgin
[50:37] shall be with child and shall bring
[50:40] forth a son and that shall call his name
[50:42] Emmanuel which being interpreted is god
[50:45] with us we remember the first Christmas
[50:49] This Morning When Heaven and Earth
[50:51] United in Flesh and Bones wrapped in a
[50:54] swaddl
[50:56] cloth and laid in a Manger you see
[51:00] Christmas gave us an everlasting
[51:04] sign we remember the
[51:07] humanity and the deity of Jesus for he
[51:11] was both all God and all
[51:14] man hallelujah what was it Christmas
[51:17] gave us an everlasting son Jehovah God
[51:21] became man the prophet said he took our
[51:23] stock and costed himself from God and
[51:25] become man there's the sign he was God
[51:29] and became man not rich man but a poor
[51:31] man this is the super sign you asked for
[51:34] a sign said God I'll give you an
[51:37] everlasting sign the prophet said he
[51:40] could have come otherwise as I've said
[51:42] but a baby why did he become a baby when
[51:44] that first little toothless mouth opened
[51:47] it it mouth in the manger on that first
[51:49] Christmas morning in his little manger
[51:51] crib and the first little yell that went
[51:53] from his voice that was God God crying
[51:57] Jehovah crying a man come from God who
[52:00] was a man every WI a man but he come to
[52:02] the world with nothing but still a man
[52:04] what was he trying to do what was he
[52:06] purposing he cried like a baby in the
[52:08] manger he played like a boy on the
[52:10] street he told like a man but yet he was
[52:14] Emmanuel Hallelujah this is the super
[52:17] sign God dwelling in the creation that
[52:20] he created let me say that again this is
[52:24] the super sign God dwelling in the
[52:26] creation that he created this shall be a
[52:31] sign unto you amen that first Christmas
[52:34] morning it was an eternal sign to the
[52:36] believer that God is with us the super
[52:39] sign do you see it this morning God made
[52:42] Manifest this Christmas Eve 2,000 years
[52:46] later that super sign is still being
[52:51] manifested
[52:53] hallelujah hallelujah God dwelling in
[52:55] the creation that he created God In the
[52:58] Flesh of his bride as we remember it's
[53:01] no longer Christ in a Manger but it's
[53:04] Christ in you
[53:06] amen hallelujah in the manger scene of
[53:10] Bethlehem of 20000 years ago is now
[53:12] being played out in 2023 In The Word of
[53:16] Life church amen as I heard brother
[53:20] Donnie say many many years ago way back
[53:22] in the 80s preaching a message on
[53:24] Christmas he said if I was going to put
[53:26] a major scene in my yard it wouldn't be
[53:29] Campbell and wise men he said I just go
[53:32] out there and lay down
[53:35] myself Hallelujah CU that's where Christ
[53:38] is
[53:40] today
[53:42] Hallelujah Christmas Memories remember
[53:45] that the wise men saw the star the star
[53:50] that balam prophesied would rise out of
[53:52] Jacob they knew the conditions was right
[53:55] for the star to appear brother benam
[53:58] said they were
[54:00] stargazers they constantly went around
[54:03] looking
[54:04] up I think we spend too much time
[54:08] looking
[54:09] down we spend too much time feeling
[54:13] down you said why do you say that
[54:15] because the Bible said when we see these
[54:18] things coming to pass lift up our heads
[54:23] for our Redemption draw now these wise
[54:26] men brought gifts to the young Tri
[54:28] Christ child for Jesus was 2y old when
[54:32] they found him in the house with Mary
[54:35] and the gifts that they brought for him
[54:37] was very
[54:39] appropriate for the gifts testified that
[54:42] the wise men had a revelation of who he
[54:45] was oh I'm so glad I've gathered here
[54:48] this morning with wise men and wise
[54:50] women who have a revelation
[54:52] [Applause]
[54:54] amen for the very gifts that they
[54:57] possessed testified of who he was and
[54:59] let me say this morning what we bring to
[55:02] this service testifies of what your
[55:05] Revelation is of him amen the Bible said
[55:09] when they came they opened from their
[55:11] Treasures in other words they gave him
[55:13] the best that they had they didn't give
[55:16] him a second hand but they gave him of
[55:18] their best and that's how we ought to
[55:21] come not just on Christmas Eve but into
[55:23] the house of God every service we should
[55:26] give him the best that we have the best
[55:28] amen the best Hallelujah the best praise
[55:31] not a secondhand praise not a half
[55:33] Abberly praise but everything that we
[55:35] have that when we leave these doors we
[55:37] can say this day this day I have given
[55:40] my all for Jesus
[55:42] Christ Hallelujah we ought to Give Him
[55:45] worship and praise not a secondhand
[55:48] praise but from the very depths of our
[55:50] heart it ought to be The Treasure of our
[55:53] hearts that we give to him this
[55:57] Christmas Eve what are you looking for
[55:59] wise men and Wise Women today still
[56:02] follow a
[56:04] star
[56:06] amen amen I saw one time someone was
[56:11] bashing the message on a on a
[56:15] chat and they said I'm so glad that I
[56:19] don't follow a dead
[56:22] man I couldn't take that
[56:25] I said are you serious did you really
[56:28] text that you mean you don't follow the
[56:31] teachings of Paul and Peter and John
[56:33] them guys have been dead for thousands
[56:35] of
[56:36] years and about the dumbest I ain't the
[56:39] sharpest knife in the drawer but that's
[56:42] dumb I'm so glad that we're with wise
[56:45] men and women today who still follow a
[56:47] star the seventh star that was in the
[56:49] right hand we have seen his star and
[56:53] where is it leading us this leading us
[56:55] to where the word is made
[56:59] flesh Christmas
[57:02] Memories we all have them a memory of a
[57:05] Christmas that we would say that was one
[57:08] of the best Christmases I ever had or a
[57:11] memory of a present that we
[57:14] received all of us has those kind of
[57:17] memories I remember as a boy when
[57:19] Christmas we were
[57:21] poor we didn't get a lot not a lot of
[57:28] presents and I was wanting the
[57:31] football and you know you just you only
[57:34] got about one good present you know it
[57:37] just and mom and dad gave me the present
[57:39] and I remember I was wanting a just a
[57:42] kid but I was wanting a
[57:43] football and I opened up the package and
[57:46] it was a box and I I can't even remember
[57:48] what was on the
[57:50] box but boy was I
[57:53] disappointed because I was thinking the
[57:55] present was a
[57:57] football but the outside of the box said
[58:00] something
[58:02] else and I guess this look of
[58:04] disappointment on my
[58:07] face God rested her
[58:10] soul I remember my mama looking at me
[58:12] she must have I didn't say anything but
[58:15] I just remember Mama looking at me she
[58:18] goes look in the
[58:23] box and when I open up the
[58:27] box it was a
[58:34] football
[58:37] amen it wasn't what the package looked
[58:40] like that made it so precious to me but
[58:44] what made it so precious to me was what
[58:47] was in
[58:48] it I just heard on the radio this week
[58:51] of a of a lady at Goodwill brought a
[58:53] vase it wasn't it wasn't even really a
[58:55] pretty vase but the colors of the vase
[58:57] kind of matched her rooms so she bought
[58:59] it at the
[59:00] Goodwill and she sold it I believe it
[59:03] was for over
[59:06] $140,000 yes sir that she got at
[59:09] Goodwill yes sir because it wasn't what
[59:12] the vase looked like that made it so
[59:14] valuable yeah but what made this vase so
[59:18] valuable was the name that was on the
[59:23] vessel right
[59:25] in the Civil War they placed this
[59:28] Soldier before a firing squad they going
[59:30] to execute him for leaving his post of
[59:32] Duty but this man had a friend and he
[59:34] went to Abraham Lincoln he said I know
[59:37] this man he's a good man he just got
[59:38] scared in battle and he
[59:40] ran said please don't take his life he's
[59:43] got a family and Abraham Lincoln just
[59:45] pulled out a piece of paper and wrote I
[59:47] Abraham Lincoln president of the United
[59:49] States pardons this man such a date and
[59:52] signed it have the man goes running to
[59:55] the to his friend who was to be executed
[59:57] and said look what I have for you and he
[59:59] grabbed a piece of paper and he looked
[1:00:01] at it and he said don't mock me don't
[1:00:03] make fun of me get out of my
[1:00:06] cell said if that was Abraham Lincoln it
[1:00:08] would be a presidential seal it would be
[1:00:11] White House stationary it's just a piece
[1:00:14] of paper had he refused to receive it
[1:00:17] yeah and they took the man and executed
[1:00:20] him and then they had a trial why was
[1:00:22] this man executed when the president of
[1:00:25] the United States had pardoned him and
[1:00:27] they came to this judgment that a person
[1:00:30] is only pardoned right if it's received
[1:00:34] that's right as a
[1:00:36] pardon you see he was only seeing the
[1:00:41] paper not the
[1:00:44] signature Christ like the Bible says he
[1:00:46] had no
[1:00:48] beauty that we should desire him but
[1:00:51] when you look in the package amen oh you
[1:00:54] find he was the gold of God he was the
[1:00:57] greatest carrot Diamond he was that
[1:01:00] pearl of great price not because of what
[1:01:03] he looked like but because of the name
[1:01:06] that the vessel revealed amen he was
[1:01:10] God's present to you God gave you a
[1:01:13] present and it came from his heart you
[1:01:16] see when God gave us Jesus Christ he
[1:01:19] gave us his very heart for Christ was
[1:01:21] the very Heart Of God revealed
[1:01:25] amen an appropriate gift an appropriate
[1:01:29] gift for a dying Humanity that's right
[1:01:33] God gave us life
[1:01:38] amen Christmas
[1:01:41] Memories remember that first
[1:01:44] Christmas that God showed us his
[1:01:47] love for God so loved the world that he
[1:01:50] gave his only begotten son that
[1:01:51] whosoever shall believeth in him shall
[1:01:53] not perish but have everlasting
[1:01:56] life 1 John 4:9 and this was manifested
[1:01:59] the love of God towards us because that
[1:02:01] God s his only begotten son into the
[1:02:04] world that we might live through
[1:02:09] him the love of God the prophet say how
[1:02:11] God unfolded himself and become a
[1:02:13] Christmas package and was laid on straw
[1:02:16] the first thing he had to press against
[1:02:17] his little head was straw and a dirty
[1:02:19] piece of swaddling cloth wrapped around
[1:02:21] him and the last thing he had was a
[1:02:22] thorn crown and a dirty rag wrapped over
[1:02:25] his eyes and hit on the head saying if
[1:02:27] you're a prophet tell us who hit you and
[1:02:29] then they tacked him to a cross love
[1:02:31] reaching out when his own children
[1:02:32] crying for his blood and he scream
[1:02:35] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:02:38] what they're doing right that's love you
[1:02:41] see the church don't want that they want
[1:02:42] Creed but we need love the church is
[1:02:46] dying by Creeds but it can only live by
[1:02:50] love amen because love is etern eternal
[1:02:55] life love overcomes all things love is
[1:03:00] the most powerful force there is that's
[1:03:03] right brother B said Satan is hate Satan
[1:03:08] is hate but God GL is
[1:03:13] love why do we give presents to each
[1:03:16] other at Christmas time why do we do
[1:03:19] that brother brandham explains it so
[1:03:22] well he said we're giving you a little
[1:03:24] present this
[1:03:25] morning because it's letting you know
[1:03:27] that one time God gave the greatest
[1:03:29] present that could ever be given to the
[1:03:31] human race his son and we have a poor
[1:03:34] way of expressing it and there's nothing
[1:03:36] that we can give that will compare to
[1:03:38] that but just as Mortals to one another
[1:03:42] we do that we give gifts in
[1:03:46] remembrance of what he gave
[1:03:49] us an appropriate gift that God the
[1:03:53] Creator could give to his creation would
[1:03:56] be a savior to save us from the
[1:03:59] condition we was
[1:04:01] in but said I wonder this morning as
[1:04:03] we're approaching Christmas now if we
[1:04:05] could take a moment on these
[1:04:08] things and
[1:04:10] remember
[1:04:12] Christmas
[1:04:14] Memories that first Christmas the
[1:04:16] Shepherds in their fields received a
[1:04:18] visitation from an angel that told them
[1:04:21] of his great gift that was given to the
[1:04:22] world and where they could find the
[1:04:25] place where the word was made flesh
[1:04:29] deity revealed in humanity there wasn't
[1:04:33] looking for him in Jerusalem they knew
[1:04:35] he would be found in Bethlehem the house
[1:04:37] of God's bread because you see he came
[1:04:40] to where his name was oh God what a
[1:04:45] revelation he came to where his name was
[1:04:50] what did Satan do in the first church
[1:04:51] age what did he do to try to shut the
[1:04:53] church down he took the name of Jesus
[1:04:56] away from the church and gave them
[1:04:58] titles come on somebody and for years
[1:05:01] they baptized and titles but what has
[1:05:03] God done for us in this end time he has
[1:05:05] restored to us the name there is power
[1:05:09] in the name of
[1:05:11] Jesus Hallelujah he comes to where his
[1:05:15] name is he come oh Hallelujah he comes
[1:05:19] to where his name
[1:05:22] is amen spend your time looking for him
[1:05:25] to where he's
[1:05:27] not but you'll find him to where his
[1:05:29] name is the Shepherds were told you'll
[1:05:31] find him in a Manger wrapped in
[1:05:33] swaddling cloth in Bethlehem and where
[1:05:36] do we find him today we find him where
[1:05:39] the word says He will be right amen
[1:05:43] where will we find him where his name
[1:05:47] is well Glory get too many amens out of
[1:05:50] that but that's all
[1:05:51] right we'll find him where the word says
[1:05:55] He will
[1:05:56] be where his name
[1:06:00] is
[1:06:02] amen the headship and the body has
[1:06:04] become one unit it's God manifested in
[1:06:07] his people that's the reason that the
[1:06:09] husband and wife is no longer Twain
[1:06:11] they're one God and his church is one
[1:06:14] Christ in you God's Great Revelation
[1:06:18] glory to God even bearing his name his
[1:06:21] name is Jesus the anointed the reason he
[1:06:24] is called Jesus he is the anointed and
[1:06:27] it's the anointed Body of Christ proving
[1:06:30] manifesting God just like that body
[1:06:34] did the same anointing that was upon the
[1:06:37] groom with the same name that same
[1:06:40] anointing is upon the bride who has been
[1:06:42] given the same name for all Hallelujah
[1:06:45] he said the prophet said she will be
[1:06:47] known as mistress Jesus Christ the
[1:06:50] family name of God in heaven and on
[1:06:53] Earth we baptize in that name we pray in
[1:06:55] that name we live in that name we sing
[1:06:57] in that name we preach in that name and
[1:07:00] we will Rapture in the name of
[1:07:04] Jesus and you'll find him today where
[1:07:07] his name
[1:07:09] is
[1:07:11] hallelujah oh my
[1:07:16] Hallelujah the package didn't look like
[1:07:18] much no beauty that we should desire him
[1:07:22] but the greatest thing that was ever
[1:07:24] wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it
[1:07:27] God himself wrapped his own self in a
[1:07:31] Christmas package and sent it to the
[1:07:35] world God gave himself as a
[1:07:39] Christmas
[1:07:41] package it was an appropriate gift for
[1:07:47] dying
[1:07:52] humidity
[1:07:55] amen yes sir that first Christmas
[1:07:57] morning when Christ was
[1:07:59] born what was it God the Creator created
[1:08:03] a second Adam a virgin birth a perfect
[1:08:07] lamb who could take the curse off of
[1:08:10] Adam's race and free us from our
[1:08:15] sins the love of God that God had for
[1:08:18] Adam and his race how God unfolded
[1:08:22] himself and
[1:08:24] as a
[1:08:25] Christmas package Mary on that first
[1:08:29] Christmas morning took and wrapped that
[1:08:31] child in a swaddling cloth and lay in a
[1:08:36] Manger but I wonder if she really
[1:08:41] knew what all was in that Christmas
[1:08:46] package did she know that because of
[1:08:49] this Christmas
[1:08:50] package that the blood will see
[1:08:57] Hallelujah that may not mean so much to
[1:08:59] some people but when you've had a child
[1:09:01] that was blind and you got a promise in
[1:09:04] the word hallelujah that he come to Open
[1:09:07] the Eyes of the blind
[1:09:10] amen did she know that in this package
[1:09:13] that God wrapped had sent to Earth the
[1:09:15] blind would see the death will hear the
[1:09:18] dead will live
[1:09:19] again the L will leap the DB will speak
[1:09:23] the Praises of the lamb Mary did you
[1:09:26] really know as the song says that when
[1:09:29] you was kissing that little baby's cheek
[1:09:32] he was kissing the very face of
[1:09:36] God I wonder sometimes when we shake one
[1:09:38] another's hand do we really see who our
[1:09:42] brother
[1:09:44] is do we really see who our sister is
[1:09:49] you see those Jews didn't want to
[1:09:51] believe they were unbelievers they
[1:09:53] thought they were saved but God knew
[1:09:54] they needed a savior they were praying
[1:09:57] for a
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:10:00] warrior but God gave them a
[1:10:03] baby a savior he knew what they needed
[1:10:08] just like he knows what we
[1:10:12] need
[1:10:14] amen that was her Christmas present
[1:10:17] that's what you need today that's what I
[1:10:18] need today is a savior from my unbelief
[1:10:21] a savior from your unbelief we need a
[1:10:24] savior to save us from
[1:10:29] ourselves for our greatest
[1:10:32] enemy our greatest
[1:10:35] enemy is
[1:10:37] ourselves and God gave us a Christmas
[1:10:40] package to save us from ourselves thank
[1:10:44] you

[1:11:12] package was not placed under a
[1:11:16] tree but this great Christmas
[1:11:19] package God placed it on a tree
[1:11:24] the reason his present is not under the
[1:11:28] tree is because that's where you give
[1:11:30] your present to him

[1:35:06] packages in my life from different
[1:35:09] people as you have and sometimes you
[1:35:12] open them up and think what were they
[1:35:17] thinking and then you're so glad that
[1:35:20] little receipt is inside there where you
[1:35:21] can take it
[1:35:23] back but he is the only Christmas
[1:35:27] package that I ever got that was

[1:35:55] today it's in the
[1:35:58] package I'm not sure still brother John
[1:36:01] that we really understand what it meant
[1:36:04] to him to come to the Earth and have
[1:36:06] fellowship and Carol told me that the
[1:36:08] other day and I told her said you know
[1:36:09] it's astounding to me because the
[1:36:11] prophet said that the Lord Jesus did not
[1:36:14] want to leave his
[1:36:17] disciples can you imagine that
[1:36:21] what he was
[1:36:23] before where he came
[1:36:26] from what it was like and when he come
[1:36:29] down here and was able to have
[1:36:31] Fellowship like that for the very first
[1:36:33] time that way he was having a hard
[1:36:38] time to go back to
[1:36:42] Heaven you think you want fellowship
[1:36:45] with
[1:36:45] him that's only half the
[1:36:48] story he wants it with you so bad
[1:36:51] Hallelujah and he made a way so we could
[1:36:55] go back with
[1:36:57] him aren't you
[1:37:00] glad I'm so glad one day the spirit of
[1:37:02] God dealt with my heart your
[1:37:06] heart so we would be able to go up to
[1:37:08] the
[1:37:09] tree didn't have balls hanging on it
[1:37:13] rope or any that sort of
[1:37:15] thing it was a man hanging on
[1:37:19] it his eyes were nearly swell
[1:37:23] shut his lips swollen his head
[1:37:26] swollen because of the crown of Victor
[1:37:29] Thorns that they call it 6 to9 Ines long
[1:37:33] stuck in his head and there was God's
[1:37:37] great Christmas
[1:37:41] gift even before he took his last breath
[1:37:44] he was giving out the contents father
[1:37:47] forgive them for they don't know what
[1:37:50] they're doing
[1:37:51] and the
[1:37:54] thief you imagine you and I wouldn't
[1:37:57] even consider what he said a prayer of
[1:37:59] repentance as a matter of fact he didn't
[1:38:01] even say I'm sorry one time he didn't
[1:38:04] mention the word forgive me one
[1:38:07] time but he said remember
[1:38:10] me remember me sir and the Lord Jesus
