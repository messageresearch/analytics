be with you tonight and bring you greetings from uh Believers over in North Carolina our home Church there with brother Josh minut pastors and the Lord blessed me uh not working this week so I was able to come over and help with the relief effort and I I really commend what's being done here um I think of when Esther was was there uh as a queen and her her people were in Peril and I believe it was her uncle came to her and said for such a time as this and in that time of Crisis her true identity was revealed and her people were saved and I believe this is the hour when the bride of Christ our true identity is being made known and we're not just a queen sitting on the throne to look pretty but we're we're here to serve amen and so it's it's a privilege to be able to serve with you and we also realize with what's going on in the world many are gripped with fear and anxiety but for us it's a signal it's about time to leave so I want to play this little song If you know it sing along and I told Brother uh Brother Louie put me up to this and uh and and brother Aaron is in cahoots with him so I said I will play if brother Donnie will sing so but let's Worship the Lord together

the fields of [Music] sin bring the little ones to Jesus I was hoping he wasn't going to look like that ugly daddy of his but poor little fell maybe he'll grow out of [Music] it INSP This Together dear Jesus what a great joy it is to be able to hold a little child in my arms to be able to bring it before you father a mother and father that assumed this great responsibility to bring forth children in this evil day Lord I pray that you would just help them make my sister The Fifth Gospel the gospel of mother may this little boy be able to hear Mama praying crying singing the voice of the Prophet being played in the home maybe able to hear Daddy instructing and instilling righteousness father we know much of what they become come is what we put into them they want to bring him back to you tonight Lord because they believe it was you that gave them to him to their Union I pray that you'd be with him keep him from the darkness of the evils and diseases and plagues of humanity today if he would be old enough to be able to give his heart to you Lord when he's young and tender deal with him I pray father we dedicate his life to you tonight in the name of Jesus Amen [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord let's Stand Together isn't it an honor to be able to gather together Amen on a Wednesday night to be able to come to the house of God and hear the word sing share testimonies of What the Lord Has Done and just it's just a Wonder to go to church I love to be in the house of God I'm kind of strange I generally keep my time schedule and everything by church right so when I don't go to church on Wednesday or Sunday if you're gone somewhere you know it messes up my whole week I don't even what day of the week it is I know a lot of people would think that is so strange and peculiar I considered an honor actually that I I I judge my week and where I'm at in the week by being able to assemble together with the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a great honor isn't it amen Let's uh turn to Jeremiah chapter 5 now the last time I preached on the lad rain best I remember is about two weeks ago on Wednesday night little did we know we was going to have office floods and everything going on so I hope everybody ain't going to leave tonight cuz I'm going to preach on latter of rain again tonight so but part of what I told you two Wednesday nights ago is already coming to pass out here in our grounds y'all seen this grass how it's coming up and all of its beautiful green and all that that's exactly the way we want the Lord to do our lives with the latter reign of the Holy Ghost Jeremiah 5 verse 24 neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord Our God that give us rain both both the former and the latter in his season he reserve unto us the appointed weeks of the Harvest so it's God that determines the sewing time the planting time and also the reaping time Hosea 6:3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain so we don't want just a move of God we want God a God that's who we want and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former Reign unto the Earth Joel 2: 23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice and the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign now notice the intensity of the former Reign moderately he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so prophetically there will come a time now you notice the prophecy of Joel is a little bit different than Jeremiah and Hosea that there will come a time whenever there will be both the former and the latter falling at the same time what is former moay teaching rank so at the end time which is the time we're living right now it will come forth both rains will come in the exact same season we're in a special time amen amen we're going to pray how many like to be remembered tonight got a need request on your heart also I was contacted by a friend of mine and also uh some brothers here in the church brother JJ Selena him and his wife had a newborn baby and they've had to take that baby to the hospital he having some type of seizures and not very old at all and they wanted us to to pray for him um I certainly want you to continue to pray for all of those that have been affected by this flood in our region and I'm sure that you know another hurricane hurricane Milton is heading toward Florida tonight and they're saying could possibly be the worst one that they've had 103 years something like that since ju is H Tampa area and they're just not sure exactly of course what he's going to do we believe God can still move in the storms are been on also I'd like for you if you would to remember all of those that are volunteering and coming over and helping and uh many of these uh Saints are coming day in and day out and again as your pastor I I just I just admonish you don't don't get over overwhelmed with all this if you need a break take a break if you need to trade out with somebody um you know the subconscious is able to take things in and sometimes the first conscience is not always aware of what's going on and we go to building up in our spirit and loading up in our subconscious and we don't even realize what we're doing and then we feel ourselves so despondent and in such Despair and we're kind of figure out what in the world it is so just just just be careful if you need to take a break from what you're doing um for the for those of you that have not been in some of these um these areas it's just unbelievable I've been U couple of days this week and it's just it's just catastrophic it's just more than you can describe um cameras video cameras don't do it any justice at all a human being is not made to take but so much catastrophe and crisis so please some of you are giving some of you are coming and working and we so appreciate that cuz we couldn't do it without the response of all the people but please don't remember those that are coming over and some of our brothers has taking off work and they're going every day to deliver all this wouldn't do us any good have all these Goods over here if we didn't have a way to be able to get it out to the people so pray for them and the sisters are here and I mean it's just it's just awesome what's going on and we're we're so grateful for it so would you please remember them as well Lord Jesus we count it such an honor that we would be able to gather here Lord once again I think of my brothers and sisters in communist China I remember when I've been there before and just a knock on the door in the hotel room it's totally different than the feeling that you get here because not knowing that they're coming to get you to throw you in jail and then Lord thinking of Vietnam other places where we have actually helped Brothers rent tourist Vans and little did they know the tour guide was a preacher and there was people interested in the message and they would go around in these communist places and they would be preaching the message of the hour under the opes of a tour God of course really ever Holy Ghost fil man is a tour guide he takes us through the historical sites of the scripture he takes us through the the present sites and he points us to the Future ones so Lord we count it such a great honor that we could gather here while freedom is still in our nation we could come here tonight and worship and sing and pray and we don't ever want to take that for granted Lord you see our needs father would you be mindful of us God I pray for brother JJ and his wife little baby father the little child can't believe for itself but we're asking you tonight as the people of God lord be mindful of our our friends dear friends Lord down in Florida several churches in that area brother Danny Steven and his church all gathered together tonight in their Church Father just waiting and praying God be merciful to them would you Lord May the spirit of God have mercy on them Father then Lord we think of all this territory here in our own country Lord we thank brother Jeff snog been with us tonight brought different things down to distribute it's just absolutely overwhelming Lord the love of God on the people of God's hearts all that's that's happening father help us I pray I pray for everyone Lord that's coming here some of these mothers bringing their children and bringing their schoolwork and Lord grandmothers coming and babysitting with their grandchildren while the mothers can be able to sort out the food and then the brothers taking it out Lord me seeing some of the places where they've been and treacherous roads where they're driving I pray you'd watch over every one of them Father would you bless them Lord Lord Jesus now we come to the breaking forth of your word help me that I can get out of the way Lord speak to us tonight the words of Life In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we ask it and the church said amen amen God bless you you may be seated we certainly know that the Harvest that we're looking to in this last day well all depends on the type of seed that have been sewn in the ground now we know that of course from the natural sense of looking around and seeing that living in the Harvest time now October here in this part of the part of the earth a lot of the farmers that have uh already cut their corn for silage one right down the road here and I saw them a week or so ago as they was making one pass after another dug out a big place in the ground ground there they would shovel it over into their wagon come and dump it out it'll lay there during the cold winter months and they will take the tarp off of it as they need it spread it out to their cattle other farmers are going around with the second some of them the third cut of hay others are cutting their corn they're shelling it others are doing different things driving in different parts of the country down through South Carolina the other day and seeing soybeans that was a harvested cotton that was still there and not yet fully harvested so looking at it in the natural we can see that we're in a harvest time even in the season where we live how much more spiritually are we in the Harvest Time which is the end time now God has had many different different Harvest Cycles it was in the days of Enoch was in the days of Noah was in different time frames of course dispensation and we know that God at the the end of every Church age God would send a messenger that messenger would come and rebuke that former Church age and he would tell them where they was wrong try to lead them back to repentance for the most part it was too late for many of them but he would come with a message that would be able to be able to bring something in the hearts of the elect of God at it was adding to the mystical body that God had been forming and now we believe that we are at the very end of this Harvest cycle of the Gentiles so what are we dealing with in the hour that we're in now we can look around and we can see all types of different churches and we've seen many of them as we've been going out and helping and I thank God for absolutely every one of them we went to a Pentecostal church today we went to a Presbyterian church today we pass Baptist Church we've passed all kinds of churches and they're opening their buildings to be able to receive Food you know all types of things to help the people of their Community I appreciate every one of them don't you and you realize that some of them are actually doing their Community a greater service now than they've done for the type of spiritual food that they've handed out for the past 50 years because they're handing them out bread that's got an expiration date on it you know why cuz we took some of it to them so they're handing out potato chips and they're handing out Cheerios and they're handed out all kinds of things but there's a date on that macaroni and cheese box there's a date on that Ragu bottle but they don't realize when they get behind the pull pit that they're preaching a message which has expired 75 years ago so now they're giving some of the same thing over and over again now if we took food from our our place over here and and it was 10 years past due and people got sick boy that'd be want to chase us down and say why that bunch of Word of Life people them bunch of Hypocrites they was passing out Cheerios and they knew it was outdated they was passing out Pop-Tarts and they was three months overdue and it made a bunch of them people sick and yet if preachers will get in the pulpit and preach against other preachers andur churches that are handing out outdated word it's like you're some type of crazy person or something they look at you and think what in the world's wrong with you would any of you want to eat ters that had expired 10 years ago would any of you want to eat some of this stuff and you turn it over and look at it and say oh my goodness that come over with Noah on the ark I can't believe I ain't feeding my children that stuff but yet spiritually people will set for years of their life and they will feed on a word that has been expired for a complete Church age now you understand the Methodist they're feeding them on a word that is to church ages outdated the Pentecostal and now the briad age so they're feeding them on that Presbyterian on back on back but yet we realize that for many of them that's all they'll ever be able to hear but myself I'm grateful to God that God has opened up our eyes and we can take this message and look at the expiration date on it and I'll tell you what it says until the Lord comes so our message does not expire don't worry about it expiring this year or next year if time goes on 10 more years our message will run right on up to the bride call for the Rapture thank God for that so you know whenever we realize what God has done we ought to be so grateful of course and that it doesn't become common to us and we become complacent now what people do as far as helping and I am so grateful I mentioned about Dolly paron the other day I'm so grateful that woman gave $2 million I'm so grateful there's so many people that's contacted us and we're getting money from people in California money from people here and there and there a lot of them a't even saved what if we'd see a lot of them women they don't tell and what they look like them men but you know what their money spends just as good on a gallon of gas as yours does as the Holy Ghost feel sa so if they want to help I say praise the Lord for it thank God for it but yet we know that it takes more than helping in the time of Calamity in order to meet the challenge of this hour now after a while this will become calm down many of these people they told us today people over North Carolina many of them W him get electricity back till January which if you know is going to be in the middle of winter how in the world they're going to survive but eventually it'll become more commonplace th some of them told us today if this if this hurricane hits Florida they're going to forget about us they're going to forget about us but some of our brothers tell them no we won't forget about you we'll still be here to help you but that's the way it is because in crisis everybody changes ain't it amazing how nice people are that' be Baptist rub shoulders as Presbyterian Presbyterian rub shoulders the Church of Christ and they'll go in there we saw them today coming in with their little bags going through getting the Pop-Tarts getting the Cheerios getting toothpast getting toothbrushes they don't ask you what denomination you are what church you go to they really don't even care if you go to church or not but it won't be long that it'll revert back like it was preh Hurricane stage and then it'll be right back the way it was before why because it's something about human nature but we still want to be holy ghost filled word living Christians after the hurricane damage is all repaired is that right we don't want our good works to be seasonal we don't want our good behavior to be seasonal we believe that we are in season every day out of the year is that right so for us to do good to other people it's not uncommon to us because that's the way we live and we're grateful that something moves on humans Hearts I said right out here day before yesterday and saw a a woman come up on the parking lot and she had some things in her arm and one of them was a tray of eggs and an egg carton poor looking woman probably didn't have much at all and I went out to meet her and I said ma'am can I carry that for you and she had a box of eggs and then she had another little box about that big and and another dozen or so maybe eggs on top of that and she said I didn't have no money yeah yes sir I didn't have nothing to give I said thank you so much I said somebody will get benefit out of this you know what I thought about that little woman maybe casting her little mites in the offering plate oh Hallelujah you imagine how small that little woman felt when she walked up there we just got all kinds of pallets of water all kinds of packages from Amazon boxes from here boxes from there I thought it it took a you know it took a pretty brave individual seeing them trucks one after another after another be unloaded I wish every one of us could look at at our own gifts to God when we come to the house of God the same way and you saying I I can't sing like this one I can't do like that one but maybe you bring your little two dozen eggs to Jesus it might not do nothing she said I I got a bunch of hens and and they lay really good so I heard y'all is doing this and I wanted to be able to share it thank God thank God don't you understand that's exactly the way he wants you to be in your life to the Lord Jesus well I can't give $5,000 I can't give $10,000 can you give a nickel can you give a quarter can you give 50 cents can you come over and help separate some bags and boxes and can you tell somebody about Jesus come on somebody you see we're always comparing ourself to others and the devil uses that to talk us out of doing what we can which is our best God don't want you giving what somebody else can do God wants you giving your best that's all he requires of you now I want you to think that God is the one who gave this very law of of of reproduction and of sewing seed so the very seed that we will reap in the Harvest time and what we see coming up in our nation with socialism with Communism with all these things the seeds were swn years and years ago when brother ROM was here in the 50s and the 60s and preaching about things that was going to happen in America and a lot of people thought why he's out of his mind he's absolutely crazy there's no way it'll happen in our nation but yet we're looking at it happened right before our eyes and yet how did it come because it was sown in seed form years ago now it was thought to be awful the hippies and this and that my goodness the hippies are like Saints compared to what we got now we've got all off this bunch of s and immorality in the world we live and and that is so commonplace that if you speak against it it's not now you're the weirdo where years ago it was them that was strange but looks how much it's changed around they're not the strange ones anymore we are amen and the church said but I want you to think now the very first hybrid that there ever was on the Earth was not the devil it was not Fallen Angels it was actually Eve I figured that'd get your attention nothing else did now watch the prophet in the spoken words original C what did Eve try to do hybrid it mix it with something you've got to take it the way God spoke it and it won't mix with nothing God spoke spoken word is original and everything that God created spoke into existence is original and you can hyb some of his creation you can hybd some of his creation secondarily that's the reason Eve could do what she notice now did with her own seed because she she wasn't in the original creation had she been spoken word it would have been impossible for her to be a high breeder right because the original has life and because we come through Eve is the reason we die oh my now notice he said the original has life so that's the reason I think Cults and denominations and organizations die now don't limit this tonight to baptist Methodist Presbyterian Church of God we've got Cults in this message and the spirit of organization is around this message and look at every one of them that have raised up and show me after they had their so-called Revival where they ever had another one because they will live one time and then they will die why no original life of God because it's the message of the hour mixed with a man's ideology and then he'll say well you know the prophet didn't exactly say it that way but you know we need to add this and take away there the prophet even used the word polish it up polish it up now you imagine that is so different than completely deleting a word but you're just taking something and polishing it and just making it more shiny and make it more presentable friends I tell you I don't know if you understand or not a lot of message preachers that's what they're doing right now they're polishing this message and making it more acceptable leave this out leave that out add that a little bit twist this around a little bit and they're polishing it anybody know what this finish is called on this p up here tonight this is not the same finish that Brother D and den did on this right here this is called French polishing French polishing it's a it's a great art to be able to do it friend of mine and brother Daryl's brother Andrew down in New Zealand it's what he does for a living he's actually polished part of the Yachts of Donald Trump and a lot of famous people so they you imagine and they take their boat to New Zealand because he's so good at it and yet that piano would not look that way with the initial black coats on it so it's a process a process someone here in the church had a piano and someone had moved it several years ago and it had a finished similar to this not quite as high luster and they had damaged it and they wanted me to look at it and see if I could see if I could fix it possibly I was able to and be able to blend it in to where the the flaw disappeared but it was not French polished I would not have touched it had it been French polished first of all ly a Frenchman I don't know how to French polish so i' been out of my league but you see some preachers are not dislocators necessarily they're not splicers they're polishers so they polished the word to such a luster that in instead of you seeing Christ Jesus they polish it so you can see the image of yourself well I'll tell you one thing if that's what I succeed in doing here I have failed you that's I don't want you to see yourself I don't want you to see me I want us to see him now s the original High breeder on the earth oh my the prophet said once this happen they never did rise no more they never will they cannot they can't breathe themselves back got nothing to breed with they're sterile I think of every move that is raised down to the ages whether we would call it any denomination you wish to or a cult or a click or a clan and show me where they ever had a god-given holy ghost Revival after they come under the headship of man but because when you make man your head right there you die is that right now watch he said got nothing to breed back with they're sterile that's why Eevees children dies now remember every spoken word of God is the Original Seed and God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and re produce itself again hybrid it it dies and Eve the woman was the first hybrid thing there ever was I want you to sing Adam could only father the children that were in him but Eve could be the mother of Adam's child and the Serpent's child but it was totally impossible for Adam to father came why he could not have come from his genes he was not part of his DNA but Eve the mother the church listen now she could mother both she could carry both Supply sustenance to both and both of them after they were born could truly call her mother but only one of them could truly call Adam father now saying that's not just for Eve but that is a type of the church now listen to me Word of Life Church is just like Eve was we can carry the true sea and give birth to the true sea or we can conceive a hybrid version and out of our assembly oh my goodness y'all quiet tonight can come Hybrid part message part Pentecost part message part Baptist part message part Methodist don't that turn look at me funny you understand that's going around all over the world in the ranks of the message and then we wonder why they can't stand the test they're not Jesus children they don't have his DNA wo I thought this would be quiet but I I didn't think it'd quite be this quiet would somebody at least grunt or something every now that just you know kind of squeeze out of an amen thank you now and Eve the woman I remember the first time that I stood in Norway and I I preached this and I I quoted that off the top of my head I didn't have the book in front of me and I said that Eve was the first hybrid that there ever was oh my I seen it go across in Preachers and I seen them look at one another thought son you're in for it after this sure enough after church that's waiting on me and they said brother we've been in the message for so many years and this is said I've been in the message for so many years and I've been in the message God's Prophet never said such a thing I said give me five minutes and I'll be right back right wasn't my fault they had never read that before now remember had she come spoken word it would have been totally impossible for the devil to ever found an entrance into the human race now remember God did not make him do it but he knew that he would so the attributes of the fullness of God would be able to be expressed but now remember don't just keep say our church Word of Life before you tonight as I'm preaching this but I want you to keep yourself as well because you are also are like Eve so am I so in our minds we can receive God's word God's word God's word in our minds we can also receive if we're not careful doubts it's not for you God don't love you well you know I'm not sure brother Donnie's right on that now I'm not sure brother ROM's right why because you are like Eve was so in your mind in your spiritual how many knows it's the truth that happens to us all the time and you think well I'm not even a Christian no you're just exactly answering out your type but that's what makes the bride of Christ absolutely a wonderful miraculous thing of God in the last day that she will not do what the first Eve did so it's not like God is going to keep us from Satan having access to that but he's going to allow the devil to do it but he's going to say come on sweetheart let me fill you with my life and and I will be in you and I will see the seal the womb of your soul and I will pregnate you with my word and I will seal myself in your soul and though Satan May attack your mind he will never get in your soul after you got the Holy Ghost praise be to God now watch he says she was a high breeder a bride a high breeder a bride notice through that brought death through trying to take the word of God and mix notice not lies not transgender stuff not homosexual stuff not but what WI a better understanding well you know he he he didn't exactly say it this way but that's what he meant wow it's just amazing to me how many preachers we've got in this day that knows what the prophet meant even though he didn't say anything wow I must not have got that mint version somehow in my message I must not have got that mint version of the Holy Ghost brother dles I I I just keep running across them statements where he says anybody that adds to what I say don't believe what I say that's the version of the message that I got the one I got says it's three times in the Bible it's an unpardonable sin to add one word of your own interpretation to a message after it's been Vindicated to be the truth I got that scary version of the of the message I love it though praise God now notice she was a hbed or a bride notice to that brought death through trying to take the word of God and make some wisdom with it see oh my now let's let's jump from 1962 here for a moment to power of transformation in 1965 there is always Twins and that's the reason don't forget this little flock the church in the last days is gone going to be twins Matthew 24:24 see the church is going it's a Pentecostal move notice he doesn't identify it as the original Pentecost he differentiates between the original Pentecost or as he called an in future home or rising of the sun Pentecostal genuine but he calls it a Pentecostal move now listen this is your Prophet the church in the last days is going to be twins so close that deceive the very elected Matthew 24:24 the church it's a Pentecostal move it's so much like the real thing it would deceive the very elected if it was possible and a little later if I get a chance I want to explain how that election comes see it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two uh oh so here we are in Satan's Eden and we're going back to a similar setting as it was in the garden of you two fathers same mother so we got the second Adam which is the father of course of all true original preg naations of the word and we got the devil where will they be then well that our twin is it episcopari how could it be a twin to us and be that how could my twin be the pope Lord have mercy if y'all think he's my twin you need to get rid of be quick my twin is not going to be a First Baptist our twin is not going to be a cold dead church it's going to be a church that believes in worshiping God and preaching the message shouting every now and then have the spirit of God among them come on that'll be our twin notice how he says this two fathers that's all two fathers same mother so years ago from the womb of the message people men started Rising even before the prophet left but especially after he was gone so then they started rising and well you know this one is an apostle and this one was sent to add Clarity to the message to help us understand what brother Brenham meant now you think them men are going to stop saying what brother man said no they're not going to stop saying it because that's their bait that's what they put on the rod to throw it out though well the prophet said watch New York watch New York keep your eyes on New York something's going to come out of New York boy did they wear that quote Out Boy something's coming out of New York yeah then the one in South Africa oh brother brandham said I'm laying the foundation from one I'm laying the platform for one yeah it was Jesus you knucklehead not you amen God's Prophet wasn't the building the platform for Donnie Reagan he wasn't building it for Daryl Ward or for some other preacher he's building it he said my mission is to forun that coming word hallelujah he said I'm not here to tell you he's coming I'm here to tell you he is here amen he is here my so it's the same mother same church same movement same thing I've often wondered what it must have been like I know y'all think I'm weird anyway but I've often wondered what it was like in the first home in the first family so when them boys were born and from the birth I mean one of them looked different than the other one I mean no question about it but maybe it took a while before his nature started coming out and Adam and Eve looking at him and watching him and of course they kept it a secret from Abel as a matter of fact the prophet said they taught them boys that it was fruit that put them out of the Garden of Eden but you can't hide God from an elected God will get his children was it there was two was it four five wonder how old it was brother Rob that maybe even little Abel started noticing boy my brother's aggressive man I mean look look at him he is he is so different he he don't he don't really act like Daddy he sort of acts like Mama part of Mama maybe he's really different I don't understand him wonder what it is about him and then him even you know the way the elect generally do they'll they'll look at themsel and say well he's probably a better man than I am and I probably ain't no good no way I'm probably the serpent seed you know how how the devil does and then it went on until in the process of time they both felt the pull to go to church so Abel was out with his flock and Cain was growing his vegetables and his flowers oh he must have been a gardener I imagine he thought glory to God the prophet oh breaks into a realm and it's almost like he's hearing Cain's prayer and he said he folded his hands and you know just said these beautiful words of orthodoxia oh great almighty God I've come to you today to worship you and he brought his vegetables and his flowers and his fruits and laid them on the Altar and here come his little Holy Roller brother he grabbed a grape vine and tied around that Little Lamb's neck and here come that little lamb and on his way in Abel reaches down and grabs a hold of a rock and he takes that little lamb and lays it on the Altar and throws his neck back and you imagine Adam and Eve looking at one another did you tell him no I never told him we said we wouldn't want to tell him how did he find that out that's why some of your parents are still wondering about you what in the world are they doing at that brown of my church if I could get a hold of who told him well have good luck getting a hold to him I'll tell you God will get a hold to his I don't care what he's got to do he'll get a hold to you he'll run you out of that hen house that's right that Pastor running in the barnyard oh it's a cult it's a cult it's a cult but you look at yourself and you say glory to God here I come mama here I come I'm out of here it can't hold me in here why because you are one of those seeds of God you imagine the prophet said that God had revealed it Abel was not there when the Lord God killed that lamb and throw the skins in behind the bush to Adam and Eve and said walk out oh my but something dropped down in his heart he said he knew he was born in his mother's blood of his father's blood and here he come and they looked at one another and hadam said oh my God he knows he knows he knows he knows I've been lying to him here he brings it up tears pouring out his eyes glory to God oh yahe had your name and he gets that little lamb and it goes to hacking on its NE and he died speaking in language abble didn't understand and he looks at himself blood all over his hands blood all over his arms blood all over his clothes and Cain is looking at him so mad I was worshiping I was praying I was trying to get right with God and here you come in here look at you you've interrupted my service well if we're worshiping like Caine we need to be interrupted I think it do us good sometimes to just get interrupted out of our Orthodoxy don't you to get out of our our routine and out of our system where we can just get lost in the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah but he was sure and confident his mama hadn't taught him his daddy hadn't taught him but almighty God dropped that Revelation down in his heart maybe he out there in the field and it struck him and the Lord God spoke to him I want that lamb but but for what an offering for my lamb for but I thought daddy said well that's what they taught me at the Seminary that that's what they've always said that you was three Gods that's what you've always said that they eat an apple in the Garden of Eden it wasn't the apple on the tree is the par on the ground p p a i R2 you imagine brother darling as you walks up there you and I ought to walk just as confident tonight into the house of God and sit down say praise God I'm redeemed praise God my sins are forgiven me I'm going to heaven just as sure as there's a God in heaven I'm going to heaven and you have that absolute confidence that you are right with God and you are ready to leave this world why God's revealed it to you praise be to God same mother same movement same teaching but God burst Abel out of the teaching of his father just like it did many of you watch this same movement same thing the beding ground is the same where the word Falls but one of them like here is perverted you understand Say Amen amen congregation says am same mother same movement same books same tapes same Prophet but out of there will come all types of little isms from around this message in the last days to pull try to pull the the people's attention from the reality of the core of what God has done and say well if it's right what about this and what about that if you're going to use that same principle with the message you've got to use the same principle with Jesus Christ what about Peter which turned out to be a cussing preacher what about Judas that turned out to be a liar and a deceiver oh come on that don't hold up that don't hold up at all because the Lord Jesus had all kinds of people around him that did not believe the truth he had 70 preachers with him one day and he turned around and said does this offend you what about this if you'll see the son of man ascending up where he was and some of them preachers that was following him the Bible said turned and walked with him no more St John 666 chapter 6 verse 66 they turned and walked with him no more there's your mark of the beast people who know the truth and turn and walk away from it and seal with the devil's Mark oh brother Donnie that's scares me to death it shouldn't if you've got the Seal of God you ain't got one thing to worry about your soul is sealed in the presence of God your mind the devil might do it but if your soul is sealed it belongs to the Lord God forever can I go a bit farther now watch this the prophet deals with this of course in various messages down through the span of time when he's here but listen to this anointing ones them time remember you couldn't feed a luer back in them days you can now Catholic aaran no sir he had fresh meat that was the church age you couldn't feed Methodist Lucen message oh no he didn't want that carrying it's rotten you see the life had done left it and went into something else that's the old stalk that's dead back there the life is moving on can I say it neither can you feed the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism now notice there's a differentiation between Pentecostal genuine and Pentecostalism I don't want to feed our church Pentecostalism and to be honest with you I don't want no other preacher standing here preing Pentecostal ISM either praise the Lord why because it may not be but one person in that se but go in their heart and then 6 months down the road a year down the road if the latter of rain falls and they grapple that seed inside of their heart it's going to affect their product I want you to be virgin bride I don't want you to be a mix Eve I want you to be the second Eve which refuses the devil serpent SE praise the Lord so then according to the prophet messenger you cannot feed the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostal ISM so was brother brandham against the Pentecostal experience absolutely not was he against Pentecostal genuine brother skip of course not but he was against Pentecostalism no indeed maget blowed organizations nothing doing no no for the promis is and before the great and treble day shall come I'll send unto you Elijah the prophet he will restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers again now not ausa Street back to the original in Acts chapter 2 and the church said and they did not base their their experience upon Sensations or emotion they did not believe tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost they did not believe you had to shout to have church every night well come on somebody I realize a lot of the folks get into a routine and a ritual and an order some people saying that order is only move not moving hardly at all they said boy I'll tell you one thing I never wanted to get into no order I never I'm against order I'm against order but they don't read far enough to realize sometimes order has a lot of movement to it uhhuh let me tell you something thirst 1965 when you're worshiping God in the spirit and in truth when it becomes accustom for you to do it because you think you are ought to do it oh my goodness you mean so we could get into a ritual and a routine brother Adam and we just raise our hands and it's just well that's what we're supposed to do when we go to church so we just do it and and we lose our sincerity we lose our emotion about it and it just becomes ritual and routine you understand you're drinking from a Cess poool oh now notice he says you becomes accustom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you're drinking from a stagnated stream see you understand people can jump and shout and holler and run and speak in tongues and they're still drinking from a stagnated stream you know why because they think they've got to do it because everybody's going to look at it hey I believe in dancing in the spirit oh I love to do it but I ain't going to dance cuz people think I ought to I ain't even going to dance because the music is fast if I dance it's when the Holy Ghost hits me to dance and when he hits me look out devil here I come I'm on to dance I'll dance all over you if you get in my way I'll dance across there I'll dance up here wherever but I ain't going to do it because people stand there looking at come on now brother Donnie get in the spirit well you ain't the one to tells me to get in the spirit it's the spirit of God if he falls upon me come on somebody I'm not going to get into a ritual or a routine that I've got to dance every service or every third service or every fourth service because that is drinking from a stagnated sister you can be screaming to the top of your voice running the pews jumping shouting until you are wore out and drinking from a stagnated system right why because it becomes with the Rhythm the rhythm of the music and the fast songs are played and then we dance and then when they stop the music all the dancing is stopped well if we're dancing in the spirit you mean the spirit itself can't dance without everything going wide open G or a or whatever morning oh glory to God are going to be a meeting in the and then Harry quits and the spirit says whoa I got to follow brother Harry you got to be kidding me you mean our Holy Ghost is that flame say he's following Harry and Louie if the Holy Ghost is dancing you brother I'll tell you what you could dance to near my God to thee you don't need Moses in the bull rush I mean when the Holy Ghost is on you you can D je friend you see what it's doing you see what it's doing ausa street is merging itself into our message and people are say oh this is the move of God and this is the bran move really so you mean the end time message is a repeat of a Zeus hisry I know people don't like to hear me say it but see this is the same stuff I saw in Pentecost as a matter of fact that's some of the same stuff I preached in Pentecost and I was a Pentecostal preacher and if it worked last night we'll try her again tonight right here Andor out and the next time I don't want Pentecostalism I want genuine Holy Ghost Pentecost it'll not only make you shout it'll make you cry it'll not only make you cry it'll make you love your brother it'll even make you love your wife it'll make you love your husband come on somebody it'll make you love somebody in the church that don't even like you well Hallelujah it'll make you treat people right that have treated you wrong it will make you so much like Jesus that the devil would get scared to death of the life you're living not how high you're dancing I don't want the devil to get scared of my dance I want the devil to be scared of my life that's the Thunder that scares the devil oh oh praise the Lord look children the latter rains fixing to fall what is that the coming of the Lord the precursor to the Rapture and he's going to prove who's his oh my notice because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you are drinking from a stagnated stream and you see most people would think there's no way you're drinking from stagnation if you're extremely emotional you know where that comes from Pentecost now the sad part about it is some of the brothers in the message were never in Pentecost and they don't even recognize ausa street is appearing Among Us Again well I'm going preach with or without you it look better for you all on the day of judgment if you get with me though M listen this until it fills every fiber until the holy spirit is bubbling itself in you I don't care that the whether the music is playing whether they're playing near am my God to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart that satisfies that's God's satisfying portion anything less than that you're done you're done you see when brother randam was here he would preach to the Baptist and Presbyterians would come different ones but he was also preaching to the Pentecostals and it's amazing because you find Brothers in the message when brother Brandon would be at a certain place he may be maybe if it's Pentecost is and they extreme Pentecost and he would say things to bring them in line Brothers in the message that don't believe in the Pentecostal experience that's the quotes they gravitate toward others then he might be in a Baptist Church or a little bit of cold Church of Pentecost like it was there in 1963 in Arkansas when he come back to the Tabernacle and told him said now the reason I preached that was because that group of people was vearing off into something wrong so the prophet was trying to bring them back well according to PR preachers mainly they're the main troublemakers according to preachers makeup they will go through the message and find which quotes that lines up with their thinking which is the exact opposite what we ought to do we ought to line our quotes up our our thinking rather up with the quotes instead of the quotes with our thinking come on somebody so we got a bunch of high breeders that are sitting in their study and it ain't no wonder that we got so much confusion and the Sheep don't know what to believe I'm going to tell you what to believe tonight thus sayeth the Lord and God don't lie and God don't miss well come on somebody I'll tell you friends we're not just preaching we're not just coming to church but we're so and seit we're in the former Reign and we're in the latter Reign to where God's leading right up and the final climax of this is the rapture and he's going to prove which one is his now let me read to you how dangerous how dangerous it is God will punish punish people who try to add to this word now notice it will not mix it must not be tempered with God will punish the one who does it it's a serious thing for any preacher has been preaching how many miracles he's got or whatever to add to God's word to try to change the thinking of the word of this hour no preacher is exempt from Divine punishment praise the Lord a lot of preachers are in this day are trying to raise their spiritual kids the way parents are raising theirs now honey I'm counting to three one they believe in grace two some of y'all are wanting to say it so bad you're ready to scream it out yourself ain't you it ain't no wonder we're raising a bunch of beatnicks and heathens no wonder our children hate to pops no wonder a lot of our children I'm talking about out here in the age why they hate Authority why they're raised by a bunch of of heathens and that hate Authority come on oh my notice how serious now that God will punish the one that does it it will not hybrid to nothing else it's God's word alone God don't need listen how simple it is God don't need your word with his that's how simple it is leave our word out don't mix the message with James Dobson well brother Donnie don't you think some of these guys have some good things to say sure they do they have plenty of good things to say but we have a filter to run James Dobson through we've got a filter to run Jerry Chapman and all the rest of these guys out here intellectuals that study the Bible and so on and so on and so on God never sent us James Dobson is Malachi 4 God never sent us BTY Graham or or Gary Chapman or some of these great men out here God never send us Benny hand because we ain't H amen you don't send a hand together Eagles but you send an eagle together Eagles Hallelujah you send a prophet and on that prophet's Wings he carries them out of that bondage that they were in Hallelujah but Satan can't stand it and the sad part about it is it's always the same pattern a lot of the people who come out don't remember how important it is to say only what the messenger has spoken some will add here some will take away there and the word is no longer pure and the Revival dies the Revival dies and then when the Revival dies they go to looking for some kind of stirring to stir them back up again because they know they're missing something and when they do Satan will always stir them away from the word and it'll be this man or that man or this move or that move don't you hear me children we don't have to have Pentecostals to come and bring us a Revival how in the world can we feed the bride Pentecostalism oh my praise the Lord God don't need your word with his we're not supposed to speak our own word we're supposed to preach the word God's word now therefore true life can only come or reproduce itself by its original breeding so if the ausa street word was more powerful than the acts two word God got that mixed up God should have sent the isua one first and let that been the original and then God said I want have one everybody to do the way they did you see for some of you that was not in Pentecost and you're totally unaware of the way they used to be whether that some of them are now I will have to say this at least when we were still there in Pentecost there was a lot of genuine sincere ones only God knows how many sincere they are left they're still dancing they're still shouting so if you think that shouting and dancing is a move of God all you got to do is go on YouTube You'll see some of them churches out there at dancing any of us and you think we're the only ones Miracles and miracles is a sign of a bride all you got to do is pull it up on YouTube you'll find all kinds of Performing signs wonders and miracles as a matter of fact there someone told me not long a woman bobbed hair painted face earrings on pants on all kinds of stuff talking about signs and miracles was happening at one of our local Baptist Churches well maybe we should all close down our church and go there well Hallelujah notice this now therefore true life can only reproduce itself by its original breeding see now study that study the tapes study it now life and he spells it l i f e can only be reproduced by its original breeding the way it started at the beginning and of course the way the original Church started out was that they recorded tapes of Jesus preaching and then the apostles went out and just pressed play some of y'all are shaking your heads well I mean that's supposed to be the Perfection of what we are now right I mean we'll all be gathering Sunday so they say and we'll be hearing the literal voice of God we'll be hearing God himself preach to us and we can't trust preachers words and we can't trust these words and that words and we can only get it direct from God himself because that's God's original pattern and I'm thinking how have I done that man I've I've read this Bible since I was a boy how word did I miss reading that in the Bible but the original plan was that they play tapes of Jesus I mean I guess I don't understand it or either I do and what's being said is not original at all it's a hybridized prostitute and they're committing fornication with the devil well Glory you understand a lot of these denominational things around our ranks I'm going to go ahead and preach the seven Thunder deal the peria deal all these other deals you understand what they are ain't nothing but spiritual prostitutes Hallelujah but out of it all God will call a people there's been all kinds of men that raised up from India and raised up from the Philippines and raised up from South Africa and raised up from Tennessee and all over you know what but God will still has a bride and that bride is Virgin born and she will not compromise I got to thinking the other day brother Daryl and putting it down on my mind and thinking how many message preachers and they're doing way don't even preach anymore many of them the way brother renam taught marriage and divorce They Don't Preach the way brother renham tght about marriage They Don't Preach no more the faithfulness of going to church They Don't Preach no more the order the way the prophet taught the gifts I got to go through the different things that message preachers don't even preach it scared me I thought oh Lord we come so far that they leave that out we don't want this we don't want that we don't want that what are we going to produce I'll tell you what we're going to produce death death let's stand so when the rain falls what's it going to produce out of our church what's it going to produce out of your life it's coming it's producing communism socialism it's producing all these different things in the secular World cuz the seeds have been swn you ever remember the prophet whenever the spirit of God would anoint him to say it and he never said watch the USSR but it was always watch Russia but it amazing she was called USSR for decades and years but God went ahead and named her what should be in the present tense like God could say to you through his Prophet I no longer call you church but I call you bride amen we were renamed you remember when God told Moses go before pharaoh and tell him let my son go Israel is my firstborn that changed the hierarchy of everything they looked at them at slaves they own them yes sir so God had to change their identity amen and God could say say you got my young ons at your house turn them loose they were mine before they were yours so he told him walk in there and tell him thus sayeth the Lord let my son go my firstborn you understand our Exodus which is fixing to culminate and a body change that's what God's going to say to death it's working in our body every day we live her hair turning gray turning loose her eyes this and that and the other all happening to every one of us but God is going to say to death death let go of my firstborn our loved ones Hallelujah will come up glory to God our bodies will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and death will be forced to let go of the second Eve and out of our womb will come forth the son of David for the millennium glory to God oh Jesus help us Lord God lord it's frightening sometimes as we look around and hear what's being preached what's been left out changed and modified and I think about it what will it be if time terries another five years another 10 will we even recognize the message it's being preached but we know you've got a people and they will stay true to that word our church is an eve but may have person here tonight walk not walk out of here and just with that thought but may they also say they are too the prophet when he preached this in the evening service is spoken words Original Seed and he told them I'd like to preach on the two ws and when he came back he did so we know Satan has access to that womb in our mind because that's the greatest battle it's where it's fought at right there so the Battleground is where the armaments meet so God bombs us as it was with quotes and scriptures and sermons and encourag in things then the devil will bomb us no wonder our mind looks like it's just blowed to Pieces because both of them are testing their strengths in our mind and how will the battle go it'll totally depend on us Eve had the capability of saying no to the serpent him being Anointed with the devil we know that the serpent didn't have a soul but he had a place for one and we know that Satan had a soul so he simply stepped inside the Serpent's body and in reality we know Cain had two fathers the serpent was the father of his body but the devil was the father of his nature so he looked physically not like the devil but he looked physically like a Mongrel a mixing a hybrid between Eve and Cain and Lord we look at some of the mistakes and the things that we have done in our lives a lot of us if we'd be honest tonight we produced a lot of canes in our own lives we try to think well you know the Lord will fix it and the Lord will take care of and he he'll he'll change it all he he'll he'll do this he'll do that we're the one who brought that Canan into the Earth and a lot of times we have to deal with it for years because we produced it but there's one thing I love about your grace even though Eve Lord God help them please Jesus please help them help them to realize what Eve forfeited the prophet on down here a little bit in these quotes said eve should have brought forth Christ he was that seed that she should have brought forth but instead of bringing forth Christ she settled for Cain Lord Jesus may we see it's the same thing for us we are offered this wonderful awesome privilege to give birth to Christ the word the product of this message of Malachi four a Bible believing people that are filled with the Holy Ghost and has Miracles and signs and wonders and and Supernatural we don't have to go backwards to isusa Street to get that no the original had that oh I don't want to go backwards to get it I I want the original but Lord we preached it years ago in the book of Acts and I know some of the preachers didn't like it when I preached that book of Acts and I heard them talk about it and the reason they didn't like it was because I brought all the tests and all the trials that they had in the book of Acts because the book of Acts is not just wrote about miracles signs and wonders it's wrote about tests and failures and issues and problems and that's exactly the way every church is today that really believes the word we got signs yes we got Miracles but we have issues we have problems years ago we could Point our fingers at the denomination said oh y'all are mixed up in your marriages we can't point it no more we got it in our own ranks so what do we do we throw him out whenever Eve your daughter forfeited her rights to bring forth Christ the word you didn't throw her into hell you didn't step down there that day and look at Adam and say said you disobedient Ser son I hate you but you forgave him thank you when they was going out the Garden of Eden the prophet said you looked at that love and you couldn't understand it and you forced them to leave get out and right as they were starting out thank you little evening her blonde hair and her blue eyes leaned her head over on Adam's chest the tears running out out her eyes and mixing with his tears as it run down the garments and slapped on his leg and her leg mixed with the Lamb's blood glory to God and you come down on that Pillar of Fire and said the prophet said you said I can't stand it I can't stand it why you didn't want to be in Paradise alone right thank you Lord what good is a garden if the gardener ain't there and Adam didn't want to live there by hisself that's why he did what he did Adam doing what he done forced you to do what you did and you knew all along it would us being born lost forced you to come to the Earth to redeem us Oh Glory to God but you stopped him and said I promise you I'll bring you back lord there's people in this building that not done horrible things there's people stream the service they've done horrible things but they none of us ever done what Adam done and yet your grace is so powerful one day the prophet of God said Adam will reach over in the resurrection and take a hold of Eve Eve will reach over and take a hold of Abel able to reach over and take a hold of Seth and when we get gather together there I know we want to meet Samson we want to meet Paul we want to meet the great Heroes of the Bible but I'll tell you I want to meet Lord I want to meet Adam I want to be at I want him to tell me about Grace hallelujah hallelujah We Worship You toight Jesus Oh hallelujah how many wants to bring forth Christ children don't you see don't you see I I'm not trying to be controversial I'm not trying to cause issues but can't you see what God's offered us in the message to bring forth Christ Christ so why would we settle to bring forth Reagans or colemans or puits or Spencers or Wards amen amen how could Eve trade Cain for Jesus don't condemn her too bad you and I have made some of the similar choices in our lives but God in his Mercy has forgiven us thank you Lord let me just say this if God's forgiven you you ought to be able to forgive others cuz remember if you don't forgive men their trespasses neither your heavenly father forgive you of yours oh how many wants to bring forth Christ the word oh Jesus as I've been studying this I constantly check up on myself constantly I don't do it once a year I don't do it when me have communion I do it daily sometimes many times during the day Lord search me look at me see anything that displeases you help me Lord reevaluate me Lord help me to reevaluate my priorities help

the wrong thing up here High Lord and I've took some of the things of Great Value and put them away on down the list Lord if I got anything in me that that I'm I'm conceiving of a of a mixed product a hybrid of this it's a little bit of message and a little bit of this and a little bit of that why would you want to do that when you can bring forth Christ himself why would anybody want to give birth to a cane when they can give birth to Jesus can we bow our heads praise the Lord how many in here tonight you just by the raising of your hand Lord help me I want to give birth to Christ the word

Pentecostal seed sew and see what it brought up if the Lord cares in a few years we're going to have a product setting in our message churches we're not going to be proud of I'm already seeing it here and there and there and it's looking more like a zza street instead of Acts two oh God lord Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth tonight father would you begin with me Lord father I've had MRIs before and CT scans and different things like that and it's amazing what man can do to be able to take them pictures and of our body and if there's something wrong or something going on but

my heart Jesus do you see a child there that should not be there Lord am I am I feeding on something that would produce a hybrid in my life would I produce if I were to be brought to maturity tonight

when it does there'll be no time to change children there'll be no time to run to the spiritual Nursery as it was and say oh I've got the wrong baby I've got the wrong one no this is not mine whatever we're carrying in us will prove who we've been with cuz the father of our child will prove who we have been with am help us Lord and if we've only been with a message preacher and got under their influence and we're doing what they say do then we'll be producing their children but if we've been with Christ Jesus the lifegiver then we as the bride will give birth to word children amen yes word children that will never die seven Thunder children die perusia children die tape only children die message Pentecostal mix hybrid children die the only children around this message that will live or word born word children of a word birst by Malachi 4 Lord God help every preacher in this church to preach this word like never before father May our young people be led to a word birth oh yeah we want them to Shout Scream holl and jump but we want them to live just as high as they jump but we know the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ's teaching so if we've got the Holy Ghost and someone can show us by the word that we're operating a gift out of order if we've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost in us will take Christ teaching yes or if we're disrupting the service or we're living a life that's unpleasing to you the Holy Ghost in us will say Amen brother that's right I'm sorry I didn't realize that please forgive me please pray for me so it ain't how high would jump after we get

will help you get out we got Band-Aids and we can pull oil in your wounds and all that we'll be having a good Sligh and service again here Sunday if you want to come back and get slayed again I ain't talking about been slayed in the spirit I'm talking about the sword cut all this evil off of us hallelujah let's get that cut off and let the spirit slay us what you to say praise the Lord I wanted to just mention something to you here before I let you go um about this uh flood relief and things that we're doing and and I'm sure that some of you have noticed that we're doing things a little bit different than we normally do around here and that is taking taking pictures and documenting a lot of things things that we're doing you know how I've been through the years I normally don't hardly let anybody know what I'm doing but let me just share some of the reasons why we have people that are contributing to our church that are business owners that are companies that are people that're not even Christians many of them of course don't even believe the message but they've heard about what we're doing and you know they don't know us from Adam they don't know who we are and we're documenting everything when it comes in at the door they have somebody there taking a list people come in off the street and give it they get their name and we just we we want to be faithful stewards is that right so some of them you know they say well could could I see a picture of you know would you mind doing that cuz you know they don't know who it ain't like they're giving 50 cents some of these people's given $5,000 $10,000 $111,000 they don't even know us so I have no problem myself with taking pictures and been able to give it to them but with that you know you're going to see a little bit more than you normally see so keep in mind we're not doing that so people will know it's us doing it but some of these people and there's other here tonight that know that some of the people have even asked them could you you know just send us a picture of what we're doing so we could send pictures back I do the same thing whenever we we send money overseas we just recently sent some money overseas we lifted money for bicycles motorcycles to buy a PA system to put concrete in a floor in a church so on and so on and so on and I tell the brothers there look I want pictures I want pictures of the brothers that we sent them to I want follow-up emails from them brothers I just like to make sure that we're being held accountable and we're doing it so and I share them with you from time to time so if you're noticing that and you're thinking boy this is a little bit strange it's a little bit different it is different because whenever we're doing it ourself you know how I am I don't ask people out here to donate Mission funds for the message or something like that we do that ourself and the majority part of the things we have done around the world has been from our church we have built churches all over the continents of the earth I say that by the grace of God ain't Hardy nobody knows what we've done and I plan on keeping it that way but our church did it but this is not just our church it's from all kinds of people and there's people here in our church that are business people and they've asked friends of theirs would you like to donate or their friends and say do you know anybody that we can support and they say yeah yeah our church is doing this or that and they don't come here so they really don't know us so everybody understand that I just want to let you know so you think wow this is really different you know what brother Donnie trying to take credit no you know me better than that but some of these people would just like to see where their money is going they want to see it I have no problem in sending it to them so after this is over we'll revert back to normal secrecy don't let your left hand know what what your right hand's doing but you're de with an unbeliever he don't necessarily believe that scripture he wants to know what his right hand's doing so he can see what our left hand is doing just to make sure that we're honest and legitimate you know you can understand them because a lot of them are lied to and their money is taken hey you know what we have nothing to be ashamed of we can be able to document everything that we do we'll have printouts of all that we do federal government wants to come and check us come on down Joe if you can find us that's right i' why I believe we ought to be aren't you as the people of God cuz one day we're going to stand before the great one and first of all I want him to be placed you see when people give all this money you know who's going to answer for it first me me thousands times thousands of dollars have come through here in the last few weeks it ain't going to be brother jacket tip's going to answer it's not going to be Michael it's not going to be the piano player the organ player I've got to give an account to God and I want to be faithful to that amen amen so you know what if we handle it right with him shouldn't be a problem with anybody else The Infernal revenue or whoever else amen oh praise the Lord don't you love the Lord with all your heart how many's happy you come to church tonight am well the rest of you I'm sorry you're so miserable but we'll be praying for you God bless you let's bow our heads together Jesus it's such a wonderful joy to serve you I'm so happy to be a Christian thank so happy father we come to a close of a service and I pray Lord that you'd help us to really consider where we are dear God help me as a preacher I I wonder sometimes if preachers realize how fearful that it is you give us an element of influence with people you give us favor with people yes one day we're going to have to answer to you for the favor and what we've done with that favor because it's evident that when some preachers leave the word some people will follow them they'll just go right there with them that preacher don't realize one day he's going to stand before you not only give account for his own soul but give an account for those Souls that he led astray dear God I preached to thousands times thousands of people the 41 years I've been preaching this message hard to believe in one way but preaching this message for 41 years dear God when I stand before you I want no man's blood on my hands I don't never wanted anybody to say he split our church he divided our congregation and truthfully say I sow Discord or truthfully say I added to the word oh no God take me off the Earth take me to a premat to a grave if you have to Lord I don't want to stand before you that day with men's blood on my hands but I want to stand there Lord and look back behind me and there will be the saints of God that I've LED through life we'll be gathered under our Prophet messenger of the age Paul will present his group on down on down to the seventh age up who walk Elijah will be like a mighty Army that will be the commander that'll stand there the prophet of the age then there'll be the different Bri AES as it were the colonels the generals back there at the end will be a tater peeler that'll be me with our little tater peelers we're the Tater peeler Brigade but that's all right you need taters when you're hungry Lord we want to stand over that Great Mighty Army that day we'll watch them great people as they get their rewards and we'll stand there and rejoice and scream and holler glory to God we may not get the reward that others get but Lord we will just be so happy to be there oh Hallelujah May there not be a one here tonight absent on that day keep us by your grace I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you Saints now since we've canceled the fallfest brother Fred and then won't be coming up we'll be rescheduling scheduling that Meer meeting later sometime with all that was going on in the
