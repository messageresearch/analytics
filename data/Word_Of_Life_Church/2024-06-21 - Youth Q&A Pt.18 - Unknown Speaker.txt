that was one out of stone or wood or paper mâché or ceramic you imagine making your own God so you decide I'm going to make myself a God so I'm going to shape him and mold him and you go to all that work and you get ready to set it up and you drop him and break him all to pieces wow that would make you cry wouldn't it you imagine there's people who who give their lives to things just as stupid is what I said things that's not real things that's not true things it's not lasting we're blessed to have a desire to hunger for the Living God aren't we well we greet you tonight miss doing this it's been been several several weeks hasn't it brothers were you able to rescue those things for us all right praise the Lord another electronic glitch but hopefully the brothers got it all right let us start with this question tonight since this end time church is to be like the first church in Acts why don't we own all things commonly as described in Acts 4 32 to 37 now whoever asked me this I want you to meet me in my office after church CU I'm going work you out no I'm only teasing it's a good question good question and we'll read this scripture to go along with this not the one that they quoted we'll go to that one but Matthew chap 26:1 the Lord Jesus speaking for you have the poor with you how long how long for you have the poor always with you but me you have not always let's pray together now with the word and ask the Lord to help us father we thank you for this time that we could gather together I've so enjoyed these questions and I I appreciate these young people submitting them Lord things that's on their hearts and I already know from emails and texts and whatsapps and all kinds of things that I've received from people around the world that so many people have been blessed and got answers to things that that they pondered about for years and years and it was all because a young person here had something on their heart so it goes to show that you can take something that just we think we're the only one maybe that ever had such a question and we come to find out there's many many poor in the same way so it helps us to realize that really we're more alike than we are different I pray that you'd help me tonight Lord that I'd be able to answer these things correctly shut my mouth to anything that would be wrong or displease you in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated actually this is part of um though you may not know it this is one of the things that communism they try to take these couple of places in the book of Acts and say that communism actually had a religious Foundation because that's where the word communism comes from so that everybody had everything in common but um since the Lord Jesus said that we would always have the poor with us that leads me to believe that he know that this the way that they started it here in the book of Acts would not continue and that it would not work worldwide now I want to I want you to um think in your hearts now as we look at this before we get to the scripture that neither the Lord Jesus nor the apostles taught this as a Doctrine so there's no teachings in the teachings of Jesus or no teachings in the book of Acts where Paul Peter John James and the rest of the apostolic Elders taught this and said now look this is what we need to do this is the word of God and this is the way that we need to go about doing it and it it worked for a while Acts chapter 2 verse 44 and all that believed were together here's a very important word all that believed were together I want you to notice where this is happening Jerusalem so the gospel has not moved to Babylon the gospel has not moved to Syria the gospel has not moved to the other parts of the earth yet it's pretty much gathered right there in Jerusalem in Galilee so Luke wrote this and he said all that believed were together and had all things common but listen how the next verse here says it and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men but that don't mean it quite the way the English translates it listen to these last few words which are the key wordss as every man had need so that don't mean you had a cow you had a horse you had a donkey you had a chicken you had a pig you had a you know whatever you had and we all sold it and we just divided it so we got a sum total of $ 26,39 38 5 cents so how many ever there are here we'll take that and divide it into it and we all got the same amount that's not what the Bible even says but the Bible says that as every man had need so there were rich people there in the book of Acts and look in verse 46 and they continually continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house and did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart in Acts chap 4 again verse 34 neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or listen now lands as in plural houses as in plural so it's not that they sold our house their trailer you know their Bungalow whatever it was they had and moved out and everybody moved into tents but these were people that had multiple houses multiple lands multiple possessions so there was the extreme poor and the extreme rich and some of them Rich folks actually got saved for many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and remember in Jerusalem all around the world and distribution was made unto every man not you get 75 you get 75 you get 75 you get 75 you get 75 but according as he had need and josei who was by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation levite and of the country of Cyprus now it's amazing amazing to me because the fact that Luke mentions Josie or Barnabas in particular shows that it was by no means a universal practice among all the Believers or why would you just mention this one guy if it was something common would you say well we all went to church and we was all baptized and we all sang and we all but this guy was outstanding why because it was not a commandment and they said artman you get saved you got to sell your house you get saved you got to sell your horse you got to sell your cow and then you're going to give it all to the apostles and they're going to divide it so Josie who was by the apostles name Barnabas this name was given to him because of his character I love the meaning of this name and it means the son of consolation wouldn't that be awesome to be identified and known among the people of God and it wasn't the Lord that called him that but it was the people that called him that and they said that he was a son of consolation which means that he consoled God's people he was a rich man he was a merchant before he gave his heart to God so he had excess of a lot of properties a lot of different things that he had and he took it upon himself this is what makes this so outstanding the word did not demand that they do this because this is the Apostolic Church which is why the person asked as this question no doubt thinking well if we're going to go back to that original church then won't every one of us have to do what they done we would if it was the word absolutely there are people in our church let me tell you that do above and beyond above and Way Beyond what is required of them to do as far as some financially others it's just helping around the church and they're constantly asking is there anything I could do is there anything that I could do to help because people want to help and we think the only way that we can give is by money oh no there's many more things that we can do that can be such a help to the body but this man was so outstanding now if this was the common practice then you'd think they' called everybody a son or a daughter of consolation so what was really required was tith and offerings but many of these people were giving so far above all of that having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet but now remember this was an experiment and it was very short-lived it was not undertaken on the basis of the teaching of the Lord Jesus or the apostles and it was an experiment that did not last it was temporary cuz later we find out that Paul had to take up offerings in different countries where he was and send them back to the church at Jerusalem because there was such hard times in Jerusalem and they brought in money from the Gentiles Titus actually came with him and they brought back in so it proves by the very Bible itself that this only last for a little short span of time you can find that in Acts 5:4 so today if the church started doing that can you imagine how many people we'd have in our church if people started hearing hey you know what they tell me them people s at everything they're God and they're giving money away that'd be drunks Liars horn mongers thieves Renegades everybody in the world coming to get saved no to get free money honey they're not coming to get saved they don't want the Holy Ghost they don't want what we preach they got their hand out we have enough of that the way it is so if this would have been a teaching based in the scripture there would have been scriptures for it and truly the apostles would have never let it fall to the ground and stop had they been given direct commands from the Lord that help you understand that all right we'll go to the next one why do we call it communion when we partake of the bread and the wine why do we call it communion another good question 1 Corinthians chapter 10: 16 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ so Paul is actually the one who called it commun look at what the word means it's a beautiful word here used all through the New Testament coia Fellowship to communicate Fellowship joint participation the share which one has in anything so Paul says the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ so in symbol whenever we take that little cup and press it to our lips it's like that we are joining in not only with the Lord Jesus but with the rest of our brothers and sisters and then he brings the same thing to the bread the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ so the Lord's Supper is rightly called communion because it helps us to experience that Unity with the Lord Jesus and that Unity with one another another good question how do we know when a preacher is working the the people up or if he is teaching praise under the anointing of the Holy Spirit I about shouted when I got this one I thought it was just a very good question now listen carefully again how do we know when a preacher is working the people up or if he is teaching praise under the anointing of the Holy Spirit now there's a great contrast between the parts in this question because trying to work people up is one thing trying to teach people to worship is something else let me read this to you on that day on Calvary forgive me my Pentecostal friends I am Pentecostal but by my Pentecostal friends has got to a spot to where there has to be a lot of fast music and beating of some bands or clapping hands or tambourines to bring up a shout that's only emotions now when a preacher or a song leader or a youth song leader or any of us would do it that way for the purpose of only arousing people's emotions that certainly is wrong for us to do that but do most of us need encouragement when it comes to worship most of us do I don't know why I don't understand it I don't understand why that a lot of church people have to be encourag to praise the Lord but I want you to notice now how that brother bam deals with this and I I find it amazing because of the the the quotes that you hear mainly quoted around the message are those that appear to be and seem to be anti- emotion and it makes me wonder if some of the brothers who preach against that if they've ever looked at the other side of those quotes that very same word which I just went through yesterday and looked at every quote where he says the word emotions and I found it amazing brother Daryl how many times that brother brandham was encouraging emotion and I thought wonder why we don't hear that red very often wonder why preachers Don't Preach that part as well but you remember that brother random is is preaching to a lot of Pentecostals and most of you were never in Pentecost how many of y'all was in Pentecost brother Daryl the only one okay so most of you whenever you would hear things about Pentecost you have no clue what it's like you don't have a clue what it's like for my brother Harry to struggle for years after it come out of Pentecost coming into the message it was years before Harry ever got the the Liberty to be able to play the organ the way he does now probably doesn't make any sense to you does it but because he felt like he prostituted his gift to emotion now when you've done that and I've done the same so you give your gift you give your ability for the purpose of working people up and getting it going and faster and faster and then when you come to the real truth of it and you realize what you've done it just pulls you back in a shell and you you just don't know how much to release how much to hold back and I've encouraged Harry and I've done it for several years use what God's give you but it's been such a challenge now you see some of the musicians brother Larry Elliott same way some of the musicians that the only thing they've ever played in in the has been in the message they don't know that feeling you don't know what that does because the musicians would have a great part to play in the amount of emotion in a tent meeting in a church meeting participator in it and actually motivating people emotionally as I did as a Pentecostal preacher it's very very hard because you've walked under that and you see how easy you can manipulate people but that does not mean that the real emotion should not be experienced by us all so what are we going to do we're going to let the Scarecrow scare us I thought scarecrow scared crows not Eagles so it took me a long time cuz I went from the Pentecostal ditch I got out of that ditch and I went into the message ditch and I went for years I went one time it was probably 9 10 11 months after I come to the message God hadn't spoke to me one word I was worried I was concerned and I went to him one day in prayer and I said Lord have I done something wrong why don't you he spoke to me all right and he said because you won't let me you have let these preachers tell you I don't speak to people no more I repented I cried I asked God to forgive me you know what I done I went from that Pentecostal ditch over to this ditch over here I got tired of living in ditches I don't mind telling you ever since them I've been searching for the middle of the road and granted I don't know of one preacher that preaches that don't think he's not in the middle you ever heard a preacher stand up and say now I'm a ditch preacher I live in the ditch I eat in the ditch I sleep in the ditch I study in the ditch actually I'm going to try to deceive you all tonight I know I'm in error and I'm going to lead you all in error I'm just warning you before I do it you ever hear any preacher do that every one of them think they got the truth don't they and they think their view is the most B balanced view in the message that's why they give it the way that they do so whenever we think about being moved in that direction listen again he says the Pentecostal church is in a leodan condition they still jump and holler and carry on when the music is beating when the music stops beating or the beatnick music some of them play and call it Christianity whenever that stops all the glory is gone now I've seen that over and over again when the music is going people will be shouting and running and they'd be hollering and all the stuff would' be going on when you come to an end I went the shout that went everything the emotion they're just totally totally gone you think wow I mean it bothered me even whenever I was in Pentecost that's why you'd want to keep it going because you knew if you didn't keep it going they're going to turn the FAL it off but I never realized why because we were using our gift to be able to nurture and to be able to make their emotions react just like they do at a rock and roll concert people go in there you've seen pictures of it hopefully none of y'all ain't never been there I ain't never either but you've seen what they do they go crazy they go absolutely crazy Carol and I a few years ago was at the Kentucky Horse Park up in Lexington Kentucky any yall ever been there it's be beautiful very beautiful place we just happened to hit it whenever they was having an Arabian uh Horse Show there was Arabians there from Egypt from cter from all over the world no telling what those horses were worth I love watching them they're absolutely beautiful but what I found amazing was when they would get these horses out there maybe worth a quarter of a million dollars half a million dollars and they'd bring them out and whenever they'd get out there they would start playing certain music with certain beats now if they wanted that horse to do just a high stepping rack then they would do a certain beat of music but whenever they open that horse wide open and that rider was scooted back on there they used four rains like it's it's just amazing to watch him they would always turn on Fast rock and roll type music music and you would watch them horses as they would change their caner and they would change the step they were in and as soon as that music went from that slow beat to that fast them horses would get right with it and they would start bringing their feet up like this Higher and Higher and I thought my goodness even me Carol talked about it as we sat there and we saw one after another after another because there's something about that music music and it even pull them horses into that and as soon as they would stop that music them horses would stop just like that so whenever we go to use in music or we go to use in anything of course it tries to get us into something that only moves our emotions then that's what the prophet was striking he was not preaching that we as a message people are supposed to sit in church never clap our hands never say praise the Lord never worship God sure I believe in dancing let's shout let's worship god let's praise the Lord but he said don't jump no higher than what you live so if you live this high jump that high brother if you live that high don't jump this High cuz everybody else is going to feel they they something ain't exactly right you know what I'm talking about now watch he said they jump and holler and carry on when the music is is beating when the music stops beating or the beatnick music if some of them play and call it Christianity whenever that stops all the glory of God is gone if it's a real praise of God there isn't enough whistles enough power in the world to stop it when it really comes from God it don't take music to beat it up it takes the spirit of God to come down on it and that's what does it now do we need encouragement yeah I'll tell you sometimes a song leader has a tough job cuz we come in here some of you especially on Wednesday nights you've worked and you come in you're tired you got this on your mind that on your mind the song leader has to try to pull everybody together you realize why they're doing that they're doing that so when the preacher walks out everybody hopefully will be in a better frame of mind than they were 20 minutes prior to that so they're trying to get everybody in the spirit now brother brandom went and preached at a church out in Phoenix and the brother's name was brother Outlaw now they're a Spanish church and I heard it years and years ago but the voice of God's kind of redone some of the tape things and I couldn't find it because I was going to play it for you tonight and uh the young brother that led the singing was brother Outlaw's son so he was the pastor's son his name was Jimmy brother I'm is going to refer to it you talking about singing I mean them folks sang they worshiped they hatered they screamed brother Brandon bragged on it and bragged on it he said that they had a Rec recording of them singing it and he said every time he would go in the office his office back at home in Jeffersonville Billy Paul would have that that that recording going so if brother Brandon was against that either one of two things he was a hypocrite or we've only took the quotes we want and you know why people do that I'm convinced a lot of the preachers that constantly do that I mentioned it last night they've never had a Pentecostal experience they come to this message and they cried a little bit or whatever and they say oh praise the Lord I got it I got it I don't need that old Pentecostal stuff why why don't we need it it's the original blessing of God now he's at he's there at U at brother Outlaws Church in Phoenix good evening friends a privilege to be here tonight and enjoying this wonderful musical Feast wow wonderful musical Feast I want you to listen now how he goes on to say enjoying these songs when they're sang with real enthusiasm enthusiasm so would that be considered considered trying to pump people up wonder why we don't hear this quote read that brother brandham liked it now brother brandham was not criticizing them so he says they're sung with real enthusiasm I was watching Jimmy this is the pastor's son I believe it is and if we could be just as enthused about all the things of God in our own life as Jimmy is in the emotion of them singing we would get somewhere I really appreciate that boy now there's one of two things we have to do with this quote either brother brandham was lying and he was being a hypocrite and he was standing up there bragging on that boy but he didn't really mean it or brother brandom meant it which I believe and I think you believe he meant it he appreciated it he enjoyed it as a matter of fact it goes down to Jack Moors later and talks about the same thing brags on him there talks about how blessed it was and how good it was so you wonder why then that people will try to take quotes and one-sidedly now watch this is in 1960 this was 1963 the quote I just read you so brother random had been there prior to this meeting in sort and he says excuse me I didn't mean to walk around so brother randam has moved around and walked around on the platform maybe something's making me walk anyhow I got on my walking shars oh my I want to take a trip someday like Enoch and walk right on up standing in brother Outlaw's church not long ago in Phoenix Arizona they were singing a song were going up up up up after a while I thought I was gone so the first round climbing the ladder any all familiar with this old song the first round justification the second rung sanctification the third rung the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said the first round climbing the ladder the first round was justification the second round sanctification the third round glorification then the Holy Ghost come down I started up up up up up up up up up whoa whoa whoa so you mean the louder they went the longer they gun brother Brenham kept failing feeling himself give lifting higher and higher and higher and higher I mean how many UPS was that about eight or nine so the more they sing you know what's happening to him he's feeling the anointing and he's also feeling an emotional stir so if we're going to condemn emotions we're going to have to begin was our Prophet first unless he believed that he could be emotional but we couldn't do it he never believed in such nonsense well praise the Lord Brother Donnie I'm behind you buddy sir some of y'all are too now notice he says I started up up up up up up till I struck that milky white way and I saw if we go any farther we're going right from this church I mean there must have been a powerful something going on in that church and it wasn't from the preaching of the word it was from singing I mean they must have been worshiping God and what did it do if the if the music of the world brings them congregational people to a place they can leave their troubles behind for a while and they can get all caught up with that and it it does something to them the prophet tells us the world has emotions and the Christians have their emotions I think we're letting the devil Rob us from not letting the spirit of God bring us to a realm where we can get helped as I mentioned last night a lot of folks think when the word is over well time to go to the house that's not what the Bible tells us that's not what the message teaches us it's just then time to worship now I want you to notice he said I thought if we're going any higher we're going right from this church that's what we need today is strike that milky white way to Calvary rise in the power of the Holy Ghost lay us out our Creeds and differences start up up up up that's what we need to do going up well praise the Lord he gets so excited now here he's in sort after being in Phoenix and he's still getting emotional talking about it well if it was wrong wonder why he wouldn't say now I'll tell your friends you know I was out there and them people they was carrying on the office that ever was I mean I just got I got so embarrassed and so humiliated let me explain a little something to you our God is a god of variety all of his preachers are not the same all of his song leaders are not the same so you get a song leader that's not a very emotional song leader most of the time he will choose songs that aren't very emotional he will set the setting for that service so if you got an nonos song leader a non-emotional preacher what kind of church you figure you're going to have so what if you have a more emotional song leader and a more emotional preacher now does that mean that them folks are Pentecostal and they're not in the message no it doesn't but will they produce more emotional type of services yes they will why because the spirit is anointing them and they're getting into it now if they're not careful the more emotional ones will look at that other group and say were you a bunch of Baptist y'all are a bunch of Church of Christ my goodness you ain't got the Holy Ghost here and then they will fight back and say you bunch of Pentecostals it's so sad that that's going on in our message people in the message taking clips of of our church services and clips of other church services and showing them in their church and telling their churches these people are Pentecostal we are and I'm not even bashful about it I'm not backward about if they think they're going to humiliate me by doing that that's one of the greatest compliments they could give me now if they said I a Church of Christ I'd cry like a rat eating onions oh my goodness if they said he's just like a Baptist I'd repent God what in the world's a matter with me shake me Lord well praise the Lord I love the way brother random goes into this he said I I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains little mountains he's got Plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the season Seasons it shows he's a god of variety now watch him bring it from the creation to human beings he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind and you find all different kinds of people in his kingdom oh my goodness so you mean we got dogmatic people in the Kingdom blusterous people in the kingdom and then we got some that's fine of course every one of us think we're that right we know who everybody else is but we know who the fine ones are now watch how he brings this to the apostles he said look at St Peter and judge him by Andrew now this is what causes the problem because a song leader natured a certain way a pastor natur a certain way there are some preachers that preach and never take off their coat if I didn't I'd catch on fire cuz I get so hot my metabolism Soares so much I'm telling you I'm just being honest with you I I would literally be ringing wet if I didn't do it I ain't got nothing against a man that don't take his coat off I don't understand why he's got a problem with me taking mine off so what do we do we judge one another by the way we like it so we like church this way this way this way and then if we go to another church and we say Lord have mercy I was scared te totally to death I never heard just screaming in my life I never heard that Lord if you all think Word of Life Is Wild the next time I go to brother Fred mullen's church I want to take you all with me you'll understand we're a tame bunch of little white people well praise the Lord but now watch how he Likens this look at St Peter and judge him by Andrew Andrew is that prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time that reminds me of brother Daryl every time I read of this and the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands anybody know what the word Firebrand means what you're fixing to Firebrand when someone is known for being wildly devoted to a cause or idea they're called a fire brand a fire brand enjoys pushing buttons and stirring up passions now you all since I've read that mean meaning automatically family members people you go to church with starts coming in your mind I ain't even going to look at y'all right now I I ain't going to do that because now you're thinking of people right Mama Maybe daddy brother sister a Firebrand is a passionate person who may enact change in a particular cause commonly political or social sometimes this person as seen oh my goodness as a ramble Rouser or a troublemaker and you mean Peter was a fire BR now if you all are thinking that about me tonight my feelings are going to be hurt bad and the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands that preached and Paul was more scholarly like more like the prophet something that would just set back so which one of these brothers was right so now which one would people tend to make their favorite you know the answer to that depending on how they are so if they lean a certain way then they would say oh that's my favorite preacher right there absolutely I mean they ain't nobody can touch him well you watch that preacher and you get a good idea of the way they are now you see what's wrong is that brother renam read it talked about it so many times and you hear it quoted constantly you know that that people get one another's spirit so he said you watch the pastor of a church and he said if that Pastor jerks his neck a certain way he said you watch a lot of the congregation and they will jerk their neck a certain way well I jerk my leg a certain way the only one I know in this church that does it is little boys that's impersonating me I ain't seen none of you sisters do that I ain't seen none of you young men do that I I ain't seen another preacher in the church that does that now you know what that makes me happy you understand what I'm saying that makes me happy because you don't want to be like me what you want to be is the way God Made You Now if I stand up there and jerk my neck and I see everybody in the congregation even the little guys and they're stand there jerking their neck that's going to make me so sad cuz I'm going saying that they've got their eyes on the wrong person they want to be like me we want to be like the Lord Brother Ram never blasted and spoke against a man that run and all that sort of thing H well returning Jubilee He says back to a Pentecostal inheritance yes sir that's your possession denomination's not your possession Pentecost is your possession not a Pentecostal organization your fathers come out of such a thing the Pentecostal experience is your possession again p Pentecost I sent this to brother Daryl yesterday absolutely loved it Pentecost is the only thing that is going to prove Christianity now remember when not talking about Aus his street 1906 but the original Pentecost I don't blame the devil for not wanting us to be original Pentecost because he knows that's the only thing that that will prove Christianity you can't prove it by science you can't prove it by nothing but by a Pentecostal experience you Baptists know that you methodists and Presbyterians whoever you are you know it takes a a a Pentecostal experience to prove God that's why I want every young person in our church to have one now does that mean that you'll act like me or act like some of the more emotional ones no look at Andrew I just read to you about Andrew a apparently Andrew was not an emotional guy the way that Peter was but he had the same Holy Ghost maybe Andrew was a crier which I would remind you crying is an emotion so preachers that cry all the time I know some preachers and they cry they cry at weddings they cry at alar calls they cry at this they cry at that and yet preach against emotion to no end and I'm thinking maybe you need to broaden your understanding of what emotions are you know notice he says it takes a Pentecostal experience to prove God and that's to each individual it does improve the organization it proves the individual so quoting the prophet don't prove you're a message believer believing Malachi for don't prove it and you won't prove God just by being able to prove that brother R was a prophet but by having a Pentecostal experience the resurrection will prove itself out of you marriage of the Lamb Christ has invited us to sit in Heavenly places with him and we're ashamed of it many people are ashamed to say they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecostal people that's right they're ashamed to say it we're ashamed of him now he's talking about the queen of course that Esther replaced her VY the queen wouldn't come she refused to come and it humiliated him his face turned red and everybody noticed it I wonder if Jesus face don't turn a little red too when he calls on us for a work calls on the Pentecostal movement for fellowship and Brotherhood and we're so tightly organized in little groups till we won't B for the other getting so worldly and things like that we're getting ashamed of the name of Pentecost now you know what's what's even worse than that is that people in the message are ashamed of their Pentecostal experience and ashamed to see anybody that would act like they did on the day of Pentecost so if brother Brandon was here now and he could preach I wonder what he'd say to some of these message churches and message preachers I tell you he he' blast them he'd burn their hide you say you believe what I preached I never preached that where'd you get that at he'd have to because that's what he preached when he was here we're getting ashamed of the name of Pentecost some people is afraid to say well I I'm a Christian I'm glad I got a Pentecostal experience I'm glad to Bear the name of Jesus Christ the greatest privilege I ever had is to say I'm part of him are Are you ashamed of Divine Healing Are you ashamed of the Full Gospel Are you ashamed of your Pentecostal experience I'll say tonight I'm not so let me ask you what would you all think if Sunday I come back and I got to preaching and I took off running and I jumped up on the platform there on the pulpit and I sat right up here I climbed up on the pull pit and I was sitting here and my legs were hanging off dangling like that and I had the microphone in my hand and I was preaching 90 miles an hour what would y'all think would y'all classify me as Pentecostal what would some of the message people think boy that clip would go round and around the world wouldn't it I want you to look at this Pentecostal he's always been p costal I'll tell you one thing he needs to come to the message H okay now what I'm going to do is change the scene so it's not going to be me upon that Pulpit it's going to be your Prophet read it with me Redemption and completeness of Joy here some time ago I was preaching in a little church oh I haven't got very many Pulpit manners according I guess to the Theology of the day so I guess I got a little unruly and I jumped up on the pull pit like that and grabbed the microphone in my hand and sat there and my feet swinging off everybody okay do I need to dial 911 so I wonder if some of these preachers who are constantly blasting motion and calling people like brother Daryl of Pentecostal and people like me and Brother David S oh Lord have mercy David Soler di in the O Pentecostal well if they don't call brother brandham that then they're a hypocrite amen right thank you I was just making sure y'all could still say that wonderful word I love to hear so my feet are swinging off preaching just as hard as I could I come to myself brother Brandon was actually beside himself so I come to myself I didn't know what I was doing oh Lord why did this quote have to be in the message oh no no doubt it was left there specially for me cuz the Lord knew I got one one young down there that ain't afraid to read it that's exactly right in a few minutes I got lost again and I found myself down in the middle of the aisle rolling up my trouser leg I don't know why so now if I would have done this on Sunday and you all would have seen this and you'd thought poor brother dony he's so stressed out he he he's lost his mind but of course if I do it now on Sunday you all won't think that will you your parents will of course they they will they'll have a meeting afterwards and try to vote me out because they wouldn't hear and heard this quote read so isn't it amazing that we change the way we look at things when we hear it from the right source so what's so sad is that many brothers who's constantly preaching against emotion oh my that music is gone let's everybody get up oh it ain't nothing bunch of emotion it ain't nothing so how do we know that it wasn't nothing but a bunch of emotion now are we going to say that brother brandham all this that he was doing was nothing but pure emotion what in the world has been under the anointing War of the Holy Ghost got to do with a preacher running out in the aisle rolling up one of his Brit's legs but of course none of us will say anything about that will we so brother Brandon was so beside himself he didn't know where he was at roll up his Brites L now according to him you can get this be on the website there this quote in a few minutes I got lost again and found myself down the middle of the aisle rolling up my trouser leg I don't know why I but I'd like to stay there a while so he was somewhere other than that building praise the Lord and there's one thing I'd like to say I was somewhere that I sure was enjoying myself and I lived off of it for several days afterward can I read you another one that's good cuz I was going to anyway but it's just nice when y'all nod your head about 15 years ago tonight I was standing on this platform with a big chart teaching and there was a little Pentecostal group coming from Louisville and I never did believe in them people dancing the way they did it's one thing I love about this man is honesty I never did believe in them people dancing the way they did and there was a little lady come up here to play the Piana they was going to play a special and beat on the Thimbles and on the washboard and some of them beat on a tan can and I was very much a Critic of it so I thought what's going to happen and the woman come up to play the special and she got to playing that lady got to beaten on the washboard this little bronde headed girl jump out there on the floor and begin to dance in the spirit me sitting in the seat of the scornful oh wow I wonder how many message people today if something like this would were to happen would be sitting in the seat of the scornful and I said I wish you'd look at that and I began telling my church they was all wondering what I was going to do about it now here this is a Baptist Church this is Brother Bam's church and it was started as a Baptist Church so you imagine now they're all looking at their Pastor uhoh what's he going to do I kept looking at her and I thought look at that now isn't that something making a Tavern out of my church making a Tavern out of my church and I was sitting there not knowing any better I wasn't saying anything but in my heart I was thinking it and I watched her there a little while and she was dancing the first thing you know I said now wait a minute I wonder if the lady has got scripture for it and I begin to think about the scriptures and I said where was dancing ever ordained the first place in the Bible that right I thought well what made them dance I see the children of Israel when they across the Red Sea Miriam looked back and seen those taskmasters drowned she pick up a tambourine and begin to dance and beat this tambourine run down the shores danc and the daughters of Israel followed her dancing and I thought that's Victory and I've seen David and one his sweetheart sitting up there behind this fan of Fanon looking at her cute little boyfriend David standing out there and here he come the ark and brother Graham talked about a while ago crossing the hill and when David seen it coming he danced around and around and around while she said you embarrass me he said if you don't like that watch this and around and around and around he went you know what oh children God looked down out of heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart so God didn't look down there and say I'm ashamed of you get down there dancing and carrying on but God looked at him and said David that's so moved me you're a man after my own heart oh and I saw you know there's one thing the matter with me I haven't got enough Victory maybe rut R Shaggy I'm afraid that's what's wrong with a lot of our message people they've got all kinds of quotes all kinds of doctrines all kinds of theology but they ain't got very much Victory right sir oh my I got to sitting there I got I want you notice how identifies this I got my Methodist foot patent his Methodist foot I got my Methodist foot patent and the first thing you know God my judge for I knowed what I was doing I was out there on that floor dancing around with that [Laughter] girl so if every preacher in the message that preaches against me dancing Don't Preach against brother random doing it they're a hypocrite that's and they are disqualified from being a pastor cuz a pastor is supposed to be blameless and you can't be a blameless hypocrite that's it amen so if they don't call brother brandom a Pentecostal just like to do me or any other person that gets emotional it shows to me they're a hypocrite and they're not fit to be in the pullit boy this is going to get me big trouble ain't it I found myself on the floor dancing around with that girl that's right then I said God take me out of the seat of the scornful let me look at anything sensibly before I ever pass a judgment anymore I say Lord help us tonight amen God does things peculiar oh praise the Lord don't you love him have I got time for just part of one more is it wrong to wear mascara slash dye eyelashes I know many women dye their eyelashes black to avoid wearing mascara but are you not achieving the same goal I wear mascara sometimes but feel people look at that differently than dying your eyelashes are they both wrong question mark neither question mark Second Kings 9:30 and when J was come to jezrael Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out a window now there ain't no way I can cover all this question tonight because and looking at this I went back into the toic area era of Egypt I went into the romanic era I went Plumb back into the era of the Phoenicians the ashdod ites different places trying to bring historically where this come from so I want you to notice what happened now so J Hugh he's coming in Jezebel hears that he's coming Jezebel is about 53 to 55 something like that J is a much younger man but this worked on Ahab and it worked on other men that she had tried to seduce by her beauty so she does the same thing again so she painted her face now this is what the Bible says painted her face so let me share with you now a little bit of the history that I found died the upper and under eyelids a common practice in the East even at the present day the effect is to increase the apparent size of the eye to give it an unnatural brilliancy representations of ey thus embellished occurred on the Assyrian sculptures now we're talking about 1,700 years something like that before the Lord Jesus ever even came on the earth so this has been a practice and I will say a heathen practice for Millennia according to the still common practice of Oriental women she painted her eyebrows and her eyelashes with a pigment composed of antomy and zinc which is the Arabic coal the Romans also painted their eyes plany which was a Roman historian says such is their affection of ornament that they paint their eyes also that this painting was with stulum or antimony is plain from the words of sapri a theologian and Bishop of Carthage which was martyred in 258 ad now here he is admonishing the Christian women and this is what he tells them anoint your eyes not with the devil's antimony but with the iav of Christ juvenile a Roman poet from the 2 Century he said that men as well as women in Rome practiced it now listen to where all this comes from some it comes from ancient Rome it comes from ancient Egypt from ancient Assyria so it's it dates it's pre Christendom so it was the way of the Heathen notice again now he said that men practice it too but watch how the prophet and why I'm against organized religion but this mother Babylon had caught herself a bunch of chickens slick chicks painted up bobbed hair called themselves Christians and she got a cage full of them you preachers that stand in the pit and let them women get by with that shame on you to make your deny ination or more God will require that of your hand come out of it my sheep hear my voice a cage of hateful heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God would rather be like the world than to be like Christ when you see woman a woman with a lot of makeup on it goes to show she's empty inside she's false inside that's exactly right I seen one the other day with green hair that's right had all that green stuff there in her eyes Now watch how that he identifies it now when he was 14 he got shot him and a friend were were hunting and his friend allowed his gun to go off and it was a shotgun which means that there was many tiny pellets for you sisters that don't know in a shotgun shell instead of being one bullet so whenever the the gun went off then all these pellets hit brother random as a boy inside of his legs well they thought he was dying he' bled a big majority of his blood out the nurse that was standing by said think of it he's just a boy and he felt himself sinking now he he wasn't saved there he felt himself sinking and he was he was dying and entering into the regions of the lost now this was more than just a near-death experience he said after a while I heard the most mournful sound that I ever heard it was the awfulest feeling now when he talks about this he said A Burning Flame would have been a pleasure which is hard to imagine EXP experiencing A Burning Flame would have been a pleasure compared to where he was now remember he says that God will never condemn a person to a lake of fire without first judging them you can read of all types of people who have near death experiences and many of them will say they went to a fire well I'll tell you what's happening right there that is not reality by the word and demons out of hell know that so there letting them experience something that is not even true in the order of God they go to the regions of the lost by the word but them Devils know there's no hope for them so they will be able to conjure up and be able to produce a fiery flame a fiery feeling a just God never sends man to a burning Lake of Fire until he does it now you talk about them demons that are so rotten and so corrupt they will tor tment people with flames and the people think they're going there actually they're going here they go to the Lake of Fire afterwards and he said there's no way even a literal burning fire would have been a pleasure oh Lord have mercy to the side of what this was now these Visions now they've never been wrong it was one of the most horrible things I ever had and I heard a noise and it sounded like some kind of haunted Affair and I looked coming and it was women and they had green stuff and I could just see their face and they had this green stuff under their eyes and their eyes look like they were run back and they had their eyes run back like the women today paint their eyes run back like that just their eyes and their face and they were going oo oo oo and I screamed out oh God have mercy on me have mercy oh God where are you if you'll only let me go back and live I promise you I'll be a good boy so this is what he sees when he goes down into the regions of the Lost isn't it amazing that these beings that were there in that realm were looking like the women on earth so wonder where it come from so they had started taking on the image of the regions of the Lost several years ago I went into Walmart and I wanted to someone had told me of the different images that were on some of the rock and roll albums that's when you could still buy albums and I wanted to go in there brother Joe and look at it so I'd be familiar with it myself and as I started flipping through some of those things I mean it was it was frightening AC DC um I don't even remember the names I've never listened to rock and roll so I don't know anything about it but as I begin to listen or look at that rather and I went back and listened to this at brother brandham saw and I be to see a correlation that hell had be to vomit out its influence and I noticed many of those rock and roll guys were painted up as well and they would have some of the most strange bizarr looking outfits that were on them and then brother Tim PR had told me that he had heard a a podcast been several years ago and it was some of these guys that play the guitar and different instruments of rock and roll and they would ask them why do you dress a certain way why do you do a you know dressed a certain way or have your hair a certain way or have facial hair in a certain way you do why don't you get rid of that he say oh no no no no I would lose my power to play the way that I do if I don't have this image cuz there's something about this image that when I dress that way I comb my hair that way I stick out my tongue a certain way it moves all over me you think how frightening that human beings on the Earth are coming under the influence of demons and they become a transmitter of demonic power so that's why people go to these concerts and they get under this influence and they get all fired up and they leave with demons on them why it's a place for demons together so if they're influenced what about us being influenced by the Holy Ghost now notice he said so help me these weary creatures all around and I had just been a new arrival the most hideous horrible ungodly feeling look like great big eyes big eyelashes out like that run back like a cat back like this and green stuff and like it had cankered or something and they were going ooh ooh ooh oh what a feeling so sisters you want to look pretty you're supposed to but you don't have to look worldly to be pretty and then I'd like to call your attention that whenever he goes beyond the curtain of time and somewhere around February March something like that of 1960 and the first thing he sees there the first thing he saw in the regions of the Lost was women the first thing he sees when when he goes into the sixth Dimension were women they had not come and said you woman hater why did you torment us why did you hate women but they were screaming our precious brother our precious brother I want you to notice their appearance he never mentioned one of them that had anything around our eyes she didn't have on fake eyelashes she didn't have on high heel shoes she didn't have on tight clothes and decent dressed I hope you understand why I'm coming from that we are caught in this lapse of time somebody just said to you like this because this is the way the prophet taught it there's three realms beneath us three Realms beneath us and there's three above us and we're caught in the middle so every day our lives are constantly under the influence of those three Realms below us and those three Realms above us and there's a part of all of us even though we're Christians Holy Ghost filled that can still feel the negative effect of those three Realms down this way and that's this right here because this has not been born again so this is why we pray lead me not into temptation but Deliver Me From Evil is that right because this flesh has not been redeemed and the devil knows that he knows his rights and he'll do everything he can to try to affect us in a negative way so he is doing everything he can you imagine that the prophet in 1961 said the lid has been tore off of the kill and demon powers are streaming in every direction if we could be able to look around us today this very day you've lived you've you worked you've went to school whatever you've done if you could have saw the spirits that were on the people that you worked with the people that's at Walmart wherever you go it would be horrifying I'm personally glad I don't I'm not allowed to see a lot of that realm I've been able to see it I've seen demons before I've seen Angels before but I don't mind telling you I'm glad I'm not made to deal with that realm because it frightens me it does and and and the prophet said every time as many times as he was in the presence of the angel of God it still made him and left him numb that was what it did to him but every one of us are constantly day in and day out impounded from this three realms and then the prophet said you imagine all the glory of God all the great mercy and the forgiveness and the kindness of God and it's all funnel down into a little 2-in pipe all that's coming down into a 2-in pipe and you're standing at the bottom of that 2-in pipe and that pipe is about to burst it's a it's shaking it's quivering it's it's rattling all that pressure all that that he wants to give us and all this down here want to come up and haunt you and torment you what were those women in that region doing haunting this 14-year-old boy if you've got the Holy Ghost tonight and you're sealed by the spirit of God they can never get your soul but they will haunt you you've heard me tell it before and I feel I should tell just remind you again I was a Pentecostal preacher I was up in Michigan Carol wasn't with me on that trip I was staying at the pastor's house I went to preach that night went to bed that night and in those days I was a pretty sound solid sleeper I'd sleep pretty good I did say in those days and I was awakened by the headboard was right against the wall but the headboard hit the wall and made a noise and the bed moved and as it did it it woke me up well I was sleeping on my back so when I opened my eyes I see a being standing at the end of my bed a little bit taller than than I am cloaked in solid black his head had a cloak on and a hood like a hoodie but it was a very deep hoodie and his head was back inside this and his eyes I could see his eyes and I could see his mouth of course whenever I woke up it scared me to death I don't mind telling you it scared me I put my hands behind me and I I was climbing up out of the bed like this and I said Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus he come right against it hit the bed again took his finger and his finger looked like this real long kind of crooked out from under this black vase and he said I've come Audible Voice I've come to take your life again I said in the name of Jesus I rebuke you I rebuke it remember this far I comes the message again he bumped the bed and he couldn't go no farther I said in the name of Jesus I rebuke you go back to hell where you come from that time he backed up again again went backwards right out of the wall totally disappeared you said but don't want to wor what I ever do if I ever seen something like that if you're not called to handle that don't worry God won't let you see it but just know they're around you every day of your life that's what tries to talk you into doing wrong that's what tries to discourage it say oh I'm just so discouraged I I don't want to go to church if you could see those beings that are talking to you you'd want to go to church every day you'd want to be around godly people and godly things every day You' never want anything to do with them but they cloak thems and Veil thems few years after that we was living in West Virginia I was working with a man of the name of Ari West you can go to YouTube and type in his name Ari West and you'll see me sitting behind him playing a guitar I look much younger than I do now but he had preached in West Virginia and Carol was expecting our youngest daughter Erica Erica was actually born down there and he had preached that night and I was driving him back home he was about 2 and a half hours and Carol was getting pretty close to her time of delivery so he and I were coming back every night after the after the service so he had preached and he was asleep then West Virginia roads is just like this curvy so there wasn't much traffic trff on him and I was just going down the road I was trying to be quiet music would keep him awake so I didn't have anything going so I was just driving you know talking to the Lord just kind of singing being quiet I happened to look in the rarie mirror and when I did I saw that being again in the back seat again his head set back in that cloak them eyes peering at me but this time I just whispered I thought what a difference I whispered the name of Jesus and he disappeared I believe God let that happen to me for a reason to help me see CU remember I was a Pentecostal so whatever I had done I had to do it to the top of my voice I had to scream I had to run I had to holler the devil won't move if you don't scream and holler but the Lord was teaching me something then I never forgot it I didn't have to scream I didn't have to holler I whispered one night we was in that church a woman come up for prayer she was demon possessed we prayed for her having a prayer line so brother West pointed for Carol to come up and pray with the woman so Carol comes up to pray for her and this demon and this woman Carol kind of got over the woman like this and the woman took her hands up and went around Carol's neck just like this she was screaming rering like a snake absolutely awful horrendous and it was phenomenal to watch it because she was taking her hands and she was trying her best but she couldn't choke her it's like there was an invisible something around Carol's neck and that demon Ed woman now believe me demon-possessed people are so strong I saw a woman one time tiny tiny woman her husband was trying to hold her her son was trying to hold her several people in the room trying to hold her when I walked into the room and she let out a scream like a man in a man's voice and said get him away from me get him away from me I hate him you'll never make me leave I was in the Garden of Eden but you see children greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world Amen I'm not sharing these things with you to scare you but to let you know they're all around us so they'll try this little thing or that little thing to get you to compromise maybe you break over and you listen to a song you shouldn't listen to or maybe your sisters you'll put on just a little teeny bit of something makeup or whatever and you feel really funny about doing it be all right it's okay it's just it's just a little bit but what was it that influenced you to do that actually there was no Daughters of God in the sixth Dimension that that looked that way even in the early Christian Church it was not amongst them it was amongst the heathens the Romans the infidels the unbelievers let's B this together Lord Jesus how we love you tonight father Lord I'm so grateful that we have you to help us I can't imagine what's around us every day of Our Lives I know this Lord I would not want to live one hour without you I cannot imagine what your Prophet went through he he give us a little bit of an Insight he said he would go to his hotel room at night after he' cast out devils and them demons would come in the room and they would rub their flesh against him he would hear chains rattling all night long cuz they was angry and upset Lord help these young people to realize this is what's against them this is what tries to talk them into doing wrong May the adults the older people that are streaming this tonight may they realize the same may they realize that's what tries to make them get angry at their Pastor when he tells them the truth may they realize it's never the holy ghost that will anoint them to get upset at a preacher that preaches the truth but it's one of these demons I've described tonight oh but they keep their self hid because they know if these people realize it was them they wouldn't have nothing to do with it so they Veil theel behind a trend they Veil their self behind a fashion a modern look or this or that because they know if these young people and any other young people would ever see what that Demon's trying to lead them to they never have nothing to do with them Lord God May every preacher realize the same it's demons that will try to get them to compromise on the word get them to say things that's contrary to what the scripture the message taught they think they're using so-called wisdom how many demons have veiled thems under the cloak of wisdom socalled how many preachers have got under the inspiration of demons and have struck the move of God the move of the Holy Spirit Lord Jesus help us that we'll never do that father the prophet tells us it was that nicat and spirit in the first age that cried to get away from those screaming people that move of God I wonder if that same niat in spirit is not in the ranks of our message doing the same thing [Music] Lord God we don't want to be stirred just by music Lord we want to have a love for you and a victory in our soul and there is no music around we want to have the shout of the king in our heart whether we're singing What A Mighty Fortress Is Our God or there's going to be a meeting in the air we love you Jesus Lord keep me from demons father I know this is only a small representation of the Youth of our church but I pray for them but I pray for the others that for whatever reason couldn't be here tonight Lord keep our youth Lord not only the youth but keep me Jesus Keep every one of the people who come here Lord may we realize what an army of hell is after us but Lord Jesus may we be be so hid in you that the devil can't find us in order to get to our soul he'd have to be saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost then he'd be our brother so there ain't no way for him to get us as long as we're hiding in you Lord Jesus we worship you toight father so Lord we don't want to be pumped up we don't want to just be emotionally stirred but there ain't one thing wrong with the spirit of God moving on us and our emotions becoming involved why in the world would I want to give you my emotions Lord if people go to sporting events and they go to dances and Honky Tonks and they'll dance the night away till the we hours of the morning what in the world's wrong with us giving you our heart our soul our mind and yes our emotions because as human beings you made us with emotions Lord as I reminded them of it last night in John 11 that Jesus wept what was weeping an emotional expression so before you spoke the word you expressed human emotions and then you cried out with a loud voice another human emotion may we get away from this old nickel and Antichrist Spirit that's trying to make us cold and formal God I refuse as long as I'm the pastor of this church for

protected from the storm that rages when the waterers rise and I run too high for you I found my Hiding Place when the w allers rise and I run too high Lord in you I find my amen did you enjoy that I tell you I like the question and answers because so many times we're searching for the middle of the road and I think that's something that God has has put amongst us is to help us to to get in there where we can't find our a way we have somebody that can point us the way to the middle of the road and I'm so thankful that that God has given us a pastor with the wisdom and the understanding and the wherewithal to study the way he does to to help us find that middle of the road it's it I think sometimes we over we don't we take for granted with for what we got you know I had a somebody was telling me the other day about he's a renowned pastor of a church streams our services because we have a pastor that don't compromise and he's in the middle of the road and you you go as your pastor to us brother brandom said you your spiritual Shepherd if your shepherd's in the middle of the road your sheep are going down the middle of the road and then sometimes you have to have something like question and answers to heard you back to the middle of the road you know listening to what he was talking about emotions you we read in the scripture where it says the holy spirit will lead you into all truth that's not just word that's your actions your emotions things you do out in life your everyday life the Holy Spirit Will leads you in all truth you know he was talking about brother Brandon was talking about that emotion how he got on the pull pit said he didn't know where he was but what he said after that was he said I feasted on that for days I remember the time when I felt like the lord gave me the Holy Ghost 20 something years ago so on a Saturday night I can't tell you what song was played I can't tell you if it was a fast song I remember brother Donnie fraying I remember him encouraging the people to worship and I remember hearing myself it's all I remember and this feeling that came over me I didn't care I didn't care where I was you could have put me on a street corner you could have put me in the middle of the mall I didn't care but when my brother Brandon made that statement I feasted on that for days I I remember that that's 27 years ago and I still feel it once you have that true experience you'll feel that for the rest of your life you know we talk about emotions we have human emotions there's a difference between human emotion and eternal emotion that Eternal emotion is when you walk to them Gates and you get consumed as the bride of Christ that's when you know it's real here when God gives you that here that's the same you know brother Bram says you take your character with you if you don't worship here you're not going to worship there when God gives you something that is is not even human your human nature cannot work up the kind of motion that the Holy Spirit brings a song can't work it up if you get to dancing and shouting because the song is fast you're going to forget it you're not going to Feast on that tomorrow but when that Holy Ghost comes in here and says this is where I want to shout that's right you'll shout for eternity from that moment on you'll shout inside through good times through bad times that shouting never ends there's sometimes he lets it become physical for other people to see so you can be contagious to somebody else so let's not forget that this is why I like love brother Donnie is the way he brings emotion and the gifts and how they're put in order in the church he's not in this side that's overboard that if you you don't have the Holy Ghost if you ain't doing it or you don't have the Holy Ghost if you do it too much you got the middle of the road and that's where the Bible has taken us that's where the Prophet took us and you have to have a pasture that take you down the same road so I hope you were blessed tonight man I sure was I I I'll be honest with you I I struggled today I did I don't want to get out of here so bad but that just when him saying tell my brother Brandon feasting on that for days I was like I can still Feast on it 20 something years AG ago I can remember that and know now I know who I am I never lost it so when God puts that in there that's why brother Rob talks about so much of coming together we need each other you might have a portion of holy ghost that needs to be contagious to somebody else that you've never even associated with so take that with you tonight if you go as absolutely wonderful if there's a question whether I should do it or don't do it don't do it you're safer that way so be mindful of the meetings coming up this weekend we're trying to work on some stuff for Saturday for the Youth I have to get with sister Rell and brother Michael Bailey to find out um how much portions of the gym if we can use any Saturday or not I don't know on that brother Ben Davis has offered to um cook some burgers and grills so I think brother Timmy and brother Tony Ward are going to try to help put activities together so be praying about that pray for the service got something that you need delivered from it can happen it can happen tonight but I believe the Lord's going to move for us so God bless y'all brother Jesse sing us something God bless you I don't think this is an old song I don't think we've sung it in a while but Heaven's Jubilee I thought about it tonight while we're sitting there some glad morning we shall see Jesus in the
