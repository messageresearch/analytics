in prayer if you have a need that you want to hold before the Lord as we go to pray Heavenly Father Lord one of the greatest opportunities that we could ever get is to bring our need and lay him at your feet Lord we know as humans we go through so many things so many battles Lord as we read the request every service lord they're all different thank you but to you lord they're important every single one and fathers we bring them to you this night tonight father we we know Lord as we've heard in this week father when you when he was talking about how you speak to that mountain and be cast into the sea Lord in our own eyes sometimes our mountains look immovable but Lord when we look through the eyes of God my brother Branham said God's fate drops inside that mountain has to move so every need here Lord every request Lord we don't have to wait till dedication service to get special ministers to to lay hands on us we don't have to wait till a prayer line we don't we don't even

something in her throat and we prayed as a family and she had to go for a scan yesterday and they said nothing's changed and now she's able to eat better and she's able to swallow it better I just want to give thanks to the Lord to that because when that happens the devil automatically wants to put fear automatically wants to tell you that something bad's wrong and I know she was fighting it

wouldn't keep every step just exactly right he knew I'd mess up he knew you'd Miss up but he loved us in spout of all those things armor grateful for them God bless you let's turn tonight to First Corinthians chapter three if you would First Corinthians chapter 3. verse 11. we will um consult the master builder again tonight for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation what Foundation Jesus Christ so it's possible for a man to build on Jesus Christ gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble so a person can actually build that on Jesus lay that on Jesus Christ that's where a lot of organized religion is built on on the principles of what they call Christian Christianity which the Romans call christianos Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is so you can have different sorts of work built on Jesus Christ I show them want mine to be the right sword don't you if any man's work abide which he has built thereupon he shall receive a reward so notice rewards is joined together with works so you can work and work and work and work and get to the end of the way and the fire will try it and if it doesn't pass the fire test you lose it all every bit of it every bit you say God's not like men that he look I said well you know what you've done it you labored so long I just can't see that it's right for me to not reward you nope you lose it all but you yourself will be saved so as by fire if any man's work abide which he hath built there upon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire oh I made a lot to be remembered to that as we pray before we pray I've got a couple of requests that I'd like to make known to you sister Jill fleeman over in South Carolina we want to continue to remember our sisters had been battling with cancer for several years now I've already gone through a low spot right now so we'd like to remember her sister Joy Green had a pretty rough fall today at Walmart and heard her hurt her knees really bad back of her head she fell backwards hit the back of her head on the hard floor of concrete so they did X-rays and things like that but she's still not feeling very good so we'd appreciate if you'd remember her also Erica they still haven't found the cause of her fever but it has been doing better thankfully so if she's doing doing well through tonight hopefully she'll get to come home tomorrow so if you would remember that I mean he has to need requests on your heart heavenly father as we bow our heads we are so grateful the Lord Jesus that we have been given this opportunity that we could come together tonight to be able to worship sing praise pray adore be corrected Lord just whatever you have in your mind for this service is exactly what we want so father we bring these needs that we've mentioned to you Lord and we're praying tonight for sister Jill fleeman father you see Lord she's been battling this thing for several years now and we pray that you would help our sister father would you strengthen her Lord God would you bring healing Deliverance would you bring encouragement which a helper to not father we pray you see our sister joy as she took this fall today and Lord God really hurt her knees and hit the back of her head and father we're praying in the name of Jesus May there be no evil that O Come of this Lord God would you reach down and touch our sister even now Lord father we also asking you for Erica tonight that you would just be with her Lord and help her I know she's wanting to come home so bad father we just pray that you'd be with her and work that out Lord hundreds of hands are uplifted in the visible audience and no doubt many many more that we can't even see with our natural eye so we're praying to be mindful of the needs of your children maybe some are physical some physical those that some in their minds some in their bodies some in their Spirit some Lord It's a mental battle some lord it's their family could be finances whatever it is Lord God we ask you together as your children that you would just move form Lord help me dear God that I can get out of the way tonight and you can speak through me Lord something that would be a benefit to your people granted father we pray tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I don't know if you know it or not but actually face and works our husband and wife so if a man says he has faith and does not ever do any works brother Benham likened that to a man saying that he is married but he cannot produce a wife so I said oh yeah I'm a married man I'm an absolute I'm a married man well where's your wife ah well I don't know that's the way it says it works is Faith Express in Shreveport 1965. I don't know I I don't know well he said if he cannot produce that wife then I am going to doubt that he's married so it works whenever we go to looking at works and we're identifying works and reward many times people get in their mind oh you're talking about works for salvation there are no works at all included in Salvation that's a separate thing we believe on what God has already done and the church said and we accept that and we are saved by accepting the finished work at Calvary so nothing we do will ever bring Merit by which we can be saved will never be good enough we'll never be able to pay him back he don't want repayment he does not want us to pay him back for what he saved us from but what he wants us to do after he saves us then is our life to be quickened by the spirit of God and then we go to producing out of that Sanctified Holy Ghost fail life Fruit which is equivalent to work so those works is what in turn you and I will stand upon the elevated position when we walk before him not the white Throne judgment but the elevated place that John described in the Book of Revelation and we will receive a reward accordingly now for those works it is those things which God enables us to do so God caused some to be preachers some to be singers some to be musicians some to be helps some to be governments Paul mentions that Corinthians each one of us have something that we can do and that's all that God requires of each of us I'm so glad God will never require of me what God's given you the ability to do and the same way with you God will never require you to do what this man can do or that person can do only what he equips and qualifies you to do is the only thing that you and I will answer 4. now when brother Branham preaches works his faith Express I love the way he does it because he contrasts what Paul said about works and Faith with what James said about works and faith and it would be a stumbling sort of situation if it was not for an understanding to be brought together because Paul sets it forth in one way and it seems as if though that James says it in an entire different way but what the prophet does he catches it and brings it together and says the way Paul said it for us was what God saw about Abraham and what James saw was what man saw about Abraham when both of them are talking about Abraham so it's the same with us so we want what God sees about us when it comes to works and we also want what people will see about us when it comes to worse so we're not trying to work a way to Heaven we're not trying to work so that we can have a big reward well brother Donnie in other words the more I do the more I get no you've still got the wrong idea we want to do it simply because he calls us to do it that's the reason that we do it so we're not doing it for any type of Glory we're not doing it so that we can be you know lifted up by people and people will look at us and say oh he's such a great singer and she is such a great person and she does this and this and this no we've still got the wrong thing in mind now it's a shame but it's always been that even those many times that are used by God will battle that very saying I get so amazed whenever I will listen and I saw it in Pentecost coming up and I hate to say it but you see the same thing in the message it's almost like that when a preacher will pray for somebody you really have to listen close in every testifiers about it to figure if he's trying to get Glory out of that answered prayer if he's given glory to God you kind of Wonder because it's almost like it was them that done it well I prayed for a lot of people I ain't never healed nobody yet and I guarantee you they no other preacher ever done it either so I figure anybody that's ever got healed whether I prayed for him or you or anybody else it was not us that done the healing so I don't figure that we need to try to show that Glory with God but we need to keep ourself in that humble spot and realize we are unworthy servants in the first place but this is a very great battle because man when they are being used by God they will venture for not careful they will venture into that forbidden territory which is called God's Divine Glory now notice this what James says in James chapter 2 verse 26 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also so if a person says they have faith that God is going to heal them well what they're going to do they're going to start acting like they're healed even though they may not be able to do anything but wiggle that one finger so they're going to wiggle it with all the wiggling power they can they're going to testify they're going to give praise they're going to do everything they can do and are they buying their healing no they are expressing their faith by worse now you notice well as I do that when you go to testifying of something that is unseen the devil will try his best to make you afraid and he will try to tell you you're going to bring an embarrassment upon God and you're going to bring an embarrassment upon your family because what if it don't work uh-huh and you're telling the doctors you're going to be healed and then the doctors is going to come back and see you in your casket and what are you going to do well if you're dead you're going to do nothing that's pretty evident is it so he will try to intimidate us to get us not to testify about the power of God so what you want us to do he wants us to wait until after every symptom is already gone well you're not doing it by faith sin you're doing it by knowledge well come on somebody say Amen but Satan wants to intimidate you how many knows he's done it in your life and you go to testifying you can also witness to this I'm sure but when you go to testifying he will make you pay you say oh praise God God heal my back and God done this and you get up in the morning and you can't even hardly move and you think Lord have mercy I don't think I'll testify no more until it's all done gone you ought to testify more than you did last night because it ain't nothing but the devil trying to back you off from the promise of God now that is works that we can do notice James again in chapter 3 verse 13. now listen at the way he turns this who is a wise man who is a wise man among you let him notices be let him the wise man that's going to be endued with knowledge among you what notice his words let him show out of a good conversation out of a good conversation now the the English language is very tricky and some words aren't really compatible to the Greek and the Arab man now you would take this word conversation as you would in other places that we're going to read from tonight and you would think that it would mean you're talking but you see that's where when the English wants to translate this from the original that they took a word that they thought meant talk but actually it don't say talk it says Behavior so notice then read it this way you as a wise man and endude with knowledge among you let him show out of a good behavior his works with meekness and wisdom one of the very few verses in the Bible that you will find knowledge and wisdom and meekness all together in the very same verse Now watch how that James now remember James is not a prophet like Paul and his Revelation wasn't near as great as Paul's was but I'll tell you James had some real understanding about knowledge and wisdom now many times we sing a person that quotes the Bible and quotes the message and quotes and has a lot of knowledge about facts and this and that and the other and if we're not careful we will say that person has a lot of wisdom but wisdom and knowledge are not the same thing at all wisdom will teach you how to use the knowledge that you have accumulated you see somebody it was a lot of knowledge and not very much wisdom can make a bigger mess out of a situation than somebody that's as dumb as a cold bucket they know they're dumb and they know they ain't got no answer so they just sat around well I don't know I really don't know what to say about it but somebody that's got a lot of knowledge and they'll spout out that knowledge and they'll say this and that and the other and if they're not careful they with their knowledge will take a situation that big and turn it into that big because they use knowledge and not wisdom now I know it's not a gift that we want very much I realize it's not even a gift among the message that many people seek after many people would rather have tongues interpretation prophecy Discerning of spirits well I don't want why don't want anybody want a word of knowledge why don't anybody want wisdom why don't we want none of that is that less than the vocal gifts is that something that we don't consider needed the lack of it proves Among Us that we need and yet Paul identifies that as one of the great things that God would give the church anybody here want that anybody want wisdom few of you you'd rather have tons you'd rather have prophecy you'd rather have healing Miracles oh but you see God James whenever inspired by the spirit of God who is a wise man and in dude with knowledge among you which is a strange concurrence that he would use both of these in the same now this is a real Gifted Man this is a real gifted person a person who is wise and has wisdom but also has great volumes of knowledge at the same time who is the wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom now you notice that he does not say meekness of knowledge or if you can find somebody that's gotten meekness with knowledge you found a great thing because knowledge and meekness doesn't always go together notice how James couples this and makes it a union so what is it it's a coupling together of divine Natures of God which is imparted to the individuals that seek the deeper wisdom of God and the deeper understanding of God oh I know it won't be that many but it will be those that God can entrust and you know what Jesus never said that they will stand before me that day and have perfect wisdom perfect understanding perfect Revelation and he'll say to them depart from me I never knew you you'll never find Jesus ever saying that why if you have perfect wisdom perfect understanding perfect Revelation there's no way for you to be cast out of the economy of God because you are tied directly into the very Heart Of God himself but you can shout jump Run cast out Devils heal the sick raise the dead perform many mighty Miracles and shall be lost at the end of the way is that your Bible is that Matthew 24 sure now what so James says who is the wise man and endured with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom with meekness of wisdom so true wisdom will not speak boastfully true wisdom does not acknowledge flesh true wisdom does not boast in the vanity of humanity well that was quite catchy wasn't it it will not boast and the vanity of humanity so true wisdom boasts in the greatness of God and the littleness and insignificance of man it will boast in the great things which are Eternal and the vanishing things that are here around us and it will acknowledge that we are all but as a puff of wind which is here for a while and gone and in a few years people will barely remember your name so that's how important you are congratulations but yet wisdom will acknowledge not only what we are here in this life but what we are going to it will focus on becoming what God wants us to be instead of focusing well I can be a big person I can do this I can move up in the corporation and I can amount to something important that's not wisdom at all because wisdom will let you know you're going to have a promise of a tomorrow none of us here tonight do even these young people sitting here there's not even a promise that they will be alive in the morning but notice the way that James does this true wisdom will not speak boastfully but wisdom now notice this meekness is not weakness meekness is not weakness actually meekness is greatness now this is why Satan and his kingdom cannot identify with such things as this you see the Lord Jesus could Condon sin to such a level that the devil could never even go there he could never go to the place the Lord Jesus could there's no way the devil would have ever stepped down from the throne in glory had he ever attained to that Throne he would have never got off that Throne he would have never Condes sinned to the Earth to come and get you get me no way it's not in him to be able to condescend he must always brag about himself he must always look up to himself and think he's just a little bit more than all the rest of the Angels well come on I wish somebody preach with me tonight whether Prophet Joseph said in question 59 that the devil wanted to be a little bit higher than his boss and he said God has a hard time finding a man that the more he uses it that the literary gift and he said if God can use us and the more that he uses this the littler we get and the smaller we get but for most humans the more God uses them the bigger they get in their own eyes in their own eyes but you see when we go to doing that we are actually working away from the Providence of God and it will actually stop the flow of the channel of God oh may God help us but you see meekness is not weakness yet it would be identified by many as that but actually what it is it is power under control so it is a word that was similar that they would use to bridling a horse so a horse would be you know 16 hands high and maybe have real a lot of strength to these muscles and all but you put that bit in his mouth and you can do a lot with that horse you can clamp down on that horse and here's the symbolism of the way that God was showing that if he can find a people a meat person does not selfishly assert himself he always knows there's a fine line he or she there is a fine line right there between the glory that God shares with any human being and that line which God Alone takes to himself you see this is why you'd find the prophet saying statements like this when he was talking about someone that wanted to debate with him and argue with him and he said I could have took that word I could have tied that man and it no sooner left his mouth and he come back and said uh the Holy Spirit could have took the word now you see there was something about what he said that exalted his own ability and he come right there and caught it and corrected himself I hope we got enough of the same Holy Ghost to say well I'll tell you one thing I could do this and I could do that well I'll tell you friends if we if we hang around folks that do that all the time and they can get by with it more than likely they need more of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost sent them if they say they've got it it's not the same holy ghost that was in the prophet because it corrected him and it lets you and I get by with it something wrong somewhere you see the me person does not selfishly assert himself as being over the word over the brothers because as a matter of fact the word tells us let us each one esteem our brothers higher than ourselves well now I'm talking about Rapture material you all do want to go right so the Greek word that was you Sarah was as I said a horse that had been broken so that his power was under control so the meek person seeks to exalt the honor and the praise and the glory of God not to cater it is flesh not to cater to the Flesh of other people but to bring honor to the glory of God now I used to have a horse many years ago I've had all kinds of them I've had while walking horses and and no thoroughbreds and quarter horses and this and that and the other and I had a horse and his name was Andel and that horse was a barrel horse I mean that's what that is barrel racing horse well it was a horse that they raced around barrels and it was used in a rodeo and that horse was so sensitive that all I had to do I never had to pull the rain this way or that way but he was broke where all he would do is feel that neck grain barely touching his neck like this and if I touched it like that he's going to Dart this way if I touched it like this I didn't have to jerk and jerk as a matter of fact it took me a few days to learn how to write it and I wound up on the ground a few times because I would barely touch his neck with that ring and whenever I would to him that was a signal for him to go that way that's the way he was taught he was running race professionally and that's the way he did it well it's easy to see he was professional and I was a redneck hillbilly I didn't know exactly what I was doing well come on you might as well say amen and that's the way we are sometimes with the things of God we think we're professional Christians and we think we're so great but when we wind up on the good dirt eating dust a few times when might as well go and acknowledge it you're a redneck Christian you might as well just say it well just get up wipe yourself off and get back on and we'll keep on riding but after a bit I found that horse was such a pleasure to ride I could take him and watch him get on his back and I could lay that Rain Sound the right hand side and just leaned it there he would go around and around and around well it didn't take but two or three times for me and that was enough because I would get sick but he would go around and around and around and spin on that hind foot and he would go around and around why that's what he was trying to do yep that horse could have killed me that horse could have thrown me off big tall stocky horse he could have thrown me off he could have trampled me to death but he was under control under control so a little field just a little nudge on his neck and as soon as I would take it from the right side to the left side he would change and go the other way whatever I told him to do he was oh my it's a pleasure to be able to ride well you're saying if an animal could do that what about a son or daughter of God that is so sense send it to the holy ghost that the Lord just barely Taps us as we would say and we'll just go this way and then the Lord's go go that way do this pray read your Bible forgive that brother don't you have a grudge now don't you hold a hard feeling my wouldn't we be some kind of Christians if we could be as good a Christian as Andale was a horse oh my you see my meekness is The Right Use of power now this is what meekness does and wisdom is The Right Use of knowledge meekness The Right Use of power and wisdom The Right Use of knowledge so this is why that knowledge by itself what does the Bible say Paul writing about it knowledge puff us up knowledge puff us out well you know what I'm talking about because I don't know you know you've been I'm sure like me you run into some people they know a little bit about everything and if you don't think they do ask them and for 45 minutes later you'll find out they at least think they do and they cover this and they go to the moon and back and they come from Mars and they cover the surface of Jupiter and they go here and they go there and say whoa but they may have a whole lot of knowledge or at least think they do but they sure didn't have much wisdom especially since I was just asking what time it was so you see a person a lot of knowledge and they did totally totally avoid I just wanted to know if it's time for me to leave or not I want to jumping around the Rover I went down to the atmosphere pressure down to our thousand feet in the ocean I went over here and I went over there I simply wanted to know what time it was so did that impress me it did not so does that impress us if it does there's something wrong with us so meekness then we'll couple together with wisdom my what a powerful scripture then that James wrote notice again in First Peter chapter 2 verse 12. watch Peter now he uses the exact same word having your conversation honest among the Gentiles now let's read this word in the Greek and it is this manner of Life conduct and behavior very same word now that James uses so it's not just your talk just not your conversation and your language ability and your metaphors and all that that you know how to say but it is your manner of life I notice sure Peter is actually addressing the Believers and he said how did your conversation on us among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may be by your good works now notice not by the doctrines that you believe not but how much you're able to quote the Bible quote the prophet but they by your good works oh my notice which they shall be whole glorified God in the day of visitation so you mean people then seeing our good works now he's not talking about people that actually even like you but he said these people were speaking against the Believers but he said if you will live right and you'll have the right kind of works that them good works he said which they shall be whole and glorified God in the day of visitation which is one of the oddest words I've ever seen in my life in the Greek language used for this word that he used and it was Bishop prick visitation so it was the office of a Preacher I thought how peculiar us look in sitting in the hospital room today and sitting there steady look at this I thought my goodness that is that is profound why in the world would Peter use such a thing and he identified the day of the visitation of God with the identification of a god-called office that makes it pretty tough for those who don't believe in Preachers don't know notice he said that they may behold and glorify God in the day of visitation how many Christian me tonight the good works are absolutely imperative for a child of God what about you young people you think it's necessary for you or is this 45 and above is this 55 and above no it's absolute requirement for all of us now watch this in the unpardonable sin the prophet said let us hold fast our profession of faith without wavering he is faithful to his promise let us consider one another to provoke one another and to love and the good worse now remember this is the scripture we looked at last week and Hebrews 10 24 and this is the way then that brother Branham deals with that he said provoke their means to encourage so encourage one another unto love and to good works if you see a brother in the church now he's going to give an example of a good word if you see a brother in the church that's got something against the other brother don't say something to stir that thing up now we got a lot of stern Christians I said we got a lot of stern Christians in Christianity they like to stir up things uh-huh well I figure him you know amens is going to be scarce tonight but that's all right but you know you have a direct quote from your message telling you not to do such a thing notice what he says oh my don't say something to stir that thing up but say something that will bring them together so instead of trying to get in the middle of something and make it worse or to repeat well he said this about you and she said that about you I just thought as your best friend that you should know now this is just between me and you if you believe that oh my goodness well I I ain't told nobody but I'm going to tell you this uh-huh notice provoke one another under good works and to love is what we what now do you believe this is a must or you to believe that this wealth it's not really that important I personally believe this is a must praise the Lord me and one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve anybody else 13 14 15 16. okay okay 17 18 19 20. well the case did not want to be left out of that mess did he noticing this is what we must do what is that oh my goodness oh that's a man that's born again that's a man that's born again notice it because honestly now we're very happy to know that the Lord Jesus still lives and Reigns and loves his people and has a peculiar people a people zealous of good works and not jealous not jealous but zealous in other words they're zealots anybody familiar with the term Zealot you know what a zealot was anybody okay well in the days of the Lord Jesus on up to the time of the Masada and on Earth for a long time there there was a group of Jews and they rebelled against Roman Reign and they call them zealots because they had such a Zeal to break the Roman Hole uh the the thing that Messiah many of you may know the guy's name and he was a seller and many of them men that died there on Masada they were zealots so they were hated by the Romans because they could not stand Roman rule and yet this is what God wanted his people to be zealous not to be like they were but zealous of Good Works to have such a passion such a desire to do good works well for what reason brother Donnie because God wants us to do them so where do we get that Zeal we get it from our father not that we can be noticed not that people are going to say well I just have to tell you so and so done this for me and that for me and that's what we wait to hear about no we want to do it in such a way and hope nobody else even finds it out we just want to do it and say praise the Lord Brother I'd rather that you didn't even tell nobody that I did that you know just just sits between me and you and just God bless you and I love you and let it go with that well praise the Lord a people that are zealous of good works I found this amazing again I was sitting in the hospital today and setting a little bit on this and I want you to notice what the prophet said here and let your light shine we're Christ billboard and Christ is our sponsor how many knows what the billboard is you drive out on the interstate on the road and you're going down through there and you're going down Interstate 65 24 uh whatever it is and there's a great big McDonald's sign don't run on empty and there's a Big Mac and them gold and fries now they got a thousand calories in this and you know how many over 100 calories of that and a Diet Coke on the side oh my gotta balance out everything don't you and don't run on engine now what does that do that's by your eyes watching that billboard then it sends a subliminal message and you might not have even been that hungry but all of a sudden you find your car in autopilot and it's just turning off to the right and you find what am I doing what am I doing I pull right into McDonald's I don't even like McDonald's but what am I doing now that is the power of a billboard and yet here brother random identifies us as being Christ which is Christ possessive Christ billboard and he is our sponsor so instead of it being McDonald's or a hotel chain or some type of gas station Christ is our sponsor so it takes our life and puts us on for all display and of course Christ is updated so we're not just using paper no more but we're the digital Billboards now so we are totally digital so we can change from the morning to the evening we'll put on the goodness of God and then at noon he'll reprogram us and we'll put on patience and we'll put on Mercy and just as it's needed we're just walking around and the spirit of God just digitized us to the presence of the Lord somebody needs a smile somebody needs a door open for them and you say oh my goodness oh thank you sir thank you are you so where are you from you know where are you from heaven heaven you know they know you're really strange whenever you say thank you and have a nice day you know I'm talking about we're living in that kind of crazy world the doctor came in to see Erica today and she was talking to her and tell her she said the support group that you have talking about her family and so on she said you are so fortunate so blessed she said yes ma'am I am she she said 75 of the people that I see and this is one of the main doctors in Franklin Woods she said 75 percent of the people that I see don't have hardly any help or any support from family or friends nobody she said well I wish I could adopt some of them people out to people that would just come in and sit with them and be nice I thought what a cruel age we're living in that people don't even love their own families they don't even won't even go visit them and see them whenever they're sick and in the hospital and we say we are Christians well preach brother Donnie what kind of billboard are we advertising who are we advertising for Jesus said when you've done this to the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me you see friends it is not just something we ought to do to our family it's something we ought to do to the family of God notice the way it says that then we're Christ billboard and Christ there's our sponsor and this sponsorship is by Christ and he is giving us our life to sponsor him so now watch Once you become his billboard and that is his property that is his property so it's not a part of the outdoor living which is one of the main ones here in the South who owns many of the Billboards so they're the ones that you have to go to and Lease so they on the lease they on the rights if you want to put a sign of whatever more you have to contact them I'd like a sign on Interstate 40. I'd like one on here and there and there well it'll cost you so much so much all right I'll do it so you're the one that's sponsoring and what does that billboard do it puts out your message your message loves exit number 36 we have now RV hip hookups we've got fresh watermelon we've got cantaloupe boy oh my we want the hell what does that do if a billboard can do that to your mind and my mind what about a holy ghost filled Christian billboard that will give the world a smile that will let somebody know there is a God in heaven and he's not a dead Creed he's not a dead Church he's not a dead is it but he's a living resurrected savior a billboard oh my goodness notice this he goes on to say a simple clean billboard was Christ wrote across your life then men will see now notice what they're going to see they're going to see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven not you not you they're going to say oh so-and-so and so oh my goodness oh my goodness you know if we're not so careful friends we're going to get so tied up in the flesh of this person that person remember when you go to trusting in the arm of the flesh the prophet son told us God will cause that man to make a mistake in front of you to prove to you he is a man I don't care who it is don't you ever put your ultimate confidence in nomad you put your ultimate confidence in Jesus Christ all men are flawed you better do it absolutely I'm Flawless just like every other man you know and every preacher you know oh brother Tim Pruitt ain't flawed yes he is I know him not brother Donnie don't you go to Sam by the wrong Spencer is brother Ron you're probably listening to me tonight I'm seeing right now smiling that million dollar smile looking over sister Connie brother Ryan Betty I love you but you're flawed brother Andrew you're flogged brother down your flower and all the rest of you all in here and flow too that's why we go so well together we're all flawed there ain't nobody that we can look up to and make an idol out of oh my goodness oh Jesus boy it's bad when you go to preaching on sheep it's really dangerous and you go to preaching on preachers you're taking your own life in your own hands ain't you wow notice this then men will see your good works but it kind of makes you wonder if men are glorifying men what what what causes that because according to the the right way is that when they see your good works they won't glorify you that I should glorify the father so it makes you wonder about some of the works and some of the things that's happening is it not pointing to this man or that man or another man uh-huh well I'm preaching amen I've done it before it just takes twice as long though y'all think Shores the world I got a button in my mouth instead of a lifesaver now notice oh my then men will see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven that's it don't be smutted up with the trash of this world so every person here tonight that professes to be a Christian you are a billboard you're a billboard at work you're a billboard a church you're a billboard when you're over in the fellowship hall and when you've got the basketball aha come on now brother Donnie preach on that you're a billboard when you've got the volleyball you're a billboard when you're picking people to be on your side or not on your side you're a billboard every one of us are we all are Billboards so what are we projecting Christ or ourselves Christ what's most important to us well I'll tell you one thing I ain't no way in the world I'm going to get so and so on our side because they can't even play so in other words what's more important to you is winning than hurting somebody's feelings [Applause] brother Jackie what's this air set on buddy listen this I just heard it kick on thank you Jesus no wonder the world does not appeal to us we are A peculiar people sell us unto good works we have been recreated in him oh my to be children like unto our father I wonder friends whenever we look at that and we measure us as being a billboard what do people feel when they're around us do people feel comfortable being around us or if you're worse a little more money-wise do they not feel they belong to your class in the church well if they've got more than one class here you ain't following the teaching of your pastor I don't care if you make 500 a year or a half a million you ain't no better off than the person who draws food stamps and lives off of Social Security got just as much right to God got just as much right to me as your pastor oh my notice this in the thightown churches now works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show Force our face already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit works are fruit so Works will come out of a saved life it's the fruit that you're a Christian Matthew 7 16 you shall know them by their doctrines now how many sick they pray for how long the prayer line is you shall know them by their fruits two men gathered Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles now notice again it goes on then the same culture and the church age book if you are a Christian you're going to do what is right and your Works will show that your heart is right you see for those who do not make the connection of good works with a right heart then they believed their heart can be right with God and they can live like like the devil we have Christians people in this day that claim they are Christians and yet they smoke marijuana we are people who claim Christianity and curse look at Ron DeSantis running for president out of Florida of Christian oh yes absolutely identifies himself as a conservative you ever hear much of that man talking he cusses like a sailor oh I'm sorry I deflated some of you all look at what's called conservative look at Anheuser-Busch with what they've done and how much money they've lost I was just saying I just I just cannot believe not so much them but how many so-called conservative Christians are boycotting Bud Light gotta be kidding me I would have never thought a Christian would have even wanted anything to do with but light or Bud heavy or Bud anything else I've been hearing some of this and you say you've got to be kidding me so this is now conservative Christianity this is conservative Christianity that you're going to boycott Bud Light so yeah you're going to drink another beer and get drunk and say roaring of God and that's conservative can't you see friend well the world is going heading straight for tribulation oh you say we're the same as they are we are not we are called out from that trash and nonsense of the world oh Hallelujah God said come out of her my people and be you a holy separate people saith the Lord oh wow if you are a Christian you're going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something you put on for you will do his will I love this part when no one but God sees you praise the Lord that means when you're alone with your cell phone I preach mother Donnie well your Holy Ghost shouldn't be your wife your Holy Ghost shouldn't be your young ones come in and then you change websites come on but you know God's there David said I keep him always before me that's why people do wrong because somehow they think God ain't there at that moment when they're setting wherever they are and they go somewhere on some website that ain't fit for a home to look at and they're sitting there looking at it come on Prairie children and yet they don't cannot how can they believe that almighty God is right there in that room watching everything they're doing if you do you'll walk a different walk you'll talk a different talk you'll live right you'll walk right you'll stay cry and when the Rapture gets ready to take place you'll take your flightless what is right hey oh my you will do his will when no one but God sees you listen to this and you will do his will even if it costs you your life praise the Lord can it go on thank you let's look at eternal life for a few minutes how many at least you have it eternal life already listen to this a person who lives their life for their self lives a selfish life we must live for others bear you one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ and we've got to have a feeling for one another and therefore when you've done all you know how to do them when you do lay down at night well you have the consolation knowing that you tried your best I want you to notice the words that he chooses here a person who lives their life for their self so they live their life for themselves they live a selfish life but burying one another's burdens so what is the law that is breaking into the law of God the law of Christ so we must not just do things for others but actually live for others now think about it process it not just do good things on the occasion that actually living for others notice again he says so each day I want to live life not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure testing one two testing y'all hear me yeah wow I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself unto my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God now don't raise your hand but how many of you are honestly do this daily weekly monthly yearly on leap year you say friends this separates bride from church it's amazing how much we do for us with us in mind and about how much of us we think about and how much we say about us I find it amazing you know you can I'm on several ministers chats and if a certain brother from a certain Church well say I want to share a miracle that the Lord did the Lord did such and such and so and so on our church on Sunday some of the brothers come on Earth praise the Lord that's wonderful but if that same thing happens at their Church they go on and on and on and on about how great it was and the very same thing happened at another man's church and they say praise the Lord I personally have a problem with that you know why because they're not given the right glory to God it's greater if it's in their Ministry and their church and their Pastor let me ask you something how can it be any greater where a dead person is raised from the dead here or raised from the dead in Guatemala are raising the dead and brother Doug Baker's church in Tucson which happened there as well should not we give the same glory to God since he's the only one who can raise the Dead I just don't understand what is it selfishness selfishness it's always greater when it's at my church it's greater because my pastor prayed the prayer face I honestly don't care which one of you praise the prayer if one of your brothers prays the prayer faith for Eric and she's healed one of your sisters one of you mothers I couldn't care less it don't have to be my prayer it don't have to be the wife my wife's prayer I don't care if one of you is able to touch God for sister Joy Green tonight for sister Jill flaming I don't have to say well glory to God I went down on my knees and I went before the Lord and I'll call Sister Jill fleeman's name and glory to God wouldn't you know it the Lord heard my prayer as always and he always comes on the scene for me you big bag of wind [Applause] you can't heal cancer man can't raise the dead only Jesus Christ can heal cancer only Jesus Christ concept the captive free so we need to give all the glory and all the praise not to a preacher not to a church but to Jesus Christ You're Gonna Keep On sir you're gonna get me fired now there's some more brother random goes with this and that day on Calvary Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life if you mothers and fathers husbands and wives would start living more like this a lot of the arguments in your homes a lot of the divisions would totally dissolve a lot of problems in your family other problems in our church a lot of the problems in the churches around the world would totally dissolve because we quit well not me and my my kid my child my this side the other my my that's the problem my my my Me Mine All Me when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life I'm sorry friends I just have an issue with folks that don't believe you need to go to church you know why they cannot fulfill that quote they lived their life to their self you know why because it's hard having friendships let's just face facts sometimes it'd be easier if each one of us had our own private planet especially when you get tired of people you just say I'm buzzing off to wherever it is where you go I'm telling you I don't want you showing up in my Buzz Light here get away from me you ain't tracking mine in Carol's spaceship we're out of here we're gone it'd be much easier why friendships require work friendships can be difficult and people say oh it ain't worth it know if you're a stubborn Hellbound goat it ain't that if you're a sheep that wants to fulfill God's word and you know I've got a responsibility to go to the house of God I've got to look out for my brothers I've got to look out for my sister and they need to look out after me I need them and they need me foreign looking forward to the special meeting since you all and let me tell you one thing that's going to make them so special preaching like this that leads us up to it don't you get in your mind Tim Pruitt Ron Spencer or David Siler is bringing a special anointing with them that they're bringing a special sermon all of a sudden that's going to turn our church upside down if there ain't nothing for them to preach to if there are any people that believe the word and if there ain't a people that are taught the word of God it won't do them a whole lot of good to come but if we can hide the people that'll say Amen a people that'll say preach it brother tend to hide off of me cause I want to do right we're going to have a meeting that's going to be absolutely awesome absolutely overwhelming because God knows we need it let me close to this when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he come and the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names you don't live for yourself now what a strange thing how what a scenario to put that in so how can you let people call you such bad names and this is his answer you don't live for yourself so then what do you do when people call you badge names and then you go back on Facebook and call them names you're living for yourself thank you you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man that you might redeem that bad you become sons in the trouble but if the churches for God they were sons who aren't Sons you take in Christ's place you are Sons so you don't live for yourself I can live for this brother because he's sure a nice man that's not it listen children live for that man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if they could oh my goodness Lord help us Lord help us that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them facts eternal life when you when that's in your bosom you are facing heaven then not cleansing the leper raising the dead shouting running jumping no don't jump no harm you live if you live high jump to the roof brother we'll catch you when you come down but how do you treat others do you live for others home listen that's eternal life and that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then do you sacrifice your own things you give him up like the sheep gives up its wool you look on towards Calvary notice this as he goes on and he prays god let me be crucified today let me crucify today myself and my ideas that I might live with Christ and live for others no matter what they do to me if they make fun of me and persecute me and say all evil against men things let me just humbly walk along Meek like a lamb like he did oh my God I'm gonna be honest before we pray Lord I want to be like that I want to be like that our knowledge our gifts our healings our miracles our years have been around the message what good but even if that do us if we cannot do this this my brother sister is eternal life it cannot be impersonated a person can say I've received eternal life I went to those I received eternal life but look at the life they live look at the billboard that's on display so when people will do something against them or say something do they get even do they hold grudges it's amazing how many Christians hope grudges just hold grudges oh my goodness but when you stand praying forgive that your father may also forgive your trespasses oh my goodness I mean lots of memories we pray I may Believe by the grace of God you have eternal life how many once had eternal life to live more effectively out of your life that you are not your own self you don't sponsor yourself so you are not the message on your billboard it would make no sense for McDonald's to pay thousands and thousands of dollars for a billboard and then tell the person outdoor Life Resource you go and put on what you have whatever you want to I mean that's what I do when I go through a drowser what do you want just give me what you wanted I went to McDonald's the other day Believe It or Not Us in big rush I thought this is the closest thing I'm going to the hospital I'm gonna grab me something I want some McDonald's order a quarter pound of cheese no onion I got a fish sandwich so what I'm saying that's my philosophy I should have just said Jimmy whatever you want you're going to anyway but the Lord don't say that about us he says I bought you you are mine your message is not yours what you think I'm not interested in I never paid for you so you could project what you think I never paid for you so you could project your opinion and your ideas and blow your own horn I paid for you so you could project me oh my God dear Jesus gonna be another lonely Thursday it's about it Dear God Lord I pray that you'd help each of us tonight if a man woman boy and girl Lord if we say we have eternal life and yet we live our lives for ourselves it's all about us our opinion our ideas Lord God help us to see clearly tonight father we know self deceit is one of the hardest that there is to see Ever we can see others and we can see the devil oh yeah but how we deceive ourselves it can be so difficult we can see other people's faults so easily but looking at our own Lord God may we look tonight through your Vision or father and see eternal life itself must Express itself not us you didn't buy me so I would preach myself as Paul said we preach not ourselves you didn't come preaching yourself Lord Jesus you did just how I go around heal though I want to heal and I do this now another you said I do only what my father shows me you were the spirit's billboard you did that to be an example I just read it yesterday where the Prophet said you could have had wife you could have had a home could have had a family but you said I sanctify myself for their sake no doubt some of these people standing here tonight in Word of Life Church would have really struggled with you being sinless and being their redeemer if they would have known you'd had a wife you could have physically fathered children and they would have not been the literal
