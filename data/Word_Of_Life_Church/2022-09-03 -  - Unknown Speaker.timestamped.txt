[30:36] praise the Lord for that
[30:38] not who I used to be
[30:42] First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11.
[30:52] I'd like to read verses 11 through
[30:54] verses 15.
[30:56] I'm sure that
[30:58] many of you probably heard that there's
[31:00] quite a powerful storm I guess heading
[31:01] up toward Delaware Maryland New York
[31:04] lots of those places and brother Robert
[31:06] Marrero from New York had contacted me
[31:09] earlier this morning certainly request
[31:11] in prayer that the Lord would be mindful
[31:13] of them New York has shut down all the
[31:15] transit system the buses Subways and all
[31:19] that sort of thing so sounds like it
[31:21] might be a terrible terrible thing it'll
[31:23] be hidden for those people so we
[31:24] certainly once remember them today in
[31:26] prayer brother Robert wanted me to tell
[31:28] you that he misses you all so much
[31:32] I certainly appreciate our brother
[31:34] let's read together
[31:36] for what man knoweth the things of a
[31:39] man's safest Spirit of man which is in
[31:42] him
[31:43] even so the things of God
[31:46] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[31:50] spirit of God
[31:52] now we have received not the spirit of
[31:54] the world but the spirit which is of god
[31:58] that we might know the things that are
[32:02] freely given to us of God
[32:05] which things also we speak not in The
[32:08] Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but
[32:10] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[32:13] spiritual things with spiritual
[32:16] but the natural man listen to this now
[32:19] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[32:23] of God
[32:25] now bring at your attention again Paul
[32:26] did not say that the natural man cannot
[32:28] receive things of the word of God
[32:31] but he cannot receive the things of the
[32:33] spirit of God
[32:35] many many theologians are nothing but
[32:37] natural men many people that go to
[32:39] church are just natural people that's
[32:40] all they are and never say many things
[32:42] from the word of God but this is only
[32:44] for those who are Spirit-filled of
[32:46] course the natural man receiveth not the
[32:49] things of the spirit of God for they are
[32:53] foolishness
[32:54] unto him
[32:56] neither can he know them because they
[32:58] are spiritually discerned
[33:02] but he that is spiritual
[33:05] I wonder if I would ask you this morning
[33:06] how many of you could Define for me
[33:10] the biblical definition of being
[33:12] spiritual
[33:14] I wonder how many of you could give it
[33:15] to me
[33:16] as far as really what's spiritual now
[33:18] not your opinion
[33:19] but really what the Bible says is a
[33:22] spiritual person
[33:24] you might be surprised it might be
[33:26] surprised at the real meaning of it
[33:28] actually it means to be governed
[33:31] by the spirit of God
[33:33] but we would tend to thank someone as
[33:35] spiritual someone who shouts a lot is
[33:37] extremely emotional or the Lord told me
[33:39] this well the Lord told me that and the
[33:40] Lord and I'm wondering I'm thinking you
[33:42] know what it's no wonder he don't tell
[33:44] me much because he's spending all his
[33:45] time talking with them
[33:51] [Music]
[33:54] but that's not the identification of a
[33:55] spiritual person
[33:57] a spiritual person is one who is
[33:59] governed by God
[34:00] which means their temper their anger
[34:03] lust
[34:05] all those things God is there to help
[34:07] govern that
[34:09] they may not be one that a lot of people
[34:11] would even identify as being spiritual
[34:13] but they're under control Divine control
[34:17] they may have a furnace inside of them
[34:20] that boy like a temper or it could but
[34:24] they're so controlled by God hardly
[34:27] nobody ever even knows it's there
[34:30] that's a spiritual person
[34:34] grabs all the chandeliers and swings
[34:36] around like a monkey they may not be the
[34:38] ones that hollers the loudest but you
[34:40] know what they're governed by the spirit
[34:42] of God I wonder do we know what
[34:43] spiritual is friends
[34:46] very good until we look at most of your
[34:48] face that this is not what you thought
[34:51] but notice this he that is spiritual
[34:54] judge us
[34:57] all things so a man or woman boy or girl
[34:59] that is governed by the spirit of God
[35:01] they judge all things now I'm not going
[35:03] to you're an apple hear a serpent say
[35:05] you're Brian no no they're judging
[35:07] things around them
[35:08] they're judging conversations or judging
[35:10] where they go what they do how they
[35:12] behave now notice why
[35:15] he that a spiritual judge us all things
[35:17] yet he himself is judged of no man
[35:21] now don't don't let me stumble you just
[35:24] right off the get-go but actually this
[35:27] this discernment is more important in
[35:30] your life
[35:31] than every discernment that you'll ever
[35:34] hear on brother Ben's tapes
[35:39] because all those discernments as
[35:41] wonderful as they were
[35:43] they were
[35:46] but really don't have anything to do
[35:47] with you and I and the way we live now
[35:49] it's wonderful to hear him call people
[35:50] out and tell them their name and how
[35:52] many steps goes up to the porch I'm
[35:53] that's it's overwhelming but that don't
[35:56] make you spiritual or me we rejoice in
[35:59] that a lot of folks in the message you
[36:00] take that away from them I'm not sure
[36:01] what they would do but the spiritual
[36:03] discernment that a real Christian has
[36:06] this is one sign that you are truly a
[36:08] child of God
[36:13] man I laugh
[36:17] let's pray together let's ask God's
[36:19] blessings on the word
[36:21] Heavenly Father we love you today we're
[36:23] so thankful Lord Jesus
[36:25] for your great word
[36:27] I so Marvel Lord when I read it and then
[36:30] all of a sudden you just like click a
[36:32] light on and it just opens up to us
[36:36] we know it's when it transforms from
[36:38] logos to Rima where it's actually made
[36:41] present tense to where we are how we
[36:45] thank you for the historical events that
[36:47] have been written down on the pages of
[36:49] the Bible
[36:50] how we thank you Father for the
[36:52] countless of Miracles and things that
[36:54] you've done down Through the Ages
[36:56] thousands of years we thank you for the
[36:59] tapes that you've been able to allow to
[37:02] be preserved for us we're the only
[37:05] people only people in every Church age
[37:07] that's able to actually hear the voice
[37:10] of their messenger after he was gone
[37:12] from the earth the people in Paul's day
[37:15] once Paul was gone none of the second
[37:17] generation people ever heard that voice
[37:19] Luther Wesley on down and on down but
[37:22] you desire you decided and desired that
[37:25] we would be able to hear the prophet
[37:27] messenger's voice many many years even
[37:30] after he left the Earth and we're
[37:32] thankful for that Lord Jesus but then
[37:35] God we ask today that you would help us
[37:37] that we lord would want and desire to
[37:39] live in a world of reality when your
[37:43] presence is just as real with us today
[37:45] as it was then so speak to us today
[37:48] father in Jesus name amen God bless you
[37:51] you may be seated so enjoyed the service
[37:54] last night didn't you amen appreciate
[37:57] the minister of the word from the
[37:59] brother Daryl and also the communion
[38:00] service and certainly enjoyed it with
[38:02] all of her hearts I'd like to speak to
[38:04] you today on spiritually discerned
[38:07] discernment scares a lot of folks
[38:09] because they're afraid that you're going
[38:11] to try to call somebody out and tell
[38:14] them what their name is or something
[38:15] like that but we know that there's only
[38:17] one of those actually given to a
[38:20] generation but yet spiritual discernment
[38:23] actually belongs to every Holy Ghost
[38:25] Field child of God it doesn't mean that
[38:28] you'll go out and oh you know I feel
[38:30] something uh that's close to a witch to
[38:33] me that's a medium or somebody like that
[38:34] but really discernment is something that
[38:37] leads Our Lives something that guides us
[38:40] something that keeps us from trouble I
[38:42] believe that if we would be more
[38:43] sensitive to the discerner that lives in
[38:46] our hearts it would save us a lot of
[38:49] difficulty that we go through
[38:50] unnecessarily and simply because we try
[38:53] to use our own reasoning or our own
[38:55] understanding and we try to live a
[38:57] Christian Life from the psychological
[39:00] effect instead of the pneumatic effect
[39:03] which is the spirit given life and we we
[39:06] tend to lean more to toward the
[39:08] intelligence or the mind or the spirit
[39:11] realm as we looked at it last week by
[39:13] which we think of things and we look at
[39:15] things and we psychologically deduct
[39:18] those things and we put them together
[39:19] and we'll put a row over here and a row
[39:22] over there and a row over here and then
[39:23] we try to psychologically look at that
[39:25] and think well what would be the best
[39:27] and how should I do this and that and
[39:29] you realize if Abraham would have done
[39:31] that he'd never believe God
[39:34] Isaac Jacob all the rest of them never
[39:36] believe God if they would have put
[39:37] everything all the pros and the cons on
[39:39] the psychological lists they would have
[39:41] never believed God the way they did so
[39:43] Faith many times will call us beyond the
[39:46] sense of our own reasoning of our own
[39:48] intellect and yet there is a realm by
[39:50] which God of course uses the psyche the
[39:53] the intellectual part and we know that
[39:56] that God designed the human being thus
[39:58] so it would have that as long as we're
[40:00] Immortal we need it and even in our
[40:02] spirit is the realm of contact by which
[40:05] the spirit of God in brother Branham
[40:07] Discerning people's lives and I realize
[40:09] that many people today are trying to
[40:11] change the gifts that brother Branham
[40:13] had and saying that it was not actually
[40:15] a prophetic gift of discernment but it
[40:18] was simply a word of knowledge uh that
[40:21] way they they take away the prophetic
[40:24] office from Brother Branham and say
[40:25] really brother Branham wasn't a prophet
[40:27] he was just displaying the word of
[40:30] knowledge or the word of wisdom but I
[40:33] would like to find the definition of
[40:35] that word of knowledge or That Word of
[40:37] Wisdom in the scripture in the way they
[40:40] identified you'll not find the New
[40:43] Testament word of knowledge or Word of
[40:45] Wisdom being identified as a prophetic
[40:48] gift you find it from the Old Testament
[40:50] down through the new a prophetic gift
[40:52] was totally different than a word of
[40:54] knowledge or a Word of Wisdom a word of
[40:58] knowledge or a word of wisdom is exactly
[41:00] what it says it is a word of knowledge
[41:03] or a Word of Wisdom it is not a vision
[41:06] by which you see your life as a child 20
[41:09] years old 30 years old that is not a
[41:12] word of knowledge that is
[41:13] anti-scriptural
[41:15] it takes a prophet of God to be able to
[41:18] break into that realm that is not a gift
[41:20] of knowledge it is not a gift of wisdom
[41:22] it is a prophetic gift now in that none
[41:26] of us here none of us here will ever
[41:28] have that I myself don't even want that
[41:30] that's given to a prophet and a
[41:32] generation one in a generation now do we
[41:35] have discernment truly I believe every
[41:37] holy ghost filled child of God does and
[41:39] God deals with me and discernment he
[41:41] should deal with you and discernment but
[41:43] yet I'm not I'm not supposed to stand up
[41:45] here and say somebody here today has got
[41:47] a back trouble oh Lord they would be all
[41:49] kinds of people I'm sure uh somebody's
[41:52] got a burden I feel a pain well is that
[41:54] mine or yours could be either or you
[41:56] know somebody here said today's got all
[41:59] kinds of oh there's somebody out in the
[42:01] southwest and I get sick of my stomach
[42:03] whenever you see all that stuff and it's
[42:05] absolutely impersonation is all that it
[42:07] is
[42:08] but yet the discernment that we really
[42:10] need in our life is not that you know
[42:13] brother I feel something oh I I feel
[42:15] like you're fixing to go through
[42:17] something I ain't got time for all that
[42:18] trash the discernment I need is
[42:20] something to help me to live a better
[42:22] Christian Life
[42:24] that will endow me with the ability to
[42:27] discern to examine to investigate to
[42:30] look at right and wrong and to be able
[42:32] to look at something from an inside life
[42:34] that Satan is laying a snare for me or
[42:36] trap and you know that a snare or a trap
[42:39] must be laid if you're going to lay it
[42:42] for an animal if you're going to laugh
[42:43] or whatever that it is a rabbit or a
[42:45] or some type of African animal you
[42:48] want to lay that snare or that trap in
[42:51] such a way you want to pick a setting by
[42:53] which that animal is very comfortable in
[42:55] a snare many times as a string or a wire
[42:58] or a rope and much illegal in the United
[43:00] States in many places but yet overseas
[43:02] still legal so they will go in and they
[43:04] will put a snare in a certain spot where
[43:06] they are this animal is familiar with
[43:08] under a feeding tree or an area by which
[43:11] the animal will feed and then they do
[43:13] not put a sign up this is a snare I am
[43:17] looking for an anteater this is a snare
[43:19] and red lights are everywhere
[43:22] this is a snake air
[43:25] that's not the way the devil lays them
[43:27] for you either
[43:28] but they'll put a wire in there or a
[43:31] strong rope and they will put it in and
[43:33] cover it over with leaves and they want
[43:35] to put everything around whether it
[43:37] looks like knows him and has been there
[43:38] where there's no natural disturbance to
[43:41] the foliage or to the botany life that's
[43:43] around it and that animal will come in
[43:45] just unsuspicious totally unanoi of
[43:48] what's going on and all of a sudden he
[43:49] steps in there and he's caught in the
[43:51] snare and you know the same way with
[43:53] with us as Mortals that the devil wants
[43:56] to lay snares in front of us and he
[43:58] wants to camouflage it with natural
[44:00] things of life or things that we're
[44:02] accustomed with or comfortable with
[44:05] he'll never put up a flashing light
[44:07] he'll never put up something to alarm
[44:09] you he'll never put up something to
[44:11] scare you away from that snare but he'll
[44:13] always hide it in a natural comfortable
[44:16] surrounding that you feel very
[44:18] comfortable with then you move in you're
[44:20] moving closer and closer to whatever it
[44:22] is and the next thing you know you're
[44:24] hung upside down with your leg and there
[44:26] you're hung now what is that that is a
[44:28] snare there but what if we had the
[44:31] ability by the spirit of God that
[44:33] something was given to us and we would
[44:35] look at our natural eye and seem like
[44:37] nothing is moved nothing is out of place
[44:40] every leaf is exactly right in our life
[44:43] every saint oh my our life is in such
[44:45] Harmony it's never been better but all
[44:48] of a sudden we feel from within us a
[44:51] warning a buzzer a red light whatever
[44:54] you want to call it and you just feel
[44:56] something have you ever been there
[44:58] well you just feel something is just not
[45:01] right now you think what is that well
[45:03] it's not your spirit per se because
[45:05] you're spiritless imagination love
[45:07] conscious memory reason so there's no
[45:10] reason for it to tap into any of those
[45:12] aspects to give you a warning it's not
[45:15] your body because cities feel smelling
[45:17] here you're looking around and you
[45:19] respond I don't see anything I don't see
[45:21] anything any different but it would be
[45:23] something by which you would be
[45:25] classified in God's eyes as being
[45:27] spiritual or governed by the spirit and
[45:30] all of a sudden everything seems normal
[45:32] it seems natural and something from
[45:34] within you a Bowser goes off and you
[45:37] feel the strange peculiar warning and
[45:39] you begin to step back then what do you
[45:41] do nature from the from the soul then
[45:44] the spirit becomes alarmed and then the
[45:46] spirit will become on high alert and
[45:49] what does it do then it sends out the
[45:50] frequency or the message to the body to
[45:53] the Flesh and then the eyes go to
[45:55] looking around and the ears become more
[45:57] acute and more sensitive and you're
[45:59] listening and you're watching and why
[46:01] because from the inside to the inside to
[46:04] the outside you have now been worn and
[46:07] you have been given something by the
[46:10] spirit of God that helps you to discern
[46:12] there's something about this situation
[46:14] that just ain't right
[46:16] now I'm convinced friends that many of
[46:18] the things that you and I go through the
[46:21] spirit of God is there and he's always
[46:23] so close and he's always so sensitive to
[46:26] warn us and I can recall many many
[46:28] things in my life when I've made
[46:30] mistakes or got in trouble and it's when
[46:31] I simply overrode that little feeling if
[46:34] you want to call it that way or that
[46:36] little still Small Voice how many can
[46:38] relate to what I'm saying that little
[46:39] something that you just overrode it and
[46:42] yet you went on anyway now it was
[46:44] something it was a snare laid before you
[46:46] maybe it's a boy just going with her a
[46:48] girl or whatever mourn you felt a funny
[46:50] feeling even before you committed to
[46:53] become engaged or married to that
[46:54] individual you felt really really
[46:56] strange and then when you do and your
[46:58] marriage winds up and shambles then you
[47:00] want to blame God don't blame my daddy
[47:02] for stuff you don't do don't listen to
[47:04] yourself I do not believe God will lead
[47:07] a daughter or a son and to a horrible
[47:10] terrible marriage and not warn them
[47:12] he'll warn them from the pulpit he'll
[47:15] warn them as they listen to a tape he'll
[47:16] to warn them in that little still Small
[47:18] Voice in their heart but many girls and
[47:21] boys as well they want to leave home
[47:23] they want to get out on their own and
[47:25] they override that don't get quiet on me
[47:27] already they override that something
[47:29] instead of following the spirit of God
[47:31] so don't blame God for you'll mess up
[47:34] [Applause]
[47:36] but the natural man that does not have
[47:39] this ability now I'm not saying that of
[47:40] course natural unconverted people are
[47:42] not accessible to the spirit realm
[47:45] because they are because they have a
[47:47] Pneumatic or a numerous area of their
[47:49] life which is the spirit realm but yet
[47:51] they are not governed by that realm
[47:54] there is a great difference and being a
[47:56] spiritual being and being governed from
[47:59] the soul by the spirit of God every
[48:01] human being has a spirit so therefore
[48:03] they are able to be able to be contacted
[48:05] by Angels by the spirit of God or by
[48:08] demons or by Satan that makes us
[48:10] Immortal of course but that does not
[48:12] mean that they are governed from their
[48:14] soul now every sinner is not demon
[48:17] possessed listen to me carefully every
[48:19] sinner is not demon possessed they are
[48:22] unconverted they're not born again but
[48:24] it doesn't mean that every sinner has a
[48:27] devil that inhabits their soul and
[48:30] governs their soul now they're
[48:32] unconverted so that makes them Satan's
[48:34] property but there are some people who
[48:36] were actually demon possessed but not
[48:39] every sinner is there are some
[48:41] Christians that are not Holy Ghost
[48:43] possessed
[48:45] they are Christians and they love the
[48:48] Lord and they have been saved but
[48:50] they're not possessed and governed by
[48:53] the Holy Ghost you understand now are
[48:55] they Christians they are because they
[48:57] have accepted uh you know as far as they
[48:59] know all the things that they know many
[49:01] of them have accepted and they have
[49:03] applied are they saved are they
[49:05] Christians yes I would say they are all
[49:07] the Holy Ghost still are they truly born
[49:09] again no not unless they are governed
[49:11] from the soul by the Holy Ghost now will
[49:14] they will they be more prone then to
[49:17] making more natural mistakes because
[49:19] they follow the newness of their their
[49:21] Realms sure they will but the Holy Ghost
[49:24] Field that once they are governed by
[49:26] that and they learn they are governed by
[49:28] it and they learn that that Holy Ghost
[49:31] does not want them to spend most of
[49:33] their life repenting for wrongdoing
[49:35] maybe I'll look at it all together wrong
[49:37] but to me it's a greater Victory if the
[49:39] Lord can avoid me of going into that
[49:42] snare than it is for me to walk into
[49:44] that snare and why while I'm hanging
[49:46] upside down by my leg I say Lord I'm
[49:49] sorry I'm hanging upside down by my leg
[49:51] will you forgive me and would you send
[49:53] the preacher to cut me down out of this
[49:55] tree
[49:57] now maybe you think that brings honor
[49:59] and glory to God but to me I would
[50:01] rather rather be able to walk around
[50:03] that snare and get on the other side and
[50:06] make fun of the devil that's what I'd
[50:07] rather do I mean I've been upside down
[50:10] enough hanging by my leg you understand
[50:11] what I'm talking about I've been called
[50:13] in many snares but to me I'd rather walk
[50:16] around them snares than be caught in
[50:18] them snares
[50:20] now there's only one way that we can do
[50:22] that and that is to be led by the spirit
[50:23] of God I want you to notice that Paul in
[50:25] verse 14 he says but the natural man
[50:27] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[50:29] of God now the word natural goes into
[50:32] the spiritual part as well but watch how
[50:34] he says that it's such a which is
[50:36] sensual or belonging to breasts now this
[50:40] is the natural man that belongs to
[50:42] breath the principle of animal life
[50:45] which men have in common with brutes
[50:49] no wonder brother man said you'd take
[50:51] the Holy Ghost off of a man who's lower
[50:52] than an animal
[50:54] in common with Bruce the sensuous nature
[50:57] with its subjection to appetite and
[51:00] passion the animal man now the word
[51:03] natural also denotes of course the
[51:05] opposite of spiritual notice how he says
[51:08] this but the natural man receiveth not
[51:10] the things of the spirit of God for they
[51:12] are foolishness unto him so the natural
[51:14] man is opposite to the spiritual myth so
[51:18] the natural man is something that we're
[51:20] all born into this sensual natural
[51:23] nature that we're born into by the first
[51:25] birth and we do not have the ability to
[51:28] understand the things of the spirit of
[51:30] God yet God breaks the gospel down in
[51:33] such a simple way that the natural
[51:35] unconverted man can at least understand
[51:38] the introduction into the gospel now the
[51:43] gospel is like the doorway that we're
[51:45] outside the doorway of God we're outside
[51:47] the doorway of eternal light and yet
[51:49] there's no way for us to understand it
[51:51] it's mysterious it holds many things on
[51:53] the inside yet God will introduce the
[51:56] gospel as if it were these two doors
[51:57] right here that God but let the gospel
[52:00] be preached and a sinner setting there
[52:01] that does not have the ability to
[52:04] understand the Deep things of God
[52:05] because you've got to be part of family
[52:07] to do that but yet God would have the
[52:10] gospel introduced in Simplicity in such
[52:12] a way that a sinner a person that cannot
[52:14] understand great things they would be
[52:16] able to hear it and peer into the door
[52:18] and say oh my I need to change my life I
[52:21] need to be a better person I need to be
[52:23] one what the this this gospel now it's
[52:25] not about the great introduction of the
[52:27] great deep things of God it's helping
[52:29] them see there is a better way it's
[52:32] helping them see that they need to
[52:35] change their life but they're still not
[52:37] capable of understanding the things of
[52:39] God yet
[52:41] now many come through that door and they
[52:43] enter into the doors to the knowledge of
[52:45] the gospel and they accept the gospel
[52:47] they go on many of it to accept the
[52:49] message of the hour and then they want
[52:51] to go on and on and on with God and yet
[52:54] they never go any farther into the
[52:56] spirit realm to where the Holy Ghost
[52:58] governs them that every day of their
[53:00] life I don't know about you I don't want
[53:01] to just be on Sunday morning I don't
[53:03] want to have a Sunday Holy Ghost I want
[53:05] to have a Monday Holy Ghost and a
[53:07] Tuesday holy ghost man I need the Holy
[53:09] Ghost every hour of the day I want him
[53:11] to help me avoid situations and help me
[53:13] to leave me and guide me so that I can
[53:16] actually be governed that I can be a
[53:18] spiritually discerned Christian that I
[53:21] can walk every day of my life and
[53:23] whenever I'm just walking through lows
[53:24] or whatever more and I feel a peculiar
[53:27] feeling and I think Lord what is it I
[53:29] want to be so sensitive to the spirit of
[53:31] God that he would warn me of something
[53:34] before me if something behind me of
[53:36] whatever you understand what I'm saying
[53:41] actually I want to be a Mystic
[53:50] I'll let you wonder what that means
[53:52] now watch then it denotes those that are
[53:55] governed and influenced by the spirit of
[53:58] God so the natural man cannot be now can
[54:01] the natural man be anointed he can't can
[54:04] the natural man feel the spirit of God I
[54:06] wonder how many thousands of people have
[54:07] come through this church since it's been
[54:09] built years and years ago when it's over
[54:11] on Rolling Hill and came here wherever
[54:13] your foundation was I wonder how many
[54:14] people have come on this Hillside that
[54:17] if such and heard the gospel some of
[54:19] them cried some of them sit on the back
[54:21] down mother grabbed to hold the back of
[54:23] Dimension the spirit of God was moving
[54:24] on them and they wouldn't give how many
[54:26] people have say or thousands of them
[54:27] have come through these doors there's
[54:29] been literally hundreds that have come
[54:31] to these doors since I've been here as a
[54:33] pastor how many of them have felt the
[54:35] spirit of God since the spirit of God
[54:37] and knew there was something about it
[54:39] yet they never submitted to it can the
[54:42] natural man sense that he can but he
[54:45] cannot comprehend and understand the
[54:48] Deep heart secrets of God to him it
[54:51] doesn't make sense he looks at it he
[54:54] said I don't understand why do you have
[54:56] to do that and why can't you do this how
[54:57] come you have to address that what is it
[54:59] it's the natural man trying to
[55:01] understand the heart of God
[55:03] and Paul says one man can know another
[55:06] man unless it's the spirit in that man
[55:08] so he says the Holy Ghost is the same
[55:11] way
[55:12] now notice he says notice in this the
[55:15] natural man receiveth not the things of
[55:16] the spirit of God for they are
[55:18] foolishness absolute foolishness to the
[55:21] Natural man he cannot comprehend them he
[55:24] does not understand them he has no
[55:26] ability to comprehend they are
[55:29] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[55:32] them because they are spiritually
[55:35] discerned now notice discernment
[55:39] right so the natural man cannot discern
[55:43] but the natural man will try to reason
[55:45] and figure out and read and compare this
[55:48] to this and this to this so if you
[55:50] search and say the message he'll go to
[55:52] this website and that one and that one
[55:53] and that one and when he gets all done
[55:55] he mixes it all up together he's more
[55:56] confused than it was before
[55:58] why because it is the natural man that's
[56:01] why folks can't discern where we are
[56:03] posts don't know what's right and wrong
[56:04] no more come on children folks don't
[56:06] know what church they should go to they
[56:08] don't not even sure if they should go to
[56:10] church why because they don't have
[56:12] spiritual discernment they do not have
[56:15] the ability and they're trying to
[56:17] discern by listening to tapes or trying
[56:21] to discern by going to church you can
[56:23] only discern when the discerner lives in
[56:26] you
[56:30] all right now watch this Paul says
[56:33] neither can he knows them
[56:35] because they are spiritually discerned
[56:38] now look at this word it's it's used
[56:40] several times in spirit and spiritual
[56:42] and spiritually but it comes from the
[56:45] same group word Greek word rather and
[56:47] here it's pneumaticus which is spiritual
[56:50] by the aid of the Holy Ghost
[56:54] now there are certain things that the
[56:56] written word the logos declares for us
[56:58] to do and not do and there's other
[57:01] things it does not say there are things
[57:04] that the tapes were able to go and say
[57:06] well what brother say about this and
[57:07] this and this and this but there are
[57:09] certain things God did not have him to
[57:11] say face it every aspect of your life is
[57:14] not on the tapes every aspect of your
[57:16] life is not necessarily written in this
[57:18] Bible those going to be things you're
[57:20] going to face things you're going to go
[57:21] through things that you're going to face
[57:23] in life that you're not going to be able
[57:24] to find a quote nor a scripture hold on
[57:27] the Spirit Led don't even need it
[57:31] you don't have to have a quote and a
[57:33] scripture for everything you do because
[57:35] the pneumaticus of God will lead you if
[57:39] you will allow him now God gives us a
[57:42] principle understanding and lays it out
[57:43] in the logos why do you say why would he
[57:45] do that he wanted to do it that way he
[57:48] wanted this walk to be intimate he
[57:50] wanted it to be personal he didn't want
[57:53] it to be cold and formal he could have
[57:55] handed you a book of your life and
[57:57] tomorrow tomorrow you're going to the
[57:59] dentist and do this and the next day do
[58:01] that and the next day and you could have
[58:02] just said in okay this week what am I
[58:04] supposed to do all right there's going
[58:05] to be a trap and okay I'll memorize this
[58:07] and that way I'll do this and if you
[58:09] would be a robot you'd be like software
[58:12] to be programmed in you and then you'd
[58:14] oh God I love you oh God I love you I'm
[58:17] going to church I'm going to read the
[58:18] Bible now God don't want you to be a
[58:20] robot he don't want to marry a robot he
[58:23] wants to marry a person he could have
[58:25] handed you your entire life and said
[58:27] watch this and that but instead he gave
[58:29] you that which was necessary and
[58:30] essential know in the form of logos then
[58:33] out of that he would Quicken it would
[58:34] become Rhema other things you couldn't
[58:36] find it not even written at all
[58:38] because he reserved that
[58:40] especially for those intimate times
[58:43] between you and him
[58:47] let me tell your business brother
[58:49] something I ain't no businessman okay
[58:51] but I believe your business Brothers
[58:53] could have avoided a lot of your
[58:54] pitfalls in your business
[58:56] if you'd be led to the spirit of God
[58:58] instead of LED by the market
[59:03] because remember who controls all this
[59:05] money and all these markets out here he
[59:07] does he'll get you spending and making
[59:09] all kinds of things and then when he
[59:10] gets you out oh my what's he do he drops
[59:13] the bottom and there you're hung you
[59:15] know how many of your brothers got there
[59:16] because she was not LED of the spirit of
[59:18] God she was led by greed
[59:20] oh Jesus
[59:21] [Music]
[59:23] there ain't no way the spirit of God but
[59:25] led some of you all into the financial
[59:27] mess you're in if you'd have waited on
[59:29] him
[59:30] come on that's your son get caught I'm
[59:32] trying my best to help you today
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:40] I'm talking about the Holy Ghost
[59:42] remember this all this out here is owned
[59:45] by the Devil he's the one who motivates
[59:48] this and that and the other all politics
[59:50] all government all the money the whole
[59:52] thing is controlled by him and we've got
[59:55] to live in this world for sure but the
[59:57] Holy Ghost can maneuver you around the
[59:59] Trap Of The Devil business Brothers if
[1:00:01] you'll pray and say Lord help me to make
[1:00:03] business decisions that are best for my
[1:00:06] company and best for you and best for my
[1:00:08] family and for the kingdom of God
[1:00:13] foreign
[1:00:15] is we become so confident in our own
[1:00:18] abilities
[1:00:20] I don't need to pray about trading cars
[1:00:22] I don't need to pray about this and that
[1:00:24] and the other
[1:00:26] well you better
[1:00:29] he'll help you I got my eye years and
[1:00:32] years ago I never could not afford a new
[1:00:34] car
[1:00:34] but years ago I got to a place where
[1:00:36] payments was all pretty good and I was
[1:00:38] able to buy one
[1:00:40] so I went out I just picked out what I
[1:00:42] wanted
[1:00:44] I thought man I'll just buy whatever I
[1:00:47] want living down in Kentucky at the time
[1:00:49] I didn't pray about it
[1:00:51] let's just waiting a lot of y'all live
[1:00:53] your life anyway so you can relate to
[1:00:54] that perfectly
[1:00:56] the Lord was fixing to teach me quite a
[1:00:58] lesson
[1:01:00] now I knew you could get lemons and used
[1:01:02] cars
[1:01:03] because I'd sucked a lot of lemonade out
[1:01:05] of them
[1:01:07] but I didn't quite realize you could get
[1:01:09] a lemon in a brand new one
[1:01:12] so I bought this pretty van for us to
[1:01:14] travel in you know traveling to back in
[1:01:16] Pentecost and going up and down the road
[1:01:17] to man it was so pretty and it was sharp
[1:01:19] and it was nice and it was comfortable
[1:01:21] and it was a lemon
[1:01:23] now I'm telling you what we didn't have
[1:01:25] it but a week and this went wrong and
[1:01:27] that went wrong and another went wrong
[1:01:29] and something else went wrong and I'll
[1:01:31] tell you one thing every time I made a
[1:01:33] trip to Somerset to have to repair it I
[1:01:35] was repenting the whole way up and the
[1:01:36] whole way back because the Lord was
[1:01:39] teaching this little boy I better pray
[1:01:41] about trading cars
[1:01:43] now I know some of you sat there and you
[1:01:45] say he is so simple I am but I'm
[1:01:47] spirit-led
[1:01:49] so which would you rather be it's up to
[1:01:51] you you make your choice but you see the
[1:01:54] spirit of God if I would have been
[1:01:55] sensitive and pray they must have their
[1:01:58] van sitting on that lot but I had my
[1:02:01] mind made up I I wanted that pretty
[1:02:04] burgundy one with all them stripes on it
[1:02:07] and the Lord said go ahead stripes for
[1:02:10] stripes
[1:02:16] I guarantee you one thing I've never got
[1:02:19] another vehicle after that one without
[1:02:22] praying about it I don't care if it's a
[1:02:25] Cadillac if it's a Mercedes or a BMW
[1:02:27] whatever you're gonna get you better say
[1:02:30] Lord Jesus help me help me Lord I need
[1:02:33] your help some of y'all look at them
[1:02:35] helpful strains and then you wonder why
[1:02:37] you're not closer to God because we keep
[1:02:40] him out of so many Avenues of our life
[1:02:43] some of you sisters don't think you need
[1:02:45] him to help you in your house house jobs
[1:02:48] you do sisters you need him to help you
[1:02:51] to be the right kind of mother and the
[1:02:53] right kind of wife and the right kind of
[1:02:55] cook and all of that
[1:03:01] but the natural man
[1:03:05] I know how to serve God I don't know how
[1:03:07] to be a wife I know how to be and
[1:03:09] remember every one of those avenues that
[1:03:11] you exclude him
[1:03:13] I don't need a man to help me cook I'm
[1:03:15] not a cook I don't know how to do I know
[1:03:16] another one another one another one
[1:03:19] another one another one
[1:03:21] so what is it really last that you can't
[1:03:23] do
[1:03:27] you can't change your body or somebody
[1:03:28] be working on that
[1:03:31] three
[1:03:32] is that something you need him for
[1:03:38] well y'all was shouting last night
[1:03:40] pounding today
[1:03:42] always the difference in an evangelist
[1:03:44] and a pastor aren't you
[1:03:49] now watch
[1:03:53] God because they are foolish
[1:03:56] you see why some of y'all are thinking
[1:03:58] like what I'm talking about today
[1:04:00] because you think I'm foolish
[1:04:02] you think the things I'm saying are
[1:04:04] foolish
[1:04:06] now you know what part of you that is
[1:04:08] the natural sensual animal breast life
[1:04:14] now many of y'all know I do woodworking
[1:04:16] stuff and just piddle really build this
[1:04:18] and that and the other but there's times
[1:04:19] I cannot figure out
[1:04:21] how to make something work
[1:04:24] I don't get online to a how-to list
[1:04:26] woodworking for dummies I don't go here
[1:04:29] and go there and try to figure out I
[1:04:31] think God please help me help me to help
[1:04:34] me to figure this out you say you ask
[1:04:37] him about stuff like that who do you
[1:04:39] think made this world
[1:04:41] and again
[1:04:43] he knows all about mathematics he knows
[1:04:45] all about equations and measurements
[1:04:48] but don't you ever do that you brothers
[1:04:50] ever do that when you're trying to
[1:04:51] figure out a plan legal you can't figure
[1:04:53] out how you say Lord please help me help
[1:04:55] me to figure this out yo that's crazy
[1:04:56] it's not crazy he wants to be there
[1:04:59] every Avenue of Our Lives if we'll ask
[1:05:01] him
[1:05:07] I'll come from downstairs and go
[1:05:08] upstairs and tell Carol I figured it out
[1:05:11] she said did you suggested I asked the
[1:05:13] Lord and he helped me
[1:05:15] all right
[1:05:16] that one tells him yolks y'all got that
[1:05:18] smirk on your face
[1:05:26] when you're online you're trying to
[1:05:27] figure out things in the library you
[1:05:29] can't do it or should I call brother
[1:05:30] Donnie don't call me I ain't no office
[1:05:33] expert

[1:05:37] to figure out oh God how do I do this in
[1:05:39] the home how do I create this out Mr
[1:05:41] Lord help me today how do I do it Lord
[1:05:43] let me get a Better Homes and Garden
[1:05:45] Magazine no they won't tell you it's
[1:05:47] wrote by foolish people read by a lot of
[1:05:49] foolish people put together by foolish
[1:05:51] people put together amen by the people
[1:05:54] that don't even believe in God here's
[1:05:56] the book that makes Better Homes friends
[1:06:06] they are foolishness
[1:06:08] unto him neither can he know them
[1:06:12] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:06:16] I love this word discerned
[1:06:18] examine
[1:06:20] judge
[1:06:22] to investigate
[1:06:26] examine inquire into
[1:06:30] scrutinize
[1:06:32] sift
[1:06:33] question
[1:06:35] determine the Excellence or defects
[1:06:39] of any person
[1:06:42] or thing
[1:06:47] so you're looking at broadening your
[1:06:49] business or business adventure
[1:06:52] the nature you may talk to a banker you
[1:06:54] may talk to you know different Financial
[1:06:56] people
[1:06:57] and they may say man it's a good time I
[1:06:59] do this and that and the other but your
[1:07:00] Holy Ghost feels and you pray about it
[1:07:02] and you pray about it and say I better
[1:07:04] not do it
[1:07:06] something right
[1:07:08] and people say man you better go you
[1:07:10] better man you can make a killing
[1:07:13] you're not gray stripes or red
[1:07:18] but some within your scrutinizes it's
[1:07:22] investigating with them you know oh it's
[1:07:23] got this glass in its hand it's a
[1:07:25] something ain't right it's examining
[1:07:27] school not since I'm really looking and
[1:07:29] say what is the matter with me oh
[1:07:31] everything seems like I should do that
[1:07:33] sensibly you know everything similar but
[1:07:35] some said don't you do it
[1:07:39] and then you back away and a year goes
[1:07:42] by or six months goes by and you look at
[1:07:43] that very thing you would have done and
[1:07:45] it would have absolutely destroyed you
[1:07:47] had you done it
[1:07:49] what was it not your Banker not your
[1:07:51] financial consultants but the discerner
[1:07:54] on the inside
[1:07:55] I know some of you struggle financially
[1:07:57] you say I wish I had more money I wish I
[1:07:59] could
[1:08:00] I could I've accepted the fact a long
[1:08:02] time ago there's some folks that God can
[1:08:05] trust with money and others he can't
[1:08:07] and if God can't trust me with a lot of
[1:08:09] money I'd rather be poor every day of my
[1:08:11] life amen that have all kinds of money
[1:08:14] and it hindered me a lot I don't mean
[1:08:15] I'm less of a Christian than the man can
[1:08:17] handle money some folks can't handle
[1:08:19] money some folks can't handle lots of
[1:08:21] other things but I want God to give to
[1:08:24] me do you I want God to give to me and
[1:08:27] then trust me with what he knows I'm
[1:08:30] capable of doing I don't want my father
[1:08:32] to grant me something that I would
[1:08:34] foolishly ask if it would annihilate me
[1:08:37] or destroy me
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:42] yeah
[1:08:43] so the natural man does not have this
[1:08:46] ability to spiritually discern
[1:08:50] so he looks at others around him this
[1:08:52] guy's prospering this this all this is
[1:08:54] what's the problem with me God don't
[1:08:56] love me God don't
[1:08:57] Wendy discernment
[1:09:04] some folks is going to struggle in money
[1:09:05] some is going to struggle in their
[1:09:07] healths
[1:09:08] some is going to struggle in their mind
[1:09:11] and Satan will always take that person
[1:09:14] that he knows you're having a battle
[1:09:15] with a certain thing and show you them
[1:09:18] look at them look how good they're doing
[1:09:20] they're going through this and that and
[1:09:21] the other but let me tell you something
[1:09:22] friend it's going to come to the
[1:09:24] ultimate true sing of a Son of God is
[1:09:27] that he's judged by no man
[1:09:31] including
[1:09:33] this man
[1:09:41] none of you know my heart
[1:09:44] none of you
[1:09:45] you think you do your mouth I'm not
[1:09:48] saying well I know you I know no we
[1:09:49] don't only me only me I know what's in
[1:09:54] my heart I've been so misjudging you
[1:09:56] have to right
[1:09:57] but yet listen to this neither does this
[1:10:01] know my heart
[1:10:03] and this can be anointed by the devil
[1:10:06] and this will tell me I'm not a
[1:10:09] Christian this will tell me I'm not
[1:10:10] going this will tell me what am I doing
[1:10:13] if I listen to that I am listening to
[1:10:15] the Natural man which cannot discern and
[1:10:18] know the spiritual things of God
[1:10:22] and this natural man will talk me into
[1:10:24] trouble and caught me into making
[1:10:26] mistakes and then this natural man will
[1:10:29] tell me that proves you're not a child
[1:10:31] of God that proves shall not
[1:10:32] predestinate it but if I can ever get to
[1:10:35] the spot and you can get there with me
[1:10:37] then I will refuse to be judged by any
[1:10:40] person in this message I'll refuse to be
[1:10:42] judged by any of you in this message I
[1:10:44] will refuse to be judged even by my own
[1:10:47] flesh for my flesh cannot know what's
[1:10:51] inside of my soul
[1:10:53] how can you speak my destiny when he
[1:10:56] does not know what I am
[1:10:58] hallelujah how can my flesh speak of
[1:11:01] where I'm going when it does not know me
[1:11:06] thank you Jesus
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:15] I take this body to church
[1:11:18] everywhere my soul goes
[1:11:22] it's kind of love or hate relationship
[1:11:26] I need a right foot to press the gas
[1:11:28] pedal to get to church
[1:11:30] I need a right hand to turn the key on
[1:11:32] the right hand to pull the gear shift
[1:11:34] and drive I need a left hand also
[1:11:36] confidence so this body goes with me to
[1:11:39] church
[1:11:40] and yet my body and my spirit and my
[1:11:42] soul we're all three here today
[1:11:44] but there's only one realm that'll
[1:11:47] really receive from the real
[1:11:49] Supernatural realm of God my flesh is
[1:11:51] heard more preaching than most of you
[1:11:53] put together
[1:11:55] right we have some Pentecost I used to
[1:11:57] preach 20 and 25 days in a row
[1:11:59] coach out in Louisiana one not then
[1:12:01] Indiana the next
[1:12:03] fasting 7 10 12 14 days at a time
[1:12:08] right hey
[1:12:11] my slash has heard a lot of preaching it
[1:12:13] don't lock it a bit more today than it
[1:12:15] did and I first got saved
[1:12:17] amen my old body is spending more
[1:12:19] meetings than you can imagine he still
[1:12:21] gets tired of going to church
[1:12:24] born the Holy Ghost moves on me and the
[1:12:26] spirit of God goes to anoint me my soul
[1:12:28] is rejoicing like a little kid this 56
[1:12:31] year old man said
[1:12:34] little Jimmy told me a few weeks ago
[1:12:36] said boy you can't take it like you
[1:12:37] could I said no I sure okay why this
[1:12:39] whole flash gets wore out he is a
[1:12:42] natural man so today the soul that's in
[1:12:46] me the very being of God will hear
[1:12:48] things and catch things that this outer
[1:12:50] man will absolutely know nothing about
[1:12:53] and yet it will come through this outer
[1:12:55] man's ears
[1:13:02] now watch this he says the natural man
[1:13:04] receiveth not
[1:13:06] receiveth not he does not embrace
[1:13:09] cannot comprehend
[1:13:11] cannot understand the beauty of their
[1:13:13] wisdom
[1:13:14] cannot comprehend the depth of the
[1:13:17] mystery does not even understand the
[1:13:19] form the necessity of such things the
[1:13:22] requirement why do it why the natural
[1:13:25] man does not have the ability he's born
[1:13:28] without it
[1:13:30] but the man or woman who's born of the
[1:13:32] Holy Ghost they are born with it
[1:13:34] from within their soul
[1:13:37] so the natural man will argue how can we
[1:13:39] have to do this and how come we can't go
[1:13:40] there how come we got to do this and how
[1:13:41] come how come how come how come and
[1:13:43] those that are born again they're
[1:13:45] they're saying well I don't understand
[1:13:47] it either but if that's what the word
[1:13:48] says I want to do it
[1:13:50] I don't understand why I don't
[1:13:52] understand how to come but I just want
[1:13:53] to do it now the natural man would argue
[1:13:56] he was debate
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:04] because he considers the spiritual
[1:14:06] things of God foolishness
[1:14:10] it's just foolish
[1:14:12] it's foolish to go to church
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:15] it's foolish to hear a picture why would
[1:14:18] you want to hear a preacher when you
[1:14:19] tell me listen to a tape
[1:14:23] what difference does it make up a woman
[1:14:25] wears a dress or pants or a guts her
[1:14:27] hair what difference does that make
[1:14:29] goggles with the heart he does
[1:14:32] and he sees what the outside looks at he
[1:14:34] knows what the heart is
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:38] you say some old Barnes need a new coat
[1:14:40] of paint I I agree Barnes but that's
[1:14:42] showing a very good comparison to your
[1:14:43] face is it
[1:14:46] what if I come up to some of you women
[1:14:48] here at the church who are a little bit
[1:14:49] of pink and a little bit of black a
[1:14:50] little bit of this and that and the
[1:14:51] other and I'll call you Barn do you
[1:14:53] think that's pretty notable
[1:14:55] hello sister Barnes
[1:14:58] oh is that my name Barn it's bad it's
[1:15:00] Reagan it's uh well no I'm just saying
[1:15:01] that's what you look like born
[1:15:06] not Barnes b-a-r-n-e-s but Barn b-a-r-n
[1:15:09] which is where you keep a stinking hog
[1:15:11] stinking cow sinking cars stinking
[1:15:14] chickens all kinds of stinking stuff
[1:15:18] Jesus ain't coming for a barn he's
[1:15:21] coming for a church
[1:15:24] well that's a good Lord thank you
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:15:27] amen here coming for Barnes he's coming
[1:15:30] for temples Tabernacles of the Living
[1:15:32] God but the natural man will reason and
[1:15:36] reason Prince don't don't look down on
[1:15:39] them
[1:15:39] they can't help that
[1:15:42] you try to witness young girls you try
[1:15:44] to witness brothers and sisters and you
[1:15:46] try to help people see it and they'll
[1:15:48] argue and go back and argue don't go
[1:15:50] call them serpent seed they're just
[1:15:53] natural and converted people they don't
[1:15:55] have the ability to receive the things
[1:15:57] of God they think it's foolish
[1:16:02] thank God you don't
[1:16:04] oh my
[1:16:07] god notice the natural man receiveth not
[1:16:09] the things of the spirit of God for they
[1:16:11] are foolishness unto him
[1:16:13] neither can he knows him now we'll use
[1:16:15] this to close out with this last Sunday
[1:16:17] but let's look at it again today neither
[1:16:19] can he know them perceive understand to
[1:16:22] learn to know come to know get a
[1:16:25] knowledge of perceived to become
[1:16:27] acquainted with to know
[1:16:29] to the Greeks this meant to know facts
[1:16:32] but these facts may or may not affect
[1:16:35] one's conduct
[1:16:37] to the Jew
[1:16:39] knowledge always manifested itself in
[1:16:43] one's conduct one did not know something
[1:16:46] until that fact I love this had a
[1:16:50] practical outworking in his life
[1:16:55] friends I'm afraid many of our message
[1:16:57] people this is exactly where they are
[1:17:00] we've got two categories of people in
[1:17:03] this message and they're both found in
[1:17:05] the meaning of this one word
[1:17:09] and who can spit out all kinds of facts
[1:17:11] it may or may not affect the way they
[1:17:13] live look believe behave and so on but
[1:17:17] then there's others
[1:17:18] believing this word it's more than a
[1:17:21] bunch of facts it's changing their life
[1:17:23] and it's not just the outside because
[1:17:26] you can look the part on the outside and
[1:17:28] still be corrupting your soul
[1:17:32] think of how that Paul said now they
[1:17:35] cannot know them the unconverted man
[1:17:37] cannot know them because they are
[1:17:39] spiritually discerned so they are are
[1:17:41] able to pick up now how can the holy
[1:17:43] ghost look at a situation looks
[1:17:45] perfectly normal but the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] looks with a sixth sense and he looks at
[1:17:50] a situation maybe you're just being nice
[1:17:52] to us some lady that you're working with
[1:17:54] but the Holy Ghost senses this could
[1:17:57] lead to something
[1:17:59] you're looking at it all the leaves are
[1:18:01] fine oh it's just you know it's just
[1:18:03] fine we work at the same place no
[1:18:04] problem but the spirit of God says hat
[1:18:07] be careful
[1:18:08] watch that
[1:18:10] how many preachers have been led into
[1:18:12] situations into snares in their own
[1:18:14] church simply because they did not have
[1:18:16] that ability many of them or if they did
[1:18:18] have a little portion of that ability
[1:18:20] they certainly didn't follow it and yet
[1:18:22] they felt into a snare how many churches
[1:18:24] have been bust to Pieces how many homes
[1:18:26] how many families come on children don't
[1:18:28] get quiet how many marriages have been
[1:18:30] bust to Pieces because somebody did not
[1:18:33] follow this little function right here
[1:18:35] of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:36] and yet depended what mama said he was a
[1:18:39] nice boy Uncle so-and-so said he was a
[1:18:41] nice boy let me tell you something girls
[1:18:42] when that boy goes to calling on you and
[1:18:45] go to texting you and whatever more you
[1:18:47] can pretty well figure he's going to be
[1:18:49] on his best behavior
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:54] you don't don't want to marry him on
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] what you want to look for is his normal
[1:18:59] behavior
[1:19:01] which probably isn't the Gallant Romeo
[1:19:04] oh
[1:19:06] you're so beautiful oh your fingers all
[1:19:10] my mama your hair oh you text so
[1:19:15] beautifully
[1:19:19] I just watched the way you do in church
[1:19:21] and ah you better get past that sis and
[1:19:24] find out what it really is like
[1:19:27] come on now don't get quiet
[1:19:29] most you sisters can say Amen to this
[1:19:31] most of those men never carry that over
[1:19:33] after you've been married very long
[1:19:34] anyway
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:37] Lord have mercy what's the matter you
[1:19:40] women
[1:19:42] but you don't want the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:19:46] and say
[1:19:53] something wrong here
[1:19:56] even though your flesh May appeal to it
[1:19:58] your spirit May appeal to your senses
[1:20:00] May appeal to it you see if evil to have
[1:20:02] the Holy Ghost when the serpent come up
[1:20:05] that day in the Garden of Eden
[1:20:07] and he started speaking the word that
[1:20:09] buster would have went off inside her
[1:20:11] because you see the Trap was laid hidden
[1:20:14] deep within the serpent which had a
[1:20:16] place for a soul but didn't have one
[1:20:20] now you see the soul was the hidden part
[1:20:22] so when God made the serpent which was
[1:20:25] an upright creature is not a snake he
[1:20:27] made him to worry that he could reason
[1:20:28] he could think apparently had a spirit
[1:20:29] that was very similar to a human being
[1:20:31] and had a place for a soul but didn't
[1:20:33] have a soul it just so happened Satan
[1:20:36] had a soul so Satan steps inside this
[1:20:40] serpent now this serpent becomes in the
[1:20:43] full image of a man Soul Spirit body
[1:20:48] so from that if she would have had the
[1:20:51] Holy Ghost discernment as soon as he'd
[1:20:53] have walked up man the Bowser would have
[1:20:56] went off inside of her soul but you know
[1:20:58] what the snare was laid so perfectly
[1:21:00] because the body hadn't changed he
[1:21:03] wasn't like a monster he wasn't some
[1:21:04] kind of freaky looking thing but the
[1:21:06] change was where in the SOB of the doubt
[1:21:09] in the song My Lord help us in the soul
[1:21:13] so he walked up looked the same talked
[1:21:15] the same
[1:21:16] but the soul started projecting
[1:21:20] okay
[1:21:22] he contacts her outside
[1:21:24] contacts her spirit
[1:21:26] and then Satan's Soul connected her soul
[1:21:32] she walked right into the snare
[1:21:35] and you know then results
[1:21:38] why
[1:21:43] daughters our sons how do they get in
[1:21:47] such fixes
[1:21:49] because they think they've been raised
[1:21:50] in a message Church
[1:21:52] I think they got the Holy Ghost and they
[1:21:55] believe the message
[1:21:56] and they think they got the ability to
[1:21:58] discern
[1:22:04] I'll tell you one thing if there's
[1:22:05] anything anybody ought to pray over it's
[1:22:07] a mate
[1:22:10] are
[1:22:11] a place to live a job
[1:22:13] but a woman whoa
[1:22:16] a man whoa
[1:22:22] I don't found out if you get a lemon
[1:22:24] vehicle you can't trade them off
[1:22:27] but if you get a lemon man
[1:22:32] or a lemon woman you just walk around
[1:22:35] like this
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:43] oh yeah how are you doing doing all
[1:22:46] right what are you doing
[1:22:49] stay here I see you
[1:22:50] still got that living Horseman
[1:22:56] no not packing up for kiss they're
[1:22:58] puckered up just to live
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:02] foreign
[1:23:05] well glory to God what in the world am I
[1:23:07] doing on this way the Lord you know
[1:23:14] the natural man will follow what senses
[1:23:16] he'll follow sight he'll follow feeling
[1:23:18] he'll follow emotions
[1:23:20] so
[1:23:24] investigate that's right the soul looks
[1:23:28] the soul scrutinizes
[1:23:34] in the Solar vertebrate that message
[1:23:36] back into the recipient and say stay
[1:23:40] away from him
[1:23:42] text him back and tell him you're not
[1:23:44] interested
[1:23:48] but every girl in the church would want
[1:23:51] him are you sure
[1:23:54] I don't care if every girl in the church
[1:23:55] wanted him if the Holy Ghost didn't want
[1:23:56] him I wouldn't want him
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:01] oh but he's the cutest boy in the whole
[1:24:04] church
[1:24:06] oh
[1:24:11] I didn't realize cute was the only thing
[1:24:13] we was going by
[1:24:16] in fact so pray tell me how did most of
[1:24:18] you men even get married
[1:24:22] maybe you were cuter when you were
[1:24:24] younger brother Greg I don't know
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:32] well you brother Trey I'm just asking I
[1:24:34] don't know
[1:24:36] but you see the real spirit of God
[1:24:38] deserves it looks beyond the pretty hair
[1:24:41] it looks beyond the nice car
[1:24:44] down into the soul
[1:24:47] he said Jesus don't you do it
[1:24:51] this man will cause you 40 Years of hell
[1:24:57] on Earth
[1:24:59] me me me me
[1:25:01] a real daughter of God say Lord help me
[1:25:04] please Lord I feel emotionally attracted
[1:25:06] to this man I feel whatever more but God
[1:25:08] please help me help me God again brother
[1:25:10] Tony can a person fall in love with the
[1:25:11] wrong person sure they can
[1:25:13] there's men in this church that could
[1:25:15] fall in love with somebody else's wife
[1:25:17] that sure don't mean it's a Holy Ghost
[1:25:19] why you're a human being as part of your
[1:25:21] spirit oh I wear a Perfect Mate bunch of
[1:25:23] hogwash
[1:25:25] lust come on children lust and passion
[1:25:28] is that animal part
[1:25:31] oh my perfect maid is not about sex a
[1:25:34] perfect maid is not about lust A Perfect
[1:25:37] Mate is joining together two Souls by
[1:25:40] the word of God
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:45] everything
[1:25:49] oh
[1:25:50] that sure was a long time on verse 14.
[1:25:56] let's look at verse 15 now
[1:25:59] but he
[1:26:00] I love this
[1:26:02] that is spiritual
[1:26:08] judges
[1:26:11] all things
[1:26:13] yet
[1:26:14] he himself
[1:26:16] is judged of no man
[1:26:19] now I'm convinced friends most of us
[1:26:22] first of all we know what this even
[1:26:23] means we certainly don't even live by it
[1:26:27] do you understand
[1:26:28] that if you know who you are what your
[1:26:30] position is what other people say about
[1:26:33] you if you come to that spot it can have
[1:26:36] very little if any bearing on who you
[1:26:40] are
[1:26:42] you're listening to what they say and
[1:26:44] criticize it there's nothing that breaks
[1:26:46] a child of a god a child of God's heart
[1:26:47] any more than for somebody to say you're
[1:26:49] a hypocrite you're not a very good
[1:26:51] Christian you're this out the other and
[1:26:52] we're letting them judge us
[1:26:55] we're not people and you'll even let
[1:26:57] your own self judge you it has no right
[1:27:01] amen the son and of God and Betty Reagan
[1:27:04] has no right to judge this seed Within
[1:27:06] Me it has no right to tell me I'm going
[1:27:10] to hell it has no right to tell me who I
[1:27:13] am and who I am not
[1:27:18] [Applause]
[1:27:25] watch he she
[1:27:28] that are spiritual look at this word
[1:27:30] again pneumaticus
[1:27:32] belonging to the Divine spirit
[1:27:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:37] one who is filled with
[1:27:40] and governed by
[1:27:44] now this is the same word remember that
[1:27:46] your human Spirit comes from pneumatic
[1:27:50] so you have this part and this is where
[1:27:52] the deceit Lays you're born with part of
[1:27:56] this root word in you your human spirit
[1:28:00] but this must come by new births
[1:28:02] pneumaticals does not come the because
[1:28:05] you're a mortal pneumaticus comes
[1:28:07] because you're reborn and immortal
[1:28:11] than those who are spiritual now keep in
[1:28:14] mind now I'm not talking about people
[1:28:16] that are you know that are off the deep
[1:28:17] end and this and that and the other
[1:28:19] people that are all the time extreme and
[1:28:20] emotional and surely the spiritual
[1:28:21] people will be emotional but many times
[1:28:23] we classify a spiritual church it's one
[1:28:26] that has fast music loud music or five
[1:28:28] songs or whatever more and a spiritual
[1:28:30] person is one who jerks and shouts and
[1:28:32] I'm against none of that that's not the
[1:28:34] Biblical term of spiritual
[1:28:38] amen good freak
[1:28:40] but he that is spiritual judges
[1:28:47] don't raise your hand now but how many
[1:28:49] of you do this
[1:28:54] do you judge All Saints
[1:28:58] all things you do everywhere you go
[1:29:00] everything you do your motives your
[1:29:02] objectives
[1:29:03] now we're quick to judge other people
[1:29:06] that's the kind of judgment that gets
[1:29:07] you in trouble this is the kind that
[1:29:08] keeps you out
[1:29:11] if we could judge all things about our
[1:29:13] life the way we judge everybody else man
[1:29:14] we'll be a church I'm telling you but
[1:29:16] instead we judge one another we're
[1:29:18] trying while so and so on us and you're
[1:29:19] trying to judge the heart you don't know
[1:29:21] their heart for friends it's so easy for
[1:29:23] us to misjudge people that's why we
[1:29:25] should commit the judgment to God pray
[1:29:27] for people sure we disagree with people
[1:29:29] we disagree with our motives but when
[1:29:30] it's all said and done none of us knows
[1:29:33] the heart of another
[1:29:35] come on you might as well say Amen but
[1:29:37] yet the thing we should judge and God
[1:29:40] wants us to judge we just let pass
[1:29:41] before us and we just go along and
[1:29:44] but he that is spiritual
[1:29:48] he judges
[1:29:50] he won't go here
[1:29:52] why the spirit forbade him
[1:29:56] you imagine a preacher turning down a
[1:29:58] big meeting
[1:30:00] you imagine message preachers turning
[1:30:01] down a big meeting well there's going to
[1:30:02] be lots of lots of folks there
[1:30:05] I can't imagine very many of them doing
[1:30:06] it
[1:30:08] now can you imagine them turning down a
[1:30:10] big meeting and taking a little meeting
[1:30:13] because they felt little the Lord to go
[1:30:14] the little place
[1:30:16] I guarantee what you'll find you'll find
[1:30:18] God blessing that little meeting better
[1:30:19] than it would the big me
[1:30:23] now most of us want the high seat
[1:30:26] but real true
[1:30:28] that are led by the spirit of God they
[1:30:30] judge they judge they don't need to be
[1:30:32] bragged on they don't need to be told

[1:30:36] church and they're the pillars of the
[1:30:37] church why they know who they are

[1:31:21] brought down to where other people are
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:32] do you understand why Satan does this
[1:31:34] he will have people to judge us
[1:31:37] and say things about us it's not even
[1:31:39] true
[1:31:40] knowing that it will destroy us
[1:31:44] bring us to such a place we're so down
[1:31:46] oh so-and-so said this about and so and
[1:31:48] so said that about me and look what
[1:31:50] effect is Heaven on you I feel sorry for
[1:31:52] so-and-so cause they run their long
[1:31:54] tongue but I feel sorry for you because
[1:31:56] you don't know who you are and it's
[1:31:58] damaging you instead of you looking back
[1:32:01] at him and saying I can laugh at that
[1:32:02] that ain't the truth I don't know my
[1:32:05] heart
[1:32:09] they don't know what's in me I'm not
[1:32:11] doing that for Glory I'm not doing that
[1:32:12] for any other purpose other than to
[1:32:14] please God oh my
[1:32:17] God said him and sister media and
[1:32:20] brother levale was in his house one time
[1:32:22] you hear this in 1963.
[1:32:24] he said she she spoke up and said Bill
[1:32:26] we all know the Lord LED you to Arizona
[1:32:28] the first time
[1:32:30] you said you come back and said that's
[1:32:31] what's bothering me that's what's
[1:32:32] troubled me that God wants you to come
[1:32:34] back here they said well it don't matter
[1:32:36] to me I don't care wherever he believes
[1:32:38] me I want to serve him
[1:32:40] and then levale said I don't see how you
[1:32:43] can take that brother
[1:32:45] people saying things about you and
[1:32:46] calling you things
[1:32:48] I said brother Lee I hope this don't
[1:32:49] bother you but brotherly he's always
[1:32:51] been a little click on the trigger
[1:32:56] I love a man like that don't you not one
[1:32:58] that's quick on the trigger but one that
[1:33:00] can tell you about it
[1:33:07] so he said leave out said I don't
[1:33:09] understand how you could take all that
[1:33:10] and people saying this uh ah that
[1:33:12] brother man said that was a little trial
[1:33:14] that was ordained before the foundation
[1:33:16] of the world to see how I'd handle it
[1:33:19] and he said all of a sudden while we're
[1:33:21] standing there in that room a hand
[1:33:25] appeared and wrote On The Wall come on
[1:33:27] back to Arizona
[1:33:34] wonder if his attitude didn't have a lot
[1:33:36] to do with that hand appearing now
[1:33:38] wonder brother Brandon would have been
[1:33:40] quick on the triggers and drawed out his
[1:33:41] gun what if that ham would have felt
[1:33:43] welcome rotten on the wall I wonder if
[1:33:45] that's why we don't see more rotten on
[1:33:47] the wall it's because our attitudes and
[1:33:49] we let people judge us and we will let
[1:33:52] what they say affect us to such a place
[1:33:54] some folks won't even come to church no
[1:33:56] more because so and so said so and so
[1:33:58] and might be two or three people and yet
[1:34:01] they think them two or three peoples
[1:34:02] this whole church
[1:34:05] come on children deserve judge
[1:34:09] judge properly
[1:34:18] oh my but he
[1:34:24] judges
[1:34:25] all same
[1:34:27] yet
[1:34:29] he himself
[1:34:31] he's judged by no man
[1:34:35] that doesn't mean that people ain't
[1:34:37] going to judge him oh no it's not that
[1:34:39] he will not accept their judgment
[1:34:43] he will not allow himself to be judged
[1:34:46] by infidels and unbelievers and make
[1:34:48] Believers and we Christians
[1:34:53] brother Brandon was judged by many of
[1:34:55] the people has been a woman hater
[1:34:57] do your sisters hold that opinion
[1:34:59] you don't why
[1:35:01] because you're spiritual
[1:35:03] you look at the totally different way
[1:35:05] you don't look at Brothers trying to be
[1:35:06] mean to you hateful you do you sisters
[1:35:08] do you look at brother man we're trying
[1:35:09] to be hard on your sisters and mean and
[1:35:11] brother Brown had an attitude to the
[1:35:12] women will you look at brother brahmins
[1:35:14] being a prophet of God one that God used
[1:35:15] to keep sisters out of hell
[1:35:18] right
[1:35:19] but you not did it by the natural man it
[1:35:22] must be spiritually discerned so when we
[1:35:24] hear him raking down on women and
[1:35:26] Blasting them you know what if you're
[1:35:27] here with a spiritual ear you hear a
[1:35:29] total different thing you do not hear of
[1:35:32] the Judgment oh he was a woman Heather
[1:35:34] like oh Paul he down this side of the
[1:35:36] other you've got spiritual discernment
[1:35:38] you don't hear a woman hate her you hear
[1:35:40] a Wild Man Who Loved God's children you
[1:35:43] hear a man who love God's daughters why
[1:35:47] spiritually discerned
[1:35:52] now let me find a place to close watch
[1:35:54] this
[1:35:55] so the man that is
[1:36:01] all sings
[1:36:05] verse 16.
[1:36:07] cure your way to go into this
[1:36:11] for who
[1:36:13] hath known
[1:36:15] the mind
[1:36:17] of the Lord
[1:36:22] that he may instruct him
[1:36:25] but we have
[1:36:27] the mind
[1:36:29] of Christ
[1:36:31] now notice the mind of Christ is not
[1:36:33] identified with deep things and it'll
[1:36:35] have that
[1:36:36] the mind of Christ is not identified
[1:36:37] with just emotion and it'll have that
[1:36:39] but the mind of Christ is identified
[1:36:42] with the ability to rightly discern and
[1:36:46] judge
[1:36:49] sonship
[1:36:52] do you understand there's folks that
[1:36:53] come to this church and sit here and
[1:36:54] think I'm the devil
[1:36:56] they'll come here and set service after
[1:36:58] service after service and think I am one
[1:37:00] of the worst indentments to this message
[1:37:03] and claim to have the Holy Ghost
[1:37:05] and yes there's thousands around the
[1:37:06] world who feel the very opposite
[1:37:08] and you know what if I allow myself as a
[1:37:10] pastor and I feel that coming if I allow
[1:37:13] myself as a pastor and I allow myself
[1:37:16] under that judgment I'll go to striking
[1:37:18] out and I'll take the entire services to
[1:37:21] preach on them
[1:37:22] blast them blast them Hammer them why
[1:37:25] because I'm coming under their false
[1:37:28] judgment or I can raise myself above
[1:37:32] their judgment and refuse because I know
[1:37:35] who I am I know what I am I know where
[1:37:39] I'm from so I can go that way and take
[1:37:41] the high road and go above what they
[1:37:44] project and preach to those of you who
[1:37:47] come to church to be fed
[1:37:49] or I can get under that judgment under
[1:37:51] that condemnation and Hammer and beaten
[1:37:54] thrush and then you all starve to death
[1:37:56] because I've come under that judgment it
[1:37:59] don't just work for me it works for you
[1:38:02] oh Hallelujah you can allow people here
[1:38:05] at this church to run you down and talk
[1:38:07] about you and control you and manipulate
[1:38:10] you if you want to but I refuse to do so
[1:38:13] I'll refuse to allow people to judge me
[1:38:17] and me walk under their condemnation
[1:38:19] which is only fabricated
[1:38:21] [Applause]
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:27] [Applause]
[1:38:34] foreign
[1:38:39] friends there's folks on this message
[1:38:41] that pray I will die
[1:38:44] there's folks in this message that pray
[1:38:46] I won't have a heart attack
[1:38:50] because they think I'm such a curse
[1:38:52] poor things
[1:38:55] is that pitiful
[1:38:58] if I get killed this afternoon going
[1:38:59] home in a car wreck some of the message
[1:39:01] folks that never shouted in their life
[1:39:02] they'll shout when they hear it
[1:39:06] it's beautiful it's pitiful with people
[1:39:09] that have such an attitude people would
[1:39:11] Rejoice if they heard some terrible
[1:39:13] happen to me not only me but other
[1:39:14] preachers that will and some people
[1:39:15] would do you exactly the same way and
[1:39:17] yet claim to be Christians
[1:39:19] and claim to have the spirits of Agape
[1:39:22] inside of us that's not a god pay Agape
[1:39:25] does not look for judgment upon others
[1:39:27] Agape doesn't look for that and neither
[1:39:29] will the god may allow yourself now
[1:39:31] we'll condemn that oh you shouldn't have
[1:39:33] said that you we're only pointing our
[1:39:34] finger one way
[1:39:36] we need to go back this way not only
[1:39:38] tell them you shouldn't have said that
[1:39:39] but you need to point your back is when
[1:39:40] you shouldn't let it affect you either
[1:39:42] you should not let them bring you down
[1:39:45] use come on down don't get caught
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:51] I wish some of the gossipers would put
[1:39:53] that on Facebook
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:40:07] so easy for us to put up in the social
[1:40:09] media so-and-so done this and so and so
[1:40:10] did that and so and so why don't you
[1:40:12] write about yourself
[1:40:14] so-and-so did it and I was beneath them
[1:40:16] because I shouldn't let it bother me but
[1:40:18] I did
[1:40:19] oh
[1:40:25] y'all smell something
[1:40:32] now notice he comes to those that are
[1:40:34] spiritual they judge all things
[1:40:37] and then he breaks Beyond man's mind
[1:40:42] to the mind of Christ
[1:40:45] for who has known
[1:40:48] the mind of the Lord
[1:40:51] that he may instruct him
[1:40:54] but we have
[1:40:59] the new us
[1:41:02] understanding
[1:41:04] the capacity for Spiritual truth
[1:41:07] The Faculty of perceiving
[1:41:10] Divine things of recognizing goodness
[1:41:13] and of hating evil
[1:41:17] amen
[1:41:18] amen you see what I'm saying
[1:41:20] as I said folks on the message Hate Me
[1:41:22] Or Hate other people
[1:41:24] but they hate what God loves which is
[1:41:26] peculiar
[1:41:28] I mean I'm of the mindset this way I
[1:41:30] want to love what God loves and hate
[1:41:33] what God hates I don't want to hate what
[1:41:36] God loves and love what God hates
[1:41:39] which is where you find many people why
[1:41:40] because the natural man cannot discern
[1:41:43] many times what God loves and what God
[1:41:45] hates
[1:41:46] now God loves The World God loves
[1:41:48] Sinners but he does not love their sin
[1:41:52] amen but in this age everybody wants to
[1:41:53] just bring them right on into the church
[1:41:55] and let them continue on living in their
[1:41:56] sin that's not what God loves God hates
[1:41:58] that
[1:42:00] but when you tell what God loves and
[1:42:02] you're hated because people don't
[1:42:03] understand they don't have the ability
[1:42:04] the fruit on son is the word that for
[1:42:07] awesome to be able to understand the
[1:42:09] capacity to understand it they're
[1:42:10] Discerning it by their natural instinct
[1:42:14] let's stand
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:31] oh
[1:42:33] but we have the mind of Christ
[1:42:37] the power of considering
[1:42:40] and judging
[1:42:42] soberly
[1:42:44] calmly
[1:42:46] and impartially
[1:42:50] you see the mind of Christ will not take
[1:42:51] three people
[1:42:53] with exact circumstances and judge
[1:42:55] differently according to the social
[1:42:57] status
[1:42:59] or according to how much they're worth
[1:43:01] the mind of Christ will take all three
[1:43:03] people judge accordingly by the word no
[1:43:06] matter how much tithes they pay no
[1:43:08] matter how Wilson they are or how poor
[1:43:10] they are that's the mind of Christ
[1:43:12] the mind of Christ will not make special
[1:43:14] you know terms and special groups in
[1:43:17] among the elect all the groups of the
[1:43:19] elect is special but that does not have
[1:43:21] any special groups that you can get by
[1:43:23] with this and you can get by with that
[1:43:24] and you can get by with this and you can
[1:43:26] get by with that hey you better not say
[1:43:27] nothing about them and all the rest of
[1:43:29] us you know we just got to toe the line
[1:43:30] that's not the mind of Christ
[1:43:32] that's natural carnal people who don't
[1:43:35] understand the mind of Christ
[1:43:38] notice this
[1:43:40] the power of considering and judging
[1:43:43] soberly calmly
[1:43:45] and impartially now you can find this in
[1:43:48] your Strong's Concordance this is the
[1:43:49] meaning of the word that Paul chose to
[1:43:51] use
[1:43:52] so the mind of Christ is the views
[1:43:55] feelings and temperament
[1:43:58] of Christ
[1:44:01] the views the feelings and the
[1:44:04] temperament of Christ so how can we tell
[1:44:07] if we have the mind of Christ
[1:44:10] by the way you judge
[1:44:18] can you judge right from wrong or is
[1:44:19] everything Gray
[1:44:21] is your judgment true is your judgment
[1:44:24] just
[1:44:25] is your judgment
[1:44:27] impartial
[1:44:29] because this is the way Christ will
[1:44:31] judge
[1:44:33] amen praise the Lord
[1:44:36] you love him
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:42] spiritual
[1:44:43] discernment
[1:44:46] inspironments together
[1:44:54] Lord Jesus
[1:44:56] thank you today Father for your word
[1:45:01] Lord it makes me feel so bad
[1:45:04] because I know so many times I misjudged
[1:45:07] so many things
[1:45:10] I misjudged people's motives objectives
[1:45:14] and I've allowed the Judgment of others
[1:45:17] about me
[1:45:20] to affect me Lord
[1:45:23] I pray that your teachers Lord Jesus
[1:45:28] you were a man when you're upon the
[1:45:30] Earth and
[1:45:31] brother Ben said whenever they laughed
[1:45:32] at you to score and they're in the New
[1:45:34] Testament the scripture they liked you
[1:45:36] to scorn that your face turned red and
[1:45:38] it embarrassed you
[1:45:40] so una hat is to feel embarrassment
[1:45:44] but yet you never let them bring you
[1:45:47] down to their level
[1:45:50] and many times when people run us down
[1:45:53] and talk about us and do bad things
[1:45:54] against us
[1:45:55] we focus so much on how wrong they are
[1:45:59] and that is true they should not do that
[1:46:02] but why is it we don't focus on how
[1:46:04] wrong we were to let them affect us in
[1:46:05] such a way
[1:46:08] and somebody can post something on
[1:46:10] Facebook about us or send us an email or
[1:46:12] a text or whatever ruin our whole day
[1:46:15] ruin our whole day with you with our
[1:46:18] family with everybody else
[1:46:20] because we allow ourselves to come
[1:46:22] underneath their judgment
[1:46:24] and then we go to worrying and fretting
[1:46:26] and fretting
[1:46:27] and always Lord When people's going to
[1:46:29] leave church and when there's going to
[1:46:31] have they're always going to look for an
[1:46:32] excuse I have been many many people's
[1:46:35] excuse
[1:46:36] this church has been many many other
[1:46:38] people have been and it breaks my heart
[1:46:40] to think of such
[1:46:41] you know I would never try to keep
[1:46:44] anybody out of the kingdom of God
[1:46:46] I've spent my life
[1:46:48] trying to bring them in
[1:46:51] but yet
[1:46:52] Satan knows how it bothers us
[1:46:55] forgive us for not recognizing and
[1:46:57] discerning
[1:46:59] and realizing who it is that's doing it
[1:47:01] to us
[1:47:02] we admit we have shortcomings and
[1:47:04] failures
[1:47:05] for that we ask your pardon
[1:47:08] but all of our shortcomings and our
[1:47:09] failures
[1:47:11] that has nothing to do with our souls
[1:47:13] that we desire people to stay away from
[1:47:15] you
[1:47:16] I don't know of anybody I wouldn't want
[1:47:18] to be in heaven I know of no one that I
[1:47:21] would want to be their lord
[1:47:23] yet we allow ourselves to be judged
[1:47:27] we allow even our own flesh
[1:47:29] to misjudge us
[1:47:31] and we will accept that judgment
[1:47:34] instead of refusing
[1:47:37] to allow the outer man and the spirit
[1:47:39] man
[1:47:41] to pass this condemnation
[1:47:43] to the soul
[1:47:46] make us spiritual Lord
[1:47:49] I desire to have a spiritual church
[1:47:52] father
[1:47:54] by that I don't mean one that worships
[1:47:56] and we do and I thank you for that
[1:47:58] I thank you for that about our church
[1:48:02] but Lord we don't want to just be a
[1:48:04] worshiping Church
[1:48:06] we want to be a spiritual church
[1:48:09] that we can judge
[1:48:11] Help the People Lord and thinking of
[1:48:14] their behavior and their activity what
[1:48:16] they do I mentioned Facebook I mentioned
[1:48:18] again because Lord is becoming such a
[1:48:19] thing in the message
[1:48:21] it's easy to see that many of the people
[1:48:23] who post the things I don't have it so I
[1:48:25] don't know I'm just just what I'm told
[1:48:28] they have no discernment whatsoever
[1:48:30] posting things that are so foolish it's
[1:48:32] like Facebook gets everybody a Pulpit
[1:48:34] every man woman boy and girl can preach
[1:48:37] on Facebook
[1:48:39] help them Lord to realize
[1:48:41] when they post something on Facebook and
[1:48:44] they're identified that they come with
[1:48:46] to this church
[1:48:48] they are falsely pulling me in this
[1:48:51] church
[1:48:52] into that identity
[1:48:54] they're pulling you they're pulling this
[1:48:56] message
[1:48:57] into that identity of what they're
[1:48:59] posting
[1:49:02] but the natural man wants to argue and
[1:49:04] fuss and debate
[1:49:07] Lord Jesus help us
[1:49:10] help us to be led by the Holy Ghost
[1:49:12] governed by the Holy Ghost
[1:49:17] Lord Jesus forgive us of our carnality
[1:49:20] forgive us of our foolishness
[1:49:24] make us like you Lord
[1:49:26] make us like you Lord Jesus
[1:49:30] Hallelujah
[1:49:33] is that your desire today
[1:49:35] you raise your hand
[1:49:37] say Lord be mindful of me
[1:49:39] now many of you ain't got Facebook you
[1:49:41] know what you're like me you know what
[1:49:42] it even is really but in your own
[1:49:44] everyday life in your temper in the way
[1:49:47] you answer people and what you say back
[1:49:50] if the deacons ask you to park in a
[1:49:52] certain spot you fly off the handle no
[1:49:54] you're going to tell me that's the mind
[1:49:55] of Christ no
[1:49:58] the deacons ask you to be make your
[1:50:00] children be quiet you get mad and stomp
[1:50:02] out you're going to tell me that's the
[1:50:04] mind of Christ no it's not
[1:50:06] we're here to worship this is not a
[1:50:08] circus
[1:50:09] we're not here to to entertain your
[1:50:11] children we're here to worship
[1:50:13] they ask you to be quiet in the foyer
[1:50:15] and all that look for him this is a
[1:50:16] house of worship
[1:50:17] we want to come here and worship and we
[1:50:19] want to respect God
[1:50:21] so judge all things
[1:50:24] so many of us are so so fast to speak
[1:50:29] but the scripture tells us be quick to
[1:50:31] hear and slow to speak and slow giraffes
[1:50:37] the mind of Christ will judge all these
[1:50:41] things but the carnal natural man will
[1:50:44] figure it out and to do sit and add it
[1:50:46] and subtract it and figure it all out
[1:50:48] then you've done said it and done done
[1:50:50] it and done made a mess and then trying
[1:50:51] to figure out how to fix it when the
[1:50:53] spirit of God would have led you right
[1:50:55] around that trap
[1:50:58] I don't know about you I want to be more
[1:51:02] spiritual
[1:51:04] more spiritual
[1:51:06] I'm going to talk about having dreams
[1:51:07] and visions
[1:51:08] I'm not talking about speaking in
[1:51:10] tongues I thank God for those things
[1:51:12] some dreams and things that I've had
[1:51:13] from the Lord to be honest with you
[1:51:15] sometimes I wish I hadn't had them
[1:51:17] because sometimes things that you see
[1:51:19] you wish you hadn't seen them
[1:51:22] things that you see about people
[1:51:24] an Insight that God gives you sometimes
[1:51:26] I wish I didn't know it
[1:51:28] because it was so much on you
[1:51:30] I ain't talking about being that
[1:51:31] I'm talking about brother Jim been able
[1:51:33] to discern
[1:51:34] to discern
[1:51:36] and judge all things scrutinize take a
[1:51:40] magnifying glass not of the word just
[1:51:43] the word
[1:51:44] but of the spirit because sometimes the
[1:51:46] word don't misunderstand me the word
[1:51:49] won't give you brother Matthew the
[1:51:50] direction you need
[1:51:52] you listen to a tape and you search in
[1:51:54] the message and it won't give you that
[1:51:56] direction you know why it's a spirit-led
[1:51:58] magnifying glass
[1:52:00] there won't be a scripture about the gym
[1:52:01] there won't be a quarter
[1:52:03] but it'll be that Spirit leading you
[1:52:06] oh God
[1:52:09] oh God
[1:52:12] Hallelujah
[1:52:15] Hallelujah
[1:52:18] let's just raise your hands and
[1:52:20] make our hands as it were a doorway
[1:52:23] let's just slide our hands and her arms
[1:52:26] be a doorway into our heart
[1:52:29] not that we need to get saved
[1:52:31] not that many of you need to get the
[1:52:32] Holy Ghost
[1:52:34] but that we can just give him more
[1:52:35] control
[1:52:36] that his mind can judge
[1:52:39] that if I had the mind of Christ and I
[1:52:41] have his feelings I have his views I
[1:52:44] have his perspectives
[1:52:47] so that if I will allow it those views
[1:52:48] will speak out of me and act out of me
[1:52:52] and reflect out of me and out of you
[1:52:55] and me me more

[1:55:46] like this
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:54] before we go would you turn him put your
[1:55:56] hand on the person there by you
[1:56:00] now want to ask you something children
[1:56:01] what would we give for a spiritual
[1:56:02] church upon the seal
[1:56:05] what would a spiritual church I'm going
[1:56:07] to talk about what you and I might think
[1:56:08] Are Spiritual to the people but what God
[1:56:10] would look at us and say Happy Valley
[1:56:12] Church
[1:56:13] is a spiritual church
[1:56:15] what would that be worse to us what
[1:56:17] would be the value of such a thing
[1:56:19] what could we do if we were a more
[1:56:22] spiritual body
[1:56:24] of the spirit of God moving among us and
[1:56:26] not just Supernatural things with
[1:56:28] healings and miracles and things like
[1:56:30] that and we long for that in a greater
[1:56:32] way
[1:56:33] but to make us like this to all we judge
[1:56:35] and we have the ability to know right
[1:56:37] from wrong
[1:56:38] we have the ability to judge from within
[1:56:41] us and hear that buzzer go off within
[1:56:44] our soul
[1:56:48] I want you to pray for that person
[1:56:50] standing by you
[1:56:51] no doubt they have made many mistakes
[1:56:54] no doubt they have fallen into many
[1:56:56] snares even this very day and we'll tell
[1:56:59] you you believe what you want to but the
[1:57:01] Holy Ghost changed my direction earlier
[1:57:03] into this sermon
[1:57:05] and led me in this certain way for
[1:57:07] somebody here today that he's dealing
[1:57:09] with your heart
[1:57:11] this is not on my notes it was even
[1:57:13] nothing that I even studied out to go
[1:57:15] and I felt him changed me
[1:57:18] so he knows what he's done
[1:57:22] you may you may not know that person
[1:57:24] that you got your hand on there may be a
[1:57:26] snare laid in front of them tomorrow
[1:57:28] maybe a woman maybe a man maybe a temper
[1:57:31] maybe a business transaction they're
[1:57:33] fixing to make
[1:57:34] pray for him that God will leave him
[1:57:36] that God will help some that even though
[1:57:39] they look at the ground the scenario
[1:57:41] around the habitat looks identical but
[1:57:43] yet there's a leaf out of place there's
[1:57:46] a branch wrong there's something wrong
[1:57:48] their senses may not pick it up but the
[1:57:51] spirit of God can lead him
[1:57:54] let's just pray for one another before
[1:57:55] we go
[1:58:02] Lord Jesus
[1:58:04] I'm not a prophet so I do not have the
[1:58:07] ability to peer into the supernatural
[1:58:09] the way prophets would
[1:58:11] but yet I know father
[1:58:14] that you lead your children
[1:58:16] and I know this service today Father God
[1:58:19] was orchestrated by you you know
[1:58:22] I didn't even get to go the direction
[1:58:23] that I'd studied and I'd laid out
[1:58:25] yesterday and today
[1:58:27] but that doesn't matter what's important
[1:58:29] is I followed you
[1:58:32] Lord Jesus I do not know what lay before
[1:58:34] these people nor do I know even what
[1:58:36] lays before me
[1:58:38] but I ask you that should help us Lord
[1:58:41] or this enemy he knows how to prepare
[1:58:44] the snares
[1:58:46] he knows how to make them Lord
[1:58:49] as I've been into different nations in
[1:58:52] Africa
[1:58:53] it was I was taken to the Messiah Mara
[1:58:55] many years ago by Brethren the message
[1:58:57] who's a game warden there
[1:58:59] and he took us about and showed us
[1:59:02] in a little closer perspective on what
[1:59:04] most people get to see
[1:59:06] how the rhinoceros and the elephant and
[1:59:08] different animals are poached and how
[1:59:10] they make snares for them
[1:59:13] and Lord as I've seen some of these
[1:59:15] snares and it's absolutely amazing as I
[1:59:18] would stand and look right at them
[1:59:20] or see somebody that make a snare for a
[1:59:22] rabbit or something else and me with an
[1:59:25] untrained eye look right at it and never
[1:59:28] even see it
[1:59:30] but the person with a trained eye or the
[1:59:32] person who laid the snare
[1:59:34] they could point out this and that and
[1:59:36] the other to me and once they pointed it
[1:59:38] out I would see it
[1:59:40] Lord Jesus we need you Lord
[1:59:44] to help us in our life
[1:59:46] we know you don't lay the snares
[1:59:49] but you know the man who did Lay Him
[1:59:52] Lord may you help these young people
[1:59:55] help these businessmen
[1:59:57] help these Housewives help the ministers
[2:00:00] help every one of us Lord God
[2:00:03] from the front to the back to the
[2:00:04] nurseries those are streaming
[2:00:06] help all of us Lord
[2:00:09] help us father when Satan lay snares
[2:00:11] before us may we be led by the mind of
[2:00:15] Christ
[2:00:16] we want to be spiritual Lord Jesus
[2:00:20] when I say that I don't mean fanaticism
[2:00:23] or I feel led I feel led I feel led but
[2:00:25] Lord
[2:00:27] whenever we say that I feel that it will
[2:00:29] prove if we was led of you or not
[2:00:30] because it will be the mind of Christ to
[2:00:33] judge soberly discreetly without
[2:00:36] impartiality
[2:00:37] help us Lord every man woman boy and
[2:00:40] girl that is filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:00:42] in This Place Lord God
[2:00:44] I believe we need this more than ever
[2:00:47] before in our lives
[2:00:48] to be led by the spirit of God
[2:00:51] help us Lord Jesus make us more
[2:00:53] sensitive father
[2:00:56] oh granted Lord God
[2:00:59] that we may have the mind of Christ
[2:01:02] to discern to scrutinize to judge to
[2:01:05] look
