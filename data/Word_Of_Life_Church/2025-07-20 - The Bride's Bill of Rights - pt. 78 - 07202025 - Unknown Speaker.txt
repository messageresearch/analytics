[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Brother Donnie a couple maybe a week or more ago he was just talking about how when Erica was passing away, how he's been dealing with it. And he he said he knows that he's God and God alone. And inspiration struck me for this song. [Music] God and God alone [Music] created all these things we call our own. From the mighty to the small, the glory in them all is God [Music] and God's alone. [Music] God and God alone reveals his word to those who are his own. And all the best and worst of man won't change the master's plan. For he's God and God alone. He's God and God alone. He's fit to rule the universe's throne. Let everything that lives reserve its trueest praise. For God and God alone. God and God alone. He'll be the joy of our future home. He will be our one desire. Oh, our hearts will never tire of God and God alone. He's God and he's God alone. He's fit to rule the universe's throne. Let everything that lives reserve its true is praise for God and God alone. Yes, God and God alone. will be the joy of our future home. He will be our one desire. Oh, our hearts will never tire of God and God alone. He's God and he's God alone. He's fit to rule the universe's throne. Let everything that lives reserve its true is praise. for God and God alone. Oh my. Thank you, Lord. World famous Brown family had a song for us today, but they be singing a little bit later on. I guess let's all stand if you will. We're going to sing a little course as Brother Donnie comes. I know we got a baby dedication. We want to be real real timely this morning with our time, but looking forward to the preaching of the word of the Lord, aren't we? &gt;&gt; God is so good to us. We've got so much to be thankful for. Do you believe that this morning with all your heart? So much to thank him for. Let's do that course, brother Harry, if you will. And I've got so much to thank him for. So much to praise him for. You see, he's been so good to me. When I think of what he's done and where he brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. One more time. Yes. I've got so [Music] So good to me [Music] what he's done and where he's brought us all from. I've got so much to say. Let's sing it again, shall we? Oh, we've got so much. I've got so much to thank him for. [Music] You see, he's been so good to me. Oh, thank you, Lord. and where you brought us from. We've got so much to thank you for. Praise the Lord. Go ahead and give him a nice hand. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You can be seated, Brother Josh and Sister Caitlyn. If they'll bring their little little baby girl that the Lord's given to them, we'll dedicated her to the Lord today. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Isn't she a doll? &gt;&gt; I've been watching her daddy as he's been sitting back there in the back and he just sits down and looks at her like that. He just &gt;&gt; That's true. He's smitten, didn't he, sis? &gt;&gt; You imagine as an earthly father can look at a child and be so smitten. What about our father God? When he sees us and give birth to us and we grow and fall and make mistakes and he just looks at us and loves us so much. Let's pray together. Lord Jesus, my brother and sister stand here today and Lord, they want to bring their little daughter that you've given to their union into your presence. Lord, human love is such a powerful thing. Would cause a mother to run into a burning house to save her child. It would cause a parent to do horrendous acts that humanly they wouldn't do. Lord God, it reminds us of your great love that Almighty God would leave heaven to come to a cursed place like this because you loved us so much. Father, as I bring her into your presence today, I pray Lord that you just keep her by your grace. Lord Jesus, make my sister as a prophet has taught us to be the fifth gospel to be able to instill in her that which only a godly mother can do. Help my brother that he can be able to be such an example to her. May she be raised in a home where singing and tapes are played and preaching and she comes to church and hears the songs of Zion. Lord God, would you grant it? Keep her from the evils of the day. If time should tear, Lord, that should get old enough to be able to know right from wrong. Maybe she will give her heart to you when she's young. Lord, we dedicate her to you today for a life of service. Father, in the name of Jesus. Amen. Well, I put her to sleep. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord, baby. God bless y'all. Let's stand together and I'll read my text and put some of the rest of you to sleep. Now, Isn't it wonderful to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; To be a child of God, to know the awesome things that the Lord Jesus has done and is currently doing. I'm just so happy myself to be a part of it. Let's uh turn to the scripture that we've been reading here for so many uh weeks now in second Peter chapter 1 verse two. Now I want you to think as we read this today that the setting is um in the first century the churches are very very few and small in number. This would have been probably in a lot of places a massive church in the f in the early days in the first church age. um they would have had to hid. They would have been by this time when second Peter's written persecution has already started coming against the church. People have lost their lives. People are paying a tremendous price to be a Christian. Unlike today, you just get in your car and you multiple choice. I want any money or mo. Which one do I want to go? So, you just pick the church. And that day there was no such a thing. That's right. Think of it. Initially, there's only one church. Only one. &gt;&gt; So, if you'd have went to Corinth, they wouldn't split message churches everywhere. There's one. &gt;&gt; That is God's original plan. &gt;&gt; And then the others properly go out and are sent out by apostolic direction, not the cunningness of man. &gt;&gt; Same way in cree, same way in Patmas and all the different areas where the churches were. And this man here had a real experience with these virtues that we're going to read about. Now he says, "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us unto us exceeding great and precious promises. I hope we never get away from looking at the promises of God with such terms of endearment. Oh, do we take it for granted, children. Listen what Peter says. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great great would have been wonderful, but exceeding great and precious promises. and that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue, and to virtue knowledge. Now, remember when Peter first starts out, he's got he has faith. He definitely has faith even before his conversion. But he also had to realize he didn't have enough faith to keep him. He thought he'd stand for the Lord Jesus no matter what. Matter of fact, he bragged about it. I don't care what John does. I'll be with you. I'll stand with you. And Jesus said before the crows, you'll deny you even know me. He probably didn't even believe him then because his human faith was so strong. But you see, human faith will fail us. &gt;&gt; Human virtue will fail us. human knowledge, patience, temperance, all these things. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue, and to virtue knowledge. So when we read this, keep in mind, we're talking about a man that experienced this firsthanded himself. Peter didn't start out a perfect Christian, a perfect preacher. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; What did he do? He had to grow in what? Same pattern God wants you and I to grow in. and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity. How many like to be remembered today as we pray? Amen. Let's just bow our heads if you would. Our heavenly father, we count it such a privilege that we could be gathered here today, Lord, once again, not under the oposes of a system, not under the oposes of the leadership of some carnal man that wants to build a kingdom for himself, but we believe under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Father, we are asking today that you would help us as we've gathered here, Lord. Our needs are many. and we're bringing before you those that are sick, those that are weary, those Father, that need the Holy Ghost, those that are going through tremendous times in their life. And we're just praying today for strength for your people, not just in our local assembly that we know from people around the world, Lord, that we're in contact with constantly that there are so many needs among your children. But we believe if we can look at it right, these are opportunities of faith by which you can move for us. So we present our needs, our desires. I present myself to you today, Father. Help me to surrender to you and to submit, open my mouths, Lord, to the things that are pleasing to you. Shut my mouth to things that would be wrong or irrelevant. Help me, Lord Jesus, that I can follow your leading today. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless your children. Sure love you. Today you can be seated. I decided I'd go ahead and preach on u patience again. [Applause] That was about as weak as dish water, wasn't it? Now, I said that during our scripture readings, not just to take up time, but so you would be able to catch the foundation of the man that we're talking about. Now, we know that people can say all kinds of words. You know, I see it. I've done so many funerals in my ministry and watch people as they come through and they're shaking hands with the family or putting their arms around them, whatever it is they do to express their feelings and condolences. And many times I've heard them as they say, "I know exactly what you're going through. I I know exactly the pain that you're feeling." And in one way, they might know a similar pain, but it don't mean they know exactly because every marriage is a little bit different. every relationship of a parent to a child, of a grandson, to a grandmother or a grandfather. And it's the same with preachers preaching sermons that preachers can get a lot of good thoughts and put a lot of things together. But there's a great difference between a man preaching from theology and preaching with theology mixed with experience. Now, I hear songs sometimes, gospel songs, which is the only kind I listen to, of course. And I will think of this brother or maybe that sister, and I I'll send brother Larry sometimes songs and say, "Hey, see if anybody any of our singers would like to like to learn this song. I'll send some to Harry. I'll send different ones to brother Caleb or or different ones that I think I know their style and and how they enjoy, you know, certain songs and I'll send it to them." But with many of them, if I don't do it then, I've done it before. And I will give them this little disclaimer. Now, if this does not connect with you, don't you feel obligated to learn to sing this song because I've had people to do me the same way that they would send me a song. I want you to sing this song. Would you learn to sing this song for me? And I'll listen to it and listen to it and listen to it. Good words. Nothing wrong with a song. Tempo's good. You know, everything about the song, I don't see anything wrong with it necessarily, but there's just no connection with me being a singer. Crippled up as I am as being a singer, there's no connection between the song and me. Does that make sense? Now, you singers understand what I'm talking about, don't you? And somebody else could hear it and say, "Oh, that sounds just like Brother Harvey. Oh, I can hear Brother Harvey's tone. That sounds just like Brother Dave Swanson." and brother Dave Swanson gets it and he's wrinkling his nose and thinking, "What were they thinking when they sent me that song?" So, it's the same way with preaching and with preachers in that preachers could preach about patience and love and forgiveness and kindness and yet maybe themselves have never really been tested to a degree to where they had to forgive somebody that had caused them such pain in their life. Now, will what they say have weight? It will because it's the truth. And God's truth can never be preached or even be shared by one another without it having value. But will it have the same value as coming from a person who is not only preaching it, but who is living and preaching the same sermon themsself? Now you see God knew that in relation to humanity from the Old Testament he could tell them don't do this don't do that go here don't do there dress this way don't mix your field with seeds don't put linen and woolen in your garments don't do this don't do that don't do that and then God gave the law which could never give them a a love and a release from sin but God wanted to understand when he would tell people don't do this. How much more simple can I make it? Don't do this. And people said, "We won't do it, Lord." And they turned right around and do it, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Preach. &gt;&gt; And God's thinking, "What is the matter with them bunch of nottheads?" &gt;&gt; Now, that's Kentucky vernacular. So God wanted to become a human and understand whenever the word said don't do this. He wanted to understand by experience the feel in flesh that even though you know you're not supposed to but there's something about a human being that something still pulls them &gt;&gt; that makes them want to &gt;&gt; preach. So God wanted to understand so that he could condemn sin not in heaven but in the flesh. &gt;&gt; So he wanted to condemn sin in the flesh. So he must have human desire, human makeup. So can you imagine Almighty God allowing himself to condense sin to such a level that he could suffer sexual temptation &gt;&gt; that God could suffer the temptation of wanting to drink, &gt;&gt; wanting to find something that would help ease the human tension and human pressure that we all feel. &gt;&gt; He didn't want just to add more scriptures to the Torah, the law as you know it. He didn't want to add just more books and more thou shalt not and thou shalt not. Oh my goodness, you imagine what it would be in the age we live with all the thou shalt nots that we don't need to do. My goodness, we'd all have books packing around under our arms, wouldn't we? Because Satan is constantly by science updating and making sin more desirable. And in reality, if you're going to go only by what's written, you're going to have many sins out here that the Bible does not describe them word by word. &gt;&gt; But the Bible covers them all by three main issues. Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of light. That covers every bit of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Peter is not writing now of something that is very good theology. By now he himself no doubt has been able to grow up to where he's far beyond his initial stage of faith in the Lord Jesus. He's beyond virtue because we can see in Acts two, the spirit of God had began to anoint these apostles and the holy fire of God had come inside of them and they were doing the same thing, miraculous works that Jesus did. So virtue was coming out of them and then knowledge and then Peter was moving himself. So he's growing along with the church. So as he's riding here and God reveals to him these steps of what God's going to use for the building. material. Peter can no doubt look at himself and think, "My goodness, that's what's happened to me. That's what's happened to John. That's what happened to Peter and James and the brothers that rub shoulders with the Lord Jesus." Wouldn't that been an awesome experience to been there among them disciples? But to be honest with you, if I had a choice between the two time frames, I would choose this one right here. &gt;&gt; Come on. If I could have lived 2,000 years ago and my name would have been in there and then and and Jesus called Donnie and Jesus called J. D and Jesus called Rob, I'd rather live right now than I would have them because they couldn't get the Holy Ghost till after he had done lived and gone. But now it's my possession and yours. So in reality, we live in a greater time. So Peter understood what it was like to lack patience, especially with his brethren and to lack patience sometimes with God. He knew what it was like to lack godliness, which means to be like God. He knew what it was like about to lack brotherly kindness. So he's not writing sitting around and reading somebody's book. And boy, this would make a good sermon here in second Peter. I think I'll put it together today. I think I'll write it all down and I'm going to select this. Peter never selected this. The Holy Ghost did. You believe that the spirit of God was the one who anointed Peter to write down these building blocks that God was going to lay during the church ages and also in the individuals. Let's go back again to verse six. And to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience. Let's look at the meaning of the word again. Patience enduring patience continuence patient waiting help us Jesus steadfastness in the New Testament the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety even when the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly. Now, we're talking about something then that it is not given or even thought attainable for a sensible person that this can ever be got by a young Christian. Now, whenever we did our landscaping around here a couple of years ago, and brother Aaron and his brother set most of it out, and as I've noticed it this spring that some of them died and didn't make it through the winter. So, I've been coming back and replacing them. And some of them that's been there for a couple of years now, they've been able to break out of the pot shape that they were in whenever the brother set them out. And the roots begin to go out from the because they wrap around the inside of the plastic pot and they'll wrap around this way vertically horizontally. And then that's as far as they can go until they're released. And then once you take them out, you dig a bigger hole, one and a half to two times bigger. And you dig the hole, you put it down, you rake the fresh soil around it. Then if you desire, you can put root stimulator which helps them with the shock because plants get a shock when you take them out of the pot they're in and then you pot them into the ground. So it's into shock through the plant. So they have made a certain fertilizer of a ratio that will stimulate growth. Now that's all good. You can follow them steps exactly right. But then if you go to watering that plant during the dry months and you will what they call shallow water and all you do is water the top of the ground around that plant. Now what you're going to do is cause those roots to come this way toward the very top cuz you're shallow watering and that's where they know the water is. But if you deep water that ground around that plant, then whenever the sun will dry out the first inch and a half or 2 in of the top soil, then the roots know that water is deeper down. And what will the roots do? They start going this way instead of this way. Now, that's the way it is with a lot of Christians. They go to churches that all they do is shallow water the top of the ground. And they make excuses for why they can't live right, while they're fall short of the glory of God. And they simply give them a little patch and a little pat here and there. God understands. God understands. So they're shallow watering their Christianity and they never become stable. &gt;&gt; Now I love hydranches as y'all can tell by looking when you come in. So, what I did was this spring I started planting some more to add to our collection. But what I found out was, which I already knew it, but this this summer's really brought it out. These that have been in the ground now for a couple of years, I didn't hardly have to water them at all. But these new ones that I've set out, I've had to water them, some of them daily, and I've been calling them hydrangeas baby Christians. I told Carol the other day, she said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "I'm going over to the church to water the baby Christians because 90 plus degree weather, humidity, all that, them little old things, they go to shriveling up that way and the little old blooms go to dropping and drooping down on the side and they look absolutely awful." Well, hallelujah. That's the way some of y'all come into church sometimes. your little leaves is all weirded around and your little blooms is all over and you got this big sour look on your face. Come on, somebody. But then I notice these same ones out here that have been out for a while and they've been through some hard times. They passed the initial shock stage of being planted out there and they made it past that. Then they made it through some dry spells, some wet spells. They've survived a couple of winters. Cold, you know, single digits. Pretty tough stuff. And yet standing right there beside them. And right behind them, especially on this bank, are some little bitty babies about this tall. And all my other brothers delicately put them in the ground. And then as I begin to go around and I water a little here, and I'll water a little there, and I'll water a little here. And you realize that we are much like them types of plants. But myself, I don't desire to be a baby hydrangea all of my life. Do any of you all? Is that your vision of yourself that you've got to be babyed through every trial, baby through every test? Oh, sure. Through long droughts, we all need a little extra help every now and then. So, if you see me kind of swiveled up, if you don't mind, pour a little bucket of water on me. But you know what? I don't want a bucket of water every time I go through a trial. I want to be rooted and settled and I want my roots to go down this way in the message of the hour, the gospel of Jesus Christ. That's friends exactly what's happened in our ranks in the last several years. Why folks have left? You know why? Because they were shallow watered. They were shallow water. Many of them was following the preacher that led them into the message. They never had a revelation. No way. And then they lost confidence in that preacher or that deacon that gave them a book and there went their version of the message. Well, I'll tell you one thing. If that's all you've got, I feel sorry for you. But if you're built upon a rock, there ain't enough devils in hell. There ain't enough preachers that fall away or deacons that fall away to ever move you because you are not shallow watered. You are rooted and anchored down in the ground. And your roots are not on the top of the ground. Well, I don't feel like going to church. I don't feel like praising God. You've been shallow watered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. God wants you to go to church when you don't feel like going to church. God wants you to praise him when you don't feel like praising him. That's the greatest time there is to praise God when you don't even feel like it. Oh my. Oh, but brother Donnie, I'm so weary. Come on. You've been watered deeply around here. You've been watered deeply to give you some stability. When the sickness comes and the disease come and the trouble come, we are not moving. Amen. We're going to praise him in the sunshine. We're going to praise him in the storms. We're going to praise him in the difficulty because we have been watered deeply. And our roots go beyond up here. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Give us patience, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of you didn't say it. You was afraid he'd hear you. He caught your thoughts. Anyway, &gt;&gt; notice this. The prophet said, "No wonder Paul could stand in the face of death and say, "Oh, death, where's your stain? Grave, where is your victory?" See, through tribulations, he had learned the love of God. Through tribulations, so through tribulation, we learn something about the love of God that grace alone never teaches us. You see, those who associate understand the great depth of God with grace alone are going to be robbed of so much stuff cuz this is the way they equate grace, love, grace, mercy, grace, love, grace, mercy. And they don't understand and they don't want tribulation. Look, I'm not an idiot. I'm not standing up here and said, "Lord, give me another trial. Give me another test." I might have been born in the morning, but it wasn't this morning and it wasn't yesterday morning. You ain't looking. No, no friends. I'll tell you right now that goes around asking God for trouble. Asking God, Lord, try me. Try me, Lord, if you want to. Oh, no. I don't do that. I'd rather have the mountain top any day out of the week than I would the valley. I'd rather have healing. I'd rather have health. Come on, somebody. I'd rather have things going good, too. But I know in order for me to be what I need to be, I'm going to have to experience hardship, trials, troubles. And to be honest, I don't ask God to keep them away from me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I would be ashamed to ask him such. Notice the prophet said, "Through tribulation, he had learned the love of God. Suffering brings patience. It works tribulations to bring patience. Of course, now patience makes love and trust. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Romans 15:4. Can we take a journey through the scripture this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; For whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning that we through faith &gt;&gt; virtue knowledge that we through patience and comfort. Oh, praise God. Patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. Don't you love your Bible? Oh, thank God for letting us have a a Bible in this. Imagine our brothers and sisters around the world, some of them still do not have a Bible in their possession. Churches in Africa, churches in India, which are helping buy them, don't even have a personal Bible. We've got them laying around in our home. We've got them on our phone. have got them here and there and there. And do we even use them? &gt;&gt; Oh my preach, brother. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. I'll tell you, this man that we're talking about here that wrote this as well, had his own experience of patience. It wasn't a beautiful theological term that he thought would make a nice passage of scripture. He had his own trial of patience with God and with people. Notice in Colossians 1:10, that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering. Yeah, I pulled it up. &gt;&gt; It says joyfulness. &gt;&gt; I mean, I wanted to pull that up to make sure I wasn't overlooking that word. I've got them letters that big right now. And that's that's exactly what he said. strengthened was almighty according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness. Imagine going around a smile on your face and people say your bills paid. Nope. Your rich uncle died. No, it left you a fortune. No, he died in a poor house. What are you smiling about? I'm a child of God. &gt;&gt; I was lost and he saved me. I was blind and he opened my eyes. He delivered me. Set me free. Oh, you've got so much more to be happy for than you got to be sad about. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Thessalonians 1:3, remembering without ceasing your work of faith. Oh my. And labor of love and patience of hope. Now, not now just patience with hope in this verse, but your patience of hope. So, you're waiting on hope. And this is the way you're waiting for it. patiently. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there when it seem like there's no hope in sight and you're patiently waiting for hope, which is faith's little weakest sister, &gt;&gt; but you get so desperate and you seem like faith. Oh my, it's so so far out. You say, "I'll settle for a little bit of hope right now." Cuz even sister hope can help and you ain't got no hope. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory. And patience of hope and our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our father. Hebrews 6:11. And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to full assurance of hope unto the end. That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and &gt;&gt; inherit the promises. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lance, you know what I realized when I was studying on this yesterday? I realized as a family, church family too, we patiently waited, patiently waited for God to bring healing to Erica, for God to bring healing to some of your loved ones that he took. We waited. We believed. We claimed the promise. We waited with patience for him to heal them, &gt;&gt; but he didn't. So, he took them. And it just struck me yesterday. So, our patience has not stopped, but it's only shifted directions. So now, instead of patiently waiting for them to be healed, &gt;&gt; we're patiently waiting for them to get up. &gt;&gt; So the trial does not stop. Even when it changes direction, our patience is still ongoing. &gt;&gt; You saw it, oh man, when you wait for the Holy Ghost. Oh, I am the Lord, help me. Please help me. And you patiently waited. That was the end of it. No, God will just change the direction because he wants your patience to get to a certain level and he will not stop until you have arrived. It hit me Carol yesterday as I study him. Then Lord, we are still waiting. We are waiting patiently for what? For the morning between 7 and 9:00. I'm not sure if that's Central Standard Time. If that's New Zealand time, I really don't even care. All I know is I'm waiting patiently. Well, it's patience. I am waiting for the day. Hallelujah. When Brother Daniel Nun is going to walk into my house and there will be Brother Calvin Ward and there will be on and on and on and on. You talking about a meeting and a gathering time we're going to have and my patience will see me through. So don't throw away your patience because God doesn't answer the prayer the way you think &gt;&gt; he should have. Be not slothful. So I mean Christians can be slothful. &gt;&gt; How are they slothful? By not having faith and patience. still a Christian who through faith and patience inherit the promise. You see, these are qualities that are absolutely essential to the steadfastness of the people of God in the age that we live in. And many of those who inherited the promises that we have made, great heroes of faith, no doubt they were so weary and their faith, it was so strong, but without being coupled with patience, their strong, magnanimous faith would have run out. &gt;&gt; They believe God could still do it. Oh yes, God's great. God can do this. God can do all that. God can do that. That's wonderful. But without patience, a human being draws up and swivels and their blooms turn down. Oh my. Listen to what the prophet said about Noah. I love this statue of a perfect this perfect man because he gives us examples of these virtues. Noah had patience. Yeah. Noah had real godly patience. God said, "I'm going to destroy this world with rain." And Noah preached 13 seconds. &gt;&gt; How long? &gt;&gt; 120 years. Plenty of patience. He says, "Not even do fell from heaven. wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was 120 years. But he was patient. Brother, I'll tell you one thing. Faith is a great thing. Faith alone would have never carried Noah through. &gt;&gt; You got to keep believing. God, I don't know what's going on. I don't understand. Don't you see why we need this? faith will still believe him. But people with great faith that don't have patience can still not inherit the promises because we emphasize so much on faith. And patience is the quiet humble little sister. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't need faith. Oh, no, we don't need faith. We you know, we we got we got this and we got No, we need all of them. All of them makes us that complete Christian that is stable in God's promise even when he knocks the wind out of you. That's one thing when demons come by your way and they wind up their old fist and they hit you boy so hard and knock you down and you &gt;&gt; but it's totally different when Jesus does it. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. And he's standing there and looking at you when you're &gt;&gt; you can't even say help. &gt;&gt; But he's got confidence in you. &gt;&gt; And you get back up, &gt;&gt; wipe yourself off and say, "I'm going back to church. &gt;&gt; I'm going to church on Sunday morning." You get to trying to church on Sunday morning. This person didn't speak to you. Somebody had your favorite parking spot out here on the parking lot. Then you come inside church and somebody has your pew and you you're just really fighting the devil. I mean, you're going through pure hell time I get up here. Your parking spot's gone, your favorite pews gone, and beside that, somebody that you don't like come right in and sit down by you, and you saying, "How in the world can I ever get anything out of church, &gt;&gt; patience, &gt;&gt; sir?" Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying that to none of you good little darlings here. Boy, we have some rascals to stream these services, though. So, I'm no doubt a lot of that went for them. Now, notice he said just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years. But he was patient. You imagine laboring, building, sweating, people laughing, making fun of him, ridicule him. Noah said, "Boys, don't pay no attention to them. Go on in town. Get the nails. Get the pitch. Get this, that, and the other. Come on right back out. Say, "Hey." Hey, ain't you in that ark cult? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I hear that your daddy said, "God God spoke to him and told him to build an ark." Who ever heard of such a thing? Matter of fact, it's the first time that word was ever used in the Bible. So, it must have been a very strange object. I feel sorry for you poor boys because you were brought up in that cult. But we've got some pamphlets and some YouTube videos that will help liberate you all from that art cult. Imagine the daughter-in-laws go to town to buy food and this and that. He said, "You poor things. Won't Noah let y'all even trim your dead ends." Well, look here. Here's a fine mascara place and here's a a this and that and this. You poor saints. We feel so sorry for you. And they were humans like you. Can you imagine them coming back and telling their husbands, "They're calling us a cult. They say we're following a man." &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; They were, but it just so happened to be the right man. &gt;&gt; You imagine Noah going to town going to get his building permit. So he goes through this red tape, that red tape, that red tape. I was like, "Okay, sir." So next, next Noah. Noah something. No. Who's Noah? Who's Noah? It's me. It's me. So Noah comes in said, "And and what is it that you're want to build, sir?" &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You said chicken coop. And ain't no chicken coop. What? What? Explain it. Well, it's 75 ft tall and 300 ft long. It's, you know, that three stories. I said, Lord have mercy, son. What are you building? We ain't never seen nothing like this. He said, cuz ain't never been nothing like it. Ain't never been nothing like it. Well, we'll definitely have to go before the board and see. I mean, what what about the wiring? What about the plumbing? What about the residency? How many is in your family? Well, I I make them the bedrooms that that God Oh, you mean you hear voices? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have an adjoining building over here on the right for people who hear voices. I'm glad I can still hear his voice. &gt;&gt; Aren't you, &gt;&gt; friends? We look at and say, "Oh, oh, we go through so much stuff." Really? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what this man and his family must have went through? And how the devil tried to get among them? And how many did he have? 350,000, a million followers, 700,000, 40,000. Now that would definitely have the appearance of a cult. If you look up the meaning of cult and Mariam and Webster cycle Britannica, different ones, you'll find out the meaning they designate to it would definitely describe Noah &gt;&gt; and Moses and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Jesus and Peter and James and John and Paul and definitely us. So, as long as my life is patterned that, I'm good with Mariam. &gt;&gt; I'm good. Aren't you? So, he didn't just have faith, but he had patience. &gt;&gt; Patience. And I said, "No, I want you to go ahead and get in the ark cuz I'm going to run the animals in there." Okay. So, now he completes it and God tells him, "Y'all go on in." He said, "Okay. All right. Praise the Lord." Here it here it comes. Here it comes. So we said, "Lord, how do I communicate with the animals?" So me and my boys go out and we get a pair of this and a pair of this. I've got it all took care of. I will divinely speak to everyone who's supposed to be on the boat. I believe he's still doing the same thing of the day now we're living in. Well, praise be to God. Can you all imagine an old box turtle, him and his misses? Come on, honey. You're taking forever. So, here they go. Well, they had to give them a two-eek notice before everybody else. Hallelujah. Come on, honey. I'm getting wore out. What in the world are you doing? Here they go. Here they go. But the art can't leave without the box turtle. Oh, I'm so glad that God had a box turtle because well, I feel like we got some Christians like that in our church. The giraffe is already in the boat. The elephant's already been in the boat. The racehorse is already in the boat. Way in the back is the box turtle. But we ain't going without the box turtle. No, I'm not leaving you here. No, I'm not giving up on you. No, I am not. I am not. &gt;&gt; And don't you give up on me either. &gt;&gt; Imagine every 45 minutes you say, I'm more out. Are you said Lord have mercy? This is killing me. Said, "Can we stop a bit?" Said, "Yeah, let's just take a breather." So they'd hang out. Hang out. Here go the kangaroo. Just There goes the ostrich. Said, "Y'all be careful now." But you ain't gone without us. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when Noah, they finally approved his building permit. I said, "Now before you can actually move in and us give you a certificate of occupancy, what do you have planned in this anyway?" Well, it's really hard to explain. It's like, well, to be honest with you, I don't understand it all myself, but from the best I understand, the heavens is going to break loose and the fountains of the deep are also going to break loose, too. &gt;&gt; And then they're all going to come up. And then the stuff called rain. Remember that word had never been used before. &gt;&gt; Rain. What is rain? Well, the best I understand is something about moisture and clouds. What's a cloud? We've never had clouts. &gt;&gt; Imagine manoy. Believe them poor people. &gt;&gt; I feel so sorry for them. They're following a man that says he talks to God and lights and rain and pillars of fire. And you imagine when he go down the street and needed some more 20 penny nails to finish it up. I said, "Look at it." Here it comes. How you doing? Doing good. How y'all doing? Doing pretty good. So that's good cuz it won't be lasting much longer for you. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm telling you, unless you get in the ark, you're going to die. So you know what some of them people done? They started building their own arcs. &gt;&gt; So the prophets said they built their own. So they said, "Hey, you know what? This there might be something to this." So they started building their own, but it wasn't God constructed. &gt;&gt; So they mimicked Christianity with a much easier way. Now you can come in our ark and do anything you want to do. This is grace ark. This is community ark. This is mercy ark. This is And boy, they go to naming them arcs everywhere. So if it started out with one, now you got them on every corner, &gt;&gt; churches. &gt;&gt; Now notice how the prophet dramatizes this. Now I want to tell these people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place. Go down there and tell them what was the first sign Noah got in the ark. Wasn't no rain. Noah laid the first day. No rain. It's going to happen. I hear Miss Noah coming at us and say, "Dad, are you sure?" That was bad enough when them people out there laughed at him. But when his wife, those close to you, a dad, you know, I love you. I've cooked you many a meal and washed your clothes and bore your children, but maybe maybe you need to look at this. I mean, because we've searched the archives and we cannot find a newspaper or article anywhere that says so many people died and fell off that bridge. &gt;&gt; I mean, y'all just need to face the facts, which are &gt;&gt; Let's look at some facts. &gt;&gt; Moses was a man killer. Facts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Truth was still God's prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jonah was a backsliding prophet, &gt;&gt; but he was still God's prophet. Let's take facts and faith and truth. I don't mind doing it a lot. As a matter of fact, we could start from the book of Genesis and run it right on down and realize God has always used failing human beings to do his great accomplishment on the earth. And he will bring the finale with the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can hear Mrs. Noah coming around and said, "Dad, are you sure? Don't talk like that. He had patience cuz he had faith." Yes, sir. He had virtue. He had knowledge that God was right. He had temperance. He didn't find loose and say, "Well, I don't know what's all about. I lost my popularity out there. No, no, people don't don't care for me no more. I'll go out there and start over again." He had patience. God promised God will do it. &gt;&gt; And Word of Life Church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; I can see a son come around and say, "Dad," stroking his hand over his long gray hair. You know, he was hundreds of years old. Wow. Hundreds of years old. his son come to him now, daddy. Daddy, look, we love you, but don't you think maybe maybe that wasn't God? Maybe it wasn't God. You went through the prayer line and be be honest. You're worse. You're worse. You feel worse. Maybe you just need to accept the fact that you're not going to get healed. That it's not God's will and this and that and the other. Boy, it's one thing if a sinner tells you that if it's your wife, your husband, somebody you go to church with. I wish somebody would hear me preach today. Hallelujah. Oh my. I know you're an old patriarch and I I love you, daddy. Woo. How many's ever been told that before? Maybe not call daddy, but call best friend or I love you, brother. I'm just concerned about you. I'm just concerned you're you're going to that church over there and I've heard the office bunch of stuff that ever was. Well, my advice to you would be come and see. Come and see. Don't take this person's word or another person's word, but come and see and experience the living God. Oh, but I love you, Daddy. Oh, could it have been possible that you would have been a little bit? Now watch how it starts. Never great big. No. Is there some way you was just a little little tiny bit wrong? [Music] Oh no. No. Why? God says so. &gt;&gt; Well, daddy, this is six days that we've set up here. You imagine them thousands times thousands of people sitting on the outside. Hey, Noah, I thought you said it was going to rain six days ago. What in the world are y'all doing? Y'all better get out of there. What if that thing catch us on fire? Now, we've got the CO2 meter out here, and there's no way you're going to be able to live because all the things going on inside that arc, all them animals, y'all better run while you can. You better leave. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; oh my pitched inside and out. We've been all these years building on it. And you stood out there and preached till you turned gray and bald. I hope to the mercy of the Lord I fulfill that first part but not the last one. And here you are up here now trying to say such and such and the people are laughing throwing rotten tomatoes. Look what you've been doing. Be patient, son. Be patient, son. Are you sure? You need to hear him say this now. And the way that he says it, he says it with such a strong, adamant voice. It will rain. His daughter-in-law said, "Father, it will rain, but you've been all these years waiting. We've been preparing and you told us it was going to rain a week ago and we're in here and the doors are all shut and here we all walking around in here and the sun scorching right down but it will rain. Isn't it amazing that God tried his patience in building it? tried his patience in the animals. And then once they get sealed in, &gt;&gt; they're sealed in and now they're waiting for the finale of what? Patience to finally mature in the final stage. &gt;&gt; Now, what if he didn't let his patience go and he walked in the door? All right, now it's 15 minutes. We'll give God 15 minutes. If it don't 15 minutes, we're dismissing this church. We're selling it all. We're leaving the property. We're all leaving the message. What are you talking about leaving the message? All the scriptures that talk of this message, all the scriptures that are in this message, when people say they're leaving the message, I mean they're leaving the new birth, too. &gt;&gt; They're leaving water baptism, they're leaving grace, they're leaving mercy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, but he had patience. Now, when you get that way, add it. But if you ain't got it that way, don't try to add it. It won't work. &gt;&gt; It won't work on healing. It won't work on nothing else. It's got to blend in with the same material. It's vulcanized, too. That's right. You've got to add it. Patience with God's promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Noah believed it and he had patience with God 120 years. I want every person in this building that has been asking God for a certain thing and waiting on God, every person visibly and every person that'll ever hear this recording. I want you to stand to your feet right now. If you've been waiting as long as Noah, &gt;&gt; send me your photo. &gt;&gt; If you're going to email us, I want somebody to say it and say, "I've been waiting for 120 years." There might be some that'll do it, but we know And you will give up after five. &gt;&gt; You will give up after three. You will give up after four years and say, "Well, God ain't going to do it." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; The Bible here speaking of Abraham, our father. Hebrews 6:15. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. I'm convinced, friends, the problem with many of us of us is not a lack of faith. It's a lack of patience. patience toward God and patience toward one another. &gt;&gt; Many of you may have great patience when it comes to God, but when it comes to dealing with your fellow man &gt;&gt; or your fellow church member &gt;&gt; or them sorry outfits you work with on your job, even if they are your nephews or your uncles or whoever they are. Hebrews 10:36, "For ye have need of patience, that after you have done the will of God, you might receive." But, Brother Donnie, I prayed for my daughter. I prayed for my son. He's getting worse. I come through the prayer line. I held a prayer closet in my hand, and wouldn't you know it, after they got prayed for, they've done worse and worse. But you have need of patience, my brother. You have need of patience, my sisters, that after, notice, you have need of patience after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise. Look at the order of events that happens many times with a believer. So you had need a patient. Well, faith is enough, isn't it? No. No. Oh my. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Moses had patience with God. Yes, sir. Moses said, "I've heard the cry of my people and I've seen the afflictions. I'm coming down to deliver them. I'm going to send you down." A little contrast there between him and God. God showed him his glory and he said, "Here I go." Well, once he seen the glory of God, he had faith. He got down there and the first thing the contrast come out there and said, "The Lord God said, let my people go." And Pharaoh, I want you to know this. I've come as a representative of God and you must obey me. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh said, "Obey. Do you know who I am? I am Pharaoh. obey you a slave. You see the pharaoh you may be dealing with may be a besetting sin. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or it could be a sickness or a disease. Could be a temper. Could be this that and the other. And it will try to speak to you with an authoritative voice. I am your master. Your grandpa was this way. Your daddy was this way. your uncles was this way. It runs in your family, but you need to turn right back around and say, "But I am a son or a daughter of God." &gt;&gt; Pharaoh said, "Obey. Do you know who I am? I'm Pharaoh. Obey you a slave." He said, "You'll obey me or perish. You'll do either one you want to do." And the church said, &gt;&gt; I'm totally convinced, friends, I know you've heard me say it a lot and I'll keep on saying it. If people's going to do what they want to do, if people want to live just a watershed Christian life, that's all they're going to do. The roots is going to be right on the top of the ground. They go by feelings, they go by emotions, they go by pulsation, they go by impressions of things. I feel led to do this, feel led to do that. Has no substantial root growth if they take it right back to the word. And they're constantly up and down, up and down. But I don't care how many there are like that. God's got people around the world that have been planted in Christ Jesus the word. They love feelings, but they don't let feelings lead them. They can be impressed, but they don't let impressions lead them if they're contrary to the word. Come on, somebody say, "Amen." God wants you and I to be the type of Christian that we can be watered deep. And when trouble comes, we say, "You ain't moving me sickness. You ain't moving me devil. You ain't moving me pain. You ain't moving me anxiety. And you ain't moving me self-pity. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, we know when Moses got down there and he had these supernatural signs which have no record in the scripture that ever been done before. And Moses thinks he's one of a kind. So he'd done some signs and God said, "Now pick up that stick. Throw it down. Pick it up." And he said, "Praise God. I'll tell you one thing, boy. Here I go." He gets down there in Janice and Chambers is in the court of Egypt. Right there they are in Pharaoh's palace. So Moses throws down his eye. How you like that, big boy? So Pharaoh said, "Hey Janice, you and Jamus, come here." So they go, &gt;&gt; Moses said, "Lord, I thought I was the only one that could do that." Well, between me and you, I didn't tell you that. You just thought that in your own mind cuz you thought you were so special. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; So them snakes go to crawling around. Oh my goodness. You imagine right there and they all jumping back. They go to crawl around. In a minute, you know what happened? Moses snake went over and swallowed theirs up. You know where that snake was? It wound up being in that rod. My hallelujah. Moses conquered the Red Sea. Moses conquered all the rest of it with them serpents inside that rod. Death was swallowed up in victory. Hallelujah. It's the same with our Lord Jesus. He wants to take that thing that bothers you and swallow it up and let you overcome every day of your life. [Applause] When you've done exactly what he says do and it seems like it went wrong. Stand still. Be patient. Moses said, "You know, when I was laid on the foundation, there was patience laid on. I just wait and see what God will do." That old serpent crawling around blowing and hissing one at another. First thing you know, Moses serpent went gulp and gulped them all down. He had patience. I find this amazing that he attributed the gulping to patience instead of faith. Maybe that's the reason some of you ain't gulping your enemies. &gt;&gt; You think cuz you've got such great faith. Praise God. I can call God down. I can do this with my faith. My faith. But have you got patience? Have you got patience with your faith that you can say, "Well, I'll wait. I'll just wait and see what God will do." Well, how long have I got to wait? However long it takes. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's jump down here to the Hebrew children. The Hebrew children had patience. Sure they did. God had promised them and told them, "Won't you bow to no image?" But they had patience. Our God's able. Nevertheless, we're not going to battle your image. See patience knowing this that God would raise him up in the last days. They started walking up the ramp. One looked to the other. We got patience. One step, God wasn't there. &gt;&gt; Two steps, he wasn't there. Three steps, four steps, five steps, just kept going. He wasn't there. &gt;&gt; Anybody feel like that? &gt;&gt; Well, you take one and another and you know at the first step, well, he's going to be right there by you and you take it. Where are you, Lord? &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, that makes me nervous. &gt;&gt; That tears me up. Shows I need more patience. &gt;&gt; And it shows you do, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh my. Five steps just kept going. Sydney wasn't there. stepped right off into the fiery furnace. They had patience, but he was there. &gt;&gt; Which would have been the greater miracle? Step one or the furnace? Step two or the furnace? Step three, step four. Step five, which was the greater miracle? You tell me. Was step three. &gt;&gt; Step four, step five. Where was the greater miracle? &gt;&gt; The furnace. &gt;&gt; The furnace. Don't you see what he wants sometimes out of our lives? He wants furnace message believers. &gt;&gt; It's evident. We've got step one message believer, step two, step three, step four, step five. But God wants furnace message believers. You imagine that fire being so hot the closer they got. They were sweating way worse than I am this morning. Sweat running down their face, running down their backs. They stood there and they could feel the heat and their skin, their flesh, feeling it and the singing of the hair on their arms and their hands. And them men who threw them in, it killed them. And they're thinking, "Lord God, where are you? Where are you?" But we still believe you. We still believe you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People think, children, that when somebody's fighting a terminal disease and God doesn't heal them, think, well, they lost the battle to cancer. That is a lie from the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; If they are a believer, they never lost that battle. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By their faith and patience, they brought out a manifestation of the almighty God that had not been before and has never been since by three Hebrew boys. &gt;&gt; Now, let me close. What about three Kentucky boys or Tennessee boys or Virginia boys or North Carolina girls or South Carolina we'll even give a little grace and say Illinois bunch of Yankees even Canadians. Hallelujah. We say, "Oh, if I could only been them Hebrew boys." Let me tell you something. Some of you have been through more than they've been through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they went through one trial in their life. One trial like this. And they overcome and have been preached for thousands of years. &gt;&gt; You live in the middle of hell. &gt;&gt; Satan's eaten. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you live one day without your thoughts being violated by Satan? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Do you have a fivehour period in a day where there's nothing but total peace in your mind? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're living right in the middle of hell. &gt;&gt; You've heard me say it for years. Eve lived in a perfect paradise and could not live right. And yeah, sure you are in the middle of hell. &gt;&gt; Satan's eating. Remember when the prophet was sitting there JC Penney store at that mall and many of you have been there and he said them women going up that escalator speaking Spanish and different languages and he said there I was back in hell again and you live in it every day of your life. It ain't no wonder you don't you can't pray. Oh my. Brother Fred had sent me a quote the other day where brother Random asked him a question. Brother Brandon, why can't as believers and followers of the message, why can't we pray and have revival and feel like we want to feel? He said, "Well, my brother, sister, the revival is over. I believe that for the nation. &gt;&gt; I believe that globally, but I don't believe it's over for an individual. &gt;&gt; Cuz the prophet goes on to tell us sometime thereafter, you never let revival die inside of you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We don't want to come in here and sit down and say, "Well, we can't have a move of God cuz the prophet of God said revival's dead." It is dead for the world. It is dead for the denominational system, but it should not be dead between the bride and her husband. She ought to have more passion, more love, more desire for him than she's ever had in her life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God bless you in the stand. Praise the Lord. Don't you love him with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. We'll start a prayer line here this morning. Everybody come over on this side here. Who needs patience? Well, that'll be a quick one, won't it? But don't you worry about getting tired. There won't be nobody to come through it. God, I pray you give them trouble. God, stir their marriage. God, cause family problems. After the first prayer, everybody say, I feel led to not go through. &gt;&gt; But the Lord knows us well enough to know most of us would never ask for such things. So he's going to send it to us anyway. &gt;&gt; But don't worry, he won't overwhelm you yet would be needless from dissensious such trials that would be opposite to the desired purpose of what he wants. Not to destroy you, but to help you. I know you're like me. I've been through so many things in life, and in the middle of it, I think, I'm not sure I'll ever survive this. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure I'll come true. Now, I'm going to share something with you that may seem very, very strange and unusual to you. I have never, since I've been a Christian, never one time ever wanted to go back on God. Never. Not one time. I have never contemplated backsliding, going back on the Lord. Never have. Quit being a pastor. Quit being a preacher &gt;&gt; streaming on the internet every day. &gt;&gt; Turn them streamers off and we never stream one more service. I get these emails and texts and letters from moms and dads church. [Applause] Patience. Patience. &gt;&gt; Patience. &gt;&gt; Patience. &gt;&gt; Patience with the pastor. &gt;&gt; Patience with the song. &gt;&gt; Patience with the singers. Patience with the deacons. &gt;&gt; Patience with the parents. When you deacons get on their children, they get mad. And the deacons said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. patience. The amazing thing of the matter is once you get it, you see Noah had arrived to the seal of the time of his life. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; When he was sealed in the ark and once he arrived at that sealing stage of patience, did God say, "Okay, you're good. You're good from this point on." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Uhuh. After he was sealed, then he entered into a deeper trial of his patience, a different type of trial &gt;&gt; than he had because before it been out there, &gt;&gt; but now once he gets sealed in, &gt;&gt; he's been tried by God in the most intimate personal way. &gt;&gt; The person could be tried, children, daughters, and it wasn't he needed more things. No, but now God is trying his sealed stage. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I see. That's what I'm looking for. That's what I'm looking for. When the bride around the world, it's all sealed in. And then God lets our seal stage of faith virt God. I've told Carol this for many, many years with all the funerals that I've had to preach through the years. Maybe this is the one I'm looking for. She said, I say last &gt;&gt; one day I'll preach my last year &gt;&gt; with prayer last prayer. &gt;&gt; But you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go preaching with all my heart as safely as I can &gt;&gt; until the last one arrives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many more trials and tests you're going to have. Keep in mind you're looking for that last &gt;&gt; one of these days that last will be conquered. &gt;&gt; The word can say around the world, &gt;&gt; it's over. &gt;&gt; She's ready. &gt;&gt; It's totally impossible for us to think about such a thing happening. Can you imagine getting a church of this size? All of us ready. Be ready and stay ready for restrictive fail. 30 seconds 30 seconds and we all stay ready living in this polluted world. We all stay clean, curbs, no anxiety, no anger, no stress, nothing. We're all just we stay ready for 30 seconds after God gets us to that ultimate place. Now multiply that by thousands of congregations around the world and God brings his bride all to that place. They're all there. They fall around and they stay ready for higher long. It seems like an impossibility. The probability of such high dealing with mortals not in horrified place in human. &gt;&gt; It will be his crowning achievement. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Of it will stir heaven to such a state of escalation. The sixth dimension will empty out. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And it will cause a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I believe we're near. &gt;&gt; We can't do that exactly. &gt;&gt; Only he &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he will? &gt;&gt; Yes. Are you going to have patience &gt;&gt; to wait for that? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Help me. &gt;&gt; Now, you see, if you have that patience now and you go to the way of the grave, don't worry. You will awake with that same anticipation. Cuz as you go down, you'll raise. You see, for those who died with terminal sickness and disease and they were looking for a new body, a well body, you understand when they were raised, that same faith they had will be encapsulated in that brand new body and they say, "Here it is. I've arrived." Because whenever they pass, they didn't lose their faith. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that faith will carry them right over. &gt;&gt; Your patience will carry you right over. Brother said it's not they go to sleep. And he said they will awake with that same anticipation. It's just like they took a little nap, but they say, "Praise God, I was looking for his coming 2,200 years ago." Well, hallelujah. Here it is. Just that quick. It'll be there. Peter will awake and he'll look around. Paul will awake and say, "Well, here it is, saints. Praise God. We've been napping. What's it been about 5 minutes since Paul has been around 2,000 years?" Really? You just felt like a little male and the dead in Christ should rise first. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, I pray that you'd help each of us today. Father, you know what we need. Would you move this incredible task? Dear father, I can't imagine some of these brothers here that are builders and they get plans and they look at the foundation, they look at this and that. I've seen brother Phil, these different ones. I I couldn't my goodness, I couldn't build nothing myself, but I see them and they take studies and they got the scale there of what it's what it is and they got the pictures of roof and this and that and the other. It looks like an incredible task to somebody. Then Lord, I take this promise of yours. Upon this rock, I will build my church and the gates of hell. I will prevail against it. That's your promise, Jesus. Lord, here we stand. And some of us have got sheep off. Some of us are still just barefest. Some of us have plumbed and maybe some of us have got wiring. But ain't none of us totally completely done yet. I figure we look around and we think, Lord, will it ever be? Yes, it will. Hallelujah. It was your desire to have a world full of sons and daughters of God. And you will have it, Lord God. For there is nothing you have ever desired that has not been yours. Help us today, Jesus. I pray for the weary, the oppressed, the sick. Lord, for those that feel like they can't go any farther, and I didn't get to it here today, but I've got the quote here before me where the prophet said, "Brother Brandham, I can't wait. What can I do? I I can't go any further." He said, "Just keep on going." Said, "But brother Brandham, I can't go any further. What can I do?" Repeats himself. just keep on going. So, it's quite simple, but yet so profound. So, maybe they're at what they feel like a standill in their life. They aren't growing. They aren't in that stage and think, "Lord, what what's going on with me?" Carol and I have noticed this corn field that's right down below the church here. It's on our way. And I've passed it. My goodness, I don't know how many days in the last two months I've been over here at the church doing this and that and the other. Sometimes four and five trips a day watering these baby Christian hydrangeas out here. And I've passed that corn. I told her, I said, "It looks like to me that stuff is growing every day." We passed it coming to church and she said, "Look at it how tall it is, Lord." She said, "Let us grow." And I was like, "Yeah, that's what we want to do." It's got big old ears of corn on it. Now the toss up on the top, but before we know it, the growing cycle will stop and that it'll stand there and dry and dry and dry and that farmer will come for the harvest. The growing will cease. Help us, Lord Jesus, till we can grow and grow and grow. And then once we're sealed in and the virtues is there and we're there at that final stage just for a little while in the drying time, we lay in the presence of the sun and all the greenness be baked out of us. Grant it. Lord God, would you do me a favor? Would you lay your hand over on the person standing by you? If it's a brother standing by, sister, not your wife, you don't feel comfortable doing so, just move around if you'd like to. Let's just offer a word of prayer. You never know friends what people come to church with the burdens, the sorrows, the despair, the anguish. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, as we have our hands laid one upon the other today, Father, I believe you're mindful, Lord. Dear God, we're not praying for each other, but we're we're praying for ourel rather, but we're praying for each other. Maybe it's a brother with a burden. Maybe a brother with a besetting sin, a sister with a a terrible home life. Lord Jesus, you know, and I believe you're mindful, Father, at the end of our special meeting here and Carol and I left the fellowship hall and we were going to go home. And as we walked into the sanctuary here, Lord, we saw a sister from another place sitting here with the lights off. And I turned the lights on so we could see our way through. And we saw the sister sitting here crying. So Carol, I said, "Should we go maybe go speak to her?" So we walked over to where she was and I said, "Sister, can we help you? you you got you got something going on. Hallelujah. She said, "Brother Donnie, I was just sitting here praying that the Lord would send you my way." Oh Jesus, I believe that you're just as mindful right now. Father, these people don't need me, though. Lord, they need you. I can't heal them. I can't help them. I'd do anything I could. You know I would. I'd talk to them. I'd pray for them. But Lord, their battles are greater than me. They're greater than any preacher. Bring healing. Bring joy. Bring peace. Father, some need the Holy Ghost. May they be filled right now in your presence, Lord Jesus. We worship you, Lord. as we sing the song, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Some can't wait till Wednesday night. Maybe they cannot wait for this touch that they need from you. They need it today. Lord, I pray for our brother Steve Newsome. Jesus, may your healing virtue go to our brother today, Lord. Dear God, you know the burdens on my heart for different ones that are sick and afflicted in the name of Jesus. Oh Lord, they're fighting for their very life. May the healing hand of God go toward them, Lord. Jesus, we need you right now, Father. Oh, hallelujah. Let us raise our hands, can we? In the presence of the Lord. Now, I want you to just think about what you need. You prayed for that brother, that sister. Thank you for doing that. You might not understand it, but God God feels for us when we do that. As a matter of fact, there's several discernments where brother Brandham would speak to an individual and the person wouldn't get getting it and a person standing by them would peck them on the shoulder or speak to him and he'd make brother Ben say something about it. God bless you sister for doing that. God bless you. And because you did that, you've got this and this and this and this. Now you imagine because they cared for that other individual and the spirit of God gave the prophet a word from them. Well, now you've prayed for those by you. What word do you need? Oh, brother Donna, do you have a word for me? I do. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he will give thee the desires of thine heart. In that day, I am the Father and the Father in me. I in you and you and me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing together just a little bit before we go, can we? You love him with all your hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want to please him? We don't want to just please him with our dress. We don't want to just please him with not cursing and all that sort of thing, but we want to please him in the building stones in our life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord, right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need healing. I I need to live with you. &gt;&gt; I need to let go of this resentment, this attitude that I have. Lord, I need you. Lift our hands and worship. Oh, we need you. I make it personal. I need you. I need you. I need you. I need you. I need you. I need you, Jesus. Thank you Jesus. My handship. Oh, I need you Lord. I need you Lord right now. Oh, we need you, Lord. We need you, Lord, right now. It's a trying time. We need you, Lord. We need it Lord right now. We lift our hand and worship at your throne. Oh, we need you, Lord. We need you, Lord, right now. [Music] Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now. Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord. I need you right now. I need you, Lord. I lift my hands. I will bow my knees and worship at your throne. Oh, I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord, right now, [Music] Jesus. I need you. I need you. We need you. [Music] [Applause] I need you. [Music] I need you. I need you, Jesus. I need you. [Music] We need you. We need you, Lord. We need you. Lord, the goodness of God. Let's sing together one more before we go, can we? Can you say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord today? Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Won't you turn around and shake hands with somebody? God bless you, brother, sister. Good to see you today in the house of the Lord. Amen. God bless you, saints. Love you so much. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this song here. For your mercy never fails me. &gt;&gt; And all my days, &gt;&gt; all my &gt;&gt; I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Music] All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so [Music] every breath that I [Music] see [Music] [Music] In darkest night, you were close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend and I have live in the goodness of God. [Music] [Applause] All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so Every [Applause] [Music] sing [Music] I see. [Music] It's running. Heat. Heat. Your goodness is running out. It's running out. You have been faithful. [Music] All my life you have been so so good. Every [Applause] goodness you have. I [Music] see the God. Oh my [Music]
