the man that feareth the Lord that delight us greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever unto the upright there arise if light in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous a good man showeth favor and Linda's he will guide his affairs with discretion surely he shall not be moved for ever they did good surely he will not be moved for ever let the devil say whatever he wants to say I don't really care this is what God's promises to us the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord a godly man let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you tonight we're so grateful Lord Jesus that these things we have just read they are not words that were just put in together until book fabricated by man's idea but we believe Lord God you were the one who gave these words and we believed that their promises not only to sons not only to men but to women as well for every child of God that desires for the word to be a living principle in their life may we take these things too now father may we be blessed by gathering together we think it's an honor a privilege that we can once again be in the house of God speak to us than that father from your word in Jesus name Amen god bless you Saints nice to see you again appreciates privilege to be in the presence of the Lord and your Brethren's want to be a fruitful man fruitful in the aspect not summits of just the sexual reproduction of your body having children having your bills paid and all of that but a spiritual fruition is to me even a more value than just the natural part God has always had poor people and there will always be poor people in the economy of God it does not mean that they're not fruitful people now if a person can be trusted with wealth and riches and all that sort of thing well I think that's about the discretion of the Almighty God instead of just our own choice if I want to be rich or I want to be wealthy but whenever God looks at riches it's by far more the riches of God are more than just money houses and lands and material things and God wants us as his children to be fruitful as men of God as servants of God whenever I say that I'm not just on that preachers but as sons of God God wants each of us to walk in the perspective call that God Himself ordained to speak we know that our experiences with God or even ordained by God himself you might hear of a man that prays a lot and I hear of another man that does this and walks in this certain spot you that blob wish I could be that way I wish I could have that well you know some of those things we can have and some of them we cannot the thing that we need to do is go to him who provides even those spiritual experiences and say Lord what can I handle maybe something like that maybe that man walked that close to you but maybe he fights so many Devils in order to get that I'd never be able to deal with the repercussion to get the blessing now if you think a person is able to walk in the spheres with God and walk in their heavenly places of God and not fight battles you've got another thought coming so whenever we're asking for something many times we're only asking for the side we see and there's another side that comes with that that you may not be able to bear and if God gave you that it would totally blow you away it would so burden you down and so worried you down so you know what God will keep that blessing from you because he knows the company and with that blessing will come a great trial that you will never be able to handle so sometimes when we ask God for things and God says no we ask God for things that we think would be our benefit and God doesn't give them he's actually saying no because it's for our good but yet in no matter whether we walk in the deep deep places were gone or whether you have to walk in a place that's not as deep they get in every position that we walk truly every one of asserted desire to be fruitful in that God called position now being in that the Lord Jesus desire his desire it brings glory to God for each of us to bring fruit out of our lives let's read if you will now Matthew chapter 13 verse 23 now godly man is going to be a fruitful man keep in mind also sisters as well he that received seed into the good ground is he that here is the word and now it's not enough just to listen to tapes it's not enough just to listen to your pastor preach you'll never be a fruit Bearer if you don't understand now notice is he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit now he that receives the seed into the good ground the difference is always the ground now a man can sow seed on this ground on that ground stony ground hard ground among the thorns but Jesus himself was the one who made the differentiation between the ground and saying that there was a certain type of ground that was good rent so if a man has good ground which is progestin ated earth to receive the seed in then the predestination of God also allocates to him or a certain element of understanding with the understanding coupled with the ability to receive see they're going to bring forth fruit there is no question about it bringing forth fruit some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty now this is not thirty percent or 60 percent and some hundred percent but it's a hundredfold sixty fold and thirty for the man bringing forth thirty fold is a hundred percent in his capability the woman bringing for thirty fold is a hundred percent and her capability but given to her and she will reproduce thirty fold that don't mean that she's a thirty percent Christian she's an absolute sold out daughter of God now God wants us then to be fruitful in that of course to know that fruit ties in with fruit of the Spirit it also ties in with the manifestation of the Living Word for the hour that you live in now watch Jesus in Luke 8:15 but on the good ground again the same parable or they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit now wants fruit with patience so fruit with patience so here the fruit now is coupled not only with the predestinated life that will force it out but here in this part of the way Luke writes it it is also coupled with patience which tells you and I that sometimes that fruit might be a long time coming it might take a lot longer than what we even want it to be but if we have patience it will bring forth the fruit of God what Justin st. John 15:2 every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away speaking of the father the husband at every branch that beareth fruit he purchase it that it may bring forth more fruit now watch this this is Jesus giving the principle of bringing forth through every child of God this should be our desire to bring forth fruit unto the Lord is this what you want we want through to the spirit we want to through the message of the hour we want all the manifestation of God that God will allow us to have in our lives is all right now watch then if we bring forth through with the bringing of the fruit will come purging why because you found a fruitful branch and in order for that branch to remain to its full capacity that branch will have to be purged cut that this caught off of it that's how you mean you don't leave it alone and just let it go and go and don't know if you're bringing forth fruit and you'll find yourself going through terrible times y'all rejoice and thank God because if you look and realize there's no sin in your life there's no punishment for something you've done wrong it means you're going through the purging cycle add to the bearing forth and apparently the Lord looked at you and saw an abundance of fruit out of your life and he said now it's a purging time but don't get all down in the mouth now and don't kind around singing the blues songs that keep your heart on the promise and know after the purging will come forth more fruit just tell the gardener drag out more bushels because I'm fixing to bring forth more joy I'm fixing to bring forth more peace more long-suffering Morgan goodness - god this person ain't gonna wipe me out it's going to take away from me anything this contrary to the nature of God notice in verse 3 you are cling to the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me now remember when we're talking about fruit fruit and the godliness has such a diversity because as the fruit of the Spirit is love joy meekness temperance all that but there is a fruit which comes forth in the manifestation of the word for the day that you're living with that will be bought couple of or Paul call rather fruit unto holiness so there's many different aspects of fruit but will a godly man a godly woman a godly boy god the girl will they bring forth the fruit of the Spirit lutely they will without without contest now if God gives a German man the Holy Ghost does God give him a German version of the Holy Ghost which will allow him to keep his German temperament his German nature his German whatever so as God gives an Iraqi the Holy Ghost says God give him an Iraqi version the Holy Ghost so when God gives us Tennesseans or kentuckians or Indiana's or Michigan's or whatever we are when God gives us only Ghost does he give us a state version the Holy Ghost does he given us an American version of the Holy Ghost or does God have one Holy Ghost and he gives the one to the to the Germans of the Swiss to the fans to the Indians sort of by Pakistanis whatever they are does all of this shooting at the same Holy Ghost how come we're still want to keep our American spirit after we get to Holy Ghost how come the Germans still want to keep their German ways and the fans and the Norwegians and make excuse why they're so ill-tempered and so mean if you're still grouchy I feel you claim you got to hold a ghost I hate to disappoint you but you never got to hold against if you're still me I love to ride your tongue you ain't got the Holy Ghost brother Don is back in town well the sheeples falling down now remember friends Jesus is the one who gives this principle we know of course it cannot be broken abide in me and you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself this is why it's totally impossible for kfs and us any of the scribes and the Pharisees to a brought forth the true fruit of the Spirit they impersonated it and they had nature given fruit but not the genuine through the sphere impossible there is no way a devil an absolute devil could bring forth more fruit of the Holy Ghost than a son or daughter of God dony making sense now watch in verse 5 I'm divining you're the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much I want to be a much Christian OMA for without me you can do nothing and the church said verse 8 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciple now we want to bring glory to God this is the way be good it's not by quoting the word it's not the hell where we memorize the dates and the events and the cities that brother Branham preached in order the places where Jesus preached that's not what glorifies God I long hand all that that's wonderful but bringing forth root out of our lives which only God can do the devil can tell you the places over there and preach is this the sign at the end time it was not so from the beginning I hear you him and all the devil knows exactly all of those dates the devil knows what day true day Jesus is born he knew it wasn't December the 25th the devil knows Christmas tree lights ain't got none though Jesus the devil knows away in a manger ain't nothing like people projected today he knows all of that he can quote all the facts he can call all those sort of things but yet that is not fruit notice in verse 16 you have not chosen me but I've chosen you I'll say glory to God you've not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain so you many don't come and go well I got the Holy Ghost today and then men I lost my temper day before us and I cuss like a sailor Oh Lord I got drunk on the Holy Ghost Sunday night little drunk a little bit of Jack Daniels on wings that are that ain't the Holy Ghost oh no I'm not saying no you don't get drunk you do but you still drinking the same brand all the time it's st. John 15:16 Bay in the name Jack Daniels it ain't old crow it's the old Eagle too flew back from eternity to kick you act abuse up into the mind of God hallelujah praise the Lord now watch Paul is he twisted or shake a little bit different way to miss it that way in Causton chapter 1 verse 9 for this cause way also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might want worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work Oh what kind of church would we be if we was this type of people been fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God and the Saint said now what let's look again at Galatians chapter 5 verse 22 and let's watch Paul as he gives now the the fruit not fruits but fruit of the Spirit the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law now there is now a nature given of every one of these things there is an impersonation for every one of those things that we believe in genuine speaking in tongues that we not we believe in the gifts prophesying all that but Satan can impersonate every one of those gifts as a matter of fact hardest time brother then tells us Satan can hand out then supernatural gifts by the and for not God Satan people who want to base their evidence of the holy ghost on the gifts are deceived people who want to base their evidence of the Holy Ghost on the impersonation of fruit of the Spirit are deceived the evidence of the Holy Ghost is a genuine face in the predestinated word for the isle that you live in which you cannot get on your own now let's look at this now Jim from the perspective will be looked at the last time we resume with this on I went out a couple weeks ago that brother might have been defending now and trying to pull away from those who believed that the mere impersonation for this fit was evidence of the Holy Ghost and then it's been taken and preached almost as if better men did not believe in the fruit of spirit at all as if though you didn't even need to further the spirit that actually was more spiritual if he was more mean now watch let's let's see word that people can get this idea you can't judge my speaking in tongues neither can you judge by the fruit of the Spirit it's a manifestation of the Word of God brought to light it's the light that doesn't the man that walks in the light Jesus Christ was not founded upon speaking in tongues though he did it he was not on through the spirit though he did you couldn't judge it that he believed and punctuated and God lived every one of the promise of that day through him that's the lie of the hour that's the evidence that Jesus truly was not a mean hateful contrary person y'all believe that Jesus watch this again Bakersfield what is the fruit of the Spirit love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness that right through the spirit many people rely on that now this is the fallacy this is the error when people try to rely on what seems like through the spirit he can impersonate that to the letter so there is true love and there is an impersonation there is true joy and there is an impersonation is true peace and there is an impersonation there is true long-suffering and there is an impersonation right I don't want the impersonation I want the real there is an impersonation speaking in tongues but I've got the rule and he's got the real there is an impersonation to a new verse but I got the real one there is an impersonation to being a Christian but I'm not an impersonator I'm a real one so if I'm a real Christian I've got real spigot and tongue I've got real honor that why can't I have real fruit of the Spirit I do and I will if I'm a Christian now what's this then Jesus came to call so they said well through the spirit that's what it is oh no not further the spirit Christian science has that well said brother Danny uh-oh Christian science has that that what you mean they had the true further spirit of Galatians 5 which can only be brought forth by someone that's come forth from the tree what's this now Kirsten sighs has that what I love is the fruit of the Spirit they have more love than anybody and deny the deity of Jesus Christ well it can't be perfect love because if it was perfectly they couldn't deny Jesus and it's deity but they do have love but it's that smothering honey Dewey Dewey coppiced oh it's at whoo-whee gooey Malaysia stuff where we just embrace all the gays and the homosexuals and you can do whatever you want to do and that's love I don't want all that hooey gooey the license is all right on a biscuit but it ain't good on a preacher molasses and honey's all right oh you're going to eat you're my brother don't give me no honey-coated sarin in you imagine trying to put honey on a two-edged sword all these preachers I go to sword together better not come on be honest it's good for spreading that soul denominational marjorine making everybody fat and sassy but brother God don't give me no butter knife God don't call his God Kolya and give him better knives and jam roll he gives on a sword he gives him the gospel that'll lay out and separate soul and spirit mama so what did his Christian Science people have and y'all know what Christian Science people believe y'all study at some time they believe Holy anything apostolic now and not they got more love than us as message people more or less than Jesus not y'all this clock now I can't imagine about quarter tail or a quarter after what it's going to be now watch him how he goes back now to the Pharisees them Pharisees some of them said well it's fruit of the Spirit I saw them Pharisees had more fruit of the Spirit what we call fruit of the Spirit oh oh then we could ever produce so now we've got a differentiation made to worry it's not calling by the further Spirit in Galatians 5:22 but by what we call through to the spirit so man that preaches horse amended preaches sharp a man the preachers right now where you live by this standard he has no love right but this is not the standard God's Word is the standard [Applause] my MA notice this again when their eyes are open then what did this guy do when he got attacked he turned over the many tables reference to Jesus of course beat the Mallo they're trying to keep a man from getting so wrought with God now River this is not actually facts brother branham is putting out a scenario of the way they would have viewed it Jesus was not trying to keep anybody from getting right with God but that's the way they did remember for his fruit of the Spirit was not an Old Testament teaching brother Bannon is painting a scenario in Reverse that furthest phil is not even told unto galatians 5:22 which is years I say the Lord Jesus come to their so the scribes knew nothing about it but he's setting up a scenario in Reverse he's going backwards to a teaching or for the spirit and said this is what the people would have thought about him in that day which is pretty much what to think about us today the same thing oh my what do you say about that God the old priest of yours they were a bunch of snakes another devil talked about through the spirit they had him big by long ways so you mean Devils has gotten more love than God has that Jesus was the very heart of God well this is getting sticky in it hmm what's this that's no evidence of the Holy Ghost you can't rely on that you came along the fruit of the Spirit because the further spirit is love and the Christian Science exercise more love than anybody I know of and it's strange though that he would use the word exercise we're not supposed to exercise love that's what you do the arms ain't it and your honor exercise we're not more fruit this we're not talking about excess or what is exercise manufacturing producing it psychologically they are exercising or manufacturing which leads to hypocrisy anybody seemed a like the rest of you hang on we'll get you through this tunnel no much he said they even denied Jesus Christ being divine I guess they would exercise more love than anybody knew and now listen close don't miss it when it comes to being fruits of the spirit time and gentle I guess there wasn't a war of those priests that would outshine Jesus Christ well maybe kissa should have been the gentle Lamb of God then he went to the temple padded ropes looked upon him with anger hand over the tables and run them out of the place my and the church said but how could what they have the true divine love and then just look at him and say he was nothing more than a man but we have so much love I'm not doing I'm not denied they don't have love I'm just a nine that they don't have the branch love because you can't have the brain love unless you're in the tree remember brother branham is not giving scriptural definitions of the Firdous fear he's giving a definition in the way people view it and this is the way they do it so in their eyes if Jesus would come in today if the Lord Jesus would come in today and visit the churches in Johnson City Kingsport and Bristol ours included and Jesus would preach what they needed they had had him out of there in ten minutes I hope we wouldn't a lot of Jesus start with the preachers and I mean shall come down imagine something Prichard run shorts to church and doing this and and some of the women dress like I don't know what and you think Jesus winter and surrounds his holy speech my he'd rip and tear like I don't know what what they weren't inviting back don't be no invitation coming back and they would think the same thing now look at them it's just crazy got him in our pulpit he blasted the pastor he blasted the trustee board we're not having him back that's exactly the same scenario that the Prophet is saying oh ma notice this in church order Jesus was good-natured too but when it come down to say things it's written he said in my father's house is the house of prayer and you're making her dinner thieves he knowed when to speak and when not to that's right now he says he's answering a question about the Deacons having people to behave in the house of God now this is what the advancer is to this question how far should we as deacons go to make people behave in the house of God this is his answer now listen this talk about being a deacon in the church he took over he planted some ropes together did wait to gently walk to now he beat them out at the house of God he was playing the part of the deacon the listen Deacon brothers don't none y'all bring no chords to church anybody go hoof on my sheeps gonna be me notice this was fitting for that hour but this is this whatever deacons supposed to do no there is no command from their own down where any apostle no profit no new testament prophet ever beat anybody else out but that was the word for that hour if it was needed today I'd be right in the middle of it I'd be a plant Roper buddy I mean I'd know how to plant them and I'd know how to learn cuz I want to be illuminated by the light of this hour but you know what now we do it by the word instead of picking up a rock Harry you got tell you one thing man Bam Bam my if I don't have to some of you they wouldn't be enough to bury sorry it's some of you all the wars you pray or you read your Bible that one me enough to put a shoebox oh my god but today we take the Word of God did when we get done with it we pour the oil in the wild back in the wounds to bring me back to fellowship with God my watch brother enemy says he was playing the part of the Deacon for an example to you deacons he was your example now written my father's house is a house of prayer never remember Jesus was a deacon there you know that Jesus was taken the part of the Deacon when he come to the part of the pastor what he said you blind Pharisees look lamotte's leaders of the blind see was taking the part of a pastor now watch the question answers see those priests were gentle and meek and understanding men but is that the only side of those priests are we talking about the same ones that lied about Jesus are we talking about the same ones who lied about Stephen are we talking about the same ones who broke the order of even meeting of the Sanhedrin on the nighttime and without all the Sanhedrin being there and they put judgment on Jesus and they brought one law after another after another they would not even go into pilots house being a Gentile because they did not want to be defiled and they lied like dogs they lied they absolutely all kinds of things against Jesus where they truly gentle they were not they were perceived gentle they were perceived to meek they were perceived humble but they were serpents that's right MA notice instance he says when he come to further the spirit they could show more fruits of the spirit than Jesus ever could truths true fruited nature given your personai shion's praise God y'all seemed a lot good sketch of a perfect man I want to say this there are some people have a portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so forth that don't even profess to be Christians haven't you missed some people that were just so nice and you found out that when he was saved and they were nicer than some people got a chance me my time in the NASA on your wife I mean your husband or son your kids what nature gave them that temperament that's are so nice so easy to get along with and then some questions were given a horrible human temperament Babur's natural verse and they deal with any deal and you're some sinners and the son is born under the genetic code they receive become the nature of one behind and they're just inferred so good until you cross them of course now watch I explains this on the set of a program every member is to bill in the virtues now what you're going to do is build the virtues which will be inborn by the Spirit of God and then he's going to put another pyramid on the other side and show that there can be one right over here bite they can be nature given you talking about a deceiver and a deceived person you imagine if a person had all of these virtues by Nature they can have faith and love virtue knowledge temperance nature by nature and then maybe have some person want to look as a man what our Christian Wow what a Christian there no more Christian than the man who's got the office temper that ever was unless his spirit given that's what God recognizes now what I license is he said that don't even professor be Christian now we're just teaching center school that's true there's some people who have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christians but that don't like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself I've got a couple of black birds mounted in my house and I've got a beautiful blue India peacock he has all kinds of iridescent colors blues greens oculus and a craning on how the light hits him when you stand and you stay and look at him this way you see certain colors that stand over here and see certain colors in his manner Dory's stands up on a pedestal thing that I made and his tail hangs way way down his big old tales about this long now the end of his tail has all these beautiful iridescent blues and greens and blacks now what makes human and give him the ability to make is that he will stand and take those feathers and spread himself out and shake and it produces an illumination that the females will look at him and it's like it mesmerizes them in his attention and according to the colors and the spraying or all of that that's what very basically gives him the ability to reproduce himself and you imagine if I go home tonight and that that tail actually comes off it hooks a taxidermist made a word would come off so if I would go home and unhook that and I would take him over and put him on that old crow the brother Tim Pruitt sent me about Old Crow there's two of them there's one kind of mounted apart this and there's another set and they're mounted over a dead armadillo and they're picking at that dead arm Adela now you imagine how fitting it would be to put that beautiful aqua blue and green and all that oma on top of that Old Crow oh it's going to weighed him down it's going to slow him down he will be never able to eat near as much a carrot as he did before he's going to look firmer ugly he ain't going to look naturally able to be a crow Nora peacock he's a big ho I saw a lot of message folks are though they don't really belong in the world and they don't really belong here and she glad you fail where you belong Oh hallelujah I don't feel at home in this world I wouldn't make a good badness I'll make a terrible Methodist I'm making an awful Catholic I'm like a horrible presbyterian I would not measure you to tell you I would not make a good crease in science colorful but I'll make a wonderful message believer oh I would be all full of the Catholic priests I would be awful absolutist apparently but I'll make a wonderful fire that time holy ghost still a northern man a God to preach the message of the life's time [Applause] and all my feathers are groomed they're not stuck in so you see I can shout and dance and not wear the whole didn't my feathers are grown first of all but could you imagine an Old Crow Center said and a female peacock get him but she goes answered him here she comes and she walks over there she don't believe her ass here is this jet black crow but he's a cool crow because he found this peacock feather and he staggered up behind his ear like this he's a cool dude man I mean that aqua green and that blue and my he thinks he is something you imagine her going on say what in the world's a matter with you you ain't my mate let me just tell the devil you ain't my mate you trick me into that first marriage but my soul mate was aware of Jesus Christ anybody just God go on aside nature given love nature given Satan nature give and meekness he wants it to be virtue born my love em said is that a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings - making a peacock he only disgraces himself you better to stay a black bird when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian you just simply don't have a place like a sycamore tree kind of manufacturer apples couldn't do it although it's a tree with a cave manufacturer evel's what you mean by steaming same she cares over the same thought patience and so forth now there's a mockery of our pretending to be a nature given face by nature yet uh said some people have the natural ability to believe in God and yet they're not a part of God and they can receive and print many of the denominational people they're able to tap into the blessings into the financial thing and they'll break into certain suppose in there and they'll remember they'll run that thing dry and some of you said around in psyche can understand it and they get all the gravy and use it the blue John what they have a nature given faith thank your principal priests they turn the TV on us a message preacher on their ISM nothing from nothing leaves nothing so if you want to receive you got to sow a seed wonder well that's always one-sided when why they always already saw it their way but some people are doing this a man that's like that's what the word death and that natural given cytosol $20 and then they'll get that more that it's all praise God it works and they live like a devil Wow nature given face Lord Jesus a nature given faith a nature given virtue a nature given temperance this is a absolute paradox to me there's some people that even Christians got better control over their temper than some children of God but you know what these nature given people still need to be born again because they're still awesome you may look at them some Meno sucker be like that I don't know if I don't want to be or not I think I'd almost rather be the other guy at least I'll be able to acknowledge I've got a need because that nature given God he's got so much of this and so much so that he's a pretty good fella all children let me take some parents emphasize this to your kids many of our kids have got a nature given faith they've got a nature given conception the message they've got many of these nature given things and then when they run up and then they go into school and high school and college and then all this nature given sub gives way to the peer pressure lead on the Christ lead them to a new birth or see my kids a good kid that ain't enough they gotta be born again they gotta have the Holy Ghost that nature given thing will buckle under peer pressure oh ma I want to listen to this they say absolutely amazing and here do you say this is evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing his word always been in every age you can receive the word those priests had Jesus beat a million Mouse when it come to fruits of the spirit gentle peaceful meek lowly he tore up churches kicked him over told the people out called them snakes in the grass and everything that those men have more genuine furs a million miles than Jesus no this is from the perception of where he's projecting this you know Sandra's this is you got to be in the view where he's at or if you take this out you're missing apply what he said there's no way Devils can have more of the fruit of the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost himself but to wait people look at it oh praise be to God but you know what I find amazing when I go to study on something what I want to do is to be able to study that thing as thorough as I can in my limited ability so that I don't take 3 or 4 quotes or even four or five or five or six pages and make them quotes honor to a preconceived thought that I have or an agenda that I have I want to make sure the one I'm looking at balances itself for a false balance is an abomination the eyes of the Lord but a just weight is his delight so said Solomon The Book of Proverbs so when you go to study and anything you want to make sure that you're balancing yourself out praise the Lord now is anybody ask you about water baptism and you gave them the scripture Matthew 28:19 are you giving them a fair and balanced answer you are not you're giving them one scripture even without the understanding if they ask you about what a baptism and you say well ask you sir don't pay no tension that Matthew 28:19 you still don't understand it either a man when I first was being charged someone trying to talk to me years and years ago about then baptized the name of the Lord Jesus and this person might they knew us baptize in titles and this person kept trying though I'd rather I'd love to ask y'all do what you're going to be what Peter said and you know whether Jesus well don't know where that tell you know what I realized I'll tell you that individual that man did not have an understanding himself but you know how was led to what about his own the name of the Lord Jesus when a man was able to take Matthew 28:19 and preach acts 2:38 out of that then out so this man knows what he's talking about then he wasn't and I missed no don't read that no you can't believe that but out of that very defense come the offense revealed oh God out of that very same unfolded actions are you listen now let's look at some other things that the same Prophet said about fruit of the Spirit the Lamb of the death it takes a genuine pure born-again Holy Ghost led life to prove what you are now that's right my dear brother sister unless there's a fruit the fruit of spirit is not outward demonstration watch now now one of those scribes and Pharisees showing an outward demonstration Jesus unveiled them he said you make long pretence of prayers and you devour widows houses you're like dead men's tombs you're like a silver girl that's painted on the outside but the inside of you you're full of dead men's bones now what were they saying they were seeing what was on the outside they didn't see the politics that went on behind the pool Curtis praise the Lord oh my what's this it's an inward work of grace love joy peace longsuffering goodness faith meekness gentleness patience there you are now let's watch this thought and continuity now father if they haven't got the fruit of the Spirit that keeps them day by day inconstant love forgiving their enemies making right their wrongs living peaceful and loving and sweet and kind to one another and a zeal for the church I love for Christ and for his children Oh eternal God forgive them praise the Lord notice again in Hebrews what is the fruit of the Spirit love joy peace longsuffering that's a part of God that's eat you and can forbearance forgiving one another's burdens forgiving one another as God for Christ's sake forgive you the Spirit of God in you makes you that way what brother Donny I can do that but it takes me about five years well I hope God don't accumulate your sins for five years well people hurt me and it takes me a while to get over yeah you're telling the truth it takes you a while to get over they don't take the spirit of God well go over to God by the dawning preach it amen hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus amen come on our children let's just say the truth and be honest it's not the Spirit of God that it takes three weeks or four weeks or a month or six month to get over our patent spells it's our stinking flesh I'm glad God don't pout on us because I'd be having more patent than I would love and I'm afraid if you would - I'll go ahead and say it for you aren't you glad that when you go to him it's able to forgive you Roger can you imagine oh oh my I mean I just tell you that I'll tell you one reason why tinkle because you will not allow him to do it through you you're holding on to your daddy's way so your mama's ways or uncle Freya's ways or uncle Jack's way you better let go of uncle Jack's ways if his ways is contrary to the word let go of Uncle Fred made Suzy Dale and ain't Lulabelle and whoever the bales are and get a hold of that forgiving spirit of Christ [Music] notice is now I'm a jumper 57 to 60 if a man's born of the Spirit of God or a woman they have the furthest sphere that won't godly remember we're talking about our godly fruitful life they want godly they live they keep away from the things of the world God listen this God moves at me and makes himself manifest and proves that he's God working in there the other is impersonating notice again are you constantly abiding in his presence with the fruit of the Spirit in your life long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness can you bear for someone to talk about you and you love them so much to your heart you pray for them or is it a selfish little prayer Oh Lord I know how to pray for him oh brother does that sweetness and the love of God O God sweep over my soul Holy Spirit sweep over myself can't you see why people want to eradicate the need of the further spirit why so we can justify them not praying for their enemies being bitter and hateful and holding grudges and being resentful and just remember when you're that way it hurts you worse than the person you're resenting because it'll grieve the Holy Ghost away from you exactly right notice this again in Galatians 5 you said the further the spirit love joy peace long-suffering meekness gentleness patience these are not to be manufactured there to be products that comes from the inside out notices now the outside life that we live proves what's on the inside so the reason that old crone on has my feathers is because he has a crow life the reason that indigo peacock has beautiful blue feathers is because my seed is an indigo blue peacock the reason you are a child of God and you can forgive other folks and other people look at you so how in the world can you do that because you're a thought of God you like your father how can they hold grudges cuz they don't have what you have oh my notice this we have tried to manufacture this to manufacture the fruits of the spirit now what you listen to the results and we always turn out hypocrisy because you cannot manufacture Christianity praise the Lord it's an experience by spirit that lives in you and bears fruit of itself so how could calluses then have all fruit of the Spirit genuine further spirit and him be a devil he could he had what people perceived was such now we would bow radio spot here in Johnson City and some of these local stations and we would put my wins in our sermons say let's pick the ones on let me say I think a good one to start with Obi one I've preached several years ago Christmas in Sodom and then what we'll do we will air it in between some of the Baptist preachers and some of the masses and next to the Catholic and I wonder what the people now the world would say who had the most love it wouldn't be me of course can you imagine just a series that I just did on modesty and apparel and all that and I would put that on television or radio as my photos a brother message it has a television station in a nation away from here and it written about our videos and said well why don't you let us put them on as a brother I don't I don't think so I don't think I'm a type of Persia I don't think I mean you imagine John the Baptist been on video okay I won't tell you that I just got me I'm not the TV guy I don't belong in Houston I'm over here we got 90 thousand or how many ever they've got that's not me that's on me could you turn I just have me and that guy got no love yet you adherent said that man I never have said under passion my life that shows me so much others that you're writing you don't know what love is no you don't know what love is because real hobby is corrected after the house we have none look at our young girl sitting around here how could you mothers not yours and not allowed to warn miniskirts to church how could you mother's love your girls I'm not allowed to wear makeup and paint up like a you don't love them compared to the world but compared to God you do why do we do our girls that way because that's the way he does his girls now the devil that's his girls dress up like Jezebel he left some men do anything and everything they wanted her because that's the way the devil does the devil is not love the devil Kate love but God is love and God corrects and God whips and God tells the truth in an amazing by the rim says whenever we get to that day and we'll all set across the table we'll look at one another there we'll set them battle-scarred veterans and we'll reach across the table take hold one of the sins will set on crime you can wipe the tears that ever has in an amazing that will not sit there with any whip marks but I wonder in reality then I get more battle scars in life or did I get more weapons from him I'm talking about more than likely I got more weapons than that did battle scars but since it's a coronation and a crowning of the king and a beginning of a new empire my whip marks would be under coming to an overcomer so somehow I lose my whip marks from him I lose my spank marks but he lets me sit down there to table with my battle scars as if though I was a battle-scarred veteran a whole time with in reality I was a poor feeble child that had to be corrected week by week spanked week by week but he don't want me to be empire see though we're here to be a better so instead of setting our Whitmarsh where'd you get that one that i disobeyed the Lord he bruised me would you get back out of disobeyed the Lord Oh sister the only word you get down that was here outstanding where'd you go then was this and that was it all my now we said battle scar as if though my we were hardened soldiers from the burst hardened soldiers from the beginning and there were several scars you told my grace oh Jesus Lord Jesus notices question-answer 61 what kind of life is in you the life it's in it bear stickers always fussing cutting up real mean and ill you see what I mean arrogant that's not the fruit of the Spirit but some of God's children got this by nature smart-mouthed arrogant ill they can't even say good weren't hurting nobody what's amazing is when he dispersed set predestinated seed will be predestinate seeds fell down a nettle mineral water in God lettuce seed fall down in there it lives like a devil from how many years God burst it and a watering thing is still there that'll cocklebur on the outside but that new life for me so don't do this to me quit don't beat me what say about everybody that's not nice of you maybe you work with NASA nature giving people and they have a better temperaments human temperament than you do and say no take him said look at you you're a Christian you're in the message you believe brother branham don't you love it the way he gets saved whenever first comes a message he I don't remember call him brother BAM Delaney when I first come to messages but I shall come to the message he changed his terminology so did call him brother man from the breast hypocrite but he'll take them same quotes that you love and try to condemn you I thought you had all the custom I thought you're supposed to be this gentle little girl you just fly over and over you know you fat temper you know you thought when somebody does salute you about I come to forget him but I'm not old maybe we ought to cut off these soil mean people on the internet so I can preach to these little angels your tonight to shame y'all had to be beat up so bad for them people mean people that stream all over the country let me tell you something really --gel he will get the best of you if he has to kill you cuz if that's he blended in good ground nature may have give you a bad temperament nature may have give you a bad problem with lust but the Holy Ghost shall give you power to overcome it and there won't be one of us little slide out of here and stand before him that day and he'll give you a t-shirt I'm due or later to say although the bride in understand there were t-shirts on we will overcome hey mad and much of what we have to overcome is what nature gave us don't take this couple miss notice he said that's the way we should live yes certainly not greedy selfish indifferent ungodly the fruit of the Spirit is love joy long-suffering meekness generous take patience my that's it that's the fruit of the Spirit you know a tree trees got Sycamore bark on an apples going on what is it it's an apple tree and that a strange scenario let's look at this again a trees got sycamore bark on it and apples growing on it what is it it's an apple tree why why would it be an apple tree because the fruit testifies of the life do you understand much of our problem it's our Sycamore bark it's just kids Sycamore flash ticking more flash sinking more pressure sinking more they're sick and all that but brother let the Apple ice come out ha ha ha ha let it came out it'll change that Sycamore bark the life and the tree produces out of apples no matter what your theology is right or wrong if you're banging the wrong kind of fruits you're the wrong kind of tree brother jesus said by their fruits you shall know them not neither tree good lord don't misunderstand I'd rather have the wrong bark than the wrong fruit because if I keep bearing the right fruit my barks fixin to be changed this is sycamore you'll see some more around my soul seeking more he's gonna bring a sycamore to a tree of life yes dad that's exactly why what is it it's a wee heart on the inside of a copper bath let me close you take a person that speaks of terms with enough temper to fight a buzzsaw talk about their neighbors and everything like that don't you call that the Holy Ghost it cannot be no sir the Holy Ghost is meekness joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience faith that's the fruit of the Spirit the Holy Spirit bears in the Church of the Living God sweetness humbleness humility love for one another I'm suffering [Applause] but there was this jump down to flashing red lights about two two quotes below where you are there paragraph 166 I know that someday I've got to die and I hope that God never lets Satan crown me as an old kravid indifferent man and my wife an old nagging woman this is Satan's crown for many people he didn't say she is a bob haired woman even a cigarette second woman just to nag in a woman and he him an old crab it man that's a crown from the devil I'm getting old I'll tell you one thing I don't see anybody here tonight as old was John the Beloved was whenever John reached about 96 95 96 said he just said around and cry couldn't preach no more he just saved children the huff one another he was wearing his crown and it wasn't an old crab it man some of your young folks got your crown early some of you folks in your 30s and 40s you got your crown early y'all to cast that crown off your head so this is not becoming to me as a son of God to be a crabbing man or a Meghan woman legs is good for horses not Christians a funny smell a smell it every time now listen brother Ben Nelson serious on this I hope that God never lets Satan crown me as an old credit and different man in my wife an old nagging woman or your wife or you that way I pray brother that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit listen look here this message flashing red light of the side of his coming three months after the seals have been opened I like to do some sometime those we like to say to the message setting say many times brother man mentioned thunders after the seals is preached and then said many times you mentioned forgiveness and mercy and love praise the Lord you imagine I prayed that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit love joy long-suffering gentleness patience truth faith in the Holy Spirit water crown what occurred you mean cancer sickness and I said this those priests it lied and then brought blaspheme against she's in spannabis they was a blackbird but they'd found a few peacock feathers out of the message apparently and been able to stick a few in there and they could wear their long robes and their phylacteries that made long prayers which when you look at that instead yeah we'll get to sometime later but it meant they prayed three times a day in sessions of three hours nine hours a day they began with 45 minutes of meditation than an hour of prayer then another 45 minutes of meditation and finishing with prayer three times a day but Jesus said you blind guides you stand in the way and you won't go in and you will end nobody else can either but yet the people saw them all my kind old priests my kind old priests may God help us how many wants more of this flowing out of your life not the impersonation el not the nature given look friends forget trying to manufacture this I've been guilty I don't know about you I can't say for you but I have been guilty was trying to produce more life I've been guilty trying to produce more joy I was a Pentecostal professional when it comes to producing joy that brother right there would make them people shout with that organ I mean that brother right there would make him shot with his harmonica and singing I would make him shout boy we could produce joy and when we got done producing it lasted 15 20 minutes maybe what good did it do but if you get this real kind it's that when hang here I mean you guys please it'll be over get over Chuck is going to see sister Tammy oh no probably going to have Church the same way we always did we'll miss again but we're gonna have Church anyhow hey Sarge oh no it's another Dollywood weekend brother don is out of town but your self friends for a real real birds you've got joy you got peace over suffering faith goodness joy and for that man or woman who would absolutely do everything they could to destroy you you from your heart can say Father forgive them and not only can you repeat those beautiful precious words but you'll be able to follow that prayer with father I forgive them it's one thing for you to pray that prayer that God will forgive them it's another thing with you with the same integrity can say I forgive them I may always remember what they've done to me Lord but from my heart I forget in that order to do do we want godly men and godly women that want to be fruitful Christians let's bow our heads together if you would please Oh Heavenly Father I send you to my lord earth I think of the times that have said things against people Lord I think of the times Lord that I've not manifested your forgiveness in your mercy as quickly as I should have help us Lord to love like you we want to replicate your signs your wonders and want to lay hands on the sick and we love to hear those testimonies so and so prayed for so and so never healed what are the hospital and pray for this and they come out and that's all wonderful we love all that the Lord do we want to love like you forgive like you be like you in that way do we just want to walk on water and be an old credit man Lord I'd rather walk a godly life on earth then walk on every lake in this country because if I don't have the right attitude I'll just going to do is give me a puffed up head on that crowned head of an old crab in man help us Lord Lord Jesus let me say to you tonight honestly and openly I shut down my manufacturing business quite some time back of trying to manufacture through the spirit I've been guilty I had my business I've been going I had my factory running time to produce love trying to produce joy trying to produce this and that but failure after failure it led me to realize I could not manufacture any of them I have to let go and let God Lord Jesus help us help us that it'll be so easy from the soul to live this kind of life it's just as easy for a child of God to live this life is it is a sinner to live yourself Thank You Laurel father we come to the time of the year that many years ago in our nation it was set aside and recognized as your birthday we know it was not they yet Lord they even attacked part of your name to it Christmas but I find it so sad because your part of it is relatively gone to most people it's not about you even when many Christians it's not about you it's about family it's about songs and decorations and that's Christmas to them but lord help us not to be that way help us Lord that you will still be the reason that we talked about in our Lord Jesus may your life lift in a separate father we love you with all of our hearts praise God and the church said oh come let us adore him praise be to God praise be to God how many godly men godly women godly young men young women were to
