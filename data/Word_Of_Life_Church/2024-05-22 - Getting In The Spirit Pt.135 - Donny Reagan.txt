praise him all glory beong to [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and he believes he's worthy of all of our praise amen there's something about most of us we like to be appreciated loved told that we're needed if it's your natural family or your church family the place where you work we all like to feel that something that were a part of it right can you imagine you being the source of everything that is Holy everything that is righteous everything that is pure and true and genuine and yet many of the people who live on this Earth who breathe your air drink your water cut down your trees eat your food dig holes in your Earth and take out the granite and so on to make their cabinets every day they cannot live without what you have made and yet the majority of them don't even thank him right he's got way more love and patience than we do that's right because if people used us like that for about uh most of us what three days 6 weeks all right I'm really stretching it out now I'm going to go two months wow we think we are really so patient yet he has put up with the human race for all these thousands of years and they do that that I described and even more every day many of them deny that he even exists and yet if he stopped their breath they would drop in their tracks if you cut off the sunshine and never let it shine again I'm so grateful we have a heart to serve him you ever get kind of feeling low and w I don't know if God's blessed me or not I don't know you know this and that go to looking at how blessed you are I Ain talk about your house car all that I'm talking about you have a desire to live for him a desire to go to the house of God to desire when you get to the house of God to worship to pray to praise to say Amen to the word then walk out them doors there and to live what you've heard and you think you're not blessed you're one of the most blessed human beings that has ever lived on the face of this Earth amen turn around and tell somebody I'm blessed go ahead and tell them I'm blessed I'm blessed brother friend I'm blessed Saints I knew I was already but after that little sermon e there I realized I'm blessed even more than what I realized we are so blessed and if we are what do you reckon we need to do about it we need to give acknowledgement back to him amen who has blessed us yes praise the Lord isn't it a wonderful privilege for us to be able to be gathered together here tonight um I'm sure that most of you know it but want you to remember we having brother Jerry Phillips memorial service um tomorrow evening viewing from 5: to 7: and then the funeral service will be at 7:00 little bit to Funeral Home of course and then brother Daryl's Sister Sister Carrington's mother sister Judy Archer uh passed yesterday another one beyond the curtain of time be having her service Lord willing next Tuesday here at the church uh same time frame 5 to 7 then the service will be at 7:00 so just remember these families that the Lord will help them and comfort their hearts I'm so grateful we have a place to go to amen amen when this life is over let's read uh tonight Revelation 10 if you would verse one if you'd be remembering me also in prayer got the service tonight funeral service tomorrow night drive to Manchester on Friday I got Friday night Saturday night Sunday morning and as you all know I'm not getting any younger not yet anyway I'm on my way to it but I just haven't yet arrived so I certainly appreciate your prayers Revelation 10 verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven now remember this is not just an if I can say it this way an ordinary Angel if you can call any of them ordinary but this one has a special designation that it's a mighty Angel clothed with a cloud he's dressed in a certain dress it's for the occasion remember clothes have a significance of a season and a time so this Angel is dressed for the occasion clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his Fe his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire had in his hand a little book open set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven I notice there's a different sphere that this voice is coming from then where the seven Thunders come from when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me see f up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the Void voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound listen how important this is now when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets prophets wow well don't the Bible say though in the New Testament that the law and the prophets were unto John I always smile when people quote that and trying to say there are no prophets they don't even realize what they're quoting because the significance of that scripture is the law the Torah the first five books and the prophets let him realize the Old Testament is referred to as the law and the prophets the Bible is not saying there are no more prophets it's saying that the Torah and the prophets were until the coming of John then from that time on every man presses his way into the kingdom of God but God had prophets in the New Testament amen so apparently we still need them that's right that's right and when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets how many like to be remember tonight as we pray sister Manley as many all know I'm sure already had had surgery and they were going to let her come home but they noticed there was just a few things that wasn't quite quite normal so they had to go back in again and uh had to have another procedure and I talked to brother man today or yesterday I talked to him on the phone and then text today and um they're just trying to keep her steady and she's better than she was still needing prayer but he ask if I would just mention her tonight before the Saints and we could just continue to pray for that the Lord will help her and help him as well how many has a request You' like to lift your hand there before the Lord all right let's just go together gracious Heavenly Father we're so so blessed tonight to be able to call you our father thank you Lord for Wednesday night service how we love Wednesday night we're so grateful that we can be able to come together in the middle of the week and just get a little bit more of a refreshing Lord we're so thankful heavenly father that as we face this age and the hour of darkness and Peril is all around us everywhere we're so thankful that we have each other we're thankful thank F that we have your word that we have your message in the last days thankful that we have your presence living in US Lord what would we do without you father we're just asking you that you'd be mindful of all the hands that were uplifted tonight Lord dear God we pray for our sister Manley and also for our brother Jose that you'd be with him and strengthen him Lord difficult Lord watching his wife be sick and suffering and we pray for both of them that you would help them many hands uplifted tonight signifying needs dear God some physical some Financial maybe psychological whatever they are but we're praying that you just move for everyone we have many needs Among Us in our church and we just pray the presence of God would be with them lord it's coming into summertime and different people from our church out traveling some leaving this week some been gone already and some going to special meetings and some flying here and there and there so we just pray that you'd watch over them Lord keep your hand upon them as they're taking some time with their family to try to be able to refresh and be with them give them a nice time together and then bring them back home safely to us now father I stand here tonight and I'm probably the most needy person in the building is once again it's Fallen my lot to try to look into your word to try to Endeavor to bring something out of the word of God that would help your people that would encourage them that would correct them if they need to be corrected tonight father that would add a little strength to them you're the only one that can be able to do that to all these people that are here how one in the world could I ever do it I couldn't so I pray that you would help me make me sensitive Lord Jesus to be able to follow the leading of your spirit we commit the reading of the word and the hearing likewise into your great presence in Jesus name we ask amen praise the Lord and the Saints said amen God bless you I do expect more of those as we move along amen thank you so that I trust won't be the last one that you'll say until we get ready to dismiss tonight what a a blessed people that we are to live in this day when the prophets the sages the seers of the Times Gone by believe that such a time would exist on the earth that man would be allowed to look into the program of God and understand more about what God's plan was they knew that when they were prophesying that they were doing it in part part of it would be in symbols part of it would be in types and and shadows part of it they would catch a word or more than one word from God and even the words that they would get would not always be a clear paragraph or maybe even a full sentence from God maybe just a few words and they knew god well enough to know that God didn't speak like that that God spoke with clarity and God could speak with things in such great terms and make his way known it must have been quite difficult for the prophets as God sometimes would give them a word and it would seem totally out of season it would seem as if though it wasn't even fitting for the time I asked brother Charlie Cox one time I said brother Charlie whenever brother Brandon was here and you all were there at the Tabernacle and going driving and hearing and preach and going different places that you was able to drive what did you think about the conditions that brother brandham was describing how how how did you relate to it because no doubt some of them were further advanced than the time you all were living he said well they were and and we realized that but we believe that maybe some of them existed in other areas that we were just unaware of or some of them or maybe in the future to be but he said you knew that there was things that was being said that the times had not yet caught up with the prophecy so but as we live in the time that we're at we believe that certainly the times are catching up with the prophetic word do we not and no doubt there are more words that are to be fulfill but as one believer I believe with all of my heart that things could happen at such a rapid rate we see already how the things can unfold in such a way and it could just be one after another after another and happen at such a fast pace that we could be looking right at prophecies that have been said hundreds of years ago and the Very fulfillment be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 just like that and the time is upon us you know it pays us every day as the people of God to be ready if I was you and I was here tonight I wouldn't be waiting till Sunday morning to try to make something right with God or right with a brother or sister I would be afraid to walk out that door tonight if there's anything in your life that you feel like would hinder you from making the Rapture can anybody say Amen am now because God will bring his word to pass that way especially to the illuminated and We Know by the grace of God we are privileged to be able to walk in the greater light and the greater understanding that has been given in the life day now we don't say that to try to puff oursel up and not CL that we're better than somebody else because we're not we it not for the grace of God we would be just as blind as ever live to seeing out there but God for his own purpose has measured out to us a measure of Grace and I know I look at it maybe different than some I do not look at Grace as just something that allows you to do wrong and get by with it and you go unpunished I don't look at Grace that way I look at Grace is the allotment that God gives me the portion that he gives me is not the ability to sin and get by with it but he gives me the ability to want and to desire to walk in such a way not see how much I can do but see how much I can stay away from I'm not looking for what I can do to get by get by with it I want to do what he wants me to do I want to live my life every day as if so it were my last cuz who knows it may be now looking at what God has done down Through the Ages and we're able by the grace of God to look backwards in retrospect and see the types and the Shadows through a prophetic understanding things that God has been planning and has worked out and the Mysterious powers of God as the prophet called it are still working on every one of those names that are found written in the Lamb's Book of Life and sometimes the wheels of Prophecy might turn quite slow and saying in Times Gone by that people might live their entire life maybe your grandfathers your great-grandfathers your great grandmothers and they serve the Lord and they love the Lord and they might live 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 years I never see three or four prophetic words from God in the Bible come to pass in their lifetime and they might just go on and be a good Christian a good child of God and they live in the changing of the dispensation say from from wesy and Pentecost and they would see the restoration of gifts and they would see that little portion of word come to pass and they thought it was the greatest thing that ever was and it was a great time cuz when any mortal can see just one of God's prophetic utterances come to pass with our eyes with our soul and understand it you are a blessed human being but then can you imagine that there are other people who were allowed to live in a time when one prophetic word after another after another after another and it begins to unfold so fast that it almost takes your breaths believe it or not I just spoke about you you see because nearly every day that we live more things are unfolding I'm sure you heard about it just today that three of the nations of the world have decided that they feel like that there needs to be a Palestinian State already South Africa has wanted to bring and I'm sure you've heard about the arrest that the international Court supposedly of Justice wants to get a warrant for Netanyahu and and some of the other Israeli leaders and you realize what it's all leading up to that is going to come to where the nations of the world will press against Israel and we know that it could happen just like that because the anointing is already here the anointing what we saw the protest and the campuses what we saw from the president on down no we're not doing this no we're not doing that and you know what they're doing they're ushering in and working under the authority of the mark of the beast think of it if you don't do what we say you cannot buy or sell so if you don't do what we tell you to do we will stop sending you bombs we will stop sending you grenades we will stop sending you this and that and the other you do what we say do when we say do it and how we tell you to do it or we will penalize you now listen and understand the mark of the beast is not going to be everybody with a tattoo it's not going to be a computer all years and years ago when they start putting the barcodes on everything now of course our groceries and every s we buy people were scared to death that it was a mark of the beast and y'all remember that whenever they started doing the computer people were terrified that the computer was going to be the mark of the beast now all of that is going to add up and make it easier whenever it begins to finally move in but remember the mark of the beast is not a tattoo and being in your right hand is not that you'll have a computer chip slid under your skin and you'll scan yourself over the computer it's you giving giving your right hand a fellowship to join up to something that is anti- word don't you wor about no computer chip slid under your skin and you scanning yourself they already doing it and part of the European nations anyway it's not of you getting some type of scan across your forehead it's you receiving the doctrine of The ecumenical move and bowing down to the denominations well come on somebody that's right don't worry about no tattoo don't worry about no scanning or nothing like that many of them have already in essence joined up with the Beast system now for those of you that's kept up with it you know that the United methodists just in the last couple of weeks as a whole have now agreed together to put gay people inside the ministry they already had a split a few years ago but the main body you know they stayed together but now what they're doing then the way the organizational system is set up if we were an organization then the organization would have built this building then if we did not do what the organization said they would kick us out of this building because the organization owns it now look what the organization does so I watched a little thing about it the other day a lot of these Methodist congregations that are are not going along with this homosexual agenda well come on somebody don't you understand the sodomites knocked on lot's door and lot opened the door to them and gave them ear and gave them place so the sodomites are knocking not on Abraham's door but on lot door organized religion so you understand then what's happening to some of these Methodist congregations if they don't accept this then the Bishops and all of these overlords over them are telling them then you all get out because this building belongs to the United Methodist Church well I'm glad I can say here tonight this building right here don't belong to the UPC or the upz or the upb or nobody else it belongs to you folks it belong to no organization it don't belong to a bunch of Bishops somewhere that can say if you all Don't Preach what we say then we're booting you out they're not booting that out we're the ones that make the payments on it well come on but you see what they're doing so they Asser their Authority one working under this pre-tribulation beast power so if they don't accept the gay clergy then what will they do they will put them out and they can no longer buy and sell under the Methodist mark of the beast so you either do what we say or you will no longer be able to belong to us as far as an organizational system now they may be crying about it right now but a lot of them will be happy once they get throw out because they realized God had mercy on them and they were thrown out of her before it went into him there'll be some of them that'll be saved no doubt and come up through the tribulation period so already the beast power is moving in the preliminary move upon the Earth right now now remember Satan is moving in the background with his mechanics and God is also which works in a two-fold way in mechanics and Dynamics and the prophet tells us that there will be a refilling of the Holy ghost which is the Dynamics of this church which the church has been working in part while The Headstone has been descending so The Headstone has been descending down to the church ages and there will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost which we've worked in part I say bring it on Lord now what are we doing well we're coming to church and we're preaching and we're singing and we're living right and we're trying to witness and we're trying to spread the light trying to do everything we can and is a lot of it mechanics yes and people say oh that's just a routine you call it routine if you want to I call it mechanics because I know if our mechanics are not in order when the fire falls what's it going to fall on now when Elijah got ready to reconstruct the altar of God by the vision that God had showed him he had to have the stones ready he had to turn down there heathenism and he had to build an altar for God had to dig a ditch had to put the rocks in order had to delay the wood in order what was that mechanics waiting for God's Dynamics to strike to mechanics but you see the fire of God would have never struck there had he not want to all that labor and all of that effort to get it in order so don't think when you come to church and every night we don't run around the the benches and we all Shout you know and oh we boy we didn't have much of a meeting tonight boy we just sung and we clapped our hands and we just prayed and we had prayer requests well maybe tonight's going to be a mechanics night and then on Sunday it'll be mechanics and Dynamics but he's the one that knows how to build the building you and I don't and we don't want we don't want us to feel like that we know how it goes together but we want to be led by the spirit of God so I want my mechanics in order do you understand why that I study so much so when I get up and the anointing falls on me the spirit of God has something to be able to pull back up so I study I'll sit back there I study and study and study is it requir did god require me to study as much as I do probably not but I want him to have so much when the anointing falls on me that that word will spew out of me I'm telling you what so I don't have a bunch of filler well amen and Hallelujah and amen and Hallelujah you know what I'm saying some preachers every third word is amen I'd rather have a little more for God to be able to work on instead of standing up praying and and just amen amen amen amen and glory to God and glory to God y'all ought to be gloring to God and I ought to be saying something for you to glory to God bow so I want plenty of mechanics there for the spirit of God to anoint how many understand what I'm saying you understand why it's so important for you to come in here and sit down and read your Bible and just clear your mind a little bit and get ready for the service to start for the song leader and all that you can stand out there and talk about politics and business and money and this and that and the other but I dare say it would be would be more beneficial for most of us if we'd come in and set down for a few minutes and clear our mind and just meditate upon the Lord and meditate upon his goodness lord well what do you got for us now come on Church somebody say Amen so what are you doing you're bringing your mechanics in too so I'm bringing mine in you're bringing yours in and what do we do we pile all the mechanics together and then the Holy Spirit comes down and begins to anoint all them mechanics oh my you talking about a meeting there ain't no telling what God would do so Satan saw what God is doing and remember he knows he has but a short time so he must have a lot of his mechanics together so he's dealing with the nations of the world he's dealing with this anti-Semitism that's around the world he's dealing with the campuses and all that sort of thing all these friends it's not just well who's in charge of all that and they're trying to figure out well who is doing all this who's in charge well I can tell them I mean they won't believe me but I can tell them it's the devil in charge of it all he's getting all the world ready he he can't wait until the bride is gone can you imagine the very day the bride leaves and he recognizes that the sanctuaries become Smoky and the bride goes up he'll take over that day if the Rapture comes in the morning at 9:00 by noon the devil will have already taken over the world the mechanics have already set in there the United Nations there's men in every spot no doubt Moses and Elijah are already on the earth tonight already here well praise the Lord and the bride just getting ready and the 144,000 cannot come in until the bride is gone and there might not be but one more person there might be a half a dozen we don't know but we want to be ready every hour of our life because we have not a clue exactly the time when the Lord may pull our card from the rack as it were if you're sitting here tonight without the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me speak this to you as your pastor and your brother I want to see you filled with the spirit of God I want to see every member of our church every fiber of our being so full of the holy ghost that we can love those that hate us and we can forgive our enemies and we can pray for those that despitefully use us and watch the Living God come Among Us and fulfill his word oh Hallelujah you see the Lord God desired to bring his inheritance back to his people and as we've been looking at Ruth being a type of this again we'll pick up there Ruth 4:9 and Boaz said unto the elders and to all the people you are witnesses this day that I bought all that was alic and all that was Chileans and maon of the hand of Naomi moreover Ruth the moabitas the wife of meon have I purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of his place ye are witnesses this day but our Boaz did not go to the gate of Jerusalem in order to open the book but our Boaz went through the Gates of Jerusalem outside the city as Paul said that he had to suffer without the gate so he must go outside the gate in order to pay the ransom price but remember the book was not on the cross the book was not up on golasa he could not have even taken the book had the book been there but the book was still in the hands of almighty God so our Boaz you see it's all about location location location that's not just a good real estate idea it's God's idea location location location being at the right place at the right time with the right people under the right influence location location location come on somebody let's have church tonight now we read Revelation 10 but let us go backwards and read Revelation 5:7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and what he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors so they got Harps and then they've got these golden vows full of odors now what was the odors it was incense that was being burned but I want you to notice now what the incense actually was golden vows full of oders which are the prayers of the Saints so in heaven the angels in their vows or in their incense burner they did not have Sandalwood they did not have teak wood they did not have some type of aromatics of some type of bark off of a tree or some type of oil but what they actually had inside of these vials was Saints prayers so you imagine children of God down on the earth were praying and when the lamb takes the book and the angels of God have Harps which is music of course and then they're pouring out this incense and recognition of what the lamb has done but it's not smoked that's coming up but they're pouring out the prayers of the children of God you mean God stores up our prayers you understand what a a sacred holy thing that the prayers of the righteous people of God are that they are actually stored in great containers as it was in the heavens and those containers are given to the charge of the angels and whenever the people people of God are praying you may feel like when you're praying your prayers are going no higher than your head you may not feel one thing not one little bit of the anointing not one little bit of the presence of God but when you're praying as a saint of God under the true baptism of the Holy Ghost them prayers are being stored up and when the lamb took the book in the symbol then was released in recognition of him taking that book was what the prayers of the Saints so the prayers of the Saints must have been associated with Redemption so the saints were praying Oh Come Lord Jesus oh Lord Jesus save my family Lord Jesus save my husband Lord Jesus grab a hold of my backslid brother Lord God please do this and whenever the lamb takes the book one of the most Sublime things in all of the entire Cannon of scripture And yet when that takes place there in the vision in heaven of all the things to be released it was not Angelic voices it was not cherubim that were praising it was not some Heavenly Choir that was singing at the time but what was released the prayers of the saints of God it ain't no wonder the devil don't want us to pray he don't want us to know the power that is in our prayer he does does not want us to see the precious value that is in our prayer somebody hearing me tonight I ain't just talking about you always been down on your knees once you learn that you can pray no matter where you are what time of the day it is you're pushing a buggy down through Walmart you can go with a prayer on your lips come on somebody as I gave you that example the other day of Sams you know what I wasn't a bit embarrassed to lay my hands on that little old lady because I saw there was a need there and apparently she sensed the presence of God so you know what I believe you and I as a people of God we ought to pray more we ought to be spend more time in the presence of our Lord Jesus of the Don I'm so limited in my time I know you are but you drive to work don't you you drive to the drive-thru don't you you drive back home from work don't you you've got enough time turn off your talk radio turn off off YouTube turn off Instagram turn off Tik Tok and begin to send some prayers Up Before the Throne of God oh God save my family oh God send Revival in my home oh God send Revival in our church bring your people together Lord give the angel something to store up [Applause] so if the Angels do have a vessel with your name wrad on it how big is it size of a thimble s there's this peach mango praise the lord it's one of the easiest things that we can do talk to our lord Jesus not for the sake of storage now but once you learn how to do it you realize how the devil's been robbing you I people I've had it for years and years and people say I don't know how to pray I don't how I don't how to I don't know how to talk to God and yet they've sat and just talked to me for 30 or 45 minutes about this or that the other I always turn it right around on I'm and tell them that you know what just the way you talk to me just now talk to God the exact same way I don't go to God and hold my hands in a certain way you know and get my mouth in a certain way and these and thou and all that sort of thing that ain't the way I talk okay I don't these and th I'm not a King James version I'm a I'm a Tennessee version so I just go to the Lord you know just the way I talk to you I Lord I Lord I don't understand Lord I need help Lord God would you please help me with this amen I I don't get in this super religious voice you you hear people get up before the church sometimes and pray and you hear them get in that church voice and you realize that ain't the way they talk to God noow and God's wondering who is that anyway do I know him because that's sure ain't the way he talks to me every other day I want to just talk to God the same way when I pray before you that I do in my closet driving down the road in my truck or down in my basement because he knows who we are anyhow don't he so why should I be all prim and proper before you all when I sure don't talk to him that way when I'm just me and him byel and you realize in that prayer is that open ch of communication that God gives us as his children and it is so precious and so sacred that he links it to the Redemption of the book he links the prayers of God's children so when the book is actually taken it's through the acknowledgment of the Saints prayers that he comes and says now release their prayers cuz here is the answer oh God save my boy oh God save my boy and the lamb is taking the book to be able to call your boy's name out of the book so your prayers are associated with the book and open you understand oh yes pray about your light bill pray about your phone bill all that but get that done and then spend time with Fellowship get your list all done get that all done and then just spend time oh Jesus I just love you oh Lord I just love you I want to tell you how much you mean to me Lord you've been so good to me it's hard to stay down friends if you'll ever start talking him that way you know why a lot of y'all are so down and so low all the time you don't spend enough time in praising the Lord in Fellowship yall to spend more time just loving him and praising him instead of watering in your mistakes and watering in your shortcoming well I come short well so do I but I'm going to make them them things right with God and then I'm going to praise him I'm going to love him I'm going to adore him that's one reason I'm saved that's one reason I'm called oh my now notice whenever he does this then the Angels come with the harps every one of them has Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying thou W worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth like Boaz our Boaz the Lord Jesus was not concerned about jeopardizing his reputation by being identified with us all of us know it's risky being identified with certain people I went and preached for preachers before that I knew they leaned in a certain direction about something even though I did not agree with what they believed I knew I would risk an element of my reputation by preaching for him because people say uhoh what's brother Donnie doing and then I've had preachers to come and preach for us and I knew that I differed with them on this and that and the other I knew that would be a risk of even some of you saying what's brother Donnie doing wonder how come he got this preacher here well what do you want me to do wait till we find every preacher that totally agrees with us on every point of Doctrine and we fuss and preach against the denominations and we're just as about as bad brother Ram talked about the Pentecostals how the one of them said he's coming on a cloud and the other said he's coming on a white horse and they said all right well make two groups that's about what we've done we've made two groups on the tent move we've made two groups on perusia we've made two groups on the gifts we made two groups on this we just keep on making them two groups about everything that comes well I don't believe it that way and I don't believe well I won't fellowship with you no more that's fine you won't come and preach for me and I won't come and preach for you and we won't send our young people to your Youth Camp well that's just fine and dandy we're not coming to your Youth Camp and then we preach against the nomination bunch of Hypocrites well preach it brother Donnie I'm with you brother Donnie Amen brother Donnie Hallelujah but the Lord Jesus wanted to share his inheritance with us so like Boaz Jesus made his plans privately but carried them out publicly so Satan wasn't there when he laid out the plan so part of it even now he don't quite understand we do have the advantage on him since we are part of the family you see we're part of the initiated that's right we're part of the initiated so the Lord Jesus made his plans in private and then paid the price in a public form now watch here in in the Book of Ruth chapter 4 I find this so amazing in the Book of Ruth 4: 1 through 45 there it's five times that you find people sitting down now watch the posture of their body so five times in those first few verses you find people sitting down now there's a time to set and there's a time to stand and there's a time to kneel there's a time to run fast there's a time when you're behind run real fast so you can catch up right so the position of what we see in the Book of Ruth is reflecting part of the work now watch whenever the Lord Jesus actually finishes his Earthly stage of the work of redemption that he also moves into the most noted position in the in the four gospels and also in the rest of the New Testament is that he moves into a setting position okay notice in Mark 1619 so then after the Lord has spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and what s on the right hand of God Ephesians 1:20 which he had wrote In Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him on his own right hand in the Heavenly places Hebrews 1:3 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person upholding All Things by the word of his power not the power of His word but the word of his power when he had himself purged our sins sat down sat down now remember when Boaz entered into this purchase price and when every moved along at a certain State he was setting but he also had to change his posture in order to stand up and take his shoe off so the change of the posture of the Redeemer signifies something's fixing to happen with the redeemed cuz remember the whole thing is the Redeemer and the redeemed oh Hallelujah sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Hebrews 81 now the things which we have spoken this is the son we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens why what is this signifying because the transaction of the purchase price is finished so hanging on the cross is no longer necessary now the Lord Jesus could not have sat on the cross wrong posture he could not have kneeled on the cross wrong posture he knelt In The Garden of Gethsemane you understand what I'm saying so he kneels in the Garden of Gethsemane the kneeling in the Garden of Gethsemane empowers him with the ability to then hang on the cross which fulfilled the promised word brings him out of the Tomb and then he can resurrect in his glorified body and set in the right hand of the Majesty so the setting is the significance that the word Earthly work of redemption is completed as far as the price being paid now you'll notice then there a few times and one of them of course was Steven whenever Steven was actually being stoned and then Steven said behold you know he looked up around to Heaven he said I I see the Son of God I I see him standing now notice this martyr in the New Testament brings the Lord Jesus up out of the mediatorial position to receiving a Son of God home so watch when he stands it is a significance to those on the earth oh glory to God look for him whenever he comes for his bride he won't be in a chair so whenever he comes down and the angels of God actually see him rise from the significant Throne that he's on and his position being changed it's a sign you're fixing to be changed yourself because his posture now notice in Ruth 410 moreover Ruth of motis the wife of meon have I purchased to be my wife I found the meaning of this word absolutely awesome purchase to get acquire create create by possess creating redeeming his people now this is the word that Boaz used I am creating Roose a new she is a moabitas but I'm going to give her a new name I'm going to give her a new book now remember to the devil was trying to stand between Ruth and her body change you see what Ruth needed was a new book and God gave her one actually he let her name be called over one of the books of the Bible right she got her own book praise the Lord so God was going to act out in her and to was trying to stand between her body change so she needed a name change she needed a book change and she also needed a body change in order to be pulled into the cycle of the seed of the Messiah what was that body change there had to be a Kinsman that would take her sin her moabi his condition upon himself and seow his seed in her and give her a body change right what you talking about Brother D what in the world it matter you ain't never matter to me by by Boaz taking her to himself prating her he ushered her in to a body change and she became with child and brought forth a son that's now to was standing between that promised seed which she was to carry notice the devil on down through after the fall in the Garden of Eden he's always tried to get to that woman look what he tried to do to Sarah he tried to get Sarah and get that King down there to fall in love with Sarah what's he trying to do he's trying to get to the chosen bride before Abraham does because there's a particular time what he do the same thing with Isaac and Rebecca and he's going to come right and do the same thing he tried to do the same thing on the day of Pentecost come on somebody tried to do the same thing with Mary that he would try to get her killed and have it assumed that she played the part of a harlot what's he trying to do after the fall in the Garden of Eden he's always been after the feminist counterpart don't you understand he knows he can never be able to get the male counterpart which is God but there was also female counterparts or attributes in the Eternal and he knows looking at us that we are the weaker that we are the ones in mortal flesh and that if he can try to stop the program of God he ain't going to try to get the Lord Jesus down he ain't going to try to make the Lord Jesus weary but he'll try to work on the female counterpart on the earth if he can stop you and I from coming to our position there will be no Resurrection there will be no Rapture there will be no raising from the dead but the Lord ain't worried because he knows the bride's fixing to get a body change oh [Applause] Hallelujah now notice the curse of the law rested upon the ammonites and the moabites so a moabitas could not enter into the congregation of the Lord until the 10th Generation and a generation was allocated for 40 years 400 years 400 years which would have excluded King David amen you'll find that in Deuteronomy 233 therefore the law could not bring Ruth in the law would have kept her out there's only one way to bring Ruth into the economy of God grace sir and Grace just so happened to be personified in a human being called Boaz Hallelujah let's take Grace off the pages of the Bible let's take Grace out of the out of the pages of a dictionary let's Let It Be embodied in us or we may find quotes and find scriptures that are seem like I I dare say there's probably not a person sitting here tonight it's been saved very long that we couldn't find a quote or a scripture for most of us and pretty much put keep all of us out come on you realize the headstone didn't come cry la la la la The Headstone come crying Grace Grace Oh Glory grace alone can help her and this grace is personified in Boaz now watch this in the saman church age redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner oh no brother Donnie I see where you're going now you're going on that old predestination stuff ain't you you call it old predestination stuff if you want to I call it a great key to God's great plan it ain't stuff come on somebody I I tell you you know when I came here years and years ago brother Jerry Phillips was one of the first Brothers him and brother JD but brother Jerry I remember in particular brother Skip and some of us was talking about it and whenever brother Jerry come to me and we started talking he said brother how how how do you believe in election and stuff how do you believe in predestination I said well I believe it the way the Bible taught it the way the prophet taught it that there was a seed in you he said is that the way you believe it us yes sir he said well I'm going to tell you right now there's a bunch of folks in Happy Valley they don't believe it that way I said you're kidding me I mean I was dumb okay you think well what's new about that I know I'm just Dumber now I know but I thought everybody believed predestination boy was I surprised so I started studying on it and I started preaching on it boy the more I'd preach the more some folks would get mad and leave and I'm thinking oh my goodness I thought this Happy Valley Church that come to the message and how many ever years ago I thought they believed what the Bible said and what the prophet taught and you know what I found out after them how many ever years I've been here now I found out there's still folks around the message of the hour that don't believe predestination the way the Bible taught it they don't believe it the way the prophet taught it well come on somebody I hope there ain't none of them people here tonight already surely goodness I done preach most of them out of here by now but I can see why the devil don't want you to believe in predestination because you'll never recognize who you are until you see the election of God you'll always get hung up on yourself you get hung up on your shortcoming and you keep looking at this and this and this and you think that's you I'm here to tell you tonight that ain't you that ain't you the real you is a son or daughter of God that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world it ain't this house you live in so I kind of noticed after preaching on this for a bit brother Jerry get around me kind of talk a little quieter brother I'm I'm with you that's that's the way I beli that he say smile come on his face that that's the way I believed that I wouldn't I wasn't sure how you believed it I said well you know how I believe her now in case y'all don't know I still believe it the same way except stronger tonight than I was 30 some years ago whenever I got here that's the only thing that's going to get us out of here as a matter of fact the prophet said if he didn't believe in election he'd be a mighty discouraged man I'm so glad God ain't depending on me and God ain't depending on you and God ain't depending on no human being to get there and God knew there was no flesh he could trust nobody I don't care how long they've been preaching how long they've been singing how long they've been shouting and jumping around God trust his word and God made that seed out of his word and planted that seed inside of you by the grace of God woo can I feel one minute thank you redem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death shed the the shed Blood Bought back I can't hear [Applause] you he bought back the spoken word seed PR and the church said go with me to the breach and what did he do now he's been back there interceding until his blood has atoned for every person and the lamb now knows what's written in the book so he knowed from before the foundation of the world their names were in there so we stood back here and done medior work like this until the mediatorial work everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished and now he walks out thank you Lord uhoh so it's not satting he walks out glory to God and he's done all this now now he comes to take his bride he comes now as king notice what he's looking for he's looking for his Queen and he's going to be saying Here I Am Lord Here I Am Lord amen amen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped up around Seven Seals God's law required a kinsman redeemer in the lamb come out boldly I am their Kinsman yes Lord I am their redeemer I now have made intercession for them and I've come to claim the rights for them amen amen I've come to claim the rights in that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall and I've paid the price oh brother Don't It Make You Feel religious amen now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's come to claim it back for the human race not claim it back to Angels but claim it back to the human which is given for to make sons and daughters again bring them back to the Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation trees animal life everything else oh my don't that make you feel good amen but now in this seven cell book of seals of redemption that the lamb took within himself he was the only one that could do it and he took it from the right hand of him to set upon the throne now declaim his Redemptive de claim his rights for me and you what he redeemed us from oh Lord notice paragraph page 105 now it comes here from this life seal now listen carefully you see when the prophet begins to preach this and if people don't follow carefully now listen when you go to listening to the Seven Seals keep this in mind the first sermon that he preaches is God in Simplicity then that night he preaches the breach then the next night he preaches the first seal so remember when he preaches God in Simplicity and when he preaches the breach the seals have not been yet fully opened even to him right so this is why some of the brethren in the message have taken quotes many of them from the breach and try to say that there was no more Mercy after 1963 because remember from where the Prophet is looking at it at the time remember he tells us in the first seal I would have made a horrible mistake today you remember that all right now watch each one of those seals is coming open every day right so Monday was the first Tuesday was the second on down on down then question answers and then he finishes up on the seventh seal on Sunday night so as he's PR preaching they're coming open each day so he preached the first seal but he didn't know what the second one was this is what he said he didn't know what the third one was or the fourth one was on down until each angel came each day and made known the mystery to that angel so there is a mysterious opening of the seals and that is by a symbol but then there's also a reality opening of the seals now keep that in mind when you listen to it because because it's so easy to intertwine it and you place it wrong dispensation this is what some of the Brethren have done not that I think I know so much but you like to go back and study what he said and just compare what he said to what he said I know there some folks around the message think brother Brown was totally infallible and they think brother Brown knew everything about everything but that just shows they don't believe what he said himself God don't show his profets everything that is a direct quote so notice now what happens now he comes from here at this last seal he's no more mediator the last seal he's King now what he does he do if he's King has to have subjects and his subject is them that he's redeemed that cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption so you see all of our loved ones that are going on and passing through the channel of death they are not going Before the mediatorial Throne into the seventh Dimension where are they going going sixth Dimension where have all of our loved ones gone that have belied the word and they're being identified with Malachi 4 where are they tonight where brother Jerry go the other day sixth Dimension where sister Judy go sixth Dimension rest of our Saints your husbands your wives your children whatever they are they have not gone into the seventh Dimension yet because the lamb has not claimed his rights of possession why brother Donnie what's he waiting on on maybe it's your son maybe it's your daughter maybe it's your husband now notice he says his subjects is them that he's redeem and they cannot come before him they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption now this is not that he has to die again he's already done that taken care of finished he's done sit down after that but remember Redemption is in stages so he purchases and he pays full price of the penalty then he has to take the book and when he claims that book it releases the right of the redeemed so they go to the sixth Dimension until this happens until he takes the right of redemption and now he walks forth from a mediate where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights amen when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's Throne notice where he come out of he walked out of the father's Throne so there wasn't three beings setting up there in heaven and the father had a throne and the son had a throne and the Holy Ghost had a throne but there was one throne and the lamb actually walked out of the father's Throne it was the father's projection of himself in a condescending form that we call Son of God when the lamb slain walked for forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he become not a lamb but a lion Comm a king and he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side know you not that the Saints shall judge the Earth notice there then he comes he leaves the throne as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a Lion King I hate to inform Disney but this is the original Lion King amen so what is he doing even this very night if there's not but one name left if there's not but one little Asian or one black African somewhere or some white Caucasian on Ireland or Scotland or wherever it is he will be right there on that Throne I'm glad he would do it cuz that last one could have been me or it could have been you aren't you glad he'll wait on one so the whole thing is hinged upon them coming in every one of them he comes and he leaves the throne as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a lion king to bring the whole world into judgment that's rejected our kinsman redeemer then is King over all why he's got the title deed of redemption it all Lays within his hand I'm glad I know him then claims his inheritance that's the church the bride now let's skip down here to this next one here it lays in the future notice so Mercy was not over that night when he's preaching this on the breach but here it lays in the future what lays in the future when the lamb will step from the mediatorial throne and call for his bride then mercy is over not March of 1963 Mercy was over but this Lays in the future friends you understand there's people around our message that taught their kids years ago that if they was born after 77 they couldn't even be saved there was a generation of people there's people sitting here not that had family and went to church with them and that was a generation of people that were lost think of it by the ignorance of preachers and the ignorance of parents of getting a quote here and one there and one there you imagine raising your children and telling them there's no mercy for you can you imagine what kind of people they turned into what a shame yes sir thank God for True men of God oh my notice it here it lays in the future tonight he's a mediator but he's coming to this it's even dispensation Christ must come to the allotted word you understand so tonight is's the mediator he has not yet come to this position oh praise God oh Hallelujah jump down you with me to Christ of God now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back to redeeming but someday now notice this is July the 28 1963 4 months after the breach is preached someday he comes forth to get this book now wait a minute I thought he said he already got the book and the seals well in the symbolic form of the Revelation he did right well brother Donnie what kind of book is it a great old big book or what is it there well let's just find out and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer amen yes sir the words in the book wow and the word is him and all that's in the book and he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain back to the first now the mystery of the book are revealed when the seals are broken notice the mystery in mysterious form it's revealed when the seals are broken and when the seals completely listen when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over which was not in 63 and it wasn't in 77 and it wasn't in 88 and it wasn't in 98 and it wasn't in 2008 come on he's the only one that know know when it is let's Stand Together praise be to God praise be to God so just stand I didn't say I was done I just told you stand up that's all right on so the book wasn't at the cross so he paid the price for the book but it wasn't at the cross so he he had to wait to take the book when he was righteous again I know that nearly chokes us to death I want you to listen to this I found this this evening I just sat in my chair and I just said Oh Glory to God lord Jesus the Earth didn't want him heavens couldn't have him he was a sinner so the Earth didn't want him and the heavens couldn't have him cuz he was a sinner oh my if you could only realize just think the Earth didn't know its creator heaven couldn't receive him because he had the sin of the Earth on him oh children don't you love this message don't you just love this message this message didn't come to to replace our Bible the message come to make the Bible a new book this is why Satan don't want this message preached he hates this message and he hates for preachers to get into this message and study it and preach it he hates it and the more he hates it the more we're going to do it so think heaven couldn't receive him because he had the sin of the Earth on him the Earth didn't want him they rejected and said away with such a fell Heavens couldn't receive him because he was a sinner so don't you understand there's only one place left for him to go hell demonology part two paragraph 199 and when I think that God sent him to hell because of his sins so he died out of the presence of God so you wouldn't have to don't you understand the Lord Jesus could not quote in his death Psalm 23 y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me he couldn't quote that brother Fred because the father can not stand to look upon sin so the book was not at the cross so he had to go to hell had to do something with all that sin he was packing yes don't you understand what he did with it he took it down to Hell right he went down to Hell as a sinner is unrighteous but all he's got to do is unload all of that right there where it belongs anyway not on you and not on him and he unloads all of that right there and what does he do then he kicks the door down on hell and reaches in there and grabs the keys off the devil's side and he goes immediately righteous form of theophany right over to paradise and sets Abraham free hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus notice and Paul says in Hebrews 9:24 for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now now to appear in the presence of God for us than the continual appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ in heaven for us is our great high priest is all we need think of it the justice of God is met seeing the face of the Lord Jesus that's all he need it's not like he has to bring a whole big bunch of blood and and a bunch of goats and a bunch of sheeps and a bunch of turtle notice how Paul puts it he he so he appears in the presence of God and just when he simply walks in God says my Justice is met our Justice is man it's satisfied he just walks in and in his face the justice of God was met and he stands right there so when you fall short of the glory of God and I fall short of the glory of God his presence he ever liveth to make intercession for us and he saves Paul goes on to say to the uttermost you Lord thank you Lord and that word don't only mean in time but forever you will never need anything else beyond that savior we're saved to the uttermost for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear just by him walking in in the presence of God for us so the continual appearance of Our Lord speaks for our innocence forever the very side of Jesus satisfied the justice of God he just himself just himself Hebrews 7:24 but this man this man because he continuous ever as an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost thank you Lord and the word means all together perfectly so that nothing should be wanting afterwards forever thank you praise be to God praise the Lord oh don't you love him praise God let's bow our heads together if you would how many would just like to say to the Lord Jesus tonight father I need to understand this greater yes Lord I do I've got both hands up before you tonight father I've studied it for decades and looked at it for years and yet Lord Lord
