[43:37] won't that be an awesome time
[43:42] let's turn today if you would
[43:45] to the book of Philemon a little small
[43:48] book in the New Testament
[43:50] book of Philemon
[43:53] so grateful we can be together again
[43:56] today in the presence of the Lord
[43:58] and he comes with a need on your heart
[44:00] your life before the Lord
[44:02] I believe he's mindful of all of them
[44:04] don't we
[44:07] this is a very very small book as far as
[44:09] chapters and verses but it's a very
[44:12] powerful book
[44:14] and what it contains for the lives of
[44:17] God's children
[44:20] Philemon verse 5.
[44:22] hearing of thy love and faith
[44:26] which thou Hast toward the lord Jesus
[44:30] and
[44:32] toward All Saints
[44:34] you see someone who really loves the
[44:36] Lord Jesus right
[44:38] loves his people amen people who say
[44:41] they love God and don't love his people
[44:43] they don't really know the love of God
[44:46] yet
[44:47] now notice in verse 6.
[44:50] that the communication
[44:52] of thy faith may become
[44:56] effectual
[44:59] that the communication of thy faith how
[45:02] do you communicate Faith now notice he
[45:05] says that the communication of thy faith
[45:10] may become
[45:12] effectual this was a great Christian
[45:15] love the Lord
[45:16] but there was some more that this
[45:19] brother needed
[45:20] and that was that his faiths might
[45:22] become more factual
[45:25] to become communicative the word
[45:27] effectual means powerful
[45:31] active
[45:32] energetic
[45:34] and perfected
[45:36] and full knowledge
[45:38] that the communication of thy faith may
[45:42] become effectual now listen how it's
[45:45] going to happen
[45:46] raising the Dead Brother Donny walking
[45:48] on the water
[45:49] casting out Devils Healing The Sick
[45:52] well that's not what Paul told this
[45:54] brother
[45:55] may become effectual by the
[45:58] acknowledging
[46:00] of every good thing
[46:03] which is in
[46:05] you
[46:07] in Christ Jesus
[46:10] you mean that's one of the ways that our
[46:12] own faith becomes more energetic how
[46:16] many believes in the Lord how many
[46:17] believes in God believes there's a
[46:18] heaven believes there's a hell of course
[46:20] of course we all believe that that's why
[46:21] you're here today
[46:22] but we desire that our faith will be
[46:26] more energetic do we not that it'll
[46:29] produce what God's word says
[46:31] notice in verse 7 for we have great joy
[46:34] and consolation in thy love
[46:37] because the bowels of the Saints
[46:42] are refreshed
[46:44] by thee brother
[46:48] wow
[46:49] what a child of God
[46:52] so the way the Hebrews looked at it the
[46:54] bowels mean of course something totally
[46:55] different to us but to them it was the
[46:58] seat of the passions it was something
[47:00] there within you that you couldn't
[47:02] describe now once you notice here that
[47:05] verse 7 shows us that this brother
[47:09] Philemon was a refreshing Christian
[47:14] and the kind of man that others
[47:17] appreciated how many wants to be that
[47:19] today just a refreshing Christian sort
[47:23] of like you've been out in the heart and
[47:26] you've been working and sweating and you
[47:28] are so tired and you're just exhausted
[47:30] and somebody goes to bring you your
[47:33] favorite drink whatever that is whether
[47:35] it's hot or cold to you but yet it's
[47:37] just so refreshes you this is what God
[47:42] wants his people to be
[47:44] refreshing Christians
[47:48] you know the church at coloss actually
[47:50] met at the home of this brother
[47:54] Philemon and his wife afia now this is
[47:58] where that the church was held
[48:01] Philippians chapter 4 verse 8.
[48:04] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[48:07] true whatsoever things are on us
[48:10] whatsoever things are just
[48:13] whatsoever things are pure
[48:15] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[48:19] things are good report it's there being
[48:22] a virtue if there be any praise
[48:27] think
[48:28] on these things
[48:31] and the church said
[48:34] we're going to pray but before we do
[48:37] um
[48:37] brother Phil and sister Ruth's priests
[48:40] maybe you probably know that their son a
[48:43] little newborn son Jonah has pneumonia
[48:46] in one lung and the other little boy
[48:48] Micah has a fever and a rash so
[48:54] he's right to the level as far as having
[48:56] to go on breathing and all of that so
[48:58] it's it's a serious thing for sure we
[49:01] want to remember them today
[49:03] also with a little bit of sadness in our
[49:05] hearts I wanted to just say this that
[49:08] our precious Susan
[49:10] mate that's been with us for so many
[49:13] months is heading back home to Kenya and
[49:16] we just wanted to say how much we love
[49:18] you sister says we're going to miss you
[49:27] she's been here for about six months I
[49:29] believe something like that I've known
[49:30] these folks for years and years and
[49:32] years in my trips to to Kenya and
[49:34] they've always been so special to me may
[49:37] God bless you Sister
[49:39] I made a lot to be remembered today you
[49:41] have a need a request on your heart I'm
[49:43] sure all of us do
[49:45] heavenly father as we bow our heads to
[49:48] the dust of the earth and once we were
[49:50] taken
[49:52] and unless the change comes we will all
[49:54] go back that same way
[49:56] but while we are here we certainly
[49:58] desire to be the type of people you want
[50:01] us to be for most of us that are here
[50:04] today in this building we are not here
[50:06] to become Christians
[50:08] we're not here to become Believers we
[50:11] are not here many of us to receive the
[50:14] Holy Ghost
[50:15] we are not here to find
[50:17] eternal life but we are here to learn
[50:20] how we can be a better people
[50:23] a people that are truly as Paul said
[50:26] about this precious brother of ours
[50:29] effectual people
[50:31] that are contagious
[50:35] people that when others get around us
[50:37] they want to be around us more
[50:40] I pray that you would help us with that
[50:42] father in the name of Jesus would you
[50:45] minister to those that are sick and
[50:46] needy father little Jonah in the name of
[50:49] Jesus May the spirit of God go into the
[50:52] hospital where that little baby is today
[50:54] Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[50:58] Christ leave this child
[51:00] father our brother Mike Pinkston and the
[51:03] hospital still we're praying for your
[51:05] mercy to him help him Lord my daughter
[51:08] Alicia is still not feeling well today
[51:10] Father prayer that should move for her
[51:12] others that are sick and needy touch
[51:14] your people speak to us as only you can
[51:17] do in Jesus name we pray amen God bless
[51:21] you you may be seated
[51:30] I don't believe
[51:32] our lord Jesus could have
[51:36] completely fulfilled a journey on the
[51:38] Earth
[51:39] in the act of canosis
[51:42] which is the emptying out of himself
[51:45] Forum a greater purpose than what he
[51:48] felt like keeping himself and that realm
[51:51] was
[51:52] that may be overwhelming to us but he
[51:55] felt the purpose of emptying himself out
[51:59] would be greater than staying that way
[52:03] and he did it of course
[52:05] for us
[52:07] truly he could not have died
[52:10] in the logos form
[52:12] he could not have become
[52:15] sin on a tree in that form of the word
[52:20] so there's only one way he could do it
[52:21] and that was to empty himself into
[52:25] another form
[52:27] by that there was much that he laid
[52:30] aside and he took on something that he
[52:33] had never had before and that was total
[52:37] Humanity
[52:38] he appeared in various times in the Old
[52:41] Testament in different forms a cloud a
[52:44] fire a light a theophany different ways
[52:48] but he had never taken on a permanent
[52:51] flesh body
[52:53] and he didn't want to just take on a
[52:55] permanent flesh body that was in a
[52:57] glorified state but he must first go
[53:00] through the human side which is the
[53:02] great side of weakness
[53:04] then glorify that body and then make a
[53:07] way to bring others in that same pattern
[53:11] we know that he suffered in his body
[53:13] sickness and disease and all different
[53:17] types of things like that but for myself
[53:20] looking at the condensation that he
[53:23] stepped into I cannot believe that he
[53:27] would have done all of that and never
[53:31] stepped into the part that most of us
[53:34] deal with every day and that is so much
[53:38] negativity in our lives we're born that
[53:42] way we're born negative we're born with
[53:45] all types of sad things that's going to
[53:47] happen to us in our life some of you
[53:49] teenagers have already experienced more
[53:52] in your life than some have at 50 60 70
[53:55] years old because of the trauma the
[53:59] sadness maybe divorce in your home maybe
[54:02] someone with a a very very bad disease
[54:05] and you you're having to experience that
[54:08] in your life I just cannot believe that
[54:11] our Lord would have felt that he
[54:13] completed the journey to the Earth
[54:16] without himself experienced a lot of
[54:20] negative things by that I don't mean
[54:23] that he himself was negative but that he
[54:27] allowed a lot of negative things to come
[54:30] to him and as I was thinking this
[54:32] morning wondering about our Lord and how
[54:36] that he constantly was saying I am this
[54:39] and I am that I am the way I am the
[54:42] truth I am this and I am that I came
[54:45] from God and I begin to think and look
[54:48] at it in a little bit different way than
[54:50] I'd ever looked at it before because I
[54:52] know that he was saying that that it
[54:55] would be written in the word and that
[54:57] Generations would be able to read that
[55:00] and know who he was but it began to
[55:02] wonder as I was thinking about it this
[55:05] morning if part of that acknowledgment
[55:08] was not for himself
[55:12] that he would be able to keep before him
[55:15] who he was and what he was here for did
[55:21] he say it for us no doubt he did but he
[55:25] was the very author of Faith so he would
[55:28] truly know how important it is to say
[55:33] what the word says about you now truly
[55:37] the Bible doesn't give us a lot of
[55:38] examples of Jesus going through a lot of
[55:42] negative things we know that he was he
[55:44] was born under the Roman times and he
[55:46] was persecuted from the born the day
[55:48] that he was born into the day that he
[55:50] died and we know that he dealt with a
[55:52] lot of things around him by the people
[55:54] that were around him hardly nobody knew
[55:57] who he was even the disciples who knew
[56:00] they got it so slowly no doubt he dealt
[56:03] with so much negative things even from
[56:06] the people he had chosen to be around
[56:09] him they argued they fussed they debate
[56:11] wanted to know who's going to be the
[56:13] greatest who's going to have the biggest
[56:14] Ministry all that sort of thing and that
[56:17] was certainly a negative aspect that the
[56:20] Lord Jesus never had to dealt with
[56:22] himself there was no one greater than
[56:24] him and yet no one could come as low as
[56:27] he came so he never dealt with that but
[56:30] he must have allowed himself to feel
[56:34] that feeling of what it's like to be
[56:37] negative to be sad as a matter of fact
[56:40] the prophet Isaiah told us that he was
[56:43] oppressed and that word means depression
[56:46] so he must have felt this this element
[56:50] of depression by what that he was a
[56:54] sinner no he wasn't that because he'd
[56:57] messed up terribly he never messed up
[56:59] one time he never said one wrong word
[57:02] never thought one thought from a sinful
[57:05] nature because he didn't have a sinful
[57:07] nature so wonder why he got oppressed
[57:11] wonder why he felt sad wonder why that
[57:16] he felt as if though he needed the word
[57:18] to encourage him well they could only be
[57:22] from the world that he was living in and
[57:26] the people that he was around because it
[57:28] never generated from himself unlike you
[57:31] and I we don't have to be around too
[57:34] many negative people oh we got to be
[57:36] around is ourself and we get just enough
[57:39] negativity from ourself I don't need
[57:42] none of yours
[57:43] in reality you don't need none of mine
[57:46] but yet because we're all born in this
[57:50] and it's what the prophet called The Law
[57:52] of contrast and we know under the law of
[57:54] contrast it takes both positive and
[57:57] negative to make it work one day thank
[57:59] God the law of contrast shall be
[58:01] annihilated and will no longer need that
[58:04] but yet under the law of contrast which
[58:07] is all we've ever known the Lord God
[58:10] allowed himself to be subject not only
[58:13] to the law of sickness and the law of
[58:15] death and the law of suffering and the
[58:17] law of persecution but he also allowed
[58:20] himself to be born under the law of
[58:23] contrast all he'd ever known was the
[58:26] positive side all they'd ever known was
[58:28] the goodness and the mercy and the
[58:30] gentleness and all that was good about
[58:32] God so he allowed himself to experience
[58:35] what Mortals would experience being born
[58:39] under this law of contrast which is
[58:42] great negativity so so we would think
[58:45] negative and a lot of you are probably
[58:47] like me and most every other human on
[58:49] the earth that whenever we go to hear
[58:52] some bad news most of us many times will
[58:55] always make it worse than what it really
[58:57] is now wonder who taught us how to do
[59:00] that who taught us how to exaggerate in
[59:04] a negative way who taught us to think
[59:07] the worst about circumstances who taught
[59:10] us to think the worst about people
[59:14] who told us to think the worst about
[59:17] people that we even go to church with
[59:19] people that we love even Tom family
[59:21] members sometimes and someone will tell
[59:24] you I've got something to tell you oh
[59:26] I've got something to tell you why is it
[59:29] that most of us will always go toward
[59:32] it's bad I know it's awful it's
[59:34] absolutely terrible she's fail in
[59:36] adultery oh no he's around off of
[59:38] somebody else's wife oh no they've done
[59:41] this and they tell you to say I know it
[59:43] was nothing bad at all it was actually
[59:45] good I got a raise at my job and they
[59:49] cut my hours back four hours on the day
[59:51] ain't that wonderful but why is it we
[59:53] think more negative than we do positive
[59:57] now for the Lord Jesus to be able to
[59:59] understand and be the high priest of our
[1:00:02] souls he himself would you agree he
[1:00:05] himself would had to experience this
[1:00:08] element of being negative or at least
[1:00:11] battling and allow his human nature to
[1:00:15] feel it that way now the Old Testament
[1:00:17] of course covers this quite well uh in a
[1:00:20] different way than than the aspect of
[1:00:22] the new so let us read a few scriptures
[1:00:24] if you will this morning in Psalms 19
[1:00:27] 14. let the words of my mouth and the
[1:00:30] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[1:00:34] thy sight O Lord my strengths and my
[1:00:38] redeemer now David of course knew that
[1:00:41] he himself had been born a sinner never
[1:00:44] able to be reborn the way we are but he
[1:00:47] saw that there was a power in the word
[1:00:49] now remember he didn't even have the New
[1:00:51] Testament he did not have these beloved
[1:00:53] scriptures in Saint John 15 7. if you
[1:00:56] abide me and my words abide in you ask
[1:00:58] what you will he didn't have many of
[1:01:00] these positive things that God has given
[1:01:03] us so what did he have the Ten
[1:01:05] Commandments and he had the Torah which
[1:01:08] was made up basically of Thou shalt not
[1:01:10] Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt
[1:01:13] not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and
[1:01:16] yet he said he loved that more than he
[1:01:18] loved his necessary food can you imagine
[1:01:21] how he had cut up if he'd been in the
[1:01:24] New Testament when most of the Old
[1:01:26] Testament or the Torah anyway was
[1:01:29] negative so don't do this and don't do
[1:01:31] that if you do it I'm going to get you
[1:01:33] if you mess up I'm going to punish you
[1:01:35] if you mess up I'm going to take out the
[1:01:37] good lamb and David loved that part of
[1:01:40] the word my goodness if he would have
[1:01:42] said in Word of Life today the deacons
[1:01:44] are done escorted him out because a man
[1:01:47] wouldn't been able to contain himself
[1:01:49] now notice again in Psalms 141 3 set a
[1:01:54] watch O Lord before my mouth
[1:01:59] set a watch O Lord before my mouth how
[1:02:04] many needs to watch before yours
[1:02:07] said a watch O Lord before my mouth keep
[1:02:11] the door of my lips now right here is
[1:02:15] the biggest door in your life out of
[1:02:19] that door comes much of our own
[1:02:21] difficulty it comes much of our own
[1:02:24] issues and much of our own problems
[1:02:27] y'all going to preach women now this
[1:02:29] morning keep the door off before my
[1:02:32] mouth keep the door of my lips so David
[1:02:36] takes the lips as if though they are the
[1:02:40] entrance or the exit by which good
[1:02:42] things come out or bad things come out
[1:02:45] again Proverbs 6 2 Solomon wrote it this
[1:02:49] way thou art snared with the words of
[1:02:52] thy mouth Thou Art taken now what he's
[1:02:55] doing he's using the words of a Fowler
[1:02:58] or a hunter one that would lay a snare
[1:03:01] or would lay a trap and then they would
[1:03:05] put something in there so depending on
[1:03:07] what you were doing if it was an animal
[1:03:09] that you would after you would take a
[1:03:11] bird and you would tie a wing or
[1:03:13] something like that and the bird would
[1:03:14] lay there and flop and flop and he
[1:03:16] couldn't get out because he was tired so
[1:03:18] uh caracala Jackal whatever it was would
[1:03:21] hear it and see it and it would be
[1:03:23] screaming screaming screaming and it was
[1:03:26] just absolutely baiting itself so out of
[1:03:29] this Bird's mouth would come distress
[1:03:32] and cries for mercy and the caracal or
[1:03:35] the The Jackal what it was would hear it
[1:03:38] and it would hear it get closer closer
[1:03:40] it would spot it it would watch it now
[1:03:43] what's it doing actually the hunter was
[1:03:45] the one who put that in there and he's
[1:03:48] going to bait the Trap so David's liking
[1:03:52] our Mouse uh in the same way that
[1:03:54] Solomon did that our mouths can be a
[1:03:57] snare or our Mouse can be a trap that
[1:04:01] will entrap our lives of what God wants
[1:04:04] us to be and can so affect us that we
[1:04:08] don't become effectual in the promise of
[1:04:11] his word God help us Thou Art snare with
[1:04:14] the words of thy mouth Thou Art taken
[1:04:17] with the words of thy mouth so we'll set
[1:04:19] this way then that a jackal comes real
[1:04:21] close and there's a rabbit inside of
[1:04:23] there and the hunter has placed the
[1:04:26] rabbit tied its leg to a stake The
[1:04:28] Jackal cannot see the the Rope of course
[1:04:31] and the little rabbit is pulling pulling
[1:04:34] pulling and if you ever heard one they
[1:04:36] make one of the most pitiful screams
[1:04:37] it's it's terrible to hear it and it's a
[1:04:40] scream of pain and Agony and it will
[1:04:43] come in there when it does it totally
[1:04:45] overlooks the snare which has been laid
[1:04:49] not for the rabbit that has been laid
[1:04:51] for the caracal or for the Jackal or
[1:04:54] whatever more and he will come in
[1:04:56] precautiously nervously and when he
[1:04:58] steps his foot the hunter is laid a leaf
[1:05:02] or a brown something on the top of that
[1:05:04] to hide it but he must step into that in
[1:05:07] order to get the rabbit he must step
[1:05:09] into that in order to get the bird and
[1:05:11] here he comes laid right in his path and
[1:05:14] he's walking so carefully and he puts
[1:05:16] one foot on it and when he does he sets
[1:05:19] the trap now he saw it he was going
[1:05:22] after something to eat but you see there
[1:05:26] was a mine which was more intelligent
[1:05:28] than his own that had laid a snare for
[1:05:31] him that something that appealed to him
[1:05:34] well the devil lays many snares for us
[1:05:37] now I know some of y'all are thinking
[1:05:39] well that's pornography and some of you
[1:05:40] are thinking well it's smoking or it's
[1:05:42] drinking and sometimes it can be that
[1:05:44] way but many times it's this thing right
[1:05:48] here
[1:05:49] everybody's got one I reckon this
[1:05:51] morning don't they you need to watch
[1:05:53] that thing because it'll get you into
[1:05:55] more trouble than you can get out of I'm
[1:05:57] telling you that right now so it becomes
[1:06:01] a snare if we allow it to be so now it
[1:06:04] doesn't have to be but notice again
[1:06:06] Proverbs 13 3 he that keepeth his mouth
[1:06:11] keep us his life
[1:06:14] he that keepeth his mouths keep us his
[1:06:19] life but he that openeth wide his lips
[1:06:24] shall have
[1:06:26] destruction
[1:06:28] now you can imagine if David and Solomon
[1:06:30] would have known about Facebook
[1:06:33] and Instagram and Tick Tock and all the
[1:06:37] rest of the things that we have in this
[1:06:39] day Lord have mercy they would have
[1:06:41] committed chapter after chapter after
[1:06:43] chapter to all this stuff notice again
[1:06:46] Proverbs 15 4 a wholesome tongue
[1:06:52] a wholesome tongue look at the word
[1:06:55] wholesome healths and healing so a
[1:07:00] wholesome tongue is a tree of life
[1:07:04] but perverseness therein is a breach in
[1:07:08] the spirit a wholesome tongue is a tree
[1:07:12] of life
[1:07:15] now I wonder how many of us have got
[1:07:17] Briars and brambles in our tongue
[1:07:20] instead of a tree of life well I'm no
[1:07:22] good I'm no count I'm not acceptable
[1:07:24] nobody loves me God will never do
[1:07:26] nothing for me you need to get that out
[1:07:28] of your mouth friends you need to
[1:07:30] replace that with a wholesome tree
[1:07:34] bear with me a little bit and we'll get
[1:07:36] to the good part in a bit now notice
[1:07:38] again in Proverbs 18 21
[1:07:41] deaths and life
[1:07:43] are in the power of the tongue
[1:07:47] and they that love it shall eat the
[1:07:50] fruit thereof so death and life are in
[1:07:53] the power of the tongue and they that
[1:07:55] love it shall eat the fruit thereof
[1:07:58] Matthew 12 37 for by thy words Thou
[1:08:01] shalt be justified and by thy words Thou
[1:08:05] shalt be condemned now remember the Lord
[1:08:07] Jesus was not born the way we were so
[1:08:10] naturally it comes to us to do this it
[1:08:14] it we just tend to be that way we're
[1:08:17] more prone to be negative than we are
[1:08:20] positive now you can read all the
[1:08:22] self-help books that you want you can go
[1:08:24] to the library and check them all out
[1:08:26] you can go to Amazon and you can do
[1:08:28] whatever you want but I'm not talking
[1:08:30] about Mind Over Matter necessarily I'm
[1:08:33] talking about God's word in your mouth
[1:08:36] not you just saying well I'm a good
[1:08:38] person I'm this and that I'm great I'm
[1:08:40] wonderful I'm Divine you're a blabber
[1:08:43] Mouse leading your soul to hell you are
[1:08:46] lost you are miserable you are no good
[1:08:49] you are rotten just like me and
[1:08:51] everybody else in this building today we
[1:08:54] can only say what we are in Christ
[1:08:57] notice the way Paul addressed Philemon
[1:09:00] and he did not say now brother brag on
[1:09:02] yourself talk about how good you are
[1:09:04] talk about how wonderful you are he said
[1:09:07] you've got to acknowledge what you are
[1:09:10] in Christ Jesus not acknowledge what you
[1:09:14] are in the flesh not acknowledge what
[1:09:16] you are being a Reagan or a Hughes or a
[1:09:19] brown or a Smith or a gilroth or
[1:09:22] whatever you are because there's none of
[1:09:24] us have got a whole lot to brag about
[1:09:26] when it comes to that but the key was
[1:09:28] that Paul wanted this brother now he was
[1:09:31] an effectual Christian he was a
[1:09:33] Christian that had such energy about him
[1:09:37] and he was contagious what an
[1:09:39] identification so being around this
[1:09:42] brother he will just lift people up now
[1:09:44] this man wasn't even a preacher he
[1:09:46] wasn't even a deacon he wasn't a trustee
[1:09:49] as far as we know but he was just a lame
[1:09:51] member that got on fire with the Holy
[1:09:53] Ghost and I'm telling you what that man
[1:09:55] got so lit inside of his soul that
[1:09:59] people could be down and just you know
[1:10:01] I'm weary and upset and they'd get
[1:10:03] around this brother Philemon and he'd go
[1:10:05] to talking about the good things of God
[1:10:07] and the mercy of God and they would just
[1:10:10] be so refreshed when they got done and
[1:10:13] Paul acknowledged now you imagine this
[1:10:15] man's name God wrote in the New
[1:10:18] Testament what an identification his
[1:10:21] name has been called for over 2 000
[1:10:24] years this brother's name has been
[1:10:26] written and every continent on the earth
[1:10:29] it's been translated into every language
[1:10:32] which the New Testament has been written
[1:10:34] in not because he casts out devils not
[1:10:37] because the man walked on water not
[1:10:40] because the man while I wish somebody
[1:10:41] would preach with me this morning not
[1:10:43] because this man raised the dead he did
[1:10:46] not say because brother you have
[1:10:48] memorized Ever every word in the New
[1:10:50] Testament he was known because he was
[1:10:53] such an energetic guy to be around now
[1:10:57] no doubt the man fought battles and it
[1:10:59] went through all types of things but
[1:11:01] somehow he had learned a key that
[1:11:03] there's a way to be positive to maintain
[1:11:06] being positive in Christ Jesus even
[1:11:09] though you might be sick and you might
[1:11:11] be facing battles in your life but you
[1:11:14] realize your sickness is not what you
[1:11:16] are in Christ Jesus your sickness is
[1:11:19] what you are because you're in your
[1:11:21] flesh your depression is what you are
[1:11:24] because you're in your in your flesh but
[1:11:26] your healing is what you are because
[1:11:29] you're in Christ Jesus your deliverance
[1:11:31] is what you are because you are in
[1:11:34] Christ Jesus so we will acknowledge one
[1:11:36] or the other well my lumbago is so bad
[1:11:39] my big toe is killing me my back has
[1:11:42] hurting me my side it's my pleurisy I
[1:11:44] know it's what it is and most of us are
[1:11:46] more educated about sicknesses than we
[1:11:48] are about healing
[1:11:50] well come on now all of us know how to
[1:11:52] do Dr Google don't we so we get a little
[1:11:55] symptom what do we do we go to webmd.com
[1:11:58] or we go to mail.com and my week
[1:12:01] diagnose herself and we diagnose each
[1:12:03] other I wonder how many of us have
[1:12:05] diagnosed ourselves with much worse than
[1:12:07] what we ever had in the first place oh
[1:12:10] Lord God I've got walking pneumonia oh
[1:12:12] Lord I've got infantigo I've got this
[1:12:15] and that and the other it might not have
[1:12:17] been nothing but just a little bit of
[1:12:18] coal but you spoke yourself right into a
[1:12:21] worse condition than what you had
[1:12:23] initially for a lot of us the devil
[1:12:26] don't have to say a whole lot all he's
[1:12:28] got to do is give us a little bit and we
[1:12:30] take care of the rest of it because
[1:12:32] we're so negative and we're so down and
[1:12:35] we're so weary I'll tell you one thing
[1:12:37] Jesus Christ is not coming for a
[1:12:39] defeated Church he's not coming for a
[1:12:42] defeated bride that can barely hang on
[1:12:44] from Sunday to Wednesday I believe our
[1:12:47] Lord is coming for the people that are
[1:12:49] of Victor glorious people a people that
[1:12:52] are more than a conqueror we are not
[1:12:55] just survivors we are not just barely
[1:12:58] going to make it oh Hallelujah we have
[1:13:01] already
[1:13:02] eaten by the grace of God and greater is
[1:13:05] he that is in us than he that is in the
[1:13:08] world
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:17] oh you say brother Donnie you've been
[1:13:18] listening to Kenneth Hagin
[1:13:20] you didn't listen to Kenneth Copeland
[1:13:22] now I've been listening to Elijah
[1:13:25] and Elijah said it this way if your
[1:13:28] number is not called tonight in the
[1:13:30] prayer line and God reveals your heart
[1:13:32] and speaks to you and gives you
[1:13:33] Deliverance there don't never have no
[1:13:36] kind of a testimony only only that he
[1:13:39] healed you because if you do if you one
[1:13:43] time testify to the other side I want
[1:13:46] you to listen how powerful that a
[1:13:48] negative testimony is you don't have to
[1:13:50] do it day in and day out week in week
[1:13:52] out month in month out all you got to do
[1:13:54] is one time listen how powerful it is
[1:13:57] if you one time testify to the other
[1:14:00] side the negative side it will come back
[1:14:03] to you worse than it ever was
[1:14:07] that amazing so one time you testify
[1:14:11] well I got prayed for but I didn't
[1:14:14] feel one thing my brother Donnie prayed
[1:14:15] for me brother Daryl prayed for me and I
[1:14:18] didn't feel one thing and as a matter of
[1:14:19] fact I got worse which is the best sign
[1:14:22] that you got healed but you know what
[1:14:24] symptoms does to a lot of people it
[1:14:26] talks them right out of the healing
[1:14:27] right out of their miracle I I guarantee
[1:14:30] there's people sitting here today that
[1:14:32] they need a miracle and the truth if it
[1:14:34] is you probably ain't that far from it
[1:14:36] and God's waiting to see that she'll be
[1:14:39] faithful right down to the last
[1:14:41] confession just think of it you might
[1:14:43] not be but one confession away from a
[1:14:47] total Deliverance of whatever it is
[1:14:48] that's bothering you you might not be
[1:14:50] but oh Hallelujah you might not be but
[1:14:54] one confession away from something that
[1:14:57] you have fought for years and years and
[1:14:59] it may look like to the Natural Eye
[1:15:01] you're farther away that's only the
[1:15:03] devil trying to tell you that he's
[1:15:05] scared to death because he knows you're
[1:15:07] within that post of your Miracle younger
[1:15:10] than that close of your healing you're
[1:15:12] within that close of God Satan your
[1:15:15] husband saving your wife bringing your
[1:15:18] children back to the economy of God hold
[1:15:21] your confession brother sister keep
[1:15:23] speaking the word until it becomes so
[1:15:26] energetic Hallelujah that it causes a
[1:15:30] Revival down in your soul
[1:15:35] oh my goodness the negative side it will
[1:15:38] come back worse
[1:15:40] than you ever was
[1:15:43] I love the way he says this as opposed
[1:15:46] with Moses let him this week say
[1:15:48] I am strong
[1:15:51] see just say it in your heart
[1:15:53] that I am strong I now accepted Jesus as
[1:15:58] my healer never
[1:16:00] have any negative testimony anymore
[1:16:03] never
[1:16:05] just believe that God is under
[1:16:07] obligation Jesus Christ sending it to
[1:16:10] right hand of the father to accept you
[1:16:11] he's saying there as a high priest of
[1:16:13] your confession to make good before the
[1:16:15] father anything that he died for that
[1:16:18] you're confessing that he done and the
[1:16:22] church said
[1:16:23] notice again healing is not something
[1:16:25] you say well yeah I believe it I believe
[1:16:28] it that's all right if that's the best
[1:16:30] you can do just mentally or just say
[1:16:32] well yeah I see it I believe that I
[1:16:34] accept it that if you accept it on those
[1:16:36] basis you say what am I supposed to do
[1:16:39] I'm fixing to tell you
[1:16:41] keep saying it over and over say it out
[1:16:48] loud
[1:16:50] onia I say it to myself say it out loud
[1:16:54] so yourself will hear yourself saying it
[1:16:58] so yourself will hear yourself my
[1:17:02] husband is going to be saved my
[1:17:04] husband's going to have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:05] my wife's going to be delivered my child
[1:17:08] is going to be healed of this whatever
[1:17:09] it is Satan you might as well get out of
[1:17:12] the way because it's fixing to happen
[1:17:15] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:18] oh God you imagine the prophet Dan
[1:17:20] whenever he's an African he said a man
[1:17:22] that never walked in his life had been
[1:17:24] crippled his entire life but he heard of
[1:17:26] the signs and the Wonders and the
[1:17:28] Miracles that God had done and on his
[1:17:30] way to service the man bought himself a
[1:17:32] pair of shoes Hallelujah while he was
[1:17:34] putting his face into action guess what
[1:17:37] after the service that night he put him
[1:17:39] on and wore them out why because Glory
[1:17:41] he believed he believed enough to act on
[1:17:45] the promise of God or you said brother
[1:17:47] dawn of the doctor and give me six
[1:17:49] months to live I'll tell you what I'll
[1:17:50] do if I was you I'd start looking up a
[1:17:52] cruise maybe on the Caribbean I'd maybe
[1:17:54] look at a vacation up to Alaska or even
[1:17:57] one to Asheville if you can't afford no
[1:17:59] farther than that I would not buying out
[1:18:01] my funeral I would not pick out my
[1:18:03] flowers I would not line up for
[1:18:05] preachers I'll tell you when I do that
[1:18:07] it's when God tells you when is God
[1:18:10] going to start using the devil I'll tell
[1:18:12] him every now and then when he tells me
[1:18:14] you can't make it I'm this and that and
[1:18:16] hell I'll start saying oh did you get
[1:18:18] saved that when did God start using you
[1:18:21] as a mascot to give me a message if God
[1:18:24] wants to tell me something he ain't
[1:18:26] going to use the devil if God wants to
[1:18:28] tell you something he ain't going to use
[1:18:30] the Devil he's going to use the Holy
[1:18:32] Ghost he's going to use the word he's
[1:18:35] going to use the prophet of God he's
[1:18:37] going to use a man of God so when the
[1:18:39] devil goes to telling you thou stuff
[1:18:41] tell him to shut up
[1:18:44] stop devil I ain't got time to listen to
[1:18:47] you
[1:18:47] [Applause]
[1:18:55] now notice how you are you're born under
[1:18:58] this law of conscious even actually
[1:18:59] after you're born again
[1:19:02] he says
[1:19:03] you just say well I believe it I accept
[1:19:06] it then you accept it on that basis keep
[1:19:08] saying it over and over say it out loud
[1:19:10] say it over and over just keep saying
[1:19:14] I'm Healed I'm Healed
[1:19:19] say it until you actually
[1:19:23] believe it
[1:19:25] so you mean sometimes we're not actually
[1:19:28] believing what we're saying yet
[1:19:31] yet
[1:19:33] why would that do that because there's
[1:19:36] something about you hearing yourself say
[1:19:39] it's not enough that you hear me say it
[1:19:41] it's not enough that you hear Brother
[1:19:42] Dale and these other minister Brothers
[1:19:44] say you've got to say it yourself
[1:19:47] and you've got to say it out loud
[1:19:51] why because a man in the engine room and
[1:19:53] the man up here in the head are two
[1:19:55] different men and the Man Down behind
[1:19:57] the engine room is the one who really
[1:19:59] really believes you may have set up here
[1:20:01] oh I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed and
[1:20:03] the man down there so you better not say
[1:20:04] that now you better not testify you know
[1:20:06] every time you testify you get worse I
[1:20:09] must notice that
[1:20:11] I've seen it whenever we're going to
[1:20:13] testifying about God doing something for
[1:20:15] Erica it never seems like it never
[1:20:17] ceases to amaze me how Satan will do it
[1:20:20] I'll testify of something she'll testify
[1:20:22] her mama will testify this so testify
[1:20:25] how's Erica well she's doing good praise
[1:20:27] the Lord she's had some really good days
[1:20:28] it's amazing whenever you publicly will
[1:20:32] acknowledge it and the devil will turn
[1:20:34] right around and make it worse how many
[1:20:36] has ever experienced that same thing
[1:20:37] you're dealing with a situation you
[1:20:39] testify praise God I believe I got the
[1:20:40] Holy Ghost I believe the Lord delivered
[1:20:42] me of this and that and then you think
[1:20:44] boy within a week's time you ain't
[1:20:45] fighting nothing but Devil's everywhere
[1:20:47] and you say well I think I'm going to
[1:20:49] testify again that's exactly what he
[1:20:51] wants you to do he uses that
[1:20:54] intimidation on you to keep you from
[1:20:57] testifying of the goodness of God
[1:20:58] because her such power in you saying the
[1:21:02] word yourself listen to me Bobby you're
[1:21:05] gonna be healed listen to me body you're
[1:21:08] gonna be delivered Hallelujah listen to
[1:21:11] me body oh brother Donnie said I tell
[1:21:13] other people I would
[1:21:16] I would because it might be right there
[1:21:18] as it was with John Ryan
[1:21:20] when he was sitting there getting a
[1:21:22] shave and a haircut
[1:21:24] and he's blind as a bat
[1:21:26] yet he believed what God's Prophet told
[1:21:28] him is that right
[1:21:30] and they're ready to kill him in the
[1:21:31] barbershop making fun of him in the
[1:21:33] barbershop oh I heard you went doubt
[1:21:35] that Holy Roller meeting I heard she got
[1:21:36] healed yep praise the Lord right there
[1:21:38] well I heard yeah well how come you're
[1:21:40] still blind all of a sudden they're out
[1:21:42] of his mouth come this confession of
[1:21:43] faith and his eyes come open sitting
[1:21:45] right there in the barber chair Oh Glory
[1:21:47] to God here he goes running down the
[1:21:50] street with shaving cream all over his
[1:21:51] face and there goes the barber running
[1:21:53] right at you why he spoke his own
[1:21:56] Deliverance he was only one confession
[1:21:59] oh Hallelujah he was only one confession
[1:22:03] away from a full manifestation of his
[1:22:06] Deliverance
[1:22:10] wow
[1:22:13] well I gotta be honest
[1:22:16] yeah I do I'm a preacher
[1:22:19] and I study the word apartment well I
[1:22:22] fix this mic
[1:22:23] I studied the word
[1:22:25] I preached the word
[1:22:27] and I confess the word
[1:22:30] but just sometimes apparently I don't
[1:22:31] believe it
[1:22:35] oh you self-righteous Hypocrites it's
[1:22:37] going to sit down judge me answer
[1:22:41] you believe it up here but you're still
[1:22:44] afraid down here it won't happen
[1:22:48] it's absolutely amazing when you as a
[1:22:50] Believer start believing
[1:22:53] [Laughter]
[1:22:55] brother oh my God I cannot believe why
[1:22:57] I'm just being honest I'm just being
[1:22:59] honest what you need to be with yourself
[1:23:01] don't blame God I a lot of times it
[1:23:03] ain't in the devil's fault it's our
[1:23:06] fault
[1:23:08] don't have a negative testimony
[1:23:11] every time when you confess well I still
[1:23:13] feel bad today you go straight back in
[1:23:16] the same rut that you was had in the
[1:23:19] beginning
[1:23:19] there's not a man or woman in here
[1:23:21] baptized now listen to this
[1:23:24] with the Holy Spirit
[1:23:25] but what you start your confession I
[1:23:28] believe I've lost
[1:23:32] the Holy Spirit

[1:24:28] well you'll want some great Theologian
[1:24:30] to stand up and fill your head with a
[1:24:32] bunch of intellectual something or do we
[1:24:34] not to be able to hear the word of God
[1:24:36] that'll make what we've already heard so
[1:24:39] affection in our lives
[1:24:41] Oh Glory to God
[1:24:44] Hallelujah
[1:24:46] notices he says again let me skip down
[1:24:49] about a paragraph or so there's not a
[1:24:51] Christian in here no matter how solids

[1:24:54] that right now that you something
[1:24:55] happened to get a hold of you
[1:24:58] and you are not a Christian and you
[1:25:00] start testifying well I'm not a
[1:25:03] Christian no more
[1:25:04] you dropped right then you're no more a
[1:25:07] Christian anymore as soon as you testify
[1:25:11] that you're not a Christian you've
[1:25:13] dropped from Grace
[1:25:16] did God cut you off you did
[1:25:20] did the pastor cut you off you did
[1:25:23] what's what
[1:25:28] as soon as you testify you're not a
[1:25:31] Christian you drop From Grace right then
[1:25:33] you're Fallen
[1:25:35] your own speech
[1:25:38] tells what you are
[1:25:40] oh my
[1:25:44] well brother Donnie what can I do how
[1:25:47] can we be able to handle this look when
[1:25:48] God has even made it though we're still
[1:25:51] in these types of bodies that he will
[1:25:54] make your body obey your confession
[1:25:59] let's skip down again to our brothers
[1:26:00] let's go to who is God 1950 remember God
[1:26:03] will make your body
[1:26:05] come into
[1:26:08] your confession
[1:26:10] if you say you're a drunkard and want to
[1:26:12] drink don't worry you'll soon be one
[1:26:16] now notice he didn't say they were but
[1:26:19] they would soon be one because of their
[1:26:22] confession if you say you're a sinner
[1:26:24] and want to sin you'll be right into it
[1:26:26] if you say you're a Christian and
[1:26:27] believe it along God will bring your
[1:26:29] testimony will bring you right into it
[1:26:33] this is one reason I love to testify
[1:26:36] about the Rapture I love to testify
[1:26:39] about the change in power of God that's
[1:26:41] going to bring me right into it by the
[1:26:42] grace of the Lord
[1:26:44] God will make your body
[1:26:48] obey your confession
[1:26:52] now let's jump another and our brothers
[1:26:54] come down to Philemon chapter 1 verse 6.
[1:26:57] that the communication of thy faith may
[1:26:59] become effectual

[1:27:04] which is in you
[1:27:07] in Christ Jesus I don't know what to say
[1:27:16] now I may get fast and I may get so fast
[1:27:19] I sound like a Gatling gun but these
[1:27:22] will be on the notes

[1:27:31] brothers I'm
[1:27:33] forgiven

[1:27:42] well that's enough right there to take a
[1:27:44] series on I'm forgiven on what basis
[1:27:47] because he died that I could be I'm
[1:27:51] saved why I have accepted God's provided
[1:27:54] way for salvation which does not include
[1:27:57] feelings it says nothing about if you
[1:27:59] don't feel it you ain't got it it don't
[1:28:01] say nothing about them it works on

[1:29:12] it in the first place
[1:29:15] Hallelujah
[1:29:16] I am bought
[1:29:18] and purchased so I don't belong to

[1:35:49] since I've been receiving a check from
[1:35:51] Happy Valley Church
[1:35:53] I probably haven't signed that check a
[1:35:55] dozen times
[1:35:59] because there's someone else here who
[1:36:01] signs it
[1:36:04] as a matter of fact if I signed it
[1:36:06] they'd probably stop it at the bank
[1:36:07] because they'd say that ain't the
[1:36:09] signature we've been seeing for 35 years
[1:36:14] Hallelujah
[1:36:17] why she can go right there and deposit
[1:36:19] it in whose name in mind

[1:36:46] sign that thing and pull right up to the
[1:36:48] teller of Heaven say I need a good dose
[1:36:50] of the Holy Ghost today I need some
[1:36:52] Divine Healing in my body well go ahead
[1:36:54] and sign your chat oh well you say
[1:36:56] brother Donnie will they check our ID
[1:36:57] yep we already have an ID that's the
[1:36:59] blood of the Lord Jesus by the baptism
[1:37:01] of the Holy Ghost and whenever you pull
[1:37:03] up in there you know how it is now with
[1:37:04] what we've got today I've got to set up

[1:37:17] I've gotten more than that when it comes
[1:37:19] to my account in heaven so if I need
[1:37:21] healing I've got a face ID and but when
[1:37:24] the Lord looks he don't see my face he
[1:37:26] sees the face of the master he don't see
[1:37:28] your face and you sell all my flaws all
[1:37:31] my shortcomings that's right we've got
[1:37:32] scars we've got problems we've got
[1:37:34] trouble but he sees his face his face
[1:37:37] it's his face it opens everything you
[1:37:40] need
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:48] he will
[1:37:50] renew
[1:37:51] my strength
[1:37:59] I have value
[1:38:01] in God's eyes
[1:38:05] I am the Apple
[1:38:10] that does not mean what US westerners
[1:38:13] think
[1:38:14] that you're looking up in the apple tree
[1:38:16] which you'd have a hard time doing in
[1:38:17] the winter time wouldn't you
[1:38:19] so you look up in the apple tree and say
[1:38:21] oh I want that Apple so bad so bad oh no
[1:38:24] this Hebrew rendering here is not that
[1:38:26] you're looking on an apple tree
[1:38:27] it is actually the pupil in your eye
[1:38:30] called the Apple
[1:38:32] so I am the pupil
[1:38:34] of his eye
[1:38:36] when he looks out he looks to grace and
[1:38:39] mercy that's the way he sees me
[1:38:42] I'm not an apple hanging on a tree I'm
[1:38:45] an attribute from his soul
[1:38:47] a soul of God that was in God before the
[1:38:50] foundation of the world I am the apple
[1:38:52] of his eye well if I don't hurry ain't
[1:38:54] never going to get done I am accepted in
[1:38:58] Christ
[1:38:59] God will meet my needs
[1:39:03] I am
[1:39:05] the righteousness of God in him I hope
[1:39:09] every devil in the internet is suffocate
[1:39:11] time will you get done with this today I
[1:39:14] am
[1:39:16] God
[1:39:17] God he cares for me
[1:39:21] amen I am watched over boy I better not
[1:39:24] I've done got a whole bunch I don't need
[1:39:25] to get any more I'm an overcomer
[1:39:28] I have self-control the Lord is my
[1:39:33] strength he is my deliverer he will
[1:39:37] strengthen me he is my defense he is my
[1:39:43] refuge he is my peace he is my mediator
[1:39:48] he will work all things for my good I am
[1:39:54] his workmanship he will complete me
[1:39:58] I have a sound to mine I needed in the
[1:40:04] body of Christ he will keep me I'm his
[1:40:08] and he is mine
[1:40:14] praise the Lord
[1:40:18] I wonder what kind of homes would have
[1:40:21] what kind of church would have
[1:40:24] it would take all the so negative stuff
[1:40:26] out of our mouth
[1:40:27] out of our minds
[1:40:29] and go to talking like this
[1:40:36] it ain't no wonder
[1:40:38] I'll have to never go to a sermon
[1:40:40] together this morning
[1:40:41] it ain't no one to have the office time
[1:40:43] ever was sending it to myself it ain't
[1:40:46] no wonder I'd have Scotty my son-in-law
[1:40:49] even help me because it was all
[1:40:51] conglomerated in office biggest mess it
[1:40:53] ever was and letters was upside down and
[1:40:55] sideways and I thought what in the world

[1:49:17] how many wants to let this
[1:49:20] be your confession
[1:49:22] this is who I am God
[1:49:26] these are not from the words of some
[1:49:28] intellectual person you know I'm not
[1:49:30] that
[1:49:31] these are backed up by God's words
[1:49:35] God's words
[1:49:37] you're all that I said this morning
[1:49:40] and even more
[1:49:44] even more
[1:49:46] my goodness if we was just one third of
[1:49:48] all that it would be unbelievable would
[1:49:50] it not since we were nothing since we
[1:49:52] were Liars drunks homeowners and
[1:49:54] whatever more and we've become all of
[1:49:56] that I didn't even stretch the surface
[1:49:59] of what you are
[1:50:02] what could we become friends
[1:50:05] you imagine poor brother Philemon
[1:50:08] bless his heart he had been running
[1:50:10] through this church this morning hit of
[1:50:12] them doors have been flying wide open
[1:50:13] ever Deacon in here had been after him
[1:50:15] and if that had chased him out of the
[1:50:16] foyer brother fully mind probably headed
[1:50:18] up on the parking lot Johnson City
[1:50:20] police would be acting by now the rescue
[1:50:22] is going to said this man to start
[1:50:24] raving mad so what world happened to him
[1:50:26] he's listened to a holy ghost-filled
[1:50:28] preacher that began to tell him all he
[1:50:30] was in Christ Jesus he had a spell when
[1:50:32] Paul wrote him about 2000 years ago but
[1:50:34] now that the seals have been opened
[1:50:36] which wasn't open when Paul was here
[1:50:38] don't you see how much more it tells us
[1:50:40] what we are why you need that you need
[1:50:43] it we fight such discouragement in the
[1:50:46] day we're living we need to hear these
[1:50:48] things
[1:50:50] I need to hear that anybody else need to
[1:50:54] hear
[1:51:01] I'm too old to be a person like this
[1:51:08] another confession
[1:51:11] I am old but I'm fixing to be young
[1:51:21] oh Hallelujah
[1:51:26] let's pray
[1:51:34] dear Jesus
[1:51:39] thank you Lord
[1:51:42] thank you for what we've heard
[1:51:46] I've been wondering all week long
[1:51:49] as I'd sit down to steady where
[1:51:52] I thought I was going to go today
[1:51:55] I've been wondering why I just
[1:51:57] something just didn't seem right and I
[1:51:59] didn't know what it was
[1:52:02] even yesterday Lord sitting there last
[1:52:04] night studying
[1:52:06] this morning laying our Wide Awake Lord
[1:52:09] for ours
[1:52:10] pray Lord what is it what is it I don't
[1:52:13] understand
[1:52:15] dear Lord you started
[1:52:17] making it real to me
[1:52:20] thank you Father
[1:52:22] truly we needed to hear these things
[1:52:24] today
[1:52:27] foreign
[1:52:28] oh Jesus
[1:52:30] may we be changed by these things father
[1:52:34] may it not just be sayings that we write
[1:52:37] down
[1:52:38] but may it become Who We Are
[1:52:41] may we become so energized
[1:52:44] by the word being effectual in our lives
[1:52:48] granted father
[1:52:50] and which of us are different
[1:52:53] we have no record that you ever danced
[1:52:55] in the spirit when you were here
[1:52:57] we have no record that you ever fell out
[1:52:59] in the spirit we have no record that you
[1:53:01] run around the walls of Jericho and many
[1:53:04] of those things
[1:53:05] we have no record that Paul ever done
[1:53:07] any of that Peter James John
[1:53:10] and we don't believe that you're against
[1:53:11] that
[1:53:13] but father we know that people worship
[1:53:15] in different ways and we know those that
[1:53:16] tend to be so extremely emotional they
[1:53:19] tend to look at those that aren't they
[1:53:20] well they're not worshiping like I am
[1:53:22] well they're going to categorize them
[1:53:23] that they'd have to put you out and put
[1:53:25] Paul out
[1:53:26] because we have no record Paul ever
[1:53:28] danced in the spirit
[1:53:29] have no record that Peter Andrew John
[1:53:33] but I believe they worshiped you they
[1:53:36] praised you they adored you
[1:53:39] with all of their hearts
[1:53:42] so help us to move away from the
[1:53:44] carnality
[1:53:46] of wanting everybody to do like we do
[1:53:49] because we think we're the perfect
[1:53:51] example
[1:53:53] help us to realize
[1:53:55] your Prophet gives us that variety when
[1:53:57] he talks about Paul the scholarly
[1:53:59] preacher
[1:54:01] Peter being the Firebrand Andrew one way
[1:54:05] and John another way that's the way you
[1:54:08] made them
[1:54:09] no doubt there were people in that
[1:54:10] Apostolic church and they received the
[1:54:13] Holy Ghost and they danced and shouted
[1:54:15] and received the presence of God there
[1:54:18] was others that received the same spirit
[1:54:19] of God
[1:54:21] they might not have been near as
[1:54:22] emotional as the other
[1:54:24] but they didn't measure it so much by
[1:54:27] the way they expressed their emotion
[1:54:29] they measured it by the life they lived
[1:54:31] when they got done screaming and hard
[1:54:34] help us I pray father
[1:54:36] I don't want these people to be like me
[1:54:38] I don't want them to act like me I want
[1:54:41] them to be the way you want them to be
[1:54:45] now if there's some of them standing
[1:54:46] here today Lord and they're scared of
[1:54:48] emotion and they're scared oh if I turn
[1:54:50] loose I'd scream and holler I pray you
[1:54:53] would change them from that
[1:54:55] but if they're standing here today and
[1:54:56] say Lord if you want me to run I'll run
[1:54:58] if you want me to scream I'll scream
[1:54:59] don't let me jump straight up and down
[1:55:00] I'll jump straight up and down but Lord
[1:55:03] it'll take you to move me that way well
[1:55:05] they're just as willing as the person
[1:55:06] who does it
[1:55:08] because that's what you're looking for a
[1:55:10] willing heart
[1:55:12] so if you want to dance a shout us jump
[1:55:15] us run us whatever you want to do we're
[1:55:17] here today we're fine with that
[1:55:19] if you want us to stand here and cry and
[1:55:21] tickle tree tears trickling down our
[1:55:24] eyes as we Rejoice over what we've heard
[1:55:26] today I'm willing to do that too
[1:55:30] oh Lord God we bless you father
[1:55:33] we worship you
[1:55:36] I'm a worshiper we can add more to our
[1:55:39] confession today I'm a worshiper I'm
[1:55:42] ordained to be a worshiper
[1:55:45] Hallelujah so we'll praise we will adore
[1:55:50] we will magnify your name some have been
[1:55:52] ordained
[1:55:54] that their testimony would be healed and
[1:55:56] delivered from cancer
[1:55:58] some have been ordained we know the
[1:56:00] blind man whatever the disciples said
[1:56:01] Lord who sinned this man or his parents
[1:56:05] he said neither one
[1:56:07] but the glory of God might be made
[1:56:09] manifest
[1:56:12] Lord God I wouldn't want have to go
[1:56:13] through what brother John's Spencers
[1:56:15] went through for nothing in the world
[1:56:19] Lord God sometimes going before he ever
[1:56:21] goes to the pulpit
[1:56:23] vomit eight ten times before he ever
[1:56:25] gets there
[1:56:26] I've sat by him on the platform and his
[1:56:28] sugar goes through the roof
[1:56:30] and then other times bottom out
[1:56:35] yeah Lord we believe
[1:56:37] you're going to manifest a miracle
[1:56:40] and our brother's body we know he's a
[1:56:41] miracle every day
[1:56:43] the doctors are absolutely astounded by
[1:56:45] why he's even living
[1:56:47] but Lord we're waiting for you to finish
[1:56:49] it up
[1:56:51] same with others that we're praying for
[1:56:53] father

[1:56:59] strength and all of that but we've been
[1:57:01] giving you praise for a long time for
[1:57:04] that well body
[1:57:05] because I got pictures of her on my
[1:57:07] phone my picture that I look at when I
[1:57:10] text her when I call her because her
[1:57:12] hair hanging back down her back
[1:57:14] Hallelujah not a look of sickness on her
[1:57:17] face
[1:57:18] but the lookness of a well body the
[1:57:21] expression of a whale body Hallelujah
