[47:13] we'll turn down to Mark
[47:17] 16 Malachi it says who is there even
[47:21] among you that could shut that would
[47:22] shut the doors for not neither do the
[47:24] Kindle Fire on mine Altar for not I have
[47:27] no pleasure in you say the Lord of hosts
[47:29] neither will I accept an offering at
[47:32] your
[47:33] hand for from the rising of the sun even
[47:36] unto the going down of the same my name
[47:38] shall be great among the Gentiles and in
[47:41] every place incense shall be offered
[47:43] unto my name and a pure offering for my
[47:46] name shall be great among the Heathen
[47:49] sayith the Lord of hosts that's you and
[47:54] me we are we are the Gentiles that he
[47:56] said that he would place his name
[47:58] amongst and it would be great amongst
[47:59] the Gentiles Mark
[48:01] 16 we'll read
[48:05] 15-8 and he said unto them go ye into
[48:08] the world and preach the gospel to every
[48:09] creature and he that believeth in his
[48:10] baptized shall be saved but he that
[48:12] believeth not shall be damned and these
[48:15] signs shall follow them that believe in
[48:17] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[48:20] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[48:22] take up servants serpents and if they
[48:24] drink in the deadly thing it shall not
[48:26] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[48:27] sick and they shall recover you can be
[48:30] seated may the Lord bless his
[48:32] word this morning I I'd like to speak on
[48:35] a on a thought the power of a
[48:38] name and we read there in Malachi we
[48:40] know at this point God had wanted for
[48:43] many years and generations to put his
[48:45] name amongst the children of
[48:47] Israel that was they were his people
[48:49] they were his love and and every time
[48:51] that he would want to put his name
[48:53] there they would turn against him we we
[48:57] you look at the children of Israel their
[48:59] Journey out of out of Egypt and how they
[49:03] turned against God and all that and God
[49:04] still forgave him many times and gave
[49:07] him the land that they that they wanted
[49:09] and fought their battles for him and
[49:10] then they turn him down and he would
[49:12] bring them back still a great desire and
[49:17] and that's kind of what he does you and
[49:19] I
[49:21] sometimes so many times God wants to to
[49:23] move in your life to put his name in
[49:25] your life there's no greater name the
[49:27] Bible says there's that's the name that
[49:29] all should be
[49:30] saved there's no greater name on
[49:34] Earth that's the name you're healed by
[49:36] that's the name you're delivered by
[49:37] that's the name you get Redemption by
[49:40] and God wanted to give that name to them
[49:43] and they would not and then he says from
[49:44] the rising of the sun even going down
[49:45] the same my name shall be great amongst
[49:48] the
[49:50] Gentiles brother brandom said in Mary's
[49:53] belief oh Lord as we Fellowship around
[49:55] these things know that it's not just
[49:57] some kind of a story it's not some kind
[50:00] of a mythical story or Superstition
[50:03] among people but he is alive tonight
[50:06] he's here tonight just as real as he was
[50:08] in Galilee he cannot
[50:10] fail his name has been given above every
[50:14] name in heavens and earth all the family
[50:18] if you are family is named
[50:21] Jesus you have been given his
[50:25] name you know when you look at it when
[50:28] you me and brother brother darl was
[50:30] talking all ago there's so many people
[50:32] in churches Millions around the world
[50:34] this morning that have gathered in what
[50:37] they would call his
[50:39] name they have prayed in his name for
[50:42] the prayer request that come
[50:44] forth they have bowed their head and
[50:47] said Lord would you meet with us here
[50:53] today they'll even go out to eat and
[50:55] they'll pray for their food in his
[50:57] name but they are not in his name
[51:02] right you know we we we we look at that
[51:05] and and they they claim they belong to
[51:07] them you know we look at how Jesus how
[51:10] God wanted to put his name in the church
[51:13] and we we know we revelation we read in
[51:15] Revelations we see what happened to the
[51:17] church how God put away put her away
[51:20] because she would not and we we look at
[51:23] that and in and people that are sitting
[51:26] sincere people are sitting in churches
[51:28] this morning denominational churches
[51:29] praying in his
[51:31] name believing he'll come believing
[51:34] he'll he'll move in the service for them
[51:37] and he
[51:39] might but he does not recognize them as
[51:42] his
[51:45] wife same thing is happening in mess's
[51:50] churches they walk
[51:52] in they sit down they pray over the
[51:54] prayer request
[51:57] they invite him Lord be with us this
[51:59] morning be with us
[52:03] tonight and then they don't give him
[52:06] anything they don't give him the worship
[52:10] the Adoration the praise that he
[52:14] deserves amen do you realize that's
[52:16] that's what all God wants from us is
[52:18] fellowship we've said that if you don't
[52:20] know that by now that's all God wants
[52:22] from us is fellowship that's why he put
[52:24] his name in you so you would with
[52:26] fellowship with
[52:29] him trying to do God a service brother
[52:31] BR said there's only one meeting place
[52:33] where God meets man one meeting place
[52:36] and that's when he's in Jesus Christ and
[52:38] the only way that you are in Jesus
[52:40] Christ if Jesus Christ has put his name
[52:41] in
[52:42] you that's the only way he'll meet you
[52:45] there so you can't come in the form
[52:48] of of denomination of the Harlot and say
[52:52] I want to meet with you
[52:54] Jesus they had their
[52:57] chance and they turned him away yeah you
[53:01] know just because you you say that
[53:02] you're in the name we look at how Paul
[53:04] talks about the the Vagabond Jews there
[53:07] in Acts
[53:08] 19 what what would the the Jew what were
[53:11] they doing they were trying to cast out
[53:12] demons in Jesus
[53:14] name they were they were doing seemed
[53:17] like a good work they were they were
[53:19] telling these demons to come out in the
[53:21] name of
[53:23] Jesus that's what they're doing a
[53:26] message churches right
[53:28] now and Jesus don't know
[53:31] them this is what they're doing they're
[53:34] trying to cast out demons they're trying
[53:36] to heal the sick they're trying to
[53:38] deliver people in jesus' name and what
[53:42] did what did what did these demons these
[53:44] demons spoke back to these Jews and told
[53:46] them Jesus we know Paul we know but who
[53:49] are
[53:52] you if the devil don't know you you
[53:55] probably don't have the the name
[53:58] right that's who he
[54:00] knows he knows Jesus and if Jesus has
[54:03] become a part of you in
[54:05] here if you have taken the name what
[54:09] have we been hearing preached in the
[54:10] last two three months about Boaz given
[54:13] his name to
[54:15] Ruth that's what Jesus has done for you
[54:18] he's giving you his name he's he's found
[54:20] that place and they said that's the only
[54:21] place where God will meet
[54:23] you he won't meet you in a building
[54:28] he won't meet you just because you're a
[54:29] good
[54:30] person some of the finest people I know
[54:34] I've worked with with some denominal
[54:36] Christians that put some of us to shame
[54:38] their moral their moral compass is is is
[54:41] set so
[54:42] straight you can't touch their life with
[54:46] anything except they don't have the
[54:49] name they haven't accepted the name and
[54:52] you've got people sitting in churches
[54:53] pushing play thinking they're doing it
[54:55] in Jesus name
[54:59] yeah preach it brother it's not just
[55:01] about asking him to meet your
[55:07] needs it's about being in his name amen
[55:11] that's where the power comes from God
[55:13] knows who his bride
[55:18] is in 2 Timothy 21 19 it says
[55:21] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[55:23] ass sure having the seal the Lord know
[55:26] knoweth them that are his let everyone
[55:28] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[55:31] from iniquity so if you're praying in
[55:32] his name you're saying I mean his name
[55:35] your life will show it your your life
[55:38] will show that that you're
[55:40] not that you've taken the
[55:43] name right by the fruits you'll know
[55:45] them the works that you'll do if you're
[55:49] in his name you will do the same works
[55:51] that he did when Jesus said I'll go away
[55:53] but I'll come back and when I come back
[55:55] I'll be with you even in you Greater
[55:56] Works than this shall you
[55:58] do why because that name is in you
[56:01] that's the power of the name it ain't
[56:03] you you have no abilities we can lay our
[56:05] hands on on the sick you've got
[56:07] something how many times do people come
[56:09] up to to be in prayer with in the prayer
[56:11] line brother Brandon and brother Brandon
[56:12] would catch that that they had something
[56:13] in their
[56:15] life they had unconfessed sin in their
[56:18] life the name couldn't move with that
[56:21] sin
[56:22] there that unconfessed sin amen the name
[56:26] takes that
[56:28] away the Redemptive part of the name
[56:31] takes that
[56:32] away but people walk up before before
[56:35] the prophet and he says you've got
[56:36] unconfessed sin in your
[56:38] life you know sometimes you wonder if
[56:40] that's why things in our life a ain't
[56:43] happening we got things in our life
[56:44] shouldn't be there we got things you you
[56:47] you come in you're asking you're praying
[56:49] for God to do this praying for God to do
[56:51] that check your life is your life lining
[56:54] up with the name
[56:57] if he is in you the works that he do you
[56:59] will
[57:00] do it's not you anyway it's it's not
[57:03] it's not about us it's it's not the the
[57:06] the life that we live every day we're
[57:08] good people if God is in you you will do
[57:11] what he does his light will reflect out
[57:14] of your life
[57:17] amen I think we take it for granted
[57:19] sometimes it becomes
[57:21] tradition even praying over food becomes
[57:24] tradition
[57:26] you know I'm guilty I'm guilty I say
[57:29] some quick prayers over my food CU I'm
[57:32] hungry we all do
[57:35] yes and then some of you be honest
[57:38] you're saying the same prayer you've
[57:39] been saying for the last 40 years oh
[57:41] my come on I
[57:44] amen yes but it becomes tradition do we
[57:47] do we sit and think about what we're
[57:49] saying amen do we take the the one that
[57:53] gave us the name do we take it for
[57:55] granted
[57:59] we we want to we want to ask him for
[58:02] things Lord we help us we're going on a
[58:05] trip keep us safe travels we do that we
[58:08] say our nightly prayers we get down at
[58:10] night and we say our prayers Lord thank
[58:11] you for the day help us to have a good
[58:13] sleep wake me up safely in the morning
[58:16] or however you do
[58:18] yours but it becomes tradition and we
[58:20] don't realize this this name that we're
[58:22] taking for granted and do you realize
[58:24] what the name has done for you
[58:27] do we realize what you received when you
[58:29] took on the
[58:31] name and so many times we give him back
[58:34] so
[58:36] little let me ask you if you if you were
[58:40] on a heart transplant
[58:43] list and doctors gave you three months
[58:47] and they found a heart for you and you
[58:48] you received a heart from
[58:51] somebody and they said this heart will
[58:53] probably let you live another hundred
[58:55] years
[58:58] how grateful would you be for the person
[59:01] that donated that
[59:03] heart how
[59:05] grateful and yet you you got somebody
[59:07] that has donated eternal life to
[59:11] you eternal life in his name he giving
[59:14] it to
[59:17] you do we wake up every morning thinking
[59:20] about
[59:21] that do we wake up every morning and say
[59:23] Lord thank you for the day and then all
[59:26] all right away we start thinking about
[59:28] the stuff we have to do that day and we
[59:30] don't think about him again till
[59:31] lunchtime when we say our little
[59:33] traditional prayer over our food we
[59:35] don't think of him again until we sit
[59:37] down at supper we say the same prayer we
[59:39] said at lunch yeah and then we lay down
[59:42] and we say the same prayer we've been
[59:43] saying for 30 years as we go to
[59:46] sleep it's
[59:49] tradition we take the name that's been
[59:51] given to us for granted
[59:54] amen we get caught into
[59:58] Traditions whenever
[1:00:01] you whenever you receive that name
[1:00:04] change you will receive if you truly
[1:00:07] have received a name
[1:00:10] change it will change your

[1:02:26] if you've had a true name change when
[1:02:29] you are by yourself you will be exactly
[1:02:31] how you are when you're sitting in
[1:02:33] here because it's his life in you it's
[1:02:37] not you anyway you know we we look at
[1:02:40] the scripture and we hear the the
[1:02:42] scripture when Jesus when God tells him
[1:02:45] says it the battle's mine it's not yours
[1:02:47] let me fight it for you that's the times
[1:02:49] that we want the name when we're in a
[1:02:51] battle that's when we want that name to
[1:02:54] take effect in our life Lord I'm I'm in
[1:02:56] a battle and that's the only time we
[1:02:57] ever call out the name that's the only
[1:02:59] time we get serious about the name is
[1:03:01] when things are real dire in our
[1:03:03] life things are real bad and we don't
[1:03:06] know what to
[1:03:07] do
[1:03:08] yes and our character gets
[1:03:11] seesawed when everything's good we
[1:03:13] switch back to who we really
[1:03:18] are we all need a character
[1:03:20] change we all need the name to take over
[1:03:24] our character amen
[1:03:27] but when you re really want to be a
[1:03:29] Christian Stand Out make it real that's
[1:03:32] what God wants you to
[1:03:35] be that'll
[1:03:37] prove your Works will prove what your
[1:03:39] character is your character is known by
[1:03:41] The Works that you
[1:03:44] do I was telling brother Daryl a while
[1:03:47] ago when brother brother BR said hear
[1:03:49] you hear you
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:52] him when you become sons of God that's
[1:03:54] just the start
[1:03:57] yeah from then on it's your character
[1:04:00] that's that's what makes the difference
[1:04:03] it's your
[1:04:05] character brother brandom also said in
[1:04:07] the unity of one God in one church when
[1:04:08] God takes control of your heart he takes
[1:04:11] control of your character when his name
[1:04:13] has been placed in you the name has
[1:04:16] control amen the name has control it's
[1:04:20] not you
[1:04:21] anymore why it ain't that you got to
[1:04:23] fight through it it any it when the name
[1:04:26] has control you don't have to
[1:04:30] fight cuz you let him have it
[1:04:33] all you you you you don't have to fight
[1:04:35] to pray now the devil Devil's going to
[1:04:37] he's going to put up a buffer you're not
[1:04:38] going to get through but it's your
[1:04:40] desire it's your desire that pushes
[1:04:47] through what is our
[1:04:51] character but Raam said in the token
[1:04:53] your character is God's character
[1:04:57] if you have taken on that
[1:05:01] name in identification Bram said the
[1:05:05] word is the
[1:05:08] character so is the word born in here is
[1:05:11] the word birth in here you know so many
[1:05:14] times our our true character comes out
[1:05:17] our true character comes out in church
[1:05:19] this is where shows you where we are
[1:05:20] really are sometimes like I said earlier
[1:05:23] you invite him in you pray pray with a
[1:05:26] prayer request you sit down and you
[1:05:27] don't he gets no more praise the rest of
[1:05:29] the
[1:05:31] service he gets no more praise come
[1:05:34] on gu no more
[1:05:37] worship you get upset when somebody
[1:05:39] shouts around you you don't have the
[1:05:42] name you can say you do all you don't
[1:05:44] all you want to you don't have the name
[1:05:46] if worship upsets you you don't have the
[1:05:51] name but the deal is is is our character
[1:05:55] we need God's
[1:05:57] character brother said the only the what
[1:05:59] you'll take with you when you leave here
[1:06:01] is your character if you don't worship
[1:06:02] him you're not going to worship worship
[1:06:04] Him in heaven if you don't say Amen here
[1:06:07] to the word you're not going to say Amen
[1:06:09] there if you're just a na and a half
[1:06:12] master that's what you're going to do
[1:06:13] when you look at Christ on the other
[1:06:15] side come on that's your character
[1:06:17] that's what you
[1:06:21] take how about listen list if you want
[1:06:24] to use your real character
[1:06:26] let let's give the the character that
[1:06:27] you give to your
[1:06:28] vs to
[1:06:32] God you shot your shoes off when they
[1:06:36] hit a
[1:06:38] p they score a touchdown your hair pins
[1:06:41] fly
[1:06:43] everywhere come
[1:06:45] on come on can you not give that effort
[1:06:49] to God the one that saved your life
[1:07:00] what happens when you invite him here
[1:07:02] and you don't give him the worship you
[1:07:04] don't give him the praise you done
[1:07:05] exactly what Simon did in the
[1:07:08] Bible Simon knew who he was knew his
[1:07:11] name invited him in told people Jesus is
[1:07:16] here Jesus is here and left him unw
[1:07:20] worshiped unpraised
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] you have the same Spirit of
[1:07:28] Simon when you don't worship him when
[1:07:31] you don't praise him oh my you can sit
[1:07:33] there and get upset Lord but that is the
[1:07:36] God's honest truth amen if you don't
[1:07:39] worship him you don't praise him and you
[1:07:41] have invited him
[1:07:43] here you have the spirit of
[1:07:48] Simon we have to become one with the
[1:07:52] name you know we we we look out how long
[1:07:54] God wanted
[1:07:56] greatest desire as we said earlier was
[1:07:59] was to have
[1:08:00] Fellowship that was his greatest desire
[1:08:03] and is and that's why he he spoke let it
[1:08:05] be let there be light let there be this
[1:08:07] let because his greatest desire that was
[1:08:09] his his start to you when the very first
[1:08:12] thought God had of you he said let there
[1:08:13] be
[1:08:15] light because it was in you that he
[1:08:17] wanted to place his
[1:08:19] name God didn't come up with with his
[1:08:21] name later on oh man I need a name now
[1:08:27] when he thought of his name in the back
[1:08:29] of his mind was when he thought of
[1:08:32] you and that's where he wanted to put
[1:08:34] his name
[1:08:36] amen God had a plan brother Donnie said
[1:08:38] the other other day how God had a plan
[1:08:41] and he had to hide it from
[1:08:43] Satan so look look at the plan that God
[1:08:46] started just to put his name in
[1:08:50] you marriage and divorce brother Brandon
[1:08:52] made the comment that God allowed Eve to
[1:08:56] be how she was so she would fall yeah it
[1:09:00] had to happen
[1:09:03] yeah so look at the conference brother
[1:09:05] brandham says in in when she fell and
[1:09:07] Adam fell by his own choice and he calls
[1:09:10] him in the garden this may seem like I'm
[1:09:12] going on a tangent but I'll be back I'm
[1:09:15] the king of
[1:09:17] tangents okay so God calls a conference
[1:09:19] in the
[1:09:21] garden and when God calls this
[1:09:23] conference Satan is there too
[1:09:27] and he tells
[1:09:28] Satan her seed will bruise your head God
[1:09:33] didn't put a name on that seed yeah God
[1:09:36] didn't say there's going to come one and
[1:09:38] I'm going to call his name Jesus yeah
[1:09:40] and he's going to and he's going to
[1:09:42] destroy you he just said her
[1:09:45] seed so what does Satan do from that
[1:09:48] point on Satan decides I've got to find
[1:09:50] that seed and destroy
[1:09:52] it that was his main mission to destroy
[1:09:55] that seed he tried to destroy the seed
[1:09:57] in in
[1:10:00] Abel you'll never destroy God God has a
[1:10:03] way of moving that seed
[1:10:05] around so he tried to destroy that seed
[1:10:08] in able and then we look just condense
[1:10:11] this
[1:10:12] down we we we look at at how God moved
[1:10:15] that seed and then no doubt Noah he when
[1:10:18] Noah got on the ark Satan goes I got it
[1:10:20] narrowed down to eight
[1:10:22] people actually Four the males I've got
[1:10:25] this this narrowed
[1:10:27] down but Noah gets drunk so how can the
[1:10:29] seed come through Noah
[1:10:33] yeah see Satan's thing that he looks at
[1:10:36] you is your imperfections how can you be
[1:10:38] seed for the things you're
[1:10:41] doing you'll be flesh till you get out
[1:10:44] of here you will make a mistake probably
[1:10:47] one millisecond before the Rapture takes
[1:10:49] place so don't think when you you have
[1:10:52] that name consumed in in every being
[1:10:55] that you are that you're not going to
[1:10:56] make a mistake God understands this
[1:10:59] flesh we're not taking it with
[1:11:05] us so God wanted a
[1:11:08] name let me back this up and then we'll
[1:11:11] continue with
[1:11:12] that in respects he said Mo Moses was
[1:11:15] scared to go down again Moses was 80
[1:11:18] years old now he had been gone 40 years
[1:11:20] and when he talked to God at the burning
[1:11:21] bush he said who will I tell them has
[1:11:23] sent me God had no name
[1:11:26] God had no name that's right how many
[1:11:29] thought God had a name in the Old
[1:11:31] Testament I
[1:11:33] did I'd never read this till I started
[1:11:36] studying this God had no
[1:11:39] name who will I tell them sent me he
[1:11:42] said the god of your fathers appeared to
[1:11:43] me they'll say who is the god of your
[1:11:46] fathers tell them he said you tell them
[1:11:49] that I am that I
[1:11:54] am remembering the Lord in 63 Israel had
[1:11:57] another thing they could always
[1:11:59] remember then they took their step on
[1:12:01] what they heard Moses say the great
[1:12:03] Vindicated Prophet with the word of God
[1:12:05] when they took their stand to March
[1:12:08] because they seen God vindicate that
[1:12:10] message when he was bringing the truth
[1:12:11] and it was according to the scriptures
[1:12:13] and God was with him and he had met this
[1:12:16] one who had no name called I
[1:12:21] am now I believe God had a name he just
[1:12:24] never told nobody
[1:12:26] yeah Mary was the first one he
[1:12:29] told this is the
[1:12:33] name
[1:12:35] right he had met this one who had no
[1:12:37] name called the I am he had really met
[1:12:40] him because they had seen him working in
[1:12:42] Moses so now we know that God is going
[1:12:45] to
[1:12:46] move this seed down
[1:12:49] through his people this was his people
[1:12:52] this the ones where he wanted to put his
[1:12:54] name that was his God's desire I want to
[1:12:57] put my name among you I want to dwell
[1:13:00] among you I want you to build me this
[1:13:01] Tabernacle and I want you to do it this
[1:13:03] way with the labor and the Brazen Altar
[1:13:05] and all that and and the holiest of
[1:13:06] holies and Behind These skins I want to
[1:13:08] dwell
[1:13:10] there I want to be with you I want to be
[1:13:13] among you I want to be as closest to you
[1:13:14] as I can
[1:13:19] get then we we look at it we move on
[1:13:22] down to
[1:13:23] Judah and maybe
[1:13:25] I I can't sit here and tell you who all
[1:13:27] satan suspected was was the seed or not
[1:13:30] I always thought maybe he job was so
[1:13:32] perfect maybe Satan thought he was the
[1:13:34] seed but I can't but I can tell you
[1:13:37] where God took the seed down through the
[1:13:39] line of
[1:13:41] Judah and then we Satan look at that and
[1:13:44] we we we see
[1:13:46] that Tamar plays a
[1:13:49] harlot and seduces Judah well that's not
[1:13:52] like God that can't be God's seed
[1:13:55] yeah and that seed continues down and
[1:13:57] comes through a gentile
[1:14:00] Harlot there's no way God would run a
[1:14:03] seed through
[1:14:05] that then he moves it up to to
[1:14:09] Ruth a
[1:14:11] moabitas a
[1:14:13] gentile there's no
[1:14:16] way on now it comes up through
[1:14:19] David murder
[1:14:21] adulter right there's no way
[1:14:28] and then look at all the evil Kings
[1:14:31] after
[1:14:34] David this King did evil in the sight of
[1:14:36] the Lord this King did evil in the sight
[1:14:39] of the Lord this King did evil in the
[1:14:40] side of the Lord and God took his name
[1:14:42] right through
[1:14:44] him why he was hiding that
[1:14:48] seed God wasn't going to hide that seed
[1:14:52] forever God said man will know my
[1:14:58] name so he brings the seat on
[1:15:05] down and there was a time God decided to
[1:15:08] reveal that seed God's still revealing
[1:15:10] his seed
[1:15:12] today lifted him up on high and said
[1:15:14] look here's Satan right here he is and
[1:15:17] now I've given him a
[1:15:19] name God's chosen place of
[1:15:23] worship but where did he put his
[1:15:28] name what is his name we'll have to find
[1:15:31] God's name what God's name is before we
[1:15:34] find where he's putting it in the
[1:15:37] place now we find out that he had many
[1:15:40] titles he is called Father which is a
[1:15:42] title he was called son which is a title
[1:15:45] he was called Holy Ghost which is a
[1:15:46] title he was called Rose of Sharon which
[1:15:49] is the title lily of the valley Morning
[1:15:52] Star Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RFA seven
[1:15:54] different compound Redemptive names all
[1:15:56] of them were titles none of them were
[1:15:58] names but he has a
[1:16:01] name and we find out that Jesus said
[1:16:05] also I came in my father's name and you
[1:16:06] receed me not then the name of the
[1:16:08] father must be Jesus all
[1:16:11] right the name of the father is Jesus
[1:16:13] because Jesus said so I'll carry my
[1:16:16] father's name I come in my father's name
[1:16:18] you receive me not that his name was
[1:16:19] Jesus Gabriel called him Jesus the
[1:16:22] prophets called him Jesus he was
[1:16:24] absolutely Jesus
[1:16:25] before his birth even the holy prophet
[1:16:27] called him Emmanuel which is God With Us
[1:16:30] and God was manifested in flesh in order
[1:16:32] to take away the sin of the world and
[1:16:33] doing so he was given the name of Jesus
[1:16:37] God was given the name
[1:16:39] Jesus amen
[1:16:42] amen the name was placed in a man not a
[1:16:45] church not a denomination not a Creed
[1:16:47] but a man he chose to place his name in
[1:16:50] Jesus Christ now we find out that when
[1:16:53] he becomes the place of God worship
[1:16:55] where you worship him so if you worship
[1:16:58] Him in spirit and
[1:16:59] Truth like the prophet just said you
[1:17:02] worship him that means you have the name
[1:17:05] here that's the only way you can worship
[1:17:08] him where God placed his
[1:17:11] name so Gabriel comes to marry she's not
[1:17:14] married yet and tells her you're going
[1:17:16] to you're going to receive a child you
[1:17:19] got to understand God created the egg
[1:17:21] God created the cell
[1:17:25] and he moved his life into
[1:17:28] them he joined them together there was a
[1:17:30] union of the egg and the sail and then
[1:17:33] God puts his own
[1:17:34] life in that you talking about a mighty
[1:17:38] God when we think how big and how great
[1:17:41] God is that you you know you see
[1:17:42] pictures of him holding his hand the
[1:17:44] world on this big huge God but yet he
[1:17:46] made himself so small that he put his
[1:17:48] life into a
[1:17:50] sale for 9
[1:17:53] months and then Mary birthed
[1:17:57] God some people think he wasn't God
[1:18:00] until he got baptized in the dev came
[1:18:02] down the Holy Spirit came upon him I got
[1:18:04] a quote where brother brandom said God
[1:18:06] was born in
[1:18:08] Bethlehem so God allmighty God the
[1:18:12] Creator is born a
[1:18:16] baby and then she holds Mary holds this
[1:18:19] little
[1:18:20] baby looks into the eyes of God and
[1:18:22] calls him Jesus
[1:18:26] she's holding
[1:18:29] God she's holding the
[1:18:32] word she's looking into the eyes of the
[1:18:36] word amen and calls him the name that
[1:18:40] was given to
[1:18:41] him God's
[1:18:47] name but brandom said in conference with
[1:18:50] God God dwells in
[1:18:53] humility not in p that's always been the
[1:18:55] devil's idea God comes in humility
[1:18:57] that'll be a sign not a Lesser God but a
[1:19:00] man he cried like a baby when he was a
[1:19:03] baby he played in the streets like a boy
[1:19:06] when he was a boy he worked in the
[1:19:07] carpenter shop with Joseph as a man at
[1:19:09] work he eat when he was hungry he
[1:19:11] sweated when he was hot he cried when he
[1:19:13] was sorrowful he was a
[1:19:16] man this will be a sign to you God will
[1:19:19] dwell with
[1:19:20] you in a humble not a great big uppity
[1:19:23] man but a little low man with no
[1:19:29] background be careful of a man that
[1:19:31] wants to tell you how much and
[1:19:33] everything he's
[1:19:35] done I've done this I've done that God
[1:19:38] don't dwell in that God dwells in
[1:19:41] humility let me tell you what God has
[1:19:43] done amen let me tell you the works that
[1:19:46] God's done God's God's not here to to
[1:19:48] put you on a billboard we're here to put
[1:19:51] him on a billboard
[1:19:55] that's the stroke of the devil right
[1:19:57] there when a death stroke to every
[1:19:59] denomination and pomp all Pomp and Glory
[1:20:02] of this world is a Deathstroke that the
[1:20:03] god of Heaven chose to came come that
[1:20:05] way that's what happened at the
[1:20:07] conference it had to be decided that's
[1:20:09] the way he chose to come he didn't have
[1:20:11] to come that way he was the god of
[1:20:13] heaven but he chose to come as a baby he
[1:20:15] chose to come that way that's what
[1:20:17] happened at the conference in
[1:20:21] heaven so we see that he comes down this
[1:20:24] this Lamb of God this is the one that's
[1:20:27] going to take away the sin of the world
[1:20:30] and John tells him when he comes down
[1:20:31] the river Behold the Lamb that takes
[1:20:33] away the sin of the
[1:20:34] world John saying this is the one that's
[1:20:36] going to bruise the Serpent's head this
[1:20:39] is
[1:20:41] him do you realize who John was I wonder
[1:20:45] if John ever realized when he seen Jesus
[1:20:46] walking down that he looked at Jesus and
[1:20:49] said this is the one that raised me from
[1:20:51] the dead when I was in my mom's
[1:20:53] womb amen yes sir the mention of that
[1:20:57] name that's the power of the name the
[1:20:59] mention of that name gave John Life John
[1:21:01] was dead in the womb of
[1:21:02] Elizabeth and that spoken word with Mary
[1:21:05] speaks the name of
[1:21:08] God she didn't speak just an everyday
[1:21:11] given name of her neighbor or something
[1:21:13] she spoke the name of God and when she
[1:21:17] spoke the name of God life came into a
[1:21:20] dead
[1:21:21] baby then the baby that received life
[1:21:25] is now about to baptize
[1:21:28] him the one that's going to bruise the

[1:24:45] revelation of who I am because I'm going
[1:24:47] to tell you who you
[1:24:48] are you are
[1:24:52] him you are him
[1:24:55] amen so when Satan comes to you and
[1:24:57] tells you everything you've done he's
[1:25:01] accusing
[1:25:04] God if you've received the full baptism
[1:25:07] of the Holy Spirit his life is in
[1:25:09] you he became you so you could become
[1:25:13] him
[1:25:15] right and you

[1:25:20] God of things you've done that you've
[1:25:23] already repented of that you put into
[1:25:29] hell please remember who you
[1:25:33] are don't leave here today until you
[1:25:36] know for sure who you
[1:25:41] are amen how do you get the
[1:25:45] name how do you get that name there has
[1:25:48] to be a
[1:25:49] union there has to be a union
[1:25:55] when a groom a boy and a girl they date
[1:25:58] for a
[1:25:59] while they get to know one
[1:26:01] another if she loves him
[1:26:06] enough she'll want his
[1:26:10] name she'll want to take on his name if
[1:26:13] he loves her enough he'll want to give
[1:26:19] it that's how Union
[1:26:21] happens when it's a mutual desire
[1:26:25] I want your
[1:26:26] name and you want to give
[1:26:30] it that's the only way a true Union with
[1:26:34] God works was you when you want his name
[1:26:38] and he truly wants to give
[1:26:40] it that's when you get the power of the
[1:26:44] name that's when both your names go on
[1:26:47] the
[1:26:48] check that's when that check doesn't
[1:26:50] require two signatures just
[1:26:53] one when there's a marriage and now we
[1:26:56] have mutual
[1:26:59] property that's the way to step if you
[1:27:01] didn't know as s state of Tennessee
[1:27:03] looks if you're married Mutual property
[1:27:05] so ladies you want to sell his
[1:27:07] motorcycle you got the
[1:27:10] right or his dog or his guns or
[1:27:19] whatever so we've been looking
[1:27:23] at recently we've been looking at
[1:27:25] brother Donnie's been preaching so much
[1:27:26] on Boaz and
[1:27:29] Ruth when you look at
[1:27:32] that we look we look at the conference
[1:27:35] there at the gate the meeting at the
[1:27:36] gate when Boaz is sitting there with to
[1:27:38] and the
[1:27:39] other other men of the
[1:27:42] city and he comes to to and says are you
[1:27:45] going to
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:47] redeem all that was
[1:27:50] meons all to could thinking of was
[1:27:53] property
[1:27:55] possessions that's what to wanted
[1:27:58] property and
[1:27:59] possessions all Boaz wanted was to give
[1:28:01] Ruth his name right that's all he
[1:28:05] wanted all satan wants from you is
[1:28:08] possessions he could never pay the price
[1:28:10] to couldn't pay this price Devil
[1:28:12] Couldn't pay the price why his name is
[1:28:14] not Eternal Satan's name is not Eternal
[1:28:17] he couldn't give you an eternal name and
[1:28:20] that's the price that had to be paid a
[1:28:22] price that would be paid so that God
[1:28:24] could put upon you a name that was
[1:28:28] eternal Bo Boaz says I can pay that I
[1:28:31] can give her a
[1:28:33] name good what Satan wants from you he
[1:28:36] wants your healing he wants your
[1:28:39] salvation he wants your Redemption he
[1:28:41] wants your joy your peace everything
[1:28:43] that God's given you that's the property
[1:28:45] he wants Satan is your to he can't give
[1:28:48] you a name he can't give you a name why
[1:28:52] as soon as he marries you he's going to
[1:28:53] put you
[1:28:55] away amen and his name is not Eternal
[1:28:58] there is no power in his name that's why
[1:29:00] to couldn't pay this
[1:29:02] price he wasn't willing to give her a
[1:29:06] name but that's what Boaz says that's
[1:29:08] all I want to give is my name why cuz
[1:29:11] look what came with boaz's name
[1:29:12] everything Boaz had he didn't want
[1:29:15] anything Ruth had God don't want
[1:29:17] anything you got he don't need your
[1:29:20] help God don't need your
[1:29:23] helpen so when you you come into this
[1:29:25] marriage with God and you're thinking
[1:29:27] well God I'm I'm I'm pretty good at this
[1:29:29] I can do this I can do that God says I
[1:29:30] don't want any of
[1:29:32] it the best thing you can give God is
[1:29:36] nothing the best thing you can is accept
[1:29:39] his name because when you've accept the
[1:29:41] name everything you do from there on out
[1:29:43] is him
[1:29:45] amen and now you own everything he
[1:29:52] has but there was a price that had to be
[1:29:54] paid and Bo says I paid that price Jesus
[1:29:56] had to pay a price for
[1:29:59] you it looked like the price wasn't
[1:30:01] going to get paid when you read the
[1:30:03] scripture there in John when John looked
[1:30:05] over Heaven John says I looked over
[1:30:06] Heaven and Earth no one was worthy no
[1:30:09] one was worthy to take the book brother
[1:30:12] brandom said that that that John looked
[1:30:14] in that book and saw his name his name
[1:30:16] was on the book of redemption but there
[1:30:18] was nobody there to take the
[1:30:20] book nobody to redeem his name yeah no
[1:30:25] one could take it and brother brand says
[1:30:28] whenever I think it was in the breach he
[1:30:30] said when John looked he didn't see the
[1:30:32] lamb cuz the lamb wasn't there
[1:30:33] yet and then a voice behind him said
[1:30:37] John Behold the Lamb that taketh way the
[1:30:40] sin of the world Behold the
[1:30:43] Lamb brother BR said he wasn't there yet
[1:30:45] he had come out through the
[1:30:49] throne he said John hadn't mentioned it
[1:30:52] because the lamb had gone back into the
[1:30:55] eternities why did he go
[1:30:58] back God still loved them people God
[1:31:01] still had to redeem those sacrifices
[1:31:03] that were done by bulls and goats all
[1:31:06] the sacrifices that job had
[1:31:09] made there was no Eternal price paid for
[1:31:12] those yet all the sacrifices that David
[1:31:15] that Solomon Elijah all those had made
[1:31:18] Abraham from from beginning from from
[1:31:21] Adam all the way up those sacrific says
[1:31:24] had to have an eternal blood put upon
[1:31:27] them they had to have an eternal name
[1:31:30] put upon them and John looks and says
[1:31:34] there's no one worthy who's going to
[1:31:36] take the book there's there's no one
[1:31:39] here and and we we look at that and John
[1:31:42] saw your name John saw my name but John
[1:31:45] was in despair because we were
[1:31:49] lost no one was there to take the book
[1:31:57] the
[1:31:59] breach John hadn't noticed the lamb
[1:32:02] before it hadn't been mentioned before
[1:32:05] nor had it been mentioned John didn't
[1:32:07] see
[1:32:08] it all over Heavens he was looking said
[1:32:11] but here it came forth where did it come
[1:32:14] from it came from the father's Throne
[1:32:17] where he had been seated since he had
[1:32:18] been slain and risen again he raised up
[1:32:21] and sat on the right hand of God ever
[1:32:23] living to make
[1:32:25] intercessions skip down John looked at
[1:32:27] that lamb and the lamb looked like he
[1:32:29] had been slain then he noticed he was
[1:32:31] wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding
[1:32:32] a bloody lamb that's what took our place
[1:32:35] isn't it strange a simple lamb had to
[1:32:37] take our place he saw the lamb he
[1:32:39] proceeded out John hadn't saw him
[1:32:41] because he had been way back into the
[1:32:44] eternities making intercession showing
[1:32:46] that those who had come up to God under
[1:32:48] the offering of bulls of goats
[1:32:51] substitutionary offering cuz them who
[1:32:53] believed it pointed to him the blood
[1:32:55] hadn't been shed yet he was there to
[1:32:57] clear it and he was there to clear you
[1:33:00] and
[1:33:01] I would you've been given that name you
[1:33:05] know when when he took your name and put
[1:33:06] your name on that book I believe brother
[1:33:09] brother Donnie said here a few months
[1:33:10] ago when he wrote his name on that book
[1:33:12] he had to write
[1:33:14] yours cuz you share the same
[1:33:17] name you share when he looks at his name
[1:33:19] in the book he sees
[1:33:21] yours why because he gave you his name
[1:33:26] look at the prodical son I'm going to
[1:33:28] try to Skip Along here I'm going too
[1:33:31] long I told them fix that clock the
[1:33:33] other day they ain't done
[1:33:35] it look at the prodical
[1:33:38] son prodical son is in this hog pin
[1:33:42] right with a
[1:33:45] name he has the father's
[1:33:48] name if the prodical son never realized
[1:33:52] who he was he would have never got
[1:33:54] that's
[1:33:56] right if he had never thought you about
[1:33:58] his father he'd have never got up he'd
[1:34:02] have laid there in that filthy mess that
[1:34:03] he was laying in he would have stayed
[1:34:05] there he would have continued to eat
[1:34:07] what the hogs eat because he wouldn't
[1:34:09] have known who he
[1:34:12] was if you're a true seat of God I don't
[1:34:14] care where you're at in your life if
[1:34:16] you're at a place that you're not
[1:34:17] supposed to be you know
[1:34:20] it because you know who your father is
[1:34:24] you know what name you
[1:34:27] have if you don't have that name there's
[1:34:30] people that will go through entire life
[1:34:32] lost nothing they're not
[1:34:35] predestinated they was they will die in
[1:34:37] the hog pin yes sir but when you've been
[1:34:40] given an eternal name you might be in
[1:34:42] the hog pin right
[1:34:44] now but all that has been given to him
[1:34:46] will come to him at some point and it
[1:34:49] might be a long dusty road you might be
[1:34:52] laying in a hog pin right now but when
[1:34:54] you get a revelation a true revelation
[1:34:56] of who you
[1:34:58] are you will head back home it's like I
[1:35:01] said told somebody the other day I
[1:35:02] believe we are in the age of the prodal
[1:35:04] you start seeing people coming back now
[1:35:06] that that have been gone for years
[1:35:08] people coming back and giving their
[1:35:10] heart to God he says I have them all in
[1:35:12] my hand I haven't lost in
[1:35:14] one they might be backslid for 40
[1:35:17] years and then come give their heart to
[1:35:20] God I believe you're going to see it
[1:35:21] happen more and more where the short we
[1:35:24] we're at the endend time and now you've
[1:35:26] got people recognizing who their father
[1:35:27] is this is not where I
[1:35:30] belong but you understand when that
[1:35:32] prodal come down running down the road
[1:35:34] and the father seen him a far off you
[1:35:36] think that the father just seen a man
[1:35:37] running down the road to him he saw his
[1:35:40] name I gave him that name he belongs to
[1:35:44] me that's what sent the father running
[1:35:47] after him if that was one of his son's
[1:35:50] friends that didn't bear the name if you
[1:35:54] if you if you look in strong concordance
[1:35:56] when it talks how the the father ran the
[1:35:59] word ran was to run out of fervent
[1:36:04] Peril to run out out of
[1:36:08] of
[1:36:10] desperation that's when the how the
[1:36:12] father God comes after you that way am
[1:36:16] amen God runs after you he don't just
[1:36:19] Mosey up to you and say hey you going to
[1:36:21] ever come back
[1:36:23] that's not way God works look at
[1:36:26] yourself as a
[1:36:27] father if your son or daughter was
[1:36:30] backslid would you just tell your wife
[1:36:32] once in a while man I sure hope they
[1:36:34] come back to church be on your knees day
[1:36:37] and night praying to God God bring them
[1:36:42] back why because it's the name that
[1:36:45] they're
[1:36:46] given and then we have the prodical
[1:36:52] brother self
[1:36:55] yeah had the father's name right yeah
[1:36:59] but look what all I've done look what
[1:37:01] I've done for you
[1:37:03] God I've done this and then he starts
[1:37:06] pointing out his brother's
[1:37:11] transgressions don't have the spirit of
[1:37:13] the prodical
[1:37:16] brother telling everybody did you see
[1:37:18] what so- and so did did you hear about
[1:37:19] so and so you're the prodical brother oh
[1:37:22] my you're self-righteous
[1:37:24] you are the prodical brother you bear
[1:37:26] the
[1:37:28] name but you just don't have a full
[1:37:30] revelation of it
[1:37:32] yet amen that's a free
[1:37:35] one but we understand Fathers and Sons
[1:37:38] there just something about Fathers and
[1:37:40] Sons and desires that fathers have for
[1:37:43] their sons I was watching a video uh I
[1:37:45] read I saw a clip on it and I was
[1:37:48] reading an article on it
[1:37:52] too some of y'all know who Tom ISO is
[1:37:55] Right Michigan State basketball coach I
[1:37:57] like sports some of y'all think maybe
[1:38:00] that's carnal well worryed about my
[1:38:02] businesses too
[1:38:05] so
[1:38:08] so so Tom ISO had an adopted son named
[1:38:12] Stephen sat on the bench in Michigan
[1:38:15] State for five
[1:38:17] years out of five years Steven ISO
[1:38:21] played approximately 56 minutes of
[1:38:24] basketball in 5 years wow adopted
[1:38:29] son 56 minutes never scored a
[1:38:36] point until third to the last game of
[1:38:40] his fifth
[1:38:41] year and that was kind of by
[1:38:44] accident threw a shot up bounced around
[1:38:46] and one
[1:38:48] in that place
[1:38:51] erupted Place went crazy
[1:38:55] they interviewed Tom ISO after
[1:38:59] that this man has had
[1:39:01] many guys that sit on his bench year
[1:39:04] after year after year never play never
[1:39:07] get to get
[1:39:11] in but when they interviewed him he was
[1:39:13] just
[1:39:14] crying just
[1:39:17] crying he said I could die right now a
[1:39:20] happy man yeah my son scored one
[1:39:24] basket a happy
[1:39:27] man and they said well why he said
[1:39:31] because he made 15,000 people
[1:39:35] happy 15,000 people
[1:39:38] happy I know what that feels
[1:39:41] like I know I brag a lot of my kids but
[1:39:43] when he's not here so I can say it when
[1:39:45] Michael kicked the field go
[1:39:48] Hampton hey you made a thousand people
[1:39:51] happy and a thousand people mad
[1:39:55] but I could have said Lord take me
[1:39:58] now that's my
[1:40:00] boy why did he feel that
[1:40:03] way why do you feel that way when your
[1:40:06] son does
[1:40:09] something it's the
[1:40:11] name that they bear it's the
[1:40:16] name you think when you overcome one
[1:40:19] little besetting sin that heaven is just
[1:40:22] sitting around giving you a little golf
[1:40:26] clap have
[1:40:29] rups you make all of eternity
[1:40:36] Rejoice you make God shout all over
[1:40:39] Heaven why when you score a point
[1:40:42] against the devil why because you bear
[1:40:45] his
[1:40:47] name you have his name across your back
[1:40:51] amen
[1:40:55] we figure out we can look at the
[1:40:56] analogies all we want let's say we're in
[1:40:58] a
[1:41:01] game you might not get off the bench in
[1:41:04] five
[1:41:05] years but when God put you
[1:41:09] in and he's going to put you in
[1:41:13] yeah you might only have get one
[1:41:17] shot you might get
[1:41:21] one but God says this one was made for
[1:41:24] you that's good thank you Lord you
[1:41:28] realize that
[1:41:30] testimony I'm me tell you something if
[1:41:32] you're a person that's sitting here
[1:41:33] today and you're filled with the Holy
[1:41:34] Ghost and you let God take care of your
[1:41:36] life you live your life and let God lead
[1:41:39] you guide
[1:41:41] you the people that you work with the
[1:41:43] people that you know that you see around
[1:41:46] they know who you
[1:41:48] are you are leaving a
[1:41:51] testimony and it's not you it's because
[1:41:54] of his
[1:41:56] name I'm was reluctant to tell this cuz
[1:41:59] I sometimes people think you're boasting
[1:42:01] when you say stuff but God knows my
[1:42:02] heart I'm
[1:42:04] not I walked outside in my building the
[1:42:07] other
[1:42:10] day and there's a guy there he's a
[1:42:12] captain with Sheriff's Department I've
[1:42:14] known him for 26
[1:42:18] years he's worked for four different
[1:42:20] departments around the country
[1:42:25] and we're talking and I don't have no
[1:42:27] idea what brought it
[1:42:33] up he said Jo let me tell you
[1:42:39] something he said do you
[1:42:44] realize that you have a name that
[1:42:47] nobody in this country around here could
[1:42:50] he said you're known for it they can't
[1:42:52] put finger on your
[1:42:55] life I'm want to be so
[1:42:59] much I said buddy a you
[1:43:01] me I don't know what to
[1:43:06] say but I pray that it wasn't me they
[1:43:10] were looking at
[1:43:12] yeah if if me trying to live this life
[1:43:17] and Lord knows and I started thinking
[1:43:19] and this devil got me thinking started
[1:43:21] thinking about man I hope they don't
[1:43:22] find out about this hope they don't find
[1:43:24] out about
[1:43:27] that but I thought Lord You're so
[1:43:31] gracious that you let people see you and
[1:43:35] me you you let them see you and me it
[1:43:38] ain't
[1:43:39] me quit looking at your own abilities
[1:43:42] things you think you're awesome at
[1:43:44] things you think you could do and you
[1:43:45] want everybody to know how good you are
[1:43:47] at what you
[1:43:49] do if there's any good in you it's of
[1:43:52] God amen any good in
[1:43:56] you there's not one Speck of good in
[1:43:59] human being brother brandom said without
[1:44:01] the Holy Ghost you would just be a beast
[1:44:04] a
[1:44:06] brute but he desired he looked at this
[1:44:09] Beast this brute and said I desire to
[1:44:12] put my name in
[1:44:13] there I'm so glad he did Brother ARL
[1:44:16] where would we be
[1:44:26] let's stand
[1:44:35] together brother brandom
[1:44:37] said in
[1:44:40] thirst now remember if you've got
[1:44:42] eternal life your life was in God at the
[1:44:46] beginning and the life God is the word
[1:44:48] and when the word was made flesh in
[1:44:50] Jesus Christ God came to dwell in his
[1:44:53] own
[1:44:55] body God came to dwell in his own
[1:45:00] body it's kind of sounds like a paradox
[1:45:02] to
[1:45:03] me try to dwell in your own
[1:45:07] body God tried to dwell God coming down
[1:45:11] to dwell in his own body and made
[1:45:12] himself the Son of God when God came
[1:45:15] down to dwell in that you were in him
[1:45:17] when you were crucified you were
[1:45:18] crucified with him and you died with him
[1:45:20] on Calvary you were buried with him on
[1:45:22] the and on the mountain and you Rose
[1:45:24] with him on Easter morning now you're
[1:45:25] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[1:45:27] him and now you've got fellowship with
[1:45:30] him when he puts his name in you you now
[1:45:34] have fellowship with him you know I got
[1:45:38] to think when I was when I was when I
[1:45:39] was studying this and and read that
[1:45:41] quote where brother brandom said I died
[1:45:43] with him I was crucified with him I died
[1:45:45] with him and I rose with him and I got
[1:45:48] to thinking about that well if I was
[1:45:50] crucified with him
[1:45:53] and if if I died with him and I was
[1:45:55] buried with him then I went to hell with
[1:45:58] him I kicked in the door with him I took
[1:46:01] the keys with
[1:46:03] him and you took away every every Power
[1:46:06] that Satan had when Satan opened that
[1:46:08] door when Christ kicked that door in
[1:46:10] Satan looks outside and sees he who has
[1:46:12] the name right he saw you
[1:46:17] [Applause]
[1:46:18] right he didn't see just Jesus standing
[1:46:21] there he saw every one that he gave that
[1:46:23] name
[1:46:25] to you took the keys from him you
[1:46:29] conquered death hell and the
[1:46:31] grave because he
[1:46:34] did you realize everything that God has
[1:46:36] done when he put his name in you he
[1:46:38] attributes that to
[1:46:41] you every great work God ever
[1:46:44] done because he became you so you could
[1:46:47] become him so everything that he
[1:46:50] done he attributes to you preach
[1:46:54] wow there's so much that we don't think
[1:46:57] about yes there's so much that I think
[1:46:59] it has to be a
[1:47:01] revelation it has to be a
[1:47:03] revelation you can't just come in here
[1:47:05] and preacher say God put his name in you
[1:47:07] God's name is in you and you say okay
[1:47:09] let's I'll go live that it comes a a re
[1:47:11] Supernatural Revelation from heaven for
[1:47:13] you to realize who you are because if we
[1:47:16] if it came if it came by just
[1:47:18] knowledge we'd already be gone yeah
[1:47:22] Rapture would already take place it
[1:47:23] takes Revelation when the bride realizes
[1:47:26] who she is by Supernatural Revelation
[1:47:29] yes it's not by somebody telling you
[1:47:32] right we're we're almost there we're at
[1:47:35] the
[1:47:36] door you know I I was thinking this if
[1:47:38] if Mary received that seed from God and
[1:47:41] that produced God himself what is it
[1:47:44] going to do to you and I we receive
[1:47:47] God's name we receive God in us it'll
[1:47:50] produce the same thing it did with Mary
[1:47:52] amen you be able to hold God look in his
[1:47:54] eyes and call his
[1:47:56] name that's true that's my
[1:47:59] God the god that doesn't put himself so
[1:48:01] way up here brother brandom said before
[1:48:03] the foundation of the world he wasn't
[1:48:04] even God there was no one there to
[1:48:06] worship him but God never intended to
[1:48:09] remain an object of
[1:48:12] worship he wanted to be a groom he
[1:48:16] wanted to be a father he wanted to be a
[1:48:19] son and he wanted to live in you let's
