glad that god has given you a part of that living word we so love the written word the bible been able to pick it up and read it have it on our phones ipads tablets whatever more that we have but i find it so sad whenever so many people read those words and get what the reading is not alive inside of them it's not quicken to become a life within itself well i'm so happy to see you all i'd just like to grab every one of you and give you a big old hug praise the lord well maybe we ought to do that first then brother jerry just we certainly appreciate the musicians deacons all the brothers and the sound booths and all that for being here when we have to stream but the truth of it is they can't take y'all's place i'm glad it's that way aren't you that each one of us have our part we're certainly happy to be gathered together again today and lord willing the second group will be here uh wednesday night and then next sunday unless things change everybody will come back together we certainly want to keep keep praying i know that you are but just as a reminder to you about all this covet stuff around the world um i'm here with so many um in africa and india and everywhere every week i'm getting emails and texts and things like that from our brothers and sisters around the world it's affecting many many of the believers as well as everybody else so we certainly want to be praying that god will just intervene for us and help us you know when brother branham was here he prayed and said that he constantly prayed that god would help the doctors to find cures for cancers and things like that and me being a pentecostal that uh didn't believe in going to doctors and believing taking much medicine and all that when i first come to the message when i used to hear things like that it used to ah i had a little bit of a problem with it i'm just going to be honest with some of you of course didn't have no problem with anything y'all just i thank god for his grace but the more i began to realize that it was god's love to humanity to be able to allow them to come up with vaccinations and doctors and scans and this and that and the other because he didn't just love his people he loves the human race no matter what color they are no matter what continent they come from god loves the human race and he loves us all the same as far as racial things are concerned of the continent that we come from so myself it's enlightened me to help me i've been praying i hope you have that god would help our doctors and epidemiologists and all these people to be able to find a treatment a cure whatever more for this covert thing it's been more devastating than in our lifetime anyway than anything that we've ever dealt with so if you've not been praying that way please join with us in prayer that god will help them that they can find something that'll better us all amen i'll tell you one thing you might not appreciate a motrin or an advil or a tylenol do you have a bad headache brother don't it don't tell me you take them i do i got enough common sense to now i call on the name of the lord first that's what i always do first but sometimes i hear an echo and donny you've got something in your cabinet there that'll help you if you'll take it don't be stubborn don't be hard-headed praise the lord that's right and even friends you know i know there's controversy about taking vaccines and all this and another but when brother branham was here before he went to africa you know what he'd done took the yellow fever shot took all kinds of shots why he said because caesar required it so remember whenever we're making our so-called stand for liberty of what a lot of people call patriots let's make sure our patriotism does not compromise on the message of the hour and the word of god god gives us enough sense to do what we can to help ourselves well now i've done ruined the service i guess when miles will go to house amen was that for you or you or here's for somebody because it's your run on my notes amen god bless you we're so happy to be together again today let's let's read if you would in ephesians chapter 4 verse 21 amen so appreciate the grace of god to our hearts and lives today i know we don't get to get be together like we were before and i'm so sorry for that but may god help us to get through this time when we can be able to have services we are used to and get together for fellowship and things like that ephesians 4 21 if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him now the book of ephesians was written many years of course after the lord jesus had visited the earth and yet paul is addressing saints that he said had been taught by jesus and they had heard jesus no doubt there were some that was still alive physically that hurt him but there were many that never hurt him in his corporate body but yet paul is addressing them as if though they had hurt him well i'm going to go ahead and say the same thing to you today i believe we have heard him and i believe we are taught by him now if god calls ministry and they submit themselves to the lord then you believe what you want to believe i believe it's the lord speaking to us then notice what paul tells them after being taught by jesus and hearing from jesus himself this next verse that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust now this gives us a good view of what we were and what the majority of the human race still is today corrupt rotten no good that's why we needed a new birth and be renewed in the spirit of your mind now notice so we're not just talking about your intelligence or your knowledge but the spirit of your mind now science will never be able to find this as a matter of fact paul we may get to it today that paul deals with two words whenever it comes to issa epignosis and epignosis knowledge which was god-given and one which was scientific we do not know god by science we know him by revelation so it comes by the spirit of our mind just not our intelligence that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness listen to this uniting time and sign i've shared with you that i've been going through invisible union and also oneness with god and carol told me this past week that she'd been listening to uniting time and sign and whenever she said that it just struck something in my heart i thought my lord you want me to listen to that so i've been down in the basement been doing some stuff down there so i went down the basement and pulled it up on my phone and i've been listening to it over and over again if you haven't listened to it in a while it would do you good listen to this uh quote in paragraph 40 what a unity when god united himself in a human body the principle the greatest of all the unitings that ever was done was when god united with man he left his great strain of being god and stretch forth his tent and took in humanity and become one of them through unity that what that brought peace between god and man forever how thankful we are uniting time and sign let's pray together heavenly father we love you today lord jesus we thank you so much for your word we are just so happy father that this group anyway could be gathered together today and i can feel their anticipation and their excitement i've been able to be in the house of god lord there's something about us we were made to have fellowship lord i know that this covey thing has affected us in so many ways one of the things that we miss the most is being able to be together i hear brother and i'm talking about his own church and how that the people in the former days he said they would cry they would cry from sunday night to wednesday because they miss one another so bad and they wanted to be together so bad for lord we know that heaven is not just streets of gold and gates of pearl but heaven is those who are of heaven's existence so if we can get by in this life and we really don't care nothing about the saints of god and miss the saints of god and want to be with them then to me there's something missing in our lives the lord we miss one another we love one another we thank you for the streaming but lord i would be the first one to say it's not the same lord god you come here and every service and your anointing was so powerful in the services father we are so thankful for that but you never intended for your anointing to replace your people but you intended for your anointing to be on your people so father we're grateful that we can be back together again we ask that you would help us today we pray that you'll be mindful of all of those that would love to be here today and lord when on wednesday some will come and then hopefully again next sunday we can gather together father be mindful of us would you lord as i read this morning every 21 seconds an american is dying dying with covet every 21 seconds around the world millions of people being affected lord god pastor friends of mine people in different churches around the world dying oh lord god be merciful to us father we paul call upon your great name and ask you to help us lord in this time of distress speak to us today from your word father we ask in the name of jesus and the saints said god bless you you may be seated i know we've been looking at it for a prolonged time but apparently the lord wants to get it over to us he became a man that you and i might have a new man if he had never become in this great union of god and man together i could not stand here today and say in reality that i have been born again job lamented he cried he cursed the day that there was a man-child born he said why did not i die in my mother's womb but truly there will never be a son or daughter of god that's ever had the second birth that'll curse that day there may be things and that you wonder about your first birth and think you know was a life really worth living but if you ever truly get born again you'll never look back on that birth and say was it worth it oh yeah it's worth it my heart today is burdened in the angle of those who feel that they are truly born again for many of the population of the earth that confess and believe they have the new birth no doubt people and our great message maybe even some in our church some that look to our church is the place where they feed and consider themselves a part of our church though they live in denmark or in france or the different places around the world that may feel and think that they too have the new births but in reality their life does not match what the new birth should speak of in an individual it's probably one of the biggest lacks in our move is the new birth to confess that we believe god's sinner prophet that's a wonderful thing we believe the seven thunders the opening of the seven seals marriage and divorce many of these doctrines we love them we we love them we thank god for them but yet we know in reality a confession of that alone is not what liberates us from the sin curse that we were born with we cannot help it we were born lost we were born unregenerate we were born in the natural sense without a hope but we don't have to stay that way because of him coming to the earth the way he did and condensing to such a level to become the great oneness of god and man uniting together he would make a way that he would be the first one of the new race that there would be millions down through seven church ages that would be the ongoing new creation of god for what he started in jesus he is continuing around the world this very day there may be one there may be a thousand there may be ten thousand only he knows how many are left that the lamb's book holds their name and the church will go along play along have meetings and so forth until that last one whose name was spoke by god before the foundation of the world comes into that place of redemption but we know of course and realize that it is the family of god that is coming into view the lord jesus was the first begotten he identified himself with these peculiar terms that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten so he was the first one to use this term in describing himself he's identified also of course in other places on down below john 3 16 18 and 20 he identifies himself as something that was totally new but he uses this human word begotten but he's not the last one to use it and he certainly does not mean to apply imply rather that it would only be applied to him as being just begotten by god unlike us we were not begotten through a virgin through our virgin mother i would say but we are begotten by god and we must also come through a virgin womb but it will not be mary it will not be a mother of this earth but it will be through a predestinated spot of ground that god places in each of us notice james says it this way of his own will beget he us with the word of truth so the lord jesus was the only begotten son of god now when this is being said of course it was exactly right and he's the only one that was begotten in that way but he's not the only begotten today you see god once he was able to make this new creation he's going to make a way from that point on that every other son and daughter of god would be begotten and now this is the key of how they will come james now james was not a free will baptist james believed the sovereignty of god overrode man's choice you see when the apostles wrote the new testament the lord jesus speaking what they they wrote that he had said they wrote it before calvin ever existed they wrote it before the free will baptist they wrote it before armenianism was ever thought of so they were free of free will baptist concept they were free of armenian doctrine so this was something that they believed from the old testament that god had elected but predestination exploded in the new testament election exploded in the new testament sovereignty of god reached its climax in the new testament in the old it was foreshadowed you could see it here and there and there but in the new testament with the opening of the lamb's life and the lamb's blood and the lamb being the very heart of god the lamb being the heart of god opened the secrets from the mind of god so with that coming explosion of god's revealing of his nature and character so james did not feel that he was writing anything wrong when he said that we were born by the will of god can you all say amen to that now if you still struggle with armenianism and you struggle with calvinism versus armenianism and you struggle with free will baptist concept then this scripture might be a little bit difficult for you but if you are free from calvinism and free from armenianism well brother donnie where do you stand i'll follow armenianism as long as it's in the bible i follow calvinism as long as it's in the bible when calvin leaves the word i'll leave calvin when armenians leave the scripture i leave them because the word is my father i said the word is my father you see i was begotten by donald lee reagan through a betting ground of my mother betty jane showed and she became a reagan by marriage my father imparted into my mother the joy of impartation and i was begotten by my father and to my mother as you were naturally my father god also begot me by the joy of impartation of his own will he beget me i did not speak to my father don reagan and said don would you care to father me would you care to give me a mortal existence would you care to re-force me and sow the seed in my mother would you all care could i have a conference with you all and ask you all would you please do this come on friends you know that's absolute nonsense no more could i ask god god will you sovereignly make me your bride he made me his bride before i even knew how to spell sovereign before i knew how to even say it is that right just like he did you so you see the apostles this is why they could so write the new testament with so much of this in it because they were not contaminated by 2 000 years of church age doctrine the way we have been no doubt many of you sitting here today are still affected by either pentecostal or baptist or methodist or church of christ doctrine and when you hear me preach or some other man preach you still pull that through your filter well it's time we get rid of them notice james says of his own will begat he us with the word of truth now look at this word beget it means to bring force to bring forth from the womb give birth to or produce so of his own will beget he us so god the eternal had to sow his seed in a womb in order to begat now if he's going to create he does not need another part but to have begettle it takes two parts as you were begotten from your mother from your father through your mother your father alone could not do it your mother alone could not do it almighty god by himself he could have brought us forth now you'll notice the bible does not say that adam was begotten because he was not adam was given the breath of life and he was brought into existence of course from the original creation of god but he was not begotten through a woman but yet the bible says that this new race begins with a begettal so the lord jesus was begotten he was brought forth the seed of god placed into the womb of a woman that woman carries it until it terminates the time and then he takes the breath of life so what is the womb or where is the womb by which we are begotten in this life think of it of his own will beget he us with the word of truth so we were begotten through some sort of womb where was it well if you listen to spoken words original seed you'll find out that you actually have two wombs in you as a mortal the first is the womb of your mind and then you have that for your spirit conceives of the word brings it right on down to your soul so god divided himself and separated himself adam and eve were one in the beginning the the spiritual being of genesis 1 26 male and female created he them and they were one unit and yet they were male and female so in order to bring them forth in a physical manifestation god's divides them separates the female from the male puts the male in one body female in another body god divides them and then god's plan was bring them back together again in a holy union and let them bring forth his seed children before adam ever did that satan was able to beat him to the woman and also have another union now listen close and you'll find out where the battles of our life always are that satan will try to get us by one sin or another by one speck of unbelief or another to unite with him before god unites with us in his word you see even as we hear the word as we feed on the word the prophet tells us as we feed on the word we become the word now you're born by the word of god and your soul of course but as you feed upon the word you're conforming more and more to the image of the word so here's the way the consequence of that works is that god gives a revelation of his word and god brings something to season and to light then god will anoint his men to preach it and then you will hear it then you are given the opportunity in the womb of your being to take that word and become one with that word and you unite with that word when you do more is added to your spiritual stature that word is then added so faith virtue knowledge temperance and then all of these things are added to you but satan will attack that portion of the word before it will unite in you satan is given it's as if though god allows him an opportunity to attack what you've heard now what's he going to do he's going to try to get you to unite with unbelief or fear oh well it's not for you it won't happen to you you're not good enough whatever it is he will try to get you to unite with his doubt of that promise to keep you from uniting with the promise itself amen so what's the whole thing about it's about union it's about oneness why do we do whenever we slip up and make mistakes and do things that are wrong what happened by the gem that allowed us to do that we united our flesh with a weakness that was already there and satan laid a snare a temptation whatever it was for us and pulled us into a union with that sin that besetting sin or whatever more and he pulls our body into a union with that thing and then we do something wrong and the spirit of god inside of us convicts us and we say god please forgive me i'm so sorry don't you know that the lord if you we would have allowed him would have let us be become one was his promise containing pertaining to that situation and he would have given you release to you the power from within you to help you to overcome that if you would have led him but instead of allowing him to do that many times we feed the flesh and we become one with whatever it is that satans want us to unite against the word and will feed the flesh and it gets stronger and stronger and stronger what's it doing as we are feeding on whatever that is our flesh the unregenerate part of us is becoming one and becoming one in that conception and then the progeny of that will be what you messing up praise the lord and whenever we mess up then the soul in us demands that we repent and make right but the soul within us would have already empowered us to overcome that if we would have fed with just as much faithfulness on that which is true that which is right that which is sacred that which is holy come on children but if we allow the devil he will play on our human weaknesses and how he still has them how many still has human weakness and shortcomings shall we do then satan will try to make our weakness one with whatever it is out here that he has some sort of temptation and this is where that we must learn ourselves not only our enemy but learn ourselves and be able to fortify those things about us that our weaknesses and the spirit of god will help us if we will allow him so there is a womb and then in the mind here's where we receive the word so here today those of you that are here those of you that are streaming i'm preaching to you and i'm speaking to you the truth you are taking that into the womb of your mind now because you have two wombs a child will not be born from your mind alone you see when the serpent came to eve anointed by the devil he started on the womb of her mind first he wants to be able to bring a union with her body he studied the creation of god and he sees she's the only one made out of the broken continuity of god and he sees that she came out of man but she's inferior to men he sees that her body came from man but she was made out of broken continuity so he sees right there where he will be able to sow his seed into the human race now the serpent of course was almost like a man stood upright talk think reason and he had a place for a soul but he didn't have a soul but it just so happened that satan did have a soul so satan incarnated himself stepped inside this animal this animal considered for him to do it remember god could not have judged this animal had it been like a dog or a cow or a horse that had no choice but this serpent allowed the devil to step inside of him and then what he does he surrenders his body to this person of satan praise the lord by doing that he allows his instrumentality to become what the instrument by which satan would use so satan wants to begot himself into the womb of the woman but he needs an instrument satan is not flesh and blood the way you and i are today but he is an angel a spirit and he must have something that will be able to mix together he studied the serpent he looked at apes no doubt he looked at gorillas he looked at horses he looked at all the creation and he saw this one which is right next to man the very next level right below man then he was able somehow by the laboratory looking into it whatever that he done understanding how that god had made it he was able to perceive into that this one would mix with the blood by doing that he impersonates himself incarnate steps inside of it in a work of incarnation and he takes over the serpent's body by him yielding to that and whenever he does this then he starts anointing his words now he's going to talk to her he's going to confuse her on the promise of god it would have done her no damage whatsoever as long as those words and those thoughts would have kept out of her mind even when they come into her mind she still had the power of control from her soul but when she took from womb one and allowed that seed to come down into the womb of her soul then she become captured that he changed the very personality of god and she accepted what satan said about god instead of what god said about god himself now notice then from the womb of her mind still nothing has happened yet nothing has transpired but the scripture said that she looked upon the tree that it was one that would make one wise and it was a tree to be desired now you look at the hebrew words and you don't take very much of a theologian to understand we're not talking about her looking at a peach tree and saying i want that tree so bad i can't hardly stand it a tree to be desired to make one wise so what does he do he then moves he moves even closer and closer hoping she will take the pregnation from her mind the womb of her mind and receive it down deeper don't you understand friend the furthest journey that the word has to make in you and i is from here down to here many of us have been storing it right up here for 40 years but i wonder how much of it has moved from up here down into the soul it will not give you power to overcome and live above sin in this life as long as it's in your head but when it moves from your head to your soul then you have a progeny between you and god you are not reproducing god when the word comes from the word of god from the man of god's lips and only into your head you are not producing a child you are not producing an offspring or a burst but when the word is able to get down into your soul and it builds word on top of word on top of word what is it it's christ jesus being formed inside of us so it is the son of god being burst again oh now i hope you hear me this morning so notice whenever this happens and satan is able to use the serpent his desire is to beget a son to beget one that would bring forth and he would be able to contaminate the entire human race he don't even go to adam he knows better he does not even attack him at all but he goes to the byproduct and from there he's able to sow the seed in the womb of her mind and then the prophet said that she could not be able to do this until she received the lie of the devil he said let me go ahead and say in oneness with god let me go ahead and say it he said that no man no woman can believe a lie of the devil until first you reject the truth of god so she refused the truth of god then when she pulled this into her mind then it stepped inside of her mind but remember by being in her mind it would not produce a cane it must move from the womb of her mind down inside her body and then whenever she accepts his lie of the devil in her mind and then she begins to say what satan says so satan's confession becomes her confession that's why when you say i'm not a very good christian i ain't got much faith on this and the other you're talking the devil's language come on saints that's right he can only act in heaven upon our confession when our confession matches what he says and if you're a child of god you'll never hear jesus saying you're a serpenty and if you're one of his you'll never hear jesus say it i've send away my day of grace and as long as you're saying that you're not saying what he says but if you'll say what he says then he can act on your confession the same with satan satan could not act until of course she had received these thoughts into the womb of her mind she pulls it down inside of her soul and of course we know the rest of the story then cain was begotten in the womb of eve by vicariously satan vicariously fathering a child so in one sense he had two fathers and that he had a father of his body satan still could not father a child by his own spirit being he couldn't do it he could not father child but he could get inside this being and be able to be the father of cain's nature so here he had two fathers in the sense that the devil was the father of his nature hope y'all listen to me because i ain't just talking about cain this morning guess what i just read your pedigree now your daddy would have been the father of your natural body is that right but some of you know as well as i do how come that some of us have kids and grandkids and then we love the lord and we worship god and we go to church and some of our families means the devil himself you know why because you did not give them your good nature you could not give them no sir you could not get it but actually the prophet of well i don't like that brother donny i can't really help that the prophet said i don't care who they are whether it's a priest a pope or a bishop everyone that's born is born between satan and eve this is what we were born with a fallen satanic nature and if you don't get saved that devil nature of yours will take you to hell that's just the plain facts now how then is god going to reverse this through the power of the ghetto now satan does not have to find a woman then in every generation and beget a new generation now until genesis 6 we know that there were two separate seed lines that were on the earth and even though adam had failed i hope this don't don't baffle you but even though adam fell he was not like what we are now remember when brother branham preaches the oneness of god and he takes the two sea lions and he goes down through there and he describes cain how evil how wicked that he was he said how could that have ever come from the holy seed of adam so for the first how many ever hundreds of years that it was after the fall there was still a kindness there was a generosity there was a god-based people that were on the earth and even though adam had fallen sin had not become as we know it today so satan was still not happy being what it was so he what does he do he fathers a separate line but then the sons of says they stayed up on the mountain they stayed up on the mountain that's where they lived they was up on the mountain and they lived above these valleys of sin where the canaanites went to and they they stayed separate away from them so the sons of god which are the sons of seth saw the daughters of men or the daughters of king cain was not happy with them because it was two separate races on the earth so here was the godline and they were up on the hill they worshiped god they called on the name of the lord and they worshipped god and they had sacrifices and so on and then they will share this other people and they live down at the bottom of this mountain of god and they lived on down through the valleys and they had horrible horrible sin they lived ungodly of terrible types of lies so satan wanted to bring these two groups together and form an ecumenical move [Music] praise the lord he wanted to form an ecumenical move that would bring them together so he calls them sons of god to go to seeing them daughters of men now they were fair to look upon and they took unto them women women not just wives but women so they were living together and then out of this product the progeny of these this union was what giants giants mighty men and the earth and the word giant there is gabor gabor is one of the what's amazing about this is that gabor g-i-b-b-o-r is one of the names of god one of the names of god he is el gabor which means the mighty one so out of this union between sons of god and daughters of men here come amateur gabors so they were mighty men now they were not only large in stature and all of that and i read just just last week where they have found some remains and and in in iraq and so on archaeologists have found of what a race of people of giants that they never knew existed before i saw y'all y'all just six thousand years behind y'all need any more info give me a call thing like that just make fun of us all they want to one day they're going to find out this word is exactly right so they found all these leg bones and these femurs and all this stuff that was turned into stone and you know they're saying my here's a here's these gigantic people that were there and they found them in the land of where you know where we would know would be the original part of the land of creation and yet whenever these started happening satan must bring them together again in a false union so he wants to take the seed of god and to mix it with the seed of man then what did they produce they produced a super race now they still now called on the name of the lord and they wanted oh yes we still go to church and we believe god and this and that and the other but they started mixing their seed with these denominational daughters now let me just tell you a little something friends i realize that the left through their media the left through all of their things they're trying to do they're trying to control uh conservative voices i understand all of that but i want you to also understand something like this what will happen is that those that are conservative and those that want to hold on to conservative points many of them under this fear of losing their voice will come under the shadow of the churches in the last day and they will join together right up with rome because whether or not you you want to accept it the catholic church had way more power than we do as far as in the natural sense they have the cloud they have the voice they have all of that can't you see what a lot of this stuff is going to do can't you see google shut this down and so and so shut this down eventually they may shut us down from streaming and if they do so be it then we'll do something else but a lot of the conservative people are so scared and they're so afraid that they're going to lose their rights don't you understand open your eyes don't be blind to what satan is going to do they've got to come together and run back to mama and mama has more power than the message people do obama has more power than a little free will baptist church over here and a little men in our church over there so if they can all come together and all stand together to protect our conservative rights oh brother donald you believe we ought to stand for our rights i do but i found out the greatest place i can stand is not standing before the white house with a banner in my hand marching around but my greatest place to stand is right here on my knees now sure stand for your rights this and that and the other but friends don't get all caught up in all this political nonsense and make a fool out of yourself on facebook do what you're called to do pray do what you're called to do sure express your view your opinion and so on but the best thing that you and i can do is to be able to pray now remember i look to show to tell you wednesday night that an angel of god cannot absolutely not accept that slander in the presence of god of a fallen angel but what's amazing is an angel of god can stand on that cannot stand there against the demon and say i rebuke you but he must say the lord rebuke you but look at the difference in a son a person can walk up here today with cancer a person could walk up here today with some type of evil that's holding their life but a god-called man a son of god filled with the holy ghost can stand right here and say satan in the name of jesus i command you leave this child i command you why because the son of god on the earth has more authority than an angel of god can you wrap your mind around such a thing that a son of god that was born lost i tried i was born lost but i lost no more i was born and regenerate but i'm not that no more as a son of god i stand here in christ's dead on the earth when the prophet of god said every god called man that's called to preach the word stands in the very place of the lord jesus [Applause] oh of his own will begat he us so he has his part and there must be another part a womb where is the womb that receives the divine nature of god don't you see why there's something in you allocated by god himself of his own will be guiding us with the word of truth you see the fact is that we are begotten to be his children it can be traced back solely and originally to the eternal himself not me not you not your parents not brother branham not paul it goes beyond paul it goes beyond peter it goes to the divine will of god he purposed it and it was done he thought it he spoke it he actually spoke your name before the foundation of the world now can the devil make a mess out of you i guarantee you can can he tear us all to pieces yep that's only in time that's only in time notice this in ephesians 1 13 now paul james rather here says that we are begotten with the word of truth you see truth is such a great thing to god it is god's nature it's the very epitome of god's character it's true god cannot identify himself with a lie or a liar so truth is god see and luke jesus said give us the parable of the sower one forth to sow his seed and he says that the seed is the word so there must be a womb a place by which the spoken word can land there must be a counterpart on the earth that can receive god's part there must be recipients on the earth that can receive it in order for god to change them notice then james says with the word of truth what's paul in ephesians 1 13 and whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation so the gospel is not just a theory the gospel is not just a doctrine but the gospel is the saving strength of the people of god the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believe now once you hear and you embrace it after that you have believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise so now this gives us the conclusion of those who have really believed everyone that truly believes will receive the holy ghost now there are many that come to the lord and say they believe but they'll not give up this and give up that and give up that consequently god does not give them the holy ghost and therefore they're not identified in the bible as being a full-fledged believer and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you don't get the holy ghost when you believe you get it after happy valley said in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now what does the holy spirit do it seals your womb from any further pregnation of the devil your soul is sealed now remember you're a human and you can still make mistakes and all of that that has nothing to do with your soul your soul is sealed by the instrumentality of truth by the instrumentality of the serpent satan was able to impregnate eve by the instrumentality now notice god does not use science to beget us to himself god does not use emotion to be get us to himself god does not use microscopes and laboratories and this great oratory and all of that god uses one thing and one thing only and that is truth praise the lord though you we're living in an age of course and people think well all you need to know is the gospel well what is the gospel what is the good news the good news about what the good news that there's three gods that is not good news that's from narcia that news is from hell that news is not from heaven well the good news is i can get saved and do whatever i want to do that is not good news either that is damnable heresies well the good news is i shook the preacher's hand you might as well shake a donkey's tail you might as well write your name on a barn door didn't do you a bit more good come on chains don't sit there and look at me you might as well call fido your pet or your cat and rub them and do some type of magic spell that's not the way we're born again of his own will be guiding us with the word of truth so if we need truth to be begotten oh hallelujah and god that little portions of truth start falling our way some of y'all started out as a baptist or a methodist or maybe even a church of christ that's truly a miracle if you come out of that or maybe you started out as a pentecostal whatever more but god giving you a little more truth be getting you calling you falling upon it until it can get you to a spot now listen friend how in the world do you think that your own nature could die out under a baptist teaching how in the world do you think your old nature could ever die out under methodism or under pentecost that's why it takes the word of the hour to be begone but if you listen to this tape here uniting time and sign and brother brown tells him in 1963 after the seals christian mystery and he tells the brand of tabernacle he said there's one more thing we've got to do there's one more step that we must take and you must have it you know what he's talking about the token he hasn't preached the token yet now you imagine him looking at his church and telling them they've heard the seals they've heard the church ages they've heard all of these things and he's saying there's one more step there's one more place we've got to move up into look friend it's not enough and remember many brothers people sitting there were pentecostal in their background and many of them well i hope this don't make you mad if it does it does many of them no doubt are still relying on their pentecostal experience of just a baptism in their spirit and they shouted and danced and prophesied but they had never allowed that true baptism of the holy ghost to move from the spirit over into the soul and seal the soul it's evident many of those people that were sitting there when all these false leaders raised up after brother branham left what did they do some of them went with this man some of them went with that man some of them went with this man oh this one's joshua and this one's caleb and this is not another it proves they didn't have the holy ghost they never took the token message and let god move it over you see for a baptist or a methodist that never hardly experienced anything with god it might in some ways be easier for them but for a pentecostal that's talked in tongues or maybe you know had supernatural experiences and to think that is not enough are you saying brother donald that's not enough i am most emphatically saying that is not enough we must have that seal of god on our soul we must let that seal of god bring the consummation to seal the womb once the womb is sealed a person will never backslide from that day on you are a human sure and you'll have to constantly keep that old flesh and chat but once that soul is sealed it is sealed to the day of your redemption brother it is over it's finished oh my notice this by the instrumentality of truth you see this was not notice how god is going to cycle the new birth that it is not going to be just a creative act alone that you come to church one day and god says bam bam zap zap zap zap no there's a corresponding part in you and i that must receive the word and they ask peter and them on the day of pentecost men brother what must we do they said repent and be baptized so there's something in them that has to respond it's not a simple creative act as it was in the beginning when the earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of god said let there be but there's something in us that responds to that word don't you see what it is it is you from within giving god permission to annihilate your own nature it is you it is not god i'm going to save you whether you want to be saved or not i'm taking you to heaven where you want to go no that's not it at all god gives you the ability to say yes to the death of your old husband and when god gives you the ability to say yes and you say yes that's your corresponding part and god creates in you from your soul that corresponding part to receive the seed and you are regenerated you see truth is the agency that god will use to secure the amount of influence on your soul to bring it to a new birth listen careful with this quoted question answers the only way you can be eternal is to receive eternal life the greek word thou think is zoe isn't that right zoe zoe then that life god imparts to you as the father your father imparts his life to you through the marriage vow notice now the father imparts his life which is going to be you to the mother through what the medium of a marriage vow now what's the difference between a child that's born like that and an illegitimate child because it's not sowed through the marriage vow you see what the difference between the bride and the church the bride is married to christ she receives christ's word through the marriage vow and she becomes a bride the church receives it through what christ is our boyfriend now come on friends i know you don't want to hear this but it's the truth that's why brother branham would call this and says tell us invisible union that we were called to be washed by the water of the blood the bloody word he said to be cleansed from the filth of all these prostitutes why because jesus is their boyfriend and not their husband now boy they really like their boyfriend they really do like their boyfriend and he's a savior oh yes yes sir he's the savior but their boyfriend let him dance like the world and act like the world and dress like the world and get drunk and so on and so on and so on but you see oh my then they received the word oh yes they love the cross they love the blood of the lord jesus and they receive all of that and they receive it through what a confession that their false preachers tell them is a new birth and they receive it into a prostitute's heart which produces prostitute progeny it produces prostitute action i wish somebody would preach with me this morning and had it not been for the grace of god happy valley church of jesus christ would have been another prostitute church it is only the grace of god it is only the grace of god it's not you it's not me it's god's mercy to us but if god can find a person as i preach it to you wednesday night and the greek word there jesus said except you be born again you cannot i do see the kingdom of god then when a person is joined to the eternal in holy wedlock he's constantly sowing more of his seed in the womb and they're conforming and changing and shaping praise god it's like the more you eat the more you get the more you want the bigger you become now all of us know how that works with food hallelujah isn't it amazing that most of the stuff that's good for you tastes like hay and straw and tree bark and most of the stuff that ain't good for you donuts reese's milk can i go on am i detached you know good old bread slathered in butter and honey all kinds of good stuff that tastes so wonderful most of it ain't no good oh one of the sisters of our church was trying to explain to her little little child a couple of years ago and their little child was reading down through there and the mother was telling about the riboflavin and the this and that and the other and she said you know honey it's got all this and that and it ain't good for him she said mama even though it ain't good it sure tastes good well you see that's the way we are most of this stuff we're gonna find out one day a lot of what's about our health our health problems is because of all the stuff we eat and we loving it i don't mind telling you i do too ask me if i'd rather have a diet drink or a regular unless it's all right for a car but man i'll tell you one thing for a human being zero sugar you gotta be kidding me zero carbs brother doug mccue's out in arizona used to say all these people with this health food you cut out this and you cut out that and you live five minutes longer to step out in front of a car and get run over but there's something about us naturally that we want the things many times it's not the best for us oh but brother sister let me tell you this seven course meal that god has provided for his bride in the last day it ain't not like eating a big bale of straw it ain't like eating a green leaf and saying this good and you're foaming green out of your mouth it ain't like eating tree bark no brother we smack our lips hallelujah we love them we lick our fingers this word is finger licking good i'm telling you what it ain't just good for you it's good to eat it's good to resist devils it's good to resist the power of sin and the more you eat the more you want and the more you eat of it the more like it should become so your father imparts his life to you through the marriage vow with mother you mean simply god recognizes when a preacher stands up here and say you exchange your vows and i'll pronounce you man and wife in the name of the lord jesus a man knows his wife through that vow a holy act of god people live together all the time that are not married bring forth children all the time are they alive sure are they born sure but they're not born through the vow you see the bride gives birth through the vow she was called through the vow and you've got a wedding band to prove it it was slipped on your finger before the foundation of the world now watch this is this is really unusual the way brother brahman said this only place in the message that i've ever found that he says it the marriage of i was a mother that by that imparts the joy of imparting catch me the imparting life for a son and that's the way god a joy praise god can you imagine almighty god you know the way we feel joy and happiness and being in the presence of god that god it allows god to experience a joy that creating the world never brought bringing angels into existence never brought but when god can impart life to a son it brings god great joy praise the lord that's the way god loves does a joy in imparting his life to a son then you become part of him which is only god's own life i've given unto them eternal life raise them up at the last day how does god in part eternal life can you see god cannot give people eternal life via a church membership then god would father illegitimate children god can only pass eternal life through a wedding vow did you see why satan would love to take your message away from you and bring into your minds questions about this questions about that and questions about this and why don't you understand what he's trying to do question the credibility of your word your promised land same thing he done to the children of israel numbers chapter 13 oh it's a good land but there's spies over there there's giants over there don't you understand what he's doing questioning the credibility of their land then they said oh no oh no we can't go we can't go that's exactly right they proved they wasn't worthy but joshua and caleb said yeah there's giant saber we can kill them yeah there's gates there but we can take them the other cities there but we can knock every one of them down by the grace of god why they received the promised word for a vow they were ordained to believe it look gentlemen god offers eternal life oh it looks like a gift okay okay okay i don't believe i believe in three gods and i don't believe it matters what you believe it don't make a difference that's what most christians believe today it don't really matter what you believe can't you see they're ripe for the ecumenical council the politics of the left is too big for the southern baptist the politics on the left is too big for the methodists so what would they be willing to do well let's forfeit this thing about sprinkling or baptism our rights are at stake here let's come together as brothers we all believe in god well that's not true most of them believe in gods and they will come together to protect their evangelical rights [Music] they will unite for what so communism will destroy them listen at it uniting time and sign begin about poor at paragraph 40 read down through 444 then jump from there to 63 down through 67 8 go ahead and read 9-2 it's a good one then jump on over you'll find all of these unities must come to pass the left must unite against the conservatives and it will conf it will force the non-spiritual conservatives to unite against what the left while they're all uniting and cleaning out their guns and marching on the capitol yeah we see what that produced the bride is uniting with christ the word [Music] another union going on around the world oh it's so fitting one of the very last sermons that he preached the invisible union of the bride of christ notice this peter says first peter 1 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again or anew unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead so we're not begotten by a doctrine but as brother brandon sing and tell us a while ago a living word a living word you see the real bride accepts his entire person imagine a girl and a boy going together and oh my the boy just buys her candy one week and tree bark the next week and then vitamin c and yeah right how many of you girls have wanted that with dayton so you and he gives you an engagement present it's vitamin c vitamin d vitamin b12 look at my vitamin c you won't see all right for carrot cut color and clarity come on saints but if you focus on them gifts i said what are you getting for me friday waiting for me sunday i don't know about him but i begin to wonder about you i would think if you love me if you love my gifts but if you get him you get the wallet you get the keys you get the title you get the whole thing if you get him oh i love gifts i love faith i love miracles but if i got him i got the whole package this is why we believe in gifts and miracles but i'm not just coming to god through a gift i was not begotten through a sign i was begotten through a resurrected person jesus christ the living word and as i feed upon him he adds more and more and more to my stature let's read this together first peter one and four this is what we're called to to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept i love this word it is a very simple english word but the he the greek word is a very profound word kept keep with the garrison protect by a military guard either to prevent hostile invasion watching and guarding to preserve one for the attainment of something angels of god are with you day and night all night all day angels watching over me my lord all night all day angels watching over me i said all night all day angels are watching over me my lord all night all day angels watching over me let everybody sing it now well all night all day angels are watching over me my lord all night all day angels watching over me [Music] who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time my brother sister this is us ready to be revealed in the last time verse 23 and i'm going to let you go being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abide us forever praise god oh my friends i hope today and trust by the grace of god every one of us are truly born again i know it's a serious time it's a soul-searching time really but let's just make sure i i don't want to preach fear constantly and keep you under that fear you can never live in the full position of who you are by living under the dominance of fear but we know that there is a fear which is godly fear that we check up and we check where we are just to make sure there is an assurance that comes with this token that we pass from death unto life but just make sure that the life you're living is one of the other person the lord jesus living out of you instead of you just simply trying to do it and trying to do it and trying to do it but the dawn of you i need to come in the altar and tarry for the holy ghost do i no you do not you see the only reason that we think a delay is necessary going into the book of acts and remember they went there to the upper room because they must wait until the feast is exactly right the holy ghost could not have come one day earlier two days earlier it must come on the feast the appropriate feast they was not sent there as a type that every believer would have to wait and wait and wait and wait they were waiting for a certain day to fit on the calendar because the lord jesus said fulfill that of the lamb and of the waving of the sheaf and they must wait till 50 days after that resurrection that's the only reason they tarried tearing is not something that is preached in the new testament that we go and tarry and wait and wait the only reason that we have to wait is to get the things out of our life that displease him and remember in future home the prophet lays it out so clearly and he said it's not you receiving the holy ghost it's the holy ghost receiving you don't you understand if every person could receive the holy ghost at will the majority of these christians out here would live like the devil until the very day before the rapture and then that will that receive the holy ghost and go right in the rapture with everybody else that's not the way it works he receives you remember the story of the prophet talking about the when he worked for the railroad company and they would go in there and pack the car and the inspector would come in and he would look at the car and look at the goods and shake it why because once they pulled that door down and put that seal on the door the railroad company was responsible for the safe delivery of those goods well if the train down the road the car pulled in front of it and the engineer had to throw on his brakes and lock up the train and there was a loose spot a temper or some other kind of something loose spot and then boxes went flying over that and done thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage to those goods you know who was responsible the railroad company so we said the engine the inspector would come by and he'd inspect it and he would condemn the car if the car was not roadworthy as we'd say and make them do what take it all back out and start over again oh if the inspector comes by today and looks at your heart boy if he condemns me well that means he wants you to be right don't take it at all there's no hope for me no are you condemning no it means he wants you to get it right you left out this you left out that he wants you to be certain then let the holy ghost come back oh my let the ministry believe it or not the ministry are the ones that's packing and packing and then you take what they'd say and apply it to your life and move up and they brought in this big box of this brother daryl unloaded that and then brother donny bros so and so then brother joel brown and then this brother oh praise god thank you lord brother west unloaded a whole big load of it lay it in there lord lay it in there then the inspector comes boy is that thing solid man look at that yes sorry reach up here pull that door down lock it put that seal on the door she's sealed to the day of her redemption there ain't enough devils in hell to open that door aren't you glad you see this is the fulfillment of that verse of scripture kept by the power of god well pray for me i'm holding on well i feel sorry for if you're holding on yourself because you'll never be able to do it if kobe don't get you lust well and if us don't get you something else well but if you're kept by the power of god you've got a whole army all around you visible and invisible let's just put our ass together can we those in the visible audience those and the invisible audience as well may the spirit of god just look at our hearts and let's just be very honest and open before him today just let him search you you know there might be a a cancer or something going in your body there might be something at the doctor's office that they could run you through a scan and pick it up you could go in there and have an appointment and everything but you get there and you say no i ain't doing it i'm scared that i ain't gonna do it that thing might save your life it might save your life if you'll let them scan you let the word as it will scan you today let him scan and see if there's any temper any anger anything there that would hinder you let him scan you hallelujah lord jesus as we come together today father and we're so thankful for this privilege lord may you search each of us father i believe with all of my heart i've received the holy ghost that i'm sealed but lord if there's anything in my life that displeases you anything lord i need to make right or fix or adjust show me lord help me the bible tells us grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you

have another scan done she's finished her prescribed chemo whenever they do that they have a bell hanging on the wall there it's a bail about so big and have a thing hanging there maybe some of you all saw the picture but whenever erica completed her last one a couple of weeks ago they wanted her to grab a hold of that thing on the bell and jingle that bell actually the nurses made a video of it some of it was able to receive the video some of it looked like a steel picture but she was able to jingle that bell because she'd completed her prescribed last treatment wouldn't it be wonderful one day when we'll be able to grab that bell and ring that bell our mortality is over the gym our mortality is finished will be changed oh how happy she was the smile that was on her face oh but you see that picture did not declare what i saw when i picked her up how sick she felt and all that sort of thing so we declare our victory in christ jesus it don't mean we're trouble free from that point on

what you've done for erica we appreciate it with all of our hearts lord i believe it's been your grace it's been with her all the way through and helped her and they were so worried the doctor was so concerned because she was so small that he said she has no weight to lose they were so afraid she wouldn't be able to eat and she would be so sick but as i was with her the other day when she went to the doctor and they weighed her instead of losing she's gained hallelujah thank you lord jesus she said daddy and one way i feel bad she said because i see how god has helped me so much through this
