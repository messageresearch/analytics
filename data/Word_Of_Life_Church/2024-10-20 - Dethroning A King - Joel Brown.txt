Cheerios this morning I ate a banana and had a cup of tea all right and about four or five grapes so if you want to get stirred up find your a banana and some grapes and a cup of tea amen y'all looking at me like as brother Donnie says if I got peanut butter on my face I'm just here to have church that's going to be all singing this morning Brothers thank you God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord once again it's good to have this place good to have this opportunity good to to have this invitation uh to be able to stand before you once again now um I I can only be who I am Saints and so that's what you're going to hear today that's what you're going to see today is just simply me who I am in Christ and if you're looking for something else I can assure you right now that you're going to be disappointed amen it's okay we're home we're home amen and if you have any problems with it the pastor extended the invitation so blame it on him talk to brother Donnie when he gets back home do you love him yes turn with with me to Isaiah 14 Isaiah 14 beginning at verse 13 amen somebody say 11:40 put that watch down okay good 11:40 amen and I will say this I I usually do this when I'm out ministering but I I'll go ahead and take care of it now I'll just go ahead and let you know in closing I'm closing now okay I'm wrapping things up right now right in the beginning Isaiah 14 verse 13 Isaiah 14 and 13 for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation ation in the sides of the north verse 14 I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high Isaiah 14:5 says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit I'm going to give you a little time to say what you got to say but let me know let me let you know one thing devil you're going to be brought down sometimes it's best to let people just get it out whatever they got to say don't interrupt them don't stop them but let them know once they finish who you are in Christ huh let the devil Rumble let the devil Roar let the devil say what he's going to say let the devil do what he's going to do just give him that space because we know who we are and we know in the from this message that that this bride this body knows what he wants that's a powerful thing that she knows what he wants done with the word so let's get to getting little bride m yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit that they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroy the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners let us bow our hearts and our heads father as I bow my head I can just hear the old song that father I bow my head to thee I stretch my arms to thee no other help I know so Lord I'm depending upon you the people are in under expectation to hear from you and father we count it as we were just sharing with them truly an honor and a privilege to be able to stand and and bring this word and if there's anything good that would come forth out of these lips today it would be some something that's of Eternal quality something's of of Eternal value cuz Lord I I have nothing in this life to to to render or to give to bring I'm not a wealthy person don't come from from stock that that uh the Silver Spoon wasn't wasn't in my mouth when I came forth Lord just an old poor boy from the hills of Virginia just growing up but Lord out God I'm just a a simple person as you know so Lord if you would come then we would be benefited by our gathering may we not miss it may we receive from you may we hear your voice may we respond to your inspiration and fall under the inunction of the message of this hour this father is more than words that You' brought to this age this is a word that is to prepare us to take a body change and as we tra through time as we go through our thing called life Lord may we be illuminators to those around us before we don't know who is and who isn't and Lord I don't even know what people are going through today that's assembled here this morning but I do know this that we all need you we need your help so Lord that's what we're here today just reporting to duty service for you the speaker and the hearers together may we be blessed and it's in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may have your seats God is so good amen I'll get it in a minute as I often say I pay good money for this thing I want it to be seen I won't take it off just now it's okay y'all know who I am I'm not prideful like that just to say it as a joke I guess but I I want to just as as we can while we're here rather if if you would just go with me my little thought dethroning a king and this little booger here that we just read about he thinks that he's something even the thing that's so striking to me is that even after all this time that he's had to do what he's doing he still thinks he's something H and he still thinks he can can can throw his bluff and and and there are sometimes he does a pretty good job you know he gets us down gets us discouraged we go through grief we go through these seasons and of life and all these shadows and all of these things but as we were saying this bride knows what he wants done with this word even when she's low even when she's down even when she's discouraged she still has the very heartbeat of God within her your kids acting up stand in your position yeah your husband ain't doing right stand in your position sis throning a king a throne in verse 13 as we see that he says I will exalt my throne above the stars of God so watch him watch watch watch the watch the devil watch this old Slicker in this instance when and and he does this so uh eloquently and so uh he he's he's a master at it he watch him as he begins to throw out words and as he's beginning to speak it's all in order to deceive and to realign an individual's identity huh using words to realign someone's purpose their identity because when we hear the word throne what do we think of we think of a king we think of a king we think of these things so he's using words that that through the the mind when you hear that word you think well this guy he he must he must have a a pretty high position he he must be the king since he sits on a the throne right yeah Proverbs 23 and6 says uh eat not eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meals because as you think so are you yeah amen Proverbs 23:7 says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so the devil is tactfully uh precise in the words that he uses because he has been there and he knows the Power of Words he knows what words have the ability to do we're talking about dethroning a king here Saints for in his heart for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so the devil's wanting you to get to to take on his identity of who he saying that you are yes sir and we we we know that in the age in which we live now that we're in the midst of an identity crisis people really don't know who they are when when when you have the ability to look at them and see that old Adams apple right there for one but what you doing with that skirt on what you doing with that high pitched voice all of these people don't know who they are it's an identity crisis it's time to wake up sitting in the house of God maybe you're here today and don't know who you really are in Christ I'm here to let you know there's a king that's trying to settle in on your life and it's time to Dethrone the king that's sitting and ruling over your life yes Lord H Throne a seat of Honor a stool a royal dignity Authority but dethroning a king dethroning means to remove from the throne to remove from a prominent or powerful position to deprive of any High position or title to depose to take away the power and authority of you know what God wants done with this word this is this is the the prophet meant it or he did not mean it we either take it into our lives and we express it or we don't right because this ride we're being put on display in this age this is more than just words Saints amen this is more than we come to a beautiful Sanctuary a beautiful place have a powerful ministry that's here it's more than that it's time we stand up in our position it's time we stand up in the authority in which we've been called Sir dethroning a king so how did kingship begin so what what actually made a person begin to think that they were so important or so great that they positioned themselves above everyone else and that it gave them this elevated position where in the world did that come from oh huh I found this little expression I thought it was was fitting it says if you own the farm you own the food which is something everyone needs to survive so that makes you the king kingship some of the origins of it essentially there are various models in schools of thought regard excuse me just a moment while I go through this just to set this a little background but there there are various models and and and schools of thought regarding the emergence of a leadership class for instance in it it's in hydraulic civilizations meaning a civilization that is dependent on irrigated agriculture it is assumed that the leadership class were the people who planned the irrigation systems that were vital to everyone's survival you own the farm you own the food you own the people so in these societies that's how it was set up as time went on and these cities prospered the leaders begin watch what they do the leaders begin to assume mystical or mythical qualities which transform them into priests and eventually God Kings of their societies these little kingdoms begin to build up we see it in church people think that they something because they got money or their their dad is the pastor or my uncle's this that and they begin to put themselves in an elevated position and what so sad about it is there are some people that follow along behind that thing on I'm not a Reagan I'm a brown okay I don't need to be a Reagan to think that I'm anything hello I don't descend from the brandom stock all y'all cute folk are getting quiet on me get tight ain't no breaks on me I say so comically all the time with the expression Jesus Take the Wheel I be Jesus take the whole car M I don't want to drive anymore you I just want you to be in control amen people thinking that there's something simply because of from where they came our identity is in Jesus Christ our our our power our Authority is because of the shed blood of Calvary amen that's the only thing that'll do so let's go on note that this is why there is a prevalence of Thrones having mythical answers history which seems to be the Common Thread among all these different civilization models Pharaoh's for for instance claim to trace their ancestry to Horus an actual God in the Egyptian uh Pantheon right even modern Thrones tend to have this myth myth mythical origin with the Throne of England being myth mythically entwined with King Arthur so mythology comes into play that's that's demonology to me today of course we scoff at such claims but the fact is that kingly Thrones were often entwined with mythology to confer a sense of divine legitimacy to the monarchs yeah yeah and they were just mortal beings like everybody else that's right they got up in the morning their hair was all over their head their breath was stinky yeah they had drool running off the side of their face huh they were no different than anybody else but because of this position they begin to think that they were something and the devil moved in on that elevated thought thinking that they were having that I'm somebody you're a nobody come [Applause] on Amen we scoff at such claims today rather Kings emerg let me back up today of course we scoff at such claims but the fact is that kingly Thrones were often entwined with mythology to confer a sense of divine legitimacy to the monarchs and rather Kings emerged from the fusion of leadership classes or leadership roles and a common mythology which effectively created a paradigm that the entire Society can agree on as their reality so they begin to construct this uh this uh uh a style this position and eventually society would follow along behind it so there are spirits that will creep into churches and get behind uh Ministries and things that they're trying to build up a kingdom around themselves on and I was telling you I'm not here to give you anything but Jesus Christ I don't have anything else to give you I said I'm just an old country boy grew up out in the what the what we refer to is the holler oh yeah grew up running around in the summertime no shoes and running through the manure squishing through the toes and playing in the creek and and sanding minnows and catching croads and all of these things and plucking chicken feathers and all of these things yeah going out to the well and carrying the water and toting and fetching water and bringing it into the house with taking a bath in an old number 10 bathtub and heat the water up on the old stove and during the winter time the the old bucket that was there the Dipper that we would use for our water and some of you old folk know I'm only 54 years old but this is a reality to me these are things that that I grew up with so I'm telling you all of this I'm a nobody I'm nothing nothing but Christ makes us everything amen identity is in him you're in the winter time that old Dipper the bucket of water would be frozen solid where the stove had gone out during the night and the house was cold and have all these blankets on top of us be afraid to move in the mornings when you wake up it's you're going to lose your warm spot so you got to lay still I'm a nobody I don't have anything to give you but Jesus Christ Christ if you need my coat I'll let you have that but in that coat when you put it on know that you're putting on Jesus Christ you need some shoes I'll get you some shoes but when you put them on know that you're walking in Holiness cuz why brother Joel why you say that because there there will be a gift to you from the heart and compassion of God himself the Pharaoh doesn't just lead because he plans all the infrastructure projects and has an army to kill any Rebels he's the leader because people actually believe he is descended from the gods and to disobey him is to subvert the will of the Gods just laying a foundation it is that combination that allowed them to rule and with great success and stability for a period longer than the entire Christian era so when I began to look at the history of kingship and we all of this was found and how it came into view I found it fascinating how that that when uh when even with like the Egyptians in particular specifically that when when they um began to to create this power structure and time and time again that that structure that they created would would collapse but there was something on the inside of of these people that concept that demonic construct was so powerful within them that even after that that there it would topple time and time and time again there was something on the inside of them that that was so uh tied within their DNA that they just had to build that thing back huh here you what what is it you're going to think that some man is King and Lord and he has some mythological uh uh entity or position or power what was that it was the it was the power of Hell dethroning a king keep in mind but they were intentional about this thing until he finally that old order was reestablished Rose back up again yeah and it isn't the will of God for man to rule over man no the rejected King the prophet talks about this very principle he says in fact God sent the Holy Ghost to rule in man's hearts and rule in their lives that's who's to be the ruler over our lives not some man not some King not not some Bishop not some Queen God sent the Holy Ghost to rule over our lives and if you can't be led of the Lord then you can't be led of anybody else that's right right he goes on to say in the message rejected King that there are even some who want others to rule over there there are people that that want people to rule over them he says but man Wants to Rule and Rule over man and man wants man to rule over him he doesn't want to have God to rule if God is Not ruling in your life then there's another king that's dictating what you do there's another king taking rule in your life and we're here today to help you destroy that King to help you Dethrone that King yes sir sir it's laying Foundation it's a demonic construct Luke 10:18 says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning fallen from heaven and we know this instance in the scriptures that he he'd sent 60 away two by two to go do his work to go uh uh to compel people and to go uh Minister and do all of these things and they come back all excited the devils are subject unto us and then he picks it up here and he begins to speak to them and he says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning falling from heaven verse 19 in Luke uh 10 behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and I declare to you today if it was good enough for them it's good enough for me that's right it's good enough for us it's good enough for Word of Life the power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing nothing by any means shall hurt you you oh it may hurt this but it ain't going to hurt this Soul you may get me down sometime devil but I guarantee you I'm going to get back up there's something about of True Believer even when they are down there's something on the inside of them that causes them to get back up you keep rallying around that son of yours you keep rallying around that daughter of yours there's something on the inside of you that's able to stand even for them when they can't don't give up on them say as I say kids you can't eat them for breakfast and you can't kill them get in trouble notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven he says behold I I saw him falling from Heaven the Shining Light begin to fall from heaven heaven the seat of Order of Things Eternal and consant perfect so he says I saw him fall as a Shining Light from heaven so this thing that was from the Eternal and as that definition says consumat perfect where God dwells in other Heavenly beings so he was uh an eternal he was uh uh he was a Heavenly being that fell as a Shining Light and what's amazing to me is that God watched him as he fell yeah think about it God watching this eternal creature this Heavenly being this this uh consant perfect being far watching him fall that word beheld is a Greek word it means to be a spectator God was a spectator to look at to behold to perceive with the eyes to discern to ascertain find out by seeing this word listen this this word is not used of an indifferent spectator but of one who looks at a thing with interest and of a purpose with a purpose it would be used of a general officially reviewing or inspecting his army of a lay spectator looking at a parade so God says I beheld Satan I watch this this this being this heavenly being fall and as I begin to look at this and and as I begin to see that definition I began to think why didn't God stop him why didn't God catch him in his fall why didn't God stop him from falling Jesus of Nazareth in 1958 the prophet says the woman touched His Garment virtue went out and she got her healing but there was a Roman soldier who put a band of Rags around his head and hit him on the head with a stick and said prophesier tell us who hit you and we'll believe you he never open his mouth and said a word to him God doesn't clown he doesn't have to he's God you're the one that needs to plead for Mercy come on God why aren't you catching Me I'm Falling why isn't God catching you in your condition where you are now you are the one that needs to plead for mercy so bound up in the condition that you're in your thinking is that you're going to always be this way I'm going to always to fight this thing dethroning a king today h this one that's falling you're the one that needs to plead for mercy your inment to God and not God to you it's your inment and not his he's done everything he can to redeem you what more do you want God to do on

wind up in a Hell someday don't blame God he's waved everything across the front of you that he can wave even the blood of his own holy son and you've constantly waved right on by H the songs of of the church the preaching of the Gospel the reading of the word signs and wonders before you and still blindly just determined to go whether God stops you or not I beheld him falling yes H God ain't going to stop you when the the cry for Mercy is already in you you're just not giving voice to that cry you think I've been in this condition so long there's no way yes there is a way of Escape amen the word that's being presented to you today right now is your opportunity to escape that condition that you're in amen come away my sister come away my brother you're here today you might forget tomorrow what I've said next week but today you can hear the very opportunity of how you can be made free than you Lord in the blood of Jesus Christ and the power that he has given the power that's in that word the prophet says gives us the ability gives us the ability the power in the word of God gives us the ability to to to live an overcoming life yes [Music] sir not just when Mama's around not just when you're in church but every day of your life you have the ability to live an overcoming life every day and this whole thing is going to aggravate you to you leave this thing you know me to say don't get stuck on stupid stupid has sent a lot of people to hell that's a good place to say amen amen trap people in a condition come away from that thing just and still blindly just determine to go whether God stops you or not God sends nobody to hell you send yourself to Hell by rejecting his his son yes sir you step over the boundaries of that word that's your decision and God is not obligated to catch you under the influence of this King this demonic King and his construct that he he seems to project in our minds every day I've got a lot to cover I better hurry up so from the very beginning it was Satan's ambition and desire to be like God in closing it was his desire to be like God and quite FR frankly to be even more than God right he was at one time the original Archangel of God we know these things the simple things he once held the greatest position in heaven outside of God himself but he wasn't confident he wasn't okay with that he wanted to be in a greater position he wanted God's position and that is what he's doing in your life the throne thone of your heart is the seat of God and he's after that Throne he's after that that's why he badges you that's why he bugs you that's why he buffets at you all day because he knows that there's a an eternal quality inside of you and he wants that he wants it he was God's right-hand man to Fellowship in our text as we reading Isaiah 14-13 the Bible say says that in his heart in his heart he got puffed up in his heart he wanted the worship he wanted the recognition he wanted the power he wanted the authority he simply did not have the character to match the Fulfillment of that ambition there was nothing wrong with him having an ambition there's nothing wrong with you having a desire having an ambition to be great be all these things but you have to realize there's character that has to unite with that ambition you got to have character to go with that that's why power apart from character is satanic let me say it this way the prophet said power apart from character is satanic amen maybe that'll help you get a little louder amen out there there if you condition it before and after the prophet said people amen I said the same thing 10 minutes ago and you just sat there like that bump on that pickle hey I'm not here to bring I'm not here to tell you anything that hasn't already been said that's right amen yeah is that all right he got puffed up he didn't have that character to match the Fulfillment of his ambition that's why power apart from character is satanic and we must remember you search this out in the church age book submer Church age that we must remember that character is a what victory character is a victory it's not just given to you you're going to have to work at this thing you say I want to be like brother Donnie bless God Brother Don be talking about these young ministers coming up they think having a position to do all these things where are you been what have you done have you sat long enough in the presence of God to really find out what is it that I'm going to be doing yeah and while I'm here let me just share this just personally just let you in a little bit I know this years ago 1994 when God called me to to preach and as I went as I went on in in in in and in life and things and I began I began to get a little uh a little uncertain Lord what what is it you want me to do where you want me to go and people be asking me are you getting out and preaching you I what wasn't going out very much but I found out that that my calling at that as as U my family began to grow that that I was needed more at home now I had invitations to go all over the world to be honest with you but I just didn't yeah sometimes people don't understand the Simplicity of God that's right and they think because this one is doing that then everybody else needs to follow that and do that but you need to find out your purpose your calling your gift as your pastor he's been telling us it's essential it's important to the functioning of the body because when there's a need that arises in the body there has to be some part of that body that can go and minister to that need at that time at that moment and when the purpose of that function is over then somebody else will pick it up later that's that's what it's all about it's not all it's not about just one person I'm going to shut up I need to leave that alone my goodness you tell me cross the way here which way am I cross the way here in the F PA how could have all of that transpired and been uh undertaken all of that with just one person or just 10 or 20 it took the body to function to do and when when some parts of the body got tired and they couldn't make it CU they had to work or whatever they had to do there was somebody else there to f a spot why because the body was learning to function as a whole after all a person without character cannot Reign Romans 8:17 and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I got I hurry up I got so much but dethroning a king for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen if so that we suffer with him that's the Bible suffer with him let me ask you a question what has Satan suffered he's wanting this position in your life what has he suffer to get that position and you're just going to just just easily hand it over to him hand over your life here here's my private life here's my bedroom life here's here's here's my life when I'm at school here's my life when I'm on the job here you can have it just you know just going along with the devil he has not suffered to have the quality of the queen under his control you are more than that little bride you are more than that you said brother Joel I don't know if I'm bride or not I can't help you I'm not here to tell you that you are I'm just here to tell you what this message has said what the word of God has said if you're a crow stay a crow but if you're an eagle get get those wings set cuz it's time to take flight [Applause] am I can't tell you who you are precisely I can tell you who you should be or who you should be beginning to think that you are and begin to believe that so what exactly has Satan suffered the simple fact is character is never made without suffering and he's wanting this character he's wanting this power he's wanting this position in your life what has that devil suffered and then you going to just blindly give over yourself to him oh my and take on his identity and feed his you use his slot as your sustenance my amen the simple fact is character is never made without suffering it's a victory not a gift questions and answers in 1959 so Luci luer is on Earth today 1959 2024 I can say it bring it up to date Lucifer is on Earth today what is he doing brother Brandon trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world why has he not given up because he knows the value of what he's wanting and if he has enough sense to know what value is in the bride why should I not understand the value and worth that's inside of me and not just give over my life my time my energy my mind everything just hand it over to the devil when I was weak brother jelan I got caught in a I don't care about weakness this is a time to stand up in the strength of who you are in Christ we're not on a picnic we're in the war we're in a battle yes you're going to get tired yes you're going to get weary but you still have to fight you fight on oh you fight on keep your hand oh my we've got to fight Saints don't give up don't get weary in your well dooing I know your kids are Knuckleheads but you don't get weary in that wello you fight on you still believe for your children you said brother Jo are strung out on drugs they're in jail they're doped up they're prostituting themselves you fight on you still believe dethroning a king So Luther is on the Earth today trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world Lucifer was kicked out of heaven and somehow somehow the devil positioned himself between the angels and God and he ascended himself above those Stars the prophet words it that way the Stars meaning the sons of God now and preached to them and deceive 2third of them so he positioned himself between the themselves and God between the angels and God that view of calvary should be very crisp should be very clear should be in full Focus every day of our lives and if it is not whatever standing between you and your view of Calvary has at that time become your God you can believe it if you want to your pastor he's told us the same thing dethroning a king CU When he did this he saw it was effective so he did the same thing with Eve he's doing the same thing today you're sitting here looking at me you're listening to me but you ain't hearing me this is your day to Dethrone that King in your life I admonish you do not walk out those doors unless until you have given yourself full till you fully surrendered to Jesus Christ the word the life the Eternal qualities that we need to survive in this age amen you say well that's just you brother Joel you're right it is just me it is I'm of no value to you but God is getting your attention today right Prophet tells us I'm just paraphrasing you can only live an overcoming life if you receive the word that's coming from the men that are sent to you to bring the word dethroning a king he did the same thing with Eve he obstructed Eve's view Matthew 8:16 when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were SI that word possessed is a Greek word and I don't want to get lost in the words so much but as I was talking about Satan come and he used the word throne he took a word and when he threw that word out it begin begin to set up in the minds of the Angels hm yeah that must be him so it's important when when you're hearing the meanings of some words it's important to to hear these meanings because it will help you understand the real meaning and not your understanding of what you think that word is okay that's what I'm doing today but but that word possessed means to be under the power of a demon the power of a demon yeah the devil's real yes the devil has power he's strong he's Mighty in the New Testament these are persons Afflicted with especially severe diseases either e bodily or mentally such as paralysis blindness deafness loss of speech epilepsy Melancholy Insanity Etc whose bodies in the opinion of the Jews demons had entered so the Jews believ when someone was possessed a demon had entered that body and so held possession of them as not only to afflict them with ills but also to Dethrone the reason and take its place themselves stealing their identity oh blinding them to the realities of who they are paralysis all of these different ills and malities within the body in their sicken condition and state they begin to lose uh an understanding of who they were well if I was laying here if I you know laying here on my back with cancer I'm dying should the Lord don't love me anymore yes he still loves you but Jo I'm battling this thing you don't he still loves you amen so that's what these people that were possessed but also to Dethrone the reason and take its place themselves accordingly the possessed were want to express the mind and consciousness of the Demons dwelling in them they begin to talk the devil's talk they begin to walk the way the devil walked they begin to think the way the demons told them to think so they took on the animation of a demon here in the body coming to church praise God got my Bible under my arm and possessed with a devil this is real yes it is this is real dethroning a king and their cure was thought to require the expulsion of the demon brother Joel Brown says amen that's the only thing that's going to help you is to be delivered of that demon amen but I go to Word of Life I don't care where you call your home church if it's something that's preventing you from seeing who you are it's a demon your demon possessed come on now the last time I checked 2 + 2 was four this is simple math this is a simple understanding of your walk with the Lord you wrapped up you think you all so holy righteous ah no I don't I know better than that mm- this old boy fight Stu too woo yes huh praise God and I blame it on my wife I blame it on my kids I blame it on my friends I blame it on no I blame it on me see it's easy to blame it on some shut up Joel get on with this you got my goodness got to hurry but in all those the L of speeech definites this epilepsy what I want to focus on this word Melancholy for just a moment possessed with Melancholy what exactly is that Melancholy has multiple meanings including a sad mood a state of depression or a serious thoughtfulness sad Moon meaning sad mood meaning a sad or gloomy State of Mind especially when it's prolonged or habitual coming to church in a sad mood for example you might describe a piece of music or Autumn days as Melancholy depression a condition characterized by a depressed mood bondly complaints and sometimes hallucinations and delusions so the devil will start something in your mind and begin to to to orchestrate it such that it it'll move into your body and you'll begin uh uh exemplifying some some conditions in your body and it starts in your mind it starts up here what does the prophet says he talks about the a little girl he says I see you your dog was running after you run up the steps and all these things that that was a scar in her mind but it set up other conditions in our body you're not sick so much something going on in your mind Melancholy a depressed sad mood sh it's okay you say Amen know where I am all right depression serious thoughtfulness a state of sober thoughtfulness or pensiveness symptoms of melancholy include melancholic sad somber despondency and dejection Melancholy is beyond sad it is a word for the gloomiest of spirits so that they were bringing people to Jesus in this condition and other conditions but I wanted to focus on just that one just for a moment so they were wrapped up in sorrow ful thoughts why because of the bumps of life and things that had happened things just happen life sometimes gets in the way of us doing what God wants us to do and when that happens that don't take away your Eternal quality amen you're still in Christ symptoms are similar to but are more severe than depression and when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed Matthew 8:16 I'll read it again with devils and he cast out the spirits watch this he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick how did their healing come through a word word remember the what the devil was doing with words he would take a word and he would say well this is this is this is this word whatever he'd say and the people yes but their understanding of that word was skewed because it was coming from a demonic anointing sure you're sick but the devil put that on you yes I know you're sick but who are you in Christ amen my goodness it was the utterance of a living voice Matthew 4:24 and his Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse disease and torments they were taken with these things and the bringing them to Jesus you've come into this room today with whatever your situation is you've come to Jesus you've come to the word not to me not to the brothers who if you come up for pray not the brothers who will lay hands on but you're coming to the word you're coming to Jesus Christ himself in order to Dethrone that King in order to be delivered in order to be healed of these these conditions and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the py and he healed them so all of these things are mixed up and they're bringing them to Jesus heal them that word taken they were taken with divers disease that word taken means to hold together with constraint to compress and sometimes the devil will get us in such a mental condition sometimes he will press him he will get us in that condition so tight we say that we think there's no way I can get out of this to press together with the hand to hold one ears to shut the heavens that it may not rain you haven't heard God where are you I haven't heard you speak the devil is captivated your perception and it's time to Dethrone that King to press on every side of a besieged city like a straight forces a ship into a narrow channel that ship is too big your Experiencing God is too big to go down that path you're too important to God to be found in that condition amen giving your time your eyes your attention your heart your passions to that thing you're too great of a creature and being in Christ to go where you've been to stay and remain where you are like a cattle squeeze pushing in on each side forcing the Beast into a position where it cannot move so the farmer can administer medication you've come here to church today and the great farmer God is here to Minister some medication but the devil has you in such a tight place come on it's time to receive the word of God to hold completely the devil's purpose his ambition his goal his directive is to hold you completely in that condition it's time to Dethrone the king that word torments means a touchstone it it means the Rack or instrument of torture by which one is fored to divulge the truth the devil will get you in that condition who's are you who's are you oh I'm Yours devil I'm Yours devil well come over here and look at this I'm yours I'll go I'll do that www.h.com and you go it right on up in there I remember one time years ago I was at my mama's house back in Virginia and i' heard brother Donnie our pastor lovely wonderful Pastor talk about www. don't do this www.hl.com this is years ago I don't know what to do now so I said hm let me see what that'll do so I did it yeah again don't you do it I'm telling you what I did it's is not an excuse for you to but as soon as I hit that enter the screen just so slowly Fades black I'm in hell. it's okay and then just as it as it went dark it slowly faded back up just a little faint light and you know what that site was asking me to put my name in to go on a waiting list there was so many people wanting to get into hell that had to go on a waiting I didn't go on a waiting list but I thought who who in their right mind would sign their name and want to go to hell but you're sitting here today that's good trapped in a condition that you think that you cannot be delivered from get off the list brother get off the list sis I make a good song won't it get off the list sis yes sir dethroning a king I've done run out my time 45 minutes is about the time they say that that you hold people's attention say amen amen okay y'all still awake good see they only sang One song so you know I got a little bit more time but an obstructed View and the serpent Lucifer son of the morning he's got all kinds of names he saw what God was doing and said within his heart within his heart remember the script scripture a reading he said within his heart I want that that's what I want H I want a heaven I want an Eden I want a wife I want an eve he was pouting I want that God won't let me have it so as I asked the question earlier what has the devil suffered he thinks his pouting is suffering nah pouting can't equate to suffering you know how kids are they a little pout and think they just going through the worst thing ever they just want what they're want they're wanting you to give into it that's what the devil is wanting you to do he's just like an old pouting snotty nose full diapered kid diaper full of mess huh he ain't about nothing he's wanting to take away your experience he's wanting ultimately your very life yes pounding can never be equated as suffering Ahab he began to pout because naboth would not break the traditions of God and the laws of God and give up his place he was after naboth's position he was after naboth's possession right and Nebo said nope not today devil because naboth had a revelation NE knew that God said that this is your land Nebo amen I'm here to declare to you today that this is your land my sister and my brother this is your possession and naboth knew that it was his Heritage and he knew that he must keep it in order that he could hand it down to the successive Generations some of you young people sitting here today just new parents and just little babies swaddling babies You' have a Heritage to pass down to that child and there baby strains in your family that you're going to have to fight to defend and protect that child amen 2+ 2 is four but he KN he had this heritage why because Satan was after the to establish dominance and position himself as king over nebo's nebo's Heritage nebo's possession and Satan attacked the mind or the intellect of Eve so he brought educational Enlightenment if he could get to the mind he had Direct access to her heart get the mind you have access to the heart and if he had her heart she could easily be swayed by every wind of Doctrine huh he starts in the mind the words that he uses to get to the heart because once he was able to do that to swear there was no longer to put up a fight I feel comfortable here feeling comfortable in chat rooms sometimes I wish there wasn't anything right here I'd preach and hide back here where y'all can't see me feeling comfortable on websites the devil is causing you to feel comfortable dethroning a king that's all I'm saying today that's all I'm trying to get your attention to be brought to it's time to Dethrone that King yeah because the exponential nature of a destructive situation is much broader than you think you say to yourself well it's just me it's it's only just me no it's more than that hear me Saints it's more than it's time to Dethrone the king it's time to throw up our hands in a sign of surrender the greatest battle ever fought well that's the way it is Friends Satan tries to be hypocritical about it he tries to show you something better an easier way a more sensible plan but there is no more sensible plan than that God laid down at the beginning right so why are we listening to what the devil says the plan has already been laid out thank you Lord and you've already said amen to the word I heard you there's nothing more to rest upon the battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reason her reasonings where did she get those reasoning from the devil had planted these words in her mind he's trying to change her identity he's trying to give her an understanding of who she is by what he is he's trying to give her his identity that's the flu it come in that's the channel it run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes with sight watch this she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband what's she doing looking at what what are you doing looking at somebody else something else other than the word of God he said but Joel you just don't know I don't need to know it's a devil you're under the possession of a demonic Spirit I've been there too ask your pastor this when he gets back I don't mean to keep throwing off saying he's not my pastor too but just to make it ring true ask your pastor if he's ever been under demonic spirit before come on I can answer the question right now for you he'll say yes ma'am yes sir sir absolutely why because he's a mortal being trapped in a body of time amen you cute folk welcome to Word of Life Church thank you for coming today we believe in the power of the word of God here at Word of Life Church we believe in Deliverance from demonic spirits we'll see you at the altar shortly amen keep your seat you can have it is that important to you H oh my that's the fluid come in her eyes with sight she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her husband he was the most subtle all the Beast of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband he looked like a great masculine Beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and the first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings caught it human reasonings not God's reasonings but human reasonings CTIC and she says why wouldn't that be a thrill he injected into her a a word he presented a word to her and it came into her mind and that's the thing he does to a woman today some woman with a lovely little husband finds some great big masculine man that's that man this man will try to opening up her reasonings remember that's Satan that's the devil or vice versa man to woman woman to man either way what does he do work in that reasoning power that conscience where something begins to move through but God gives but but but give God's word the first place the first place when the Devil comes in say not today devil God's got first place in my life [Applause] amen a man can't even he can't sin here it is this coming fresh the prophet says a man cannot sin until first he cast aside God's word yeah I'll leave that alone 2 Corinthians 10:4 we're going to the Musicians would well oh my goodness wow now this hold off just just give me about oh my goodness I'm sorry um let's see 2 Corinthians 10:4 for the weapons of our war are not carnal But Mighty made possible through God to the pulling down to the destruction to the demolition of strongholds the word of God is powerful that's what you need in your life is the word of God and it the word will be what you need to bring destruction and demolition to the kingdom that has encamped and enshrouded your life amen the word of God the power that's rest that's in this word casting down imaginations casting down these reasonings all of these reckonings these computations in our mind casting them down and having in a Readiness Watch this once you cast this thing down you will have within you a Readiness to Revenge all disobedience the Lord it don't get any more simpler than this this is the word of God having in a having in a Readiness to Revenge that word means that word Readiness means to to to be prepared so when you cast all these things aside the reasonings of our Humanity we have a preparation within us to revenge or to vindicate our right to protect to avenge a thing to punish a person for a thing we have the power the ability and the knowhow to punish the devil for what he's doing in our lives amen this is the word of God h Lunch will be all right just give me just a few more minutes I'm sorry when your obedience is fulfilled compliance and submission
