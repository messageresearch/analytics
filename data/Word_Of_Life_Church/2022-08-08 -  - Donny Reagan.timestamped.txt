[33:57] place it's not an old folks retirement
[33:58] home
[34:00] okay i'm not preaching you all a message
[34:03] for a retirement center
[34:04] we're to get out of this place
[34:08] rejoice in the lord alway and again i
[34:11] say
[34:12] if once wasn't enough he's going to come
[34:13] back and burn us again
[34:16] again i say
[34:17] rejoice
[34:19] let your moderation
[34:21] be known unto all men
[34:23] the lord is at hand
[34:25] be careful for nothing
[34:27] but in everything by prayer
[34:30] and supplication
[34:31] with thanksgiving let your requests be
[34:34] made known
[34:35] unto god
[34:37] and the peace of god which passeth all
[34:39] understanding
[34:41] shall keep your hearts
[34:43] and minds
[34:47] notice now the peace of god which
[34:48] passeth all understanding shall keep
[34:52] and the word your keep means protect
[34:55] by a military guard
[34:58] to keep with a garrison
[35:02] [Music]
[35:06] so the peace of god which passeth all
[35:08] understanding
[35:09] shall keep was a military guard or with
[35:13] a garrison
[35:14] your hearts and minds
[35:18] now let me ask you something if we
[35:20] didn't need a garrison why would he send
[35:22] one
[35:24] if all you needed was one guy marching
[35:26] out over the gun back and forth in front
[35:27] of your heart in front of your mind
[35:29] while waste all the rest of the soldiers
[35:33] but if god sent me a garrison for my
[35:35] heart and my mind i guarantee you i need
[35:37] it
[35:43] the peace of god that passeth all
[35:44] understanding shall keep your hearts
[35:47] and minds
[35:48] through jesus christ
[35:51] finally brethren
[35:53] whatsoever things are true
[35:55] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[35:58] things are just
[36:00] whatsoever things are pure
[36:02] whatsoever things are lovely
[36:05] whatsoever things are of good report
[36:09] if there be any virtue
[36:11] if there be any praise
[36:14] think
[36:15] on these things
[36:18] let's pray together
[36:21] truly lord jesus
[36:23] we are just blessed to be able to read
[36:26] this word
[36:27] and know it's the truth
[36:29] but somehow father
[36:31] i want to be further blessed
[36:35] i know that it's truth
[36:37] and i believe it's
[36:38] true but i want to have it
[36:42] i want to have it in its fullness
[36:45] i want it to be
[36:47] living in me
[36:49] in a more persuasive way
[36:52] that i can be able to convince others
[36:55] by its positive effect on my life
[36:58] that they too
[37:00] will want it
[37:01] as their own
[37:03] lord may you take your word today and
[37:05] speak to us we stand here as a people
[37:09] with many needs in our lives and many
[37:11] desires
[37:13] i pray that you would help us today
[37:15] that we can find ourselves
[37:17] in the pages of the word of god that no
[37:20] matter what we're facing and what we're
[37:21] dealing with we can have confidence in
[37:23] you to know that you are mindful of us
[37:26] today
[37:27] speak to us heavenly father we ask
[37:29] in jesus name
[37:31] and the saint said
[37:33] god bless you may be seated today
[37:34] friends
[37:40] as we started out the service last night
[37:43] the
[37:45] one thought that i would like to remind
[37:47] you of today
[37:49] is that
[37:51] there are two great forces in the world
[37:53] that we live
[37:55] and both of them are endeavoring
[37:58] to control our mind
[38:01] even though our soul would be sealed by
[38:04] the holy ghost for those who are truly
[38:06] born again
[38:07] and your soul would belong to god
[38:10] sealed into the day of your redemption
[38:12] satan can never get it he can never even
[38:15] touch it he can never even affect it
[38:18] from that day on
[38:20] but he is sensible enough and he knows
[38:22] his position well enough to know
[38:25] that even though your soul would be
[38:27] sealed your mind isn't
[38:30] so your mind is still
[38:32] a very great part of you
[38:34] which is accessible by satan so evil
[38:38] thoughts demons all kinds of wrongdoing
[38:42] can be able to penetrate your mind so
[38:46] when you look at that then it makes it
[38:47] so much easier to understand why that
[38:50] every day of our life absolutely every
[38:51] day of our life that we're under a
[38:53] constant onslaught to be able to control
[38:56] our minds so it's in the books that we
[38:58] read it's in the social media it's on
[39:02] your phone it's in
[39:04] movies it's in the music that you listen
[39:06] to it's everywhere we go now to many
[39:08] people it's in a subliminal way that
[39:11] satan is trying to affect them they
[39:14] don't even they don't even know they
[39:15] don't understand that when they go to an
[39:16] auto parts store to walmart wherever it
[39:18] is and the rock and roll is going in the
[39:20] background they have no idea that that
[39:22] is reaching out to prepare them for
[39:24] armageddon now you and i do the reason
[39:27] we know that is because we have
[39:29] influence from a superior mind who has
[39:32] led us in on this secret now if it was
[39:35] not for that we wouldn't know it either
[39:37] we'd be sitting there singing them songs
[39:39] and thinking wow this summer i remember
[39:40] not too many years ago when i came to
[39:42] this church it was eat up with rock and
[39:44] roll and country music and many of you
[39:47] folks listen to it in your car and
[39:48] listen to it and you're home
[39:52] and yet coming right here to church and
[39:53] feeling like you was all right with god
[39:57] you know what happened you needed your
[39:59] mind changed
[40:01] you needed something to be able to
[40:03] intervene and help you to see you can't
[40:05] listen to that and be in harmony with
[40:07] god of where you need to be at the same
[40:08] time you can't it's impossible
[40:10] but satan knows that the mind even
[40:13] though the mind has been
[40:16] funneled in a direction by which the
[40:18] spirit of god can now deal with that
[40:20] mind and keep in mind when we're talking
[40:22] about the mind of christ in the mind of
[40:24] a human being that the mind of christ
[40:26] really all it is is the supernatural
[40:27] helmet comes into you by the new birth
[40:29] which gives you the ability and the
[40:31] potential to receive from god the
[40:33] fullness of his word then your left was
[40:35] a human mind it's not actually your
[40:37] brain
[40:38] but it's an ability to be able to
[40:40] understand and it's it's part of the
[40:42] intellect it's part of the spirit
[40:44] culminated together in order to make you
[40:47] a complete human being but we know we do
[40:49] not actually sink with our brain we sync
[40:52] with our spirit so a person could be out
[40:54] of their mind and be nothing wrong with
[40:57] their brain they could be out of their
[40:59] mind and yet they could do a brain scan
[41:02] they could do all kinds of things in the
[41:03] brain and the doctor said we can't find
[41:05] us wrong why because their spirit is
[41:07] roaming so it's more than their brain
[41:10] your mind is more than your brain it's
[41:13] something that you get from your makeup
[41:15] now once we become converted then
[41:17] there's an element of us that is still
[41:19] left the unconverted part the
[41:21] unregenerate part that is the part that
[41:23] satan still has a claim on it is there
[41:27] that he sows the enmity that he started
[41:30] out in genesis 3. the enmity that was
[41:33] sown in the beginning started out in a
[41:35] seed form in a man for cain was a man
[41:40] but as the enmity grown and progressed
[41:43] down through the ages it is not that we
[41:45] would look around today and try to find
[41:47] a natural literal serpent seed that it
[41:50] would be a certain race of people on a
[41:52] certain continent and there they would
[41:53] still be it's not that way today but we
[41:56] know that the enmity has grown from a
[41:59] particular seed or a particular race
[42:01] until now all human beings are plagued
[42:05] with this enmity and the enmity is a
[42:08] carnal mind now the enmity as paul calls
[42:11] about in the book of romans that to be
[42:13] carnal minded is enmity against god so
[42:16] here's the very thing that started out
[42:18] in the book of genesis in seed form but
[42:20] now it's not in a race in a certain
[42:22] color of people but it's in every human
[42:24] being so whether you're black white red
[42:26] yellow african indonesian whatever you
[42:28] are every person now is contaminated
[42:31] with this enmity which is in their mind
[42:34] even after you're born again the spirit
[42:36] of god does not eliminate the enmity
[42:38] which is still left in the human being
[42:41] so it sets to two seed lions both cain
[42:44] and abel are warring or struggling
[42:47] within you and i every day it's jacob
[42:50] it's esau it's the whole thing again so
[42:52] in that then we have the ability by the
[42:54] new birth to be able to perceive to
[42:56] understand to receive divine projections
[42:59] from god which gives us the ability to
[43:01] know that he's real and to be able to
[43:02] look beyond our senses and believe
[43:04] something that science cannot declare i
[43:06] read an article this week where
[43:08] three-fifths of the scientists around
[43:10] the world do not believe there is a god
[43:13] they believe that science at the
[43:14] progression of sciences go on all their
[43:17] scientific proofs and this and the other
[43:18] proves without a shadow of a doubt there
[43:20] is no god and it's mere foolishness to
[43:22] believe in deity well i turn that right
[43:24] back around when i read it and i said
[43:26] ever want to use fools
[43:28] because the fool has said in his heart
[43:30] there is no god
[43:34] but my faith will declare what their
[43:36] test tube won't declare
[43:40] if you can just look at nature i don't
[43:41] know how in the world you can't believe
[43:42] that there's a god if you just look at
[43:45] how it all correlates and how it all
[43:46] works together and then believe that
[43:48] somewhere out of a big bang it just
[43:49] happened oh no it wasn't a big bang yes
[43:51] my father had a bang that's what it was
[43:53] he had a bang out of doing all this
[43:56] yes sir you imagine now here we look at
[43:59] it then no wonder they'll never be able
[44:00] to understand because a carnal mind is
[44:02] enmity against god the more educated the
[44:05] carnal mind gets the farther away it
[44:07] gets from god i always knew there's a
[44:09] blessing of being a dummy
[44:11] you know you understand that even that
[44:13] in the sense of the word the more
[44:15] theology you know the more intellect you
[44:17] know the more religious you know
[44:19] sometimes how hard it is to simply
[44:21] believe god
[44:22] because satan will take all you know
[44:24] about the word and he'll wear you out
[44:26] with it
[44:27] that's exactly right so in that there is
[44:30] a great power just in the power of
[44:32] thought without being a christian just
[44:35] being a human being there is a great
[44:37] power that can be released in the power
[44:39] of thought now of course that power was
[44:42] given to us as we even though we fell
[44:44] from the projected image of the mind of
[44:46] god still we maintained an element of
[44:49] that imagery of god even after the fall
[44:51] was there this is why brother ben said a
[44:53] man could take and concentrate on a
[44:54] glass and concentrate hard enough and
[44:56] long enough and actually cause that that
[44:59] glass to explode so it would be the
[45:01] power of the mind and the power of
[45:03] concentration but in that it also works
[45:06] in a religious way that the power of the
[45:08] mind can be able to endue you with great
[45:11] wonderful things or the power of your
[45:14] own mind has the ability to deceive you
[45:17] into a state that you are totally
[45:20] convinced you are right with god and
[45:22] your mind is the one who has deceived
[45:24] you not the devil but your own mind
[45:26] itself now let's read a few scriptures
[45:28] if you don't mind in matthew chapter 24
[45:30] verse 44 what's jesus he says therefore
[45:33] be also ready for in such an hour as ye
[45:37] think not the son of man cometh now look
[45:41] at the power of saul here there will be
[45:44] many many people in the last day who are
[45:47] not thinking in the cycle of the coming
[45:50] of the lord now because they're not
[45:53] thinking in that cycle their thought
[45:55] process will delay their preparation for
[45:59] the rapture
[46:00] now notice how he links their thinking
[46:03] to the readiness of the coming of the
[46:05] lord you see if satan can be able to
[46:07] convince you well it's not in your
[46:08] lifetime people have said this for
[46:10] thousands of years you'll probably live
[46:12] to be an old man it'll never be in your
[46:13] generation well what is that the power
[46:16] of saul so depending on how you relate
[46:19] to the coming of the lord will relate in
[46:21] your life in your readiness for that
[46:23] coming so if you think well it's
[46:24] probably not going to be in five years
[46:25] or six months or maybe it may not even
[46:27] be in 10 years or 20 years or 100 years
[46:29] so through the power of that thought it
[46:32] will put you into a law it will actually
[46:35] put you in a spiritual paralysis that
[46:37] you're saying well probably not in my
[46:39] generation what are you doing you are
[46:41] subjecting then your life your behavior
[46:44] your conduct your character to the power
[46:46] of a thought
[46:48] so jesus notice how it says that
[46:50] therefore be you also ready for in such
[46:52] an hour as ye think not the son of man
[46:56] coming so those who are not thinking in
[46:58] the cycle of the coming of the lord they
[47:00] cannot be ready so we are prepared by
[47:04] the right thoughts or we are delayed
[47:07] preparation by the wrong thoughts
[47:12] amen very simple isn't it yet powerful
[47:14] saint john chapter 5 verse 39 search the
[47:17] scriptures for in them ye think
[47:21] you have eternal life and there they
[47:23] would testify of me now jesus was being
[47:26] questioned now by the religious people
[47:28] of that day and he told them that you
[47:30] better search the scriptures
[47:32] for ye think that in the volume of the
[47:35] scriptures it's where you have eternal
[47:37] life and yet the scriptures is what's
[47:40] testifying of me
[47:42] so you think that by your stand in the
[47:44] word that you have eternal life and yet
[47:47] you're denying the very word made flesh
[47:50] in your day you better rethink your
[47:53] position
[47:54] but now they were thinking because they
[47:57] were jews they were pharisees they were
[47:59] sadducees whatever more so the power of
[48:02] thought had so pulled them into this
[48:05] great thing they just because they were
[48:07] in the messages would say just because
[48:10] they followed the prophet of god moses
[48:12] just because they'd been circumcised
[48:15] they kept all the feasts and all the
[48:16] orders and this and that and the other
[48:18] and in the power of thought they thought
[48:21] they were ready
[48:24] but they were not and yet the power have
[48:26] thought i deceived them oh my saint john
[48:30] 16 2
[48:31] they shall put you out of the synagogue
[48:34] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[48:37] killeth you
[48:38] will think
[48:40] that he does god
[48:43] service
[48:44] so where do they get this thought that
[48:48] they would actually kill people and they
[48:50] did many many thousands and thousands
[48:52] millions of them down to the ages that
[48:54] they killed the people of god and they
[48:57] thought they were actually doing god a
[48:59] service look at the power of thought so
[49:03] then all that's necessary is for a
[49:05] strong one to be able to project a
[49:08] thought into those who are of weaker
[49:11] perception people always look for a
[49:13] leader now whenever the stronger one is
[49:15] able to project to them a certain
[49:17] thought whether it's true or not it
[49:19] doesn't really matter as long as they
[49:21] believe it's true and then they project
[49:23] that thought to them of such magnetism
[49:26] and such an ability that those hear that
[49:28] thought and then they take that thought
[49:30] and they actually become that thought
[49:32] and they acted out into action then they
[49:35] would be able to kill people and
[49:37] actually think god wants me to do this
[49:40] you imagine in the inquisitions down
[49:42] through time whether it was the catholic
[49:44] church whether it's in the spanish
[49:45] inquisition of all the inquisitions that
[49:48] have been of the people of god they
[49:49] actually thought they were doing god of
[49:51] service by heating up pokers of hot iron
[49:54] and poking in the eyes of our brothers
[49:56] and sisters until they burn them out
[49:58] they would take and strip the flesh off
[50:00] of their bodies they gave them no
[50:02] anesthesia they would take hot arms they
[50:04] would punish them in every way possible
[50:06] and no doubt they would get done from
[50:08] their day's work with the smell of
[50:10] burning flesh all over them the saints
[50:13] of god blood splattered all over them
[50:15] and they would walk out from them and
[50:16] think i've done a glory unto god today
[50:22] because they
[50:23] thought
[50:26] thoughts are powerful aren't they
[50:29] romans chapter 12 verse 1 paul says i
[50:32] beseech you brethren
[50:34] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[50:36] that you present your bodies a living
[50:38] sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which
[50:41] is your reasonable service and be not
[50:43] conformed to this world but be ye
[50:46] transformed by the renewing of your
[50:50] what's the mind that's to do have been
[50:51] transformed
[50:53] so you mean actually my stage of
[50:56] transformation
[50:57] will bring the mind into play as well
[51:00] you mean even though my soul has been
[51:02] changed my mind must fall asleep in
[51:05] order to be completely transformed
[51:08] that's what the bible says
[51:10] that you may prove what is a good and
[51:12] acceptable and perfect will of god for
[51:15] notices for i say
[51:17] through the grace given unto me to every
[51:19] man that is among you
[51:21] not to think of himself more highly than
[51:25] he ought to think
[51:27] but to think soberly soberly which is to
[51:31] exercise self-control
[51:36] why
[51:38] why should not i as a minister or you as
[51:41] an individual think more highly of
[51:44] yourself than what has been divinely
[51:47] allocated to me by the presence of god
[51:49] what harm can that do
[51:52] it can destroy me
[51:56] it can destroy you
[51:59] now for you to look at yourself and
[52:00] think of yourself above the divine
[52:03] measure that god has given to you will
[52:05] lead to your utter destruction
[52:10] oh my you folks have cried on me today
[52:14] the power of thought not nobody else
[52:16] thinks that maybe nobody else in your
[52:18] family nobody in the church that's not
[52:20] what it takes all it takes is you
[52:23] to think that of yourself i'm more
[52:24] spiritual i'm this i'm that i'm that i'm
[52:27] that i'm that and when you doing that
[52:29] you're going down a road of
[52:31] self-annihilation
[52:35] through the power of what thought
[52:38] notice this he says
[52:40] every man that is among you not to think
[52:42] of himself more highly than he ought to
[52:45] think but to think soberly according as
[52:49] god hath dealt to every man the measure
[52:52] of faith again he says in first
[52:54] corinthians 4 6 and these things
[52:56] brethren i have been a figure
[52:57] transferred to myself and to apollos for
[52:59] your sakes that you might learn in us
[53:02] not to think now he brings it over on
[53:04] the people not to think of men above
[53:08] that which is written that no one of you
[53:11] be puffed up for one against another
[53:15] so now it comes from the individual that
[53:18] the ministry now is referring to that
[53:20] the people should not puff up the
[53:22] ministry one above another
[53:28] the power
[53:29] of salt
[53:31] galatians chapter 6 verse 3
[53:34] for if a man
[53:36] think
[53:38] himself
[53:42] to be something
[53:44] now look at the power of thought
[53:47] a man can actually begin to think
[53:50] about himself to such a degree
[53:54] that he transcends
[53:56] in his mind what he is in fact and
[53:59] reality
[54:00] and moves into a world
[54:03] that does not exist
[54:06] so a man begins to think himself notice
[54:10] how paul said you talk about powerful
[54:11] words friend a man begins to think
[54:15] himself
[54:16] he actually projects himself
[54:19] into this non-existent world
[54:22] by his own mind
[54:24] by the power of thought
[54:29] it'd probably scare us to death if we
[54:30] knew how many folks in the message are
[54:32] right here in this verse of scripture
[54:34] they think they are so spiritual they
[54:35] think they're so elevated they think
[54:37] this and that and the other about
[54:38] themselves and they think themselves
[54:40] nothing something when in reality they
[54:42] are nothing
[54:46] and how do they do it through the power
[54:47] of thought and they'll send writing her
[54:49] sermon like today trying to bring them
[54:51] down to that spot it'll go in this ear
[54:53] and out the other or vice versa they'll
[54:55] get up and walk out because they have
[54:57] transcend themself they have transcended
[55:01] fact they have transcended reality that
[55:04] they have created by the power of
[55:06] thought a world which is non-existent
[55:09] and they live in that world by
[55:11] themselves no one else is there with
[55:14] them because no one else has that view
[55:15] of them but they do
[55:19] [Applause]
[55:21] i kind of had a feeling this morning
[55:22] when the lord give me this y'all to be
[55:24] looking at me this way today
[55:26] i don't thought i knew which way i was
[55:28] going to go today but the lord wouldn't
[55:29] let me sleep very good last night so
[55:32] about 3 30 this morning something like
[55:33] that this stuff kind of started coming
[55:35] together whenever i finally got up i
[55:37] started putting it all down and i don't
[55:38] mind telling you i was absolutely
[55:40] overwhelmed and i began to see it i hope
[55:42] it overwhelmed you with me for if a man
[55:45] think himself to be something when he is
[55:50] [Music]
[55:52] and the word nothing is no more than
[55:54] anyone else
[55:56] now we know all the redeemed or
[55:57] something so paul didn't tell me that
[55:59] you're not redeemed that you're not but
[56:00] whenever you say you're above
[56:04] others of the same class
[56:09] i mean is there elite bride above
[56:10] regular bride or is there low bride
[56:12] middle bride and upper bride or
[56:15] or is it just bride
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:18] now watch how powerful that thought can
[56:20] be if a man think himself to be
[56:24] something when he is nothing
[56:28] he
[56:33] not the devil
[56:34] not demons
[56:36] not fallen angels
[56:38] he
[56:38] deceive us
[56:40] himself
[56:44] now it's amazing the word that paul uses
[56:46] here for deceiveth
[56:48] it is deceived one's minds
[56:51] the idea
[56:53] of subjecting
[56:55] fanciful dreams
[56:59] it's something that does not exist but
[57:01] the man when he subjects himself and he
[57:04] believes he projects himself into this
[57:07] non-existent world and he moves into
[57:10] that wow the power of fault
[57:17] what if negative thoughts and wrong
[57:18] thoughts can do that what can good
[57:20] thoughts do
[57:23] oh
[57:24] glory now let's watch this in law in
[57:27] chicago 1955. i know you're familiar
[57:29] with it but let's read it again today
[57:31] now it's a strange thing that is so much
[57:33] thought of people say well i'm weak
[57:36] my faith is not very much
[57:39] i'm not a very good christian
[57:41] that's just what the devil wants you to
[57:43] say
[57:45] you're talking his language
[57:48] right then
[57:50] oh i thought the devil cursed the devil
[57:52] on cuss he ain't that low down
[57:55] he'll get you to sell them filthy words
[57:57] but he won't say it
[57:59] some of the devil's favorite words are
[58:00] scriptures
[58:03] that's first on his priority seconds
[58:05] quotes
[58:07] at least he's got enough sense to know
[58:08] which one fits where
[58:12] rory
[58:14] oh he don't say all these foul mouths
[58:16] bad words he uses god's words because he
[58:19] wants to be like god god don't curse
[58:23] so when people say i'm not a very good
[58:25] christian i'm weak i'm this
[58:27] that's what the devil wants you to say
[58:31] listen to this you
[58:34] mustn't
[58:37] never
[58:39] never
[58:41] say that
[58:45] how many of us say it
[58:51] rescue hours i'm going to cast that
[58:52] devil out of you right now
[58:57] why
[58:58] what difference does it make
[59:00] if i say i'm not a good christian when
[59:02] in reality i'm living a life by the word
[59:06] what difference is amazing i've i've
[59:08] never done nothing for god i'm never
[59:10] accumulating on this and that i ain't no
[59:12] good i'm but god probably don't even
[59:13] know me
[59:14] when my own life
[59:16] says the exact opposite
[59:23] notice this you mustn't never say that
[59:25] amen don't never
[59:29] let your testimony be negative
[59:33] let it be positive
[59:36] all the time
[59:40] now if a man through the power of
[59:42] thought
[59:44] can project his image
[59:46] into a world that is non-existent only
[59:49] in his mind
[59:50] that he's above other folks at happy
[59:53] valley
[59:54] or superior to folks in the message he
[59:56] has a special eliteness about him more
[1:00:00] gifted more talented whatever more
[1:00:02] and a man to the power of assault is
[1:00:04] able to project himself into that realm
[1:00:07] and he will actually live in that world
[1:00:10] he will have that all about him he'll
[1:00:12] have that mannerism about it because he
[1:00:14] actually believes this about himself
[1:00:20] if he can do that what about the mouse
[1:00:22] of a christian a born-again christian
[1:00:24] who has power in their words
[1:00:28] i love the way it says this
[1:00:30] let don't ever let your testimony be
[1:00:32] negative let it be positive all the time
[1:00:34] it's going to tell you how to make a
[1:00:36] positive testimony i'm saved
[1:00:39] i have god in my heart i believe him
[1:00:41] with all of my heart do you believe in
[1:00:44] divine healing with all of my heart
[1:00:47] oh my let your testimony always and your
[1:00:50] thoughts everything now
[1:00:54] listen never permit a negative thought
[1:00:58] to come in your mind
[1:01:00] if you can help it
[1:01:03] now there's times you can help it in
[1:01:05] times that you can
[1:01:07] but even if you can't help it and you
[1:01:09] don't catch him on round one catch him
[1:01:11] on round two
[1:01:14] now notice
[1:01:15] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:01:17] in your mind if you can help it when it
[1:01:19] starts it don't
[1:01:21] entertain it now this is where we get in
[1:01:23] trouble a lot of times satan has access
[1:01:25] to your mind and put all these things in
[1:01:27] there because of the power of suggestion
[1:01:30] through the power of thought and then we
[1:01:32] take it in and we entertain that thought
[1:01:41] y'all know what entertainment is don't
[1:01:43] you
[1:01:47] so you're going to have some folks over
[1:01:48] at your house this evening and say well
[1:01:49] we're going to have a few folks for
[1:01:50] fellowship sister i'll fix a little you
[1:01:52] know little something other heat and
[1:01:54] some drinks and whatever more you come
[1:01:56] in you all sit down you go to talk and
[1:01:58] eat a little bit you don't share things
[1:01:59] together you're entertaining them
[1:02:02] satan brings them bad thoughts our evil
[1:02:04] thoughts you're not a christian like
[1:02:05] this how the other
[1:02:07] go ahead and take a chair
[1:02:08] have fellowship with me
[1:02:13] you ain't no good i know it
[1:02:17] did you ever notice you got a j in your
[1:02:19] name that could be judas
[1:02:22] [Laughter]
[1:02:25] but if you're fellowshipping with jesus
[1:02:27] you'll say no it ain't judas it's j for
[1:02:32] jesus you got a d in your name that
[1:02:36] could be devil but if you're
[1:02:37] fellowshipping with jesus he said no
[1:02:39] don't stand for devil it stands for
[1:02:40] deity
[1:02:43] but you'll entertain and entertain and
[1:02:45] entertain and by the time that thought
[1:02:48] gets done so i enjoyed our fellowship
[1:02:51] see you next time
[1:02:53] that thought gets his coat on walks up
[1:02:55] goes outside
[1:02:57] and you're about ready to get your gun
[1:02:58] blow your brains out
[1:03:00] why you entertained that deceiving down
[1:03:05] oh my that spirit and it got all over
[1:03:08] you
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:14] and what did he do it projected you into
[1:03:16] a non-existent world
[1:03:19] now you are a christian a child of god
[1:03:21] filled with the holy ghost and loves the
[1:03:22] lord with all of your heart but you are
[1:03:24] living in a non-existent world of your
[1:03:27] thoughts that now you're separated from
[1:03:29] god now you're not going to heaven
[1:03:30] you're not brides you don't love the
[1:03:31] lord at all and god says that's a lie
[1:03:34] that's not where you're living west
[1:03:36] that's not where you're living look at
[1:03:38] my grace look at my grace on your life
[1:03:41] that should tell you where you are
[1:03:44] and if you're not careful you'll talk
[1:03:46] yourself right out of fellowship with
[1:03:47] god
[1:03:52] oh my notice this never permit a
[1:03:54] negative thought
[1:03:56] to come into your mind if you can help
[1:03:58] it
[1:03:59] when it starts
[1:04:00] don't entertain it
[1:04:02] well you say i can't help the thoughts
[1:04:04] from coming
[1:04:07] well
[1:04:09] i love these theological terms
[1:04:13] that brother branham uses when most of
[1:04:14] us theologians can so relate to it
[1:04:18] it'll be like the farmer
[1:04:20] that said he couldn't stop the birds
[1:04:22] from flying over his place
[1:04:24] but it sure stopped them from roosting
[1:04:28] now he said that's a good thing you see
[1:04:30] you can't help the thoughts when they
[1:04:32] come
[1:04:33] but don't don't don't
[1:04:37] entertain them just pass it on
[1:04:43] glory to god
[1:04:45] so in dad's house come say hey i heard
[1:04:47] this having a few folks over and i
[1:04:48] slammed the door in his face you're not
[1:04:50] invited
[1:04:52] you go back at you in your car and go
[1:04:53] straight back to hell and tell the devil
[1:04:54] i ain't signing for no rattlesnakes
[1:04:55] today
[1:04:57] i thought just having our fellowship we
[1:04:59] are with whatsoever things are pure
[1:05:01] whatsoever things are loving whatsoever
[1:05:03] things are the good report whatsoever
[1:05:05] things of virtue and praise that's what
[1:05:07] we're fellowshipping around
[1:05:10] all glory to god
[1:05:11] [Applause]
[1:05:18] praise the lord
[1:05:20] oh my no sir
[1:05:22] notice this
[1:05:24] jesus christ is my savior all things are
[1:05:26] mine by god
[1:05:29] i'm going to keep them i'm going to
[1:05:30] testify
[1:05:33] god can only bless you as you confess
[1:05:36] he's done it for you
[1:05:39] so if he confesses in heaven you're
[1:05:41] saved you're confessing on earth you're
[1:05:43] lost
[1:05:46] you stop the confession right there
[1:05:50] he confesses i loved you before the
[1:05:51] world began and you say i'm not sure
[1:05:53] that stops the confession right there he
[1:05:55] says by my stripes your heel he said i
[1:05:57] don't know that stops the confession
[1:05:59] right there
[1:06:04] lord jesus help us
[1:06:06] notice god can only bless you as you
[1:06:09] confess
[1:06:10] that he's done it for you see he's a
[1:06:12] high priest of our confession is that
[1:06:14] right hebrews 3 he said that he's a high
[1:06:16] priest of our confession he can only do
[1:06:18] for us
[1:06:20] as we accept it
[1:06:22] and believe it
[1:06:24] and confess it
[1:06:30] i love this combined barnabas when you
[1:06:32] begin thinking about divine healing and
[1:06:34] you get to thinking about christ
[1:06:36] keep them on your mind if there'll be
[1:06:38] any praise there'll be any virtue the
[1:06:40] bible says think on these things
[1:06:43] if any thought comes by well maybe it
[1:06:45] couldn't be so
[1:06:47] get it off of your mind right quick
[1:06:50] think on things that's positive
[1:06:52] never let a negative thought pass
[1:06:54] through
[1:06:56] don't let it stop anyhow
[1:06:59] if it starts to keep your thoughts
[1:07:01] positive
[1:07:03] calling
[1:07:04] jesus
[1:07:05] [Applause]
[1:07:09] don't think sitting there in a
[1:07:10] wheelchair
[1:07:12] that you're hopeless and helpless
[1:07:14] you're not
[1:07:15] don't let that negative thought ever
[1:07:17] pass through don't let it anchor
[1:07:19] you can't help it from going through
[1:07:21] your mind that's right but you don't
[1:07:23] have to let it stop
[1:07:26] the old farmer story again like the old
[1:07:29] farmer said i can't keep the bears from
[1:07:30] flying over my place
[1:07:36] but he had a double barrel shotgun
[1:07:40] there are certain times a rifle is more
[1:07:42] fitting
[1:07:42] there are certain times a single barrel
[1:07:44] is more fitting or an over and under but
[1:07:46] in this case you want a double barrel
[1:07:52] whoa here it is
[1:07:57] it's the 66 side by side
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] 66 books full of divine promises for the
[1:08:06] children of god
[1:08:10] oh glory said don't let them loose my
[1:08:13] mouth let them pass right on truth
[1:08:15] here's the shotgun to use
[1:08:18] both new and old testament it's a double
[1:08:21] barrel
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:23] so when the devil comes to you set out
[1:08:25] your own peril big boy
[1:08:28] cause i'm loaded and i'm ready i've got
[1:08:31] 66 barrels
[1:08:35] my goodness what a shotgun
[1:08:38] you know why the devil ain't scared of
[1:08:40] most of us we use peace shooters
[1:08:45] and the devil's overholding his son
[1:08:50] oh that's that's the one thing i love
[1:08:52] about the message people they're dumber
[1:08:53] than colbert
[1:08:56] man they're so convinced they're so
[1:08:57] relevant you know revel in all they know
[1:08:59] so much about god and fight with
[1:09:01] peashooters
[1:09:07] you imagine how the devil feels when a
[1:09:09] saint of god goes over to his gun safe
[1:09:18] satan says oh no
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:23] run for your life
[1:09:27] i've dealt with this guy he knows how to
[1:09:29] use this thing
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:34] oh glory to god
[1:09:38] notice this
[1:09:39] here's the shotgun to use
[1:09:42] both new and old testament a double
[1:09:44] barrel a very good one too i'll tell you
[1:09:47] it keeps them all away
[1:09:51] so you know what let's just lets me know
[1:09:53] friends
[1:09:54] you and i are using our shotgun
[1:09:58] we let these thoughts dominate our minds
[1:10:02] pull us into a non-existent world
[1:10:06] through the power of thought and we've
[1:10:07] got everything we need to blow them to
[1:10:11] smithereens
[1:10:14] well let's now them stop them from
[1:10:15] coming back they'll be right back after
[1:10:17] you get done blowing it out
[1:10:19] but don't worry you got plenty of
[1:10:20] ammunition
[1:10:23] notice this on this report he said you
[1:10:25] know
[1:10:26] when you think about god when you keep
[1:10:28] your mind you sit in church
[1:10:30] and you think about everything else but
[1:10:32] god
[1:10:34] um
[1:10:35] how you're going to do your washing what
[1:10:37] you're going to do at the office
[1:10:38] tomorrow
[1:10:40] how are you going to do this that the
[1:10:41] other keep your mind off of that
[1:10:46] and think on god
[1:10:51] you don't have to raise your hands we're
[1:10:52] all guilty
[1:10:54] i wonder how many of you have thought
[1:10:55] about washing sisters
[1:10:57] bacon fixing a tractor brothers
[1:11:00] going out to here and there and there
[1:11:02] after church
[1:11:06] i've been guilty
[1:11:08] not working on a tractor but working on
[1:11:10] something else best if it's a preacher
[1:11:11] that's born you to death or putting you
[1:11:12] to sleep
[1:11:13] or it's a long-winded i'm wore out i got
[1:11:15] to think about fixing something to stay
[1:11:17] awake
[1:11:21] just being honest
[1:11:24] just being honest
[1:11:27] how many times has our minds roam here
[1:11:29] and there and there and that's not
[1:11:31] something the holy ghost will do that's
[1:11:33] something we have to discipline
[1:11:35] ourselves and get out that shotgun
[1:11:38] nobody's even knowing what's going on
[1:11:40] because you're going
[1:11:42] oh god he's clearing suicide incoming
[1:11:44] suicide i'm blowing them birds out of my
[1:11:45] brain
[1:11:46] i'm blowing them all salts out of my
[1:11:48] head so i can receive the word
[1:11:52] but if we sat down we think about this i
[1:11:54] wonder how many of you have really
[1:11:56] settled a lot of problems when you're
[1:11:57] sitting in church
[1:11:59] some of your brothers probably fixed
[1:12:00] several lawn mowers chainsaws all kinds
[1:12:02] of things while you're sitting here in
[1:12:03] church
[1:12:04] you know why why satan knows here's the
[1:12:08] battlefield the power of thought oh can
[1:12:10] you imagine when god when god takes his
[1:12:14] word and makes it so real and satan says
[1:12:16] oh no
[1:12:18] if they see that
[1:12:20] they'll be transformed
[1:12:23] they'll be powerhouses
[1:12:30] so you don't say a word
[1:12:32] let you go ahead and come to church you
[1:12:34] come in
[1:12:35] singing everything goes
[1:12:37] you sit down preacher starts
[1:12:40] the thought comes through you're just
[1:12:42] sitting there looking at me and saying i
[1:12:43] wonder what he's going to preach today
[1:12:45] i announced my thought wow
[1:12:47] interesting
[1:12:48] my goodness all of a sudden here it
[1:12:51] comes
[1:12:52] you didn't turn off your curling iron
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:04] or you begin to think the coffee pot
[1:13:09] and you slip your husband a note trying
[1:13:11] to hide it so the dickens won't see you
[1:13:13] did you turn off the coffee pot
[1:13:16] and he took turn around and looked at
[1:13:17] you with that deer in the headlight look
[1:13:30] now we're all laughing do you understand
[1:13:32] how serious this is though
[1:13:35] you understand what's going on this is
[1:13:36] war fast
[1:13:40] and you'll be a good disciplined
[1:13:41] christian if you can sit there the rest
[1:13:43] of that service and get something out of
[1:13:44] it without thinking your house is
[1:13:46] burning down
[1:13:50] because you're saying oh my goodness the
[1:13:51] curtain are in the coffee pot did you
[1:13:52] feed the dogs that you left the hat the
[1:13:54] cat out i mean all these things and you
[1:13:56] say why does that have to happen and you
[1:13:58] get home and guess what you find out
[1:14:00] that steak and curling horn was
[1:14:02] unplugged
[1:14:03] and all that worry and all that threat
[1:14:06] no the coffee pot
[1:14:10] but why the power of thought captured
[1:14:14] you
[1:14:15] through the entire service
[1:14:19] and whenever i do this you're going out
[1:14:21] that door so we ain't going to eat i'm
[1:14:23] going to check my hair rollers
[1:14:25] because the power of thought subjected
[1:14:28] you and brought you into a world that
[1:14:30] was non-existent
[1:14:32] and you can imagine your house burnt to
[1:14:34] ashes when you get home and there it's
[1:14:36] standing
[1:14:37] then you get mad on a hornet
[1:14:40] you think you rotten devils
[1:14:44] don't you know if we would calm
[1:14:45] ourselves the spirit of god could say
[1:14:48] don't worry
[1:14:50] you unplugged it
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:14:56] if you can put a pocket knife in a
[1:14:58] prophet's pocket he can tell you the
[1:14:59] curtain aren't unplugged
[1:15:04] but we have more confidence in the
[1:15:06] negative part than we do the positive
[1:15:08] because we're so elevated by the power
[1:15:11] of fault and there we get caught in a
[1:15:14] non-existent world it's not even real
[1:15:16] but it's real to you wow
[1:15:19] the power
[1:15:20] of salt
[1:15:25] oh my
[1:15:26] now let's look if you would in
[1:15:28] philippians chapter 4 verse 8.
[1:15:30] we looked at this last night but today
[1:15:31] i'd like to
[1:15:32] give you meanings of all these words
[1:15:34] hopefully it won't bore you and put you
[1:15:36] to sleep finally brethren
[1:15:39] whatsoever sings are true
[1:15:44] loving the truth
[1:15:46] speaking the truth
[1:15:48] truthful
[1:15:51] whatsoever things are true
[1:15:55] whatsoever things
[1:15:57] are honest
[1:15:59] august
[1:16:00] venerable
[1:16:01] reverend
[1:16:03] to be venerated for character honorable
[1:16:06] of persons
[1:16:08] and of deeds
[1:16:12] now this is what i'm supposed to think
[1:16:13] on and you're supposed to think on
[1:16:15] instead of garbage gossip junk trash
[1:16:22] i know some of you sitting around and
[1:16:23] you're thinking this is totally
[1:16:24] impossible it's not impossible or god
[1:16:26] would have never had it written his word
[1:16:30] we can attain to it but the question is
[1:16:32] do we want to or not
[1:16:34] or better be a battle shall be a battle
[1:16:35] but it'll be worth the victory
[1:16:37] and can you imagine every day of our
[1:16:39] life we're constantly under an onslaught
[1:16:41] there's not one given day friend in my
[1:16:43] life
[1:16:44] that i'm not under an onslaught of
[1:16:45] people dying with diabetes or dying with
[1:16:48] cancer or dying my doctor look my burden
[1:16:50] is more than just you at the church i
[1:16:51] get emails and things from folks around
[1:16:53] the world around the world daily
[1:16:56] daily and if i did not find a place
[1:16:59] somehow a shabbat a world to move into
[1:17:03] by the power of thought i would be so
[1:17:05] overwhelmed i would know what to do
[1:17:08] because there's so much sickness and
[1:17:10] trouble now if you're a preacher and you
[1:17:11] don't care for people ain't gonna bother
[1:17:12] you no way but if you love god's people
[1:17:14] and you care for and you see this and
[1:17:16] that and the other and heartaches and
[1:17:18] divorce and little babies and so on and
[1:17:20] so on and so on every day of your life
[1:17:23] but there has to be a way by the gem
[1:17:25] that this word still works in laodicea
[1:17:30] do we believe this word works today or
[1:17:33] was it just good for paul
[1:17:42] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[1:17:44] true
[1:17:45] whatsoever things are honest
[1:17:48] whatsoever things are just
[1:17:51] righteous
[1:17:52] righteous judgment upright virtuous
[1:17:55] innocent
[1:17:56] faultless guilt
[1:17:59] notice
[1:18:00] guiltless
[1:18:05] but yet if we're not careful
[1:18:08] day to day our activities
[1:18:10] will be filled with have you heard this
[1:18:12] have you heard that so-and-so is doing
[1:18:14] this and so-and-so has done that have
[1:18:15] you read the latest on facebook
[1:18:21] i'm more concerned about name book
[1:18:24] oh brother is that a new website no it's
[1:18:26] actually been around for a long time i'm
[1:18:27] trying to find my name in this book
[1:18:34] people fill their minds with all this
[1:18:36] stuff all this nonsense
[1:18:38] when the bible tells us to think on the
[1:18:40] things that are pure and holy and
[1:18:43] righteous
[1:18:46] free from fault
[1:18:47] but you understand you know people as
[1:18:49] well as i do some folks cannot live in a
[1:18:51] stream of purity because they're not
[1:18:53] pure themselves
[1:18:54] they're like a maggot
[1:19:01] you ever seen a maggot on a fresh cut
[1:19:02] steak
[1:19:05] i'm gonna try my best not to ruin your
[1:19:06] dinner
[1:19:08] but a maggot does not like prime sirloin
[1:19:13] prime rib
[1:19:14] big old piece of fresh salmon or fresh
[1:19:18] tilapia
[1:19:20] maggot likes it when it's rotten
[1:19:24] and he wiggles in and out when all the
[1:19:26] juices is running out
[1:19:32] when it smells so bad you can't even
[1:19:34] hardly get near it but that maggot says
[1:19:37] this is home
[1:19:39] i love this
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:43] friends i don't want to be rude but i'm
[1:19:44] afraid we've got a lot of maggot
[1:19:46] christians
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:48] they wiggle in and out of one mess and
[1:19:50] another and over a dead crump of meat
[1:19:52] over here and something's stinking and
[1:19:53] rotten over there they cannot live in a
[1:19:56] pure stream to live in this scripture
[1:19:58] that's not even their nature in the
[1:19:59] first place to think holy to think
[1:20:02] righteous why it's not in them i don't
[1:20:04] think there's a child of god sitting
[1:20:05] here today that would not desire this
[1:20:07] more than anything in your life to live
[1:20:09] every day of your life with all that you
[1:20:12] deal with but at the end of the day it's
[1:20:14] consummated by these things flowing
[1:20:16] through you
[1:20:21] oh
[1:20:23] notice
[1:20:25] paul when he says this about jess let me
[1:20:28] read this other part of the meaning of
[1:20:29] this word
[1:20:30] righteous righteous judgment upright
[1:20:32] virtuous innocent faultless guiltless
[1:20:35] used of him
[1:20:36] whose way of thinking feeling and acting
[1:20:41] is wholly conformed
[1:20:44] to the will of god
[1:20:51] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[1:20:53] true whatsoever things are honest
[1:20:54] whatsoever things are just
[1:20:57] whatsoever things are pure
[1:21:00] you ever heard of me pure gossip
[1:21:05] what about pure negativity
[1:21:07] where people are not ready gospel and
[1:21:08] they just have nothing positive to say
[1:21:15] well lord i i missed you i thought
[1:21:17] that's what you want me to preach today
[1:21:19] they're all looking at me like i should
[1:21:21] have preached something else
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:27] look at this whatsoever things
[1:21:29] are pure
[1:21:31] chaste
[1:21:32] clear
[1:21:33] free of maggot juice
[1:21:38] i love this next one
[1:21:40] exciting reverence
[1:21:43] wow what a word
[1:21:47] exciting reverend say no
[1:21:53] but you're reverent but you're so
[1:21:55] excited about it you're about to tire
[1:21:57] the bench down but you're afraid you'll
[1:21:58] miss something
[1:22:00] so it's excited reverence
[1:22:04] lord and mercy what kind of christians
[1:22:06] would we be on this hill
[1:22:08] if every one of you made up your mind
[1:22:10] after this day by god's grace i'm going
[1:22:12] to attain to that verse of scripture in
[1:22:14] the bible
[1:22:22] glory to god
[1:22:25] exciting reverence
[1:22:28] venerable
[1:22:29] sacred
[1:22:30] pure
[1:22:31] from carnality
[1:22:33] modest
[1:22:34] immaculate
[1:22:37] whoa
[1:22:39] is that what happened to jesus
[1:22:41] the immaculate conception
[1:22:49] immaculate
[1:22:51] clean
[1:22:54] so could you be pure
[1:22:56] and be mad at the same time
[1:22:59] could you be spouting off with the mouth
[1:23:00] man i mean got a temper mean enough to
[1:23:02] fight a bus on say i'm so pure
[1:23:11] y'all don't know it but i'm preaching
[1:23:12] rapture and faith this
[1:23:16] [Applause]
[1:23:18] morning all right
[1:23:21] speaking especially
[1:23:26] instead of every time you come around
[1:23:28] you're known by your words you're always
[1:23:30] negative you never have nothing good to
[1:23:32] say about god or nobody else
[1:23:36] that's not a good report christian
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:45] if there be any
[1:23:47] virtue
[1:23:49] praise
[1:23:50] a virtuous course
[1:23:53] of notice how many of these meanings are
[1:23:55] bringing in thought and thinking
[1:23:58] a virtuous course
[1:24:00] of thought
[1:24:02] so if you and i think like this
[1:24:06] and we would live under the influence of
[1:24:08] the power of these thoughts
[1:24:11] you know what's going to happen this is
[1:24:13] going to pour out of you
[1:24:15] onto other people
[1:24:19] oh glory
[1:24:22] is there anybody here wants this besides
[1:24:24] me
[1:24:25] good
[1:24:27] praise
[1:24:29] a virtuous course
[1:24:31] of thought
[1:24:33] feeling an action
[1:24:35] moral goodness
[1:24:37] any particular moral excellence as
[1:24:40] modesty
[1:24:42] purity so if there be any virtue
[1:24:46] if there be any
[1:24:49] praise
[1:24:51] oh
[1:24:55] which is approbation
[1:24:57] commendation
[1:24:59] to praise one
[1:25:01] you know what we're so easy to criticize
[1:25:04] we're so easy to nitpick
[1:25:06] you husbands pick on your wives wives
[1:25:09] pick on your husbands parents pick on
[1:25:11] your kids
[1:25:12] tell them all the time of all they do
[1:25:14] this wrong do you ever praise them
[1:25:17] children
[1:25:19] what about you husbands
[1:25:21] do you praise your wife
[1:25:24] your wives do you praise your husband
[1:25:30] well i don't see nothing in him to
[1:25:32] praise him for is it
[1:25:36] has he got a girlfriend other than
[1:25:38] you see work all week go out and spend
[1:25:41] the money on the weekend on whiskey
[1:25:45] you can't find us in the praise of your
[1:25:46] mouth see me after church i'll give you
[1:25:48] a few pages
[1:25:52] your brothers ain't got nothing to
[1:25:53] praise your wife about
[1:25:55] you got a daughter of god that wants to
[1:25:57] live for the lord filled with the holy
[1:25:59] ghost raise your children
[1:26:01] and you have nothing to praise her about
[1:26:07] but you see the power of thought
[1:26:10] we become negative on one aspect of our
[1:26:13] lives and our life is so multi-channel
[1:26:17] that negativity will grow from the one
[1:26:19] channel and flood over into the other
[1:26:21] channel and then the other channel then
[1:26:23] before long the whole streams of your
[1:26:26] life is plagued with negativity sarcasm
[1:26:30] bad attitude nothing's right anymore
[1:26:33] nothing's going wrong you ain't got
[1:26:34] praise for nothing or nobody
[1:26:38] you're still trying to make up your mind
[1:26:39] whether you even like god or not
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:48] priest brother donnie i'm with you
[1:26:55] ah
[1:26:58] but why is it so easy for us to look and
[1:27:01] pick
[1:27:02] on the negative parts
[1:27:05] why it's the power of thought
[1:27:08] satan is slowly
[1:27:10] but gradually pulling you
[1:27:12] into this world
[1:27:14] that is non-existent
[1:27:16] but to you it's so real and the way
[1:27:18] you're looking at it you're exactly
[1:27:20] right and everybody that differs with
[1:27:22] you is exactly wrong
[1:27:26] because to you this is a real world
[1:27:30] it's a real world it's a fantasy it's a
[1:27:32] world of dreams
[1:27:34] it's a world that is non-existent but
[1:27:36] it's very real to you
[1:27:39] that's why i can pour out of your being
[1:27:41] sarcasm and false fine this is never
[1:27:44] right that's never right
[1:27:46] you're looking for the perfect church
[1:27:47] well i'll tell you there is not one
[1:27:51] some of you looking for a perfect pastor
[1:27:53] if you let me know if you find one let
[1:27:54] me know where he is we'll all move there
[1:27:57] of course i'd hate to do it twin because
[1:27:59] if we all went we'd ruin it
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:05] i was thinking about it one day this
[1:28:06] week if you lived in the first church
[1:28:08] age
[1:28:09] and you was looking for the perfect
[1:28:10] church in the first church age which one
[1:28:12] would you chose the church at ephesus
[1:28:16] when they were deep in predestination
[1:28:17] but didn't know how to love their wives
[1:28:20] would you chose the church at corinth
[1:28:22] there was real spiritual so-called but
[1:28:24] didn't know how to operate gifts would
[1:28:26] you chose a church at philippi read the
[1:28:28] new testament church and see what kind
[1:28:30] of problems they had and you'll find out
[1:28:32] they're much like our churches today
[1:28:37] but it really depends upon the power of
[1:28:39] the world of thought
[1:28:41] that you live in
[1:28:44] you see if that's your power of thought
[1:28:45] that you've created this thing around
[1:28:47] you i'm looking for the perfect church
[1:28:49] so you go here and you go there and you
[1:28:50] go there and you go there and then you
[1:28:52] never find you never father but if you
[1:28:54] create a world by thought to know it's
[1:28:56] not this church itself is perfect but
[1:28:58] this is only part of a mystical move of
[1:29:01] what god's doing how many is here i have
[1:29:03] no idea you don't either so don't
[1:29:04] suppose to judge it only god knows that
[1:29:07] but you live and the powers talk i'm not
[1:29:09] going to find a perfect church i'm going
[1:29:11] to hear the word i'm going to worship
[1:29:14] i'm going to receive from god
[1:29:25] i'm gonna be frank and honestly i don't
[1:29:27] expect everybody here at this church to
[1:29:28] be perfect
[1:29:31] i don't expect anybody to do what i'm
[1:29:32] telling them i don't expect everybody to
[1:29:34] live up to what i preach the bride will
[1:29:37] who that is i don't have no idea
[1:29:39] but a long time ago i moved my
[1:29:41] expectation from a perfect people to a
[1:29:43] perfect god
[1:29:44] by the way i'm never disappointed
[1:29:49] but what if we would think on lovely
[1:29:52] things pure things things of good report
[1:29:54] things of virtue
[1:29:58] things of praise
[1:30:02] now paul consummates it all now
[1:30:06] rather than whichever things are true
[1:30:07] whatsoever things are honest whichever
[1:30:09] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:30:10] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:30:12] whatsoever things of a good report
[1:30:14] if there be any virtue if there be any
[1:30:17] praise
[1:30:19] think
[1:30:21] think
[1:30:22] on these things
[1:30:24] now look it's more than letting them
[1:30:26] pass through your mind
[1:30:29] we looked at this last night but let's
[1:30:31] look at it again for the sake of those
[1:30:32] it wasn't here
[1:30:33] to reckon
[1:30:35] count
[1:30:36] compute
[1:30:39] metaphorically to pass
[1:30:41] to one's account
[1:30:44] to impute a thing is reckoned as or to
[1:30:47] be something
[1:30:48] to consider to take into account
[1:30:51] so as you think on those things that are
[1:30:53] pure and lovely and honest and of good
[1:30:56] report
[1:30:57] you're adding this to your account
[1:31:01] in heaven you don't need in heaven
[1:31:02] heaven consists of this
[1:31:04] now is where i need to draw from it
[1:31:07] so what if i think the opposite of these
[1:31:09] things if i think hatefulness and
[1:31:11] contrariness and nobody's right but me
[1:31:13] i'm also adding those to my account
[1:31:17] and i guarantee you i will draw from my
[1:31:20] account
[1:31:21] [Applause]
[1:31:22] you're going to live from your spiritual
[1:31:25] checking account
[1:31:26] whatever you put in it if it's
[1:31:28] bitterness and envy and strife and
[1:31:30] hatred you'll write check after check
[1:31:33] after check i have to check from that
[1:31:34] account but if you think on whatsoever
[1:31:36] things are good and faithful all my
[1:31:39] virtue and praise you can write check
[1:31:41] after check after check after check
[1:31:45] well friends i've come to realize what a
[1:31:47] lot of folks never have too many kind
[1:31:49] words to say
[1:31:51] they don't have many saved up
[1:31:56] why is it so much easier to criticize
[1:31:57] than it is to praise that's their
[1:31:59] largest account their largest account is
[1:32:02] criticism
[1:32:04] they have so little bit of praise
[1:32:07] for anybody
[1:32:08] they've got it in a special savings
[1:32:10] account and it's in a special safe
[1:32:13] locked up and locked up and locked up
[1:32:15] and locked up and the only one they use
[1:32:17] it on mostly is them
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:26] boy they rock and check you sorry low
[1:32:28] down good for nothing aggravating check
[1:32:30] after check after check after check
[1:32:35] i don't want to hurt your feelings but i
[1:32:37] don't want your jacks
[1:32:44] that's a challenge
[1:32:45] because i get some negative checks all
[1:32:47] the time
[1:32:48] you shouldn't have said that you should
[1:32:50] preach this this way you idiot
[1:32:52] let me say something you did not believe
[1:32:53] some of the emails and things i've got
[1:32:54] over the years been in the message
[1:32:56] people in this message will treat you

[1:34:23] thought
[1:34:24] and it won't be yours
[1:34:26] it'll be mine
[1:34:29] this world that i live in
[1:34:31] will be my world which i create
[1:34:34] according to how much i believe this
[1:34:36] word
[1:34:37] and the more i submit
[1:34:39] the more my world can be covered with
[1:34:41] this blessing
[1:34:43] and the more i retain to myself and
[1:34:45] refuse to give up
[1:34:47] the more i'll be bound i'll be a
[1:34:50] christian i'll be saved but my joy will
[1:34:52] be so limited my praise will be so
[1:34:55] little the purity that i see don't you
[1:34:57] understand why people have such a hard
[1:34:59] time seeing purity
[1:35:00] they don't have it in themselves
[1:35:02] to the pure all things are pure the
[1:35:04] reason is that because they are so
[1:35:06] filled with purity themselves they're
[1:35:08] co-looking from within how can a
[1:35:10] merciful person be unmerciful they can't
[1:35:13] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:35:15] obtain mercy
[1:35:17] how can a happy person constantly put
[1:35:19] off sadness they can't
[1:35:24] let's stand
[1:35:27] [Applause]
[1:35:41] now the lord will look at this next
[1:35:43] weekend but the contrast of this is
[1:35:45] romans chapter 8 verse 5. very next
[1:35:47] scripture there brother daniel
[1:35:49] for they that are after the flesh
[1:35:52] do mind the things
[1:35:55] of the flesh
[1:35:57] and the word their mind is aspire to
[1:36:01] something what drives you a force a
[1:36:03] desire
[1:36:04] which makes you want to achieve a
[1:36:06] certain goal
[1:36:08] so either we will mine the flesh
[1:36:11] or we will mine the spirit
[1:36:12] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:36:14] mind the things of the spirit but they
[1:36:17] that are the flesh rather but they that
[1:36:19] are after the spirit the things of
[1:36:23] the spirit
[1:36:29] i realize i put a lot out to you today
[1:36:32] but may god help us
[1:36:35] we can have a goal set before us

[1:38:50] many people can cry no more they can't
[1:38:52] laugh no more
[1:38:53] they can't rejoice no more
[1:38:55] it's like we're in a world of

[1:39:25] forgiveness and my kind of mercy and my
[1:39:28] god
[1:39:30] may god help me
[1:39:32] but i by the word of god can create a
[1:39:35] world
[1:39:36] and it's a non-existence not
[1:39:38] non-existent it is a real existent place
[1:39:45] a land of promises
[1:39:48] land of fulfillment
[1:39:50] land of purity
[1:39:51] in the midst of darkness and hell
[1:39:54] yet i can live and you can live
[1:39:56] as if though we were in a cocoon
[1:39:59] and within our souls
[1:40:01] heartache on every hand
[1:40:02] i sent brother jeff the text of the day
[1:40:04] and told him brother jeff
[1:40:06] we certainly rejoice

[1:40:13] certainly feel for you
[1:40:15] and your family and your church
[1:40:17] it's amazing is it for a child of god
[1:40:19] when they go beyond the other world into
[1:40:21] that other world
[1:40:22] you have two extreme emotional feelings
[1:40:26] you are so happy for them that you're so
[1:40:29] sad for the ones that leave behind
[1:40:31] and said for yourself that it wasn't you
[1:40:36] how in the world can we be such extreme
[1:40:38] that shows you what kind of person you
[1:40:39] are
[1:40:40] you are such an extreme person
[1:40:43] who contacts both worlds

[1:42:02] open this for us
[1:42:04] i want to be

[1:42:07] this preaching is to me as well
[1:42:11] lord jesus please help me help me god
[1:42:16] i know it'll be a real challenge for me
[1:42:19] because i'm exposed to so much
[1:42:20] difficulty and sorrow
[1:42:22] church troubles and
[1:42:24] lord having to counsel pastors from all
[1:42:26] over the world oh god sometimes i just
[1:42:29] get so weary of it all
[1:42:32] and i wish so many times you'd have left
[1:42:33] me down in kentucky
[1:42:35] lord pastor in that little church and
[1:42:37] i'd never had to come here
[1:42:39] never had to have an internet and a
[1:42:41] website and all that stuff where people
[1:42:43] would hear about us and oh how many
[1:42:45] times i wish i could have just been left
[1:42:47] alone
[1:42:49] yet lord
[1:42:50] i believe this was your plan
[1:42:53] so forgive me for thinking that
[1:42:56] lord you see our desires no doubt many
[1:42:58] of them think they wish they could just
[1:43:01] go back and live in the wilderness no
[1:43:02] wonder brother ben said if we had that
[1:43:04] faith
[1:43:05] have access to it we'd create our own
[1:43:06] private world and go live a profit life
[1:43:08] on it
[1:43:10] it was a man of great experience
[1:43:12] speaking what he would do himself
[1:43:15] help us lord
[1:43:17] it's been carol was talking about it
[1:43:18] last night and then this morning when i
[1:43:19] couldn't sleep lord i thought about it
[1:43:21] in my mind am i crazy
[1:43:23] and my nuts
[1:43:26] as i lay down and turned and tossed
[1:43:27] outside and i thought donny you're going
[1:43:29] crazy
[1:43:31] do you really think people
[1:43:33] can live this thing
[1:43:35] but god it's not what i said it's not my
[1:43:38] word
[1:43:39] it's yours
[1:43:42] i pray lord you'll help each of us
[1:43:44] father i have my hand on this prayer
[1:43:46] cloth for brother frank
[1:43:47] lord you see these needs in his body
[1:43:50] i pray in the name of jesus may your
[1:43:52] healing virtue go to our brother lord
[1:43:55] maybe others share in the building today
[1:43:56] lord they're sick they're suffering
[1:43:59] may the presence of god help them
[1:44:02] i'm sure all of us can say today lord we
[1:44:05] need help
[1:44:06] in our minds
[1:44:09] to the power of thought
[1:44:11] granted lord jesus
[1:44:13] if a man who is nothing
[1:44:16] can receive a thought from satan and
[1:44:18] convince him that he's something
[1:44:21] he can transcend a world of fact and
[1:44:23] reality
[1:44:25] and begin to believe he is something
[1:44:27] when in reality he's nothing
[1:44:30] that thought will change his attitude
[1:44:33] his behavior toward others
[1:44:36] that thought will change the way he
[1:44:37] treats other people
[1:44:39] and he's living in a world that is
[1:44:41] non-existent
[1:44:42] and he has deceived himself
[1:44:46] if that through the power of the
[1:44:47] negative thought can do that
[1:44:50] what about a child of god
[1:44:52] taking the word
[1:44:54] and shooting down all these other
[1:44:55] thoughts with that double barrel shotgun
[1:44:59] lord jesus what could it do for us
[1:45:03] the possibilities that lay before us
[1:45:06] when astronauts
[1:45:08] can transcend the gravitational pull of
[1:45:10] the earth
[1:45:12] when brother branham was here they went
[1:45:13] out and flew around the earth and made
[1:45:15] so many passes and come back
[1:45:18] but now they've excelled beyond that
[1:45:21] now they go out and live on the space
[1:45:23] station
[1:45:24] and they're there for months
[1:45:26] and over a year
[1:45:27] and there they live in that realm
[1:45:30] they're still in touch with the earth
[1:45:32] they have radio frequencies
[1:45:35] they get their meals from there still
[1:45:38] but for the most part gravitational pull
[1:45:40] doesn't affect them no more
[1:45:43] because they're living in a spiritual
[1:45:44] space station
[1:45:46] i'm talking about the spiritual
[1:45:48] astronaut now
[1:45:50] is it possible lord that we as your
[1:45:52] children
[1:45:53] could still live in this world and sure
[1:45:55] we'll think about bacon and eggs and
[1:45:57] think about going on picnics with their
[1:45:59] families
[1:46:00] these brothers that like to hunt they'll
[1:46:01] still plan on hunting trips and they
[1:46:03] like to fish or golf or these sisters
[1:46:06] like to get together and talk about new
[1:46:07] recipes they'll still do that
[1:46:10] but they're a spiritual astronaut
[1:46:13] in their soul
[1:46:14] they revert back at the end of the day
[1:46:17] during the middle of the day when they
[1:46:18] feel overwhelmed they write checks
[1:46:21] on their accounts of purity
[1:46:23] the accounts of
[1:46:24] honesty of a good report
[1:46:28] granted lord god
[1:46:30] help us out pray father
[1:46:33] oh lord jesus
[1:46:36] thank you lord
[1:46:38] how many believes it today
[1:46:40] with all your heart
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:46] hallelujah
[1:46:48] thank you lord jesus
[1:46:50] i've got to need my body i want to make
[1:46:51] known to you today i want you to pray
[1:46:53] for me i hate to trouble you but
[1:46:57] a few weeks ago i had something to
[1:46:58] happen in my eye
[1:47:00] and it was an arc of light about like
[1:47:02] this right above my eye
[1:47:04] and i would see it at certain times for
[1:47:06] sorry for a couple of days something
[1:47:07] like that
[1:47:08] and then the light itself disappeared
[1:47:11] but then i got this floater they call
[1:47:14] them right in the middle of my eye
[1:47:16] and uh there's a big one here small one
[1:47:18] here and small and there
[1:47:20] and i went to a doctor and the doctor
[1:47:23] looked at it dilated my eyes and
[1:47:26] i have what is called a posterior
[1:47:30] vitreous separation
[1:47:34] all of you know what that is i'm sure
[1:47:37] yeah right about like i did
[1:47:39] the eye contains 99.4
[1:47:43] water and liquid type of things in your
[1:47:45] eye
[1:47:46] it has a contents that's kind of
[1:47:48] jelly-like substance of atreus humor
[1:47:51] it's called which attaches itself to the
[1:47:53] back of the eye near the retina
[1:47:55] as you get older i don't show what
[1:47:57] happened to me but as you get older
[1:47:59] then your eye begins to age as the rest
[1:48:02] of your body does
[1:48:03] the vitreous humor on the back part of
[1:48:06] your eye can begin to pull away from
[1:48:08] your eye
[1:48:09] and when it does it can tear the retina
[1:48:12] it can be a partial tear or it can
[1:48:14] actually tear the retina completely
[1:48:16] loose from the eyeball
[1:48:17] and mine was a partial tear that was the
[1:48:20] circle of light that i was seeing the
[1:48:21] ark of light and then the floaters
[1:48:23] that's remained in my eye
[1:48:25] and the doctor was concerned that he
[1:48:28] wants to watch it because of a tree of
[1:48:29] schumer once it pulls off it's more
[1:48:31] weighty and more heavy than the retina
[1:48:33] so it can actually tear the retina loose
[1:48:35] from the back of the eyeball if it does
[1:48:38] you only have a matter of hours to get
[1:48:40] it reattached or you go blind because as
[1:48:43] the retina is tore loose from the eye it
[1:48:45] loses oxygen it loses blood flow
[1:48:48] so you go blind
[1:48:50] don't do at all because that ain't what
[1:48:51] i'm signing for
[1:48:53] i'm believing god for his grace
[1:48:55] but it is a serious type of situation
[1:48:58] and he said probably it's your age your
[1:49:00] 50s he said uh the left eye may do
[1:49:02] exactly the same thing well that's what
[1:49:04] he thought but i didn't sign for that
[1:49:06] either
[1:49:07] uh really nothing that they can do as
[1:49:09] far as for the floaters to turn the eye
[1:49:11] there is a laser procedure but yet not
[1:49:13] really much they can do if the retina
[1:49:15] does detach then they can go in by
[1:49:17] surgical procedure and and reattach it
[1:49:19] but for several weeks actually whenever
[1:49:21] i was going hunting in illinois and
[1:49:22] indiana that tormented me to death
[1:49:24] because looking in the trees looking in
[1:49:26] the fields and all that is constantly
[1:49:28] before my eye constantly moving right in
[1:49:30] the center of my eye whenever i set and
[1:49:32] study it just about drives me crazy
[1:49:35] because i'm sitting and looking at the
[1:49:36] computer i have to move my eye to one
[1:49:38] side up and down probably most of you
[1:49:40] got floaters so you know what i'm
[1:49:41] talking about but this one is just so
[1:49:43] huge
[1:49:44] but i believe
[1:49:46] in the power of prayer
[1:49:50] and i have confidence in faith in your
[1:49:53] prayers
[1:49:55] i believe
[1:49:58] you believe
[1:50:02] somebody sick
[1:50:16] who is it gracie
[1:50:18] lord jesus
[1:50:20] we pray for our little sister right now
[1:50:22] lord god
[1:50:23] in the name of jesus
[1:50:25] father may you move forward
[1:50:27] satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus
[1:50:31] you have no authority over the people of
[1:50:34] god we cash in on our account today in
[1:50:37] the promise of god in jesus name may the
