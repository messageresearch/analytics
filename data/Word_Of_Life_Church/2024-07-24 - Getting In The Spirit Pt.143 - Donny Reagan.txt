appointment that was slotted for Wednesday the 24th of July which is today at the hospital in Singapore to see the specialist doctor from the pelvic disorder Services Department way before I came over to visit the church to attend the special meetings I had several opport appointments prior to that before with another specialist and had gone through various procedures and Mr eyes for my problem I was diagnosed with prolapses of my pelvic floor organs and I was told that I needed to go for reconstructive surgery when I came over I came not only to worship attend the meetings and meet my pastor and his wife and to fellowship with all my sisters but also to be prayed for for healing both for Body Mind spirit and soul above all these is to meet him the Lord Jesus himself and to feel his awesome presence that I felt before I don't know brother J where you remember what I said to you when we spoke that I was afraid to go through the surgery and I wanted to be healed Naturally by the Lord and that I cannot return to Singapore without him when I went to the hospital today for further examinations and to find out more detail about the surgery that I would have to go through I told my doctor about the special meetings that I went to to get prayed for for my healing and about what happened while I was there when he finally got around to physically examining me and after doing all the necessary test on me he turned around and told me that all my organs have gone back to its original place and that I do not need any surgery at allall he said God has answered your [Applause] prayers good amen and there's there's there's a lot more to it but uh he just she just wanted to uh I will read this part of it just bear with I hate these phones by the way brother JD my brother is still in shock and stunned about today's outcome at the doctors he was with me for all my medical appointments and I told him before I left for America that I was going to go and get prayed for for my healing and he thought I was crazy but I did turn around and ask him why do you not think that the Lord will heal me nevertheless my brother never made any more attempts to keep me from going instead he did his utmost best to help me with my trip my brother can't seem to wrap his head around how did my organs get back in place because because he was there when the doctor showed us all the images

lost wretched what a mess we were in you imagine you singing songs of redemption and Holy Angels which never sinned will circle the Earth and bow their heads while you sing because by experience they don't know anything about Redemption but I do how many is with me I do praise the Lord let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 somebody's having a birthday tomorrow and it's a u special person to me been a great blessing to me for many many years and has you too my brother Harry when we started out together we certainly would have never thought we would be alive this long did we time going on this long I'm 68 and I'm going go ahead and tell you how old he will be he'll be 64 tomorrow so but we're grateful that we've given our lives to the Lorden give him to him when we were young and used our whatever abilities that we would have for the kingdom of God and we believe that we're going to be together for eternity it's been an honor for me to be able to have Harry in my Ministry for so many many years and it's been an honor to be a brother but he's a double brother same mother and father in this life and same heavenly father in the life that is to come I love you Harry 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery wow I show you a mystery now what kind of man would it be that would take this upon himself to say such a thing behold I show you a mystery it's either one of two things a man that is a presumptuous liar or a man that has had a visitation from God which is what we believe behold I show you a mystery now let me share with you the meaning of the word mystery hidden thing secret religious Secrets confided only to the initiated and not to ordinary Mortals I've been I'm blessed by that meaning aren't you praise the Lord a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding a hidden purpose or counsel secret will of men or God the secret councils which govern God in dealing with the righteous which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to The Godly well I guess we can say amen and go home that is a sermon within itself is it not now that you know the meaning of the word let me read it to you again behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep I remember 1 Corinthians is written around 5960 ad so Paul is still thinking that the Lord Jesus could come in his day what you notice he doesn't place this all in the future but he said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed so whether they're in the grave in the sixth Dimension their bodies sleeping or we're alive we shall all be changed now listen in a moment in a moment I love the meaning of this word too y'all know how I am I love meanings in a moment in an atom of time a point of time which can not be cut or divided it's so small and so fast that you couldn't even cut it in two in a moment a single instant immediately it will be done instantaneous ly glory in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump and this is not Donald J at the last Trump now the word last here is denoting that which is the consummation or the closing of all things it's not like that it's the last after 27 or the last after 73 but this Trump is a closing it will be the end of the economy of this world connected with the last state of things in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality now watch He's dealing with the dead as we call it and the living this corruptible he's talking about those that have gone by the way of the Grave so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality listen to these next words then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written he's quoting from Isaiah now deaths is swallowed up and victory now I guess I guess what I'm trying to understand about this is why this would wait to be fulfilled in the bride's resurrection and not Jesus Jesus resurrection isn't it amazing that that scripture was not fulfilled whenever he raised from the dead on Easter morning can't you see how he's tied Us in with the completion of his victory his victory is not ultimate the end and reached what he wanted it to be until the bride has heard listen to this again then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory praise God and he loves him tonight with all your heart like to be remembered as we pray got a request in need we got several folks in the church that are sick Brother Brad Gilbert had heard from him today I'm sure brother Lou are requested prayer for him but he's facing a procedure tomorrow think he's got Mercy on his knees swallowed up just gigantic certainly needs our prayers let's just uh take these things before the Lord Lord Jes Jesus as I stand here tonight I look across this pulpit and I see brother Levi walls standing here Lord with his shoulder and this slang and pulled it out again the other day and father you see what the MRI said and want to get a second opinion on it again Lord we believe you're The God Who made the shoulder and the muscles and the tendons and the senu and all of that father we pray for our brother in the name of Jesus May the healing virtue of Jesus Christ go to our brother right now father we pray I didn't hear all the requests that Brother Louie read and made known but I ask you Lord that You' be mindful of each one of them brother Brad Gilbert ask me in particular if I'd mention it Lord about his need and Jesus may you extend your mercy to him moved him to the med center today and Father we pray in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God go to our brother other needs father of those that are sick and can't be here tonight and maybe some didn't really feel like coming but they pressed on anyway would you be mindful of every one of them we believe you are the same yesterday today and forever as we've gathered here tonight once again to feed upon the unfailing body word of the the son of man may you come in this place Lord may you help us open our understanding speak to us the word of God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you Saints you may be seated so when the Lord Jesus raised from the dead there was certainly great scriptures from the Old Testament and also the types that he fulfilled at his resurrection and yet he did not fulfill in the fullness this one that I just read you and yet brother Brenham said it over and over again that is one of the greatest events that the world had ever known it was great when he created in man it was great when he made the animals and the elements of the stars and all the botney life and all the divine order in the heavens and the divine order on the earth and all that was wonderful but yet when he raised from the dead what a great victory that was and yet he did not fulfill this scripture he kept that scripture for another day which would be our day and Paul now again I'll call your attention that Paul is the only author in the New Testament that writes about the order of the Resurrection not one of the writers of the four gospels not Peter and his Epistles not even John in the Book of Revelation or first second or third John writes and gives us the order that we just read about from what Paul wrote now remember Corinthians was wrote before Revelation was but God allocated the word the mystery form of what was going to be given I'll tell you one thing after the service here Sunday I have had one nuclear explosion after another as I've started recollecting and thinking of the things that the Lord Jesus actually never set in order himself about this new move called the church but he actually used his men servants that would come years later and they were the ones that begin to give the order of the church how the church should operate how the church should deal with disciplinary action in the body what they should do how they should baptize how they should should do all these things oh my I I I've just been having a time with that realizing that the Lord has committed so much of the gospel and the Mystery of the church to his own body in feminist form which is the bride now here we see the unfolding of the Rapture the coming of the Lord and the resurrection and the changing of the living the exact same way and you find you look at you saying the Lord Jesus never told us this order himself he said Luke 21:36 pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man Matthew 24:24 the anointed ones in the last day he told us watch for his coming but yet he never mentioned nothing about a shout a voice or a trumpet he never mentioned nothing like what Paul read said to us right here in 1 Corinthians 15 about the corruptible the uncorruptible and a moment of time the Lord Jesus never said nothing about that but he committed it to his continuing Ministry through his sons oh praise be to God now remember in that Resurrection when he let out the loud voice from the cross actually the Earth went into nervous prostration and began to shake and a great earthquake happened now Matthew tells us in Matthew 2751 if you'd like to read it on down through 53 and 54 it's very good four five verses there that whenever the Lord Jesus be to shout and scream out that there was an earthquake the graves open which would have been mainly sepers with a stone either laying up horizontal or vertical and whenever he let out this shout the stones were rolled away but the bodies didn't get up now people have taken that and they've typed our resurrection and our rapture in the last day to be the same way but you see God knows how to proportion his word and make it fit to a particular need so he needed living witnesses that he had conquered death hell and the grave but not only for himself but for his elect when he emptied out paradise so then Matthew goes on to say that after his resurrection then many of these saints were seen in the city now he wanted that to be known so Matthew which I again remind you that Matthew is the only writer in the entire Cannon of the New Testament that spoke about it which is phenomenal to me something that had never happened since the fall of Man on the earth that a resurrection of this magnitude had taken place and only one man in the New Testament wrote about it I just find that phenomenal but yet God needed living Witnesses of that first resurrection so then the Bible says they appeared in the city unto many now remember they had a glorified body so it's like they could walk right through that wall right there they didn't need a window they didn't need a door the Lord Jesus didn't need one which is exactly the way our Resurrection will be now remember in the resurrection no doubt I'll have a lot of visitors if I'm alive because being a pastor and having buried a lot of people and preached a lot of funerals in a lot of places and I got friends all over the world and I I I won't just have people my sheep that will appear to me on Resurrection morning but once they are raised from the dead they can actually travel like a salt well that's not a mystery to me cuz that's actually the way we got here in the first place we traveled as a thought from the mind of God when we took up our baby form body so we traveled as a thought and in the resurrection we will travel again like us Sal but in a glorified state so many of those then that will enter in the resurrection will take place first and then you know it won't be long it doesn't say exactly how long but it won't be long that you're going to be changed so once they enter into that glorified body they could walk through walls they could appear disappear remember they will hi have their ability given to them Divine ability to travel in dimensional travel which we cannot do we're limited by time so if I accept some of the invitations to Johannesburg South Africa that I'm getting offered and to Uganda and Zimbabwe and all of that I I don't dread the brothers and sisters I don't dread the meetings what I dread the most is that travel traveling from the US to Johannesburg South Africa the third longest flight in the world 19 and 1 half hours on one plane why I'm limited by time but can you imagine when this happens our brothers and sisters will raise and they'll call their bodies from the dust of the earth and by seed they've entered into the theopen then they will bring that to this midair Dimension and meet their glorified body now say for instance that I have friends in South Africa in Kenya in Tanzania in China in Norway in Switzerland in Iceland all over the world and they don't once say raised from the dead they will be able to travel unlike anything that we've ever done before it would take me longer to get into my car tonight after church then they could make a visit in their home Church in Nairobi Kenya and the next thought they're in my bathroom with me brushing my teeth and then they decide they want to go to Jeffersonville cuz that's where they figure The Profit will be and then he decides he wants to go down to Georgia and they want to go to Illinois and they want to go here and it's just as simple as thinking about it now I know you're looking at me really strange and you think I'm from another world tonight don't you I am I am from another world I think on worldly things I'm waiting for travel that will be Beyond this world we're so limited by see taste feel smell hear but there is another world that's no more than 20 feet from where we are right now oh Hallelujah and in that world you and I before long will be burst into now watch this so the Lord needed live witnesses that would be able someone in the cities around there no doubt had wrote it now I've been there to David's tomb and what's amazing is that there were were David's uh Seer and his gigantic big Stone box thing that he is I I I found it amazing in being there a few years ago that that building that was there of course is not one of the original ones that would date back to the time of where the apostles received the Holy Ghost but but it was part of the foundational structure of that and the upper room where they supposedly receive the Holy Ghost is built on the site of where David's tomb was so it makes the scripture in the New Testament to where it said even as David Our Father which is here to this day so when they were in the upper room the original Upper Room it was like a second story over where David's body was laying downstairs so you imagine here they got the Holy Ghost up here and David God raised him from down there 40 days prior to that and here they are on the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost God raised David 40 days down on the first level God raised them 50 days later up on the second level amen now you seen that all of those saints of God that were there and remember whenever job died and he said I know that my redeemer liveth and someday in the last days I will stand upon the Earth though my skin worms though my skin worms will destroy my body my flesh yet in my flesh I I will see God and joob was buried then in this certain place in a field of mpil and in there was a cave and you remember that Abraham when Sarah died that Abraham went and bought this field and according to the heran texts which was found many many years ago which dated back to during the time frame of the Hittites of the hurian law and it would have dated close to the time that Abraham was on the earth and the amount of money that Abraham paid for that field would have been astronomical it would have been unbelievable just comparing the price that he paid for that field compared to the Common Real Estate because the hurian text and what they did they made it in in a kuna form they call it and then it was there so they had transactions of selling cattle and selling property and all that sort of thing so they found it many many years ago thousands of years old and it it gave the price of a piece of property so in comparison to what Abraham paid it would have seemed as if though they set him on fire and you imagine them old hitp boys I mean they thought they went away from their life and but I I can imagine myself that when the deal was closed from that day it was Abraham that went away life him because by Revelation he knew that the resurrection was going to be in a certain place so Sarah was buried there Abraham was buried there Isaac was buried there Rebecca was buried there whenever Jacob and was down in Egypt and when every before he died he told his son swear to me upon the god of my fathers that you will not leave me down here in the land of Egypt why because the Resurrection the first resurrection was not going to be in Egypt unlike our Resurrection it will be all over the whole Earth but now remember that Resurrection was going to be it was going to be Regional you had to be in a certain spot in order to partake of it so Jacob makes his sons swear so whenever they come out of the land of Egypt here they come 430 years later and they're carrying the coffin of Jacob and where do they put him they put him in heon so right there in that cave right now they have this gigantic massive building that is built over there over the the tombs of the Patriarchs now remember this is also a holy place to the Muslims which in one way it's probably a good thing or they would have destroyed it because whenever they get in and they get property where it belongs to the Jews whenever they exchanged part of their property for peace as they call it they went in and destroyed many of the ancient relics of Jewish history because they can't stand it that the Jews can trace back their history farther back than they can so whenever they got part of this stuff they went in there and dug it up and destroyed it but because they rever and look at Abraham now they are the ones actually for many years that watched over this tomb I hate to be the breaker of bad news but Abraham ain't there Sarah ain't there Isaac and Rebecca they ain't there they done had a resurrection you see it was them so in that day their Resurrection would answer according to the need of the hour and God wanted it to be visible but alas ours is totally different now will the dead raise they will but will there be empty Graves all over the Earth so so well I walk out to the graveyard and I'll I'll walk into the Happy Valley Memorial there I buried many of our Saints right there well I'll walk up on the hill second tier up and find brother and sister stamper's grave open well I'll walk down and see brother Jim and see Erica's grave open no I will not I will not go on the back and find this one and that one of many many that I can name our Resurrection is not to be that way ours is to be a secret so in order for it to be a secret then he will make our Resurrection match the need of the day everybody with me now what's this and God hiding himself in Simplicity the Rapture will come in such a simple way till the judgment will fall and they'll see the son of man and they'll say wasn't we supposed to have such and such wasn't there to be an Elias sent to us and wasn't there supposed to be a Rapture and Jesus will say it's already happened and you didn't know it God in Simplicity now remember that in that day it was to be written that God give the type of course out of Ezekiel whenever he said that he would raise the their dead bodies and he was speaking about the resurrection of the nation but also he was going to have a time that he would call their bodies from the dust of the earth notice again the Rapture there'll be so few that'll go in that bride now see how the teachers has got it they've got charts and they show 10 million people coming up here and all the Methodist if it's a Methodist preacher if it's a Pentecostal all the Pentecostals coming it'll never touch it it'll be maybe listen one leave Jeffersonville now you see God and His prophets and sometimes just his preachers will say things in such a way to kind of put us on edge and make us a little bit nervous why cuz we're still living in this animal body and it gets kind of cold sometimes and it gets kind of slack sometimes can anybody say Amen any of y'all ever get spiritually lazy you ever get you know where you just don't you know it's not like you're cussing out running around getting drunk all that sort of thing but you get just get so busy with life and it's so it's so much easier to just put the spiritual things off and give everything that we are to work and everything that we are to business and everything we are to everything else and then we give the Lord The Leftovers so notice how he says this that there'll maybe be one one that'll leave Jeffersonville just somebody come up missing they'll say well the rest of them won't know there'll be one leave Georgia or there be one leave in Africa and let's say there' be 500 people living that will go in the translation now that ain't the church body this is the bride that ain't the church this is the bride the church will come up by the thousands but that's in the next Resurrection they live not for the space of a thousand years see but if a bride if 500 people left the Earth this very minute the world would know nothing about it brother Donnie 500 you mean that's all and I remember the message as far as the revelation after the seals the seals this is when he's preaching it it's just starting after the Revelation is starting to open up in its fullness so the message is not just the healing it he says it's not when the seventh angel first started out but when the message started the message the message it's just starting to break whenever these seals are coming forth oh sure there's all kinds of things preach in the 50s absolutely tremendous wonderful things but now the Mysteries are coming open in the book remember who it is it's Christ himself so things are going to be said that had never been said before now he said Jesus said there'll be one in the bed I'll take one and leave one that's at nighttime there'll be two in the field on the other side of the earth I'll take one and leave one as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so say it would be nighttime here and it might be daytime in Africa or in New Zealand as you cross the international dat line it would be a different time so the Lord Jesus in saying this but he still leaves it in Parable form think everything will move just as common as it can be now remember the resurrection will take place theophanies by the thousands or Millions will be released from the sixth Dimension dust bodies will be called from the Earth by the millions living Saints will gradually get in the cycle and be caught up by thousands or tens of thousands or whatever it is and the world will go right on they'll get up they'll go to work they'll check their news they'll check their phone they'll continue right on with the same old thing and it will be such a small minority in compared to the billions of people that live on the earth hardly nobody will know the difference well you say brother Donnie if that's true there's no need for me to even try well if that's the way you feels it shows there's something wrong with your experience with God you need to have the type of relationship with the Lord that if we knew there was only five leaving out of Word of Life Church that you know one of them five is going to be you now you say I don't know who them other four are but I know one thing I have passed from Death unto life I'm not the person I was I love the Lord Jesus I believe his word now come on children if you don't feel that way it's time you got to pray it because you need to be so sure about where you stand with God that even when you hear these serious types of sermons that it does not scare you to death oh sure when I hear them I look too and I think Lord is there anything there is there anything there I don't worry about missing the Rapture I'm part of what's going on right now the Rapture is only another step of where I am this very night Enoch walked with God day by day by day by day he wasn't backslid the day before the Rapture and then five minutes before the Rapture he made this right and made that right and made that right and made that right and he lived like the world and acted like the world absolutely not he lived every day as if though it would be his life day the real bride of Jesus Christ is living every day so that if the Lord Jesus comes or if he calls them from the earth before the sun sets tonight that we can be ready and I think we ought to be to live as if though this could be our last day on Earth and the church said notice everything will move just as common as it can be a fanatic message will go by uhuh a fanatic message will go by and the first thing you know this Minister was going somewhere and he never come back he probably went into the woods hunting never returned no more and this fellow went somewhere you know what happened I believe that young girl she must have been caught away somewhere you know somebody take that girl out and ravish her probably throw her in the river now this happens every day there are people who come up missing on the Earth every day all you've got to do is go to the United States Post Office no matter what state you're in and you will find a board on that board is pictures names addresses dates of birth so and so been missing since whatever it was life seen so and so Justin so and so people that they can't find you imagine what the Rapture is going to be at the post office that'll be my picture in a few days that'll be your picture in a few days anybody seen Harry Reagan just had a birthday the other day Paul God did him hard hard to get to enjoy 64 at all he's much happier being under 20 than he will be a 64 I can guarantee you that it will be so comp common that they'll simply just add more pictures on the wall of the post office except for the message people who sat around the message and never really lived it never applied it to their lives they played Church they come to church when they wanted to come on somebody my brother and sister I hope this don't embarrass you and your daughter these Saints is with us on on Sunday here again tonight going to be here again Sunday these folks drove 16 hours to come to church so I asked him Sunday after service in my office y'all come on a vacation my brother said no I said a church vacation he said yeah a church vacation 16 hours one way and they said this one service was worth that entire drive so what's it going to be now think of it friends what's it going to be for people who live 15 20 minutes away 30 minutes away from church and they come whenever they want to and you know they pray when they want to and read their Bible when they want to I say it's going to be bad my friends it's going to be bad one of these days we're going to realize this is not a game we are not here to play church this is our lives this is our souls this is the most important thing of our life lives we ought to treat it thus notice this oh my how it will be she was missing and 99 out of every say maybe one out of every hundred million will ever know anything about it unless somebody's acquainted Lord have mercy children you talking about a sad situation wouldn't it be awful for a husband hband that he wakes up one morning his wife's gone her shoes are there her robe is there everything is there her phone is there she never leaves her phone she never leaves this she never leaves that well maybe she got up and read her Bible her her her toothbrush but what in the world has happened you imagine him then realizing oh god what have I done I missed it I played church I I I I I knew this was right I knew it was right oh children may God help us may we be more on fire oh you say brother Donnie you mean people would do that to miss it no you and I know better than that we know that there is election involved in the Rapture there is predestination involved in the Rapture but I'll tell you one thing even if I was a lot I'd rather be going and hanging around where Abraham was than be living down there in Sodom you can look and see what happened to him I I've never seen my name on The Book of Life but I believe it's there but if I serve him I live for him I preach for him I do everything I can do for him and I'm still not bride I'll say glory to God I do it again he's been so good to me he has blessed me he's helped me he's healed me he's saved me I believe with all of that he's going to call me in the Rapture I believe with all of my heart we're part of it [Applause] oh my and when they say the graves well open how is the graves G to open I haven't got time to get into this what I wanted to I'm going to have to take this just to show you the Simplicity of God calcium potach everything when everything that's in you materials only makes a spoonful that's right and when does that break on back into spirit and life listen now here it is God just speaks and the Rapture will come this is how hard it is God just speaks and the Rapture will come so it's not [Music] us D why you trying to change myself you're going to cause your blood pressure to go up you better quit so what can I do what can I do live every day live every day a consecrated life of a son or daughter of God oh my if you're alive and well and fil with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the token is on your soul God speaks and the same God that called you out of that world that same God oh Hallelujah you will How Will I Know How will I know it was the same voice that called you my brother sister when you was in a world of darkness and you was in the Smite of the world and so groped in sin you thought there was no way out but something got a hold of you something spoke that same voice will speak again God just speaks and the Rapture will come it ain't going out there and the angels come down and shovel out the graves and get out an old dead carcass what is it it's morning sin to begin with but a new one made in its image God let you come to to the Earth to get your hair color your eye color your stature much of that remember when the prophet saw him beyond the curtain of time he said they were men they were women it's not like when we get to heaven it's a unisex sort of thing but the women still had long hair and they look like women and he said they were in the form and shape of women come on children God ain't a transgender God he made a male and female at the beginning that's the right idea and it's still the right idea today well Hallelujah so when we get to heaven it's still going to be the same thing the sons and the daughters of God and there you will have your hair and your skin color and all that that don't think everybody in heaven is going to be white you white people don't think everybody in Heaven's going to be black or going to be Asian or whatever more God loves variety there'll be blackheads red heads brond Heads there'll be brunette and but there won't be no gray head praise the Lord that's exactly right because grhe headed is a sign of old age oh yes but God will speak and the Rapture will come amen it will be a new one made in its likeness you know see if we have this we'll die again nobody will say the graves will open the dead will walk out that may be true but not open the way you you say open that's right it won't be like that it'll be a secret so does it matter to God where it's the same handful dust that's six foot down in a grave or a handful right off the top of the ground God didn't make man from clay six foot under but he made him from dust on top amen God didn't get a shovel to go down there and get a mic and you know grub and ho post to di I'm going to go down about 6ot deep now I'm going to get some that good old solid red clay and a little bit of that Michel P right I'm going get a little bit God just reached down by the Michael and just picked up a little bit of dust right on the face of the Earth there and he said I'm going to make me a boy I'm going to make me a son I'm going to give him a house to live in and what did God make him out of he made it him out of the Dust my father specializes in making his children 's bodies out of dust then he don't have to send Angels down there with a shoveling crew all night before the resurrection and say all right Gabriel Michael wormwood go on down and everybody go to digging them out but the Lord God will speak and the resurrection will happen Oh Glory it'll be a secret because he said he would come as a thief in the night he's already told us this Rapture then the judgments will strike the Rapture oh my the judgments will strike after towards the plague sickness and everything the people will cry for death that's right to take them you think it's hard now there's something in most of us we fight to live we'll take treatments if we're diagnosed with some type of some other and sometimes the treatments is about as bad as the disease you got we'll do whatever they tell us to do we'll take supplements we'll take this that and the other well you've got to get this shot and you've got to start running you've got to okay okay okay I want to live I want to live but can you imagine when the bride is gone it'll be so bad so bad that people will cry oh D take me take me right I don't want to live another day take me death yes sir why don't Believers believe the simple signs of his coming they're expecting all these things that spoke up by the scripture like the moon's going to go down in the middle of the Sun in the middle of the day and there's going to be all kinds of things oh if we just I've got notes for here on it just to show them what those things are we'll get into it the breaking of the seals this week anyhow there it is just where it's already passed and you didn't know it see if it is the Angel of the Lord will break them seals forth to us remember it seal with them seven mysterious Thunders now why can't people believe the simple Simplicity of a humble bunch of people the voice of the signs of God why can't they believe it just it's always been the true word of God being made Manifest this is the reason they're too smart and too educated to believe the simple form of the written word he tells us the same thing in this same message here in the days of Noah that were too smart too educated to believe the message of a simple man about building an ark and then the end results was he said this they lost their being we've all lost things before wallet glasses Keys we know how upset anything of value is when we lose it but Jesus Jesus says if a man loses his soul what would he give an exchange for his soul and there's only one way my friends that you and I will never lose our soul we must make a deposit of our soul into the hands of the only being who can keep it I cannot keep my soul you cannot keep your soul no person can keep our own soul by oursel but if we can commit our soul into the hands of the Lord Jesus it will be safe forever is that right oh my notice Lord Jesus help us they're too educated to believe the simple form of the written word they want to put their own interpretation to it oh it don't mean this and it don't mean that it don't mean that notice again in question answers the unbelievers will wonder what's happened now we break in again about a question about the resurrection what's the matter with them people where did they go oh God they'll not understand they'll not even see him but the church shall see him that is the called out the elected the Born Again they'll just disappear they'll just disappear they won't know where they're at they just know they're missing now some of your sister may be sing at Kroger Food City or Walmart and you're in line you've got your wallet in your hand and you're you're fixing to check out and all of a sudden you're gone you imagine a person standing behind you one morning they look at you and the next moment they look back and you ain't even there your wallets fell on the floor your purs has fell on the floor which that won't last long it's rotten and thieving as people are in the day we're living in they look at it as a as a blessing won't There's an opportunity you're standing there and the next minute you're gone you're wherever you are around the world day or night and you will absolutely disappear now what you do is you disappear into another dimension you haven't gone into heaven yet you've actually moved Hallelujah into that other realm where you are getting together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth boy some of y'all are looking at me funny tonight they'll just disappear they won't know where they're at they just know they're missing they will be be with their Lord praise be to God notice again the third seal now the angel sent down a bunch of angels down there with some Spades and dig up the graves the Bible said we'll be changed even before you could backat your eye just to twinkle it's all over that quick and just say somebody disappeared going to be on the camp think of it missing people they can't see you no more so here they are sitting at a table I'm having your morning coffee you're sitting there eating your breakfast two three of them with the Holy Ghost one without two without whatever it is you're just sitting there talking about what you going to do today well I thought I'd do the laundry I thought I'd go to the grocery store then I thought I'd pick up the grandchild going here there you're just living you're just living your everyday life like a Christian is supposed to be cuz the life live but the word is the word express you're sting out your cup of coffee in your hand and all of a sudden you're changed from aortal to Immortal and I know some of y'all love that Cofe you think you've got to have it beyond the curtain of time you won't e it then you won't even get a headache either you'll you'll be sitting there drinking your coffee and eating your morning Little Debbie or your eggs or whatever it is that you like and all of a sudden a sweep will come over your B oh Hallelujah to God and your cells will change your bones will change your skin will change your fingernails your hair if you ain't got nothing don't worry saving every one of them all that'll come back can you imagine you might be sitting there and you got a you got a stainless steel hip and you got a plastic elbow and you got plastic and Alloys and all kinds of stuff all over you I never thought about it till the other day but apparently the Lord's just going to do a great big powerful thing and he'll change stainless back to Eternal he'll change plastic even made in China and he'll turn it right around and am man there you'll be in a moment in a twinking of them now you'll be Chained and if you got dentur in there don't worry you w't have to lay him out on the table he can can change them too if he wants to he can change plastic he can change ceramic I know he can he changed an old hard-headed sinner like me and he changed a whole hard-headed sinner like you who's saying he can't make plastic into eternal life come on somebody the main thing is for us to be ready and live every day of our life every moment of our life as if though he could come right now oh think of it missing people can't see you no more now this leads me to believe that they were seeing some of them let's just said they turned to get a little creamer for their coffee and they and Mom I I was saying mom mom so we go to the living room you go to the bedroom we go to the bathroom he said mom Mom where are you Dad they can't see you no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group everybody's got people they're going to hang out with this is the kind of people I want to hang out with the group oh yes we're going to be identified aren't we oh my when I preach brother Jared Phil sh Lord give me that thought about them being gathered to their people Well everybody's being gathered to their people right now that's why you see certain Sinners that like to do certain things and they hang around a group that does what they like to do and then you got another group of Sinners and they hang around this and then you got church people and they hang around this certain church group because that's what they want oh but I guarantee you one thing there's another group amen they love the Lord and they've got a group waiting for them on the other side and the Bible said that Abraham was gathered to his people and Isaac was gathered to his people and Jacob was gathered to his people and when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time the voice said you have been gathered to your people hallelujah what's going to happen in the resurrection it's going to be the largest gathering of people that has ever been known to men some have been in the sixth dimension for thousand thousands of years some have been living on this life for maybe 50 60 70 years and all of a sudden one event the spoken word of God will cause those Hallelujah to be turned loose out of that sixth Dimension and the rest of us will be changed by the power of God and it'll be the largest youth Gathering that's ever been on the Earth amen no old people welcome you talking about a youth meeting praise be to God notice they which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder the word is those which are asleep not dead Christians don't die they're just taking a little rest that's all the Trump of God shall sound the dead and Christ shall rise first appear to many and all at once you stand and look well there's a brother he says this this way several times so back in the 50s he says there's brother diarch and he mentioned several people from his church that had passed on so you're just standing there just doing everyday normal stuff of what you do and then you look and say Lord have mercy see there's mama look there's Grandpa there's that's brother Homer Arnold except a younger version my there there's brother Calvin Ward there's oh my lord it's on it's on the move is on well I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now it's already on right now the move for the bride is on you see the loosing of the seals and the breaking of those mysteries of God started something by the revealing of the word that has not stopped or slowed down and it will not stop until this bride is caught up in Rapture praise be to God all it wants you happen to stand and look well there's a brother you know what ain't long in a few minutes will be changed wow so you're standing there talking to them they're looking at you maybe motioning for you and here you are you're still Immortal you're still captured in this body and you're looking at them and they're all around you and in a few minutes we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and together with them be missing on Earth so you mean we're still going to be here for a bit just just not seeable to the unregenerated you talking about a time won't we have a time brother Joel Brown doing an awesome job on that Sunday oh you talking about a time so we're getting together and we're all left here for just a few minutes however long it is we're getting together with the rest of the group and we're fellowshipping and we're having a time right here on the earth we're missing but it's like we're here but not here it's because our astronaut space suit amen we have it on you see and we breathe different than the rest of the world us we see different we have our own controlled environment so when the astronauts go out into outer space you know they they don't have gravitational pull they don't have the oxygen and this and that and the other that that we have here so each one of them has to put on a certain suit that's a real child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so here we are out here on the world all the darkness all the SMUD all the filth all around them but we're walking around with with an astronaut suit on we got our own oxygen we got our own communication we've got our own thing it amazes me how that they can be able to radio out there to those that the International Space Station and those guys way out yonder I can't even get the weather on my phone in my bathroom every morning I get up and try to check the weather on my cell phone and you know can you hear me now can you hear me now I had to walk to there and Carol said this morning she said this crazy phone that beats all I ever seen can't even get the weather well it's because they've got a stronger signal than what I've got with Verizon I'm not kicking against Verizon now it's the same way with the bride of Christ every Christian has a little bit of a signal a pull from God they love the Lord oh thank God for Calvary oh Jesus I love you I love you they have a little signal but the bride has got a direct contact so even though she seemed like she's so far away in distance she's got more signal because he beams out powerful signal right down through the crost to Pentecost and comes right on down through the breaking of the word each one of the is an amplifier the signal that comes down and Shadows over the bride Soul bursts the very token of God in her and then she is his spitting image on the earth hallelujah hallelujah and when the Rapture gets ready to take place you won't get a text you won't get a wash laap you won't get a zoom or you won't get nothing like that he just speaks and all over the world it starts happening the Dead starts raise it up Hallelujah and they start appearing to the saints of God and we start getting together glory to God can you imagine you think you're under anticipation now can you imagine being surrounded as a pastor I might be surrounded by 25 or 30 or 400 or 500 me standing there Immortal Carol standing there Immortal and I'm wanting to change I'm wanting to go I'm wanting to get out of here Lord I'm not a very patient guy anyway I'll be standing there come on Lord come on Lord but I know it'll happen right at the right time hallelujah amen aren't you glad remember the prophet was up there they the curtain of time when he had the translation and he reached up and touched his head and his hair was back one of these days you'll reach down and you look oh them spots are all gone them gray hairs are gone Hallelujah why because you have been tied in to the reveal word of this hour let people laugh at us let them call us crazy let them do whatever they want to do but one of these days don't come looking for me because I'll be gone I'll be a part of that resurrection and life I will have been changed by the power of [Applause] God now the first thing happens when we're resurrected the ones which are living will just still remain the resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there will be Awakening time those which are asleep in the dust now those that are asleep in sin cuz they sleep right on they don't wake for another thousand years but those who are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption and the rapturing grace of the Lord then we'll all get together there's something about children of God and fellowship I remember Dr Bosworth told brother Brandon one time he said brother brand you know what Fellowship is he said well brother Bosworth I think I do he said it's Two Fellas and one ship but in this meeting it's going to be many fellows and their Darlings praise God God you imagine for our first time our first few moments in a glorified body every now and then when we get caught up into the presence of God and it's like the Lord opens our eyes and we can see farther than we've ever seen before we get under the channel of the anointing and we can think different I'm not explain it to you but as a preacher you get under that you're privileged by the mercy of God to get under under that and sometimes it it's it's hard hard to describe but it's like you're thinking in in a way that's beyond your thinking you're looking in a way that's beyond you're looking you're perceiving in a way that's beyond your own personal perception and you know that it is and you're there just momentarily and then you come back to yourself but can you imagine when we finally move out of these senses oh Hallelujah and we're able to see like we've never seen before we'll be able to love like we've never loved before we'll be able to experience Fellowship goodness grace mercy all the attributes of God in a way like we have never even known it and he allows us a little bit of time as we say in our modern vernacular just to kind of hang out together a little bit and y'all just kind of Fellowship a little a bit well you know it's sort of like we do after service whenever we're going to have a meal over here in a fellowship hall and we'll say now we're going to pray over the food and then y'all will be served shortly so some people go outside and they stop and talk and some people make it through on the the bigger four you're there and they stop and talk and then maybe somehow come to the door and say it's already if yall want to come on well we're having a little bit of fellowship before we sat down for the marriage supper of the L glory to God glory to God than so we're getting together and shaking one another's hands oh Jesus Lord God then we all get together then we begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not seek death but just of a sudden there'll be like a sweep go over us now you see the bride is used to sweeping you remember the parable that Jesus gave about the woman that had the coins and she lost the coin in her house and she started ah sweeping now of course we know that it was a tablet that her husband gave her and it was several coins and she wore it up here like a crown so if she lost one of those it was a sign she was an impure woman so much of our Lives has meant sweeping so we sweep out under the bed we sweep out under the closet yeah preachers are good sweepers aren't they God uses them boy they'll get back in them Corner they got them big long brooms and them big long handles man then go in there pull out things that you didn't even know was there you say oh my good well the brides used to sweeping now you see the church don't like sweeping Church gets angry Church gets upset you know a lot of oh don't tell me how to live you shut up just tell me how good I am how sweet I am how perfect I am how right I am but the bride's been used to sweeping so the last thing the Lord's going to do while she's Immortal is one more sweep Oh Glory to God it'll be your last sweep for eternity praise be to God you see sweeping don't scare us sweeping don't bother us if there's anything in US Lord show us show us get under the bed Lord clean out the drawers do whatever we need to do oh Lord just just do whatever we need to do oh my then there'll be a a sweep go over and your chain and you turn back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman watch this Sudden Change and after a while you're traveling like a salt I do that when I'm preaching my mind is so geared whenever I preach Sunday when I was preaching about about the Garden of Eden first 15 minutes whatever it was that wouldn't nowhere in near on on the to the notes had no text no no scriptures no nothing for that that was just straight from his presence I told Carol after we left pulled out of the parking lot here I told her I said I was right there in the Garden of Eden she said I was right there with you so what is it when we hear that preach but skip our thoughts you see what I'm saying our thoughts my thoughts your thoughts can go back to the Garden of Eden thousands of years ago how many was there Sunday you was right there was you you was out there watching the animals you was there with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden so what was you doing your thoughts traveled back in time and you went right back to the Garden of Eden I saw him take her by the hand I saw him I saw Adam standing there in my mind I saw him there not like a vision now but just in my mind I saw I saw Eve standing there with the blonde hair and the blue eyes I saw her standing lead her head over on Adam's chest there and the tears running down his her eyes and mixing him with his run down the garments the bloody sheep skin I saw it one of these days I'll be able to travel like a salt so after a while you're traveling like a salt and you can see those who were already resurrected oh what an hour then we'll gather with them then we'll gather with them and be caught up with them

knows if we ever needed him we need him now our world is insane our world is groping in darkness the prophet said it was groping in darkness whenever he was here in the whole world groping in Insanity what would he say now if he said that in 1965 what about 2024 but we have a hiding place it ain't this building it ain't under me it's Christ Jesus let's bow our heads if you would hallelujah oh Hallelujah and me say brother Donnie I want to be there oh more than anything in this world would you just raise your hand to God you know if you had a lump in your body or a mass or something another going on or maybe you couldn't feel anything or knew that something was visible protruding through your clothes and maybe the doctor say well we might need to do a scan and we might an MRI CT an x-ray or pet scan it might help them to see if there's something going on well may we as the children of God tonight not go through a CAT scan or a pet scan or an MRI but through the Great Divine Eyes Of Love Of Our Father may he look our way tonight just see if there's anything in our way that hinders us oh hallelujah praise the Lord maybe it's something that you need to make right with a brother or a sister or maybe it's just something between you and the Lord something you don't understand and it started out very small but it's built a little bit of resentment toward the will of God maybe it's toward your pastor or toward a minister friend we don't want anything in our way oh no we're too close now we want to be ready every day every hour I wonder how many with me tonight would raise our hands and say Lord remember me I'll raise my hands Jesus if there's anything Lord about my life that displeases you show me Father I've had different scans in my life Lord and they found this and found that they scanned me a few years ago and found a nodule on my lung and I asked the church to pray for me asked some preachers to pray for me and they scann me again sometime after that and it was gone so I believe prayer moved it because it was nothing they done so Lord if that can happen medically then what about in our soul our walk with God lord just may we pass under that word scan tonight see if you see anything about us are we too Vain about life are we are we proud are we arrogant anything Lord I'm not trying to put words in your mouths I'm just simply saying anything that you see search US Lord every preacher in the building the deacons the trustees the singers musicians the brothers up in the booths Lord that give their sacrifice their service time to keep the internet up and going and recording and all of that Lord I pray You' help them it's not enough just to come and be in the building may they might not be disconnected Lord but may the spirit of God I pray deal with them as well oh Jesus scan us tonight father may we pass your scan maybe come out on the other side and if there's nothing there we'll thank God for it if there is something there then we'll say praise the Lord for that too cuz you let us see it so we could fix it and make it right we love you Lord Jesus we want to please you dear God we know as long as we're in these animal bodies it'll be a contest but Lord we believe if we bring this body subject to your word by the control tower in the soul we're doing it a great favor because one day this subjection will lead it into the translation Hallelujah we worship you tonight father We Praise You Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord well I'll tell you what children we're gathered here tonight not dimensionally yet but we're gathered here in this building so let us take advantage of this time let's just worship him just a little bit and sing a little bit to him before we go if you need to go of course you can but let us just spend a little time together in his presence I love to spend time by myself with the Lord and I do that but I have to say there's something very special about being with other children of God too it's why special meetings we call them special meetings because they are special of course so there's something about us being together with our brothers and sisters in the house of God so let's take advantage of this opportunity here tonight sing something for us Harry let's just worship a little bit now before we go the Lord Jesus might want to heal somebody here tonight he might want to fill
