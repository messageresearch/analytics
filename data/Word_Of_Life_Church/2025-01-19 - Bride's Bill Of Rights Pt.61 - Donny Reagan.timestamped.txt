[0:08] bear got one of his sheep and he killed
[0:11] that bear and a lion running and got one
[0:14] and he caught that bear line by the
[0:16] beard and Tuck a knife and kill that
[0:18] lion see it was
[0:21] sacrificing for his
[0:24] sheep and if he was willing to lay down
[0:26] his life for the Sheep he was a type of
[0:30] the Good
[0:31] Shepherd there's something that God
[0:33] always liked in people un sheep did you
[0:36] ever notice you're the sheep of the
[0:38] pasture sheep of one fold other sheep
[0:41] have I and so forth likening people unto
[0:44] sheep you know why he liken us to sheep
[0:48] did you ever did you ever fool with
[0:50] sheep any they are certainly educational
[0:54] and a Divine education to to learn of
[0:57] sheep I've rais Ed them and shephered
[1:01] them around and a little fellas but when
[1:03] a sheep is lost he's absolutely
[1:08] helpless I picked up sheep not standing
[1:11] maybe 300 yard from the Sheep F and
[1:16] where all the other sheep was and that
[1:17] sheep when he's lost he can't help
[1:20] himself he just stands there and blat
[1:22] and blat until the wolf gets him or
[1:24] something takes place he he just can't
[1:27] find his way back he's totally helpless
[1:30] without a
[1:31] Shepherd you know he said to Peter love
[1:34] me Peter more than these yeah feed my
[1:36] sheep now I never said drive my
[1:39] sheep he never said kick my sheep he
[1:43] said feed my sheep that's what the Sheep
[1:45] needs is some sheep food don't you think
[1:47] so you know the best sheep food I know
[1:50] of for you sick sheep and all kind of
[1:52] sheep here it is that's right in this
[1:55] great big bread basket of God man shall
[1:58] not live by bread alone but by every
[2:00] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[2:03] God that's what the Holy Spirit lives on
[2:06] that's in you lives on the word of
[2:11] God that connection of Shepherd and
[2:15] sheep uh one time when I was over in the
[2:19] orance I learned a great lesson about I
[2:21] seen in St John I believe the 10th
[2:23] chapter where he said I am the the gate
[2:27] to the Sheepfold or the door to the
[2:29] Sheep
[2:30] I often wonder how could he being a man
[2:33] be a
[2:34] door but then when I was over there I
[2:37] learned what it meant the Shepherds
[2:39] Drive their sheep in to the Sheep F and
[2:42] they got a a arch that they go in at and
[2:45] when he drives them all in there then
[2:47] after they're all in it he counts them
[2:49] and if he's one lacking he'll go out and
[2:51] get it he has to bring it in every sheep
[2:55] has to be accounted for every hour of
[2:59] the day
[3:00] how OD a Shepherd he
[3:03] is and then after he gets them all
[3:05] numbered and they're all bted down the
[3:08] shepherd goes down but this hole where
[3:11] the Sheep coming at and lays himself
[3:13] down across the
[3:15] hole then no wolf can come in no Thief
[3:20] can come in no harm can come in Les it
[3:24] comes over the shepherd first what a
[3:27] picture of Christ laying himself down
[3:30] for us that nothing can harm us unless
[3:35] it comes over
[3:36] him so if you're sick you say brother
[3:39] brandom sickness crossed over him but it
[3:41] was for the glory of God that's right he
[3:45] wants to maybe give you a
[3:47] testimony as a fellow said one time he
[3:50] seen a shepherd with its uh packing a
[3:53] sheep and he said the had his leg all
[3:56] bandaged up he said well what did you um
[3:59] what's the matter did it fall off a
[4:00] cliff said no said I broke it leg oh he
[4:03] said you must be a cruel Shepherd to
[4:06] break your own sheep's leg said no the
[4:08] Sheep wouldn't mind me so I had to break
[4:11] her leg in order to hold her pet her and
[4:16] love her and give her a little special
[4:19] food so that she would love me and
[4:21] follow me and so sometime God has to do
[4:24] that to us let the doctor say oh it's
[4:28] all over nothing give be done and then
[4:31] God takes you up his arm and Pats you a
[4:33] little bit say child of M don't you know
[4:36] I love you don't you know I'm the Lord
[4:38] that even all
[4:40] I but Lord I was taught that the days of
[4:44] I know you was but I just had to let
[4:46] this happen so I could just show you a
[4:48] little special favor now don't you love
[4:50] me just a little more now I'm going to
[4:52] let you get well did you ever had that
[4:53] just come to you I have many times had
[4:57] something happened just to check me down
[4:59] a little to let him Express his
[5:02] love now another thing you notice about
[5:06] sheep and the shepherd you know it's a
[5:11] disgrace for the shepherd to lose one
[5:14] sheep did you know that it's a reproach
[5:17] on the
[5:18] shepherd now I whole quiet
[5:23] now
[5:25] hallelujah oh yes sir if the shepherd l
[5:29] loses one sheep it is a disgrace on him
[5:35] all the father has given me will come
[5:39] and none's lost all that comes to
[5:43] me all right the shepherd can't afford
[5:47] to lose a sheep that's the reason you
[5:50] backslider tonight is hanging around
[5:52] your heart trying to draw you back to
[5:55] the fold because he once kissed you and
[5:59] and you kissed him and told him that you
[6:02] loved him and raised your hands and
[6:04] praised him and you backslid and went
[6:06] out there and got all butchered up and
[6:08] wounded up in your spirit but he still
[6:10] holds around you all the time come on
[6:12] back wandering sheep I just can't afford
[6:15] to let you be lost maybe the little
[6:18] sheep that he had to go way out on the
[6:19] mountain to find all through the place
[6:22] maybe you're that sheep tonight laying
[6:23] out there wounded or somewhere but the
[6:25] shepherd can't afford to lose one sheep
[6:29] oh to follow the footsteps of the
[6:33] shepherd that's
[6:35] it don't be tempted tossed about worried
[6:39] Ted here down here today you got the
[6:42] Victory and tomorrow you're out of the
[6:43] victory follow the shepherd he's a
[6:47] leading so my sheep know my voice he
[6:50] said and the stranger said they get
[6:52] accustomed to hearing I said well if
[6:55] another Shepherd would come in and give
[6:57] that little holy lady call and he gives
[7:00] there would them sheep if they were out
[7:02] in the field come said oh
[7:11] no one more
[7:14] time
[7:18] one know those sheep know the very sound
[7:23] that every tone of that Shepherd's
[7:27] voice I thought well this is a land of

[29:23] sin so why do we worry
[29:28] when it all falls
[29:30] apart when the stormy tides of Life come
[29:35] crushing
[29:37] [Music]
[29:38] in but we have just one purpose that's
[29:43] to trust with all our heart let us stand
[29:48] back and wonder as we watch the waterers
[29:56] part you do do what's
[30:00] possible you do the
[30:03] praise I'll do the
[30:07] miracle I'll make the
[30:11] way you put your trust in
[30:15] me you keep the
[30:18] faith then when you can't go
[30:25] on that's when I'll do the
[30:30] [Music]
[30:33] Mira you do what's
[30:37] possible you do the
[30:41] praise I'll do the
[30:45] Mires I'll make the
[30:48] way you put your trust in
[30:52] me you keep the
[30:55] faith then when when you can't go
[31:03] on then when you can't go

[31:09] on that's when I'll do the Mir
[31:19] [Music]
[31:55] [Music]
[32:11] do you love
[32:13] him aren't you glad he loves you I was
[32:17] telling him in this week in
[32:19] prayer just thanking him for how much he
[32:22] loved me
[32:23] and how much he loved me when I was
[32:26] unlovable
[32:28] and how much he loved me when I was
[32:30] unlovable in the
[32:31] last two or three
[32:35] days but the proof of his love is
[32:37] election I rest my soul on
[32:40] that and if he
[32:44] knows when a
[32:47] robin
[32:49] Falls from his
[32:52] nest and he
[32:55] Grieves when he sees
[32:59] it
[33:00] [Music]
[33:03] died if he
[33:06] kisses the
[33:09] rose with a
[33:12] Morning
[33:14] Mist I
[33:16] wonder how much
[33:19] more does he love you and
[33:24] I and if he cares
[33:28] for a
[33:29] lily in an
[33:32] open
[33:35] fa and
[33:38] caresses each
[33:41] pedal with
[33:45] do if he
[33:49] acknowledges the
[33:51] tree when the
[33:54] winds make it kn
[33:58] how much
[34:00] more does he love
[34:03] me and
[34:06] [Music]
[34:08] you if he take
[34:11] out the
[34:13] time to turn a
[34:16] desert from its
[34:19] dve and carve out a mighty
[34:24] River to the Sea
[34:30] just to give a little
[34:35] brim another
[34:37] place to
[34:40] swim I
[34:42] wonder how much
[34:45] more does he really love
[34:48] [Music]
[34:50] me and if he's
[34:53] made
[34:56] away for all
[34:59] all that has been I've been
[35:03] told and
[35:07] be it's
[35:09] [Music]
[35:11] true then he's
[35:15] preparing me a
[35:18] place I
[35:20] cannot
[35:23] comprehend that's how
[35:26] much he
[35:28] really loves
[35:35] me
[35:37] how much
[35:40] more than
[35:43] arra
[35:45] rose that
[35:47] he gives
[35:50] life in the
[35:56] spring tell
[35:58] he loved me less than the
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] burn in his nest that never
[36:09] SES yet he
[36:11] SES on the
[36:16] Wind if he can
[36:19] speak a simple
[36:22] word and common
[36:26] angry wind
[36:28] peace be still and he can
[36:33] come rolling
[36:38] see then he can
[36:41] speak peace be
[36:44] still to the
[36:47] storms
[36:50] within th how
[36:53] much he
[36:55] really loves
[36:59] me
[37:01] he can
[37:04] speak peace be still to every
[37:10] storm
[37:13] within that's how
[37:15] [Applause]
[37:16] much my god
[37:19] really
[37:21] loves me
[37:30] [Music]
[37:37] [Applause]
[37:42] praise the
[37:46] Lord the love of
[37:49] God if
[37:52] every man was a scribe
[37:55] betray and every stalk
[37:57] of grass was a
[38:00] quill the oceans were full of ink and
[38:04] every one of us started writing from the
[38:07] day we were born until the day we
[38:09] died and we wrote how great how
[38:12] wonderful that he was would never be
[38:15] able to touch it with
[38:17] me and when we talk about love we're not
[38:20] just talking about got a new car new
[38:23] house all my bills are paid I got this I
[38:26] got that
[38:28] if we had none of that
[38:30] stuff it's the love that he's given to
[38:33] us as Harry said his proof of Love is
[38:38] election that's right that we were
[38:40] chosen in him I'm glad for that aren't

[40:25] help him that he can be the right kind
[40:26] of Dad

[40:30] influence upon his little son I pray for
[40:33] my sister which are Prophet is declared
[40:36] to be the Fifth Gospel may you help her
[40:40] Lord there's nothing quite like a
[40:42] mother's love if it's a true love Lord

[40:50] evils of the days sicknesses diseases we

[40:58] of the Lord Jesus

[41:25] today that is his happy as I am that we
[41:29] got to have
[41:38] church I love going to church I tell you
[41:41] when I saw that weather report and what
[41:44] they was given and I thought oh no oh
[41:47] Jesus please but I I still believe
[41:50] myself that the Lord can move those
[41:52] things up and move them down you know I
[41:55] know the devil is the Prince of the
[41:57] power of the air but my God is
[42:01] King over the
[42:03] prince so the Deacon Brothers will keep
[42:06] an eye on the weather outside so if we
[42:08] need to cut it short I will but we're
[42:11] just so grateful to be able to come
[42:13] today second Peter chap 1
[42:18] ver4 we're going to
[42:21] um look today on the right to be in
[42:24] divine order and you're talking about
[42:27] the love of God when weever we read what
[42:30] God has allowed us to be partakers of
[42:33] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[42:35] great and precious promises 2 Peter
[42:40] 1:4 that by
[42:42] these
[42:44] ye might be
[42:46] partakers of the divine
[42:49] nature the
[42:52] divine
[42:54] nature having escaped the correct
[42:57] ion that is in the world through
[43:02] lust so apparently Peter did not believe
[43:06] that they ate an apple in the Garden of
[43:11] Eden according to the way he looked at
[43:13] it you have escaped the corruption that
[43:16] is in the world through
[43:19] lust and beside this giving all
[43:22] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[43:27] to Virtue
[43:29] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[43:31] and to
[43:32] Temperance
[43:34] patience and to patience
[43:37] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[43:42] kindness and to brotherly
[43:44] kindness charity I may like to be
[43:47] remembered today as we pray I know we've
[43:49] for got so got a lot of fighting
[43:52] sicknesses flu this and that and the
[43:53] other so we want to be mindful of them
[43:55] today too just bow our heads
[43:58] together Lord Jesus it's such a great
[44:00] honor for us to be able to be together
[44:02] with your children that within itself is
[44:06] wonderful we miss each other when we
[44:08] can't get together I just think about it
[44:11] sitting back in the office a while ago I
[44:13] just wish I could pull them all up in my
[44:15] arms and just give them a big old hug
[44:18] and just let them know how much I love
[44:21] them and if I feel that way as a
[44:23] Shepherd a pastor how much more do you
[44:26] feel as our
[44:28] father you expressed how much you loved
[44:31] us by what you did to be able to bring
[44:33] us to this place today now father we're
[44:36] praying that you would help us as we
[44:38] Endeavor to open the Word of Life May
[44:41] the presence of God help us help me
[44:43] Jesus to speak only that which would
[44:46] please you Lord my motives my objectives
[44:49] Lord may they be pure help me father I
[44:53] ask for those that are sick and
[44:54] Afflicted Lord God that you'd be mindful
[44:57] full of them today some fighting the
[44:59] battle for their life but you're our God
[45:01] and you're a miracle worker we're beli
[45:03] in we commit the service in the word to
[45:06] you today in the name of Jesus and the
[45:09] saints of God said amen amen God bless
[45:12] you you may be
[45:15] seated let me read this to you again in
[45:18] in uh verse four whereby are given unto
[45:21] us exceeding great and precious promises
[45:25] that ye might be partakers of the divine
[45:31] nature the
[45:33] divine
[45:35] nature to be partakers of Grace it's
[45:38] wonderful isn't it that God would give
[45:41] you Grace unmerited favor something that
[45:44] you're not worthy of something you can
[45:45] never buy that's awesome to be a
[45:49] partaker of God's mercy that you do
[45:52] something wrong or many things wrong and
[45:54] instead of God giving you judgment and
[45:57] Justice God gives you mercy and says I
[46:01] pardon you of that to be a partaker of
[46:03] Divine Healing that you've got something
[46:06] in your body that going to take your
[46:08] life or it's going to change your life
[46:10] alter your life uh people pray for you
[46:13] you pray for yourself and the spirit of
[46:15] God moves for you and gives you a Divine
[46:18] Healing a miracle you partake of a
[46:21] miracle where something moves into your
[46:24] body a foreign evil spirit and begins to
[46:28] attack your cells or your membranes or
[46:30] your bones or whatever it is and through
[46:33] prayer the spirit of God moves and
[46:36] miraculously that force of evil leaves
[46:39] your body and it starts mending and
[46:41] going back to a well state but yet all
[46:45] of those things that I listed partakers
[46:48] of Grace partakers of mercy partakers of
[46:51] healing and of Miracles many people will
[46:54] partake of every one of those things and
[46:58] never partake of the divine
[47:01] nature now there's many many thousands
[47:04] probably be millions of people that have
[47:06] been healed by Divine Healing that will
[47:09] be
[47:10] lost there are people that have
[47:13] experienced the miraculous power of God
[47:16] that God has healed them absolutely make
[47:18] the doctors testify that they received a
[47:22] miracle from God and yet after they
[47:25] receive that Miracle they turn away from
[47:26] him him and go right back to the world
[47:29] Jesus healed many people that received
[47:32] Miracles Divine healings that was so
[47:36] profound that they were unexplainable
[47:38] but when it come right down to it where
[47:40] were all of those people that we read
[47:42] about in the four gospels when Jesus was
[47:46] crucified where were they
[47:48] then you understand what I'm saying so
[47:51] when we look about those things and we
[47:54] thank God for every one of those things
[47:56] I've experienced healings Miracles grace
[47:59] mercy I've experienced all that myself
[48:01] and I'm grateful for it but I am more
[48:04] grateful to be a partaker today of his
[48:08] divine nature that I ever have been one
[48:11] healing in my body because as I'm
[48:15] getting older I realize that I won't be
[48:17] able to fight things off the way I did
[48:19] when I was a younger man there will be
[48:22] things that will attack my body and
[48:24] things will start wearing out and things
[48:26] will have to be replaced or took out and
[48:29] then you try your best to live without
[48:31] them but if I am a partaker today of his
[48:34] divine nature I will never be the same
[48:38] again and neither will you now Peter is
[48:41] addressing this to those that are
[48:43] partakers of divine nature now we know
[48:46] that everybody is not of course but for
[48:49] those of us who are we ought to thank
[48:51] God for it it's more than going to
[48:53] church it's more than being a member of
[48:55] a church it's more than of feeding the
[48:57] the poor helping by the Widow some Cal
[49:00] and the cold winter time and all that's
[49:02] good works but yet what we believe that
[49:05] God did and his great expression of love
[49:08] was to make his own nature available to
[49:12] those of us who were born in such a vile
[49:16] state that it seemed as if though we
[49:18] were helpless and hopeless and yet God
[49:22] made a way that not only would we get
[49:25] Grace which is something that we're not
[49:27] worthy of and give Mercy something that
[49:30] he did not owe to us but after he did
[49:34] that part then he would give us a part
[49:38] of his own nature now as I was a little
[49:41] fell I couldn't really see that much
[49:44] about me that was like my daddy I
[49:47] couldn't see that much about me that was
[49:49] like my mama or aunts and uncles or
[49:53] cousins or things like that but as I
[49:55] started getting older
[49:57] then I begin to watch certain mannerisms
[49:59] that I would have and I watch you all I
[50:02] see some of the things that you do you
[50:05] don't even realize it because it's like
[50:07] it's in your DNA and there's certain
[50:09] ways that you'll you know do your hands
[50:11] a certain way or a certain way you'll
[50:13] wipe your mouth and you'll turn your
[50:15] finger like that I'll watch you and see
[50:17] how you do it and then I'll watch your
[50:19] daddy and watch him he does exactly the
[50:22] same thing that you do because there was
[50:24] something that was in you and you pick
[50:27] it up so it's not just the shape of your
[50:28] ears or your eyes or your nose but it's
[50:31] something that you inherited then there
[50:33] be other things that'll be like your
[50:35] mother other things that'll be like your
[50:37] grandfather my grandfather on my
[50:40] mother's side he was he was blind and I
[50:43] used to go up to their house and and
[50:46] stay with them and my grandmother wanted
[50:48] me to come up a lot my grandmother my
[50:50] really was a a Godly woman for what she
[50:53] knew and she gave me my first Bible
[50:55] whenever I got saved and said I hope I'm
[50:57] alive to hear you preach your first
[50:59] sermon out of it so I told her I said I
[51:02] I don't want to be no preacher I don't
[51:03] want nothing be no preacher she said yes
[51:06] you will so the Lord show her I'm not
[51:08] really sure or if that was a
[51:09] grandmother's wish but every time I look
[51:12] down at my hand like this it reminds me
[51:16] of my grandfather's hand my bone
[51:18] structure the way my thumb is the way my
[51:21] wrist turns around I remember seeing his
[51:24] hand and I would take his hand hand and
[51:27] it just kind of hold it and he was
[51:28] wrinkled you know and all of that but
[51:31] every time I do my hand like this I see
[51:34] my grandfather's hand so I am a partaker
[51:38] of the bone structure of my grandfather
[51:41] I've got a picture of my mother and
[51:43] father down in the basement where I
[51:45] listen to tapes and things down there
[51:48] and whenever I get ready to go upstairs
[51:50] I've got this picture sitting right up
[51:52] on a cabinet so I look at it every day
[51:55] sometimes multiple times during the day
[51:57] whenever I'm going there and I look at
[51:59] my mother and I look at my father and I
[52:02] can see as I get older that I'm taking
[52:04] on more of the image of my father you
[52:08] know when I read the word I want to be
[52:10] able to do the same thing don't you so
[52:13] some of you can probably look at images
[52:17] of of your father or your mother or
[52:19] maybe you've got an uncle maybe you've
[52:21] got a cousin whatever it is and you see
[52:25] things about yourself
[52:27] and others say you know what your daddy
[52:29] will never be dead as long as you're
[52:32] alive and you say wow wow that's that's
[52:34] really something well and there's
[52:36] nothing wrong with that but whenever you
[52:38] think of what God wanted to do for us
[52:41] and it's to me my way of looking at it's
[52:44] just my opinion of course which ain't
[52:45] worth very much but my way of looking at
[52:48] it God is able to do a greater work by
[52:52] changing our nature than he is by
[52:55] miraculously healing our body because a
[52:59] miracle can come by our body and just
[53:02] like that that thing is gone now if it's
[53:04] a tumor of course the demon will go out
[53:06] and then that mass will start putrifying
[53:09] and your body will start purifying it
[53:11] and it may make you sick but in a few
[53:13] days or a week or so whatever it is and
[53:15] that thing will be gone but when we're
[53:17] talking about what Peter mentioned here
[53:20] about adding to our faith virtue and
[53:22] knowledge and Temperance and all those
[53:24] wonderful things we know that is not a
[53:27] miracle but that is a process of the
[53:31] divine nature which God birthed in Us by
[53:34] the spoken word and then that starts
[53:37] growing and developing into the stature
[53:41] of a perfect man now that to me is the
[53:44] greatest miracle that we will ever have
[53:47] because a Divine Healing you know you
[53:50] may get healed today and 6 months from
[53:52] now you may die from the same thing and
[53:55] people say well they wasn't healed oh
[53:57] yes they could have been healed by the
[53:59] very saying and it come right back on
[54:01] them again but if you can ever walk into
[54:05] this place of a divine nature you will
[54:08] never as long as you ever live you'll
[54:10] never be a sinner again because that old
[54:14] man is dead am praise the Lord everybody
[54:19] so to be to be a partaker of the divine
[54:23] nature watch this in the unity of the
[54:25] one God in the Church the prophet said
[54:27] God sits on the throne of your heart in
[54:30] his control room controlling your
[54:33] emotions controlling your powers
[54:37] controlling your
[54:40] conceptions and making you one with him
[54:43] in fellowship and in love now listen
[54:45] what God wants to do God wants to
[54:48] control our emotions now that don't mean
[54:51] that he wants to control them and we
[54:53] never move or we never have any but he
[54:56] wants to control them in a way that are
[54:59] pleasing to him so it's okay for you to
[55:01] say Amen today it's okay for you to
[55:03] raise your hands and Worship the Lord so
[55:06] we want to control them let him control
[55:09] them in the way that brings him glory
[55:11] and God fills you with love he fills you
[55:14] with power he fills you with the spirit
[55:17] he fills you with his own divine nature
[55:21] and changes your carnal nature into his
[55:26] nature then in this you become a new
[55:30] creation in Christ Jesus now a man can
[55:34] come to the Lord and he's allw say he's
[55:36] a drunk a liar a hormonger whatever he
[55:39] might be and God miraculously begins to
[55:42] deal with him in the New Birth now it
[55:43] comes to the first stage of
[55:45] justification he's still hanging on to
[55:47] habits in his life it may take a month
[55:49] it may take six months or a year
[55:51] depending on how fast the man will grow
[55:54] he begins to let go of them things in
[55:56] life so he's coming into sanctification
[55:58] he lays aside smoking he lays aside
[56:00] habits he lays aside language that he
[56:03] used he lays aside books that he read
[56:06] that he should have never read so he's
[56:08] becoming washed and Sanctified then he
[56:10] goes on and he receives the true baptism
[56:13] of the Holy Ghost not a spirit immersed
[56:16] into the spirit of God but a soul
[56:19] regenerated by the Holy Ghost then once
[56:22] he comes out of that he starts being a
[56:25] partaker of divine nature then God
[56:28] starts the process of him coming into
[56:31] the full stature of a son or a daughter
[56:34] of God which will not be a miracle now
[56:38] remember the miracle is the new birth
[56:42] itself but the stature of a perfect man
[56:45] or woman is not going to come in Miracle
[56:48] form by that I mean it will not be a f
[56:51] minute transition and all of a sudden
[56:54] you'll be fully born oh you'll be full
[56:57] grown man a full grown woman you'll have
[57:00] all the faith virtue knowledge
[57:02] Temperance godliness brotherly kindness
[57:04] that you need in five minutes time and
[57:07] you'll be totally finished no it that's
[57:09] not the way that God planned it God
[57:12] planned it so that we would grow as an
[57:15] individual and we would grow together as
[57:18] a body and we would also grow together
[57:21] as a church age now you see whenever we
[57:24] think only of about ourself we are
[57:27] thinking so selfishly the things that
[57:31] you do today in this service can affect
[57:33] people around you it can affect your
[57:36] children do you parents understand that
[57:38] you are sending a message to your
[57:40] children when you come to church how
[57:42] they are to behave in church so if you
[57:44] sit there constantly looking at your
[57:46] watch sit there constantly checking your
[57:49] your phone to see if you got any new
[57:51] text or any new WhatsApp or any new
[57:54] Instagram posts and your children
[57:56] sitting there watching you you are
[57:58] teaching them that your phone and your
[58:00] your Droid or your iPhone is actually
[58:03] more important than going to church amen
[58:06] that's right we are teaching them now a
[58:09] man becomes converted and God Saves him
[58:11] we'll say God calls a man to be a
[58:13] preacher and the man God gives him a
[58:15] gift of faith and he starts praying for
[58:17] people everywhere people getting healed
[58:19] miracles signs wonders things happening
[58:22] and people think wow what a phenomenal
[58:25] guy what a great man that is well now
[58:27] watch depending on how his own stature
[58:31] is growing the greatest Miracle may not
[58:34] necessarily be the the blind that will
[58:37] see the lame that will walk but it will
[58:39] be him still maintaining that low esteem
[58:44] of himself in his own mind well come on
[58:48] now but if we're not careful we'll
[58:50] Overlook that man and we'll watch how
[58:53] that each Miracle begins to Puff him up
[58:56] a little bit more and a little more and
[58:58] he will look at himself as being a
[59:01] little bit more gifted than his brothers
[59:03] are and then the next thing that
[59:06] humility begins to go and before you
[59:08] know it he's taking 15 20 30 40 minutes
[59:13] out of the service to be able to tell he
[59:15] prayed for this one and he done that and
[59:17] he done that and he done that I took her
[59:20] the other day the Lord just dropped it
[59:22] in my heart and never even thought about
[59:24] it before but I told her I said you know
[59:26] the Lord Jesus if he would have so
[59:29] desired when he was here on the earth he
[59:33] could have told us so much about what he
[59:37] did in word form now he could have told
[59:41] us in every sermon that he preached I
[59:44] created the heavens and the Earth and I
[59:47] did this and I did that and I did this
[59:51] and I did that and I I created the Earth
[59:53] and I'm the one who put the granite and
[59:56] the core of the earth and I you imagine
[59:58] you imagine all that he could have told
[1:00:01] us and every sermon could have been how
[1:00:04] great he was and how wonderful that he
[1:00:07] was is that right he is is he not so you
[1:00:10] wonder why he didn't take all that time
[1:00:13] to tell us all the great things that he
[1:00:16] did when he he created the heavens and
[1:00:18] the Earth he could have told us exactly
[1:00:21] the number of angels that he made he
[1:00:23] could have told us exactly the number of
[1:00:25] angels that fail he could have told us
[1:00:28] all the hidden things that science still
[1:00:31] does not know about our universe and
[1:00:33] every sermon that the disciples and the
[1:00:36] people around him would have been
[1:00:38] mesmerized because he would have been
[1:00:40] saying truths nothing but the truth and
[1:00:43] told them how great he was and how
[1:00:46] wonderful he was but can you think of
[1:00:48] any passage in the New Testament where
[1:00:51] Jesus ever even mentioned from one place
[1:00:55] to another now I was over at capernium
[1:00:57] and I done this and this and this I was
[1:01:00] over at badia and I did that and that
[1:01:02] and that I was at best pegy and I've
[1:01:05] done this and this and this if it had
[1:01:07] not been for the four gospels being
[1:01:10] written afterwards we would have not
[1:01:13] known one miracle that he did why
[1:01:16] because that was not what he was there
[1:01:18] for he was there oh the great creation
[1:01:21] of the heavens and the Earth it was
[1:01:23] awesome but the message for the hour
[1:01:26] when the Lord Jesus was here was not
[1:01:29] just about what he had done but what he
[1:01:32] was now here doing and what he was doing
[1:01:35] was the Gospel that he was going to
[1:01:38] bring to change men I love to think
[1:01:40] about the creation of the heavens on the
[1:01:42] Earth but you know what I need help
[1:01:44] right here today with
[1:01:46] me I mean he needs help with you oh it's
[1:01:50] wonderful to think about the stars in
[1:01:51] the universe and I got to thinking about
[1:01:54] that and I thought Lord Jes Jesus you
[1:01:56] know and how is it that men will get up
[1:01:59] and take so much of their service and
[1:02:01] it's not they want everybody to know
[1:02:03] every time God tells them anything they
[1:02:05] got to get up and tell him now I'm going
[1:02:06] to share something with you this morning
[1:02:08] and uh you know that there's times that
[1:02:10] God has spoke some things to me and God
[1:02:13] has showed me things before and there's
[1:02:15] been a few times that I've got up and
[1:02:17] I've shared that with people and it's
[1:02:19] one of the most awful mistakes I've ever
[1:02:22] made because I would say I was praying
[1:02:26] the other day or the Lord told me this
[1:02:28] or told me that and as soon as it went
[1:02:31] out of my mouth I knew I had trespassed
[1:02:36] an element of intimacy that the Lord did
[1:02:40] not want me to share with
[1:02:42] anyone now you're talking about a
[1:02:45] miracle for us as the people of God that
[1:02:48] we will be able to maintain that
[1:02:51] humility of mind about oursel and not
[1:02:55] blabber everything that God does for us
[1:02:58] come on somebody oh but oh I'm giving
[1:03:01] praise to God praise to God sometimes I
[1:03:03] wonder who we're actually giving praise
[1:03:06] to cuz I really believe it this way that
[1:03:09] a true servant of God can be able to
[1:03:11] share Miracles Beyond his own Ministry
[1:03:14] and tell well the Lord is doing this in
[1:03:17] India and the Lord is doing that in Ohio
[1:03:19] and the Lord is doing this in Virginia
[1:03:21] and Louisiana you know I I just I just
[1:03:24] have to say it and be honest with you I
[1:03:26] constantly wonder about a man who's
[1:03:28] constantly talking about himself and not
[1:03:30] sharing what God is doing around the
[1:03:32] world especially since I've been hearing
[1:03:35] the prophet say it over and over and
[1:03:37] over again this week that brother when
[1:03:39] the lighter rain falls it will be around
[1:03:42] the
[1:03:43] world so our church is not the only
[1:03:47] church I just hope we're one of them the
[1:03:50] way I look at it I don't believe that
[1:03:52] brother Tim's church I don't believe
[1:03:54] that brother you know whoever the rest
[1:03:56] of our brothers are brother Samuel
[1:03:58] Browning I know how many brothers that I
[1:04:00] could mention I don't think they're the
[1:04:02] only church I think they want to just be
[1:04:04] part of the Church of what God is doing
[1:04:07] but do the Miracles actually ever stop
[1:04:11] but we place Miracles at only the
[1:04:13] healing of the body well what if God
[1:04:16] would be able to transform us from
[1:04:18] within our own nature now he does that
[1:04:21] by the Regeneration of the SE genene and
[1:04:24] the soul but the SE in the soul having
[1:04:27] been born by the Breath of God does not
[1:04:30] change every flaw and every fault about
[1:04:33] our human makeup so we still have things
[1:04:36] about us that are Gilbert things about
[1:04:40] us that are Oru things about us that are
[1:04:43] Reagan and Phillips and Ward come on
[1:04:46] somebody Swanson things that you
[1:04:49] inheritage you didn't even ask for them
[1:04:51] as a matter of fact if it' had been
[1:04:52] multiple choice most of us would have
[1:04:54] went down through there and would
[1:04:55] checked a lot of things off there ain't
[1:04:58] no way in the world I'd like to have a
[1:04:59] lot of the Reagan things I got and a lot
[1:05:01] of the sh things I got now the only only
[1:05:04] difference between me and you is I'm
[1:05:05] being honest and you're just sitting
[1:05:06] there all puffed up in yourself if you'd
[1:05:08] be honest you'd say the same thing
[1:05:10] because in reality you are your greatest
[1:05:13] enemy Now watch how the prophet again he
[1:05:16] goes on to say it's your individual or
[1:05:18] personal faith and trust in God to
[1:05:21] plunge beneath the blood and to be
[1:05:23] filled with his spirit and by becoming
[1:05:26] listen to this partakers of of not of
[1:05:29] the Divine the divine nature changing
[1:05:32] your own vile nature into a nature that
[1:05:36] loves God now watch this Focus this is
[1:05:39] the new birth now that is not a process
[1:05:42] that takes 40 years that is not a
[1:05:44] process that takes you know uh months
[1:05:47] and months and years that HS happens
[1:05:50] instantaneously but the stature that God
[1:05:53] wants his bride to grow into is not the
[1:05:56] miraculous which happens in a moment now
[1:06:00] notice he says that who believes every
[1:06:03] word that he said is the truth and
[1:06:05] accepting it as your own personal gift
[1:06:09] from God so where will our struggles be
[1:06:12] as Believers as we go on oh brother
[1:06:15] Donnie I've got the Holy Ghost but I I'm
[1:06:17] still struggling I went out and got
[1:06:19] drunk last night no I I don't want to I
[1:06:21] don't want to bust your balloon but you
[1:06:23] don't have the Holy Ghost if you went
[1:06:24] out and got drunk was not well I I
[1:06:27] committed adultery on my wife no God's
[1:06:29] Prophet said my comforter would keep me
[1:06:32] from doing that there's certain things a
[1:06:34] holy ghost filled child of God will not
[1:06:37] do if the Holy Ghost is only there for
[1:06:40] feeling what good does it do to us but
[1:06:43] it will annihilate the very desire of
[1:06:46] sin and the church said amen but will
[1:06:50] you make mistakes yes because you are a
[1:06:53] new creature in the same old Temple a
[1:06:56] new creation in this mess oh my goodness
[1:07:00] a new creation still left in this old
[1:07:03] pestil so it can age it can get sick it
[1:07:06] can get diseased and it can eventually
[1:07:09] die the body I'm talking about and yet
[1:07:11] you are a brand new work inside of you
[1:07:15] let's pick up again in second Peter
[1:07:16] chapter 1 verse 8 now after Peter
[1:07:19] mentions these things then he says for
[1:07:22] if these things be in you now notice the
[1:07:26] key if they be in you and a conjunction
[1:07:30] if they be in you that's phase one they
[1:07:34] be in you and abound now we don't just
[1:07:38] want them in us we want them to abound
[1:07:42] amen praise the Lord if they be in you
[1:07:46] and abound look at the word abound
[1:07:49] abundant make to increase to superabound
[1:07:54] of things to exist exist in abundance so
[1:07:58] when a person really gets the baptism of
[1:08:00] the Holy Ghost they get a portion of
[1:08:02] Faith a portion of virtue portion of
[1:08:04] knowledge portion of temperance
[1:08:06] brotherly kindness godliness all those
[1:08:08] things it's there in them in this we
[1:08:11] miniature form as we dedicated our our
[1:08:14] our brother and sister their little baby
[1:08:16] come up and we dedicate his potential of
[1:08:19] everything that he will ever be is in
[1:08:22] him only God knows if if time will go on
[1:08:24] for him to be a man to be able to be
[1:08:26] married every child that he would ever
[1:08:29] be able to father was in him a while ago
[1:08:32] when they brought him up here his
[1:08:34] temperament and they can already see
[1:08:36] things no doubt about him he's just like
[1:08:38] you Alex when he does that and he can
[1:08:40] say he's just like you Esther when he
[1:08:42] does that so you know and they're not
[1:08:44] teaching him no honey don't do that
[1:08:46] don't don't be like that it's something
[1:08:48] in him that's the way the new birth does
[1:08:52] us but as that child will grow so do we
[1:08:56] grow then God places this inside of our
[1:08:59] SE Gene and once it's born by the Breath
[1:09:01] of God he wants it to be able to abound
[1:09:05] and grow and keep on growing brother
[1:09:07] Donnie when will we stop we will never
[1:09:09] stop we'll continually to grow is that
[1:09:12] right now for if these things be in you
[1:09:15] phase one and abound phase two they make
[1:09:18] you that you shall neither be Barren nor
[1:09:22] unfruitful in the knowledge of Our Lord
[1:09:25] Jesus Christ now you realize that there
[1:09:27] are Christians that are Barren and
[1:09:30] unfruitful they are saved they go to
[1:09:33] church they love God but they have no
[1:09:35] fruit of a child of God there are people
[1:09:38] that sit around the message of the hour
[1:09:40] and they know the knowledge of the
[1:09:42] message and they love talking about it
[1:09:44] it really does something for them but
[1:09:46] they've never really been able to move
[1:09:48] into that to where that God's Great
[1:09:51] virtue of his nature remember what this
[1:09:53] is this is not my faith and my virtue
[1:09:57] and my knowledge or yours it's his it's
[1:10:00] his if we don't have this we're falling
[1:10:03] short of the glory of God and we are not
[1:10:05] bringing the True Glory that he wants us
[1:10:08] to have notice how verse n how Peter
[1:10:12] goes into this negative side of this and
[1:10:15] he said but he that liketh these things
[1:10:19] is
[1:10:20] blind so you mean a Christian can be
[1:10:23] blind a person that does not have this I
[1:10:27] find it amazing children how that Satan
[1:10:29] if he cannot stop us from believing God
[1:10:31] and believ in the message of the hour if
[1:10:33] he can stop us from being fruitful in
[1:10:36] this Avenue now I realize there's an
[1:10:38] element of people that think it don't
[1:10:39] matter if you've got love or don't have
[1:10:41] love there's people in the message that
[1:10:43] absolutely hate one another they have
[1:10:45] absolutely alt and their heart against
[1:10:47] one another and somehow they think
[1:10:49] they're full of the Holy Ghost and go in
[1:10:50] the Rapture I don't know where in the
[1:10:51] world you get that trash but that's
[1:10:54] exactly what it is you're not going in
[1:10:56] the Rapture if you hate one person
[1:10:58] there's only one person you can you can
[1:11:00] hate and be okay with it and that's the
[1:11:02] devil you cannot hate a human being I
[1:11:05] don't care what they've done to you it's
[1:11:07] just not allowed but he that liketh
[1:11:10] these things is blind and cannot see a
[1:11:13] far off naturally makes sense if you're
[1:11:15] blind you can't and has forgotten that
[1:11:18] he was purged from his old sins now
[1:11:22] notice what these virtues do into the
[1:11:25] the molding of a child of God it not
[1:11:27] only helps you deal with one another but
[1:11:30] it also helps you to remember where you
[1:11:34] were before God got a hold to you why
[1:11:37] because if we're not careful as we go up
[1:11:40] higher and higher and H in these things
[1:11:43] and we yield oursel to the spirit of God
[1:11:45] as I mentioned a while ago about the
[1:11:47] supernatural that we can begin to think
[1:11:49] oh my oh my you know God healed this
[1:11:51] person and God done that and boy the
[1:11:53] Lord put this under my feet my feet it's
[1:11:55] easy for us to get this self-righteous
[1:11:58] attitude and we go to looking down on
[1:12:00] people come on somebody I don't know
[1:12:02] about you the Lord didn't give me the
[1:12:04] Holy Ghost just to keep it for myself
[1:12:06] when I go out and I meet people out I
[1:12:08] met a man the other day over at the Ford
[1:12:10] dealership and I was just talking a
[1:12:12] little bit he was doing something for me
[1:12:14] on my vehicle and I just started talking
[1:12:16] you retired he said no I'm not retired I
[1:12:18] said I'm a pastor oh as soon as I said
[1:12:20] pastor it changed I've known the man
[1:12:22] just casually for years and as soon as I
[1:12:25] told him that I was a pastor it changed
[1:12:27] all of a sudden we started talking about
[1:12:30] the Lord and just brought the presence
[1:12:32] of God right around both of us where we
[1:12:34] were now there's something about you
[1:12:36] know to me I want to be able to share
[1:12:38] something if I didn't tell the man about
[1:12:41] serpent seed I didn't tell the man hey
[1:12:43] you believe God sent a prophet but maybe
[1:12:45] the man had a need when I got home later
[1:12:47] in the day he text me again thanking me
[1:12:50] how he enjoyed talking you know to me
[1:12:52] our lord Jesus is not just good inside
[1:12:55] these four walls if our Holy Ghost our
[1:12:58] message only works inside these four
[1:13:00] walls it makes you wonder if we've got
[1:13:01] the right message Jesus said you are
[1:13:05] like a city that's set on a hill so let
[1:13:08] your light so shine that men might see
[1:13:10] your good works and glorify your father
[1:13:12] which is in heaven is that right now
[1:13:16] watch this in the Statue of a perfect
[1:13:18] man the prophet said the church is now
[1:13:20] supposed to be taking the place of
[1:13:23] Christ carrying on his ministry so my
[1:13:28] Ministry is not mine I know we say well
[1:13:30] brother Donnie's Ministry brother
[1:13:32] Daryl's Ministry I understand where
[1:13:33] people are coming from when they say it
[1:13:35] but in reality if I'm a godall minister
[1:13:38] I've received a portion of Jesus
[1:13:40] ministry himself is that right so is
[1:13:42] every other God called man he that
[1:13:45] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:13:47] shall he do also yet a little while and
[1:13:49] the world seeth me no more yet you shall
[1:13:52] see me for I will be be with you even in
[1:13:54] you to the end of the world there it is
[1:13:57] carrying on his work so I'm not called
[1:13:59] to be a theologian I'm called to be a
[1:14:02] devil cter outer I'm called to be a
[1:14:04] preacher God's Prophet said the devil
[1:14:06] put sickness on the army of God or the
[1:14:09] people of God in the army of God takes
[1:14:11] it off I'm called to cast Devils out of
[1:14:13] you I'm called to lay hands on you
[1:14:16] praise the Lord I'm called to correct
[1:14:18] you because that is the ministry of
[1:14:21] Jesus Christ I'm not just called to baby
[1:14:23] you I'm not just called to preach you
[1:14:26] good things and make everybody feel good
[1:14:28] I'm actually called to break your legs
[1:14:30] every now and then that's right is that
[1:14:32] right that's what a Shepherd does but if
[1:14:34] a Shepherd does it he does it from the
[1:14:36] love of God he does it because he wants
[1:14:39] to help you and not hurt you now notice
[1:14:42] he said God dwells in the stature of a
[1:14:45] man reflecting himself into that being
[1:14:51] perfect
[1:14:53] worship you understand what why that
[1:14:55] though millions and millions of people
[1:14:57] have gathered around the Earth today and
[1:15:01] they have
[1:15:02] worshiped but I wonder how many of their
[1:15:05] worship has been received by
[1:15:09] God Jesus said in Mark how be it in vain
[1:15:12] do they worship me teaching for Doctrine
[1:15:14] the Commandments of men here is perfect
[1:15:20] worship God in the Statue of a man or
[1:15:25] woman
[1:15:27] wow so God in you Harry God in Me God in
[1:15:32] you brother Paul God and you sisters and
[1:15:36] brothers knows how to worship
[1:15:39] God now the church said well I know I
[1:15:42] know what God wants I know he wants us
[1:15:44] to Swoon in a certain way and he wants
[1:15:47] us to have lights flashing up here and
[1:15:49] fog machines now that sounds like a
[1:15:51] disco place to me not a house of God
[1:15:54] well come on Saints I'll tell you one
[1:15:56] thing you can see them sometimes on
[1:15:58] YouTube and see some of the stuff and
[1:16:00] some of the songs oh my goodness I saw
[1:16:02] video not long ago of some of the
[1:16:04] Christmas things that was going on in
[1:16:07] churches around the world I could not
[1:16:10] believe what they were doing how they
[1:16:13] were dancing how they were dressed Oh I
[1:16:16] thought what absolute complete utter
[1:16:18] nonsense and Abomination in the eyes of
[1:16:21] God come on now and yet they say though
[1:16:25] worshiping God that is not perfect
[1:16:27] worship we we've got a church that has a
[1:16:30] lot of talent in our church and I'm
[1:16:32] grateful for I'm grateful for our
[1:16:34] musicians and I'm grateful for the
[1:16:35] singers and and all of that but oh my
[1:16:38] let me say as your pastor we don't never
[1:16:40] want to just to depend upon our talent
[1:16:43] and our ability we always need the touch
[1:16:46] of the spirit of God don't we have some
[1:16:48] great singers and musicians aren't you
[1:16:49] grateful for it how I appreciate them
[1:16:51] putting forth the effort I'm glad they
[1:16:54] come over here and meet back there in
[1:16:55] the music room and they put all kinds of
[1:16:57] time into it because they want it to be
[1:17:00] as good as it can be but we never want
[1:17:03] to depend just upon our practice we
[1:17:06] never want to depend just upon our
[1:17:08] ability we always need that touch of the
[1:17:11] Holy Ghost amen now watch this so if we
[1:17:16] have the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:17:19] himself what is that Ministry supposed
[1:17:21] to do let's read if you would in
[1:17:23] Ephesians 4:11 now remember he said God
[1:17:25] dwells in the Statue of a man and
[1:17:28] reflecting himself into that being
[1:17:30] perfect worship God in us being his
[1:17:34] Tabernacle now watch this Paul comes in
[1:17:37] Ephesians 4:11 and he says he gave some
[1:17:39] Apostles some prophets some evangelists
[1:17:42] some pastors and teachers now this is as
[1:17:45] we know and we call it and term it the
[1:17:47] five-fold ministry now we know that for
[1:17:50] a lot of folks in the message they don't
[1:17:51] believe in this anymore they believe
[1:17:53] that brother brandom fulfilled it
[1:17:54] there's a an element of people around
[1:17:56] the message who believed that brother
[1:17:57] brandham was the prophet and that
[1:17:59] brother brandham fit into Ephesians 4
[1:18:03] and that he was called out of that
[1:18:05] Ephesians 4 and in one sense of the word
[1:18:07] I can agree with that another sense I
[1:18:09] cannot because if this Ephesians 4 was
[1:18:12] applicable only to the first church AIDS
[1:18:15] and the last Church AIDS then that would
[1:18:17] mean Hebrews 13:8 was not true to the
[1:18:20] other Church ages so God knew that there
[1:18:22] would be prophets that would come down
[1:18:24] to the church ages and they would stand
[1:18:27] under the inspiration of God and they
[1:18:29] would prophesy things agabus in the New
[1:18:31] Testament we don't even know if that
[1:18:33] brother was a preacher or not we have no
[1:18:35] record that the man ever preached any
[1:18:36] sermons but yet he did stand and
[1:18:39] prophesy Silas also a prophet a few
[1:18:41] others that the Bible mentions in the
[1:18:43] book of Acts but yet we believe that God
[1:18:46] is still the same today do we not you
[1:18:48] believe God still has this on the
[1:18:51] earth so he gave some Apostles some Pro
[1:18:54] phet some evangelists some pastors and
[1:18:57] teachers now notice what they're for
[1:18:59] they are not so these men can be lifted
[1:19:02] up and looked up to and people already
[1:19:05] make an idol out of them they are not
[1:19:07] sent upon the Earth so that people can
[1:19:10] have a form of idolatry but this is what
[1:19:12] they're given for for the perfecting of
[1:19:16] the Saints now this is not human
[1:19:19] sinlessness look at the meaning of the
[1:19:21] word it is complete Furnishing and
[1:19:25] equipping now you know we've had many
[1:19:27] preachers come to us here in the Years
[1:19:29] how we appreciate every man of God that
[1:19:31] stood behind this Pulpit or the other
[1:19:33] one at Happy Valley and every man's gift
[1:19:35] is different every man will bring it a
[1:19:37] little different way just like with
[1:19:38] brother Homer here Wednesday night then
[1:19:40] we enjoy that how the Lord used our
[1:19:42] brother and so appreciated him coming
[1:19:44] I've received so many comments about it
[1:19:46] and yet brother Homer is different than
[1:19:48] than any other preacher God knew that
[1:19:51] the message only needed one Homer
[1:19:53] Longoria God knew the message only
[1:19:55] needed one Donnie Reagan and some folks
[1:19:57] wish there wasn't even one God knew that
[1:19:59] we needed one Daryl Ward and and one sh
[1:20:02] Brown so God makes every one of them
[1:20:04] different and the way they study and
[1:20:07] their makeup and God will make something
[1:20:09] stick out to them and other brothers are
[1:20:11] set there there is no one man in the
[1:20:13] message no matter how great of a
[1:20:15] preacher that he is has all the
[1:20:18] understanding about election or about
[1:20:20] predestination or Grace or this or that
[1:20:23] or the other you know that's the truth
[1:20:24] right right so then God does that he
[1:20:27] diversifies his gifts so that each one
[1:20:30] will be able to contribute a little
[1:20:31] something that the other one could not
[1:20:34] this is why we need visiting ministers
[1:20:37] in our church brother timer is a great
[1:20:40] preacher one of the greatest preachers
[1:20:42] on my opinion that's probably ever been
[1:20:44] on the earth as far as a great preacher
[1:20:46] my stud's the word but brother Tim Needs
[1:20:49] visiting ministers in his church no
[1:20:51] matter how great the preacher is and how
[1:20:53] gifted that he is can you imagine
[1:20:55] brother brandham getting other ministers
[1:20:58] to come into his church brother brandham
[1:21:00] allowed brother Neville to preach and
[1:21:02] brother brandham said that he got many
[1:21:04] many sermons out of brother Neville's
[1:21:07] sermons oh my goodness so brother
[1:21:09] brandham also heard other preachers
[1:21:11] preach how can I overcome whenever he
[1:21:14] said that he heard a man mention about
[1:21:16] this somewhere and he got that note from
[1:21:19] that man brother brandom was like any
[1:21:21] other man when it come to that he did
[1:21:23] not believe even though he was the
[1:21:25] prophet messenger of the age he did not
[1:21:27] believe that he had the complete volume
[1:21:30] of the book there was only one person
[1:21:33] could say that and that was the Lord
[1:21:36] Jesus now notice so then the ministry is
[1:21:39] giving for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:21:42] which is the equipping of the Saints
[1:21:45] it's to bring the Saints to a state of
[1:21:48] completion and maturity now God knew
[1:21:51] this is going to take a long time let me
[1:21:53] tell you how long God has been working
[1:21:55] on the image of a perfect man in the
[1:21:57] church
[1:21:58] ages 2,000 years that's
[1:22:02] right hopefully it won't take us that
[1:22:05] long we'll all die before it ever
[1:22:07] happens right I think of it for 2,000
[1:22:10] years he's been working on this image of
[1:22:13] a perfect man which is in the image of
[1:22:16] Christ now he said for the perfecting of
[1:22:18] the Saints for the work
[1:22:22] work of the min Ministry for the
[1:22:27] edifying of the
[1:22:32] preacher
[1:22:34] really so you mean a gift in a
[1:22:36] preacher's life is not to edify
[1:22:41] him I wish some of our brothers could
[1:22:44] understand
[1:22:45] that for the edifying of the body of
[1:22:49] Christ look at the word edifying the act
[1:22:52] of building
[1:22:55] building up metaphorically the act of
[1:22:58] one who promotes another's
[1:23:02] growth in Christian wisdom so now these
[1:23:07] men who are this this is what a God call
[1:23:10] man is called to do it's not that he's
[1:23:14] called to stand up and and try to get
[1:23:16] you to think how great he is and oh tell
[1:23:18] of all this and that and the other that
[1:23:20] happened to him and whenever you leave
[1:23:22] the service what you left was the
[1:23:24] majority was how great he was how many
[1:23:26] times God spoke to him brother Daryl
[1:23:28] told me a few years ago he's telling
[1:23:30] about a certain preacher and he said uh
[1:23:31] now I understand why God don't talk to
[1:23:34] me anym than he does he said cuz he's
[1:23:36] constantly hung up with that guy over
[1:23:37] there he has breakfast with him lunch
[1:23:39] with him supper with him that's why God
[1:23:41] ain't got no time to talk to me to hear
[1:23:43] some of these preachers talk about it I
[1:23:44] mean they're just about the second hand
[1:23:46] and command in heaven I don't believe
[1:23:49] that hogwash I don't care who they are
[1:23:51] there is no man on the earth that has
[1:23:54] that type a place in God come on
[1:23:56] somebody but why if if that would be so
[1:23:59] it would be somewhere here in the Bible
[1:24:02] it would be in the Bible that I'm going
[1:24:03] to have one man and that one man's going
[1:24:06] to be the great guy and everybody else
[1:24:07] is going to come at him I'll tell you
[1:24:09] what that is that's the spirit of
[1:24:11] organization that's around this message
[1:24:14] now this message will never make an
[1:24:15] organization but the prophet of God
[1:24:18] never said the spirit of organization
[1:24:20] wouldn't be around us and it is it's
[1:24:23] alive and well but I'm here to do damage
[1:24:26] to it today I may not be able to kill it
[1:24:29] but when I get done today I hope it
[1:24:31] crawls out of these doors amen he may
[1:24:34] have walked in but I don't want him to
[1:24:35] walk out y'all with me
[1:24:38] today now watch what a man then a godal
[1:24:42] man now you know any man that's called
[1:24:44] of God is going to share his own
[1:24:46] testimony he's going to share things God
[1:24:48] has done and if he's a real man he'll
[1:24:50] also share his mistakes uhhuh he'll
[1:24:53] share his shortcomings if it' been left
[1:24:56] up to the message followers would we
[1:24:58] have any of the human mistakes that
[1:25:00] brother brandham told us about would
[1:25:02] they have put that on the message oh no
[1:25:04] would they put that in the tapes they
[1:25:05] wouldn't have wanted it there and it's
[1:25:07] the same with some of our message guys
[1:25:10] on some of the preaching and some of the
[1:25:12] forecasting of this is going to happen
[1:25:14] and that's going to happen and this is
[1:25:16] going to take place and that's going to
[1:25:18] take place but you go back to the sermon
[1:25:20] where they preached it and all of a
[1:25:22] sudden it's taken off the
[1:25:25] tape oh and you say oh oh wonder why cuz
[1:25:30] it missed that's why so be honest leave
[1:25:33] it on there bear your shame and your
[1:25:37] reproach well come on if we venture
[1:25:40] without Authority we are worthy of Shame
[1:25:44] not
[1:25:46] honor my my my you see A God Called man
[1:25:50] is called to edify the body so the act
[1:25:53] of one who promotes another's growth in
[1:25:56] Christian wisdom piety happiness
[1:26:01] Holiness the thing built or an edifice
[1:26:05] so an edifice of course is a great
[1:26:07] Orthodoxy term which is used to describe
[1:26:11] a great Cathedral or a great building
[1:26:14] that's what God wants out of each of us
[1:26:17] not not some great cedal with
[1:26:19] magnificent spires and I've been into
[1:26:22] some of the different places of the
[1:26:23] world and some of them and they would
[1:26:26] just take your breath I've stood in
[1:26:28] churches around the world and they are
[1:26:30] just incredible and some of them built
[1:26:33] hundreds and hundreds of years ago but
[1:26:36] all of that will become dust and Ashes
[1:26:38] but here is the cathedral God is working
[1:26:41] on right here is the building that God
[1:26:44] is working on when he can do his work
[1:26:48] among the people with his power with his
[1:26:51] Supernatural and the more God used uses
[1:26:54] them the little they get instead of the
[1:26:57] more he uses them the bigger they get in
[1:26:59] their own
[1:27:01] eyes oh my now notice this Paul said so
[1:27:05] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:27:07] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:27:11] the body of Christ till we all come in
[1:27:14] the unity of the Faith H I imagine the
[1:27:17] devil's down in hell just kind of Life
[1:27:19] at the scripture right here and they say
[1:27:22] are you kidding me do you saying there
[1:27:24] will ever be a Unity of faith on the
[1:27:28] earth I
[1:27:30] do if God cannot produce this scripture
[1:27:34] I don't care if he can fulfill every one
[1:27:37] of the rest of them in the Bible if he
[1:27:40] cannot fulfill this one I'll not serve
[1:27:43] him another day I'll walk away from this
[1:27:46] church and say I refuse to give God five
[1:27:49] more minutes of my
[1:27:52] time and you are to do the same but
[1:27:56] don't worry I plan on being back
[1:27:58] Wednesday night because if my God said
[1:28:00] it my God will do it now the problem of
[1:28:04] it is we look and think that we're all
[1:28:07] going to come together in some type of
[1:28:09] unity and Harmony of our human
[1:28:11] differences forget it that ain't what
[1:28:13] God's even talking about it's the unity
[1:28:17] of the face the unity of the Faith No
[1:28:20] Doubt Paul said things that Peter didn't
[1:28:23] understand he told us that he said they
[1:28:25] rest the scriptures he said and it's
[1:28:27] things that's hard to be understood so
[1:28:30] Paul said things that Peter didn't
[1:28:32] understand James didn't understand but
[1:28:34] they were in Unity on the facei of the
[1:28:38] Son of God we will always have our human
[1:28:42] differences come on somebody and people
[1:28:45] are looking at the message right now
[1:28:47] that we got a difference about this and
[1:28:49] a difference about that sure we do but
[1:28:52] we agree on a whole lot more than we
[1:28:54] disagree on I refuse to let the devil
[1:28:58] separate us at our church and try to get
[1:29:01] in our mind oh we're the only ones right
[1:29:04] that group up there they're the only
[1:29:05] ones right ain't none of us knows what
[1:29:07] seeds down in people's Soul just because
[1:29:10] somebody's believe in something in error
[1:29:12] today don't mean they'll believe in that
[1:29:14] in 6 months from
[1:29:16] now there may be us sitting right here
[1:29:18] today and we're holding on to something
[1:29:21] that is nothing but tradition some
[1:29:24] that's just as wrong as it can be but we
[1:29:26] don't know it yet the Lord may show us
[1:29:29] tomorrow and we'll repent of it come on
[1:29:32] now oh my to we all come in the unity of
[1:29:37] the faith and of the
[1:29:40] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:29:44] perfect not pluralized now not perfect
[1:29:48] men but a perfect man
[1:29:55] perfect
[1:29:56] tellos a full age brought to its end
[1:30:02] finished wait wanting
[1:30:06] nothing
[1:30:07] necessary to
[1:30:11] completeness and you're waiting for your
[1:30:13] Humanity to get perfect forget
[1:30:17] it your old stinking flesh will be with
[1:30:19] you 5 minutes before you're changed some
[1:30:22] of you may have to repent for a mistake
[1:30:24] you made or thought that you allowed too
[1:30:27] long to linger in your mind five minutes
[1:30:29] before the body Chang you're say Lord I
[1:30:31] Ain bre oh Lord have mercy in five
[1:30:33] minutes you're in a new body in another
[1:30:35] land why because this thing right here
[1:30:37] is going to bother you as long as you
[1:30:39] live but thank God it bothers
[1:30:42] you now notice but what will God do God
[1:30:45] will complete the perfect man which is
[1:30:49] not this it's this man in
[1:30:52] Here Wanting nothing necessary to
[1:30:55] complete this perfect that which is
[1:30:58] perfect consummate human integrity and
[1:31:02] virtue of men full grown adult of full
[1:31:07] age and
[1:31:10] mature oh my unto a perfect man unto the
[1:31:17] measure you understand God's
[1:31:22] pattern is is the
[1:31:26] measure so unto the measure that God
[1:31:30] held out you know what the measure was
[1:31:33] Jesus
[1:31:36] himself so whenever you start building
[1:31:39] something if you've got a plan and
[1:31:41] you've got a ratio and you got your CAD
[1:31:44] by which you're working on it all all
[1:31:46] that's well and good the computer do a
[1:31:47] lot of it but when it comes to a lot of
[1:31:49] it you have to kind of try it now when
[1:31:52] we got ready to design this platform and
[1:31:54] this Pulpit here we had some things in
[1:31:56] mind but there was some things that we
[1:31:58] had to alter as we went along some of
[1:32:01] the things around in the building we had
[1:32:03] to alter as we went along we didn't have
[1:32:06] you know exactly in our mind what we
[1:32:08] wanted but then then we made it so
[1:32:11] whenever brother John was going to make
[1:32:13] this pull pit he I gave him a picture
[1:32:15] that I'd found on the internet and he
[1:32:18] made up a type you know just a prototype
[1:32:21] and size and well how big do you want
[1:32:23] the batt
[1:32:24] how big do you want the columns and how
[1:32:26] many do you want so you take up and make
[1:32:28] a little image and he made just a little
[1:32:30] tiny thing and set it up here and I come
[1:32:33] over here and walked around and looked
[1:32:34] at it I looked at it here looked at it
[1:32:36] there looked at it over there because
[1:32:38] I'm thinking in my mind of proportion so
[1:32:42] do I want little tiny spindles which
[1:32:45] would work on your handrail in your home
[1:32:48] that would work fine in your home you
[1:32:49] know a little bit two by two guys two
[1:32:51] and a half by two and a half or
[1:32:52] something like that or do I I want
[1:32:54] something more beefy something a little
[1:32:57] bit bigger something a little bit wider
[1:33:00] something that the steps will be deeper
[1:33:02] and do I want a pull pit or it's about
[1:33:04] this big of a square and me said I need
[1:33:06] a lot of room I move around a lot so
[1:33:09] what do he do he done the same thing on
[1:33:11] that and you realize that God needed a
[1:33:15] prototype God hallelujah God needed a
[1:33:18] measuring tape so God emptied himself of
[1:33:23] his glory
[1:33:24] and emptied himself into humanity and
[1:33:27] become my measuring
[1:33:31] tape so you understand why I am not
[1:33:34] interested in making our church like an
[1:33:38] exact replica of other message
[1:33:43] churches no I have no desire to make our
[1:33:47] church an exact mirror of brother Tim's
[1:33:49] he has no desire to make his an exact
[1:33:52] mirror of ours I've been all over the
[1:33:55] world and I've seen how they worship and
[1:33:57] how they
[1:33:59] sing and they don't sing like
[1:34:02] us now you take the Spanish the Latino
[1:34:05] brothers and sisters I've been down in
[1:34:07] Mexico been in in South America and
[1:34:09] places like that brother Jack has been
[1:34:11] much more than I have and see how they
[1:34:13] get the rhythm of their music and how
[1:34:15] they sing totally different than us oh
[1:34:18] you go to Africa and to Kenya and to the
[1:34:21] places there oh my completely totally
[1:34:24] different God never made them the
[1:34:27] measuring tape God never made me the
[1:34:31] measuring tape by which all preachers
[1:34:34] are measured by God never made our
[1:34:37] church or any other Church the measuring
[1:34:41] tape by which all measure well I brother
[1:34:43] Donnie I visited this church and their
[1:34:45] worship is different from ours and and
[1:34:47] they're saying it why of course it is
[1:34:49] why because you all are a lot of what
[1:34:52] produces this our church has a
[1:34:55] personality that personality is made up
[1:34:58] by the people who come here and that
[1:35:00] personality will change and be redefined
[1:35:03] as certain ones come in and certain ones
[1:35:06] leave and the pastor of the church
[1:35:08] contributes a great element to that as
[1:35:10] well so I'm not interested in us being
[1:35:13] what what you want or like what somebody
[1:35:15] else want I want our church to be what
[1:35:17] pleases the Lord Jesus now to some folks
[1:35:21] we're awake too quiet we don't shout
[1:35:23] enough we don't run around and up hey
[1:35:25] I'm all for shouting as long as the
[1:35:27] shouter himself it's what's motivating
[1:35:29] us now if we have to do it by the music
[1:35:32] I don't want that because then I'm using
[1:35:34] a measuring tape of churches who have to
[1:35:37] have the music to pump them up I don't
[1:35:39] want that I've done been there and done
[1:35:40] that no I believe in Dancing Yeah buddy
[1:35:43] I want you to dance but when you get
[1:35:45] done dancing and jumping and shouting I
[1:35:47] want you to live just as high as you
[1:35:49] jump so if you jump that high live that
[1:35:51] high you jump that high live that
[1:35:55] high I hope I reason y'all don't
[1:36:05] jump but if we're not careful we'll turn
[1:36:08] this into a
[1:36:11] denomination then we judge Everybody by
[1:36:13] our church well our music is this way
[1:36:16] and our singing is this way and we only
[1:36:19] sing so many songs and right at 31 and a
[1:36:22] half minutes Brother Lou supposed to
[1:36:24] stop and we this and then you go
[1:36:26] somewhere else and they saying 40
[1:36:27] minutes or 45 I can't believe they're
[1:36:30] off the word look at this time I cannot
[1:36:32] believe it oh friends what's God doing
[1:36:34] he's still working on the image of a
[1:36:36] perfect
[1:36:37] man how many needs help
[1:36:41] today for those of you that didn't raise
[1:36:43] your hands you need help worse than one
[1:36:44] the rest of us
[1:36:46] do unto the measure of the stature so
[1:36:51] the stature refers to to the growth of a
[1:36:56] man the stature to be attained to was
[1:37:01] Christ so God had this certain man small
[1:37:06] frame we not talking about the flesh
[1:37:09] now but a stature of a perfect
[1:37:12] man a man that God could use his
[1:37:16] mouth to create the
[1:37:20] worlds and he never uttered one word of
[1:37:23] it
[1:37:24] when he was on the
[1:37:27] ears he never sat around and said hey
[1:37:30] let me tell you all what I
[1:37:33] did there was nothing there and I
[1:37:37] created everything you see plus all that
[1:37:40] you do not
[1:37:42] see and i' done this and i' done that
[1:37:45] and man i' done this I mean he could
[1:37:47] have preached the whole three and a half
[1:37:48] years he was here preaching about what
[1:37:50] he
[1:37:51] did that's right you
[1:37:55] understand I firmly believe we ought to
[1:37:57] give testimony to the things that God is
[1:37:59] doing as long as it is about
[1:38:03] god notice he was the standard so he was
[1:38:07] the increment now most of you know that
[1:38:10] the United States is the largest nation
[1:38:12] in all the world that still uses inches
[1:38:16] and feet and miles and all that most of
[1:38:19] the rest of the Civilized world uh they
[1:38:22] go with the me system so on our bottles
[1:38:26] and on different things like that
[1:38:28] they've tried to convert a slow
[1:38:31] hardheaded Americans and they will uh do
[1:38:33] the two liter so they started you know
[1:38:36] there some of those your drink two liter
[1:38:38] and you say it and you've let go of the
[1:38:40] ounces so what are they trying to do
[1:38:42] slowly convert US so and our tools SAE
[1:38:46] we go by4 in 38 716 high 58 9 16 1116
[1:38:52] 3/4 so on and so on and so on but as as
[1:38:55] they're trying to convert US and bring
[1:38:57] us over to the other system of
[1:38:59] measurement and then the mechanics and
[1:39:01] our automobiles are built by 3
[1:39:03] millimeter 5 mimet 6 7 8 1132 whatever
[1:39:06] more it is little by little trying to
[1:39:09] convert us so you see we were born lost
[1:39:14] in the system of humanity but God wants
[1:39:18] to convert us from our human system over
[1:39:23] to a system of divine
[1:39:25] nature now watch when he does this this
[1:39:28] is what ultimately he wants to bring us
[1:39:30] to so he was the standard by which God
[1:39:33] will do this now notice as Paul goes on
[1:39:36] to say in this unto the measure of the
[1:39:41] stature of the
[1:39:44] fullness of
[1:39:49] Christ I will never Attain
[1:39:54] to the
[1:39:56] fullness of the
[1:39:58] godhead in my
[1:40:01] body nor will any of
[1:40:04] you I do believe the bride will attain
[1:40:07] to the
[1:40:08] fullness of the
[1:40:11] godhead in the mystical
[1:40:15] body to where the attribute of the
[1:40:19] fullness this is separate from the
[1:40:21] restoration of gifts under Pentecost
[1:40:24] separate from the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:26] Ghost in your spirit under Pentecost the
[1:40:29] attribute of the fullness of God has
[1:40:33] only been expressed in certain times
[1:40:37] down through the dispensation of
[1:40:40] man notice what Paul was saying the same
[1:40:44] as Peter use different terms but the
[1:40:47] word fullness is which is put in to fill
[1:40:52] up that which has been
[1:40:55] filled and then he uses this analogy a
[1:40:58] ship in as much as it is filled this is
[1:41:02] the choice of the meaning of the word
[1:41:04] that Paul used so it's like a ship in as
[1:41:08] much as it is fi or man with Sailors
[1:41:12] roarers soldiers in the New Testament
[1:41:15] the body of the Believers as that which
[1:41:18] is filled with
[1:41:20] Presence Power agency see Riches of
[1:41:25] God and of
[1:41:27] Christ now you see this is one why that
[1:41:31] denominational Clan Spirit wants to hang
[1:41:35] around us as if though our church is
[1:41:38] complete within
[1:41:41] itself and then we do not need other
[1:41:44] brothers we do not need other minister
[1:41:48] and that somehow we're
[1:41:49] Superior the way I look at it if this
[1:41:52] church is superior
[1:41:54] in some things I'd like to tell you what
[1:41:55] I think they're probably Superior in
[1:41:58] stupidity
[1:42:00] sometimes lack of surrender to
[1:42:04] God allowing your flesh to lead you amen
[1:42:08] uh oh well glory to God Preacher Brother
[1:42:10] Donnie not having enough
[1:42:12] love not feeling for one another in the
[1:42:15] right way thinking about ourselves more
[1:42:18] than we think about others now I think
[1:42:20] that we're probably Superior in some of
[1:42:22] them aspects
[1:42:24] oh ain't much to brag about is
[1:42:30] it so where are we it's evident friends
[1:42:34] I'm convinced especially in the last
[1:42:36] year and a half one reason that the
[1:42:39] bride is not any farther along than she
[1:42:42] is is because the
[1:42:46] ministry is not where they need to
[1:42:51] be they're debating over the size of the
[1:42:54] church and whose Doctrine is right and
[1:42:57] getting on YouTube and make making fools
[1:43:00] of
[1:43:01] themselves as the world sees us fighting
[1:43:04] each
[1:43:06] other if I remember it right the prophet
[1:43:08] said that the Brams fought in the
[1:43:14] backyard but we fight in the front yard
[1:43:16] on the front page in
[1:43:21] YouTube cuz it's like every preacher
[1:43:23] feels like he's called to resolve all
[1:43:24] the problems in the message the sooner
[1:43:27] we realize that is an absolute lie the
[1:43:30] more peace will have Among
[1:43:32] Us well come on somebody oh I think one
[1:43:36] of the other Superior things that we
[1:43:37] probably be failing in as a church body
[1:43:39] is that we don't pray for the preachers
[1:43:41] near enough we think they don't need our
[1:43:43] prayers oh yes they do they need your
[1:43:46] prayers that God will help them to
[1:43:48] fulfill Ephesians
[1:43:51] 411 that they can realize they are
[1:43:54] called to be able to bring the body to a
[1:43:57] state of maturity a state of completion
[1:44:01] a state to where God can use them in the
[1:44:04] short span of time that they are here to
[1:44:07] be able to help them to see what their
[1:44:08] goal is our goal is not to bring
[1:44:10] everybody up to what we think is the
[1:44:13] standard of the message well our church
[1:44:15] is the perfect Church well if you think
[1:44:17] that come and talk to me I'll let you
[1:44:19] know of a few things about us that a
[1:44:21] long way from being perfect you see the
[1:44:24] figure is obvious the Apostle Compares
[1:44:28] their condition then to a state of
[1:44:31] childhood and yet we're talking about
[1:44:33] the Ephesian Church which is one of the
[1:44:36] deeper churches in the message now Paul
[1:44:38] never had to write to the Ephesian
[1:44:40] church about the gift
[1:44:43] problem now the Corinthian Church was
[1:44:46] the church that had the gift problem so
[1:44:48] I wonder if some of the Ephesian folks
[1:44:50] would have said now what you know what
[1:44:52] actually Paul never wrote to us about
[1:44:55] that if we don't have an interpreter
[1:44:57] that we shouldn't speak in tongues in
[1:44:59] the church so I wonder since that book
[1:45:02] was addressed to the Corinthian Church
[1:45:04] if that even applies to us as Ephesian
[1:45:08] Believers since it had the Corinthian
[1:45:11] people's name on the book and then maybe
[1:45:13] the Believers at thessalonica said well
[1:45:16] you know what our church is Sovereign
[1:45:18] within itself and we didn't get no
[1:45:21] letter like that so you know what maybe
[1:45:24] them particular scriptures that Paul
[1:45:25] said about tongues and interpretation
[1:45:28] and so on maybe that just applies in the
[1:45:30] Corinthian Church and doesn't apply in
[1:45:37] thessalonica is it just me or is it
[1:45:39] hotter in a firecracker in here this
[1:45:41] morning
[1:45:44] woo what do you reckon them first
[1:45:46] century Believers
[1:45:48] did that they went through the letter to
[1:45:50] the Thessalonians and pulled out what
[1:45:52] they wanted
[1:45:54] and then they pulled out of the
[1:45:55] Corinthian letter what they wanted and
[1:45:56] then they said well you know what that's
[1:45:58] really to the Corinthian Church that
[1:45:59] really ain't to us uh because we're a
[1:46:01] sovereign body here and we we choose to
[1:46:04] to leave out all that about the women
[1:46:06] preaching and stuff like that cuz as a
[1:46:08] matter of fact that was directed to to
[1:46:10] Timothy 1 Timothy 2:12 and 1 Corinthians
[1:46:13] 14:34 that actually I mean there's
[1:46:15] nowhere written in the Thessalon Ian
[1:46:16] letter than anything about women
[1:46:18] preachers is even is even mentioned so
[1:46:20] probably it's not right for them in care
[1:46:22] rinse but it's okay for us here in
[1:46:26] thessalonica
[1:46:32] oh help us
[1:46:37] Jesus let's take out our White flags of
[1:46:40] surrender spiritually now and surrender
[1:46:43] to
[1:46:44] him I Surrender
[1:46:48] Lord I Surrender so you can live through
[1:46:52] me
[1:46:55] this is the way I feel today
[1:46:57] friends I guess it's because my hair is
[1:47:00] turning gray and I'm getting more
[1:47:02] wrinkles in my face but I've been asking
[1:47:06] the last year or so when are you going
[1:47:08] to retire my dentist asked me not long
[1:47:11] ago said have you retired are you close
[1:47:13] to the age of retirement I said no
[1:47:16] ma'am well I was just wondering you know
[1:47:18] you got a tooth Ser you need to have
[1:47:19] something taken care of you need to do
[1:47:20] this somebody else asked me you're
[1:47:22] fixing a retirement I said what what is
[1:47:24] it I'm just because I'm getting old them
[1:47:25] mean I'm retiring right brother
[1:47:29] Jack but this is the way I feel in my
[1:47:31] heart I have more of a
[1:47:34] desire in my heart to bring the purity
[1:47:38] of the word of
[1:47:39] God than I've ever had in my entire
[1:47:43] life it's like I'm more
[1:47:46] aware and more
[1:47:48] fearful of the place that a preacher
[1:47:50] stands in and how can influence people
[1:47:54] you fathers you know how you feel you
[1:47:56] got a son or a daughter or two or three
[1:47:58] in your home and you think how God's
[1:48:00] going to make you daddy's
[1:48:02] answer can you imagine multiplying that
[1:48:05] by hundreds of times and then by the
[1:48:07] scope of the Outreach of our church here
[1:48:09] thousands of times around the world I
[1:48:12] will stand before God that day and
[1:48:14] answer because I have influence tens of
[1:48:18] thousands of people how can a man not do
[1:48:21] that
[1:48:22] be
[1:48:24] terrified in his
[1:48:30] flesh I want to be more like him I want
[1:48:34] to preach more like him how many of you
[1:48:38] want to be more
[1:48:42] like he says that
[1:48:44] Christ had appointed the pastors and the
[1:48:47] teachers in the infant church that the
[1:48:50] church might be brought to a state of
[1:48:54] manhood now if the Lord Jesus wanted to
[1:48:57] use tapes then we are totally convinced
[1:49:01] he could have had tape recorders in his
[1:49:03] day and then never really been any need
[1:49:06] for any other preachers anyway cuz who
[1:49:08] could have preached the word better than
[1:49:11] the Lord Jesus so then all we need to
[1:49:14] have done would went around the world
[1:49:16] and say this is a voice of the master
[1:49:18] himself so we're going to play this oh
[1:49:21] he could have done that if he so we wish
[1:49:23] but he chose to bring the gospel through
[1:49:28] men that are full of faults and
[1:49:34] frail now when you turn on your TAP
[1:49:38] player if you still use
[1:49:40] those or your phone or whatever it is
[1:49:44] that you're listening to the message
[1:49:46] on can your phone feel your
[1:49:51] pain can that recording how wonderful
[1:49:55] and blessed that it is can it feel what
[1:49:58] you're going through Brother D can you
[1:50:00] talk to the tape player can you talk to
[1:50:02] your phone and say I I need something
[1:50:05] today for now I need something pick the
[1:50:07] right sermon for me pick the right
[1:50:09] sermon and then oh I I do it all the
[1:50:12] time I listen to tapes hours on in I'll
[1:50:15] amen praise the Lord thank you Lord
[1:50:16] Jesus I keep a notepad in every vehicle
[1:50:18] that I've got so I can write down things
[1:50:21] but I know I cannot talk to the tape I
[1:50:24] cannot talk to whatever means I'm using
[1:50:28] it so God chose men with some of the
[1:50:31] same faults and
[1:50:32] flaws that you
[1:50:34] do that you
[1:50:38] have and they will preach to you and
[1:50:40] then there'll be times that the
[1:50:42] preaching of the word won't exactly take
[1:50:44] care of every aspect in your
[1:50:46] life and you'll need to come back in
[1:50:48] their office and sit down and talk with
[1:50:50] them a little bit about this this and
[1:50:52] that and the other and you'll look
[1:50:54] across that desk and look into the eyes
[1:50:56] of a man that's a human like you
[1:51:00] are a man that will cry with you many of
[1:51:04] you know you've come and talked to me
[1:51:05] about Terrible Things sins and
[1:51:08] wrongdoings and you were ashamed even
[1:51:10] tell
[1:51:12] me I ask anyone to stand right
[1:51:16] now and say if I've ever treated you
[1:51:20] like you were a piece of wood or a piece
[1:51:22] of a medal and have no feeling towards
[1:51:25] you
[1:51:27] no but that's the way a tap player
[1:51:31] does the tap player can't cry with
[1:51:34] you the tap player cannot take its hand
[1:51:36] it has no
[1:51:38] hand I've sat in my office and hear
[1:51:41] things that people had to confess that
[1:51:43] was
[1:51:45] horrible never one time if I sit there
[1:51:48] without compassion and
[1:51:49] mercy this sometimes is the easier part
[1:51:52] standing here but God wanted men that
[1:51:56] these same things are going in them
[1:51:58] brother Donnie are you complete
[1:52:02] no but this is why you can come and talk
[1:52:05] to
[1:52:06] me because you're an incomplete Saint
[1:52:10] talking to an incomplete
[1:52:13] Pastor talking to an incomplete Joel
[1:52:16] Brown and an incomplete John Horn and
[1:52:19] Daryl Warden Pete Lawson and then jonath
[1:52:22] all the else of these brothers that are
[1:52:24] here only a man who feels he's above you
[1:52:29] will have that attitude and look down
[1:52:30] his nose on
[1:52:36] you what's about it
[1:52:52] oh Hallelujah Paul goes on to say that
[1:52:55] we
[1:52:56] henceforth be no more
[1:52:59] children tossed to and
[1:53:02] fro and carried about with every wind of
[1:53:06] Doctrine one of the deepest churches in
[1:53:08] the message as we'll say the Ephesian
[1:53:12] church and yet Paul still now they've
[1:53:14] been been around for years and years now
[1:53:16] by the time this is
[1:53:17] written but they were still not at the
[1:53:20] stature of a perfect man so Paul had to
[1:53:23] address them as
[1:53:26] children as
[1:53:28] children to the Corinthian Church he
[1:53:30] said
[1:53:31] Brethren be not children in
[1:53:34] understanding how be it in
[1:53:38] Malice be ye children but in
[1:53:42] understanding be
[1:53:45] men
[1:53:47] oh may God help us to check our grow of
[1:53:51] where we are
[1:53:53] are we
[1:53:55] children in understanding or men in
[1:53:59] understanding are we children in
[1:54:02] Malice or are we
[1:54:04] men in
[1:54:06] Malice it's amazing how he patterns our
[1:54:09] growth in where we are Brethren be not
[1:54:12] children in understanding how be it in
[1:54:15] Malice be your children but in
[1:54:19] understanding be men
[1:54:23] so I want you to look at yourself today
[1:54:24] as I look at
[1:54:26] myself and think how are we in
[1:54:30] faith are we men or are we children by
[1:54:33] saying men I'm not using the word to say
[1:54:35] that we're dominating of course by males
[1:54:37] but the whole human race is gathered
[1:54:40] there under that word so it's you
[1:54:42] sisters as
[1:54:44] well so are we grown up in
[1:54:48] faith but when it comes to hatred and
[1:54:51] envy and strife and jealousy we're
[1:54:55] children cuz we can get our feelings
[1:54:57] hurt today and we'll be playing together
[1:55:00] tomorrow CU that's what children can
[1:55:03] do they can fuss and fight and carry on
[1:55:06] but boy you jump on one of them my
[1:55:10] goodness one of mine and Harry's sisters
[1:55:12] I'll tell you
[1:55:14] what she's clawed my eyes out many a
[1:55:17] time I've still got some scars on my
[1:55:20] face that she put on there
[1:55:23] but if anybody picked on me they had her
[1:55:26] to deal with and she's took care of a
[1:55:29] few of them because I just never could
[1:55:31] fight I just wasn't the fighting type I
[1:55:34] just couldn't do it but now she'd fight
[1:55:37] me herself but she would not stand to
[1:55:39] let anybody pick on
[1:55:42] me look children we're always going to
[1:55:44] have
[1:55:45] differences we're going to have
[1:55:46] difference of opinion ideologies and
[1:55:49] doctrines but you know when it comes
[1:55:51] right down to it there there only one
[1:55:52] who knows who are children and who
[1:55:56] serpent SE I know we can get so
[1:55:57] disappointed in one another and failures
[1:56:00] of people and preachers and so on and so
[1:56:02] on but to me until God tells me there is
[1:56:06] no mercy for people I'm going to reach
[1:56:09] out to him I ain't going to compromise
[1:56:10] and there's a great balance in trying to
[1:56:12] find it there's only been a few people
[1:56:15] in my life that God has spoke to me and
[1:56:18] told me that his Mercy left them
[1:56:22] and from the way that it made me feel I
[1:56:24] don't mind if he ever tells me
[1:56:27] again because I still think about him to
[1:56:29] this day and think about what a horrific
[1:56:31] thing that it
[1:56:34] is so look at yourself
[1:56:37] today how are you in
[1:56:40] Malice how are you in jealousy and envy
[1:56:43] and strife and forgiveness and so on and
[1:56:45] so on are you like a
[1:56:48] child or are you a
[1:56:50] man the older get the more we learn how
[1:56:54] to choose our words and learn how to get
[1:56:57] even and plan and connive and all
[1:57:01] that oh my
[1:57:04] goodness anybody here besides me that
[1:57:07] just raise your hand before the Lord
[1:57:08] Lord I need help
[1:57:11] today don't give up on me
[1:57:14] Jesus don't give up on me
[1:57:18] Jesus Heavenly fathers we have our heads
[1:57:21] bowed to the dust of of the
[1:57:23] earth once again I want to say thank you
[1:57:27] for letting us have church
[1:57:29] today I'm so grateful we could come
[1:57:32] together Lord and dedicate a baby and
[1:57:35] sing and pray and your prayer request
[1:57:39] and then Lord we would hear a chastising
[1:57:43] sermon I I personally need them
[1:57:46] Lord I'm still dealing with this old
[1:57:49] rotten Humanity of mine so I still still
[1:57:52] need to be corrected
[1:57:54] father I thank you for the holy ghost
[1:57:57] that corrects us when we're
[1:57:59] wrong and Malice Lord Jesus let me be a
[1:58:04] child in
[1:58:06] jealousy
[1:58:08] Envy let me be a
[1:58:11] child I didn't realize Lord when I was a
[1:58:15] child how poor we actually
[1:58:19] were I just didn't think about it it was
[1:58:22] just just the way it was one Christmas
[1:58:25] if my aunt and uncle hadn't bought me
[1:58:28] and my sister something we wouldn't have
[1:58:31] got nothing but I never really thought
[1:58:32] that much about it I was just so happy
[1:58:34] to have a little
[1:58:35] something I didn't realize how poor we
[1:58:37] were until I started getting older and
[1:58:40] going to
[1:58:41] school and then I'd look and see how
[1:58:44] people were
[1:58:45] dressed and then they would laugh at
[1:58:48] me because some of my clothes had holes
[1:58:50] in them because it wasn't the style
[1:58:54] then and then through their cruelty I
[1:58:57] begin to
[1:58:58] realize that we were very very
[1:59:02] poor so Lord I'm afraid sometimes and
[1:59:04] more we become exposed to anger and
[1:59:06] jealousy and strife and so
[1:59:10] on the more mature we become in
[1:59:13] it instead of being like children that
[1:59:16] would just go on and laugh
[1:59:19] and I'm reminded of the story of gono
[1:59:22] Lord whenever
[1:59:24] they captured them and finally the band
[1:59:28] in the
[1:59:30] cheras they kept hid from them for a
[1:59:32] long long time because they couldn't
[1:59:33] find them and they used their Indian
[1:59:37] Scouts the Apache white man couldn't
[1:59:40] find them so some of their own Brothers
[1:59:43] the Apache Scouts they LED them to their
[1:59:46] Hiding
[1:59:47] Place once they capture them all then
[1:59:50] they take the guns away from the
[1:59:53] scouts stripped them of their whatever
[1:59:56] they gave them their clothes and so on
[1:59:59] and they put them on the same trains
[2:00:02] headed to
[2:00:04] Florida and it made the Apache Indians
[2:00:07] realize the white man had used him no
[2:00:10] wonder your Prophet said the white man
[2:00:12] is the
[2:00:16] Renegade and then some of the ones that
[2:00:18] had held out faithful was on that train
[2:00:22] with these guides and they begin to
[2:00:25] speak out against them and some of them
[2:00:27] had a little bit of a tussle back and
[2:00:30] forth but Geronimo spoke up and told
[2:00:32] them there's so few of us
[2:00:36] left we need to stand
[2:00:40] together help us Lord
[2:00:44] Jesus there's so few of us
[2:00:47] left keep us I pray
[2:00:50] father may we be men in
[2:00:54] understanding may we reflect the stature
[2:00:56] of a perfect
[2:00:58] man as we see that perfect man on the
[2:01:03] cross and the stature of a perfect man
[2:01:06] said
[2:01:07] father forgive them for they know not
[2:01:12] what they
[2:01:15] do may we not be children in
[2:01:19] forgiveness may we not be children and
[2:01:22] these great attributes of
[2:01:24] God we love you
[2:01:27] Jesus Can We Stand
[2:01:32] Together praise the
[2:01:34] Lord oh
[2:01:37] my Paul goes on in Ephesians 4:15 and he
[2:01:40] says but speaking the
[2:01:43] truths in love may grow up into him in
[2:01:51] all things which is the head even Christ
[2:01:57] so you're growing as an individual but
[2:01:59] we are growing as a church family but
[2:02:02] we're not the only one we're growing
[2:02:03] with the rest of the same message move
[2:02:06] around the world you see the people in
[2:02:08] Africa cannot go before we doing the
[2:02:11] Rapture even though they might be ahead
[2:02:13] of us the people in India they might be
[2:02:15] ahead of us there may be people in
[2:02:17] Europe they're ahead of us but once this
[2:02:20] Rapture is called
[2:02:22] everyone who goes in the Rapture will
[2:02:24] have have to be able to reach that
[2:02:26] stature of a perfect man and
[2:02:29] remember God is the one with the
[2:02:31] measuring tape so the best thing you and
[2:02:34] I can do is take our measuring tape and
[2:02:37] put it back in the hands of God because
[2:02:40] as long as you got that measuring tape
[2:02:42] you're constantly going to be measuring
[2:02:43] yourself you're going to be measuring
[2:02:45] you and you're going to be measuring
[2:02:46] those you go to church with you'll be
[2:02:48] measuring those around the message and
[2:02:50] I'm going and tell you before get done
[2:02:52] ain't nobody ever going to never ever
[2:02:54] match up as long as you're holding the
[2:02:56] tape but if you land the L the hand of
[2:03:00] Grace Hold the tape he will be able to
[2:03:04] exactly know where it fits and if
[2:03:06] there's anything liking he'll take care
[2:03:08] of it the last 15 minutes before you
[2:03:10] leave this
[2:03:13] world praise be to God aren't you glad
