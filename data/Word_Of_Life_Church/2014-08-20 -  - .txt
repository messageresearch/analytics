brother matthew and sister roseanne will bring their little baby boy would dedicate him to the lord today bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to jesus let's put our heads together heavenly fathers we stand before you today with another miracle of life how great it is dear god dear jesus our brother and sister they want to bring your little son into your presence you've given them the awesome responsibility of being able to raise this little child in this most wicked sinful day and we know lord much of what our children become will come from the influence of their parents the way we train them the way we teach them we can cause them to have such great battles in life because of the wrong things we say or the wrong examples that we put before them so i pray that you would help them lord to be able to instruct him time should tear that he would get old enough to be able to receive you into no round from wrong may the presence of god be able to move on his heart when he's young before the evil days would come i pray for my sister lord that you would help her being the fifth gospel a powerful gospel the gospel of mother that she would be able to influence his life may hear them sing songs of the cross and the blood and mercy may he hear them reading the bible may an atmosphere be so created in their home that will be so godly that angels can visit their place lord jesus keep him from the evils and the diseases and the sicknesses of the day we commit his life to you dear father in jesus name amen [Applause] that's the well i do always mess up stuff no let's stand together if you would happy to be in the house of god together today presence of the lord amen counted such an honor to be gathered together once again presence of our great king how wonderful he is to us give us of his great abounding mercy and grace we so thank him let's turn to matthew chapter 4 if you would again today matthew chapter 4 verse 8 will read verses 8 through 11. we'll pick up on the third temptation of the lord jesus when satan has now offered him the kingdoms of the world again the devil taketh him into an exceeding high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and as i mentioned to you last night satan is actually allowed to cause jesus vision to break into a very fast-paced supernatural unfolding nowhere that is if though it's like this one slide after another after another at another of the glory of these kingdoms jesus is on this exceeding high mountain so elevation is also causing the effect to be enhanced and magnified he's been without food now for 40 days no doubt he's dizzy he's cold all these things are now affecting him and verse 9 says and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith jesus unto him get the hints satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him what a change from the devil to angels amen our kids are starting school uh some of them i guess this week some maybe next but uh we certainly want to remember them today and not just today but as the weeks go by some of our kids are in public school some in home school so i'm not sure if we need to pray for those in home school if i pray for the kids or pray for the moms but maybe the dads whoever it is that does it but we certainly want to remember them i can't imagine what our children face what they go through the opposition the everything that they go through so we certainly want to keep them before the lord that god would just bless and be with them anybody else have a need request before the lord today with uplifting of your hand let's pray together heavenly father as we approach you today dear jesus we're so grateful for your mercy and your grace that's been extended to us lord i'm asking you now that you would just help us as we approach this part of the service that you would anoint me lord jesus but what good would that do father if you don't anoint the people to be able to receive so i pray to anoint me and anoint them as well father you see these prayer clothes that i have in my hands today lord sister lynette you see her in need sister sharon down in kentucky lord but praying for her that you just bring complete healing and deliverance for her as well lord as i mentioned our children uh some of them starting back to school this week some of them attending public schools some of home school different setups but we're asking you father for each of them that you would help them lord we know dear god we do not emphasize education but we also know lord in the civilization of the society that we live in it's such an emphasis that we we have to have it but we pray that you would help our children and the temptations and the things that they face we know lord god that they're living in a terrible time but i believe they can learn while they're young to deal with peer pressure lord jesus we know that you don't save us in this world and then put us in a bubble but you save us and then you give us the power to be able to live a life before them so i commit our children to you today father may you just help them dear god in the name of the lord jesus and the saints said amen praise be to god before you're seated uh every now and then i'll give you just a little bit of an update or something that we're doing overseas and some of the works that we've done i just wanted to share a couple things with you today in the last couple of weeks of some things that we've done we've been helping some other brothers here in the states who have had a burden on their heart to be able to bring and translate more of the messages into the spanish language we are been able to donate money toward that also to works in in africa all different parts of africa philippines uh guyana different places around the world so in the last couple of weeks we've been able to donate eighty thousand dollars toward those works [Applause] brother jim would you signify that by raising your hand being the treasure of the church thank you would you also signify brother jim that this is a drop in the bucket proverbially speaking over the years raise an hour people can sit hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars and one day when you stand before the lord jesus and he goes to doing all this list of all these things and you're going to say when did i do that you mean i'm responsible we see the way i read the bible it's a father's place to lay up for his children i'm doing my best to make a reward a big one may i also say most of this giving is not to white people this eighty thousand dollars that we gave in the last two weeks was none of them to white churches there may be some white spanish people that'll benefit by it but most of it is people of color [Music] people of color [Applause] i've been all over the world i've been all over africa i have never preached in a white church in africa never purchasing a white one in india there's one pastor that we support full-time in the united states and done so for several years he is a black man why are you saying that oh i just like to scorch the devil every now and then just scorching and people have said that i'm a racist and i think it's time for me to confess and just really come out and be open and plain and honest i am i am i prefer one race above all the rest the god race and of course we have checks and bank drafts and all that sort of thing to prove all these statements jesus must have been so weary so weak so exhausted mentally physically psychologically being high on the mountain imagine the breezes were blowing on this side of the mountain of where he was at the only highest one there in in and around jerusalem his mind must have been weary his stomach gnawing with pain his nerves were tore to pieces he has not only the kingdoms of the world laying before him but the salvation of millions of souls are in his hands but as a man he chooses to humble himself and submit himself in such a way i hope you can if you don't get anything else out of the service today you can get this one thing the lord jesus meets satan in these challenges not as a preacher not even as the incarnate son of god was the fullness of the godhead bodily in him but he meets satan in these battles as the weakest christian that would live thereafter now if the lord jesus conquered satan as a captain of the host then everybody beneath him would have an excuse to fail if jesus meets satan as a prophet then everybody that is not a prophet beneath that call would have an excuse to say you cannot relate to me because you defeated him as a prophet if he met satan as a preacher then everybody that's not a preacher beneath that call would say it's not fair you met him as a preacher it's not fair how can you require this and me i was never a preacher but if jesus met the devil and defeated the devil as the weakest christian that would ever live on the face of the earth then everybody from the weakest up would be without excuse [Applause] praise be to god hallelujah [Applause] so he meets him in human weakness and psychological weakness in bodily weakness perils in his body perils in his mind the temperature was cold the elevation was high his body was weak he meets it in the natural realm and now he's meeting it in the supernatural realm to where that satan is allowed to take jesus in a moment of time and cause something supernaturally to happen to jesus in such a way as let me just background from last night a little that he takes the glory of america the glory of paris the glory of england the glory of zimbabwe the glory of all the kingdoms of the world and he stitches them all together as it was a fast-moving video in a moment of time and shows them the glory of the war of the world the kingdoms of the world he carries him up in the future of shows those kingdom which don't even yet exist he moves into the realm of dimensional travel by which the lord jesus is able to be carried up under spiritual influence and satan bombards him with all this going on in a moment of time now here's satan also by showing the lord jesus hitting him at this weakest time in his life all but i'm so glad that the lord was able to meet it this way but he doesn't just offer him that this now but satan now apparently feels this is the last time whether it's the culmination of the way he can see jesus attitude who knows exactly what it is but if you notice in this third temptation satan does not use any scripture he does not say it is written or it is written he does not use any scripture this time he pulls back all of that he comes with a brazen boldness which he's not used in the prior two examples the other time it is rich and they give his angels charged over there it is written but this time he doesn't even go that way so he comes to the real point or the jest of everything that he's been leading up to and that is worship me or fall down and worship before me now satan is going to offer it in a simple approach but with a very compound complex thing behind them now it simply comes and he says all these kingdoms of the world and all the glory of them i will give you after all you're supposed to be a king you're going to be the son of david you're going to be the messiah so i will give them to you just in a matter of moments you can bypass the cross bypass the suffering by pastor humiliation all the trouble of life you know yourself what the bible says about you how you're going to be cast out hated rejecting the spies of him so i will offer you basically what you want to accomplish without all of this suffering it is absolutely not essential you do not have to go this way to be a king if you want to be the king of the earth i will make a bargain with you are you interested jesus and as a man jesus contemplates i wouldn't have to suffer i wouldn't have to be beaten i wouldn't have to be whipped i will not have to be ridiculed all the rest of my life people will love me people will accept me people everybody will stop making fun of me my birth nobody else will make fun of me from this point on i'll be the king so satan promises him i'll give you this kingdom but no cross no humiliation and remember now satan is not offering him nothing in eternity there's nothing in the millennium mentioned there's nothing after the after time is over that is mentioned you know why satan has nothing to offer on that side now if you will check every promise that the devil offers you and see where they lead to he can offer you nothing beyond time he can offer you nothing in heaven he can offer you nothing in the streets of gold he can offer you nothing in the millennium because he has nothing to offer [Applause] praise be to god oh hallelujah hallelujah satan don't even have a back alley if there is one in heaven he don't even offer have one thing to offer you and i in the eighth day cause he won't be there he has nothing to offer you in the millennium because he won't be there he will be bound down there in that pit by a chain of circumstance [Applause] luke says it this way in luke chapter 4 verse 6 and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me to whomsoever i will give it boy don't you know he loves to brag about what he's got he loves to do the same thing to you and i today now this temptation would eliminate the pain of the cross it would eliminate all that jesus knows that he's going to deal with but remember one thing that satan is trying to do he's trying to get jesus to live in the realm that adam lived in that eve lived in that moses lived in that ache and lived in and that is the realm of selfishness he wants to get jesus to move beyond what the cross will require and that is self-denial because this is one thing satan cannot do he cannot deny himself it's just not in him you understand that it is not in satan to operate this way now the essence of sin is selfishness now we know that sin is unbelief but the essence of sin what causes you and i every time that we do wrong whether it is lying or saying something wrong or doing something wrong or whatever it is the essence of what causes us to do that is because we are selfish concerning that matter that we fell into so satan knew that from the very beginning why was it that eve listened to the lie of the devil selfishness she wanted to be able to partake of the forbidden fruit and to be wise like god what caused abraham as we looked at it what caused abraham to to frisk his wife before pharaoh and abimelech selfishness what caused aiken to take the wedge of gold and the babylonian garment and cause the entire church of god to fail in a battle that god led them into what caused that selfishness so satan is approaching the lord jesus in the realm of selfishness you don't have to deny yourself no cross no suffering no humiliation all crown and glory and honor and praise and adoration no death to self which is the modern gospel of the day now if you look at it it's it's amazing when satan is able to move even on the hearts of genuine people of god that still fights selfishness oh you sound a christian i don't fight it there's not a person sitting in this building that don't fight selfishness maybe that baby i dedicated a while ago but don't worry he'll pick it up soon enough it's in us it's in the fall it's part of what we inherited selfishness now come on church get with me watch this and seven compound names of jehovah brother man said it be a selfish thing if a man's heart isn't out to save his brother there's something wrong with his heart no matter what the condition if his brother hates him if his brother's against him if his brothers tried everything he can to tear him down yet that man's heart pulls for his brother we can do that right no matter what people do to you no matter what they say no matter how much they run you down now i'm pointing to you to the essence of sin the reason that people cannot do this is because of selfishness but you see the lord jesus came to crucify selfishness and make a way by a new birth that we could too why did david commit adultery selfishness why did he have uriah kill selfishness why did moses do what he did selfishness why do you and i do what we do many times selfishness why do we get angry if somebody gets our parking spot out yonder selfishness what bothers us if somebody gets our favorite spot on the pew and we can't get nothing out of the whole service selfishness now watch you mean a brother hates you and is against you and tried everything he can everything he can to tear you down and yet you still love him and pray for him there's something in you that calls out oh my brother you're wrong but i want you to be saved let me say this friend if there is anybody in this world today that you don't want to see say please find a way to make your way to this altar before the service is over i know of absolutely no one no one that i want to see perish i don't know of one mortal that i want to see go to hell if i do i'll stop preaching right now and ask you all to pray for me notice this again in enticing spirits notice the sight title of the sermon enticing spirits little things those old tempers and everything like that that keeps you down and say god i don't want that thing no more i'm sick and tired of it i'm ready today to discard it i'm coming now lord i want to get away from all my selfishness if my brother doesn't treat me right i'm going to get on facebook and i'm going to call him a devil i'll tell you oh that's the happy valley version [Music] if my brother doesn't treat me right i'll pray for him now the key is not praying for him but it's how you pray for him god let his car blow up god let his wife divorce him god let him lose his job may's nose fall off from the garbage disposal maybe break every one of his fingers off except for one just to aggravate him god i pray the judgment of god will come down on him you ain't got the holy ghost that's not the spirit of christ it's the devil well praise the lord now watch this if my brother doesn't treat me right i'll pray for him anyhow if my daddy doesn't treat me right i'll love him anyhow if my wife doesn't treat me right i'll divorce her and i'll get me a younger one cause she's old and ugly anyhow if my wife doesn't treat me right or my husband i'll go about humble before god lord have mercy what a peculiar way to approach this your wife don't treat you right or your husband don't treat you right but the answer is that you go around humble before god i thought that was the problem [Music] you see why we needed a prophet with a message don't you let's just face it we don't know how to get out of this world we don't know how to love people we don't know how to do we're always pointing at ourselves they keep me wrong they keep me wrong they treat me wrong and what do we do we exalt self instead of humbling ourselves so god can bring an answer well praise be to god notice again now enticing spirits now let us list out every way if you've got a temper you've got something about you that you talk when you ought not to talk oh god layeth there now lay it there watch the fire the altar come down and take it away man we need a bonfire broke loose in the message when it comes this don't we watch the love of god look it up watch all that old selfishness the way you've been your brothers have a bleep machine where you could just bleep me on certain parts they don't have one back there so i guess i'll just go ahead and read it what's all that old selfish is the way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband selfishness the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you've talked to people in church lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of god will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn in its place somebody tell me to go on thank you now your voice is on tape that you said it but you told me to but you still said it you didn't have to god notice he said jesus speaking of the lord jesus has to have access to every room in the house talking about our heart every compartment all the little secret things of life he's got to have access to every bit of it then he becomes lord what does he want to come in your heart for is to be your lord he's knocking at the door to be your savior and if you hold selfishness and pride and malice and all these things in your heart he can't be lord though you accept him in he can't be lord jesus can't be lord of the selfish art listen to this children you talk about serious things you see what pride and selfishness does it shuts you out from the kingdom of god not just been married to three times not blasphemed the holy ghost not calling god's prophet a liar selfishness and pride will shut you out of the kingdom of god the same way bliss family will this is serious this is not something to play with oh my i wonder sometimes he said as we think what will happen to this generation and i wonder what he would say about it now if he'd preach to this generation now can i go on watch this an image of christ now remember it's only the sick that demands attention service just the sick they demand attention when you see a preacher and may i not limit it to a preacher but may i limit to every church member that wants attention i'm somebody just remember there's a spiritual sick person they're needing attention now they're needing attention and no doubt they don't have a diagnosis of what kind of attention they need they want this attention or that attention public acknowledgement or attention from the pastor attention from this that another but brother madam is going to tell us actually the kind of attention they need they need the attention of the spirit of god to give them something that will take that attitude out of them oh my lord now what they actually want is something that will appease that but that's not the answer the prophet said they need what they really need is something that will take that attitude out not just appease them mama notice let me read this again they need attention but they need the attention of the spirit of god to give them something that will take that attitude out of them notice how they said they're so strange and heals them from their selfishness wow heal them from selfish how do you get healed from selfishness now all of us have been injured and hurt i've got scars all over my hands all over my body like you have from scratches and crepes and whatever more that we've been through in life and your body has the built-in mechanism to be able to to heal itself and close up a wound at all and we've had our souls healed by the power of redemption so now we're talking about of being healed from selfishness not just delivered but actually healed so the selfish sister is an approach or an attitude of selfishness which is actually a sickness so we're not just casting a devil out of somebody and the devil is going to leave them and then they'll be healed but it is a sickness [Music] give them something that will take that attitude out of them and heal them from their selfishness and big ideas and big million little you the holy ghost makes us all the same there ain't no big preachers in this message and little preachers in this message and big singers and little singers were all just children of god that's why we are all just children of god but you realize that many folks i believe with all of my heart around our message need a healing not so much in a prayer life they don't necessarily need their soul heal but they need a healing of selfishness and this is what satan is offering to jesus go in this approach think of yourself first you look jesus think about you what about you you're thinking about others you're thinking about the will of god you're thinking about the program of god what about you and naturally that's the way we're made who did you feed for you come to church today you or me jefe juror your wife brother andy she figured your wife brother jim who'd you see why it's built in us it's built in us this is why that our makeup feeds on selfishness and jesus was so much a man he had to experience selfishness so for a few moments jesus thought about jesus i wonder if we really realize how human he was was it a moment was it five minutes was the ten who knows how long it was but first say it this way for a few moments of time jesus didn't think about gabriel jesus did not think about warren what jesus didn't think about donnie about gene about wes jesus didn't think about none of us jesus thought about jesus listen brother bam says the holy spirit can't deal with you when you got prejudice and selfishness now whether it's prejudice by color whether it's prejudice by doctrine prejudice by the size of your church or prejudice by feeling like you you're more illuminated than any other church in the message prejudice comes in all shapes and forms and sizes don't you see why satan wants to get us on this exclusive something that we've got something special about every other message church as long as i'm the pastor of this church i'm going to slay that devil i'm going to keep it before you we are only one of many this ministry here is only one of many and may i say a very small one compared to many they're around the world our church is not some super something other than everybody else is supposed to look to that is a lie from the pits of hell donny reagan's ministry terry horn daryl ward and the rest of these men we are not the example for the people of the message we're only one little pebble among many great stones it is selfishness it is prejudice [Applause] watch this in the marriage of the lamb the prophet said so i think that's the way preaching the gospel if it don't stir you up a little bit and feel your spiritual gastronomics and make you a little bit sick to examine yourself with the bible says that old temper and selfishness and ungodliness and love of the world and television and things that that night and leaving church set empty and pew said empty when you ought to be out there like jesus you got his spirit in you trying to get everybody in the country to come to your church and receive christ do you know that brother branham told us in 1956 55 56 that one thing that god ahab in trouble was because his wife didn't want him to attend church on wednesday night notice again he says in communion we want to keep ourselves clean from selfishness some of you would die before you'd smoke a cigarette you can't even stand to get around where people smokes them because you feel dirty and filthy you'd never put a press a a whiskey bottle to your lips or a can of beer but there's more to being cleaned from than smoking and that sort of thing we need to clean ourselves from selfishness notice he said we want to keep ourselves clean from selfishness keep our sin our lives clean from the things of the world that will not be spotted with that we want to be ready for the rapture so this temptation of the lord jesus is focusing on the essence of sin which is selfishness and for a few moments now jesus begins to ponder yes sir let me project it to you this way maybe he ran his hand over his side down his back thinking according to god's way my back will be tore to pieces let's just say that he run his hand upon the side of his face where his beard was said according to god's way they'll reach up and grab the hole to my beard and pull handfuls of it out maybe he ran his hand across the rest of his face and said according to god's way they'll spit on my face is this what i want but from this offer that satan is giving offering me i can go from here to here i eliminate the beard plucking i eliminate all the spit i eliminate all the ridicule all the ones making fun of me because he says he'll give me the kingdom of the world and i'll get it right now i mean i have to wait two thousand years i don't have to wait for a throne i go from here to here in a matter of minutes and for a few moments jesus thought about jesus do i really want to do this can i take this i'm so glad when jesus thought about jesus that his thoughts about jesus was not the lingering thoughts that his thoughts were about me brother talking about you so the next time you go to thinking about you so and so did this to me and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that maybe you ought to go back to jesus on the mountain and think about wait a minute what if jesus would have thought about himself what if jesus would have kept himself there and well he's the one he's going to realize it's not fair this ain't fair not even fair it ain't right you know how come i have to go through this and how come i have to go through that you know what you're doing you're thinking about yourself instead of thinking god is this your will god is this what you want i don't want this i don't want to go that that's what i'm talking about selfishness of course satan by now already is realizing this could be him this could be him watch in matthew chapter 4 verse 9 and he says unto him all these things will i give thee if thou will fall down and worship me now here's the price in the temptation every time satan offers your eyes something there's always a price for what he's offering us he's never giving you anything free of charge i don't care how much he wants to tell you it's free there's always a cost and it ain't going to cost him it's going to cost you and maybe your wife your children your church whatever more whenever you yield to a temptation there is a price now here jesus finally hears the price of going from here to here versus coming around here and waiting two thousand years and all this stuff that you get over here to become king so here's the price all you have to do is fall down before me the disciples on here nobody will ever even know it the church is not here the priest ain't here the preacher ain't here ain't nobody here but me and you and do you think that blabber mouth the devil is going to keep that a secret you've heard me say it before he's the type of a guy that'll talk you into robin the man call the cops on you while you're doing it jesus wouldn't have got up off of his knee before every devil out of hell would have known it caiaphas would have known it it would have been known oh yes sir it would have been known around the world from the cohorts of the abyss they would have been able to know all of the world and the kingdoms of the world would have submitted to the lord jesus and he would have been exalted to the throne and the king of the earth without a bride without any overcomers and generation after generation they would have died and the book of life would have remained in the hands of almighty god so here is the price so the price that satan makes from this conjecture is that you are rewarded by doing wrong you are rewarded by doing wrong so you do wrong and you're rewarded yes ma you're rewarded that this and this is part of it this is the way he projects it any price that you have to trade off of god's word you're going to be the loser now watch he says all these things while i give thee thou will fall down and worship me now notice the way this is written here in the eastern method of acknowledging the superiority of a person so by jesus bowing down before him not so much that satan was saying all right now worship me as god you wash him oh lucifer oh satan i worship hill oh no all he's asking is for jesus to bow down and he can worship god that's okay but acknowledge that satan is superior do you understand what this is it is michael and lucifer once again praise be to god do you understand what's going on right now in laodicea it is michael and lucifer once again do you understand the warfare against the bride who's bringing the warfare against the bride the church what is it michael and lucifer once again what will it be when he ascends upon the mountain fighting for the children of israel it will be michael and lucifer once again all you have to do i'm not asking you to pray to me i'm not asking you just give me superiority you saved that devil how would he ever do that the same way he does you when he tries to convince you his weapons are greater than yours do you understand when you believe and suggest that satan's power his kingdom his darkness is greater than what god has given you in this age you are giving him superiority over the word of god oh you're not bound to answer satan you're a god satan you're a god but whenever you sell the devil's power says it's harder than the holy ghost what the devil's kingdom is greater than the kingdom of god you're worshiping oh you're worshiping god but you're falling down before him and giving him superiority you are telling him you're greater than me i can't do this i can't overcome this i just you're greater than me you are falling before him and giving him superiority in your life when my bible tells me greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world satan knows most of you will never fall before him you'll never make a hexagon or a pentagram on the ground and never offer a goat you'll never offer a sacrifice he didn't want to try you that way but he'll try to wear you out with sickness and distress and worry and family problems and financial problems and church problems and all kinds of problems and then get you to say oh i can't take it no more i can't do it no more i just don't know what to do anymore i'm at my wits and i don't think i'll go back i can't live this don't you know what you're doing you're bowing before satan again you're not worshiping him as god but you're saying he's superior over you you're saying he's superior over this bible he's superior over this message let me just level the ground right now before i go any further it is absolutely totally impossible for satan to make you do one thing you are giving him power that he does not have and you are scared to death of a defeated enemy i feel like having church [Applause] now watch the lord jesus in verse 10 then saith jesus unto him amen get thee hands satan well you need sister i got jesus in my heart but i want him in the name of jesus father you see the need of our sister now she's got you in her heart she says lord but she wants you closer i pray father hallelujah now what satan offers jesus this now watching jesus replied then saith jesus unto him get their heads uh-oh satan first time jesus has referred to him in a personal way there is degrees of offense and defense there is degrees notice the first two times when jesus responds to the word he responds to the word that this he's crossed the line he does not call him lucifer he does not call him devil he does not call him satan in the first two attacks but this attack demands personal detention [Applause] hallelujah oh i think sometimes our righteous indignation needs to get built up i ain't talking about at the pastor some of you do good get mad at the pastor some of you do real good getting mad at the deacons are mad at your wife you ought to get mad at the devil the devil's stealing your joy the devil's stealing your peace the devil's stealing your children the devil's stealing all this around you and you sit around passive and let him get by with it don't get mad at the preacher don't get mad at your wife get mad at the devil he's the one that's doing it to you [Applause] then saith jesus unto him kitty hence satan a great temptation must be withstood with great resolution i'm sick of your mouth you hear me i'm sick of you satan i know who you are i know who you are sometimes you need to acknowledge some thoughts going through your mind them thought you ain't a child of god you ain't this other sometimes you need to call his name and say satan i recognize who you are and you are a liar and the father of the lie [Applause] what's the power over the temptation how does it come by submission jesus didn't drag out his computer and his laptop and put together 47 pages of quotes don't you notice this temptation here notice where he comes from he will stand satan and he comes against him with power he demonstrates the power of god in the weakest christian's life to defeat satan upon what gifts emotion talking in tongues the word of god friends there is power in separation there is power in separation you never get overcome your trials and your tests and the things and the sins as long as you're fooling with them and playing with them separation from evil gives you power over evil mixing evil with righteousness weakens righteousness and we are living in an age of constant mixture mix this mix that mix this mix that i say that is alive the devil if we want power in this day we've got to separate ourselves i ain't talking about just from the world i'm talking from yourself of course people don't like the idea of separation they want mixers but everybody in one big mixing mix it all up mixing up for hell firing tribulations where they're heading hallelujah guilty head satan foreign thou shalt worship the lord thy god he overcomes all three of these temptations from one old testament book the book of deuteronomy like david's standing there flinging his sling when he's got five smooth stones down on his pouch but david reaches down there and grabs a hole to one the book of deuteronomy and he defeats the devil out of that one book if one book was simple three passages of scripture would overcome this temptation right here which is nothing like any of us have ever went through anyhow if it would do that what in the name of almighty god with an entire bible a thousand tapes sermons preached all around the world what would that do to empower you and i as believers to overcome the devil what am i speaking to you about children resisting temptation what does he do he takes up his shield takes up his shield takes his sword and he said it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and he'll moan me shalt thou serve how did he know which one of these scriptures in the drama would work why not take genesis 1 1. in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the deep and god said let there be light and there was light why not use that one that's a wonderful scripture what do what what about using the one where god said let us make man in our own image and after the image of god made him after the likeness of god made him male and female created either is that a wonderful scripture what about genesis 3 15 that he would send the serpent versus one i use that one that's a wonderful scripture why not use deuteronomy 18 15 behold the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like an unto me why not zechariah 12 6 the man whose name is the bravest what about haggai 27 the man who is the desire of the nations what about psalms 22 1 my god my god why is that forsaken me all of those scriptures are pertaining to him but he not only had word he had leadership to know what scripture to use [Applause] now watch him just strip him down thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve amen you are a creature and may i add a creature of time and i do not believe in worshiping creatures or creation which paul said in the book of romans that they would do in the last days worship the creature more than the creator but daryl tell me the other day and preach the sermon here's just a week or so ago about about selfies and every year there's a dictionary where the in the united states and different parts of the world they had a new word a word of emphasis you know and they pick one for the united states and then they pick one for different parts of the world but the one word they use for american different parts of the world was the word selfie because people are getting so tied up on their self taking pictures of the self and now they got therapy for people that are so involved in selfies they cannot keep from taking pictures of themselves and one of the therapy the way they start out with the therapy of sending these people through the therapy of selfies is being able to get them to not make a picture of themselves for 30 minutes and then they move it up for an hour i'll tell one thing i'm not sure what they say about their self but i don't see it myself oh goodness what i see in myself is the greatest enemy that i've got what i see in myself is the person who's kept me from getting close to god the person who has hindered me my life has been my selfie what is it friend it's an age of self love it is an age when people are so wrapped up in the self don't you see what that testifies to the headship of satan ready to come to the body because that's the way he is he don't love his people he don't love his demons he's the only one that he's concerned about if satan's got an iphone he's loaded her down with selfies i guarantee you imagine out of hell every day here comes he's selfish all these demons and demons saying good lord i get so sick and tired of seeing this selfies of the devil selfies of the devil here he's got one from this angle and one from that angle he's frowning and he's smiling he's got all this kind of why because everything is built around him he will sit in the temple of god showing himself that he is god so you can imagine my sermons i just go so well in this age living in an age of selfie and i'm saying you better deny yourself if you want to go to heaven and people just click out of curiosity and go over halfway in the sermon you all say dear lord how do them poor people stand that guy oh that's a marvel to me as well but i can't believe here we are we're teaching and i try to be everything you could be my do this and do all of that and i'm saying you better pray about all that i told you last time some of you didn't like it but i'm gonna say it again some of you tell your kids oh you can be the best at this and you can do this and that and the other and you're feeding a bunch of lies into their mind first of all how do you know they can be the best and there's eight million kids out there just like yours is even better you're telling them a lie you won't tell them there's a santa claus and you shouldn't but you'll tell them they can be the best at this and the best of them sometimes you're lying to them kids and you'll give them an attitude over the dawn they need help they need help they need help to learn how to die they don't need help to build up their ego build up self self self self sal what are you doing to them kids [Applause] but brother donnie if we don't tell our kids how great and how wonderful don't ever amount to nothing that is a lie i'm a living example standing before you today amen i was never encouraged that i'd be anything as a matter of fact i was told i'd be nothing stupid ignorant that i'd never announce anything when i started preaching in pentecost preachers would get me up in the church after i preached that day and said if you're a preacher of the woods is full of them self-esteem ego ambition trash heap but there's something in me bigger than the words of my daddy there's something in me bigger than the words of pentecostal preachers you'll never amount to nothing boy you're not this you're not that the other all i knew is there's something inside of me bigger than i'd hurt all of my life and i refuse to let that get me down i refuse to let that but i can tell you of others who were constantly uplifted uplifted uplifted by the parents uplifted uplifted uplifted by the parents don't you see what you're doing you're feeding that spirit that's on that child you'll never overcome that by giving that spirit what it wants you've got to help that child to grow up and you're not doing it by feeding it [Applause] well glory you never graduate at the top of your class i never graduated you're kidding me i'm not you mean you didn't graduate kindergarten they didn't graduate kindergarten when i went but now i graduate kindergarten first grade second grade third grade in between grades summer school class graduate graduate graduate my lord my grandkids have had more graduation i've had i'm 58 years old you're laughing at me but i want you to think what's that doing to them but your parents have got it in your mind that's what you've got to do to make them better christians really and where is that example in the scripture in the message of the hour you've accepted a bunch of communism and socialism into your mind of what you think you've got to make them kids train them up and the way they should go not the way you think they ought to go and then have me to change them once they get saved train them about the way they should go in the way of humility not arrogance and pride [Applause] well no doubt that was for some of the norwegians or maybe for some of the folks down in brazil or some of the folks from over in africa i know it wasn't for none of you little darlings here so he looks right at him and he says satan do you understand a man or woman who has authority and know their position it's not how loud you scream i've been given by almighty god the authority to cast out devils i don't even have to raise my voice i could whisper to that devil and if your faith in mine is right he'll leave but because some of you think it's the volume of my voice sometimes i'll only deafen you that's for your face it ain't for mine because i know all i have to do is speak to him and if the conditions are right he will leave authority is not volume authority is not so loud that everybody's saying they're shaking and quivering not under the power of god but because the speakers are so loud that is not authority authority is knowing who you are knowing you've been anointed by the presence of god and you're not going to back up and here was jesus your imaginableness come out of his mouth saying god oh no oh no this ain't david this ain't moses this ain't achin this ain't either saint adam satan amen whatever we worship is the god we serve and if you feel more passion and more movement in your being toward money than you do god that is your god i can preach on the cross some of you never cry and preach on the resurrection you never shout i can preach on the second coming of the lord you never move but if the dollar lost three quarters of its amount today while we were in church and you read that after church on your smartphone and you said dear god i'm broke there's your god [Applause] oh god what are you doing it's connected so deep to your emotions you fall all to pieces the cross never moved you the resurrection never moved you the comet of the lord never moved you but your money moves yeah some of you are moved by your kids playing ball games you're moved by this and that and the other whatever you worship that is your god and jesus said thou shalt worship the lord thy god matthew chapter 4 verse 11 i really like this verse then the devil leaveth him i don't know about you i need a lot of this verse 11 in my life [Applause] now jesus never had a devil and the devil wasn't in him but the devil just left away from where he was he couldn't handle that word i mean it finally reached your place in amazing the first temptation the devil never left second temptation the devil never left that there must have been a determination there must have been a sound in his voice there must have been something there that satan said i'm out of here his first assault is for his appetite the lust of the flesh second assault glory pride lust of the eyes third assault ambition the pride of life jesus met all three with the word now let me just take just a couple minutes submission empowers us to resist satan's lies james chapter 4 verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and after 40 days he will think about or pray about happy valley church do you believe this scripture is the word of god no ifs no hands no perhaps no commas if we will submit ourselves to god and resist the devil this is god's promise he will flee i don't care brothers what he's tempting you to do if you will resist him and resist him and resist him it is god's word you don't have to flee he will oh but you say this smoke in this drink and i i can't do it you're believing a lie of the devil he is tempting you and tempting you and tempting you and he is weighing out your resistance [Music] submission empowers as i was us studying yesterday and the lord god came to where i was and he spoke these words to me submission empowers to resist the word is a military term the word that james uses submit yourselves the word is a military term that means get into your proper rank so if you're a buck private quit trying to be the pastor this is one reason friends we can't overcome we're not in our place you second guess the prophet you second against the preachers you're second getting everything going on why it's because you have exalted yourself to a position above god's generals in your thinking you know how to run a church better than god call men do and then you wonder why you can't overcome you are empowered by submission not submission to me submission to god so get into your proper rank so you imagine a guy goes down to the office tomorrow and he wants to join up well they tell him to report over camp lejeune or wherever they do all this training stuff you know man he walks in all right guys here i am i want to start out i want to be a five-star general matter of fact i think i'll be advisor to president obama i'll tell you one thing i want to go over to iraq i'm going to show them how tennessee boy will clean up this mess let me out of that hillbilly i may walk one-sided cause i'm on them hills down there and i know how to straighten out the world's problems and you imagine that sergeant as he looks at you and they say i'm gonna make you look like cat food i love getting people like you oh his toenails go to turning up in his toes and he said i can't wait [Music] and you've got some pretty curls hanging down there that was so attractive to the girls come in with your pink tennis shoes on and your gold chains and you say i want to be in the marines come on in [Applause] [Laughter] and then you walk out there one thing i think army look better for our pink tennis shoes and i believe one thing i believe a man would fight better fed longer i believe by the time you get out of solitary you might think twice before you open that thing and run it wide open submission how did jesus overcome this remember as the weakest christian but being jehovah's servant satan is trying to pull him out of jehovah's servant post of duty in his first temptation command these stones to be made bread don't you see what he's trying to do break rank now he's trying to get him to move out of servant position and servant attitude back into logos let's stand unconditional surrender is the only way to complete victory unconditional surrender in his own way jesus showed us this example this is how jesus fought remember i told you last night the celtics the bethenians the scythians the romans the greeks but especially with the romans they wanted to train every soldier but they would fight the same so whether you seen one or 10 or 50 or 5 000 roman soldiers you'd know who they were by the way they fought they were not trained in the mentality of being soldiers and heroes on the battlefield they wanted to live because they would give them a large salary and a large tract of land if they lived when the war was over so they would worry about a medal of honor so to speak that wasn't worried about having a big name they wanted to live that's where i am i want to survive praise god i'll get my reward after sometime else i want to come through this war on the other side so whether you saw one if one roman soldier was out there by himself and he was bushwhacked and he got tied back there if there was one or five thousand you knew that man was a roman by the way that he fought they had their door which was called their shield two by six foot those of you who watch ben hur and you watch the different ones of the roman soldiers fighting it's contrary to history the way hollywood projects them they do not come out like this and open it up and use the sword the shield is decoration they stayed behind their door and only when they would peep from around their door and see the head of the enemy come around would they move and jab their enemy because they knew that door as they called it was their protection reminds you that our lord jesus said i am the door he is your door stay behind him so jesus totally submitted to god the father and this is the way you overcome in animation jesus didn't argue with the devil he doesn't debate with him i'll tell you one thing saying glory to god i'm the word don't you know this devil that you're going to hell you're going i created you you ain't nothing but a shut down devil i'm going to preach your assignment how much of our time in life have we wasted by talking to him and at the end of the day he was still the devil and you were still the son of god order of god and what did you do wasted the entire day arguing and fussing with the biggest foster that's ever been did you convince him at the end of the day did you make an altar call let the devil to revenge did you baptize him i missed it if you did you wasted your time stay with the word stay your place resist him and he will flee and the word flee is to run with caution to get away for your life now if i said that in a charismatic church this morning they've been hanging off the chandeliers and y'all standing there looking at me don't you believe this do you believe that's what god's word says oh that devil's been aggravating me all day because you led him according to the word of god submit yourself to god and resist the devil and he will run for his life [Music] amen brother brad maybe we should kind of show these people the way they let satan intimidate them but in their mind the way they think that he is it says the way god's word says he is [Music] tell us big boy [Music] can i go to heaven seed you're lost there's no hope for you i've got you you're defeated you're going to hell the bible says he goes forth as a roaring mind but to a real son of god instead of being like that or daughter of god he's [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] it depends on which one you believe he is we go to baptism today let him come and prepare for that so how are you going to walk out of here today like this big ferocious king of the jungle or showing not acknowledge he's a great enemy absolutely silly not acknowledge he's got a position sure but also acknowledge when you do the word of god instead of him being like that he's like this why would that lion run from me i've seen them in africa not in the knoxville zoo told you years ago i mean care was in south africa and they put us in a game reserve and it was not time when we got there so we didn't know how close it was to all this stuff so three four o'clock in the morning we're awakened by this sounds [Music] when all of a sudden carol is plastered to me you thought somebody's super glued us the only reason i hadn't plastered myself to herbals there wasn't enough room i'm sick and tired of you christians letting this devil bluff you he stole your joy he stole your peace he stole your children not because he has rights because he's ass right you've seen the little lion king those of you that's got kids no doubt many times grandkids and when the little lion is there and he don't know that his daddy's behind him and he goes wow but his daddy's behind him and whenever he roars his daddy goes [Music] this little guy's looking at himself well that's the way you and i may be we may take that word and was like wow but it ain't my voice that the devil hears [Applause] i don't want it to be your voice are your horse mother ryan we want it to be the voice of the word oh we make it our human voice and it's trembling and quivering that the devil ain't hearing the voice of wes or the voice of donny he hears the voice of the original lion king hallelujah children there is no temptation that you cannot i felt like starting a revival hey pizza golf let's pray together dear jesus i pray lord through these simple illustrations today something would be said or given to these people that would help them to meet the challenge of this day no doubt if we would have lived in the first century the year was say 96 97 the emperor is domitian he is now sending her children to the coliseum nero loved gardens so we're told and he loved to get out in the darkness of the night and walk through his garden we were also told they would take christians filled with the holy ghost wrap them in a certain type of cloths poor tyre pitch all over their bodies and they would use them in human torches as the hero would walk through his garden our brothers and sisters how could they ever face such a death they were anointed they were anointed lord jesus we believe we're anointed to stand to this day and face the hell that we have to go through but lord
