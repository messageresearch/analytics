[Music] is [Music] [Applause] nobody but jesus could do that no matter how much anybody else would love you and care for you there's only one that could pay this supreme price let's turn today if you would in the book of romans chapter 6 verse 12 so i'm happy to see each one of you here today in the house of the lord and as brother keith mentioned earlier we certainly miss those that aren't here some that are sick and some that are still just being very precautious because of the covet and all that and we understand that we certainly pray god will let this thing go through and pass away from us don't we amen romans chapter 6 verse 12. what a great um a great passage of scriptures that we want to look at today the marvel of the mystery of the new birth and what it does for us is so wonderful and so amazing but i find it a marvel on the other side what it leaves undone waiting for the adoption of the body as marvelous as the new birth is and what it does the marvel of what it leaves undone to me is quite phenomenal as well romans chapter 6 verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body now i'm sure we believe together that this is not speaking to sinners there's no way this passage could be written to sinners they would not have the ability to do this so it's speaking to someone who has received a new power a new life let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin so it separates you from your members which can be instruments but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead ah so you see this proves we're talking about folks that have a new birth this can't be a sinner sinners are not alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not shall not have dominion over you well i want to do better i want to do better but i can't help it the devil made me do it i can't help it i ain't got no power over myself you need the new birth the new birth empowers us to where sin will not not possibly perhaps you see friends if folks read romans 7 in the light of romans 6 a lot of the mysterious thing about romans 7 will totally be dissolved but whenever people are scared to death of romans 7 they think somehow it's a baptist chapter in the bible it's not a baptist chapter it's the holy word of god but when we read romans 7 through this understanding of romans 6 and to be able to separate it for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace aren't you grateful for that today i made a lot to be remembered today in prayer spourheads if you would heavenly father we love you today lord i want to say how thankful i am that we're able to gather together again i realize not all of us lord some are still sick some are because of their jobs and work and because of their health they consider it lord still such a risk to get out in public or maybe mother and father that they're with or children or whatever more but we pray father that should be mindful of them lord as i look across the congregation today there are faces that i don't see and i pray that you'd be with them today lord jesus may you comfort them and help them may this thing pass from us lord that we can come back to a state of normalcy we're grateful lord that we're not having to be restricted to streaming totally that we're able to meet together father you see lord in our state that in the out in the rural areas it's on the increase or discovered in so much that the white house it issued that the state of tennessee start requiring a mandate of mass we pray father that you'd keep this evil from us lord lord we enjoy church we enjoy our lives and the things that we have to do lord how can we assemble ourselves together if we're sick and won't let us come together but we pray that you'd be mindful of us lord not only of this covid thing father but other sicknesses and diseases that people are dealing with and depression and sadness and all these things may the spirit of god i pray move for your children today speak to us father god as only you can do today from your word in the name of the lord jesus and the saints said god bless you may be seated turn with me if you would to galatians chapter four and let's read again of this uh allegory of ishmael and isaac for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bond maid the other by a free woman but he who was of the bondmaid was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise now does this mean that isaac was not born by sex desire no no he was still born by sex desire but it was a miraculous birth notice this that paul in verse 24 he said which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which generous to bondage which is agar now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise notice now he wants to separate even in the new testament that there are two categories of people by now of course the ishmaelites the midianites the shia bikes all these other hagarites hagarines all of these different ones were very noted among the jews they had battled them for many years and it was a common knowledge among them that these other sons of abraham had caused such trouble for the promised sea but it goes beyond isaac and ishmael now we're talking about a new verse we're talking about a new genos a new generation so how is it that there are still two covenants there are two mountains that we look to one is sinai and the other is jerusalem one is agar which is the new testament term for hagar and one is under another woman how can there be this brought over under grace if grace applies to every individual in the same measure if grace is given exactly the grace of forgiveness of sin the grace of sanctification the grace of a new life the grace of the token the grace of rapturing faith is given to every individual on the same measure how can there be two covenants in the new testament how can there be a church natural and a church spiritual if both of them are under the same measure of the grace of god now you see this doctrine of this was brought in after the new testament that there was no difference between the bride and the church but now watch this man who is able to separate law from grace and he's going to separate the children of the bondwoman from the children of the free woman he's going to separate agar from sarah he's going to separate church natural from church spiritual and he's also going to go a little deeper than that and he's going to bring in hebrews 4 12. and he's going to say that the word is a discerner of the salts and the intents of the heart the dividing of sunder that would separate the spirit and the soul from the moral and the joints so the separation friends it's not just us separating from the world out here well we don't drink no more and we don't smoke no more and we don't go to bars and we don't go to dances i thank god i'm separated from the world you're just on your way to the final separation which is you separating from yourself cigarettes is not your greatest enemy marijuana heroin drinking that's not your greatest enemy your greatest enemy is yourself and you'll fight that until the last day of your humanity on this earth it's not something like the new burst when the nature is eradicated forever that you'll never have to deal with that old nature again the body is still left in this image of neutrality it bears the image of the beast within it contains the potential to serve god was in it is the potential to yield its members as instruments of great truth and righteousness and great acts and great deeds which god requires us to do but on the other hand in this body is also an unregenerate untamed nature which is that which we were born with we were separated by spiritual death from our first husband which had the rule over us which was the nature from the soul but alas the verse of the soul does not override or bring into total submission and control by birth the fleshlight but it leaves it in the state by which it is a constant consequence of a war that is going on between you the body and you the soul now what this how paul runs his parallel so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free now i find this amazing we're going to read here in genesis chapter 16 verse and we have the instance of abram and syria and we have god speaking to abram along the way and we have abram's response in different facets of his journey but these that we're going to read today are the very first written words of sarah syria that make scripture now i want you to notice the very first words that are recorded of syria in scripture they are not words of faith they are not words really of great understanding they are words that typify how that even an elect person that can lean to their flesh can say things that are so contrary to god's will now notice these are the very first words of syria that are written in the bible now sarai abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord has restrained me from bearing i praise thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her notice now what his response is and abram hearkened unto the voice of syria now during this time in the law of the land which is still observable in the hirian text which is found many many years ago written i've told you about it before on a cuneiform that was written in a round cylinder and they wrote different transactions of property and laws and things that was there so whenever a woman lived in this part of the world at that time she could have a slave or many slaves and it would be called a bond made now that woman was actually the property of the mistress so she could send her mistress her bondsmate into her husband if she was barren what sarai was asking for was perfectly legal by the law of the land but it was not the promise of god now i understand that god up to this stage of the revelation had not included syria by name in the program god had not told abram that syria would be the one to bring it but abram was so my he had such a desire in his heart to be a father never remember he's 75 you know plus now whenever this happens and sarah seemingly is too old to bear no signs of life at all and no doubt both of them are so anxious for the promise of god to come to pass in their life and god doesn't always make everything quite clear but god will say sometimes generalities and god will leave the particulars out now the particulars are many times what gets us in trouble it's the small fine print it's that which we really don't think matters much and god does that many times in order to try his people to see what they will do with that which is unwritten you see that's why there's many things that's even left in the message of the hour that are unwritten and unsaid and people are still wanting the same thing today so they will take tablecloth quotes well brother branham told my grandpa this and my great grandfather and i'm not going to dispute any of those sort of things but brother man told us to stay stable thoughts on the tapes praise the lord but yet there are many times that people want to bring god's word to pass and it wasn't said but it was almost said you can almost read it into that or you could almost make it say that well i don't want to just almost make it say it i want to see where it's said and if it's not said to be honest with you i'm not interested in wasting my time and spend a lot of time trying to study it i i have enough to be able to study what's already been written and been said but notice that god never by name identified sarai in the revelation so sariah looks at herself now notice what she does she looks at herself and she identifies i'm old the milk veins are dried up i've got this issue that one that one that one there's no way that i can be able to be a mother but apparently abram has still got life in him so then she looks at herself she looks at abram and she looks at hagar now the problem tells us she was a beautiful younger egyptian woman now the way the hurian law was set up that even though this handmaid would be able to go into the the wife's husband and she would conceive of him according to the hirian law actually that child that would be conceived from that union would not belong to the bonds made it would actually belong to the wife because the handmaid was the property of the wife how cruel slavery was but yet because this was a slave then whatever she brought forth whatever she had actually belonged to the mistress now abraham and at this stage abram no doubt had a great desire to see sarai included in the promise but he didn't really know yet because god hadn't said but i want you to notice the fault on abram's part that abram never consulted the lord about this so instead of abram getting along with god and going to find out now father you've not said if this is the right way or not but serie wants me to go into this young woman and she thinks maybe that you will use this egyptian and complete your promise through that let me tell you right now god don't really need our thinking god don't need our two cents keep it yourself your flat broke the way it is as far as morality and all the things around us come on that's right well we we need everything that god's given us so abram enters into this proposal without actually asking god but yet you can look at it from his point of view that looking at himself knowing that he had only a little more time physically that the time for his wife was already gone here is a young maid that possibly would be fertile and if he would be able to sow his seed in her then this might be the way that god would do it i mean god didn't say he wouldn't do that but the catch is god didn't say that he would now looking at a human this is where we get sometimes that we are calm and a dilemma that we don't know what to do now it looks like this might be the right way but it also looks like this could be the right way and sometimes you'll find it's not always written which one is now you know that as well as i do that god doesn't give us the book of our life and say tomorrow when we get up we'll open it up on monday and it's like you're already already written so you go down through the oil at nine o'clock watch this at 10 o'clock do that at 11 o'clock do this and now you're going to come up against this choice today but that's all right don't worry about praying about it don't worry about running it through the word i've already got it wrote down here so when that comes then go ahead and make this decision but how cold and indifferent our walk with god will truly be so god doesn't give us the book of our life and all the choices and all the pitfalls and things that are going to be there and god sent out watch this and watch this and don't do this and do that and do that but instead god gives us great things about our life and then he gives us the holy ghost which is that person-dwelling presence and it will give us unctions and it will give us leadings and it will actually produce feelings you all know what i'm talking about that you feel in your heart don't go that way don't do this and there's many times that as humans we tend to override that oh all the rest of you are innocent but me i don't believe that and yet god will put that there for our benefit and yet abram will now whenever he's faced with this decision it must have looked right to him it must have sounds sensible now we're certainly not going to make an infidel or an unbeliever out of abram but let's make him a human being like all the rest of us because we bleached out the lives of these prophets we've bleached out the sages of the bible and we've actually taken away from them their humanity that's one reason folks have gotten so mad at me over the years of preaching that brother branham was a man he was not a god but he was a man he was born lost he needed to be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost brother branham still made mistakes till his life ended on this earth why because he was a human being that's right but yet the people of the message don't want to hear that no more than probably some of the jews wanted to hear that abram made a terrible choice but i want to tell you here today abram made a terrible choice he listened to his wife and sitter praying and seeking the counsel of god no doubt now not not to be rebellious and not to be stubborn against god's will but because the will was just not made plain and instead of him having that personal communion with god about this situation was eagerness and with great desire let me tell you something fran one of the greatest battles you and i will ever have in this life is us trying to make our ishmael the spiritual ruler of our walk with god you see our ishmael will lead us to the kebab every time he will point us toward the east toward mecca he will point us towards something that we can do in our flesh something that we can reason something well it just makes sense it just makes sense sometimes faith don't make sense you know that's right now watch what what's going to come out of this in verse 2 and sarah said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i praise he go into my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her i found this so amazing this morning when i was looking at this word in the hebrew it is bonaire and it means to build to establish cause to continue build a house or establish a family now the idea of this word is that the children actually is what builds the house because it gives a lasting extension of the merging together of the man and the woman's chromosomes so it is a mixing together actually they didn't have houses or whenever abram really as far as what he lived him but he lived in a tent so the word that we used for house actually was not addressing a place that they resided but they resided in a tent which was not a permanent dwelling but the word they used for house was bonnard which was the establishing of that that house itself which was the posterity of children which is of course what david said in psalms 127 so the children were a blessing from the lord so sarah is not just wanting a child but it's that she's saying that god will establish the house of abraham through this egyptian instead of me she's wanting more than a baby she's looking for the establishment of the house of god or may i say so you can understand it the church so the house of god would be established by women denominations saying we are the bride god come into us and father our children they don't line up with your word they don't believe what you said but establish your kingdom through us and we will be your house god didn't do it then god won't do it now now it was actually until many hundreds of years later that they started using the word house to represent a building where people live but prior to this it was the extension of the man's life so sarah is saying to abram look i cannot help you build your house i cannot bear your life i cannot reproduce your dreams i cannot help you extend your house your banana but this worldly woman can [Music] so you might need a little bit of pentecost with a little bit of methodist with a little bit of baptist to give the bride revival the bride don't need no methodist mixture and no pentecostal mixture we've got enough word to have our own revival and we'll just pray and ask god to give it to us [Applause] so the children then by the woman was bestowed this is the way that it would be that the woman uh the handmaid would give birth to a child or children and then she would bestow them upon the mistress and she would actually raise them and wean them into that spot then she would relinquish her rights now remember the prophet runs this parallel whenever he preaches seed is not heir with a shot and he said this is what lucer done which is what hagar done when hagar give up her child to another woman's bosom and then the prophet runs that allegory that parallel side beside and he said that luther gave up his son and he called his son's name justification notice then the offspring or the progeny out of the loosened revival notice that's what he said in february 1965 and he called justification a son oh my so justification was the son of the lucerne move and then what happened the lucerne denomination took that son and claimed that son as their own so loser raised that son by faith when god gave him the revelation that just shall live by faith and then what did they do they relinquished that son over to a denomination called lutherans today show me a revival in any lutheran church so what did they do then they took that son and they said god will build a house through us we are the lucerne denomination and god will establish his house his kingdom through us and what did god do god left him sitting right there and went right on what did wesley do wesley gave up his child to them western denomination well i wish somebody would preach with me this morning what did pentecost do gave up their child to the pentecostal organization can i bring her on down home once a lot of the message folks done they've let the spirit of organization come into the message and they've raised up a seven thunder woman a perugia woman a tape woman a returned woman and they said we're going to build up the house of god no you're not not with no denominational prostitute spirit on you yay you've got to be a virgin unto christ out of the virgin-born bride will god produce hallelujah that fulfilled word to jesus christ and if we at happy valley church ever get under that old denominational thing god will do us the same way he will walk right off and leave us oh but i don't want him to walk off to you i don't want him to leave us here we can't build his house we cannot do it without him we need him every hour we need him every day we need him every service we need him to live we need him to breathe we need him with all of our being so in the hebrew she's saying i will be built up through her what's amazing is this is exactly the same word that we find in the land of babel come let us build ourselves a city very same word so hear silly eyes pointing to a way that would be outside of god's provided way amen god help us you see it's the same for us whenever we desire to build whatever it is outside of god's program for our life no matter what the plans are how well they may be constructed and however may seem to fed our lives the thing of it is is that what god wants for you is that what god wants for me but then to deal with a little bit about those who build the house labor in vain unless the lord builds it notice this again in verse three and sarai abram's wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abraham had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife and he went unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes now abram goes into her and she conceives and then when she finds out she's a child what does she do she looks at cereal the mother of the promise and she actually despises her she has an element of pride and arrogance and she looks down on the promised mother as if though she's greater than her boy we get them looks all the time don't we they still look down on the promised one notice anseli said unto abram my wrong be upon thee you think what in the world did he do my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judged between me and thee ain't that a typical human being we do something and goof it up big time and then we blame it on the lord and somebody else well i'll tell you one thing i wouldn't have got into pornography if my wife would've done this and that and the other and i wouldn't have done this and said this if so and so had done so and so why don't you just face the facts you're like all the rest of us you're full of mistakes you're full of error don't trust that old animal of yours that old flesh of yours will deceive you it will lie to you it will let you down and then when you get in trouble all my say i told you so [Applause] oh god help us my so now sarai comes back and said the lord judged between me and thee and she was the very instigator of this but abram said unto syria behold thy maid is in the hand due to her as it pleases thee and when sarah dealt hardly was her she fled from her face but here now we go into some years of silence you see god had a great program for this woman but not under the name syria but before sarai could be changed to sarah there had to be a change in her heart you see if god would have come down the very next day after this took place and said now i'm going to change your name to abraham i'm going to change her to say i it would have been a body change without a heart change we can see from these scriptures that sarah is not quite right yet so she doubted god's promise she doubted god's program there must have been at least some sort of spiritual inclination or she could have never doubted it because the prophet tells us plainly that she doubted god's original word so whenever she does this it shows a weakness about sarai that needed to be changed before the body would be changed now we're going to go into about 13 years to where they'll be let's sit this way there'll be about about 11 and a half to 12 years of trying silence and we're not going to hear a whole lot a great deal about the promise of god being more made manifest to syria but the focus is now going to be on ishmael and abraham is going to raise him up according to josephus and many other historical writings that now abraham is instilling in ishmael he's going to be the heir he's going to be the ruler he's going to be everything that abraham looked for and yet here is a prophet of god and he is wrong as wrong can be teaching ishmael that he's going to be the heir that was not the heir at all but yet him being a prophet now don't get quiet on my children prophets make mistakes and those of you who cannot say that cannot quote that quote well praise the lord so here abram is teaching and pouring all of this effort all of this work why sure he was his son biologically yes but he was not the promised son of the word and yet he nurtured him and fed him and took care of him and remember abram had this weakness even when it cometh law because he done lot exactly the same way he had no error can't you see where our great personal battle is under the abrahamic faith it is us being able to identify ourselves in the proper place of the scriptures of us being able to look not you and lot not you and ishmael you and isaac the real you there is your promise that god's to give you but if satan cannot stop you from recognizing that there's one god and believing many great truths of the bible then he will try to stop you on the fullness of your inheritance no matter how much land abraham had what good was it going to do him if he did not have an heir and this is what he told god he said god what am i going to do the only one i've got is this eliezer this eliezer which is from the house of damascus can't you see where the problem was abraham battling for years he first saw it was what then he thought it was going to be ishmael oh now if anything well here here comes eliezer what is it it's who's going to build the house who's going to build a house can you imagine the people that day following abraham and they probably had quotes wrote down where abraham said ishmael will be my heir one day ishmael will stand in the pulpit and do this and this and this and ishmael will lead the sheep and ishmael will do something else but that was abraham saying that not god hallelujah now notice this matriarchal position that sarah tried to make it work but with what a substitute so she wants to make her matriarchal position come into view but through another way another woman that gives birth to this child then she will embrace this child and say now this is my child i don't care how much she said it was her child it was not her child now let me go a little farther and sit this way i don't care how much you think your past is your past it's not your past i don't care how much you say your body and your shortcomings and your mistakes and your failures is the real you it is not the real you you can call it mother you can call it jack rabbit you can call it whatever you want to call it but the prophet of god has identified to us you've never done it in the first place oh hallelujah you see in order to enter into this great position now she's going to be the matriarch of this great great union that god has prophesied about on his word but there must be a change in our heart now let me compare it here we look at tests and trials of life and things that we go through and we wonder lord why would you let this happen why would you let that happen yet every one of us if we'll be honest we'll be able to look back after trials and tests have come and gone and we say my goodness i learned so much out of this i wouldn't take nothing for that i've had several folks that's went through the church here in the last six months or so and they've gone through some real difficult times and talking with them and they've told me you know different ones i'm at various times i wouldn't take nothing brother donny for this thing i've been through and said oh my goodness why wouldn't you think could they really say that why would they say it because they got something out of that a closer union with the lord jesus a stronger faith you know a greater understanding of his plan for their life over and over again and yet they sit here and hear the word you mean the word alone can't do that sometimes we have to experience things sometimes we sit there not ahead amen amen amen that's right but we still don't get it until we go through it and then when we go through things it changes uh oh you say well i in my mind i resentment if god in his mind could not imagine how you feel then you tell me your mind is so strong you can imagine how people will feel when god couldn't do it god the great eternal himself could not place himself in his mind and really think harry i'm gonna think now i'm gonna think how how harry feels i'm to think how jd feels and i'm going to think it's so strong i'll become it no he could not do it well if god cannot do it you and i cannot do it either we cannot think ourselves into some of the spiritual status that god wants us to have we must go through it now sarah is going to a time i hope you understand this it's not going to be a time of glory it's not going to be a time of greatness the things she's going to experience but actually sarai until she changes over is going to go through a time of humiliation you imagine the shame because now abram's becoming a greater and greater man while leaving and living in this land people come to trade with them and barter and so on and you imagine when they begin to hear this baby cry oh have you got a baby have you got a child well yes yes it's my child oh congratulations sarah it's not mine actually it's it's hagar's my mate but i've taken it and i'm raising it so what is god doing god is molding something in syria god is molding something in her heart in her nature that is preparing her for a complete body change oh my but of course sarah no doubt wanted what we want that god would just mold the body change in us and we'd bypass all of our knocks and blunts and life and our mistakes and so on and god would just give it now friend he ain't gonna do it that way now we want to enter into a spiritual matriarch position of the universe because actually the bride of christ is the queen of heaven she is the very epitome of god's love in the feminist form oh it wouldn't be wonderful it would just be spoken to that place but god wants us to take a character from this human life that has been molded and made and shaped through hard trials and tests and through the back side of the desert why that's his choice i'm not sure but we'll understand it i'm sure once we get that you see before she could enter into this truth matriarchal position she must reach an element of peace and contentment within herself instead of struggling what do we see about this in genesis 16 1 we see a woman struggling with the will of god we see a woman trying to understand a woman trying to perceive and a woman feeling like god needs her help to bring it to pass she's not at peace with the promise of god you see when we are at peace with the promise of god and we're sick and we're prayed for if we don't get well tomorrow and next week next month that has nothing to do with it we still believe god's word well if god you know goes down through here and lets it and go on for months i'm still healed i'm still delivered but a person that doesn't have peace with the promise they're constantly looking they're looking they're searching they're trying to help god oh god what can i do god can i do this god can i do that sarah sarai you see these 13 years were a constant humiliation 13 years of molding and moving and shaping her heart into a matriarchal heart not only of a little boy but of a divine promise no doubt she was a loving substitute mother because probably by now she had accepted the fact well i guess this is it ishmael's as far as i'll go i'm justified and i'm sanctified i guess i can't get the holy ghost so i'll just go to church live a pretty good life and do whatever i can do maybe god will have mercy on me at the white throne judgment no doubt there's people that have that attitude this morning that the holy ghost has identified with you before the foundation of the world and he's only waiting on you to stand up to your matriarchal position but you've accepted justification and sanctification that's as far as you've gone in your walk with god notice this through this pain through this humiliation i'm suffering something is happening to sarah her ways are changing you see only then can sariah become sarah now just preach to me for the next few minutes so y'all won't take it personal all right now donnie i'm telling you something this morning son one of the worst things you can do is take your human makeup and make it the spiritual guide of your life you see so many of us we wonder well brother donny i don't drink i don't smoke my i don't have an ishmael who is it that fears god's promise won't come to pass it's your ishmael you're identifying and thinking that because you don't run around and you don't do this and that that you don't have a black dog you think because you don't go out here and commit adultery on your wife well where does that fear come from where does that doubt come from where is the question of god's word comes from you pack it within your flesh all night but you see it's only then when sarah has been changed inwardly that sarah can be changed outwardly i know when the body change is going to be i know when it's going to be now not a not a day or a month or a year or a second or something like that when the bride is ready you see when we asserie refuse to let ishmael be the guide of our soul but instead we let our soul guide ishmael boy you all require us more than a bunch of baptists now notice this chapter 18 of course is the great illuminating chapter of the body change in genesis 18. but we go in these years of silence that cereal eye is becoming molded day after day week after week i'm no doubt becoming a wonderful mother and she would take this child and love it as her own as much as she possibly could and she would still though it was hung over her that she knew that that hagar was still telling him things and hagar was still feeding him things now like it or not he is still half egyptian amen who jesus well if i was you i wouldn't look down too bad on ishmael since your first birth is between satan and eve [Music] [Applause] he said brother donnie where's the serpent see that tell me where it ain't it's all over everywhere i'm looking at a bunch of it this morning because i can't see your soul but i can see the offspring between satan and eve you say where in the world you get that out oh i'm i'll share it with you just momentarily you see god wants to bring us to chapter 18 of our lives and that is the body change but god will not bring the forced body change until the willing change has been inside of us to wound that we make this ishmael subject to the word well they always want to do it now we're going to convert his smile to isaac no way he'll always rebel he will be stubborn he'll be a wild donkey of a man and some of y'all wonder why you're so hardheaded i don't wonder at all come on now y'all can't say amen at least pray real loud oh my notice this again in galatians 4 22 4 it is written that abraham had two sons the one bob a bond made the other by a free woman now paul actually puts this under the new testament name but in reality they changed abraham didn't have two sons ishmael's father was abram amen ishmael's father was don reagan or whatever your daddy's name was amen but the father of isaac was a bra him hallelujah hallelujah oh can't you see our natural birth who is the father of my natural nature coming under the fallen adamic nature that i inherited oh is that right but who is the father of the birth of my soul it's not the first adam it's not don reagan it's not a pastor somewhere it's not a prophet somewhere the father of the birth of my soul is almighty god [Applause] amen amen and it's the two strains of my fathers that fight within me [Applause] notice this in galatians 4 28 now we brethren as isaac was of the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now now remember when paul writes this the ishmaelites the hagarins all of them they're pretty much you know they're not even around them so it's not like it is now the palestinian conflict to where they're battling for the land the roman empire was the one that was ruling when paul wrote this so it was not necessarily making reference to the ishmaelites the midianites the medianites and all the rest of those heights but he's making a spiritual reference to the battle that goes within us paul come to a great revelation when he said that in me that is in my flesh dwell us no good thing now that's not a very uplifting scripture is it that is not a great wonderful scripture that crowns our humanity with crowns of gold but you know what it's a great revelation if you'll ever come to it but some of you saying all of heaven is in your flesh some of you saying your flesh is so good and i think this and i think that you're crowning ishmael i said you're crowning ishmael notice this hebrews chapter six part three abraham had many children he had one before he had isaac which was showing the slipping up of the unbelief of sarah who wanted hannah pronounces it hannah to bring the child thinking she was too old and god to bypass and make some other way from the way he had promised to do it but god keeps his promise no matter how unreasonable it may seem notice sarah thought that maybe she could have hannah or hagar rather her maid to give birth to a baby through abraham and she would take it and that became ishmael listen what it cost which was a thorn ah so ishmael is a thorn in the flesh is he from then until now think of what one mistake think of what one mistake of an elect woman done the wars and all the conflicts between the arabs the ishmaelites praise the lord one mistake you see god can forgive us of our mistakes friends but when we do wrong we're sowing seeds and forgiveness does not dig them seeds up out of the ground praise the lord it is still ongoing now and it's worse now than it was in 1957. notice this in genesis 21 8 and the child grew now we come to a time of course whenever isaac has been born he's about three years old something like that and ishmael is 16. now he's weaned and oh what a happy time it is they're having a great celebration and the child grew and was winged and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was wayne and sarah notice it's no longer serious and sarah saw the son of the denominations which she had born unto abraham mocking i've looked at this word and studied this word for years but i was so overwhelmed friday whenever i was looking at this i could not believe it i just simply could not believe it look at this hebrew word mocking is the hebrew word messiah you can see the hebrew writing there and it has the same root as ichsak which in the english is isaac therefore the way moses applies this word he uses it as a verb so a word of action so he said ishmael was isaacing ishmael was isaac in other words ishmael was acting like isaac lord have mercy so ishmael the flesh was acting like it was the heir to the promise [Music] lord children i want you to think today of all the issues in our life and our walk with god we felt led to do this and felt led to do that and felt led to do look at all the crazy stuff that people blame on god i felt led to do this and i felt like i felt led to put my wife away and marry another well you didn't feel that of god to do that that was the devil that done now not the holy ghost and people will take their makeup and they'll take we take our oddities and our peculiarities and we think we're being led to the spirit people that are you know we're all different and we're all unique and god's not against that but what god has a problem is is whenever we will let ishmael go to isaac and we'll let ishmael decline what i well i want to do this and i want to do that and i think i need to do this and i believe this and that and the other and we tried to make ishmael i said what is ishmael doing ishmael wants isaac's position in the family of abraham and in the economy of god so ishmael is acting like isaac so he's ridiculing he's making fun and he's harassing him but he's doing it in the form of isaac oh lord think of it how many times that our old flesh our old maker well i think this and i believe that my goodness as a pastor how many times have i seen it that people got in such situations in their life and they thought it was the lord leading them it wasn't the lord it was this but we'll turn it around nine times out of ten and blame it on the lord well i just knew it was the lord i just knew it was the lord it was your ishmael acting like you're isaac he's one to lead you he's one to guide you oh my but you see ishmael was a natural man reproduced by abraham's strengths but isaac was a miracle son your new birth is a miracle child [Applause] your new birth is supernatural america isaac even though god used human instrumentality it was a supernatural burst and god's issue is this when we will try to replace the supernatural verse with a man-made one you understand why folks have pulled away from the message in the last several years of all this stuff going on don't you understand why it proves they were only ishmael isaac they were acting like isaac screaming amen to the quotes the same quotes now they hate the same prophet now they hate how could they do that they was never born again we gave them a book we gave them a tape we indoctrinated them but how many of them ever got to jesus christ and experienced a genuine new birth i don't want our children just to quote the prophet i don't want our children just to know the prophet's life story i want them to know jesus christ to be filled with the holy ghost if not their ishmael will act like isaac [Applause] see the koran teaches that ishmael was the child of promise so the muslims believe that god's covenant was with ishmael not isaac as a matter of fact they teach that abraham took ishmael up to the rock on moriah they also teach that abraham and ishmael went into that part of arabia and built the kebab and you all know what that is all right i'll explain it to you it's a stone structure which is thousands of years old been rebuilt and rebuilt but there's a black stone which is the foundation stone and they teach that abraham and ishmael went there into arabia saudi arabia and built this place to worship allah will abraham come out of hedonism how did he turn around go back into abraham never worshiped allah but elohim abraham didn't get a letter off of allah's name he got a letter off of elohim's name so it is a cube now what's amazing it historically is those of you that don't know anything about it you know that it actually became a focal point for many of the hedonistic religions and worship isis different ones and then when muhammad comes on the earth then muhammad claiming to be one of the seed of abraham now actually muhammad was born down through the tribal lineage from ishmael [Music] so here's an ishmael they want to make him take isaac's place ishmael brought pain difficulty hardship in the home as soon as he was conceived argument started that sounds like the basis of islamic religion you know oh i know you ain't supposed to say anything about that but you say i don't follow them supposed rules i follow the holy ghost i know it's not accepted by the left and i really don't care whether the left likes it or really who don't like it i'm going to preach the truth today y'all want to hear the truth let me tickle your ear so they know that the bible is a book of the jews as a matter of fact muhammad even calls the people the jews in his writings the koran he calls them the people of the book the god also tells them it's all right for them to kill him so he's one confused man wasn't it so because the bible places isaac in the middle of god's promise then they must needs have another book so then an angel comes to him in a cave and begins to reveal which i don't i don't doubt that at all i don't doubt that he didn't see some kind of supernatural being but i know which side did it come from wasn't an angel from heaven well praise the lord then what did he do it put isaac out of the covenant and put ishmael then you have to have your own book to make your life here we got now so we've got judaism we've got christianity and we've got islam all three of the major faiths of the world all three of them with their roots from who abraham and all three of them saying the others are wrong each one of them say no you're not the bride we are and they say no you're not we are well one of them's got to be praise the lord so what will your flesh try to do it will try to take your book of your natural birth and make it the predominant force the koran of your life and then if the preacher preaches something or you read something in the message or you see something in the scripture that you don't like well i just don't believe that i just don't think i'm going to do it i think brother don is a little bit legal or i think brother donnie leans two minutes this way brother branham that's just brother branham's idea so you've got your own koran ain't you well well well y'all didn't even know you had a koran did you some of y'all said i ain't never read the quran in my life oh yes you have you live in that quran out of your life every day honey every day you follow your flesh the koran of your life is leading you around and the kaaba of your life guess what the kaaba is it is your own will that you will worship and exalt above the word of god well i want this and i want that don't make too much fun of those islamic people for being heathens [Applause] any idol that we put before the word of god we are committing idolatry [Applause] let's stand look friends look where israel in the world is right now so the muslims want to claim they are the promised people their book is the promised book the kabbalah is the place to go to worship that's why they will always no matter where they are i've seen them around the world i've seen some down in knoxville at walmart a few years ago and it's after 9 11 so i was a little bit anxious needless to say they opened up their trunk and they got out their prayer mats and they figured out which way was east and they got down there i got my truck headed out of there you never know they'll be packing a bomb somewhere but why do they do that because the kaabah is in the east well why why do they want jerusalem why would they want jerusalem because he supposedly had a night vision and he went up to jerusalem and he supposedly was carried up into heaven so then what does that do give them claims on the capital city of isaac so medina the kabba and now jerusalem so they build their big edifice over this rock which supposedly abraham was going to offer his son which supposedly the ark of the covenant set in the hewed out spot i saw a picture of it last night a huge outspot on this gigantic rock and they called it the dome of the rock and no jew was allowed to set his foot on that mount so what do they want to say this is ours and isaac you stay out well you say that makes me so mad at them a bunch of people will turn it inwards cause your ishmael wants to tell your eyes you ain't telling me what to do if i don't want to go to church i ain't going you ain't telling me to worship my hand you ain't telling me to raise and praise god i ain't doing it you ishmaelite [Applause] can you imagine friends these people teaching their children i saw a video the other day of a three-year-old girl which was a muslim she was being asked by her instructor why she hated the jews because she said the jews are pigs and apes and we will kill every one of them you see those who live after the flesh will die after the flesh now we we gasp when we say oh it's terrible oh that's awful when you follow your flesh instead of the spirit of god you're living after the flesh well i follow my flesh instead of the spirit of god aren't you glad for mercy so the ultimate question is this which son is the heir now most of you christians that love god with all of your heart you would die for the bible the muslims will die for the quran they say the bible has been interpreted so many times and went through 40 different authors and written over a period of 1500 years how in the world could it be authentic the koran come from one person they say which is the voice of god and they would die for the koran they believe they're on the right side ishmael we believe our promised son is not isaac but jesus but they say jesus did not die and they say jesus was not a son because allah has no son so jesus was not a son of god he was a good man and they profit oh you won't hear this on cnn or nbc or any rest those places but we're children of truth don't focus so much on and all that sort of thing the focus i want you to focus on today is you and your ishmael trying to isaac around and leads you and you fall back upon your human nature and make that the leadership of your life and if you'll recall you acted the same way for the devil when you as a sinner what was it then ishmael what is it now ishmael god don't take converted ishmael he can never be converted it's got to be high second since 1948 whenever they were declared a nation the u.n actually sanctioned it right the u.n sanctioned it david bin gurion stands up we stood there a couple years ago and this little hall wasn't as big as this building here where he stood up and declared that israel was a state the people danced and shouted and jumped and while they're jumping the arabs are gathering together they're getting their mig-29s they're getting their tanks in the next day thousands times thousands times thousands of arabs gather against them would you believe one day i wore the next you'll have to fight for every inch of the ground you claim in god your soul says you're healed your body says look at your symptoms your soul says you're delivered this besetting sin it ain't gonna bother you no more but your body will say i still want it which one you're gonna listen to the koran or the holy word of god declare your statehood this belongs to us i told you before it was hadrian the emperor which wanted to brought the name of israel out from the land so he changed the name change the name from the land of israel oh you know why they hate archaeology in israel you know why they hate it when they find a little old seal like they found six months ago and it was made to the name of barack one of the scribes that lived during the time of jeremiah and they dug it up out of the dirt and been buried for all these thousands of years you know how they hate it when they find that because it shows israel's pre-identity you know why the devil hates predestination in this message it shows your pre-identity before you become immortal [Applause] he don't want you digging back in the archeology of the lamb's book of life and find out you was a seed before you was a human [Applause] thank you hallelujah so every coin ever seal everything they find proves because the palestinians say this is our land it belongs to us but every rock predates palestinia [Music] every quote i read about election predates my natural bertha [Applause] and predicts me being immortal so i keep digging in the archaeology of god's word hallelujah they had a war in 1948 1949 1956 1967 1973 to 1974 and 1978 and it's still ongoing because the way the wind blows from the gaza strip over to jerusalem the capital the land blows out basically one direction all the time every week or so they will load up explosives in balloons small balloons birthday size balloons and put them up and release them and when they do to get them across the wall so it'll explode and destroy jews which they hate to this day why one woman take mermaid take my maid to be your wife oh man well let me not keep you wait until next week spoken word's original seed but every man no matter whether he's a pope priest bishop whatever he is he dies because he's a hybrid that's exactly he was born between satan and eve can't you see why we needed an act of kenosis for the mighty god to empty himself wow what was our problem birth our entire problem was a birth issue so we needed to be reborn praise god you love him with all your heart let's pray together lord jesus how great are those words how great is thy truth lord we thank you no matter how much satan tries to impersonate it it still lives lord god imagine if sarai and abram could have looked forward in time and seen what they would have brought on their posterity she would have never made such a fatal mistake if eve in the garden of eden could have looked forward and saw what she was fixing to do to all of her daughters if adam would have looked forward and seen what he was going to do to all of his children i find it hard to believe they would have followed through but then i bring it back to us and i think if we could look forward to some of the foolish things we do if we'd see the damage the harm to our children our grandchildren to whoever more would we still do them or would we say no lord help us to realize our lives we belong to a body we belong to a move we belong we're members of each other father god help us help us lord jesus to realize brother branham said that he feared not that he would backslide but afraid that he would cause a stumbling block in front of somebody he wanted his neighbors to know he was a christian he wanted the people around him to know that he was a christian yet lord so many in this message are so independent and they don't care they don't consider anybody else they go to church with they want their way and they don't care they're so hard-headed and so stubborn help us to realize father we're not following the bible we're following our hand-written koran we're making ishmael the ruler of our lives and leading him to the kabah and worshiping in the form of idolatry because you said stubbornness was as witchcraft rebellion is this idolatry lord help us father i pray forgive us lord jesus oh but from the very promise the very time that sarah was changed and the bible says god visited sarah praise god what a great honor to be visited by god would you mind if i bring it down this morning sir and say once again god visited happy valley god visiting evening live down in louisiana and visiting this church and that church assemblies around the world god visiting us to speak to us to change us maybe we're in a time of our humiliation a time of difficulty in trials and tests before our change maybe it's to change our heart before the finale of our bodies lord to take that last speck of reagan control out that last speck of yawns control or whitson control or smith or brown or whatever we are to where the soul finally achieves its ultimate goal can say i do nothing but what my father shows me i and my father are one we will not go to a kabah we will not go to some square cube of man-made theory but we will ascend to the new jerusalem the mother of us all help us lord jesus we worship you lord god can we just raise our hands friends in the presence of the king thank you lord god thank you lord god you want to be that type of christian today that you bring your ishmael subject you know the bible tells us whenever abraham died that isaac and ishmael they met together again and they buried abraham both of them could make claim this was our father but we have no historical account or any other scriptural account were they ever met again so at the death of a dispensation a time when god is not now just dealing with abraham but with the promised seed ishmael and isaac go their separate ways they go their separate ways as jacob and esau had to do the same thing and you already know you're there too they had to go their separate ways and it's amazing because it'd be so much easier if it was that way you know our flesh go one way and our soul go the other well that'll happen of course when we die or when they're changed but the thing of it is we live in the same unit but from within the soul the flesh
