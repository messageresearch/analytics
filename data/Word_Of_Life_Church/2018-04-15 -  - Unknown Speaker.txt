is so so good to us I love him with all my heart or speak to you tonight on thou aren't beautiful I don't some of y'all go to smile and place on that they actually I wasn't talking about that they yet it's a beauty that's so far beyond the outside Song of Solomon chapter six verse three I am My Beloved's and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies and then if this is him speaking back to her thou art beautiful all my love as tearsa comely as jerusalem terrible as an army with banners turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me death can de hell curd and demons couldn't do it nothing could overcome but the eyes of the redeemed simply overwhelming [Music] turn away that eyes from me for they have overcome me the hair is as a flock of goats so apparently it must have been long I mean their hair looked like a flock I mean it's a shame when the men in this day it's a shame when my hair is longer than a lot of women's you can never identify them as looking like a flock of goats praise the Lord so sisters don't you let the world make fun of you you wear your crown you wear your crown and bring glory to God by doing so the hair is as a flock of goats that appear from gilead this prayer together Heavenly Father thank you for this day not only the natural day it's been a beautiful day the Lord we thank you for the hour that we're living as the darkness presses against us it testifies that the seventh morning is about ready to dawn time is running out and the darkness of the world and the darkness of sin is so and groping the world that we're in and the saints of God we feel the pressure of it being around us even though we don't live in that as far as our soul is concerned yeah Lord God we have to deal with it as we ask for your mercy and your help to not in this service would you come once again Lord and just anoint the word and anoint our hearts that we can be able to receive from the Father in Jesus name Amen god bless you may be seated it's not a scriptural point but it is a point that most of us are probably common with and probably would agree with to a degree and the point is that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder when we would think about beauty and we would think well a beautiful house or a beautiful car a beautiful tree we look at the flowers are starting to bloom and we look at the different trees thus far that have come into their stage of blooms and many of them even without any leaves on them and yet they've put forth what God gave them and we look at it oh how beautiful that is so beautiful probably many of you have already said that since spring is right upon us and you pass by you know uh I'd say a beautiful farm it's got green rolling hills or whatever type of landscape that you like and you say look at that place look how beautiful that is that is so beautiful and then maybe you drop down you see a certain car a truck or whatever more that's the color you like or the kind of vehicle that you like and say that is so beautiful I'd love to have one like that or maybe it's a lake maybe you go to the lake or maybe you're an ocean person and you stand on the bank of the Atlantic or the Pacific or the Mediterranean or the Aegean or the black or whatever seer ocean that it is you look at that isn't that beautiful maybe yours is a taste of the white sands and the and the blue waters or maybe yours is more like the rockbound coast of Maine or the coast of England or parts of Australia where I've been to where that it's not necessarily the sand but it is the rock and the crevices and how that it splashes against the rocks and you look at anything that is absolutely beautiful well you know you don't have somebody else to come bound they look at so I don't say anything pretty about it I was born here all my life all my life don't stand out to me so to people looking at exactly the same thing one would think that it was beautiful and the other one would would think it's very common there's nothing really outstanding about it at all so we know then that people can look at the very same object or look at individuals and one declare how homely how humiliating how ugly and another one would see absolutely nothing but beauty now beauty can be defined in many ways you know it's it's amazing when you study the cultures of people not only of cultures that have been but cultures that are now and in some of the tribal Africans they still have the the idea the conception of beauty that it is the tribal scars so whenever they are young they will start scarring up their faces men and women alike specially the women and they'll start scarring up their faces and to them that is beauty so many of them will take even serpent chains and they'll start cutting and scarring up and the more scars you have the more beautiful that you are of course that doesn't go over in our culture and the Western thinking we hate scars for the most part we do everything in the world we can to try to cover them up because of our mindset it takes away from our beauty and yet beauty is a wonderful sound and it certainly has been commercialized by the devil especially in the way that we think about it some of you want to right now where is he going don't worry it'll be right in the word all the way but remember that God now in this parallel of course this runs from the Song of Solomon Solomon himself speaking to the Shulamite but it is a parallel of the Lord Jesus and how he is looking at his bride now the world looks at her even from the outside her appearance her dress her mannerisms the way she does places she goes doesn't know they identify that as an occult or a strange and weird people because they do not understand the set of the beauty of holiness now there is a beauty of holiness and probably many of you don't even know the meaning of the word holiness the Hebrew word it is not a long hair and a long dress that is not what the word holiness means the word holiness means separation coming apart now it's dressed part of it it is but that's not the only thing is part of you see you could wear a long dress but if your nature said with a word you still ain't holiness you can be in can cut your hair and not dress like women and all that sort of thing but if in your spirit you're still part of the world you still aren't holding this yet but real true holiness is also sanctification of your spirit and of your mind as well so then when we would worship God in the beauty of holiness it is the divine honour of God beauty is actually an attribute of God now if it was not than every flower every tree every star every planet everything that God made that would be absolutely nothing beautiful about it now if holiness and ugliness and all of that if that was the only thing that would be humility and God's eyes then every flower would have to be ugly there could be no pretty flowers there could be no beautiful trees there could be no beautiful landscape if all beauty is of the world while some of you all are really looking at me strange but remember what Satan has done now as tried to take the outside beauty and to make that more than the inward beauty which can go along with it as well but God looks at beauty in a total different way than the world now the world would be able to look at something that would be beautiful and God would be able to look at some of that and he would say I agree that is divine beauty but what the majority of the world would identify as beautiful and they would say my look at that beautiful woman and then to them as your to the world she's gonna have her face painted of course her haircut she's gonna have on an ungodly dress this that and the other and for the most part that's what they would identify beauty and that's really a shame already I can tell already right here tonight that you all are thinking beauty is only in the appearance of a woman that's very sad you need to read your Bible more beauty has much more to do with the way that a woman looks it has much more to do then would you say that that's a handsome men you're totally missing so much of the declared beauty of God in the creation of the world now everything in the Earth's and in the world that God has made it has its own place and it has its own designation of whether it is plain or simple whether it is beautiful or whether it is designated it is something that is simply necessary but really isn't as beautiful as something else but yet the Lord speaks to his bride and says to her here in verse 4 thou art beautiful all my love as tearsa which was the capital of one of the kingdoms when the kingdom was divided also calmly as Jerusalem terrible as an army with banners so here now the Lord Jesus is looking at the bride and giving to her on an attribute that she is beautiful now there again keep in mind that beauty can be defied by different things now let me give you an example so you know which way I'm going to go now one day a mother had sent her daughter off to college and the girl had been gone for quite some time and she decided to bring her girlfriend homeless earnest she was the closest girl and schoolís her and she was going to meet her mother at the train station now whenever she comes up to the train station and her mother the daughter sitting on the outside of the train and she sees her daughter and her daughter is sitting there was she's visible and the mother runs up to the train and she begins to wave and wave and wave and the girl which has come home as a daughter she looks out the window at the mother and she sees her there and she says oh my goodness look at that horrible woman Oh wouldn't you hate to sit down and have to eat dinner with that woman look at her she is so ugly she is so horrible looking well whenever the girl's girlfriend said that then automatically that did something to the girl so the girl then she began to all yes that is awful can you imagine looking at that woman every day well whenever the train come to a stop and then the girls both got up and walked out this ugly woman come up to the young girl and she grabbed her and kissed her in the heart during and she said oh darling I've missed you so much and I've missed you and the girls girlfriend it's looking at her as you know she just has this puzzled look on her face so the daughter says I don't know who you are get away from me I don't know who you are keep your hands off of me don't touch me get away from me well the local train conductor which knew this woman I knew this girl he comes up to the young girl and it was more than it was more than what he could take so he put his hands on the shoulders of this young girl and he says to her aren't you ashamed of yourself the reason you are so pretty and so beautiful it's because when you was a baby your house caught on fire and this woman was you're ashamed of was outside Hagin clothes and the fire people came but nobody would go in the house because it was so bad but this woman that you're ashamed of your mother took the clothes off of her back run in the house right upstairs and grabbed you out of the baby bed and took her very own clothes and wrap cheering her clothes so you would not be burned and he said you are the reason she is okay the train conductor turned around to the woman and said even though she was ugly even though she was so scarred but the train conductor said those scars are beautiful now you think of us when we were lost in the world lost without God and the Lord Jesus come to this earth hallelujah and he took our sin our shame our degradation every sin that we were upon him he went to that whipping post so you could be healed of your back trouble he went to the whipping post so you could be healed if your kidney trouble or your reflux or your blood pressure your sugar whatever this you're dealing with and the world might look at and say oh he was a coward it's a shame that he's that way but it's all depends on how you look at it in the eyes of a child of God that needs healing and they look at those scars on the back of the Lord Jesus in the eyes of the beholder those scars are beautiful the world may look at him so that is so pitiful I could never look at that but in the eyes of the beholder it is something friend oh my he did not sand and they wrap him in gold and silver and tapestry that would be deserving of a great king but he went there with the love in his heart the house was on fire and you were dying you were burning up as it were on the inside Gabriel could not go in one word could not go him the priests could not go here the spirit God the Father God invisible immortal as he was could not go in but the Lord Jesus said I will go we'll go here I will become their recruits I will become their sin I will allow their scars to be placed on me that I asked you tonight how do you view those scars are you setting the Lord Jesus are you a shape as it a dress a certain way or look a certain way or do you say I am proud to bear the scars of the gospel of Jesus Christ so I see what is beauty what makes beauty so when you need healing do you want a beautiful doctor I have some someone where are you willing to go to a wooden post on there's blood and sinew in tissue in parts of his muscles from the cat of nine tails Aslan at his feet and his blood Souls spilled out it look like an animal have been massacred or will you hang your head and so well so and so sure than that I don't want them to know I believe in Shelton I don't care who's here I want them to know I believe in the power of God I am not ashamed of the scars of my Lord Jesus and I'll tell you one thing if you're a child of God you will also bear in your walk scars for him you will not go in this world without being scarred and be trampled on by the world but you're gonna bear scars one way or another why why shouldn't you BAM for the king of light instead of the king of darkness how then will the divine beauty burst and created in him by the Almighty how will a beautiful life ever become divided and shared among those which are not lovely at all how would you ever take a beautiful life and get that beautiful life out of the not so beautiful bottle you see the Lord Jesus was not a handsome fella on the outside as a matter of fact the way the scripture and the Prophet projects the Lord Jesus imagine if we would have looked at him it had been the kind of appearance that you'd felt sorry for it he would have not had the look that you'd have looked at him and said he's a handsome guy no his appearance would have been almost something that would have turns you away or God you see as gospel is the same way and it makes me sick when you see people that do not want to hear or preach or live the gospel as it is straight sometimes hard sometimes difficult but they want to put it up in the worldly beauty and wash it all down and take all this out of it not out of it you compromise her but yet he calls us beautiful and yet we know in reality there was absolutely nothing about us that was beautiful at all our nature was awful our attitudes who are terrible many of you your language was as filthy as a sailor your habits and life are ungodly and unclean and you were wretched and vile how are you ever gonna bring our people like that into a state to where he can look at her and say I'm not beautiful I am NOT company but you are I will crown you with that which I chose not to resemble only inwardly but I will give you of my own attributes in so much that the world will take notice of you I will actually allow you to accede and glory over what I did when I was a human I will allow them to acknowledge you they ridicule me they make fun of me but I will be with you in such a way they will ask you for prayer when they're in diary and it is my glory upon you they ridicule me they call me Beelzebub somes 4510 hearken o daughter and consider and incline a near forget also thine own people and that father's house you see Psalms 45 is the parallel to the Song of Solomon it's the king and his love for his wife so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty for he is the Lord and worship valium so here he likens this he cons descends to the language of a natural man and woman that are a man that would be made to an attractive woman and he but related to her I desire you and I desire to be with you and I want to spend time with you and God condon sense to that level and says the king will desire thy beauty so this is my question to you where did you get that beauty you were born ugly because she was born in sin no matter how much you want to think here's something in your flesh is this and that and the other it is sin it is rotten it's no good but yet the Lord has so transformed the elect that he attributes to them a beauty which deity desires so it cannot be the perfection of humans are trying this and the human trying that and a human learning how to refrain from this and a human disciplined himself to do this and that in there that that's works does God want that from us he does but he could never look at that and attributed to something that deity itself could latch onto an order for deity to desire a beauty it must be a deity that can be able to correlate to the beauty inside the individual so it has to be from the attributes of God the very works of God himself in the lives of the chains individuals that God can say you beautiful and I desire thy beauty think other children God don't want our church we've got a nice place how thank the Lord for it don't you God don't want our church building when the rapture comes brother Phil he'll leave it right here our clothes are clean and nice thank God for that these clothes ain't going in the rapture hey there's yours you got a nice face to live thank God for that you grab a nice automobile that's nice that raptures not for automobiles and people who clothes it's for beautiful people you see this is actually the divine beauty contest except we don't strip off make it and get on television we'll learn how to sing and dance but it is the search for the most beautiful woman in the world now remember the most beautiful woman that was ever made was Eve in the Garden of Eden the conquest for the most beautiful woman in the world is still ongoing now the churches of course all claim that they're her so they got miss Baptist she entered in the contestants yes as Miss Baptist and then you got Miss Church of God and then you got miss Church of Christ and you got on and on and on and they all they're all of course saying they're the one well you're going to win this contest but the elect of God are the ones that are saying we're not worthy we can't even enter this contest I mean the world nothing about us that's any good she'll be the winner [Applause] but cozy others will present works of their hands or Psalms they can sing our buildings they have dine or programs if they've been able to accomplish but yet the length of God they come knowing that they were born in Laodicea naked and they would still be naked worried not for a road to cover their nakedness [Applause] Psalms 48 one a song and Psalm for the sons of korah great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God and the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion on the sides of the North the city of the Great King now remember Zion is always the bride you know we have a double parallel in the meaning of the scripture of course it wasn't actually Zion David remember when in and took this city Jebus before it was named Jerusalem he took it from the Jebusites it was by divine command of God of course because it was near here that job was buried it was near here that Abraham was very and the Cave of Machpelah it was here that David common bought the threshing floor of Araunah and and he was able to purchase it and he was also not just about the threshing for the sympathy you look at the amount of property when David was given the title deed the list written in the scripture and the amount of - shekels that was paid it was also a large encroachment of land and that would not only be a place for the altar to be but it would also be enhanced until what would be called the city of David notice which direction that it is it's on the sides of the north remember it was the sides of NORs that satan decide well glory it was the north side of the heaven that he started his revolt it was the size of the Norse that he said he would insult himself above the throne of God I will exalt myself and go up to the sides of the north but God said you're not getting the sides of the north you're getting the sides of the pit well praise the Lord God said the sides of the north belong to me amen so beautiful for situations so beauty them is also identified in a predestinated position by which we hold now I believe David was inspired as I'm sure you do when he went in and he conquers this city of Jamis because it was a city that had great walls and menu that had been there seen pictures of it and it was a very strategic type of place made it very difficult to be able to try to conquer it but there was a waterway on the inside unlike many of the cities around and they would have to go outside or they build in a stream so when they would come to conquer them they would be able to conquer it because they held off the water supply but on the inside of this city was a whale on the inside so that was water that run underneath the city souland they would try to capture the city and cut off their water supply that couldn't cut it all because they had a well of living water on the inside [Applause] there you go all the whales doing this and I know revival here and there and there that don't affect us we have a while of living water on the inside [Applause] there but remember it was through this hidden water canal or channel about what's David and his men were able to sneak through and by that they took the city by conquest and he could make it his capital but yet David was not remained I'll be happy with it being just like it was before so expands it to the sides of the north and then David enhances this and calls it the City of David so here this is the part now that God special of Jerusalem but God loved the City of David over his love for the main body or the original allotment of the city of Jerusalem can't you see the broad the church that God will understand he cares for the church and he will save the church but the City of David is where the Thrones are going to be now here then beautiful for situation the joy the whole earth is Mount Zion on the sides of the north the city of the Great King no one not Jerusalem itself because sign itself is separated away from Jerusalem notice again Psalms 94 17 let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us oh my goodness so God must have something about his character nature attributes or something that is beautiful let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us and establish how the work of our hands upon us yeah the work of our hands established thou it now notice this is a prayer David may not have even understood what he was praying but he had been into the presence of God and now to know that there was such Majesty and such magnificence about the presence of God and apparently been able to see a little bit of the brilliance of the light of God and David knew that there was a beauty about the Lord which mortal people had never really broke into just a few here and there and he was able to read in the law the tour of the mission and knew what Moses had been able to see and certain selected ones down through the age and he knew there was something about God that God wanted to share with these people that this man is not going to ask this unless it could be granted you believe that so it was like there was a thirst in David and there was something outside of that thirst to be able to come and meet this search so he didn't ask for gold or silver or you know something like that but he asked for the beauty of the Lord to be upon the people again Psalms 1 49 verse 4 for the Lord take us pleasure listen to this I love the scripture the Lord take us pleasure the Lord take us pleasure in oh you mean not all people now if you folks ain't careful you're going to be respect to persons then this is what the Bible says the Lord take us pleasure in his people he loves them above and beyond other people you say that ain't fair don't you set over that hypocritical attitude you hypocrite you set there and love your family more than you love anybody else in the world and you're gonna Q Scarlett doing some but you do every day of your life is it Apocrypha for you all to love your daughters and sons more than you love my daughters don't accuse God doing the same thing you do and he does it in a divine way you do it in a human right a man but the Lord now notice how they a hapa to tell you how could he see this without the baptism of the Holy Ghost to break into an understanding of God that the Lord take his pleasure Almighty God friends think ooh they're talking about we're not talking about a mortal man we're talking about Almighty God takes pleasure in his people his people actually do something to him that is able to bring him pleasure what could we give what could we do what in the world could we as mortals ever do that would give an eternal Almighty hello him puts had a need of nothing yet somehow we render him pleasure for the lord taketh pleasure and his people he will you see Jacob had 12 sons but there was only one of those 12 that he beautified with the coat of many colors he didn't make all the rough summer call but he made Joseph a beautiful goat a coat of many colors naturally I said doesn't mean anything really today but to no to the expense of how expensive that dyes were specially the Reds and the Maroons and the balloons the Blues come from a mollusk out of the sea and the Reds come from a little lady tiny brewery very rather they come off with an oak tree that was just so sparse she'd find one here and find another 100 miles away and find another 100 miles away and to see the cost that was involved and being able to make this coat of many colors why he wanted him to have such a diverse walk before him and that love and what did this coat signify it signified he was chosen above his brothers this is why they got jealous why because they was not brought I mean because they didn't have a coat of many colors and they looked at that coat of many colors and when they saw that they knew what it represented it represented a special law it represent I was so my preacher with a knight it represented the special love that their daddy had for Joseph it represented a special position that Joseph had which was above their position it signified all of the collars all of the majesty it also signified he was next in line to be the chief of the tribe and one one one out of 12 was beautified will salvation I'll tell your friends I feel so sorry for folks that don't say election it is all through the Bible everywhere we look now David said that the Lord taketh pleasure in his people that he will beautify notice he's and he will not beautify the proud it's not the rich it's not the poor that's not your identification the identification is the meek those that can humble themselves now we're told my bride material he loves them above all people that's on the earth well I'm gonna go ahead and perch it he loves his people not all mankind know not all mankind on the same level well some of you still struggle with that it you know you're under the care of this divine providence it gives them water gives them sunshine he gives them many many things and all of them will share many things when it comes to that but when it comes to being beautiful with salvation the elect of God moved into that sphere that others can only dream can I go on so it is Byron making this it is a reflection of the nature of an ornament a declaration if you will an ornament by which God puts upon the life of these individuals and it's not themselves it's not that certainly different than anybody else on the earth even any different than the rest of their brothers I mean look at Joseph what's it because his mama was matter well Benjamin come along and yet Benjamin that being of the same mother another same father yet Benjamin never received a coat Benjamin never received the position Joseph is going to have why he was chosen of God and Jacob was able to identify their choosing and then by changing his clothes or glory by changing his clothes so his clothes signified his position I cannot say it don't let the world and these bunch of stripped all the way of the sins make fun of your sisters you hang your head high as the daughter of God and realize they're blind they don't know what you're talking about those don't have nothing to do with it it sure did with Joseph it sure did but the shuttle of azure come on ships oh now the same of us in all as far as words it we're not worthy but why why are we able to walk into the fullness of the atonement on a different level than just salvation people all might there be millions and that we say well what I've done Tom that just being saved we're talking about being clothed with the garment the garment of what the representation of the mixed colors and the diversities of the attributes of God that are pulled in one corner don't you see what the Lord Jesus done for you the garment of salvation the road that's going to be placed surrounds you it is not just for healing it's not just for more money to pay your bills that's part of it sure but it contains so many of the attributes of God you've got the blue you've got the indigo you've got the red you've got the purple you've got the yellow you got the amber you've got the amethyst you've got all of these yellow Jasper that's in this it consummates the entirety of God's love in a row placed upon those of you that he has chosen to dress you up I'm telling you one thing here ain't no way in a world a woman's gonna get dressed up and nowhere to go now um in my best self sometimes for your husband and comb your hair and if you don't show up to you shouldn't look like a rag hit him up whenever he comes in the door well praise the Lord you still still shouldn't come in with the Johnny zone still got your housecoat on where you got up this morning you ought to present yourself right come on well I'm telling you one thing that sure is a lot of clothes been put on this bride she sure is getting dressed up and ready to go somewhere I'm going to God there ain't no way in the world he's dressing us up like this to go to Walmart there's no way in the world he's testing us up like this to go into a tribulation period the kind of clothes he's put on you proves you ain't going to a tribulation you are going to a marriage supper you're going to our banquet with the lamb [Applause] that's one of the reasons we have these banquets for the young people you honestly think it's these brothers that asked for this you think it's these brothers that want these tuxes or someone will dress up in tuxes and they'll do all that but who is it that really gets out Dyke down now that's a Kentucky language for really all fix that whatever y'all hear but it language is for it now these sisters go to Ross and they go to Belk and they go to Penny's and try to find one where they didn't look like a Slytherin surfing then one of them back out of it in the front out of them the arms out of it come on Saints why who made it well of course the designer made them that's why they look the way they did but yet there's something about it I'll talk about that so there's just something about sisters & Manges young sisters oh Jesus I'm going in here now some of these older sisters like to get all dressed up ain't nothing wrong as long as it's decent but can you imagine stepping out by the end and your wives got on a dress of some sort of these glittery things and all a little bit of sequins or what if you call that stuff you said where are you going Walmart you're thinking no way you're not going to Walmart looking like that Lindsay so listen friends what's been preached listen to what the servants of God are saying and you're worried about where you going listen to what the man of God addressing your hair oh my god don't tell you where you're going you hear me preaching about stole love food and digging your solar and trying to do this another of course not I'm not getting you ready for no tribulation period I getting you ready with no bunch of conspiracy theories I'm not trying to preach a bunch of black helicopters and this and that and the other I'm looking for a helicopter I'm looking for a theophany I'm not looking to dig a hole in the ground I'm looking for a hole in the sky so I can fly out of this world I'm getting dressed up [Applause] my clothes say where I'm going now y'all may not see it but I'm dressed up real fit and proper I told Matt this suit it's time this white shirt I'm talking about my soul the cost of this word that's been produced from the spun mills of the divine word given down through a prophet of God to be able to handle down and lay down on these tapes for years and years and years and the servants of God still going back and gleaning sometimes I wonder how long a word brother Branham ever kept all this stuff sometimes but Amos I look out them my goodness and wonder that man didn't blow to smithereens with all these revelations and all this word that God gave him and you've got preachers around the world still feeding on what he preached the Millennium there but if it's a thousand years from now preachers will still be preaching this message they'll still be digging things out of there and it'll be absolutely astounding why because God has provided such a wardrobe of the world and the weaving of the pattern the call is so divine by his own attributes that he can look at her and she's done and said I've said right here many a time and you've been here with me and I walk out that door was that nervous groom and the best man he's heard about the dress he knows a little bit about it I'd always look at the groom whenever I say all arrives or keep seated whichever I look at him because I know this is his first time and seeing her like this I see the fear the anxiety the excitement I said the tears and her daddy's eyes as he's walking her down the aisle and I never see that but the Greg that I don't think of the Lord Jesus that morning of the rapture what it all starts happening you changed his his garments it goes in behind those curtains as it was laid aside his bloody garments as high priest he walks out dressed as a rafter and the angels know this rapture time about that time those it's in the sixth dimension glory to God their release from the sixth dimension hang with me about the same time your theophany which you've never seen yet but you heard from and at least once it's release from beyond the curtain of time as well and here you are down on the earth you got up Monday morning it's usually whatever it was same old same hole maybe you've got a root canal appointment that day and you got up you know you've got an appointment with a lawyer an appointment with this and that is oh my goodness I dread this so bad I can't believe it and you get all of a sudden a sweep goes over you now what happens is your blood your bones you send you your muscles your help your teeth your eyes all that inside of you just became just like that change your change from immortal to mmm I'm immortal and but there's another part of you that you're fixing to join up with which is you're see awfully well glory to God hallelujah can you imagine when the great union takes place and we go to see all those saints of God and the resurrection sets in we all gather around our Lord Jesus and we get to seen for the first time with our natural eyes glorified eyes I mean we've got oh oh but can you imagine him how long have you wanted this 30 years 40 years 50 years tried 80 billion 90 billion trial who knows how many years eternity that you've longed for this can you imagine when he sees her you there be brushless himself come away my love Oh thou art now we won't all look the same some of us have brown hair and some black some red maybe some Auburn no great be none of us you know none of us with anything even blinded eyes are crippled or none of us had any attitudes and live if we get our attitude change we keep the old body it'd be pretty good this for that you realize everything about us that makes us not like other people that will go to church with all of us want to be changed from that now we'll go ahead and preach with or without trait man say I appreciate it but let's just be honest and face facts there's folks in this message that human it we just don't like being around them because they cost not that we're not brothers and sisters now but there's Christ in our human make up in our human nature there why does he say that I don't understand what he means you know why'd she say that why should she come across out there look friend that has to be changed about us if not we'll find ourselves off a little corners over in heaven and you'll find three or four over here and three or four nine four or five over that note that won't be none of that because all of the things in our humanity that make us Christ will all be gone and listen every one of us need to be changed from the preacher on down that's right because there is no perfect human makeup and yet God took all of this ma the mess that we were here and we were in the rags of sin and we were in the rags of Satan we look like a prostitute or we look like an ill-fame warmer but God said I know what I can do for her I know what I can do I can change her I can call her by her name by her real name and she'll respond from the soul I will bear sir by my word I will close her in my beauty and when I do she will take my breath away can I have a few more minutes how's their chapter 4 verse 2 in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel I said 50 to 1 awake awake put on thy strength old Sian put on thy old Jerusalem the holy city from his father shall be no more coming to thee the uncircumcised and the unclean I said 61 3 to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty I see in our Western thinking this makes no sense beauty for ashes ashes what but this was a custom for many thousands of years and still is among many of the Easterners that when a tragedy would come or the death of a loved one they would cast ashes on their heads our ashes on their face they would throw the ashes up and cover themselves in ashes so this is the way he found us in our calamity in our fears ashes was all over our face ashes all over our soul licks with our human sorrow as we had cried lamented and cry and the tears in the action I'll mix together yet ah nice mascara you look like a mess but God said this is what I want today I'm going to give you the washing of the water but the words now want you to take the water of the word and I want you to start washing your face let's start appear with your eyes first and let's go to get all this stuff off of your eyes and all for your face because you're gonna see me I don't want you to now if you look out there you still got ash water and stuff in there you may look and think there's three of me but if you keep on washing long enough you realize there's only one that's why a lot of folks still think there's two or three they still got ash water in the lives but better if you'll watch good enough you'll find out he ends the everlasting father so he said let me have your ashes let me have your streaked face what what do you want I'll take it on myself and I'll give you beauty portray you and I both know if you went to a car lock looking for a car you pull up in a

dug in the ground and human bodies put in there haven't been strong along the battlefields never even had a bearing place how much blood human blood has been spread upon the earth but God can look at her future state of his promise and say you are beautiful maybe you don't feel so beautiful tonight maybe you're having a difficult time or this or that or the other and the age the time that we're living in people generally aren't just having a difficult time with something they're having difficult times with several some things all at one time but remember he will never leave you and when the train goes to slowing down and Laodicea maybe somebody you go to college with somebody goes school is a mother or father whoever and you're Jesus comes with the reproach of the word I understand the way they modernized Jesus Jesus wouldn't even know himself could say you preach her saying tell Matt me you preach it a Jesus of your own making you understand what the majority of later sins would do for Jesus Christ to appear himself to them in his form of his word they would be ashamed of him that's why they're ashamed of us they would be so ashamed of him hey they would not want him in their church if Jesus made anybody shout or healed anybody or cast out of devil out of somebody that would so embarrass them may God help me my name is broadcast on public television or radio or newspapers I'm misunderstood the message people or whatever more when the train pulls in and Jesus the word is standing there man god help me [Music] you see he knows how that feels brother branham quotes the consequence from the Lord Jesus and he spoke there his word about the woman about the girl rather said that she's sleeping and they laughed him to scorn and he said that word meant embarrassed so Jesus felt embarrassing imagine he says you my me a little bit darker skin than us but still by the Jimmy's his cheeks flushed and he felt embarrassed if he didn't he couldn't understand you when you feel embarrassed many of y'all ever been embarrassed about certain things of the word I'll raise my hand or a threat to you line up a liar prayer line right now what does that the human part yeah we've all got that little girl in the here yes the reproach for the word the scars for the word the pain for the word that's why they over to see it loves their Jesus there's no reproach but they're

many things I love about the Lord Jesus but this is one of them it's the mysterious part about his nature I'd studied out my sermon and that pretty well thought I knew the direction I was going out I've been looking at it for days back there in the steady for I came out Lord spoke this story to me about this little girl I had looked at it and I don't in Hollow I pull it up as I begin to read it

arguing fussing this and that in the other Andy Carlos we seem to think so whenever they wanted her to write love songs and country music and whatever more she wouldn't sell out her talent to the world so the criticize her and said so how do you think you're gonna know him what if you get there and you're still blind in heaven what are you gonna do there she said I shall know you I shall know

him in water but only the Lord Jesus can be able to immerse him in His divine nature with the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh can we just worship him just a little bit Oh God we worship You Lord Jesus Thank You Heavenly Father for taking away our ashen face Lord I never was in the depths of sin as many as these folks were they could express more about the loneliness than years and years of that than I could but I've talked to enough to know getting up every day looking for some peace some satisfaction if suicide was only among the poor then we could say well it's social it's because they don't have money to pay their bills and money to indulge but yet we know movie stars the famous the rich the important people that supposedly have everything they take their lives Lord Jesus because they're longing for peace they go to bed with some medicine they get up at meds they have to take all kinds of things they've still got ashes all over them but thank you Lord Jesus when we pulled up on your lot that day wherever it was you offer this this unbelievable deal I'll take care of nature how I'll redeem you I'll save you I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost you give me your sins your past I'll totally pay it off I'll loose your lien I'll make you debt-free it seemed impossible but as the song says I sure got the best of the trade you're the only one that can make such an alpha thank you Lord Jesus I accept it I'm sure there's others in this building tonight in strained they feel the same way Lord thank you Lord Jesus those scars that you bore in your body your suffering that this beautiful life could be released that you could look at us and say thou art beautiful tears come me that's Jerusalem thank you Lord Jesus Lord if there's one here tonight or under the sound of my voice they've not been made beautiful yet they still look like a sinner my clock was dressed like one don't talk like they pull up their 69 Volkswagen as it was on this plot of eternal life may they feel the Nerds of the Holy Spirit as he walks here and says I'll trade with you how about this I'll loose you from your sins I've take away your guilt I'll never mention them to you again I'll sanctify you our failure with the Holy Ghost I'll start feeding you my world you'll get so fat you'll grow so much you'll finally outgrow your body and I'll have to give you a new body to match your soul you want to trade o God may the Holy Ghost I know this is a simple comparison Lord but may the Holy Ghost deal with every heart note i brothers baptized these people tonight father if they had not received the Holy Ghost may you come and immerse them into Jesus Christ sisters this is sister patience pageant she was baptized when she was younger and she didn't really thought she understood back then what she was what she was doing if they understand things they have only to repent you know and and take communion foot washing but but since she didn't know what what she was really doing she didn't really understand what she was walking into she wanted to revisit her first works you know she wants to take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she's doing that with with full attention and with understanding tonight she's coming to the Lord repenting of her sins yeses and she wants to take his name and not take it in vain so let's all pray together as I like it's honoring
