God let's turn to Acts chapter 2 if you would verse one certainly appreciate blessings of the Lord each of you that are here with us today different visitors that are here with us from Brother Benton's day yesterday of Celebration we're so happy for our brother God God's giv him these years of life and years to be able to serve him Acts chapter 2 verse one I've been speak speaking to you for a bit on the bride's Bill of Rights and today I'd like to start off at least with the right to have one mind now you can really know that I Believe In Miracles if I believe that the bride's ever going to have one mind but I do believe that because it's God's word acts chap 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place now let me read to you the meaning of this word the Greek word is home us o madon home us o madon and it means with one Accord with one mind with one passion now listen that was with one Accord one mind and one passion the unique Greek word used 10 of its 12 times in the New Testament occurrences in the book of Acts now listen to this further explanation of what it really means it's a compound of two words meaning to rush along and in unison to rush along and in in unison the image is musical a number of notes sounded which while different harmonize in pitch and tone so I'd like for brother Larry to demonstrate to us what some people have in their minds about themsel and the body and going to church and all of that so brother Larry is going to play for us one note for a few bars of [Music] music now that's the way some people want to serve the Lord now you've got all those keys on their piano all those strings the Beautiful music it can make and some people want to be a single note now brother Larry take both hands and spread out at least six fingers and put those notes together and make a chord I want you to listen to what the meaning of it is the image is musical a number of notes a number of notes are sounded which while different harmonize and pitch and tone now play it for [Music] us ah go [Music] [Applause] [Applause] ahead I want him preach we just let him play that for us now maybe it's just me I don't know but to me the latter one somewhat sounds so much more beautiful so much more full now they were the same notes and different pitch but they're harmonizing together so what does it take all them different fingers to make that that possible notice again in Acts chap 2 verse 2 and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire as it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak oh my goodness must have been Pentecostals wasn't it and they begin to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance Now read with me also in Romans 12: 16 be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condem sin to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits Romans 15:5 now the god of patience and consolation ation Grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus that you may be with one mind and one mouth now even though it's two different English words Accord and mind but it's exact same Greek word here that Paul is telling the Saints in Rome in Rome to be able to have that they would have one mind mind or be in one Accord and we'd let to be remembered today as we pray me too Lord Jesus as we have assembled here today Father we heard just a bit ago that sister Judy Dy had crossed over and brother Lloyd walls had requested prayer for a sister from their church and she had also passed this morning so while we were preparing to get ready to come to church to more of your children crossed over into that land beyond the river father we know that's what we're all headed toward and we believe that you've sent us a message in the last days that would help us to be ready for that hour we're asking today for your Divine help help me Jesus to get out of the way father speak through these lips of clay if there's anything of Eternal value that will come out of this service today it will certainly have to be you that does it so we commit this commit the speaker and the hearers everyone visible and invisible Lord together into your great hands have your way in this service in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask you amen God bless you you may be seated I'm sure for most of you it is the same as it is with me it's hard to imagine living in a world that was a paradise to where everything was in complete Harmony there was no dissension no division no one arguing fussing debating over difference of opinions and there was no difference at all in the sense of controversial difference such a Harmony that was existing in the Gard Garden of Eden and yet we don't know exactly how long that it lasted but we are certain of this it will be restored again and it will last forever but since that that fall of what man forfeited for all of us in the Garden of Eden we are striving to have a real Oneness back and God of course first established a Oneness in the hearts of his people by his death on Calvary that would be able to bring back in us the divine nature that we had lost in the Garden of Eden when we were at one time one with God so man was one with God he was one with his wife he was one with nature he was one with all the creation everything existed in a a beautiful wonderful Harmony but since then man has struggled Nations have struggled and are struggling today our nation is probably more divided today than it has been in many many years it's divided politically it's divided racially it's divided culturally anybody even know what the word means on our money ausum anybody know what that means in Latin airus Blum one of many so with many coming together different cultures different races we would blend together to be one nationality as far as Americans but yet in reality our nation is so far away from even what's written on our currency every day that we handle out and we buy this and that and the other many don't even what it means as far as on the bill itself and they certainly don't know what it means as far as principle that we would be able to have one nation under God which is the problem because when America turned God away we lost all hopes of ever having a true Unity anyway is that right and then we know that Satan doesn't just want to do that um nationally but he wants to do it in the church and we will have to say that he's been able to accomplish exactly what he set out to do but we know also that God had purpose to be able to have a restored unity in the hearts of his people it may seem to us that we are a million miles from True Unity because even inside of our own ranks of and and let's just look at Christianity in a global thing we look at it and we see that Christianity as a whole it's so divided so many different denominations so many different views so many different uh schools of Theology and so many that well if you don't believe the way we do you're not right you're not going and this denomination they're the only ones going the other denomination they're the only ones going and then we bring it on down a little closer to us and we realize that very same divisive Spirit has got in our own ranks as well and we know it started out to where that on the day of Pentecost they were waiting and waiting and the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come I remember Pentecost did not begin in Acts 2 the word actually means an end Gathering or it was a FES Festival of the Harvest and it had been something that they had celebrated for years and years but it just so happened that God chose to send the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost so whenever the spirit of God began to move and they were there waiting and praying and waiting and praying and the prophet dramatizes it a little bit for us and said they were saying well you know what I believe we've already got it another one said no no we've got to do this and that another one said no we got to do this but he said Peter stood up and said now Brothers the word has got something to say about this that Jesus told us it would come on a certain day so they had to wait and wait the concept that I grew up in as a Pentecostal that you had to te and you had to wait for the Holy Ghost totally wrong of course according to the Scripture it wasn't that they had to wait for the spirit of God to come as far as well you know you just beat on the Altar and beat on the altar but there was a certain day of arrival because it was timed according to the way that the Pascal lamb was offered and then there would be so many days to another Feast which is the Feast of the end Gathering or the Feast of Pentecost but we do not have to T in the day we're living for a certain day for 10 days 14 days is that right whenever we can get out of the way and die that's when God wants to give us the Holy Ghost but it was actually set to come on this certain day and they must have had difference of opinions because to be honest let's give them the benefit of the doubt the Lord Jesus had slowly begun to unveil what the spirit of truth would be but he still didn't explain to them what the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be like John said there's one among you and he said I'm not even worried to unloose your shoes I baptize you with water but he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire but he still didn't go into any detail what does that mean exactly John John might not have known himself since he got it before he was ever born so he wasn't even conscious of it so to explain the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've not found no scriptures in the four gospels where it actually said well it'll be this way and that way and that way it's just like he said it's coming be ready be open and whenever it gets there you'll know you've got it so they really didn't know what to look for they didn't know if it would be an outburst of Joy now the Bible did not tell them it was going to be a Russian Mighty Wind Jesus never told them that y'all are going to be sitting in one place and the wind will come down but he said just go Terry in Jerusalem until you be a dude with power from on high so no doubt it took them a little bit of time because a lot of the men that were there were preachers and natur the more preachers you get together the more different confusion you can have sometimes and the more difference of opinion that you can have not always but yet we're all made different and and when you once you look at the diversity of God God did remain ever even one one of his preachers that that'd always be exactly the same but there is a Oneness that I believe before we leave this world in a Rapture every member of the bride of Christ will have now does that mean every one of us will start saying the exact same thing and we'll all worship with the exact same element of of of emotion and all that no I do not believe that for one minute I don't believe we can prove that by the Bible but I do believe we can all have one passion and we can ultimately have one desire and that desired is to be ready and to get every member whose name is on that book of life into the economy of God is that right and will we have other interests of course we will will we have even other Passions we will but they will not be the majority of the drive that's in our soul some of you are business people and you will always be thinking about different ways to do this or that the musicians we have in our church and the songs that the singers sing they will always be listening for new songs and they'll be finding new progressions and the chords and the brothers will be practicing this and that that's just something about human beings and will we ever be always be the same in that sense never but I believe with all of my heart God will have a people on this Earth around the world that will have the same drive the same goals the same passion the same baptism of the Holy Ghost they're not interested in building any man's Kingdom they're not interested in making this one preacher the great big guy Among Us and everybody else is nobody nope I don't believe we'll ever get to that spot but we will be at that spot to where we know that there is one great big one Among Us and his name is the Lord Jesus it's not any other preacher it's not any other man you believe that as well now Paul knew he was not there of course on the day of Pentecost but Paul knew and no doubt he had been told about it from the different Brethren and once he had his own experience with God he had experienced a Oneness now remember he was totally different than the rest of all the brothers his experience was a little bit different the Bible doesn't say that whenever Paul met him on the way to Damascus that there was a rushing Mighty Wind so the rushing Mighty Wind is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost but a changed life is a life that follows the word so there was no rushing Mighty Wind in any of the other instances that I found in the book of Acts yet there was tongues there was prophecy and there was different things like that so God never chose the wind to be the definite evidence of the Holy Ghost he never chose shouting to be the definite evidence he never chose running and yet we believe in all of those things but we know that God dealt with his people in such a way that it must have changed them where they all found them themselves wanting some of the same things about the kingdom of God and it must have been totally overwhelming when Satan saw what God did because he had been among the 12 the disciples and he had heard them arguing which one is going to be the greatest now which one of us is going to be able to sit on your right hand side and which one's on your left and which one's the second you know down and the third down he had heard them arguing and debating about that and got among them and anointed them of course and whenever he saw that disappear from among them same men that had it before he must have been in total bewilderment trying to understand what in the world happened to them are not these the same guys that was arguing about who have the biggest Ministry and who have the most that streamed them on YouTube that's the way we'd say it today and how many have the devot the most followers and how many countries will stream your services versus how many stream ours well when you hear that kind of talk you know you're listening to in and need the Holy Ghost I don't care if they've been preaching for 75 years once we get the true mind of Christ we realize it's not how big we are it's not how big our church is it's not how many people that we reach it's about us all getting together and we can single out that one note if we want to or we can put all of it together and play chords and let it be a beautiful harmonious orch minist that God himself ordained before the foundation of the world it must have been beautiful when the first church started out was such a thing and they found themselves in such commonality that what they did was the rich so what they had and they just had a common purse and they begin to delve It Out Among the people it must have been beautiful but you know what Satan saw that and he decided there ain't no way I'm going to let this go so he started bringing in division and started out maybe in a very small way but we see by the time it rolls on down into the Third Church age that they had so divided and split among themselves I find the same thing among us today I say it I with sadness in my heart but yet I really believe in spite of all of that that God is going to bring the real bride of Christ back to that true Oneness that fell on the day of Pentecost itself to where there were would be preachers all over the Earth and this would be the miraculous part about it many of them will not even know each other and that will be a wonderful thing but what will even be greater than that is some of them will know each other and they will know how they disagree with each other and they still will have one common goal now that is a miracle because they know well I differ with brother so and so on this and I differ with that but in reality when we all sit down and if we've all got the whole Holy Ghost and we've all got one passion and one desire and one main goal and one main achievement don't we really agree on more than we disagree on now we might shout a different way and some might do this and some's music you know they might just play all the old hymns and they don't want no new stuff and there'll always be those things among us but in reality whenever we sit down and I love to have fellowship with Brethren to when you can go to talking about the good things of God and you'll you know one will pull out a little quote and he's got a little agenda behind that and another one will pull out a little quote and he's got a little point he's trying to make and you know whenever you realize well they don't want to go that way they don't want to go on this agender that narrative and you get right back to the mainstream it's absolutely awesome let me say that about you visors you pardon me for a moment but our church here I wonder what God could do among us if we ourselves as Word of Life if we would hone down and focus on really what matters in life and when it comes right down to it it's not how many cars you've got how many trucks you've got how much money you've got how much money you're going to leave for your kids to fuss about when you're gone but it's actually going to amount to our calling God and what God ordained us to do and what God ordained us to be and US letting our light shine I wonder if we wouldn't find that we're in more agreement M than what we actually disagree on I wonder if everyone who claims this church to be your home church if we could leave this place today and desire to have one mind cuz this is your right now it's up to you whether or not you get it it's up to me whether or not I get it and I've done found out you know many many years ago in order to have one mind you're going to have to give up some things you're actually going to have to relinquish some things that might be what you think is a value but when you look at the True Value and you let the True Value outweigh the others many of you have heard me tell it and I tell it sometimes when every mid car will be out and we have six granddaughters as as most of you'all know three sets of twins so we bought lots of girls clothes and we' bought lots of girls little tits and lots of girls this and that and the other so years ago we was at TJ Maxx and this woman kept seeing us come in there buying two of this and two of that to is something else so she asked me the question one day don't you ever get anything so I said Well ma'am actually when we got married how many ever years ago it was then that I told her that it's been 50 now it'll be 51 in July and I told her you know whenever we got married say 40 45 years ago whatever it was we decided that everything was going to be 5050 $50 for her 50 cents for me I'm surprised your sisters didn't say amen and your brothers hoping and praying to God they don't right but whenever you look at it and you realize even in your home now those of you that are married and you know that peace is a wonderful thing but to be able to attain peace in your home you're going to have to give up some things and there may be days that you're actually right in your side of the argument but then you go to way being right versus losing three days of peace in your your home now you single folks will catch this by and by when the morning comes and when you wake up and realize you got married you realize what I'm talking about today you're looking at me funny but all these married folks have got that little smirky grin because they've done been there and done that and you realize peace is a great thing and it's the same way when it comes to us as the family of God but many people that it's not peace that matters it's their own way and they're right and it don't make no difference what they've got to do to hold on to it they're going to hold on to it I person feel sorry for people like that because they will never have very much of what God wants them to have because it's all self centered it's about me and Mine and Ours and our church and our family and what I believe and what I but you know what when you look at it according to the word you realize one mind is only achievable when we can all have one father one nature and one birth now I'm the oldest of seven kids all my siblings are totally different from me Carol is the oldest of eight all of her siblings are totally different from her and it's the same way in the family of God that we said here today and we come from different colors different racial backgrounds different cultural backgrounds and we have things that have molded us and made us to what we are some of us are more emotional than others some of you cry a lot some of you shout a lot some of you pout a lot well Glory some of you don't make a whole lot of emotion in church but you give all your emotion to volleyball and basketball and baseball I don't understand that kind of experience myself my God Is Bigger Than a piece of pig skin kicked around at a 50 yard line my God Is Bigger Than Michael Jackson or some other star out there dribbling down the court my God is a resurrection and a life and I've always wanted to praise him and serve him but I've come to realize God don't want me to make people that will be like me God wants me to help mold into them what he wants them to be not what I think they should be somebody say amen and you see one of the worst mistakes we make is whenever we get this image in our mind of this one particular person or that's the perfect Christian right there and then we go to trying to make everybody else just like them well God does not agree with that concept now let's go on if you would whenever Paul went to 1 Corinthians chap 1: 10 and he said now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing wow Paul believed in Miracles too that you all speak the same thing now this this is our right this is our right that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind now again same English word but certainly not the same Greek word so this again is newos which is understanding the high powers of the soul the faculty of perceiving divine things this is the only way this will ever be attainable is for every true Born Again Holy Ghost filled child of God to have the same newos well whose newos will it be it won't be mine and it won't be yours it'll have to be the mind of God so then God projects in us his own mind mind which is his own will now you remember when the spirit of God spoke to the prophet and he said pick up your pen and write and he said here is the secret that the bride has the word but she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word so we could all have the word and yet have hundreds of different opinions on what God done wants done with his word we do that's why we have such divisions Among Us so some would pick out certain quotes and they would say well this is the emphasis right here this is the bride's Revival and boy we've had so many so-called bride revivals and so they begin to focus on this Gathering of quotes and they say this is it right here oh everybody around the world this is what we all rally around and you see most of them wind up where they started following a man CU every one of them started with some man's idea and then they wind up gathering around a man then that man will have to go out to promote this idea and then churches will start following him and in time you'll find the exact same cycle that it's always been it dwindles down and it blows away and then you find them looking for another man well I don't know about you I found the man that I have been looking for a long time ago I thank God for every man of God but I'm not looking for any man to bring me a Revival in his briefcase I'm not looking I'm I don't know about you folks I'm not waiting to our special meeting in the last week of June to be able to have a good time I'm here today you're here today God's here today I say we have church I say we have church believe it or not it's a special meeting right here today because God has gathered here with the saints of God in the house of God and if we could bring our mind together in one Accord I wonder what God would do as a matter of fact I found it and studying this that the prophet said if everybody in this place would come together together in one mind and one Accord in five minutes time there would not be one sick person left Among Us in five minutes time and we're waiting on God and God is waiting on us but if Satan can sideline us and get us on a little agenda to where we begin to wait to hear the preacher with our certain cliches and our certain magic words you know what I'm talking about and we're waiting and we'll see what quotes that he reads and if he goes to say an Irish certain words then we know he's on board with us well what you mean is he's on board with your idea and then I wonder how much that we all so miss the moving of the Holy Ghost and people come in Bound and leave bound they come in sick and they leave sick they come in miserable and leave more miserable I don't think that's what God has in mind for church can anybody say amen I believe the Lord Jesus is here to heal the sick today I believe is here to fill with the Holy Ghost and if you're lost I believe he's here to save you right here today you can walk out of this place a brand new man or a new woman if we can come together in one mind and one accord or you can sit there in your chair and just plink on your little notes and you can go on and on over and over again or you can be able to get together with this one and with that one and with that one and with that one and with that one and with that one and depending on how long your fingers are you might be able to even go beyond six and then if you put them together with another and another and another what could God do I'll tell you what he's fixing to do he's fixing to raise the dead he's fixing to bring back limbs that have been missing these ain't my words before the bride goes home in a Rapture I believe that short quick work will be and there will be people who's got armed arms that are gone that will be recreated again don't you understand what that is it's a forerunner of the Resurrection Hallelujah there may be people that's bound with diabetes for years and somebody that's missing an eye and if God could get us together not following this man not following that man following this one up here we love one another we're striving together for one common cause let God be the preeminent one let us get out of the way let us get out of the picture and let's see what he will do Among Us oh my that you be perfectly joined together you know Paul was such a diverse man and very very educated man he would use examples of warfare and he would use examples in so many ways and these these words right here he's using examples of actually building and he's using the example of a man that would tank and the way they would do it in their day and join boards together and they would take a Tenon and they would put it together so he was laying it out that that's exactly what God wants that we would be perfectly joined together now you can't see it of course but this pull pit made by one of the brothers here in the church and here's one board here's another here's another here's another here's another and they're all put together joined perfectly together yet I run my hand across it and I don't feel one board and another board and another board because they were joined together then run through a planer and they make one beautiful image oh when God can get us out of the way and our own little petty ideas of this and that and the other and join with this brother and that sister and this brother and that sister and God run us through the Divide machine look out devil here we come you talking about a church that will stand in the last day and then we will be able to say I and my father are one not only will we say that but we will say I and my brother are one oh yes we disagree we may not agree on this little point and that little point but God is going to have a people together on the earth before the Rapture time who will be in one objective and one passion and one main desire of their life and what's that for to fulfill the word of God for our age I don't want to just quote the Bible I don't want to just quote the message I want to be the Bible I want to be an expression of God's word oh my notice that you be perfectly joined together other in the same mind recognizing goodness and hating evil the power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially that you be of the same mind in the same judgment 2 Corinthians 13:11 finally Brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of how many Minds one mind same English word but here a different Greek word as well fro to have an opinion of on self to think of oneself to be modest not let one's opinion though just of himself exceed the bounds [Music] of modesty wow so when Paul is telling them to have one mind this man's speaking about several diverse things isn't he so you've got to think the same thing of the cause of God and the purpose of God and then you have to look at yourself and not think boy I'm something man I'll tell you what I'm boy can I sing woo boy I can sing but boy I can play the guitar boy I can play that organ boy I'll tell you one thing am I a preacher or what you see a person who has that mind of themsel will never truly be able to be one with other people unless those other people are constantly flattering him oh Jesus you're going to get me in trouble now sir notice in Philippians 1: 27 only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ so whether I come and see you or else be absent that I may hear of your Affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the Fai of the Gospel one Spirit one mind stve together now we say that we have been restored to the fa of the original Apostolic fathers have we we have one striving one face Philippians 2:2 fulfill you my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife contention electioneering or intriguing for office oh wow so you mean politics is in the church so there were actually politicians in the first church age and they were electioneering for positions in the church oh Jesus so don't let anything be done in Strife electioneering or intriguing for office a desire to put oneself forward a partisan and fractu spirit which does not disdain low arts in other words they will go to whatever means possible to get a position no wonder the prophet said politics is of the devil well let me just tell you not just the kind in the white house but in the church house Amen brother Donnie oh my my notice he says in Strife or vain Glory vain Glory groundless selfesteem empty Pride a vain opinion but if loneliness of Mind Let each esteem Lotus others better than himself help us Lord help us Lord loneliness of mine now Paul's given us the key to be able to gain what is right Yul ours but we'll have to fight for it of course 1 Peter 3 and8 finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous 1 Peter 4:1 for as much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh hath ceased from sin now let's turn in Psalm 133 ver1 same train of salt but a different word now Unity how many believes we need Unity if we ever had it before now I know you know it friends but Satan is trying his best to come among the people of God like never before not only in the church family but in between husbands and wives in between parents and children in between the youth Satan is trying to divide among our ranks to where certain youth youth leaders are projecting certain things and other church leaders are saying no we're not sending our youth to them meetings no more if they're going that way don't you see who the author of all of that is it's the devil and I believe with all of my heart that for the majority of the men that I know anyway the majority of them want the same thing they desire the same thing they want people to be closer to God they want people to be filled with the Holy Ghost but if Satan can sideline us and we go to majoring on a minor I don't care what the minor is and Satan don't either as long as you go to majoring on it you're going to mess up the program of God but if we could say okay well we disagree on this and that but can't we agree on the blood of Jesus saves us can't we agree on sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and would say yes there's so much we agree on but we tend to focus more so on what we disagree on than what we agree on I'm reminded of gono whenever he was on the train and they were sending him down to Florida and removing him because our government made a treaty with him and they lied to him as most white men speak with forked tongue and whenever they did that and they lied to them and then there were the scouts which had actually worked for the federal government and they were the Apache Indians and whenever they got them and then they took their rank away from them they took their arms away from them and they throw them right on the same train and made them prisoners just like they did Geronimo and his band and the some of those men they absolutely hated those trackers they hated them because them Apaches LED them to their secret secet hideout in the cheras and in the desert Southwest so some of those men looked at them and they hated them but jono looked and he talked to his brothers and he said there are so few of us left there are so few of us left let us try to be able to get along and you think here is a man that looks at his culture they had lived there for hundreds and hundreds of years his land taken away from it by the White people and the prophet said the white man is the Renegade and as a white man I can say that because I was but I ain't no more I'm a saved white man what about the rest of you white folks oh well just tell you now the Renegade runs in the white culture so we think somehow we're Superior you ain't Superior just CU your Skin's lighter than somebody else you're as lost as lost can be till you find Jesus come on somebody say Amen but yet here they were they lost their wives they lost their children and now they're still arguing you done this you done that but jono being a real leader he realized they needed one another more than they ever had before let me tell you this we are losing in our ranks every day every day they're being called across the river and people are Falling Away I believe we need one another now more than ever before we ought to be determined that we are not going to allow the devil to divide us you think we're going to have one special section in heaven where only Word of Life Church lives where only Word of Life Saints live so you can live down Glory Avenue where it joins together with faith Avenue and Temperance Avenue and then somebody else from another church lives down another Avenue there ain't going to be no divisions in Heaven There ain't going to be no where you can't live and come on somebody I believe the real bride of Christ the prophet tells us before she gets ready to leave this world in a Rapture she will be like those people were that he saw in the sixth Dimension and what did that voice tell him that was there he said this is what you preached was perfect love this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost were they different yes they were different did they have different backgrounds yes they did but they had one Christ they had one common goal they had one main passion of their life and that is to let their light so shine before men that men might see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven they desire to fulfill his word they desire to be able to reach out to the law come on preach with me this morning even if they don't go to our church I'm willing to pray for any man any woman any boy any girl if I can lead them to Christ even if they never darken this church door and they're not bride if I can lead them to the Lord Jesus and they wind up being a foolish virgin I will be identified with that person for eternity Hallelujah if I can lay my hands on somebody I don't care if they got bobbed hair I don't care if they got makeup on I don't care if they ain't even dress right if I can lay hands on them and let Jesus heal them it might be the bait that'll bring them to the word of God let's reach out let's love let's show Mercy let's show passion let's show the grace of God that's what we're called to [Applause] do wa Psalm 1331 a song of degrees of David behold how good and pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together and unity anybody know historically the time frame when this particular Psalm is written let me tell you there's been a civil war in Israel between the house of Saul and the House of David that Civil War has now finally been settled and the tribes are gathering under the Hedge ship of God's choice of being king and the spirit of God moves upon David's heart and he pins this Psalm Psalm 133 as he looks out and he sees from his Capital City the tribes harmonizing together instead of being Amazing Grace it's amaz s gra and he looks across the land and he sees the people of God coming together for what God called them to do and he says how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like to Precious ointment Glory upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron beard that went down to the skirts of his garments now that would be such a peculiar way for us to look at this about Unity now the composition of this oil that he's referring to how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like to Precious ointment so he says the precious ointment that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard so he's talking about the Holy anointing oil which was a composition of listen to this now sweet cinnamon sweet calamus cassia liia and olive oil 1 2 3 4 five five elements or can I say fivefold so you pour in a little bit of Pastor and a little bit of evangelist and a little bit of teacher and a little bit of prophet and a little bit of evangelist and you got sweet anointing oil Hallelujah now remember this was sacred this smell could not be among the the the Ley the only person that could wear this was the chosen anointed ones of God so David looks at this of what God has now done that the body has finally come in to a Unison because with these two leaders so-called it was dividing the body of God it was dividing them whose side you are I'm on salsa oh you unbeliever I'll tell you one thing who I'm on David's side while the Lord sent the prophet Samuel over to David well he also sent him over to S I'll tell you one thing I'm still sending over well I'm on this side I'm on that side the devil said glory to God I can go down in hell and eat a moon pie and drink an RC I don't even have to do nothing with these people they're just fighting one another ain't it ashame that preachers do the same thing they get up in the pull pit and they blast this guy and blast that guy and I know some need to be blasted but instead of following the leading of the Holy Ghost well we've got to fix this and fix that you know what if we get anointed with this true anointing from the presence of God God leads us to deal with something let's deal with it and move on let's deal with it and move on there's more to the gospel friend there's more to eating the lamb than just the head when they had to eat the lamb they had to eat the whole thing you got to take the leg and you got to take the head and you got to take the neck and you got to take the rest of the body that's the way Christ the word is I don't want just healing I don't want just predestination I want election I want sanctification I want baptism of the Holy Ghost I want the placing of a son I want the whole L to [Applause] you now remember these ingredients were given to the Apothecary God was the one that gave them the exact ratio now if the Apo carry would have preferred a little bit of cinnamon more than cassia he could have totally altered the smell of the anointing oil yet he could have said I'm saying I'm I've got exactly what the prophet of God said Hallelujah but what he didn't say was that he kept majoring on a minor so if God gave them and said now tell what I want you to do this so I want you to mix in I want you to mix a tablespoon of sweet cinnamon and I want you to have a tablespoon and a half of sweet cassum and they don't want you to have a half a teaspoon of olive oil cuz a little goes along long way and then they said well I I've took every word glory to God I've studied this out I'll tell you one thing well maybe they did but it was just the ratio the ratio and then when they go to anointing the people with it and the people come up and they go to anoint them because that's what the preacher is doing he's anointing the people and is throwing that Holy oil right out on the people and the people's sharing it but the ratio don't match the original word and they go now we don't believe in gifts here at our church we don't believe in no emotion at our church ah your preacher mixed up the ratio didn't it am well come on somebody well glory to God I'll tell you one thing we believe in the gifts more than we believe in heer we believe what we're really focusing on that that's not the correct ratio now notice how it comes once it's all mixed together and then shake it all up together don't worry I'm not going to open it ain't that dumb I think it blow up like a time bomb wouldn't it then you say come here now so he take the lid off you and no and Aaron and the rest the priest now want you notice they didn't sprinkle them they didn't sprinkle them but there was enough oil to it run from the top of their head down their face on their beard and dripped off the beard to the skirt skrt it's not like you women wearing skirts but it's a Hebrew word which actually means the opening of the bottom garment so it would have been like the waistline so the oil comes right down their hair down on their face right down on their beard and was running down on their body remember over the urum Thum which had the names of the tribes you see God wants a priesthood preachers that are so anointed from the presence of God that when they come out from the presence of the Lord the anointing will start running down over the congregation it'll come down over their names and then they become oh Hallelujah they also become anointed because that man has been in the presence of the Lord oh God give us men like that give us song leaders like that give us people like that to say God we need your anointing to live in this [Applause] day as the doe of Hermon wow the Dew of Hermon and as the D that descended upon the mountains of Zion now here we're still talking about brothers dwelling together in this Unity now for us do means something totally different than them I if you've ever studied on do or not it's part of the abrahamic Covenant which begins in the Book of Genesis it was part of the patriarchal blessing whenever they lay their hands on their sons and they'd say may you have the Dew from heaven now to us it means a different thing because of where we live here in Tennessee we got all kinds of rains right but there in Palestine they didn't and still don't so do was a sign of the blessings of God that it amazing oh how we love rain you ever noticed how loud rain can be but have you ever noticed how quiet do is I love rain W Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah but boy I love that dud too don't you love them due drops from heaven where they just come down and they just appear and you don't know exactly even where they come from but all you know is you walk out of church soaking wet you didn't run you didn't jump you didn't shout and you say well Lord I I don't guess I got nothing out of service and you walk out of there and you feel like you weigh five pounds heavier than you did before and you're walking out and say praise God I feel refreshed it was due brother Johnson you know some of the ancient Travelers wrote about the D of Hermon and they say even to this day of course it's one of the very few places in in in Israel to where they actually get snow I saw a picture of the day video which part of the northern part there elevation pretty high and whenever these Travelers would travel through there they would have to absolutely waterproof their tents because whenever they would come out in the morning it was as if though it had rained all night long and there was no Thunder going on there was no lightning going on there was nobody jumping or nobody shouting now we believe in all that I love rain but I love Dew don't you I love the Dew drops of mercy so bright sometimes to be honest with you I don't need a thunderstorm sometimes I just need a calm drenching from the does of Hermon to where something just pulls your soul in the presence of God and then hard no noise going on and there ain't hardly no shouting going on and you're sitting there in the presence of God and you just get up to walk out and you just say glory to God and your clothes are just drenched your soul is drenched what is it it's the due of the abrahamic Covenant he's going to be there when you need him in them storms thank God for them Pentecostal storms but thank God you know what the word there means it's the Mist in the night that's what the do is the Mist in the night thank you Lord thank you Lord sometimes when you're all tore up a thunderstorm will scare even worse but when you're in the middle of your night maybe some of you there today you're going through the offest time in your life and you don't know what to do and you're praying for God to move and you're listening you're listen oh my I'm listening for the Thunder I'm waiting for the lightning and God may not choose out at all God they catch you right here in this service today and let the DU drops for Mercy start dropping right down on your soul and lift you out of that darkness and when you wake up in the morning you realize the DW from Hermon as the D of Hermon as the DW that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more if Ephesians 4:2 with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling verse 11 and he gave some sweet cinnamon and some calamus and some olive oil Glory Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ [Music] till Paul gave us the time frame when we would no longer need preaches want to know when it is till we all come in the unity of the faith oh brother Donnie that's why we just play tapes cuz all the tape people believe the same thing apparently you ain't talked to very many of them I ain't found very many believe the same thing there is divided they a't even got no preacher leading them they got businessmen so a lot of them's got they're as divided and split as they can be don't sit there and look at me and say well that's the answer that is not the answer God could have had the tape recorder invented 2,000 years ago he could have had Paul's voice recorded if that's what he wanted he start started it out with low down sorry rotten human beings that he filled with the Holy Ghost and called them to be Apostles and Prophets and evangelist and pastors and teachers but brother Donnie they have mistakes they match you why in the world would you want a perfect Pastor I wouldn't even fit with you all if I was a perfect Pastor what in the world would I want with a perfect prophet he wouldn't line up in me cuz I ain't perfect but I needed a man that was like I was I needed a savior that would become like I a savior that did not come as a God but come as a [Applause] man till we all come in the unity of the face and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ let me say this in closing if almighty God does not accomplish this verse how can I have any confidence in Malachi for if he can't fulfill EP fasions for but I ain't the least bit worried about it are you anybody here today nervous that this scripture ain't going to be fulfilled it's going to be fulfilled my brother and sister it'll be one of the greatest Miracles that has ever swept the Earth's after the fall that God will bring preachers around the world into the unity of the faith many of them have been through this and that and the other and they've learned and they've corrected and you know we we've all been that way but well you don't just judge them by what they were you look and see what their motives are now what are they trying to accomplish and God will sweep the Earth with one mind can you imagine then every member of the Bride around the world will have one mind so God from the throne room projects one thought today is Rapture Day everybody with that same mind will think the same thought praise the Lord praise the Lord let's Stand Together praise the Lord so we not only want the mind of Christ but we want to have the same mind as our brothers and sisters sisters as long as they have the right mind thank you Lord so how will God ever accomplish such a thing I don't want you to think me weird but I've been looking about people who have transplants heart liver things like that and I found so interesting I've been asked questions along them lines over the years actually people want to know it would be okay to have a heart transplant is that were you so you know all that but I never looked at it like I have in the last bit and what I found was so amazing was that a percentage of people who would have a liver transplant more so the heart but when they would get someone else's heart they would actually start having memories and one example I'll share with you this morning was an an 8-year-old girl that needed a heart a 10-year-old girl got murdered and they took her heart and put it inside this body of this 8-year-old girl this 8-year-old girl started having nightmares and dreams that someone was after her and she saw the face of this man and the clothes he was wearing and as they started researching it and she was so troubled she could not get away from it so I actually they got the law involved in it and through the dreams of this girl with this transplanted heart they actually found the murderer of that 10-year-old girl from the memory that was Resto restored started rather in that heart she received another one her appetite was changed of things that she like to eat I mean there's one story after another after another I find that very interesting but what I find more interesting than that is and what the scientists have said for years and years is the only part that can remember in your body is your brain but now they're having to rethink this thinking that in your cells cellular memory and also DNA memory and mRNA memory that they're saying it's stored not only in your brain but in your organs so I began to think well if somebody would get somebody else's heart and it would change their appetite so a woman got an A a heart and whenever she come out of the heart surgery and she got well she started wanting beer she never drank beer in her life but she wanted beer with chicken nuggets I mean it really puzzled her she she hated beer but she started loving beer and chicken nug she had to have her chicken nuggets with her beer through much research she found out she received the heart of an 18-year-old boy you guessed it his favorite food beer and chicken nuggets so me in my mind I begin to think okay so if that could be so in a human body it ain't no wonder he had to come to the Earth and give us his heart and then he would take out our old Stony heart as he said in the Book of Ezekiel that he would do and give us his heart then it would change our desires one woman which was a devout lesbian did not like men a devout lesbian got a heart transplant but when she woke up she didn't like women no more met a man fell in love with a man got married had children I said yep my Jesus will do the same thing [Applause] [Laughter] today so they found some of these people remembering things that they had never experienced but they go to studying the lives of some of these people that had donated their hearts and they was having recall of the life of someone else so again I think okay so whenever I'm sitting there and I'm hearing a prophet or some other preacher preach about I was in God's mind before the foundation of the world and there's a part of me that says glory to God what is it he changed my heart and gave me an identity with with him aren't you glad brother Ry aren't you glad Saints so that if that is true and this is his word though will not he project to us this desire for a Unison in our church body in our families in our homes in our fellowship with other churches around the world why because we've all got the same heart from the same donor so the donor's heart changes what we eat and then we actually start thinking his thoughts so whenever we hear the preacher stand up and read the quote and fure home that he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him him down to be Jesus then we have no problem within our minds going back and thinking yeah and then when I come to the earth I was transmitted too I was a thought I've received his donor heart and his donor mind and it helps me to think like him let's B this together Lord Jesus heavenly father as we stand here today we're asking you Lord that you'd help us science say that they're going to have to rewrite some of their textbooks on these things that I've spoke about today I've read some of them years ago and I was just bewildered by it to be honest but as they've researched more and more in the last few years and started putting it all together they're finding that it's true oh Lord God what a wretched miserable condition that we were in we were in need of a heart transplant for our heart was filled with sin wretched and vow you pulled us up into the surgery room might have been a church altar it might have been in in a barn lot somewhere you opened us up took that old vow nature out and put a portion of your own hearted us when we woke up we started wanting food that we hadn't liked before food on election and food on Holiness food on forgiveness food on Mercy we started thinking of things that we' never thought of before that we were in your mind before the foundation of the world and when we hear the prophet say that we were part of those angels that did not fall in the beginning our dare say there's not a person here today that's born again and filled with the Holy Ghost that when a preacher goes to preaching and that they find a part of thems roaming out in that invisible World hallelujah hallelujah it's the deposit from you Lord Jesus if there's one here today or many they tried to be a Chris they've tried to do what's right but they've done it without a heart transplant Jesus they don't have to come to the altar I'll certainly pray with them if they choose to but they can stand right there at their seat and open up their heart and let you perform a heart transplant unlike when science started doing it years ago and those who was able to live was so few until they begin to develop drugs of anti-rejection they deemed it was not worth it to even do it but you once you share your heart with someone and it goes down into their soul you've never lost a case all of yours have a 100% survival rate they don't live 10 years or 15 years they will live for eternity hallelujah oh Jesus may your spirit go Among Us here today father if there's any that's sick any that needs the Holy Ghost Lord maybe there's some here today that needs a good shower they just need a good dose of a good heavy rain there may be some others that just need some do lord they're in such a troubled spot Thunder would frighten them like would work on their nerves but may the DW from Hermon so saturate our souls here today Father oh
