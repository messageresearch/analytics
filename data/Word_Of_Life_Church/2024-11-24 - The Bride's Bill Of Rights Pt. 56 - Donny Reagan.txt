and the Thunder open up my eyes don't let me miss the glory [Music] [Applause] Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth now what we realize about our God is he's expressed in such greatness but he hides it by the Simplicity that expresses it in so Moses when he writes this in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and you would think that there would be something about both of them that would be the same size what would be the comparison between the Heaven and the Earth let's show them brothers let's look at something here that it's called the p Blue Dot taken February the 14th 1990 from voer one space probe as it goes out to Adventure out and see what could be found is an approximate distance of 3.7 billion miles and most all of us some of kids were of course but most all of us are right there on that dot so God created the Heaven and the dot you know in our minds we think why would you even put a dot in the same verse as an expanse of a universe which they don't even measure by m anymore but what they call Parasect so it's so far beyond miles they had to come up with new words to be able to know how to measure it so God made the heavens and the blue dot and the blue dot the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light not stars or moons but day God called the light day and the Darkness he called night now what I find amazing is this is in the beginning but when we come back into the Eighth Day and the city you're going to move into there was no night there so you see when God in the beginning started bringing this into view there was something then that wasn't in eternity there was no night so when we come back into that Eighth Day and John looked and he saw it and he said there was no night there so night is only for time amen just like sometimes our spiritual nights aren't you glad there's a morning coming when there is no more night and the evening and the morning were the first day Genesis CH 2 verse 4 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth Generations look at what that word means descendants proceedings genealogies a genealogical list of ones descendants begetting account of Heaven in a metaphorical sense so these are the generations of the heavens and the Earths so it would be like my grandfather begot Don Reagan Don Reagan begot Donnie Reagan Donnie Reagan begot Alicia and Erica same with your parents and your genealogy but where in the world would the heavens have genealogies or Generations or the earth the earth also has Generations so what is it it's a successive order so one leads into the other and the other and the other now remember what God is doing these are the generations of the heavens and of the Earth again he puts the heavens and the blue dot in the same line so you see those of you that struggle and think are not very important and you're not very well known or maybe you think that God somehow bypassed you and he was giving out great gifts and great things but look at what such a tiny tiny spot and God Likens it and brings it up on an equivalency of heavens so the next time you feel sorry for yourself smack yourself in the face and say shut up you are important to God are there any of us that feel like we could be just a DOT I mean look the farther out you go whenever you look at what we saw here it would be like an ink pen and you would take and make a DOT on a piece of paper in comparison to the plan that are out there if you've looked at any the charts and you know they'll take the Earth and then they'll compare the Earth to Saturn and Uranus and all them different ones and the farther out they go into the universe the smaller and the smaller that the Earth becomes until eventually the Earth actually disappears in relevance compared to what's there and yet it is the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the the Earthly bride Moses says these are the generations of the heavens of the earth when they were created in the day the Lord God made the Earth notice how he switches it around made the earth and the heavens huh well praise the Lord and may like to be remembered today as we pray want to give you just a little bit of update on brother Larry Elliott surgery went good the doctors said it was a success and we're certainly grateful for that our brother's still in recovery I talk to him and text him again this morning text him and and we're so grateful that the Lord's been with him certainly just need to remember his strength that the Lord will just you know bring him back where he needs to be also have a prayer CL today for sister Ruth Ward she has some needs in her body anybody else have a request on your heart today heavenly father as we look into your word it helps us to realize in one sense of the word it's a paradox your greatness makes us feel so small but yet the mercy and the grace that you you've given to us helps us to see how much you love us and care for us I pray father that you would take your word today and anoint the people to be able to receive from it Lord help me to be able to get out of the way dear God I ask that you'd be mindful of all the needs of your children father this prayer call for our sister Ruth Ward you see her needs Lord and I pray that you just be mindful of her Lord we're so thankful that you've been with brother Larry and he was able to come through this surgery and several things that they found there in Vanderbilt that our doctors here hadn't even seen or overlooked whichever it was we're grateful that he was able to go there and they were able to help him now we're just asking that You' give him strength in his recovery Lord we have other folks here in the in our church family that have needs of Miracles or they don't just need a touch they need but the miraculous power of God but we believe our God is a miracle working God Amen I pray that you'd minister to every heart here today Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated so do you believe with me today that our God is a god of order and structure that the whole universe that we look out into what a little bit that we can see with our naked eye that it just didn't happen to be I don't have a problem with the Big Bang Theory my opinion would just be a little bit different of what caused it to bang I believe it was his spoken word but it didn't just happen on its own and it's not kept by its own power but it's kept by his great word and it's in divine order and of all the planets and the stars and things that are in the heavens there was only one that actually fell and that was because the god of that planet fell first so all the septian that are out there they never fail when man fell because God gave the Earth to human beings and that was his domain his kingdom now what he done was he wrote his first Bible the prophet tells us there was three Bibles the first one was written in the stars and in the heavens so if we could read them we would find out a lot of his great purpose and what he wants to do and what he would demand of them in the heavens that he would demand of us on the earth because that's his first Bible so he wrote redemption in the Stars reconciliation in the Stars he wrote about a dragon that would take his tail and sweep up and pull a third part of the stars out of the heavens that was symbol of course we see that he wrote all types of signs and wonders which man has looked at and been puzzled at for thousands and thousands of years but he also wrote in there about praise and worship and adoration what if God wrote that in the star s and that was his first Bible then I wonder about us being on on this little blue dot how God wants us to live how God wants us to do how God wants us to worship so let's read a few of these places today if you would let's start in Deuteronomy chap 10 verse 14 behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens is the Lord's thy God now listen the Heaven and the heaven of the heavens is the Lord's thy God the Earth also so now watch again Moses writing Deuteronomy and the way that God gave it to him was that the heavens count part was actually this blue dot so the heavens and the Earth so it's like this that the heavens was the husband and the Earth was his wife how could you ever compare the two how could you in your right mind now scientists no doubt would like at some of the things we're going to say today and ridicule it but I'm not bringing it to you from an Avenue of science but from the Avenue of God's word behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens is the Lord's thy God the Earth also with all that therein is Psalms 115 verse 16 the heaven even the heavens are the Lord Lords but the Earth has he given to the children of men but if you'd like to study it sometime from the old and the New Testament and you'll watch that God would bring them and Link them together the heaven sometimes he'd say it's singular sometimes he would make it plural the Heaven and the Earth or the heavens and the Earth or the heaven of the heavens and the Earth so he's constantly referring to all this greatness way out here which is man still is just now finding out about and then he links it to this little tiny blue dot as if though there is some sort of equivalence between the two I wonder if we've missed something through all these years that we have sought for greatness we've sought to be big and wonderful we measure that by how great we are of man's measure and S of the way God would measure you believe with me that God inspired Moses to write these things so I don't think that Moses was riding it out of ignorance do you and that Moses didn't understand the relevance between the size of the universe and the size of the Earth but I believe that he wrote it by the spirit of God so there was this great mystery that was written in the stars when the logos started expanding the creation of god notice Psalms 147:4 he tell us the number of the Stars he calleth them all by their names now if there is one septian or even two or three or four how many ever there are septian and your father made every one of them and gave every one of them their own name and he knows their names now can you imagine then here they are out in the universe their Glory all that God gave them and he calls them by their name so he didn't just give them that name but he calls them so every now and then father must say something to Mars Jupiter all these thousands times thousands times thousands trillions of galaxies and he refers to them by name hey Orion hey Pluto and then somehow the devil wants to convince us he's forgotten about us in our struggles and of none of the rest of these planets in the entirety of the scripture does God ever bring them on an equivalent basis of the heavens or simply a star in the heavens but he never Likens Jupiter and the heavens on this same plane or any the rest of them only this little tiny blue dot so remember now he wrote The Mystery of election in the stars and predestination now we might look at Earth and say you know there's been so much on the earth and as I've been looking in the last week or so at some of the the videos that are on YouTube and other places where you can find them of the blood and the devastation that's been over in Western North Carolina and our our part of Tennessee as well and see what has happened and I saw a weather man the other day as it come up on the Weather Channel on my phone and this man was saying that in parts of Western North Carolina that 90% of the trees were destroyed and annihilated and I heard him and he said that that by the loss of this amount of trees it would actually affect the weather in the coming years in Western North Carolina and then he explains how that would work because the roots of the trees pull the moisture out of the earth it comes up to the trunk and the branches of the tree then the moisture goes out of the leaves it's released in the air and it will help create rain it would also affect thunderstorms in the mountains in Western North Carolina Carol and I wrote up the road yesterday up to Irwin and up 26 where they've got if you've been there a lane open to where you can go through and looking at all of the mass destruction and the devastation I told her as we were driving I said you look and and see what it is the Earth is bearing her scars she's ready for a body change now a lot of this that happened and that weatherman was saying that some of the trees that were destroyed were 50 60 70 80 90 120 years old and it would be Generations before they would ever be replaced thought buddy let me tell you one thing the millennium's coming before that'll ever happen but the Earth will carry these scars of what this hurricane Helen did to it you understand me so the Earth itself is mirroring what the bride is also doing in that we though we are Redeemed by the grace of God and our souls have crossed over the line and will never be lost again but yet in our Spirits in our minds in our our mortality our makeup we carry the scars of our humanity and as we drove up the road looking at it and we came to there a few weeks ago from the youth camp and I was I absolutely marveled as I saw the thousands of trees that were along beside the road that were visible that you could see and yet within two and a half three weeks from the last time Caro and I came through there thousands and thousands of those trees had been burned and they were they were gone they were just absolutely gone so what is man doing Lake Lure over in North Carolina those of you that are familiar with that Lake quite a beautiful spot and whenever the hurricane got done they said that there was 50 ft deep of debris of logs bushes trees boats all kinds of things 50 feet deep in that Lake but within a short period of time they've already went through and and taken all of that out and they listed the tons of debris that they had taken out to help the lake pure terfy and as I looked at that I thought you know man has this within him the ability when chaos will strike to try to bring it back to its Eden Beauty and I I saw a a part person as they was talking about it and and there was videoing them and they stepped out into a precipice and it was a woman and she said I used to walk right here and she said this is one of the most beautiful places and the woman started broke down and started crying and she said to look at it now she said there's a 30t deep crevice that's here and the river washed it out and took 30 feet of soil out in my mind as this has happened in our our part of the country here I I've thought and wondered what it must have been like in the Andel luian destruction when Noah and his family stepped out of the Ark and we know the Earth still Bears the scars of that original flood and several miles deep in the eastern part of Canada they have drilled down by core drills and have found little sea creatures that have been buried in miles of of all this and she Bears within her core the scars of man's sin but why wouldn't God just take the Earth and say you know what it would be easier for me just to make a new one she's got so much that man has done God says in the Book of Revelation he will destroy them that destroys the Earth would not it be easier if God just spoke and another Earth come into view that did not bear the scars in her core and all that she's bore through the images and looking at the Andel luian destruction and the great earthquake that happened 2,000 years ago when he died and the earthquakes that's going to happen under the six seal why would God just not start all over again because in the earth rise and fall in her bearing the Judgment of man's sin is wrote The Mystery of reconciliation and Redemption you see the Earth is the only planet that God calls by name so so he spoke her name and her name is in the Book of Life the Bible so God cannot erase her name Hallelujah he cannot erase her name and come up with a new thought that he will live on that planet with his bride but instead he will redeem her oh can you imagine children when whenever the sick seal finally Fades out the battle of Armageddon will rage the Lord Jesus and his bride will come back upon the Earth and when the enemy has been annihilated and he lifts his bride Hallelujah and the spirit of God will allow man to to break into that Realm by atomic fire and seven of course is a number of completion at the End of the Age then God will allow us to go back remember God was called out of his Millennium in the Garden of Eden and we know that God made the man and placed him there and then God entered into his rest or his Millennium but man's fall called our father out of his Millennium and God had to stop the Millennium and put it on hold but we cannot jump from day six which is where we're living at in the increment of time we cannot jump from day six to day eight but we must live through the seventh day so the seventh day will be restarted but it will not just be father and Adam and Eve alone on the Earth but there will be millions of people who will be on the earth and we will be here by the grace of God in glorified bodies then when God brings man back to his spot man's domain will match himself now watch whenever man fell Earth took on the image of man so God in order to redeem the Earth God had to take the image of Earth upon himself he did not just become man for your sake alone but he took on the image of Earth that Earth could be redeemed the devil might say the same thing about you and I oh why don't God just get rid of us and get somebody else he cannot do it aren't you glad today oh how many times have we felt like that we have failed so much and so bitterly and brought so much reproach on God and just think God why don't you just cast me away and just raise somebody else up that can save you but he can no more destroy you than he can destroy himself the Earth Bears within her metalogical story and her metallurgical story in her environmental Story the fall and the rise of man as we dig down and I saw just the other day where just a few years ago that they had broke into under the surface of the Earth of what we know as the Dome of the Rock and the City of David on the outside lay on the outside of where the Dome of the Rock is that they now have finally opened it up to just an element of the public but they have went down many many feet beneath the Dome of the Rock they got great big steel beams and all kinds of things under it and I I saw a video of it the other day and this camera team was allowed to go down under it and they have actually found the original pavement that was there and the they said it was the very street that the Lord Jesus walked upon himself and yet it laid beneath all of that rubble and big stones that was part of the original foundation of the city of Jerusalem I'm talking about many many tons in one stone just absolutely unimaginable to the human mind but yet where did all that history lay so they found the signant Ring Of The Scribe of Jeremiah whose name was Baro Baro look in your book of Jeremiah when you get home and they found one of his signant rings so there it was they found a wedding ring they found all types of things of course the Arabs and the Palestinians don't like them finding them sort of things because it proves Israel has an identity there beneath all of that dirt and that's what the devil don't want you and I to see he don't want us digging past the dirt to find out the identity that lays down inside of our soul we have a wedding band that was slipped on our ring on our finger before the foundation of the world it don't bear the name of Rook or Donnie or Jim but it Bears the name of the seed of God Amen oh think that God through all the years knew what the Earth would be and even in its creation it is created with this element that God knew one day when man would come upon the Earth that he would actually forfeit his right to this Earth and the Earth which stood upright in a perfect uh axis no tilt of it one way or the other God knew that when man come on the earth that the Earth would fall so God made the Earth with the capability of being changed from this over this way to 23 degree angle til and still be able to operate and it's the same with you and I don't you understand what we're longing for we're longing for this but even though we've been saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost we're still here oh yeah we're wobbling and we don't understand why this goes on and that goes on and there's something down inside of us that is groaning oh if we could hear the Earth today here in East Tennessee it hasn't been that many months ago the beautiful trees were putting forth their leaves and look at them now the very image of death all around them and they are groaning and they are crying the Earth was not made to bear this but yet God knew that she would listen at this in Nehemiah 9:6 thou even thou Lord art the Lord alone thou Hast made Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all their host the Earth and all things that are therein the Seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of Heaven worship us thee now you and I cannot understand star language I don't understand tree language I don't understand dog language horse language cow language but God does you understand trees worship god well if a tree does shame on you claim to be Christians and you don't actually the Earth rejoices and so does the heavens look with me in 1 Chronicles chap 16:31 let the heavens be glad and let the Earth rejoice oh my aren't you glad the Earth is not waiting until the Eighth Day to Rejoice but the Earth can Rejoice under her struggles and all the difficulty that she's going through remember this is the Bible that's written in the skies watch again in Psalms 895 and the heavens shall praise thy wonders oh Lord Thy Faithfulness also in the congre ation of the Saints Psalms 9611 let the heavens rejoice and let the Earth be glad Let the Sea Roar and the fullness thereof so when you stand by the Sea and it's making its noise actually it's worshiping God praise the lord it's roaring out praise be to God and you know it must make the devil so mad because he can't make the sea stop praising it must upset him because the sea not one day has ever worship the devil the sea not one day nor the leaves on the trees nor the stars in the heavens have ever worship the devil they have never give him one moment of Praise oh how it ought to shame us as people of God that we want to act like the devil is so big and so mighty but a little old Leaf could tell you shame on you for praising the devil shame on you for making the devil sound like he's omnipotent and that little old Leaf comes out in the spring and he hangs on there and he's only got a short time to live but he will praise God in the sunshine he'll praise God in the rain he'll praise God in the storms and even when he's falling off off in the fall and he went from a green to a beautiful bright orange and as he falls off the tree praise be to God there will come another spring and I will be sucked up again by the roots of the tree and I will come back next year or year after next there is a resurrection for me I will live again I will PA children if they do that what about us as the people of God oh thank you Lord Jesus let the heavens rejoice and the Earth be glad Let the Sea Roar and the fullness of I I love this one that David said in Psalms 148:3 praise ye him son and moon Praise Him all ye stars of light Praise Him ye heavens of heavens and ye Waters that be above the heavens you mean water Praises God he hasth also establish them forever and ever he hath made a decree which shall not pass Isaiah 44:23 sing oh ye Heavens praise God you mean the heavens sing they don't sing country music though they don't sing rock and roll they don't sing rap they don't sing Blues what are they singing to almighty God as I said I don't understand our language I don't understand how the heavens sing but according to the word of God they sing can you imagine what a praise now remember it's written in the stars God's Bible is written in the stars so if they Praise Him in the heavens and have for the ceaseless ages what about those of us on the earth that are redeemed and the star ain't never fa the star ain't never fa the power of God the star has never been healed the star has never been down on the knees praying and the Holy Ghost come in the room where it was and the spirit of God just energized that Soul all it's ever done is worshiped and glistened and shine and Just Praise almighty God from the day it was created until the very end of time and it keeps on praising today oh my sing oh ye heavens for the Lord has done it shout oh oh my goodness shout ye lower parts of the earth shout ye lower parts of the earth amen shout ye lower parts of the earth watch how they bounced back and forth between heavens and earth and the Earth was tied to the heavens and the heavens was tied to the Earth the heavens worship the inhabitants on the earth that are redeemed they ought to worship oh my I I feel like if there's one thing that so many Christians fall short of the glory of God in their daily walk with God it's that we don't praise Him near enough you should pray oh even when I'm not in church especially when you're not in church why because I've learned this if you will praise him every day of your life when you go to church I mean you really want to praise him then but you watch people that hardly ever praise God in church I almost guarantee you 95 of a hundred of them don't hardly ever praise God during the weekday and you are robbing God and robbing yourself of a blessing well you say what should I praise him for breast Life water Family Church Ministry food come on somebody friend family we have got so much to praise him [Applause] for oh my shout ye lower parts of the earth break Force into singing ye mountains all forest and every tree yeah so you imagine a little Ash A Little Elm a little sycore and there they stand beside a Mighty Oak 110 years old and that Mighty O has been through all kinds of Storms and trials and the Little Oak stand there by me what should I do Grandpa what should I do praise him praise him in the morning praise him in the noon time praise him when the Sun going down oh but here comes the storm here comes the storm what can I do hold on son hold on that's what's kept me through the storms of life that God pled by Roots down in this soil of the earth I am here to serve God's purpose and a hurricane can't knock me down a tornado can't knock me down unless it's my time to go come on somebody and if I do I will leave my legacy behind if time were to go on every one of these trees that have been destroyed there will be another and another and another that will come up so I say to you the Lord God took Paul but because of the way he lived and the gospel he preached there was another little Oak and another little Oak and another little Timothy and another little Titus so God done Through the Ages God took our Prophet but oh how he would no doubt be so happy to walk into a church like this today when the message of the hour is being preached and he'd find one preacher and another preacher and another preacher and he'd say my work was not in vain oh no it is not in vain break Force into singing You mountains oh forest and every tree they in now this is why the trees are supposed to sing for the Lord has redeemed Jacob the Lord has redeemed Jacob and the trees are happy about it that's right praise be to God well if we could update that from the Old Testament you thought I'd say these trees in this day are about to have a spell because they know that that there's something about they can see the sequence of times and what all is going on and they must know the resurrection's getting close at hand and there'll come a day that I will never die again I'll stand there as a Mighty O and for eternity you imagine the big oak trees and them streams and them beautiful Parks there'll never be a frost that'll ever cover the face of the Earth I'm about to preach right now wish should get with me I'll tell you one thing friend there'll never be a cemetery there'll never be a funeral there'll never be a funeral home on that 's day there'll never be none of that s that a PA will ever be digging dig down there and a body be put on the earth you talking about shouting and worshiping and praising God if the trees Praise Him Now what will they do in the eighth [Applause] day I just got to be honest with you kind of makes me wonder if our ears be more open than what they are now and we'll go out and walk in the forest amongst the trees and the animals but our ears will be tuned to tree language then and we'll watch some leaves just that gentle Brie you know not not storms but as they're just there and they're bowing and worshiping and praising God and you walk down by the tree of life and you reach over and you pluck off the prophet said you pluck off on them leaves because your use is constantly being renewed as you eat from the fruit of the trees this is something that the devil don't understand and many Christians don't understand our youth in our soul is constantly being renewed when we feed on the word of God for the hour when we come to the house of God and we can be so low and so weary and we just say oh I don't know if I can make it another day but we come to where the Fountain of Life is already here hallelujah and we're able to pull from that water and reach over and grab a hold to the leaf off of the tree of life amen and our souls leave and say all right devil where are you where are you devil I'm ready for another day I'm ready for another battle why because we have already tapped into the Water of Life our fa is being renewed our courage is being [Applause] renewed break Force into singing You mountains oh forest and every tree therein for the Lord ha redeemed Jacob and glorified himself in Israel Psalm Isaiah rather 49:13 sing oh heavens and be joyful oh Earth and Break Forth into singing oh Mountains for the Lord has comforted his people so he's making the heavens and the Earth testify and worship because of the good goodness not so much just to them but the goodness to his people yes sir don't you see the heavens is tied to the Earth the glorification of the heavens is being expressed by the Earth and when we look at Redemption how can it be that the prophet tells us in the church age Mo that in her is summed up the perfect wisdom of God in the pride of Christ has summed up the perfect wisdom of God in so much that he is not complete without you and you're not even a blue dot you're even tinier than that on that little tiny blue dot so you imagine if the Earth is that little tiny blue dot imagine how big you are and yet he come down to this blue dot Hallelujah so we can see it in the heavens then that God has order you believe that can I have a few more minutes so dides God have order on the earth did he have order in the Old Testament Exodus 27:21 in the Tabernacle of the congregation within the veil which is before the testimony Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the Lord it shall be EST statued forever under their Generations on behalf of the children of Israel now we'll read several of these so it's to do it's the sacrifice it's to do it's a tabernacle it's to do with the manora it's also to do with the bread Exodus 39:37 the pure Candlestick with the lamps thereof even with the lamps to be set and all the vessels thereof and the L oil for light Exodus 40 and4 and thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set in order God knew how hard Ed we were didn't he so he repeated himself God don't set her like we do God knew how we were upon it and thou shalt bring in the Candlestick so it wasn't like that that God said y'all just build God a house it don't matter what color he use what kind of wood you use even our wives is more piggy than that so you got to have a certain kind of wood you got to have a certain color you got to do this and that and the other and God said this is the way I want it done and this is the only way I will accept it notice verse 23 and set the bread in order upon and I remember the bread was the 12 loaves of shoe bread which the word shoe bread is the bread of his face so it was set before his face the bread so it's set in order now what difference does it make well there's one bla named for the first tribe room on down on down on down well can't you mix them up not according to God you couldn't they've got to be in their proper place Leviticus 1:7 and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar and lay the word why be siy God because our God is a god of order and structure now you can see why Le of the sins do not fit in the elect column in the last days cuz people want to be Christians don't even go to church want to be Christian they don't honor Sunday or there you know the resurrection a bit more than nothing oh I'm a Christian where you go to church I don't even go to church I don't believe I need to because I'm in Christ I'm in Christ so therefore I don't even need to go to church you see what they're doing they're totally discrediting the god of order and the god of structure because they have no structure to their life no structure to worship they just give God what they want God to have forget God's divine order forget but you see the bride this is one thing again that makes her different from the church is because the bride wants divine order for her life divine order does not mean that we're cold dead and formal but with a living God in our midst we're not going to be formal come on somebody but there is a divine order notice again in verse 8 and the priest Aaron's son shall lay the parts now this is a sacrifice The Head and the fat in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar so this is on that and that is on that and that is on that well what if they change the order let's put the ram down first let's put the fat down first and then we'll just throw a little bit of you know rice on the top of that we'll put a little bit of carrots over on the side a little bit of maters and ters on the other side they'll pack you out of dead man Leviticus 612 and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it and it shall not be put out and the priest shall burn wood on every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it and you can see why with these things being done over and over and over and over again that human beings can become so methodical that it's just I'm getting up I'm going to church Sunday it's Sunday morning we're going to church and we're going to sit in our favorite spot if somebody else ain't got if they've got our spot I'm want to be mad a hornet I'll tell you one thing I ain't going to get nothing out of the service you ought to be so happy to come to the house of God if you had to set in a plastic child's chair you ought to be happy to be able to come to church you see this is one of the challenges for us that when we find the order of God that it does not become cold and monotonous and formal come on somebody all people say well that's just church entity going to church or maybe it's Church entity for you but when God saved me many years ago he saved me to go to church I love going to church now more than I've ever love going to church and I've been going to church basically all of my life since 12 years old and I love going to church because I never know what God's going to do I never know what God's going to say and yes there's some methodology to it but I've learn that if I will do everything on my part he will surpass everything I respect praise the Lord Leviticus 243 without the veil of the testimony and the Tabernacle of the congregation shall Aaron order it from the evening until the morning before the Lord continually it shall be a statue forever in your Generations Leviticus 24:4 he shall order the lamps upon the pure Candlestick before the Lord continually Elijah's First Kings 18:33 and he put the wood in order and cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said Phil four barrows remember four is the number of Earthly Deliverance was water and poured on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood after Uzziah had touched the ark 1 coronal 15:12 and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that you may bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it for because you did it not at the first the Lord Our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order now you understand David was one to bring the ark up to his house but David left out one simple thing he left out the ministry so they put the word on a new cart and said we don't really even need preachers anymore come so we're taking the word and we're putting it on a new cart and remember those who touched that died they died that's right because let it out now after the breach has been made upon them oh people say well well bless God we we we want to move a God in our church we don't want no order we don't want no church order what are you saying what are you saying that God would send a Vindicated Prophet to tell us how to worship how to pray how to operate our gifts and we don't want that in our church so what else don't we want in our church I want everything that God has order included but order as I said does not mean formality order is there to give us a guideline to watch what are we watching for the invasion of evil spirits the invasion of evil spirits in our life and in our worship come on somebody but we want the spirit of God we want gifts of God we want the Holy Ghost we want worshiping and all that sort of thing do we not oh my M psalm 110:4 for the Lord has sworn and will not repent Thou Art the priest Forever After the order of mezc 1 Corinthians 11:34 If any man hunger let him eat at home that when you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in in order when I come first Corinthians 14:40 let all things be done decent and look at the meaning of the word an arranging Arrangement a fixed succession observing a fixed time doe or right order orderly condition the post rank or position which one holds in Civic or other Affairs and since her position generally depends on one's talents experience resources character fashion quality and style so Paul said let all things be done in decency and in order for those who are equipped by God not those who want to be something but that will be the divine order of God you mean to tell me in the New Testament they had order yep they sure did boy the Corinthian Church sure needed it too 1 Corinthians 16:1 now concerning the collection for the Saints as I have given order I wonder if for some of the people on that day said well that was just for Paul's Church actually if you look at Paul's writings every one of those books that he wrote was to his churches you ever wonder why Paul didn't write a letter to the church at Jerusalem that was the mother Church what why he didn't write a letter to the church in Babylon that's the church that Peter founded you see they believed in order and they believed that they were not called he said I chose to go preach Christ but I wouldn't go preach and where others and mentioned him lest I would build on another man's Foundation they believe God had designated by divine order a specific spot here Paul is a messenger of the age and never felt led of God to rise a letter to the church at Jerusalem boy I got you thinking now ain't it well good maybe get your head out of Facebook and go to reading your Bible all right Twitter and Tik Tock and flipflop and all the rest these stupid stuff we've got our minds so caught up into social media let's get our mind back on the word let's get our mind back on the prophet's message this is what's going to get us out of here oh my Hallelujah Colossians 2:5 we close your momentarily for though I be absent in flesh yet am I with you in spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your facei in Christ titus: 15 for this cause left are they now Paul writing to Titus so he goes up through the the aisle of cre 110 miles long something like that so there's several several cities all along the aisle of Creek and everywhere Paul goes there was a Revival had a conversion now Paul had to leave then and go somewhere else so Paul leaves Titus there and Titus is going to set the churches up set them up and you know what he's going to set them up with Elders preachers so they wasn't writing Paul's books and just having somebody to stand up read it but they ordained Elders praise the Lord for this cause left I Thee incre that thou should us set in order the things that are wanting notice what was wanting now people had got saved some of them got the Holy Ghost they got delivered of their idolatry and all of that and they said well praise the Lord I mean we're we're Believers now they were Believers but they were not in order there was no pastors no deacons there was no structure of the Church of the Living God God did not want to just save people and scatter them out he wanted them to be born by the spirit of God into the mystical Body of Christ but they also wanted them to gather together in Fellowship in the church local uhoh now I'm going to lose some of the message folks ain't I well this is why a lot of will never have the hearts turned back to the original Apostolic face because in reality they don't believe in Apostolic face they believe this message is something totally new it's totally new therefore they don't even need the Bible they don't need Paul as a reference Peter as a reference but your Prophet went beyond the curtain of time and you know who he referred to you know who he judged his own message by Paul himself what Paul preached I preach the same thing and those of us that are there by representation we answered back and said are resting on that Paul will be judged and he said if Paul's group goes in mine will go in well a lot of these message folks will not go in because they do not see Apostolic order as a requirement in the last day the alpha bride started out with divine order by a prophet of God the Omega bride will be capped off by the very same word of God that's been turned back to the original Apostolic Faith a Apostolic order come on somebody and they're not rebelling against the prophet they're not rebelling against God call men because they can recognize that was God's order given to us by the founder of the church which is Jesus Christ himself let's stand our feet [Applause] praise the Lord now I'm going to give you my title praise the Lord as a right of the people of God this will be one of our final rights that'll be granted the right to be in divine order you see this Earth this age is so urgent and it's so required that the Lord Jesus was put out of his church in Revelation 3 and the ly in church age and he cannot cause a resurrection and a Rapture if he does not have his body under his headship and his control so there must be an order that's flowing from the head down to the body then the head projects to them the resurrection call and the prophet tells us that Jesus gets his place in the last days so he's got to have a people on the Earth a body and they are submitted to his Dynamics we as a bride we are his mechanics on the earth his voice his eyes his hands I've been sharing a quote this morning that a minister friend of mine from Canada had shared earlier today brother random was talking about the Lord Jesus doing his work and his people oh just a powerful powerful statement and he said the Lord actually his resurrection appeared to the ones on the road to EMAs but he appeared in veiled form and he said the Lord might appear to you in your pastor or in somebody you go to church with that's trying to encourage you and he said it might be Jesus himself using that brother's sister oh praise God and then you wonder what you can do there a a person standing before me right now we was communicating this week and a brother told me that he he he feels in his heart to kind of reach out to different people in the church and maybe those that don't have a lot of friends or feel like they don't have a lot of friends and they're kind of left out of this circle or that Circle and he it's just something that he felt to do and I text him back and told him I said brother that's a great ministry the brother's response was you mean that's a Ministry you see the word Deacon comes from the Greek word deonia and the meaning of it is ones who are called to minister some of you think because you don't preach or you don't have a gift you can't Minister but you can minister to those sometimes that are hurting those that are lonely it do you good every now and then to break out of your favorite four and no more and maybe notice people that aren't you know maybe kind of standing by their s but it don't seem like they have very many friends and try to let them know that you love them and you're praying for them and say something nice Jesus might use you to help someone that's going through one of the lowest spots in their life will y'all ever become best buds maybe not but it might be your five minutes that you took away from your little circle of friends just to show somebody a little bit of kindness and make life a little bit easier for them wouldn't it be something if you stand before the Lord that day and that man or woman walks up beside you and you're turn around looking at them and think wow and the Lord Jesus turns and says to you you remember that day after service you went over them because you saw them standing out in the vestibule of church and nobody was speaking to them nobody was having nothing to do with them and you really didn't know him that well you didn't really feel that comfortable talking to them but you went over and just said hey how you doing praying for you hope everything's going well they had made up in their mind that day they would never coming back to Word of Life again because it seemed like the people were snobby to them help us Jesus I said help us Jesus the right to be in divine order you believe what you want to believe friends I do not believe the Lord is having us to talk about perfect love and these things that we're talking about I don't believe it's for no cause I believe it'll be one of the last things that she'll get before she leaves I ain't talking about getting it here but she'll finally get it she'll understand what she's supposed to do once she gets it in here she's to give it back oh my and Minister oh but it's so easy for us to draw a little circle and we're nice to those in our little circle and our favorites and our pck you know the reason a lot of churches are like that cuz preachers are like that preachers draw the little circle of them two or three brothers that see eye to eye on their doctor their Doctrine and that's their best buddies and then somebody they know crosses their ideology boy they won't have nothing to do with them and they'll post quotes on there you can't believe sometimes that preachers behave they'll post quotes on different this and that and the other trying to get it that guy and trying to get at that guy it ain't no wonder went no further up the road because a lot of the preachers ain't no further up the Road God help us God help us let bow our heads so you little T90 Speck of dust on this blue dot almighty God called you for a purpose wrote your name on his Heavenly book before the foundation of the world condescended from the heaven of the heavens down to this little blue dot to save you and I not just to save us but to fill us with his presence and to make us the extensions of his love so the prophet said he has no eyes on the Earth but ours No Hands on the Earth but ours anybody here today want to be the hands of Jesus a voice of Jesus you see this message tends to do something to us it every message of separation is always done the same thing we know we must separate from the world and we must separate from unbelief but if we're not careful we we want to separate from basically everybody and then if anybody disagrees with the way we believe about the gifts or anybody disagrees The Way We believe about predestination or election oh they don't believe what the prophet of God said I'll tell you one thing glory to God I'll believe what that Prophet said I'm standing right there for not careful we just keep separating separating separating and before long they ain't nobody left but us and let me tell you right now if the Rapture comes and Word of Life Church is the only one going in it I have to say I don't understand what about people of God around this world that love the Lord Jesus just as much as we do men of God that have done more for the kingdom of God than I could ever even think about doing but you see separation separation separation before long God stops separating and then we kick in and stop separating God separates us from unbelief not from brothers that disagree with us a little bit you see the prophet brought the message in this spirit that her brothers would draw him out he' draw a bigger Circle yeah I don't understand where we got the ideology that instead of us drawing bigger circles we draw smaller ones and we draw them and redraw them and draw them and redraw them and we've got them draw now to where a great separation is in our message ranks yes sir and it's so sad sir as gono and the captured Indians the Apaches from Arizona and some of the Apaches from the White Mountains they forfeited their rights to be Apaches and Real Americans and they sold their abilities to the American Army cuz a white man could never track the Indians so they got a Apaches to track the Apaches and then whenever it was all said and done they give them a rank you know give them guns and so on when they finally surrendered for the last time they took their rifles they stripped them of their Rank and they put them on the same trains that gono was on and sent them to Florida and some of the other Apaches that held out to the end they were were so angry at those men who had sold their birth rights they got mad and they started having words one with another on the train down to Florida but jono being a true leader said L's enough fight there's so few of us left we need one another now more than ever before we're being attacked on every side friends 7 three different media Outlets have published from new newspaper articles in the last few weeks lies hypocrisy all types of different things about the message we need one another more than ever before and the devil is fighting us trying to separate us more than he ever has may God help us how many can say today Lord I need help with that in my life Lord Jesus help me let's just bow our heads together father we've seen you in your Mighty power move Among Us in such wonderful ways we've seen you deliver drug addicts we've seen you deliver folks from smoking that were so Bound by it they couldn't live one day without them we've seen you heal cancer we've seen you do great miracles signs and wonders we've seen you bring back backsliders lord I don't even know how many people we've baptized since we've been here at our new place and we're so thankful for all of that you've allowed us Lord after this terrible hurricane come through to be able to minister to thousands of people and within a couple of our Drive I'm our place here you've allowed us to be able to help that some have told us they would have died waiting on the government to get to them Lord you've helped us to do that we thank you for it but now we're asking you Lord for some more help we need that great thing that can only come from you perfect love love that can forgive our enemies and we know that your Prophet has told us when he preach perfect faith that faith is based upon forgiveness you said it yourself that if we do not forgive men of their trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive yours I doubt sincerely I'm the only one in this building today but I need your forgiveness every day of my life not just for the things I fall short of that I know about but for those things that I'm ignorant of ignorance is Lord help us Jesus but we admit when people hurt us in a certain way it can be so hard for us as humans to forgive them any people that's standing here today are under the sound of my voice that'll hear this maybe they've been hurt by a friend a loved one a preacher and Lord they've tried their best to get rid of it and they just can't do it and by saying that Lord I don't mean that even if we forgive that individual we'll be best of friends and buddies we may never be that because they that little something may always be there in the human part but I'm talking about from our soul that we will have nothing against them Lord Jesus your Prophet tells us thus saith the Lord lay aside everything until you get perfect love amen I don't know how much pler it could be so why is it that we seek healings above perfect love Miracles above perfect love gifts signs wonders help us lord it's written in the stars Hallelujah of a child that was born in Revelation 12 and he come out of that woman which had a crown of 12 Stars and when that child was born the dragon came and tried to destroy him and we know that child was you that Dragon was the devil then it goes on in Revelation 12 and says that the dragon took his tail the prophet tells us that was not literally of course a t a i l but it was a t a l e a tale a story that he he told once we are seated in Christ Jesus he can never get our souls again but he tries to affect our bodies Our Spirits our memory our minds with what t a l s and he tries to wrap his tails around stars and the prophet identified those stars as being Sons of Abraham so he tries to wrap his tails around our position so he can't get our soul so he focuses on the body he afflicts us he focuses on the spirit get us down focuses on our memory bring back failures and with his tail t a l e he will try to pull us as children of God away from our Divine Purpose but we refuse to listen to his lies amen make us one Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah just lay your hand over on the brother sister sent him there near you and offer a word of prayer for them would you Hallelujah Lord Jesus I want to be more like you Lord that's the way it's got to be for perfect love is not an option an absolute requirement and I have to be honest as these people I think will be I cannot produce that we cannot as a church produce that and you did it that way you would exhaust all of our abilities so we would have to have you I believe I have a portion of perfect love every person here today with the Holy Ghost does but what we want to do is learn how to use it more and take the t a l e of the devil from around our mind from around our spirit and cast it away so we can forgive and love and be merciful for you said blessed are the merciful for they shall be called the children of God father as we have our hands over one upon the other in the name of Jesus would you minister to your children today Lord Lord what we've been hearing on Wednesday night about the gifts it's made Lord me and I've heard others talk about it too such a hunger for the real and the genuine but Lord looking at it again father I found what the prophet said don't seek gifts seek The Giver amen so we're not seeking gifts so much we're seeking the giver but we want every gift The Giver has and every gift that he wants to give us oh Jesus would you minister to us today Father May the love of God so fall at our hearts it's no wonder that the quotee opened up with their Wednesday I where the Prophet said I'd rather have a church that didn't know one thing about spiritual gifts but they were so in love with you and so in love with one another but he doesn't stop there but he goes on to say if we had perfect love we would have perfect gifts oh Jesus make me more like you father oh I pray father in the name of Jesus granted I pray Lord God can we just raise our hands now you're not a tree you're not a leaf but a son or daughter of God but the heavens are speaking of what you and I should do if the trees standing out here in the Appalachian Mountains and many of them are already bare if they'd be like us thatd stop praising during The Bleak winter months but somehow they must praise without their leaves maybe Satan's took your health he's took this that the other from you you still got some bark don't you you still got some branches don't you you still got Roots you're still settled in the foundation of the word of God oh you may look pitiful right now
