[32:26] other through their Union and the
[32:28] product of that Union and that little
[32:30] baby maybe a mother's nose a Daddy's
[32:33] Eyes fingers
[32:35] toes they can see that reflected through
[32:39] that Union dear God then they know the

[34:02] name of the Lord Jesus
[34:06] amen
[34:14] yeah dodo
[34:23] Grandpa Stand Together
[34:28] what a privilege it is for us to be
[34:30] gathered together again today in the
[34:31] house of the
[34:33] Lord let's turn to First Corinthians
[34:36] chapter 11 if you would
[34:39] today I'm as happy to be a
[34:42] Christian happy to be given the
[34:44] opportunity to be able to serve the Lord
[34:46] in this day
[34:47] and all the things that he's done in
[34:50] this hour that we live 1 Corinthians
[34:56] 11:34 if any man hunger let him eat at
[35:01] home that you come not together unto
[35:05] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[35:09] order when I
[35:11] come 1 Corinthians
[35:16] 1440 let all things be done
[35:21] decently and in
[35:23] order the word order is taxi and
[35:27] arranging Arrangement a fixed succession
[35:33] observing a fixed time do or write order
[35:39] orderly condition now this type of
[35:42] biblical
[35:43] order is not
[35:46] formalism it's just the way God wants
[35:48] things done so it's a post a rank or a
[35:52] position which one holds in Civic or
[35:54] other Affairs since this position
[35:57] generally depends on one's talents
[36:01] you'll find the prophet saying the same
[36:02] thing question answers
[36:04] 1961 he said I like to look and see what
[36:07] a person is professing God has called
[36:10] them to do because generally Works God
[36:13] works with his creature the way that he
[36:16] has made him so if a man claims he's
[36:18] called to preach watch how he interprets
[36:21] the word he says that'll let you know if
[36:24] God's already called him or not so this
[36:27] position generally depends on one's
[36:29] talents experiences resources character
[36:32] fashion quality and style Colossians
[36:35] chapter 2 verse
[36:38] 5 for though I be absent in the flesh
[36:42] yet am I with you in the spirit
[36:47] joying and
[36:49] beholding your order so Paul is not
[36:53] rebuking them for having the right kind
[36:55] of order for ISM now of course spirit of
[36:59] God rebukes that but this is the type of
[37:02] order that God wants so it actually made
[37:04] Paul so happy and he said even though he
[37:07] was not there but he was hearing through
[37:09] the reports back from the church at
[37:11] colossia what they were doing and they
[37:12] said um Bishops and all that sort of
[37:15] thing up in the church and they had
[37:17] deacons and people of position and Paul
[37:20] heard back and he said I'm not there but
[37:22] I'm with you in spirit and I'm joying
[37:25] and beholding your your order and the
[37:29] steadfastness of your faith in Christ I
[37:34] mean let to be remembered today as we
[37:35] pray God bless you Heavenly Father we're
[37:39] so grateful that we could be gathered
[37:40] together once again here today Lord in
[37:42] this building that you've given us dear
[37:46] Jesus we've seen you do so many awesome
[37:48] things in our in our midst and for that
[37:51] we will forever be grateful but as needy
[37:56] human beings we come again today we have
[37:59] different needs different desires
[38:02] petitions you saw the hands that were
[38:05] uplifted maybe a marital problem maybe a
[38:08] financial issue maybe a son or daughter
[38:11] away from God I pray whatever that
[38:14] request is that you'd be mindful of them
[38:17] Lord father we're asking you today also
[38:20] for those that are sick and needy some
[38:21] in our assembly fighting tremendous
[38:24] battles with their health they need
[38:25] Miracles father and Lord we're mindful
[38:29] also and thankful that you brought our
[38:31] brother Larry Elliott through his
[38:33] surgery was able to come home and
[38:36] recuperating and we're just praying for
[38:37] our brother that you'd continue to
[38:39] strengthen and be with him help me now
[38:42] Lord as I Endeavor to speak on the words
[38:44] of Life take the service take the word
[38:47] help me Lord Jesus help the people for
[38:50] it's the glory of God and the kingdom
[38:53] which is to come that we ask these
[38:55] things in Jesus Christ Christ name amen
[38:59] God bless you you may be
[39:03] seated I want to speak to you again
[39:05] today by the help of the Lord on the
[39:08] right to be in divine
[39:12] order the right to be in divine
[39:16] order uh I'd like to go if we can back
[39:20] to when the prophet was out west and him
[39:24] and some of the brothers were on a
[39:25] hunting trip and he looked looked up
[39:27] into the Stars into the sky and he began
[39:31] to relate what he saw and I said
[39:34] somewhere in there I had it pointed out
[39:36] to me one time in an observatory the
[39:40] Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming
[39:43] over through the cancer age on down to
[39:45] the last was the lion Leo the Lion the
[39:49] first coming of Christ by the Virgin the
[39:51] second coming by the lion of the tribe
[39:53] of Judah I've tried my best to see that
[39:58] zodiac and I can't see it yet notice now
[40:04] it's there those who are trained know
[40:08] it's there job saw it man used to look
[40:12] at it it was a Bible one day it was a
[40:16] Bible one day but in that whole great
[40:19] mass of millions and
[40:23] billions of light years God sits in the
[40:27] the midst of it all and he looks down
[40:30] Paul is in there my
[40:33] mother is in there somewhere looking
[40:37] down and I thought of the order of the
[40:40] Heavenly Host not one of them's out of
[40:43] place every one of them keeps its time
[40:46] perfectly God's Great
[40:50] Army so he looking at the stars and of
[40:54] course at that time man couldn't not see
[40:58] where he's able to see now because of
[41:01] the equipment that they had in
[41:04] 1962 and it's like it's
[41:06] exploded um in this last day of what man
[41:10] has been able to see beyond what he
[41:13] could see at that time and it no doubt
[41:17] it would be overwhelming for the
[41:19] scientists in
[41:20] 1962 to be able to come back today and
[41:23] look through an observatory and see what
[41:26] scientist see now when they didn't even
[41:30] have the terminology that men use today
[41:34] they never use the word Parasect they
[41:36] never use certain terms the scientists
[41:39] have to use today to Define what they
[41:42] have seen and I Marvel at that myself
[41:45] because I find it amazing that science
[41:49] has been able to grow so much and
[41:51] understand so much more and yet when it
[41:54] comes to religion and church some people
[41:56] are still talking the same thing they
[41:58] talked for decades and hundreds of years
[42:01] ago they've not grown any in God their
[42:04] understanding is not grown they're
[42:06] exactly where their grandfathers were
[42:09] where their great-grandfathers were but
[42:11] aren't you glad God has allowed a people
[42:14] on the Earth in the last day to also
[42:17] grow with the
[42:19] time now when brother brandham looked up
[42:22] it must have been a great thing now
[42:23] remember a prophet sees things quite
[42:26] different than any the rest of us sees
[42:28] it so for him to call the Stars a great
[42:32] Army I mean know brother brand was not
[42:35] in the sense of a Hebrew scholar or a
[42:37] Greek scholar he uses several words down
[42:40] through the the years of the message but
[42:43] and he would take a Greek Lexicon but he
[42:45] was not one to use a lot of the Greek
[42:47] words and the Hebrew words so whether he
[42:50] ever even looked it up to be able to see
[42:53] what God said about the word host in the
[42:56] Old Testament which means an army I
[42:59] don't really know but yet he identified
[43:02] what he saw as an army of God and he saw
[43:06] them in a divine order and he believed
[43:10] according to what he saw that every one
[43:13] of them had a certain pass and if they
[43:15] stayed in that pass it would work
[43:18] exactly right but then he was puzzled
[43:22] and you can watch him as he talks about
[43:24] the earth and the the moon and all how
[43:26] it comes through and we'll jump down to
[43:28] paragraph three and I thought about that
[43:31] being God's Great Army there and I went
[43:34] to bed and I began to think that not one
[43:38] of those get out of their place they all
[43:40] set in place and if there's a moving
[43:42] anywhere of them for a cause it will
[43:46] affect the Earth we just seen the
[43:49] results of it now from some of them
[43:50] moving into other spots it's effective
[43:53] it affects everything and I thought then
[43:56] if that Gra
[43:57] heavenly host that has to keep its place
[44:00] to make everything in order what about
[44:03] the disorder of the Earthly host how
[44:08] when one gets out of order it throws the
[44:12] whole s out of cater the whole program
[44:16] of God is upset when one member gets out
[44:22] of order we should continually strive to
[44:26] keep the order of the spirit now notice
[44:30] he says the order of the spirit so the
[44:33] spirit of God has an order and that
[44:37] order is not formality that order is not
[44:42] dead and dry but it is a way by which
[44:45] God moves now according to Genesis 1:1
[44:50] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[44:53] in that particular spot Moses does not
[44:56] use the plural form but God created the
[45:00] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[45:03] without form and void and darkness
[45:06] covered the face of the deep and the
[45:09] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[45:11] waters and God said let there be light
[45:15] and there was light and God divided the
[45:19] light from the darkness and God called
[45:21] the light day and he called The Darkness
[45:25] night now the Earth is in the heavens
[45:28] too is it not but isn't it amazing that
[45:32] God separated the Earth out of the
[45:37] heavens and gave it its own special
[45:40] place in the heavens so it sort of
[45:43] reminds me of the people of God that we
[45:47] are in the world but we are not of the
[45:50] world so the Earth was identified in the
[45:55] heavens but yet called out from the
[45:58] heavens and given a special place if you
[46:01] wish to say it this way the Earth was
[46:05] Sanctified to the Lord God for a special
[46:09] purpose out of all the rest of the
[46:12] planets and the stars and as I quoted to
[46:15] you a couple of weeks ago that in the
[46:17] observable universe that there is
[46:20] estimated to be one septian
[46:24] Stars several
[46:27] trillion galaxies in those galaxies can
[46:31] be millions of stars and yet none of
[46:35] them does the bible call their name not
[46:38] another planet does the bible Call It by
[46:43] name you see when God calls something or
[46:48] someone by name and sanctifies them to
[46:54] himself it is a special choice voice and
[46:57] a reason that God is doing it now watch
[47:02] God now wrote this in the stars and God
[47:06] before he ever used the word election
[47:10] predestination choosing God wrote it in
[47:14] Stardust so God wrote The Mystery of
[47:18] predestination in the Stars God wrote
[47:22] that there would be a bride one day that
[47:25] would be separate from from all the rest
[47:28] of the church he wrote it in the Stars
[47:32] God called the Earth by name and wrote
[47:36] that in the stars that there would be a
[47:39] planet above all the rest and as we
[47:41] looked at it last Sunday that one little
[47:45] blue dot in the mass of all the universe
[47:50] and yet one spot that God chose to be in
[47:54] what scientists call the habitable
[47:57] zone so if the Earth was so much so many
[48:01] thousand miles closer to the Sun it
[48:03] would be too hot for life to grow if it
[48:06] was very much farther out away from the
[48:09] Sun it would be too cold for life to be
[48:13] able to survive so God placed it exactly
[48:18] in what they term as the habitable zone
[48:21] well you see that's the way it is with
[48:24] people some people no matter how much
[48:26] you and I pray for them how much we want
[48:29] them to be bride we will never even by
[48:32] prayer and fasting be able to make
[48:35] anyone bride only God can do that and if
[48:39] God never ordained that their life be in
[48:43] the spiritual habitable zone They will
[48:47] never be able to bring forth bride seed
[48:51] they may be good people they may go to
[48:53] church and they may wind up being saved
[48:57] as we would say but will never wind up
[49:00] being elect man is so interested in
[49:05] being able to get out there it's reading
[49:07] one day this week where Elon Musk is
[49:10] wanting to make a habitable place on
[49:15] Mars already planning it out with all
[49:18] the different things that they're doing
[49:20] and they want to make this community in
[49:23] Mars and I saw you know that that's the
[49:26] the the Mind of Men we've got thousands
[49:29] and thousands of acres in Texas in
[49:33] Arizona in Utah in Nevada in all types
[49:37] of places that aren't even habited by a
[49:40] human being now and yet instead of
[49:43] trying to figure out how to be able to
[49:45] bring water and this and that and the
[49:48] other on our own Planet they're trying
[49:50] to reach out yonder somewhere and put a
[49:53] community on Mars ain't nobody belongs
[49:56] on Mars but
[49:59] martians if there was such a thing but
[50:02] you see it's like man always wants to
[50:05] look beyond what God gives him so
[50:09] instead of being satisfied that God gave
[50:12] the Earth according to the Book of
[50:15] Psalms God gave the Earth to man not
[50:19] Mars not Saturn I don't care what they
[50:22] do they'll never find another planet
[50:26] that is special like the earth I don't
[50:29] care what the church does I don't care
[50:31] how much they despise the messenger and
[50:34] the message they will never replace the
[50:38] end time message in the last day they're
[50:41] looking for it here and they're looking
[50:43] for it there they can look all they want
[50:46] to look God chose Malachi 4 and Malachi
[50:50] 4 is the way he will do it is that right
[50:55] now that's God's choice but yet there's
[50:57] something in man that he's got to go
[51:00] beyond where God put him and find for
[51:03] something you imagine how many billions
[51:04] of dollars are wasting how much that
[51:07] they are wasting and people living their
[51:09] life for an absolute fruitless cause of
[51:12] something that will never materialize
[51:15] because the Bible says God gave the
[51:18] Earth to man so why shouldn't man just
[51:23] be happy where God put him you know it's
[51:25] the same way when we look at the
[51:27] spiritual reflection in the word that
[51:30] we've got people always no matter in
[51:32] every message that God sent to the Earth
[51:35] that there was an element of people that
[51:36] could never be satisfied living in the
[51:39] boundaries of the revealed word of their
[51:42] hour they constantly had to look and
[51:45] search for something new something
[51:48] different something that was just a
[51:50] little bit beyond what the messenger of
[51:54] their age said I hope somebody's sharing
[51:56] this morning and we find the same thing
[51:59] going on around the ranks of our
[52:02] message preachers always looking for
[52:05] just a little bit more than what God's
[52:08] Prophet said well he didn't exactly say
[52:10] it that way but he should have well he
[52:13] didn't exactly put it this way but if he
[52:15] would be here now he would say it this
[52:18] way well you know sounds like a martian
[52:21] to me somebody that's trying to move out
[52:24] of the designated area that God gave us
[52:27] as his people I said it years ago and I
[52:30] believe it's the same way if the Bible
[52:32] don't say it and the message don't speak
[52:35] it Heaven don't require it well come on
[52:38] somebody I don't care how many dreams
[52:41] and Revelations and visions that people
[52:44] have if it ain't in the word of God for
[52:47] the hour I personally don't have time
[52:49] for it and the church
[52:52] said you see the Earth is a part of the
[52:56] Heavens but Sanctified now look what
[52:59] does God give a man a wife for and
[53:03] whenever the Jews would get married in
[53:05] the Old Testament s of the Orthodox of
[53:07] this day they will say something like
[53:10] this I sanctify thee be thou Sanctified
[53:14] unto me according to the law of Moses
[53:18] and of Israel be thou Sanctified unto me
[53:22] according to the law of Moses and of
[53:25] Israel so a woman then that would join
[53:29] up to a husband the husband takes that
[53:32] set aart woman and by setting herself
[53:36] apart from the rest of the world which
[53:38] means she'll have no more lovers no more
[53:41] boyfriends nothing like that she's
[53:44] Sanctified to this one man in this
[53:47] sanctification is what makes her joining
[53:50] or her Union to her husband and it comes
[53:54] from the man's mouth be thou th
[53:56] Sanctified unto me now this is what God
[53:59] has done in every age by the message of
[54:02] the hour that he's called to the elect
[54:05] and said to the elect be thou Sanctified
[54:08] unto me set apart from me don't dress
[54:12] like them don't act like them don't do
[54:14] the way they do but be thou Sanctified
[54:17] unto me and the elect of every age have
[54:21] done exactly that now the Earth could
[54:24] not make herself habitable how could the
[54:27] Earth be able when God the logos spun it
[54:30] off in the beginning and he Let It Drop
[54:32] for so many millions of miles and God
[54:35] designated the decreed path for the
[54:37] Earth how could the Earth do that
[54:39] herself how could the Earth pick out
[54:41] that I want to be in the certain spot in
[54:43] the solar system and I want to be there
[54:45] I want to be there the Earth couldn't do
[54:46] that it was decreed by the almighty God
[54:50] no more than you and I can make ourself
[54:53] any more than the Divine allocation of
[54:56] God God has given to us and would make
[54:59] our lives so much easier if we would
[55:01] just find what God's called us to be get
[55:04] in that spot work in that spot and stay
[55:07] in that spot for the rest of our life
[55:10] but there's always something about man
[55:12] and his curious nature that he wants to
[55:15] move Beyond because with a lot of people
[55:18] it's like they feel like they've got so
[55:20] many more talents and so many more gifts
[55:23] oh if they could just move Beyond this
[55:25] or that or the other and you know it as
[55:27] well as I do a lot of times that's
[55:29] nothing but the devil now as God then
[55:32] wrote The Mystery of the Bible up in the
[55:35] Stars before he put it on parchment then
[55:38] we can see in there that there's certain
[55:40] ones that are chosen to be in certain
[55:43] things I like the constellations
[55:45] remember when you look up and one night
[55:47] last week was supposed to been one of
[55:48] the clearest nights and it was
[55:50] absolutely a beautiful night and Carol
[55:52] and I was out after dark and we was able
[55:53] to look up into the Stars absolutely
[55:56] incredible and I told her I said think
[55:58] of it these are the same stars that Adam
[56:01] saw exact same constellation that Moses
[56:04] saw when he was here the very same ones
[56:06] that Joshua saw the very same ones that
[56:09] the Lord Jesus when he looked up and he
[56:12] looked up at his handiwork when he was
[56:13] here and not one of them has moved a
[56:16] million miles you know when you look
[56:18] into the belt of Orion or you look into
[56:21] the stars and you see that there's a
[56:22] Nova Supernova that's down inside of
[56:25] there and the light the from there
[56:27] thousands of years ago that's coming to
[56:29] the Earth and it was the exact same one
[56:32] that was there when Caligula was the
[56:34] emperor of Rome when Nero was there as
[56:38] the emperor of Rome they looked up and
[56:41] saw that same thing and it was written
[56:44] there in the stars and God wrote that
[56:47] mystery himself so we can learn by it
[56:49] can we not so God chose them and yet
[56:52] it's not like one night you look at and
[56:55] there was a star that was was in the
[56:56] belt of a ran or the sword that hangs
[56:58] down on the side and then the next night
[57:01] you look at it it decided it don't want
[57:03] to be there no more it's of been in
[57:05] the belt so it moves over in tarus which
[57:08] is the sign of the bull and then the
[57:10] next night you look over and it winds up
[57:12] being in Leo the Lion no it's only
[57:15] people that do that come on church it's
[57:19] people that get tired of doing this and
[57:21] then they'll move around in the
[57:22] spiritual constellation of God that's
[57:25] why we need to pray about where we go to
[57:27] church church is not like picking out a
[57:29] grocery store and remember once you find
[57:32] that spot where God wants you the devil
[57:34] will do everything he can to move you
[57:36] from that God ordained place because if
[57:39] he can move the man in the home out of
[57:41] the will of God it can throw the entire
[57:44] home out of the divine order of God and
[57:47] you men will be responsible for that
[57:49] just keep that in mind and it's the same
[57:51] way with a pastor of a church or a
[57:53] preacher if God can be able to call a
[57:55] man and gift a man giving them element
[57:58] of influence and then cause that man to
[58:00] get out of the divine order of God and
[58:03] then maybe affect hundreds of people and
[58:05] that man will be responsible for it is
[58:08] that right so you look that unlike the
[58:10] Stars which are ordained then they've
[58:12] got a certain past and no doubt there's
[58:15] an element of variance that's made in
[58:17] their past because we know even the moon
[58:20] itself being an average of What 293 M
[58:22] th000 miles something like that from the
[58:24] Earth to Sun being an average of 93
[58:26] million miles and you know how it is
[58:28] that the sun can be brighter in the fall
[58:30] and the winter it'll about blind you if
[58:32] you're driving toward the East and the
[58:34] morning or toward the west in the
[58:35] evening is that right and it's actually
[58:38] closer to the Earth in the winter time
[58:40] by proximity be but because it tilts on
[58:43] its axis the Rays and stuff is further
[58:46] away and yet when you look at it God
[58:49] knew that the Earth in the beginning
[58:51] made it to stand up like this after the
[58:53] fall the Earth felt with it so the Earth
[58:56] felt to a tilt but God made it knowing
[58:59] that it would happen so there's an
[59:01] element of our life that the variables
[59:04] of degrees by which we have the perfect
[59:06] will of God and then we have the
[59:08] permissive will of God and all how each
[59:11] of us should seek and desire and hunger
[59:15] for that perfect will of God in our
[59:17] lives and the church said I personally
[59:20] don't desire do not want absolutely not
[59:23] the permissive will of God in my life I
[59:26] want the perfect will of
[59:28] God now watch let's look at Israel
[59:31] whenever God brings the Stars down on
[59:34] the earth and they begin to mirror the
[59:37] same thing because remember God told
[59:39] Abraham to look at the stars and then he
[59:41] told him to to look at the sand and then
[59:43] God tied the dust to the stars and the
[59:46] stars to the dust so he said so shall
[59:49] thy seed be on the earth so God and most
[59:53] even most people that don't believe in
[59:55] predestination we believe that Israel
[59:58] was the chosen people of God we believe
[1:00:01] that do or not so a lot of people that
[1:00:03] do not believe in predestination in the
[1:00:05] New Testament we believe that God chose
[1:00:08] Israel in the Old Testament I remember
[1:00:11] when the Bible was coming in the Old
[1:00:13] Testament God was mirroring what he was
[1:00:15] going to do after his deaths on the
[1:00:19] cross what's this in Exodus
[1:00:22] 19:3 and Moses went up to God and the
[1:00:25] Lord called unto him out of the mountain
[1:00:29] saying thus shalt thou say unto the
[1:00:32] house of Jacob and tell the children of
[1:00:35] Israel you have seen what I did unto the
[1:00:39] Egyptians and how I bear
[1:00:43] you on Eagle
[1:00:46] wings and brought you unto
[1:00:51] myself now what's what God is doing God
[1:00:54] is reminding Israel
[1:00:56] of their Exodus and what was their
[1:01:00] Exodus out of Egypt on an eagle's wings
[1:01:04] I many knows what that eagle's name was
[1:01:07] Moses now God used a prophet to call
[1:01:11] Israel out of Egypt and yet we know that
[1:01:16] were the Flesh of the Egyptian just the
[1:01:19] same as Israel's flesh yes as far as
[1:01:21] flesh it was but they were given a
[1:01:24] Divine promise of God they never chose
[1:01:27] God God chose them is that true and what
[1:01:31] did God do to cause this great Exodus he
[1:01:35] sent a prophet with a
[1:01:39] message now notice you have seen what I
[1:01:41] did unto the Egyptians and how I bear
[1:01:44] You On Eagle's Wings and brought you
[1:01:47] unto myself now God is going to separate
[1:01:52] Israel not only out of the land of Egypt
[1:01:55] but event you bring them to the land
[1:01:57] that was promised to their fathers and
[1:01:59] once they get there he is going to call
[1:02:02] them out from among all the rest of the
[1:02:05] nations of the earth he wants them to
[1:02:07] dress different you know God designated
[1:02:10] that so that whenever a Jew no matter if
[1:02:13] he was in Cyprus if he was in among the
[1:02:16] sirenians wherever the man was that they
[1:02:19] would be able to look at that man and
[1:02:21] know that man or that woman was a Jew
[1:02:24] because of the the way they dressed they
[1:02:27] would sit down and eat with them they
[1:02:29] would know that was a Jew why because of
[1:02:32] the dietary laws so they would see them
[1:02:35] pray they would see them as they would
[1:02:38] plant their Gardens and they would know
[1:02:40] that family was a Jewish family because
[1:02:43] a Jewish family was not allowed to seow
[1:02:46] diverse kinds of seed in their rows that
[1:02:49] have to have a single row of corn single
[1:02:51] row of peas single row of maters single
[1:02:53] row of ters and whatever more they knew
[1:02:56] that was a Jew because they could look
[1:02:58] at their garments and see there was not
[1:03:00] a mixture of wool and flax or Linen in
[1:03:04] the same garment now why would God do
[1:03:07] this because God is a god of Separation
[1:03:11] so by their language and they would have
[1:03:13] what was called a riband r i BB a n d a
[1:03:16] riband of blue on the bottom of their
[1:03:19] garment they would know they were Jewish
[1:03:22] so there was so many things about them
[1:03:25] that they could look and see why would
[1:03:27] God do that so people would ridicule
[1:03:29] them and make fun of them God wanted
[1:03:32] them separated to himself but can't you
[1:03:35] see how lead deia wants to be they want
[1:03:38] to claim the power of the Cross they
[1:03:40] want to claim Heaven they want to claim
[1:03:42] that they're going in the Rapture and
[1:03:44] the body change but they want to look
[1:03:46] like the world talk like the world act
[1:03:48] like the world come on somebody they
[1:03:51] don't want to be separated they don't
[1:03:53] want to be different they don't want to
[1:03:55] stand out from the world God's people
[1:03:58] have always stood out from the
[1:04:01] world I'm glad he's got some that still
[1:04:04] do today how I bear You On Eagle's Wings
[1:04:08] and brought you unto myself now
[1:04:11] therefore if ye will obey my voice
[1:04:14] indeed and keep my Covenant then ye
[1:04:18] shall be a
[1:04:21] pecul wow pecul
[1:04:29] treasure A peculiar treasure look at the
[1:04:33] word peculiar it means
[1:04:36] possession valued
[1:04:39] property peculiar treasure so peculiar
[1:04:44] treasure is a costly possession acquired
[1:04:49] with
[1:04:50] exertion and carefully guarded carefully
[1:04:56] reserved as the richest treasure among
[1:05:00] men even as The Treasure of princes
[1:05:05] consisting of gold and silver precious
[1:05:09] stones pearls and jewels now notice they
[1:05:13] did not choose God to be the pecul hey
[1:05:17] God we we want to be your peculiar
[1:05:19] people we desire to be your peculiar
[1:05:22] treasure notice where this is placed he
[1:05:25] chose
[1:05:27] them well let me just remind you today
[1:05:29] Word of Life you never Co chose God God
[1:05:33] chose
[1:05:35] you so in reality what I made up my mind
[1:05:39] I'm quitting uh your choice don't really
[1:05:41] matter Hallelujah God ain't leaving it
[1:05:45] up to me God ain't leaving it up to you
[1:05:48] he chose as
[1:05:50] himself now watch God said if you will
[1:05:53] obey my voice indeed and keep my
[1:05:54] Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar
[1:05:57] treasure unto me above all people for
[1:06:02] all the Earth is mine now once again the
[1:06:07] mirror is taking place to where the
[1:06:10] stars the path of the stars is being
[1:06:13] reflected on the people on the Earth
[1:06:16] that are hearing the creator of the
[1:06:19] heavens identify them with Earth notice
[1:06:23] again in Exodus 19:6 and ye shall be
[1:06:26] unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy
[1:06:32] nation these are the words which Thou
[1:06:35] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[1:06:40] so now God is using the mouth of a
[1:06:43] prophet to relate God's special design
[1:06:47] and choice for the children of Israel
[1:06:50] and it comes through the prophet's
[1:06:53] message to help the people to see this
[1:06:56] now he never exactly told Abraham this
[1:06:59] he never exactly told Isaac or Jacob
[1:07:01] these words because the Revelation is
[1:07:04] now growing to what God wants them to be
[1:07:08] so who does he use the word comes only
[1:07:11] to a
[1:07:12] prophet not to a pastor not to a teacher
[1:07:15] not to an evangelist so God speaks these
[1:07:19] words this is the message of that day so
[1:07:22] God is letting them know that they will
[1:07:25] be a kingdom of priests now remember not
[1:07:28] a priesthood but a kingdom of priests
[1:07:32] and a holy nation these are the words
[1:07:35] which Thou shalt speak unto the children
[1:07:38] of Israel Deuteronomy 7:6 for thou art a
[1:07:43] holy people unto the Lord thy God look
[1:07:47] at the word holy sacred Saint set apart
[1:07:52] a holy people saint that's amazing
[1:07:56] because the Hebrew and the Greek and the
[1:07:58] way this ties together this word is very
[1:08:00] very similar when it comes to the New
[1:08:02] Testament so it's really special to be
[1:08:04] called a saint of God a Sanctified one
[1:08:07] cesh which means one that is called
[1:08:10] apart from everybody else now keep in
[1:08:13] mind it's already written up there that
[1:08:16] little tiny blue dot the only one that
[1:08:20] has horses and cows and pigs and all
[1:08:23] this sort of thing by whom by God so God
[1:08:27] put it in the past so it could receive
[1:08:30] of his great benefits now here God is
[1:08:33] saying about a people I'm going to call
[1:08:35] you out to myself for thou art Unholy
[1:08:41] people unto the Lord thy God the Lord
[1:08:45] thy God hath chosen thee to be a
[1:08:50] special people unto himself special
[1:08:56] possession peculiar treasure literally
[1:09:00] to be to him for a people of property a
[1:09:06] people his own his
[1:09:10] peculiar
[1:09:11] property you can see why typical Le toan
[1:09:16] will never be able to be
[1:09:18] this they're going to do what they want
[1:09:20] to do when they want to do it and there
[1:09:23] ain't nobody going to tell them no
[1:09:24] different now they want to go to church
[1:09:27] many of them do they're religious and
[1:09:28] they want to go to church but they don't
[1:09:30] want you telling them what kind of
[1:09:32] clothes to wear how they've got to do
[1:09:34] this and do that and the other all they
[1:09:36] want is a preacher that preaches greasy
[1:09:38] Grace and they can get by with anything
[1:09:40] and everything they want to do they
[1:09:42] don't want no dos and no don'ts come on
[1:09:45] somebody they don't want no you can't do
[1:09:47] this and you can't do that and you can't
[1:09:50] go here and you can't say this all they
[1:09:52] want is freedom to do whatever they want
[1:09:55] to do and then when they die they all go
[1:09:58] flying away to Heaven they live like the
[1:10:01] devil they acted like the devil they
[1:10:03] cuss they drink they lie they cheat they
[1:10:05] steal and when they die they all wind up
[1:10:08] going to heaven that is a lie you only
[1:10:12] walk down the streets of gold if you are
[1:10:16] living a life worthy of the
[1:10:21] Gospel praise the
[1:10:24] Lord now now God says now you imagine
[1:10:27] these adjectives that God is using thou
[1:10:29] art a holy people now this did not mean
[1:10:32] they were a sinless people or without
[1:10:35] mistake but they were called apart set
[1:10:39] aside set aside for God the Lord thy God
[1:10:44] ha chosen thee to be a special people
[1:10:48] unto himself above all people as the
[1:10:52] Earth is chosen above all the other
[1:10:57] planets it doesn't really matter if Mars
[1:10:59] is jealous or not it doesn't matter if
[1:11:02] Saturn gets M say well my goodness my
[1:11:05] name ain't even in the Bible Uranus can
[1:11:07] say my name is not even in the Bible
[1:11:10] Pluto say I'm jealous my name is nowh
[1:11:13] written in the Bible the Earth's name is
[1:11:15] the only planet written in the word of
[1:11:19] Goden well praise the Lord neither can
[1:11:22] Earth say oh look at who I am and look
[1:11:25] at what I am I am so special I am so
[1:11:29] loved and you are because God was the
[1:11:31] one who loved you neither can we go
[1:11:34] around with a stuck out chest and her
[1:11:37] head kick back oh my looking down on
[1:11:39] other people if you are part of the
[1:11:42] Bride you ought to be so grateful you
[1:11:45] ought to be so happy that God himself
[1:11:48] chose
[1:11:51] you above
[1:11:53] all people
[1:11:56] that are on the
[1:11:58] face of the
[1:12:02] Earth how many believes this to be God's
[1:12:04] word how many believes he's the same
[1:12:07] yesterday today and
[1:12:11] forever so it could choose people in the
[1:12:13] Old Testament and make them above all
[1:12:16] the rest of the people and then comes in
[1:12:18] the New Testament somehow Brother D and
[1:12:20] God got saved well when Jesus died God
[1:12:23] got saved and God got he really got you
[1:12:26] know worked over and really got changed
[1:12:27] and everything and now God don't
[1:12:29] practice that that evil thing of
[1:12:31] predestination predestination ain't evil
[1:12:33] in the first
[1:12:36] place notice in Deuteronomy 7:7 the
[1:12:41] Lord did not set his love upon you nor
[1:12:46] choose
[1:12:47] you because you were more in in number
[1:12:52] than any people for ye
[1:12:55] were the
[1:12:57] fewest of all
[1:13:01] people so where's them great big things
[1:13:03] they did where's them great big things
[1:13:05] we
[1:13:06] do but because
[1:13:09] Hallelujah the
[1:13:12] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[1:13:18] the
[1:13:19] oath which he had sworn unto your
[1:13:22] fathers hath the Lord brought you you
[1:13:25] out with a mighty hand and redeemed you
[1:13:28] out of the house AB bondman somebody
[1:13:31] ought to be praising the Lord with me
[1:13:33] that's the very reason the Lord God
[1:13:36] called us out in this last day not
[1:13:39] because we're great people not because
[1:13:42] we're wonderful people not because our
[1:13:45] human character surpasses everybody else
[1:13:48] if it was not for the grace of God many
[1:13:51] of you'd be out drunk this morning or
[1:13:54] trying to get some cure from a headache
[1:13:56] that you had because you drunk last
[1:13:58] night you'd be looking for another shot
[1:14:01] in your arm you'd be running around with
[1:14:03] somebody else's wife or somebody else's
[1:14:06] husband come on children let's have
[1:14:08] church today I'll tell you why you said
[1:14:11] here today if you love Jesus Christ with
[1:14:14] all of your heart it's because the Lord
[1:14:17] God chose you not because you're special
[1:14:21] not because you are good but because he
[1:14:25] is mighty He is wonderful and he gives
[1:14:29] Grace To whom he will give
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:38] it
[1:14:40] woo know therefore that the Lord thy
[1:14:44] God he is God the faithful God which
[1:14:49] keepeth Covenant and mercy with them

[1:16:08] Lord God chose William bradam to be the
[1:16:11] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and there ain't

[1:19:08] forsaken me and Hell Rejoice no doubt
[1:19:11] prematurely because they thought that
[1:19:14] Miracle Worker that sign worker that man
[1:19:17] that could walk on water now he's died
[1:19:19] like any other man and the devil
[1:19:22] probably thought boys we have defeated
[1:19:24] did him until a knock come down on
[1:19:27] Hell's
[1:19:29] door and when the knock come down on
[1:19:32] Hell's door and the door was answered
[1:19:35] and they realized there was the Alpha
[1:19:38] and the Omega the beginning and the end

[1:19:45] God that brought Israel out of Egypt had
[1:19:48] now come down to deliver his people with
[1:19:52] outstretched arms
[1:20:01] Deuteronomy
[1:20:02] 328 when the most
[1:20:06] high this is absolutely amazing to me
[1:20:10] when the most high divided the
[1:20:14] Nations their
[1:20:18] inheritance when he separated the
[1:20:21] sons of Adam
[1:20:27] he set the
[1:20:28] bounds of the
[1:20:31] people according to the
[1:20:34] number of the children of
[1:20:39] Israel it wasn't first come first
[1:20:43] serve it's Those whom he
[1:20:47] loved so you imagine the sons of Adam
[1:20:51] when God was dispersing them and sending
[1:20:54] them toward mishek and tubal and all the
[1:20:58] different places that God dispersed
[1:21:02] them God's divine
[1:21:05] order the measuring tape that God
[1:21:10] used was
[1:21:13] election the election according to
[1:21:18] Israel so from the naval of the Earth
[1:21:25] as Jews the Jews call
[1:21:29] Jerusalem the naval of the
[1:21:32] Earth from the naval of the
[1:21:35] earth God measured that way and that way
[1:21:38] and that way and that
[1:21:42] way it wasn't how big Russia
[1:21:45] was it wasn't how great Lisbon Portugal
[1:21:48] was it wasn't how great the Spanish were
[1:21:50] in Spain but God's measuring tape was

[1:22:13] uses in the last day the measuring tape

[1:22:19] measuring the people of the world by how
[1:22:22] much space do we need I'll tell you one
[1:22:24] of the Reas reason why that the life's
[1:22:26] day and the scientific things are the
[1:22:28] way they are because God knew we was
[1:22:31] going to need to reach the people around
[1:22:33] the world we couldn't just send brother
[1:22:35] Daryl on a boat the way that Paul
[1:22:38] traveled on but we needed the message to

[1:23:22] Nations their inheritance
[1:23:25] when he separated the sons of
[1:23:28] Adam he set the bounds of the people
[1:23:31] according to the number of the
[1:23:34] children of
[1:23:38] Israel Deuteronomy

[1:24:41] Stars I don't want
[1:24:43] constellations I want

[1:25:37] part cuz he sees
[1:25:40] us as we really

[1:25:50] God for the Lord's portion is his people
[1:25:55] Jacob is the
[1:25:59] lot of his
[1:26:03] inheritance you got to be kidding me
[1:26:08] Moses would use him in his deceiver
[1:26:16] name Moses never even wrote his new
[1:26:20] name Israel Prince
[1:26:24] don't you say it magnifies the grace of
[1:26:30] God in his Jacob
[1:26:35] form God says he's
[1:26:38] mine Jacob is the
[1:26:43] lot of his
[1:26:45] inheritance he found him in a desert
[1:26:48] land and then the waste howling
[1:26:51] Wilderness that's where he found us was
[1:26:53] it brother Steve
[1:26:56] he leted him
[1:26:57] about he instructed him he kept him as
[1:27:04] the
[1:27:04] apple of his eye well I'd like to take
[1:27:08] them threes sometimes he led him about
[1:27:11] he instructed him and he kept him as the
[1:27:14] apple of his eye this is a Hebrew
[1:27:17] idiom which is not an apple hanging on a
[1:27:20] tree but it's actually the pupil in your
[1:27:23] ey
[1:27:25] so it's not something external from
[1:27:28] yourself it's a part of you it's a part
[1:27:31] of who you
[1:27:33] are oh my I was standing in front of a
[1:27:37] mirror the other day and it was one of
[1:27:39] these lighted mirrors and I was combing
[1:27:42] my
[1:27:43] hair and as I I'd wash my hair and I'd
[1:27:46] combing my hair and blowing it dry and
[1:27:49] as I stood in that mirror I saw the
[1:27:52] reflection of that lighted mirror in my
[1:27:54] eyes so in my pupils were two
[1:27:59] square light
[1:28:01] Rings one in this eye and one in that
[1:28:05] eye and what I was looking
[1:28:08] at I saw
[1:28:10] myself but I also saw what was helping
[1:28:14] me to see myself and where was it
[1:28:17] reflecting not on my fingers not on my
[1:28:20] hands my skin because there's nothing
[1:28:22] there to reflect it but I saw what I was
[1:28:25] looking at in my eyes don't you
[1:28:29] understand why we needed a profit in the
[1:28:31] last days that God could bring the eyes
[1:28:36] back on the earth that the eyes could be
[1:28:40] able to say I no longer call you church
[1:28:43] but I call you bride Hallelujah and the
[1:28:47] eyes could tell us you were with him
[1:28:50] before the foundation of the world he
[1:28:53] loved you he called you by name and the
[1:28:56] more we look into that we can say daddy
[1:29:01] that's
[1:29:04] me that's
[1:29:13] me he found him in a
[1:29:17] desert land and in a waste howling
[1:29:22] Wilderness he let him about he
[1:29:25] instructed him he kept him as the apple
[1:29:29] of his eye First Kings 8 50 Solomon's
[1:29:34] dedication prayer of the
[1:29:37] temple and forgive thy people that have
[1:29:40] sinned against thee and all the
[1:29:43] transgressions wherein they have
[1:29:45] transgressed against thee and give them
[1:29:48] compassion before them who carried them
[1:29:52] captive that they may have have
[1:29:55] compassion on
[1:29:57] them I found that so amazing and looking
[1:29:59] at that yesterday that Solomon not only
[1:30:01] prayed for the compassion of God but he
[1:30:03] prayed that God would move on the hearts
[1:30:05] of the other people that was against
[1:30:07] them that they also would be able to
[1:30:09] give them compassion as
[1:30:11] well for they be thy
[1:30:15] people and thine inheritance which thou
[1:30:18] brought us forth out of Egypt from the
[1:30:21] midst of the Furnace of iron
[1:30:24] that thine eyes may be open unto the
[1:30:27] supplication of thy servant unto the
[1:30:30] supplication of thy People Israel to
[1:30:32] hearken unto them and all that they call
[1:30:36] For unto thee for thou did US separate
[1:30:40] them from among all the people of the
[1:30:43] earth notice as God separated the Earth
[1:30:47] so he separated
[1:30:48] Israel to be thine inheritance
[1:30:54] as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy
[1:30:57] servant when thou brought us out our
[1:31:00] fathers out of Egypt oh Lord

[1:31:30] God and our Savior Jesus

[1:39:32] years and years ago one of the greatest
[1:39:34] challenges the bribe will have in the
[1:39:36] last days is believing what God said
[1:39:38] about her or what she knows about
[1:39:41] herself and her
[1:39:43] humanity and some of you let the devil
[1:39:46] constantly beat you down and whip you
[1:39:48] down even make you question if you've
[1:39:50] got the Holy Ghost if you're born again
[1:39:52] and because there's something in you
[1:39:53] longing for more and you think you're
[1:39:55] longing for the Holy Ghost it ain't
[1:39:59] that that's all a part of perfection is
[1:40:02] in you longing for a perfect world a
[1:40:05] perfect walk and you're thinking God
[1:40:07] maybe there's something in me there's
[1:40:09] lacking there's something lacking in me
[1:40:11] it's not that it's lacking it's one of
[1:40:13] the best signs in the world that you've
[1:40:15] got it how could Perfection that was not
[1:40:19] in you long for perfection in another
[1:40:21] world
[1:40:24] thanks be to
[1:40:27] God
[1:40:31] hallelujah aren't you glad we've been
[1:40:33] called out of
[1:40:36] Darkness we've got a sister that's going

[1:40:55] sit right there on this
[1:40:58] side cuz she want to be delivered of
[1:41:00] something else she's dealing with she
[1:41:03] turned in the testimony here the other
[1:41:05] day the same God that took the drugs
[1:41:08] away from her took the thirst of smoking
[1:41:10] away from her that's
[1:41:14] God what an acenta we can't do it she
[1:41:16] couldn't do it
[1:41:19] herself
[1:41:21] Hallelujah what's it doing
[1:41:24] calling people out of
[1:41:26] Darkness them things that bound them and
[1:41:29] Satan thought I've got them I've got
[1:41:31] them and maybe some of our family and
[1:41:32] our loved ones we think Lord brother
[1:41:34] Donnie they've lived so often and
[1:41:35] they've said some of the aest things
[1:41:37] about the message ever was as long as
[1:41:38] they've got a breast in there there's a
[1:41:40] hope for them there ain't none of us got
[1:41:42] a predestinated magnifying glass where
[1:41:45] we can look and see if they're ordained
[1:41:46] or not God will give Grace who he wants
[1:41:48] to who are you and I to say they can't
[1:41:50] have
[1:41:51] it I've spent my whole life trying to
[1:41:56] get people saved I've spent my whole
[1:41:58] life trying to get people in church
[1:42:02] trying to get people closer to God I
[1:42:05] ain't giving up
[1:42:06] now I don't care if the sorest drunk
[1:42:09] that in Johnson City comes in here that
[1:42:12] man will come in and sit down this I
[1:42:13] figure this is one of the best places in
[1:42:15] the city for him to come and get saved
[1:42:17] and get filled with the Holy Ghost maybe
[1:42:19] your son maybe your daughter and all

[1:43:04] hour
[1:43:06] Hallelujah let's bow our heads
[1:43:14] together Lord God we're such a
[1:43:16] privileged
[1:43:20] People Help Us father
[1:43:25] Lord I know when the
[1:43:27] prophet read his text and gave his
[1:43:31] title is your the life worthy of the
[1:43:35] gospel and he talks about the last
[1:43:40] pool before the
[1:43:42] supper was to the blind the lame the
[1:43:45] halt the
[1:43:48] crippled well here we are Lord Jesus
[1:43:50] many of us been saved and in church for
[1:43:52] years and years
[1:43:55] help us not to be so Pious and so holy
[1:43:59] as we think we are
[1:44:02] sometimes that we'd be afraid to reach
[1:44:04] out our hand to some man or some
[1:44:08] woman Lord
[1:44:10] God they might not smell so
[1:44:13] good they might even be
[1:44:16] homeless may not have enough money to
[1:44:18] buy thems a meal but how do we know some
[1:44:21] of these homeless people around John
[1:44:23] City here might be the last one that'll
[1:44:26] come that's
[1:44:28] right help us Lord we don't have to hand
[1:44:31] them out a book we don't have to give
[1:44:32] them a seven seal book or a church age
[1:44:35] we could start with a
[1:44:37] smile we could start with a kind
[1:44:40] word as we go through the
[1:44:43] drive-thru and we order a Big Mac and
[1:44:46] they get us a fish Fil-A we order a
[1:44:49] Sprite they give us pumpkin
[1:44:52] juice now we can get
[1:44:55] mad or we can go through with the spirit
[1:44:57] of
[1:44:59] Christ and Let Jesus Express his love
[1:45:03] through the drive-thru the way he does
[1:45:05] in a message PE after
[1:45:09] all if the only good they're getting out
[1:45:11] of this church coming to church is what
[1:45:14] they have here and it don't live beyond
[1:45:16] here I am a complete
[1:45:20] failure we want Jesus to be on display
[1:45:24] on our jobs and our homes and our
[1:45:28] workplace
[1:45:29] Lord help us
[1:45:32] father A peculiar people a chosen
[1:45:38] people you purchased my
[1:45:41] right to be in divine
[1:45:44] order I believe I've been in my place
[1:45:47] for
[1:45:48] years I'm not really praying to get in
[1:45:51] my place but now I'm praying to stay in
[1:45:56] it help a lot of these people to realize
[1:45:58] it's not so much that they're trying to
[1:46:00] find
[1:46:01] it it's just staying where you've put
[1:46:05] them help us Lord Jesus I
[1:46:09] pray with every head bowed today I
[1:46:11] wonder how many of you would like to say
[1:46:13] God please help me maybe some of you're
[1:46:15] searching I know you are you come up for
[1:46:17] prayer some of our young people getting
[1:46:19] out of high school going into college
[1:46:21] whatever more and they're searching for
[1:46:22] their their place and what does God want
[1:46:24] them to be searching for a boyfriend a
[1:46:26] girlfriend a husband or a wife and
[1:46:28] they're searching for their position but
[1:46:30] some of you no doubt by the grace of God
[1:46:32] you've been able to find
[1:46:35] it but today your need is God help me
[1:46:38] that I'll stay there help me that I'll
[1:46:40] not get out of my
[1:46:42] place and if Satan comes to me with a
[1:46:45] supernatural offer which remember the
[1:46:48] prophet told us in Harvest time he would
[1:46:50] do
[1:46:51] that for those those of us who believe
[1:46:53] in the
[1:46:54] Supernatural Satan has all types of
[1:46:57] Supernatural
[1:46:59] offers that he will offer
[1:47:02] you to seduce you out of your
[1:47:05] position brother B said he may let you
[1:47:08] prophesy and it be contrary to the word
[1:47:12] he may let you speak in tongues not God
[1:47:15] the
[1:47:16] devil the devil offer you a supernatural
[1:47:20] offer to let you speak in tongues
[1:47:23] or prophesy and prophesy contrary to the
[1:47:27] word but because it would seem like a
[1:47:31] new planet a new place to start a new
[1:47:33] civilization a new
[1:47:35] world don't think your battle will stop
[1:47:39] just because you get in your
[1:47:42] place but it just begins in defending it
[1:47:46] and holding it how many of Christians
[1:47:49] say God help me keep me instruct me my
[1:47:54] hands are up
[1:47:56] Lord the Bible gives us
[1:47:59] warning If any man thinks he
[1:48:03] stand let him take
[1:48:05] heed lest he
[1:48:09] fall Lord God help me keep me
[1:48:14] Jesus keep me in my place
[1:48:18] Lord hide me oh God in the covert of
[1:48:21] your wings

[1:48:29] 50s way up now in my
[1:48:33] 60s how much every time I've got left
[1:48:36] Lord I want you to have every
[1:48:40] day I don't understand it but sometimes
[1:48:42] when preachers get
[1:48:44] older it's when they leave and get off
[1:48:46] the word Keep Me Jesus please
[1:48:50] Lord if you'd see some where I'd go to
[1:48:53] leave get off the word and be a
[1:48:55] stumbling block to your
[1:48:57] people if I'd get stubborn and
[1:48:59] hard-headed and can't be corrected take
[1:49:02] me out of this world father if you have
[1:49:06] to I don't want to be a hindrance to
[1:49:09] your

[1:49:18] from the pulpit here to the back to the
