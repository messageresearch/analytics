[38:33] the Lord Jesus Christ and we counted
[38:34] just an honor to be with you here this
[38:36] morning
[38:38] certainly enjoyed the time that we had
[38:40] hunting last week and just to be out in
[38:42] the woods and see nature and it's just I
[38:45] just love nature and to watch the
[38:48] animals and the leaves and
[38:50] it didn't didn't score any game but we
[38:52] sure had a wonderful time and appreciate
[38:54] brother Daniel allowing us to go with
[38:55] him
[38:56] I want to read now from Numbers chapter
[38:58] 21 starting at version one do you love
[39:00] him
[39:06] yeah I got a little unusual text this
[39:07] morning but we trust the Lord will just
[39:09] help us
[39:11] numbers 21 1 and when the king of the
[39:13] raid the Canaanite which dwelt in the
[39:16] South heard tell that Israel came by the
[39:18] way of the spies
[39:19] then he fought against Israel and took
[39:21] some of them prisoners
[39:23] and Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord and
[39:25] said if thou will indeed deliver this
[39:26] people into my hand then I will utterly
[39:29] destroy their cities
[39:31] and the Lord hearken to the voice of
[39:33] Israel and delivered up the Canaanites
[39:35] and they utterly destroyed them and
[39:38] their cities and he called the name of
[39:40] the place
[39:41] hormac
[39:43] and they journeyed from Mount hor by the
[39:46] way of the Red Sea to Compass the land
[39:48] of Eden
[39:49] and the soul of the people was much
[39:52] discouraged
[39:54] because
[39:56] of the way
[39:58] The Souls of the people was much
[40:00] discouraged because
[40:03] of the way
[40:05] thus power heads
[40:07] I want to speak on that a few minutes
[40:08] this morning if the Lord to help us now
[40:10] I want to speak on this thought of the
[40:12] antidote
[40:13] for discouragement
[40:17] Heavenly Father
[40:22] Lord we are so grateful that we can feel
[40:25] you in our hearts Lord
[40:28] father I know that we don't base these
[40:30] things up on feeling
[40:32] but I do know Lord It's good to feel you
[40:35] and we want to thank you dear God for
[40:37] the opportunity that we've been given
[40:39] as such an hour of Darkness
[40:42] to be your children of light
[40:44] father I pray this morning that you
[40:46] would come Lord and take this thought as
[40:49] we realize Dear God
[40:51] we are living in such a discouraging
[40:53] time
[40:54] but Lord you have given us an antidote
[40:56] for that
[40:58] and so father I pray that you would just
[41:00] help us this morning to get ourself out
[41:01] of the way that you could take this and
[41:03] bring it to your people as you put it up
[41:05] on a heart this week Lord as we was
[41:07] thinking on these things
[41:09] and now Lord I come before you for the
[41:11] needs of our children
[41:13] there's many of them sick Lord and
[41:15] Afflicted and some in the hospital
[41:17] and Lord there are little ones that we
[41:19] love them
[41:20] and I asked your God that you would move
[41:23] and bring them forth well
[41:25] oh God may we take this power of prayer
[41:29] that's been given into our hand
[41:31] may we sling it against the enemy dear
[41:33] God and may he be defeated by the faith
[41:36] that lays within the promises of your
[41:38] word
[41:39] the Lord you see the other needs that
[41:41] are Among Us Lord may you just move for
[41:43] each person today
[41:44] and Lord if they would be some here
[41:46] discouraged may they draw strength from
[41:48] this word today
[41:49] that we may leave Lord that people not
[41:51] discouraged but of people encouraged by
[41:54] the promises of your word bless your
[41:57] people today Lord bless brother Donnie
[41:59] and his family as they travel Lord to
[42:00] rest a few days may you just Comfort
[42:02] them Lord we pray
[42:04] those other needs around us father
[42:05] brother Michael Teagan in the hospital
[42:07] Lord From the accident help our brother
[42:09] Lord we pray and others on our prayer
[42:12] list Dear God
[42:13] but you just move for him Lord
[42:15] that's just the kind of God you are to
[42:17] do these things for us
[42:19] and we ask it in the name of the Lord
[42:20] Jesus for thy glory and the Saints said
[42:23] amen may God bless you may be seated
[42:31] amen
[42:33] you know I still believe God
[42:36] squeeze a man's heart and the juice
[42:37] comes out his eyes
[42:40] amen
[42:42] but you know discouraged by definition
[42:46] it means having lost confidence
[42:49] or enthusiasm to be disheartened
[42:54] so discouragement is the condition of
[42:57] being discouraged
[42:59] and Times of discouragement comes to us
[43:03] all of us whether you're a husband or
[43:06] whether you're a wife a man or a woman a
[43:08] boy or a girl a preacher or a lay member
[43:10] a pastor or a prophet discouragement is
[43:13] something that everyone faces not just
[43:17] one time
[43:18] but all through the Journey We have
[43:20] dealt and we will deal with times of
[43:25] discouragement
[43:26] and there's many things that causes
[43:28] discouragement
[43:29] sickness causes discouragement whether
[43:32] it be your own personal sickness or the
[43:34] sickness of a family member that is just
[43:36] day in and day out of dealing with
[43:39] negative reports and dealing with blood
[43:40] work and this and that it brings many
[43:43] times discouragement
[43:45] Hard Times brings discouragement
[43:49] disappointments brings discouragement
[43:53] failures brings discouragement
[43:56] events that happens in our life that we
[43:59] have absolutely no control over brings
[44:02] discouragement
[44:04] when things just don't work out like we
[44:07] thought they should work out
[44:10] many times it brings discouragement
[44:14] but arimp said many times when there's a
[44:16] blessing laying right ahead
[44:18] the devil tries everything he can to
[44:21] discourage us
[44:23] and if you notice it's when you are
[44:24] discouraged that's when the devil can
[44:27] really pour it on you
[44:30] that's when he gets you is when you're
[44:33] discouraged so what does Satan desire
[44:36] for every one of us in this building
[44:37] this morning his desire for us is to be
[44:40] discouraged he don't care if you come to
[44:43] church if you set like you're dead he
[44:45] don't care if you come to church and and
[44:46] paint the barn while you're sitting here
[44:48] he don't care if you come to church and
[44:50] you're so discouraged you can hardly
[44:51] lift up your that's the way he wants you
[44:53] to come he don't want you to come here
[44:55] and encourage you don't want you coming
[44:56] here looking at the promise of God knows
[44:58] that no matter what I face today I serve
[45:00] a god who's able to do something about
[45:02] it amen
[45:04] well when we come through those doors
[45:06] knowing who we are knowing where we come
[45:07] from and knowing where we're going then
[45:09] we have the authority Amen to put Satan
[45:12] down
[45:14] Hallelujah
[45:15] amen it's when you're discouraged that
[45:17] the devil can really pour it on you
[45:19] that's when he gets you
[45:21] if he can get you discouraged then
[45:24] you're disheartened you lose enthusiasm
[45:27] you lose confidence and then you forget
[45:31] the promise
[45:34] you forget the promise as long as you're
[45:37] looking at the symptom you're not seeing
[45:39] the solution
[45:41] as long as you're looking at the problem
[45:43] you're not seeing the answer as long as
[45:45] you're staggering in the darkness you're
[45:46] not enjoying the light
[45:50] so if he can get you discouraged you
[45:52] lose your enthusiasm
[45:54] you're disheartened you lose your
[45:57] confidence oh maybe none of us here will
[46:00] deny that God's A Healer but we lose our
[46:02] confidence that God can heal me
[46:10] the prophet said those discouraging
[46:13] times
[46:14] comes to every believer
[46:17] to test you and try you and see if you
[46:21] really do believe
[46:23] every son that cometh to God must first
[46:26] be tested and child trained there'll be
[46:30] some of you here tonight no doubt we'll
[46:32] go through that same
[46:35] testing
[46:37] times
[46:38] of discouragement
[46:40] amen and that's what we see in our
[46:43] scripture reading this morning
[46:45] a discouraging time came to Israel
[46:49] you see Israel they were on their
[46:52] pilgrimage from the land of Egypt to
[46:55] Canaan and God told them I have already
[46:58] gave you the land
[47:01] not could be not hope so not maybe and I
[47:04] don't know if it'll work or not no God
[47:06] said it's already done
[47:09] and if you can realize this morning in
[47:11] God's thoughts you have already raptured
[47:15] and God's thoughts this morning we have
[47:17] already made it
[47:20] Hallelujah he wrote our name in his book
[47:23] before the foundation of the world why
[47:26] would he do that unless he knew you
[47:27] would be there
[47:31] amen
[47:33] I've already gave you the land that was
[47:36] a promise and God keeps his promise
[47:41] not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times
[47:45] out of the hundred God will keep a
[47:48] promise he's made to his children
[47:52] it's not that God's lacking the promise
[47:54] it's that we get discouraged and failed
[47:57] to act on it
[48:00] and no doubt Israel expected that this
[48:03] Faith Journey would be easy
[48:08] a straight walk to the promised land
[48:13] after all look what he just done in
[48:15] Egypt he utterly destroyed Egypt
[48:20] and here they came with The God Who
[48:22] capped every one of the Egyptian gods
[48:25] had showed Egypt there is no God but me
[48:31] so they thought oh my this is going to
[48:33] be a cakewalk
[48:34] we're going to the promised land God
[48:37] gave us a prophet God gave us a message
[48:39] God has called us out of the bondage of
[48:42] Egypt
[48:43] we're going to the promised land
[48:47] but you see
[48:49] God never promised to move sailing
[48:53] he never promised that but the promise
[48:55] that he gave them was I've already given
[48:59] you the land
[49:01] but he never said
[49:03] how they was going to get there
[49:08] he never said that he just said I've
[49:11] only it's a good land I have already
[49:13] given you the land but he never said
[49:16] this is how you'll get there
[49:18] he just said you're going there
[49:23] amen
[49:24] will glory
[49:25] and every time they hit a bump in the
[49:28] road as we say
[49:30] they would become discouraged and they
[49:33] would murmur and they would complain
[49:36] against God
[49:38] and the life of the Israelites took a
[49:41] turn to the worst when the king of
[49:43] Edmund refused to let them travel
[49:46] through the Bible said was the King's
[49:49] Highway
[49:50] because his land was between them and
[49:53] the promised land and it would have been
[49:55] much easier to pass through this man's
[49:58] land to get to the promised land that
[50:00] God gave them so they approached this
[50:02] King and said look can we come through
[50:04] your land we won't go through your
[50:06] Vineyards we won't go through your
[50:08] fields we won't drink your water we just
[50:10] want to walk the King's Highway to the
[50:13] promised land
[50:16] and if by chance one of our cattle
[50:19] drinks or water or one of our people
[50:21] drinks your water we will gladly pay you
[50:24] for the water we drink we're not asking
[50:27] for a handout we're just simply asking
[50:29] let us pass through your land
[50:34] and the King
[50:36] the king refused to let them pass
[50:42] he said if you come to my land we will
[50:45] attack you
[50:47] stay away
[50:49] go some other way to get to where you're
[50:51] going you're not coming through here
[50:55] what discouraging words to hear
[51:02] when there's a pathway right through
[51:03] there and they said no
[51:05] can't go but but it's right nope
[51:08] how much
[51:11] go around
[51:13] enjoy the walk
[51:15] have a good trip
[51:17] and the Bible said when they turned it
[51:19] from now or by the way of the Red Sea to
[51:21] go around the land of Eden because they
[51:24] would not let him go through there The
[51:26] Souls of the people was much discouraged
[51:29] because of the way of their Journey
[51:35] oh my you see that was this pathway it
[51:38] was the Bible says it was the King's
[51:41] Highway not a footpath a highway
[51:44] and yet they couldn't walk on the King's
[51:47] Highway he refused to let them come
[51:50] so the Bible said they had to go around
[51:52] this way by the Red Sea to go around the
[51:56] land of Edmund and The Souls of the
[51:58] people was much discouraged because of
[52:01] the way
[52:02] and they were forced to travel into a
[52:05] Barren mountainous Rocky dry desert
[52:12] these were the chosen people of God
[52:16] he told Moses tell Pharaoh Israel is my
[52:21] son
[52:23] thus saith the Lord let my son go
[52:29] I have come to deliver I didn't come to
[52:33] steal his slaves I come to deliver my
[52:36] heritage
[52:40] this was God's chosen people led by a
[52:43] pillar of fire a cloud that day a pillar
[52:46] of Fire by night my God that's pretty
[52:48] good
[52:51] and God could have destroyed the king of
[52:53] Edmond just like he did the Egyptian
[52:56] Army
[52:57] is that not true if he could do it to
[52:59] Egypt could he not do it to Edom
[53:04] but God chose not to do it
[53:09] God allowed Eden
[53:11] to give Israel a hard
[53:14] time
[53:18] think about that for a minute God's
[53:21] chosen people led by a pillar of fire
[53:24] and yet he allowed this King
[53:26] to give his people
[53:28] a hard
[53:30] time
[53:33] he allowed him to give Israel a hard
[53:35] time
[53:36] see it was it was God
[53:39] it was God who led Israel around this
[53:42] Edomite Nation
[53:44] what was God doing he was leading his
[53:47] people to the Fulfillment of the promise
[53:51] you said brother why am I going through
[53:53] this why am I dealing with this it's God
[53:55] leading you to the Fulfillment of his
[53:57] promise I am the Lord thy God who either
[54:00] thee
[54:02] is he in controller is he not in control
[54:05] is he Our God or is he not our God
[54:11] it was God leading his people to the
[54:13] Fulfillment of the promise
[54:16] and discouragement came
[54:20] when God's directions
[54:22] did not meet
[54:24] their expectations
[54:28] oh you're quiet this morning but I guess
[54:30] you're listening
[54:32] foreign
[54:33] discouragement came
[54:36] when their expectations
[54:38] did not agree
[54:40] with God's directions
[54:44] well I thought certainly he would do
[54:46] this I guess he don't love me I guess he
[54:48] don't care I guess he don't care I'm
[54:49] going through this
[54:52] you're taking your opinion over his
[54:54] promise
[54:56] you're taking your feelings over his
[54:58] promise you're taking your emotions over
[55:00] his promise
[55:05] listen friends I don't care if every
[55:07] morning and many mornings I have to God
[55:09] knows it's the truth I can hardly get
[55:10] out of bed because of my back but I do
[55:13] not let that discourage me I still claim
[55:15] he is my healer
[55:18] that's got nothing to do with it
[55:26] I prayed over people with back trouble
[55:27] seeing God heal them instantly I've seen
[55:29] him shout the church down and I couldn't
[55:31] hardly get back to the hotel room I hurt
[55:33] so bad but it does not matter that's got
[55:36] nothing to do with it
[55:41] the path you take does not deter from
[55:44] the promise he made
[55:46] my God that ought to be on the T-shirt
[55:54] that produced discouragement
[55:56] and the discouragement
[55:58] discouragement has a poison
[56:07] discouragement has a poison the loss of
[56:10] confidence the loss of enthusiasm and
[56:13] disheartenment is the poisoned of
[56:16] discouragement
[56:18] and when these people were infected by
[56:20] this poison of discouragement the Bible
[56:22] said the people spake against God and
[56:25] against Moses his prophet and they said
[56:28] wherefore have you brought us out of
[56:31] Egypt to die in the wilderness
[56:33] for there is no bread and there isn't
[56:36] any water
[56:38] and our souls
[56:40] our souls are Loth
[56:42] of this light bread
[56:47] we can't stand another day of it
[56:50] Angel bread
[56:52] not rainbow bread from Rainbow Bakery
[56:55] but Angel bread from the Covenant God
[57:00] and they begin to complain against the
[57:02] very manna
[57:04] that God provided for them
[57:09] that manner was good enough to sustain
[57:12] them
[57:12] that manner was good enough to sustain
[57:15] him in the wilderness and I say to you
[57:16] this morning my brother my sister this
[57:18] manner that God has given us is good
[57:21] enough to sustain us through the layout
[57:23] of sea of wilderness
[57:25] man should I live thy bread alone but by
[57:28] every word that precedeth out of the
[57:30] mouth of God
[57:35] Souls
[57:36] spies
[57:38] this manner
[57:40] but you see there was an antidote
[57:45] to this poison of discouragement
[57:48] now an antidote by definition is a
[57:50] remedy
[57:51] or an agent used to neutralize or
[57:55] counteract the effects
[57:57] of poison
[57:59] so there was an antidote against this
[58:01] poison of discouragement and they must
[58:04] do one or two things they must either
[58:06] take the antidote
[58:09] or receive the poison
[58:16] the antidote against discouragement
[58:19] that was caused by the way
[58:22] the way
[58:24] the way
[58:25] to the promised land
[58:27] the discouragement that was caused by
[58:29] the way for the Promised Land
[58:33] like blackouts in it
[58:35] earthquakes and
[58:37] volcanoes
[58:39] famine in the land for the hearing of
[58:40] the word of God
[58:43] obstacles that's in the way
[58:45] of the promise of our journey
[58:48] to the rapture
[58:53] the antidote gets the discouragement
[58:55] that was caused by the way it was the
[58:58] promise oh my the antidote that
[59:01] neutralized the poison of discouragement
[59:03] was the promise that God gave them
[59:07] in Exodus 3 8 he said I am come down to
[59:10] deliver them out of the hands of the
[59:11] Egyptians and to bring them out of that
[59:13] land or to a good land and a large land
[59:15] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[59:17] unto a place of the Canaanites and the
[59:19] Hittites and the amorites and the
[59:21] presidents and the hibits and the
[59:22] jebusites another Behold The Cry or the
[59:25] children of Israel has come up unto me
[59:26] and also have seen the oppression
[59:28] wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed
[59:30] them and I've come now therefore I will
[59:33] send you unto Pharaoh that thou may
[59:35] bring forth my people out of Israel out
[59:37] of Egypt
[59:38] and Moses said unto God who am I that I
[59:41] should go into Pharaoh that I should
[59:43] bring forth the children of Israel out
[59:44] of Egypt he said certainly I will be
[59:47] with thee and this shall be a token unto
[59:49] they not have sent thee when thou has
[59:51] brought forth the people out of Egypt ye
[59:54] shall ye shall you know like you shall
[59:57] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost ye
[59:58] shall serve God of bone this mountain
[1:00:06] not could be not hope so not maybe
[1:00:09] you're going to serve me right here this
[1:00:10] is the token I'm giving you a covenant
[1:00:12] oh God
[1:00:16] the antidote to the discouragement was
[1:00:18] to encourage themselves in the promise
[1:00:20] that God made them
[1:00:23] if they would have took the antidote
[1:00:25] they would have said it don't matter if
[1:00:27] we have to go around it or over it or
[1:00:29] under it or through it it don't matter
[1:00:30] we're still going
[1:00:35] but the discouragement
[1:00:37] is a poison
[1:00:39] because it causes you to doubt God
[1:00:42] you see discouragement causes you to
[1:00:44] doubt God
[1:00:46] that's the opposite of faith
[1:00:48] because Faith pleases God you see the
[1:00:52] prophet of God said it pleases God when
[1:00:54] you keep his word
[1:00:58] not doubt
[1:01:01] but belief
[1:01:05] it's the opposite of faith Faith pleases
[1:01:08] God in their time of testing
[1:01:11] in their time of testing
[1:01:13] the discouragement caused him to doubt
[1:01:16] God
[1:01:18] and because of the loss of confidence
[1:01:21] in The God Who made the promise
[1:01:25] it displeased God
[1:01:32] is that not true
[1:01:34] and the penalty of their discouragement
[1:01:37] the Bible said the Lord sent fiery
[1:01:39] serpents among the people and they bit
[1:01:42] the people much and the people of Israel
[1:01:44] died
[1:01:48] the Bible said with many of them God was
[1:01:50] not well pleased
[1:01:52] for they were overthrown in the
[1:01:54] wilderness
[1:01:55] what brought the displeasure
[1:01:58] discouragement
[1:02:01] therefore the Bible says that the people
[1:02:03] came to Moses said we have sinned for we
[1:02:06] have spoke against the Lord and against
[1:02:07] thee pray unto the Lord that he take
[1:02:10] away the serpents from us
[1:02:14] were wrong
[1:02:15] we've sinned we've disbelieved God we've
[1:02:19] let our problems get bigger than our God
[1:02:21] we get the dirty get bigger than the
[1:02:24] land
[1:02:29] who is sinned against him pray to the
[1:02:31] Lord did he take away the serpents from
[1:02:32] us and Moses prayed for the people and
[1:02:35] the Lord said unto Moses make the afari
[1:02:37] serpent and set it upon a pole and it
[1:02:39] shall come to pass that everyone that is
[1:02:41] bitten when he looks upon it
[1:02:43] he
[1:02:44] shall live
[1:02:48] the penalty
[1:02:49] of discouragement
[1:02:52] you see in First Corinthians 10 11 the
[1:02:54] Bible says this now all these things
[1:02:55] happen unto them for examples
[1:02:59] and they are written for our admonition
[1:03:02] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[1:03:05] God allowed these things to be written
[1:03:08] about them to tell you don't you do what
[1:03:10] they did
[1:03:13] the people that comes upon the ends of
[1:03:16] the Earth listen for hits we're not in
[1:03:17] the first search age where in the last
[1:03:19] Church age we are in the seventh Church
[1:03:21] days and it is the seventh churches that
[1:03:24] takes the rapture
[1:03:29] Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam and
[1:03:31] Enoch did not see death and that he was
[1:03:35] translated that before his translation
[1:03:37] before his Rapture he had this testimony
[1:03:41] that he pleased God
[1:03:48] who was Enoch typing who was he not
[1:03:51] typing he was typing you
[1:03:53] you say well if I could be if I could be
[1:03:55] like Enoch Enoch said I'm so glad I'm
[1:03:58] tapping you
[1:04:05] so let's look for a few minutes
[1:04:09] who a few in their times of
[1:04:11] discouragement
[1:04:12] they took the antidote
[1:04:14] that was provided against
[1:04:17] the discouragement
[1:04:19] Peter
[1:04:21] was discouraged
[1:04:23] but he took the antidote
[1:04:26] the prophecy they were fishermen they
[1:04:28] knew the signs they made the living by
[1:04:30] fishing they were commercial fishermen
[1:04:33] that was their occupation they knew they
[1:04:35] were the bill dances of their day
[1:04:39] they knew all about the lake when the
[1:04:41] water was riding and that they'd stained
[1:04:43] all night long and they hadn't even
[1:04:45] taken one fish they had took nothing
[1:04:49] and they were washing their Nets
[1:04:52] and they were in discouragement
[1:04:55] the prophet said anytime a fisherman
[1:04:57] goes fishing they don't catch fish
[1:04:59] he is discouraged that right Brazil
[1:05:03] he is
[1:05:05] scurries
[1:05:06] anytime Tennessee don't win
[1:05:13] oh well
[1:05:15] for another day
[1:05:19] they hadn't took a fish
[1:05:21] they had signed all night long and had
[1:05:25] taken nothing
[1:05:27] the prophet said they were washing out
[1:05:29] their Nets and they were discouraged and
[1:05:32] the prophet said you people that lived
[1:05:33] close to this River fish all night and
[1:05:34] catch nothing it's discouraging
[1:05:38] but Jesus spoke to them
[1:05:42] you see in the prophet said it's in
[1:05:45] those times of discouragement that he
[1:05:47] comes to you but do not fail to me don't
[1:05:52] miss him when he comes
[1:05:54] don't be so discouraged that you miss
[1:05:57] him when he comes to you because it's in
[1:06:00] those times of discouragement that he
[1:06:02] comes
[1:06:04] and it was little this time in Peter's
[1:06:06] life
[1:06:07] that he came
[1:06:11] and Jesus said go out into the lake
[1:06:13] again go right out there where you was
[1:06:15] at and let down for a drought let down
[1:06:18] and take up a whole net full of fish
[1:06:28] now I've not seen you around here before
[1:06:30] Are you a are you another local
[1:06:33] fisherman have you maybe fished another
[1:06:34] place and you've
[1:06:36] you're telling me
[1:06:38] I'm a professional
[1:06:42] and you're telling me to go right out
[1:06:44] there where I was just at
[1:06:46] and throw a net that I throwed all night
[1:06:48] long it caught nothing I've had no sleep
[1:06:51] I've had nothing to eat
[1:06:53] I've not even had coffee
[1:06:56] and you're wanting me to go right out
[1:06:58] there and throw a net again
[1:07:05] Peter said Lord we've seen all night
[1:07:09] we have taken nothing
[1:07:14] but here's the antidote
[1:07:16] in his time of discouragement now he's
[1:07:18] got to do one or two things he's got to
[1:07:19] either keep the discouragement those I
[1:07:22] have called nothing are you listening to
[1:07:24] me are you called nothing
[1:07:27] you can either keep those words of
[1:07:29] discouragement or he can take the
[1:07:31] antidote
[1:07:35] we've spent all night we've seen all
[1:07:37] night we've taken nothing
[1:07:40] but nevertheless at your word
[1:07:44] at your word
[1:07:47] now that my emotion now that my feelings
[1:07:50] not at my knowledge not at my
[1:07:52] understanding but at Thy Word
[1:07:57] Hallelujah
[1:08:00] Hallelujah
[1:08:02] I'll let down the net
[1:08:04] God said so Hallelujah faith will put
[1:08:07] fish there if there isn't any fish there
[1:08:12] at Thy word believe God against all
[1:08:17] human ability or understanding or
[1:08:20] doctors reports or pet scans or CT scans
[1:08:23] or MRIS
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:30] I took the antidote
[1:08:32] and he went home
[1:08:33] his wife said did you catch anything
[1:08:39] look at the boat
[1:08:40] it's about that far on the water did we
[1:08:43] catch anything
[1:08:45] look at Lazarus
[1:08:47] Lazarus was dead his two sisters left
[1:08:50] alone in the world their parents were
[1:08:53] there there was no one there to look out
[1:08:55] for them no security no one to provide
[1:08:58] for them just two sisters in in
[1:09:00] sackcloth
[1:09:02] and Ashes weeping over the death of the
[1:09:04] brother and no doubt a lot of their
[1:09:06] weeping wasn't just for the loss of
[1:09:07] their brother but it was for the loss
[1:09:10] their own self-pity
[1:09:16] laughs
[1:09:17] hey we're all human huh
[1:09:23] who sat in our sackcloth and Ashes
[1:09:26] dressed in black weeping
[1:09:28] they sent for Jesus when Lazarus got
[1:09:31] sick
[1:09:32] they sent for Jesus and guess what he
[1:09:36] went the other way
[1:09:39] I'm talking about the Jesus that stayed
[1:09:42] in her home I'm talking about the Jesus
[1:09:43] that they cooked supper for
[1:09:46] I'm talking about the Jesus that they
[1:09:48] left the organization and they left
[1:09:50] their denominations to follow this man
[1:09:52] that they were saying on the internet he
[1:09:53] was the cult and a false prophet and a
[1:09:55] liar
[1:09:57] but they left everything to follow this
[1:09:59] man and when they needed him the most he
[1:10:02] went the other way
[1:10:04] times
[1:10:06] discouragement
[1:10:12] discouraging time
[1:10:14] hey
[1:10:15] Mary Martha didn't didn't you leave your
[1:10:18] church to follow that
[1:10:20] message cult
[1:10:23] that self-made Prophet where'd he go to
[1:10:26] school anyway
[1:10:30] and the Bible said that Mary sat still
[1:10:33] in the house and when she heard that
[1:10:36] Jesus has come she went out to meet him
[1:10:38] and she said through her tears Lord if
[1:10:42] you would have been here my brother
[1:10:43] would not have died
[1:10:46] the Bible said Jesus saw Mary weeping
[1:10:49] and he groaned in his spirit
[1:10:52] and he said to Mary
[1:10:54] where
[1:10:56] have you laid him
[1:10:58] it's fixing to get interested
[1:11:02] where have you laid here
[1:11:05] I said unto him Lord come and see and
[1:11:07] the Bible says the shortest verse in the
[1:11:09] Bible the Bible said that Jesus wept
[1:11:15] and they are another Jews they said
[1:11:17] behold look look how he loved this man
[1:11:19] he's standing there weeping
[1:11:23] but was he weeping because Lazarus was
[1:11:25] going or was he weeping because
[1:11:27] for their unbelief
[1:11:32] Jesus wept and some of them said oh how
[1:11:37] he must have loved him some of them said
[1:11:39] could not this man that opened the eyes
[1:11:41] of the blind could not have caused even
[1:11:42] this man that he shouldn't have died
[1:11:44] couldn't he even keep him from dying
[1:11:49] Jesus therefore groaned again in himself
[1:11:51] and he cometh to the Grave it was a cave
[1:11:53] and a stone was laid upon it and Jesus
[1:11:56] said
[1:11:57] in their time of discouragement in their
[1:11:59] time of weeping Jesus said take away the
[1:12:03] stone
[1:12:04] that's the antidote
[1:12:07] take away the stone and Martha in her
[1:12:11] discouragement
[1:12:12] even though she had done said
[1:12:15] yes Lord I know I know he'll rise again
[1:12:18] in the resurrection and Jesus said I
[1:12:20] have the resurrection
[1:12:23] even though he had said that Martha even
[1:12:26] in her discouragement
[1:12:29] she said
[1:12:32] Lord
[1:12:33] by this time he stinks
[1:12:36] his nose has done fell in
[1:12:39] he's been dead four days
[1:12:43] are you really sure you want us to take
[1:12:45] that stone away
[1:12:49] here's the antidote in the midst of all
[1:12:51] this discouragement here is the antidote
[1:12:54] Jesus said unto her
[1:12:56] said not I unto thee if thou wouldst
[1:12:59] believe
[1:13:00] thou should see the glory of God
[1:13:04] you want to see the glory of God don't
[1:13:06] doubt don't try to figure it out come on
[1:13:08] friends you don't have to pump it up
[1:13:09] work it up shout it up just believe him
[1:13:12] you want to see the glory of God just
[1:13:15] believe him
[1:13:21] looked off to the Sea the glory of God
[1:13:24] the antidote the antidote was if you
[1:13:27] would believe
[1:13:28] they're setting all around the
[1:13:30] discouragement and in tears now you're
[1:13:32] going to do one or two things either
[1:13:34] stay in your discouragement
[1:13:37] or roll away
[1:13:39] the stone
[1:13:42] what are you going to do this morning
[1:13:44] and that big rock that's in your life
[1:13:49] what are you gonna do about it he's
[1:13:51] going to set in your discouragement in
[1:13:54] your confusion in your nervousness
[1:13:56] or you can roll away the stone
[1:14:01] notice Jesus didn't say no Martha you're
[1:14:04] kind of small you know you're kind of a
[1:14:06] little feeble there if you'll step aside
[1:14:08] now I'll roll that stone away he never
[1:14:10] said that
[1:14:12] he never lifted a finger to move the
[1:14:14] stone
[1:14:15] he said you roll away the stone
[1:14:19] you know many times wait to see what the
[1:14:21] Lord will do maybe he's waiting to see
[1:14:22] what you'll do
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:27] amen
[1:14:28] we serve a God who turned water into
[1:14:31] wine
[1:14:32] hey that's pretty good how many times
[1:14:34] does he have to do it before we believe
[1:14:37] it
[1:14:38] how many times does he have to heal
[1:14:40] cancer how many times oh my does he have
[1:14:43] to open blinded eyes how many times does
[1:14:45] he have to make the lane get up and walk
[1:14:47] before we'll finally believe him
[1:14:54] we could sit around discouraged we could
[1:14:56] sat around in our tears we can look at
[1:14:58] Fox News until we're all upset
[1:15:01] or we can roll away the stone and when
[1:15:04] they took the antidote and rode away a
[1:15:06] stone a man that had been dead four days
[1:15:08] came forth when Jesus said last night
[1:15:11] come forth
[1:15:14] and you know what the next thing he said
[1:15:16] Lucy and let him go
[1:15:23] David
[1:15:25] foreign
[1:15:26] David
[1:15:28] was a man
[1:15:29] after God's Own Heart
[1:15:34] so let's look and see how David dealt
[1:15:37] with discouragement
[1:15:38] and we can understand how to please God
[1:15:41] in our times of discouragement
[1:15:44] because David was a man after God's Own
[1:15:46] Heart
[1:15:48] and let me assure you today
[1:15:50] times of discouragement we'll come
[1:15:53] to all of us
[1:15:56] will there have you ever been
[1:15:57] discouraged oh wow sure
[1:16:00] I'll be honest many times
[1:16:02] have you
[1:16:05] many times
[1:16:06] when things didn't work out because you
[1:16:08] thought they should
[1:16:11] or it didn't happen when you thought it
[1:16:12] should happen
[1:16:17] When you pray for somebody and they walk
[1:16:18] away still dragging their foot
[1:16:20] it's discouraging sometimes
[1:16:22] when you believe with all your heart
[1:16:24] that God will do something for them
[1:16:26] and then the next year you see them
[1:16:28] they're walking normal
[1:16:30] because God done it for them
[1:16:33] yeah we all make those discouraging
[1:16:35] times friends
[1:16:36] but let's look and see how David dealt
[1:16:38] with this discouragement
[1:16:40] because it will come to all of us
[1:16:42] whether we're young or old
[1:16:46] now the Bible says in first Samuel
[1:16:48] chapter 30. that it came to pass there
[1:16:51] when David and his men were come to
[1:16:52] ziggling on the third day that the
[1:16:55] amalekites had invaded the South and
[1:16:57] ziglag and smitten ziglag and burned it
[1:17:00] with fire
[1:17:02] and had taken captive there at the end
[1:17:05] they took Cactus they slew not any
[1:17:08] neither great or snow but they carried
[1:17:10] them away
[1:17:11] they came in they burned they didn't
[1:17:13] kill anybody
[1:17:15] not one woman not one child they just
[1:17:19] come in and burnt the city and kidnapped
[1:17:21] the entire Village
[1:17:25] and took them with them
[1:17:26] and here come David and his men
[1:17:30] riding up to think like
[1:17:34] and I could just see them here they've
[1:17:36] been in a great battle
[1:17:38] these were rugged Warriors these were
[1:17:40] men who could take a sword and cut a
[1:17:43] man's head off with one swing here was
[1:17:45] men that fought so hard that they had to
[1:17:47] cleave the sword out of their hands
[1:17:50] I think one of them killed 300 at one
[1:17:52] time
[1:17:53] in a field
[1:17:55] rugged hardened soldiers
[1:18:00] not new recruits
[1:18:02] not new recruits that just had a uniform
[1:18:05] no these were battle scarred Warriors
[1:18:09] they had been in battle they knew what
[1:18:11] it was
[1:18:13] to see men cry on the battlefield for
[1:18:15] their mothers as they were trying to
[1:18:17] hold on to their guts because they'd
[1:18:19] been ripped out of them
[1:18:20] the cruelty the hardness of War you
[1:18:24] brothers that's been in combat I take my
[1:18:26] hat off to you
[1:18:28] things you had to endure the things you
[1:18:30] had to see
[1:18:33] young people want to do something you
[1:18:35] want to do something good for somebody
[1:18:36] go to the VA and shake a veteran's hand
[1:18:38] tell them thank you for your service to
[1:18:40] our country
[1:18:41] I said it's a shame that to give
[1:18:43] homosexuals a whole month and to give
[1:18:45] veterans one day
[1:18:46] it's a shame
[1:18:52] the hardened Warriors
[1:18:56] that came to the city and behold it was
[1:18:58] burned with fire and their wives and
[1:19:00] their sons and their daughters were
[1:19:01] taken captive
[1:19:03] they were coming back from the battle
[1:19:04] they were headed home they were happy as
[1:19:06] well I'll tell you one thing my wife
[1:19:08] makes the best apple pie I bet she's got
[1:19:10] one in the window an oval dog out there
[1:19:12] oh rufusion Old man he's going to wag
[1:19:14] his tail when he sees me and I can't
[1:19:16] wait to see little Johnny and I can't
[1:19:17] wait to see Sarah and give her a hug my
[1:19:19] little girl well they were so happy they
[1:19:21] were coming back from the battle
[1:19:22] following David their King their leader
[1:19:27] fighting for David away from their wives
[1:19:29] away from their children away from their
[1:19:31] families fighting for their King
[1:19:35] and when they came back to the city of
[1:19:37] Ziegler and no doubt they broke up over
[1:19:39] the hill and they was laughing and
[1:19:41] singing and having a great time
[1:19:45] and when they come up over the hill
[1:19:47] that was the city
[1:19:49] it was burnt
[1:19:53] there were no dogs
[1:19:55] wagging their tail
[1:19:57] no apple pie
[1:19:59] in the window
[1:20:01] no Johnny
[1:20:03] no Sarah
[1:20:05] no wife
[1:20:06] no welcome back kiss
[1:20:10] they were gone
[1:20:12] they were all gold
[1:20:14] the whole city
[1:20:21] her sons and their daughters and their
[1:20:23] wives were taken captive
[1:20:26] then David and the people with him
[1:20:27] lifted up their voices and wept
[1:20:31] until the Bible said there had no more
[1:20:34] power to weep
[1:20:38] these were battle-hardened soldiers who
[1:20:40] saw battle but yet this had brought such
[1:20:43] discouragement
[1:20:45] they were in tears
[1:20:48] they whelped till they had no more
[1:20:50] ability to weep
[1:20:54] and the Bible says that David was
[1:20:57] greatly distressed for the people spake
[1:21:00] of stone in him
[1:21:02] his own men who fought for him who
[1:21:05] believed that he would be the king he
[1:21:07] would reign as king and they were
[1:21:09] willing to die for David now these very
[1:21:11] men were so discouraged by what they saw
[1:21:14] in Ziegler that they picked up stones to
[1:21:17] kill David
[1:21:21] you know a stone is a confession
[1:21:23] and I wonder how many times in our times
[1:21:26] of discouragement we have picked up
[1:21:28] confessions
[1:21:30] against our Lord
[1:21:36] why am I going through this
[1:21:39] what have I done to deserve this
[1:21:45] yes they picked up Stones how many times
[1:21:50] have we made a confession I'll be honest
[1:21:53] I'm raising how many times have we made
[1:21:55] a confession
[1:21:56] I can't start Lord
[1:22:01] the Bible said David was greatly
[1:22:03] distressed
[1:22:05] time of great discouragement that his
[1:22:08] own men who just fought a battle with
[1:22:11] him
[1:22:12] now was turning against him it's your
[1:22:14] fault David
[1:22:16] you're trying to make a name for
[1:22:17] yourself if I'd have been out there
[1:22:19] fighting for you my wife would not be a
[1:22:21] took away from me it's your fault
[1:22:26] well said David was greatly distressed
[1:22:31] for the sake of owning him because the
[1:22:33] souls of all the people was grieved
[1:22:35] every man for his sons and for his
[1:22:38] daughters
[1:22:41] so here's the antidote
[1:22:44] in this time of discouragement the Bible
[1:22:46] says but David he didn't quit he didn't
[1:22:50] run and hide behind a rock
[1:22:52] but he looked to The Rock
[1:22:54] the Bible said that David encouraged
[1:22:57] himself in the Lord his God
[1:23:03] in the time of great distress he did not
[1:23:06] run he did not quit he did not give up
[1:23:09] he simply reminded himself of what God
[1:23:12] said about him
[1:23:14] God hallelujah God sent a prophet to
[1:23:17] tell him you will reign as king and how
[1:23:20] can I be stoned by my old men and reign
[1:23:23] as king so I will take God's word over
[1:23:26] the situation that I'm in and David
[1:23:29] encouraged himself and the Lord his God
[1:23:31] who made the promise to David
[1:23:38] armies will fail us Nations will fail us
[1:23:41] families will fail us but God our God
[1:23:44] will never fail us
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:50] everything
[1:23:52] David said to abathar the priest
[1:23:54] amalek's son I pray thee bring me hither
[1:23:58] the ephod
[1:23:59] and he brought the IFA to David
[1:24:03] and David required of the Lord
[1:24:07] I said what shall I do Lord
[1:24:10] shall I pursue after this troop shall I
[1:24:13] overtake them
[1:24:14] what do you want me to do Lord
[1:24:17] I don't care how bad it looks I'm
[1:24:19] following your leadership I don't care
[1:24:21] how bad it looks I don't even care what
[1:24:23] I think about it Lord my thoughts don't
[1:24:25] even matter I have no opinion listen
[1:24:28] friends I'm not interested in your
[1:24:29] opinion you know why because I'm not
[1:24:30] even interested in my own opinion my
[1:24:32] opinion means nothing
[1:24:34] it's not what I think it's what God Said
[1:24:40] what do you want me to do Lord just tell
[1:24:42] me what you want me to do shall I pursue
[1:24:44] after this truth shall I overtake them
[1:24:46] and God answered David
[1:24:50] he said pursue
[1:24:52] pursue go after him David for Thou shalt
[1:24:56] truly overtake them and without fail
[1:24:59] you shall recover
[1:25:01] all
[1:25:04] even the apple pies
[1:25:09] you shall recover
[1:25:11] all
[1:25:16] so David gets up
[1:25:20] encouraged
[1:25:22] because the word of the Lord neutralized
[1:25:25] the poison
[1:25:27] of discouragement
[1:25:30] and David got up you know he liked to
[1:25:33] dance anyway
[1:25:34] he might have moonwalked a little bit I
[1:25:36] don't know
[1:25:37] but David got up
[1:25:39] he got us happy he got him smiling and
[1:25:43] just being
[1:25:48] [Music]
[1:25:52] oh my God David's lost his mind look at
[1:25:55] him he's dancing out there he's smiling
[1:25:56] he's laughing
[1:25:59] yes oh he lost his mind all right
[1:26:01] because he got the mind of God
[1:26:03] he had the mind of God and listened for
[1:26:05] his we're not we're not serving God
[1:26:07] under a closed book we're not serving
[1:26:09] God under a sealed book The Seals have
[1:26:11] been opened we know God hallelujah we
[1:26:13] know the mind of God concerning us we
[1:26:16] know who we are we know who God our God
[1:26:18] is we know what God requires of us we
[1:26:21] know where we came from we know our DNA
[1:26:23] we know our genetics we know where we're
[1:26:25] going
[1:26:31] the prophet said I went into the
[1:26:33] backside of God's mind
[1:26:35] Hallelujah he has revealed his mind to
[1:26:38] us concerning us
[1:26:43] David got up
[1:26:45] say listen boys
[1:26:46] I know you're hurting
[1:26:48] I know you're troubled I know you're
[1:26:50] crying I know you're discouraged I know
[1:26:52] you're thinking about killing me
[1:26:54] but here's what I want you to do
[1:26:56] I want you to dry your eyes
[1:26:58] sharpen your swords tighten up your
[1:27:01] saddles
[1:27:02] because we're going to ride
[1:27:06] who are we going David
[1:27:08] where we go
[1:27:09] we're going to get that apple pie
[1:27:12] and your wife who baked it
[1:27:14] and little Johnny hey little sir
[1:27:22] the Bible says in first Samuel 30 17 he
[1:27:26] smote them from the Twilight even into
[1:27:28] the evening of the next day
[1:27:31] oh I could see in the campus of the of
[1:27:34] the Malachi I could see him just
[1:27:35] rejoicing what day one thing we pulled
[1:27:37] one over on David he was out there
[1:27:39] fighting that little Skirmish while he
[1:27:40] was out there man we went in there and
[1:27:42] burned the city down we but we took his
[1:27:44] wives we took the boys we took
[1:27:45] everything
[1:27:49] and David's wife said you're going to be
[1:27:51] sorry
[1:27:54] you're going to be sorry
[1:27:58] David's coming
[1:28:00] he ain't gonna leave us down here like
[1:28:01] this
[1:28:02] he ain't gonna leave us down here in
[1:28:03] this Darkness lay Odyssey he ain't going
[1:28:05] to leave us down here in these
[1:28:06] Troublesome nuclear times he's not going
[1:28:08] to leave us in this time of plagues and
[1:28:09] famines and fires and volcanoes and
[1:28:11] earthquakes and flood come on somebody
[1:28:13] he ain't going to leave us here much
[1:28:15] longer
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:18] and David is coming for us our David is
[1:28:22] coming for us are you ready to go young
[1:28:25] people are you ready to go Mama are you
[1:28:28] ready to go amen quit looking at your
[1:28:30] discouragement quit looking at the
[1:28:32] discouraged times and let's get ready to
[1:28:34] go
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:41] hush up woman we're trying to Rejoice
[1:28:43] over this victory
[1:28:45] you ain't got no victory
[1:28:48] you ain't got nothing
[1:28:49] he's coming
[1:28:51] and there's out there hooting and
[1:28:52] hollering and all of a sudden not on the
[1:28:54] horizon they saw a dust cloud
[1:28:58] they said all you reckon that is
[1:29:02] she said that'd be David
[1:29:10] the Bible says that there was nothing
[1:29:13] lacking
[1:29:14] to them neither small nor great neither
[1:29:18] Sons nor daughters neither spoil nor
[1:29:21] anything that had been taken to them
[1:29:24] but David recovered
[1:29:27] oh
[1:29:33] because
[1:29:35] David
[1:29:36] took the antidote
[1:29:38] against
[1:29:40] discouragement
[1:29:42] so the question comes to my mind
[1:29:45] what are we going to do about
[1:29:47] our times of discouragement
[1:29:52] we sing two two tops
[1:29:55] one
[1:29:56] who took the discouragement
[1:29:58] and was punished
[1:30:00] one who took the antidote
[1:30:02] and saw great things
[1:30:04] so what are we going to do in our times
[1:30:06] of discouragement
[1:30:08] says I want to ask you a question what
[1:30:11] good does it do us to come to church and
[1:30:12] sit in a meeting and Ponder and maybe be
[1:30:15] discouraged
[1:30:16] because we didn't get a prayer court or
[1:30:18] maybe be discouraged because of some ill
[1:30:19] thing a neighbor did or discouraged
[1:30:21] about one little matter or the other
[1:30:23] that keeps Christ away from you
[1:30:27] when you're discouraged that keeps
[1:30:30] Christ away from you
[1:30:37] it's when you're thinking on him
[1:30:40] that he comes
[1:30:42] so in our times of discouragement when
[1:30:45] he comes
[1:30:47] what causes him to come is when we begin
[1:30:50] to think on him
[1:30:53] you see you may not be able to stop
[1:30:54] discouragement from coming
[1:30:57] but we can't keep it from staying
[1:31:02] so I say to you and I this morning let's
[1:31:04] take the antidote let's encourage
[1:31:07] ourselves in the Lord
[1:31:09] let's encourage ourselves in the
[1:31:12] promises he has made for us
[1:31:15] he said in Joshua 1 9 have not I
[1:31:17] commanded thee be strong be of good
[1:31:19] courage Be not Afraid neither be thou
[1:31:22] dismayed you know what that word
[1:31:24] dismayed means neither be thou
[1:31:26] discouraged
[1:31:29] for the Lord thy God is with thee the
[1:31:32] Lord thy God is with thee whether so
[1:31:36] ever thou goest in the good times in the
[1:31:39] bad times in the High Times in the low
[1:31:42] times in the valley on the mountain he
[1:31:45] is with us he promised in his word I
[1:31:48] will never leave thee nor will I forsake
[1:31:51] thee Deuteronomy 31 8 in the Lord he he
[1:31:54] is that goeth before thee he will be
[1:31:56] with thee he will not fail thee neither
[1:31:58] forsake thee fear not neither be
[1:32:02] discouraged
[1:32:04] Isaiah 41 10 fair thou not for I am with
[1:32:08] thee be not discouraged for I am thy God
[1:32:11] I will strengthen the yea I will help
[1:32:13] thee yay I will uphold thee with the
[1:32:16] right hand of my righteousness no weapon
[1:32:19] formed against thee shall prosper I am
[1:32:22] the Lord thy God that healeth thee
[1:32:27] we can speak we can stay discouraged
[1:32:30] because we're sick or we can be
[1:32:31] encouraged because he's our healer
[1:32:36] encourage yourselves in the Lord
[1:32:40] don't be discouraged we're living in a
[1:32:43] terrible hour the prophet said a
[1:32:45] terrible hour for the unbeliever it is a
[1:32:47] terrible hour for the unbeliever
[1:32:50] but a wonderful hour
[1:32:52] a wonderful hour for the believer
[1:32:58] we are living in a terrible hour
[1:33:00] a terrible hour for the unbeliever
[1:33:04] but a wonderful hour
[1:33:06] for the believer
[1:33:08] for we're near the end time to which
[1:33:10] we're looking for the coming of the
[1:33:12] Blessed Lord that's why we're here
[1:33:15] Redeeming the time because we know we
[1:33:19] have not much time left
[1:33:24] we know it friends
[1:33:25] there is no Eighth Day messenger coming
[1:33:27] there is no Prophet rising up for the
[1:33:30] Gentiles there is none coming
[1:33:34] the only thing left for the church the
[1:33:37] only thing left for us
[1:33:40] is the coming
[1:33:41] of the Lord
[1:33:46] you see the prophet told the story just
[1:33:48] give me a few more minutes I'll close
[1:33:49] Prophet told a story about a boy riding
[1:33:51] a bicycle and they said if you could
[1:33:53] ride I think it was 50 yards across this
[1:33:55] plank or whatever it was if whoever can
[1:33:57] ride across it and not fall off we'll
[1:33:58] win this brand new bicycle every boy got
[1:34:01] on that plank I got on that bicycle
[1:34:02] wrote just a little bit fell off but
[1:34:04] this one little fella jumped on the bike
[1:34:06] and he rode it all the way to the end
[1:34:08] and he won the bicycle
[1:34:10] all the other boys fell off but this
[1:34:12] little fella he won the bike and they
[1:34:15] said how did you do it
[1:34:18] he said you guys were looking right here
[1:34:21] you were looking right down here and it
[1:34:23] made you nervous
[1:34:25] it cost you to doubt that you could do
[1:34:27] it and you wobbled and fell off how'd it
[1:34:29] look right here when I got on the bike I
[1:34:31] looked at the Finish Line I looked to
[1:34:34] the end
[1:34:38] if you're discouraged this morning look
[1:34:40] to the end look in the back of the book
[1:34:42] I don't care what battle you're in look
[1:34:44] to the back of the book we win we win
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:55] amen he didn't look at the present he
[1:34:58] said I looked at the Finish Line in the
[1:35:00] prophets and friends don't look at the
[1:35:02] things right here look at the end if I
[1:35:04] had to look at the things right here in
[1:35:06] front of me I'd be a discouraged person
[1:35:09] but I never look here I never look here
[1:35:13] I watch the end
[1:35:19] oh brother dial but you don't you don't
[1:35:21] know the battle I'm in don't look at the
[1:35:23] Battle look at the victory
[1:35:28] well how do you know I'll have a victory
[1:35:30] because he said so
[1:35:36] God creates win-win situations for his
[1:35:39] children
[1:35:44] Prophet said notice
[1:35:46] when you're discouraged that's when the
[1:35:48] devil can really pour it on you that's
[1:35:49] when he gets you if you come to church
[1:35:52] you say well I don't know I don't know
[1:35:53] whether I'll ever get any better or not
[1:35:55] I've been prayed for twice oh my you
[1:35:56] might as well go home that's all but
[1:35:58] when you can cast that aside
[1:36:01] God don't want you frowning
[1:36:13] I lost my place God don't want you
[1:36:15] frowning
[1:36:16] God wants you to be happy
[1:36:24] are you happy
[1:36:28] God wants you to be happy the human
[1:36:30] heart was made to be happy
[1:36:34] hang on to your false teeth
[1:36:36] worry
[1:36:38] will cause
[1:36:40] cancer
[1:36:44] some of you people want all these other
[1:36:46] processed foods because you're afraid
[1:36:47] you're going to get cancer and you worry
[1:36:48] yourself to death that you're going to
[1:36:49] get cancer
[1:36:50] come on
[1:36:55] it's true friends
[1:36:57] oh they won't touch them I ain't
[1:36:59] touching that right there California
[1:37:00] said that causes cancer you're going to

[1:37:56] and nothing can harm you there's nothing
[1:38:00] can harm you
[1:38:02] there's neither Powers things present
[1:38:04] things future there's nothing that can
[1:38:07] separate us from him
[1:38:10] we are in him
[1:38:14] and we never came in by our own will
[1:38:17] oh God
[1:38:20] he by choice elected us and brought us
[1:38:24] to him
[1:38:28] the Lord encourage you this morning
[1:38:31] I didn't even choose this
[1:38:33] do you know what I was going to be when
[1:38:34] I growed up I was going to be a soldier
[1:38:38] I joined the army to be a lifer as I
[1:38:40] call him 30 years in the military that
[1:38:42] was my objective
[1:38:45] preacher are you kidding
[1:38:51] it never entered my mind
[1:38:55] and I used to witness to people when I
[1:38:57] got saved and I went back to ETSU
[1:38:59] because I got saved on Christmas break
[1:39:00] and when I went back to school I started
[1:39:01] witnessing about the Lord and people
[1:39:03] said you're a preacher
[1:39:05] I said no I'm not I I just like to
[1:39:09] I just like to tell the people about
[1:39:11] what the Lord done for me
[1:39:15] and then he spoke to me one day
[1:39:17] I said go preach my word
[1:39:20] so I did
[1:39:27] we never chose this ourself
[1:39:29] you understand that this morning you're
[1:39:31] not even here by your own choice you're
[1:39:33] here by his choice
[1:39:35] he chose us in him
[1:39:38] then be friends if he chose us in him do
[1:39:40] you think for a moment he's going to
[1:39:43] lose us
[1:39:44] then we should be the happiest people on
[1:39:46] earth
[1:39:48] we don't serve him by Creed we don't
[1:39:50] serve him by a Dogma we serve him by
[1:39:52] revelation
[1:39:55] the prophet said we know I told you I'm
[1:39:57] close I'm close
[1:39:59] I heard the pastor say this morning that
[1:40:01] many are becoming discouraged what we
[1:40:03] need Brothers to take courage what we
[1:40:05] need is to be encouraged that's right
[1:40:07] trials may come where never was promised
[1:40:09] to be immune from them but he will give
[1:40:11] us Grace to go through them
[1:40:13] if the Mountain's too high to go over if
[1:40:15] it's too deep to go under if it's too
[1:40:17] wide to go around it he will give us
[1:40:19] Grace to go through it that's right just
[1:40:21] don't worry keep your eyes on Christ for
[1:40:25] he's the only one who can take us
[1:40:28] through
[1:40:29] God said in Jeremiah I'll give them a
[1:40:31] heart to know me that I am the Lord and
[1:40:33] they shall be my people and I will be
[1:40:35] their God for they shall return unto me
[1:40:38] with their whole heart my Tabernacle
[1:40:42] also shall be with them yea and I will
[1:40:44] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:40:48] Zechariah 8 I will bring them and they
[1:40:51] should dwell in the midst of Jerusalem
[1:40:52] and they shall be my people and I will
[1:40:55] be their God in truth and in
[1:40:58] righteousness
[1:40:59] Jeremiah says thus saith the Lord learn
[1:41:02] not the way of the Heathen be not
[1:41:05] discouraged by the signs of Heaven for
[1:41:08] the Heathen are discouraged by the sons
[1:41:13] the signs of the heavens discourage the
[1:41:16] unbeliever
[1:41:19] don't learn the ways because they're
[1:41:20] discouraged with the signs of Heaven
[1:41:22] that's exactly what the Bible says
[1:41:23] that's the last phrase of the Bible said
[1:41:25] they are discouraged they're dismayed
[1:41:27] they're discouraged with them see that
[1:41:29] just discourages them that's exactly
[1:41:30] right so they do the same thing and they
[1:41:32] do notice right below he said also that
[1:41:34] there will be fearful sights in the
[1:41:36] heavens signs in the heavens and in the
[1:41:37] earth is that right and what did
[1:41:39] Jeremiah say be not discouraged at the
[1:41:41] signs in the heaven you say sign in
[1:41:43] heaven why they wondered even Pentagon
[1:41:45] you see not long ago all this year
[1:41:47] Flying Saucer stuff
[1:41:49] they wonder what it's all about I just
[1:41:51] saw an article just the other day that
[1:41:53] that the Pentagon is investigating
[1:41:56] 150 confirmed unidentified sightings
[1:42:03] they wonder what it's all about they
[1:42:05] can't make it out it's an invisible
[1:42:06] force it almost comes down there and
[1:42:08] it's an intelligent and I'm not a flying
[1:42:10] saucer man and all this your nonsense
[1:42:12] that's been told about it that's nothing
[1:42:14] to that it is no fire and saucer it is
[1:42:18] no men from Mars
[1:42:21] it is not life on another planet
[1:42:23] somewhere that's investigating our life
[1:42:26] that's nonsense that's been told about
[1:42:28] death there's nothing to that don't you
[1:42:30] believe that
[1:42:31] don't you believe that they're UFOs
[1:42:35] but they're Sons
[1:42:37] and the sons discourage the unbeliever
[1:42:42] it's a very discouraging time for the
[1:42:45] unbeliever but a very happy time for the
[1:42:47] believer for we believe that the time of
[1:42:50] our Redemption is drawing High
[1:42:52] but you lord said it would be this way
[1:42:55] and you've made it known to us you have
[1:42:58] made it known to us
[1:43:00] so we would not be
[1:43:03] discouraged
[1:43:10] be not discouraged
[1:43:12] for the Lord thy God is with thee
[1:43:15] he will keep thee
[1:43:17] he will sustain thee
[1:43:19] he will take us home
[1:43:21] with him one day
[1:43:23] when discouraging times come friends and
[1:43:24] they will come
[1:43:26] we have an antidote
[1:43:28] remember what he said in his word about
[1:43:31] us
[1:43:32] in God's mind we've all ready made it
[1:43:37] they led us this morning encourage
[1:43:39] ourselves in the promises concerning
[1:43:41] ourselves
[1:43:43] he says our children are our own
[1:43:45] Heritage do not be discouraged by the
[1:43:47] rebellious ways
[1:43:49] you just keep reeling them in just keep
[1:43:51] reeling on me
[1:43:53] keep reeling with me
[1:43:55] do you love him this morning
[1:43:58] why would I worry
[1:44:00] when Giants come calling my name
[1:44:04] my God it's so much bigger than troubles
[1:44:08] I face
[1:44:09] why would I hunger for power or riches
[1:44:13] or fame
[1:44:14] because my God is so much better
[1:44:18] than all
[1:44:19] of these things
[1:44:21] so I won't be shaken I won't be moved
[1:44:25] for my God is faithful his promise is
[1:44:28] true so I speak to the mountains and say
[1:44:31] it's time to move because my God is
[1:44:33] bigger better stronger and greater than
[1:44:38] you
[1:44:41] love you
[1:44:44] as Belarus
[1:44:46] [Applause]
[1:44:54] Hallelujah
[1:44:58] thank you
[1:45:01] thank you Lord for your word
[1:45:05] thank you for the antidote Lord
[1:45:08] that neutralizes the poison of
[1:45:11] discouragement
[1:45:13] and Lord you allow these things to come
[1:45:15] into our life just to see
[1:45:18] where we take the antidote
[1:45:20] when we take the promise
[1:45:23] where we let our problems when we let
[1:45:25] the journey or we will let the battle
[1:45:28] get bigger than you
[1:45:31] but I say to this mountain this morning
[1:45:34] you're going to have to move
[1:45:37] because my God is bigger better stronger
[1:45:40] and greater than you
[1:45:42] that's the kind of God you are Lord
[1:45:46] it's the god of God you are
[1:45:50] when I was young
[1:45:51] called my name
[1:45:53] I tried to run
[1:45:55] but still you came
[1:45:59] because that's the kind of God
[1:46:01] that you are
[1:46:03] Lord may your people take courage today
[1:46:05] Father
[1:46:07] Lord I know there's many tries in the
[1:46:09] father have not be little under problems

[1:46:17] accident God
[1:46:19] oh Lord when I saw him there everybody
[1:46:21] be obsessed my heart just went out to
[1:46:23] him Lord
[1:46:25] God I know how that is
[1:46:28] to the hospital to see your baby in that
[1:46:30] condition but Lord I pray
[1:46:32] may your spirit go to the family Lord
[1:46:35] may they not look at the bruises the
[1:46:37] neck braces and all the IVs
[1:46:40] may they look to you the Healer
[1:46:43] and the deliverer Lord
[1:46:45] God if there's some here this morning of
[1:46:46] all they're just battling different
[1:46:48] tissues some battling cancer Lord we
[1:46:50] know others just battling maybe
[1:46:52] menopause Lord at times of nervousness
[1:46:54] father maybe some just discouraged with
[1:46:57] the news and the things that's happening
[1:47:00] but oh God
[1:47:02] may we take the antidote today Lord
[1:47:05] may we believe your report
[1:47:08] may we believe your word today Lord we
[1:47:10] pray
[1:47:12] and may we cast us out everything that's
[1:47:14] contrary to your word and may we do like
[1:47:16] David
[1:47:18] in the time of his great distress he
[1:47:20] never gave up he never quit he never ran
[1:47:23] but he encouraged himself and the Lord
[1:47:27] and oh God in this great battle maybe
[1:47:29] some here is in a tremendous battle
[1:47:30] today maybe nobody in this building even
[1:47:32] knows but them
[1:47:34] but God in this time of great battle
[1:47:36] may they encourage their self in you
[1:47:39] Lord
[1:47:40] for you are our God
[1:47:42] the keeper of our Flame
[1:47:44] you will be with us
[1:47:46] he will not forsake us
[1:47:48] but you will take us Lord
[1:47:51] to your table
[1:47:52] until that Time Lord
[1:47:55] may we be faithful I pray
[1:47:58] if you're here this morning baby
[1:48:01] this message has spoke to you I don't
[1:48:03] know
[1:48:04] just all week uh sitting in the stand I
[1:48:07] was thinking on these things
[1:48:11] but maybe this message that's the kind
[1:48:13] of God we serve this morning that he
[1:48:16] would put this on my heart to speak to a
[1:48:18] room full of people
[1:48:19] for one person that's going through a
[1:48:21] time of discouragement
[1:48:22] if you're that person this morning this
[1:48:24] word is for you
[1:48:26] now what are you going to do
[1:48:28] you're going to keep that discouragement
[1:48:31] are you going to cast it aside
[1:48:33] and take the antidote
[1:48:35] I will rejoice
[1:48:37] I will rejoice in the Lord God of my
[1:48:39] salvation
[1:48:40] I will rejoice in the god of my
[1:48:42] Deliverance I will rejoice in the God my
[1:48:45] healer
[1:48:46] have a rejoice in my God for there is no
[1:48:49] God
[1:48:50] like my God
[1:48:53] if you're here this morning I know
[1:48:55] there's not room here for for an altar
[1:48:57] you don't have to come to an altar
[1:48:59] friend we it's in your heart we know
[1:49:02] that
[1:49:03] but if you're here this morning and this
[1:49:05] word is spoke to you
[1:49:07] I wonder if you just slip up your hand
[1:49:09] and say Lord I received that today
[1:49:12] foreign
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:18] listen I was thinking the other day
[1:49:20] president talked about that box of
[1:49:22] rattlesnakes
[1:49:24] and here not long ago a package came to
[1:49:27] my door and the man rang the doorbell
[1:49:28] and I went to the door he said you need
[1:49:30] to sign for this
[1:49:31] it was my package had my name over it
[1:49:33] came to my house
[1:49:35] but he wouldn't give it to me till I
[1:49:36] signed for it but once I signed for that
[1:49:39] package he handed it to me and said have
[1:49:41] a good day
[1:49:42] and brother Branham talked about how
[1:49:44] Satan will come to our door with a box
[1:49:45] of rattlesnakes and if we sign for them
[1:49:48] they're ours
[1:49:50] but if you don't sign for them he can't
[1:49:52] give them to you he has to take them
[1:49:53] back
[1:49:55] and I was thinking about that if that's
[1:49:56] true for rattlesnakes
[1:49:58] there would not that be true when
[1:49:59] healing comes to our door
[1:50:01] when the Lord comes to our door with
[1:50:03] healing
[1:50:05] if you'll receive that
[1:50:07] it's yours
[1:50:08] it's got your name on it all you've got
[1:50:10] to do is receive it if the devil can
[1:50:12] give you a box of rattlesnakes because
[1:50:14] you received it cannot God give you
[1:50:15] healing Deliverance joy peace
[1:50:18] if you'll just receive it this morning
[1:50:21] if you'll just sign your name to it that
[1:50:23] promise belongs to me that promise
[1:50:26] belongs to me God spoke that in his word
[1:50:28] to me I believe the report of the Lord
[1:50:33] if you'll sign for that this morning
[1:50:35] for your healing would you just raise
[1:50:37] your hand for your deliverance if you'll
[1:50:39] just raise your hand for your
[1:50:40] encouragement for whatever you have need
[1:50:42] of if you just say Lord I receive it
[1:50:44] today in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:48] oh Father God the whole room Lord my
[1:50:51] hands is up too
[1:50:52] hey God I believe the promises of your
[1:50:54] word to be true
[1:50:56] the Lord knows this morning they're
[1:50:58] streaming that would maybe want to be in
[1:51:00] service and decaying because of health
[1:51:02] reasons Lord
[1:51:04] may you touch him right there where
[1:51:06] they're at in their living room Lord
[1:51:08] sitting there looking at their computer
[1:51:11] may you touch them Lord
[1:51:14] good father you see every hand that's
[1:51:15] raised today we take the antidote
[1:51:18] against discouragement Against The
[1:51:20] Scourge in times that we're in Lord when
[1:51:22] the world is falling apart all around us
[1:51:24] every day there's more killings and
[1:51:26] robberies and this and that and oh it's
[1:51:28] getting to be such an unfit place for us
[1:51:30] to live but father that's not
[1:51:31] discouraging to us even though it's a
[1:51:33] discouraging time to them because that's
[1:51:35] all they've got but Lord to us father
[1:51:38] to us it's just another sign of our soon
[1:51:42] coming
[1:51:43] they're soon coming to take us Lord
[1:51:44] because we know you'll not leave us here
[1:51:46] much longer
[1:51:47] in the world in this condition
[1:51:50] so I will not be shaken I will not be
[1:51:53] moved
[1:51:54] but I believe in you father
[1:51:57] for your promises are true
[1:52:00] father you see the hands today
[1:52:02] by the same anointing that raised my
[1:52:04] Lord from the grave
[1:52:05] but that same minority they gave my
[1:52:07] daughter back to me
[1:52:09] but then already move about every heart
[1:52:11] this morning Lord

[1:52:16] I will never struggle
[1:52:18] upon every
[1:52:19] middle issue every spiritual issue
[1:52:23] but you move upon each one today God
[1:52:26] and we cast down reason and we cast down
[1:52:28] fear and we cast down doubt
