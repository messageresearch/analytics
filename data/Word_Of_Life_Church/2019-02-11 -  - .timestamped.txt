[0:00] you cannot hide from God you cannot hide
[0:05] from God you can hide from me you can
[0:09] hide from your pastor you can hide from
[0:12] your wife you could hide things from
[0:14] your husband you could hide things from
[0:16] your children but you can't hide from
[0:18] God God sees everything he knows the
[0:21] intention of your heart for every choice
[0:23] that you make every decision everything
[0:26] that you say in conversation God looks
[0:28] at one thing your heart and God the
[0:31] Bible says he who searches the heart and
[0:33] knows the mind so God knows us inside
[0:36] and out you cannot hide from God the
[0:39] Bible says in Ecclesiastes 8:11 because
[0:42] senate's against an evil work is not
[0:45] executed speedily therefore the heart of
[0:49] the sons of men is fully setting them to
[0:51] do evil another word Solomon says that
[0:54] just because we don't reap what we sow
[0:57] over night doesn't mean that we don't
[1:00] reap what we sow but the Bible says God
[1:03] will not be mocked whatsoever a person
[1:06] shows that person shall also reap but
[1:11] the Bible says because sin it's because
[1:13] that reaping doesn't always happen
[1:15] overnight you can live a life in sin for
[1:18] years thinking you're getting away with
[1:20] it you can live a life in secret sin for
[1:23] 10 years 15 years and think just because
[1:27] judgment has not been passed that
[1:28] somehow we've slipped by or somehow
[1:31] we've gotten by God but understand this
[1:34] you shall reap what you sow you know
[1:38] many times we could pray for children
[1:40] for years and not see anything in wonder
[1:43] if God's here in our prayer and then one
[1:45] day the appointed time comes and that
[1:47] seed that you've been watering for years
[1:50] and years and years comes the harvest
[1:52] we're told of a bamboo seed that the
[1:55] heart the farmer that plants a bamboo
[1:57] seed he has to plant that thing in faith
[2:00] because it's very different than other
[2:02] seeds you see usually a farmer and human
[2:05] nature is to work based upon what we see
[2:08] if we don't see results we give up
[2:12] and so a farmer under normal
[2:13] circumstances plants the seed puts it in
[2:16] the ground and begins to water it he
[2:18] begins to labor for that seed he begins
[2:21] to give it sunlight he begins to nourish
[2:23] it and address it and the next day he
[2:25] comes and maybe there's a sprout up and
[2:28] maybe there's a green leaf and he's told
[2:30] by that sign that my efforts are paying
[2:33] off but the farmer who plants a bamboo
[2:35] seed is very different because although
[2:38] he waters it although he dresses it
[2:40] although he nourishes it for days and I
[2:43] forget how long the process I think it's
[2:45] something like six months he sees
[2:48] absolutely no sign whatsoever that his
[2:52] efforts have done anything at all the
[2:55] only thing he can do is put faith in the
[2:58] process the only thing he could do is
[3:00] put faith in nature knowing that nature
[3:03] will run its course and after six months
[3:06] of just doing the same thing over it's
[3:09] much like when you pray over and over
[3:11] and over and over and you wonder is God
[3:14] ever going to hear my prayer is anything
[3:16] ever gonna change am I ever gonna reap
[3:18] the harvest of what I've been sowing but
[3:21] after six months that tree that bamboo
[3:24] shoot' shoots up six feet tall in just a
[3:27] couple weeks you know this is the way it
[3:32] is with sin for many years we could sow
[3:35] the wrong seed and think that we don't
[3:38] see any result from it so it's okay and
[3:40] something starts so small in our heart
[3:43] your sin will find you out the Bible
[3:46] says in numbers 32:23 if you will not do
[3:50] so behold you have sinned against the
[3:52] Lord and be sure be sure your sin will
[4:00] find you out the Bible paints a very
[4:04] amazing picture of a man who thinks he's
[4:09] sinning and getting away much like a
[4:11] fugitive you know when a fugitive a
[4:13] person commits a sin person commits some
[4:15] heinous act and he goes on the run
[4:18] running from the police running from the
[4:20] government running from the law and that
[4:22] man thinks he can get away with her now
[4:24] boy
[4:25] I really pulled one over I really pulled
[4:27] one over no one's ever gonna know and I
[4:29] got away with it and now I got all this
[4:32] money or whatever the profit was but the
[4:35] part that you don't see is the man his
[4:37] entire life he's always looking behind
[4:39] his shoulder he's always miserable
[4:42] wondering if anybody's gonna find out
[4:43] and eventually that pressure will cause
[4:46] him to make a mistake and the law the
[4:49] whole time is chasing him looking for
[4:51] him watching for him watching they know
[4:53] eventually he'll make a mistake and this
[4:56] is the picture that the Bible paints for
[4:59] a man running from God and your sin
[5:03] literally follows you and haunts you and
[5:07] chases you you may move from church to
[5:09] church you may move from place to place
[5:12] but you can't outrun God you can't
[5:15] outrun the Spirit of God if you're a son
[5:19] of God he'll chase you he'll haunt you
[5:21] he'll bring you to justice
[5:27] and the Bible says the wages of sin what
[5:32] it pays its payment you know what it
[5:34] pays death
[5:36] pleasure for a season thinking that
[5:40] we've gotten away Isaiah 29 15 and 16
[5:43] woolen - they'll wall unto them that
[5:45] seek deep to hide their counsel from the
[5:48] Lord and their works are in the dark and
[5:50] they say who sees us and who knoweth us
[5:54] no one's gonna find out this just
[5:56] happened once
[5:57] she'll never know he'll never know I can
[5:59] just cover it up it'll be okay and I'll
[6:01] just move on and the pain that it would
[6:03] cost him for me to confess that would be
[6:04] greater than the reward you know who's
[6:07] talking to you the liar the father of
[6:12] lies
[6:14] are you here this morning woe unto them
[6:19] now listen job 34 21 says for his whose
[6:24] God's his eyes are upon the ways of man
[6:29] and he seeth all his goings there is no
[6:33] darkness nor shadow of death where the
[6:36] workers of iniquity may hide themselves
[6:41] human beings think they can hide from
[6:44] God and eventually this secret sin
[6:48] begins to drive us from the presence of
[6:50] God the first thing that Adam and Eve do
[6:53] after the Fallen nature comes in after
[6:56] that after the fall happens
[6:57] one of the first attributes is to hide
[7:00] to cover up to make a religion to ease
[7:05] the conscience to cover themselves and
[7:08] the first thing that a person a
[7:11] Christian will do after living a life of
[7:13] sin that no one knows about they'll
[7:16] begin to hide themselves Satan will know
[7:20] you don't know what you don't to know
[7:21] what the devil will do to you he'll push
[7:22] you away from church he'll push you away
[7:24] from fellowship he'll push you away from
[7:27] brothers and sisters you'll become
[7:29] reclusive as is not attributes of God
[7:34] the Bible says in him there is no
[7:36] darkness at all there is only light
[7:40] there is only exposure listen Christians
[7:43] should be the most transparent people on
[7:46] the face of the earth we have nothing to
[7:49] hide we have nothing to run from it is
[7:53] the devil who pushes you into a closet
[7:55] it is the devil who tells you don't
[7:58] confess don't make it right it is the
[8:01] devil who puts fear in your heart to
[8:03] stay under that religious cloak
