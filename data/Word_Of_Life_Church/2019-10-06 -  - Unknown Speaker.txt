china up tonight y'all getting dinner on a paper plate so are you but if God cooks it I'd eat it off the ground so but I appreciate this opportunity and somebody asked me before said the you nervous when brother Donnie's there well I said yeah I'm nervous but I'm glad he's there because nobody pulls like he does and now that he's here that's how just whistling in a graveyard I'm really nervous man stuff but I believe if we give way to him you know and and let him make us calm and relaxed and you know you don't what I got anyway you didn't come here for that and I am Who I am I'm not gonna try to be nobody else and I it up brother Jimmy Babb told me one time he said brother Joe you can't eat until it's chopped up so we're gonna puree this thing up tonight it's open but if you have your Bibles go ahead and go to the word last couple of weeks to three weeks ago I'd started studying on the subject that I entitled blaming God and I won brother Donnie you asked me a couple days ago and on a couple weeks ago so I didn't get a whole lot of notice I just I did a youth service here Monday night and before I go any further let me tell you parents are the most blessed people to see you young people sitting here the way they did Monday night oh just pull it out of you it was wonderful it any any minister in this age would have enjoyed the preach in front of him but I had to stop better I'm gonna be a mess here a minute so I had this thought that I gave brought to him it's called the battles not yours and their Lord just kept I had about four pages of notes result Monday night it was a pretty simple subject but I've actually pulled more out of me than I had and so I continued to study on it this week and I'd like to to bring that to you tonight if you don't mind if you've got your Bibles you can turn to 2nd chronicles 2013 and 7 brother Brad Ewing's sister Sarah and forgive me you're gonna hear some of the kind of background on what we talked about Monday and all Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children then upon Joe hey zo the son of Zechariah the son had been an eye of the son of JL the son of mattaniah a Levite they didn't say was a prophet they said he was a Levite he was a minister this was this man was a minister not a prophet came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all Judah ye inhabitants of Jerusalem now King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods tomorrow go you down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of junior Jael you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand you steal and see the salvation of the Lord with you Oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you let's read the blessings on his word Heavenly Father we thank you for another day Lord Lord another day that you've gave us to serve you to live for you father I'm so thankful Lord I'm I'm thankful for this opportunity Lord I know I'm nervous Lord I'm all the pieces standing here father but it's not about me and about how I feel Lord it's about you feeding your bride it's about you telling your your bride Lord how you feel about her things that you wanted to know for all the things that'll make your better maker stronger make her closer to you father it's about you tonight Lord so Lord we bring this to you tonight Lord we ask you to get us out of the way set us aside Lord as the word comes forth from this vessel Lord I need things in my life too I need a stronger walk everyone here does Lord we're not exempt from from you giving us strength in our lives father I pray this you anoint the word anoint it ears to hear Lord and we welcome you have your way tonight in Jesus name amen you can be seated I'm going to give a little testimony here why this particular subject is means so much to me in each one of you could you have your own testimony a couple years ago church was going through some things here but the Jimmy and bad brothers you may hope it's alright brother Jimmy brother Donny probably got the brunt of it more than anybody and I was I was at work one day and you ever feel the urge to do something to the point that very few things in my life that I have felt like the Lord just grabbed my shirt collar and pulled me to do something and this was one of them I think the Lord didn't tell me in the audible voice but Lord spoken my heart said go pray with brother Jimmy so I come up here brother Jimmy was the only one in the library at the time and I told him I said whether Jimmy I I've got to pray with you Lord's telling me to pray with you so we got to battle daily brothers Jimmy and we prayed and you say brother Joe did the problem go away I have no idea I never had a burden with for again from that day I never had another burden for that the Lord lifted that weight off of me and it just said something and you'll to see me when I'm in the libraries sometimes I call brother Jimmy a winner winner's circle is pretty great in it but Jimmy that's where every one of us should be tonight in the winner's circle as Jehoshaphat hears is getting ready going this battle this particular scripture in the bible has happened to every single child of God this is a part of your life and you come in here on Wednesdays and Saturdays and Sundays and jahaziel stands up here and tells you the battle is not yours so Jay hey zo brought a sermon to Jehoshaphat and Judah that day that's he titled that the battles not yours and so coincidentally that's the title of my sermon so I'm not the first one to preach this so if we can background for a little bit on Jehoshaphat here Jehoshaphat father if you know was was ASA and ASA was one of the first kings since David to go in and tear down all the the idol worship that the the high places they said ASA even even disposed of his grandmother because his grandmother had all these these these idol temples and in these groves built and he destroyed them all so and ASA had kind of dealt with the same thing the Jehoshaphat's getting ready to come through and jajaja ASA prayed to the lord said will your people you're our God please fight for us do this for us and ASA had 35 years of peace thirty-five years of peace so war hadn't been in Judah for thirty-four over 35 years and here's Jehoshaphat he's in the land that God gave him they have all this these things that God gave him and for some reason the men UIC's the ammonites and the Moabites decide they're going to come take it but Jehoshaphat he didn't he didn't get all worked up and I don't know if they have it on the screen but I I brought up the amplified version amplified version of jehoshaphat sprayer Jehoshaphat says Oh Lord God of Our Fathers are you not God in heaven do you not rule over all the kingdoms of the nation's power and might are in your hand there was no one able to stand against you O our God did not you drive out the inhabitants this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the sentence of your friend Abraham they have lived in it and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name saying if an evil comes upon us or the sword of judgment or the plague or the famine we will we shall withstand I want you to remember that we will stand we're gonna get into that here in a minute ladies 10 we're gonna stand you didn't say we're gonna fight he didn't say we're gonna do this that buddy said we're gonna stand we're going to stand before this house and before you and for your name and your presence is in this house and we will cry out to you in our distress and you will hear and save us he had no doubts what God was going to do he said god I'm going to ask for this and you're going to give it now behold the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir whom you have not allowed Israel to invade when they come from the land of Egypt for they have turned away from them and do not did not destroy them here they are rewarding us by coming to drive out us out of our out of your possessions Lord they're driving us out of what you've given us they're driving us out of what is really yours so here these enemies of Judah they're standing on God's ground when we talk to them the name of the wilderness of Jerry ul it's it's founded by God that's what it means founded by God God tells him said you go to the edge of that which is mine and you stand there and you wait there I'll fight for what's mine that this is my possessions the enemy's not going to take my possessions you stand off of it just stand there rewarding us by coming to drive out drive us out of your possession which you have given us as an inheritance Oh our God will you not judge them for we are powerless against this great multitude which is coming against us he was right the Bible says I told you young people of the night there was a worthy adversary used to face him on your own you would have no chance absolutely no chance and Josif I knew that he wasn't saying you know weren't were nothing just nothing we're just nothing without you we are powerless against this great multitude which cometh against us we do not know what to do but our eyes are on you what a place to have your eyes you can have your eyes all over your circumstances you can have your eyes on your symptoms of your problem whatever your problem is you can you can look at look at your your loved ones that are fallen off you can have your eyes on that or you can have your eyes on him so Jehoshaphat is is saying we're going to stand and trust you we don't know what we wouldn't know what to do is totally relevant just because you don't know what to do that means nothing to God God don't need you know how anyway that's where we get messed up is when we get to the point we figured out how to fix it jehosophat didn't even try to fix it they didn't attempt to fix it they said my eyes are on you look at look at look at the military military does not move until the captain or the general who had ever tells him what to do and where to go what maneuvers to make so let's remember what they were fighting this kind of look at what they were fighting for this is land that was promised to him when God promised this to Abraham many many years before he said this this land is yours and that and to your seed as many as your seed shall be as the stars of the heavens the sands of the Seas and this is what they're fighting for well Bram says in possessing all things then like when Abraham what did God tell him this land belongs to you what's in it is yours look east north west and south it's all yours everything here I want you to come journey in a strange land I'm going to make you heir of that land I'll give you this to you and your seed for it forever you a forever now Abraham only thing he had to do was put his faith on that promise pick up his sword and take off when the crucial moment came he got down there and God fought his battle and when he fought the battle he slaughtered the kings everybody here is gonna fight something everybody here is fighting something this you got something in your life you got a problem everyone's different but there's not one single person in here that has a problem that you're not fighting that's part of being a son a daughter of God if you're not fighting everything anything you better check your life with the word because you're going to fight to gain anything you have to fight for it you probably might be a financial about me depressed you might be sickness might be disease it might be a lost loved one you might have a loved one on drugs you might have a lost husband a lost wife everybody has got something you might struggle with bitterness you might struggle with with jealousy you might struggle with different things in your life the Sun that does not make you take you away from being a seed to God you can rest assured if you're fighting Satan and got you if you're fighting Satan's not on the ground that you're possessing but you're gonna fight for everything God gave you God's just not gonna hand it to you you're not you're not just going to reach out and God's gonna hand it to you and you're gonna take it you're gonna sit down and get under a palm tree and sip lemonade it don't work that way you're on a battlefield every every day so you might wonder to yourself why why am I not gaining ground why why am i am I going nowhere everybody goes through those times everybody goes through the time Emeril brother branham said God didn't talk to him for for a long time he didn't feel his presence didn't feel anything you know if the Prophet if the Prophet was that way if God would pull himself away from the Prophet and fill in his presence and not talking to him who are we you know God uses those times to see what you do to Moche or shape you if you can trust God in the times if you could trust God in the times when you feel him nowhere well you know you've got these days we've all had them when you go to work and you feel just like it's so down like this heavy weight is on your chest and you don't know what to do and it's day after day the same weight the same weight and Satan talking to you he's not there he don't hear you if you can trust God through those times but don't let that faith and that trust waver in those times you're gaining ground you don't even know you're possessing more ground let's just let's read this I told young people I think the scripture here I've read it just about an half hour more of my sermons but I love it James 4:7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you submit it's a military term to arrange true provisions in a military fashion under command of a leader now when we think of resist we're going to look at this word what we would think of resist sometimes you think of you know over in the third world countries are in Ireland places you know they've got these these rebels they call the resistance and they go out and they force warfare upon their opponent that's ain't what this means it doesn't say fight the devil and he will flee from you it doesn't say gather an army together get all your brothers and sisters together and you're not moving unless you get called one great big parrot prayer meeting and you're going nowhere it says resist let's look at the word to win stand to make firm to fix establish to cause a person or a thing to keep his or its place so don't move when he says stand Joseph had says we will stand that's what he's saying we're going to resist let's look at the rest to stop stand still to stand in Mobile stand firm of the foundation of a building to continue safe and sound stand unharmed to stand ready or prepared to be a steadfast mind of quality one who does not hesitate and does not waver that does not mean for you to take it upon yourself to take care of your problem we get more trouble fixing our own problems and I can raise my hand on that I've gotten myself in so much trouble fixing my own problems and I might get in trouble fixing some more because I'm human I'm flesh but I pray to God those intervals in between me fixing my problems get greater and greater and my fixing gets less and less so that's what if we listen here this is what jzl is telling Jehoshaphat in him basically he's telling him James 4:7 submit yourself to God but God who gave you this possession the God who gave you this land and resists you stand in mobile you stand in tact you establish yourself on the place that God told you to stand and don't move always what baffled me how the children of Israel through their journeys through the wilderness you know brother branham and historians you know told you there's probably only a four days journey from from Egypt to the promised land but they wandered for we know they wandered 40 years it always baffled me that as soon as they get out of Egypt they seen the miracles in Egypt they seen the flies they seen the lies they seen the water turned the blood they see the firstborns killed of Egyptians all the miracles that God performed before they were left and then then when they leave they get up to the Red Sea and in the whole way here's a supernatural cloud in front of them there's a supernatural pillar of fire in front of them they know that's made of God they know that no man could done that and yet they murmured a complaint in the face of God if God Himself was to come into your room one day when you're complaining fussing about something simple that he could have fixed that you're complaining about it you're all tore about and you're just rest inside you don't know what to do and you can't believe this is happening to you and so if God Himself appeared in that in that room with you in a pillar fire in a body form whatever it was would you keep complaining and you knew it was God would you keep complaining would you still murmur would you say god I can't believe you let this come on me there's no it's impossible it would never happen but that's exactly what they were doing in the face of God and always it just always stumbled me I guess to say that how could they do that you see the miracles you see things in your life how is it that sometimes you know we testify that God has done this for us and done this force and the next problem arises we're complaining again didn't you just testify three months ago that he healed you bet he fixed the financial situation you was in your car was down you did broke down you didn't know what to do so you got on your knees and prayed two hours later it's running fine and there's some little thing hit us so we don't know what to do that that's that's life that's that's life as a human being but this this human being needs to learn to become subject to the word I told you know people of the night I absolutely believe that this bride is going to get to the point where it trusts God so much for every single thing that happens in her life it's going to bring her to such as point of maturity God ain't got no choice but to bring her out I absolutely believe that with all my heart brother Terry she's gonna reach that point of maturity which I why does God why does God fight your battles why why would God fight your battles we can throw a lot of we can throw a lot of guesswork and reasons out there yeah if a man was to come up for your wife at Walmart and salt her call her a filthy name would you fight her battle love is the only reason why God fights your battle you complete him just like your wife your wife completes you there's nothing anybody could ever do to my wife you know listen you said you you turn up your cheek if they hit me I might be what my cheek they hit you no I I just I'm sorry you know I'll ask forgiveness later but I hope I hope to god I would defend my wife's honor and that's that's what God is doing you are the queen of heaven and anybody or anything that comes against his queen he's going to fight this this was a promise he made before the foundation of the world before you were ever created I will fight your battles you don't have to do anything submit yourself to your husband and stand that's all he's saying so like I've seen it always to me and God showed herself God showed himself that he loved his room but she showed that he loved him time and time again and yet they complained they murmured nothing never happy with anything nothing got done him but God give him man out of heaven they complained he gave him quails out of heaven 40 years their clothes never never got old those shoes never wore out how would you like to get up 30 years later and put on a coat that you had 30 years ago and it's like brand-new and then complain it's impossible to lose when you give the battle to God if not if Israel had it if they had trusted God right from the get-go when they left in Egypt if they did trust him then they'd been there in four days but see they didn't trust God they didn't even trust God when they got into the land when God told him to destroy ever about everything in there push him out push him out that's what we talked about last time I preached here what I preached about the heirs possessions they didn't push him out and it came back later upon him and God said I'll do it for you so what battles are you fighting are you getting weary trying to fight these battles yourself I hope that myself and everybody in here leaves here tonight with a different outlook on the problems in your life because this is my second time preaching this this week so I've got no excuses in reading this you know I got think what do we fight what do the children of God fight every day and I was searching through the scriptures and I found in fission in 612 and I like the amplified version on that it brings it down to where I can understand it for our struggle is not against flesh and blood containing only with physical opponents but against the rulers against the powers against the world Force's of this present darkness against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly supernatural places that's what brother Branham said that a spiritual demon a religious demon was the worst demon there was when when you fight those when Satan comes against you when the pre pastor's up here and preachers up there preaching the word and Satan's talking you that's not right that's not right some spiritual demons that's what he's saying right here against the spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly supernatural places that Satan's battle he knows he can't tell you you know you're not a son or daughter of God he knows you've got that seal down in here but the ground that he wants to take from you the ground that he wants to take from you is is the things that come upon you and make you doubt that God can fight that battle for you he makes you think that you need to get your hands all over it what happens when we do that so as you fight these battles there was a few children Israel Joshua and Caleb you know that they didn't let the doubters get to them the complainers you're gonna have them you're gonna have them listen you look look at the if you want to call them message believers that have pulled away into their own thing you know some of you got family members that have done that and they talk to you and try to pull you out of this pull you away from the real Word of God try to pull you in something that it that was spawned out of hell listen it's real it's it's really you might not fight fight battles of lest you might not fought battles of alcohol and smoking and porn and all this stuff that might not be your battle your daily battle might be this message right here because that's the only thing Satan knows how to fight you with he knows this word back front front words the backwards and he knows the little parts of it that you struggle with so if you're struggling with something give it to God not I don't understand this I I have I have struggled with things in my life and prayed on the way to church lord I need I don't understand this I need this and sit right back there and it revealed this is ABC's to me when God fights for you ain't hard be it ain't it ain't hard but don't let somebody's unbelief stubble you I got an in study this I got to think about something about David that I never thought of before when when he went to to fight Goliath David went into the camp to bring his brother something to eat everybody there was bigger than him everybody was stronger than him everybody was more physically prepared everybody knew how to do battle everybody had more equipment everybody was older and all he heard was nobody in our army can beat that guy we're going to be defeated because when our best challenger if anybody gets enough nerve to go out there and fight Goliath he's going to kill him and then their armies gonna kill all of us how would you like to walk into your day like that to start your day with everybody saying you're going to be defeated today you're going to lose today you know that battle that you've been dreading for so long it's coming today and you're gonna lose how would you like to walk into that that's exactly what David walked into you but the thing about David he never listened to one single word he never listened to anything he said because David never trusted himself David had no trust in his own abilities when David got there he had no idea what he was going to he did you know God had a plan all David was was a puppet and God went through his playbook and said yeah I think I'll use the stone slingshot today and that's what happened David didn't figure this out next time I go up against somebody I'm gonna use my slingshot hey you you can't plan your battles ahead of time you can't plan on what you're going to do tomorrow when that battle hits you you can't plan for it baby didn't plan for it listen and I've used it before not and I apologize I mean if you be carnal but it's like a coach in a football game y'all think if some of y'all think that's carnal I pray you're forgiven but a coaching a football game all that player is doing is performing the mind of the coach he tells him this is what I want you to do and then go out there and do it that's all David was doing David was acting on the mind of the coach he said hey the coach said listen Dave this plan has never failed it's never failed one it's never been used before but it's never failed this is the first time and it's foolproof God didn't have to to test his product [Applause] so every time you come up in a new battle if you go if you let God into the battle it's not gonna fail God has not yet become up upon a problem that he don't know what to fix but yet in our minds God this is a new one this is a new one you've never done this before you've never had a problem like mine God probably right but it's still no problem God's Way of fixing thing is foolproof but he's never failed one time if he did he's not God so look at David David goes in here in all he's hearing is is all this negative stuff this is what's going to happen you know and there's no way we're defeated they were defeated without even picking up a sword they were defeated and God used David to fight the battle David absolutely no physical ability to beat life couldn't beat the life there's no it's impossible for a little ruddy guy like brother BAM called him probably a teenager it was impossible then for David without God to beat that giant it's impossible for you to fix your problem but you have someone like a battle listen like if nothing else you remember remember the title of my sermon tonight the battle is not yours God said I'll freely take it from you if you'll just let me have it instead Satan's job he'll make you think you're in the battle alone that's that's what he does it makes you think you have a better chance to do it your way listen in life story well Brent said that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone's talks about you and you talk about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself so if somebody talks about you and you fix him on Facebook I don't care if you use a scripture to fix them that ain't gone that's not God [Applause] let's use straightening them out on your own with no authority brother Bram says God can't fight your battle you're fighting it for yourself just let loose and let him do it just commit it to him the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is it committed to God well you can't do nothing about it just committed to him and God will take care of it do you believe that so why would we try to fix a problem on our own if God said I'll fix it for you I throw the young people with other night if an easy way for them to get the picture of what I'm saying is we play tug of war with God we'll take your problem and you play tug of war with God with your problem God says let me fix it for you you say no God I'm gonna fix it God says no let me fix it and you say no I think I got this this time and you plate it you're never gonna win you're never gonna win if you look if God says okay I'll let you fix it you're still not gonna win it's impossible he's trying to take the battle from you and you keep pulling it out of his hands you keep saying I'll fix it look and look at Moses in the Bible that's what he did it God said speak to the rock this was God's gameplan speak to the rock and I'll bring forth water but Moses smote the rock so Moses fixed the problem his way he didn't let God do it he done it himself we smite the rock and we wonder why sometimes we're not growing we're not getting blessed because we're smiting the rock in her life we're smiting and God can't move because you're doing it he says let me do it what was he supposed to do speak just speak stand and speak in pairs sometimes we do that in our kids life listen to me a minute we smite the rock and her kids life you wonder why your kid does not growing spiritually why your kid cannot overcome certain battles in his life while there's no growth spiritually he's coming in here she's coming in here a sitting service after service after service and you can't figure out what's wrong because every time they get a battle in their life you're fixing it for him you're pulling out the wallet you're pulling out the checkbook you're calling the school fixing their problem Hey if their son and daughter of God - they're going to go through battles and they don't need your hands on it it hurts sometimes it hurts to see our children go through things in life but God might be molding them and shaking them in such a way to make them stronger for a greater better that's coming and here we are putting our hands you know listen I love my kids and then if you see things that come in their life you know as you get older and you have kids you see your kids start to go through some of the battles that you went through and you think well I went through that I can help them with that no you can't I think God's will it's not God's will if God's wheels for him to to grow the way you grow through that battle you best keep your hands from it so don't play tug-of-war with your your kids battles either teach him to stand tell them say Johnny Suzie I'm sorry what you're going through I'm sorry you have to go through that battle I can't fix it but I know who can share with him the testimony of your battle share within what God brought you from how God got you through that battle teach him to pray teach him to read teach him to listen to the word LeBron said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord he will make the cripples walk he will let the devil who flick did you stand still and see the glory of God it's not your battle just stand still it's God battle God's battle don't be frustrated don't be upset stand still says I preach Christ the same yesterday today and forever stand still and see the glory of God it's not your battle begin with his God's battle it isn't your promise to begin with it's God promise and here I stand tonight it's not my worry define he's praying for a sister there he said it's not my worry to find out about this woman God promised to do that that's right I just stand still and see the glory of God does the work whenever brother Branham would they would have a prayer line and they would come up to him and God would show him but Branham didn't try to figure out what was wrong with him he said that's God's job you know and how many times did you you heard him say it God hasn't showed me he hasn't showed me he said that's that's God's that's that's an issue with God that's God's thing to do right that's not mine so don't you don't be trying to figure out love times we get problems off which are gonna try to figure out why it might be just to bring you closer to God there's no mystery behind it God's was trying to get you I don't know how many times I've had things in my life just drive me to my knees and I knew it I knew that's what God was want me to do things that come in my life and I and I was thinking why Lord why is this and almost instantly you need to pray more you need to get closer to God why why did God want me closer to him I'm his wife that's his desire let's let there it sits we can complicate it all we want God talked to our bowels cuz He loves us and he loves us and he wants us close it's about as simple as that well brain says that's right he said the guy it's God's promise to do it that's right I just stand stealing the glory of God does the work I put my I put one of my own words in it it wouldn't be right I don't put my words in I just stand still let God do it it works every time a lot of times you might get discouraged when it don't happen instantly yeah God didn't say as soon as you believe me I'm gonna let it happen but if he said it's gonna happen it's gonna happen I got to look and Gideon and study in this I think about Gideon god get him believe God but he was a little skeptical God told him I want to use you and just a few men to deliver the people okay god I believe you but let me put a fleece before you and God said okay okay god I believe you now that you confirmed that but then they put another fleece before you we do that Gideon was just being a human I'll read this I hope it's not too long it simply judges 6 and 11 there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was an Oprah that pertained to joash I don't know what he is and his son Gideon thresh tweet by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor first thing he told him when he come there the Lord's with you that was the very first words that he told him the Lord is with you Gideon knew he was an angel so if an angel came to you and said the Lord's with you you're gonna face a battle gods with you you're gonna overcome so would you believe him or would you be skeptical I know I would do because I've never seen it I've never seen an angel and I guess maybe this might have been common in Gideon's life I don't know but Gideon was skeptical and God had to prove to him God they had to humor Gideon me I'll humor you give me another fleece and that happens in our lives I've done it I've asked God for things before and I say Lord if you could just show me some kind of sign there's nothing wrong with that brother brand I believe brother branham told this lady to pray to speak in tongues to confirm her you know that she had the Holy Ghost there's there's nothing wrong with that but I think God wants us to get to a point in our lives that when he says if we believe in trusting and that's it you know just listen standing will be so much easier if we if we learn to trust God that that's it just trust God anything you have in your life the problems that you have trust God to fight your battles if God if God allows a battle to come in your life he trusts you with it he knows you know he won't put him more on you than you can bear so if God puts a battle in your life he's not gonna put a too big of a battle that you can't get through he's not gonna give you something that's too overwhelming for you because nothing is too overwhelming for him and he's the ones going to be doing the fighting sometimes we look at the battle itself instead of the battle plan we look at the battle and that Satan's job in our life is to make us to look at the battle and put blinders on and alls we see what's in front of us and God says I've got the battle plan right here and when we totally forget the battle plan and the battle plan is just like I'll fight for you let me have it there's the battle in front of you you stand right here resist submit yourself to me and I'll fight for you listen if he ever gets to the point where he needs me to help him on our battles then God's in bad shape if he ever needs me because I'm a poor excuse for hell I can't even hardly help myself so I can't you know but I just don't see ever God getting to the point God says just remain motionless remain unmovable glue yourself to that spot and watch what I can do well the Bram says what more can God do be still now and know that he's God not it's not your battle they had prayed and he said to the army go down there and just stand still and watch my glory while they were two days packing the spoilers away he put the enemy in such confusion such a riot until they killed each other certainly and if you'll just be still now and know that God made you the promise he gave it by the Bible he confirmed it by his resurrection he showed it through his church he displayed it here tonight what more can he do what does God what does God have to do to get us the trustee if you if God's fighting for you people are gonna know it your life is going to be a testimony it's just this the bad part is is when you forget and other people remember I brought that out the other night with Rahab here the spies go into Jericho this body's going to Jericho and this is a Gentile dog nation and she began to testify what God done for me she knew what God had done for them they had forgot 40 years past they'd forgotten what God had done for him in Egypt they had forgotten what God done to him at the Red Sea what God had done to him all the way all the way through up to that journey they'd forgotten they were murmuring complaining the whole way and here's some Gentile dog tells him you remember what God done for you our host city Trimble's because of what God has done for you this is what Rahab tells him I know that the Lord hath given you this land and that a great fear of you is falling upon us the LORD hath given you the land the Lord has is gonna fight for you and the Lord is giving you this land she was test you was testifying it wasn't them she was testifying God was fighting their battles so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you we heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea because of you we heard how says for when you come out of Egypt what you did it Sion and all the two kings of the amorite east of the Jordan whom you completely destroy we heard of it our hearts melted in fear and everyone's courage failed because of you for the Lord your God in heaven your Lord Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below she was testifying that God was fighting their battles and if you're allowing God to fight your battles people are going to see it people are going to know it just don't get to the point where you forget if you if you if remembrance remembrance will strengthen your faith remember it strengthens faith anytime you get something in your life that drags you down the battle or something that comes up against you remember what he done for you remember what he done for your brothers and sisters listen I can't fight your battles for you back and stand with you I can be immovable with you I can resist with you this is a body move it's a body move don't don't think you're in this alone you're not in this alone but there ain't a single person here can fight your battle but everybody and you can stand with you that's a lot of faith that's a lot of faith like I've said it before there comes to a point in your life where sometimes you're too weak you're too sick here to discourage you too much in grief to have the right kind of faith that you need but the body heals itself so with everybody that's standing with you everybody that's trusting God with you everybody with you is allowing God standing still and watching God fights your battle with you that's a lot of faith that's a lot of trust in God we've been blessed as of telling tell him the other night if God never blesses me again never gives me one single blessing the rest of my life he's blessed me way more than I've ever could have to be blessed if God just the fact that God gave His only begotten Son to die on a cross that's more blessing than you ever deserve everything he gave you after that just added treasure that's because he loves you he's gonna he's going to give his wife things that's what he does he's gonna shower his wife with blessings he's gonna shower with with Lois love all's he asked her to do is trust that's all he's asking us to do is trust you're gonna walk out that door today tonight as soon as you walk out the door you're going to be in a battle you might be in a battle before you leave here Satan is not gonna like it when you come in here and listen to a battle plan he hates that worse than anything you're gonna come back in the morning you're gonna hear more on the battle plan that's what the word does it arms us it readies its fruit for the battles that light my head you know you know yeah sure we come in here we get blessed so many times we get we get blessed but they end result they end result of all the blessings that you get even even the weapons we get in here sometimes I'm gonna telling my wife [Music] this this is a roast brother Donnie my wife was telling me a couple months ago she said you know how visiting ministers come in there sorry honey you know visit ministers come in there and they start preaching hard and then they say I don't mean to preach hard at you she said don't they know who our pastor is so we take anything we have more love calluses than any Church in the message and I'm thankful but tonight as we stand you know me I don't go home I hope this has helped you it helped me in studying it I just you know it's impossible to lose when God's fighting for you it's impossible listen the Sun would fail to come up tomorrow is more likely than God not fine for you but I would trust in God more to fight my battles then I would the Sun would come up if we had another day that's how much I trust ya I'm gonna go through my I'm gonna go through my times brother Donnie where you know I'm gonna get discouraged as the battle I'm in it might be a new battle that I've never been in before but hey I know my redeemer liveth I know who fights my battles and we get to the point people gonna realize who's fighting for you people are gonna have to testify who your deliverer is who your Savior is who your warrior is you know I don't I don't I don't believe that area we got much more time I believe we're fighting in the hardest battles this Brides ever had ever on the face of the earth in the battles like us the young people have to fight nowadays it's unbelievable I have to deal with with young people in my work it's sad it's horrendous words cannot describe the things some of y'all that the work out there with that kind of stuff you see the way people are now the way they're raising their kids it's unbelievable it's it's Satan's Eden there's there's no doubt but he said while you're here I'll fight for you let's bow our hands if we can Heavenly Father lord I thank you for your presence tonight lord I thank you for speaking in my heart Lord Lord I thank you for the opportunity to share what you put on my heart Lord this particular subject is near and dear to me because Lord we live in an age where warfare on the bride Lord is it's reached to all-time high Satan has finding new ways to attack the bride Lord spiritually physically mentally but Lord we know that your plan is

our part and trust help us to do our part and stand just stand there Lord brother branham said Lord just stand and watch the glory of God wondered when we don't stand we messed things up we muddle it up Lord we get our hands on it we try to change the battle plan to fit our desire and our needs Lord sometimes your battle plan father bring a little more grief understand what we really wanted but or you know all things and you'll get glory in the end no matter what lord I pray that somebody was touched tonight Lord Lord I pray that this if one person walks out of here Lord a little stronger
