[25:00] [Music]
[25:12] [Music]
[25:31] praise God for grace the Book of Luke
[25:35] chapter 11 verse 42 Luke chapter 11
[25:42] verse 42 but woe unto you Pharisees for
[25:49] you tithe mint and Rue and all manner of
[25:53] herbs and pass over judgment and the
[25:59] love of God these ought you to have done
[26:03] and not leave the other undone woe unto
[26:09] you Pharisees for you love the uppermost
[26:11] seats in the synagogues and greetings in
[26:14] the markets woe unto you scribes and
[26:18] Pharisees hypocrites for ye are as
[26:21] graves which appear not and the men that
[26:25] walk over them are not aware of them you
[26:31] imagine this type of a man set that
[26:34] jesus said to deal with with the leaders
[26:36] of that day now as read in James chapter
[26:39] 4 verse 17 James says therefore to him
[26:46] that knoweth to do good and doeth it not
[26:53] to him it is sin
[26:58] that's simple but profound in it so if
[27:03] you know to do good and you just simply
[27:05] don't do it that's not that you're
[27:07] drinking or smoking or any of that but
[27:10] these are sins of omission something
[27:12] that you know that you should do and you
[27:14] have the opportunity to pay for today
[27:16] but you just do not do it according to
[27:19] the scripture it is sin may God forgive
[27:24] us all you believe this is true right
[27:31] let me read this to you a sin of
[27:33] omission is a sin that is the result of
[27:36] not doing something God's Word teaches
[27:39] that we should do it is generally used
[27:42] in contrast with the corresponding
[27:44] phrase the sin of commission or sins
[27:47] that a person actively commits so it is
[27:52] something that we know we should do and
[27:54] we just simply don't do it let's pray
[27:57] together Heavenly Father we love you
[28:00] today we're so thankful Lord Jesus for
[28:02] your great mercy we realize as we go on
[28:05] Lord God in time how merciful that you
[28:09] are not only to this world but to us to
[28:13] those of us your children who make such
[28:16] great professions of faith and of who we
[28:18] are we're grateful Lord Jesus that your
[28:21] light is illuminating our paths we're
[28:24] thankful father that you're showing us
[28:27] more and more about you more and more
[28:29] about us we'd like to take a look today
[28:33] not a casual glance but we want to take
[28:36] as it were almost a penetrating x-ray
[28:40] into the mirror of your word that we
[28:43] Heavenly Father might come away from
[28:46] that look and be better people speak to
[28:49] us today Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[28:52] god bless your children you may be
[28:55] seated
[28:55] I want to speak to you today on three
[28:58] words leaving things and
[29:02] leaving things undone one commentary
[29:06] describes the neglect of known duty in
[29:10] this way it is a sin of knowledge
[29:13] without practice so it's actually
[29:16] knowing something but yet you don't do
[29:20] it now when James was inspired you know
[29:23] James lacked certainly liked the
[29:27] comparative revelation that Paul had on
[29:29] many things there was many things that
[29:32] Paul wrote James he just wasn't he just
[29:34] wasn't enlightened to it but yet the
[29:37] book of James is a very small book his
[29:38] foster brother of the Lord Jesus as you
[29:40] know but yet the things that he did
[29:42] write it God gave him some insight about
[29:45] it and this is one of the things that he
[29:47] addresses without actually Peter nor
[29:49] Paul and one of the rest of them
[29:51] actually did was quite in this same way
[29:52] so God gave him an insight to be able to
[29:56] look at us and he says that therefore to
[29:58] him that knoweth to do good and do is
[30:01] that not to him it is sin and when we
[30:04] think of what God has placed us on the
[30:06] earth is the highest privilege first of
[30:08] all for any of us is to be able to serve
[30:10] the Lord we would agree with that
[30:11] to be able to live for him and to be
[30:13] able to give our lives totally and
[30:15] completely to him then what would be the
[30:17] next greatest privilege that God has
[30:20] given us on the earth the next whether
[30:22] or not you believe it the next greatest
[30:24] privilege is for us to be able to help
[30:26] mankind it is to be able to love God and
[30:29] then to love our neighbor as ourself so
[30:32] to be able to alleviate problems to be
[30:34] able to help people to be able to do
[30:36] what we can to make it better for them
[30:38] it's part of what we're here for and you
[30:41] think that for many people that get
[30:42] secluded in their own little world to
[30:45] where they live to themself and them and
[30:46] their family and the outer ranks of
[30:48] their family and that's pretty much as
[30:50] far as they go they pray for them and
[30:52] they don't really concern themselves
[30:53] with other things it's a very selfish
[30:55] life and it's not a Christ identified
[30:58] life because Christ's life is denying
[31:01] yourself and actually living for others
[31:03] so looking eternal life in the face is
[31:05] when we're doing it now whenever James
[31:07] says this James doesn't just pull this
[31:09] out of the sky and say now to him that
[31:11] knows to do good and you don't do it
[31:13] to you at sim but what is he referring
[31:15] to what doing good is he talking about
[31:19] did he make references prior to this
[31:22] statement was he referring to things
[31:24] that Paul had said was he talking about
[31:26] all good so I would like to look at
[31:28] today by the help of the Lord his things
[31:30] that James had mentioned in his epistle
[31:33] prior to saying this that to know to do
[31:36] good and to do it not to you at sin so
[31:37] what did he set aside but what God had
[31:40] given him that was good for us to do
[31:43] would you like to take a look there this
[31:44] morning
[31:45] mr. King James chapter 1 verse 2 now
[31:48] some of these might seem quite simple to
[31:50] you but I believe they'll be a blessing
[31:51] to you my brethren count it all joy when
[31:54] you fall into divers temptations
[32:03] and may believes just the word do you
[32:06] believe this is good do you do it lord
[32:14] help us okay I remember you know this is
[32:18] good this is what the word says right my
[32:20] brethren eyes not speaking the sinners
[32:22] infidels like Gnostics babies speaking
[32:24] to us count it all joy when you fall
[32:26] into divers temptations now these are
[32:29] not temptations from Satan these are not
[32:32] temptations from evil it is not
[32:35] temptations of lusts well not any of us
[32:38] can be able to rejoice whenever we're
[32:40] suffering temptation from the devil
[32:42] that's torment even the Lord Jesus
[32:44] himself suffered temptation so this is
[32:47] not what James is referring to but he's
[32:49] actually using the same concept and the
[32:51] thought of God trying Abraham so
[32:54] whenever God then will try us are we to
[32:57] rejoice whenever the devil tempts us
[32:58] with lust or tempts us with this and
[33:00] that of course not that is the type of
[33:02] temptation that's going to bring very
[33:04] very excruciating spiritual pain to a
[33:07] son and daughter of God it's terrible
[33:09] the things that devil puts in your minds
[33:11] and puts in your heart and all that it's
[33:12] absolutely terrible but whenever God is
[33:15] trying us this is something that the
[33:17] word wants us to do to really count it
[33:20] all joy and to be able to rejoice
[33:23] because our heavenly father is trying us
[33:27] now notice he said my brethren count it
[33:30] all joy when you fall into divers
[33:32] temptations which is afflictions or
[33:35] persecutions for the sake of the gospel
[33:37] or even when God Himself is trying your
[33:41] faith as he did Abraham now notice the
[33:43] next verse proves this what I'm saying
[33:45] to you knowing this that the trying of
[33:49] your face worketh patience so here we're
[33:52] not talking about sexual temptation in
[33:55] temptations of the flesh but it when in
[33:57] our faith is being tried by God Himself
[34:00] then we're supposed to count it all joy
[34:02] now this is good
[34:05] but it's not good when we don't do it so
[34:08] whenever we are being tested by God
[34:10] tried by God you're praying and praying
[34:13] and asking God to do something for you
[34:15] and it seemed like God is delay or God
[34:18] isn't answering when you think he ought
[34:20] to instead of us being sad and morbid
[34:23] and all defeated and all down the word
[34:25] says count it all joy now remember James
[34:31] says to him that knows to do good and
[34:33] doesn't do it
[34:38] praise the Lord
[34:40] now God does not afflict us God does not
[34:45] try us because he gets something out of
[34:48] seeing his children suffer from trials
[34:52] from God is never because God is a mean
[34:55] hateful contrary God and it actually
[34:58] brings him some type of joy to watch you
[35:01] go through something but when God and
[35:03] His wisdom allows us to go through
[35:05] something it is for our benefit we
[35:07] believe that knowing it is for our
[35:09] benefit it is for our good then if God
[35:11] will allow our face to be tried why
[35:14] would he do that in order to prove to us
[35:17] he done knows the quality and content of
[35:20] our faith but it is to prove to us that
[35:23] our faith is true and genuine now others
[35:26] are twofold in this that he said knowing
[35:28] this that the trying of your faith
[35:30] worketh patience so the trial I don't
[35:34] understand how it works
[35:35] but just knowing what the scripture says
[35:36] that the trying of your faith will
[35:39] actually work or produce when it Romans
[35:41] in Romans 5 where Paul said tribulation
[35:44] worketh patience patience experience
[35:45] experience hope hope maketh not ashamed
[35:47] for the love of God has been shed abroad
[35:49] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[35:51] given unto us so there's something about
[35:53] the trying of faith and the outcome of
[35:56] that trying not only makes faith
[35:58] stronger and makes faith to appear more
[36:00] genuine but it actually works patience
[36:03] out of the trying of your faith who but
[36:05] God could tried face and get stronger
[36:07] patience out of that trial who but God
[36:10] was able to figure out such a program
[36:12] that in trying our
[36:13] faith it would actually make our
[36:15] patients John I mean needs more patients
[36:23] how many wants the process to get him
[36:26] praise the Lord it always works out that
[36:29] way
[36:30] tribulation worketh patience of our face
[36:34] will produce this type of patience and
[36:37] then during that time when we look at it
[36:39] can't you see why we should have joy cuz
[36:43] to assent oh my goodness he's trying my
[36:45] face then the outcome of this will give
[36:48] me more patience and I need more
[36:51] pleasure so I'm gonna go ahead and
[36:52] rejoice before I get it but instead we
[36:57] drag and drag and drag and we can't wait
[37:00] til it's over and we hang our heads down
[37:02] and all my wins this ever gonna pass
[37:05] when's it ever going to pass and the
[37:07] longer it goes the worse we get when it
[37:09] should be the longer it goes that means
[37:10] that God is trying us and bringing
[37:12] something out of our patience praise the
[37:14] Lord that should be that now it will
[37:16] come by degrees and remember we do not
[37:19] get this mature type of patience just as
[37:22] soon as we become a Christian give our
[37:24] heart to God but it will come by degrees
[37:26] and God knows better than to try to
[37:29] reach a Natur adult degrees for patience
[37:32] on a new convert it will not work it
[37:34] will want that convert out so God will
[37:37] let it go by degrees notice in James
[37:40] goes on to say but let patience have her
[37:43] perfect to work or the effect which is
[37:46] brought into perfection let patient
[37:49] notice how identifies it as a heard let
[37:52] patience have her perfect work now what
[37:55] is it to denote this sincerity and the
[37:58] strength of what that patience is
[38:00] supposed to be that patients have her
[38:02] perfect work that ye may be perfect
[38:05] which is fully developed in the
[38:07] Christian attributes that you may be
[38:09] perfect and entire wanting nothing now
[38:12] how is that going to happen as soon as
[38:14] you and I pray God gives it to us that
[38:16] makes us more impatient than we were
[38:18] before
[38:19] so in this age when everything is
[38:21] instant instant coffee instant potatoes
[38:23] in
[38:24] drive-through instant this instant that
[38:26] instant message and we want instant
[38:28] patience and God said nope
[38:30] I'll still make patience the same way I
[38:31] made it for six thousand years
[38:33] God don't have drive-through character
[38:35] God don't have drive-through patient he
[38:37] has it the same way he's always had it
[38:40] which makes it hard in this little sense
[38:46] some of you want God to start delivering
[38:49] the way Amazon is wanting to start
[38:51] delivering their packages I'm sure
[38:53] you've heard about that everywhere
[38:54] Amazon is one before the Congress and
[38:56] all that well they can get little
[38:57] clothes and little robot type airplanes
[39:00] to wear that if you order some from
[39:01] Amazon they'll drop it right down on
[39:03] your little ports about tomorrow that's
[39:05] the way we want character that's the way
[39:08] we want patience that's the way we want
[39:10] all the things of God but God don't run
[39:12] a drone Factory God don't on the next
[39:14] day delivery God ain't you FedEx or UPS
[39:16] God does it the same way he's always
[39:19] done it and listen it makes it more hard
[39:22] for us than it would the people in the
[39:24] days of Jamestown because in the days of
[39:27] James that did not have text that did
[39:29] not have emails it will take months and
[39:31] months and maybe even a year for you get
[39:33] a letter from one side of the earth to
[39:35] the other unlike us today so everything
[39:38] was much slower pace every single slower
[39:40] but today in the rapid pace of
[39:42] everything and we want God the same way
[39:45] friends we got to slow down and relax
[39:47] and realize it ain't gonna come at our
[39:49] pace so let's read this let patience
[39:59] have her perfect something was getting
[40:05] to offense also did work that she may be
[40:10] perfect and in you can't stand it can
[40:15] you you're wanting to fast forward me so
[40:17] fast you can't stand it why it's part of
[40:20] that layer to see a thing we're living
[40:22] in
[40:26] that you may be perfect and entire which
[40:31] is having all of its parts complete
[40:35] wanting no integral part your whole
[40:38] literally your entire spirit soul and
[40:42] body implies without a blemish and its
[40:46] parts you mean I don't get that by
[40:49] doctrine I don't get that by believing
[40:52] the seven seals or the seven thunders or
[40:54] the butt rouge or or something you mean
[40:57] I can only get this by my faith being
[41:00] tried which renders out patients which
[41:03] producing me the perfect work that God
[41:05] wants praise the Lord
[41:08] that you may be perfect and entire
[41:11] wanting nothing either not failing nor
[41:14] fainting in trials that you will not
[41:17] faint in trial so when you are tested
[41:20] right to the very extreme and it goes
[41:22] beyond what you even comprehend that
[41:25] you're able to take back this type of
[41:26] perfection brings you to a spot to where
[41:29] you will not fail in the most heated
[41:32] trial of your life that others without
[41:35] this will look at you and say how in the
[41:37] world can you take that and you say I
[41:39] honestly don't know
[41:41] it must be my god because I'm not able
[41:44] to barring such things I do not have the
[41:46] ability to deal with such thing
[41:48] it is the perfection of my father in my
[41:51] life let's read now in James chapter 1
[41:57] verse 19 wherefore my beloved brethren
[42:03] let every man be swift to hear slow to
[42:08] speak slow to wrath to him that knows to
[42:16] do good and does it not to him it is
[42:19] Santa the ancient philosophers have
[42:23] taken notice that men have two years and
[42:28] one tongue
[42:32] that they should hear more than they
[42:34] speak as also the ears are continually
[42:37] open ever ready to receive instruction
[42:40] while the tongue is surrounded by double
[42:43] row of teeth to hedge it in to keep it
[42:47] within proper bounds some of us should
[42:52] have had four sets of teeth let's lock
[42:58] in Cheney maybe a set of dentures with
[43:00] poly grip on the lips hey man
[43:05] now when James the ride saw this do you
[43:08] think it's just bumping his gums ain't
[43:10] got nothing else to write about no this
[43:12] is something that is beneficial to who
[43:14] the Brethren be swift to hear slow to
[43:17] speak and slow to rap now and what if
[43:21] every one of us sitting here today if we
[43:23] would apply this simple Word of God to
[43:25] our lives
[43:26] and make this an app in our life okay
[43:30] don'tdon't download this on your iPhone
[43:32] or your droid
[43:33] but download this into your life and
[43:35] make this an app that is constantly
[43:38] running in your life that your Swift to
[43:41] hear and so to speak does that mean
[43:43] gossip no sir does him in here say no
[43:45] sir it means sweat to hear that which is
[43:47] good that which is true whatsoever
[43:49] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[43:51] of a good report think on these things
[43:53] swift to hear slow to speak and soda ass
[43:57] you realize after this day it will be
[44:00] sin for you and I it will be sin the
[44:07] same thing as a woman cutting her hair a
[44:09] single thing is a man smoking cigarettes
[44:12] sin first not to apply this to our lives
[44:22] some of y'all wish you hadn't come to
[44:24] church I'm sure now watching verse 22 be
[44:30] doers of the word now many people have a
[44:36] mistaken idea that they feel like by
[44:39] hearing the word they have a compass
[44:43] such a great thing many folks feel that
[44:45] by listening to brother Branham by
[44:48] listening to a pastor by hearing the
[44:49] word by hearing the Bible go on in their
[44:51] cars or hold or reading the Bible that
[44:54] they're doing such a wonderful things
[44:56] they are if they will follow through
[44:58] with the rest of them but hearing is not
[45:02] doing not truly you can't do if you
[45:05] don't hear but if you just hear and
[45:07] don't do you're worse off than the
[45:09] person who don't hear now notice the way
[45:12] James put this but be doers of the word
[45:16] not hearers only now many Christians
[45:20] mark their Bibles they mark message
[45:24] quotes but their Bibles never mark them
[45:29] now it's one thing to take a highlighter
[45:31] and enable to underline and score and
[45:33] all that sort of thing sort of stick out
[45:35] to you but it's another thing entirely
[45:36] for that word to be able to so imprint
[45:40] upon your life that that highlighted
[45:42] portion of the word actually becomes you
[45:45] and you become the highlight then that
[45:48] word oh my that word actually becomes
[45:51] you in practice in everyday life now
[45:54] watch how James looks at this is quite
[45:56] an insight on this but be doers of the
[45:59] word and not hearers only now why
[46:02] deceiving your own selves so you mean a
[46:04] person who hears the word I got time at
[46:07] Dogma so he wouldn't be talking about
[46:09] other folks at others in nomination with
[46:11] churches but it would be folks who are
[46:13] setting under a ministry that's actually
[46:15] hearing bringing the word and they would
[46:17] sit there and hear the word but if they
[46:19] don't apply it there actually deceiving
[46:22] their self Wow how would they do that by
[46:25] convincing their self that hearing
[46:28] enough that doing it is not really that
[46:31] I will doing it is on their part and
[46:33] when they do that they actually deceived
[46:36] their self can you imagine it's not the
[46:38] devil doing it it's not demons how the
[46:40] hell but they are deceiving their self
[46:42] I'm okay that's fine I'll go to church I
[46:45] hear the word brother Don is my pasture
[46:47] brother man was my prophet did you do it
[46:49] no no no no but I hear it I believe it I
[46:51] believe it now what's in the next verse
[47:00] If any man be a hearer of the word and
[47:07] not a doer he is like unto a man
[47:12] beholding his natural face in a glass
[47:18] which is a mirror now once you look at
[47:22] this word natural I found this other day
[47:25] in Illinois when I was sitting steady
[47:26] and I'll tell you it just it just turned
[47:28] me inside out beholding his natural face
[47:33] Genesis the word natural is Genesis and
[47:40] it means generation source origin a book
[47:43] of one's lineage
[47:47] lord have mercy so when you looked into
[47:51] the mirror this morning when you got up
[47:53] you were looking into the book of your
[47:56] life you were seeing your Genesis human
[48:02] flesh mortality that needs help with God
[48:05] so then whenever we look into the meal
[48:08] what do we see what do we see when we
[48:12] look now James says in a man who loosen
[48:14] what he calls a glacier which it was a
[48:16] mirror but when a man looks into the
[48:18] mirror he said a man beholding his
[48:22] Genesis face and which his ancestry or
[48:26] progeny are enraged so when a man looks
[48:29] into the mirror he sees his Genesis so
[48:34] what does he see now there's a great
[48:36] difference between looking in a mirror
[48:38] and looking at a pitch
[48:39] you know what if we took a picture of
[48:42] you 20 years ago and we would take that
[48:44] picture and look you would sit and look
[48:47] at that picture and you look wild
[48:49] worried all them wrinkles come from
[48:50] weird dim gray hairs come from I
[48:52] wouldn't wearing glasses in Washoe was a
[48:54] lot skinnier than man what happened to
[48:57] me you're looking backwards now can you
[49:00] comb your hair by looking at a picture
[49:03] some of y'all could because you ain't
[49:05] gotten here as much as you had 20 years
[49:06] ago you might wish you there could you
[49:09] be able to get dirt off of your face or
[49:12] eggs or ketchup or something like that
[49:14] by looking at a picture of yourself do
[49:17] you have a picture of yourself in front
[49:19] of your sink where you comb your hair
[49:21] and shave your brother's do you have a
[49:24] picture of yourself
[49:25] what do you have a mirror there's one
[49:34] thing about a mirror it won't lie will
[49:36] it you can talk to it all day mirror
[49:39] mirror on the wall who's the fairest of
[49:42] them all and the mirror reflects only
[49:45] what you are if you got a big ol ugly
[49:47] nose that Mearing wanna you know
[49:49] prostate surgery oh my it's gonna take
[49:54] this I know the mirror shows what is in
[49:56] front of it and can't you see what a
[49:59] perfect parallel that the Word of God is
[50:01] this is why folks don't like this kind
[50:03] of preaching they want a preacher they
[50:06] don't preach to them from a photograph
[50:08] and sit of a mirror this is why this
[50:12] kind of preaching gets down on all of us
[50:14] where we live why because it helps us to
[50:17] see the way we really really are but I'm
[50:20] gonna tell you one thing today friend I
[50:22] don't want to just see what I am I want
[50:24] to see what I can be I want to look into
[50:27] another glass so the Word of God that
[50:29] points me to what I'm going to be by his
[50:31] grace
[50:35] and the main reason for owning mirrors
[50:38] how many have mirrors in your house your
[50:41] car some of you may have them on your
[50:44] phone I mean you may live what's it for
[50:48] decoration
[50:51] what's it for
[50:52] to look at yourself when you go out when
[50:56] you come to church whatever you want to
[50:57] look is presentable as possible
[51:00] can you imagine before the head mirrors
[51:03] the way everybody's hair must have
[51:05] looked everybody look bad and nobody
[51:10] knew the difference now what's it a
[51:17] thing when James writes this they did
[51:20] not have mirror the way we have today
[51:22] the mirrors were polished metal so they
[51:29] would have vaguely saw an image in this
[51:32] polished metal but it would've been so
[51:36] obscure at least she'd been able to tell
[51:38] you know something wasn't exactly right
[51:41] by holding this piece of polished metal
[51:44] but man has been able to develop more
[51:48] and more precise images with mirror even
[51:52] in the days of the Victorians whenever
[51:53] mirror was their total different process
[51:55] in the way it is today but as he goes on
[51:58] today when we look into the mirror we
[52:00] can see so plainly any blemishes and it
[52:03] falls and he has it's out of the place
[52:06] or whatever more now it was sleek of
[52:08] that in the light of the word in the
[52:10] days of loser in the days of Wesley this
[52:12] saying that it was more like a piece of
[52:14] polished metal or a piece of something
[52:17] that they looked at their self and
[52:18] losers were standing there smoking a
[52:20] pipe but he couldn't see himself in the
[52:22] word that that was wrong and Ingrid
[52:24] German he'd sit there and drink beer but
[52:26] looking in the mirror he couldn't see it
[52:28] but as a come on to Elsa it seemed that
[52:30] the Polish become a little bit broader
[52:32] and
[52:33] into a stage of sanctification and they
[52:35] realize man that part don't look hot in
[52:37] mom back me said you with a bottle of
[52:39] beer don't look on no sir that's not
[52:41] right it went on in the days of
[52:43] Pentecost he got a little more and then
[52:45] in the last days from the seventh angel
[52:47] car and the image of the Lord God
[52:50] revealed by the word became so clear
[52:53] that we look at ourselves now we see
[52:58] ever believe me ever saw don't you say
[53:05] what the words doing
[53:06] can't you say what the word is doing
[53:08] it's bringing us closer to the image in
[53:11] the mirror
[53:18] James mentions several mistakes that
[53:22] people make as they look into God's
[53:26] mirror first of all many of them just
[53:30] merely make a casual glance into the
[53:36] mirror good enough I look great a casual
[53:46] glance into a mirror can leave many
[53:50] imperfections in you can you imagine you
[53:56] coming to church this morning had egg on
[53:58] the side of your face your husband
[53:59] didn't tell you these children didn't
[54:01] tell you and then you go in the bathroom
[54:02] back to her sister you say dear Lord
[54:05] and over here gravy on with our jam over
[54:08] that biscuit down there
[54:09] coffee over here why did you alter what
[54:11] we didn't want to hurt your feelings mom
[54:13] I'd say you'll hurt ursin you get home
[54:18] now you tell me is your pastor if I see
[54:22] a guy on the side of your face
[54:23] spiritually them
[54:24] I see Jam over here and biscuit over and
[54:26] coffee over there do you would you not
[54:28] rather I would tell you then to wait
[54:30] unless you stand before the judgment
[54:32] seat and they'd be all over and then you
[54:34] look at me said brother Donnie why
[54:35] didn't you tell me well I didn't wanna
[54:37] hurt you Zealand
[54:46] many sincere people read their Bible
[54:49] every day
[54:50] I'll read the message every day or
[54:52] listen to a tape every day but it never
[54:56] becomes what God intended for it to be
[54:58] because they are actually taking a
[55:02] casual glance and it's something they
[55:05] just do them it's just part of their
[55:07] life it's something that they do and
[55:09] their conscience would feel terrible if
[55:12] they didn't daily read the scripture and
[55:14] have their daily devotion but actually
[55:17] their conscience should feel terrible
[55:19] because of the way they're doing it
[55:22] because instead of a deep x-ray into the
[55:26] soul that it can permeate all they're
[55:29] doing is a casual reading well the word
[55:32] says praise God thank you Lord Jesus
[55:35] that is so good and many of them have
[55:37] learned enough about the scripture to
[55:39] avoid issues in their lives so Psalms is
[55:43] always a favorite union generally never
[55:47] get in trouble with the genealogies
[55:48] they're generally okay but to really let
[55:54] the mirror of the word do an x-ray scan
[55:58] of your soul you can't just casually
[56:02] glance but you have to look deeply won't
[56:11] you listen to this and James he projects
[56:14] this the second mistake that people make
[56:18] is that they look into the word and then
[56:23] they forget what type of person it was
[56:27] so this person will actually be able to
[56:29] look beyond the casual glance and
[56:31] they're looking to see oh I need to be
[56:37] better I need you I need I need to quit
[56:39] Oh God forgive me Lord Jesus have mercy
[56:41] and then
[56:47] well I'm a work in progress I'm
[56:50] certainly not what I want to be and
[56:52] praise God I'm not what I used to be and
[56:54] all that but then they forget I forget
[57:00] what kind of person James calls these
[57:06] forgetful hearers
[57:10] now what's bad is it's not that they're
[57:13] so overwhelmed and their memory is all
[57:15] taxed out they are willingly forgetful
[57:21] you see if we really look into the
[57:26] mirror of the word and the mirror will
[57:29] show us in reality what we are in the
[57:33] caption of time then it will have an
[57:37] effect on us
[57:38] to where it will make us want to be a
[57:41] better person a different person let me
[57:45] read you this Isaiah said I said 6 and 5
[57:48] woe is me for I am undone
[57:53] Peter cried depart from me I'm a sinful
[57:56] man O Lord
[57:58] Luke 5:8 job is the most righteous man
[58:01] on earth in his day yet he confessed
[58:03] I abhor myself and repent in dust and
[58:08] ashes when a person really sees through
[58:13] a deep x-ray scan of the mirror of the
[58:16] word they'll not walk away conceited
[58:21] self-righteous like the elder brother
[58:23] was ice not but God forgive me god I'm
[58:27] so sorry
[58:27] touched me Lord and helped me to be a
[58:29] better person notice then the third
[58:35] mistake that many make is that they
[58:38] think hearing is doing that by being a
[58:43] part of the word and not take my stand
[58:46] for the word and I believe it with all
[58:47] of my heart and that's equivalent to
[58:50] obeying the word but of course we know
[58:52] that it is not and that you remember
[58:55] that for for many of the denominational
[58:57] type people of course which you know I
[58:58] had the mess
[58:58] do not listen to tapes as we do for many
[59:01] of them reading the word and you know
[59:02] having all these different things that's
[59:04] a great something for them for many
[59:05] message folks it's playing tapes so
[59:08] playing tapes they replace praying with
[59:10] playing tapes they replace many things
[59:13] they should do by playing thanks why
[59:15] because plain tapes is easier it's
[59:17] easier to play at a brother family this
[59:18] pray it's easy to play a tape a brother
[59:25] Brenda needs to love your neighbors face
[59:27] if they don't love you so what do we do
[59:30] we replace many of the doings just by
[59:33] playing the tape and by playing the
[59:34] table is I believe that a man prisoner I
[59:36] believe it and somehow it soothes our
[59:39] conscience so we've looked into the
[59:40] mirror and the mayor says you've got to
[59:42] do this you've got to do this you've got
[59:44] to do that and you've got to do that so
[59:46] what we do is substitute and put on a
[59:47] sermon and when they're all of listen to
[59:49] eight hours of tapes that's good I'm not
[59:51] I'm not against that at all but what
[59:54] about what you should have done that you
[59:59] left undone hmm so the mirror has a
[1:00:08] ministry and the Ministry the first fold
[1:00:13] of the mirror mirrors ministry is to
[1:00:17] show us what we are that's not a
[1:00:21] photograph so it doesn't show me what I
[1:00:22] was 26 27 years ago when I first came
[1:00:26] here to pass through this church it
[1:00:28] doesn't show me a dark headed young man
[1:00:31] it doesn't show me some of you that were
[1:00:34] 27 years younger than what you are today
[1:00:37] but it shows me what I am with these
[1:00:39] wrinkles and these hairs it's turning
[1:00:41] gray and it shows me so when I look into
[1:00:44] the mirror of the word it won't show me
[1:00:46] my wishes mirror mirror on the wall it's
[1:00:50] Donny the greatest preacher of them all
[1:00:52] mirror mirror on the wall is down the
[1:00:55] greatest beacon is Jimmy the greatest
[1:00:57] said oh tell me mirror there I have my
[1:00:59] plans
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:03] why because it's made to reflect that
[1:01:07] way and the mirror of the world now
[1:01:08] denominational mirror will tell you what
[1:01:11] you want to hear oh that's okay you
[1:01:13] can't live right God understands why you
[1:01:14] gave ever up maybe they'll let go these
[1:01:17] big churches around you today they'll
[1:01:19] have a mirror preacher set up and he'll
[1:01:21] make all kinds of excuses for why they
[1:01:22] can't live right but I'm one of God's
[1:01:25] true mirrors I'm gonna tell you the
[1:01:27] truth if it fries your hide your yours
[1:01:29] can smile like a piece of smoked bacon I
[1:01:31] want to tell you the truth because I
[1:01:32] don't want to be lost to myself and if I
[1:01:35] skirt around the issues God will hold me
[1:01:37] responsible for your soul and me and you
[1:01:40] both will be lost
[1:01:41] all I do tell you I can't make you live
[1:01:43] right God won't hold me responsible if
[1:01:45] you don't know that Betty will hold me
[1:01:47] responsible if I don't tell it notice in
[1:01:55] Exodus chapter 38 verse 8 Moses is going
[1:01:59] to make a Laver of brass and they need
[1:02:03] brass to make it out of and he made the
[1:02:06] labor of brass and the foot of it of
[1:02:08] brass of the looking glasses of the
[1:02:10] women assembling which is simple at the
[1:02:14] door the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:02:17] now the mirror of the first stage of the
[1:02:19] Ministry of the mirror is to be able to
[1:02:22] show us what we are what we're lacking
[1:02:24] what our shortcomings are never to
[1:02:26] pamper us never to move to our delights
[1:02:29] and our tastes but show us reality but
[1:02:32] if it left us so with all been a mess
[1:02:34] women but I don't want to just look and
[1:02:37] find that one my shortcomings are I want
[1:02:40] to look again I want to look again into
[1:02:45] the second stage of the Ministry of the
[1:02:48] mirror because in that is the stage that
[1:02:51] I need once I found out what my
[1:02:54] shortcomings are now many of you are so
[1:02:56] satisfied coming to church to get
[1:02:57] preached on you're so happy you're
[1:02:59] tickled to death praise God I got beat
[1:03:01] on and equipped on but it's like you
[1:03:03] don't make no change after the beat you
[1:03:05] can't wait to wince and I have to get
[1:03:07] beat on again and then you come back
[1:03:08] Saturday night
[1:03:09] your whole life is beaten I don't want
[1:03:12] to just be beat I want to be able to
[1:03:15] change I want to be a better person
[1:03:16] don't you I don't want to just be we've
[1:03:18] done all that I know I'm a son cuz
[1:03:20] I'm hooked on all the time well I know
[1:03:22] I'm a son too but I want to be able to
[1:03:24] take what the beat is all about and say
[1:03:26] god help me I don't do that again
[1:03:29] so the second stage of the ministry of
[1:03:32] the mirror is restoration now they're
[1:03:37] going to make this Laver of brass in
[1:03:40] order for the priests would wash their
[1:03:41] feet in their hands and then make it out
[1:03:43] of what mirrors of course the man at
[1:03:48] this time wasn't as sissified as they
[1:03:50] are today so the man didn't have mayor's
[1:03:51] in their pockets the women did which is
[1:03:56] woman's nature don't want to look pretty
[1:03:57] but today men want to look pretty pulled
[1:04:01] a little pretty things so they take this
[1:04:05] material I remember sunglass but it is
[1:04:08] brass material polished material and
[1:04:10] they take this and now it is refocus it
[1:04:14] is reshaped into what something that is
[1:04:17] going to provide a holding of the
[1:04:19] washing fluid of the water where the
[1:04:22] priests look up and they won't wash
[1:04:24] their hands and their feet now watch the
[1:04:25] mirror so the mirror is now reflected in
[1:04:28] that it not only shows you what you are
[1:04:30] but the mirror will actually wash you
[1:04:33] clean and lead you back to restoration I
[1:04:37] appreciate a man of God that'll tell us
[1:04:39] the truth but don't just tell me where
[1:04:41] I'm wrong leading me back to where I
[1:04:43] came to have peace with God don't just
[1:04:45] preach to me every service and beat me
[1:04:47] down but lead me back to peace was gone
[1:04:50] praise the Lord now whenever the mirror
[1:04:52] helps you and I to see what we are sees
[1:04:55] our shortcomings sees our fault and we
[1:04:57] look at ourselves we can wallow we can
[1:04:59] become message Catholics and we can
[1:05:01] wallow in the mirror we can wallow in
[1:05:03] our sorrow or we can say okay Lord let
[1:05:05] the second pole of this mirror lead me
[1:05:08] back to a restoration with peace with
[1:05:11] God
[1:05:11] I see I'm not
[1:05:13] the way I should I see I've not had the
[1:05:15] peace of God I'm not always had joy in
[1:05:17] the midst of trials Lord forgive me but
[1:05:19] I want the mirror to lead me to that
[1:05:22] place in you praise be to God
[1:05:27] so the washing of the water is a picture
[1:05:30] or a mirror of the work then what does
[1:05:32] it do whenever we see ourselves and look
[1:05:34] in the mirror then we come back to the
[1:05:35] cleansing of the blood little children I
[1:05:37] write unto you that you sin not but if
[1:05:39] any man sin we have an advocate of the
[1:05:41] Father which is a perpetuation of course
[1:05:42] for our sin not for ours only but for
[1:05:44] the sins of the whole world knowing that
[1:05:46] after you were initially redeemed you
[1:05:48] would have to be washed over and over
[1:05:50] again what is it that tells you and
[1:05:52] convinces you you need to be washed in
[1:05:53] the morning you mirror you get up in the
[1:05:59] mirror and y'all ever have that little
[1:06:00] stuff in the corner yeah
[1:06:02] what tears you give to Tamas what tells
[1:06:08] you you need to wash your face your call
[1:06:09] your brush your hair spray your
[1:06:12] toothpaste
[1:06:13] tell me answer me what is it that tells
[1:06:16] you you need to wash your face you're a
[1:06:18] mirror and then the mirror keeps
[1:06:21] revealing itself so you wash your face
[1:06:24] and you did where you can see you and
[1:06:26] you're able to watch them oh man I know
[1:06:28] a place on my face oh I got a piece of
[1:06:29] dead skin there and the what it the
[1:06:31] further you look the more you inspect
[1:06:34] the more you find home I've got a
[1:06:36] wrinkle over here ah there's a new word
[1:06:37] there's the new blemish oh my those this
[1:06:39] that the other what does it do it's
[1:06:40] revealing can't you see why it is so
[1:06:43] important for us to look in the reveal
[1:06:45] word of this our reflecting the mirror
[1:06:48] of today we can't spend all of her life
[1:06:50] looking in the mirror of 1965 well you
[1:06:53] mean if you was not even born we've got
[1:06:55] to look right now what's God got all
[1:06:57] these smiling in the mirror for this day
[1:07:01] [Applause]
[1:07:12] watch what nathan does to david we
[1:07:15] looked at david and bathsheba last night
[1:07:18] david goes on for many months does not
[1:07:21] confess his sin make it right before god
[1:07:24] but the prophet comes in and you know
[1:07:28] the story well the prophet gives in the
[1:07:29] parable of the man traveler came through
[1:07:33] brother brandon tells us that travel was
[1:07:35] his passions that traveler came through
[1:07:38] and he took a man's lamb and killed it
[1:07:41] now what is the prophet doing he's
[1:07:44] opening up the word david look into this
[1:07:49] man i want your judgment tell me what
[1:07:52] should happen that man should recompense
[1:07:55] them sheep and that man shall die then
[1:08:00] Nathan says you are the man he
[1:08:06] pronounced judgment on himself now if he
[1:08:13] would have laid it out and said David
[1:08:14] you don't so-and-so oh no he didn't go
[1:08:16] that way but he went around about it in
[1:08:18] another way calling upon the righteous
[1:08:21] part of David to give true justice and
[1:08:23] judgment and then you imagine when David
[1:08:27] looks he says oh I've condemned myself
[1:08:33] by my own judgment but David not only
[1:08:41] looked in the mirror to find his faults
[1:08:43] but he peered the second time and the
[1:08:48] Prophet said after David repented ye
[1:08:52] shall not surely die Wow
[1:08:57] the second look into the mirror they
[1:09:00] didn't bring judgment about restoration
[1:09:04] to God what if he would have looked I
[1:09:07] had to sir that I kill me Nisa kill me
[1:09:09] later no no God and more for him to go
[1:09:11] aren't you glad we become so judgmental
[1:09:14] and so hard about other people if we
[1:09:16] only realize the same judgment we meet
[1:09:18] out will be given to us how many times
[1:09:21] have we judged people wrong and judge
[1:09:22] them harshly and if it was not for the
[1:09:24] grace of God would everyone be in a mess
[1:09:26] of trouble today but thank God for the
[1:09:29] mirror that does not leave us in a
[1:09:31] judgemental state but it'll lead us back
[1:09:33] to restoration as well you imagine that
[1:09:44] prophet is he holds that mirror now what
[1:09:46] do you say oh god I'm so sorry forgive
[1:09:49] me Lord
[1:10:03] so Nathan not only use the mirror to
[1:10:06] show in this false when you use the
[1:10:09] mirror to restore him if you've lost
[1:10:13] your joy today let me tell you God don't
[1:10:15] want you to keep it lost let me open the
[1:10:17] mirror of the word and show you what she
[1:10:19] used to be you can be that way again you
[1:10:21] used to have peace in your heart you
[1:10:23] look at yourself today and you think oh
[1:10:24] my I used to be so happy I you say well
[1:10:27] let's not stay there let's not look at
[1:10:28] that old photo a photograph of what you
[1:10:30] watched 30 years ago but let me take the
[1:10:32] mirror the word and show you you can be
[1:10:33] a restored child of God you can be a
[1:10:36] restored daughter of God ask yourself
[1:10:38] the question do many of you have the
[1:10:39] same joy the same burning zeal that you
[1:10:42] had for God that yet 10 years ago first
[1:10:44] you become all in the knotless and you
[1:10:46] don't enjoy going to church you don't
[1:10:48] enjoy our Lord you know what you need to
[1:10:49] know you need to look into the mirror
[1:10:51] you need to look at the mirror and first
[1:10:53] you've got to say God show me what's
[1:10:55] wrong with me
[1:10:56] [Applause]
[1:11:01] but many of us go to church and when the
[1:11:04] mirrors preached this is the way we did
[1:11:07] JimBob okay hey hey Kel Kel this is you
[1:11:15] Sarah
[1:11:18] Bert what about you
[1:11:22] oh no no I don't have to look at them on
[1:11:24] the back side of this Searcy black we
[1:11:29] use our pitchfork and talk Sisson over
[1:11:30] here yesterday
[1:11:31] I can't believe so-and-so wasn't in
[1:11:35] church today that sermon would have been
[1:11:37] straight for they I'm a fan of in there
[1:11:42] so instead of taking the mirror looking
[1:11:45] at herself and saying Lord God Who am I
[1:11:51] the older I get the more I look like my
[1:11:54] daddy so I look at a picture of him and
[1:12:00] I look at me what can I do about it

[1:13:22] why don't we resent them when we come to
[1:13:25] church when the mirrors constable force
[1:13:28] when you do this in your life
[1:13:30] absolutely every day numerous times
[1:13:33] during the day now depending on what you
[1:13:36] want to do or depend on how much time
[1:13:38] you spend in front of the mirror if
[1:13:39] you're gonna clean the house that day

[1:16:17] don't know they look strange to us
[1:16:19] can't you understand why they don't know
[1:16:21] they appear strange in the eyes of God
[1:16:23] their preachers ain't putting a mirror
[1:16:25] up and
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:29] we're looking in the mirror the word
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:48] daily house we're looking into the
[1:16:51] mirror the word Paul says this in second
[1:16:54] Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open
[1:16:59] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[1:17:05] of the Lord look at this word beholding
[1:17:10] beholding as a glass to show in a mirror
[1:17:12] to make to reflect to mirror to look at
[1:17:15] oneself in a mirror to behold oneself
[1:17:19] but we all with open face beholding as
[1:17:23] in a glass but notice what you see when
[1:17:26] you take God's mirror
[1:17:27] you don't see yourself normal but
[1:17:31] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:17:34] Lord the third face of the mirror is you
[1:17:41] change but you'll never live to face if
[1:17:46] you don't come to phase one and Phase
[1:17:48] two do you look at yourself and then
[1:17:50] your restore and your constant renewing
[1:17:52] your fellowship constantly wants for the
[1:17:54] water the word and the last glimpse into
[1:17:56] the mirror you look see the glorious
[1:18:06] Lord
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:15] Lord Jesus beholding as in a glass the
[1:18:19] glory of the Lord and our changed the
[1:18:25] third pole of the mirror is to usher in
[1:18:29] the change look at this word changed
[1:18:34] Metamorpho transfigure transform to
[1:18:39] change into another form so naturally
[1:18:46] what did you do and you'll get put in
[1:18:47] the morning you find this on your face
[1:18:48] and that on your face and your hand it
[1:18:50] is what do you do about what you see in
[1:18:52] the mirror you change it to what you
[1:18:55] want it to be a man children don't get
[1:18:59] weary of looking in the mirror don't get
[1:19:01] we're hearing your thoughts preached on
[1:19:03] but know this the last glimpse in the
[1:19:07] mirror bring your change
[1:19:12] this word changed is the same word that
[1:19:15] would get metamorphosis from you
[1:19:18] remember by the mm or black brother fly
[1:19:26] black butterfly by the jewel of horny
[1:19:33] you're in this cocoon and you're all
[1:19:35] wrapped up in mortality and humanity but
[1:19:38] you're gonna come out a beautiful
[1:19:40] butterfly one day but how you gonna do
[1:19:43] it you've got to do it to the mirror you
[1:19:45] can't behold my denomination
[1:19:47] I'll look into brother man's face that
[1:19:48] ain't enough I'll look in the pause face
[1:19:50] has so what we're supposed to look at
[1:19:52] we're supposed to look into the mirror
[1:19:53] of the Lord and we'll look and we'll
[1:19:56] look until the image in that mirror has
[1:19:59] actually changed into the glory of the
[1:20:01] Lord or Jesus into the chain notice has
[1:20:12] changed into the same image from glory
[1:20:15] to glory even as by the Spirit of the
[1:20:18] Lord so in the third phase of the mirror
[1:20:23] and the son or daughter of God looks
[1:20:26] into the mirror to see the last stage
[1:20:28] and they look
[1:20:35] and when you rub your cheek Jesus rep
[1:20:37] sees it's him you remember the little
[1:20:49] boy that was raised out in the country
[1:20:51] I'd had never seen a mirror mount he
[1:20:55] married that he ever had no nerve was
[1:20:57] his daddy had a piece of a mirror
[1:21:00] tacked on a tree did he shave back but
[1:21:04] the little boy wasn't big enough to get
[1:21:07] up to see himself so I went to his
[1:21:11] auntie's house in the city and she had a
[1:21:16] full-length message mirror
[1:21:18] I mean full-length mirror on the door
[1:21:24] glory that's what we want any sisters we
[1:21:28] want a full-length mirror so to show us
[1:21:31] to progress and ungodly thus if you've
[1:21:34] only got a mirror that shows from here
[1:21:35] up you might look holy until that mirror
[1:21:37] would shine down this way and they said
[1:21:39] whoa aah some bad Roma I don't know
[1:21:42] about you I want a full-length mirror
[1:21:45] praise the Lord
[1:21:47] I don't want God to give me a mirror
[1:21:49] just in the head my eyes I'm bill Jim I
[1:21:51] want a full length mirror that'll show
[1:21:53] me my faults and my shortcomings there
[1:21:56] hey man and then I want a mirror that
[1:21:58] I'll be able to leave me back in the
[1:21:59] presence of God and then I want to take
[1:22:02] my last you into that mirror and I will
[1:22:04] eat myself out of this body into a new
[1:22:07] body glory to God how I looking
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:17] the little boys looking around the house
[1:22:20] and all of a sudden he walks about the
[1:22:22] door he waved his little boy waved a
[1:22:36] little bit closer little boy right back
[1:22:39] never remember he'd never seen himself
[1:22:43] before I pray the Almighty God will lay
[1:22:50] such a mere open before us today that
[1:22:53] we'll be able to see ourselves never his
[1:22:58] mommy and his aunty watching him and the
[1:23:01] little boy realizes he turns her head
[1:23:03] says mommy close what do you see
[1:23:20] would you rather I'd have a photograph
[1:23:22] of you 10 years ago showing you what a
[1:23:26] great Christian you are how much joy you
[1:23:28] had or are you very proud by God's grace
[1:23:32] of what you see presently do you love
[1:23:36] him more today than you've ever left him
[1:23:38] in your life or would you rather I'd
[1:23:40] have a picture of you up here when I 10
[1:23:42] years ago I prayed more I read more I
[1:23:44] went to church more often now I gotta
[1:23:45] admit I was a better person I already
[1:23:47] was huh I didn't I didn't have as much
[1:23:49] money as much goods but as a better
[1:23:50] person you'd be better off to be poor
[1:23:54] you want a picture of yourself but can
[1:23:58] you look at your real joy would you
[1:24:00] really hard today look in that mirror
[1:24:03] yes you did before you come in my hair
[1:24:11] sticking up side of my head Oh God God
[1:24:17] ain't got no spiritual makeup to hide
[1:24:18] your blemishes you won't step again
[1:24:21] forever but don't set to the rest of the
[1:24:24] day now and mourn and cry and feel sorry
[1:24:27] for yourself
[1:24:28] you let the devil beat you down but let
[1:24:31] me as your pastor take this mirror and
[1:24:34] lead you to restoration let me as long
[1:24:40] as God will give me Grace and strength
[1:24:41] and if i dying off he'll send another
[1:24:44] man that will take on follow that
[1:24:47] Ministry of the word
[1:24:48] until one day you'll take your last
[1:24:50] glimpse and you'll look and you see
[1:24:59] I've been changed spirits
[1:25:16] merciful God there's no one looking
[1:25:22] around please I just want you to be real
[1:25:24] sincere now before the Lord each of us
[1:25:29] beginning was being let us just take the
[1:25:33] mirror of his word hold it up in front
[1:25:37] of us and you don't need to tell me or
[1:25:40] necessary the person beside you the
[1:25:43] person you need to be honest with is
[1:25:45] yourself
[1:25:46] what do you see do you see a harsh
[1:25:50] judgmental person you see a person
[1:25:53] that's like Jesus they're just so much
[1:25:56] like Jesus people have a hard time
[1:25:57] differentiating you from Jesus because
[1:25:59] you're so much lacking or do you see a
[1:26:04] person that's falling short of many of
[1:26:07] these things and then do you see a
[1:26:11] person that doesn't want to stay there
[1:26:14] but they want to be restored and
[1:26:17] ultimately changed I'm certainly not at
[1:26:21] that place yet friends of second
[1:26:22] Corinthians tour I can look in the
[1:26:25] mirror and see the image of Jesus but
[1:26:27] what I'm seeing is the images being
[1:26:31] changed from glory to glory to glory you
[1:26:35] see for many folks in the message it's a
[1:26:37] very confusing time right now great
[1:26:39] signs wonders miracles we see caught
[1:26:41] moving among us we see healings and all
[1:26:42] that but it's not like it was in the
[1:26:44] days in the 50s and 60s and people are
[1:26:47] trying to figure out all my we need this
[1:26:48] we need this your financial no we need a
[1:26:50] looking glass a looking glass the
[1:26:54] supernatural leads us to view the image
[1:26:57] what do you see what do you see when you
[1:27:01] look keep looking deep enough and your
[1:27:05] fans are Genesis
[1:27:07] but Genesis is not the only book in the
[1:27:10] Bible I want to see my revelation I see
[1:27:15] my Genesis I know it I know what
[1:27:18] shortcomings is failures but I also know
[1:27:21] my apocalypsis my revelation my end John
[1:27:27] saw me coming with him coming out of
[1:27:30] heaven on a white horse
[1:27:32] praise God so I've got to keep looking
[1:27:36] service after service the day after day

[1:29:26] picture of what there were but they're

[1:29:32] look at the mirror and be honest
[1:29:33] am I really what I'm thinking I am am I
[1:29:38] just hearing the word and deceiving
[1:29:39] myself by not doing it where they look
[1:29:43] Lord and then may they not stay if they
[1:29:46] find faults and failures
[1:29:48] may they not stay there glassy out as it
[1:29:51] was peering into that image because it
[1:29:54] can become heartbreaking but may they
