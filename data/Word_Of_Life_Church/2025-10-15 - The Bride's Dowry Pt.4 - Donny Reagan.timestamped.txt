[23:01] Standing on holy ground. F.
[23:06] Yeah, they're coming. Let's sing this
[23:08] real quick as they're coming.
[23:11] Brother Donniey's talking about angels
[23:13] being with us. And I just couldn't help
[23:15] but think of this song. I was driving
[23:17] home the other night and
[23:20] we are standing
[23:27] on holy
[23:30] ground.
[23:36] And I know
[23:38] that there
[23:40] are angels
[23:44] all around.
[23:50] Let us praise
[23:57] Jesus
[23:59] now.
[24:05] We are standing
[24:08] in his presence on
[24:14] earth.
[24:17] [Music]
[24:19] We are standing
[24:24] [Music]
[24:26] on holy
[24:28] ground.
[24:29] [Applause]
[24:34] And I know
[24:37] that there
[24:39] are angels.
[24:47] [Music]
[24:50] [Applause]
[24:52] Jesus
[24:54] praise
[24:55] Jesus.
[24:57] Now
[24:59] [Applause]
[25:02] we are standing
[25:06] in his presence on holy
[25:12] ground.
[25:16] God bless you. Let's give our singers a
[25:18] good hand.
[25:44] [Music]
[25:58] I could never praise him enough
[26:02] for the cross of Calvary.
[26:06] I could never thank him enough
[26:10] for salvation full and free. I could
[26:14] never do anything
[26:17] to deserve such perfect love.
[26:22] Oh, for everything he's done, I could
[26:25] never praise him enough.
[26:32] For many years, I've served the Lord the
[26:36] best that I know how.
[26:39] giving unto him my time telling of his
[26:45] power.
[26:47] But if I were to spend unending hours on
[26:53] my knees
[26:55] praising him for everything he's ever
[26:59] done for me, I could never praise him
[27:04] enough
[27:06] for the cross of Calvary.
[27:09] I could never thank him enough
[27:13] for salvation full and free. I could
[27:17] never do anything
[27:21] to deserve such perfect love.
[27:25] Oh, for everything he's done. I could
[27:29] never praise him enough.
[27:35] A thousand tongues could never tell just
[27:39] what the Lord has done.
[27:42] As if he hadn't done enough, he sent his
[27:47] only son
[27:50] to hang upon a rugged cross and bear the
[27:55] load of sin.
[27:57] And that explains why I can't express
[28:01] the love I have for him. I could never
[28:06] praise him enough
[28:09] for the cross of Calvary.
[28:12] I could never thank him enough
[28:16] for salvation full and free. I can never
[28:21] do anything
[28:24] to deserve such perfect love.
[28:28] Oh, for everything he's done. Oh, for
[28:32] everything he's done. Oh, for everything
[28:37] he's done. I could never praise
[28:46] him enough.
[28:52] [Music]
[28:53] [Applause]
[29:38] I know you hear me sing way too much and
[29:41] I try to stay out of the specials, but
[29:42] every once in a while, Brother Louie
[29:45] can't get anybody, so he drafts me. But
[29:48] I've never sung this song, although I
[29:51] just looked it up while ago. It was
[29:53] written about the time I give my heart
[29:54] to the Lord. And I give my heart to the
[29:55] Lord in 1977. And ever since that,
[30:01] I've wanted one thing, and that's to go
[30:03] home. I know we've lost a lot of loved
[30:06] ones, and I'm sure
[30:08] all of us want to go home from time to
[30:10] time, but I believe the bride is just
[30:13] wanting to go home.
[30:16] [Applause]
[30:17] [Music]
[30:25] They say that heaven's pretty
[30:31] and living here is too.
[30:36] But if they said that I would have to
[30:42] choose between the two,
[30:46] I'd go home.
[30:48] [Music]
[30:51] I'd go home
[30:56] where I belong.
[31:02] [Music]
[31:08] Sometimes when I'm dreaming,
[31:13] it comes as no surprise
[31:18] that if you'd look, you'd see a homesick
[31:24] feeling in my eyes.
[31:28] I'm headed home.
[31:33] I'm going
[31:35] home
[31:38] where I belong.
[31:41] [Music]
[31:44] [Applause]
[31:44] [Music]
[31:48] [Applause]
[31:50] And while I'm here, I'll serve him
[31:54] gladly and sing him all these songs.
[32:01] I'm here
[32:03] [Music]
[32:05] but not for long.
[32:12] When I'm feeling lonely
[32:17] and when I'm feeling blue,
[32:22] it's such a joy to know that I am only
[32:29] passing through.
[32:32] I'm headed home.
[32:37] I'm going
[32:39] home.
[32:42] where I
[32:44] belong.
[32:46] [Music]
[32:48] [Applause]
[32:48] [Music]
[32:55] One day I'll be sleeping
[33:00] when death knocks on my door.
[33:06] And I'll awake to find
[33:11] I'm not homesick
[33:14] anymore.
[33:16] I'll be home.
[33:21] I'll be home
[33:27] where I
[33:29] belong.
[33:31] [Music]
[33:33] [Applause]
[33:38] where I
[33:41] belong.
[33:44] [Music]
[33:49] [Applause]
[33:49] [Music]
[33:57] Thank you.
[34:01] I trust that's
[34:03] our greatest desire tonight.
[34:07] Yes, sir.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; I'm just glad we've got a home to go to.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; You realize there's our population here
[34:14] in Johnson City is increasing more and
[34:16] more. You see that if you get out early
[34:20] of a morning, 7 7:30, and you're going
[34:22] or coming east or west. Traffic
[34:25] everywhere. with that more homeless
[34:28] people. I'm sure you've seen that as
[34:31] well. But what's even worse than people
[34:34] that don't have a mobile home to live in
[34:36] or a house, an apartment, a condo are
[34:41] those that are spiritually homeless.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; They have no place that they can really
[34:48] identify with Jesus.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad we've got a home. Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; And we're not just going to a home. We
[34:58] already have one. And he's took up his
[35:01] home inside of us.

[35:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Trust everybody's well.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Doing good. Fighting the devil.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Winning.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Winning. Praise the Lord. All right.
[35:17] Good. Genesis 24:58. to speak again
[35:20] tonight by the help of the Lord on the
[35:23] bride's
[35:24] dowy.
[35:26] I'm afraid that I've broke into a
[35:30] a u quite an extensive
[35:35] little bit of information here about the
[35:37] dowy. I'm not sure there'll ever be an
[35:40] end to it
[35:43] with all that our Lord has provided for
[35:45] us.
[35:47] He knew we needed it, didn't he?
[35:50] &gt;&gt; He knew we needed it.
[35:52] And they called Rebecca and said unto
[35:54] her, "Well, thou go with this man." And
[35:57] she said, "I will go."
[36:00] And they sent away Rebecca, their
[36:03] sister, and her nurse,
[36:06] and Abraham's servant, and his men.
[36:10] And they blessed Rebecca
[36:14] and said unto her, "Thou art our sister.
[36:18] Be thou the mother of thousands of
[36:20] millions, and let thy seed possess the
[36:24] gate of those which hate them."
[36:28] And Rebecca rose and her damsels,
[36:31] and they rode upon the camels, and
[36:33] followed the man. And the servant took
[36:36] Rebecca and went his way. I love the way
[36:40] Moses writes this and the way that he
[36:43] divides it as it goes. So, Rebecca
[36:47] arose. Notice she takes precedent and
[36:51] Rebecca arose and her damsels inclusive
[36:55] with her. And they rode upon the camels
[36:59] and followed the man. So, the damsels
[37:02] were following the man too,
[37:06] &gt;&gt; but they were not bride.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[37:09] They probably heard some of the same
[37:11] stories,
[37:12] &gt;&gt; some of the same teaching that Rebecca
[37:15] heard, but they were not called to be
[37:18] bride.
[37:20] But were they better off?
[37:22] I think they were.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; They were better off being with her.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Even though they may not be bride, they
[37:30] were better off being with her. And the
[37:32] servant took Rebecca. Notice how Moses
[37:35] goes back. Now doesn't mention about the
[37:38] foolish virgins. I I I mean the
[37:40] handmaidadens.
[37:42] The servant took Rebecca and went his
[37:47] way. How many like to be remembered
[37:50] tonight as we pray? So many needs among
[37:53] us. Those that are sick and afflicted
[37:55] and going through different trials and
[37:57] things like that. So let's let's just
[37:59] pray for the church body as well.
[38:03] Heavenly Father, we love you so much.
[38:08] You've been so good to us, Jesus.
[38:12] I'm sure I could give you a million
[38:14] reasons or more why you shouldn't love
[38:17] me.
[38:18] And a million reasons or more as to why
[38:22] you shouldn't love most of these people
[38:23] that are here tonight.
[38:26] But if I would give you a million and
[38:28] they would give you a million and
[38:30] everyone else a million,
[38:32] no doubt you would give us millions more
[38:35] back. Why you do love us and we're
[38:39] grateful that your answer
[38:42] overpowers ours.
[38:45] And as we see with Rebecca here that her
[38:49] destiny has come into view, a little
[38:53] simple lady that probably thought she'd
[38:56] marry a merchant or uh a man that would
[39:00] sell livestock,
[39:02] never amount to much of anything.
[39:05] But little did she know when that
[39:07] messenger showed up that day, her life
[39:10] would never be the same.
[39:14] From thinking she might marry a man and
[39:16] have two or three kids,
[39:18] her destiny was to be the mother of
[39:21] thousands of millions.
[39:24] Who would have ever thought it?
[39:27] But we know it is part of the father's
[39:30] drama
[39:32] that the father picks the actors, the
[39:36] characters,
[39:37] and he writes their parts.
[39:40] If he can just get them into the spirit
[39:44] of the drama,
[39:46] and they will quit trying to take this
[39:48] one's place or that one's place, and
[39:51] just find their part and be what the
[39:54] father made them to be.
[39:57] Truly, Lord, that's our desire tonight.
[40:00] We pray that you'd speak to us by your
[40:02] word. You see the needs of all the hands
[40:04] that was uplifted, those Lord God that
[40:07] are sick tonight, can't be in church,
[40:09] those that have various needs. We pray
[40:11] that you'd be mindful of them.
[40:14] Help me to get out of the way. Father,
[40:17] speak to us the very counsel of the
[40:20] Almighty God. In the name of Jesus
[40:23] Christ, we pray Lord that you'd be
[40:26] mindful of the camp starting tomorrow
[40:28] night. Father, you see the minister
[40:31] brothers that'll be there doing the
[40:32] speaking. We pray, Father, that you'd
[40:35] just be with the young folks as they'll
[40:38] be coming in tomorrow and the next day.
[40:40] And Lord, we're just looking for a great
[40:43] time in your presence. Change lives,
[40:46] fill with the Holy Ghost, do some great
[40:49] things, Lord. In Jesus name we pray.
[40:52] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[41:00] So the dowry is given to the bride
[41:04] by her father
[41:07] to equip her for her new life.
[41:12] And part of it will be her inheritance
[41:16] which will carry over beyond the journey
[41:21] as it was with Rebecca.
[41:24] And part of it would have been
[41:27] designated for the journey in time
[41:31] and then part of it will go on into
[41:34] eternity.
[41:36] Imagine that when Paul began to get this
[41:40] understanding
[41:42] that God had opened up to him, we don't
[41:45] know exactly how long he had it before
[41:48] he started writing it in the book of
[41:51] Ephesians. And we know that Paul, as
[41:54] with other prophets, as with the church
[41:56] in the New Testament as well, that they
[41:59] grew in understanding. We can see from
[42:03] the very beginning that Paul was
[42:06] illuminated above his brothers and God
[42:10] gave him an understanding, an allocation
[42:13] of the mysteries of God that no other
[42:16] had in that age. And we know that God
[42:19] trusted him with that. And yet I imagine
[42:23] sometimes it must have been quite
[42:25] overwhelming as he went to Arabia first
[42:29] and spent that time alone with God and
[42:32] then didn't meet Peter and them again
[42:34] for about 15 years or so. And he found
[42:38] himself preaching some of the same
[42:41] things they were preaching. But I want
[42:44] you to listen to that carefully now. He
[42:46] was preaching some of the same things
[42:48] they were preaching. But they couldn't
[42:50] say that. They couldn't say they were
[42:54] preaching some of the same things Paul
[42:57] was preaching because God gave things to
[43:00] Paul that Peter never preached. God gave
[43:04] things to Paul that Andrew, Bartholomew,
[43:07] Matthew, Mark, many of those brothers,
[43:10] they did not get directly from God. Now
[43:13] you remember when brother Random went
[43:14] beyond the curtain of time and he said
[43:16] he preached what Paul preached and those
[43:18] voices echoed back that we are resting
[43:22] on that and brother Brandham preached
[43:25] what Paul preached but there was things
[43:28] that brother Brandham preached that Paul
[43:32] didn't preach
[43:34] &gt;&gt; because Paul didn't need to. Now listen
[43:36] carefully. The church ages did not need
[43:40] to be preached in the first church age.
[43:43] The seven thunders did not need to be
[43:46] uttered when John heard them on the
[43:48] aisle of Patmas. So Paul never preached
[43:52] all that brother Brandham preached. Come
[43:54] on now. Don't get quiet on me already.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Why? It wasn't time. Now do you
[43:59] understand the Lord Jesus never preached
[44:03] all that Paul preached.
[44:06] Why? It wasn't time.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; It was not time for it to be said. Now,
[44:11] it wasn't that he didn't know it and
[44:13] that he didn't have the understanding.
[44:15] He did. Well, come on now. I'm going to
[44:17] go a little farther. Men of God in the
[44:20] message of this age are preaching things
[44:23] now that men who were around brother
[44:26] Brandham in the 60s, 70s, and even some
[44:29] in the 80s that they never preached then
[44:32] either.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; You know why? because many of them did
[44:35] not have the message on the laptop or a
[44:38] computer where they could get in there
[44:40] and compare the statements. Wonder why
[44:43] it wasn't necessarily needed for that
[44:46] time. God knew how long we were going to
[44:50] be here. And God allowed, I believe with
[44:53] all of my heart, even though I come off
[44:54] the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
[44:56] God allowed the message to be put in an
[44:59] infabase to be studied. So men of God
[45:03] around the world would be able to find
[45:05] things that's in the message that laid
[45:08] there for years and years that message
[45:10] preachers never even knew that they were
[45:13] there. So can you imagine my preaching
[45:16] all the rest of these preacher brothers
[45:17] around the world if we were still having
[45:19] to listen to tapes individual tapes or
[45:22] read individual books and try to write
[45:24] it down and then make little notes and
[45:26] compare here and there and there. So if
[45:29] I want to do a study like I have today
[45:32] and I want to type in several different
[45:34] words. So if I want to search angels as
[45:37] I did today, angels of God, if I want to
[45:40] search angels in whatever format and I
[45:42] pull up 585
[45:44] and I'd be able to sit there and go from
[45:46] one to the other to the other to the
[45:48] other to the other to the other just
[45:50] like that as fast as I can read. You
[45:52] imagine what that would be if I would
[45:54] try to pick up my Bible and go from one
[45:57] chapter to another to another to another
[45:59] of trying to search it. Oh my goodness.
[46:02] I would never get done, would I? I would
[46:04] constantly be looking. But God has
[46:07] allowed the speed of the message being
[46:10] searched, the Bible being searched to
[46:13] match the speed of the revelation that
[46:17] is needed for this end time. What is it
[46:20] all doing? speeding up for a body
[46:23] change.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; They didn't need to be sped up in the
[46:27] days of Luther or in the days of Wesley.
[46:29] They moved along in the horse and buggy
[46:31] days. But you know what? We need it,
[46:33] brother Joe. And I thank God for it
[46:36] myself. So whenever it was there, we can
[46:39] see how that that it unveiled in Paul.
[46:42] And I'm going to read again if you don't
[46:44] mind that Paul again in Ephesians 3:8
[46:48] when he said unto me who am least than
[46:51] the le less than the least of all saints
[46:55] is this grace given that I should preach
[46:59] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[47:02] riches of Christ and to make all men see
[47:07] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[47:10] which from the beginning of the world
[47:14] has been hid in God who created all
[47:18] things by Jesus Christ. Now remember, no
[47:22] one else in the New Testament uses these
[47:26] terms and writes this way. And to the
[47:29] intent that now unto the principalities
[47:33] and powers in heavenly places. So
[47:36] principalities
[47:38] which was the first ones in the order of
[47:41] creation the preeminent ones ara
[47:44] principalities
[47:45] and powers in heavenly places might be
[47:50] known by the church. Now angels of God
[47:56] are not all knowing. They are not all
[47:59] knowing. They are not omnipotent. And
[48:03] there are many things that God has kept
[48:07] secret from the angels. The Lord Jesus
[48:11] says that the angels don't even know
[48:14] when he's coming. Is that right?
[48:17] &gt;&gt; They don't know that. They did not know
[48:21] until the mystery was broke at the dawn
[48:25] in between the Old and the New Testament
[48:28] when he was coming to the earth the
[48:31] first time. So unto the principalities
[48:34] and powers to the angelic host, these
[48:39] super intelligent beings, if we can say
[48:41] it that way, that surround the throne of
[48:44] God, yet many things are kept from them.
[48:49] So this is part of the father's drama. I
[48:53] don't know if you remembered or not, but
[48:54] I preached a sermon to you many, many
[48:56] years ago and entitled it the father's
[49:00] drama. Let me just set a little bit of a
[49:02] foundation for you. And I want you to
[49:04] notice what I'm going to read from
[49:06] tonight. This very first quote. The
[49:08] deity of Jesus Christ, December the
[49:11] 25th, Christmas Day, the year 1949.
[49:17] But look friends, the hour has come and
[49:22] is now that when God's great drama
[49:28] set here before us, now watch. God's
[49:32] great drama set here before us. The son
[49:37] of God that was in the cradle is in the
[49:41] heart now. He's the deity of God. But
[49:45] that is the God, the creator living in
[49:49] you, giving you all the power. And
[49:54] you're in possession of anything that he
[49:58] had. So
[50:01] is it in you to abstain from evil, to do
[50:06] good, to shun evil and flee to
[50:10] righteousness, to turn away from
[50:14] temptation? Now this is the kind of
[50:16] power I want to see made manifest in our
[50:19] church as well as healing the sick.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. All malice, hatred, strife, envy,
[50:27] and so forth, come away from it. for
[50:29] that'll take him from your heart if you
[50:33] will receive him, embrace him and love
[50:37] him and hold him in your heart. Now
[50:41] notice the prophet calls it a drama. So
[50:44] it is a drama that the father wrote in
[50:49] his mind before he brought angels into
[50:52] an angelic form or being. Now watch
[50:56] this. and shalom. He says, "So we have
[50:59] these times of symphonies of the
[51:03] symphony of God's word that the whole
[51:08] drama changes. Now now what he does is
[51:12] he brings the drama of God and he puts
[51:16] it to music. Now watch the symphony is
[51:21] now correlating together with the drama.
[51:25] Now, in the early days whenever they
[51:29] first come out with moving pictures, and
[51:31] many of you probably have seen them, if
[51:35] nothing else, just on an archive format,
[51:38] that the movies were silent. So, they
[51:41] would act out and they would do this and
[51:44] that and the other, but there was no
[51:46] voices. So, they would just act and jump
[51:48] around and this and that. And then they
[51:51] started putting music to it. And then
[51:53] they got to where they could actually
[51:56] synchronize the actions with the voice
[52:01] and then they paired it up to where it
[52:03] would be able to work. So it's like they
[52:05] were learning the visual first was audio
[52:09] and then visual but it was not together
[52:12] and then they learned to synchronize it
[52:14] together and then they would also put
[52:16] music in the background with it. Now
[52:19] watch the word as it's starting to do
[52:22] the same. You who are interested, listen
[52:25] for that change. You know it's getting
[52:27] close. You hear the way the drums are
[52:31] beating, want something to happen, and
[52:34] you know this is a change. See, it's
[52:36] going to break out into a burst in a few
[52:40] minutes and you're watching for it and
[52:43] you can tell the way the drums are
[52:47] timing. He said, "God, oh God, if you
[52:50] can hear the drums of the finish." Now,
[52:54] now watch how he's going, not only to
[52:57] the drama and the actors that are on the
[53:00] scene, but also the music, the symphony,
[53:05] and also the sympathy.
[53:10] Now, I know there's been some of the
[53:12] message people that thought that Brother
[53:15] Brandon actually made a mistake.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And I'll let you think it for a few
[53:22] minutes
[53:24] now. Watch. Oh, God. If you can hear the
[53:27] drums of the finish now. If you can hear
[53:29] the echo of the music of the heavenly
[53:33] word singing itself out.
[53:38] So the echo, notice why he says this. If
[53:41] you can hear the echo of the music of
[53:44] the heavenly word. Now what is it that
[53:46] causes an echo? Now let me explain sound
[53:50] to you a little bit. That sound does not
[53:53] travel as fast as the speed of light.
[53:57] Sound travels much slower. Barometric
[54:00] pressure affects sound. Humidity,
[54:03] relative humidity reflects sound.
[54:06] Several different things affect the
[54:09] soundwave. So in here by going straight
[54:12] to the PA system there and the way it
[54:14] works here, it's not so bad. But if you
[54:17] go into some of these other rooms that
[54:19] we have around and also onto the
[54:22] internet, I was down at brother Jason
[54:24] Watkins several years ago and I preached
[54:26] there and then I I I got done with the
[54:28] service and I went off the platform back
[54:31] into the room there and their internet
[54:33] room was right next to the office and I
[54:36] I just couldn't keep from laughing
[54:38] because I had done stopped preaching and
[54:41] I'd stood on the platform for a little
[54:42] bit and worship with the people and yet
[54:45] when I walked into the office. I heard
[54:47] myself still preaching over the
[54:50] internet. Now, what was happening? It
[54:53] was the delay from the time that it had
[54:56] come to however all that internet stuff
[54:58] works and where it got to where it was.
[55:00] And yet, I had already done. And I
[55:04] thought, what a great a great reflection
[55:07] of prophecy that that is that God can
[55:11] say things for thousands of years and
[55:13] it's already said and the actors come on
[55:16] the scene. But whenever you're setting
[55:18] up sound, so say in the nurseries or
[55:21] back in some of the remote parts of the
[55:23] building that we would actually be able
[55:26] to put it on a timer and be able to
[55:28] either speed up the frequency of how it
[55:31] works or delay it because if you don't,
[55:34] it will be an echo and I'll say it here
[55:37] and then say it there again, say it here
[55:39] and say it there again. But you can run
[55:41] it through a processor and speed it up
[55:44] and time that voice to where when I say
[55:48] it here, it will be exactly the same
[55:50] back there. Now you see God
[55:52] prophetically has his prophets to say it
[55:55] and it is an echo and they're echoing
[55:58] way back. It's coming. It's coming. And
[56:03] then the echo will say it's coming. It's
[56:06] coming. It's coming. But they're done
[56:10] saying something else by the time you
[56:11] hear it. But watch what God has been
[56:14] doing as he's dialing in the message of
[56:17] the hour with the season, with the time,
[56:21] with the drama, with the music. And the
[56:24] delay is getting shorter and shorter.
[56:28] And what God is waiting for is the
[56:30] events out here, plus us as his people,
[56:34] to all get exactly right. And then he'll
[56:37] make the last final tune and the echo
[56:40] will absolutely disappear.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Why? It's because the way you process
[56:46] the sound and you can be able to do it
[56:50] in such a way that it eliminates it now
[56:53] naturally because sound travels so slow.
[56:56] And you know how it is those of you that
[56:58] have stood out in places and you go
[57:00] through a tunnel and people in there and
[57:02] they what do they love to do? They love
[57:04] to honk their horns in a tunnel and they
[57:06] go through.
[57:09] You ever stood in the Swiss Alps and you
[57:11] stand up there
[57:14] and
[57:16] on and on and on it goes. What is it?
[57:19] It's because that sound does not travel
[57:22] as fast as light does. Now watch what
[57:25] God is doing prophetically. Now we said
[57:28] the echo of the music of the heavenly
[57:32] word. Isn't that an awesome quote? The
[57:34] echo of the music of the heavenly word
[57:38] singing itself out. And it shall come to
[57:41] pass in the last days. The sympathy,
[57:47] come on.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; The sympathy
[57:50] of God's great drama that he's playing,
[57:55] it changes him.
[58:01] The sympathy
[58:03] of God's great drama, it changes him.
[58:09] His sympathy
[58:11] at the junctions,
[58:13] the composer and those who are
[58:16] interested. Anybody interested tonight?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Those who are interested, listen for the
[58:25] change.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what we're listening for,
[58:30] friends. the change.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Now you see, we called it when we come
[58:34] to the message and we call it change
[58:37] again. The further our revelation begin
[58:39] to grow and advance in the word, the the
[58:42] music has changed us and we're coming
[58:46] closer and closer, but we're listening
[58:49] for the final change. Now watch. He says
[58:53] the composer and those who are
[58:55] interested listen for the change. That's
[58:57] what's all this stuff is to us. We're
[59:01] listening. We're watching. Now, notice.
[59:04] So, we're not just in the days of audio
[59:08] alone, but we're in the days of drama
[59:12] and audio being mixed together. We're
[59:16] not just in the days to where it's
[59:19] totally audio. And when as long as we
[59:22] are just hearing the tapes, as long as
[59:25] we're just listening to the message and
[59:28] not letting the message manifest itself
[59:31] out of our lives, then we are not yet
[59:34] synchronized to where the audio and the
[59:37] visual are becoming one.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't want to just talk
[59:42] about the message and quote the message.
[59:44] We want to become it.
[59:47] So we want the drama and the symphony to
[59:51] be together and then it will act out
[59:55] exactly what father wants in the drama.
[59:58] This is not just a musical. This is not
[1:00:02] just music alone. It is not audio alone.
[1:00:07] It is a drama. So in the drama there is
[1:00:11] audio but there is also visual. You see,
[1:00:15] we want to be Jesus, the living,
[1:00:19] resurrected Jesus living out of our
[1:00:22] lives. Who will be Jesus to this age?
[1:00:26] Who will be Jesus to Johnson City,
[1:00:29] Elizabeth, and all these places around
[1:00:31] us? Come on, somebody. Now, a lot of the
[1:00:33] message people, it shows that they've
[1:00:35] missed it. They've totally missed it
[1:00:39] because their focus is audio alone.
[1:00:44] That's why they focused the tapes, the
[1:00:46] tapes, the tapes, the tapes, the tapes,
[1:00:49] the tapes. Brother Bram's voice. Brother
[1:00:51] Bram's voice. Brother Bram's voice.
[1:00:53] Well, this is Brother Bram's voice
[1:00:55] saying it right here.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That there's got to be drama. And in the
[1:01:00] drama, there's more than one actor.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, every time, what
[1:01:08] she said, that's what all this stuff is
[1:01:10] to us. We're listening and we are
[1:01:13] watching. Now if it's audio alone, we
[1:01:15] don't need to watch for anything. We
[1:01:18] just listen and that's all we do. But if
[1:01:20] it's a drama, then we are listening, but
[1:01:24] we're also watching. Sometimes the
[1:01:26] introductory part to the drama, the
[1:01:29] visual will be led in by what? Audio.
[1:01:34] The audio. That's what I do almost every
[1:01:36] wedding you've ever seen me do. I am
[1:01:39] waiting most of the time for a
[1:01:41] particular song and we will come and
[1:01:44] practice and they will give me this
[1:01:46] list. Now, brother Donnie, when they
[1:01:48] play and they change the music to this,
[1:01:50] this is your cue and the brides and you
[1:01:53] know, all the groom guys, all them
[1:01:55] there, that's when you all come out. The
[1:01:57] change of the music will be your sign. I
[1:02:00] said, "Now, how do I know? How do I know
[1:02:01] when it is?" You know, I I ain't done
[1:02:03] this that much.
[1:02:06] So, I want to know. How do I know? I I
[1:02:08] don't want to mess it up. I don't. I
[1:02:10] want to be right. I I want to know my
[1:02:12] queue when to come out. When they change
[1:02:14] the music, then you will come out. So
[1:02:17] what leads me out? The audio leads out
[1:02:21] the visual.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; So what how horrible it would be if the
[1:02:26] audio plays and we sit back there in the
[1:02:29] room and we're back there talking and
[1:02:30] the bridegrooms passed out and then
[1:02:32] after he passed out, I passed out. Then
[1:02:34] all the groomsman passed out and all
[1:02:35] y'all sitting on here waiting for the
[1:02:37] visual. Well, just keep on playing the
[1:02:39] audio. Just keep on playing the same
[1:02:42] song. Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[1:02:43] It's going to be hard for that little
[1:02:44] girl to marry that song.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I ain't marrying no tape player. I
[1:02:50] ain't marrying no tapes. I'm marrying a
[1:02:52] person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:02:57] Now, watch how the prophet and his way
[1:03:00] lays this out. Every time he appears,
[1:03:03] something happens and we see the time
[1:03:07] getting close. Now, watch the word
[1:03:10] sympathy. Look at what this now. It's
[1:03:13] amazing because you know you'd think
[1:03:16] sympathy would be feeling sorry for
[1:03:18] something. Oh no. You see there's a
[1:03:20] musical term for sympathy. And it proves
[1:03:25] if you listen to when brother Rab says
[1:03:26] this several places he actually
[1:03:28] apologizes and said I I guess I'm using
[1:03:31] the wrong word. It shows that he didn't
[1:03:33] even humanly himself know that this was
[1:03:37] a musical term. So he actually
[1:03:40] apologizes for using the word. Well, it
[1:03:44] kind of makes you wonder who is doing
[1:03:45] the talking then sometimes, don't it?
[1:03:48] Kind of makes you wonder if it was not
[1:03:50] the great composer himself that actually
[1:03:53] used brother Random and it must have
[1:03:55] been a question within himself or maybe
[1:03:57] people were sitting there looking at him
[1:03:59] funny and he thought that he had used
[1:04:01] the wrong word. Come on.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Sympathy in music refers to a short
[1:04:09] often instrumental piece sometimes
[1:04:13] called a begatella.
[1:04:16] Oo, what a big fancy word that acts as a
[1:04:20] homage or a reculum for someone
[1:04:26] special.
[1:04:29] Oh, so the symphony now, what is that?
[1:04:33] That's a bunch of different people
[1:04:35] playing different instruments and
[1:04:37] they're all playing the same song, which
[1:04:39] is amazing to get them all on the same
[1:04:40] page at the same time playing the same
[1:04:42] song. But then the sympathy part is for
[1:04:47] someone special. So, it's a sp a special
[1:04:51] thing that's going on inside the drama.
[1:04:54] And the music is leading up to the
[1:04:58] introduction of someone special. Oh my.
[1:05:02] You mean sort of like our special
[1:05:05] bridegroom and the special bride that's
[1:05:08] going to be joined together. And we
[1:05:10] didn't just need the term symphony in
[1:05:12] this day, but we also needed the word
[1:05:16] sympathy.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at this. And three
[1:05:20] kinds of believer. And we are at the
[1:05:22] closing of the history of the world. The
[1:05:25] book is now being finished. The last
[1:05:27] line will be wrote across. It someday
[1:05:31] shall be closed up. Then time will be no
[1:05:35] more. There is a great drama being set
[1:05:39] and angels are standing over the skies
[1:05:43] watching. You know what a drama is? The
[1:05:47] actors are ready. You can see them
[1:05:51] acting. You can see the evil one acting.
[1:05:54] Now, the devil's got a part in this
[1:05:57] drama. Aren't you glad you didn't get
[1:05:59] his part?
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The devil has got a
[1:06:04] part. Now, God knew God knew that there
[1:06:07] must be evil displayed, but he could not
[1:06:10] make any of the angels do it. So, he
[1:06:12] placed and created this being on a basis
[1:06:15] to where he could choose. And in his
[1:06:18] soul that day on Calvary 1960, Satan
[1:06:22] sin. What was the origination of sin? It
[1:06:25] was in him. What happened? Did he smoke
[1:06:27] a cigarette? Nope. Didn't do any of that
[1:06:30] sort of thing first. But sin began in
[1:06:33] him when he said, "I will exalt my
[1:06:36] throne above the stars of God." Can't
[1:06:39] you see why God hates pride and
[1:06:41] arrogance so much? So notice then there
[1:06:44] there's a part of that. Now there's also
[1:06:47] then a part of demons which were part of
[1:06:50] the angelic host in the beginning but
[1:06:53] they were not elect. Now remember Paul
[1:06:56] calls a certain element of the angels of
[1:06:59] God elect angels but there are other
[1:07:02] angels which were not elect. They were
[1:07:06] given great authority and they still
[1:07:08] have that. They have the ability to
[1:07:11] appear disappear. They can do all kinds
[1:07:14] of great things. No doubt about it. But
[1:07:16] yet they were not elected. They are part
[1:07:19] of the drama on the negative side. There
[1:07:23] will be true prophets. There will be
[1:07:25] false prophets. There will be true
[1:07:27] pastors. There will be false pastors.
[1:07:29] There will be true churches. There will
[1:07:31] be false churches. It's part of the
[1:07:35] drama. Now watch. He goes on in three
[1:07:38] kinds of believers. But you can also see
[1:07:41] the rapture church. Now watch the drama.
[1:07:44] You can also see the rapture church
[1:07:47] making herself ready. It's a great
[1:07:51] scene.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; So the rapture church is making herself
[1:07:58] ready. Isn't that an unusual term? But
[1:08:01] you can see the rapture church making
[1:08:05] herself ready. Now, wouldn't that seem
[1:08:08] backwards to say it that way? You'd
[1:08:11] think that we'd say, "Well, she's making
[1:08:13] herself ready so she can go in the
[1:08:15] rapture." No, actually, she's got to be
[1:08:18] raptured first, translated into the
[1:08:21] kingdom of his dear son, so she can get
[1:08:24] ready.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way in the world any
[1:08:28] mortal can get ready on their own to be
[1:08:30] able to enter into the kingdom of God.
[1:08:32] He has to translate our soul before he
[1:08:36] translates our body. Woo! Praise God.
[1:08:40] It's a great scene. You can see the
[1:08:42] presence of God. Amen. Vindicating and
[1:08:47] making the great drama that's foretold
[1:08:50] here in this Bible to act itself out. To
[1:08:56] act itself out. Friends, every one of us
[1:08:59] in this building tonight, we have been
[1:09:01] given a part of the drama. Oh, what a
[1:09:04] great thing it would be if every person
[1:09:07] here under the sound of my voice and
[1:09:08] those who are are part of our church
[1:09:10] that are not here tonight. If every one
[1:09:12] of us would go to the great writer
[1:09:15] himself, who is also the one who
[1:09:17] composed the music, who is also the one
[1:09:21] that give all the life to this animation
[1:09:23] and made it real and would say, "Father,
[1:09:26] I believe you call me. I believe you
[1:09:29] love me. I believe you chose me. Help
[1:09:31] me, father, to find my part in the
[1:09:34] drama. If it's just a little bitty guy,
[1:09:38] you know, to maybe play a little roll on
[1:09:40] the drum every now and then. Or maybe
[1:09:42] I'll wait to the very end, right at the
[1:09:44] end time. And my little part is I take
[1:09:46] these little tiny symbols and when
[1:09:48] everybody's written just getting ready
[1:09:50] to come to a close, I go
[1:09:54] and that's all I do. I live 30 years of
[1:09:56] my life for you. I live 50 years of my
[1:09:58] life and I have one little part.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know that I'll ever forget it.
[1:10:06] As a little boy, I remember at my uncle
[1:10:08] Harold's church there, they was real big
[1:10:11] on Christmas plays and they did the
[1:10:14] Christmas play by Charles Dickens, A
[1:10:17] Christmas Carol.
[1:10:19] And I started acting early really.
[1:10:23] And my part in the play was I was Tiny
[1:10:27] Tim. You remember it, Harry? My
[1:10:29] goodness, it's been
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; how many decades ago has that been? So I
[1:10:33] was Tiny Tim and a man by the name of
[1:10:36] Dave Rednau. He was my daddy. Tiny Tim
[1:10:40] Cratchet his name, something like that.
[1:10:43] And I mean, I had to go to all the
[1:10:44] practice. I had to be there for
[1:10:46] everything. Then other people had to
[1:10:48] memorize lines and lines and more lines
[1:10:51] and more lines.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; I just had a few words to say at the
[1:10:58] very end. Y'all remember what Tiny Tim
[1:11:00] said? Okay. All right. And I But I had
[1:11:03] to be at all the practice. I had to go
[1:11:05] to every service.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I had to stand there and clap my hands
[1:11:11] even though I never got to sing a
[1:11:13] special. I had to, you know, to pray and
[1:11:16] read my Bible and go to church and be
[1:11:18] faithful and pay my tithes and nobody
[1:11:20] ever called me to sing a special song.
[1:11:22] I'm speaking to you now in a metaphor.
[1:11:24] You understand what I'm saying? I had to
[1:11:26] do all of that and be there and sweat
[1:11:28] like I don't know what, you know, just
[1:11:30] singing, "Oh, I hope they don't mess up.
[1:11:31] I hope they don't mess up." And then my
[1:11:33] little line right at the very end and
[1:11:35] Dave Red and I are standing up there
[1:11:36] holding me in his arms and everybody did
[1:11:39] their part. my the hours they put into
[1:11:41] that and then it come my little time and
[1:11:44] you know what my face flushed red
[1:11:46] probably is right now I can feel it all
[1:11:48] over me right now I I I was so scared to
[1:11:50] death and I thought donnie you've only
[1:11:52] got one little line you've only got a
[1:11:55] few few words and may God bless us all
[1:11:58] may God bless us all you thought I was
[1:12:01] the main actor no I was not the main
[1:12:05] actor
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; but I was the last one speaking Oh my
[1:12:10] god, children. Think of it. God raised
[1:12:12] up Paul and Luther and Wesley and
[1:12:15] Pentecost and they've done so much for
[1:12:18] the kingdom of God. It's not that we're
[1:12:20] trying to outdo them. We're not trying
[1:12:22] to outdo anybody else. We just want to
[1:12:25] find our part. If I ain't got nothing to
[1:12:28] say, but right at the end, let me say
[1:12:30] it. Well, young people, you've got
[1:12:33] something to do in this drama. It ain't
[1:12:36] just for the old people. It ain't just
[1:12:38] for the preacher. Every one of you are
[1:12:40] called by God. You're chosen by God.
[1:12:43] You're ordained by God to take your part
[1:12:46] in the Father's drama. Oh, come every
[1:12:49] service. Pray, read your Bible, be
[1:12:52] faithful if you ain't got nothing to say
[1:12:54] but
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:02] Amen.
[1:13:04] Amen.
[1:13:06] Well, some of you couldn't explain the
[1:13:08] seven seals to me to save your life. You
[1:13:10] couldn't tell me the dates of the church
[1:13:12] ages. You couldn't tell me the
[1:13:14] messenger. You couldn't tell me this and
[1:13:16] that and the other. But some of your
[1:13:18] part, you know what it'll be? Amen,
[1:13:21] Lord.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; I believe it, God.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Is that important to
[1:13:28] God?" Ask Hattie Wright when you see
[1:13:30] her. That ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:13:34] That was Hattie Wright's part, Harry. Oh
[1:13:36] my. She didn't have to study like
[1:13:38] brother Benham. She didn't have to have
[1:13:40] the visions like brother Benham did. But
[1:13:42] when it come time and the father's drama
[1:13:45] opened up and had his little house,
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; glory to God, had was pulsated by the
[1:13:52] same spirit of God that pulsated our
[1:13:55] prophet.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You imagine the angels of God standing
[1:13:58] in the room waiting for Addie.
[1:14:03] What are you going to say?
[1:14:06] Brother Bren,
[1:14:08] that ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Now, you imagine the rich and the famous
[1:14:15] people that come to Brother Brenham. The
[1:14:17] rich woman that he talked about, where
[1:14:19] was it down in Florida had enough rings
[1:14:21] on her hand and said, "Send missionaries
[1:14:22] around the world seven times or
[1:14:24] something like that." You know, had her
[1:14:26] hand all propped up there. He said, "Put
[1:14:27] it down here." Said big old fat looking
[1:14:29] hand. said, "Pull it down here."
[1:14:33] Should come down like this. I guess
[1:14:34] wanting him to kiss it. Elijah kissing
[1:14:36] hands. He might bite your finger off him
[1:14:38] maybe, but he sure going to bow to no
[1:14:40] dower or no countest or nothing like
[1:14:42] that. I'll tell you one thing. I'd
[1:14:45] rather have my part in the drive of God
[1:14:47] to be the most important person in the
[1:14:50] world. If you was the richest person in
[1:14:52] the world, it'll only last for so long.
[1:14:54] Somebody will outdo you. Mark Cuban or
[1:14:56] Trump or somebody else will put you to
[1:14:58] shame. Come on, somebody. If you're the
[1:15:00] greatest singer, if you're the greatest
[1:15:01] preacher, it'll be short-lived. But if
[1:15:04] you fulfill your part in the drama,
[1:15:06] eternity will contain you and the great
[1:15:09] archives of God. If you ain't got no
[1:15:12] more to say than amen, Lord, so be it
[1:15:15] unto me according to thy word.
[1:15:18] [Applause]
[1:15:28] You can see the presence of God
[1:15:30] vindicating and making the great drama
[1:15:32] that's foretold here in this Bible to
[1:15:35] act itself out. What a time to live. The
[1:15:38] most glorious time. The man of all ages
[1:15:40] has long for this time. The prophets of
[1:15:44] old long to see this hour
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; but wasn't privileged.
[1:15:52] You're blessed.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm fighting such battles. I'm
[1:15:55] going through this and the other. Quit
[1:15:56] focusing on that negative stuff all the
[1:15:58] time.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I know you're going through battles. I
[1:16:00] know you're going through trial. But you
[1:16:02] got so many blessings. You ought to go
[1:16:03] to counting them instead of counting
[1:16:05] your trials. Anybody tell me where the
[1:16:06] Bible says count your troubles.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You've got so much to
[1:16:14] be grateful for today. I had to borrow
[1:16:16] $5 to come to church. You say, "Brother
[1:16:18] Donnie, I had to come to church hungry.
[1:16:20] Let me know. I'll take you out and buy
[1:16:21] you a hamburger after church. But I'll
[1:16:23] tell you one thing. You've got life,
[1:16:25] ain't you? You got breast, ain't you?
[1:16:27] You got a church to go to, don't you?
[1:16:29] You got a man of God preaching to you
[1:16:31] tonight. You got saints of God that love
[1:16:32] you. You got angels of God that are in
[1:16:35] this building right here tonight to
[1:16:37] minister unto you of salvation.
[1:16:44] Hallelujah.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now let's
[1:16:50] let's move into
[1:16:55] this realm
[1:16:59] that God knew we would need divine help.
[1:17:04] So he allowed beings
[1:17:06] that would be able to influence us
[1:17:10] and help us to act out our part. Now
[1:17:13] remember, Rebecca didn't calculate this
[1:17:15] and figure it all out. Rebecca had an
[1:17:18] angelic visitor.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; 30 minutes before Elizer got there
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; and that angel told her to go to the
[1:17:28] well.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:33] Now watch in Hebrews chapter 1:13.
[1:17:36] But to which of the angels said he at
[1:17:38] any time
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; set on my right hand until I make thine
[1:17:43] enemies thy foottool?
[1:17:46] Are they not all
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; ministering
[1:17:52] spirits
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; sent forth to minister for them
[1:18:01] who shall be heirs
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; of salvation
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; sinless holy beings
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; which have never thought one thing wrong
[1:18:12] never uttered one wrong word never done
[1:18:15] one thing wrong. And yet God created
[1:18:17] them to be your ministers.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The greater to help and assist the
[1:18:25] lesser.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; But only the lesser for a while.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz actually you are greater than they
[1:18:34] are.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I'll let you think on that for a bit.
[1:18:39] Psalms 103 verse20. Bless the Lord,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; you his angels that excel in strength,
[1:18:48] that do his commandments, hearkening
[1:18:52] unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the
[1:18:56] Lord, all ye his host, ye ministers
[1:19:02] of his
[1:19:04] that do his pleasure.
[1:19:08] Now remember, they're not preachers,
[1:19:11] but they're ministering spirits
[1:19:15] sent to minister
[1:19:17] unto you and I.
[1:19:20] Now, they can also do natural things
[1:19:24] like the angel of the Lord come in
[1:19:26] amongst the camp one time
[1:19:30] and slew
[1:19:34] 185,000.
[1:19:38] of the enemies of Israel in one night.
[1:19:45] No nukes,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; no tomahawks,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; 2 Kings 19:32. Therefore, thus sayeth
[1:19:53] the Lord concerning the king of Assyria,
[1:19:56] he shall not come into this city, nor
[1:19:59] shoot an arrow, not even one,
[1:20:04] nor come before it with a shield, nor
[1:20:07] cast a bank against it. By the way he
[1:20:10] came, by the same shall he return and
[1:20:14] shall not come into this city, saith the
[1:20:16] Lord. For I will defend this city to
[1:20:20] save it for mine own sake. Glory to God.
[1:20:25] It wasn't that they deserved it. It
[1:20:28] wasn't that they done everything right.
[1:20:30] God did it for his own sake. Oh, I hope
[1:20:32] one of these days you're going to see
[1:20:33] it. The very reason you're saved is for
[1:20:36] his sake. The very reason he loves you,
[1:20:38] the abundance of grace and mercy and
[1:20:40] revelation and kindness beyond what we
[1:20:43] all deserve. Can anybody say amen to
[1:20:45] that? He ain't doing it because we're so
[1:20:47] good and sweet and kind and lovely. He's
[1:20:49] doing it for his own sake. Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] He ordained a bride and there ain't
[1:20:55] enough devils in hell to stop him from
[1:20:58] accomplishing that part of the drama. He
[1:21:00] can go plum over to the back of the book
[1:21:03] and have the drama done shut up in
[1:21:05] prophecy and say the end. Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] Tell me who can reverse it.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; For my own sake
[1:21:21] and
[1:21:23] for my servant
[1:21:26] David's sake.
[1:21:28] You mean to tell me God will kill
[1:21:31] 185,000
[1:21:33] people
[1:21:36] for the sake of a man
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; who committed adultery.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; A man who numbered the people. A man who
[1:21:44] disobeyed God.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice how God put
[1:21:50] David in with his own. God said for my
[1:21:53] sake and for David's
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; cuz we're buddies. Yeah.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; You can't ask for a better buddy. Buddy.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that night that the
[1:22:12] angel of the Lord went out and smoked in
[1:22:14] the camp of the Assyrians 104 scorn
[1:22:18] 5,000 185,000.
[1:22:22] And when they arose early in the
[1:22:24] morning, behold, they were all dead
[1:22:26] corpses. Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't that the Assyrians got
[1:22:31] up.
[1:22:33] They arose. They didn't arise. When
[1:22:36] Israel got up,
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; 185,000, God had took care of every one
[1:22:42] of them in one night. Well, probably
[1:22:43] didn't even take them a night, just a
[1:22:44] matter of a minute or two. And they were
[1:22:46] all dead corpses. Let me tell you
[1:22:49] something, friends. Our God has got the
[1:22:51] same power tonight. Come on, somebody
[1:22:53] preach with me. And if my God wants
[1:22:56] somebody to live in this life, they can
[1:22:59] live. If my God calls them home, there
[1:23:01] ain't enough preachers. There ain't
[1:23:03] enough churches to pray to keep them
[1:23:05] here. If it's God's time for them to
[1:23:07] come home, they're going home. But they
[1:23:09] ain't going home. But God is ready. I'll
[1:23:13] tell you. And I read this boy. I really
[1:23:15] throw it right at the devil with both
[1:23:17] barrels. I said, "Did you hear that,
[1:23:19] devil? You can't take this man, that
[1:23:21] woman, my daughter, this woman's
[1:23:23] husband, that son. You can't do it
[1:23:26] because you want to. Our life is in the
[1:23:29] hands of Almighty God, not even in her
[1:23:32] own hands.
[1:23:33] [Applause]
[1:23:41] Now look at your identification
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; before angelic beings
[1:23:48] based upon your confession
[1:23:51] and your belief about the Lord Jesus.
[1:23:55] Luke 12:8 also I say unto you, whosoever
[1:23:58] shall confess me
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; before men
[1:24:05] shall the son of man also confess
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; and the word is say the same thing
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; before the angels of God.
[1:24:20] So, you're talking about Jesus to your
[1:24:22] boss, talking about Jesus to your mama,
[1:24:25] your daddy, whoever it is.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is talking about you
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; before the angels.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. What an honor.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Now, reversal of that in verse n. But he
[1:24:40] that denieth me
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; before men shall be denied
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; before the angels of God.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; It's probably a good thing that this
[1:24:59] scripture wasn't written
[1:25:01] after the crucifixion because Peter
[1:25:04] to put his finger on that scripture.
[1:25:06] said, "I I I I can't come back.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I can't come back.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Depends on who you are."
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; You see, if your confession is you are
[1:25:21] his before the world began,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; tell me what can happen in time that'll
[1:25:27] ever change what he said about you.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; But there ain't no question about it.
[1:25:32] We've all lost friends and there's
[1:25:33] things people said about us and we
[1:25:35] think, "Woo! Boy, I'll tell you one
[1:25:36] thing. I don't know if I ever want to be
[1:25:38] close to them or not." But that's the
[1:25:40] difference between us and God. We don't
[1:25:42] know what our friends will do. We don't
[1:25:43] know what our brothers and sisters do.
[1:25:45] You don't know what your own family will
[1:25:46] do to you for it's all said and done.
[1:25:48] But he knew everything I'd do to him and
[1:25:50] looked at me and said, "I love you
[1:25:52] anyhow and there ain't nothing you can
[1:25:54] do down there that'll ever turn me
[1:25:56] against you." You know what? I believe
[1:25:58] the Lord Jesus looks at us as I brought
[1:26:00] up Mphibicheth on Sunday. I believe the
[1:26:03] Lord Jesus looks at us, brother Joel,
[1:26:05] through the eyes of empathy and also
[1:26:08] sympathy and also in a sense of
[1:26:10] humanity. He sees our failures. He sees
[1:26:13] our weaknesses and he actually feels
[1:26:16] sorry for us knowing that we are
[1:26:19] captured prisoners in this humanity. and
[1:26:22] knowing in a moment of time when he
[1:26:24] releases us from this body, we will
[1:26:27] never be that way again. Because in our
[1:26:29] soul, we are not that way now. Oh,
[1:26:32] hallelujah to God. He knows one day
[1:26:35] we'll get a body that'll match his
[1:26:38] thought.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Now, we looked at Peter the other night,
[1:26:48] the angels of God opening the prison
[1:26:50] door. Look again in Acts 5:18. Look at
[1:26:53] some of the relations that angels has
[1:26:55] with men on the earth. They laid their
[1:26:57] hands on the apostles and put them in
[1:26:59] the common prison. But the angel of the
[1:27:01] Lord by night opened the prison doors
[1:27:04] and brought them forth.
[1:27:08] But does he open every prison door?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; What if death faces you?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; What if some type of sickness this that
[1:27:15] the other? sometimes if that's the way
[1:27:18] he's going to take you from the earth.
[1:27:19] You can cry, you can pray and do all you
[1:27:21] want to do.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Notice again Acts 12 21. Look at Herod.
[1:27:30] And upon a set day, Herod arrayed in
[1:27:32] royal apparel and sat upon his throne
[1:27:35] and made an oration unto them. And the
[1:27:38] people gave a shout,
[1:27:41] saying, "It is the voice of a God."
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. not of a man. And immediately the
[1:27:49] angel of the Lord smokeote him because
[1:27:51] he gave not God the glory.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine this man must have made
[1:27:57] such a powerful impressive speech and
[1:28:00] all God wanted him to do was just say,
[1:28:03] "Father, thank you for helping me to be
[1:28:05] able to say these words." Come on.
[1:28:07] Reminds me of preachers.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. Boy, I'll tell you one thing. I
[1:28:11] preached this great message. I've done
[1:28:13] this. I've done that. The other. You
[1:28:15] want the angel of God to smite your
[1:28:16] height.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Give God glory.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Give God glory for your 1,385p
[1:28:24] part series. Give God the glory for the
[1:28:27] mysteries that you preach. Give God the
[1:28:30] glory for every person you've laid your
[1:28:32] hands on and they've got healed. Lest
[1:28:34] the angel of the Lord smite you.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Now look how they interact with human
[1:28:42] beings. They can minister life or
[1:28:47] encouragement
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; or take your life.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I want to be on the right side of these
[1:28:56] angels, don't you? Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Now, here is part of the mystery
[1:29:05] which actually was kept secret from the
[1:29:09] angels and it pertains
[1:29:13] to the mystery of God,
[1:29:17] the incarnation
[1:29:19] of the word itself in humanity.
[1:29:24] This is astounding scripture to me.
[1:29:26] Hebrews 1:5. For under which of the
[1:29:28] angel said he at any time, thou art my
[1:29:31] son,
[1:29:33] this day have I begotten thee. And
[1:29:36] again, I will be to him a father, and he
[1:29:39] shall be to me a son.
[1:29:42] And again, when he bringeth
[1:29:46] in the firstborn
[1:29:49] into the world, he saith,
[1:29:53] "Let all the angels of God
[1:29:56] worship him."
[1:29:58] So you mean angels
[1:30:02] had to be told
[1:30:05] to worship Jesus Christ.
[1:30:11] Testing. One, two. One, two, one, two.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Sound check. Sound check.
[1:30:17] Why would angelic beings
[1:30:21] have to be told
[1:30:24] to worship him?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Because they knew better than to worship
[1:30:32] what was supposed to be
[1:30:36] creation.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; That's idolatry.
[1:30:41] to worship creation as Paul said they
[1:30:44] worshiped the creature more than the
[1:30:46] creator.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; So for you to worship creation
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; instead of the creator
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; that's idolatry. So whether it's your
[1:30:57] job or your home or your wife or your
[1:30:58] mother, your father, your career, your
[1:31:01] body,
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; To go to the gym and work out and stand
[1:31:05] in the mirror and selfies all over
[1:31:07] everywhere and show your big muscles.
[1:31:09] Uh-huh. You know what you're doing?
[1:31:10] You're worshiping the creature.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Now, what was it about the Lord Jesus,
[1:31:16] hey, that the angels of God would have
[1:31:19] to be instructed if they understood
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; the work of incarnation?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Why would they need to be told, "Let the
[1:31:31] angels of God worship him?" Boy, I'm
[1:31:35] going to hear from this one, ain't I?
[1:31:36] I'm sorry y'all had never noticed this
[1:31:38] in your Bible.
[1:31:40] Now notice he saith to them and again
[1:31:43] when he bringeth the firstborn into the
[1:31:45] world he saith let all the angels of God
[1:31:51] worship him.
[1:31:54] So you see for those of us who
[1:31:56] understand the mystery or at least this
[1:31:59] part of it of the Godhead once again it
[1:32:03] testifies to us
[1:32:06] he is not a creature of time.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Father had to illuminate the angels of
[1:32:14] God as they saw what looked like a human
[1:32:18] being.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; He had to illuminate them. This is not
[1:32:22] just a creature.
[1:32:25] This is me
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; in another form.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Why? They didn't see it. They didn't
[1:32:34] understand. Even the angels of God,
[1:32:37] brother Nathan, had to be instructed.
[1:32:40] Worship him. It's me.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; It's me in another form.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; But he looks so much human. Oh my. Then
[1:32:50] what do they do?
[1:32:52] Don't you understand? He had to
[1:32:54] enlighten them before he was born or
[1:32:59] they would have never went down there
[1:33:00] and sung.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; They would have never went down there
[1:33:03] and worshiped him the way they did
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; because they was looking at it from Oh,
[1:33:08] hallelujah to God. They was looking at
[1:33:11] it from a holy angelic perspective. This
[1:33:14] had been hid in the very heart of God
[1:33:17] since the foundation of the world. And
[1:33:19] they didn't have a clue. There's no way
[1:33:22] that they can worship a creature.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; sure.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; They worshiped the creator. That's all
[1:33:27] they knew. But the creator had to
[1:33:31] illuminate them.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hey, it's me.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I wrote this part of the drama for
[1:33:40] myself.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:33:48] So, Father had to send out this message
[1:33:52] to these beings.
[1:33:54] Let all the angels of God
[1:33:59] worship him.
[1:34:01] And I look around think
[1:34:07] isn't a woman carrying him.
[1:34:13] I mean, how how could God a baby?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; How could this speak?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; But you imagine when the angels heard
[1:34:26] it, they do like we do sometimes.
[1:34:29] They still might not have understood.
[1:34:31] They said, "Glory to God." He said,
[1:34:32] "Worship. I'm going to worship."
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't feel nothing, but I'm
[1:34:37] going to worship anyhow.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Worship him. I'm going to
[1:34:40] worship him with all my heart." the the
[1:34:42] mystery will further be unveiled. Oh,
[1:34:45] was it ever unveiled?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Let all the angels of God. Now, had they
[1:34:51] known,
[1:34:53] had they seen this, Harry, don't you
[1:34:56] understand how this annihilates
[1:34:57] trinitarian doctrine,
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; if Jesus was a pre-existing son there
[1:35:04] before the father, and the father and
[1:35:06] the son had a conversation like an old
[1:35:08] man and a young man, they would have
[1:35:10] known who he was. He would have stepped
[1:35:13] down off of that secondary throne and
[1:35:16] they'd say, "Well, the son in here, he's
[1:35:18] gone. I guess that's him down there."
[1:35:20] But it was so mysterious
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; that even the angels didn't see it.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Lord God
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; to worship
[1:35:38] any creature
[1:35:41] is idolatry.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pure worship is to worship the
[1:35:48] creator.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand friends why many
[1:35:52] people they actually worship their
[1:35:53] church. They worship their pastor. They
[1:35:56] worship their job, their work. They
[1:35:58] become so work alcoholic. They're
[1:36:00] worshiping their work. They're
[1:36:01] worshiping their job. They're in love.
[1:36:03] They're in love with being a
[1:36:05] businessman. They eat it. They drink it.
[1:36:07] They they think it. They dream about it.
[1:36:09] It's everything. It's it's an idol.
[1:36:12] Any creature that we worship
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; is idolatry.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Man was made to worship one thing only,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; the creator.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I've got a preacher friend of mine
[1:36:37] that will not wear
[1:36:39] sunglasses.
[1:36:43] Because he says
[1:36:45] every time that he puts on sunglasses,
[1:36:50] he gets an attitude.
[1:36:57] Ain't that something?
[1:37:01] I guess Mr. Cool, you know.
[1:37:04] So he gets an attitude.
[1:37:06] So you know what? He won't wear them.
[1:37:09] I went to Maine several years ago to
[1:37:11] preach there and there's a brother come
[1:37:13] pick me up at the airport and hide on
[1:37:14] blue jeans which what I normally wear. I
[1:37:17] noticed him looking at me funny and he
[1:37:20] asked me if he could talk to him. I
[1:37:21] said, "Sure." He said, "Brother Donnie,
[1:37:23] I was in the world. I was a hippie. I
[1:37:24] was this, this, this." You know, just
[1:37:26] going through different types of things
[1:37:27] and tell him, he said, "I just can't
[1:37:28] wear blue jeans. I I just can't do it."
[1:37:31] He told me some other things. I just
[1:37:33] can't do that. I said, "Brother, I
[1:37:35] understand that that relates to you to
[1:37:37] the to the world out there.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Somehow another that relates to you in
[1:37:41] that way." I said, "But I wasn't out
[1:37:43] there."
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I like these blue jeans.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; You do know a Jew made them.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Levi Strauss. Jewish.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; A lot of things in your home and in your
[1:37:57] life,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Jewish ideas. Why? God said, "Through
[1:38:02] you, I'll bless the world." You're
[1:38:04] putting them on every day,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; leaving your sisters in skirt form.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when we Oh, Lord, shutter
[1:38:15] me. When we take pride and I achieve
[1:38:18] this, I've done that. I've done this.
[1:38:20] Don't you understand why Paul had to
[1:38:21] have that thorn in the flesh? Even Paul,
[1:38:23] the great man, he was filled with the
[1:38:25] Holy Ghost. But he said, "Lest I should
[1:38:27] be exalted above measure." Not because
[1:38:29] he built a beautiful building, not
[1:38:31] because he was this, that or the other,
[1:38:33] but because God had showed him a
[1:38:34] revelation which was above or superior
[1:38:37] to his brothers.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And God had to let that devil aggravate
[1:38:42] Paul and aggravate Paul to keep this old
[1:38:45] flesh from his from getting lifted up.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Why? Then Paul would
[1:38:50] go to worshiping the creature.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I thank God for our place. But we never
[1:39:03] want to make an idol out of this place.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I've been over here so much this
[1:39:10] summer doing this and that and the other
[1:39:12] and there's very few times that I pulled
[1:39:14] in that driveway just like today. I
[1:39:16] didn't look at and said, "Lord, thank
[1:39:17] you so much for your blessing and we're
[1:39:19] so grateful." But we never want to
[1:39:22] worship creation or to create or a
[1:39:25] creature. We want to keep all of our
[1:39:28] worship. Well, friend, this is why I'm
[1:39:30] not against you playing a basketball
[1:39:31] game. I'm not against you out there
[1:39:33] running and this and that and the other.
[1:39:34] But whenever that becomes your soul love
[1:39:37] and your desire and you love sports more
[1:39:39] than you love the Lord Jesus, don't you
[1:39:41] understand what you're doing? You're
[1:39:42] worshiping a creation of man.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; It would be wrong and sinful for us to
[1:39:47] even worship the stars which were
[1:39:50] created by God. But we would be
[1:39:52] worshiping a creation, not the creator.
[1:39:56] Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:40:00] So Jesus Christ,
[1:40:03] Jesus Christ,
[1:40:05] here's the mystery.
[1:40:08] He was totally man
[1:40:11] and yet totally God.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; But Jesus Christ
[1:40:20] is glorified humanity.
[1:40:22] And the angel could not tell Mary to
[1:40:24] call him Lord Jesus Christ when he was
[1:40:26] born. Come on now.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; But thou shalt call the human tense name
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; human
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ wasn't even mentioned
[1:40:38] the four gospels. If you read your Bible
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; when did it come into mention? Book of
[1:40:43] Acts and the epistles of Paul. Why? He
[1:40:46] wasn't Lord Jesus Christ yet. Uh-huh.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; But when the father comes in him,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he becomes the Christ. Now
[1:40:58] listen carefully. He was not even the
[1:41:01] Christ yet.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; He lived on this earth as a man for 30
[1:41:06] years without the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; You imagine the angels looking at him
[1:41:12] and said,
[1:41:15] "Who is this? What is this? I mean, what
[1:41:17] what's going on?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And then the father slips down in the
[1:41:23] form of a dove
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; and fills him with himself.
[1:41:29] Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; You imagine when the angels of God
[1:41:33] finally catch him. I said, "What a
[1:41:35] plan."
[1:41:37] Don't you understand what happened? The
[1:41:39] audio finally caught up with the video.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; So, what did God do? The audio. This is
[1:41:46] my beloved part of the drama in whom I
[1:41:50] am pleased to dwell. The symphony, the
[1:41:53] symphony, the drama, the father, the
[1:41:55] son. Hallelujah. It all come together
[1:41:58] right there in the river. No wonder the
[1:42:01] angels of God stood there. They say, "Oh
[1:42:03] my God,
[1:42:06] oh my."
[1:42:08] So this this is
[1:42:12] so that was Adam and Eve in the garden
[1:42:13] of Eden. That was Isaac and Rebecca. You
[1:42:16] imagine that one angel jumping up and
[1:42:17] said, "Glory to God." I see it for the
[1:42:20] first time. That's why I was sent down
[1:42:22] there to Rebecca, Lord have mercy. I
[1:42:24] didn't even know that's what it was. You
[1:42:26] mean he's Isaac? She's like, "Oh my
[1:42:28] goodness, this is awesome. This is
[1:42:29] awesome.
[1:42:39] Glory.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; If the angels
[1:42:46] would have worshiped Jesus
[1:42:49] and he was the second person of the
[1:42:51] Godhead
[1:42:53] and Aryanism started projecting in the
[1:42:56] first century that he was a lesser god
[1:42:59] and a lesser creation
[1:43:02] actually created being.
[1:43:05] Then God the Father would have been
[1:43:07] telling holy angels
[1:43:09] to idol worship.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; They would have been worshiping a
[1:43:14] creature.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; But brother Donnie, brother says he was
[1:43:22] the beginning of the new creation. He
[1:43:24] sure did.
[1:43:27] But that new creation did not have a day
[1:43:29] necessarily when it started.
[1:43:32] It was an attribute from the eternal.
[1:43:34] Come on, somebody.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Let me just go ahead and bring it to you
[1:43:37] tonight. You didn't have a day when you
[1:43:40] had started.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Or you might might have come up to the
[1:43:43] altar. The prophet said you wouldn't
[1:43:44] saved on any certain day. You always was
[1:43:48] saved in the mind of God. You always was
[1:43:51] saved. He just had to bring you to a
[1:43:53] recognition of it. And you' be able to
[1:43:55] recognize who you already were by the
[1:43:57] grace of God. Hallelujah. Don't you
[1:44:00] understand how the bride must see who
[1:44:03] she is in the last day in order for the
[1:44:06] rapture to go?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 1:14. Are they not all
[1:44:19] ministering spirits
[1:44:22] sent forth to minister for them? sent
[1:44:25] forth to minister for them
[1:44:28] who shall be heirs of salvation.
[1:44:31] So a ministering spirit is one that is
[1:44:33] sent employed
[1:44:36] to execute the divine will of God.
[1:44:40] To who? Heirs.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Angels are not errors of God.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's those who render aid to
[1:44:51] others and help sent forth appointed by
[1:44:56] God. Remember God sending Gabriel in
[1:45:00] Daniel 9.
[1:45:03] Daniel needed understanding
[1:45:06] and the angel come and ministered to
[1:45:08] him.
[1:45:09] Oh Jesus.
[1:45:12] Let me go ahead and say it.
[1:45:14] One of the highest honors given to
[1:45:17] angelic beings
[1:45:19] is a coming minister
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; to the heirs of salvation
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; oh you and I think oh my the highest
[1:45:32] honor would be there to stay around his
[1:45:33] throne. No they've dealt with him on a
[1:45:37] firsthand basis and they've seen how he
[1:45:39] looks.
[1:45:41] They've seen how he's so touched by our
[1:45:43] needs. And they've seen what it does to
[1:45:45] him.
[1:45:47] Such is the love and the care that God
[1:45:49] has toward
[1:45:51] his people.
[1:45:55] Are they not all ministering spirits
[1:45:57] sent to minister for them who shall be
[1:45:59] heirs
[1:46:01] of salvation? So they are employed by
[1:46:03] almighty God
[1:46:05] to come and minister to the heirs on the
[1:46:08] father's will.
[1:46:11] Notice Hebrews 2:1. Therefore, we ought
[1:46:14] to give the more earnest heed to the
[1:46:16] things which we have heard, lest at any
[1:46:19] time we should let them slip.
[1:46:22] For if the word spoken by angels
[1:46:28] were steadfast,
[1:46:30] and every transgression and disobedience
[1:46:32] received a just recompense of reward.
[1:46:35] Now, remember what I read to you last
[1:46:36] Wednesday night in Galatians 3:19.
[1:46:38] Therefore then serveth it the law. It
[1:46:41] was added because of transgression till
[1:46:43] the seed should come to whom the promise
[1:46:45] was made. It was ordained by angels in
[1:46:47] the hand of a mediator. Yet here Paul
[1:46:49] says the word spoken
[1:46:53] by angels.
[1:46:56] If the word spoken by angels, how shall
[1:46:59] we escape? Verse three, if we neglect so
[1:47:03] great salvation was first at the
[1:47:04] beginning spoken by the Lord and was
[1:47:07] confirmed unto us by them that heard it.
[1:47:10] Hebrews 2:9. But we see Jesus
[1:47:14] who was made a little lower
[1:47:22] than the angels.
[1:47:26] You imagine it's their holy eyes
[1:47:30] beheld this
[1:47:34] and in their angelic thinking and
[1:47:37] thoughts they're thinking
[1:47:40] how can
[1:47:42] how can
[1:47:44] we worship something
[1:47:48] that is less than us.
[1:47:56] But notice Paul's terms.
[1:47:59] But we see Jesus,
[1:48:01] not the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; But we see Jesus,
[1:48:08] the house, the human temple.
[1:48:12] But we see Jesus
[1:48:14] who was made a little lower than the
[1:48:16] angels, far the suffering of death. But
[1:48:20] what do we see about Jesus?
[1:48:23] crowned
[1:48:26] crowned
[1:48:28] with glory and honor that he by the
[1:48:31] grace of God.
[1:48:34] Do you understand how Jesus did this?
[1:48:37] By the grace of God.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to have the grace of God. Not
[1:48:45] to forgive him of his sins, not to
[1:48:47] forgive him of his wrong, but to give
[1:48:49] him the ability as a human
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; to carry out the will of God.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Remember this scripture, 1 Timothy 3:16.
[1:49:01] And without controversy, great
[1:49:04] is the mystery of godliness.
[1:49:06] God
[1:49:10] God was manifest in the flesh,
[1:49:13] justified in the spirit,
[1:49:20] seen
[1:49:23] of angels.
[1:49:26] Now, why is this a mystery?
[1:49:30] That the angels
[1:49:32] would see God.
[1:49:36] And Paul is putting in this verse these
[1:49:38] remarkable events. For without
[1:49:41] controversy, great is the mystery of
[1:49:42] godliness. For God was manifest in the
[1:49:45] flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of
[1:49:50] angels, alluding to they had never seen
[1:49:53] him before.
[1:49:56] That's right.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; In this form of the drama
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; scene
[1:50:06] of angels.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Why is that remarkable? If they seen him
[1:50:11] for millions of years,
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; it was a desire.
[1:50:19] It was a secret.
[1:50:21] But they saw the secret
[1:50:23] made manifest. And the angels of God
[1:50:25] could say, "I have heard, but now I
[1:50:29] see."
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; I have seen
[1:50:37] him.
[1:50:40] seen of angels, preached unto the
[1:50:45] Gentiles, received on in the world,
[1:50:48] received up
[1:50:51] into glory. Who was God?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Let me close with this. Revelation
[1:51:01] chapter 4 part three. You notice these
[1:51:05] cherubams that John saw there must have
[1:51:08] been interested in keeping the tree of
[1:51:10] life.
[1:51:12] So they must be interested in human
[1:51:14] beings.
[1:51:15] Or read Genesis getting back to Genesis
[1:51:17] again. They kept the tree of life and
[1:51:19] guarded it. The way of life. The way of
[1:51:21] life. How is the way? Jesus said, "I am
[1:51:23] the way. I am the bread
[1:51:26] that come from God out of heaven. If a
[1:51:28] man eats this bread, he'll live
[1:51:29] forever." Now, there was a way back to
[1:51:32] that tree of life. You get it? Now, this
[1:51:34] I want to show you now and make sure
[1:51:36] this sure it's at an altar.
[1:51:40] Now, there must have been an altar at
[1:51:43] the Garden of Eden. And I'll tell you
[1:51:44] why. You remember both Cain and Abel
[1:51:46] come up there to worship.
[1:51:49] So, that showed that God's altar was
[1:51:51] moved and set here at the Garden of
[1:51:55] Eden.
[1:51:57] And the only way back to Eden,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; is back by the altar. Here you are
[1:52:04] again. See, back to Eden through the
[1:52:06] altar. And they were to keep the way
[1:52:08] there to guard it. They couldn't get
[1:52:10] back there until the altar was covered
[1:52:14] with blood.
[1:52:17] Oh, God. Can't people see it? Nothing
[1:52:21] but the blood. There has to be an
[1:52:24] atonement, a mercy seat.
[1:52:28] This altar of judgment must become
[1:52:32] a mercy seat.
[1:52:35] A stand.
[1:52:42] So the cherubims over the ark of the
[1:52:44] covenant
[1:52:46] faced each other and looked down toward
[1:52:50] the mercy seat,
[1:52:52] which was the seat that cherubim sat on.
[1:52:55] They weren't looking at each other. They
[1:52:57] wasn't looking up this way. They weren't
[1:52:59] looking at their neighbor, but they was
[1:53:01] looking down at the mercy seat,
[1:53:06] trying to understand.
[1:53:09] As Peter said
[1:53:11] about the Holy Ghost, the angels of God
[1:53:14] stooped down
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; to look into
[1:53:19] and understand.
[1:53:24] Praise God.
[1:53:28] Let all the angels of God
[1:53:31] worship him. I guarantee you one thing.
[1:53:34] They didn't need to be told that 583,000
[1:53:37] times.
[1:53:39] They were told one time and from that
[1:53:41] time on they've done it ever since.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Well, if we're his bride, we shouldn't
[1:53:47] have to be told it 583,000 times either.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; It ought to be something in our soul. It
[1:53:54] ought to be something that responds even
[1:53:56] in our emotions.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:54:02] Don't you love him?
[1:54:05] Look at what is in your diary.
[1:54:12] I I need just a couple more minutes.
[1:54:15] So angels are sent to give us strengths
[1:54:19] to resist temptation.
[1:54:22] strength
[1:54:24] was furnished
[1:54:27] to our Lord Jesus
[1:54:30] in the garden of Gethsemane
[1:54:33] in Luke 22:43.
[1:54:38] Angels come
[1:54:40] and ministered
[1:54:43] to him.
[1:54:46] And imagine he is there thinking,
[1:54:49] "I've worshiped him.
[1:54:52] I've adored him. I've loved him. I've
[1:54:54] worshiped him.
[1:54:57] But now he needs my strength."
[1:55:03] Remember in Matthew 4 and Luke 4 as
[1:55:05] well, whenever he was tempted of the
[1:55:07] devil, he fasted and he was tempted of
[1:55:08] the devil and the angels of God came and
[1:55:13] ministered unto him.
[1:55:17] So here he is.
[1:55:19] He's fixing to face Calvary
[1:55:23] and he needs angelic help.
[1:55:29] Oh children, this is why we want to live
[1:55:31] right. This is why we want to live
[1:55:32] clean.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Can't you see why the majority of
[1:55:36] Christendom,
[1:55:37] they'll never have these visitations?
[1:55:40] They live filthy lives. Their homes are
[1:55:42] ungodly. They're they're they're
[1:55:44] everything about them is their church
[1:55:46] members. They're less of sins. They're
[1:55:47] naked. They're wretched. They're blind.
[1:55:48] They're they're naked. They're pitiful.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; But if you and I live right and clean
[1:55:53] before the Lord, we have promises
[1:55:57] that when we get to a spot in our
[1:55:59] garden,
[1:56:01] we think we can't go no further.
[1:56:04] Father can dispatch angels to us.
[1:56:10] If you'll think back real, real real
[1:56:13] close, you'll probably remember times in
[1:56:15] your life
[1:56:18] when you wasn't sure. You just wasn't
[1:56:20] sure. Maybe you was praying. You felt
[1:56:23] nothing. You had no tears. You had no
[1:56:25] anointing. You had nothing.
[1:56:28] But somehow another when you got done,
[1:56:31] you just had a little bit more of a
[1:56:32] desire.
[1:56:34] Something just really happened.
[1:56:39] If God would have opened your eyes and
[1:56:41] you'd look standing there by you,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; it would have been your angel,
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; which is yourself
[1:56:51] in another dimension.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; That'll about blow your brain, won't it?
[1:57:10] No, question me if you want to on next
[1:57:12] Wednesday night. It's up to you. Or you
[1:57:13] can take my word for it tonight.
[1:57:17] Can you imagine
[1:57:20] angels of God
[1:57:22] coming,
[1:57:25] ministering,
[1:57:27] helping us, aiding our faith. I don't
[1:57:31] know about you, I need them.
[1:57:34] I need them, brother.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I need them.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't I receive from them?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Brother, how will I know if it's a if
[1:57:45] it's a true angel or a fallen angel?
[1:57:47] Easy. They'll never leave the word.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Your angel will never come from heaven
[1:57:54] and say, "Well, Brandon was a false
[1:57:55] prophet. He was a deceiver and a liar."
[1:57:57] You point your finger in that angel's
[1:57:58] face and say, "Go right back to hell
[1:58:00] where you come from."
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Angel will never leave the word
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; and it'll come to minister.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that when he ministered,
[1:58:11] Jesus did not regain the anointing.
[1:58:14] No, the anointing left him in the garden
[1:58:16] of Gethsemane.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; So, he didn't minister anointing, but
[1:58:21] strength. Strength for what? The journey
[1:58:25] to the cross.
[1:58:29] Praise God.
[1:58:34] How many loves him with all your heart?
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't this awesome tonight?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't this awesome?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe it's just me, but
[1:58:51] kind of makes me wonder if we haven't
[1:58:53] maybe
[1:58:55] ptook of a little angel's food tonight.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:01] Do you honestly think them angels ate
[1:59:04] that bread?
[1:59:09] You honestly think them angels in heaven
[1:59:11] took that bread off of their table and
[1:59:13] it was actually their physical bread.
[1:59:15] What did Jesus say about bread? My bread
[1:59:18] is to do the will of him
[1:59:21] that sent me.
[1:59:24] So bread isn't just always what we put
[1:59:26] in our mouths.
[1:59:28] It's what we do.
[1:59:31] Angels of God are right here in this
[1:59:33] building tonight to share angels food
[1:59:36] with you.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; The strength for you
[1:59:42] to do the father's will.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; They're not faced by temptations by
[1:59:48] lurements.
[1:59:50] Women don't bother them, brothers.
[1:59:52] Lying, gossiping, pride, arrogance, it
[1:59:55] don't bother them.
[1:59:57] But they're here to share.
[2:00:00] They're here to minister to you. I can
[2:00:03] preach the word to you. And an angel
[2:00:04] couldn't stand here tonight and take my
[2:00:06] iPad. He's not called to preach. But he
[2:00:10] can minister angelic realms,
[2:00:15] spiritual realms
[2:00:17] that I cannot do and no other man can
[2:00:19] do.
[2:00:21] Praise God.
[2:00:24] Boware heads if you would.
[2:00:36] If fallen and malignant angels come to
[2:00:40] tempt,
[2:00:41] to try to test, why would it be hard for
[2:00:43] us to believe
[2:00:45] that those who have maintained their
[2:00:47] position
[2:00:50] for millennia, for eternity,
[2:00:54] God would not send them to us
[2:00:58] to help us.
[2:01:01] Praise God.
[2:01:04] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:01:07] Heavenly Father, as we
[2:01:11] bow our heads tonight, Lord,
[2:01:14] I pray you'd help us.
[2:01:19] I'm sure they're probably
[2:01:22] some of them their minds running 90
[2:01:24] miles an hour would say trying to think
[2:01:28] Lord what in the world
[2:01:31] that's about the way I was when I
[2:01:32] started looking at this and thinking
[2:01:35] dear God
[2:01:37] dear God
[2:01:42] thank you father
[2:01:44] thank you,
[2:01:48] oh Jesus. Apparently, Lord,
[2:01:52] preaching in these last hours
[2:01:55] needs to be in a way that the first
[2:01:58] church age didn't need it. They needed
[2:02:01] strength for
[2:02:04] sacrifice and strength to be martyrs and
[2:02:10] strength, oh God, in that anointing of
[2:02:12] that day.
[2:02:14] Most of us will never be a martyr,
[2:02:17] but we're fighting against the powers of
[2:02:19] hell in a way that no other age has
[2:02:23] faced them. And the culmination of seven
[2:02:26] church ages, the weight of it is laying
[2:02:28] on our shoulders tonight.
[2:02:32] The weight of it is laying on the true
[2:02:33] men of God to preach the word.
[2:02:38] And yet, Father, we've never had such
[2:02:40] opposition. preachers haven't even in
[2:02:43] the ranks of the message. Who ever
[2:02:44] thought
[2:02:46] that preaching would be so laughed at
[2:02:49] and made fun of
[2:02:51] and people trying to get preachers to
[2:02:53] sat down and quit preaching.
[2:02:57] It can be expected for the world to do
[2:03:00] that. but inside our own ranks and to
[2:03:03] try to take the prophet's message
[2:03:07] and prove that preachers should sit down
[2:03:10] and only press play
[2:03:13] to take the very message that you sent
[2:03:16] to the earth to restore our hearts back
[2:03:19] to the original faith
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; and try to pull out quotes and put
[2:03:24] things together and to make it appear to
[2:03:27] the ignorant
[2:03:29] that preachers should not preach.
[2:03:32] What spirit would be on a man
[2:03:35] that would try to get any man or woman
[2:03:38] to discourage men of God from preaching?
[2:03:42] And your prophet never laid hands on
[2:03:44] tape players. And does God change his
[2:03:47] mind about his word in 41865
[2:03:50] in the evening service? He never laid
[2:03:53] his hands on realtore recorders.
[2:03:57] They didn't have, of course, CDs and
[2:03:58] digital format in that day, but he laid
[2:04:01] his hands on men.
[2:04:05] Men.
[2:04:07] So, if we don't do the same,
[2:04:11] we're not preaching nor believing nor
[2:04:13] acting like the messenger did.
[2:04:17] I pray you would anoint your men's
[2:04:19] servants like never before.
[2:04:22] In reality, Lord, it's just the little
[2:04:26] squirrel like the prophet saw the little
[2:04:28] chipmunk.
[2:04:30] Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. Days
[2:04:32] of miracles has passed. Chatter,
[2:04:34] chatter, chatter, chatter. All the
[2:04:36] preachers sat down. Chatter, chatter,
[2:04:38] chatter, chatter. But we're going to
[2:04:40] preach. They don't like it. We're
[2:04:42] preaching harder. We're preaching more.
[2:04:45] Stop preaching. Huh? That's exactly what
[2:04:47] the devil would want.
[2:04:50] Amen.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God, help us, Father.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:57] How many would raise your hands tonight
[2:04:59] to God and say, "Lord,
[2:05:01] help me to understand greater what I've
[2:05:03] heard here tonight.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Give me greater understanding, Lord." If
[2:05:08] you need to go back and listen to it
[2:05:09] again, listen to it, friends. Read these
[2:05:10] scriptures. Read these quotes. They're
[2:05:12] the truth.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Ponder and meditate what the Lord has in
[2:05:17] your diary, little brother.
[2:05:20] It's right there in your case, your
[2:05:22] little suitcase as it was as you're
[2:05:24] riding on the camel train heading back
[2:05:28] to our Isaac.
[2:05:32] Praise God. An angel introduced her.
[2:05:37] You say, "Brother Donnie, some of this
[2:05:38] stuff is pretty far out." I know it's
[2:05:40] far out. We need far out stuff to take
[2:05:42] us far out.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Same old same old church as yesterday.
[2:05:46] Church is as usual. That ain't going to
[2:05:48] get us out of this world.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; It's going to take a body changing
[2:05:52] message to get us out of here.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It ain't something
[2:05:57] that leaves the scripture. It's right in
[2:05:58] the scripture. I proved these things to
[2:06:00] you tonight from God's word. The mystery
[2:06:03] has been revealed.
[2:06:05] Think of it, friends. We're living in
[2:06:07] the day. You imagine if Paul would have
[2:06:10] been here tonight, he'd have probably
[2:06:11] tore this church up. If Peter would have
[2:06:14] been here tonight, he'd been running and
[2:06:15] screaming, "Glory to God. I never even
[2:06:17] seen it that plain when I was here. If
[2:06:19] James was here, oh my, the brothers,
[2:06:22] imagine if I don't know how that
[2:06:24] dimension works, but if they could have
[2:06:26] heard it on beyond the curtain of time
[2:06:27] tonight, they'd probably been saying,
[2:06:29] "Amen.
[2:06:31] Preach it. Preach it." You're going to
[2:06:33] get them to a place they're going to
[2:06:35] call us out of the sixth dimension.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And we're going back to
[2:06:40] Earth to take up bodies.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:45] Oh Jesus, help us.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Can we just raise our hands now?
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, beginning with me
[2:06:52] tonight. Lord, help me Jesus.
[2:06:57] Lord God, increase my understanding.
[2:07:00] Father, I don't want to lean on my own
[2:07:02] understanding or human reasoning, but
[2:07:05] Lord Jesus,
[2:07:06] upon your anointing of this hour,
[2:07:08] Father,
[2:07:10] how we thank you for the message of the
[2:07:12] word of God. It didn't come to replace
[2:07:14] our Bible. These scriptures have been
[2:07:16] laying right here, Father, for thousands
[2:07:18] of years.
[2:07:20] But now the drama is catching up with
[2:07:22] the audio. The audio and the video are
[2:07:26] synchronizing together and the echo is
[2:07:28] getting less and less. Praise the Lord.
[2:07:31] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[2:07:32] the Lord. But when the spirit and the
[2:07:35] bride are saying, "Come," John didn't
[2:07:38] hear an echo between the two voices.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride was saying,
[2:07:46] "Come, come, come, come, come." No,
[2:07:49] there wasn't an echo. The spirit said,
[2:07:50] and then an echo and then the bride
[2:07:52] finally said it, but they were
[2:07:54] synchronized.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, we thank you, Lord.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:01] Father, Brother Tim sent me a text there
[2:08:03] the other day after their meeting that
[2:08:04] backsliders had come back to you and
[2:08:06] people renewed their walk with you and
[2:08:09] different people got healed and things
[2:08:10] went on in their meetings down there
[2:08:12] last week. Thank you, Father. I text him
[2:08:15] back and said, "Praise God when one
[2:08:17] meeting closer to the rapture going
[2:08:18] home."
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Lord God, as we're heading over across
[2:08:22] the mountain, Father, this weekend to
[2:08:24] begin this camp, Lord, it might be the
[2:08:26] last young person that'll come in. It
[2:08:29] might be the last young person that'll
[2:08:30] get the Holy Ghost. We don't know. But
[2:08:33] we're looking for great things, Father.
[2:08:35] Hallelujah. The prophet tells us the
[2:08:38] final voice to the final age is in the
[2:08:42] bride. That's what the devil's really
[2:08:44] trying to shut up. Your voice.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you
[2:08:53] tonight, Father. May our lives reflect
[2:08:56] the father's drama. May the music, may
[2:09:00] the symphony, may the sympathy that's
[2:09:03] going to introduce some great person.
[2:09:06] And we know there's no great people
[2:09:08] among us. The only great one is our
[2:09:10] husband that's coming to take us away.
[2:09:14] Oh Jesus, we worship you, Lord. We
[2:09:17] praise you tonight, Father. Bless your
[2:09:20] holy name, Lord.
[2:09:22] Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you
[2:09:25] tonight, Father God. May the angels of
[2:09:28] God, I don't have to pray that they'll
[2:09:31] come near because they're already here.
[2:09:34] They're already here among us. Your
[2:09:36] prophet said, "They don't come and go,
[2:09:38] but they can't near us all the time."
[2:09:42] They were with them on their job today.
[2:09:44] They were with the housewives at home
[2:09:46] when they fixing supper. They were with
[2:09:48] the brothers as they was driving home
[2:09:50] from work. they was witnesses was coming
[2:09:53] to the house of God. Then Lord, why
[2:09:55] would it be unusual for us to believe
[2:09:57] the angels of the Lord are right here in
[2:10:00] this service tonight? The prophet said
[2:10:02] it over and over again. May they take
[2:10:04] their positions there in the pews and
[2:10:06] down the aisles by the saints of God.
[2:10:09] Oh, surely them fallen angels are here,
[2:10:11] too. But we ain't hard even going to
[2:10:13] recognize they're even here. We're going
[2:10:15] to say we're under the influence of the
[2:10:17] angels of God. Oh, Father, for your
[2:10:20] saints that are down or weak or sick,
[2:10:22] whatever it is, may the angels of the
[2:10:25] Lord. Hallelujah. May they minister,
[2:10:28] Lord. I've ministered the word and done
[2:10:30] the best that I can in my limited
[2:10:32] ability. But now, Father, we're praying
[2:10:35] as your prophet messenger did over and
[2:10:37] over again. And he prayed that the
[2:10:39] angels would be able to minister to the
[2:10:42] needs of your children. granted tonight.
[2:10:44] Father, for the sick, we pray in the
[2:10:46] name of Jesus. May the angels of God
[2:10:49] drop that pulsation of faith to know the
[2:10:52] work has already been done. They're
[2:10:53] already healed. And if you were here
[2:10:56] yourself tonight, you couldn't heal
[2:10:57] them. It's already done. Maybe there's
[2:11:00] some that's weak, some that's weary,
[2:11:02] maybe they're feeling similar. No, no,
[2:11:05] let me restate that. They couldn't feel
[2:11:06] the way you felt in the Garden of
[2:11:08] Gethsemane. You were left. you were
[2:11:10] forsaken by God and by the angels we'll
[2:11:13] never be that low. But maybe to them may
[2:11:16] they think in their mind that they're
[2:11:17] that low. But heavenly father, oh we're
[2:11:20] so grateful that whenever you were at
[2:11:21] that spot you the angels of God come and
[2:11:24] minister to you what? Power to knock
[2:11:27] them devils out. Power to evade the
[2:11:29] cross. Power to accept the cross and
[2:11:32] embrace it. Then Lord God I pray in the
[2:11:35] name of Jesus strengthen your people
[2:11:36] tonight Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] Minister to us tonight, Lord Jesus. Our
[2:11:42] needs are great, but our God is greater.
[2:11:45] Our requests are many, but your power is
[2:11:48] multiple, multiple, multiple times
[2:11:51] beyond anything we could even ask or
[2:11:53] even think. Lord, we worship you
[2:11:56] tonight, Jesus.
[2:11:58] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:02] Sing something, Harry. Let's Let's just
[2:12:04] worship him, can we?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus.
[2:12:09] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:12:12] Jesus. Now, if the angels of God were
[2:12:16] told to worship him, and I believe
[2:12:18] tonight, if the voice of God would ring
[2:12:21] back down to us, what would he tell us?
[2:12:24] Worship him.
[2:12:26] Worship him.
[2:12:29] Bless his name. Praise his name. Whether
[2:12:32] there are two or three gathered together
[2:12:36] in my name, I am in their midst. And if
[2:12:39] he's here, he's here to heal. He's here
[2:12:41] to save. He's here to fill with the Holy
[2:12:43] Ghost. He's here to strengthen. He's
[2:12:45] here to encourage.
[2:12:48] Let's worship him.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Let's worship him.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, we bless your name, Father.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; We worship you tonight, Lord Jesus. We
[2:13:00] don't worship you as a lesser creature.
[2:13:03] We don't worship you as a lesser God. We
[2:13:06] worship you as the first, the last, the
[2:13:09] alpha, the omega. We're so grateful
[2:13:11] tonight that we can see it, Lord.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; We can see it. You created yourself
[2:13:18] in a human form. Not another being,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; not a creation apart from yourself, but
[2:13:25] yourself in created form.
[2:13:28] But you had to make the mystery known to
[2:13:31] the angels
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; or they wouldn't have worshiped you in
[2:13:34] their created form would just be
[2:13:37] illuminated. Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God, that's the way I was and as a
[2:13:42] trinitarian.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'd worship the father. I'd worship the
[2:13:46] son. I'd worship the holy ghost.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; But thank you for opening my eyes and
[2:13:51] helping me to see these three are truly
[2:13:55] one. We worship you tonight, oh Lord
[2:13:58] God.
[2:14:00] Hallelujah, Jesus. Oh, let's sing it
[2:14:03] together, saints, with all of our
[2:14:05] hearts. Raise your hands. Close your
[2:14:07] eyes. I'll let you go just just in a
[2:14:09] bit.

[2:18:52] Jessica, Lord willing, are leaving on

[2:19:05] that appreciate their prayers tonight.
[2:19:07] Brother Daryl physically and also for
[2:19:09] the trip there, God's grace. Can we pray
[2:19:13] for them together as we just before we
[2:19:15] go?
[2:19:17] Heavenly Father, we pray for our brother
[2:19:19] and our sisters as they depart this
[2:19:23] Saturday, Lord, on this long trip. You
[2:19:26] see, Father, what a journey that it is.
[2:19:28] And I just pray for them, Lord, that
[2:19:31] you'd give them strength and that you'd
[2:19:33] help them. You see, Father, that brother
[2:19:36] Daryl just moved a just a tub thing this
[2:19:40] week and just reached around and pulled
[2:19:43] it and Lord pulled something in his back
[2:19:45] and had to text me, Lord. And reaching
[2:19:48] out for prayer to myself and to others.
[2:19:51] Dear God, just hurting him so bad. Lord
[2:19:54] Jesus, we believe the angels of God are
[2:19:57] here tonight. Father, would you just
[2:19:59] touch our brother? Lord God, in the name
[2:20:02] of Jesus, my brothers have their hands
[2:20:04] laid over on his body. You suffered
[2:20:07] stripes in your back so brother Daryl
[2:20:10] could be healed in his. Father, we pray
[2:20:13] for him. May you go before them. May the
[2:20:15] angels of God go before them. Lord God,
[2:20:18] in this country out in the middle of
[2:20:20] nowhere down in the ocean, but yet Lord
[2:20:23] God, you got some seed down yonder. May
[2:20:26] the presence of God come among them in a
[2:20:28] mighty way. Anoint our brother like
[2:20:31] never before. May the presence of God
[2:20:34] come and visit them, Father. Give them
[2:20:36] fruit for their labor. We pray. We love
[2:20:39] you, Lord Jesus. We praise you tonight,
[2:20:42] Father. With all of our hearts, we
