[30:35] [Applause]
[30:45] you know I was listening to brother
[30:49] Chuck song and he was singing and I got
[30:55] to thinking about way back in December
[30:58] the 21st 1981 there's on a Sunday
[31:07] afternoon around two o'clock in an old
[31:10] antique store in Jonesboro Tennessee I
[31:15] was listening to those words and I just
[31:17] got to remembering that day they're not
[31:24] before and then I look late doing things
[31:32] I shouldn't be doing that Sunday
[31:38] afternoon I was there by myself and the
[31:44] spirit of Lord came upon me I knew it
[31:48] was him because I felt him when I was a
[31:51] boy the Lord spoke to me that afternoon
[31:56] it wasn't an audible voice but it was
[31:58] just as real as my voice said if you go
[32:02] out that door I'll never call you again
[32:06] there I knelt on the floor that Oh
[32:08] antique store by myself hadn't been to
[32:10] church in years that gave my heart to
[32:14] the Lord Jesus but I told the Lord that
[32:19] I would go wherever he would leave me
[32:22] that I've tried to keep that promise
[32:26] I used to come in from meetings
[32:30] sometimes I'd be tired and get weary I
[32:33] used to drive down by that old store
[32:36] pull into the parking lot and sit
[32:38] because that was where I was born and I
[32:42] would set I remember that day and a few
[32:46] year ago I got busy it's been a while I
[32:48] thought I think I'll go by the old
[32:50] birthplace that drove down there and it
[32:55] was gone
[32:57] big supermarket was there with a big old
[33:00] paved parking lot and I don't mind to
[33:02] tell you hurt my feelings just a little
[33:05] bit but then I thought that's right they
[33:09] can tear down the building they can pave
[33:12] the parking lot but they can never take
[33:14] that experience out of my heart the day
[33:18] that the Lord Jesus saved me
[33:21] [Applause]
[33:25] [Music]
[33:27] do you remember that day that he done
[33:30] that for you we could spend all night
[33:33] and just take turns and telling and they
[33:36] were singing about that the touch and I
[33:39] was just thinking of when I was in New
[33:41] Mexico and my back had went out old me I
[33:46] tell you when you hurt that bad there's
[33:49] only one place you want to be that's at
[33:51] home but I was so far from home I
[33:54] thought how can I even get home I can't
[33:55] even get on an airplane and I went to
[33:59] that meet the sister Cindy hunting
[34:01] brother David was in that meeting it was
[34:04] all I could do to get to the pulpit I
[34:06] was hurting so every step was paid to
[34:08] shooting down my legs and this hip was
[34:12] like four inches higher than my other
[34:14] one it was just waked up like this in
[34:16] the air and I went to that pulpit and I
[34:20] turned around and brother Chuck made me
[34:22] think about it when he's talking about
[34:24] I felt his hand and that's the way it
[34:27] was I was standing there and I thought
[34:29] the song leader had come up and put his
[34:32] hand on my back because my mic wasn't on
[34:34] or something and so I just felt this
[34:36] hand touched me on the back and I turned
[34:38] to see who it was there was nobody there
[34:40] and I thought that's strange
[34:42] then all there was she was just like
[34:44] Warhol God it was just like warm water I
[34:47] just run down the legs and the pain was
[34:50] gone
[34:58] [Music]
[35:01] what a mighty God we serve tonight do
[35:05] you love him
[35:06] amen if you have your Bible sir with us
[35:08] to the Book of Luke we want to read from
[35:10] Luke chapter 1 and you know I've just
[35:14] kind of put some things together thank
[35:17] you brother
[35:18] I put some things together that we've
[35:20] been looking at for the last few months
[35:22] and so maybe some of this you're going
[35:24] to hear you've heard it before and I
[35:26] trust it won't bother you to hear it
[35:28] again but we just want to put some of
[35:29] these things together and and bring a
[35:31] few thoughts out of it and we trust it
[35:33] to be a blessing to you but we want to
[35:35] read from Luke chapter 1 verse 30 and
[35:37] this is like I said just a kind of a
[35:39] compliation of some of the things we've
[35:41] been looking at in the last few months
[35:44] on the field Luke chapter 1 verse 30 and
[35:48] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[35:52] for thou has found favor with God
[35:56] a man we can say amen to that
[36:00] the house found favor with God and
[36:03] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[36:05] and bring forth the son and shall call
[36:08] his name Jesus and he shall be great and
[36:12] he shall be called the son of the
[36:14] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[36:16] him the throne of his father David and
[36:19] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[36:22] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[36:25] be no end that's the kingdom I want to
[36:28] belong to then said Mary unto the angel
[36:32] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[36:36] man the angel answered and said unto her
[36:39] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[36:42] we know what that is can you say Amanda
[36:44] there the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[36:46] thee and the power of the highest shall
[36:48] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[36:51] thing which shall be boarded thee shall
[36:53] be called the Son of God and behold our
[36:56] cousin Elizabeth Elizabeth she hath also
[36:58] conceived a son in her old age and this
[37:01] is the six month with her who
[37:02] is called barren for with God nothing
[37:05] shall be impossible and Mary said Behold
[37:10] the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[37:14] according to thy word not the emotion
[37:20] not sensation not feelings not
[37:22] goosebumps but according to thy word
[37:28] heavens and earth shall pass away yet
[37:30] the world of God shall never failed amen
[37:35] be it unto me according to thy word and
[37:37] the angel departed from her amen
[37:42] you know why the angel left because she
[37:44] received his message and he accomplished
[37:48] what he was sent to do Thank You Laura
[37:53] let's bow our heads I want to speak to
[37:56] you for a few minutes this evening on it
[37:58] was me it was me
[38:02] Heavenly Father thank you lord thank you
[38:10] for that old building down to Jonesboro
[38:14] thank you Lord for this place here on
[38:17] the hillside and I came here when I was
[38:20] a little boy and my feet wouldn't touch
[38:22] the floor
[38:23] there are the old Happy Valley Lord
[38:26] I remember the day the message came and
[38:29] broke father on Sunday morning to the
[38:31] congregation that we thank you for these
[38:37] wonderful memories of your presence that
[38:39] has been with us and Lord I'm so glad
[38:44] that we don't just have memories but we
[38:48] believe right now today you're doing the
[38:50] same thing you've always done and we
[38:54] believe Lord if there isn't tomorrow you
[38:57] will continue for you're the same
[38:59] yesterday today and forever
[39:02] Lord bless the children tonight father
[39:05] thank you for the wonderful testimonies
[39:07] of the healers that continue to come in
[39:09] father's for Lord we believe
[39:12] this is the hour of the manifestation of
[39:15] the sons of God Lord we believe they'll
[39:18] be more and more in our faith we'll race
[39:21] higher and higher until our very bodies
[39:24] will change Lord father we were looking
[39:27] for that rapture we believe in lanes
[39:30] just ahead bless your children do not
[39:32] father Lord may you just come as we
[39:35] surrender ourselves to you and speak to
[39:37] the hearts of your people that Lord will
[39:39] be careful to give you the praise and
[39:40] the honor and the glory blessed brother
[39:42] Donny Lord breast brother David denied
[39:44] different ones Lord preached and
[39:46] different places father just bless them
[39:48] father and be with them we pray but we
[39:50] ask these things in Jesus name and the
[39:52] bride says Amen god bless you you make
[39:55] me sheet it now I found this quote and I
[39:58] thought it was interesting the way
[39:59] brother Branham said this he said now
[40:02] when Israel began to cry for their
[40:04] deliverance and God began to hear and
[40:10] when they began to cry then God begin to
[40:12] hear and he provided a way of escape he
[40:18] sent Moses to them now Moses came as a
[40:23] direct result of their crying for
[40:26] deliverance they cried for deliverance
[40:29] God heard them and he sent Moses because
[40:32] they cried for deliverance and he said
[40:35] this is the point I want you to
[40:37] understand he said how strange it was
[40:39] that after crying for deliverance and
[40:44] when deliverance was brought to them
[40:47] they failed to recognize it and refused
[40:52] it and had to suffer 40 years more so we
[41:01] see the consequences of failing to
[41:04] recognize your hour your day and the
[41:07] word for your day because they failed to
[41:10] recognize the direct result of their
[41:13] crying for deliverance God answered the
[41:15] cry and the deliverer but they
[41:18] failed to recognize it and 40 more years
[41:21] it was 40 more years before they
[41:24] realized the delivers that they had salt
[41:27] had been with them the hotel so here's
[41:33] what I tried to get you to see is that
[41:35] there is the consequences of failing to
[41:38] recognize what God is doing for you then
[41:42] if that's true if we fail to recognize
[41:45] that God's doing something for us and we
[41:47] fail to recognize it and that would be a
[41:49] consequences then what would it be if
[41:52] God was to do something for us and we
[41:54] wants to recognize it's me do you see
[41:59] what I'm saying tonight because you see
[42:02] I want you to understand that no matter
[42:04] how great the revelation is about how
[42:07] rich the anointing would be no matter
[42:10] how great the gift would be that God
[42:13] would send to you if you don't recognize
[42:16] that it's for you it will do you no good
[42:22] for God had sent this to Israel and yet
[42:25] they failed to recognize it so they got
[42:28] no benefits all they got was 40 more
[42:30] years so about how rich the anointing is
[42:34] know how great the promise is for the
[42:36] hour in which were living in and the
[42:38] anointing that's released by the opening
[42:40] of the word to pour out the blessings of
[42:42] God if we don't recognize it if we don't
[42:47] realize it it's me the word is speaking
[42:50] to me it'll do us no good
[42:56] you see we're living in the days when
[43:00] identification is required it's required
[43:04] it's not well I don't have any but
[43:06] that'll be okay no we're living in the
[43:08] day if you don't have the identification
[43:10] you ain't getting no no airplane so
[43:13] we're living in an hour you must help
[43:16] identification I remember a few year ago
[43:20] out in Arizona and I was standing over
[43:22] two priests and the girls that been out
[43:24] there with me and they were flying back
[43:25] on Saturday and so I was going to preach
[43:28] for brother on Peterson on Sunday and
[43:30] fly home on Monday and so I took
[43:32] sterling the girls to the airport and I
[43:34] just that we was using their passports
[43:36] for our IDs it's one of the best studies
[43:38] you can have it so we had took our
[43:39] passports with us and so we were running
[43:42] a little bit late because I've got girls
[43:48] I told the brother one time I was
[43:51] preaching at our cuz I said Moses got
[43:53] two million people out of Egypt I can't
[43:55] get three women have a hotel Ruby so
[44:04] anyway we was running late I saw just
[44:05] y'all pray for me huh I'll hear about
[44:08] that but anyway we grabbed the passport
[44:11] so when we got to the airport guess what
[44:13] I had searles I had Allison's and I had
[44:17] mine know Jessica's and so we was trying
[44:21] to go through her person trying to go
[44:23] through Searles first to try to find
[44:25] some identification so that Jessica can
[44:28] say it's me this ticket belongs to me
[44:31] it's my ticket here's the proof this is
[44:34] Who I am
[44:38] so then we see then that we're living in
[44:41] an hour of identification but not only
[44:43] is that in the natural but it's in the
[44:45] spiritual we must have a scriptural
[44:47] spiritual identification now if we are
[44:51] the bride of Jesus Christ and here's the
[44:53] word that his bride must also be the
[44:55] word then the only true identification
[44:57] that we can ever have it would have to
[44:59] be a word
[45:00] based identification but there's the
[45:05] word body there must be a word frame for
[45:08] that body of cinema so then we
[45:12] understand our true identification it's
[45:16] not our birth parent our true
[45:18] identification it's not our genetics
[45:20] that we can trace back to a natural
[45:22] lineage but our true identification of
[45:25] who we really are
[45:26] there's only one place you'll ever find
[45:28] that that's in the Word of God so that
[45:32] we can look into the Word of God and
[45:34] find out most assuredly who we are that
[45:40] we can look into the word and say it's
[45:44] me you see the Prophet preached the
[45:49] message perfect faith and he said in the
[45:52] message perfect faith he said now faith
[45:54] is based on forgiveness before you can
[46:00] ever have faith in the word you must
[46:04] first believe that the word is for you
[46:08] you see your individual revival is when
[46:12] you realize or you recognize the word is
[46:16] speaking to you now let me say that
[46:20] again your personal revival it's when
[46:23] you come to the understanding that what
[46:26] you're reading and the word it's not
[46:28] just talking about brother Donnie it's
[46:30] not just talking about brother Branham
[46:32] it's not just talking about brother
[46:33] Bisco it's talking about you
[46:37] that will stir something in your heart
[46:40] when you realize it's me a man you see
[46:47] because why it's Christ in His Church
[46:50] reconciling the people to God he may had
[46:53] he promised he would do it it's written
[46:55] and he's the same yesterday today and
[46:57] forever he said do you believe that in
[46:59] the congregation says a man Abram said I
[47:01] believe it with all my heart he's just
[47:04] waiting now listen to this quote he's
[47:06] just waiting now to be called on the
[47:10] scene the only thing that can call him
[47:13] on the scene the only thing that can
[47:16] call him on the scene is for us to
[47:19] awaken him in ourselves to awaken the
[47:27] Christ that's in you that's the only way
[47:31] I can call him on the scene is to awaken
[47:35] the word that's in me that's a quote
[47:40] that's what the Prophet says the only
[47:42] way not a fast room not a vast sound
[47:47] nada congregationally though those
[47:50] things are fine they're needful they've
[47:51] got their place but it goes back to the
[47:55] word everything must go back to the
[47:57] foundation of the world it's for us to
[48:03] awaken him could it be that he's
[48:06] sleeping in me I've let him go to sleep
[48:09] because of that my problems get bigger
[48:11] than my Christ
[48:13] I've left my store and get bigger than
[48:15] my boat come on somebody
[48:18] we must awaken him in ourselves to call
[48:21] him on the scene now remember you know
[48:23] you've heard this before you've heard
[48:25] many people preach it but brother better
[48:26] talked about the Welsh revival and I'll
[48:29] a bunch of men went to the United States
[48:30] to go over to see that revival and they
[48:34] were walking around they didn't know
[48:35] where it was at and they saw the
[48:36] policeman now why did they go to that
[48:39] policeman I want you to notice they did
[48:41] not go to him because he was a policeman
[48:44] though you think it would be if they
[48:46] wanted
[48:46] directions they would go to a policeman
[48:48] but they didn't go to him because he was
[48:50] a policeman they went to him because he
[48:53] was whistling at him big difference they
[49:00] whipped him because they heard him
[49:02] whistling Amazing Grace or down at the
[49:05] cross or an old gospel hymn and they go
[49:08] up to him and said sir we came all the
[49:10] way from America we're so excited to see
[49:13] this revival can you tell us sir
[49:15] where is this revival being hilt he
[49:19] never said go two blocks to the gas
[49:21] station make a ride you turn left at
[49:23] that corner you'll find the librarians
[49:25] behind it
[49:28] he never said plug this into your Google
[49:30] Maps he never gave him an address but
[49:33] you know what he said he took his billy
[49:34] stick and he packed it on his chest and
[49:37] he said you're looking at it he want to
[49:42] find the Welsh revival you're ever I'm
[49:44] it's me
[49:47] I else remember if we can only
[49:55] understand if we can only grab that in
[49:58] the reality that the Prophet gave it to
[50:00] us that we we are the reflection of
[50:05] Jesus Christ we are the reflection of
[50:08] Jesus Christ His Word made manifest
[50:13] you are the reflection of his word where
[50:20] is the West revival sir what building is
[50:23] it in it's me it's me sir it's in the
[50:30] heart
[50:32] he was the river and today the church
[50:40] optimi Jesus Christ in action
[50:43] not just a bunch of closers not just a
[50:48] bunch of quoters smaller than a pitcher
[50:50] more than a belt buckle more than a
[50:52] Malakai for license plate though there's
[50:54] nothing wrong with that
[50:56] but more than just doctor turn to Jesus
[50:59] class today
[51:00] not just a bunch of colors but the
[51:02] living word living in the people you see
[51:06] God don't need my ability doc don't need
[51:08] my education
[51:09] Oh God needs is my skin hallelujah God
[51:13] wants me to die to myself that he can
[51:16] connotes if he himself did to me how God
[51:24] was important to Christ but they don't
[51:26] stop there how Christ was important to
[51:29] his church then we should be the
[51:31] manifestation of the life of Jesus
[51:34] Christ in action today not Sunday today
[51:44] what do you say brother Daryl this the
[51:47] branch writing another book of Acts
[51:52] that's what we ought to be because he
[51:54] said if that vine ever puts forth
[51:57] another branch they will write another
[51:58] book of Acts behind and he said that
[52:01] would be in the hour with Hosea saying
[52:03] the immorality of the women and seven
[52:05] women would grab a hold of every man's
[52:07] coat down below there will be the branch
[52:10] of the Lord and God said it will be
[52:12] beautiful this day yes our hallelujah by
[52:19] revelation we stand tonight not my
[52:22] arrogance but in the humility of the
[52:24] Spirit in the decency of holiness we say
[52:27] it's me he was so full of the Welsh
[52:36] revival he was the richest level and we
[52:40] ought to be so full of Christ to reflect
[52:42] him in the power of his word that's
[52:45] allotted for us this day man worried
[52:53] about the soup stairs don't worry about
[52:54] all the Facebook don't worry about all
[52:56] that stuff that always wouldn't be there
[52:57] that opposition was that when he was
[52:59] here and it'll be here when we're here
[53:03] amen
[53:04] they think they want us gone they think
[53:07] we're the problem with America but I
[53:10] promise you when we leave there would to
[53:13] God we was back
[53:15] you just remember that you just remember
[53:19] that the only thing holding this nation
[53:21] together right now it ain't the
[53:22] Democrats or the Republicans but working
[53:24] for the same guy come on somebody the
[53:26] only thing holding this nation together
[53:27] right now is you you can stand there and
[53:30] say it's me ichy aye sir that's why this
[53:33] nation is still clothing because God's
[53:36] still using us to get the word out but
[53:40] when that last seat comes yet God will
[53:42] close the book a man and we'll take our
[53:44] journey where the God about to get
[53:51] excited man
[53:57] we're supposed to be the light of this
[53:59] age you believe that the Bible said he'd
[54:02] even the time there shall be light who
[54:04] is it it's me so you arrogant no I'm not
[54:11] hurting I'm not being arrogant I'm not
[54:12] even saying that a girly God knows I'm
[54:14] not but I've said it by revelation I'm
[54:17] saying it by faith if Wesley was the
[54:22] light of his day and Luther was a lot of
[54:24] his day and Pentecost with the
[54:25] restoration against what's the line of
[54:27] their day whose light is it now remember
[54:36] said word the further up the road now
[54:38] we're coming into the bride the called
[54:40] out the elected the bride the call out
[54:43] elected to remember if you are you're
[54:48] just like that officer if you're the
[54:50] bride if you're the called out if you
[54:52] are the elect if you are if that's who
[54:55] you are then you're just like that
[54:58] officer you can say it's in me
[55:05] where's the bride's revival you're
[55:08] looking at you see the bride's revival
[55:16] is the opening of the word and the
[55:19] opening of the word when that seals are
[55:21] loose and the word comes open the
[55:23] prophet of God said the full Word of God
[55:25] was born into manifestation then that
[55:28] makes it exactly like it was with Jesus
[55:30] was on the earth he was the fullness of
[55:32] the word and then the bride hallelujah
[55:34] is expressing the fullness of his words
[55:38] pain making him the same right now for
[55:42] somebody come through the back door
[55:44] they're not dragging across with the
[55:45] white road people would scream but
[55:47] that's not Jesus he never said he would
[55:49] come like that he's already done that
[55:53] you said you want to see me you must see
[55:55] me in my bride that's where I'll be
[56:01] man the open of the word it stirs her
[56:03] not only you see who brother Branham is
[56:05] we see who we are we see our position we
[56:10] see our our we see that I'm not just
[56:12] part of the move I am the move
[56:19] she is the move come over me you see she
[56:27] catches the revelation and see the class
[56:33] it's me
[56:36] [Music]
[56:40] so she said whose scarlet threads out
[56:42] hanging in the window
[56:43] Rahab said it's me you see the senator
[56:51] changes it's God dealing with the church
[56:55] this is the last stage can you say amen
[56:58] to that
[56:58] then whatever God's gonna do he must do
[57:01] now when the church age ends it's the
[57:07] fullness of the Gentiles dispensation
[57:09] when the truck changes are over he will
[57:11] never call another Gentile those who are
[57:14] filthy will be filthy still those who
[57:16] are righteous will be righteous still
[57:18] we're not the consummation of the church
[57:20] changes then if God's gonna do something
[57:22] in this hour
[57:23] he must do it with us little brother doe
[57:31] my son he's the Church of tomorrow no I
[57:33] beg your pardon he is not the Church of
[57:35] the morrow these young boys sitting
[57:36] right here on the Pew they are not the
[57:38] Church of tomorrow will they maybe if
[57:39] there is no tomorrow but throw the
[57:41] Church of right now we have no promise
[57:44] of tomorrow this is our our this is our
[57:46] time
[57:52] we see the thing of it is so so many
[57:54] people are lacking we can be such legal
[57:58] eagles and I do know there's a standard
[58:01] of holiness do not misunderstand me and
[58:04] it's a shame we've let it slip there's a
[58:07] standard of decent dressing in standard
[58:09] of the way men should dress and apt and
[58:11] we've let it slip but that's another
[58:13] message for another time but you see the
[58:17] key of it is the key it is it's not to
[58:20] live this message by ruler but the key
[58:22] of it is is just fall in love with Jesus
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:32] not just see how much with the cano
[58:34] though we should study not just see how
[58:36] much we can quote though we should be
[58:38] able to quote it but the key of it is is
[58:43] how much can we love you see if you love
[58:48] right everything else will fall into
[58:52] place
[58:53] because love produces confidence and
[58:56] confidence produces trust the Bible says
[59:01] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[59:03] the Word of God when you trust in what
[59:07] the word is saying to you Oh God when
[59:13] you've got confidence that the word is
[59:16] speaking to you and what it's saying to
[59:18] you is true you see where there's a lack
[59:24] of desire to forgive you find there's a
[59:27] lack of love
[59:29] people do things that say things to one
[59:32] another and they have no remorse because
[59:35] they have no love and because there's no
[59:42] love there's no forgiveness and then you
[59:47] find where there's no forgiveness there
[59:50] is no faith because faith is based on
[59:54] forgiveness the Prophet said in the last
[59:59] days that the love would be so far away
[1:00:02] that the only love you'll find will be
[1:00:05] among the elect that's the only love
[1:00:09] that would be left will be among the
[1:00:12] elect as the song says they will know
[1:00:16] they will know that we are Christians
[1:00:19] not by belt buckle but by tonight those
[1:00:26] who despitefully use you to love those
[1:00:29] who kill you if they had the opportunity
[1:00:36] we need work I need work especially when
[1:00:42] you drive down Tennessee Highway i-40
[1:00:45] you realize you need work but we're
[1:00:51] gonna get there because he said we would
[1:00:56] see faith is based on forgiveness where
[1:00:59] there is love there is forgiveness Jesus
[1:01:04] expressed that so well on the cross when
[1:01:07] they had beat him until he had been
[1:01:09] beaten more than any man has faced the
[1:01:11] Bible said was Lord more they need him
[1:01:13] in facing them had been more his head
[1:01:15] was plastic normal size his eyes were
[1:01:17] swollen shut every time he spoke blood
[1:01:20] splattered out of his mouth he was
[1:01:22] bleeding out of his mouth bleeding out
[1:01:24] of his face bleeding out of his body
[1:01:25] bleeding out his everywhere in blood was
[1:01:28] he said I am poured out like water and
[1:01:30] they hung him there on that cross and no
[1:01:32] doubt the Flies were blowing on the
[1:01:33] blood as it was drying on his body but
[1:01:36] he looked upon those with duit oh god
[1:01:39] think of it he looked upon those who had
[1:01:41] beat him like that
[1:01:43] say I'd beat him unmercifully that Jesus
[1:01:45] looked at them with what little vision
[1:01:48] he had through his swollen eyes he
[1:01:50] pushed upon the cross in you all he said
[1:01:52] Father forgive to him why did he say
[1:01:57] that because he loves them look at
[1:02:08] Joseph his brothers threw him in a pit
[1:02:11] sewed him into slavery look at all he
[1:02:14] endured and when they got caught up with
[1:02:17] myself oh god Joseph is gonna kill us
[1:02:19] now this is it we're gonna who are gonna
[1:02:21] get paid back he's gonna make us pay
[1:02:22] back he's got that hot position now he
[1:02:24] has the authority he didn't really stick
[1:02:26] it to us they just knew they was gonna
[1:02:27] have it and Joseph dismissed his wife
[1:02:29] and there he stood with his brothers and
[1:02:31] said this is it it's gonna be swift it's
[1:02:33] gonna be just but you know what he said
[1:02:35] he looked at them and he forgave them
[1:02:37] because he loved them the Bible says
[1:02:45] well I was yet a sinner Christ died for
[1:02:49] me he was down in the muck the mess of
[1:02:55] my life and he lifted me up he loved me
[1:03:00] when I was unlovable
[1:03:02] he forgave me when I shut up and I
[1:03:05] forget the bonds
[1:03:10] he passed over millions to bring this
[1:03:14] message to you
[1:03:18] because he loves you see if he loved me
[1:03:25] enough to die for us if he loved us
[1:03:29] enough to die for us my brother my
[1:03:32] sister he loved us enough to heal us he
[1:03:37] loved us enough to lead us he loved us
[1:03:40] enough to rapture us real genuine love
[1:03:45] produces confidence that he's forgiven
[1:03:47] us he has forgiven me Oh God spotted my
[1:03:52] mistakes it's part of my failures he
[1:03:57] loved me you mean back there way back
[1:03:59] there and not indecent remaining one no
[1:04:01] I'm talking about this week just like
[1:04:03] you when we stopped our when we messed
[1:04:07] up yeah he loves us anyhow and that
[1:04:12] produces faith if he loves me enough to
[1:04:14] forgive me he'll take care of me then I
[1:04:16] can have confidence I can have faith in
[1:04:18] what the word says I am by the blood of
[1:04:22] Jesus that's it friends it's not what I
[1:04:24] can do myself that's what he's done for
[1:04:26] me hallelujah like that little chicken
[1:04:34] you think bream just told those stories
[1:04:36] to be telling them they had meanings
[1:04:38] that little chicken child I mean that
[1:04:40] little Eagle he tried his best to be a
[1:04:42] chicken he tried to walk like them cluck
[1:04:44] like him
[1:04:44] roost like him he tried his best
[1:04:50] they said you're the funniest looking
[1:04:51] chicken ever seen this I don't care if
[1:04:53] I'm funny or not I'm still a chicken
[1:04:55] cockadoodledoo or whatever you know but
[1:04:59] one day was out there in the middle of
[1:05:00] that barnyard and Mama remembered she
[1:05:02] had junior I've got one down there
[1:05:05] somewhere and she flew over the barnyard
[1:05:07] when she begin to fly and she let out
[1:05:09] the scream of an eagle everything that
[1:05:11] wasn't an eagle ran but why did you do
[1:05:14] something about the deep begin to call
[1:05:16] under the deep
[1:05:17] and junior didn't run he began to look
[1:05:19] up and we begin to look up he saw the
[1:05:22] head he saw the wings he saw the feet
[1:05:25] then he looked at himself and he looked
[1:05:27] up and he looked at himself when he
[1:05:29] looked up and he said that's me that's
[1:05:32] me that's Lyle not the son of Mary Jo
[1:05:45] and James Oberg Ward I'm an attribute of
[1:05:49] gold
[1:05:52] you see Jesus had perfect faith because
[1:05:57] he relied on what he was he knew he was
[1:06:01] loved by the father he relied and
[1:06:03] knowing he was the word and he had faith
[1:06:06] in the God who made him the word he knew
[1:06:11] what he was there for he relied upon
[1:06:15] what God made him now think about that
[1:06:22] for me don't just leave that with Jesus
[1:06:24] but just bring it down into yourself
[1:06:26] just a little bit and let these words
[1:06:27] become your words he knew what he was
[1:06:31] there for he realized about what God
[1:06:33] made him what did God make us believers
[1:06:38] the bride of Jesus Christ I didn't make
[1:06:42] myself that he chose me that's what he
[1:06:47] made me he predestinated made a dig at
[1:06:50] you he relied upon what God had made you
[1:06:55] he recognized listen to these four
[1:06:57] quotes what we're been said about Jesus
[1:06:58] and it's perfect faith he relied he
[1:07:02] relied upon what God had made you he
[1:07:06] recognized himself in the written word
[1:07:09] now he win it as the temple on the
[1:07:12] seventh day as it was this custom and
[1:07:13] the priests hitting the book and he
[1:07:15] turned over to the Book of Isaiah and he
[1:07:16] said the spear the Lord is upon me
[1:07:18] because he's anointed me to preach the
[1:07:19] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:07:21] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:07:23] deliverance to the captives recovery of
[1:07:25] sight to the blind to set at liberty
[1:07:27] Bruce he hath anointed me to do these
[1:07:31] things to preach acceptable year of the
[1:07:33] Lord and he closed the book because the
[1:07:36] rest of that verse belongs to you when
[1:07:40] he would do that in the day of the bride
[1:07:43] he closed the book he handed it back to
[1:07:46] the priest and the Bible said the eyes
[1:07:48] of all the people was upon him and he
[1:07:51] began to say this day this scripture is
[1:07:53] fulfilled in your ears now if you'll
[1:07:56] allow me to translate that into
[1:07:57] hillbilly so that we can understand it
[1:08:00] because I'm a hillbilly he said this day
[1:08:03] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:08:04] but to give the translation in the
[1:08:06] hillbilly what he really said was it's
[1:08:08] me speaking of Isaiah was speaking of me
[1:08:18] this day the words of Isaiah is
[1:08:21] fulfilled here elided knowing he was the
[1:08:25] word and he had faith in the God who
[1:08:27] made him the word then if that's true
[1:08:29] for the bridegroom and the same word
[1:08:31] speaks for the bridegroom speaks for the
[1:08:32] bride then can't we rely upon what God
[1:08:35] made us as believers the word says the
[1:08:39] believers shall lay hands on the sick
[1:08:41] and they shall recover the Bible said
[1:08:44] these signs shall follow them that
[1:08:45] believe the Bible said we're believers
[1:08:48] because we believe why do you call
[1:08:56] yourself believers because we believe
[1:08:59] well why do you believe because we're
[1:09:02] believers well I know you're believers
[1:09:06] but why ID are you believers we're
[1:09:08] believers because we believe but why do
[1:09:11] you believe because we're believers
[1:09:19] that's why believers down pretty simple
[1:09:25] ad it's just simple amen
[1:09:29] hey man see he had faith in what he was
[1:09:32] Jesus said destroy this temple in three
[1:09:35] days I'll raise it up now why did he say
[1:09:38] that he said that because the word said
[1:09:41] that and he knew he was that word
[1:09:45] manifested he knew that when David said
[1:09:48] I'll not suffer my Holy One to see
[1:09:49] corruption neither I'll leave his soul
[1:09:51] in hell jesus knew David was not talking
[1:09:53] about himself because David saw
[1:09:55] corruption therefore Jesus knew that
[1:09:57] David was prophesied with him and he
[1:09:59] said it's me I am who David was
[1:10:02] prophesied of David under inspiration
[1:10:06] was speaking of the Holy One
[1:10:08] Jesus knew he was the fulfillment of
[1:10:10] that that boy said I will not see
[1:10:12] corruption led me in a tomb but I'll
[1:10:16] rise again you see he went to Calvary
[1:10:21] believing if I lay my life down the word
[1:10:24] says he'll raise me up again
[1:10:26] he went to Calvary relying on what the
[1:10:29] word said would take place he went to
[1:10:33] Calvary relying upon what the word said
[1:10:36] would take place then when we lay our
[1:10:38] hands on the sick brother West and pray
[1:10:39] for the sick it's not my responsibility
[1:10:41] to heal them the Bible said I would do
[1:10:43] that then if I do what the word says we
[1:10:46] can expect what the word says will
[1:10:47] happen and the word says we can expect
[1:10:49] that's going to be the outcome the
[1:10:51] believers shall lay their hands on the
[1:10:52] sick and they shall recover that's the
[1:10:54] outcome of the believers that's what
[1:10:56] believers do we don't have to pump it up
[1:10:58] we don't have to work it up we just lay
[1:11:00] our hands on the sick and they recover
[1:11:02] because that's what the word says
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:12] he understood his position he understood
[1:11:15] his position because he knew what the
[1:11:17] scripture said about this if he had
[1:11:19] faith in what he was because the word
[1:11:21] said he was there and he proved he was
[1:11:23] there then can't we as believers rely
[1:11:25] upon what the word says we are who God
[1:11:29] help us Lord let that quicken to us that
[1:11:33] we can recognize ourselves in the
[1:11:35] scriptures and we can look and say it's
[1:11:39] me see brother bear who told the story
[1:11:45] several different times he told the
[1:11:48] story and I've told you here before
[1:11:49] brother Donnie's brother did ever a lot
[1:11:51] of brothers has told the story about the
[1:11:53] little boy in the mirror we all remember
[1:11:57] the story but I got to looking at that
[1:11:59] story and I thought it was interesting
[1:12:01] the last three times that I found
[1:12:03] brother Benny mentioned that story now I
[1:12:05] don't think they come to brother brems
[1:12:07] said you know program I know you try to
[1:12:08] save money you try to keep your expenses
[1:12:09] low and you've been leaving about 15 20
[1:12:11] sometimes 25 minutes on the tape is
[1:12:13] there any story you could tell and take
[1:12:15] out 15 or 20 minutes of tape and then
[1:12:17] we'll only have five minutes left
[1:12:18] yeah I think I could find a story you
[1:12:20] know something I heard when I was a boy
[1:12:22] and I'll put a story on I don't believe
[1:12:23] that but I believe when he was telling
[1:12:25] these stories when he was preaching the
[1:12:26] word he was trying to get us to
[1:12:28] understand something the story of the
[1:12:30] eagle he was trying to get us to
[1:12:31] understand you're not a chicken you're
[1:12:33] Annie who you always were an eagle I
[1:12:35] didn't come to mix up a doctor not come
[1:12:37] to straighten one out to get away from
[1:12:38] this fear and scare that you don't know
[1:12:40] who you are you're not going to be you
[1:12:41] are now sons and daughters of God
[1:12:43] you always were sons and daughters of
[1:12:46] God he comes to tell that so I was
[1:12:49] looking the last three times that I
[1:12:51] found that brother Brennan told this
[1:12:53] story was 63 in a message called
[1:12:57] identification then he told it again in
[1:13:00] 64 in a message called things that are
[1:13:04] to be
[1:13:07] and then the last time that I found
[1:13:09] brother Ben I mentioned it was in 1965
[1:13:12] in a message titled leadership now you
[1:13:18] know the story the little boy goes where
[1:13:20] Ben one place he says it was his
[1:13:21] grandmother's house in another place he
[1:13:22] says it was his aunt's house I mean it
[1:13:24] goes down to the story you know the the
[1:13:26] details of the story but the meaning of
[1:13:27] the story is what we really want to
[1:13:28] understand anyhow so the boy goes down
[1:13:30] to the house he's never seen the mirror
[1:13:31] before and he kind of gets bored you
[1:13:33] know and he goes in there playing in the
[1:13:34] house and he shuts the door when he does
[1:13:35] all of a sudden that's the little boy
[1:13:39] well this you know his mom and his
[1:13:41] grandma hours and whoever it was you
[1:13:43] know they're in the house that come to
[1:13:44] see what the noise was so they were
[1:13:45] standing back and they were watching and
[1:13:48] the little boy waved at the boy and the
[1:13:50] boy way back little boy messed with his
[1:13:54] hair and the boy messed with his hair
[1:13:57] and he jumped out of the mirror and he
[1:14:00] jumped back and the boy jumped back
[1:14:05] so he made a funny face and the boy made
[1:14:10] a funny face
[1:14:11] and he got closer and closer because it
[1:14:14] attracted his attention so he began to
[1:14:16] draw closer to the mirror and he got
[1:14:18] closer and closer and he touched it and
[1:14:22] when he touched it the realization
[1:14:24] struck him and he said why mama it's me
[1:14:35] it's me and brother Ben said that's what
[1:14:38] we want to look at tonight I want you to
[1:14:40] look at me and I want you to look at
[1:14:41] yourself as we look into God's great
[1:14:44] mirror the mirror of his word let's be
[1:14:46] able to identify ourselves with son that
[1:14:49] we're going to speak about some of the
[1:14:52] characters listen to this quote some of
[1:14:54] the characters at other times I want to
[1:14:56] see myself in God's looking-glass
[1:14:59] because if anything will show you where
[1:15:02] you're standing
[1:15:03] it's this book I'm sure tonight we ought
[1:15:08] to find ourselves somewhere in some
[1:15:13] character of the Bible now listen the
[1:15:17] rest of this quote so by doing that we
[1:15:19] would know the outcome of that character
[1:15:22] and then we would know what our outcome
[1:15:25] would be no words we would be the mirror
[1:15:29] of that character if we can find
[1:15:32] ourselves in some character in the Bible
[1:15:35] and see how God dealt with them and see
[1:15:38] how God moved with them and to see their
[1:15:40] outcome then we could see what by
[1:15:49] knowing that outcome we would know our
[1:15:53] ELCA so I thought about that I thought
[1:15:57] now if that's true somewhere in the
[1:16:00] message we should be able to find that
[1:16:03] so I got to looking and I come across a
[1:16:05] very interesting thing I come across the
[1:16:08] black woman in Memphis whose boy got out
[1:16:12] of his God social disease and was dying
[1:16:14] of syphilis and he's landed on the bed
[1:16:15] and she got down to pray and she said
[1:16:18] Lord if I'd be like that shoe to my
[1:16:21] woman
[1:16:24] if I'd be like that shooter my woman
[1:16:27] then where's your prophet now she
[1:16:30] identified herself with the character in
[1:16:33] the Bible and she said if I be like her
[1:16:35] where is your prophet and so we're
[1:16:39] brother Brendan was flying and they
[1:16:41] grounded the airplane beam up in the
[1:16:43] Peabody Hotel he goes out to Miller
[1:16:45] postcard the Spirit of God says turn
[1:16:47] around start walking and he finds
[1:16:49] himself in a black neighborhood he's
[1:16:51] singing I'm one of him I'm one of them
[1:16:52] and as he passes by the gate aunt he's
[1:16:55] standing there that's what they called
[1:16:56] him in that day and he was standing
[1:16:58] there with her with her back was wet
[1:17:00] from them from the do been out there
[1:17:01] since 3 o'clock in the morning and the
[1:17:03] Prophet stops singing tipped his hat to
[1:17:05] her and said morning and she said
[1:17:09] morning parson and he said how do you
[1:17:14] know I was a preacher and she said I
[1:17:16] know she's coming now for those who
[1:17:22] preach that God tells this prophesy
[1:17:24] God's only tells his prophets and the
[1:17:26] only speech this prophets who told her
[1:17:28] that
[1:17:30] come on soba nonfat sisig where's your
[1:17:34] satchel you're supposed to have a
[1:17:36] satchel with you he said I left it in
[1:17:38] the room so who knew more about what was
[1:17:40] happening the profit or her come on
[1:17:43] somebody
[1:17:45] please she identified herself in the
[1:17:48] Bible like the pseudonym woman God said
[1:17:50] I lied you to her outcome because you
[1:17:57] know the rest of the story brother
[1:17:58] Bennett brightful he said mama
[1:18:00] let's get light in the room Oh
[1:18:04] do you love you God said in Jeremiah
[1:18:08] said I know the thoughts I think toward
[1:18:10] you says the Lord thoughts of peace and
[1:18:12] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:18:14] you see God hasn't expected in for us to
[1:18:18] bring us to our final outcome you see
[1:18:23] the Prophet said if you were in his
[1:18:25] thinking at the beginning you were in
[1:18:27] his thinking at the beginning if you've
[1:18:29] got eternal life anybody here like that
[1:18:34] deceiver how many's got eternal life
[1:18:38] then if you've got to eternal life guess
[1:18:40] where you was you was in his thinking at
[1:18:44] the beginning there's only one form of
[1:18:48] eternal life eternal life had no
[1:18:50] beginning and it has no ending so if you
[1:18:53] have eternal life your attribute of God
[1:18:57] stinking before there was anything but
[1:19:01] him
[1:19:05] and remember your eyes oh god your
[1:19:10] stature
[1:19:11] whatever you was you were in his thinkin
[1:19:14] at the beginning and the only thing that
[1:19:16] you are is the expression after he
[1:19:19] thought it he spoke it and here you are
[1:19:24] so what are you you are the food you are
[1:19:27] the spoken word thoughts of God Express
[1:19:30] for the hour that you live it in if you
[1:19:33] can catch that revelation you can say
[1:19:35] it's me if it isn't if he wasn't in his
[1:19:46] thinking there's no way at all for you
[1:19:48] to ever be there he's the one that gives
[1:19:51] eternal life and you were in his
[1:19:55] thinking your name and all and he before
[1:19:58] knowledge or danger to see this he
[1:20:00] ordained me to see this and you that was
[1:20:03] not ordained will never see it so just
[1:20:09] be kind to you'll have to argue you
[1:20:12] don't have to argue fuss get all mad on
[1:20:13] face you don't have to do that if it's
[1:20:16] not for them it's not for them you know
[1:20:21] why I don't go to chess matches because
[1:20:23] it ain't for me I couldn't have a clue
[1:20:26] who not to reward I don't know no that's
[1:20:28] the I try to play it like checkers
[1:20:33] that's true it means nothing to me
[1:20:36] so if I leave something at your house
[1:20:38] don't ever bring it to a chess mat to
[1:20:40] give it back to me because I won't be
[1:20:41] there because that ain't Who I am has
[1:20:43] nothing to do with me you understand
[1:20:45] what I'm saying that's why the case stay
[1:20:49] that's why they must go or they might
[1:20:50] hang on for awhile but it is not for
[1:20:52] them just love them just be good to them
[1:20:56] just be kind to them and thank God that
[1:21:00] your eyes can't see your hour thank you
[1:21:02] day because I tell you it's only by the
[1:21:05] grace of Almighty God

[1:21:16] Lord Jesus the hour is here
[1:21:18] would you believe him won't you give
[1:21:20] your life to Him the hours here for what
[1:21:22] brother Branham the hour is here to see
[1:21:25] this this was a previously in a mystery
[1:21:27] this was foul dust we didn't understand
[1:21:29] it but don't you understand the word has
[1:21:31] become more plainer that more plainer
[1:21:33] that more plainer why it is the hour you
[1:21:40] see the word mirror the word mirror
[1:21:43] reveals to us our word image like the
[1:21:48] little boy we say it's me that moment
[1:21:54] that moment that you recognize yourself
[1:21:58] that moment that you see yourself in the
[1:22:04] vision now think about that just a
[1:22:06] minute think about that the moment that
[1:22:08] you catch the realisation that he is
[1:22:12] talking about me when you realize that
[1:22:16] God had a dream God had a vision God had
[1:22:20] a plan whatever words you want to use
[1:22:21] God had it and when you begin to realize
[1:22:25] I am a part of God's plan he said
[1:22:33] brother is that possible do you think
[1:22:35] it's possible that someone could
[1:22:36] actually see their self in the vision is
[1:22:40] that possible could that be possible
[1:22:43] that someone could actually see a vision
[1:22:45] and see their self now think of it that
[1:22:50] God would have a dream or God would have
[1:22:53] a vision or God would have a plan and
[1:22:55] come down at the end time tear off the
[1:22:58] seals open the mysteries and reveal to
[1:23:00] you you as a part of it the whole time
[1:23:05] can you imagine that moment in time when
[1:23:09] you realize I'm a part of the vision
[1:23:15] you're the expression you're the thought
[1:23:18] that God thought you are a part of the
[1:23:22] vision now listen listen to this prayer

[1:26:59] the shirt all day long I knew it was
[1:27:02] green checker but I never thought a

[1:27:10] a shirt in his tent it was green
[1:27:12] checkered time out maybe got him a cup
[1:27:13] of coffee at the campfire before he
[1:27:15] headed out again worried all day long

[1:27:30] vision was being played out brother man
[1:27:33] suits the caribou they management 42
[1:27:36] inch horns everybody in the camp said
[1:27:37] nobody had a shirt like that brother man

[1:27:40] then but the vision will be he's anybody
[1:27:43] perhaps it'll be somewhere else he went
[1:27:44] out there he killed the caribou 40

[1:27:49] surety said why brother any and brother

[1:27:57] but that moment in time that non I said
[1:28:00] how did you feel when you realized I'm a
[1:28:06] part of the vision
[1:28:10] I'm the green checkered shirt I am the
[1:28:13] green checkered shirt that's me that's
[1:28:15] who I am I'm not the measuring tape I'm
[1:28:17] not the little boys heads that was
[1:28:19] somebody else
[1:28:19] Oh God I'm not the one that shot it that
[1:28:22] was somebody else but I am my part of
[1:28:24] the vision my part of the vision is I am
[1:28:26] that green checkered shirt you see you
[1:28:28] may never be the pastor but you've got a
[1:28:30] part of the vision you everybody's got a
[1:28:32] part they must play you've got to find
[1:28:34] yourself in the vision and you've got to
[1:28:37] say by faith it is me now let me hurry
[1:28:47] our scripture reading you know brother
[1:28:50] Brennan oh but nobody can dramatize like
[1:28:51] brother Brennan the birdramon relaying
[1:28:54] this this story I didn't I'm in a
[1:28:56] meeting now the day before this event
[1:28:59] that we read about in the scriptures
[1:29:00] took place brother Ben just talks he
[1:29:02] talks it just starts dramatizing and he
[1:29:04] said Joseph and Mary went to church that
[1:29:06] morning they were sitting on the porch
[1:29:08] Ector Sunday dinner and they was talking
[1:29:10] and Joseph said halt Mary wasn't that a
[1:29:12] wonderful service this morning and my
[1:29:14] goodness didn't that Rabbi certainly
[1:29:16] bring the Word of God to us and they
[1:29:17] were just talking you know and Mary said
[1:29:21] that because they were you know they
[1:29:22] they were to be married and me know the
[1:29:27] Prophet said Mary said you know you know
[1:29:29] Joseph dear I think it would be good if
[1:29:33] we just ran a few scriptures they said
[1:29:36] well Mary that's wonderful of you said
[1:29:38] going there and find us something to
[1:29:40] read
[1:29:41] now the prophet of God said in that day
[1:29:43] course the Bible wasn't scrolls had a
[1:29:44] scroll of Isaiah or Jeremiah they was
[1:29:46] rolled up in wood you've seen the
[1:29:48] scrolls and they had like a wasted like
[1:29:49] thing and they would just stick these
[1:29:51] scrolls down in it so you would go in
[1:29:52] there and you would pull out the scroll
[1:29:54] Jeremiah or the scroll of Isaiah and so
[1:29:56] Mary goes in there now it wasn't that
[1:29:58] chance because I believe the footsteps
[1:30:01] of a good man is ordered of the Lord she
[1:30:04] goes in there and pulls out the scroll
[1:30:06] of the prophet Isaiah and she brings it
[1:30:09] out to Joseph he opens a screw and he
[1:30:11] begins to read
[1:30:14] a virgin shall conceive and bring forth
[1:30:17] a son and they shall call his name
[1:30:19] counselor mighty God principes
[1:30:22] everlasting father and Mary was
[1:30:26] listening she was listening to that word
[1:30:30] and when he got done read and married
[1:30:33] her innocence she said Joseph what is
[1:30:36] that prophet talking about a virgin so I
[1:30:39] can see what does he mean by that
[1:30:41] and Joseph being an honest man he looked
[1:30:44] right at her and he said I don't know I
[1:30:49] don't know what the prophets talking
[1:30:52] about Mary but there's one thing I do
[1:30:53] know if God said it God is able to keep
[1:30:56] that what she said you see my brother my
[1:30:58] sister I don't have to be a lot of
[1:31:00] people on Facebook I don't have to try
[1:31:02] to figure it out I don't have to try to
[1:31:03] find a newspaper or some kind of article
[1:31:05] to Vindicator this iceberg I'm not that
[1:31:07] kind of guy I simply believe it because
[1:31:09] God said so amen that's why I believe it
[1:31:12] I don't have to understand it I don't
[1:31:14] have to figure it out I'll believe it by
[1:31:15] faith hey can you say amen to that
[1:31:20] listen to me I don't know how God opens
[1:31:22] blinding eyes oh I know there's one day
[1:31:24] just to settle my lap she couldn't see
[1:31:26] me for nothing and the next day she
[1:31:28] could see how God done it I don't know I
[1:31:31] don't know how he done it I'm just glad
[1:31:32] that he does it hey man I don't know how
[1:31:36] he got Jessie on that wheelchair I don't
[1:31:38] know one day she's in a wheelchair
[1:31:40] have no control over her body the next
[1:31:42] day she's walking on us I don't know I
[1:31:43] don't know how he done it I don't know
[1:31:47] how he made Christina's leg grow out in
[1:31:49] Romania when the guy said I watched it
[1:31:51] brother Darrell grow out in the meekness
[1:31:52] she walked out well I don't know how he
[1:31:54] done it I don't know how that woman's
[1:31:55] tumor fell off the back of her ear a
[1:31:57] parallel how a few a few weeks ago six
[1:31:59] seven months ago waves I don't know how
[1:32:00] that happened freeze I don't understand
[1:32:02] it
[1:32:03] but I don't have to understand you
[1:32:06] I just believe you know I believe
[1:32:11] because I believe I believe he's able to
[1:32:18] do anything he said he would do so the
[1:32:24] next morning Mary he goes down to wash
[1:32:26] clothes and on her way down she couldn't
[1:32:31] get that off of her mind that remark
[1:32:33] that Joseph made when he stopped at that
[1:32:35] scripture of Isaiah 9:6 he said you know
[1:32:39] Mary I always thought she was the
[1:32:40] beautifulest girl in the whole community
[1:32:43] but somehow in just the last few minutes
[1:32:46] you're more beautiful than ever who your
[1:32:50] eyes or the sparklin just when I'm
[1:32:54] mixing that scripture a virgin shall
[1:32:56] conceive it's just like you illuminated
[1:32:59] it's just like you lit up and she was
[1:33:02] thinking why why did that scripture do
[1:33:05] that to me when I heard that Scripture
[1:33:07] why did it bring that kind of response
[1:33:09] to me like we brother Donny it's taking
[1:33:20] the mysteries of God and laying them out
[1:33:22] to us and the church starts hearing
[1:33:24] those words and starts line upon line
[1:33:26] precept upon precept and the Roar begins
[1:33:28] just like last Wednesday when brother
[1:33:30] Tim was here and he began to lay out
[1:33:32] that word and lay out that's close and
[1:33:34] you begin to grab it and the roar of the
[1:33:36] people why what was he feeling the same
[1:33:39] thing she was
[1:33:41] oh you're feeling the same thing sheep
[1:33:46] that wah that word for you it's coming
[1:33:49] alive in you she saw a flicker of life
[1:33:58] the puffer God said I'm hurry now
[1:34:00] she turned another corner saw another
[1:34:01] freak love ride but the Prophet said
[1:34:03] when she got to where was just a small
[1:34:04] place where only her could pass because
[1:34:07] you see it's an individual affair it's
[1:34:10] not you and your mama you and your daddy
[1:34:11] you and your husband it's you in Christ
[1:34:13] he's revealed to you personally
[1:34:15] what his new birth Barbara's Christ
[1:34:17] revealed to you personally you've met
[1:34:18] this person yourself once God was just
[1:34:21] just her could only go through and when
[1:34:23] she got to that little narrow place well
[1:34:24] the only place she could do is look up
[1:34:26] there she met the messenger there she
[1:34:29] met the angel with that light standing
[1:34:31] around him and it startled her and he
[1:34:33] said he'll my thought highly favoured of
[1:34:38] God Oh God think of it that little woman
[1:34:45] in the meanest City there wasn't
[1:34:46] Palestine the meanest city there was can
[1:34:49] anything good come out of Nazareth Kenny
[1:34:51] thank God got out of that city we say
[1:34:56] the same thing tonight can anything good
[1:34:58] come out of Laodicea I say to you come
[1:35:01] and see come and see hey man you see she
[1:35:05] lived a good life God chose her for a
[1:35:07] certain work he was going to do that was
[1:35:10] highly favored
[1:35:11] you see God chose her she never
[1:35:13] volunteered she was chosen but forgot
[1:35:16] she she I wasn't looking for God you
[1:35:19] wasn't looking for God God came looking
[1:35:21] for us
[1:35:21] Isaiah said we shall be called the
[1:35:23] people who's known as the salt out
[1:35:24] people who sold us out he did he come
[1:35:27] looking for me
[1:35:28] he come looking for you don't you see he
[1:35:30] said all I'm gonna find us
[1:35:32] [Applause]
[1:35:35] he began to reveal to her the scriptures
[1:35:37] he begin to take the words of Isaiah and
[1:35:40] make him real to her she knew the angels
[1:35:44] message was scriptural she began to
[1:35:47] think about the porch she began to think
[1:35:49] about the scriptures she began to think
[1:35:50] about the things that she had heard just
[1:35:52] yesterday and while they angel messenger
[1:35:54] standing there vindicated by God a
[1:35:56] vindicated messenger from God telling
[1:35:59] her the revealed Word of the hour taking
[1:36:01] the words of the Prophet and tying him
[1:36:03] together and making them real to her
[1:36:05] when she was hearing those words and she
[1:36:07] began to think of what see her yesterday
[1:36:08] and she began to hear what he did on her
[1:36:11] her she knew his message was scriptural
[1:36:13] and at that moment of time she realized
[1:36:17] it's me when Isaiah wrote a virgin shall
[1:36:24] conceive he was writing about me at that
[1:36:30] moment Mary realized it's me Isaiah was
[1:36:34] speaking about me I am Who as a a saw in
[1:36:40] a vision think of that Oh God if you
[1:36:43] could only grasp that tonight just take
[1:36:45] that and bring it down to earth day it's
[1:36:47] the same thing God said to us a
[1:36:49] vindicated messenger to take the
[1:36:51] mysteries of the word what did he tell
[1:36:53] us he come to tie up the loose ends and
[1:36:55] what did he come to do show us who we
[1:37:04] average I can see think how crazy that
[1:37:06] is no matter how crazy it sound to the
[1:37:09] world the prophets prophesy and came out
[1:37:12] on the scroll and was now flesh don't
[1:37:14] you see yesterday the scripture is
[1:37:17] fulfilled in your ears the attraction
[1:37:19] had left the prophet and was now on his
[1:37:22] prophecy she was what was happening
[1:37:27] what's happening in this out what is God
[1:37:29] doing in this hour she could say it's
[1:37:32] it's me God sent a messenger to her to
[1:37:36] tell her she was the vision it's you his
[1:37:40] shoe but you see she
[1:37:42] he had to receive the messengers message
[1:37:47] just like you must receive what I've
[1:37:49] told you tonight you've got one or two
[1:37:53] choices you need to take what I've said
[1:37:55] to be the truth and believe I was
[1:37:57] speaking about you or you can say I
[1:38:02] simply don't know about that and walk
[1:38:04] out the building the same way you came
[1:38:05] in but you see the angel has come with a
[1:38:09] message
[1:38:10] I don't we know God has sent a messenger
[1:38:12] the seventh angel messenger has come to
[1:38:14] us he has come to us with the message
[1:38:16] and that message has told us your
[1:38:18] predestinated but God he was in God's
[1:38:20] thinking before there was ever of the
[1:38:21] world he was in God's thinking then he
[1:38:23] know the color eyes he knew you hair
[1:38:25] color he knew even your name he knew
[1:38:27] everything about you but you see she had
[1:38:33] to receive the angel's message and what
[1:38:37] did she say here's what she said
[1:38:38] something simple not not something
[1:38:40] mind-blowing just four little words be
[1:38:45] it unto me be it unto me think of it
[1:38:52] friends the wickedness darkest days God
[1:38:55] once more is a messenger with the light
[1:38:57] to tell you you are the vision you are
[1:38:59] the dream you are the thought that God
[1:39:01] taught in the meanest darkest age of
[1:39:03] Laodicea get anything out of a seer yes
[1:39:06] I'm looking at it an angel messenger
[1:39:09] with a great light what did he come to
[1:39:11] do he come to cause us to refocus if you
[1:39:19] can only realize it's me it's me I am
[1:39:23] the vision I am the prophecy I am the
[1:39:25] dream I am the thought I am the
[1:39:27] manifestation
[1:39:28] I am the word I am the wheat plant I am
[1:39:33] Psalms 24 Psalms 27 it's speaking of me
[1:39:36] the rapture chapters Genesis 5 Enoch
[1:39:39] walked with God and was not that's me
[1:39:41] that's me it's me I'm the one he died
[1:39:45] for it's me I'm the one he would strike
[1:39:48] for by His stripes you are healed he
[1:39:51] took those times for me
[1:39:52] he died for me I'm the one he died for
[1:39:56] I'm the one he was fought for I'm the
[1:39:58] one he's covered for of the one he loves
[1:40:02] pop the one he taught us I'm the one he
[1:40:05] chosen everything you've heard brother
[1:40:10] Donny preacher everything brother Tim
[1:40:12] spoke last week the things brother

[1:40:15] me can you see it

[1:40:29] to say it for yourself you've got to
[1:40:31] express it for yourself you know why I'm
[1:40:33] closing because this is the spoken word
[1:40:36] age it's not the age of not in your hand
[1:40:39] it's not the age of clapping your hands
[1:40:41] though there's nothing wrong with that
[1:40:42] we appreciate it when you clap it makes
[1:40:43] you just like saying sick until don't we
[1:40:45] appreciate that but this is a spoken
[1:40:47] word age more than just a nod you must
[1:40:50] speak it why because your body will obey
[1:40:52] your confess daddy we must speak we must
[1:40:57] speak what the word says about us all
[1:40:59] about over clapping oh yeah I'm going in
[1:41:02] a rap sir not ever son of wood this is
[1:41:07] who I am this is what the word says I am
[1:41:09] you've got to say it for yourself Larry
[1:41:13] man the Bible says let the redeemed of
[1:41:15] the Lord say so
[1:41:16] he hath redeemed from the hands of the
[1:41:19] enemy I have every games from the
[1:41:21] devil's head
[1:41:24] funny man there's power in the tongue I
[1:41:32] am the woman at the will that Jesus came
[1:41:35] to that character in the Bible identify
[1:41:38] with this verb and said when the angel
[1:41:42] come to me he referred to me many things
[1:41:44] such as st. John for what was it trying
[1:41:47] to get brother moon see this is the hour
[1:41:48] or the son of man ministry what was the
[1:41:51] angel trying to do get brother branham
[1:41:53] to see his musician what did brother
[1:41:55] Branham trying to do get you to see your
[1:41:57] position hi I'm Rebecca
[1:42:01] the Ellie's are sold out hi I'm ray
[1:42:04] he'll receive the token I am Mary that
[1:42:09] received the word of the Lord
[1:42:10] I am the widow woman with the mill
[1:42:12] borough that God sent allows you to feed
[1:42:14] in the time of famine it's me
[1:42:17] their outcome is my outcome you see they
[1:42:21] were typing out me how very fortunate
[1:42:28] Enoch was to tap you Oh God
[1:42:32] well the Harry resistors come come to
[1:42:35] come the instrument
[1:42:42] they were typing help me I see my
[1:42:46] reflection in the mirror of the word can
[1:42:50] someone catch it tonight
[1:42:51] can you catch it tonight and say this
[1:42:53] day description it's fulfilled fulfilled
[1:42:57] we're fulfilled where it's me now listen
[1:43:03] to me there's my last thought I promise
[1:43:05] a quiz
[1:43:06] listen if Eleazar the brother Bantam
[1:43:09] topped out Eleazar can you say man to
[1:43:11] there if the message is a typing of the
[1:43:14] seeking out because that's what he comes
[1:43:15] with the message he saw that out
[1:43:17] so the message tops the seeking out
[1:43:19] brother branham tops Eliezer Isaac the
[1:43:21] bridegroom who to see top Jesus Christ
[1:43:25] is that right the bridegroom so brother
[1:43:26] been chopped a leader the message is the
[1:43:28] seeking out Isaac is a type of the
[1:43:32] bridegroom Jesus Christ then I ask you
[1:43:34] tonight my brother my sister who is
[1:43:37] Rebekah
[1:43:45] [Applause]
[1:43:56] that's the only place left you see I
[1:43:59] don't talk Billy's brother Brendan did
[1:44:01] dad I don't top the message the holy
[1:44:03] ghost does that I don't top Isaac that's
[1:44:05] Jesus Christ so there's only one place
[1:44:08] in this play in this drama that's being
[1:44:10] played out in this hour there's only one
[1:44:12] part left the bride's part then that has
[1:44:16] to be you and if we can grasp that
[1:44:21] tonight without any emotion without any
[1:44:23] sensation just take it because simply
[1:44:25] because the word said so it'll bring our
[1:44:27] body subject to the word because that's
[1:44:30] what God sent the word for God sent the
[1:44:33] word to find you and bring you back to
[1:44:36] your original position this day these
[1:44:39] scriptures are fulfilled in your ears
[1:44:44] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:44:46] they shall recover if you can believe
[1:44:48] that if you can receive that tonight
[1:44:49] that you're that one that can receive
[1:44:51] the benefits of this healing if you can
[1:44:53] look into the word and say I'm the one
[1:44:55] he was strapped for then your healing is
[1:44:57] over it's done it's been paid for it's
[1:45:00] not something that's going to be well if
[1:45:01] I can hold my hands right nonsense he's
[1:45:04] already done it but her been said of
[1:45:06] Jesus Christ was here in the suit he
[1:45:07] gave me he could not heal you you were
[1:45:09] already healed the word has done
[1:45:11] declared it all you need to do is step
[1:45:12] into the vision you just need to step
[1:45:14] into the vision of the word and say it's
[1:45:16] me do you love him tonight

[2:08:02] upon his heel and there on the side of
[2:08:04] the bank was a prettiest flower I
[2:08:06] believe I've ever seen in my life it was
[2:08:07] it was yellow and it was purple in the
[2:08:10] the colors were so vibrant that it just
[2:08:13] I just stopped him I tracks when I saw
[2:08:14] it I just and I got to thinking how much
[2:08:17] attention to detail that God pays and I
[2:08:21] thought you know that flower right there
[2:08:22] he could be at the White House that
[2:08:23] flower at there could be on Queen
[2:08:25] Elizabeth table when she ate breakfast

[2:08:28] flower was that pretty he got a set
[2:08:30] right there on her table and would not
[2:08:32] been a valid place and I thought why

[2:08:36] you put a flower it have so much
[2:08:37] attention to detail that it would stop
[2:08:40] me in my tracks and while I was standing
