[5:26] vehicle and some of the family issues
[5:28] that she was dealing with. God came on
[5:30] the scene and took care of every
[5:32] situation that she was facing. He even
[5:34] sent a perfect stranger her way to
[5:37] repair her vehicle free of charge. She
[5:40] thanks the Lord for that. Also, sister
[5:42] Eva streamed Sunday service and wanted

[6:16] still in the hospital. Please remember
[6:17] all. Uh it was very hard on the family.

[7:15] says, "I've been having trouble with my

[7:41] doctors are not giving her much time to
[7:42] live. Praying for God's will and
[7:44] strength for my grandfather at this
[7:46] time. So, we want to commit that need
[7:48] unto the Lord
[7:50] tonight. I've got a couple
[7:52] announcements. We'll get to them just in
[7:53] a minute. Let's sing that chorus

[8:48] Let's just take these needs to the Lord
[8:50] tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, we bow
[8:53] our heads before you this evening, Lord.
[8:55] Just so thankful for this privilege, so
[8:58] thankful for this opportunity that we
[8:59] have to gather together, Lord, with with
[9:02] other believers of like precious faith,
[9:04] Lord, and just to come and and hear the
[9:05] word tonight, Lord Jesus. And we're just
[9:07] so grateful and thankful, Lord, that
[9:10] above all that you've promised that
[9:11] you'd be here tonight, Lord. So, this
[9:13] isn't just a gathering of people, not
[9:14] just a gathering of friends, Lord. Lord,
[9:17] but it's a gathering where we expect you
[9:18] to come on the scene and move tonight,
[9:20] Lord. Not just just another gathering of
[9:23] people would not benefit us in any way.
[9:25] Just a a fine speech wouldn't benefit
[9:27] us, Lord. But tonight, Lord, I believe
[9:29] things of eternal value can take place,
[9:31] Lord, because it's the eternal word of
[9:33] God that we've come to hear and to feed
[9:35] upon. And I just pray that you'll anoint
[9:37] every aspect of this service, Lord. The
[9:39] the singing, the music. I I pray that
[9:41] the worship will be pleasing to you,
[9:43] Lord. and that it'll create an
[9:44] atmosphere that you feel welcome to come
[9:46] in and deal with hearts and deal with
[9:48] lives. And Father, I just pray you'd
[9:50] anoint Lord, Brother Donnie as he would
[9:51] bring the word and just anoint not only
[9:53] him to speak, but Lord, I'm asking that
[9:55] you'll anoint every ear in this audience
[9:57] tonight, Lord. That the word can take
[9:59] full effect that we'll receive it, not
[10:01] just be hearers, but doers of the word,
[10:03] Father. Lord, for every need that was
[10:05] read across this desk. We're so
[10:07] grateful, Lord, that Lord, not only did
[10:09] you know about each one before the
[10:11] foundation of the world, Lord, but you
[10:13] have provided the need the the answer,
[10:15] Lord. You took stripes for our sickness.
[10:18] You you move on our behalf, Lord. And
[10:20] you've got an answer on the way. And we
[10:22] just say thank you. I pray tonight,
[10:24] Lord, that every bound person be
[10:25] delivered, Lord. That every backslider,
[10:28] Lord, is be pricricked in their heart to
[10:29] draw closer to you, Lord. And Lord,
[10:31] that's my prayer. May tonight in this
[10:33] place, may we all draw closer to you,
[10:36] Lord. Lord, I pray that each needy one,
[10:38] each shut in, each person, Lord, will
[10:40] have received from you tonight as the
[10:42] word comes forth. Lord, we commit it all
[10:44] to you. Lord, we commit this
[10:46] congregation and each person listening
[10:48] in wherever they may be. Lord, I pray
[10:50] you'll have your way in their life and
[10:52] just move in a special way tonight.
[10:54] Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[29:42] Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on
[29:46] me. You have broken every shame. There's
[29:52] salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my
[29:58] living hope.
[30:05] Hallelujah. Praise the one who set me
[30:09] free.
[30:13] Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on
[30:16] me. You have broken every chain. There's
[30:22] salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my
[30:28] living.
[30:33] Oh, then came the
[30:37] morning that sealed the
[30:41] promise. Your buried
[30:45] body began to breathe.
[30:49] Out of the
[30:52] silence, the roaring
[30:56] lion declared, "The grave has no
[31:01] claim on
[31:04] me." Then came the
[31:07] morning that sealed the promise.
[31:12] Your buried
[31:15] body begin to
[31:19] breathe out of the
[31:23] silence. Your roaring
[31:27] lion declare the grave has no claim on
[31:35] me. Jesus, yours is the victory.
[31:46] Hallelujah. Praise the one who set me
[31:50] free.
[31:53] Hallelujah. Death has lost its grip on
[31:57] me. You have broken every chain. There's
[32:02] salvation in your name. Jesus Christ, my
[32:09] livinging hope.
[32:13] Jesus
[32:14] Christ my
[32:17] livinging
[32:20] home. Oh
[32:23] God you are my
[32:27] livinging hope.
[32:31] [Music]
[32:44] We probably need to hear the
[32:46] lamb
[32:55] sing
[32:58] D. Y'all help me. The spirit and the
[33:03] bride will sing
[33:08] come. The elect feeling stir inside
[33:13] their
[33:15] heart. Our united time has come. We and
[33:20] the
[33:21] father are one.
[33:25] [Music]
[33:26] You will be
[33:29] [Music]
[33:34] without
[33:35] even has come. God is making
[33:41] preparation. She's
[33:45] here for her
[33:49] [Music]
[33:53] king. He's cleaning from
[33:57] inside the
[34:05] [Applause]
[34:08] glory to
[34:12] her. She's washed in the blood of God's
[34:17] own son.
[34:21] rightousness. She knows not her own.
[34:25] She's just before his
[34:30] throne. Will she rain with her love
[34:40] forever has
[34:43] come preparation?
[35:11] Sh has
[35:14] come making
[35:17] Heat. Heat.
[35:28] The
[35:29] light is clear
[35:33] from the
[35:36] lead
[35:40] on and the
[35:44] lead
[35:49] on. Praise the Lord.
[35:55] [Music]
[35:58] [Applause]
[35:59] Hallelujah. We're in the evening light.
[36:03] The Lord gave Harry that song many, many
[36:07] years ago, I guess. Right when we come
[36:09] into the message, huh? It's still still
[36:13] powerful today.
[36:15] Well, let's read about the evening
[36:17] light, shall we? Genesis
[36:22] 24:21. And the man wondering at her held
[36:25] his peace to w whether the Lord had made
[36:28] his journey prosperous or
[36:31] not. And it came to pass as the camels
[36:34] had done
[36:35] drinking that the man took a golden
[36:37] earring of half a shekele weight and two
[36:40] bracelets for her hands of 10 shekels
[36:44] weight of gold.
[36:47] Now remember in bestowing the
[36:50] jewelry, Eleazar
[36:53] claimed Rebecca for
[36:56] Isaac by her allowing him to touch her
[37:01] hands and her
[37:04] face. She accepts
[37:07] it and said, "Whose daughter art thou?
[37:11] Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in
[37:14] thy father's house for us to lodge in?
[37:17] And she said unto him, I am the daughter
[37:19] of Bethule, the son of Mila, which she
[37:23] bare unto
[37:26] Nahor. Now remember, I pointed this out
[37:29] to you before that it was unusual in the
[37:31] Old Testament genealogy in the lineage
[37:34] to mention the woman's side. For most
[37:36] part, it was the man's side. But
[37:38] apparently to Rebecca, it was very
[37:41] important.
[37:42] She said, "Moreover, unto him we have
[37:45] both straw and proender enough and room
[37:50] to lodge in." Now, these are not baited
[37:53] questions. They're questions that will
[37:57] determine her
[37:59] destiny. Her
[38:01] answers are telling this man whether or
[38:05] not she's a match. Our answers about the
[38:09] word
[38:11] tell the same thing. Yeah. I want to say
[38:14] the right thing, don't you?
[38:18] And the man bowed down his
[38:20] head and worshiped the
[38:24] Lord. How many like to be remembered
[38:26] tonight as we pray?
[38:28] I've got a dear friend of mine, Brother
[38:30] Luther Dishman. He's the pastor of the
[38:32] church down in Kentucky where I was
[38:35] there years and years ago. And uh
[38:37] Brother Luther's got a lot of a lot of
[38:39] things going on in his body right now.
[38:42] Carol's been hearing from his daughter,
[38:45] Sister Donna, and he's going to have to
[38:48] go to kidney specialist just several
[38:52] different things. And I know that they
[38:55] would appreciate us praying for them.
[38:58] And also of course the church family.
[39:00] You can imagine if it was your pastor
[39:02] and I'm able to preach. Brother Pete had
[39:04] to go down take the service on Sunday
[39:06] for him because he just wasn't able to
[39:08] preach. So I know that they would
[39:10] appreciate our prayers. Let's just pray
[39:12] together, shall
[39:15] we? Lord Jesus, we're so grateful
[39:17] tonight that whenever we do face such
[39:20] things in life that we have you that we
[39:23] can come
[39:24] to. You don't promise us that this life
[39:28] will be free from heartache and sadness
[39:31] and trouble. As a matter of fact, you
[39:35] tell us that many are the afflictions of
[39:38] the righteous, but the Lord delivers
[39:40] them out of them all.
[39:42] And as I've heard your prophet say it
[39:44] this week in the little sermon I know he
[39:48] said as a matter of fact whenever we
[39:50] become Christians it becomes harder than
[39:54] it was when we was in the world. And to
[39:57] many people it's a stumbling block. But
[40:00] to those that are included in the
[40:02] mysterion of God they understand it's
[40:06] part of their molding their making. So
[40:10] we bring these requests before you
[40:12] tonight signified by the uplifting of
[40:14] the hands. And father, we're praying for
[40:16] our brother Luther. Dear God, that you'd
[40:19] be mindful of our brother. Heavenly
[40:22] Father, you see all these things that
[40:24] are going on with him and his dear wife,
[40:28] Sister Barbara. Lord, we pray for your
[40:31] mercy to them that you would help them.
[40:34] you see Lord going to the doctor and
[40:36] they're going to try to figure out the
[40:38] best thing that they can do. But we know
[40:40] Lord that you could come to our brother
[40:43] and in less than 30 seconds time he
[40:46] could be transformed and won't even need
[40:49] to go to a doctor. But we're asking Lord
[40:52] that your will be done. Now we come into
[40:55] this crucial important part of the
[40:59] service. The singing is so wonderful.
[41:02] prayer requests,
[41:04] testimonies, all the the part that we've
[41:07] had thus far. But now, Lord, the most
[41:10] important part, we will either conceive
[41:14] further pregnant of your word or our
[41:18] hearts will become closed or we will
[41:21] just be mediocre in the service and kind
[41:25] of sit around looking and wondering
[41:26] what's going to happen. But I pray that
[41:29] there would be fertile ground in this
[41:32] place tonight, Father, that we could be
[41:35] recipients of your seed word. That it'll
[41:38] bring forth the finished body of the
[41:42] Lord Jesus. For it's in the name of the
[41:46] word of God that we ask it. And the
[41:50] saint said, "Amen." God bless you. You
[41:54] may be
[41:55] seated.
[41:59] Anybody know what a
[42:03] cuba
[42:06] is? It ain't one of them big old things
[42:08] you
[42:10] play. The
[42:12] cuba was the
[42:14] marriage
[42:17] contract. So the Jewish marriages were
[42:21] legally formalized. I'm going to read
[42:22] some of these things and you can read
[42:24] them with me. by a written marriage
[42:27] contract called a
[42:31] cuba that stated the bride
[42:35] price, the promises of the
[42:38] groom and the
[42:41] rights of the bride. Now listen what the
[42:45] what the cuba holds. So, it's a written
[42:49] marriage
[42:50] contract and it states the bride
[42:55] price. So, how
[42:57] much will the groom and the groom's
[43:01] family have to
[43:03] pay to be able to marry this woman?
[43:08] It will also state the bride's
[43:12] rights and it will include the groom's
[43:18] promises pertaining to the bride, what
[43:22] he will do, what he will
[43:26] provide, and then it turns around and
[43:28] tells the bride her rights in the
[43:33] marriage. So the word Cuba actually just
[43:36] means simply literally that it was a
[43:39] written
[43:41] instrument. Hence the reason for its
[43:44] application to what they called the
[43:47] marriage
[43:49] deed. So it was a contract like we would
[43:53] have a deed of property. So the woman
[43:57] then become the man's possession. He
[44:02] became hers. Now this is just the
[44:05] engagement, the betroal. This would take
[44:09] place after the friend of the bridegroom
[44:13] would come and make this agreement. So
[44:16] he brings the cuba with him. So, as
[44:21] we've been looking in the Old Testament,
[44:23] Israel was viewed as the wife of Yahweh.
[44:29] And the
[44:30] Cuba was the Old Testament or the Old
[44:35] Covenant. In there, the Hebrew
[44:38] scriptures, it contained what God said
[44:42] that he would do. So Deuteronomy, you
[44:45] know the book of Deuteronomy duos, which
[44:47] means a repeating or the repetition of
[44:50] the law contains some of the same things
[44:52] as numbers and Leviticus. So it's duos
[44:55] rtomy and it's Deuteronomy. And God
[44:58] tells them now if you will do this and
[45:00] this and this then I will do this and
[45:03] this and this. But if you don't do this
[45:06] and this, then I will do this and this.
[45:08] So here was their cuba. It was their
[45:12] marriage contract. But aren't you glad
[45:15] that we have a new covenant, a new
[45:20] testament. So the word testament means a
[45:23] covenant. So the old testament which is
[45:25] English of course and it actually was an
[45:28] old covenant and the new testament would
[45:30] have been identified as a new covenant.
[45:33] Turn with me if you would to Hebrews
[45:35] 8:6. Now watch how Paul deals with this.
[45:38] But now hath he obtained a more
[45:42] excellent ministry, by how much also he
[45:46] is the mediator of a better covenant or
[45:50] testament, which was established upon
[45:55] better promises. Notice now, so it
[45:59] changed bridegroom and it changed bride
[46:03] and it changed the cuba contract. So the
[46:08] bride price is going to be different.
[46:11] Now remember the bride price was not set
[46:16] by the parents of the bride. The bride
[46:20] price was based on the value of the
[46:24] groom's family, not the value of the
[46:28] bride's family. As a matter of fact, the
[46:31] bride might come from a very, very poor
[46:35] family. But that did not mean that her
[46:39] bride price would be lessened because
[46:42] she was from a poor family. Because the
[46:46] way they viewed it, it was the father of
[46:50] the groom. His wealth, hallelujah, is
[46:55] what
[46:57] determined actually how much the bride
[47:01] was worth. It was not really her family.
[47:06] Now, she might been way less off than
[47:09] than than the groom was. She might been
[47:12] less worthy, less notable. But that
[47:15] didn't mean then that the bridegroom's
[47:18] father and the bridegroom would say,
[47:20] "Okay, well, she's a poor girl and
[47:22] because of that, you know what? It won't
[47:24] cost us near as much. So, what we're
[47:27] going to do is I mean, we're going to
[47:29] make this a big lot's bride." Okay? So,
[47:31] we're going to buy maybe a you know,
[47:33] we're going to really reduce the bride
[47:36] price. That was not the way they
[47:38] configured it at all. It was based on
[47:42] the wealth of the
[47:44] bridegroom's father.
[47:47] So actually the bridegroom father, he
[47:51] was one that determined the price that
[47:55] his son could pay for his
[48:00] bride. Now this is in the cuba. Now
[48:04] watch in verse 7. Paul goes on to say,
[48:07] "For if that first covenant had been
[48:11] faultless, then should no place had been
[48:14] sought for the second. for finding fault
[48:18] with them. He saith, Behold, the days
[48:22] come, saith the Lord, when I will make a
[48:25] new covenant with the house of Israel,
[48:28] and with the house of Judah, not
[48:31] according to the covenant that I made
[48:33] with their fathers in the day when I
[48:36] took them by the hand to lead them out
[48:39] of the land of Egypt, because they
[48:42] continued not in my covenant. Now
[48:45] remember their cuba was a conditional
[48:49] covenant. How did they lose their land?
[48:52] They didn't keep the conditions. How did
[48:55] they lose forever the right to be
[49:00] Yahweh's wife as a nation? Their
[49:03] disobedience to the cuba. Now think of
[49:07] it that God gave them this
[49:09] conditionally. Hang with me now. The
[49:12] bride's covenant since Calvary is not
[49:16] based upon conditions. It's an eternal
[49:19] covenant.
[49:20] It ain't based upon you. It ain't based
[49:23] upon me. It's based upon our husband.
[49:27] Aren't you glad? Praise be to God. Now,
[49:30] notice, not according to the covenant
[49:33] that I made with her father. So it's
[49:35] going to be a new covenant relativity
[49:38] based upon him and sit upon her because
[49:42] they continued not in my covenant and I
[49:46] regarded them not. Now this is the way
[49:48] he could do that knowing what they would
[49:51] do. So he's going to make a lesser that
[49:55] would point to a greater. Had he gave
[49:58] the greater the lesser could have never
[50:01] followed. God never does it that way.
[50:03] And that's why it's so backwards for men
[50:06] that follow the message and they feel
[50:08] like that brother Brandham was sent to
[50:10] introduce them. You're totally backwards
[50:13] the way that God does anything. Whenever
[50:15] God sent his prophet on the earth, the
[50:18] prophet is to introduce a greater. And
[50:20] the greater one introduced after Malachi
[50:23] 4 wasn't Donnie Reagan. And it wasn't no
[50:26] other preacher in this message. Malachi
[50:29] 4 was sent to introduce who? Jesus
[50:31] Christ. The word. Yes sir. Now notice
[50:34] then God gave the lesser and because
[50:38] they did not keep it then God introduced
[50:41] the greater. Look at verse 10. For this
[50:44] is the covenant that I will make with
[50:47] the house of Israel after those days.
[50:49] Now remember this is Jeremiah. And he's
[50:52] speaking prophetically twofold with
[50:55] Israel as a nation, 144,000, but also
[51:00] the spiritual Israel, which is the
[51:02] gentile bride, that I will make with the
[51:05] house of Israel after those days, sayeth
[51:07] the Lord, I will put my laws into their
[51:11] mind and write them in their hearts. Now
[51:15] they'll not have the Torah like it was
[51:19] given to them in the Old Testament
[51:21] written first on tablets of stone. That
[51:23] was a great significance. It was not
[51:26] written upon a fleshly table of the
[51:29] heart. It was written on stone that was
[51:32] so rigid and so hard but yet could be
[51:36] broken. The stone tablets themselves
[51:40] showed the weakness and also the
[51:42] hardness of the law. What a contrast God
[51:45] signified by taking his own finger and
[51:49] writing it on something so hard as stone
[51:52] and yet showing the frailty of that same
[51:55] stone when Moses threw it down and broke
[51:59] it. Is that true? But notice how rigid,
[52:02] how firm, how stern the law could be. Oh
[52:06] my. I'm so grateful today, friends, that
[52:09] we have a new covenant. Now, we know and
[52:12] we do not believe nor preach that
[52:15] because we have that new covenant, we
[52:17] can live any way we want to. We can live
[52:20] however the world lives. Oh, no. If
[52:22] we're part of this new covenant, we live
[52:24] a wholly separate life from the world.
[52:27] And if you don't, you're deceived by the
[52:29] devil. Yeah. And the church said, "But
[52:33] God said, I will put my laws into their
[52:37] mind, and I will write them in their
[52:41] hearts, not on stone now, but in fleshly
[52:44] tables of the heart, and I will be to
[52:47] them a God, and they shall be to me a
[52:51] people." Believe it. Do you believe
[52:52] tonight this scripture is being
[52:54] fulfilled right in this building? Notice
[52:56] in 2 Corinthians 3:2, "Ye are our
[53:01] epistle written in our hearts." Now
[53:06] notice the saints of God that actually
[53:08] become the literal translation of the
[53:12] message of God for the day they live in.
[53:15] They actually become the written word
[53:18] back on the very heart of God's prophet
[53:21] messenger who brought it. So from his
[53:24] heart, he delivered to them the precept
[53:27] and the oracle of God. Once they take it
[53:31] into their mind, they conceive it and
[53:34] they're celebrated. They bring forth the
[53:36] promised word for the day. Then that
[53:38] prophet messenger that brought that word
[53:41] will present them back as the friend of
[53:44] the bridegroom. And it becomes full
[53:47] circle again. The word made flesh in
[53:50] bride form. Amen. Amen. For as much as
[53:55] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[54:01] epistle of Christ, ministered by us,
[54:05] written not with ink, oh my. But with
[54:09] the spirit of the living God, not on
[54:12] tables of stone, but in fleshly tables
[54:16] of the heart. Now notice this is the
[54:19] same church that when this letter 2
[54:22] Corinthians was written about 5 years
[54:25] after 1 Corinthians, look how they had
[54:28] transformed from being that carnal
[54:31] church that they were in first
[54:33] Corinthians. They were so messed up.
[54:36] They had so many sexual sins and they
[54:39] when they come to church, he says one of
[54:41] his got a psalm, one of he's got a
[54:43] tongue. I mean they were so so focused
[54:46] on self. So when they come to church, it
[54:49] was not about the body. Read first
[54:51] Corinthians and wrote what Paul had to
[54:53] write to them. What was he going over
[54:55] and over again? The word edify. Edified.
[54:58] Edification. Edifying. It's used more
[55:01] there than it is anywhere else in the
[55:04] New Testament. Why? Because they were
[55:06] coming together. It was all about them.
[55:08] So this one had a song. This one had a
[55:11] tongue. This one had that. But look how
[55:13] they had grown five years down the road
[55:17] and see he doesn't have to mention that
[55:19] same sermon again. But now he can move
[55:23] from edify edification and all of that.
[55:26] What were they children? Babies five
[55:29] years time they had grown up from the
[55:33] baby form of first Corinthians. I I'd
[55:36] like to take these books sometime and
[55:38] preach them to you because I believe
[55:40] probably for most of us there's a little
[55:42] bit of every book of the New Testament
[55:45] in our life and every message church
[55:48] basically goes through the cycles of
[55:51] first Corinthians, 2 Corinthians,
[55:52] Ephesians, Philippians, Galatians,
[55:54] Phyimon all of that through there
[55:56] because you can take from those books
[55:59] principles that identify where you are
[56:01] in your walk with God. I love
[56:03] Corinthians because if it had not been
[56:06] for that there's much of the things
[56:08] about hair and dress and things like
[56:10] that we wouldn't even have. Paul never
[56:13] said anything about it in the Ephesian
[56:14] church because they didn't have those
[56:16] issues. But God turned it right around
[56:18] with the shortcomings of that church and
[56:21] he anointed Paul to write the principles
[56:24] of the oracles of God which have been
[56:26] used for over 2,000 years. Look what God
[56:29] does. The devil thinks he's going to
[56:31] make a mess out of something. God turns
[56:33] it right around, transforms the people
[56:36] that Satan made a mess out of. And God
[56:38] said, "Now I'm going to use as as an
[56:41] example, and there will be millions of
[56:43] people that'll be blessed by what you
[56:45] thought was a mess, devil." Now, how do
[56:47] you like that? So only our father can be
[56:50] able to transform it in such a way. So
[56:53] notice how the epistle now to the same
[56:56] group of people. remember they allowed a
[56:58] a man that was actually living with his
[57:01] stepmother sexually having a sexual
[57:04] affair with his stepmother in first
[57:06] Corinthians and and the first Corinthian
[57:08] church they were so carnal and they were
[57:11] so loose that they let him come right in
[57:14] the church and live that way. They
[57:16] wasn't saying nothing about it
[57:17] apparently from the pull pit and nowhere
[57:19] else. They just let it go right on. But
[57:22] look, Paul did not give up on them. We
[57:25] may have some first Corinthian church
[57:27] believers here tonight. Well, brother,
[57:29] we're still hanging on for you. Praise
[57:32] the Lord. Come on. Some of you second
[57:34] Corinthian believers, it's easy for you
[57:36] to look down your nose at some of them
[57:38] first Corinthian believers. But believe
[57:40] it or not, we all was first Corinthian
[57:43] believers at one
[57:44] time. You don't get to second
[57:47] Corinthians by jumping the first. We all
[57:49] start out as babies in this thing. And
[57:52] we grow and we learn. I hope are still
[57:55] teachable.
[57:56] Now watch. So they come from being
[57:59] immature. They come from going to church
[58:02] and focusing on themsel. I imagine that
[58:05] first Corinthian church whenever they
[58:06] would have church, it must have been
[58:08] something. I imagine it was as it was as
[58:11] wild as any Pentecostal church I was
[58:13] ever in in my life because they was all
[58:15] focused on themselves. Can you imagine
[58:18] what kind of service we'd have here
[58:20] tonight if everybody come in here and
[58:22] you wasn't worried about nobody else.
[58:24] You was not concerned about this one
[58:26] that and the other. If you wanted to
[58:28] turn somersaults and you started at the
[58:30] back and you turned somersaults all the
[58:32] way down here, landed and hit that step
[58:34] right there and stand up here preaching.
[58:36] You hit me, knocked me down. That don't
[58:37] matter. You're being blessed. You're
[58:39] having a great time. Glory to God. Well,
[58:41] you broke Brother Donny's jaw. Well, he
[58:43] can go to the doctor and get it all
[58:44] fixed. Glory to God. I was having a
[58:46] spell. I'm tell you one thing. Well, you
[58:48] fell and knocked sister so and so down
[58:50] and you hit bro so I don't care what I
[58:52] done. Glory to God. I was having a time.
[58:54] That's the kind of Christians they were.
[58:56] I hate to say it, but we got him today
[58:58] in the message.
[59:00] But look, no doubt the devil. Now, this
[59:02] is the church that the very prophet of
[59:04] the age started. And when you look at
[59:07] first Corinthians, it was the worst
[59:09] church in the New Testament at their
[59:12] present condition. But remember, God
[59:14] told Paul when he went there, "I'll have
[59:17] much people in this city." He mustn't
[59:21] need to hear that for the years that it
[59:23] was going to take him to bring them up.
[59:25] But they finally arrived. Look at what
[59:28] they moved from to this. For as much as
[59:32] ye are manifestally declared to be the
[59:37] epistle of Christ.
[59:41] Wow. Amen. So they went from the first
[59:43] apostolic church to the epistle of
[59:46] Christ. That's quite a move, is it not?
[59:48] Oh my. Think of it now. Ministered by
[59:51] us, written not with the spirit of the
[59:54] living God. Not in the tables of stone,
[59:56] but in fleshly tables of the heart. Now
[1:00:00] watch what Eleazar is doing. He's sent
[1:00:03] on a mission in the evening time to be
[1:00:06] able to find a bride for Isaac. Now
[1:00:09] remember Isaac, they had no pictures to
[1:00:12] be able to send with him. He was not
[1:00:14] able to Instagram or text or you know
[1:00:17] whatever more uh send Rebecca a YouTube
[1:00:20] video. She had to totally take his word
[1:00:24] of what type of man he was. He had to
[1:00:27] take his word and believe. No way to
[1:00:30] Google this guy. No way to be able to do
[1:00:32] a Yahoo search. No be able to way to
[1:00:35] check out the Louisville Journal or you
[1:00:37] know just to find out if there's 16
[1:00:39] people killed on the bridge or not or no
[1:00:41] way to be able to go down to the cabin
[1:00:43] in Burksville, Kentucky and find out was
[1:00:46] there really a pillar of fire there. I
[1:00:47] mean she had no way to verify what this
[1:00:51] man said.
[1:00:55] So, how many of you would send your
[1:00:56] 16-year-old daughter with such a
[1:01:05] man? Must have been a disconnect there.
[1:01:07] Somehow it got as quiet as it could
[1:01:09] be. So, how you going to prove
[1:01:14] it? This is only one man's
[1:01:17] word. Oh, he had them servants there
[1:01:19] with him, but they're going to do what
[1:01:20] he said do. He's the boss.
[1:01:23] Now watch what they did. The
[1:01:26] kusheen the
[1:01:29] kusheen was the
[1:01:32] betroal. Now remember when the
[1:01:36] kusheen was ministered
[1:01:39] out, it was sealed with a cup of
[1:01:46] acceptance. A
[1:01:48] cup of acceptance. Now watch what
[1:01:51] Rebecca is doing. So drinking from the
[1:01:55] cup signified the groom's
[1:01:59] willingness to pay the
[1:02:04] price of the bride.
[1:02:08] Oh, so is that why that our
[1:02:13] bridegroom ministered the communion at
[1:02:16] the table before
[1:02:18] he went to pay the bride price?
[1:02:21] Is that the same groom that was in the
[1:02:24] garden of Gethsemane and said, "Father,
[1:02:27] if it be thy will,
[1:02:32] let this cup, what
[1:02:34] cup?" the
[1:02:36] agreement for the bride
[1:02:39] price because the father had made the
[1:02:45] decree based upon his
[1:02:49] wealth. It will determine the
[1:02:53] value of the bride
[1:02:58] and the Lord Jesus as a
[1:03:01] man he did not want to die.
[1:03:04] The prophet said he did not want to
[1:03:06] leave his
[1:03:09] disciples. And he's saying, "Father, if
[1:03:12] it be your
[1:03:15] will, let this
[1:03:17] cup pass from me." What
[1:03:20] cup? The cup of acceptance.
[1:03:26] Jesus, if you drink this cup, this means
[1:03:31] you are
[1:03:33] bound. If you take the
[1:03:36] cup, you are bound to follow through on
[1:03:40] your promises to this bride. And what
[1:03:44] are they? I will love you forever.
[1:03:48] You will let me down and you will
[1:03:50] disappoint me. Anybody ever done it?
[1:03:53] Sure you have. Rest of you didn't raise
[1:03:55] your hand. You did it right then cuz
[1:03:57] you're lying.
[1:04:00] But you know what he done when he took
[1:04:02] that cup? He agreed to love you for
[1:04:06] better, for worse.
[1:04:10] Hallelujah to God.
[1:04:12] Thank you,
[1:04:14] Lord. Now notice then the bride was also
[1:04:17] given a cup, the cup of acceptance. And
[1:04:22] hers was not that she was paying a price
[1:04:25] for the groom. She
[1:04:28] couldn't. Hers is accepting the groom's
[1:04:33] headship and the terms of the
[1:04:37] cuba which was the marriage covenant.
[1:04:41] Now you see this is what separates the
[1:04:44] bride from the church. One of the many
[1:04:46] things because the terms of the cuba are
[1:04:51] way too hard for the church, the foolish
[1:04:55] virgin type to ever be able to take the
[1:04:58] cup in their hand. Now they want the cup
[1:05:02] of blessing but not the cup of
[1:05:05] acceptance. Yeah.
[1:05:08] So now whatever they would they would
[1:05:11] agree
[1:05:12] together then the groom would take of
[1:05:15] the cup and this was his cup of
[1:05:17] acceptance and the bride to be was betro
[1:05:21] the kusheen and she would also take of
[1:05:25] the cup. Now in the cup was a
[1:05:30] mixture. There was bitter drags in the
[1:05:32] bottom. There were sweet times in the
[1:05:35] cup. There was healing times in the cup.
[1:05:38] Times of deliverance, times of miracles,
[1:05:42] but also on the same mixture of times of
[1:05:45] pain, times of sorrow, times whenever
[1:05:48] you're praying and asking God and it
[1:05:51] seems like the heavens are closed to
[1:05:53] you. Anybody ever felt that way?
[1:05:56] That's all in the cup. But you see the
[1:06:00] worldly church, they don't want none of
[1:06:02] those drags in the cup, all they want is
[1:06:05] the cup of blessing. They want their
[1:06:06] house to be blessed, their business to
[1:06:08] be blessed, their family to be blessed,
[1:06:10] and they're not required to do a whole
[1:06:12] lot. You know, they just want to know
[1:06:13] what's theirs. But if you're a bride,
[1:06:16] you know, that cup has a mixture. Oh my.
[1:06:20] Now notice whenever the cuba is agreed
[1:06:25] upon the marriage covenant they actually
[1:06:28] are still not living together they have
[1:06:32] not been able to
[1:06:34] consummate the wedding yet but this is
[1:06:37] where that the betroal or the engagement
[1:06:40] as we call it was
[1:06:43] binding. So it was thought through. So,
[1:06:46] a man did not come and just disclose a
[1:06:49] little bit about his life and leave out
[1:06:51] this part and that part and that part
[1:06:53] and that part cuz he knew if he told the
[1:06:55] girl that she wouldn't married him in
[1:06:56] the first place or the girl the same
[1:06:58] way. Come on, somebody.
[1:07:01] That's why young ladies, before you
[1:07:03] marry a man, you need to know that man,
[1:07:07] brothers, the same way with a girl. Just
[1:07:09] cuz she's got pretty eyes and bats them
[1:07:11] like a mosquito don't mean that she's a
[1:07:13] godly girl. You need to find out about
[1:07:16] her. What do you believe about the word?
[1:07:20] Do you believe in preachers?
[1:07:23] That's a damnable thing around the
[1:07:24] message and all tapes only. And it is
[1:07:27] damnable because it's contrary to the
[1:07:29] Bible and contrary to what God's prophet
[1:07:36] taught. Oh my. So now the they will join
[1:07:41] together and the bride is still not yet
[1:07:45] his. So one part part I find about this
[1:07:48] that is so interesting is that the cuba
[1:07:51] the groom commits in the cuba to
[1:07:56] absolutely have
[1:07:58] complete
[1:08:00] complete absolute with no one else
[1:08:03] involved provision for the bride and
[1:08:07] whatever she has need of from that time
[1:08:11] that she accepts the cup then he becomes
[1:08:16] responsible for her in their covenant
[1:08:18] relationship. And remember, they're
[1:08:20] still just yet
[1:08:22] engaged. So now, let's look at the cuba
[1:08:26] of the New Testament. When he comes upon
[1:08:29] the earth, he begins to utter peculiar
[1:08:33] words. I'm talking about the
[1:08:35] groom. And he has his friend to forrun
[1:08:39] him, which was John the Baptist. And
[1:08:42] John comes with the marriage covenant
[1:08:45] and he begins to tell them, "There's one
[1:08:48] among you who is mightier than I. I'm
[1:08:51] not even worthy to stoop down and and
[1:08:54] loose his shoes. I baptize you with
[1:08:57] water, but he will baptize you with the
[1:08:59] Holy Ghost and with fire." And he kept
[1:09:02] talking about him and talking about him.
[1:09:04] I said, "It's the messenger of the
[1:09:06] covenant. Get ready. Get ready. Here
[1:09:08] he's coming." What's he doing? He's
[1:09:10] laying out the covenant. This is why
[1:09:12] Jesus said, "You went out to see." What
[1:09:15] did you go to see when you went to see
[1:09:16] John? A prophet. And I say unto you more
[1:09:20] than a prophet because he was the
[1:09:23] messenger of the new marriage contract.
[1:09:28] The messenger of the covenant. Hang on
[1:09:31] to your false teeth. God did not just
[1:09:34] send William Brham in the last days to
[1:09:37] perform signs, wonders, and miracles,
[1:09:41] but to reinstitute the marriage contract
[1:09:45] again. It had been lost down through the
[1:09:48] church ages through Catholicism and
[1:09:50] Protestantism. And what did God do? God
[1:09:53] sent a friend of the bridegroom. Now
[1:09:57] notice their place is identified in
[1:09:59] scripture by the importance of their
[1:10:02] value was reflected from where they came
[1:10:05] from. So notice where did the seven
[1:10:07] messengers of the ages come from. They
[1:10:10] did not come from under the bridegroom's
[1:10:12] feet. They did not come from on top of
[1:10:15] his kneecap. They did not come from
[1:10:18] behind his ear and he reached up here
[1:10:20] and pulled them out somewhere. But they
[1:10:22] come from his right hand. Not left but
[1:10:26] right hand. The right hand signifies
[1:10:29] power demonstration of God. So they were
[1:10:33] the ones that will represent oh
[1:10:36] hallelujah the deity of God as he
[1:10:40] unveils the marriage contract. Oh I feel
[1:10:43] sorry for those down through the ages
[1:10:45] that have withstood these men. It will
[1:10:47] be a terrible thing for him in the day
[1:10:49] of judgment.
[1:10:51] You're going to be happy, my friends.
[1:10:53] I'm telling you tonight, you ought to be
[1:10:55] happy right now that you're identified
[1:10:57] with this word. But you wait for a
[1:10:59] little bit. You're really going to be
[1:11:01] happy after a while. Now, notice in
[1:11:04] Matthew
[1:11:05] 26:28, for this is my blood of the new
[1:11:09] testament or the new covenant, which is
[1:11:12] shed for
[1:11:16] No, wait a minute. I thought it's for
[1:11:17] everybody.
[1:11:20] Now, this is the man that's going to
[1:11:22] die. I reckon he would know who it's
[1:11:24] shed for. That's right.
[1:11:27] Did he say everybody? So, where do we
[1:11:30] get this? Where does this come from?
[1:11:34] It's been brought right into the
[1:11:35] message. And I'll tell you where it's
[1:11:36] come from. Denominational filth.
[1:11:43] This is the Lord Jesus. He has the cuba.
[1:11:48] Amen. And he said, "My
[1:11:50] blood is going to be shed for many for
[1:11:55] the remission of sin. But I say unto
[1:11:57] you, I will not drink henceforth of this
[1:12:01] fruit of the vine until the day when I
[1:12:04] drink it new with you in my father's
[1:12:08] kingdom." Luke 22:20.
[1:12:13] Likewise also the cup after supper,
[1:12:17] saying, "This cup is the new testament
[1:12:21] in my blood which is shed for."
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:30] Well, it sounds like to me that Jesus
[1:12:32] was kind of directed to a certain group
[1:12:35] of people then.
[1:12:39] So he takes of the cup and drinks it.
[1:12:43] Takes the bread, eats it, breaks it,
[1:12:46] passes it down the line. Then takes the
[1:12:49] cup, drinks of the cup, blesses it. This
[1:12:52] is the cup of the New
[1:12:54] Testament. Drink it. Don't you see why
[1:12:57] we take communion?
[1:12:59] And Jesus said, "Now remember, once I
[1:13:02] drink this natural cup of the vine, I
[1:13:05] will not drink it again until the
[1:13:09] cuba has been completely
[1:13:13] consummated." Now watch. The cuba has
[1:13:15] two
[1:13:17] parts involving a shared cup of
[1:13:22] wine with one at the initiation of the
[1:13:26] agreement and the other one at the
[1:13:30] consummation. Praise God. Don't you see
[1:13:33] why we're going to have a marriage
[1:13:35] supper? We can't go to the millennium
[1:13:37] first. We have got to do the last cup.
[1:13:42] When we sat down across the table,
[1:13:44] friends, don't you understand? It's when
[1:13:47] it's finally consummated and the gentile
[1:13:50] bride gathers around his throne. And
[1:13:52] there we will sat at the table of God
[1:13:55] and drink of the fruit of the vine
[1:13:58] again. And he will look at his beloved
[1:14:01] elected bride and said,
[1:14:04] "Sweetheart, welcome home. Amen.
[1:14:09] Hallelujah.
[1:14:15] The first part happens at the initial
[1:14:20] acceptance of the agreement with the
[1:14:23] sharing of the first cup of
[1:14:27] wine. So when you and I truly, I ain't
[1:14:30] talking about church people now, I'm
[1:14:31] talking about bride people. when they
[1:14:34] truly enter
[1:14:36] in through that burst canal, they've
[1:14:38] come forth through the promised word of
[1:14:40] Malachi 4 and they've been born by the
[1:14:43] spoken word of God and they come out
[1:14:45] when they come out of the burst canal on
[1:14:47] the other side. Some of them will
[1:14:49] scream, some of them will holler, some
[1:14:51] of them will shout, some of them may
[1:14:52] speak in tongues, some of them may fall
[1:14:54] out, and some of them may not do nothing
[1:14:55] but boohoo and cry. But as long as they
[1:14:57] come through that spoken word birth,
[1:14:59] that's what matters anyhow. your emotion
[1:15:02] h that don't matter so much to God
[1:15:04] because if there's one special
[1:15:05] requirement that said all right every
[1:15:07] one of my kids will take their left hand
[1:15:09] and do this and take the right hand and
[1:15:10] do that and their head will do this and
[1:15:11] the right leg will do that and the left
[1:15:13] leg will do that if that's what God
[1:15:14] required here to put in his word come on
[1:15:17] somebody but there is no certain emotion
[1:15:20] there is no certain emotion or whatever
[1:15:22] it is that'll identify you've got the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost it is your life submitted to
[1:15:27] the word and if you're submitted to the
[1:15:29] word then when God allows those trials
[1:15:31] to come your way, you will accept them
[1:15:33] just like you accept the blessings.
[1:15:41] Now watch then the union is
[1:15:44] sealed with the cup of
[1:15:48] acceptance. So whenever we then share
[1:15:52] the communion, every time we do it,
[1:15:55] that's how we're being reminded. Oh
[1:15:57] Jesus, you you accepted. You took my cup
[1:16:00] and I'm sharing your cup and we're
[1:16:02] sharing the same cup. How can we be
[1:16:04] drinking from the same cup and everybody
[1:16:07] hated him and we want everybody to love
[1:16:09] us? That's right. We want our way to be
[1:16:12] so easy and no difficult and all
[1:16:14] blessings and That's right. Do you
[1:16:16] understand Jesus was homeless?
[1:16:24] Homeless. He would have looked about
[1:16:26] like some of these people standing on
[1:16:28] the side of the road, homeless,
[1:16:33] not knowing where his next meal would
[1:16:35] come
[1:16:36] from. On the cattle of a thousand hills,
[1:16:39] but didn't have one when he was sure he
[1:16:41] could eat.
[1:16:44] Oh, we want everything to come our way.
[1:16:46] Little bit of trials and God tests us a
[1:16:48] little bit. That ain't the wife of God.
[1:16:50] If you're drinking from the cup, you're
[1:16:52] going to drink bitterness and all you'll
[1:16:53] cry and yeah, you'll belly ache a little
[1:16:55] bit every now and then. But he knew you
[1:16:57] would. He knew you would. He knew you'd
[1:17:00] get under the load, brother Daryl. He
[1:17:01] knew you'd get under the load, brothers
[1:17:03] and sisters. He knew how it feel. He
[1:17:05] knew exactly how it feels to become
[1:17:07] discouraged and say, "Is there any way I
[1:17:09] can avoid this? Is there any way I'm
[1:17:11] glad he felt that way? It was in the
[1:17:14] covenant. Oh my, there's probably not a
[1:17:16] preacher in the building. probably not a
[1:17:18] deacon in the building or anyone in a
[1:17:20] position in the church that say, "Well,
[1:17:22] I wish it never my job in the first
[1:17:23] place." And I'll raise my hand and say,
[1:17:25] "I'm the same way. I wish I wasn't a
[1:17:27] pastor, you folks. I don't like being a
[1:17:29] preacher. I don't like being a pastor. I
[1:17:32] don't like being a target practice for
[1:17:34] people to shoot at. I don't like being
[1:17:36] threatened for my life to be killed. I
[1:17:38] don't like it. I don't like it. I don't
[1:17:39] like it."
[1:17:44] But you know what I
[1:17:46] do? Keep on drinking.
[1:17:50] Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:55] Now you can clap for me. When I drink,
[1:17:57] do you clap when you drink, too? Oh
[1:18:01] my.
[1:18:03] Hallelujah. You see, this is symbolism,
[1:18:07] of course, of the first cup of the cuba.
[1:18:10] Every time we take to communion, we're
[1:18:13] reminding ourselves. We're reminding
[1:18:15] him, we're reminding our friends, I'm
[1:18:19] joined to the Lord Jesus.
[1:18:24] And I drink this cup of new and I take
[1:18:26] that little tiny piece of bread, my
[1:18:30] identification. Oh, hallelujah. You
[1:18:32] imagine? So notice
[1:18:36] whenever he would issue this, the
[1:18:40] wedding cup will be given to us at the
[1:18:44] marriage supper of the lamb. The wedding
[1:18:48] cup. Now we're going through these dark
[1:18:51] places and trials. And what is it? The
[1:18:55] cup of
[1:18:58] acceptance. Can you accept it that
[1:19:01] people's going to hate you?
[1:19:04] Can you accept it? This is not the broad
[1:19:06] way. It leads to destruction. But
[1:19:09] straight is the gate. Narrow is the way
[1:19:13] and few there be that'll find it. 1
[1:19:17] Corinthians 11:25. Notice Paul again
[1:19:19] said, "After the same
[1:19:23] manner also he took the
[1:19:25] cup when he
[1:19:28] had suffered."
[1:19:32] So he didn't take the cup of bitterness
[1:19:34] and suffering and hardships and s now
[1:19:37] guys now y'all surely surely y'all don't
[1:19:40] think that I no man I I I can't do that
[1:19:45] but here y'all y'all share it. So what'd
[1:19:48] he do? He's a real leader.
[1:19:51] He's a real leader. You see, this is why
[1:19:54] leaders, God, all leaders, sometimes
[1:19:56] will be the most tried Christians you've
[1:19:59] ever known. Because God will not only
[1:20:02] help them lead by memory of the
[1:20:03] scriptures and the message in their head
[1:20:05] and not only lead by healing the sick
[1:20:07] and all that, that's wonderful. That's
[1:20:08] great. That signs following their
[1:20:10] ministry, but God will let them be tried
[1:20:13] and tested and sent them through all
[1:20:15] kinds of hard things because they
[1:20:17] actually in turn will lead. And then you
[1:20:20] can follow them say, "Oh my goodness,
[1:20:22] look at that man." He shook to his very
[1:20:25] core. Listen to a sermon called God Call
[1:20:27] Man in 1958. And you hear the prophet
[1:20:30] said that God is going to bring a great
[1:20:32] revival. And he said before he does, God
[1:20:35] must have men that he can lead by. He
[1:20:38] must have men. Oh, and he lays out the
[1:20:40] protocol. Remember, Brother Daryl? And
[1:20:42] he talks about those men. And he said
[1:20:44] they'll be led to the backside of the
[1:20:46] desert and they'll feel like God's
[1:20:48] forsaken. Why? God wants them to take up
[1:20:51] the cup.
[1:20:53] We're not modern leota sense that we're
[1:20:55] TV guys and radio guys. Oh my. Come on,
[1:20:58] somebody. Let's have church tonight. We
[1:21:01] want to be people of the cross. We want
[1:21:04] to be people that can pick up our cross
[1:21:06] and say, "Lord, help me to bear it for
[1:21:08] your name."
[1:21:12] Amen.
[1:21:14] Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] Praise be to God.
[1:21:20] Now once once the covenant
[1:21:24] contract has now been agreed, now the
[1:21:26] mystery of the
[1:21:29] contents is revealed to the
[1:21:33] bride because the bride is hearing from
[1:21:37] the friend of the bridegroom, in this
[1:21:39] case
[1:21:40] Eleazar, and the groom and his father
[1:21:45] have met
[1:21:47] together and decided what she's
[1:21:52] worth, where they will
[1:21:54] live, how big a place they're going to
[1:21:57] live
[1:21:58] in, and the groom starts building
[1:22:02] it. After Hallelujah, after they are
[1:22:08] engaged, the groom starts working on
[1:22:12] their new home.
[1:22:14] Praise be to God. Now, one of the things
[1:22:18] that he does is called the
[1:22:21] preparation of the hoopah. The
[1:22:24] preparation of the hoopa. You've heard
[1:22:27] me say it before that they'd take a tree
[1:22:29] when a boy was born, take another tree
[1:22:31] when a girl was born, and then whenever
[1:22:33] they would come to the marriageable age,
[1:22:34] and they would get married, and then
[1:22:36] they would after the the betroal, they
[1:22:38] would come in and they would take that
[1:22:40] tree, cut it down to two poles, another
[1:22:42] two poles, and they'd stretch skins over
[1:22:44] the top of it. And there under the
[1:22:46] hoopa, they would take the last cup, and
[1:22:49] they would say their vows. Oh,
[1:22:52] hallelujah. Hallelujah. the acceptance
[1:22:55] of the cup under the hoopa. Now, while
[1:22:58] they are betroved, the groom is not just
[1:23:02] sitting around twiddling his thumbs. The
[1:23:04] bride is not just sitting around
[1:23:06] twiddling her thumb doing something. The
[1:23:08] groom has a very busy
[1:23:12] schedule. He's gone to prepare a place
[1:23:16] for the future bride.
[1:23:18] So the groom, I want you to notice Satan
[1:23:22] and his
[1:23:24] demons have been allowed before the
[1:23:26] throne of God even after their
[1:23:31] fall. Satan has walked into the court of
[1:23:35] the most high
[1:23:38] God. As a matter of fact, he's been
[1:23:40] there today
[1:23:43] accusing us.
[1:23:47] But Jesus is working on a place that one
[1:23:52] devil's track ain't never been on it.
[1:23:55] Praise be to God. Hallelujah. He can
[1:23:59] walk before that throne because the
[1:24:02] mediatorial seat is still occupied. But
[1:24:06] when the mediatorial seat is vacated and
[1:24:10] it changes from lamb to lion, then he
[1:24:14] knows his time accusing you is over. So
[1:24:18] why hang around? His mouth has been
[1:24:21] shut. Praise be to God. Do you
[1:24:24] understand? When you were born and your
[1:24:25] name was put in in the book of life, not
[1:24:27] the lamb's book of life, but in the book
[1:24:28] of life. And it might have been years
[1:24:31] before one thing was ever pinned down
[1:24:34] against you. And so you was a year old,
[1:24:36] you was 18 months old, then 24 months,
[1:24:39] and then maybe 30 months, and who knows
[1:24:41] exactly when it was, sure, you was born
[1:24:43] in sin, but as far as your own personal
[1:24:46] sins that you started doing. Was it when
[1:24:48] you was three, four, you told your first
[1:24:50] lie? You you stole a piece of candy, or
[1:24:53] you done something, and for years there
[1:24:56] was nothing on the pages of the book of
[1:24:59] life under your name. That's where your
[1:25:02] first name was identified. And for years
[1:25:06] those pages were totally empty. Why? You
[1:25:10] were in the age of
[1:25:12] innocence. Do you understand? That was
[1:25:14] the first dispensation in the Garden of
[1:25:16] Eden. That's what the prophet tells us
[1:25:18] in Satan's Eden. The first dispensation
[1:25:21] was innocence. Do you understand what
[1:25:23] happens to you when your name gets
[1:25:25] transferred from the book of life over
[1:25:28] to the Lamb's book of
[1:25:30] life? Permanent innocence.
[1:25:35] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Boy, if I
[1:25:38] was preaching that tonight in a Baptist
[1:25:40] church, they'd be up shouting, wouldn't
[1:25:41] I? Do you understand what it does to
[1:25:44] you? It puts your soul back into that
[1:25:48] state of the dispensation of innocence.
[1:25:52] Blessed is the man to whom God will not
[1:25:54] impute sin to.
[1:26:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:04] Why the
[1:26:07] Koba and you've got the
[1:26:10] token? And he said, I
[1:26:13] swore I would love you for better for
[1:26:23] us. So let's go this way. Dearly
[1:26:27] beloved, we are gathered here on the
[1:26:30] side of God and in the face of this
[1:26:32] company to join together this man and
[1:26:36] this woman in the holy state of
[1:26:40] matrimony which is commanded of us by
[1:26:42] St. Paul that it should not be entered
[1:26:45] into lightly but discreetly, soberly,
[1:26:50] reverently and in the fear of God.
[1:26:53] These two persons present have come
[1:26:56] together to witness the same before
[1:26:59] you believing you have considered this
[1:27:02] solemn
[1:27:03] obligation. I will present to you the
[1:27:07] marriage
[1:27:09] covenant.
[1:27:11] Jesus will you take this flawed
[1:27:15] woman imperfect.
[1:27:21] Amen. needs help every day.
[1:27:25] And I'm telling you, they're going to be
[1:27:27] something.
[1:27:31] They're going to disappoint you.
[1:27:35] But do you take her
[1:27:38] to be your lawful wedded
[1:27:40] wife? Will you live together in God's
[1:27:44] holy ordinance in the state of
[1:27:46] matrimony?
[1:27:48] Do you promise to love her, to sanctify
[1:27:52] her, to fill her with the Holy Ghost, to
[1:27:56] give her the token of her
[1:27:57] identification?
[1:27:59] And even when she gets down and say,
[1:28:01] "Lord, don't you remember my name? Don't
[1:28:04] you remember my address? Lord, have you
[1:28:06] forgot where I live?" And it will pierce
[1:28:09] your heart.
[1:28:11] Do you promise to love her? I do.
[1:28:18] Will you take this man, the Alpha, the
[1:28:23] Omega, the beginning, the end, the
[1:28:26] Adonai, the Yahweh, Jehovah Gyra,
[1:28:29] Jehovah Shalom, Jehovah Titskanu, the
[1:28:32] first, the last, the Alpha, the Omega.
[1:28:36] Amen. The most despised, hated, and
[1:28:40] rejected man that ever lived on the
[1:28:43] earth.
[1:28:46] And in turn, I will tell you, you will
[1:28:48] be hated. You will be cast out. You'll
[1:28:50] be be rejected sometimes by your closest
[1:28:53] friends and sometimes even by family
[1:28:55] members. They will call you holy ruler.
[1:28:58] They will say you belong to a cult.
[1:29:00] They'll say all kinds of this and that
[1:29:01] and the other. And there will be times
[1:29:03] that he will try you. And there will be
[1:29:05] times that you will pray and it will
[1:29:07] seem as if though he's 10 million miles
[1:29:10] away. But do you promise to love him?
[1:29:13] Amen. Answer me. Give me your answer.
[1:29:16] What do you want me to say to him?
[1:29:26] Hallelujah. I will
[1:29:29] require a
[1:29:36] token. Except in this
[1:29:39] case, you can't give him one back. So
[1:29:41] this is only a single ring ceremony.
[1:29:49] So the Lord Jesus lays the ring on my
[1:29:52] book in the form not of a
[1:29:55] rectangle or a pyramid. Pyramid has its
[1:29:59] place but not on your finger. The
[1:30:01] pyramid fits in your
[1:30:03] soul. And he lays his
[1:30:06] ring. or Jesus, what you want me to say
[1:30:09] to her about it? Tell her it's a wedding
[1:30:13] band of predestinated
[1:30:16] unmmerited grace.
[1:30:20] Now tell her in reality that I slipped
[1:30:22] this on her finger before the foundation
[1:30:24] of the world, before there's ever any
[1:30:27] stardust or any sin or any devils or
[1:30:29] anything else. And now she's only acting
[1:30:31] out what was in my mind millions and
[1:30:34] billions of years ago.
[1:30:39] Lord Jesus, say these words after
[1:30:41] me. With this ring, with this ring, I be
[1:30:46] wed. I be
[1:30:49] wed. And of course, we'll say in your
[1:30:51] name, sir. In my
[1:30:57] name. Hallelujah.
[1:31:00] For as
[1:31:02] much as Jesus Christ, the perfect
[1:31:05] sinless
[1:31:07] one, has agreed in this great marriage
[1:31:10] of
[1:31:11] condenses and
[1:31:13] humility to marry mere
[1:31:17] mortals. As a minister of the gospel,
[1:31:20] called before the foundation of the
[1:31:21] world to preach part of this Malachi 4
[1:31:24] union message in the last
[1:31:26] days, I pronounce you man and
[1:31:32] wife. You may kiss your
[1:31:43] bride. You believe he already has by his
[1:31:46] grace.
[1:31:48] Oh yeah. He wounds your heart.
[1:31:52] Now comes the difficult part. Oh, if
[1:31:55] marriage was only like the
[1:31:57] honeymoon. If Christianity was only like
[1:32:00] the honeymoon of the first three or four
[1:32:01] days or you know, however long it is. Oh
[1:32:03] my, this is so wonderful. We're going to
[1:32:05] Greece and we're going over to
[1:32:07] Capidoshia or we're going to Gatlinburg,
[1:32:08] whichever it is you can afford. And
[1:32:10] we're going boy man alive. We're going
[1:32:11] to Dollywood and we're going to eat that
[1:32:13] cotton candy. You better watch her
[1:32:14] buddy. She'll grow in size. I'm telling
[1:32:17] you, oh man, wa this is so wonderful.
[1:32:20] Oh, I I've I've wanted to be with you.
[1:32:22] I've longed to be with them and all, but
[1:32:24] you know how it can be. And you know,
[1:32:26] you get up in the morning, you didn't
[1:32:27] realize. I mean, you hadn't never stayed
[1:32:28] in the same room with him before. Man,
[1:32:30] he took his shoes off and left them
[1:32:31] laying there beside the bed and you got
[1:32:32] up to go to the bathroom. You fell and
[1:32:34] broke your neck. And then she done this.
[1:32:36] She got toothpaste all over the mirror.
[1:32:37] I can't believe she's so nasty. I
[1:32:39] thought she'd be clean. I mean, I just
[1:32:41] didn't know it was going to be this way.
[1:32:42] But the Lord Jesus knew all of your
[1:32:44] faults.
[1:32:46] He knew all of your shortcomings and he
[1:32:48] said, "I love you anyway because this is
[1:32:52] only temporary. Your faults are only
[1:32:55] temporary. Your shortcomings are only
[1:32:58] temporary. I loved you before you had
[1:33:01] faults. I love you till you get past
[1:33:04] faults. You are my
[1:33:10] heart." Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] So, while the
[1:33:24] bridegroom starts building a
[1:33:28] house, and I really thought this was
[1:33:30] amazing whenever I found this, that the
[1:33:32] bridegroom would usually build their new
[1:33:35] home on family property.
[1:33:44] Ain't it just like Jesus? He won't set
[1:33:46] down that new city on the
[1:33:49] millennium because at the end of the
[1:33:51] millennium, the devil will raise back up
[1:33:53] again and be able to try to assert his
[1:33:55] authority again. So Jesus will never set
[1:33:58] our hoopa on this earth in the
[1:34:00] millennium. But he waits until the
[1:34:02] breaking of the eighth day, which is
[1:34:05] eternity. You see, what you're wearing
[1:34:07] on your finger is the same city. It's an
[1:34:09] antitype of the city where you going
[1:34:11] back into eternity. And it will be as if
[1:34:14] though all your faults, all your
[1:34:15] shortcomings. Now, I know we're all
[1:34:17] angels here tonight and we're all just
[1:34:19] saints of God and we all just love one
[1:34:20] another so much and everything, but I
[1:34:23] have been around few message people
[1:34:25] that, you know, they couldn't get along.
[1:34:26] I know it's not that well here. Um, you
[1:34:28] know that they can't get along and they
[1:34:29] don't like this about that person and
[1:34:31] this about that person. I can't stand to
[1:34:33] be around them. I'll tell you why in the
[1:34:34] world do they do that? It just bothers
[1:34:36] me the way they do. Well, I'll tell you,
[1:34:38] there'll never be none of that there.
[1:34:40] You know, because their oddity and your
[1:34:42] oddity, too, that makes us kind of
[1:34:44] clash. There'll never be one day, can
[1:34:46] you imagine? There'll never be 30
[1:34:47] seconds of anyone losing their temper in
[1:34:49] paradise. There'll never be anybody
[1:34:52] raising their voice or anybody being in
[1:34:54] a bad humor. Bad humors are not allowed
[1:34:56] down streets of gold. There'll never be
[1:34:58] nobody, oh, praise the Lord. Nobody will
[1:35:01] come in the new city with their lip all
[1:35:03] rolled out and pouting because the
[1:35:04] pastor didn't preach what they wanted to
[1:35:05] preach or he preached something they
[1:35:07] didn't like. I wish somebody would
[1:35:08] preach to me tonight. There won't be
[1:35:10] none of it there because not only will
[1:35:12] we be new, we will be changed.
[1:35:16] We will be changed. Our old human makeup
[1:35:19] that's caused us so many problems will
[1:35:22] be gone forever.
[1:35:30] Now
[1:35:33] notice, the
[1:35:38] home must be built to reflect the
[1:35:42] stature and the standing of the father
[1:35:46] of the
[1:35:53] groom because it would be his
[1:35:55] reputation. Because the son is going to
[1:35:58] be a continuation of the father. You
[1:36:01] know like the son will sit on the throne
[1:36:02] and the father will hang behind him that
[1:36:04] great
[1:36:09] light. So Jesus goes
[1:36:11] away and he starts
[1:36:14] work on our brattle
[1:36:18] chamber. Now there's no Lowe's in heaven
[1:36:20] and no Home Depot, no Menards or none of
[1:36:22] that sort of thing. Their building
[1:36:25] material is not the right
[1:36:27] quality. Any of you brothers that needs
[1:36:30] just to build a wall and you go to
[1:36:31] Lowe's and you're going to look for
[1:36:32] enough straight 2x4s to build one. God
[1:36:34] bless you. You do believe in
[1:36:38] miracles, but Jesus is creating
[1:36:42] it. Where's all that gold come from?
[1:36:46] He's creator.
[1:36:50] Now, apparently, it was very important
[1:36:52] for the bride in the last day to know
[1:36:54] how close we were to moving
[1:36:57] in. So, by the end of the prophet's life
[1:37:00] in the church age book, which is just
[1:37:02] completed before he goes away, he tells
[1:37:06] us the
[1:37:07] stage of the new
[1:37:09] home. And he tells us how far along it
[1:37:12] is. How many's ever built a new house
[1:37:15] before? Oh my goodness. You're just
[1:37:17] under such anticipation. Or maybe you
[1:37:19] bought one that's already built and
[1:37:20] you're remodeling going in. Oh, you're
[1:37:22] just so excited. You're just so excited.
[1:37:24] Well, what' they get done today, honey?
[1:37:26] Oh, nobody showed up. I'm sorry. Bunch
[1:37:28] of contractors. I'll tell you one thing.
[1:37:29] Bunch of liars. There'll be someone be
[1:37:31] in heaven. God will prove it just to
[1:37:33] show the devil he could get some of them
[1:37:34] there. It beats all I ever say. And
[1:37:36] they're go to church with us. I'll tell
[1:37:38] you one thing. I just don't understand
[1:37:40] it.
[1:37:44] just a metaphor. I'm not saying I'm just
[1:37:50] So what's he do?
[1:37:53] Speaks. And the prophet said the
[1:37:56] streets were already
[1:37:59] laid. The gates of
[1:38:03] pearl have already been hung. As of
[1:38:07] 1965, the gates were already there.
[1:38:11] And the angels were there waiting
[1:38:15] breathlessly.
[1:38:17] Breathlessly. You imagine they took a
[1:38:19] breath in
[1:38:22] 65. They're waiting for
[1:38:28] what? There might be a little child
[1:38:30] that'll come to this vacation Bible
[1:38:32] school this
[1:38:34] week. His mom and daddy might not even
[1:38:37] come to church. His mama may come in
[1:38:40] with tight britches on or her hair all
[1:38:42] cut off or
[1:38:44] whatever, but don't judge him too
[1:38:47] hard cuz there might be a little seat of
[1:38:50] God walking right in there behind mama.
[1:38:52] Amen. And his name is on that book. And
[1:38:55] Word of Life Church will have meetings
[1:38:57] and go on and brother Tim and brother
[1:38:59] Ron and you know all these other
[1:39:01] brothers around the world will preach
[1:39:02] and have meetings and brother Daryl,
[1:39:04] brother Andrew Glover, M will just go on
[1:39:06] until that little boy will get big
[1:39:08] enough and the spirit of God can deal
[1:39:10] with his heart and he'll be able to give
[1:39:11] his life to God.
[1:39:16] As a matter of fact, if you would have
[1:39:18] seen me and
[1:39:19] Harry when we was little bitty guys,
[1:39:22] you'd have probably thought they ain't
[1:39:24] no hope for
[1:39:26] him. Cuz we wasn't raised in church. For
[1:39:30] those of you who heard my wife's
[1:39:32] testimony when she gave it last year at
[1:39:34] the Bible school
[1:39:36] thing, you ought to have seen the faces
[1:39:38] of our youth when she shared it. She was
[1:39:41] 16 years old the first time she heard
[1:39:44] about
[1:39:44] Noah and Moses and building an
[1:39:49] ark. You see, that's why she still cries
[1:39:52] when she hears Amazing Grace song. It's
[1:39:55] why it still moves her heart. Oh, some
[1:39:57] of you was cut your teeth on a message
[1:39:59] pew and don't mean nothing to you. I say
[1:40:01] shame on you tonight. It ought to be
[1:40:03] just as real to you as it is to her. Oh
[1:40:06] my God owes us nothing. We owe him
[1:40:20] everything. So the father would
[1:40:23] encourage the son. Now
[1:40:26] son, I want you to build
[1:40:29] her a beautiful
[1:40:33] place. Now
[1:40:35] papa, can we afford it? He said, "What
[1:40:38] you talking about, boy?
[1:40:40] I own a cattle on a thousand heels. You
[1:40:42] need more heels, I'll make them. You
[1:40:45] need gold in them heels, I can take care
[1:40:46] of that, too. You need silver, you need
[1:40:48] purple, you need blue, I want you to
[1:40:51] make your sweetheart a city like it's
[1:40:55] never been on the face of the earth.
[1:40:57] Yeah. I want you to make it so big that
[1:41:01] I'll have to dry up the
[1:41:04] Mediterranean in order to set it on the
[1:41:06] navl of the earth, which is Israel.
[1:41:12] You see, our city will be so
[1:41:15] large. If you've ever been to Israel,
[1:41:17] you know the Mediterranean backs right
[1:41:19] up. The land mass backs right up to the
[1:41:22] Mediterranean. The Mediterranean will
[1:41:25] have to be gone. That's why John was so
[1:41:28] amazed when he looked and said, "I saw
[1:41:30] no
[1:41:31] sea." John was raised around the
[1:41:34] Mediterranean. He saw it his whole
[1:41:37] life. And he walks out there and he
[1:41:39] said, "What happened to the
[1:41:44] Mediterranean?" And Jesus said, "I need
[1:41:47] that property, John. Don't worry about
[1:41:49] it. I'm bringing my sweetheart down."
[1:41:51] And John said, "I, John, saw the holy
[1:41:53] city, the new Jerusalem, descending from
[1:41:55] God out of heaven as a bride adorned for
[1:41:58] her husband." What did he see? He didn't
[1:42:01] see a little old pup tent put out there.
[1:42:03] He didn't see a cardboard with tacky
[1:42:05] buttons, but he saw gold. He saw silver.
[1:42:08] He saw chalsin. He saw the sardic. He
[1:42:11] saw the topaz, the barrel, the diamond.
[1:42:13] He saw all of that greatness. And what
[1:42:15] did it reflect? It reflected the wealth
[1:42:19] of our father.
[1:42:22] And our father said,
[1:42:25] "She is worth such a
[1:42:28] place to live
[1:42:35] in." I don't know about you tonight, I
[1:42:37] need help
[1:42:39] cuz I still look at me as being
[1:42:40] worthless.
[1:42:47] St. John 14:2 and we'll close.
[1:42:51] In my father's
[1:42:53] house are many
[1:42:57] mansions. If it were not so, I would
[1:43:01] have told
[1:43:02] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:43:08] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[1:43:12] I will come
[1:43:14] again and receive
[1:43:17] you unto
[1:43:21] myself. Oh my
[1:43:24] Lord, I will receive you unto
[1:43:28] myself that where I
[1:43:32] am, I don't mind telling you where the I
[1:43:35] am is. I want to be I am too.
[1:43:38] Where I
[1:43:40] am, there you may be
[1:43:43] also. I love the way the friend of the
[1:43:46] bridegroom was able to express it in
[1:43:48] this
[1:43:49] age in the future home. He said, notice
[1:43:52] that Jesus said in St. John 14, go and
[1:43:54] prepare a
[1:43:56] place. Oh, what will it look like? Did
[1:43:59] you ever think now
[1:44:02] bride what it will look like? It's
[1:44:06] prepared and
[1:44:07] designed by the divine
[1:44:11] architect. What will that city look
[1:44:13] like? We're going to talk about it for a
[1:44:14] few minutes. The divine architect has
[1:44:19] prepared it, designed it. And look, he
[1:44:22] has designed it with tender
[1:44:26] hands for his beloved
[1:44:29] bride. What's it going to look like? Can
[1:44:32] you imagine a man marrying a wife that's
[1:44:35] able? How he builds and puts every
[1:44:39] little thing just
[1:44:43] exactly to her touch. Just he says it
[1:44:47] like this, just what she would
[1:44:51] like. Amen.
[1:44:54] Now the divine architect has designed
[1:44:57] the new city where he will live with his
[1:45:01] bride just to her touch. No wonder the
[1:45:04] apostle said eyes not seen, ears not
[1:45:06] heard, nor is it entered into the heart
[1:45:08] of man. Let's see if we can probe into
[1:45:10] it just a
[1:45:12] moment to see what it's going to look
[1:45:14] like. The divine architect has designed
[1:45:17] this for his beloved. See what a place
[1:45:21] it must
[1:45:22] be when divine
[1:45:26] nature, a divine architect has designed
[1:45:29] it for a divine
[1:45:33] attribute that's been divinely
[1:45:36] predestinated by a divine God. I'll tell
[1:45:39] you, this all sounds very divine to me.
[1:45:45] Glory. Divine nature, divine architect,
[1:45:49] divine attribute, divine God, divinely
[1:45:53] predestinated. Who is the
[1:45:55] author of divine
[1:45:59] life? What will that city look like?
[1:46:03] Think of it. Remember, it's not going to
[1:46:07] be heaven.
[1:46:10] Several years ago, I had some visitors
[1:46:12] on our front
[1:46:15] door when we lived at 3521 Chelsea
[1:46:21] Lane. I could tell by looking at them,
[1:46:24] they were witnesses for
[1:46:28] Jehovah. So, they knocked on my
[1:46:31] door. Would you have time to talk a
[1:46:34] little bit? I said, "Sure, come on in.
[1:46:40] Do you read the Bible very much? I said
[1:46:47] some make a long story very short. They
[1:46:51] wanted to bring their head bishop back
[1:46:53] the next time. Yeah. Well, the next time
[1:46:57] I was ready for them, even more so than
[1:47:00] the first time, cuz I had little clips
[1:47:03] of the message of Malachi 4 of a prophet
[1:47:06] of God calling people out, telling them
[1:47:08] their name, their address, what the
[1:47:10] doctor looked like, what they had with
[1:47:12] this and that and the other. I didn't
[1:47:14] just play that for Jehovah Witness. I
[1:47:16] also played it from some Mormon
[1:47:20] elders. I said, "You boys follow a
[1:47:22] prophet, don't you?" "Oh, yes, sir. We
[1:47:24] believe in a prophet. I do too. I went
[1:47:26] up and got the Book of
[1:47:28] Mormon. So I brought down the Book of
[1:47:30] Mormon. I said, "According to this guy
[1:47:32] right here, you all believe prophets, do
[1:47:34] you?" "Yes, sir." I said, "I do, too. I
[1:47:36] follow one." "Oh, yeah. We believe in
[1:47:39] prophets. We have prophets." I said,
[1:47:40] "Can your prophets do this?" And I
[1:47:43] pressed
[1:47:45] play. Hallelujah. Well, of course, you
[1:47:48] know, they had to report me to the big
[1:47:50] guy and they said, "Stay away from him.
[1:47:52] We've heard of them. They're in a cult.
[1:47:54] Can you imagine Mormons calling me a
[1:48:01] cult? And the Jehovah Witness, I throw
[1:48:04] the line out said, "Do you believe that
[1:48:07] we're going to live in heaven for
[1:48:08] eternity?" I said, "No, sir. I sure
[1:48:11] don't." "You don't?" "No." I said, "I
[1:48:14] don't believe that. The Bible don't
[1:48:15] teach we're going to live in Oh, oh, oh,
[1:48:18] my everybody in this community believes
[1:48:20] that." I said, "I ain't everybody in
[1:48:21] this community." Hallelujah. Oh, you
[1:48:24] mean you believe we'll live on the
[1:48:25] earth? I said, 'Absolutely, with all my
[1:48:27] heart. Oh, we got something we can talk
[1:48:29] about. Well, that was only Hook. You
[1:48:32] know,
[1:48:33] Hook. Oh, aren't you glad God didn't
[1:48:36] just call you for heaven? God's called
[1:48:38] you for a work down here. Look, friends,
[1:48:41] what we're going through, drink your
[1:48:43] cup. I know we need joy to do it.
[1:48:46] Sometimes I'm like you. I complain. I
[1:48:48] think, God, I wish this wasn't my route.
[1:48:50] I wish I didn't have to go through this,
[1:48:52] that, and another. And then I get
[1:48:53] another taste of that cup and I say,
[1:48:55] "Who in the world am I anyway? I was
[1:48:57] born lost without God. He owes me
[1:49:00] nothing. My goodness, if he never hears
[1:49:02] another prayer, I ain't got no right to
[1:49:05] complain about anything. Let's stand."
[1:49:11] Glory.
[1:49:24] Oh,
[1:49:27] hallelujah. What will it be like when
[1:49:30] we'll be next door
[1:49:36] neighbors and the fountain will come
[1:49:38] down from up on top out from under the
[1:49:43] throne. And there will be terraces.
[1:49:46] They'll come out so far and then drop.
[1:49:49] Come out and
[1:49:51] drop. And the water will come in on your
[1:49:54] place, your property that he's built for
[1:49:58] you. And your
[1:50:00] trees and your
[1:50:03] plants. They'll never
[1:50:06] die. I sat out some at the house the
[1:50:08] other day and I was watering some of
[1:50:09] them and looked at them. I thought, my
[1:50:11] goodness, what in the world happened to
[1:50:12] them? Two or three of them just about
[1:50:14] dead.
[1:50:16] But I'll never look at any of those
[1:50:18] flowers. I never think that cuz it'll
[1:50:20] never
[1:50:21] die. And the water will come down off of
[1:50:24] my terrace down to yours and on down on
[1:50:27] down on down and circulate and come
[1:50:31] right back up again.
[1:50:35] And father
[1:50:37] God whom no man has ever seen or ever
[1:50:41] will will be that bright shining light
[1:50:45] that will hover over the
[1:50:48] son and the son's
[1:50:53] wife. And you will be privileged by his
[1:50:56] grace to live in this
[1:50:59] city for eternity.
[1:51:03] And those who are in the book of life
[1:51:05] who made him their choice, not being
[1:51:08] bride, they will be allowed to come in
[1:51:11] from new moon and Sabbath. You see,
[1:51:13] they'll be under more of a routine and
[1:51:16] timelines and guidelines and all that
[1:51:18] out there cuz the city has no need of
[1:51:21] the sun. John didn't say that about the
[1:51:24] earth. Yeah.
[1:51:27] Don't you see it wouldn't be fitting for
[1:51:30] foolish virgins to live outside the
[1:51:33] mountain of God now and live in the
[1:51:36] mountain of God once they go there?
[1:51:39] That's right. Don't you understand? This
[1:51:41] is why I'm trying to preach you and
[1:51:43] every other God called man in this word
[1:51:46] trying to preach the people into the
[1:51:48] mountain of
[1:51:49] God. If we can get you there, it is your
[1:51:53] eternal residence.
[1:51:56] Amen. In heaven, you'll only live what
[1:52:00] you reflected
[1:52:02] here. So those people who live outside,
[1:52:05] they think they have the Holy Spirit cuz
[1:52:06] the pastors told them they did. They got
[1:52:08] it when they
[1:52:10] believed. So they're in and out. In and
[1:52:12] out. In and out. But once you come in,
[1:52:15] you don't have no more in and out. In
[1:52:16] and out. Once you got it, it's yours
[1:52:18] forever. Amen. The Holy Ghost in your
[1:52:21] soul tonight is your part of the Godhead
[1:52:24] for eternity.
[1:52:28] It blows people's minds, but the word
[1:52:31] Elohim is plural.
[1:52:36] Plural.
[1:52:39] Not that there's many gods, but many
[1:52:43] attributes
[1:52:45] in the Godhead. Amen.
[1:52:49] I'm looking at some of them tonight.
[1:52:53] You see, when God divided Abraham's name
[1:52:56] and put an H in the middle of it, he
[1:52:58] gave him part of his name and he said,
[1:53:01] "I'm big
[1:53:02] Elohim and you're little Elohim."
[1:53:06] [Laughter]
[1:53:09] Hallelujah. Is it not written, I said,
[1:53:12] in your own word, ye are gods.
[1:53:16] What was Adam in the Garden of Eden? A
[1:53:20] God. And that's what we're going back
[1:53:22] to. Amen.
[1:53:27] Don't you love him?
[1:53:31] Think of it,
[1:53:33] friends. God has sent a messenger with a
[1:53:37] message. Rebecca is in the land all
[1:53:40] around the world. Different
[1:53:41] nationalities, different colors,
[1:53:43] different
[1:53:44] races, and he's calling her. That's the
[1:53:47] evening
[1:53:50] message. Soon and very soon, she'll turn
[1:53:55] and get on the camel
[1:53:57] train and start back to
[1:54:00] Isaac. And when she does, all hell will
[1:54:06] break loose on this
[1:54:07] earth. I hope and pray to God if any of
[1:54:10] my family is not bride. I hope and pray
[1:54:13] to God if any of our church family does
[1:54:17] not go in the rapture. I hope the bomb
[1:54:20] takes you out. That's right.
[1:54:25] Cuz you cannot imagine how it's going to
[1:54:27] be to live on this earth in the
[1:54:30] tribulation period.
[1:54:32] You say that's cruel. Oh, no. It's grace
[1:54:34] actually. Yes.
[1:54:37] I I hate the thoughts of anyone having
[1:54:40] to live under the dominion of Satan
[1:54:44] himself. If he can do what he's does
[1:54:47] right now and he's held back by us being
[1:54:50] here, you wait till we're gone.
[1:54:53] This world has never seen anything like
[1:54:56] what's fixing to happen. Because not
[1:54:59] only will Satan take over, but God in
[1:55:01] his wrath and judgment will meet Satan's
[1:55:03] power on the earth. Elijah and Moses.
[1:55:05] Revelation 11 will be here. All hell
[1:55:08] will break loose. And while it's take
[1:55:11] breaking loose down here, we'll be up
[1:55:13] there in the
[1:55:14] hoopah sitting at the marriage supper,
[1:55:17] the marriage of the
[1:55:19] lamb. That's when the prophet said,
[1:55:21] "We'll reach across the table, brother
[1:55:23] Daryl, and we'll take one another by the
[1:55:26] hand. Maybe the last time we ever shed a
[1:55:29] tear."
[1:55:31] And the great king walks out on his
[1:55:33] great garments and he takes his robe and
[1:55:36] says, "Don't cry no
[1:55:39] more. It's all over. You made it,
[1:55:44] sweetheart.
[1:55:46] Enjoy." Now, you imagine when he sits at
[1:55:49] the head of the table and we take our
[1:55:51] cup and he raises his cup, maybe similar
[1:55:54] to this, and says, "My bride, you
[1:55:57] overcame darkness. You overcame
[1:56:01] hell. And greater than all that, you
[1:56:04] overcome yourself.
[1:56:08] Drink the cup of
[1:56:13] finalization, my
[1:56:16] bride, my overcoming
[1:56:19] wife. Praise be to
[1:56:23] God. Let's bow our heads.
[1:56:27] Maybe we can sing about the camel train
[1:56:31] again. Oh
[1:56:35] my. We're going we're going to offer
[1:56:37] prayer for for all of us here tonight.
[1:56:42] But maybe some of you are uncertain
[1:56:44] about the Holy
[1:56:45] Ghost. Some of you you're struggling
[1:56:48] with this or that or whatever is going
[1:56:49] on in your life.
[1:56:52] Some of you convinced you have it and
[1:56:54] and the evidence is there. Wonderful.
[1:56:56] Praise
[1:56:58] God. But you just want to fall in love
[1:57:00] with him more. I believe I've got the
[1:57:02] Holy Ghost tonight, but oh, I just want
[1:57:04] to love him more than I've ever loved
[1:57:06] him. So, whatever your need and your
[1:57:09] request is, would you just raise your
[1:57:10] hand to God? If you need the Holy Ghost,
[1:57:12] if you need assurance, if you feel you
[1:57:15] have the Holy Ghost, but you need a
[1:57:16] refilling of the Holy
[1:57:21] Ghost. Heavenly
[1:57:25] Father, oh, how I've been longing to
[1:57:29] bring this to them
[1:57:32] tonight. I believe we're in that hour,
[1:57:35] Lord.
[1:57:38] Oh Jesus, if there's anyone here tonight
[1:57:40] whose name is on that bride
[1:57:44] book, how beautiful the prophet portrays
[1:57:47] it because he says that our
[1:57:50] name and that lamb's book of
[1:57:53] life is our marriage
[1:57:57] certificate. Our marriage
[1:58:01] certificate. Oh
[1:58:04] Jesus. If there's any here tonight that
[1:58:06] don't have the Holy
[1:58:08] Ghost, maybe there's some that's
[1:58:10] struggling with different things in
[1:58:11] their life and some of them need
[1:58:14] leadership. What whatever they need,
[1:58:16] Lord, I pray you'd be mindful of them
[1:58:19] tonight. Father, I believe with all of
[1:58:20] my
[1:58:21] heart I have the Holy Ghost, but Lord, I
[1:58:26] need
[1:58:27] strength. I need wisdom to lead your
[1:58:30] people.
[1:58:32] Sometimes your people can be
[1:58:35] stubborn. They can be
[1:58:39] hard-headed. Sometimes, Lord, they have
[1:58:42] to be preached too
[1:58:44] hard. Sometimes I'll try to warn them
[1:58:47] and they go ahead and do whatever
[1:58:48] they're going to do
[1:58:52] anyway. Lord Jesus, I pray you would
[1:58:54] help every God call man. I'm in touch
[1:58:57] with preachers all over the world and
[1:59:00] hearing from him as I heard from a
[1:59:02] pastor yesterday and just in the sound
[1:59:04] of his words in the
[1:59:07] text sharing with me a few things in his
[1:59:10] church and I thought poor
[1:59:12] God. Oh Jesus, I pray for your men
[1:59:15] servants around the world. Strengthen
[1:59:18] them.
[1:59:19] Father, help them Lord that they don't
[1:59:22] become discouraged in
[1:59:24] welloing. Help the fathers, the mothers,
[1:59:27] the boys, the girls. Lord Jesus, I pray
[1:59:30] for our deacon brothers. I pray for the
[1:59:33] minister brothers here. Lord, I pray for
[1:59:36] the brothers who Lord sacrificed the
[1:59:39] service to be able to run the PA system
[1:59:41] and those in the upper part up there
[1:59:43] with the internet and all of that. Lord,
[1:59:45] I I pray for all of them. Jesus, help
[1:59:48] us, Lord. We don't want to come this
[1:59:51] far, Father, and fall short of your
[1:59:54] glory. Oh God, deal with every one of
[1:59:57] our hearts tonight, Lord. Our response
[2:00:01] to this evening
[2:00:03] message is saying a great deal about us.
[2:00:07] It's evident what people are saying
[2:00:09] about it where their destiny is leading
[2:00:12] them. For some who followed it for 40
[2:00:15] years. Now they're calling your prophet
[2:00:17] a false
[2:00:19] prophet. a man who made up stories and
[2:00:22] those discernments was just made up
[2:00:24] between him and the people which is
[2:00:27] blaspheming against the Holy
[2:00:30] Ghost. Dear God, that's what they're
[2:00:33] saying. Why? Because it's harvest time.
[2:00:37] And in the harvest time, the brier must
[2:00:39] prove it's a brier. Lord, as I preached
[2:00:42] it years ago to these people, whenever
[2:00:44] you called the tears and I went and
[2:00:47] studied and done some great depths of
[2:00:49] research on it and found that word was
[2:00:53] darnell. And the word darnell, it was a
[2:00:56] plant that looked almost identical to
[2:00:58] the wheat in every stage. When it come
[2:01:02] up in the first two blades of
[2:01:03] justification, it looked just like the
[2:01:05] wheat. When it come up, on up, on up,
[2:01:08] just like the wheat right to the very
[2:01:11] end. And even when it produced its
[2:01:14] grain, it looked so much like the
[2:01:17] wheat that only the experienced farmer
[2:01:20] would be able to tell the
[2:01:23] difference. But if they was to pull the
[2:01:26] darnell and eat it, it's poison and it
[2:01:31] kills them. It brings
[2:01:33] death. Oh, God.
[2:01:36] It's evident some of the preachers down
[2:01:38] through time have sown
[2:01:40] darnell with this message and their own
[2:01:43] little personal revelations have killed
[2:01:46] themselves and many of their
[2:01:48] followers. Lord Jesus, I pray you would
[2:01:51] help me. Help the men of God on the
[2:01:54] field right now, Lord, that we keep
[2:01:56] Darnell out of the bride's table. Lord,
[2:02:00] that we don't mix Darnell with seed life
[2:02:03] of the word. Help us, Father. We want
[2:02:07] the genuine, the real. Oh, Father, we
[2:02:10] want the supernatural. We want the great
[2:02:13] move of the spirit of God. Oh, but Lord,
[2:02:17] we're going to judge it all by your
[2:02:19] word. Help us tonight, Lord Jesus. We
[2:02:23] worship you,
[2:02:25] Father. Bless your name, Lord.
[2:02:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:32] Lord, pass by this way tonight,
[2:02:36] Father. Hallelujah. Singing for us.
[2:02:39] Harry started. Don't you love him
[2:02:41] tonight, saints? I mean, he believes
[2:02:43] with all your heart when that rapture
[2:02:45] comes, you're going. Amen. By the grace
[2:02:48] of God. Let's sing this together a
[2:02:50] little bit before we go. Aren't you
[2:02:52] happy to be in the house of God? Have
[2:02:54] you drunk the cup of acceptance? Yes.
[2:02:58] Have you accepted him not only as your
[2:03:00] savior but as your head, your master and
[2:03:04] your lord? And if he wills that you go
[2:03:06] down difficult paths, that was in your
[2:03:09] cup. If he wills that you suffer, that
[2:03:12] was in your cup. Or will you throw the
[2:03:14] cup out and say, "No, I'm going to trade
[2:03:16] the cup in." No. If you're a bride,
[2:03:18] you'll say, "Well, Lord, this is what I
[2:03:20] signed up for. This is in the cup." God
[2:03:22] bless you. Let's sing together.
[2:03:25] Oh, get
[2:03:28] ready. The evening shadows fall. Oh,
[2:03:33] hallelujah. Don't you hear the Have you

[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:55] He found a bride for Isaac near the
[2:05:01] evening shadows

[2:10:26] train comes
[2:10:33] in. Oh,
[2:10:35] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:38] Hallelujah. But you say, "Brother
[2:10:40] Donnie, I ain't good enough." I know you
[2:10:42] ain't. And listen to the other part. I
[2:10:45] ain't either. Brother Random wasn't
[2:10:48] either. Paul wasn't either. John wasn't
[2:10:50] either. It ain't based on our wealth.
[2:10:54] It's based on how the father views us.
[2:10:57] The father must view us as be pretty
[2:11:00] well the price.
[2:11:02] I love the way the prophet deals with it
[2:11:05] when he says that they called a great
[2:11:07] meeting in the garden of Eden and the
[2:11:10] son the humanity and the father the
[2:11:14] spirit that was having a
[2:11:17] conference and the spirit said do you
[2:11:20] want to go you want to go through with
[2:11:22] this and he said is there any other
[2:11:25] way and he said there's no other
[2:11:28] way if you don't do this you'll be alone
[2:11:32] in
[2:11:34] paradise. And I can tell you, I've been
[2:11:37] alone in
[2:11:38] paradise and I didn't like
[2:11:41] it. You're the only one that can do
[2:11:44] it. But what will the price be, Father?
[2:11:48] The price will be
[2:11:52] you.
[2:11:53] You. It's not
[2:11:56] nails. It's not a whip.
[2:11:59] The price is
[2:12:01] you. Don't you understand what he wants
[2:12:04] back? You know what he wants back?
[2:12:09] You. Is that too much to ask? What did
[2:12:13] he give us?
[2:12:16] Himself. And what does he want back?
[2:12:22] Yes. Accept the fact friends we will be
[2:12:26] working on this one goal and achievement
[2:12:29] our entire walk with
[2:12:32] God to be able to give him our
[2:12:36] all. Maybe some will arrive at that
[2:12:38] stage at
[2:12:39] 25, maybe some at 44, maybe some at 74,
[2:12:44] some at
[2:12:45] 64, but we will all arrive to that
[2:12:48] place. And the Lord looks at him and
[2:12:50] says, "They're
[2:12:53] finished. They're finished. Go ahead and
[2:12:56] call them home." Now, what we're waiting
[2:12:58] for is the father to speak over to the
[2:13:00] humanity and say, "Go get your
[2:13:04] bride." Brother, sister, you talking
[2:13:06] about a day? Don't you love him tonight?
[2:13:11] Let's bow our heads
[2:13:13] together. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:13:16] Lord Jesus, how we worship you tonight.
[2:13:21] Father, thank you for your word for
[2:13:24] speaking to us, breaking it down, making
[2:13:26] it so simple that even a simpleton like
[2:13:29] myself could be able to understand it.
[2:13:33] As we go from this place, may we ponder
[2:13:35] over it,
[2:13:36] Lord. May we look in the bottom of our
[2:13:39] cup at the time when the dregs are at
[2:13:41] the bottom and it seems so difficult to
[2:13:44] bear. And when we know our God makes no
[2:13:48] mistakes, Lord, whatever you allow to be
[2:13:51] in the portion of my
[2:13:52] cup, not one trial will be too heavy for
[2:13:55] me to bear. Not one test for any of
[2:13:59] these sons and daughters of God.
[2:14:02] Therefore, give us the ability to
[2:14:04] completely trust you as you trusted the
[2:14:07] spirit which dwelt in you. Granted,
[2:14:10] Father, go with us now. We pray. Lord,
[2:14:14] we know several of our saints are all
[2:14:16] going on a trip together here at the end
[2:14:18] of the week and pray that you'd watch
[2:14:20] over them, Lord, and bless them.
[2:14:22] Different people out on vacations and
[2:14:23] things like that. Watch over them, Lord.
[2:14:26] Bring them back safely home to us. And
[2:14:28] Lord, may there not be a one of us
[2:14:30] missing on that day. I pray, Father. We
[2:14:34] long to be with you, Lord Jesus. Keep us
[2:14:37] safe. Keep us free until that hour
[2:14:40] comes. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:14:45] And the church said, "Amen." Let's pick
[2:14:47] it up a little bit, Harry, and let's
[2:14:48] sing together.
[2:14:50] Amen. Amen. And the church said, "A
[2:14:54] little
[2:14:56] pastor."
[2:14:59] Amen. Come on, let's sing it.
[2:15:03] Amen.
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:07] Amen. Do you believe it?
[2:15:12] Are you
[2:15:15] married? Do you love
[2:15:19] him? Are you
[2:15:21] excited? Praise
[2:15:23] God. Well, the bride
[2:15:27] said, "Are you
[2:15:30] going?" Yes, I
[2:15:33] am.
[2:15:36] Amen. Amen.
[2:15:40] I want to serve
[2:15:43] you. I'm going to believe
[2:15:48] him. I'm going to give him all that I
[2:15:56] have. I turn my back on the
[2:16:00] devil. I ain't got no more time for
[2:16:04] him. I don't got married.
[2:16:09] [Music]
[2:16:11] Well, begin. My home is already
[2:16:16] there. Already
[2:16:20] prepared. Glory.
[2:16:24] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you saints
[2:16:27] for the fear of
[2:16:29] God. Oh,
[2:16:33] hallelujah. Come on, let's sing it now.
[2:16:36] like a bunch of God's
[2:16:38] children. Oh
[2:16:42] Lord.
[2:16:44] Amen.
[2:16:46] Amen. Don't you love
[2:16:50] him? Are you going to serve
[2:16:54] him? Are you going to move
[2:16:57] on? Move up higher and higher and
[2:17:01] higher.
[2:17:04] Oh, I love
[2:17:07] you. Oh,
[2:17:10] hallelujah.
[2:17:16] Amen.
[2:17:19] Amen.
[2:17:21] [Music]
[2:17:25] God. Amen.
[2:17:31] Hey
[2:17:33] [Music]
[2:17:50] man, hey.
[2:17:53] [Music]
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:12] Heat. Heat.
