[32:29] Heavenly
[32:30] Father we are grateful in times like
[32:33] these that we have a high priest who can
[32:35] be touched by the feeling of our
[32:39] affirmatives who stood at lazarus's
[32:41] grave as a friend and wept with others
[32:44] who
[32:45] mourned who understands what it feels
[32:47] like to feel the hurt of the passing of
[32:50] a loved
[32:52] one but as thy word says we weep not as
[32:55] those who have no hope for our hope and

[33:29] Amen on behalf of the family I would
[33:31] like to thank each of you for taking the
[33:34] time to call and to
[33:37] text thank you for the
[33:39] cards thank you for the food that you
[33:41] brought us thank you for dropping by the
[33:44] house to visit with us and from the
[33:47] bottom of our hearts we thank you for
[33:50] coming and being a part of
[33:52] this service to celebrate the life of
[33:56] Judy Gail Ward
[34:03] Archer Judy was my
[34:06] sister she and my brother Dell were
[34:12] twins but she's also like a second
[34:16] mother growing up we were poor
[34:19] and Mom had to work to help out the
[34:21] family and jitty being the older sister
[34:24] by 5 years jitty took care of Dwayne and
[34:27] Dale and me my mom was at work she would
[34:32] cook for us
[34:33] and watch over
[34:36] us and that motherly Instinct that she
[34:38] had for us went right over into
[34:41] adulthood she was always calling in
[34:43] checking on
[34:45] us Judy was a loving and caring mother
[34:48] to Carrington and
[34:49] Eric and as a Grammy to her grandkids
[34:52] Kensington and Logan Eli Ethan and
[34:55] Lauren she was the best
[34:59] she was involved in their lives going to
[35:01] all their special events and showing her
[35:03] commitment to her
[35:04] family and even though Judy was Jessica
[35:07] and Allison's aunt she was also like a
[35:10] grandmother to them because my mom died
[35:13] many year ago and when they were young
[35:16] and Judy kind of took the row of filling
[35:18] in for
[35:20] Mom when shl and I went out of town Judy
[35:23] would stay with the girls a lot and they
[35:26] would head to the dollar Tre to load up
[35:28] on junk food and Blow Pops and pizza
[35:32] have a night of
[35:33] karaoke and when we come back home we
[35:35] found two spoiled
[35:43] kids when Aiden was
[35:46] born Judy was just Smitten by him my my
[35:50] grandson and even the last few days of
[35:53] her life when he'd come to see her she
[35:54] was just light up and grin ear to ear
[35:58] she would just hug on him and love on
[36:01] him she was the
[36:04] best and although jimy never had a lot
[36:07] of
[36:08] money she'd never let it stop her from
[36:10] trying to make sure that everyone had a
[36:13] gift for their birthday and for
[36:16] Christmas and she would take thought in
[36:18] trying to find a gift that she thought
[36:21] you could really
[36:23] use one memory that the family often
[36:26] brings up is jitty's chiropractic
[36:31] skills when she was younger she worked
[36:33] for a caropractor here in town and so
[36:35] every holiday birthday party family get
[36:39] together after we eat we'd all line up
[36:42] and she'd have us in the floor rubbing
[36:44] on sore muscles and adjusting backs it
[36:47] was a family
[36:49] tradition even for Cheryl's
[36:52] family jitty's favorite scripture was
[36:54] Isaiah
[36:55] 41:10 she said the the Lord had given
[36:58] her that scripture several year ago and
[37:00] it had been her go-to scripture ever
[37:03] since and along about 2020 she was on a
[37:06] call service at the VA hospital where
[37:08] veterans would call in to make
[37:10] appointments and Judy told me she got a
[37:13] call one day and that the man on the
[37:15] phone told her that the Lord had told
[37:17] him to call this number and when the
[37:18] person answered to tell them that the
[37:21] Lord told me to give you this scripture
[37:24] and she said before the man ever started
[37:26] reading the scripture she knew what it
[37:29] was Isaiah
[37:31] 41:10 fear thou not for I am with thee
[37:35] be not dismayed for I am thy God I will
[37:39] strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay
[37:42] I will uphold thee with the right hand
[37:45] of my
[37:47] righteousness she said she hung up the
[37:49] phone and rededicated her life to the
[37:54] Lord Judy had a great sense of humor she
[37:57] loved to laugh and most of her times
[38:00] together was spent just
[38:02] laughing and even when she would call or
[38:05] come by to discuss something that was
[38:07] important we'd end up laughing and
[38:10] cutting
[38:11] up some of my favorite
[38:14] memories and I was looking at some of
[38:16] the comments that people had said about
[38:18] jitty on Facebook and I'd like to share
[38:20] just a
[38:21] few jimy was one of the selfless persons
[38:24] you'd ever meet she always put everyone
[38:27] above of herself she would always buy
[38:30] and give gifts to people and when you
[38:31] tried to give her something for it she
[38:33] wouldn't take
[38:35] it Judy was one of the sweetest persons
[38:37] I knew always caring for
[38:41] others another one said Judy was a rare
[38:44] Jewel she was such a wonderful sweet and
[38:46] Beautiful
[38:49] Soul JY always let her light shine she
[38:52] never wavered in her
[38:55] faith and jimy had many
[38:58] heartaches and many disappointments in
[39:01] life but it never stopped her
[39:04] smile or wavered her faith and when they
[39:08] told her that she was
[39:10] terminal she never stopped believing
[39:12] that God would heal her she told me I'm
[39:15] a winner either way if I go I'm ready or
[39:18] if I stay I will go with you and testify
[39:21] of the god that
[39:23] heals she placed her life in the hands
[39:25] of the god who cannot
[39:32] fail go rest high

[44:40] [Music]
[44:56] Imagine certainly wish to extend our
[44:59] condolences to
[45:01] the family and
[45:04] friends I'd like to read to you from
[45:06] Genesis chapter 3 verse
[45:10] 9 and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[45:13] said unto
[45:15] him where art
[45:18] thou and he said I heard thy voice in
[45:22] the
[45:23] garden and I was afraid
[45:27] because I was
[45:29] naked and I hid
[45:32] myself I'd like to speak to you for a
[45:36] few minutes this evening on facing man's
[45:40] greatest
[45:43] fear probably most of us in this
[45:46] building tonight have all different
[45:49] types of
[45:50] fears we can fear Heights we can fear
[45:55] water
[45:57] Darkness
[45:59] falling
[46:01] failure sickness plagues
[46:06] pestilences but yet when it comes right
[46:08] down to it the greatest of all fears are
[46:13] death if you get pneumonia a good doctor
[46:17] good treatment they catch it fast enough
[46:20] good chance you'll recover many of you
[46:22] probably had covid you're recovered
[46:27] but when you go into
[46:29] death there's no
[46:31] recovery unless you've been
[46:35] vaccinated by eternal
[46:38] life whenever we think of our precious
[46:43] sister and the journey of her life as
[46:47] brother Daryl's already said she had
[46:49] many ups and downs like most of us
[46:52] sicknesses and heartaches
[46:55] disappointments and people
[46:57] disappointments no doubt in
[46:59] herself but
[47:01] yet the thing with the Christian is that
[47:04] we're able to come back and find where
[47:08] our hope
[47:09] is but what I find amazing for a child
[47:13] of
[47:14] God is that when man's greatest fear
[47:18] strikes them they look at it totally
[47:23] different now the parallel between this
[47:25] is because
[47:27] the Lord Jesus
[47:29] himself actually feared
[47:33] death which is the
[47:35] opposite of what his children will do
[47:38] the Bible tells us in Hebrews 5:7 who in
[47:41] the days of his flesh when he had
[47:42] offered up prayers and
[47:45] supplications with strong crying and
[47:49] tears unto him that was able to save him
[47:53] from
[47:54] death and was heard
[47:58] that he
[48:00] feared Jesus
[48:02] Christ feared
[48:07] death you see he was going to die a
[48:11] curse in the sight of
[48:14] God he was going to die out of his
[48:18] presence he was going to
[48:21] die on a horrible horrible
[48:25] cross but he died out of the presence of
[48:28] God so we wouldn't have
[48:31] to he died
[48:33] fearing and trembling so Jesus Christ
[48:37] the perfect sinless Lamb of God
[48:41] died
[48:44] afraid but let me tell you something
[48:47] tonight sister Judy didn't die
[48:51] afid brother darl was just telling me a
[48:54] few moments ago before we come out of
[48:55] the office how it was that she
[48:59] left she was not screaming crying
[49:01] begging for another moment of life I
[49:04] don't want to go I don't want to go I'm
[49:07] lost I'm
[49:09] lost but
[49:10] instead she faced man's greatest
[49:15] fear and wasn't
[49:18] afraid so it's hard for us to imagine
[49:20] the sitting here in in the Book of
[49:22] Genesis that man for the first time
[49:25] experienced fear he never felt it before
[49:29] must have been
[49:30] overwhelming knowing that he had done
[49:32] wrong and had displeased his father and
[49:36] he hears the voice of God come walking
[49:38] in the garden of the cool of the day as
[49:39] the Bible says and he went and hid
[49:42] himself then God comes running to the
[49:45] Garden screaming Adam Adam where are
[49:48] you he's wanting him to come out himself
[49:52] but after man falls it's not in himself
[49:55] to do that
[49:57] so father came looking for
[50:00] him and he gets these words out of his
[50:02] mouth I heard your voice and I was
[50:06] afraid so just to meet God In the Garden
[50:10] in the afternoon instilled such a fear
[50:14] in man he didn't even want to meet him
[50:17] that way can you imagine then living
[50:21] your life the way that we live ours all
[50:24] of our mistakes all of our failures
[50:27] all of our
[50:28] shortcomings and then we have to meet
[50:31] God naturally shouldn't it terrify us
[50:35] shouldn't it make us so afraid that we
[50:38] cannot even think about meeting God how
[50:42] is it then that people die all the time
[50:46] and they don't fear man's greatest
[50:51] fear but the answer is what the first
[50:53] Adam lost the second Adam retrieved
[50:57] retrieved but he had to experience fear
[51:01] and deaths himself so that were you face
[51:06] it I face it as children of God we don't
[51:10] have to be afraid David said it this way
[51:12] in Psalm 23:4 ye though I walk through
[51:16] the
[51:17] valley of the shadow of death I will
[51:20] fear no evil for thy rod and thy staff
[51:27] they comfort me you see these are status
[51:30] symbols of a Shepherd his rod and his
[51:35] staff so to a sheep the rod and the
[51:39] staff are status symbols of their
[51:43] protector that he will fight and give
[51:45] his life to protect him a lion a bear a
[51:50] Jackle whatever it would be that would
[51:52] come against them the rod and the staff
[51:56] and the hand of a loving Shepherd he
[51:58] would give his last drop of
[52:01] blood which is exactly what Our Shepherd
[52:04] did he did not want you or me or sister
[52:09] Judy when it come down to facing deaths
[52:14] to have to be so terrified and believe
[52:16] it or not death is actually the easier
[52:19] part for it's appointed unto men once to
[52:22] die then after that the judgment
[52:27] but there's something unnerving about
[52:30] death needless to say none of us have
[52:33] been there all we've known is life we've
[52:36] known sickness and maybe you've been so
[52:38] sick at times you thought you were going
[52:40] to die but once we go into the channel
[52:43] of death is there a way
[52:46] out is there a way
[52:49] back or once we are there is not our
[52:52] destiny determined for as that tree lean
[52:56] and it falls whether it's toward God or
[52:59] away from God there's no way to change
[53:02] it man
[53:04] moves by this passage of deaths into
[53:08] that spot no wonder people are
[53:10] terrified no wonder they're so afraid
[53:13] because in death you cannot change your
[53:16] mind our minds must be made up now again
[53:20] Hebrews 2:9 but we see Jesus who was
[53:23] made a little lower than the angels for
[53:25] the suffering of death crowned with
[53:29] Glory and Honor that he by the grace of
[53:34] God should taste deaths for every
[53:41] man maybe there's some people here
[53:43] tonight and you don't s serve him you
[53:44] don't know him you have no desire to and
[53:47] he knew you would or would not and still
[53:51] he tasted death for you so that whenever
[53:55] you come to where Judah did that you
[53:58] won't have to scream and be horrified by
[54:03] death in verse 14 Paul goes on to say
[54:05] for as much then as the children are
[54:07] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[54:10] himself likewise took part of the same
[54:13] that through death he might destroy him
[54:16] that has the power of death that is the
[54:22] devil here we set tonight and
[54:25] we're under the influence of two
[54:28] different
[54:30] dimensions what happened a few days ago
[54:34] when sister Judy Drew her last
[54:38] breath in the sixth Dimension were're
[54:40] saints of God
[54:42] go it was so different than the way it
[54:46] was in the room where this family
[54:49] were tears running out of their eyes and
[54:53] grabbing one another and holding her
[54:55] hand and all of that that was the
[54:58] influence of these four dimensions here
[55:01] that we
[55:02] see but if we could have been able to
[55:05] look into the dimension where she now
[55:08] lives what a
[55:10] contrast and as the Bible tells us
[55:12] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[55:16] deaths of his
[55:18] Saints
[55:21] precious you mean a child of God
[55:24] dying is precious to to the
[55:27] lord well was it precious to all them in
[55:30] one way yes and another way
[55:33] no you could ask any of these family
[55:35] members
[55:36] tonight I feel I could freely answer for
[55:39] them would they want her to come back
[55:43] and that same old body that she had
[55:45] suffered so much in would they want her
[55:47] to come back in this same house that she
[55:49] had had so much hardship and troubles in
[55:52] life there is no way they would call her
[55:55] back
[55:56] into this same
[55:58] house Paul tells us being found in
[56:01] fashion as a man he humbled himself
[56:03] speaking about Jesus and became obedient
[56:08] unto deaths even the deaths of the
[56:13] Cross so he
[56:15] screams he
[56:18] cries the anointing leaves him in the
[56:20] Garden of
[56:21] [Music]
[56:23] Gethsemane they put him on the cross and
[56:25] they drive those
[56:26] Nails into his
[56:28] hands they've already placed the crown
[56:31] of thorns on his head which was Victor's
[56:33] Thorns they called them from 6 to 9 in
[56:37] long they placed it down on his head
[56:40] with sticks so they themselves would not
[56:42] get stuck with
[56:44] them by the time he goes to the Cross
[56:46] his head is swollen nearly twice the
[56:49] size that it would have been
[56:52] normally his body is in such Agony he's
[56:55] thirsty
[56:58] bursting his blood pressure is
[57:00] fluctuating up and down his
[57:02] heart all that he went
[57:05] through why for you for
[57:10] me so when I
[57:12] die I won't have to experience
[57:15] that that I will be able
[57:18] to draw my
[57:20] breaths and know that when my last one
[57:23] is drawn in a few moments
[57:26] I'll be on the other
[57:29] side you see whenever we think about
[57:31] deaths whether you're rich or poor
[57:36] famous or
[57:38] inFAMOUS let me give you a few words of
[57:41] some great
[57:44] people Elizabeth I queen of England died
[57:50] in
[57:51] 1603 all my possessions she said would I
[57:57] give for a
[58:00] moment of
[58:03] time all my possessions would I give for
[58:08] a moment of time now we're not talking
[58:11] about a beggar I talk about somebody
[58:13] living on the street but a
[58:16] king a
[58:18] wife of a great
[58:21] king who was dominating the world at
[58:24] that time no doubt had lavish Lifestyles
[58:28] some of the greatest food that you'd
[58:30] want to eat in a palace that was so
[58:33] beautiful of the finest clothes money
[58:36] could buy gold silver gems rubies
[58:40] diadems all types of things all around
[58:44] her and she would trade it all for one
[58:47] moment of time Henry VII king of King of
[58:53] England died in 1547
[58:57] All Is
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] Lost now this man had lived his own life
[59:03] out of the economy of
[59:05] God now he's facing man's greatest fear
[59:09] and he says All Is Lost and these are
[59:14] his last three words
[59:17] monks
[59:19] monks
[59:24] monks and he takes his life
[59:28] breath why is he so
[59:30] fearful he's a great man he's got gold
[59:34] silver plenty of money
[59:38] servants but you see death has the
[59:40] ability of putting us
[59:43] all on the same
[59:45] level you ever seen anybody's Cadillacs
[59:48] and their
[59:49] caskets keys to their BMWs or Porsches
[59:52] or whatever it is they drive their Worth
[59:55] or tit
[59:57] it's worth nothing in that world that is
[1:00:00] to
[1:00:02] come Andrew
[1:00:05] Jackson United States president died
[1:00:09] 1845 oh do not
[1:00:12] cry be good
[1:00:15] children and we will all Meet in
[1:00:22] Heaven General Thomas Stonewall Jackson
[1:00:27] 1863 let us cross over the river and sit
[1:00:31] in the shade of the
[1:00:35] trees facing man's greatest fear but
[1:00:39] look at the difference in what people
[1:00:42] say when they face it some wanting
[1:00:46] another moment another
[1:00:48] hour Edgar Allan pole you know of him
[1:00:53] died October the 7th 1849
[1:00:57] Lord

[1:01:10] soul what good did all of his ability to
[1:01:13] write poetry doing when it come down to
[1:01:16] facing man's greatest
[1:01:19] fear Sir Francis Newport head of the
[1:01:24] English infidel
[1:01:28] Club said to those gathered around his
[1:01:31] death
[1:01:33] bed do not tell me there is no
[1:01:37] God for I know there is
[1:01:40] one and that I
[1:01:43] am in his angry
[1:01:47] presence you need not tell me there is
[1:01:50] no
[1:01:51] hell for I already feel my soul
[1:01:56] slipping into its
[1:01:59] fires
[1:02:01] wretches cease your idle
[1:02:03] talk about there being hope for
[1:02:07] me I am
[1:02:10] lost
[1:02:14] forever but isin it comforting family
[1:02:17] members that wasn't what you heard from
[1:02:19] the lips of sister
[1:02:21] Judy I'm lost forever there's no hope
[1:02:25] for me
[1:02:27] but just
[1:02:28] Breeze and
[1:02:30] Breeze and
[1:02:33] G facing man's greatest
[1:02:37] fear David Hume the famous
[1:02:42] atheist cried I'm in
[1:02:46] Flames I'm in
[1:02:50] Flames voler the famous skeptic died a
[1:02:54] terrible death his nurse said all the
[1:02:57] money for all the money in Europe I
[1:03:01] wouldn't want to see another
[1:03:04] unbeliever die for all night long he
[1:03:09] cried for
[1:03:13] forgiveness now in comparison to a lot
[1:03:15] of these people sister Judy is not going
[1:03:18] to leave a lot of
[1:03:20] gold lot of
[1:03:22] silver a
[1:03:24] crown of royal purple
[1:03:27] robe but she leaves behind a
[1:03:30] legacy which is absolutely Beyond
[1:03:36] price her memory as brother Daryl has
[1:03:38] done said will live on and when you all
[1:03:42] think of her you may not think as Edgar
[1:03:45] alen Poe as the Queen of England or the
[1:03:49] king of England but you have been
[1:03:52] affected each of us by the life
[1:03:56] she lived let me read you one more Sir
[1:04:00] Thomas Scott Scott once the president of
[1:04:03] the English lower house said up until
[1:04:06] this time I thought there was no God Nor
[1:04:12] Hell now that I feel that there are
[1:04:16] both I am delivered to
[1:04:20] predition by the righteous
[1:04:22] Judgment of almighty God
[1:04:27] on her desk bed Queen Victoria told
[1:04:29] those around her that she loved God and
[1:04:33] was his little child and she was ready
[1:04:36] to die she then called for the hymn To
[1:04:39] Be Sung Rock of Ages Cliff for me let me
[1:04:46] hide myself in
[1:04:48] thee are you sure Victoria you're going
[1:04:52] Beyond the Veil you can never come back
[1:04:55] is Immortal again you don't know for
[1:04:58] sure what's there scientifically we
[1:05:01] can't prove that there's a
[1:05:03] God scientifically we can't prove to you
[1:05:06] people who believes that that there is a
[1:05:09] heaven we've never sent a satellite
[1:05:11] there we have no jets that can go there
[1:05:14] and come back so are you
[1:05:17] sure we're
[1:05:19] sure because our lord Jesus went there
[1:05:22] for us and he come back or he say how
[1:05:25] can you know that
[1:05:26] preacher all of them disciples gave all
[1:05:29] of their lives do you think they would
[1:05:32] have done that if they would have
[1:05:34] thought he was an
[1:05:37] impostor they would have died they hung
[1:05:40] Andrew on a cross in the form of an
[1:05:44] ex the priest of Greece beat
[1:05:48] Mark with Fuller's
[1:05:51] clubs on and on we could go talking
[1:05:55] about those men who walked with him if
[1:05:59] he was a fake why would they have given
[1:06:02] their
[1:06:05] all now let me leave this world for just
[1:06:08] a
[1:06:11] moment and share a little bit with you
[1:06:14] from that world where our sister has
[1:06:17] gone she's not been gone that
[1:06:20] long from our
[1:06:23] side but again in reality we know that
[1:06:26] there is another
[1:06:29] world by which those which are prepared
[1:06:31] go into the presence of
[1:06:33] God and they are not a disembodied
[1:06:37] Spirit but according to the scripture
[1:06:39] they have a body which is prepared
[1:06:42] before the foundation of the
[1:06:46] world I imagine by now that sister Judy
[1:06:49] has already seen many of the Saints
[1:06:55] I'm reminded of a
[1:06:57] story that we are
[1:07:01] told and it was a sister that had sung
[1:07:04] many songs and blessed many
[1:07:07] people and our Prophet stood and
[1:07:10] said her great talent and gift now God
[1:07:14] has called home her Daddy went before
[1:07:17] her and her mama went before her this is
[1:07:21] what came to me the other day brother
[1:07:23] Daryl when you call me and told me that
[1:07:24] sister Judy was
[1:07:26] gone and he says Mom and
[1:07:29] Daddy call their
[1:07:32] baby
[1:07:35] home so we know then when we cross that
[1:07:39] River we don't have to cross it
[1:07:41] screaming
[1:07:43] hollowing as if we are
[1:07:46] lost but the Lord God sends someone down
[1:07:50] by the river for
[1:07:52] us and whenever they look beyond the
[1:07:55] curtain
[1:07:56] and they step out as it were of The Old
[1:07:58] Ship of
[1:08:00] Zion there those loved ones
[1:08:02] appear by now no doubt she's already met
[1:08:05] her daddy her mama her loved ones people
[1:08:09] here in the church that she's
[1:08:12] fellowshipped
[1:08:13] with no doubt she's already met my
[1:08:16] little
[1:08:17] girl that just passed over in
[1:08:22] October and if I could ask either of
[1:08:24] them tonight
[1:08:26] would they want to come back no no doubt
[1:08:30] brother Homer Arnold's already met her
[1:08:31] and they done embrac and my precious
[1:08:36] sister my precious
[1:08:39] brother oh and think of it they're not
[1:08:43] going anywhere they're in no
[1:08:46] hurry they don't have really anything to
[1:08:48] do on their
[1:08:49] schedule they're just there waiting
[1:08:52] under the
[1:08:54] altar but is this the
[1:08:56] end will we never see her
[1:08:59] again well you see that
[1:09:03] entirely depends upon
[1:09:05] you I will see her again because I have
[1:09:09] the same
[1:09:10] preparation but you will only see her
[1:09:13] again if you have the same preparation
[1:09:15] she does I always Marvel when I preach
[1:09:18] funerals and people will cry and they
[1:09:20] will lament over that lost loved one oh
[1:09:23] we don't want you to go we don't want
[1:09:24] you to go please don't leave we don't
[1:09:26] want you to go and yet they make no
[1:09:29] preparation to see them again I guess I
[1:09:33] don't understand that kind of
[1:09:34] love it looks like to me if we really
[1:09:37] really loved
[1:09:38] them we would want to be with them
[1:09:43] forever you hear
[1:09:45] me
[1:09:48] forever the life our sister has entered
[1:09:51] into she will never have an ache or a
[1:09:55] pain
[1:09:56] or a
[1:09:57] sorrow or a broken heart she has faced
[1:10:01] man's greatest
[1:10:05] fear and she laughed in death's
[1:10:10] face no doubt she knew it was coming the
[1:10:14] Grim Reaper as we call it
[1:10:18] came he must
[1:10:20] be he must still get
[1:10:23] confused because he's he's took billions
[1:10:28] of people down this alley this
[1:10:32] Avenue called
[1:10:35] deaths but there's some he just don't
[1:10:39] understand
[1:10:40] them he he he took them years ago in the
[1:10:44] Roman coliseums and the
[1:10:47] Arenas when the lines were taking their
[1:10:50] claws and tearing their bows out when
[1:10:54] they would
[1:10:56] take their head and cut it off
[1:10:59] and Nero would take these Christians and
[1:11:02] have their bodies dipped in Pitch tar t
[1:11:06] a
[1:11:06] r and put them up on a
[1:11:10] cross and light them so he could walk
[1:11:13] through his garden at
[1:11:15] night with illuminated human
[1:11:18] bodies and them children of God not
[1:11:22] recanting not fearful Young imagine when
[1:11:25] that Grim Reaper that angel of death
[1:11:28] comes and he comes into a hospital room
[1:11:30] or a hospice room or by a
[1:11:33] bedside and he looks at him and thinks
[1:11:37] oh no not another one of
[1:11:40] them what is wrong with these
[1:11:44] people I've been with Kings and
[1:11:46] presidents and governors and Mayors and
[1:11:49] guys that work for the CIA and the
[1:11:52] Marine Corps and the Army and the
[1:11:54] military scream and and clinch their
[1:11:57] fists and bite their teeth together when
[1:12:00] they come to die and then I've seen
[1:12:03] little old frail
[1:12:05] grandmothers that were
[1:12:08] nobody's and they would look me in the
[1:12:10] face and say come
[1:12:12] on do what you need to
[1:12:16] do cuz you are not my
[1:12:20] master but I am
[1:12:23] yours so come on you know what death is
[1:12:28] it's like your
[1:12:30] vehicle your vehicle brought you to this
[1:12:32] service tonight so you went out push the
[1:12:35] button or crank the key whichever yours
[1:12:37] is you got in that vehicle pulled it
[1:12:40] down and drive and it drove you here in
[1:12:44] a little bit you'll be going back in it
[1:12:46] taking you the same way that's all death
[1:12:49] is to a child of God we stand there and
[1:12:53] look at it and say hey
[1:12:56] I am not
[1:12:57] afraid of
[1:13:01] you let me
[1:13:04] close the question is for those of us
[1:13:07] who are alive
[1:13:09] tonight when you face man's greatest
[1:13:13] fear how will you face it will you be
[1:13:17] screaming begging for
[1:13:19] mercy or will you be like sister chy
[1:13:22] you'll breathe and
[1:13:28] the time will lapse and lapse between
[1:13:32] another and then
[1:13:45] finally they didn't see it but her
[1:13:50] soul went out of her
[1:13:52] body into another dimension
[1:13:57] and there she's waiting for us
[1:13:59] tonight let's bow our heads if you
[1:14:04] would Lord Jesus we are so
[1:14:09] grateful truly it's a
[1:14:12] Marvel Adam was
[1:14:15] terrified to stand in your
[1:14:17] presence yet since you came to the Earth
[1:14:20] and gave your life and redeemed us from
[1:14:25] the fear of
[1:14:26] death millions of your
[1:14:29] children have not faced you in a garden
[1:14:33] but they faced man's greatest
[1:14:38] fear some of them were shot some of them
[1:14:42] were
[1:14:43] burned some of them died by diseases
[1:14:46] plagues
[1:14:48] pestilences but no matter how they faced
[1:14:51] him they all had the same attitude
[1:14:55] because you took the fear
[1:14:57] away I we thank you for the life of our
[1:15:01] sister
[1:15:02] father I pray for her family her friends
[1:15:07] the church family here
[1:15:11] Lord I was so
[1:15:14] startled a couple of months ago and
[1:15:18] maybe six weeks ago when she came up for
[1:15:21] prayer I hadn't seen her for a little
[1:15:23] bit but she came up and then sister kson
[1:15:27] came up behind
[1:15:28] her as I saw sister Judy walk up to the
[1:15:32] altar
[1:15:33] here I just could not get over how
[1:15:37] much that she looked like her
[1:15:41] mother and I told Carol after the
[1:15:43] service it just shocked
[1:15:45] me how much she looked like her
[1:15:49] mother but I realized after she passed
[1:15:52] the other
[1:15:53] day she looks more like her mother now
[1:15:57] than she ever
[1:16:00] has no doubt it was
[1:16:03] them that met her down at the
[1:16:06] river and when she stepped out of that
[1:16:08] Old Ship of Zion as we
[1:16:11] say they run to greet
[1:16:14] her and they looked at each other and
[1:16:17] they were about the same
[1:16:20] age cuz there aren't any old people
[1:16:23] there no one with gray hair no one
[1:16:27] that's humped over because of
[1:16:30] age Lord Jesus I pray that you'd help
[1:16:33] each of us we're still on this side of
[1:16:36] the chasm of
[1:16:37] death help us that we will Choose
[1:16:41] Wisely May there never be a preacher
[1:16:44] that'll stand and repeat our words that
[1:16:48] we said oh God oh God no I'm lost I'm
[1:16:52] lost but may our words be come Lord
[1:16:56] Jesus I'm ready May there be words that
[1:17:01] even in our deaths will testify we have
[1:17:05] a risen
[1:17:06] savior granted father we pray in the
[1:17:10] name of the Lord Jesus

[1:26:53] time in prayer
[1:26:58] heavenly
[1:27:01] father I'm reminded of the words of the
[1:27:04] Prophet when he said how you changed
[1:27:08] your
[1:27:11] strain to
[1:27:14] come and take on the image of a man
[1:27:19] Flesh and
[1:27:21] Blood Sorrows weariness pain sure
[1:27:25] there's joy in there there's Elation
[1:27:28] there's
[1:27:30] excitement but Lord that flesh
[1:27:32] eventually had to
[1:27:35] die and if you
[1:27:37] did how are we going to escape
[1:27:41] it the only way that I know father is to
[1:27:45] take on that
[1:27:47] image that you've so freely given to
[1:27:52] us and oh God it's time Marches On we'll
[1:27:55] gather again in settings like
[1:27:57] these to say
[1:28:01] goodbye our memories will be
[1:28:05] flooded be so Paramount of what we
[1:28:09] recall about that one that's gone on
[1:28:12] they've loosed their Moorings from
[1:28:15] time and all the trappings of
[1:28:19] time and oh God if they could look back
[1:28:23] as it were and have have a voice to
[1:28:25] penetrate time to where we would be able
[1:28:28] to hear
[1:28:29] them I'm sure sister Judy would say
[1:28:32] something like as we just read in the
[1:28:34] poem don't
[1:28:35] grieve I'm just gone from your
[1:28:39] sight but oh if you could only see what
[1:28:41] I'm seeing
[1:28:43] now if you could only feel what I'm
[1:28:46] feeling
[1:28:48] now come on come to where I
[1:28:52] am take on the identity of that one who
[1:28:55] changed his
[1:28:56] strain that's what I chose to
[1:29:00] do so father if there's some sitting
[1:29:02] here tonight that don't know you in that
[1:29:04] way I just pray that you'd grip their
[1:29:07] hearts oh God if they've been playing
[1:29:10] around on you father may you turn them
[1:29:12] back as that prodigal or maybe it would
[1:29:15] be someone that's sitting by a well as
[1:29:17] that woman did that day she had no clue
[1:29:22] that eternal life exist existed within
