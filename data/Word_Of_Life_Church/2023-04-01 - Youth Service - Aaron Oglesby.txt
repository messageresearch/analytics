[Music] [Music] [Applause] I could sing like sister at least I'd never shut up let's Stand Together foreign [Music] to come when we was in the old church that's where they're going to come evidently it wasn't his time and you know we've we've asked him to come this time and you know Satan's been hitting him different directions like he's trying to stop him Satan will always try to stop a work of God whether it be a young person's life a person's life it's a steal of soul so tonight whenever there comes you have your need however many people is here you have a need in your heart your meat can be met it don't have to be laying up on the hands of praying brother Daryl could pray for you brother could pray for you Billy Rock could pray for you laying on hands but God can meet your needs sitting there pulling on the word as you're pulling on the word put that need before God never does anything in vain he didn't sing sinned by the Aaron Pierre test in vain there's a reason for everything God does and God gets glory for everything that he does so tonight if you [Music] you could be 100 people in here however he's in here 100 different needs and when the word comes out one message can meet 100 needs in 100 different ways that's right so pull on your knee to for your need tonight don't leave leave here if you leave here without without getting your need met that's not on brother Aaron that's not on God so let's get ourselves out of the way we pray Lord help the minister get out of the way and we rely on that ministers rely on that getting out of the way because it's not their place to talk to you it's God's but it's your place to get out of the way let that that God that's in brother Aaron but Aaron's going to get a side he's going to let God speak to you to your need to the god in you so as we go forward tonight keep brother Aaron in your prayer he's going he's going through a whole lot I'll let him tell you that but let's uh let's sing help brother Jesse sing Amazing Grace is Valerian comes [Music] how sweet now let's see glorious like me [Music] [Music] I was seeing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that's it ignorance like me [Music] I want monster

God how many is here to praise God tonight amen you can take your seats for just a moment amen it's wonderful to have this opportunity to stand before you I'm so thankful once again to be invited back even though it didn't work out last time as brother Joe mentioned we don't believe things happen for accident we believe that God's hands is in these things and when we see the enemy come against us and try to stop us we know that God has something great in store for us and um you know I do I do want to just I know everybody's heard and shared with you and I want to say thank you for your prayers as as our family goes through this time but uh I was with my dad on Monday and had a nice conversation with him and we kind of had an idea of where things had turned and uh he looked at me and he said whatever happens do not cancel your trip this weekend he said you you go when you do your job and so I had the opportunity to speak with him Wednesday next to his bedside and knelt down next to him and he was on a lot of morphine and things and couldn't really speak but I let him know I said dad I'm going and I want you to know I love you and he was able to mouth back to me I love you too so listen young people you matter you matter a lot you know that when men and and their dying days once their eyes are set on eternity they begin to think about eternal things and he said no matter what happens you make sure you go and and so what we're here and we are we are sad by the loss but I know where my daddy is and his his life was surrendered to the Lord and so I'm I'm I'm thankful for that and I have a piece in it and before we start in in just a moment we'll stand and read the word I do just want to take a moment and just say some things to you that I never take it for granted when I have the opportunity to to speak to young people of this message because I believe with all my heart that you're the finest young people in the world this message produces the best it produces the best and you know and I know many times many times maybe we don't tell you but I want you to know that I'm proud to be associated with you I'm I'm proud to be associated with the with the young people that I believe are going to be standing on this Earth and when the Rapture strikes and when the body change comes and I believe that I'm looking at a portion of that people here tonight and I'm proud of you and I'm proud to be Associated I'm I'm proud to be in the fight with you you know I know we preach we preach the Holy Ghost and you got to have the token and you're going to hear some of that tonight and we believe that and we're not going to stop preaching that but along the way sometimes I've dealt with a lot of young people that because they haven't come to that place yet they feel like a total failure and I want to tell you tonight that wherever you're at if you're in the battle I'm proud of you if you've reached justification I want to celebrate that justification tonight and if you've reached sanctification I want to celebrate that sanctification but I want to tell you there's more keep going keep going and press for more and if you've received the Holy Ghost there's more keep going press for another refill and press for more of God there's always more of God to be had but but I want you to know that wherever you're at if you're standing in the battle tonight I'm proud to draw swords and I'm proud to stand next to you and fight the enemy because we have one common enemy and we have one common Lord and Savior and I believe that we're at a place today where I need you and you need me and we need each other you know we we our salvation and things like that we understand is worked out as individuals but I can't go on the Rapture until you're ready if your name's on that book and I believe it is so I need you and you need me and I want us to all do our part to be ready to go amen so I want you to know that I love you with the love of the Lord I appreciate this opportunity I appreciate brother Donnie having confidence to invite me to be here tonight so without any more let's turn to the word tonight if you'll stand with me and open to the to the Book of Joshua the second chapter and we have a little bit of a a reading here but it's gonna lay the foundation for what we want to speak on tonight and you know I told brother Joe in the back I said this thought might be a little bit heavy so uh I'll just ask you tonight as we go through this to open your hearts and be willing to be honest with yourself you know we're in this we you know for many years I coached ball and we'd get to practice some days and you'd see kids maybe loafing a little bit or not giving it their all and I say look we've already did the hardest part we showed up now let's don't waste the fact that we're here you did went through the effort of being here tonight so don't don't waste the effort give it everything you got lock in and allow the Lord to speak to you and be honest with yourself tonight Joshua the second chapter the first verse says in Joshua the son of nuns sent out of shouldom two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house named Rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of Jericho saying behold there came men in hither tonight of the children of Israel to search out the country and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they become to search out all the country and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but I wish not once they were and it came to pass about the time of shedding of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went I what not pursue after them quickly for you shall overtake them but she had brought them up unto the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the Fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto unto them upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants attempts of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan Zion and OGG whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts didn't melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brother and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our our lives from death and the men answered her our life for yours if you utter not this our business and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall and she said unto them get you to the mountains lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourself there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward you may go your way and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet threat in the window which thou just let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him I want you to notice it won't be the messenger's fault if you don't do what they told you to do they're letting you know look if you do this you'll be saved but if you don't it's not our fault we've told you exactly what you have to do verse 20 and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou has made us to swear and she said according unto your word so be it and she went she sent them away and they departed and she bound the Scarlet line in the window let's pray together gracious Heavenly Father Lord we stand here Lord humbled Lord at the sight of of these young people Lord a portion lord of the price that Lord that you purchased there at Calvary these are those that you died for and Lord we don't take this lightly as we stand here and speak to them Lord what we recognize Lord as we stand here is that we really don't have anything to offer them Lord Lord that we need you to come and take control and take this vessel and move me out the way and calm my nerves and settle my spirit Lord and just allow me to to allow you to speak Lord I pray if there be a single heart here that doesn't know you or hasn't gone all the way with you that tonight would be that night Lord that Lord they can break through the lies and the hindrances that the enemy has put upon them Lord that they can recognize Lord that there is a message of Freedom that there is a blood Lord there is an atonement that is for them Lord we ask you to have your way and that you'll speak to every heart and Lord May there be freedom in the house of God now may every hindrance spirit and anything that would try to hinder this service we bind it now in the name of Jesus and we give you Liberty to speak father in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats amen we just want to get right into it tonight and I want to start with asking you a simple question and if we were to title this tonight it would be the title of our message but the question is what's hidden what's hidden I want you as we go through this ask this in your own life what is hidden what is it you're hiding because all of us have hidden something in our lives every single one of us our our story today is going to revolve around a great victory it's going to revolve around two people hiding things both of them are part of the same battle they both come from opposite directions but they end up at the same place and they're both going to hide things and both of their stories are going to have very different outcomes and the outcome is going to be determined by what's hidden what it was that they chose to hide on this day it was a little bit different than most days there in the city of Jericho sure they had mighty walls that surrounded them so tall and so thick they seem to be impenetrable they they most of the time felt safe other armies had had come before and tried to take the city and yet they had failed and every time they'd come these walls had stood the test but something was different today there was a different nervousness in the city and everyone is scared in the city and moving about with a different energy and there's Whispers And and people know that that something's different and they're scared because there are reports that the Israelites are getting closer there's nervousness in the place and like I said armies had come before and armies had failed but this time it was different because the reports that the people of the city were hearing were different from any reports they'd ever heard before the testimonies that was come out of this Camp was different from the testimonies that they had heard before they that they had heard reports of other people coming and when they had came they had failed but but what they hear about this people is that their God is going before them and that their God is giving them victory over every obstacle that rising in front of them over every King that has risen up in front of them and they're hearing these reports and as Rahab said there in verse 11 she said their hearts have melted and their courage is gone you know that's a little bit different story from what the devil's been telling you this week isn't it that you're not good enough that you're not going to make it that you're never going to amount to anything that you can't be forgiven that you've Fallen too many times or or maybe that you've crossed the line actually the truth of the matter is the devil knows that he cannot stand before you he knows that he can't stand before you because the reports coming out of this people is different from the reports that they've heard before brother Branham says a very familiar quote here he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army now the the key here in this line is that he knows and his goal is to make sure that you don't know that's why the constant attacks that's why the fear that's why the anxiety that's why you're not good enough trying to keep you beat down keep you beat down because he knows and the last thing he can do is let you know because once you know he says you're going to be an invincible Army I want to tell you something tonight I'm looking at a people that are part of an invincible Army the world may look at you as some kind of backwash or Outcast or nobody but our God says you're an invincible Army and the devil's says I know that if they find out who they really are they will be an invincible Army and so that's why these attacks come he wants you to be afraid of him but I'd like to declare tonight that the enemy has heard the reports this group of young people is different from you groups in the past this group has broken free from Egypt and nothing that gets in their way has stopped them the Red Sea rose up they went through it the serpents came out in the wilderness they kept going they needed food God reigned it down from heaven this group of young people is different from groups before lust Spirits they conquered them pornography they've conquered them suicide Spirits they've conquered them whatever has risen up before this people they have conquered them and the devil says and they're still coming and they're getting closer oh Hallelujah I'm telling you as we get closer to the final strongholds of the enemy he knows his walls can't hold you he knows he can't keep you here and he is scared of you the enemy is scared of you tonight Hallelujah and he knows that he can't stop you so what he tries to do is he tries to get you to stop yourself he tries to get you to doubt what you've been called to he tries to bring a negative report out of your mouth or set a negative Vision in front of you the way he did there at kadish barnia Twitter became a negative report well we just can't do it we just ain't gonna be able to make it and if he can get you not to see who you are if he can get you doubt on what you've been called to but tonight I believe there's some Joshua and calebs raising up in this generation that says I don't care who falls away I don't care who goes this way or that you're going to give me my Mountain I've been called to a body change I've been called to a Rapture I've been called to do more than just be a church member here in Johnson City Tennessee have been called to more than that I've been called to be a part of an invincible Army that tears down the final strongholds of the enemy that's who you are that's what you're called to Don't Stop short don't settle don't listen to his report this report says you're going to make it this report says you're an overcomer Hallelujah brother Branham says all the country is afraid of you when we heard that the Lord dried up the Red Sea and let you cross drown Pharaoh's Army give you food by man out of the Wilderness put a brass serpent up for an atonement he'd done all these things for you and I know what you've done destroying OG and the other kings I've seen what you did utterly destroyed and when we heard this and you were headed our way we just fainted there's no more courage left in no one Church you're fighting a defeated enemy you're fighting an enemy that's already given up you're fighting one who knows you're gonna win if you will keep fighting the one thing he tries to get you to do is lay your sword down and think there's no hope he is the one tonight with no hope he is the one that was stripped of every right he ever had that day on Calvary it's been restored to you and I'm just telling you just keep going you're going to win just keep pressing the battle you're gonna make it you're not gonna quit you're not gonna fail you're not gonna give in oh this one failed I thought he was strong this ain't about this one this is about you and what you're called to and I'm telling you you're gonna make it you're gonna overcome you're going to be standing there I choose to believe that tonight and it's time that we start taking the word and saying that's who I am that's what I'm called to Hallelujah [Applause] Rahab had been a woman of the streets for many years and brother Branham says it's a life that she had been forced into he says let's picture her this morning for a few minutes as a young lady a beautiful young woman who some Misfortune in life had been forced into being the pagan had been forced into the life that she was living and many times people are forced into the life that they live you know maybe you can relate tonight maybe you're in a place where you don't really want to be at in life maybe you didn't see yourself struggling at this point in life maybe you hadn't went as far down the road as you thought you should be maybe the devil's taking you down roads into places you never thought you'd go lied to you and convince you that you're worthless that the sins you've done can never be forgiven that you've crossed the line that you're not good enough and that people don't really care but tonight an opportunity comes knocking it says maybe you were forced into this life maybe you didn't have much Choice maybe the devil's forced you this way but tonight there's a message of Deliverance that says as the walls fall you don't have to perish when the walls come down and I'm telling you the walls of this world are crumbling faster than the walls of Jericho but there's a place of safety tonight and he's offering that to you saying you haven't gone too far you haven't crossed the line he's here tonight saying I died for you that scarlet cord is for you surrender your everything to me tonight and you can have a place of safety it's a message of Deliverance and the Bible tells us that the spies came into her house and and whether it be that she still practice a life of harlotry or or maybe at this point she ran an end as many believed but either way the fact is to see men and come to to come and go from her house would not have been an odd thing this was this would have been a common occurrence but what's amazing to me is that these men going into her house stood out they didn't fit in with the rest of Jericho I want to ask you tonight if that's your testimony as you walk through this evil world and go places look it's not uncommon to see people walk in Walmart it's not uncommon to see people walk wherever you go shopping in this store in that store and stop at Starbucks but when you stop at those places do you stand out or you're someone that people notice because these people went into a harlot's house or into the end and people's coming and going all day but when they saw these men they said something's different we know these people don't belong here and I want that to be our testimony is I don't know what it is but these people right here don't belong here they're from somewhere else and I want to testify you're right you nailed me you got me pegged I don't belong here I'm just passing through and and they notice these and it isn't long until the king sends word and says give the men to us we know that they are spies and In This Moment Rahab which is one of the the most important moments in our whole story she recognizes her opportunity young people it's extremely important that you recognize your opportunities you Matthew speaks in not Matthew excuse me Jesus speaks in Luke 19 and he's speaking about the destruction of Jerusalem and he says It Came Upon them because they didn't recognize their time of visitation recognizing your opportunities is is of vital importance there is many people who walked into the presence of Jesus they didn't come out change because they didn't recognize what was going on how many times do you gather here in this place on a Wednesday night or on a Sunday or on a youth service and Jesus Christ moves through this place and we don't recognize our opportunities we got to get Beyond it's just church or it's just brother Donnie or it's just brother Joe or brother Daryl I said that's not what it is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords comes down to commune with you to speak to you to set you free and and to change your life in those moments we have to recognize this isn't just a church service this is an eternal opportunity to be changed forever to be delivered forever to be set free forever this is an opportunity I don't want to let it pass me by I don't want to miss this moment in this presence and in that moment you've got to grab hold to it and Rahab recognizes her opportunity this is her chance at life this is her chance at life she may not get another chance this is it this is that one listen more than ever I want you to understand you don't know when your last chance is we're not here to preach fear and those I don't care who who we're talking to we don't know I don't know you don't know don't pass an opportunity look into another opportunity grab each and every opportunity as it comes your way and she decides she's going to be all in she's going to be all in this is her moment she recognizes her opportunity and she holds nothing back I pray that each one of us will recognize our opportunity tonight wherever we're at whatever our need is I need I need him tonight I recognize tonight I need you this is my opportunity in your presence Lord and In This Moment without ever witnessing a thing that's the amazing thing about Rahab brother Branham deals with this she had not witnessed a miracle she had not been there when the Red Sea opened she had never met Joshua she had never met Moses come on young people you can relate in some ways you know we've told you a lot of stories about brother brown but there aren't many people in here can say they ever met him she had never met Joshua but she heard and she believed without witnessing a miracle without stepping into the presence of the messenger per se she was willing to risk it all brother Branham says she never said I'll believe when I see a great anointed Joshua do some sign if I could have seen Moses do some of the signs I would have believed but she said I have heard Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word I have heard that the god of Heaven which is the real God is with you and he's done great signs and wonders he dried up the Red Sea he brought plagues from Egypt listen I dare say that everybody in this room has witnessed more than Rahab had ever witnessed she was heathen she never had the opportunity to sit in a church service sit there while songs were sung and brother Harry played the organ and the spirit moved and to feel the Holy Spirit move through a place she never experienced that she didn't come from a Godly home where parents prayed for and tried to steer her in the right direction as a matter of fact she had been pushed out of her home by her parents you have experienced and have had greater opportunity than Rahab Rahab only having heard do we take for granted the opportunities that we have to hear Time After Time After Time to fill his presence to be told she was told one time and it was her one chance and in this moment she takes a hold of it she says I want to live oh if there be a young people here tonight to say I want to live I want to live I recognize the death that's all around me but Lord I just want to live and she says in this moment she says I want to live I don't care what I have to give up I don't care who makes fun I don't care who mocks I don't care what friends I have to leave behind whatever it takes I just want to live I recognize in this moment I want life I believe this is a real living God I believe these testimonies to be true I know that I know that it's getting closer I know that it's getting closer and in this moment of life and death she has to make a decision the king who she has served up until this point oh come on we've all had those kings but that King sends a message and says give me the men give me The Messengers let's bring it down he says give me the message you've received turn it loose turn loose of what's been given to you turn loose of the opportunities you've been given Satan says turn it over to me I'll trade you some things come on let go of those opportunities give me the message you hear just doubt it a little bit just turn it over to me give it to me and you have the opportunity you got a decision to make am I going to listen to the king that's led me to this place or am I going to listen to this message this opportunity the one that's offering me deliverance and he says give it to me give it to me and it's a life and death situation and she makes a decision Joshua 2 verse 3 in the king of Jericho Senator Rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee life and death hangs in the balance in this moment Rahab was risking way more than some mocking she was risking way more than walking down the street dressed different people going she was risking way more than losing a couple friends this was a life and death situation she's lying to the king she gets caught she's going to be put to death her family is going to be put to death this is this isn't a a an easy matter and In This Moment she makes her decision she says I'll make a trade I'll make a trade I'm gonna hide them I'm going to spare them I'm going to give them their life though I risk death I'm going to give them the life but I want to promise I want a promise in return that I'm going to receive life listen young people there's a promise for you tonight there is a promise for you tonight she says I want a promise you got to promise me that I wanna I won't utter any of this I'll hide this message but you got to promise me that there's gonna be life and you got to recognize tonight whatever I have to give up whatever I have to do he's already come and made the promise he's already done his part he's already proved to be faithful he's already proved to be true he's already established his side of the Covenant and he's saying will you hide it will you hide me in your heart will you take my word will you hold on to this message it's life to you will you make that trade tonight you can imagine it's an opportunity tonight to make a trade and I tell you whatever you're asked to give up whatever you're asked to do will never compare to what you get in return oh listen this exchange rate is wonderful what a wonderful exchange rate we have in the Lord Jesus my sins my failures my shortcomings everything I've done wrong for his life for his righteousness For Eternity for life I can trade in this my failures time after time I've come up short and he says it's okay I'll trade you tonight I'll trade you for eternal life and he offers that trade tonight amen amen and in return I get eternity I get eternity Rahab says this is my chance I pray there's young people are not recognizing this is my chance I've heard of his power I've seen him cast out Devils I've seen him overcome in other people's life but he promised me I can be saved listen testimonies are awesome are awesome testimonies are amazing and we love them and they build our faith but the point of them is so that you understand what he can do for you the point of testimonies from the past ain't to talk about what God did in the past and so you'll know what he can do today let's quit leaving it in the past where God delivered this one oh and I get so thankful we come back many times and I hear young people who I know need deliverance and yet they'll come back from a camp just Rejoice singing oh you should have seen this one get delivered you should have seen that get delivered and I rejoice in it too but in the midst of it you were so worried about what they needed it's time for some of you to grab a hold of what it is you need it's some of you to grab a hold and say Lord in this moment I want to make a trade I want eternal life I want deliver it from the things that has kept me I want to surrender my all and let your story be the story of testimony that's told she recognized I can be saved but she knew she had to have a token young people tonight there is a token that is required and whatever you have to do whether you have to constrain him whatever you have to do you make sure tonight you leave here and you have that token I'll constrain him I'll do whatever it takes but Lord I'm not leaving out of here the same I'm not leaving out of here wondering you know he told us he said in that day you shall know you don't have to guess anymore you don't have to be guessed where will I think I met the Lord you know something no listen I want to know that I know that I know that I know and in the word he came and he said in that day you shall know you have the opportunity to know tonight you can get that that token get it applied get it displayed and you can leave here with such a peace you can walk out with no fear of death no fear of the Rapture no fear of hell no one is displayed it's finished he's faithful he's true it's a done work I say finish the work tonight young people drive the anchor down tonight drive a steak down be willing to do whatever you've got to do but I must have that token no matter what and so risking her life she hides The Messengers on her roof brother Joe is there some water somewhere thank you buddy risking her life she hides The Messengers and but more importantly she hid their message in her heart not just the messengers but she takes that message and from this point on the only thing that matters to her was the message that had been delivered to her by the Messengers I must have that token displayed I must have my loved ones under the token if I apply this they're all going to live from this point on everything else from her past life was meaningless and this is where we've been trying to get to for a little bit now from this point on everything from her past life is meaningless her money her old worldly garments her lifestyle done because see now she recognizes that those things are associated with death those things are associated with the destruction that is coming and now her Focus was on life let me just deal with some little nitty-gritty things little small things that I know sometimes people deal with they're not really small things but all of a sudden cutting her hair wasn't something she wanted to do anymore all of a sudden that little bit of makeup she wanted to wear didn't seem like a big deal that had always seemed like a big deal now she recognized that's associated with death that's associated with what I was she's willing to make a clean break there revealing clothes that she shouldn't be wearing she no longer wants any part of that because her focus is now on life and no longer associated with the things of her past worldly music come on now I know I was there matter of fact and I don't ever talk this way I don't I don't ever like to give glory to the devil but we're going to be honest and real tonight when I was your age I wasn't living right so I know what the battles are I know what the attacks are I've been a school teacher for 15 years I know how he still comes after you I know the music is still the way he comes in and attacks and tries to draw you and tries to pull on you brother Branham didn't call those things out for no reason talk about it Gathering people to the battle of Armageddon the worldly music she no longer wanted that because it was associated with death violent video games the movies ungodly relationships those things no longer matter to Rahab because she knew those things are associated with death and she recognized that Association and she makes a a clean break from it tonight and I want to tell you that whatever it is that has tried to hold on to you whatever it is that tries to identify you with that life you got to make a clean break from it she recognized if I'm going to be someone different I can't still have things that would tie me back to that still attached to my life I can't still have that thing and claim I've Been Changed come on somebody you can't claim I had an experience and I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and yet your life is still attached to Jericho there has to be a willingness to change listen I know there's many different ways of looking at it but one of the main things I look at with young people as far as an Evidence of a change in their life is that their appetite has completely changed suddenly there is a hunger for the word there is a hunger for the things of God they're drawn to the things of life and they take a break away from those things not a temporary break but a clean break cut off by the word of the Lord and they no longer desire those things it's not a I wish I could but I can't it's those things are death and they will have no part in me that's where Rahab was she's recognizing that those things are death and now she's come to a place where all she wants is life all she wants is to be free all she wants is her past to be completely erased and she prepares exactly how they told her too she binds the scarlet cord out the window and she gets her family inside and and she acts on the message here's something we have to be doers not just hearers there's a lot of people can quote the message up one side and down the other and they don't live it for nothing she did more than just hide the messengers and she did more than tell people about the message she acted upon the message that was given her she acted upon it she put the cord where she was told to do it she followed the instructions because she recognized this message is Vindicated there is a God of Miracles that has backed this up and she recognized I have to be a doer of what I've been told you have to take the message and act upon it and she knows that nothing from the old life is going to be able to go with her nothing from the old life young people can go with you all that mattered now to Rahab was the message she would receive Prophet God says it like this and this young woman after she'd got her first hearing of Israel and of a God who was a God that answered prayer not only a God to pray too but a God that answered back when she heard that there was a god of Miracles who could perform Miracles who dried up the Seas and reigned bread out of Heavens her heart began to tremble and when she got her first message from the two preachers that went over quickly she accepted it with all her heart and there was a scarlet cord bound at her window for a protection of her house because she had received the message and she attacks and gathers up everything that she had from that life it didn't mean anything to her she knew she couldn't take it with her and she takes it all and she just opens up a cabinet she knows she's not going to be staying there long and she throws it all in a cabinet brother Daryl shuts it she's leaving it behind she's taking nothing with her it was basically her life earnings it was a Babylonian garment once given his payment 200 shekels of silver and one wedge of gold and she leaves it is nothing more to her now we're going to change the scene and over in the Israelite Camp about this same time they're also receiving a message and it's exact instructions from their messenger God tells Joshua and Joshua 6 and 2. and the Lord said to Joshua see I have given Jericho into your hand with its king and Mighty Men of Valor I have given Jericho into your hand with the king and the Mighty Men of Valor young people he's already given you the victory he's already given you the victory all the spirits they're already in your hand they're already conquered they're King already conquered all you have to do is follow instructions he says I've already done it I've already conquered it all you got to do is follow the directions it is simple except for as human beings it's not one of my biggest frustrations as a school teacher for years was did you read the directions like literally it was a sentence how did you totally mess this up so bad oh I didn't read that guys it's been laid out very plain in this day more than ever before we have no excuse to not know what we're supposed to do the instructions have been laid out all you have to do is follow directions he tells them here in this scripture Victory is already yours just listen to the message act on the message do what you're told to do follow the instructions and take those instructions and put them into action and so he's told that you already get this and I can't I don't want to leave this right now just because I I know who I'm dealing with Young Folks especially some some older folks too I get it I get it we want everything to make sense we want it all to be able to add up and well what about this and what about that well why do I have to do this why did Brother Branham say we have to do this why listen I don't know why I'm telling you the battle plan is if you'll just follow the directions you're going to win if you'll just do what the messenger told you to do you're going to overcome the stronghold in your life is going to fall but you got to follow the directions you got to do what the messenger told you to do oh well this doesn't make sense and that doesn't make sense and maybe that was just brother branham's opinion come on now that don't make sense how much sense did it make to walk around the wall all those times silence and then shout and the wall is going to fall down it didn't matter it wasn't your plan it's his plan and he said this is what you're going to do to win the Victory and it doesn't matter if it all makes sense this is what you gotta do to win the victory just stick with the instructions just follow the plan just hide the message in your heart and the walls in your life are going to come down it didn't matter if it made sense it was his plan it was his victory and he's teaching them that my way is the only way you're going to have victory my way is the best way listen you're not going to take a Rapture doing it your way you are not going to take a body change doing it your way but I have a promise that if we do it his way he ain't going to leave us here if we'll do it his way there is going to be a Rapture and there is going to be young people in that Rapture it ain't just for Mama and Daddy it ain't just preachers and song leaders and deacons there's going to be 12 year olds in the Rapture 15 16 17. it doesn't matter what your age is tonight he's calling you saying just follow the instructions I'm coming it's getting closer don't be nervous there's a scarlet cord you don't got to be shook up like the rest of the world the walls ain't gonna Crush you but you're gonna walk out over these walls delivered set free Hallelujah he's not leaving us behind but you just gotta follow the instructions a message has been sent for your deliverance it's got to be his way we can't try to make everything make sense he said you got to have the token you got to have the Holy Ghost and there is a prescription on how to get that he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive so tonight I'll say it's time we lay down what we think I know that's hard for us to do but we got to lay down what it is we think lay down what it is we feel lay it down what what we reason about the situation lay those things aside tonight and follow the instructions of the word Joshua 6. the instructions are laid out and the plan is carried out and just before they shout there are final instructions Joshua 6 17. and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the Lord only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that are within her house because she hid The Messengers that we sent but you keep yourself from the things devoted to destruction young people we spend way too much time trying to gather up things that are going to be destroyed he says keep yourself from the things devoted to destruction lest when you have devoted them you take a take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for Destruction and bring trouble upon it but all silver and gold and every vessel of bronze and iron are holy to the Lord and they shall go into the treasury of the Lord hearing this message there there was a man of the house of what a lineage it would eventually lead on down to Jesse lead on down to David and of course our lord Jesus this Man's family had lived in Egypt his great-grandfather's name was Sarah his grandfather's name was zabdi his father's name was Carmen they had witnessed the rise of Moses and Aaron combined they had been in the land of Egypt many many years his great-grandfather and his grandfather and his father they had come up and they had seen the rise of Moses and Aaron they had seen the plagues they had seen the Flies they had seen the frogs they had seen the lice and the locusts they had been there the night the death angel moved through the land think about this he had seen the hand of God as he journeyed through the wilderness it's possible that he had at some point as a kid maybe even been bit by a serpent in the wilderness and looked on the brass serpent in order to live he had just come through the River Jordan and seen it completely rolled back seen it dry up and then flow again as Israel crossed into the land and now this man stands on the front lines he's ready to attack Jericho he's ready for the Revival he's ready for this victory he knew that in just a moment Jericho was going to be a mountain of rocks brother Joe and he knows that he was destined to stand on top of those he was destined to be victorious he was raised in the message he had been to all the camp meetings he had seen Devils cast out he had seen people healed he had heard the testimonies he had felt the presence of God he knew who he was he was ready they had marched through the Wilderness all these years and now the promised land lays right in front of them he was filled with the excitement that you might would feel when right before a Revival or right before a youth camp when you can feel victory in the air how many of y'all have been to Louisiana youth camper South Carolina or Ohio or any of those camps and certain Services you're sitting there and you just feel it you just know things are about to happen now this is where he stands he can feel it even more than that maybe the excitement of knowing that we're about to cross over into the promised land because the body changes here you can feel it there's a rapture and he's standing there on the front lines and he's feeling these things and he says within himself I'm ready I'm ready and just then it was time for the shout and Aiken lifted up his voice with all the others and began to shout and Aiken shouts for joy as the walls come down Aiken loved this revival Aiken was a part of this revival he shouted with them and the walls come tumbling down Joshua 6 21 says and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and oxen sheep and ass with the edge of the sword but Joshua had said unto two men that had spotted out the country going to the harlot's house and bring out Vince the woman in all that she hath as she swear as you swear unto her and the young man that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her Brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her Kindred and left them without the camp of Israel and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord I want you to notice that the promise of the token held they went in and they kept their word and sometimes the Devil comes with fear and anxiety I want you to know that this God's going to keep his word he's not going to leave you behind you're not going to be destroyed here you're not going to be crushed here but they go in and they get them all out and they take them without and Aiken charges the walls I want you to picture it for a moment I mean this was a giant City and the walls fall and there's smoke and there's debris and there's sounds of war and he's charging and they're shouting there's fighting going on this is a battle and and you can see the battle rage and the smells of Wars all around him and he's part of Victory Aiken is partaking in the victory he is dancing in the aisles at the camp come on now he's partaking in this Victory and he walks into a home that was right on the wall still standing and he had just witnessed two of his brothers escort the family out naked walks in and he walks into this home and he finds himself all alone young people we do things the way we do things for a reason that's why we don't pair up boy and girls we're dating and go off by herself all along we don't put computers in little isolated nooks and crannies in our house where you can get on them all alone we don't go off with our worldly acquaintances or school friends all along come on now he finds himself all along separated from his brothers during the battle and he begins looking here he begins looking there just curious just wondering wonder what's in this house you know how it is when you're just looking around the internet you're not really doing nothing you're just you're just looking just looking in this window and opening that window and I can't help what pops up come on oh he's just he's just curious he's not doing anything he's just flipping through stations on the radio do y'all still use the radio I don't even know he's just flipping through stations scrolling through looking at this looking at that but not really doing anything wrong but in his heart he was coveting something in your heart when you're doing those things you're coveting something that's cursed and he's just flipping he's just going through and then all of a sudden you open up that window you're actually looking to open all along then you hit that song your ears were wanting to hear all along and I've dealt with this at home let's just be honest for a minute these days you don't have to go look for nothing how many of you have ever watched a reel this guy jokes don't lie how many of you watch a lot of reels just a little clip I mean it's just a little clip most of those clips ain't set to Amazing Grace brother Joe come on now I've had to deal with it with young people even when I hear them just say a few lyrics from something I'll say where'd you hear that it was just a clip I say would you like to know what the next line says would you like to know what you're identifying yourself with would you like to know that that links you to Jericho come on we're just being real tonight Aiken opens up that cabinet they had hoped to find all along and and they're in that moment all along he can't withstand and he takes to himself what God has cursed and he finds a Babylonian garment 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold and being right on the wall it was easy for him to sneak out and return to the camp and hide this in his tent and Aiken hides it in his home same battle Jericho same battle Rahab and Aiken one from a cursed race seemingly destined to die under a pile of rubble one from the tribe of Judah seemingly destined to do it to be a man of renown destined to have his name written in the Bible as a mighty conqueror someone who fought at Jericho and and helped conquer the Promised Land come from two totally different directions and they both received a message it matters what you do with the message you can't just play around with it and think well this part really doesn't matter well that's just brother Donny's opinion on the subject well I don't know listen I know we've dealt with this for a little bit but I want you to understand let's just eliminate it right now if God thought enough to write it down in his Bible or take up space and have the prophet of God in his limited amount of time on this Earth speak about it it matters there we settle the discussion if it's in the word it matters if it comes over the pulpit from your pastor it matters because the point of it is to get you outside the walls is to get you outside Jericho it may not seem like a big deal but when the rocks are falling and the walls are coming down you're going to say thank you Lord for the instructions thank you Lord for the message thank you for a Godly Pastor thank you for a church that stood for truth even though it didn't seem like those little things mattered thank you Judah think about it it doesn't matter what church you go to I know where most of you tonight are from right here and forgive me if I accidentally call it happy valley Word of Life most of you from here there's a few visitors here it doesn't matter where you come from it doesn't it doesn't matter who your daddy is and who your pastor is and it doesn't matter how many Church camps you've been in how many mighty things you felt how many times you felt the spirit move upon your flesh how many victories You've Won all that matter is when it all comes down to it is the token on display did you do what you were told to do did you get the token in place when the time comes will there be any cursed treasure found in your heart for God says Aiken thought this little old wedge it won't make any difference the rest of the ladies are cutting their hair I'll do the same thing it won't make any difference but what did it do it never brought pleasure to his family it brought death to every one of them Joshua told him he said keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction church we hate to talk this way sometimes but the truth is the truth is the truth this world and the things of this world are devoted to destruction and it's getting closer and closer and I'll tell you when I was coming up you didn't talk to nominal Christian people and them speak about the end time the way they do now they used to be like well we don't know when it's going to be it could be 100 200 we don't know but now they're saying something's going on something's happening and I'm telling you if they're noticing where are we to be their notice and you've been told look and people are getting scared and they're running here and and it kind of something to me when message Believers are like what do we do look how bad it's getting look how bad it's getting and I'm like ain't this what we've been expecting this whole time why are you getting worried when you see things come to pass you've been told was going to come to pass I've been told look up my Redemption draweth now I'm telling you don't get scared get in the ark don't get scared get the token apart don't get scared follow the instructions it's gonna be okay little children you're gonna be safe you're gonna make it but just make sure that token is applied you have to run from the things of this Earth you have to run from it I'm telling you it's cursed and the thing is they know it's cursed I'm gonna take a moment here and tell a little story I still got a little bit to go so bear with me but I want to tell this story I feel like it's pertinent because if you're anything like me I struggled with music for years as a young person I was drawn to it I was drawn to it sucked in and and I had good friends and and those friends had a rock band and they were musicians and we'd been raised in the church together but they became musicians drawn to that world and I'm a date myself right here but it was in the era when what was known as the grunge movement had hit real big in the early 90s and and that was I was in Middle School and as I went through high school they got better and better and started playing different places and and they had this one local place in town where they were what you would call the house band they played there every weekend and we thought it was so cool we were so stupid but we thought it was so cool oh yeah yeah and I didn't know how to play music still don't so my part was to literally sit on the stage I was a groupie I guess I don't know and uh I'd hang out every weekend well there was this big name band that was booked to play a big place in Shreveport and somehow I don't know how these things work the Coliseum had double booked on the same night they had booked two concerts and so this band shows up and they're like they have no place to play so they've driven all the way from wherever they came from and they're like what are we gonna do they end up contacting our friend who owns this little facility and says we're going to come play your place and of course us once again being stupid thought this was so cool these are guys are rock stars so they come out and we hang out with them all day and we think it's such a cool thing and this building would probably hold three four hundred people that night there's seven eight hundred people in there and I try to tell this story in a way to not bring any glory to the devil because I think you'll understand that that's not the point of this we're in there man and in our mind we're having a good time they are playing and we're acting stupid and we're in the middle of what they'd call Mosh pits and this it was a manifestation of Hell on Earth is what it was brother Joe maybe and you gotta understand I'm a backslid message kid I know and we're there and they're playing and everybody song gets over and the dude that I think is so cool steps up to the mic bro Joe and we're just cheering we're right I'm right there and he says if you think we're having a good time now just wait till we all get to hell and I'm gonna tell you I went from this kid going yeah huh because I couldn't go that but I do want to stop for a minute and make a point that if they can get that happy and that rejoice and knowing where they're going young people how dare has come to the house of God knowing where we got an opportunity to go and sit on our hands and not worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords they started jumping and shouting and screaming because they was going to hell and I'm here tonight with a message telling you don't have to go to hell you're going to heaven and if you think we're having a good time now you just wait till you see us over there but I'm saying you don't gotta wait you don't gotta wait to praise His name you don't gotta wait to shout but you get that scarlet cord in your life you get that token and you know I'm going to heaven I'm going in a Rapture I can Rejoice there is no cursed treasure in my life make sure it's not there young people make sure it's not there you hide one thing in your heart it's the word of God it's the life of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah they know where they're going so do we we can rejoice in that as we begin to bring this down we find in chapter 7 of Joshua that Israel not knowing of the sin of Aiken goes to Ai and they believe it's going to be an easy victory and yet they're defeated easily and they lose 36 men Joshua doesn't understand this isn't what's supposed to happen why were we not Victorious let's deal with some things because as long as there's sin in your life young people you will not be victorious as long as there's things hidden there you're not going to overcome no matter how much you want to overcome well how come I can't get rid of this Spirit how come I can't overcome this this habit how come I can't overcome this lust how come I can't be filled with the holy spirit because as long as there's something ungodly hidden in your heart you can pray you can fast you can yell and scream you can curse that demon and it'll sit there brother Brown speaking of a woman he says well now what if she's got some hidden sin there somewhere you could pour a gallon of oil on her anoint her as many times jump up and down and scream and that devil will lay right there unconfessed sin you'll never move him no sir I told you tonight you gotta be honest with yourself why am I where I'm at why have I not progressed why am I not deeper in the Lord why am I not overcome why am I not filled with the Holy Ghost what's hidden what's lying there what needs to be dealt with and so they go through the process of casting lots and God shows the the tribe the family the household all the way down until it's discovered what's hidden and when it's all said and done it's aching who has hidden these worldly things in his in his life and they weren't things that he could claim ignorance of they were things your pastor preached to you about all the time they were things the message warned you about all the time things the Pastor said not to do things he heard directly from the lips of the messenger chapter 7 verse 22 says so Joshua sent Messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it and they took out the midst of the tent and brought them under Joshua unto all the children of Israel and laid them out before the Lord in Joshua and all Israel with him took Aiken the son of Zara and the silver and the Garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them into the valley of acor and Joshua said why hast thou troubled us the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire and aft after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of the place was called the valley of acor Unto this day young people when you disobeyed the word of the Lord death lies at the door and one thing I want us to notice tonight you're not going to spend much time on as we're running out of time but your actions affect more than you his Disobedience brought the death of his entire family think about it in your friend groups are you bringing people in is your life and your testimony and your music and the things you're feeding on drawing people in are you getting them under the token or are you the reason they're in the streets when the walls fall it matters the decisions you make it affects those around you chapter 6 verse 23. and the young man that were spies went in I know we've read this but I just want to reinforce this as we come home and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren in all that she had and they brought out all her Kindred and left them without the camp how many of you have loved ones you'd like to see saved how many of you have friends you'd like to see saved by her testimony by her following the message by her putting it in action how many times does our life drive people away from the message oh if that's what the message produces then I don't want anything to do with it come on now but her life brought people into and saved him because of her testimony because she did what she was told to do do not underestimate the power of your influence or nobody looks to me that's not true a lot of eyes are upon you let me move down some friends who make so many decisions based off of what friends might think how they're going to react how they're going to look at us but I want you to know if you were to ever stand before the judgment you're not going to stand there with your boyfriend you're not going to stand there with your girlfriend or your little group of buddies you're going to stand there and answer for your actions and your excuses won't matter you're going to answer to God for what you hid what was hidden what was hidden what did you hide in your heart you know I find it so sad that Aiken owed his very life to the fact that his great-grandfather and his grandfather and his father had obeyed the word of the Lord they had put Blood on the doorpost that's why Aiken was here they had done these things they had looked to the serpent they had gathered up the Manna they had they had marched they had done what they were told to do and yet his entire family now perishes because of his Disobedience to the word now listen this is in no way a sermon about dating and marriage but I can't go past here without saying this do not yoke yourself with someone who is not completely sold out 100 and filled with the Holy Ghost because don't think for a minute that the decisions and the way they lead your home isn't going to lead you and your family a certain direction due to the best of your ability you pray and you seek God and you know that you know is all that you can that this person is dedicated this person is sold out hey I don't care how ugly they are how good they look you better make sure they're filled with the Holy Ghost oh I know we're young people ain't none of us going to marry somebody ugly well you better not think that at least you better love them because of the character that's there and you see a real Godly desire to serve the Lord and you know you can serve the Lord together she don't end up in a situation like Aiken and his and his family ended up in Aiken received a message just like Rahab did but what she was willing to leave behind as we drive this home what she was willing to leave behind he wanted to put in his tent isn't that how it is today you [Applause] they come to the house of God and they get freedom from those things and you see other people walking out the house of God to go pick up the very things that those people were willing to lay down the things they were willing to lay down you leave it all behind and you say I'm done with it it's death to me and you flee from the world and it's cursed treasures and you watch others go the opposite direction they'll leave homes of safety they'll leave homes where they've been LED in prayer they'll leave homes where they've had the message taught to them the Bible read to them and they'll go right out there and pick up those things the instruments of death that others were willing to lay down they go pick them up they bring it into their homes and they bring it in to their lives or what about you God moves in a mighty meeting he's moving through the congregation we've already hit this and this this one's getting delivered and you see it this was delivered and you see it you feel the power of God you even end up there there at an altar and you end up at this place and and the battle is Raging and you know there's victories run the Shadow the king is in the camp and yet somehow you leave that service undelivered you leave there with the same stuff you walked in how do we let that happen you have an opportunity tonight you have an opportunity to make sure there's no cursed treasure found anywhere in you because you cannot have victory and curse treasure too we found that at AI you cannot have victory and cursed treasure you need to take all the things of this world tonight their music their movies Their Stars their ideas your ideas about what matters and what doesn't matter you need to lay it on the altar of God and you need to invite the Holy Spirit to come burn those things out of your life burn those desires burn those wants burn those thoughts burn those ideas lay it there and let the fire of God consume it because I'm telling you it's going to be consumed one day along with those who it is attached to who's going to be burned brother Aaron only those that are attached to the cursed Treasures only those who weren't willing to let it down and hide the Lord in their hearts Prophet says we've got to stay with that word that's the Commandment of God it was not to touch nothing in that City that cursed City don't touch it leave it alone young person here we are at the end and I'm telling you make sure that there's no cursed treasure in your life make sure that you're not dabbling with it make sure that you're not picking it up the stench of the thing will get all over your life the stench of it will affect those in your home your your friends and those near you and it'll it'll bring death to you and to your family and your loved ones but I'm telling you tonight there's an opportunity there's a token there's a chord and I'm telling you if you'll get it displayed there is a promise you will not be crushed under the rubble but when the walls fall you're going to be walking out with the victors you're going to be celebrating you're going in a Rapture I'm telling you tonight it's for you it's not for just others it's for you do you have the token do you have the scarlet cord or is there cursed treasure dragging you down if there is run from it tonight run from it with your whole heart it's not worth where it's going to take you to it's not worth it but tonight he's offering Freedom he's offering the Holy Ghost he's offering a place of repentance and he says tonight you can deal with it tonight you can lay it down Hallelujah what Rahab did in hiding those spots was a death sentence but she knew that if she didn't do it death was coming anyway I'm telling you death is coming but life is offered to you Psalms 119 11 Thy Word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee back to Joshua 7 25 in our closing scripture here and once you think about where you're at I want you to think about the opportunities you have and what you think about the opportunity you have right now I want you to think if the walls fail right now is there anything that is cursed treasure in your life verse 25 and Joshua said why hast thou troubled us the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of acor Unto this day look at that he was never meant to be underneath that pile of stones budget he was destined to be on top of the rubble he had a message that called him not to be under the rocks and here we see the end of Aiken because he just wanted what's wrong with that what's wrong with it my music what's wrong with a little makeup what's wrong with it what's wrong with the with the kiss what's wrong is it shows that the token's not where it's supposed to be it shows that you're still holding on to what you want and that the token's not applied visualize it now I see a young woman her name's Rahab and she walks past this great pile of stones on her way to AI she's new to the camp she knows something just happened she's not sure what it is but if she looks at that she can't help but think that could have been me and my family under there That Could Have Been Me but a message came God sent a message by my way and gave me instructions to make sure that I didn't end up under there that was going to be me and my family and she said I'm so thankful I hid those spies I'm so thankful that I listened to that message I'm so thankful I listened as brother Donny preached Time After Time I'm so thankful I took it and applied it Could Have Been Me what's hidden what's hidden in your heart tonight you know that she actually traded places with Aiken brother Joe Aiken was in the tribe of Judah and then we find that she marry salmon in the tribe of Judah and is listed in the Book of Matthew in the genealogy of Christ in the tribe of Judah because they both got the same message here he was a message believer with every opportunity he was the one that was supposed to be in that lineage forever he was the one that was supposed to take a rapture and here she walks past that pile of stones and now she steps into that lineage in Christ comes down through that lineage what's hidden will you bow your heads with me for just a minute what's hidden are the things that you've hidden in your life going to produce Jesus Christ is it going to produce a body change is it going to produce a Rapture for you and your family you got a choice right now what will I hide but maybe right now you need to answer what have I hidden what's there is it the message of the hour tucked down deep in your heart are you allowing it to change you are you allowing it to mold you or is there cursed treasure hidden there listen today more than ever I can Rejoice knowing that I have a loved one that stepped across having laid aside all the cursed Treasures of this Earth and because I know he did that I know I'm a seam again you can know that you know that you know I love moments like this it's a quiet moment it's just you and your thoughts search yourself allow him to search you right now don't leave a door shut don't hide this little thing and think it don't matter right now examine your life and I know this you know we're not here for some I'm not trying to work you up or scare you I'm trying to make sure that you know that the walls are about to fall they're already shaking they're already rumbling I tell you what right now I just want to give you the opportunity to lay down every cursed treasure you say brother Aaron there's things that's been pulling on my life look I'm not here to point out and say you ain't been living right and you sinner that ain't what this is about I already told you I'm looking at people I'm going in the Rapture with I'm proud to be associated with you but if there has been any cursed Treasure of this world hindrances trying to hold you back trying to keep you from being all that you can be and you want to make an announcement to the devil right now that he's not going to hold you and that he's not going to keep you here in a proclamation to the Lord that I'm going to sell out with all that I have I invite you I invite you to walk up to this altar and to lay it down and say Lord I just want to be completely sold out I want to leave everything that I have I want to make sure that as the walls begin falling as the walls come down all around me that there will be nothing found in my heart there will not be one thing that's going to keep me on that day from being in that rapture oh we thank you Lord Jesus young people what are we doing what's this about this is just making sure the cord's hanging out the window this is just making sure you're getting that on display it's just making sure Lord I'm just here to let you know whose side I'm on that I hear the message and I want to be more than just a hero but I want to act on it tonight I just want to act on it I want to make sure I just want to search and be honest that's all this is about search and be honest and in this moment right now as the Lord is dealing with hearts you focus on you where is your heart what is it that's hindering you it don't have to be some big sin I'm not here to try to bring that kind of some kind of thing over your life and say you know you're lost no no no just make sure it's clean just make sure it's cleaned out make sure there's nothing there because I look around and I see the walls are falling but we have a promise young people as you're here right now in this moment just begin to talk to him just begin to allow him to search you allow him to search your heart as as we begin to sing some songs just let him deal with you right now just begin to talk it over with him this is an opportunity in and of itself but there's there's an opportunity tomorrow and then there's service Sunday and then you're coming up Upon A Youth Camp there's a lot of opportunities coming you're coming up to a place in a life-changing opportunities laying right before you you're at the place where you're going to make that decision one way or the other how's it going to be what's it going to go am I going to be inside the house am I going to be inside the Ark of Safety or am I going to let some little stupid thing keep me out I promise you it's not worth it I promise you it's not worth it to be left behind for one thing for two things for three things for all the world has to offer it's not worth it but tonight within your heart as you're right there just sell out and say Lord I give it all to you give myself away I lay it right here at your altar there's so many of you here and I'd love to pray with each and every one of you but right now we're just going to pray over all of you as you're at this altar and you begin to just lay it down at the Lord's feet Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for these young people Lord we thank you that no matter what the enemy does and what hell brings upon this Earth there is a group of young people that are

your accusers so don't you keep bringing it up quit doing the devil's job for him quit digging up your pass and saying but I did this but I did this but I did this let me leave you with this tonight
