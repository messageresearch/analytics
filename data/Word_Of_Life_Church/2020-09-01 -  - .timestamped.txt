[25:58] heavenly father we so love you today
[26:03] we know this is one thing that separates
[26:07] your true word-born children
[26:10] from just people who go to church
[26:15] they are so tried and so tested
[26:20] they have to be to match you
[26:24] yet lord others should look at this one
[26:26] or that one say well this is a christian
[26:28] church and this is a christian
[26:30] and that's a christian and they never
[26:32] have anything
[26:33] to happen to them to me lord
[26:37] that would be one of the worst things
[26:40] anyone could ever say about our church
[26:44] that we're never tested we're never
[26:46] tried
[26:48] if our ministers here at the church are
[26:51] scar-free
[26:53] and we are never thrown into the angry
[26:56] flames
[26:57] and torrents of the winds and the waves
[27:00] i would not take that that's a
[27:02] compliment
[27:04] the lord jesus we know that your people
[27:07] are a tribe people for you are still
[27:11] proving your greatness as they go
[27:14] through trials
[27:16] and they know it's not themself they
[27:19] testify we could not stand this
[27:23] if it was not for the grace of god amen
[27:26] amen we count it's such an honor to be
[27:29] together again today lord
[27:32] our hearts have longed
[27:36] to be together thank you lord

[28:39] opportunities by which the grace of god
[28:41] can be able to manifest himself that's
[28:44] right and that's the way we look at it
[28:45] that's the way we
[28:47] we believe it we certainly appreciate
[28:49] you being here today
[28:50] trust the service will be a blessing one
[28:52] wednesday night such a wonderful
[28:54] service brother daryl just did an
[28:55] outstanding job so appreciated the word
[28:57] and the anointing
[28:59] excuse me appreciate the different ones
[29:02] that have come and made the stream
[29:03] unavailable
[29:04] and we wasn't able to assemble together
[29:06] we appreciate them for doing that
[29:08] and yes i am delaying
[29:11] um i'll wait for the butterflies to
[29:13] settle a little bit
[29:14] it's been three weeks since i preached
[29:16] 21 days today
[29:18] so i know i know you think you get
[29:21] nervous after all these years
[29:22] you need to get rid of me when i don't
[29:25] because if i ever get to a place that i
[29:27] think i don't need him
[29:28] it's time for you to get another
[29:29] preacher amen
[29:32] god bless you love you so much hebrews
[29:34] chapter 9
[29:35] verse 15.
[29:39] by taking the type of body that he took
[29:44] by going through what he went through
[29:48] it should have told us the rest of the
[29:51] journey would not be easy
[29:55] by suffering all that he suffered and
[29:58] being in the act of condescension
[30:02] through kenosis
[30:05] and then once he raised from the dead by
[30:08] taking that same body
[30:10] and glorifying that same body the
[30:12] picture should have been
[30:14] more clear but as we go along
[30:17] it does become more clear
[30:20] hebrews 9 15 and for this cause he is
[30:24] the mediator of
[30:26] the new testament that by means of death
[30:30] for the redemption of the transgressions
[30:33] that were under the first testament they
[30:37] which are called
[30:38] might receive the promise of eternal
[30:42] inheritance for where a testament is
[30:46] there must
[30:47] also a necessity be the death
[30:50] of the testator for a testament
[30:53] is a force after men of are dead
[30:57] otherwise it is of no strength at
[31:00] all while the testator
[31:03] liveth may the lord bless his word you
[31:05] may be seated
[31:17] it is our soul
[31:20] that has moved into the land
[31:23] of the abstract but our bodies
[31:29] still remain
[31:33] in a place of great humiliation
[31:37] as i stand before you today
[31:40] i stand in a state of humility
[31:44] humiliation i stand
[31:48] in a state that shows my full
[31:52] sonship has not been completely restored
[31:56] yet
[31:58] since the last time i preached to you
[31:59] i've lost about 15 pounds
[32:02] i'm weaker i have to kind of steady
[32:06] myself
[32:07] i'll have to pace myself this morning
[32:09] when i preach
[32:12] why because i'm still immortal
[32:17] no doubt in the last two weeks two
[32:19] months three months
[32:20] many of you have went through things
[32:23] that
[32:24] you never thought you'd ever face before
[32:26] as our as a church we have
[32:29] not just as our church only but churches
[32:32] around the world there's actually saints
[32:35] of god in the message that have been
[32:39] not allowed to go back to their country
[32:42] i know one particular brother that is in
[32:44] a certain part of africa he has been
[32:48] there
[32:48] in this part of africa now for about
[32:51] four months
[32:53] staying in a motel every night because
[32:57] his country shut down their borders that
[33:00] would not let even residents
[33:02] come back in friends of mine in south
[33:05] africa
[33:06] that are in other parts of the world
[33:09] unable to come back friends of mine from
[33:11] zimbabwe that are in south africa
[33:13] that have not been able to come back to
[33:15] their home
[33:16] separated from wives children family
[33:20] because of this so you see this is not
[33:22] something that's just
[33:23] happy valley alone but the entire world
[33:27] has been affected by this who would have
[33:29] ever thought
[33:31] that something as simple as
[33:34] a member of the cold
[33:37] family coveted 19 is a member
[33:41] of the cold family now he's a rougher
[33:44] member of course than the cold itself
[33:47] but he is still of that family who would
[33:49] have ever
[33:50] thought it would have been able to
[33:52] brought such spiritual
[33:54] paralysis as well as natural paralysis
[33:58] to the world and this is pre-tribulation
[34:02] this is not no friends you have not
[34:05] missed the rapture
[34:06] the rapture still hasn't taken place in
[34:08] case you're wondering
[34:10] but if this is pre-tribulation can you
[34:14] imagine what it's going to be
[34:15] when the tribulation breaks through
[34:18] whenever the bride is actually taken
[34:20] from the world
[34:21] you think it's bad now you know why it's
[34:24] not worse
[34:25] because we're still here but whenever
[34:28] the bride is taken
[34:29] it is going to be one awful place
[34:32] to be living but while we are yet
[34:36] here we know that god has given us
[34:39] a work to do and that work will be
[34:42] completed you believe that now brother
[34:45] daryl
[34:45] said it so beautifully that this has
[34:48] taken us by surprise and i think brother
[34:50] west went along that same line
[34:52] but the lord has not been surprised at
[34:55] all
[34:56] you know the year 2020 has been quite a
[34:58] year has it not
[35:00] here we are coming to the end of the of
[35:02] august and
[35:03] my the things that have already happened
[35:05] have just been unbelievable
[35:07] if 21 is going to be any worse i think
[35:10] i'll hold on to 20 and say no i don't
[35:12] want any more
[35:13] uh but the thing is we don't have a clue
[35:16] really how far that god will let it go
[35:19] but
[35:20] i i think i can probably speak for
[35:22] pretty much everybody
[35:24] that comes to our church that probably
[35:26] we've been praying more
[35:28] we've had more sincerity i know so
[35:31] because i've talked to different folks
[35:33] and
[35:34] you know this has done something for us
[35:36] that uh
[35:37] having a big crowd didn't do this has
[35:40] done something for us
[35:41] that having blessings of god didn't do
[35:45] he knows how to turn the pressure upon
[35:47] us don't it
[35:48] now i'm not saying that any of you were
[35:50] backslid i certainly was not backslid
[35:53] but there's something about trouble that
[35:56] finely
[35:56] tunes a child of god's walk
[36:00] let me read to you this morning and you
[36:02] could read with me as well
[36:03] and romans chapter 8 verse 22
[36:06] for we know that the whole creation
[36:10] grown us and travail us in pain
[36:13] together until now
[36:18] so if it was for man's sake
[36:22] that the earth fell we
[36:26] should not be surprised
[36:30] that the earth waits
[36:33] in great anticipation
[36:36] for the recovery of man's walk
[36:42] you can't hear it nor can i
[36:46] but the birds they not only praise
[36:51] but they cry the animals
[36:54] not only worship but they cry
[37:00] they agonize if you've
[37:03] ever heard the recorded sounds that nasa
[37:06] has made
[37:08] of the universe and the further
[37:12] they go out those sounds change
[37:17] no doubt they are worshiping god because
[37:19] the psalmist david said they were
[37:23] but part of what nasa has recorded
[37:28] has been the groans and the cries
[37:33] of the heavens oh they're still
[37:36] beautiful
[37:37] magnificent in their splendor and glory
[37:42] but whether or not you realize it the
[37:44] heavens
[37:46] are as an old man or an old woman
[37:51] the brilliance is not the same
[37:54] the light of the sun now is seven times
[37:58] weaker than it will be in the millennium
[38:03] the earth as i read this morning where
[38:06] the farmer's
[38:07] almanac is saying that we're in for
[38:09] quite a treat
[38:11] this winter time if we didn't need
[38:15] anything else
[38:18] and i couldn't keep from thinking you
[38:21] know the earth was not made
[38:24] to shiver i've stood in canada whenever
[38:27] it was
[38:28] -40 and they would pull the vehicle
[38:33] me preaching being sweating and hot they
[38:35] would pull the
[38:37] vehicle with three and three feet to the
[38:39] door
[38:40] so i could walk out of that blazing hot
[38:42] building
[38:43] into -40 temperatures
[38:47] and somehow the earth has adapted to it
[38:52] but it's not what she was made for
[38:56] she was not made for the coldest
[39:00] place on the planet to have ice
[39:03] fields that are 20 miles thick
[39:07] for the winds to blow 140
[39:10] miles an hour with temperatures minus
[39:14] 100.
[39:17] i know she wasn't made for that
[39:21] because they've dug down beneath her our
[39:24] ice fields
[39:26] and pulled out palm branches
[39:30] they pulled out animals was palm
[39:33] branches still
[39:34] in their digestive tract
[39:38] she was made in her beauty
[39:42] and her splendor
[39:45] and then i think the word that paul
[39:49] used for we know the whole
[39:52] creation grown us so he doesn't just
[39:55] limit it
[39:56] to humans but the whole
[40:00] creation grown us and the greek word
[40:02] there is
[40:04] groans together all is united
[40:09] in a condition of sorrow
[40:13] and it express or denotes mutual
[40:17] universal grief it is
[40:20] one wide loud
[40:24] lamentation of pain
[40:30] sorrow sickness
[40:33] and death
[40:37] and which a dying world unites
[40:41] in one thing deliverance
[40:48] notice he goes on to say i'm
[40:51] travailus and pain together
[40:54] until now and paul chose
[40:58] a term here that was used for childbirth
[41:03] and we know the prophet when he preached
[41:06] the birth pains message that he
[41:08] he went through the different stages of
[41:10] what the earth had went through
[41:13] world war one world war ii
[41:16] the korean conflict of course in vietnam
[41:19] after he was gone
[41:21] all the different stages of the world
[41:25] itself
[41:26] and the people of the earth and it
[41:29] denotes
[41:30] an extreme cry of the depths
[41:34] of sorrow and anguish
[41:38] and all creation feels it
[41:41] to be honest with you i'm glad i can't
[41:44] hear the trees
[41:45] moan i deal with enough humans
[41:50] and i hear them moan and cry
[41:53] i'm glad i can't hear the trees cry
[41:58] i'm glad i cannot hear the animals
[42:02] cry and amen i'm not sure i could take
[42:05] it
[42:07] i've seen enough die in my lifetime
[42:11] i've seen enough broken-hearted children
[42:15] because their mom or their daddy was
[42:17] taken
[42:18] broken-hearted parents when a child
[42:21] left the earth before its time as we
[42:24] would say
[42:26] and you look around and you see it and
[42:29] you hear it
[42:31] and i know for those of us who have
[42:33] received
[42:34] the first fruits or the down payment of
[42:36] the spirit
[42:38] we feel it to a degree
[42:41] that the unsaved cannot even comprehend
[42:46] oh how i love my dose of the holy ghost
[42:53] how i love my portion
[42:56] of the keeping spirit of god
[43:00] but it's because of it it's what makes
[43:04] me so sad
[43:07] if i was out there in the world today
[43:09] and you were
[43:12] and you were trying to recover from a
[43:13] hangover last night
[43:16] and you were trying to get all this
[43:19] stuff settled in your mind
[43:21] you know of trying to find peace
[43:25] actually they don't feel what i feel
[43:28] today
[43:30] they don't feel what every other child
[43:32] of god feels
[43:34] because their souls has never received
[43:37] the deposit
[43:39] of a better world and when they get down
[43:42] they take an
[43:44] upper when they get too high they take a
[43:46] downer
[43:48] when they can't sleep they gotta peel
[43:49] for that and when they
[43:51] can't do something else they got
[43:52] something they smoked for that
[43:55] but i don't do that when i get down
[44:00] i pray when i get weary
[44:05] i read my bible when i get overwhelmed
[44:10] i begin to meditate about the new earth
[44:14] and the world that is to come
[44:17] hallelujah i don't depend on
[44:20] substances from without my body
[44:24] which helped me to cope with life every
[44:27] day
[44:28] i do not depend on a beverage
[44:31] on a pill on a shot
[44:35] that will help me get through my
[44:37] difficult times
[44:39] i get through them by the deposit
[44:42] that i've received from that other world
[44:46] but with that deposit also comes
[44:49] the taste the taste
[44:56] it's as if though you are allowed by the
[44:59] grace of god
[45:00] to take what's in your very soul
[45:04] and taste of another world
[45:08] that is so free from trouble and
[45:11] heartache
[45:12] and sickness and anxiety
[45:16] and you taste it for a moment and you
[45:20] think oh what a place
[45:23] what a place to be
[45:26] and then it's as if though the taste
[45:29] is gone and you want to taste it again
[45:35] you want to experience
[45:38] it again because it makes you so hungry
[45:43] for more and more
[45:48] and then it leaves you
[45:52] and then you're faced with cold stark
[45:55] reality of a sick hurting
[45:59] dying world
[46:03] aren't you glad today our hope is not in
[46:06] this world
[46:10] dealing with a world of mystery
[46:15] and anxiety every age
[46:19] since the fall of man has experienced it
[46:22] and paul uses
[46:24] those two words that are all creation
[46:27] groaners and travailus
[46:28] and pained together until
[46:32] now till the time when the prophet here
[46:36] writes in this first gentile church age
[46:39] so it had been the characteristic
[46:41] of every age since the very fall
[46:45] notice in verse 23 and not only
[46:48] they but ourselves also
[46:52] which have the first fruits of the
[46:55] spirit you see friend this is what makes
[46:57] us
[46:57] grown to such a degree would not the
[47:01] majority
[47:02] of humanity want a better world
[47:06] even though we would so differ in every
[47:09] political
[47:10] field and with every politician no doubt
[47:14] we would have such a difference whether
[47:17] it be
[47:17] socialism whether it would be communism
[47:20] whether it be democracy democracy itself
[47:23] is a million miles from perfection we
[47:25] know that
[47:26] but i'm glad we live here but yet no
[47:30] matter what the politicians would
[47:32] promise
[47:33] look at the kingdoms that have lived on
[47:35] the world
[47:36] and on the surface of the earth i've
[47:38] been privileged to be able to travel
[47:41] into different parts of the world and i
[47:43] love
[47:44] archaeology i love stones and i love
[47:48] looking at things and our trip to israel
[47:50] and i took so many pictures of
[47:53] of archaeology archaeological pieces of
[47:56] things and
[47:57] and my mind is i'd stand there and look
[48:00] and think
[48:01] that that is 2 000 years old or that is
[48:04] 2500 years old and when we were there in
[48:08] some of the places that we were able to
[48:10] go to
[48:11] and them still digging in the city of
[48:13] david and many other places and while we
[48:16] were there
[48:17] they just found the capstone of a
[48:19] corinthian type
[48:21] column buried many many feet
[48:24] down in the dirt and they had just just
[48:27] found it
[48:27] the day before we got there it had been
[48:30] laying there
[48:31] for 2 000 buried beneath that what did
[48:35] it tell it told
[48:37] to me it told a story of an
[48:40] era of time and i looked at that and i
[48:44] was just
[48:44] mesmerized about it thinking of the
[48:48] people
[48:49] that made it and the ones who erected
[48:52] that
[48:52] and the people that walked by it for
[48:55] maybe
[48:56] hundreds of years and you you see
[48:59] of what the stories that this earth
[49:01] holds
[49:03] and yet where are those great people
[49:06] today
[49:07] the romans which conquered the world
[49:10] during the byzantine period during the
[49:14] periods of great history you think of
[49:18] montezuma you think of the
[49:21] all the different ones that have lived
[49:23] and what do we have
[49:24] left of their societies pyramids made of
[49:28] stone
[49:30] or a rock this and a rock that
[49:33] the babylonians which rule the world
[49:37] and where are they today they cease
[49:40] to exist the pharaohs which ruled
[49:44] egypt where are they today
[49:47] and think of it this earth has seen them
[49:50] come and go
[49:51] and there's a saul standing over
[49:54] jerusalem
[49:56] looking there from where the lord jesus
[49:59] would have looked down upon the valley
[50:02] and his words reverberated in my
[50:05] soul oh jerusalem
[50:08] jerusalem how oft i would have
[50:12] gathered you together 20
[50:15] centuries later and how many people have
[50:19] come and conquered and
[50:20] even at this very day excavating on the
[50:24] city of david and i saw this week
[50:28] a piece of a beam that they had just
[50:31] dug up four months ago that has been
[50:34] buried beneath
[50:36] the dirt there since the babylonians
[50:39] came
[50:40] and destroyed jerusalem 586
[50:45] bc and dilate that charred
[50:48] piece of a wooden beam
[50:52] oh my how many stories
[50:56] have been lived through this earth and
[50:58] where are all of those
[50:59] mortals at now where is
[51:03] king nebuchadnezzar where
[51:06] is darius the great
[51:10] where is cyrus
[51:13] where are they brother daryl where are
[51:16] they
[51:17] where are their great kingdoms
[51:20] laying in dust and let's go ahead and
[51:24] add ours
[51:25] before it comes to pass for it will come
[51:28] to pass
[51:29] that the last vision that the prophet
[51:31] saw
[51:32] this great kingdom of america
[51:36] one of the greatest nations on the earth
[51:38] right
[51:39] i'm glad to be an american it breaks my
[51:41] heart to see america go the way she's
[51:43] gone
[51:44] but it is her own choice and her own
[51:47] fault
[51:48] and it won't be too many risings and
[51:50] settings of the sun
[51:52] that she will lay a smoldering ashes
[51:56] because a prophet of god saw it in a
[51:58] vision
[52:00] but i'm so glad my hope is not just
[52:04] in america i'm so glad my hope today
[52:07] oh brother donnie if if if joe biden can
[52:10] be the president he'll turn it around
[52:12] and some of the rest you say
[52:14] oh no no no no what we need is trump
[52:16] again no
[52:17] we don't need neither one of them guys
[52:19] we need the lord jesus to come back
[52:22] either one of them is going to lead us
[52:23] into a mess
[52:25] that's exactly right oh but friends
[52:29] by tasting of such a deposit in my soul
[52:33] and when i come down from living walking
[52:36] dwelling
[52:37] in that heavenly realm
[52:42] and then i have to feast my eyes back
[52:45] upon this that's around us
[52:50] the reason i grown is i have experienced
[52:55] my foretaste
[52:59] do you understand when you receive the
[53:00] baptism of the holy ghost and it
[53:02] releases
[53:03] your soul from mortality
[53:08] that is your portion of eternal life
[53:12] forever those of you who have eternal
[53:16] life this morning
[53:18] you'll never get any more than what you
[53:20] have right now
[53:23] your baptism of the holy ghost
[53:27] is that deposit praise god
[53:31] but the foretaste of that glory that is
[53:35] to come
[53:37] you see it's a paradox because it
[53:40] reflects
[53:40] most positive and negative effects
[53:45] in the same creature by whom it strikes
[53:48] its value
[53:51] i'm glad i'm not called to be a prophet
[53:55] i'm glad i'm not called to walk where
[53:59] they walked
[54:00] oh we look at them and ended there may
[54:02] be a position that they had
[54:05] i cannot imagine being called into the
[54:07] third heavens one day
[54:10] and hearing and seeing things that it's
[54:12] not even lawful
[54:14] for you to repeat
[54:17] and then you have to leave that
[54:23] and come back down to this
[54:27] i cannot imagine sitting in the bed
[54:30] with your hands behind your head
[54:34] and you're the song beyond the curtain
[54:37] of time
[54:39] and a voice from another world says
[54:42] would you like to see it
[54:47] oh i believe it would help me
[54:51] so much and the next thing you know
[54:57] you're standing above your body while
[54:59] your body's laying in the bed
[55:01] and you actually look at yourself and
[55:03] you think
[55:04] i must have died with a heart attack
[55:09] you're 20 feet from your body
[55:13] and all of a sudden you hear voices
[55:18] could it be that close
[55:22] can it be that that dimension
[55:26] is 20 feet from where i am
[55:32] so
[55:36] no farther than that
[55:41] can i run to it can i leap from this
[55:45] world
[55:47] into that one no
[55:50] if i could but desire today
[55:53] i would disappear before you
[55:58] and i wouldn't be the only one some of
[56:00] you would be going with me
[56:03] i'm glad i don't have the ability to
[56:06] travel to such a place
[56:08] that will
[56:12] but you see i've
[56:15] been one of the privileged
[56:18] some of you here sitting here today
[56:20] under my voice the sound of my voice
[56:23] we've been some of the privileged
[56:28] to get a deposit from that world
[56:32] can you imagine as the prophet as he
[56:35] looks around and
[56:37] the bluegrass being quite tall and
[56:41] the breeze blowing across the bluegrass
[56:46] unlike as the reference that brother
[56:47] joel made earlier the way we refer to
[56:49] wind
[56:50] and much of wind is associated in our
[56:53] minds of storms and fear
[56:56] but you see the wind never hardly raises
[56:59] just above
[57:00] a gentle breeze in that land
[57:06] and it hits the top of the bluegrass as
[57:09] they take their fingers and they rake it
[57:12] through that
[57:14] beautiful beautiful grass
[57:19] and he sees a throng of millions of
[57:22] people
[57:25] they don't recognize nobody and they
[57:27] don't even know where he is
[57:31] and the voice says you've been gathered
[57:35] with your people now remember he had not
[57:39] been birthed
[57:40] into the theophany which is the word
[57:41] form body so he didn't know all things
[57:46] he's had a temporary translation
[57:49] hallelujah
[57:52] oh it must have been
[57:55] beyond sublime
[57:59] but can you imagine when you're told
[58:03] you must go back
[58:10] i'm so glad he was willing
[58:13] the seals hadn't been broken who is
[58:16] melchizedek and been preached
[58:18] lots of great sermons where was yet to
[58:21] be revealed
[58:23] but can you imagine the imprint that it
[58:26] left on the prophet's
[58:27] soul
[58:30] when he had to leave that world of
[58:34] immortality
[58:36] and he looked back on the bed and that
[58:40] was his body
[58:42] and he knew he was going back brother
[58:44] darrell
[58:46] because he saw himself moving
[58:50] do i have to go back
[58:56] i'm glad i'm not a prophet
[58:59] i'm glad
[59:02] i've not had experiences like that i
[59:04] don't think
[59:06] i could take it
[59:12] oh
[59:15] but my adoption which has brought me in
[59:19] the sequence
[59:20] of eternity has placed me on this
[59:25] on my cycle to when my mortality soon
[59:31] will end you see the christian
[59:36] is like the spies
[59:39] whose soul has won over into the land
[59:43] of gigantic grapes
[59:47] and eternal life and goodness
[59:50] and joy and happiness
[59:54] this is one reason i love church so much
[59:57] oh men carol listen to a tape at home
[59:59] whenever we weren't able to have service
[1:00:01] or stream one of the
[1:00:02] ministers that we have confidence in and
[1:00:04] we we did all that too
[1:00:07] and we would play several tapes during
[1:00:08] the day because it didn't feel like
[1:00:10] doing anything else you know so you just
[1:00:11] listened to tape several several hours
[1:00:14] i did several studies and i did one
[1:00:16] study of 2030 quotes so
[1:00:18] i've spent a little bit of time with the
[1:00:20] word but yeah there's
[1:00:22] nothing like us being together
[1:00:25] because now if i look at 2 000 quotes or
[1:00:28] a thousand or 500 or 1500 or whatever it
[1:00:30] is
[1:00:31] i'm still only sitting there
[1:00:32] fellowshipping with my little lick of
[1:00:34] fire
[1:00:35] but here we are this morning we're
[1:00:37] privileged for a whole lot more
[1:00:39] of those same licks of fire to come
[1:00:41] together
[1:00:42] this is why we cry this is why we feel
[1:00:45] such
[1:00:46] sadness in our hearts when we cannot
[1:00:48] come together because
[1:00:50] it's just a little bit more of heaven
[1:00:52] together
[1:00:53] when we come together oh thank god for
[1:00:55] the brothers and the sisters that was
[1:00:57] able to come
[1:00:58] and sing and play the music for us it
[1:01:00] was a little bit more of heaven
[1:01:02] but it's a little bit more even here he
[1:01:04] had today
[1:01:07] notice this the adoption which will be
[1:01:09] climaxed
[1:01:12] in our mortality will be when the lord
[1:01:16] jesus
[1:01:17] returns i love the way that paul looks
[1:01:20] at this
[1:01:21] it will be the complete recovery
[1:01:24] of the body from death
[1:01:28] and corruption
[1:01:31] every time we see god heal somebody
[1:01:35] it's another down payment of a body
[1:01:37] change
[1:01:40] you see we have been in this body all of
[1:01:43] our life and in one sense the word
[1:01:45] it's the only thing since consciousness
[1:01:47] that we really
[1:01:49] understand but it's still the one
[1:01:52] sign of imperfect sonship
[1:01:57] we all know reality well enough to know
[1:02:00] that
[1:02:01] if the lord tarries within a few years
[1:02:04] we won't be able to do what we can do
[1:02:06] now
[1:02:08] i'm 64 years old i'm older than brother
[1:02:10] branham was when he passed away
[1:02:13] if the lord tarries a few more years
[1:02:16] at best is all i have left
[1:02:21] to be able to preach a few more years
[1:02:24] these some of these deacon brothers will
[1:02:26] realize you know what i i can't serve
[1:02:29] the people
[1:02:30] with my age i can't do it i feel that i
[1:02:33] need to
[1:02:34] step down maybe brother jim within a few
[1:02:38] years of condiments hey brother dania
[1:02:41] i just feel like i can't do this anymore
[1:02:45] i don't want to hear that from you
[1:02:54] brother louie will eventually say you
[1:02:56] know what brother donai
[1:02:58] i'm so forgetful or not if the lord
[1:03:01] tarries it i can't hardly grasp it but
[1:03:04] hey we'll say brother donny i'm missing
[1:03:08] so many notes
[1:03:12] i can't hear anymore
[1:03:15] my leg's got arthritis in it i can't
[1:03:18] play the foot pedal
[1:03:20] i'm going to get somebody else
[1:03:24] to play the organ
[1:03:30] what this is the vicious
[1:03:35] cycle
[1:03:38] i hate it
[1:03:45] but we could be the generation
[1:03:48] that breaks that cycle
[1:03:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:01] notice says brother blame it says while
[1:04:03] we're groaning
[1:04:05] veils in this tabernacle
[1:04:10] of humiliation
[1:04:13] we have the earnest of our perfect
[1:04:16] complete redemption
[1:04:20] back like it was in the beginning
[1:04:25] when god created adam in the garden of
[1:04:28] eden
[1:04:29] we have a foretaste of glory divine
[1:04:34] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:38] the refreshment coming from the presence
[1:04:41] of god
[1:04:42] to water the church i love this quote
[1:04:45] to water the church to make it grow
[1:04:49] in grace don't you see why they need to
[1:04:51] come together
[1:04:52] it's a refreshing presence of god
[1:04:56] it waters us it gives us all my
[1:04:59] a fresh drink from the heavenly spring
[1:05:03] to make us grow
[1:05:11] and when we're sick
[1:05:16] we have redemption the blessing
[1:05:20] the attributes of the death
[1:05:23] of christ divine healing
[1:05:27] as a foresign to us that
[1:05:31] someday this mortal
[1:05:34] will take on immortality yes sir
[1:05:38] amen oh my marvelous
[1:05:43] i say double marvelous triple marvelous
[1:05:46] quadruple marvelous
[1:05:50] god if he would make a statement like
[1:05:53] that in 1951
[1:05:55] many of us are not even born how much
[1:05:58] more real
[1:06:00] what it is to be to our hearts today

[1:06:18] resurrection
[1:06:21] praise be to god hallelujah
[1:06:24] amen amen you believe in saints
[1:06:28] three weeks ago i think it was three
[1:06:30] weeks ago to this day brother daryl had
[1:06:32] been
[1:06:32] battling the fever with a cove had come
[1:06:35] and go and come and go and you remember
[1:06:37] that service
[1:06:38] that i called his name in prayer and we
[1:06:40] agreed together on the promise of god
[1:06:42] and asked that thing to leave him
[1:06:44] it left him that very day what was that
[1:06:48] that happened in brother daryl's
[1:06:49] home what was that that moved on him
[1:06:52] the lord jesus gave brother daryl a
[1:06:55] foretaste
[1:06:56] of the resurrection his wife so sick
[1:06:59] laying on the floor for over an hour he
[1:07:01] said couldn't even get up
[1:07:03] i called her name in prayer amen
[1:07:05] whenever i got home he texted me and
[1:07:07] said brother daryl brother donnie she's
[1:07:09] sitting up at the table
[1:07:10] eating some soup what was it god gave
[1:07:13] sister cheryl
[1:07:14] another taste of the resurrection
[1:07:17] hallelujah those that we have prayed for
[1:07:20] for whatever more than it is and we have
[1:07:23] seen
[1:07:24] our lord come on the scene what was it
[1:07:27] it was our foretaste of the resurrection
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:38] well let's face facts
[1:07:42] this body is an embarrassment to me this
[1:07:46] morning
[1:07:50] i feel ashamed brother darrell i feel
[1:07:53] the anointing on me
[1:07:55] the wisdom of god anointing my mind i
[1:07:58] don't have to explain it to you
[1:08:01] but i'm limited by my strength
[1:08:08] this body humiliates me
[1:08:13] it embarrasses me this morning
[1:08:18] because i can't give my all
[1:08:22] i'm held back because
[1:08:26] of a lack of strength
[1:08:31] and there's one thing that i did get as
[1:08:33] i've got older when i didn't have when i
[1:08:34] was younger
[1:08:35] a little bit more wisdom
[1:08:39] so it helps
[1:08:46] i think of this little old frail
[1:08:48] tabernacle of our humiliation
[1:08:51] what is it just a few vitamins
[1:08:55] and calories throw
[1:08:58] together just a little place
[1:09:02] for the soul to anchor it
[1:09:05] that's all but one of these glorious
[1:09:08] days
[1:09:09] it'll be changed again he says someday
[1:09:13] we're going out
[1:09:15] of this tent this dwelling place
[1:09:19] the tabernacle of our humiliation
[1:09:23] and we're going to be changed step over
[1:09:27] on another land
[1:09:30] where it's purity and when our feet
[1:09:34] listen to this friends when our feet
[1:09:38] first touches that blessed land
[1:09:43] when the old ship of zion blows
[1:09:46] for landing and we rush out
[1:09:51] it's going to be all over there
[1:09:57] isn't that wonderful but isn't that
[1:10:00] tormenting
[1:10:02] it's wonderful to think about how much
[1:10:05] longer will it be
[1:10:07] a month two years 10 20.
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:13] but don't you see why you feel the way
[1:10:15] you do
[1:10:16] your deposit your foretaste
[1:10:19] reminds you it's there
[1:10:23] it's there thank god i'm so glad i can
[1:10:28] say today
[1:10:29] it's not only there but it is here
[1:10:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:38] sickness and cripples and affliction and
[1:10:41] everything will be gone
[1:10:42] old age death sorrow
[1:10:46] and all these natural things that was
[1:10:48] caused by the curse
[1:10:50] will be gone forevermore
[1:10:55] all this revelation chapter five if you
[1:10:57] haven't listened to it in a while it's
[1:10:58] wonderful it parallels the breach and he
[1:11:00] preaches a few years after it but he
[1:11:02] says
[1:11:03] all creation is groaning said paul
[1:11:06] everything is groaning look at the trees
[1:11:10] how they struggle look at the flowers
[1:11:14] how they struggle for life
[1:11:17] just for the frost
[1:11:20] to tear them down
[1:11:24] we can see it already the leaves that
[1:11:27] are starting to turn
[1:11:29] some of them have just fell on the
[1:11:30] ground have they not now tell me that
[1:11:32] makes you happy right
[1:11:34] it makes you feel so happy whenever you
[1:11:37] look up
[1:11:37] really but wait a minute fall's coming
[1:11:42] the most beautiful colors that the
[1:11:44] leaves will ever
[1:11:46] show oh but it's not that that troubles
[1:11:50] you is it
[1:11:52] it's the nearly six months that we will
[1:11:55] look at those trees
[1:11:58] and their bark in the dismal gray
[1:12:02] and we can't wait for the first buds of
[1:12:06] spring
[1:12:08] can somebody please tell me where summer
[1:12:10] went
[1:12:13] i wish i could grab ahold of covet and
[1:12:15] smack his jaws from one side to the
[1:12:17] other
[1:12:19] kovad stole our spring it stole our late
[1:12:22] spring
[1:12:23] it stole our early summer it stole our
[1:12:25] mid-summer
[1:12:27] and here we are before you know it we're
[1:12:28] gonna be right in the middle of fall
[1:12:30] where is that coveted anyway oh man i'll
[1:12:33] tell you there's one person i wish had
[1:12:36] coveted he's the only one that can't get
[1:12:38] it and that's the devil
[1:12:40] what in the world happened to our summer
[1:12:42] what happened to our spring
[1:12:44] what happened to our plans what happened
[1:12:47] to our meetings
[1:12:50] i just got a text yesterday you got it
[1:12:52] brother tim
[1:12:53] they've decided not to have their
[1:12:54] meetings brother ron didn't have his
[1:12:57] brother joe green first time in
[1:12:58] 40-something years
[1:13:00] he said god oh what's
[1:13:04] happened what's happened everything
[1:13:07] has been turned upside down what is it
[1:13:10] friend believe it or not
[1:13:12] what we have experienced and are
[1:13:14] experiencing
[1:13:15] is another burst pain
[1:13:19] the church has gone through things that
[1:13:22] we never
[1:13:22] thought oh my we never thought we
[1:13:26] couldn't have church
[1:13:26] because of a virus
[1:13:30] a virus
[1:13:35] oh my look at the flowers how they
[1:13:39] struggle for life
[1:13:41] i passed i don't know how many coming to
[1:13:43] church this morning
[1:13:45] i saw black-eyed susans i saw
[1:13:48] daisies chrysanthemums
[1:13:52] i saw so many beautiful pinks and
[1:13:55] yellows and i thought it won't be no
[1:13:59] time
[1:14:01] their beauty will be all spent and gone
[1:14:05] and they'll be
[1:14:08] shivering in the cold and for some of
[1:14:12] them
[1:14:13] the first frost in late october
[1:14:18] will bring on their tabernacle
[1:14:21] of humiliation
[1:14:27] look at the trees uh they struggle to
[1:14:30] hold their branches
[1:14:31] out to sing glories
[1:14:35] unto god do you hear that
[1:14:38] i don't hear it either but that's what
[1:14:40] they're doing
[1:14:43] isn't it amazing that they put their
[1:14:45] branches out like this
[1:14:47] and they're praising god you imagine
[1:14:50] when the gentle breeze comes through by
[1:14:52] the dao
[1:14:53] and them leaves and then when no leaves
[1:14:55] are a sign of fellowship
[1:14:56] and the spirit of god of unity comes
[1:14:58] through them leaves
[1:15:00] and them leaves begin to blow all my
[1:15:03] in the spring states in the summer stage
[1:15:05] and the late summer
[1:15:06] and then the fall and then those who are
[1:15:09] deciduous which
[1:15:10] means they they shed their leaves and
[1:15:11] they stand there the whole time through
[1:15:14] winter
[1:15:15] but i'm so glad they don't fold their
[1:15:18] branches down by their side
[1:15:21] and somebody's
[1:15:25] zip them up but they stand there bear
[1:15:30] worshipping god right in the middle of
[1:15:33] wintertime
[1:15:35] oh they don't take much of a child of
[1:15:37] god to worship him in
[1:15:39] summer when your tree is full of
[1:15:41] branches
[1:15:42] and the gentle breeze come but oh
[1:15:44] brother sister
[1:15:45] to be able to stand there with no leaves
[1:15:48] we know what it's been like in
[1:15:50] quarantine
[1:15:52] do we not we know what it's been like to
[1:15:54] be quarantined
[1:15:55] hey i love my wife ain't nobody in this
[1:15:58] world i love know better but i
[1:16:00] i longed to see somebody else
[1:16:03] and she felt the same way about me go
[1:16:05] ahead you can say it about your little
[1:16:07] darling too
[1:16:08] because we were made to be together

[1:16:41] and see the resurrected dead
[1:16:45] and be with him forever listen to this
[1:16:48] brother brad said every sing all nature
[1:16:51] all animals
[1:16:54] all birds how he flies from the enemy
[1:16:58] quickly and gets away
[1:17:00] everything groaning and we ourselves
[1:17:01] have paul we've grown too
[1:17:03] with them you don't hear it all cattle
[1:17:08] all chickens all birds
[1:17:11] in their own time i don't know when they
[1:17:13] do it dude in the evening i don't know
[1:17:15] when they'd do it
[1:17:17] but they groaned
[1:17:21] we're waiting for the fullness of
[1:17:23] adoption and this will take place
[1:17:25] when at the first resurrection that's
[1:17:30] when our bodies
[1:17:31] will be changed from these vile
[1:17:34] creatures that we are and will have a
[1:17:38] body like his own glorious body
[1:17:40] or we shall see him as he is and we like
[1:17:43] him when he appears
[1:17:44] we appear in his likeness and we shall
[1:17:46] have a body like his
[1:17:49] a glorious glorified body
[1:17:52] and all the trials and the struggles of
[1:17:56] life
[1:17:57] will this this is what'll happen to him
[1:17:59] now
[1:18:00] we'll fade off into a little mist
[1:18:06] and blow away praise god
[1:18:12] to never be no more
[1:18:18] so the things that we look at now and
[1:18:20] think it's so hard it's so difficult
[1:18:24] but all of our life's trials and tests
[1:18:26] will
[1:18:27] just be come together like a mist of
[1:18:29] vapor and the wind will get it
[1:18:35] and it'll blow away
[1:18:40] let me read this from the breach and
[1:18:41] we'll close
[1:18:43] something's lost
[1:18:46] it's groaning it's trying to get back
[1:18:51] to be back to its original condition
[1:18:53] would you imagine someone
[1:18:55] falling from the earth down into a deep
[1:18:58] pit
[1:19:00] somewhere and was struggling climbing
[1:19:03] pulling they must by some means
[1:19:08] get out of the spit and they're not in
[1:19:11] their original state
[1:19:12] and frantically they're screaming
[1:19:16] they're clawing the walls
[1:19:19] making a noise and doing some way and
[1:19:22] they're groaning because they want to
[1:19:24] get back to their
[1:19:25] original state that's when a person is
[1:19:29] struck with the disease
[1:19:31] aches and pain one time they wasn't that
[1:19:35] way
[1:19:37] but they're groaning why they're not
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:41] there's something wrong and they're
[1:19:42] groaning and they're trying to get back
[1:19:44] to where they was
[1:19:45] when they had health
[1:19:50] my brother gene lehman laying this
[1:19:52] morning
[1:19:54] on a ventilator
[1:19:57] i've been in the hospital for i don't
[1:19:59] even know how many days now
[1:20:03] he's not right he wasn't made to breathe
[1:20:06] by that
[1:20:08] when i called him the other day face
[1:20:10] time and offered prayer for him
[1:20:12] so weak he could hardly talk i looked in
[1:20:15] his face
[1:20:16] and i waved at him and he waved back at
[1:20:19] me
[1:20:21] it wasn't right those of you that are
[1:20:24] sick and suffering today
[1:20:26] it isn't right but if god can anoint our
[1:20:30] faith
[1:20:32] hallelujah if god can anoint our face
[1:20:36] we can look at covet we can look at
[1:20:38] cancer we can look at a tumor or
[1:20:40] whatever more
[1:20:42] and say i want my state back
[1:20:45] i want my health back so i can serve god
[1:20:49] with all of my soul
[1:20:54] let's stand together while we finish
[1:20:56] this quote
[1:21:01] trying to get back to where they was
[1:21:04] when they had health when nature and
[1:21:06] people as the bible said are groaning
[1:21:08] it shows there's something they're not
[1:21:12] and there ought to be condition
[1:21:16] they've fallen from somewhere we don't
[1:21:19] need anybody to interpret that for us
[1:21:22] but of course we know it was eternal
[1:21:26] life
[1:21:28] they had fallen from and they lost their
[1:21:30] claims
[1:21:31] on eternal life by the fall of adam and
[1:21:33] eve
[1:21:34] who fell from eternal life to death
[1:21:38] in the garden of eden and brought all
[1:21:41] nature
[1:21:42] under them to death
[1:21:45] let me close it's hard for our minds to
[1:21:48] imagine this
[1:21:50] but he said a tree never died
[1:21:55] before adam
[1:21:59] i wonder how many thousands or maybe
[1:22:02] even millions of years
[1:22:05] the earth existed
[1:22:08] in the preadomite condition
[1:22:11] not one tree struggled for life
[1:22:17] not one plant not one flower
[1:22:20] death was non-existent
[1:22:36] non-existent
[1:22:43] okay devil suit yourself
[1:22:48] a tree never died before adam
[1:22:52] an animal wouldn't die before
[1:22:55] adam there's only one thing that cannot
[1:22:59] die
[1:23:00] and that's god because he's eternal
[1:23:06] so there's only one way to get us back
[1:23:09] to that spot
[1:23:12] god had to become
[1:23:15] time
[1:23:19] god had to become
[1:23:22] a mortal and empty himself out
[1:23:27] in order to come and take us home
[1:23:31] don't you love him today
[1:23:35] can we just bow our heads together
[1:23:46] hallelujah
[1:23:48] we'd just like to be remembered today
[1:23:50] maybe you're not sick
[1:23:52] i trust and pray that those of you have
[1:23:54] been spared the covetous
[1:23:56] trust god will keep you from it
[1:24:00] those of you that are still dealing with
[1:24:01] symptoms may god give you a temporary
[1:24:04] resurrection
[1:24:06] remove that mucus out of your body
[1:24:09] may god remove that lingering cough
[1:24:12] those of you that still can't taste
[1:24:14] smell whatever more
[1:24:16] in the name of jesus may you be fully
[1:24:19] restored
[1:24:21] to your pre-covet condition
[1:24:26] glory to god those of you with cancer in
[1:24:30] your bodies those of you
[1:24:33] with the diagnosis that the doctor gave
[1:24:35] you that was not good
[1:24:37] in the name of jesus may you be restored
[1:24:42] hallelujah to that pre-diagnosis
[1:24:45] condition

[1:25:11] boy's lunch today

[1:25:16] basket that he packed it in but i pray
