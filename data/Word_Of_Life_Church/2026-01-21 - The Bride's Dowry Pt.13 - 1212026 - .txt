I love this song, but while I was singing, I got so burdened for someone I love very dearly. So um I hope it's a blessing to you, but I'll be honest, I'm not sure I'm going to even be able to sing it tonight. So, [music] I just ask for your patience and uh I just trust that it's a blessing.

[music] [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I've had many tears of sorrows. [singing] I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times I didn't know right [singing] from wrong. [music] But in [singing] every situation, God gave blessed [singing] constellation. Let my trials come [music] to only [singing] make me strong. [music] Through it [singing] all, [music] through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've [singing] learned to trust in God. [music] Through it all, [singing] through it all, [singing] I've learned to [music] depend upon his word. [singing] I've been to a lot of places and [music and singing] I've seen so many faces. There have been times [singing] [music] I felt so all alone. But in those lonely hours, yes, those precious [singing] lonely hours, [music] Jesus lets me know that [singing] I am his own. [music] Oh, through it all. Through [music] it all, I've learned to trust in [singing and music] Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. [music] Through it all, [singing] oh through it all, I learn to [music and singing] depend upon his word. [music] And I thank God [singing] for the mountains. And I [music] thank him for the valleys. And I thank him for the storms [singing] he's brought me through. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, for if I ever had a problem, I wouldn't [singing] know that my God can solve it. I never [music] know what faith of God can do. [music] Oh, [singing] through it all. Oh, [music] through it all. [singing] I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in [singing] God. Through [music] it all, oh [singing] through it all, [music] I've learned to depend [singing] upon his word. [music] I've learned to depend [music and singing] upon his word. Through [music] [applause] it all, &gt;&gt; I've learned to trust in Jesus. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in the house of God tonight? &gt;&gt; What a great privilege for us. We um are certainly under anticipation for the service tonight. &gt;&gt; Believing the Lord's going to come and speak to us by his word. And before we do, we I certainly want to say I appreciate all of you praying for me. While I was sick, I'm doing a lot better. Still ain't got my strength back 100%, but um I'm doing really good. Um Carol got sick yesterday. Um so we certainly desire if you'd pray for her and remember her. Looks like apparently the same thing. as any good wife does take care of her sick husband, she winds up getting sick herself. So, so just certainly appreciate you remembering her. I'm sure that most of you have heard about this storm they're saying is coming our way, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll be the first to admit I don't understand all about the way God and storms and the devil and storms work. Okay, I do know the devil can get in storms and the devil can get in wind. And I know that was not the Lord that caused the storms and the wind out on the ship and then Jesus turned and rebuked what he started or what he caused. So I do know that there's been different occasions of course in the scripture and the prophet's life and then u of other people I know as well where the saints of God have prayed and God has turned storms stopped storms made them lighter than what they said it was going to be. And um I just believe prayer works. &gt;&gt; Now God's not our mascot. He's not the type of, you know, we we want him to do this and we tell him to do that. So myself when I approach him on anything that I'm uncertain about, I just always, Lord, unless you have a reason or you have a cause. U but for those of you that have heard about it, it certainly sounds like it could be a pretty rough thing. How many believes that we can pray and ask God to move on our behalf &gt;&gt; and be mindful of us during this time? All right, let's just uh let's just pray together. How many has a need in your heart personally, your life, for your family? God bless you. Let's hold these needs here before the Lord and we'll we'll pray together. [cough] [clears throat] Lord Jesus, how grateful we are that we can bow our heads and call upon your wonderful name. What a privilege it is for us as Gentiles, especially that were without the Commonwealth of Israel, dogs, outcast, and yet today the bride of Christ. We thank you for what you've done for us. We're grateful. May it never become common us just get used to it that we can pray. It's still a privilege to me to pray. It's an honor to be allowed to come into your presence. So, Father, we're asking tonight that you would help us. You saw all the hands that were uplifted, dear Jesus. You see this prayer cross that I have in my hand tonight, dear God, for our precious sister here, Lord, that's facing some things and test and so on. And you know all about that, Lord Jesus. And we're praying that you'll be with her. There'll be no evil that'll come of this. Father, we also ask you that you'd move for Carol, Lord, just brokenhearted that she couldn't come to church tonight. May the spirit of God, I pray, just move for and touch her, Lord. May this thing pass from her body. I know Lord that there's many different viruses, bugs, this that and the other that's going on and so many folks that are sick. But we believe that you're a healer of all these. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we want to mention to you about this storm situation. You know, heavenly father that the prince of the power of the air. He's the one that likes to break into things and speed up winds that are made normal and natural and nominal and turn them into a hurricane and tornadoes. And he loves to get in the wind and to be able to destroy people. And he's not just wanting to destroy your children. He wants to destroy his own because it's not just message people who get hit in hurricanes and tornadoes. It's any people and he expresses his being that he hates humanity. That's just who he is. He cannot love. But we're calling upon the God of love because we have experienced the love of God. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. So, we're asking you tonight, Father, for your mercy. I'll just be honest before you and these people. I I don't understand how all these things work, Lord. And if we would be asking anything that would be out of what you want it to be, then we just say, "Forget all that." But as far as we know, just the best that we're looking at. You see, Father, the things that they're saying and forecasting and ice and this and that and the other. And father, we're just praying that you would watch over your children. I have heard testimonies from South Carolina, from the Philippines, from different parts of the world, of India, of Madagascar, of different places where the children of God was in the line for terrible, terrible storms and something happened and turned and we believe that's our God. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, Father, we're praying for this. We'll we'll pray it in this way and we'll know we're never out of your will when we do. We're praying for your mercy, Father, to us. Be mindful of us, Lord Jesus. We thank you. Of course, we have people's well-being in mind and we have all these things. But Lord, you know, my main reason I don't want to miss church on Sunday. I just love going to church. I love being where you are and being where your children are. Would you just be mindful of us, Father? In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen. God bless you, saints. Aren't you glad we have a heavenly father that loves us so much &gt;&gt; and is so concerned about the things that we are concerned about? Let's read if you would tonight [clears throat] in the the book of Jude again only one chapter of course and we'll begin reading ver in verse 4. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; We've been speaking about the bride's dowy and what her father has given to her. And the dowy of course are multiple gifts given by the love and the character of the father and that he would give it to her to equip her for her new life. but also as it was in the case of of Rebecca that it would have been for her journey cuz she has a several month journey from where she's going to be able to meet her bridegroom. So for us, for many of us, it's been decades of our life that we've been in this journey to meet our bridegroom. And truly, we need gifts from our father as well in our diary. It will contain so many things. Many of them will be supernatural. Many of them will be natural. It'll be things like healing. It'll be things like place for you to live, a place for you to work, all kinds of natural things. But then first and foremost is the things that are supernatural. So it may be a little bit of a contrast to what I'm going to read tonight, but you'll see where I'm going to go once we do. In verse four in the book of Jude, for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lascifiousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this. Now watch he carries a thought from verse 4 to verse 5 on to verse 6 and then we read it in Peter also that Peter picks up the same thing and talks of the same thought. So it's of beings and people that were in a certain state or a state in a certain position and then something happened to them and they walked away from that state and then these writers point for us to look at them currently where they are and see what happened to them when they turned away. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, excuse me, afterward destroyed them that believe not. And the angels, now he jumps from human beings, he jumps to the angels. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, their own habitation, hath he reserved an everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. Now, you may wonder, what would a dowy have to do with talking about fallen angels and people that have once walked in the light of God and then turned away from that light of God? What what would we need something to equip us? I'll tell you why. So, we don't become one of those people. &gt;&gt; Now, it's a great thing when people come to light. It's a great thing when people come to the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, but it's just not great enough. It's wonderful when people can come to light and be illuminated, and the spirit of God can help them and set them free from lots and lots of things. But knowledge of our Lord Jesus will not keep you from the power of darkness. Knowledge of the mysteries of God are also, but knowledge of the mysteries will not keep you either. Now, for us to try to think of what it must have been like for angels which had never cursed, never lied, never stole, never done anything wrong. All they knew was hallelujah, praise the Lord. And they were given this awesome position in the presence of God. And they worshiped him. No doubt they had a love for him and they had an adoration which was pure and true and genuine initially and now remember they were created on a basis and put in a very similar position as Adam was in the garden of Eden. So it was a position that was given directly to them, but they could fall from it and they were not sealed to that position for eternity. Neither was Adam. But yet they were on probation. So these angels in this probationary period begin to hear another message from another great being. And this great being was God's right-hand man to fellowship. Question answers 1959. God's right-hand man to fellowship. Now his name was Lucifer in the beginning or day star or lightbringer, son of the morning. And he was one of great ability and power. Isaiah 14 declares him. Also, Ezekiel 28 declares him and tells us that he was a mighty one. He was in charge of the music department in heaven. Thou was created perfect in the day that thou was created. Thy harps and thy pipes and thy tabs. And in him was every precious stone, the sardis, the topaz, the carbuncle, all these beautiful things which are actually the foundation stones of the city you and I are striving to go to. And he was given a great preeminence among the angels of God. And sin began [cough and clears throat] not on the earth but actually in heaven. And Isaiah 14 catches it when he said, "I will." There it began. So he wanted to be like God, but he had nothing or no one to work through. So he is not omnipotent, omnisient, omnipresent. &gt;&gt; [cough] &gt;&gt; So he has to have beings by which he can reflect everything that he wants to be. But he can't make any. He's everything God was [cough] except a creator. So he can't create beings to worship him. He cannot create beings to help him carry it out. So where's he going to get them? He's going to get them from God. &gt;&gt; But there's a class of angels that he cannot get, which are elect. &gt;&gt; But it just so happened God made some in a similar category as Lucifer himself. They too were put on probation. So he exalts himself over in the north side of heaven and he begins to have some meetings, we'll call them. Now the original church was God's church. God was the pastor, the overseer, all of that. [cough] Excuse me. But Satan decided that this is a great idea. I also would like I want to be a pastor. I I I wanna I want to have beings that will fall down before me and adore me and worship me and love me. Where am I going to get them? SO HE LOOKS ALL through the myriads of angels and he noticed by creation that there was difference in degrees certain ones above others. So there was cherubams, saraphims, zooms, angels and different categories and he watched as God had put him in this position to stop. So he was the angel which stopped the approach. So any other angels that came before the throne of God, they must come through the door or the way Lucifer. So if they come up, Lucifer stopped the approach. Now this is part of his name in Ezekiel 28. Thou art the anointed cherub and I have set thee so. Oh my. But Lucifer like a lot of people forget who made him what he was. And he because of his beauty, his beauty excelled above the others. And he must have had a preeminence in nature, a preeminence in gifts. and he began to notice himself and he looked at himself, maybe drug out his Droid and his iPhone and everything he had, snapping selfies and this selfie and smiling and you know all kinds of things and oh, he just got stuck on himself. &gt;&gt; Sounds like our modern day people, don't it? And he went over into the north and began to preach rebellion. &gt;&gt; Rebellion against who? Well, there's only one leader there. God. So these angels moved under this influence. Now they lost according to what Jude said their habitation. But he never says they lost their anointing &gt;&gt; or their gifts &gt;&gt; or their ability to appear and disappear. &gt;&gt; They didn't even lose their ability to transform themselves as angels of God. So they can talk like angels of God. They can look like angels of God. They go to church. They talk about God. They can be so religious. I see why I needed things like this in my diary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Our battle is not a flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; I need angels to help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody else in here with me? &gt;&gt; Now these angels once they change sides, a war started in heaven. honestly don't know how angels fight. I don't know what they fight with, but I just know that they fought. And the devil took by his tail. Now, not t a i l, but the prophet said t a l e, his lies, his story. So by his tail, he took that and started sweeping among these angelic beings which were on probation. I don't mind telling you tonight, friends, I'm glad I'm not on probation. &gt;&gt; If you're elect bride tonight, you ain't on probation to see what you're going to do. Papa already knows what you're going to do. Cuz if I was, I'd probably like a lot of others beings. You better be glad you ain't, too. Oh, glory to God. Brother Donnie, I love my free moral agency say, "Well, I've gotten one, but mine's what's got me in so much trouble most of my life. My ignoramus decisions and stuff that I've chose." I'll say amen for you, too, cuz all y'all guilty just like I am. Now, think these angels unlike us, they wasn't born in sin. So it wasn't like one day, you know, that they got caught in sin and you know that they born that way and they just something. No, they just right there clearly thinking about it in their minds not knowing exactly what what the judgment would be thereafter. But right there they made their mind up. I today am leaving God. I will never again call on his name. I make up my mind. I am going to start a being which had a beginning like I did. I'm not sure where he will take me. I'm not sure what I will become. But I am sick of God. ALL I'VE DONE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS is worshiped him and praised him and blessed his name. I want to live a little. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WOULD BE like to be under the control, the tutorship of another being. And I'd sure like to ask them now. &gt;&gt; And how is that going for you? Now remember, there is no redemption for angels. &gt;&gt; Once angels ever make this move, they can never get back. &gt;&gt; There's no blood, there's no mercy seat, there's no mercy from the heart of God to redeem angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see when humans are touched by the power of God and father does something for them and illuminates them. And we know illumination comes in stages but illuminates them enough to know that they're lost and that there's a way out and they get saved and then they start turning loose things and letting go things. And as we looked at it last Wednesday night that for some of them the demons who inhabit their bodies actually by their own choice will leave on their own. And then if that person is under conviction and they can them demons can sense it. will leave on their own before they come to the altar, before they go to seeking prayer and seeking God. And then that gives that devil a right to go back. But if he is cast out, &gt;&gt; he has no authority to come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless the person falls away, willfully by their choice and then they invite that devil back in by invitation. Now Jude wrote about such people and Peter does too in second Peter chapter 2 verse 20. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world. Now look at this word pollutions. What it means the that which defiles defilement vices the foulness of which contaminates one in his dealings with the ungodly mass of mankind. So, it's totally possible then that a person could be delivered from such vile pollutions. They're actually set free. They're delivered from them. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, now notice how they get this deliverance. Through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. You notice Peter didn't say they were born again. Peter doesn't say they got sealed. He doesn't say they got the Holy Ghost. But they were delivered from pollutions through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Now remember, a person can be delivered of great things, &gt;&gt; but knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will not keep your soul. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to be sealed, saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are entangled again. So they get delivered from these pollutions and then something happens to them along their journey. could be a week, could be six months, could be 50 years, but something happens to begin to entangle them. So, it might be a vice, it might be a sin, it might be a weakness that they, you know, lean toward a certain inclination, a certain thing that that they had in their first life and it's always kind of bothered them and they've never really got totally delivered from it. And then Satan watches ad and watches at and he will set up an entanglement. Now notice the word that he uses. So it's not like that they were really walking right into it, but it was more of a trap, more of something that was there as a snare to try to entangle. And he says if they are entangled again and overcome two stages. So, a person can become entangled with something that bothered them before or something new and it doesn't mean that it will actually capture them. You and I both have seen people that they recognize something was going on, an entanglement in their life, and the spirit of God spoke to them through the word, through a ministry. Might have been a dream, might have been a tape. God has many ways to do that. And they recognize what was going on and they were able to see almost sort of like an octopus and it's, you know, its tentacles were wrapped around this arm and this leg and this arm and all of a sudden they become enlightened. Oh no. Oh no. And and instead of yielding to that, they fight with everything that's in them and they are able to pull out. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT PETER GOES ON TO SAY that if they are entangled again therein and overcome, overcome. The word overcome is to be inferior, to make less, worsted, to be conquered by one, forced to yield to one, set below. Now you see where an overcomer is just by the reverse of using this definition. An overcomer is one that is above sin, above entanglement, above this, above that. What's the entanglement for? To bring you down to its level of sin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now notice and Peter says they are entangled again and overcome. The latter end is worse with them than the beginning. How in the world can we wind up being worse than we were when we were born lost? &gt;&gt; How much more worse can you get than that? &gt;&gt; Oh, but you can't. You see, being born lost is a terrible thing. All of us were born that way. But yet, there's actually a worse end than there would be a beginning of just being a lost mortal in this life. And what is it that would bring a person to this? is because they hear truths and truths, more truths, more truths, accumulative truths in their life and then all OF A SUDDEN THEY START changing and going another way and Satan will lay an entanglement for them and a tentacle will wrap around their hearing or it will wrap around their sanctification. It will wrap around their prayer life. it will wrap around this and that and the other and it's pulling on them. There's still mercy and there's still help. Just because you're entangled tonight does not mean you're overcome. &gt;&gt; But if you allow those entanglements to keep getting the best of you, remember what it's for. It's there to pull you down on their level. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "And then whenever it overcomes them and pulls them into this state where they cannot return." Now, can some people return from being in a terrible state? Of course they can. But there are some that when they go for their last time, there will never be a way back. And then they actually enter into this part of the prophecy which is a very sad one really. Uh that the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. Notice in verse 21, for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. &gt;&gt; Now, maybe I'm strange. Maybe I'm weird. I don't go around everybody that I meet. I don't carry brother Ram's tapes in my pockets and books in the trunk of my car and every mortal that I meet I hand out one. I pray about who I want to witness to &gt;&gt; because I'm convinced many of us have witnessed to people and we'd been better off to left them alone. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT REALLY IN THEM, we're not careful, we're giving them one book after another, one tape after another for them to use as blasphemy against their own souls. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if I sat by people on a plane and they're sitting there, I've got my computer in my lap and they're sitting there looking at it, you know? I mean, they can read. It's a Bible program. They can read a scripture. They don't know what the message is, of course, and they're sitting there reading and they're curious. What do you do? You a businessman? No, I'm a preacher. You You can imagine the looks you get in this day and age. But depending on if they are a Christian or not a Christian and then you know I just drag out my fishing line and go to baiten it up a little bit and kind of and then what what church do you you pastor? You evangelist what you know uh yeah I'm a pastor Baptist. It's amazing to me how people just assume you're a pastor. I think do I look like a Baptist preacher? [laughter] I had somebody asked me that the other day at a place of business around said what do you do? I said, "I'm a preacher." Is that a Baptist church? I said, "No, not a Baptist." BUT YOU KNOW MYSELF, I DON'T JUST, HEY, LET ME GIVE YOU THIS BOOK. HEY, let me give this church TO YOU. YOU KNOW, GOD SENT A PROPHET. THAT PERSON MAY not even know the Lord Jesus as their savior. Let's get them saved first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that's a lot of what we've done the message. We pull people in the message before they ever got saved, before they ever met the Lord Jesus. Preach, Brother Donnie. Come on. &gt;&gt; You see, I DON'T WANT TO make it worse for people. I want to make it better for them if I can. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Charlie Cox told me I friends of brother Charding used to live down there about 60 miles or so from where he lived and was able to spend a lot of time with him years and years ago. And I'd ask him how it was when brother Brandham was there because Actton Campground wasn't too far from where brother Charlie lived and where the old infidel was. And they'd go out and squirrel hunt in the woods and and uh they would come out and they have squirrel blood all over them. They'd go to a little country store and old Kentucky guys sitting there whittling. Anybody know what whittling is? Some of you aren't. Praise the Lord. And what part of Kentucky you from? So they'd sat there whittling, spitting ambeer, you know, out through there. There come brother Bren of men, you know, have squirrel blood all over him and his whiskers all ged out. HE DIDN'T GO AROUND, GLORY TO GOD, YOU KNOW, ELIJAH'S ON YOUR FRONT PORCH. He never told nobody who he was. And he didn't really WANT THE BROTHERS. BUT BROTHER CHARTIS SAID IT WAS absolutely amazing when he would walk up on the porch or wherever they'd go around or grocery store, whatever it was, that there was something about that presence that people would stop what they were doing. They would stop talking, stop whittling, stop spitting or amber, whatever it was, and just look and just look that would come on their face. So to me, it's more than just our mouths running around and trying to let people know what we know. It's being led by the spirit of God. Now, I'm going to make a statement that might shock some of you, but some of those preachers who actually have come into the message and turned and went away, they would have been better off to stay Baptist. &gt;&gt; They would have been better off to stay Pentecostals or Methodist. At least they just been judged for what they knew then. But for some of those who have stood in message pullpits and preached this message and said they believed it and then turn and walk away from holiness and walk away from this end time message, I hope and pray there's mercy for them. Only God knows that. But I know this. If they don't turn back and repent, Amen. and make right THE BLASPHEMOUS CHARGES against God's prophet. It will be more tolerable for them all folks THAT WAS DESTROYED at Sodom than it will be for those who've sat in a message church and turned [cough] excuse me saints. WHY? BECAUSE of truth of enlightenment. Truth is so WONDERFUL AND IT'S SO AWESOME. BUT REMEMBER, every divine truth that God shares with us, it comes with a responsibility. &gt;&gt; A responsibility. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE tonight for this truth. [cough] [clears throat] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, and after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb. The dog is turned to his own vomit again and the s that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice that Peter uses two of the lowest creatures on the earth to a Jew, a dog and a hog. &gt;&gt; And I also want you to notice that he likens them that they were a dog before and they were still a dog. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. THEY was a dog, then they become a sheep. Then they backs and went back to being a dog. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; they was a hog and then they become a sheep and then they backed and went back. They always was a dog or they always was a hog. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I I know, friends. I know. You know, I got a strange view on things anyway, but whenever I read this, this verse brings me such encouragement because I don't find myself in this verse at all cuz I am not a dog and I sure ain't no hog. You know what I is? I was a sheep. I said I'M A SHEEP. I DIDN'T ROW IT. I DIDN'T REALIZE even before I ever got saved, but I had THAT IDENTITY WAY BACK before the foundation of the world. SO SLOP DON'T INTEREST ME. And dog vomit sure don't interest me CUZ I AIN'T NO DOG. &gt;&gt; COME on somebody. CAN'T YOU SEE HOW WHEN people leave away from this word and they walk away from the message of the hour and it's been so in every age that they become worse than many people who never even knew it in THE FIRST PLACE. LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVE WALKED away from the message of the hour and what they've turned into. Do you do you REALIZE EVEN SOME THAT was preachers and preached this message years ago have turned into become agnostics and infidels don't even believe there is A GOD? THEY WOULD have been better off never to have known it. Oh my. But thank God tonight there is a people who are neither dogs nor hogs. And you ain't going back to vomit cuz you never did vomit in the first place. Come on, somebody. YOU AIN'T GOING BACK TO NO WALLOWING IN THE M BECAUSE YOU AIN'T NO HOG. YOU WAS A SHEEP, BUT YOU WAS A LOST SHEEP, BUT YOU WASN'T A LOST DOG and you wasn't a lost hog. YOU WAS JUST A LOST SHEEP. SO I ASK YOU, when the prodical son was down in the pig pin, was he a dead boy or a dead pig? WAS HE A DEAD DOG or a DEAD PIG? BUT HIS FATHER SAID, "MY SON WHICH WAS DEAD is alive again." THE FATHER DID NOT SAY, "MY BOY BECOME A PIG. MY BOY BECOME a hog." OH NO. HE ALWAYS was his boy. HE LEFT THE FATHER'S HOUSE AS A BOY. HE WAS OUT OF FELLOWSHIP AS A BOY. HE WAS IN THE MUD HOLE AS A BOY. BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD, HE COME TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. [snorts] Now let us move into a another realm here. Acts chapter 16 verse 16. And it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination. Now listen carefully now. This is not a circus fortune teller. &gt;&gt; This is an individual who has become possessed by a demon power of divination. Anybody know what the word divination means? Well, I'm going to read it to you. Divination. Puthon. In Greek mythology, the name of the Pytheian serpent or dragon that dwelt in the region of Pythonus Fosius and was said to have guarded the oracle at Deli and slain by Apollo. In the Greek text, it is the spirit of the pythons. So now REMEMBER THIS LITTLE WOMAN WAS NOT WORKING at a circus as I said or some carnival and able to let me give me your palm, give me your palm and read the lines. No, this one was a real one. &gt;&gt; By that I mean she had submitted her soul over to the devil and a spirit of divination. So you mean demons can divine? They most certainly can. &gt;&gt; Now Satan is not all knowing, but Satan does know certain things and he even knows certain future things. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and look at me all bugeyed. Don't you remember, brother talking about brother Richard Blair? &gt;&gt; And brother Richard Blair got really sick and almost died. And before that happened, brother Brennham said the devil tried to get brother Blair to deny brother Brennham and question him about some things and it was quite a struggle there in brother Richard Blair's mind and then this sickness come ON HIM AND HE ALMOST died and brother Brandon refers back to it and said Satan knew he was going to need me. Now, how did the DEVIL KNOW THAT? WELL, YOU SEE, THERE'S CERTAIN things that father will allow him to know if it's going to be beneficial to the kingdom of God. Now, he knew that THERE WOULD BE A MESSIAH. He didn't know exactly the time frame, the period because of the way that God veiled in the in the scripture, but he KNEW THERE WOULD BE. BUT NOW WHAT I FIND so amazing is right before the Lord Jesus was born here surfaces the name Yeshua. Yeshua. Of course that's that's the Hebrew word for Joshua. And that word was used for many years. Parents would name their children AFTER JOSHUA. BUT IT'S LIKE IT ENTERED into a state of low for many many years. Even in the Bible reading through it, you don't find very many after certain time frame where they named their children Yeshua or Joshua. BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE COMES THIS SURGE. Now watch even when Jesus referred to it said, "So did you think the Galileans that were killed at the tower, did you think they were GREATER SINNERS OR WHAT ABOUT THIS man that is that led this many people off? AND WHAT ABOUT THIS man that done this?" And the prophet said, "Satan always forerunning the true to mess up people's minds." &gt;&gt; Is it any wonder then in our age that we have the fire worshippers? Any wonder in our age that we would have all of that stuff that come from California, the blue flame worshippers and all, you know, the the Elijah's and John Alexander Dowy buried up in Zion, Illinois and a and Elijah's robe and going to start a little bit of heaven on earth for those of you that have been there and aware OF IT. WHAT WAS IT? SATAN FOR RUNNING. NOW, HE DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY the day, the year, or the month, BUT IT'S LIKE GOD GIVES HIM A SEASON BY WHICH THE TIME THAT I'M GOING to do a certain thing, this is the season. And he can watch the move of God on the earth and see where it's at. And he's been able to read it long well enough to be able to know this is the time. I wonder with all my heart, friends, if that's why all hell is not coming against the bride of Christ like never before. Satan can hear what God's men are preaching. He can see and hear your cries of you crying for your children that are lost, that are backset. He hears your heart's cry. You want more of the Lord. Is that right? NOW, SATAN MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY THE DAY OR THE HOUR. I don't believe he does as far as when the Lord's going to come. But he can see by the urgency and the reciprocating part on in our part from heaven. And he watches us and sees and and looks at the men of God, what they're preaching and where they are. And said, "Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I I better pay attention right here. I might miss an opportunity. LISTEN WHAT GOD I KNOW THERE'S A BUNCH OF FOLKS in the message that don't believe in preachers, and it shows how dumb they are, cuz the devil sure does. As a matter of fact, the devil's kind of keeping up with the time. Not because he listens to the tapes, but because he's listened to God call and listen what they're preaching right now. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody wake up and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. SO, whenever Elizabeth and Zacharias, imagine the angel of the Lord appears to them AND SATAN'S TELLING HIS, "HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. Did you HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR WHAT THAT ANGEL TOLD THEM? that that that THAT MESSENGER. HEY, HEY, WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS THAT? WHERE IS THAT? TURN OVER. Malachi 3, Isaiah 40. Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, it's getting close. THAT THAT THEY SAID WHAT THAT ANGEL TOLD them was that he would forun that that messenger, that covenant. We better pay really close attention. GO OUT THERE AND GET THEM FALSE PROPHETS READY AND GET THEM PEOPLE FROM GALILEE and cause THIS TO RAISE UP AND THAT RAISE UP BECAUSE that scarecrow will scare them keep on whenever the real thing comes and they'll oh it's just another false prophet &gt;&gt; I wonder what he's telling these demons down in hell now &gt;&gt; hit THEM PEOPLE WITH EVERYTHING YOU GOT TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER LIKE THEY AIN'T NEVER LOVED ONE FATHER, THEY'RE TRYING TO CLEAN UP THEIR LIVES. THEY'RE TRYING TO BE THE KIND OF PEOPLE. COULD Could the the rapture be close? COULD IT BE CLOSE? I'M FIXING TO GET THE earth cuz that's what HE WANTS. IS MY IS MY TIME THIS CLOSE? THAT'SN'T THEM GUYS. Listen to them what they're saying. Have you NOTICED THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT EMPHASIZING THIS DOCTRINE AND THIS IDEOLOGY? THEY'RE EMPHASIZING THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE STAT OF A PERFECT MAN. AND THEY'RE PREACHING, WE GOT TO GO ON AND WE GOT TO FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER AND WE GOT TO BE WHAT GOD WANTS US TO BE. OH, THAT THAT'S UNUSUAL FOR THEM MESSAGE PEOPLE. THEY FUSS AND FOUGHT FOR YEARS. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Unusual. &gt;&gt; Listen up, devil. &gt;&gt; It's just about home time. &gt;&gt; GLORY. [applause] I don't KNOW THE DAY NOR THE HOUR, but I believe we are close. NOW NOTICE IN THIS woman possessed with a spirit of divination, spirit of a serpent, met us which brought her masters much gain by sooth, saying, look at the meaning of this word to act as a seer. prophet &gt;&gt; deliver an oracle prophesy divine. &gt;&gt; So she was a diver, &gt;&gt; a soothsayer. Uh she had some no doubt accurate things that were said. Now, her masters, which is plural, made a lot of money because a demon was in this girl's body. &gt;&gt; And she wasn't working at a carnival, but she was actually divining some things &gt;&gt; and able to tell people things. Boy, I believe this is about the quietest y'all ever been since I've been here for 38 years. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; SO SHE WAS a diver and a soothsayer. Now remember that's what they also called Balum in the Old Testament, a soothsayer. &gt;&gt; So they she met them which brought her master's much gain by soothsaying. Now remember, brother Random tells us that there was such things of course as real mediums and this is one of them. The same followed Paul and us. Now remember the book of Acts was written by Luke. So Paul and us. So it was Luke and whoever else the brothers that was with him. SO THE SAME FOLLOWED Paul and us and cried saying &gt;&gt; these men are the servants of the most high God LION [screaming] &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; this DEMONPOSSESSED WOMAN &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; is using the same name of God that God revealed to Abraham Elon M &gt;&gt; I find this so amazing because a demon-possessed woman recognize men of God &gt;&gt; quicker than church people do. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; These men are the servants OF THE MOST HIGH GOD which show unto us &gt;&gt; the way of salvation. Well, if we believed in women and preachers, we'd say, "Preach it, sister." Can you imagine a woman who in her body a demon so possesses her soul that no doubt in the realm of vision which is the fourth dimension. She would be able to see things that were accurate and true. maybe even hear words and hear names that were said because remember she kept making a lot of money for these guys. Had it been guessing that throw pimmons and apples and pears and stuff at them wrote them out of town. &gt;&gt; But she had a lot of return customers. &gt;&gt; Why? She's telling them some things that was exactly right. Now, it doesn't mean everything she said was true, &gt;&gt; but there was some things she divined. &gt;&gt; THESE MEN ARE THE SERVANTS OF THE MOST HIGH GOD, WHICH SHOW UNTO us the way of salvation. And thus did she many days. But Paul being grieved turned and said, notice who he talks to. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To the spirit. Oh yeah. HE DON'T SAY IT TO THE GIRL CUZ SHE'S NOT THE one that is doing the divining. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT HER INTELLIGENCE. A FRIEND, CAN YOU understand what I'm saying? THAT SHE HAD a supernatural intelligence that was telling her things that were right and it was a demon. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a demon-possessed person talking about y'all need to y'all need to hear these preachers? They're telling the truth. I I'm telling you what, these preachers are telling the truth. And that person was full of the devil. And yet some other people which is full of the devil called them liars and false prophets. You know why? Different devils and different bodies. &gt;&gt; Some are called to do this. Others are called just to stir up people's minds and the rabble and all that sort of thing. And it's same it's from the same kingdom. But remember these devils can't get along with one another. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID THE DEVIL CANNOT LOVE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. YOU IMAGINE THESE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE serving him. He does not love one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he don't even like them. &gt;&gt; They will live their entire life for him, their master, which hates them. &gt;&gt; He wants to take them to hell with him. &gt;&gt; He has no heaven. He has no love. He has no mercy. Has no healing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank God I don't live for him. &gt;&gt; Thank God you don't live for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEN PAUL TURNED AND SAID TO the spirit, "I command thee." Praise [laughter] God. [sighs] You think sons of God haven't moved from the Old Testament to the New? You ever remember when the angel of God stood there in the book of Zechariah and Joshua the high priest went before God and when he did there was this accuser the devil sir &gt;&gt; and he stood there with spotted garments all over him &gt;&gt; the angel of God come and THE LORD SAID CLOTHE HIM TAKE HIS FILTHY GARMENTS AND CLOTHE HIM IN righteousness who was it Christ. Of course, EVEN WHEN MOSES DIED and the the devil come looking for his body AND THAT ANGEL STOOD THERE, NEVER F NEVER FELL, NEVER SINNED, NEVER LIED, BUT he didn't even have the authority to rebuke the devil on his own authority, but he said, "The Lord rebuke you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But here's a son of God, hallelujah, filled with the Holy Ghost. AND HE SPEAKS TO THAT DEMON OF DIVINATION and he does not say the Lord rebuke you. &gt;&gt; I COMMAND thee &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. &gt;&gt; And he came out that same hour. So, we have a woman with a spirit of divination and we have a man with a spirit of the divine. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll take that one any day out of the way. What about you? Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD SO LIVED IN this man's body that when he heard that voice of that anointed son of God, he got scared and left. &gt;&gt; And of course, they were all so happy. &gt;&gt; They were so proud that she was delivered and set free. And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, well, they really cared about her and her soul, didn't they? &gt;&gt; They cared about her being lost and all that sort of thing. WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEIR HOPE OF THEIR GAINS WAS GONE, THEY CAUGHT Paul and Silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought THEM TO THE MAGISTRATE, SAYING, "These men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city." Lie lie. They trouble their pocketbook. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. BUT THEY KNEW THAT WOULDN'T GET THESE old boys thrown in jail if they'd tell the TRUTH. SO, YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO MAKE up lies on men of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND TEACH CUSTOMS WHICH ARE NOT LAWFUL FOR US to receive, neither to observe BEING ROMANS. OH, DUMB DEVIL AGAIN. This man that JUST CAST OUT THIS DEVIL was a Roman. &gt;&gt; And the multitude ROSE UP TOGETHER AGAINST THEM. FICKLE MULTITUDE, the rabble. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "Amen. Our nation's full of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You could have a mutiny of saying that Humpty Dumpty is not God and there'd be some of these idiotic Americans that would follow it. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand why they've turned down God's truth? And the nation that forgets God shall be turned into hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; And the multitude rose up together AGAINST THEM, AND THE MAGISTRATES RENT OFF THEIR CLOTHES AND COMMANDED TO BEAT them when they had laid many stripes upon them and cast them into the prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. Oh, how Satan seeks TO BE REVENGE ON [screaming] PAUL FOR dispossessing this demon out of this woman's body. YOU SEE, IT'S NOT JUST THE MAGISTRATES. IT'S NOT JUST THOSE PEOPLE WHO LOST IT, BUT THEM DEMONS ARE SO mad &gt;&gt; because a son of God is on the EARTH TO CAST OUT DEVILS &gt;&gt; and it makes them demons so aggravated. &gt;&gt; So they're going to raise up a persecution against them. Wow. So guess what? If we dis disrupt the devil and disturb him, we can expect him to lose his cool. &gt;&gt; Disrupt. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you know what IT'S GOING TO CAUSE HIM TO DO? IT'S GOING TO CAUSE HIM TO CAUSE US TROUBLE AND DISTURB US. WHY? He's getting back at us. &gt;&gt; He don't believe that scripture. I will repay, sayeth the Lord. But if you tear up the kingdom of hell, the kingdom of hell's GOING TO COME AT YOU. But I say, "Come on, devil. Come on, devil. If I'm ordained of God to tear up hell, I'll be able to bear the consequence. Oh, Brother Donnie, be careful. I'm I'm careful. I'm careful. All right. But I ain't going to be so careful. I'm a big coward. Come on, somebody. I believe WE ARE ORDAINED OF GOD TO CAST OUT DEVILS, TO HEAL THE SICK. AMEN. TO DRIVE DEMONS OUT OF PEOPLE'S BODIES AND SET THE CHILDREN OF GOD FREE FROM MANY OF THESE OPPRESSIVE THINGS. [applause] I warn you, such ministers THAT MAKE THE GREATEST TURMOIL FOR hell &gt;&gt; will also pay a great price. &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Sure they will. That's part of being who we are. AND THEY WILL GET THE GREATEST OPPOSITION, of course. BUT NOTICE then that if THE LORD JESUS KNOWING that it would come to this way upon the earth that there would BE RULERS OF DARKNESS that would come against us that he wouldn't just have preachers like Paul and men of God down through the ages but they would also have pastors and teachers and evangelists that would never be a prophet, never have a prophetic word. maybe. But they're called and anointed of God to teach the word, to live the word, to pray for God's sick sheep, &gt;&gt; and watch the devil leave them. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; notice Acts 19:13. Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcist, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches." And there were seven sons of onekea a Jew and chief of the priest which did so. Notice now AND THE EVIL SPIRIT answered and said, Jesus I know and Paul I know, &gt;&gt; but who are ye? They should have known right then they was in bad trouble. &gt;&gt; CUZ WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CAST OUT A DEVIL &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL YOU'RE TRYING TO CAST OUT DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; you're on the wrong side of the fight. &gt;&gt; NOW, CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT DEMONS IN HELL know God's servants &gt;&gt; and God's sheep? I tell you one thing. If I ever get in a mess of trouble, that's the kind of man of God I want praying for me. &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. THEY THOUGHT BY TAKING A secondhanded name, A SECONDHANDED EXPERIENCE. NOW, THEY were already exorcist. I'm not sure if they had any success or not, you know, but they they thought we're going to come into the message a little bit. SO, WE HEAR THESE GUYS USING the name of Jesus. The name of Jesus. the name OF JESUS. SO, WE'RE GOING to we're going to update a little bit and we're going to commend the message. So, they grab this old boy and they said, "I'll tell you what in THE NAME OF JESUS WHOM PAUL PREACHES, YOU COME OUT OF THERE." That old boy said, "Whoa, Jesus, I know. PAUL, I know, but who are you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, let's see how the story ends. And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped &gt;&gt; on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. &gt;&gt; Imagine these old boys didn't use the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches no more. YOU SEE, FRIEND, I DON'T WANT TO STAND UP AND TRY TO CAST OUT DEVILS IN THE NAME OF JESUS WHO BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACHED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; OH, SATAN, BROTHER BRAND, I'M ASS SURE YOU WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE. UH-UH. That ain't the way I'm going to do it. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. IF I'M GOING TO CAST OUT DEVILS, I DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHO PETER PREACHED, WHO PAUL PREACHED. HALLELUJAH. I WANT THAT DEVIL TO KNOW ME. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT THEM DEVILS TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE. NOT DONNIE REAGAN'S GRANDDAUGHTER, NOT DONNIE REAGAN'S NEPHEW, DONNIE REAGAN'S NIECE, JD'S GRANDDAUGHTER. YOU WANT EVERY ONE OF THEM DEVILS TO KNOW, "OH, THAT'S Oh my goodness, that's that's so and so. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a young girl. Oh my goodness, that girl." You talking about tough to tangle with that little girl. Yeah, you know her name. Absolutely. I know her name. I've been assigned to her house a few times before. I've tried to afflict her with high blood, low blood, no blood. I've tried to afflict her with all kinds of things. That little old skinny things gets in there in the closet and she goes to praying and goes to crying a little bit AND GOES TO JERKING AND SHOUTING AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND TALKING IN SOME kind of tongue. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. I'VE RUN OUT OF THAT CLOSET WITH MY FINGERS IN MY EARS JERKING MY HAIR TRYING TO GET OUT OF HEADING BACK TO HELL AS FAST AS I CAN. THIS AIN'T JUST GOOD FOR THE PREACHER. THIS AIN'T JUST GOOD FOR THE DEACON BOY. IT'S GOOD FOR EVERY CHILD OF GOD. SO YOU CAN KNOW WHO YOU [screaming] ARE. AND NOT ONLY YOU, BUT THEY KNOW who you are. [applause] [sighs and gasps] [panting] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [snorts] [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] So if this is what we're fighting against, what do I need in my diary chest? Theology, feelings, emotions. That's good. We believe in that. We've got We got feelings. We got emotions. But I've got to have an angelic help, an angelic influence. How could I, how could you, as a mortal, ever wrestle with a demon of divination? How could I ever wrestle with a demon of homosexuality or lust &gt;&gt; or denominationalism? &gt;&gt; How could I ever do it? I could and I don't have to. How could I wrestle with disease and sickness in my body and in yours? Unless, as the prophet said, may the healing angel of God who stands on this platform, may he come and minister to you tonight. You see, that's exactly what it was at the pool of Saleom. God sent down an angel of healing. Now, he might could fight wars and he might could do different things, but in that particular role, he was a healing angel. Praise the Lord. They're the ones that travel around from community to community &gt;&gt; looking up your address and bringing your healing to you. Why? There's demons of sickness, demons of disease. Remember the prophet whenever he by vision in that fourth dimension would see those demons and the faces and the looks and you know he he described certain cancers as being like a crab and certain ones that be what he he's seeing that that's exactly what he's seeing. Remember years ago I said it was still over the old church and the prophet used the word one time only that I found and the word was oimous. Oimus. It been a long time since I'd remembered running across that. So when I went home after service, I I thought I'm going to Google that and see what in the world is there anything out there like that. Oh, I found something. All right. A creature was red and eyes and horrible. Can you imagine way back during the 50s before that name was even being used yet, God already had his prophet to call it by name. &gt;&gt; We need this message to equip us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For what's around us every day. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, it's greater than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's greater than me. But with him in us, we'll crest every wave. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. As great as angels are, yet the prophet said the prayer from a child of God will go a million miles higher than from an angel. The angels can only come and help you find your position, but they can't act in your place. Think of it. Us flawed, imperfect human beings. And God sends holy angelic beings to nurture us and help us into being the queen of heaven. And one day when it's all said and done and the prophet said that the angels will circle the earth, imagine myriads of them around the earth. And he said they'll be standing there with their heads bowed cuz we're singing songs of redemption and they're looking at you and honoring you. Imagine by the end of his ministry in 1965 the church age book was just being completed and done. By then he said the gates had already been hung. Remember the new city was not created before Jesus came down. Jesus said I go away to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; So he's creator of the new heaven and high priest at the same time. very busy fell, isn't he? So, he's been there for over 2,000 years creating this new city. The gates one gigantic pearl, the walls 216 ft tall, all these beautiful things that are there. Cuz remember, the devil will never set one foot inside that city. &gt;&gt; He's trumped all over heaven, but he ain't tromping around our new house, right? [laughter] And he said, "The angels of God are waiting breathlessly for you." Can you imagine? Angels of God waiting for us. Praise the Lord. Don't you love him tonight, children? Let's bow our heads together. If there's anyone of you here tonight that's entangled or you've got things in your life that you need the Lord to help you to get it straightened out. I believe his presence is here and he's here to help us. We've seen him do so much. We'll be here three years in February. We have seen him do so much in three years. It would be a sin for us to disbelieve. Much less all the things he did for us at the other place. So whatever you have need of tonight, he's here. It's not that you're great and I'm great. Ain't none of us great at all. It's him who's the great one. But we are commissioned by him. Hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads together. Not only our heads, of course, but our hearts. And I want you to just think now. Is there anything that the Lord brings to your heart that you need to fix, that you need to take care of? If there is, just raise your hand there before the Lord. You don't have to speak it out. Lord, you you know, Lord, you know, I I need this. I need to take care of that. Praise the Lord. Heavenly Father, we know they're here right now. The prophet likened it this way when he said, "The angels of God are here." They're waving those white flags and those demons are here waving their black flags. They're both pulling and a battle is sitting in a [snorts] ray. And he said the battle will go according to our faith. So it doesn't go because of the will of angels of God. Neither can it go because of the will of demons. It goes by the way we want it to go. So if we want victory, we want healing, we need the Holy Ghost, whatever it is, Father, that that we're in need of tonight, if our hearts can become one with that word and your logos can become a Rama word. And if you can drop it in our hearts right now, Lord Jesus by his stripes ye are healed. &gt;&gt; We quote it and quote it and quote it and we know, Lord, we know we're quoting Logos. And that's what we're supposed to do and we'll continue to do it. But oh, when the spirit of God will take that same word and it's no longer us saying it, but it's you saying it &gt;&gt; and that becomes a Rama word, which is a word with a living voice. Satan can quote the logos, but he's never yet been able to tap into the Rama because he don't have access to the living voice. But we're children and we do. Lord, there's people here tonight with needs in their bodies, in their homes, in their lives. They're children. Maybe a companion that's away, children that's backslid. Father, we just believe you tonight that you'll help them. I pray for my dear wife, Lord, at home tonight, unable to be here. In the name of Jesus, may the spirit of God go to her. I know she's streaming the service right now. May the angel of God beat me home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, I pray for now. I pray for the others. Lord, I didn't hear the prayer request, but I know of others that are sick and suffering and in need. Dear God, in the name of Jesus, may the angels of God go to your children tonight. Father, bring healing, bring deliverance, Father. Brother Jimmy and I laid our hands on Brother Dao. Lord, he brought me his prayer cost before church and his feet was just hurting him so bad. Dear God, we join together as a church body tonight for our brother. Lord, he comes and gives service after service, stands and up on his feets, the deacon, and Lord trying to serve your people. May the angel of God go back to brother Dao tonight, Father, in the name of Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We worship you, Lord Jesus. May oppression, may may sadness, hallelujah, may it leave the children of God right now in the name of Jesus. You demons of darkness that try to rob us as God's children, we're tired of you robbing us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Peace is ours. Joy unspeakable and full of glory is ours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We claim it tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; Would you minister tonight, Lord, to your children? We worship you, Lord God. Thank you, Father. Oh, praise the Lord. Can we worship him just a little bit? Why don't you lift your hands now for whatever for whatever you have need of and just claim it right now as your own. It's my inheritance. Peace, healing, my son, my daughter, my husband, my wife. I don't know where I'm going to get my house payment next month, my car payment, but he's my God. And he said in his word, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers. Psalms 37 and4, delight thyself also in the Lord, and he'll give thee the desires of thine heart. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done. Amen. Is that yours, friends? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just worship him together. Now, remember your worship, your praise is the water on the promise. Maybe some of you wondering why when you leave church and you claim something and the seed don't ever come up. It could be the amount of water that you're putting on it. And if you just give about 2 minutes, you're at the end of the service. And then you don't do it going home, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you don't give it do it in the morning when you get up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you pray over your breakfast and when you pray over your lunch, you need to stop watering that seed of healing. &gt;&gt; It's God's word. It cannot lie. &gt;&gt; Remember that's what Abraham done every day. The prophet said he watered that promise. &gt;&gt; Every day was praise. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Let's just love him together. I know some of you got small children. If you need to go home, that's all right. But for those of you that can, let's just stay and worship him right now. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's just forget about what you got to do tomorrow. Now, &gt;&gt; the journey you got to make back home. I know some of you driven over an hour or so. [music] You got that journey in front of you. [singing] &gt;&gt; But let's just think about him. [music] &gt;&gt; Think about how much he loves us and how much we love him back. See by this this moment [music] you're your [singing] he will survive if you reach [music and singing] out and touch the Lord until he [music and singing] goes. &gt;&gt; Oh thank you Jesus.

Let's just bow our heads together and we'll pray together and ask brother Joel to bless us with that song. Heavenly Father, we have been blessed to be in your sacred courts tonight of your presence. We want you to know we don't take it for granted. Dear God, we're asking you, Lord, that you just go with each of us. Keep us by your grace, Father. We pray, Lord. Maybe some of them didn't feel like they got anything tonight, but maybe by tomorrow evening or early Friday morning, they'll notice that little pain that was in that back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It ain't there no more. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That grally voice is feeling better. And that strength that seemed to be depleted, &gt;&gt; oh, they're feeling so much better. We believe them angels of God are still still visiting the communities of the saints of God. We believe it, Lord. Go with us now, Father. We plan on coming back here for church on Sunday, Lord willing.

Grant, Father, in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. want this one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you want to [singing] know where I'm [singing] going, where I'm going [singing] one day soon.
