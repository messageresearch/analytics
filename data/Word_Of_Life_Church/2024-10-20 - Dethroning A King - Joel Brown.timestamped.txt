[44:27] now I'll just go ahead and let you know
[44:28] in
[44:30] closing I'm closing now okay I'm
[44:34] wrapping things up right now right in
[44:37] the beginning Isaiah 14 verse
[44:41] 13 Isaiah 14 and
[44:44] 13 for thou Hast said in thine heart I
[44:49] will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my
[44:53] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[44:55] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[44:57] ation in the sides of the north verse 14
[45:00] I will Ascend above the heights of the
[45:02] clouds I will be like the most high
[45:05] Isaiah 14:5 says yet Thou shalt be
[45:09] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[45:13] pit I'm going to give you a little time
[45:15] to say what you got to say but let me
[45:17] know let me let you know one thing devil
[45:21] you're going to be brought
[45:23] down sometimes it's best to let people
[45:25] just get it out whatever they got to say
[45:26] don't interrupt them don't stop them but
[45:28] let them know once they finish who you
[45:30] are in Christ huh let the devil Rumble
[45:33] let the devil Roar let the devil say
[45:35] what he's going to say let the devil do
[45:36] what he's going to do just give him that
[45:38] space because we know who we
[45:41] are and we know in the from this message
[45:43] that that this bride this body knows
[45:46] what he wants that's a powerful thing
[45:49] that she knows what he wants done with
[45:51] the word so let's get to getting little
[45:55] bride m
[45:58] yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell
[46:00] to the sides of the pit that they that
[46:02] see thee shall narrowly look upon thee
[46:04] and consider thee saying is this the man
[46:06] that made the Earth to tremble that did
[46:09] Shake kingdoms that made the world as a
[46:11] Wilderness and destroy the cities
[46:13] thereof that open not the house of his
[46:18] prisoners let us bow our hearts and our
[46:23] heads father as I bow my head I can just
[46:27] hear the old song that father I bow my
[46:32] head to thee I stretch my arms to thee
[46:36] no other help I
[46:38] know so Lord I'm depending upon you the
[46:40] people are in under expectation to hear
[46:43] from you and father we count it as we
[46:46] were just sharing with them truly an
[46:48] honor and a privilege to be able to
[46:51] stand and and bring this word and if
[46:53] there's anything good that would come
[46:55] forth out of these lips today it would
[46:57] be some something that's of Eternal
[46:59] quality something's of of Eternal value
[47:02] cuz Lord I I have nothing in this life
[47:05] to to to render or to give to bring I'm
[47:07] not a wealthy person don't come from
[47:09] from stock that that uh the Silver Spoon
[47:12] wasn't wasn't in my mouth when I came
[47:14] forth Lord just an old poor boy from the
[47:16] hills of
[47:19] Virginia just growing up but Lord
[47:23] out God I'm just a a simple person as
[47:26] you
[47:27] know so Lord if you would come then we
[47:31] would be benefited by our gathering may
[47:34] we not miss it may we receive from you
[47:37] may we hear your voice may we respond to
[47:41] your inspiration and fall under the
[47:43] inunction of the message of this hour
[47:45] this father is more than words that You'
[47:48] brought to this age this is a word that
[47:51] is to prepare us to take a body change
[47:55] and as we tra through time as we go
[47:59] through our thing called
[48:01] life Lord may we be illuminators to
[48:04] those around us before we don't know who
[48:06] is and who isn't and Lord I don't even
[48:09] know what people are going through today
[48:11] that's assembled here this morning but I
[48:13] do know this that we all need you we
[48:16] need your help so Lord that's what we're
[48:19] here today just reporting to duty
[48:21] service for you the speaker and the
[48:23] hearers together may we be blessed and
[48:25] it's in Jesus Christ name we pray
[48:28] amen amen you may have your
[48:32] seats God is so good amen I'll get it in
[48:36] a minute as I often say I pay good money
[48:38] for this thing I want it to be seen I
[48:41] won't take it off just
[48:43] now it's okay y'all know who I am I'm
[48:46] not prideful like that just to say it as
[48:49] a joke I guess but I I want to just as
[48:54] as we can while we're here rather if if
[48:56] you would just go with me my little
[48:58] thought dethroning a
[49:03] king and this little booger here that we
[49:06] just read about he thinks that he's
[49:08] something even the thing that's so
[49:10] striking to me is that even after all
[49:12] this time that he's had to do what he's
[49:14] doing he still thinks he's
[49:17] something
[49:19] H and he still thinks he can can can
[49:21] throw his bluff and and and there are
[49:24] sometimes he does a pretty good job you
[49:26] know he gets us down gets us discouraged
[49:28] we go through grief we go through these
[49:29] seasons and of life and all these
[49:31] shadows and all of these things but as
[49:33] we were saying this bride knows what he
[49:35] wants done with this word even when
[49:37] she's low even when she's down even when
[49:40] she's discouraged she still has the very
[49:43] heartbeat of God within
[49:45] her your kids acting up stand in your
[49:48] position yeah your husband ain't doing
[49:52] right stand in your position
[49:55] sis throning a king a
[49:59] throne in verse 13 as we see that he
[50:02] says I will exalt my throne above the
[50:06] stars of God so watch him watch watch
[50:10] watch the watch the devil watch this old
[50:11] Slicker in this instance when and and he
[50:14] does this so uh eloquently and so uh he
[50:17] he's he's a master at it he watch him as
[50:20] he begins to throw out
[50:22] words and as he's beginning to speak
[50:25] it's all in order to deceive and to
[50:28] realign an individual's
[50:32] identity huh using words to
[50:35] realign someone's purpose their
[50:39] identity because when we hear the word
[50:41] throne what do we think of we think of a
[50:43] king we think of a king we think of
[50:45] these things so he's using words that
[50:47] that through the the mind when you hear
[50:49] that word you think well this guy he he
[50:52] must he must have a a pretty high
[50:54] position he he must be the king since he
[50:56] sits on a the throne right yeah Proverbs
[50:59] 23 and6 says uh eat not eat thou not the
[51:02] bread of him that hath an evil eye
[51:04] neither desire thou his dainty meals
[51:07] because as you think so are you yeah
[51:10] amen Proverbs 23:7 says for as he
[51:13] thinketh in his heart so is he so the
[51:16] devil is tactfully uh precise in the
[51:19] words that he uses because he has been
[51:23] there and he knows the Power of Words he
[51:25] knows what words have the ability to do
[51:27] we're talking about dethroning a king
[51:29] here Saints for in his heart for as he
[51:33] thinketh in his heart so is he so the
[51:35] devil's wanting you to get to to take on
[51:37] his identity of who he saying that you
[51:41] are yes sir and we we we know that in
[51:45] the age in which we live now that we're
[51:47] in the midst of an identity crisis
[51:49] people really don't know who they
[51:53] are when when when you have the ability
[51:56] to look at them and see that old Adams
[51:58] apple right there for
[52:00] one but what you doing with that skirt
[52:02] on what you doing with that high pitched
[52:04] voice all of these people don't know who
[52:06] they are it's an identity
[52:08] crisis it's time to wake up sitting in
[52:11] the house of God maybe you're here today
[52:12] and don't know who you really are in
[52:14] Christ I'm here to let you know there's
[52:17] a king that's trying to settle in on
[52:19] your life and it's time to Dethrone the
[52:22] king that's sitting and ruling over your
[52:25] life yes Lord
[52:27] H
[52:29] Throne a seat of Honor a stool a royal
[52:32] dignity
[52:34] Authority but dethroning a king
[52:38] dethroning means to remove from the
[52:40] throne to remove from a prominent or
[52:43] powerful position to deprive of any High
[52:47] position or title to depose to take away
[52:51] the power and authority of you know what
[52:55] God wants done with this word this is
[52:58] this is the the prophet meant it or he
[53:00] did not mean it we either take it into
[53:03] our lives and we express it or we don't
[53:06] right because this ride we're being put
[53:08] on display in this age this is more than
[53:11] just words Saints amen this is more than
[53:14] we come to a beautiful Sanctuary a
[53:16] beautiful place have a powerful ministry
[53:19] that's here it's more than
[53:22] that it's time we stand up in our
[53:25] position it's time we stand up in the
[53:27] authority in which we've been called
[53:30] Sir dethroning a
[53:33] king so how did kingship
[53:36] begin so what what actually made a
[53:40] person begin to think that they were so
[53:42] important or so great that they
[53:44] positioned themselves above everyone
[53:46] else and that it gave them this elevated
[53:49] position where in the world did that
[53:50] come from oh
[53:54] huh I found this little expression I
[53:56] thought it was was fitting it says if
[53:58] you own the farm you own the food which
[54:02] is something everyone needs to survive
[54:04] so that makes you the
[54:06] king
[54:08] kingship some of the origins of it
[54:12] essentially there are various models in
[54:14] schools of thought regard excuse me just
[54:16] a moment while I go through this just to
[54:17] set this a little background but there
[54:19] there are various models and and and
[54:21] schools of thought regarding the
[54:22] emergence of a leadership class for
[54:24] instance in it it's in hydraulic
[54:27] civilizations meaning a civilization
[54:30] that is dependent on irrigated
[54:32] agriculture it is assumed that the
[54:35] leadership class were the people who
[54:37] planned the irrigation systems that were
[54:39] vital to everyone's survival you own the
[54:42] farm you own the food you own the
[54:46] people so in these societies that's how
[54:48] it was set up as time went on and these
[54:51] cities prospered the leaders begin watch
[54:54] what they do the leaders begin to assume
[54:56] mystical or mythical qualities which
[55:00] transform them into priests and
[55:02] eventually God Kings of their
[55:06] societies these little
[55:08] kingdoms begin to build up we see it in
[55:11] church people think that they something
[55:13] because they got money or their their
[55:14] dad is the pastor or my uncle's this
[55:16] that and they begin to put themselves in
[55:18] an elevated position and what so sad
[55:21] about it is there are some people that
[55:22] follow along behind that
[55:25] thing on
[55:27] I'm not a Reagan I'm a brown okay I
[55:31] don't need to be a Reagan to think that
[55:33] I'm anything
[55:34] hello I don't descend from the brandom
[55:39] stock all y'all cute folk are getting
[55:41] quiet on me get
[55:45] tight ain't no breaks on
[55:47] me I say so comically all the time with
[55:50] the expression Jesus Take the Wheel I be
[55:53] Jesus take the whole car
[55:56] M I don't want to drive anymore you I
[55:59] just want you to be in
[56:02] control
[56:04] amen people thinking that there's
[56:06] something simply because of from where
[56:07] they came our identity is in Jesus
[56:10] Christ our our our power our Authority
[56:13] is because of the shed blood of Calvary
[56:16] amen that's the only thing that'll do so
[56:20] let's go on note that this is why there
[56:22] is a prevalence of Thrones having
[56:25] mythical answers history which seems to
[56:27] be the Common Thread among all these
[56:29] different civilization models Pharaoh's
[56:32] for for instance claim to trace their
[56:35] ancestry to Horus an actual God in the
[56:38] Egyptian uh
[56:41] Pantheon right even modern Thrones tend
[56:44] to have this myth myth mythical origin
[56:47] with the Throne of England being myth
[56:49] mythically entwined with King
[56:51] Arthur so mythology comes into play
[56:54] that's that's demonology to
[56:57] me today of course we scoff at such
[57:00] claims but the fact is that kingly
[57:03] Thrones were often entwined with
[57:05] mythology to confer a sense of divine
[57:08] legitimacy to the monarchs yeah yeah and
[57:12] they were just mortal beings like
[57:13] everybody else that's right they got up
[57:15] in the morning their hair was all over
[57:16] their head their breath was stinky yeah
[57:19] they had drool running off the side of
[57:21] their face huh they were no different
[57:25] than anybody else but because of this
[57:26] position they begin to think that they
[57:28] were something and the devil moved in on
[57:31] that elevated thought thinking that they
[57:33] were having that I'm somebody you're a
[57:35] nobody come
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:38] on
[57:41] Amen we scoff at such claims
[57:44] today rather Kings emerg let me back up
[57:48] today of course we scoff at such claims
[57:50] but the fact is that kingly Thrones were
[57:52] often entwined with mythology to confer
[57:55] a sense of divine legitimacy to the
[57:57] monarchs and rather Kings emerged from
[58:01] the fusion of leadership classes or
[58:04] leadership roles and a common mythology
[58:07] which effectively created a paradigm
[58:10] that the entire Society can agree on as
[58:13] their reality so they begin to construct
[58:17] this uh this uh uh a style this position
[58:22] and eventually society would follow
[58:24] along behind it
[58:26] so there are spirits that will creep
[58:28] into churches and get behind uh
[58:30] Ministries and things that they're
[58:31] trying to build up a kingdom around
[58:34] themselves on and I was telling you I'm
[58:37] not here to give you anything but Jesus
[58:38] Christ I don't have anything else to
[58:40] give
[58:41] you I said I'm just an old country
[58:44] boy grew up out in the what the what we
[58:47] refer to is the holler oh yeah grew up
[58:50] running around in the summertime no
[58:51] shoes and running through the manure
[58:54] squishing through the toes and playing
[58:56] in the creek and and sanding minnows and
[58:58] catching croads and all of these things
[59:00] and plucking chicken feathers and all of
[59:02] these things yeah going out to the well
[59:04] and carrying the water and toting and
[59:06] fetching water and bringing it into the
[59:08] house with taking a bath in an old
[59:10] number 10 bathtub and heat the water up
[59:12] on the old stove and during the winter
[59:13] time the the old bucket that was there
[59:15] the Dipper that we would use for our
[59:17] water and some of you old folk know I'm
[59:18] only 54 years old but this is a reality
[59:21] to me these are things that that I grew
[59:22] up with so I'm telling you all of this
[59:24] I'm a nobody I'm nothing
[59:26] nothing but Christ makes us everything
[59:30] amen identity is in him you're in the
[59:33] winter time that old Dipper the bucket
[59:35] of water would be frozen solid where the
[59:38] stove had gone out during the night and
[59:40] the house was cold and have all these
[59:41] blankets on top of us be afraid to move
[59:43] in the mornings when you wake up it's
[59:44] you're going to lose your warm spot so
[59:46] you got to lay
[59:50] still I'm a
[59:52] nobody I don't have anything to give you
[59:55] but Jesus Christ Christ if you need my
[59:58] coat I'll let you have that but in that
[1:00:00] coat when you put it on know that you're
[1:00:02] putting on Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ you need some shoes I'll get you
[1:00:06] some shoes but when you put them on know
[1:00:08] that you're walking in
[1:00:12] Holiness cuz why brother Joel why you
[1:00:15] say that because there there will be a
[1:00:16] gift to you from the heart and
[1:00:18] compassion of God
[1:00:23] himself the Pharaoh doesn't just lead
[1:00:26] because he plans all the infrastructure
[1:00:28] projects and has an army to kill any
[1:00:30] Rebels he's the leader because people
[1:00:32] actually believe he is descended from
[1:00:34] the gods and to disobey him is to
[1:00:37] subvert the will of the Gods just laying
[1:00:40] a foundation it is that combination that
[1:00:43] allowed them to rule and with great
[1:00:45] success and stability for a period
[1:00:48] longer than the entire Christian era so
[1:00:52] when I began to look at the history of
[1:00:54] kingship and we all of this was found
[1:00:56] and how it came into view I found it
[1:00:59] fascinating how that that when uh when
[1:01:04] even with like the Egyptians in
[1:01:06] particular specifically that when when
[1:01:08] they um began to to create this power
[1:01:12] structure and time and time again that
[1:01:14] that structure that they created would
[1:01:17] would collapse but there was something
[1:01:19] on the inside of of these people that
[1:01:22] concept that demonic construct was so
[1:01:26] powerful within them that even after
[1:01:28] that that there it would topple time and
[1:01:30] time and time again there was something
[1:01:31] on the inside of them that that was so
[1:01:34] uh tied within their DNA that they just
[1:01:37] had to build that thing
[1:01:39] back
[1:01:40] huh here you what what is it you're
[1:01:43] going to think that some man is King and
[1:01:45] Lord and he has some mythological uh uh
[1:01:47] entity or position or power what was
[1:01:49] that it was the it was the power of
[1:01:52] Hell dethroning a king keep in mind
[1:01:56] but they were intentional about this
[1:01:58] thing until he finally that old order
[1:02:00] was reestablished Rose back up again
[1:02:03] yeah and it isn't the will of God for
[1:02:06] man to rule over man
[1:02:10] no the rejected King the prophet talks
[1:02:13] about this very principle he says in
[1:02:15] fact God sent the Holy Ghost to rule in
[1:02:18] man's hearts and rule in their lives
[1:02:21] that's who's to be the ruler over our
[1:02:23] lives not some man not some King not not
[1:02:26] some Bishop not some
[1:02:28] Queen God sent the Holy Ghost to rule
[1:02:31] over our lives and if you can't be led
[1:02:33] of the Lord then you can't be led of
[1:02:35] anybody else that's
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:40] right he goes on to say in the message
[1:02:43] rejected King that there are even some
[1:02:45] who want others to rule over there there
[1:02:47] are people that that want people to rule
[1:02:49] over
[1:02:51] them he says but man Wants to Rule and
[1:02:54] Rule over man and man wants man to rule
[1:02:56] over him he doesn't want to have God to
[1:03:01] rule if God is Not ruling in your life
[1:03:05] then there's another king that's
[1:03:07] dictating what you
[1:03:10] do there's another king taking rule in
[1:03:13] your life and we're here today to help
[1:03:15] you destroy that King to help you
[1:03:18] Dethrone that King yes sir sir it's
[1:03:22] laying Foundation
[1:03:26] it's a demonic construct Luke 10:18 says
[1:03:29] and he said unto them I beheld Satan as
[1:03:31] Lightning fallen from heaven and we know
[1:03:33] this instance in the scriptures that he
[1:03:35] he'd sent 60 away two by two to go do
[1:03:38] his work to go uh uh to compel people
[1:03:40] and to go uh Minister and do all of
[1:03:42] these things and they come back all
[1:03:44] excited the devils are subject unto us
[1:03:48] and then he picks it up here and he
[1:03:49] begins to speak to them and he says and
[1:03:51] he said unto them I beheld Satan as
[1:03:53] Lightning falling from heaven
[1:03:57] verse 19 in Luke uh 10 behold I give you
[1:04:01] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[1:04:03] and over all the power of the
[1:04:06] enemy and I declare to you today if it
[1:04:09] was good enough for them it's good
[1:04:10] enough for me that's right it's good
[1:04:13] enough for
[1:04:14] us it's good enough for Word of
[1:04:17] Life the power to tread on serpents and
[1:04:20] scorpions and over all the power of the
[1:04:21] enemy and nothing nothing by any means
[1:04:24] shall hurt you
[1:04:27] you oh it may hurt this but it ain't
[1:04:30] going to hurt this
[1:04:32] Soul you may get me down sometime devil
[1:04:35] but I guarantee you I'm going to get
[1:04:37] back
[1:04:38] up there's something about of True
[1:04:41] Believer even when they are down there's
[1:04:43] something on the inside of them that
[1:04:45] causes them to get back
[1:04:48] up you keep rallying around that son of
[1:04:51] yours you keep rallying around that
[1:04:52] daughter of yours there's something on
[1:04:55] the inside of you that's able to stand
[1:04:57] even for them when they can't don't give
[1:05:00] up on
[1:05:03] them say as I say kids you can't eat
[1:05:06] them for breakfast and you can't kill
[1:05:08] them get in
[1:05:13] trouble notwithstanding in this Rejoice
[1:05:16] not that the spirits are subject unto
[1:05:17] you but rather Rejoice because your
[1:05:19] names are written in
[1:05:21] heaven he says behold I I saw him
[1:05:23] falling from Heaven the Shining Light
[1:05:27] begin to fall from heaven heaven the
[1:05:31] seat of Order of Things Eternal and
[1:05:36] consant
[1:05:39] perfect so he says I saw him fall as a
[1:05:44] Shining Light from
[1:05:47] heaven so this thing that
[1:05:51] was from the Eternal and as that
[1:05:55] definition says consumat
[1:05:59] perfect where God dwells in other
[1:06:02] Heavenly beings so he was uh an eternal
[1:06:06] he was uh uh he was a Heavenly being
[1:06:10] that fell as a Shining
[1:06:13] Light and what's amazing to me is that
[1:06:17] God watched him as he fell yeah think
[1:06:21] about it God watching this eternal
[1:06:24] creature this Heavenly being this this
[1:06:27] uh consant perfect being
[1:06:31] far watching him
[1:06:35] fall that word
[1:06:37] beheld is a Greek word it means to be a
[1:06:43] spectator God was a spectator to look at
[1:06:46] to behold to perceive with the eyes to
[1:06:50] discern to ascertain find out by seeing
[1:06:54] this word listen this this word is not
[1:06:56] used of an indifferent spectator but of
[1:06:59] one who looks at a thing with interest
[1:07:02] and of a purpose with a
[1:07:05] purpose it would be used of a general
[1:07:08] officially reviewing or inspecting his
[1:07:10] army of a lay spectator looking at a
[1:07:13] parade so God says I beheld Satan I
[1:07:17] watch this this this being this heavenly
[1:07:20] being
[1:07:22] fall and as I begin to look at this and
[1:07:25] and as I begin to see that definition I
[1:07:27] began to think why didn't God stop
[1:07:30] him why didn't God catch him in his fall
[1:07:34] why didn't God stop him from
[1:07:36] falling Jesus of Nazareth in 1958 the
[1:07:39] prophet says the woman touched His
[1:07:40] Garment virtue went out and she got her
[1:07:43] healing but there was a Roman soldier
[1:07:46] who put a band of Rags around his head
[1:07:48] and hit him on the head with a stick and
[1:07:50] said prophesier tell us who hit you and
[1:07:53] we'll believe you he never open his
[1:07:56] mouth and said a word to him God doesn't
[1:07:58] clown he doesn't have to he's God you're
[1:08:01] the one that needs to plead for Mercy
[1:08:04] come
[1:08:05] on God why aren't you catching Me I'm
[1:08:09] Falling why isn't God catching you in
[1:08:12] your condition where you are now you are
[1:08:14] the one that needs to plead for
[1:08:17] mercy so bound up in the condition that
[1:08:20] you're in your thinking is that you're
[1:08:22] going to always be this way I'm going to
[1:08:25] always to fight this thing dethroning a
[1:08:27] king

[1:08:35] that needs to plead for mercy your

[1:08:40] your inment and not his he's done
[1:08:42] everything he can to redeem you what
[1:08:44] more do you want God to do
[1:08:49] on what more can he do he died he gave
[1:08:52] his life he even picked that life and
[1:08:55] and Rose it up again so all the world
[1:08:57] could see I'm back I'm
[1:08:59] here there is nothing more that God can
[1:09:03] do for

[1:15:16] blindly just determine to go whether God
[1:15:19] stops you or not God sends nobody to
[1:15:21] hell you send yourself to Hell by
[1:15:23] rejecting his his son yes sir you step
[1:15:28] over the boundaries of that word that's
[1:15:30] your decision and God is not obligated
[1:15:33] to catch
[1:15:36] you under the influence of this King
[1:15:39] this demonic King and his construct that
[1:15:42] he he seems to project in our minds
[1:15:44] every day I've got a lot to cover I
[1:15:45] better hurry up so from the very
[1:15:48] beginning it was Satan's ambition and
[1:15:51] desire to be like God in closing
[1:15:55] it was his desire to be like God and
[1:15:57] quite FR frankly to be even more than
[1:16:00] God right he was at one time the
[1:16:03] original Archangel of God we know these
[1:16:05] things the simple things he once held
[1:16:08] the greatest position in heaven outside
[1:16:10] of God himself but he wasn't confident
[1:16:13] he wasn't okay with that he wanted to be
[1:16:16] in a greater
[1:16:18] position he wanted God's
[1:16:20] position and that is what he's doing in
[1:16:23] your life the throne thone of your heart
[1:16:26] is the seat of God and he's after that
[1:16:30] Throne he's after that that's why he
[1:16:32] badges you that's why he bugs you that's
[1:16:34] why he buffets at you all day because he
[1:16:36] knows that there's a an eternal quality
[1:16:39] inside of you and he wants
[1:16:42] that he wants
[1:16:46] it he was God's right-hand man to
[1:16:50] Fellowship in our text as we reading
[1:16:52] Isaiah 14-13 the Bible say says that in
[1:16:55] his heart in his
[1:16:58] heart he got puffed up in his
[1:17:03] heart he wanted the worship he wanted
[1:17:06] the recognition he wanted the power he
[1:17:08] wanted the
[1:17:10] authority he simply did not have the
[1:17:13] character to match the Fulfillment of
[1:17:16] that ambition there was nothing wrong
[1:17:18] with him having an ambition there's
[1:17:20] nothing wrong with you having a desire
[1:17:22] having an ambition to be great be all
[1:17:24] these things but you have to realize
[1:17:26] there's character that has to unite with
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:31] ambition you got to have character to go
[1:17:35] with that that's why power apart from
[1:17:38] character is
[1:17:43] satanic let me say it this way the
[1:17:45] prophet said power apart from character
[1:17:49] is satanic
[1:17:51] amen maybe that'll help you get a little
[1:17:53] louder amen out there there if you
[1:17:56] condition it before and after the
[1:17:57] prophet said people
[1:18:00] amen I said the same thing 10 minutes
[1:18:03] ago and you just sat there like that
[1:18:05] bump on that
[1:18:07] pickle hey I'm not here to bring I'm not
[1:18:10] here to tell you anything that hasn't
[1:18:11] already been said that's right amen yeah
[1:18:15] is that all
[1:18:19] right he got puffed up he didn't have
[1:18:22] that character to match the Fulfillment
[1:18:23] of his ambition
[1:18:25] that's why power apart from character is
[1:18:27] satanic and we must remember you search
[1:18:29] this out in the church age book submer
[1:18:31] Church age that we must remember that
[1:18:33] character is a
[1:18:36] what
[1:18:39] victory character is a victory it's not
[1:18:43] just given to you you're going to have
[1:18:44] to work at this thing you say I want to
[1:18:46] be like brother Donnie bless God Brother
[1:18:49] Don be talking about these young
[1:18:49] ministers coming up they think having a
[1:18:51] position to do all these things where
[1:18:53] are you been what have you done
[1:18:55] have you sat long enough in the presence
[1:18:57] of God to really find out what is it
[1:18:59] that I'm going to be doing
[1:19:01] yeah and while I'm here let me just
[1:19:03] share this just personally just let you
[1:19:05] in a little bit I know this years ago
[1:19:08] 1994 when God called me to to preach
[1:19:11] and as I went as I went on in in in in
[1:19:15] and in life and things and I began I
[1:19:17] began to get a little uh a little
[1:19:20] uncertain Lord what what is it you want
[1:19:21] me to do where you want me to go and
[1:19:22] people be asking me are you getting out
[1:19:24] and preaching you I what wasn't going
[1:19:25] out very
[1:19:26] much but I found out that that my
[1:19:29] calling at that as as U my family began
[1:19:33] to grow that that I was needed more at
[1:19:37] home now I had invitations to go all
[1:19:39] over the world to be honest with you but
[1:19:42] I just
[1:19:44] didn't
[1:19:46] yeah sometimes people don't understand
[1:19:49] the Simplicity of God that's right and
[1:19:51] they think because this one is doing
[1:19:53] that then everybody else needs to follow
[1:19:55] that and do that but you need to find
[1:19:58] out your purpose your calling your gift
[1:20:01] as your pastor he's been telling us it's
[1:20:03] essential it's important to the
[1:20:05] functioning of the body because when
[1:20:08] there's a need that arises in the body
[1:20:10] there has to be some part of that body
[1:20:12] that can go and minister to that need at
[1:20:15] that time at that moment and when the
[1:20:18] purpose of that function is over then
[1:20:20] somebody else will pick it up later
[1:20:22] that's that's what it's all about it's
[1:20:23] not all it's not about just one person
[1:20:26] I'm going to shut up I need to leave
[1:20:27] that alone my
[1:20:28] goodness you tell me cross the way here
[1:20:31] which way am I cross the way here in the
[1:20:32] F PA how could have all of that
[1:20:34] transpired and been uh undertaken all of
[1:20:37] that with just one person or just 10 or
[1:20:38] 20 it took the
[1:20:40] body to function to do and when when
[1:20:44] some parts of the body got tired and
[1:20:45] they couldn't make it CU they had to
[1:20:46] work or whatever they had to do there
[1:20:47] was somebody else there to f a spot why
[1:20:49] because the body was learning to
[1:20:51] function as a
[1:20:53] whole after all a person without
[1:20:56] character cannot Reign Romans 8:17 and
[1:20:59] if children then HS HS of God and join
[1:21:01] HS with Christ if so be that we suffer
[1:21:03] with him that we may be also glorified
[1:21:05] together I got I hurry up I got so much
[1:21:07] but dethroning a king for I reckon that
[1:21:09] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:21:11] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:21:14] which shall be revealed in US amen if so
[1:21:19] that we suffer with him that's the
[1:21:23] Bible suffer with
[1:21:26] him let me ask you a question what has
[1:21:30] Satan
[1:21:31] suffered he's wanting this position in
[1:21:34] your life what has he suffer to get that
[1:21:37] position and you're just going to just
[1:21:39] just easily hand it over to him hand
[1:21:41] over your life here here's my private
[1:21:43] life here's my bedroom life here's
[1:21:45] here's here's my life when I'm at school
[1:21:47] here's my life when I'm on the job here
[1:21:48] you can have it just you know just going
[1:21:50] along with the
[1:21:51] devil he has not suffered
[1:21:55] to have the quality of the
[1:21:58] queen under his
[1:22:03] control you are more than
[1:22:05] that little bride you are more than that
[1:22:10] you said brother Joel I don't know if
[1:22:11] I'm bride or not I can't help you I'm
[1:22:13] not here to tell you that you are I'm
[1:22:15] just here to tell you what this message
[1:22:17] has said what the word of God has
[1:22:20] said if you're a crow stay a crow but if
[1:22:23] you're an eagle get get those wings set
[1:22:26] cuz it's time to take flight
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:31] am I can't tell you who you
[1:22:33] are
[1:22:35] precisely I can tell you who you should
[1:22:37] be or who you should be beginning to
[1:22:39] think that you are and begin to believe
[1:22:41] that so what exactly has Satan suffered
[1:22:44] the simple fact is character is never
[1:22:46] made without
[1:22:48] suffering and he's wanting this
[1:22:50] character he's wanting this power he's
[1:22:51] wanting this position in your life what
[1:22:53] has that devil
[1:22:56] suffered and then you going to just
[1:22:58] blindly give over yourself to him oh
[1:23:02] my and take on his identity and feed his
[1:23:06] you use his slot as your
[1:23:12] sustenance my amen the simple fact is
[1:23:16] character is never made without
[1:23:19] suffering it's a victory not a gift
[1:23:22] questions and answers in 1959 so Luci
[1:23:24] luer is on Earth
[1:23:27] today 1959 2024 I can say it bring it up
[1:23:31] to date Lucifer is on Earth today what
[1:23:35] is he doing brother Brandon trying to
[1:23:37] work in the church to accomplish the
[1:23:39] same purpose that he started before the
[1:23:42] foundation of the world why has he not
[1:23:44] given up because he knows the
[1:23:47] value of what he's
[1:23:51] wanting and if he has enough sense to
[1:23:54] know what value is in the bride why
[1:23:57] should I not understand the value and
[1:23:59] worth that's inside of me and not just
[1:24:03] give over my life my time my energy my
[1:24:06] mind everything just hand it over to the
[1:24:10] devil when I was weak brother jelan I
[1:24:12] got caught in a I don't care about
[1:24:14] weakness this is a time to stand up in
[1:24:16] the strength of who you are in
[1:24:19] Christ we're not on a picnic we're in
[1:24:21] the war we're in a battle yes you're
[1:24:24] going to get
[1:24:25] tired yes you're going to get weary but
[1:24:28] you still have to
[1:24:32] fight you fight on oh you fight on keep
[1:24:37] your
[1:24:40] hand oh
[1:24:44] my we've got to fight Saints don't give
[1:24:48] up don't get weary in your well dooing I
[1:24:51] know your kids are Knuckleheads but you
[1:24:53] don't get weary in that wello you fight
[1:24:56] on you still believe for your
[1:24:59] children you said brother Jo are strung
[1:25:02] out on drugs they're in jail they're
[1:25:03] doped up they're prostituting themselves
[1:25:06] you fight on you still
[1:25:12] believe dethroning a
[1:25:15] king So Luther is on the Earth today
[1:25:18] trying to work in the church to
[1:25:19] accomplish the same purpose that he
[1:25:21] started before the foundation of the
[1:25:22] world Lucifer was kicked out of heaven
[1:25:25] and somehow somehow the devil positioned
[1:25:28] himself between the angels and
[1:25:32] God and he ascended himself above those
[1:25:36] Stars the prophet words it that way the
[1:25:38] Stars meaning the sons of God
[1:25:40] now and preached to them and deceive
[1:25:43] 2third of them so he positioned himself
[1:25:47] between the themselves and God between
[1:25:50] the angels and
[1:25:52] God that view of calvary
[1:25:55] should be very crisp should be very
[1:25:58] clear should be in full Focus every day
[1:26:01] of our lives and if it is not whatever
[1:26:04] standing between you and your view of
[1:26:06] Calvary has at that time become your
[1:26:10] God you can believe it if you want to
[1:26:12] your pastor he's told us the same
[1:26:17] thing dethroning a
[1:26:21] king CU When he did this he saw it was
[1:26:27] effective so he did the same thing with
[1:26:31] Eve he's doing the same thing
[1:26:34] today you're sitting here looking at me
[1:26:36] you're listening to me but you ain't
[1:26:37] hearing
[1:26:40] me this is your day to Dethrone that
[1:26:44] King in your
[1:26:46] life I admonish you do not walk out
[1:26:49] those doors unless until you have given
[1:26:52] yourself full till you fully surrendered
[1:26:55] to Jesus Christ the word the life the
[1:26:58] Eternal qualities that we need to
[1:27:00] survive in this age
[1:27:03] amen you say well that's just you
[1:27:05] brother Joel you're right it is just
[1:27:09] me it
[1:27:11] is I'm of no value to
[1:27:14] you but God is getting your attention
[1:27:16] today
[1:27:20] right Prophet tells us I'm just
[1:27:21] paraphrasing you can only live an
[1:27:24] overcoming life if you receive the word
[1:27:26] that's coming from the men that are sent
[1:27:29] to you to bring the
[1:27:36] word dethroning a
[1:27:38] king he did the same thing with Eve he
[1:27:41] obstructed Eve's view Matthew 8:16 when
[1:27:44] the even was come they brought unto him
[1:27:46] many that were possessed with devils and
[1:27:50] he cast out the spirits with his word
[1:27:52] and healed all that were SI
[1:27:56] that word possessed is a Greek word and
[1:28:00] I don't want to get lost in the words so
[1:28:03] much but as I was talking about Satan
[1:28:05] come and he used the word throne he took
[1:28:09] a word and when he threw that word out
[1:28:12] it begin begin to set up in the minds of
[1:28:14] the Angels hm yeah that must be him so
[1:28:17] it's important when when you're hearing
[1:28:19] the meanings of some words it's
[1:28:20] important to to hear these meanings
[1:28:22] because it will help you understand the
[1:28:24] real meaning and not your understanding
[1:28:27] of what you think that word is
[1:28:30] okay that's what I'm doing today but but
[1:28:33] that word possessed means to be under
[1:28:36] the power of a
[1:28:38] demon the power of a demon yeah the
[1:28:42] devil's real yes the devil has power
[1:28:44] he's strong he's
[1:28:46] Mighty in the New Testament these are
[1:28:49] persons Afflicted with especially severe
[1:28:52] diseases either e bodily or mentally
[1:28:56] such as paralysis blindness deafness
[1:28:59] loss of speech epilepsy Melancholy
[1:29:02] Insanity Etc whose bodies in the opinion
[1:29:05] of the Jews demons had
[1:29:08] entered so the Jews believ when someone
[1:29:10] was possessed a demon had entered that
[1:29:12] body and so held possession of them as
[1:29:15] not only to afflict them with ills but
[1:29:18] also to Dethrone the reason and take its
[1:29:21] place themselves stealing their identity
[1:29:25] oh blinding them to the realities of who
[1:29:28] they are
[1:29:30] paralysis all of these different ills
[1:29:32] and malities within the body in their
[1:29:35] sicken condition and state they begin to
[1:29:39] lose uh an understanding of who they
[1:29:42] were well if I was laying here if I you
[1:29:44] know laying here on my back with cancer
[1:29:45] I'm dying should the Lord don't love me
[1:29:47] anymore yes he still loves
[1:29:51] you but Jo I'm battling this thing you
[1:29:53] don't he still loves you
[1:29:57] amen so that's what these people that
[1:30:00] were possessed but also to Dethrone the
[1:30:02] reason and take its place themselves
[1:30:04] accordingly the possessed were want to
[1:30:06] express the mind and consciousness of
[1:30:09] the Demons dwelling in them they begin
[1:30:11] to talk the devil's talk they begin to
[1:30:13] walk the way the devil walked they begin
[1:30:15] to think the way the demons told them to
[1:30:18] think so they took on the animation of a
[1:30:22] demon here in the body coming to church
[1:30:26] praise God got my Bible under my arm and
[1:30:28] possessed with a
[1:30:32] devil this is real yes it is this is
[1:30:36] real dethroning a
[1:30:39] king and their cure was thought to
[1:30:42] require the expulsion of the demon
[1:30:46] brother Joel Brown says
[1:30:48] amen that's the only thing that's going
[1:30:50] to help you is to be delivered of that
[1:30:53] demon
[1:30:55] amen but I go to Word of Life I don't
[1:30:59] care where you call your home church if
[1:31:02] it's something that's preventing you
[1:31:04] from seeing who you are it's a demon
[1:31:06] your demon possessed come
[1:31:09] on now the last time I checked 2 + 2 was
[1:31:14] four this is simple math this is a
[1:31:17] simple understanding of your walk with
[1:31:19] the
[1:31:22] Lord you wrapped up you think you all so
[1:31:24] holy righteous ah no I don't I know
[1:31:27] better than that mm- this old boy fight
[1:31:30] Stu too woo yes huh praise God and I
[1:31:36] blame it on my wife I blame it on my
[1:31:38] kids I blame it on my friends I blame it
[1:31:40] on no I blame it on
[1:31:44] me see it's easy to blame it on some
[1:31:47] shut up Joel get on with this you got my
[1:31:50] goodness got to hurry but in all those
[1:31:52] the L of speeech definites this epilepsy
[1:31:55] what I want to focus on this word
[1:31:56] Melancholy for just a
[1:31:58] moment possessed with Melancholy what
[1:32:01] exactly is that Melancholy has multiple
[1:32:04] meanings including a sad mood a state of
[1:32:07] depression or a serious thoughtfulness
[1:32:11] sad Moon meaning sad mood meaning a sad
[1:32:14] or gloomy State of Mind especially when
[1:32:17] it's prolonged or
[1:32:20] habitual coming to church in a sad mood
[1:32:24] for example you might describe a piece
[1:32:26] of music or Autumn days as
[1:32:28] Melancholy depression a condition
[1:32:31] characterized by a depressed mood bondly
[1:32:34] complaints and sometimes hallucinations
[1:32:36] and delusions so the devil will start
[1:32:38] something in your mind and begin to to
[1:32:40] to orchestrate it such that it it'll
[1:32:42] move into your body and you'll begin uh
[1:32:45] uh exemplifying some some conditions in
[1:32:47] your body and it starts in your mind it
[1:32:51] starts up here what does the prophet
[1:32:53] says he talks about the a little girl he
[1:32:54] says I see you your dog was running
[1:32:56] after you run up the steps and all these
[1:32:57] things that that was a scar in her mind
[1:33:00] but it set up other conditions in our
[1:33:07] body you're not sick so
[1:33:10] much something going on in your
[1:33:13] mind
[1:33:15] Melancholy a depressed sad mood sh it's
[1:33:20] okay you say Amen know where I am all
[1:33:23] right depression serious thoughtfulness
[1:33:25] a state of sober thoughtfulness or
[1:33:28] pensiveness symptoms of melancholy
[1:33:30] include melancholic sad somber
[1:33:33] despondency and
[1:33:36] dejection Melancholy is beyond sad it is
[1:33:40] a word for the gloomiest of spirits so
[1:33:44] that they were bringing people to Jesus
[1:33:46] in this condition and other conditions
[1:33:48] but I wanted to focus on just that one
[1:33:50] just for a moment so they were wrapped
[1:33:52] up in sorrow ful thoughts why because of
[1:33:56] the bumps of life and things that had
[1:33:58] happened things just happen life
[1:34:00] sometimes gets in the way of us doing
[1:34:02] what God wants us to
[1:34:05] do and when that happens that don't take
[1:34:07] away your Eternal quality amen you're
[1:34:10] still in
[1:34:12] Christ symptoms are similar to but are
[1:34:16] more severe than depression and when the
[1:34:19] even was come they brought unto him many
[1:34:20] that were possessed Matthew 8:16 I'll
[1:34:22] read it again with devils and he cast
[1:34:24] out the spirits watch this he cast out
[1:34:27] the spirits with his word and healed all
[1:34:29] that were sick how did their healing
[1:34:34] come
[1:34:36] through a word word remember the what
[1:34:40] the devil was doing with
[1:34:41] words he would take a word and he would
[1:34:44] say well this is this is this is this
[1:34:46] word whatever he'd say and the people
[1:34:49] yes but their understanding of that word
[1:34:52] was skewed because it was coming from a
[1:34:55] demonic
[1:34:57] anointing sure you're sick but the devil
[1:35:00] put that on you yes I know you're sick
[1:35:03] but who are you in Christ
[1:35:06] amen my
[1:35:08] goodness it was the utterance of a
[1:35:11] living voice Matthew 4:24 and his Fame
[1:35:14] went throughout all Syria and they
[1:35:16] brought unto him all sick people that
[1:35:17] were taken with diverse disease and
[1:35:20] torments they were taken with these
[1:35:22] things and the bringing them to
[1:35:26] Jesus you've come into this room today
[1:35:29] with whatever your situation is you've
[1:35:32] come to Jesus you've come to the word
[1:35:34] not to me not to the brothers who if you
[1:35:36] come up for pray not the brothers who
[1:35:38] will lay hands on but you're coming to
[1:35:39] the word you're coming to Jesus Christ
[1:35:43] himself in order to Dethrone that King
[1:35:46] in order to be delivered in order to be
[1:35:48] healed of these these conditions and
[1:35:50] those which were possessed with devils
[1:35:51] and those which were lunatic and those
[1:35:53] that had the py and he healed them so
[1:35:55] all of these things are mixed up and
[1:35:57] they're bringing them to
[1:35:58] Jesus heal them that word taken they
[1:36:02] were taken with divers disease that word
[1:36:04] taken means to hold together with
[1:36:07] constraint to compress and sometimes the
[1:36:10] devil will get us in such a mental
[1:36:13] condition sometimes he will press him he
[1:36:15] will get us in that condition so tight
[1:36:18] we say that we think there's no way I
[1:36:20] can get out of this to press together
[1:36:22] with the hand to hold one ears to shut
[1:36:24] the heavens that it may not rain you
[1:36:27] haven't heard God where are you I
[1:36:28] haven't heard you speak the devil is
[1:36:31] captivated your
[1:36:33] perception and it's time to Dethrone
[1:36:36] that
[1:36:37] King to press on every side of a
[1:36:40] besieged city like a straight forces a
[1:36:42] ship into a narrow channel that ship is
[1:36:45] too big your Experiencing God is too big
[1:36:49] to go down that path you're too
[1:36:51] important to God to be found in that
[1:36:54] condition amen giving your time your
[1:36:56] eyes your attention your heart your
[1:36:58] passions to that thing you're too great
[1:37:01] of a creature and being in Christ to go
[1:37:04] where you've
[1:37:05] been to stay and remain where you are
[1:37:09] like a cattle squeeze pushing in on each
[1:37:12] side forcing the Beast into a position
[1:37:15] where it cannot move so the farmer can
[1:37:18] administer medication you've come here
[1:37:20] to church today and the great farmer God
[1:37:22] is here to Minister some medication but
[1:37:25] the devil has you in such a tight place
[1:37:27] come
[1:37:30] on it's time to receive the word of God
[1:37:32] to hold
[1:37:34] completely the devil's purpose his
[1:37:36] ambition his goal his directive is to
[1:37:39] hold you completely in that
[1:37:42] condition it's time to Dethrone the king
[1:37:45] that word torments means a touchstone it
[1:37:48] it means the Rack or instrument of
[1:37:51] torture by which one is fored to divulge
[1:37:54] the
[1:37:56] truth the devil will get you in that
[1:37:58] condition who's are you who's are you oh
[1:38:01] I'm Yours devil I'm Yours

[1:38:05] this I'm yours I'll go I'll do
[1:38:07] that
[1:38:09] www.h.com
[1:38:11] and you go it right on up in

[1:38:19] was at my mama's house back in Virginia

[1:38:23] lovely wonderful Pastor talk about www.

[1:38:57] hell. it's
[1:38:59] okay and then just as it as it went dark
[1:39:02] it slowly faded back up just a little
[1:39:05] faint light and you know
[1:39:08] what that site was asking me to put my
[1:39:12] name in to go on a waiting list there
[1:39:14] was so many people wanting to get into
[1:39:18] hell that had to go on a waiting I
[1:39:20] didn't go on a waiting list but I
[1:39:22] thought who who in their right mind
[1:39:24] would sign their
[1:39:26] name and want to go to
[1:39:30] hell but you're sitting here today
[1:39:33] that's good trapped in a condition that
[1:39:36] you think that you cannot be delivered
[1:39:41] from get off the list
[1:39:44] brother get off the list sis I make a
[1:39:47] good song won't it get off the list sis

[1:39:56] about the time they say that that you
[1:39:58] hold people's attention say amen amen
[1:40:02] okay y'all still awake
[1:40:04] good see they only sang One song so you
[1:40:07] know I got a little bit more time but an
[1:40:10] obstructed
[1:40:12] View and the serpent Lucifer son of the
[1:40:16] morning he's got all kinds of names he
[1:40:19] saw what God was doing and said within
[1:40:21] his heart within his heart remember the
[1:40:23] script scripture a reading he said
[1:40:24] within his heart I want
[1:40:27] that that's what I
[1:40:29] want
[1:40:32] H I want a heaven I want an Eden I want
[1:40:36] a wife I want an
[1:40:39] eve he was
[1:40:43] pouting I want that God won't let me
[1:40:47] have
[1:40:48] it so as I asked the question earlier
[1:40:51] what has the devil suffered he thinks
[1:40:52] his pouting is suffering nah pouting
[1:40:56] can't equate to
[1:40:58] suffering you know how kids are they a
[1:41:00] little pout and think they just going
[1:41:02] through the worst thing ever they just
[1:41:03] want what they're want they're wanting
[1:41:05] you to give into it that's what the
[1:41:07] devil is wanting you to do he's just
[1:41:09] like an old pouting snotty nose full
[1:41:12] diapered
[1:41:15] kid diaper full of
[1:41:19] mess
[1:41:21] huh he ain't about nothing
[1:41:24] he's wanting to take away your
[1:41:26] experience he's wanting ultimately your
[1:41:28] very life yes pounding can never be
[1:41:31] equated as suffering Ahab he began to
[1:41:33] pout because naboth would not break the
[1:41:36] traditions of God and the laws of God
[1:41:39] and give up his place he was after
[1:41:42] naboth's position he was after naboth's
[1:41:45] possession
[1:41:46] right and Nebo said nope not today devil
[1:41:50] because naboth had a revelation NE knew
[1:41:54] that God said that this is your land
[1:41:57] Nebo amen I'm here to declare to you
[1:42:00] today that this is your
[1:42:04] land my sister and my brother this is
[1:42:06] your
[1:42:08] possession and naboth knew that it was
[1:42:11] his Heritage and he knew that he must
[1:42:14] keep it in order that he could hand it
[1:42:16] down to the successive
[1:42:20] Generations some of you young people
[1:42:21] sitting here today just new parents and
[1:42:23] just little babies swaddling babies You'
[1:42:26] have a Heritage to pass down to that
[1:42:29] child and there baby strains in your
[1:42:32] family that you're going to have to
[1:42:33] fight to defend and protect that
[1:42:38] child amen 2+ 2 is
[1:42:43] four but he KN he had this heritage why
[1:42:46] because Satan was after the to establish
[1:42:50] dominance and position himself as king
[1:42:54] over nebo's nebo's Heritage nebo's
[1:42:57] possession and Satan attacked the mind
[1:43:01] or the intellect of Eve so he brought
[1:43:04] educational Enlightenment if he could
[1:43:06] get to the mind he had Direct access to
[1:43:09] her
[1:43:12] heart get the mind you have access to
[1:43:14] the heart and if he had her heart she
[1:43:17] could easily be swayed by every wind of
[1:43:21] Doctrine huh
[1:43:23] he starts in the mind the words that he
[1:43:25] uses to get to the
[1:43:27] heart because once he was able to do
[1:43:30] that to swear there was no longer to put
[1:43:32] up a fight I feel comfortable
[1:43:36] here feeling comfortable in chat
[1:43:43] rooms sometimes I wish there wasn't
[1:43:44] anything right here I'd preach and hide
[1:43:46] back here where y'all can't see
[1:43:48] me feeling comfortable on
[1:43:51] websites the devil is causing you to
[1:43:55] feel
[1:43:58] comfortable dethroning a king that's all
[1:44:01] I'm saying today that's all I'm trying
[1:44:03] to get your attention to be brought to
[1:44:04] it's time to Dethrone that King
[1:44:10] yeah because the exponential nature of a
[1:44:14] destructive situation is much broader
[1:44:17] than you think you say to yourself well
[1:44:19] it's just me it's it's only just me no
[1:44:21] it's more than that
[1:44:25] hear me Saints it's more than it's time
[1:44:27] to Dethrone the
[1:44:29] king it's time to throw up our hands in
[1:44:32] a sign of surrender the greatest battle
[1:44:34] ever fought well that's the way it is
[1:44:36] Friends Satan tries to be hypocritical
[1:44:39] about it he tries to show you something
[1:44:41] better an easier way a more sensible
[1:44:43] plan but there is no more sensible plan
[1:44:46] than that God laid down at the beginning
[1:44:49] right so why are we listening to what
[1:44:52] the devil says the plan has already been
[1:44:54] laid
[1:44:56] out thank you Lord and you've already
[1:44:58] said amen to the word I heard
[1:45:02] you there's nothing more to rest
[1:45:05] upon the battle raged when Eve opened up
[1:45:08] her mind to listen to her reason her
[1:45:11] reasonings where did she get those
[1:45:12] reasoning from the devil had planted
[1:45:14] these words in her mind he's trying to
[1:45:18] change her identity he's trying to give
[1:45:21] her an understanding of who she is by
[1:45:23] what he is he's trying to give her his
[1:45:27] identity that's the flu it come in
[1:45:29] that's the channel it run down her
[1:45:30] reasoning she in her soul she reasoned
[1:45:33] her eyes with
[1:45:35] sight watch this she saw the serpent he
[1:45:37] was beautiful handsome far better than
[1:45:40] her own
[1:45:41] husband what's she doing looking at what
[1:45:43] what are you doing looking at somebody
[1:45:45] else something else other than the word
[1:45:48] of
[1:45:50] God he said but Joel you just don't know

[1:46:15] he's ever been under demonic spirit

[1:47:28] thrill he injected into her a a word he
[1:47:32] presented a word to her and it came into
[1:47:34] her mind and that's the thing he does to
