[27:23] simple strokes on a page

[29:35] the word is alive
[29:41] [Music]
[29:48] oh yeah
[29:58] aren't you glad that god has given you a
[30:00] part of that
[30:01] living word we so love the written word
[30:04] the bible been able to pick it up and
[30:07] read
[30:08] it have it on our phones ipads tablets
[30:10] whatever more that we have
[30:13] but i find it so sad whenever so many
[30:15] people read those words
[30:18] and get what the reading is not alive
[30:20] inside of them
[30:22] it's not quicken to become a life
[30:25] within itself well i'm so happy to see
[30:28] you all i'd just like to grab every one
[30:30] of you and give you a big old hug
[30:40] praise the lord well maybe we ought to
[30:42] do that first then brother jerry just
[30:45] we certainly appreciate the musicians
[30:47] deacons all the
[30:49] brothers and the sound booths and all
[30:50] that for being here when we have to
[30:51] stream
[30:53] but the truth of it is they can't take
[30:54] y'all's place
[30:57] i'm glad it's that way aren't you that
[30:59] each one of us have our part
[31:02] we're certainly happy to be gathered
[31:03] together again today and
[31:05] lord willing the second group will be
[31:07] here uh wednesday night and then
[31:09] next sunday unless things change
[31:12] everybody will
[31:13] come back together we certainly want to
[31:15] keep
[31:16] keep praying i know that you are but
[31:19] just as a reminder to you
[31:21] about all this covet stuff around the
[31:23] world
[31:24] um i'm here with so many um in africa
[31:27] and india
[31:28] and everywhere every week i'm getting
[31:31] emails and texts and
[31:33] things like that from our brothers and
[31:34] sisters around the world
[31:36] it's affecting many many of the
[31:38] believers as well as everybody else so
[31:41] we certainly want to be praying that god
[31:42] will just intervene for us
[31:44] and help us you know when brother
[31:46] branham was here he
[31:48] prayed and said that he constantly
[31:51] prayed that god would
[31:52] help the doctors to find cures for
[31:55] cancers and
[31:56] things like that and me being a
[31:59] pentecostal that
[32:01] uh didn't believe in going to doctors
[32:03] and believing taking much medicine and
[32:05] all that when i first come to the
[32:06] message when i used to hear things like
[32:08] that
[32:09] it used to ah i had a little bit of a
[32:11] problem with it
[32:12] i'm just going to be honest with some of
[32:14] you of course didn't have no problem
[32:15] with anything y'all just
[32:18] i thank god for his grace but
[32:22] the more i began to realize that
[32:25] it was god's love to humanity
[32:29] to be able to allow them to come up with
[32:32] vaccinations and doctors and scans and
[32:35] this and that and the other
[32:36] because he didn't just love his people
[32:39] he loves
[32:40] the human race no matter what color they
[32:43] are
[32:44] no matter what continent they come from
[32:47] god
[32:47] loves the human race and he loves us all
[32:51] the same as far as
[32:52] racial things are concerned of the
[32:53] continent that we come from
[32:55] so myself it's enlightened me to help me
[32:59] i've been praying i hope you have that
[33:01] god would help our doctors and
[33:03] epidemiologists and all these people
[33:05] to be able to find a treatment a cure
[33:09] whatever more for this covert thing it's
[33:11] been more devastating than
[33:13] in our lifetime anyway than anything
[33:15] that we've ever dealt with
[33:16] so if you've not been praying that way
[33:18] please join with us in prayer
[33:20] that god will help them that they can
[33:22] find something
[33:24] that'll better us all amen
[33:28] i'll tell you one thing you might not
[33:30] appreciate a motrin or an advil
[33:32] or a tylenol do you have a bad headache
[33:37] brother don't it don't tell me you take
[33:39] them i do i got enough common sense to
[33:42] now i call on the name of the lord first
[33:44] that's what i always do first
[33:45] but sometimes i hear an echo and donny
[33:47] you've got something in your cabinet
[33:48] there that'll help you if you'll take it
[33:49] don't be stubborn don't be hard-headed
[33:52] praise the lord that's right and even
[33:55] friends you know i know there's
[33:57] controversy about taking vaccines and
[33:58] all this and another but
[34:00] when brother branham was here before he
[34:02] went to africa you know what he'd done
[34:03] took the yellow fever shot took all
[34:06] kinds of shots
[34:07] why he said because caesar required it
[34:11] so remember whenever we're making our
[34:13] so-called stand for liberty
[34:16] of what a lot of people call patriots
[34:18] let's make sure
[34:19] our patriotism does not compromise on
[34:22] the message of the hour
[34:23] and the word of god god gives us enough
[34:25] sense to do what we can
[34:27] to help ourselves well now i've done
[34:30] ruined the service i guess when miles
[34:32] will go to house
[34:35] amen was that for you or you or here's
[34:39] for somebody because it's your run on my
[34:40] notes
[34:42] amen god bless you we're so happy to be
[34:44] together again today let's
[34:46] let's read if you would in ephesians
[34:47] chapter 4 verse 21
[34:53] amen so appreciate the grace of god to
[34:56] our hearts and lives today i know we
[35:00] don't get to get
[35:00] be together like we were before and i'm
[35:03] so sorry for that but
[35:04] may god help us to get through this time
[35:06] when we can be able to
[35:08] have services we are used to and
[35:11] get together for fellowship and things
[35:13] like that
[35:15] ephesians 4 21 if so be
[35:18] that ye have heard him
[35:21] and have been taught by him
[35:26] as the truth is in jesus
[35:30] if so be that ye have heard him
[35:34] and have been taught by him
[35:37] now the book of ephesians was written
[35:39] many years of course after the lord
[35:41] jesus had visited the earth
[35:43] and yet paul is addressing saints that
[35:46] he said
[35:47] had been taught by jesus
[35:50] and they had heard jesus
[35:54] no doubt there were some that was still
[35:55] alive physically that hurt him
[35:58] but there were many that never hurt him
[36:00] in his corporate body
[36:02] but yet paul is addressing them as if
[36:04] though they had hurt him
[36:07] well i'm going to go ahead and say the
[36:08] same thing to you today
[36:10] i believe we have heard him and i
[36:13] believe we are taught
[36:14] by him now if god calls
[36:18] ministry and they submit themselves to
[36:20] the lord then
[36:21] you believe what you want to believe i
[36:22] believe it's the lord speaking to us
[36:25] then notice what
[36:27] paul tells them after being taught by
[36:30] jesus
[36:31] and hearing from jesus himself
[36:34] this next verse that ye put off
[36:37] concerning the former conversation the
[36:40] old man which is
[36:43] corrupt according to the deceitful
[36:47] lust now this gives us a good view of
[36:50] what we were
[36:51] and what the majority of the human race
[36:54] still is today
[36:55] corrupt rotten no good
[36:58] that's why we needed a new birth and
[37:01] be renewed in the spirit
[37:05] of your mind now notice so we're not
[37:08] just talking about your intelligence or
[37:10] your knowledge
[37:12] but the spirit of your
[37:15] mind now science will never be able to
[37:18] find this
[37:18] as a matter of fact paul we may get to
[37:20] it today that paul
[37:22] deals with two words whenever it comes
[37:24] to
[37:25] issa epignosis and epignosis
[37:29] knowledge which was god-given and one
[37:32] which was
[37:33] scientific we do not know god by science
[37:37] we know him by revelation so it comes by
[37:41] the spirit
[37:42] of our mind just not our intelligence
[37:45] that ye put on the new man
[37:48] which after god is created in
[37:52] righteousness
[37:53] and true holiness
[37:56] listen to this uniting time and sign
[38:01] i've shared with you that i've been
[38:02] going through invisible union
[38:04] and also oneness with god and carol told
[38:07] me
[38:07] this past week that she'd been listening
[38:09] to uniting time and sign
[38:12] and whenever she said that it just
[38:14] struck something in my heart i thought
[38:17] my
[38:17] lord you want me to listen to that so
[38:20] i've been down in the basement
[38:21] been doing some stuff down there so i
[38:23] went down the basement and pulled it up
[38:24] on my phone
[38:25] and i've been listening to it over and
[38:28] over again if you haven't listened to it
[38:29] in a while
[38:30] it would do you good listen to this uh
[38:32] quote in paragraph
[38:34] 40 what a unity when god
[38:38] united himself in a human body
[38:43] the principle the greatest
[38:46] of all the unitings that ever was
[38:49] done was when god united
[38:53] with man he left his great
[38:57] strain of being god and stretch
[39:01] forth his tent and
[39:04] took in humanity
[39:08] and become one of them through
[39:11] unity that what that brought
[39:15] peace between god
[39:18] and man forever how thankful
[39:21] we are uniting time and sign
[39:27] let's pray together heavenly father
[39:30] we love you today lord jesus we thank
[39:32] you so much for your word
[39:34] we are just so happy father that
[39:38] this group anyway could be gathered
[39:40] together today and
[39:42] i can feel their anticipation and their
[39:45] excitement
[39:47] i've been able to be in the house of god
[39:50] lord there's something about us we were
[39:52] made
[39:53] to have fellowship lord i know that this
[39:57] covey thing has affected us in so many
[39:59] ways
[40:01] one of the things that we miss the most
[40:03] is being able to be together
[40:06] i hear brother and i'm talking about his
[40:08] own church and
[40:10] how that the people in the former days
[40:13] he said they would cry they would cry
[40:18] from sunday night to wednesday because
[40:21] they miss
[40:21] one another so bad and they wanted to be
[40:24] together so bad
[40:26] for lord we know that heaven is not just
[40:29] streets of gold and gates of pearl but
[40:33] heaven
[40:34] is those who are of heaven's existence
[40:38] so if we can get by in this life and
[40:42] we really don't care nothing about the
[40:44] saints of god and miss the saints of god
[40:46] and
[40:47] want to be with them then to me there's
[40:49] something missing in our lives
[40:52] the lord we miss one another we love one
[40:54] another
[40:55] we thank you for the streaming but lord
[40:58] i would be the first one to say
[41:00] it's not the same lord god you come here
[41:03] and
[41:04] every service and your anointing was so
[41:06] powerful
[41:07] in the services father we are so
[41:09] thankful for that
[41:10] but you never intended for your
[41:12] anointing to replace
[41:14] your people but you intended for your
[41:17] anointing
[41:19] to be on your people so father we're
[41:22] grateful that we can be back together
[41:24] again
[41:25] we ask that you would help us today we
[41:27] pray that you'll be mindful of all of
[41:28] those that
[41:29] would love to be here today and lord
[41:31] when on wednesday some will come and
[41:33] then
[41:34] hopefully again next sunday we can
[41:35] gather together
[41:37] father be mindful of us would you lord
[41:39] as i read this morning
[41:41] every 21 seconds an american
[41:45] is dying dying with covet
[41:48] every 21 seconds
[41:51] around the world millions of people
[41:54] being affected
[41:55] lord god pastor friends of mine people
[41:59] in different churches around the world
[42:01] dying
[42:02] oh lord god be merciful to us father
[42:06] we paul call upon your great name and
[42:08] ask you to help us lord
[42:10] in this time of distress speak to us
[42:14] today from your word father we ask
[42:16] in the name of jesus and the saints said
[42:21] god bless you you may be seated
[42:29] i know we've been looking at it for
[42:32] a prolonged time but apparently the lord
[42:36] wants to get it over to us he became
[42:41] a man that you and i might have
[42:45] a new man if he had never become
[42:49] in this great union of god and man
[42:54] together
[42:55] i could not stand here today and say in
[42:58] reality
[43:00] that i have been born again
[43:03] job lamented he cried
[43:07] he cursed the day
[43:10] that there was a man-child born he said
[43:14] why
[43:15] did not i die in my mother's womb
[43:20] but truly there will never
[43:23] be a son or daughter of god
[43:27] that's ever had the second birth that'll
[43:30] curse that day
[43:33] there may be things and that you wonder
[43:35] about your first birth and think
[43:37] you know was a life really worth living
[43:40] but if you ever truly
[43:41] get born again you'll never look back on
[43:44] that birth and say
[43:45] was it worth it oh yeah it's worth it
[43:50] my heart today
[43:54] is burdened in the angle
[43:57] of those who feel
[44:00] that they are truly born again
[44:03] for many of the population of the earth
[44:08] that confess and believe
[44:11] they have the new birth no doubt
[44:15] people and our great message maybe even
[44:18] some in our church
[44:20] some that look to our church is the
[44:23] place where they
[44:24] feed and consider themselves a part of
[44:27] our church
[44:28] though they live in denmark or in france
[44:31] or
[44:32] the different places around the world
[44:35] that may feel and think
[44:38] that they too have the new births
[44:42] but in reality their life does not
[44:46] match what the new birth
[44:49] should speak of in an individual
[44:53] it's probably one of the biggest
[44:56] lacks in our move is
[45:00] the new birth to confess that we believe
[45:04] god's sinner prophet that's a wonderful
[45:06] thing
[45:07] we believe the seven thunders the
[45:09] opening of the seven seals
[45:12] marriage and divorce many of these
[45:14] doctrines
[45:15] we love them we we love them we thank
[45:18] god
[45:18] for them but yet we know in reality
[45:22] a confession of that alone is not what
[45:26] liberates us from the sin curse
[45:29] that we were born with we cannot help it
[45:32] we were born
[45:33] lost we were born unregenerate
[45:36] we were born in the natural sense
[45:39] without a hope
[45:41] but we don't have to stay that way
[45:44] because
[45:45] of him coming to the earth the way he
[45:48] did and condensing
[45:50] to such a level to become the great
[45:53] oneness
[45:54] of god and man uniting together
[45:58] he would make a way that he would be the
[46:01] first one
[46:02] of the new race that there would be
[46:06] millions down through seven
[46:09] church ages that would be the ongoing
[46:12] new creation of god for what he started
[46:16] in jesus he is continuing
[46:20] around the world this very day
[46:23] there may be one there may be a thousand
[46:25] there may be ten thousand
[46:27] only he knows how many are left that the
[46:30] lamb's book
[46:32] holds their name and the church will
[46:35] go along play along have meetings
[46:39] and so forth until that last one
[46:42] whose name was spoke by god before the
[46:46] foundation of the world
[46:47] comes into that place of redemption
[46:51] but we know of course and realize that
[46:54] it is the family of god that is coming
[46:57] into view the lord jesus was the
[47:01] first begotten he identified himself
[47:05] with these peculiar terms
[47:09] that god so loved the world that he gave
[47:12] his only begotten so he was the first
[47:15] one
[47:16] to use this term in describing himself
[47:20] he's identified also of course in other
[47:23] places on down below
[47:25] john 3 16 18 and 20
[47:28] he identifies himself as something that
[47:31] was
[47:32] totally new but he uses this
[47:35] human word begotten but he's not the
[47:39] last one
[47:40] to use it and he certainly does not mean
[47:44] to apply
[47:45] imply rather that it would only be
[47:48] applied
[47:49] to him as being just begotten
[47:52] by god unlike us we were not begotten
[47:56] through
[47:57] a virgin through our virgin mother i
[48:00] would say
[48:01] but we are begotten by god
[48:05] and we must also come through a virgin
[48:08] womb
[48:10] but it will not be mary it will not be
[48:13] a mother of this earth but it will be
[48:16] through a predestinated
[48:19] spot of ground that god places
[48:22] in each of us notice james says it this
[48:26] way
[48:26] of his own will beget
[48:30] he us with the word of truth
[48:34] so the lord jesus was the only
[48:38] begotten son of god now when this is
[48:41] being said
[48:42] of course it was exactly right and he's
[48:45] the only one
[48:46] that was begotten in that way but he's
[48:50] not the only begotten
[48:51] today you see god once he
[48:55] was able to make this new creation
[48:59] he's going to make a way from that point
[49:02] on
[49:03] that every other son and daughter of god
[49:06] would be begotten and now this is the
[49:09] key
[49:09] of how they will come james now
[49:13] james was not a free will baptist
[49:17] james believed the sovereignty of god
[49:21] overrode man's choice
[49:24] you see when the apostles wrote the new
[49:27] testament
[49:28] the lord jesus speaking what they they
[49:31] wrote that he had said
[49:33] they wrote it before calvin ever existed
[49:37] they wrote it before the free will
[49:40] baptist
[49:41] they wrote it before armenianism
[49:44] was ever thought of so they were free
[49:49] of free will baptist concept they were
[49:52] free
[49:53] of armenian doctrine so
[49:56] this was something that they believed
[49:58] from the old testament that god
[50:00] had elected but predestination
[50:03] exploded in the new testament election
[50:07] exploded in the new testament
[50:10] sovereignty of god
[50:12] reached its climax in the new testament
[50:15] in the old
[50:16] it was foreshadowed you could see it
[50:18] here and there and there
[50:20] but in the new testament with the
[50:22] opening of the lamb's
[50:24] life and the lamb's blood and the lamb
[50:27] being the very heart of god
[50:30] the lamb being the heart of god opened
[50:32] the secrets
[50:33] from the mind of god so with that coming
[50:37] explosion
[50:39] of god's revealing of his nature
[50:42] and character so james did not
[50:45] feel that he was writing anything wrong
[50:49] when he said that we were born
[50:52] by the will of god can you all say amen
[50:56] to that
[50:57] now if you still struggle with
[50:59] armenianism
[51:00] and you struggle with calvinism versus
[51:04] armenianism and you struggle with free
[51:07] will baptist
[51:08] concept then this scripture might be a
[51:10] little bit difficult for you
[51:12] but if you are free from calvinism
[51:15] and free from armenianism well brother
[51:18] donnie where do you stand
[51:20] i'll follow armenianism as long as it's
[51:23] in the bible
[51:24] i follow calvinism as long as it's in
[51:27] the bible
[51:27] when calvin leaves the word i'll leave
[51:30] calvin
[51:31] when armenians leave the scripture i
[51:34] leave them because the word
[51:37] is my father i said the word
[51:41] is my father you see i was
[51:44] begotten by donald lee
[51:48] reagan through a betting ground
[51:51] of my mother betty jane showed
[51:54] and she became a reagan by marriage
[51:58] my father imparted into my
[52:02] mother the joy of impartation
[52:06] and i was begotten by my father
[52:10] and to my mother as you were naturally
[52:14] my father god also begot me
[52:18] by the joy of impartation
[52:21] of his own will he beget me
[52:25] i did not speak to my father don reagan
[52:28] and said don
[52:29] would you care to father me would you
[52:32] care
[52:33] to give me a mortal existence
[52:36] would you care to re-force
[52:40] me and sow the seed in my mother
[52:44] would you all care could i have a
[52:45] conference with you all
[52:47] and ask you all would you please do this
[52:49] come on friends you know that's absolute
[52:51] nonsense
[52:53] no more could i ask god
[52:56] god will you sovereignly make me
[52:59] your bride he made me his bride before i
[53:02] even knew how to spell sovereign
[53:04] before i knew how to even say it is that
[53:07] right just like he did you
[53:09] so you see the apostles this is why they
[53:12] could so
[53:13] write the new testament with so much
[53:16] of this in it because they were not
[53:19] contaminated
[53:20] by 2 000 years of church age doctrine
[53:24] the way we have been no doubt many of
[53:26] you sitting here today
[53:28] are still affected by either pentecostal
[53:31] or baptist or methodist
[53:33] or church of christ doctrine and when
[53:35] you hear me preach or some other man
[53:37] preach
[53:38] you still pull that through your filter
[53:42] well it's time we get rid of them notice
[53:45] james says of his own will
[53:49] begat he us with
[53:52] the word of truth now look at this word
[53:55] beget
[53:56] it means to bring force to bring
[53:59] forth from the womb give birth to
[54:03] or produce so of his own will
[54:07] beget he us so god
[54:10] the eternal had to sow his seed
[54:14] in a womb in order to begat
[54:18] now if he's going to create he does not
[54:21] need
[54:21] another part but to have
[54:24] begettle it takes two parts
[54:28] as you were begotten from your mother
[54:30] from your father
[54:31] through your mother your father alone
[54:34] could not do it
[54:35] your mother alone could not do it
[54:38] almighty god
[54:39] by himself he could have brought us
[54:41] forth now you'll notice the bible
[54:43] does not say that adam was
[54:46] begotten because he was not adam was
[54:50] given the breath of life
[54:52] and he was brought into existence of
[54:54] course from the original
[54:55] creation of god but he was not begotten
[54:58] through
[54:59] a woman but yet the bible says that this
[55:03] new race
[55:04] begins with a begettal so the lord jesus
[55:08] was begotten he was brought forth the
[55:11] seed of god placed
[55:12] into the womb of a woman that woman
[55:15] carries it
[55:16] until it terminates the time and then he
[55:18] takes the breath of life
[55:20] so what is the womb or where
[55:23] is the womb by which we are begotten
[55:26] in this life think of it of his
[55:30] own will beget he us with the word of
[55:33] truth
[55:34] so we were begotten through some sort
[55:38] of womb where was it well if you listen
[55:41] to spoken words original seed you'll
[55:43] find out
[55:44] that you actually have two wombs in you
[55:47] as a mortal the first is the womb of
[55:50] your mind
[55:50] and then you have that for your spirit
[55:52] conceives of the word
[55:54] brings it right on down to your soul so
[55:57] god
[55:58] divided himself and separated himself
[56:01] adam and eve were one in the beginning
[56:04] the
[56:04] the spiritual being of genesis 1 26 male
[56:08] and female created he them
[56:10] and they were one unit and yet they were
[56:13] male and female so in order to bring
[56:16] them forth
[56:16] in a physical manifestation god's
[56:19] divides them
[56:20] separates the female from the male puts
[56:23] the male in one body female in another
[56:25] body
[56:26] god divides them and then god's plan was
[56:29] bring them back together again in a holy
[56:33] union
[56:34] and let them bring forth his seed
[56:36] children
[56:38] before adam ever did that satan
[56:41] was able to beat him to the woman
[56:45] and also have another union now listen
[56:48] close and you'll find out
[56:49] where the battles of our life always are
[56:53] that satan will try to get us by
[56:56] one sin or another by one speck of
[56:59] unbelief
[57:00] or another to unite with him
[57:03] before god unites with us in his word
[57:06] you see even
[57:07] as we hear the word as we feed on the
[57:10] word
[57:10] the prophet tells us as we feed on the
[57:13] word we become
[57:14] the word now you're born by the word of
[57:17] god and your soul of course
[57:19] but as you feed upon the word you're
[57:21] conforming
[57:22] more and more to the image of the word
[57:25] so
[57:26] here's the way the consequence of that
[57:28] works is that god
[57:29] gives a revelation of his word and god
[57:31] brings something to season
[57:33] and to light then god will anoint his
[57:35] men to preach it
[57:36] and then you will hear it then you are
[57:39] given the opportunity
[57:40] in the womb of your being to take that
[57:43] word
[57:44] and become one with that word and you
[57:46] unite
[57:47] with that word when you do more is added
[57:51] to your spiritual stature
[57:53] that word is then added so faith virtue
[57:56] knowledge
[57:56] temperance and then all of these things
[57:58] are added to you
[58:00] but satan will attack that portion of
[58:03] the word before it will unite in you
[58:06] satan is given it's as if though god
[58:09] allows him
[58:10] an opportunity to attack what you've
[58:13] heard now what's he going to do
[58:14] he's going to try to get you to unite
[58:17] with unbelief
[58:18] or fear oh well it's not for you it
[58:21] won't happen to you you're not good
[58:23] enough whatever it is
[58:24] he will try to get you to unite with his
[58:28] doubt
[58:28] of that promise to keep you from uniting
[58:32] with the promise itself amen so what's
[58:36] the whole thing about
[58:37] it's about union it's about oneness
[58:41] why do we do whenever we slip up and
[58:43] make mistakes
[58:44] and do things that are wrong what
[58:46] happened by the gem that allowed us to
[58:47] do that
[58:48] we united our flesh with a weakness that
[58:52] was already there
[58:53] and satan laid a snare a temptation
[58:56] whatever it was for us
[58:57] and pulled us into a union with that sin
[59:01] that besetting sin or whatever more and
[59:04] he pulls our body
[59:05] into a union with that thing and then we
[59:08] do something wrong
[59:10] and the spirit of god inside of us
[59:12] convicts us and we say god please
[59:14] forgive me i'm so sorry
[59:15] don't you know that the lord if you we
[59:17] would have allowed him
[59:19] would have let us be become one was his
[59:22] promise
[59:23] containing pertaining to that situation
[59:26] and he would have given you release to
[59:28] you the power from within you
[59:30] to help you to overcome that if you
[59:33] would have led him
[59:34] but instead of allowing him to do that
[59:36] many times we feed the flesh
[59:39] and we become one with whatever it is
[59:41] that satans want us to unite against the
[59:44] word
[59:44] and will feed the flesh and it gets
[59:46] stronger and stronger and stronger
[59:49] what's it doing
[59:50] as we are feeding on whatever that is
[59:53] our flesh
[59:54] the unregenerate part of us is becoming
[59:56] one
[59:57] and becoming one in that conception
[1:00:00] and then the progeny of that will be
[1:00:03] what
[1:00:04] you messing up praise the lord
[1:00:08] and whenever we mess up then the soul in
[1:00:10] us
[1:00:11] demands that we repent and make right
[1:00:14] but the soul within us
[1:00:16] would have already empowered us to
[1:00:19] overcome that
[1:00:20] if we would have fed with just as much
[1:00:23] faithfulness
[1:00:24] on that which is true that which is
[1:00:26] right that which is
[1:00:28] sacred that which is holy come on
[1:00:30] children
[1:00:31] but if we allow the devil he will play
[1:00:34] on our human weaknesses and how he still
[1:00:36] has them
[1:00:38] how many still has human weakness and
[1:00:40] shortcomings shall we do
[1:00:42] then satan will try to make our weakness
[1:00:45] one with whatever it is out here that he
[1:00:48] has
[1:00:49] some sort of temptation and this is
[1:00:51] where that we must learn ourselves not
[1:00:53] only our enemy
[1:00:54] but learn ourselves and be able to
[1:00:57] fortify
[1:00:58] those things about us that our
[1:01:00] weaknesses and the spirit of god will
[1:01:02] help us
[1:01:02] if we will allow him so there is a womb
[1:01:06] and then in the mind here's where we
[1:01:08] receive the word
[1:01:10] so here today those of you that are here
[1:01:11] those of you that are streaming
[1:01:13] i'm preaching to you and i'm speaking to
[1:01:15] you the truth
[1:01:16] you are taking that into the womb of
[1:01:19] your mind
[1:01:20] now because you have two wombs a child
[1:01:23] will not be born from your mind alone
[1:01:26] you see when the serpent came to eve
[1:01:28] anointed by the devil he started on the
[1:01:31] womb of her mind first
[1:01:33] he wants to be able to bring a union
[1:01:36] with her body he studied the creation of
[1:01:38] god and he sees she's the only one
[1:01:41] made out of the broken continuity of god
[1:01:44] and he sees that she came
[1:01:46] out of man but she's inferior to men
[1:01:49] he sees that her body came from man but
[1:01:52] she was made out of broken continuity
[1:01:55] so he sees right there where he will be
[1:01:58] able to sow his seed
[1:02:00] into the human race now the serpent of
[1:02:02] course was almost like a man stood
[1:02:04] upright talk think reason
[1:02:06] and he had a place for a soul but he
[1:02:08] didn't have a soul
[1:02:09] but it just so happened that satan did
[1:02:12] have a soul so satan incarnated himself
[1:02:16] stepped inside this animal this animal
[1:02:19] considered for him to do it
[1:02:21] remember god could not have judged this
[1:02:23] animal had it been like a dog or a cow
[1:02:26] or a horse that had no choice but this
[1:02:29] serpent
[1:02:29] allowed the devil to step inside of him
[1:02:32] and then what he does he surrenders his
[1:02:35] body
[1:02:36] to this person of satan praise the lord
[1:02:39] by doing that he allows his
[1:02:42] instrumentality
[1:02:43] to become what the instrument by which
[1:02:46] satan would use so satan
[1:02:48] wants to begot himself into the womb of
[1:02:52] the woman
[1:02:53] but he needs an instrument satan is not
[1:02:56] flesh and blood the way you and i are
[1:02:58] today
[1:02:58] but he is an angel a spirit and he must
[1:03:02] have something that will be able to mix
[1:03:04] together he studied the serpent he
[1:03:06] looked at
[1:03:06] apes no doubt he looked at gorillas he
[1:03:09] looked at horses he looked at all the
[1:03:10] creation
[1:03:11] and he saw this one which is right next
[1:03:14] to man the very next level
[1:03:16] right below man then he was able somehow
[1:03:19] by the laboratory looking into it
[1:03:21] whatever that he done
[1:03:22] understanding how that god had made it
[1:03:24] he was able to perceive into that
[1:03:27] this one would mix with the blood
[1:03:30] by doing that he impersonates himself
[1:03:33] incarnate steps inside of it in a work
[1:03:35] of incarnation
[1:03:36] and he takes over the serpent's body by
[1:03:39] him yielding to that
[1:03:40] and whenever he does this then he starts
[1:03:43] anointing
[1:03:44] his words now he's going to talk to her
[1:03:46] he's going to confuse her on the promise
[1:03:48] of god
[1:03:49] it would have done her no damage
[1:03:51] whatsoever as long as those words and
[1:03:54] those thoughts
[1:03:55] would have kept out of her mind even
[1:03:57] when they come into her mind
[1:04:00] she still had the power of control from
[1:04:03] her soul
[1:04:04] but when she took from womb one
[1:04:07] and allowed that seed to come down into
[1:04:10] the womb of her soul
[1:04:12] then she become captured that he
[1:04:15] changed the very personality of god
[1:04:18] and she accepted what satan said about
[1:04:21] god
[1:04:21] instead of what god said about god
[1:04:23] himself
[1:04:25] now notice then from the womb of her
[1:04:27] mind still
[1:04:28] nothing has happened yet nothing has
[1:04:30] transpired but the scripture said
[1:04:32] that she looked upon the tree that it
[1:04:35] was one that would make one wise and it
[1:04:37] was a tree
[1:04:39] to be desired now you look at the hebrew
[1:04:41] words and you don't take very much of a
[1:04:43] theologian to understand
[1:04:45] we're not talking about her looking at a
[1:04:46] peach tree and saying i want that tree
[1:04:48] so bad i can't hardly stand it
[1:04:52] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:04:56] so what does he do he then moves he
[1:04:59] moves
[1:05:00] even closer and closer hoping she will
[1:05:03] take the pregnation from her mind
[1:05:05] the womb of her mind and receive it down
[1:05:08] deeper don't you understand friend
[1:05:10] the furthest journey that the word has
[1:05:12] to make in you and i
[1:05:14] is from here down to here many of us
[1:05:16] have been storing it right up here for
[1:05:18] 40 years
[1:05:19] but i wonder how much of it has moved
[1:05:21] from up here down into the soul
[1:05:23] it will not give you power to overcome
[1:05:26] and live above sin in this life as long
[1:05:29] as it's in your head
[1:05:30] but when it moves from your head to your
[1:05:33] soul
[1:05:33] then you have a progeny between you
[1:05:37] and god you are not reproducing god
[1:05:41] when the word comes from the word of god
[1:05:44] from the man of god's lips
[1:05:46] and only into your head you are not
[1:05:49] producing a
[1:05:50] child you are not producing an offspring
[1:05:53] or
[1:05:53] a burst but when the word is able to get
[1:05:56] down
[1:05:57] into your soul and it builds word on top
[1:06:00] of word
[1:06:01] on top of word what is it it's christ
[1:06:03] jesus
[1:06:04] being formed inside of us
[1:06:07] so it is the son of god being burst
[1:06:10] again
[1:06:11] oh now i hope you hear me this morning
[1:06:13] so notice whenever this happens and
[1:06:16] satan
[1:06:17] is able to use the serpent his desire is
[1:06:20] to
[1:06:20] beget a son to beget one that would
[1:06:24] bring
[1:06:24] forth and he would be able to
[1:06:25] contaminate the entire
[1:06:27] human race he don't even go to adam he
[1:06:29] knows better he does not even attack him
[1:06:32] at all
[1:06:32] but he goes to the byproduct and from
[1:06:34] there he's able to sow the seed in the
[1:06:36] womb of her mind
[1:06:38] and then the prophet said that she could
[1:06:40] not be able to do this
[1:06:42] until she received the lie of the devil
[1:06:44] he said let me go ahead and say in
[1:06:45] oneness with god
[1:06:46] let me go ahead and say it he said that
[1:06:48] no man no woman
[1:06:50] can believe a lie of the devil
[1:06:53] until first you reject the truth
[1:06:56] of god so she refused the truth of god
[1:07:00] then when she pulled this into her mind
[1:07:04] then it stepped inside of her mind but
[1:07:06] remember
[1:07:07] by being in her mind it would not
[1:07:09] produce
[1:07:10] a cane it must move from the womb of her
[1:07:13] mind
[1:07:14] down inside her body and then whenever
[1:07:17] she accepts his lie of the devil
[1:07:19] in her mind and then she begins to say
[1:07:22] what satan says
[1:07:24] so satan's confession becomes her
[1:07:28] confession that's why when you say i'm
[1:07:31] not a very good christian i ain't got
[1:07:32] much faith on this and the other you're
[1:07:34] talking the devil's language
[1:07:39] come on saints that's right he can only
[1:07:42] act in heaven upon our confession
[1:07:45] when our confession matches what he says
[1:07:49] and if you're a child of god you'll
[1:07:50] never hear jesus saying you're a
[1:07:52] serpenty
[1:07:53] and if you're one of his you'll never
[1:07:55] hear jesus say it
[1:07:56] i've send away my day of grace and as
[1:07:58] long as you're saying that you're not
[1:08:00] saying what he says
[1:08:01] but if you'll say what he says then he
[1:08:04] can act
[1:08:04] on your confession the same with satan
[1:08:07] satan could not
[1:08:08] act until of course she had received
[1:08:10] these thoughts
[1:08:11] into the womb of her mind she pulls it
[1:08:14] down inside of her soul
[1:08:15] and of course we know the rest of the
[1:08:17] story then
[1:08:19] cain was begotten in the womb of
[1:08:23] eve by vicariously satan vicariously
[1:08:27] fathering a child so in one sense he had
[1:08:30] two fathers
[1:08:31] and that he had a father of his body
[1:08:33] satan still could not father a child
[1:08:36] by his own spirit being he couldn't do
[1:08:38] it he could not father child but he
[1:08:40] could get inside this being
[1:08:42] and be able to be the father of cain's
[1:08:44] nature
[1:08:45] so here he had two fathers in the sense
[1:08:48] that the devil was the father of his
[1:08:50] nature hope y'all listen to me because i
[1:08:52] ain't just talking about cain this
[1:08:54] morning
[1:08:55] guess what i just read your pedigree
[1:08:58] now your daddy would have been the
[1:09:00] father of your natural body is that
[1:09:02] right
[1:09:03] but some of you know as well as i do how
[1:09:05] come
[1:09:06] that some of us have kids and grandkids
[1:09:08] and then
[1:09:09] we love the lord and we worship god and
[1:09:11] we go to church and some of our families
[1:09:13] means the devil himself
[1:09:15] you know why because you did not give
[1:09:17] them your good nature
[1:09:19] you could not give them no sir you could
[1:09:22] not get it but
[1:09:23] actually the prophet of well i don't
[1:09:25] like that brother donny i can't really
[1:09:26] help that
[1:09:27] the prophet said i don't care who they
[1:09:29] are whether it's a priest
[1:09:30] a pope or a bishop everyone that's born
[1:09:33] is
[1:09:34] born between satan and eve this
[1:09:37] is what we were born with a fallen
[1:09:40] satanic
[1:09:41] nature and if you don't get saved that
[1:09:43] devil nature of yours will take you to
[1:09:45] hell
[1:09:46] that's just the plain facts now how then
[1:09:49] is god going to reverse this
[1:09:51] through the power of the ghetto now
[1:09:54] satan does not have to find
[1:09:56] a woman then in every generation and
[1:09:58] beget a new generation
[1:10:00] now until genesis 6 we know that there
[1:10:03] were two separate seed lines that were
[1:10:06] on the earth
[1:10:06] and even though adam had failed i hope
[1:10:09] this don't
[1:10:09] don't baffle you but even though adam
[1:10:12] fell
[1:10:13] he was not like what we are now
[1:10:16] remember when brother branham preaches
[1:10:18] the oneness of god
[1:10:19] and he takes the two sea lions and he
[1:10:21] goes down through there
[1:10:22] and he describes cain how evil how
[1:10:25] wicked that he was
[1:10:27] he said how could that have ever come
[1:10:30] from the holy seed
[1:10:31] of adam so for the first how many ever
[1:10:34] hundreds of years
[1:10:35] that it was after the fall there was
[1:10:38] still
[1:10:39] a kindness there was a generosity
[1:10:42] there was a god-based people that were
[1:10:45] on the earth
[1:10:46] and even though adam had fallen sin had
[1:10:49] not become
[1:10:50] as we know it today so satan was still
[1:10:54] not
[1:10:54] happy being what it was so he what does
[1:10:57] he do
[1:10:58] he fathers a separate line but then the
[1:11:00] sons of says
[1:11:01] they stayed up on the mountain they
[1:11:04] stayed up on the mountain that's where
[1:11:06] they lived
[1:11:07] they was up on the mountain and they
[1:11:09] lived above these
[1:11:10] valleys of sin where the canaanites
[1:11:14] went to and they they stayed separate
[1:11:17] away from them
[1:11:18] so the sons of god which are the sons of
[1:11:20] seth
[1:11:21] saw the daughters of men or the
[1:11:23] daughters of king
[1:11:24] cain was not happy with them because it
[1:11:27] was two separate races
[1:11:29] on the earth so here was the godline and
[1:11:31] they were up on the hill
[1:11:33] they worshiped god they called on the
[1:11:35] name of the lord and they worshipped god
[1:11:37] and they had sacrifices and so on
[1:11:39] and then they will share this other
[1:11:41] people and they live down at the bottom
[1:11:43] of this mountain of god and they lived
[1:11:45] on down through the valleys and they had
[1:11:47] horrible horrible sin
[1:11:48] they lived ungodly of terrible types of
[1:11:50] lies so
[1:11:51] satan wanted to bring these two groups
[1:11:55] together and form an ecumenical move
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:00] praise the lord he wanted to form an
[1:12:03] ecumenical move
[1:12:05] that would bring them together so he
[1:12:08] calls them
[1:12:08] sons of god to go to seeing them
[1:12:11] daughters
[1:12:12] of men now they were fair to look upon
[1:12:14] and they took
[1:12:15] unto them women women not just wives but
[1:12:19] women so they were
[1:12:21] living together and then out of this
[1:12:24] product the progeny of these this union
[1:12:27] was what
[1:12:28] giants giants mighty men and the earth
[1:12:31] and the word giant there is gabor gabor
[1:12:34] is one of the what's amazing about this
[1:12:37] is that
[1:12:38] gabor g-i-b-b-o-r is one of the names
[1:12:42] of god one of the names of god
[1:12:46] he is el gabor which means
[1:12:49] the mighty one so out of this union
[1:12:53] between
[1:12:53] sons of god and daughters of men here
[1:12:56] come
[1:12:56] amateur gabors
[1:13:00] so they were mighty men now they were
[1:13:02] not only large
[1:13:04] in stature and all of that and i read
[1:13:06] just just last week
[1:13:08] where they have found some remains and
[1:13:11] and in in iraq and so on archaeologists
[1:13:15] have found
[1:13:16] of what a race of people of giants
[1:13:20] that they never knew existed before
[1:13:23] i saw y'all y'all just six thousand
[1:13:25] years behind
[1:13:27] y'all need any more info give me a call
[1:13:31] thing like that just make fun of us all
[1:13:32] they want to one day they're going to
[1:13:33] find out this word
[1:13:35] is exactly right so they found all these
[1:13:38] leg bones and these femurs and all this
[1:13:41] stuff that was
[1:13:42] turned into stone and you know they're
[1:13:44] saying my here's a
[1:13:45] here's these gigantic people that were
[1:13:47] there and they found them in the land of
[1:13:50] where
[1:13:50] you know where we would know would be
[1:13:52] the original part of the land of
[1:13:53] creation
[1:13:54] and yet whenever these started happening
[1:13:57] satan must bring them together again in
[1:14:00] a
[1:14:01] false union so he wants to take the seed
[1:14:04] of god
[1:14:05] and to mix it with the seed of man then
[1:14:07] what did they produce
[1:14:08] they produced a super race
[1:14:12] now they still now called on the name of
[1:14:14] the lord
[1:14:15] and they wanted oh yes we still go to
[1:14:17] church and we believe god
[1:14:18] and this and that and the other but they
[1:14:20] started mixing their seed
[1:14:22] with these denominational daughters
[1:14:27] now let me just tell you a little
[1:14:28] something friends i realize
[1:14:30] that the left through their media the
[1:14:32] left through all of their things they're
[1:14:34] trying to do
[1:14:35] they're trying to control uh
[1:14:37] conservative voices i understand all of
[1:14:39] that
[1:14:40] but i want you to also understand
[1:14:42] something like this
[1:14:43] what will happen is that those
[1:14:46] that are conservative and those that
[1:14:49] want to hold on to conservative points
[1:14:51] many of them under this fear of losing
[1:14:55] their voice
[1:14:56] will come under the shadow of the
[1:14:59] churches
[1:15:00] in the last day and they will join
[1:15:02] together
[1:15:03] right up with rome because whether or
[1:15:05] not you you want to accept it
[1:15:07] the catholic church had way more power
[1:15:09] than we do
[1:15:10] as far as in the natural sense they have
[1:15:12] the cloud they have the voice
[1:15:14] they have all of that can't you see what
[1:15:16] a lot of this stuff is going to do
[1:15:17] can't you see google shut this down and
[1:15:19] so and so shut this down
[1:15:21] eventually they may shut us down from
[1:15:23] streaming and if they do so be it then
[1:15:25] we'll do something else
[1:15:27] but a lot of the conservative people are
[1:15:29] so scared and they're so afraid
[1:15:31] that they're going to lose their rights
[1:15:33] don't you understand open your eyes
[1:15:35] don't be blind to what satan is going to
[1:15:38] do
[1:15:38] they've got to come together and run
[1:15:41] back
[1:15:41] to mama and mama has more power than the
[1:15:45] message people do
[1:15:46] obama has more power than a little free
[1:15:48] will baptist church over here
[1:15:50] and a little men in our church over
[1:15:52] there so if they can
[1:15:53] all come together and all stand together
[1:15:57] to protect
[1:15:58] our conservative rights oh brother
[1:16:00] donald you believe we ought to stand for
[1:16:02] our rights
[1:16:02] i do but i found out the greatest place
[1:16:04] i can stand
[1:16:06] is not standing before the white house
[1:16:07] with a banner in my hand marching around
[1:16:10] but my greatest place to stand is right
[1:16:12] here on my knees
[1:16:14] now sure stand for your rights this and
[1:16:16] that and the other but friends don't get
[1:16:18] all caught up in all this political
[1:16:20] nonsense and make a fool out of yourself
[1:16:22] on facebook
[1:16:23] do what you're called to do pray do what
[1:16:26] you're called to do sure express your
[1:16:28] view
[1:16:28] your opinion and so on but the best
[1:16:31] thing that you and i can do
[1:16:33] is to be able to pray now remember i
[1:16:34] look to show to tell you wednesday night
[1:16:36] that an angel of god cannot absolutely
[1:16:39] not accept that slander
[1:16:41] in the presence of god of a fallen angel
[1:16:43] but what's amazing is an
[1:16:44] angel of god can stand on that cannot
[1:16:46] stand there against the demon and say
[1:16:49] i rebuke you but he must say the lord
[1:16:52] rebuke you
[1:16:53] but look at the difference in a son a
[1:16:56] person can walk up here today with
[1:16:57] cancer
[1:16:58] a person could walk up here today with
[1:17:00] some type of evil that's holding their
[1:17:02] life but a god-called man
[1:17:04] a son of god filled with the holy ghost
[1:17:06] can stand right here and say
[1:17:08] satan in the name of jesus i command you
[1:17:11] leave this child
[1:17:13] i command you why because the son of god
[1:17:16] on the
[1:17:16] earth has more authority than an angel
[1:17:20] of god can you
[1:17:20] wrap your mind around such a thing that
[1:17:23] a son of god that was born lost
[1:17:26] i tried i was born lost but i lost no
[1:17:29] more
[1:17:30] i was born and regenerate but i'm not
[1:17:32] that no more
[1:17:34] as a son of god i stand here in
[1:17:37] christ's dead on the earth when the
[1:17:39] prophet of god said every god called man
[1:17:42] that's called to preach the word stands
[1:17:44] in the very
[1:17:45] place of the lord jesus
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:56] oh
[1:18:02] of his own will begat
[1:18:06] he us so he has his part
[1:18:12] and there must be another part
[1:18:15] a womb where is
[1:18:19] the womb that receives
[1:18:23] the divine nature of god
[1:18:26] don't you see why there's something in
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:30] allocated by god himself
[1:18:34] of his own will be guiding us with
[1:18:37] the word of truth you see the fact
[1:18:41] is that we are begotten to be his
[1:18:43] children
[1:18:45] it can be traced back solely and
[1:18:48] originally to the eternal himself
[1:18:53] not me not you not your parents
[1:18:56] not brother branham not paul it goes
[1:18:58] beyond paul
[1:19:00] it goes beyond peter it goes to the
[1:19:02] divine will of god
[1:19:03] he purposed it and it was done
[1:19:06] he thought it he spoke it he actually
[1:19:10] spoke
[1:19:10] your name before the foundation
[1:19:14] of the world now can the devil make a
[1:19:16] mess out of you i guarantee you can
[1:19:19] can he tear us all to pieces yep that's
[1:19:21] only in time
[1:19:23] that's only in time notice this in
[1:19:26] ephesians 1 13 now paul
[1:19:28] james rather here says that we are
[1:19:30] begotten with
[1:19:32] the word of truth you see truth
[1:19:35] is such a great thing to god it is god's
[1:19:38] nature it's the very epitome of god's
[1:19:40] character it's true god cannot identify
[1:19:42] himself with a lie
[1:19:43] or a liar so truth is god
[1:19:46] see and luke jesus said give us the
[1:19:49] parable of the sower one forth to sow
[1:19:51] his seed
[1:19:52] and he says that the seed is the word
[1:19:56] so there must be a womb a place by which
[1:19:59] the spoken word
[1:20:00] can land there must be a counterpart on
[1:20:03] the earth
[1:20:04] that can receive god's part there must
[1:20:07] be
[1:20:08] recipients on the earth that can receive
[1:20:10] it
[1:20:11] in order for god to change them notice
[1:20:14] then james says
[1:20:15] with the word of truth what's paul in
[1:20:17] ephesians 1 13
[1:20:19] and whom he also trusted after that
[1:20:22] ye heard the word of truth
[1:20:25] the gospel of your salvation so the
[1:20:29] gospel is not
[1:20:30] just a theory the gospel is not just
[1:20:33] a doctrine but the gospel is the saving
[1:20:36] strength
[1:20:37] of the people of god the gospel of your
[1:20:40] salvation
[1:20:41] in whom also after that ye
[1:20:44] believe now once you hear and you
[1:20:47] embrace it after that you have believed
[1:20:49] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:20:52] promise so now this gives us
[1:20:54] the conclusion of those who have really
[1:20:57] believed
[1:20:57] everyone that truly believes will
[1:21:00] receive the holy ghost
[1:21:02] now there are many that come to the lord
[1:21:04] and say they believe
[1:21:05] but they'll not give up this and give up
[1:21:07] that and give up that
[1:21:08] consequently god does not give them the
[1:21:10] holy ghost
[1:21:11] and therefore they're not identified in
[1:21:13] the bible as being a full-fledged
[1:21:15] believer and whom you also trusted after
[1:21:18] that you heard the word of truth
[1:21:20] the gospel of your salvation and whom
[1:21:22] also
[1:21:23] after that you believe you don't get the
[1:21:25] holy ghost when you believe you get it
[1:21:28] after
[1:21:30] happy valley said in whom
[1:21:33] also after that ye believed
[1:21:36] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:21:39] promise
[1:21:40] now what does the holy spirit do it
[1:21:42] seals
[1:21:43] your womb from any further
[1:21:46] pregnation of the devil your soul
[1:21:50] is sealed now remember you're a human
[1:21:52] and you can still make mistakes and all
[1:21:54] of that
[1:21:54] that has nothing to do with your soul
[1:21:57] your soul
[1:21:58] is sealed by the instrumentality of
[1:22:02] truth
[1:22:02] by the instrumentality of the serpent
[1:22:06] satan was able to impregnate eve by the
[1:22:09] instrumentality now notice
[1:22:11] god does not use science to beget us to
[1:22:14] himself
[1:22:15] god does not use emotion to be get us to
[1:22:19] himself
[1:22:20] god does not use microscopes and
[1:22:22] laboratories and
[1:22:24] this great oratory and all of that god
[1:22:26] uses one thing
[1:22:28] and one thing only and that is truth
[1:22:32] praise the lord though you we're living
[1:22:34] in an age of course and people think
[1:22:35] well all you need to know is the gospel
[1:22:37] well what is the gospel
[1:22:38] what is the good news the good news
[1:22:39] about what the good news that there's
[1:22:42] three gods
[1:22:44] that is not good news that's from narcia
[1:22:48] that news is from hell that news is not
[1:22:51] from heaven
[1:22:52] well the good news is i can get saved
[1:22:54] and do whatever i want to do that is not
[1:22:56] good news either
[1:22:57] that is damnable heresies
[1:23:00] well the good news is i shook the
[1:23:02] preacher's hand you might as well shake
[1:23:04] a donkey's tail
[1:23:05] you might as well write your name on a
[1:23:06] barn door didn't do you a bit more good
[1:23:08] come on chains don't sit there and look
[1:23:10] at me
[1:23:10] you might as well call fido your pet or
[1:23:12] your cat and rub them and do some type
[1:23:14] of magic spell that's not the way
[1:23:16] we're born again of his own will
[1:23:20] be guiding us with the word of truth so
[1:23:23] if we need truth
[1:23:25] to be begotten oh hallelujah and god
[1:23:28] that little portions of truth
[1:23:30] start falling our way some of y'all
[1:23:32] started out as a baptist or a methodist
[1:23:34] or maybe even a church of christ
[1:23:35] that's truly a miracle if you come out
[1:23:36] of that or maybe you started out as a
[1:23:38] pentecostal whatever more
[1:23:40] but god giving you a little more truth
[1:23:42] be getting you calling you
[1:23:44] falling upon it until it can get you to
[1:23:46] a spot
[1:23:47] now listen friend how in the world do
[1:23:48] you think that your own nature could die
[1:23:51] out under a baptist teaching how in the
[1:23:53] world do you think your old nature could
[1:23:55] ever die
[1:23:56] out under methodism or under pentecost
[1:23:58] that's why it takes the word
[1:24:00] of the hour to be begone but if you
[1:24:03] listen to this tape here
[1:24:04] uniting time and sign and brother brown
[1:24:06] tells him in 1963 after the seals
[1:24:08] christian mystery
[1:24:09] and he tells the brand of tabernacle he
[1:24:11] said there's one more thing we've got to
[1:24:13] do
[1:24:14] there's one more step that we must take
[1:24:17] and you must have it
[1:24:22] you know what he's talking about the
[1:24:24] token
[1:24:26] he hasn't preached the token yet
[1:24:30] now you imagine him looking at his
[1:24:32] church
[1:24:33] and telling them they've heard the seals
[1:24:35] they've heard the church ages
[1:24:37] they've heard all of these things and
[1:24:38] he's saying there's one more step
[1:24:41] there's one more place we've got to move
[1:24:44] up into look friend it's not enough and
[1:24:46] remember many brothers
[1:24:47] people sitting there were pentecostal in
[1:24:49] their background
[1:24:50] and many of them well i hope this don't
[1:24:52] make you mad if it does it does
[1:24:53] many of them no doubt are still relying
[1:24:56] on their pentecostal
[1:24:58] experience of just a baptism in their
[1:25:00] spirit and they shouted
[1:25:02] and danced and prophesied but they had
[1:25:04] never allowed that true baptism of the
[1:25:06] holy ghost to move from the spirit
[1:25:09] over into the soul and seal the soul
[1:25:12] it's evident many of those people that
[1:25:14] were sitting there when all these
[1:25:16] false leaders raised up after brother
[1:25:18] branham left what did they do
[1:25:20] some of them went with this man some of
[1:25:22] them went with that man some of them
[1:25:23] went with this man oh this one's joshua
[1:25:26] and this one's caleb and this is not
[1:25:27] another it proves they didn't have the
[1:25:29] holy ghost
[1:25:30] they never took the token message and
[1:25:33] let god move it over you see for a
[1:25:34] baptist
[1:25:35] or a methodist that never hardly
[1:25:36] experienced anything with god
[1:25:38] it might in some ways be easier for them
[1:25:41] but for a pentecostal that's talked in
[1:25:43] tongues or maybe
[1:25:44] you know had supernatural experiences
[1:25:46] and to think
[1:25:47] that is not enough are you saying
[1:25:48] brother donald that's not enough i am
[1:25:50] most emphatically saying that is not
[1:25:53] enough
[1:25:54] we must have that seal of god on our
[1:25:56] soul
[1:25:57] we must let that seal of god bring the
[1:26:00] consummation
[1:26:02] to seal the womb once the womb is sealed
[1:26:04] a person will never
[1:26:06] backslide from that day on you are a
[1:26:09] human sure and you'll
[1:26:10] have to constantly keep that old flesh
[1:26:11] and chat but once that soul is sealed
[1:26:14] it is sealed to the day of your
[1:26:16] redemption brother it is over it's
[1:26:20] finished
[1:26:22] oh my notice this by the instrumentality
[1:26:24] of truth
[1:26:25] you see this was not notice how god is
[1:26:28] going to
[1:26:29] cycle the new birth that it is not going
[1:26:32] to be
[1:26:33] just a creative act alone that you come
[1:26:36] to church one day and god says bam
[1:26:38] bam zap zap zap zap
[1:26:41] no there's a corresponding part in you
[1:26:44] and i
[1:26:45] that must receive the word and they ask
[1:26:48] peter and them on the day of pentecost
[1:26:50] men brother what must we do they said
[1:26:51] repent and be baptized
[1:26:55] so there's something in them that has to
[1:26:57] respond
[1:26:58] it's not a simple creative act as it was
[1:27:00] in the beginning when the earth was
[1:27:02] without form and void and darkness
[1:27:04] covered the face of the deep
[1:27:05] and the spirit of god said let there be
[1:27:08] but there's something in us that
[1:27:10] responds to that word
[1:27:11] don't you see what it is it is you from
[1:27:14] within
[1:27:15] giving god permission to annihilate your
[1:27:17] own nature
[1:27:18] it is you it is not god i'm going to
[1:27:20] save you whether you want to be saved or
[1:27:22] not i'm taking you to heaven where you
[1:27:24] want to go no that's not it at all
[1:27:26] god gives you the ability to say yes to
[1:27:28] the death of your old husband
[1:27:31] and when god gives you the ability to
[1:27:33] say yes
[1:27:34] and you say yes that's your
[1:27:36] corresponding part
[1:27:37] and god creates in you from your soul
[1:27:41] that corresponding part to receive the
[1:27:44] seed and you are regenerated
[1:27:54] you see truth is the agency
[1:27:57] that god will use to secure
[1:28:01] the amount of influence on your soul
[1:28:05] to bring it to a new birth
[1:28:09] listen careful with this quoted question
[1:28:11] answers the only way you can be eternal
[1:28:14] is to receive eternal life
[1:28:15] the greek word thou think is zoe isn't
[1:28:18] that right zoe zoe
[1:28:19] then that life god imparts to you
[1:28:24] as the father your father
[1:28:27] imparts his life to you through the
[1:28:30] marriage
[1:28:31] vow notice now the father imparts
[1:28:36] his life which is going to be you
[1:28:40] to the mother through what the medium
[1:28:44] of a marriage vow now what's the
[1:28:46] difference between
[1:28:48] a child that's born like that and an
[1:28:49] illegitimate child
[1:28:51] because it's not sowed through the
[1:28:53] marriage vow
[1:28:55] you see what the difference between the
[1:28:56] bride and the church
[1:28:58] the bride is married to christ she
[1:29:01] receives
[1:29:02] christ's word through the marriage vow
[1:29:06] and she becomes a bride the church
[1:29:09] receives it through what
[1:29:12] christ is our boyfriend
[1:29:15] now come on friends i know you don't
[1:29:17] want to hear this but it's the truth
[1:29:18] that's why brother branham would call
[1:29:19] this and says
[1:29:20] tell us invisible union that we were
[1:29:22] called to be washed by the water of the
[1:29:24] blood the bloody word
[1:29:25] he said to be cleansed from the filth of
[1:29:28] all these prostitutes
[1:29:29] why because jesus is their boyfriend and
[1:29:32] not their husband
[1:29:34] now boy they really like their boyfriend
[1:29:36] they really do like their boyfriend
[1:29:38] and he's a savior oh yes yes sir he's
[1:29:41] the savior
[1:29:41] but their boyfriend let him dance like
[1:29:43] the world and act like the world and
[1:29:45] dress like the world and get drunk
[1:29:46] and so on and so on and so on but you
[1:29:48] see oh my then they received the word oh
[1:29:51] yes they
[1:29:52] love the cross they love the blood of
[1:29:54] the lord jesus
[1:29:55] and they receive all of that and they
[1:29:57] receive it through what a confession
[1:29:59] that their false preachers tell them
[1:30:01] is a new birth and they receive it into
[1:30:04] a prostitute's heart
[1:30:05] which produces prostitute progeny it
[1:30:08] produces prostitute action i wish
[1:30:11] somebody would preach with me this
[1:30:12] morning
[1:30:13] and had it not been for the grace of god
[1:30:15] happy valley church of jesus christ
[1:30:18] would have been another prostitute
[1:30:21] church
[1:30:22] it is only the grace of god it is only
[1:30:26] the grace of god
[1:30:27] it's not you it's not me it's god's
[1:30:31] mercy to us
[1:30:38] but if god can find a person
[1:30:43] as i preach it to you wednesday night
[1:30:46] and the greek word there
[1:30:47] jesus said except you be born again you
[1:30:49] cannot i do
[1:30:52] see the kingdom of god then when a
[1:30:55] person is joined to the eternal
[1:30:58] in holy wedlock he's constantly sowing
[1:31:02] more of his seed
[1:31:03] in the womb and they're conforming and
[1:31:07] changing and shaping praise god
[1:31:10] it's like the more you eat the more you
[1:31:12] get the more you want the bigger you
[1:31:14] become
[1:31:15] now all of us know how that works with
[1:31:17] food
[1:31:20] hallelujah isn't it amazing that most of
[1:31:23] the stuff that's good for you
[1:31:24] tastes like hay and straw and tree bark
[1:31:29] and most of the stuff that ain't good
[1:31:31] for you donuts
[1:31:33] reese's milk can i go on am i detached
[1:31:36] you know
[1:31:36] good old bread slathered in butter and
[1:31:39] honey
[1:31:40] all kinds of good stuff that tastes so
[1:31:42] wonderful
[1:31:43] most of it ain't no good oh one of the
[1:31:45] sisters of our church was trying to
[1:31:47] explain to
[1:31:48] her little little child a couple of
[1:31:50] years ago and their little child was
[1:31:52] reading down through there and the
[1:31:53] mother was telling about the riboflavin
[1:31:55] and the
[1:31:55] this and that and the other and she said
[1:31:57] you know honey it's got all this and
[1:31:58] that
[1:31:58] and it ain't good for him she said mama
[1:32:00] even though it ain't good
[1:32:02] it sure tastes good well you see that's
[1:32:04] the way we are
[1:32:05] most of this stuff we're gonna find out
[1:32:07] one day a lot of what's about our health
[1:32:09] our
[1:32:09] health problems is because of all the
[1:32:11] stuff we eat and we loving it i don't
[1:32:13] mind telling you i do too
[1:32:15] ask me if i'd rather have a diet drink
[1:32:18] or a regular
[1:32:20] unless it's all right for a car but man
[1:32:22] i'll tell you one thing for a human
[1:32:23] being
[1:32:24] zero sugar you gotta be kidding me zero
[1:32:27] carbs brother doug mccue's out in
[1:32:29] arizona used to say all these people
[1:32:31] with this health food
[1:32:33] you cut out this and you cut out that
[1:32:35] and you live five minutes longer to step
[1:32:36] out in front of a car and get run over
[1:32:43] but there's something about us naturally
[1:32:46] that we want the things many times it's
[1:32:48] not the best for us
[1:32:50] oh but brother sister let me tell you
[1:32:52] this seven course meal that god
[1:32:54] has provided for his bride in the last
[1:32:56] day it ain't not
[1:32:58] like eating a big bale of straw it ain't
[1:33:00] like eating a green leaf and saying this
[1:33:02] good and you're foaming green out of
[1:33:03] your mouth
[1:33:04] it ain't like eating tree bark no
[1:33:06] brother we smack our lips hallelujah
[1:33:09] we love them we lick our fingers this
[1:33:12] word is finger licking good
[1:33:14] i'm telling you what it ain't just good
[1:33:16] for you it's good to eat
[1:33:18] it's good to resist devils it's good to
[1:33:21] resist the power of sin
[1:33:23] and the more you eat the more you want
[1:33:25] and the more you eat of it the more
[1:33:27] like it should become
[1:33:37] so your father imparts his life to you
[1:33:40] through
[1:33:44] the marriage vow with
[1:33:47] mother you mean simply god recognizes
[1:33:51] when a preacher stands up here and say
[1:33:52] you exchange your vows and i'll
[1:33:54] pronounce you man and wife in the name
[1:33:55] of the lord jesus
[1:33:57] a man knows his wife through that vow
[1:34:01] a holy act of god people live together
[1:34:04] all the time that are not married
[1:34:06] bring forth children all the time are
[1:34:08] they alive
[1:34:09] sure are they born sure but they're not
[1:34:12] born through the vow
[1:34:14] you see the bride gives birth through
[1:34:17] the vow
[1:34:19] she was called through the vow
[1:34:24] and you've got a wedding band to prove
[1:34:26] it it was slipped on your finger before
[1:34:29] the foundation of the world
[1:34:31] now watch this is this is really unusual
[1:34:33] the way brother brahman said this only
[1:34:34] place in the message that i've ever
[1:34:35] found that he says it
[1:34:37] the marriage of i was a mother that by
[1:34:40] that
[1:34:41] imparts the joy
[1:34:46] of imparting catch me
[1:34:49] the imparting life for a son
[1:34:55] and that's the way god
[1:34:59] a joy praise
[1:35:03] god can you imagine almighty god
[1:35:07] you know the way we feel joy and
[1:35:10] happiness and being in the presence of
[1:35:11] god
[1:35:12] that god it allows god
[1:35:16] to experience a joy that creating the
[1:35:20] world never brought
[1:35:21] bringing angels into existence never
[1:35:24] brought
[1:35:26] but when god can impart life
[1:35:29] to a son it brings god
[1:35:33] great joy praise the lord
[1:35:40] that's the way god loves does a joy
[1:35:43] in imparting his life
[1:35:48] to a son then you become
[1:35:51] part of him which is only god's own life
[1:35:54] i've given unto them eternal life
[1:35:56] raise them up at the last day how does
[1:35:58] god in part eternal life can you see
[1:36:00] god cannot give people eternal life
[1:36:04] via a church membership
[1:36:07] then god would father illegitimate
[1:36:10] children
[1:36:12] god can only pass eternal life
[1:36:16] through a wedding vow
[1:36:22] did you see why satan would love to take
[1:36:24] your message away from you
[1:36:26] and bring into your minds questions
[1:36:29] about this
[1:36:30] questions about that and questions about
[1:36:32] this and why don't you understand what
[1:36:33] he's trying to do
[1:36:35] question the credibility of your word
[1:36:38] your promised land same thing he done to
[1:36:42] the children of israel numbers chapter
[1:36:43] 13
[1:36:44] oh it's a good land but there's spies
[1:36:45] over there there's giants over there
[1:36:46] don't you understand what he's doing
[1:36:48] questioning the credibility of their
[1:36:49] land then they said oh no oh no
[1:36:52] we can't go we can't go that's exactly
[1:36:54] right they proved they wasn't worthy
[1:36:55] but joshua and caleb said yeah there's
[1:36:57] giant saber we can kill them
[1:36:59] yeah there's gates there but we can take
[1:37:00] them the other cities there but we can
[1:37:02] knock every one of them down by the
[1:37:03] grace of god why
[1:37:04] they received the promised word for a
[1:37:06] vow they were ordained to believe it
[1:37:09] look gentlemen god offers eternal life
[1:37:12] oh it looks like a gift okay okay
[1:37:14] okay i don't believe i believe in three
[1:37:15] gods and i don't believe it matters what
[1:37:17] you believe it don't make a difference
[1:37:18] that's what most christians believe
[1:37:19] today it don't really matter what you
[1:37:21] believe can't you see
[1:37:22] they're ripe for the ecumenical council
[1:37:29] the politics of the left is too big
[1:37:34] for the southern baptist the politics on
[1:37:37] the left
[1:37:38] is too big for the methodists
[1:37:44] so what would they be willing to do well
[1:37:47] let's forfeit this thing about
[1:37:48] sprinkling or baptism our rights are at
[1:37:51] stake here
[1:37:52] let's come together as brothers we all
[1:37:55] believe in god
[1:38:00] well that's not true most of them
[1:38:02] believe in gods
[1:38:08] and they will come together to protect
[1:38:11] their evangelical rights
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:17] they will unite for what
[1:38:21] so communism will destroy them
[1:38:27] listen at it uniting time and sign begin
[1:38:30] about poor at paragraph 40
[1:38:32] read down through 444 then jump from
[1:38:34] there to 63
[1:38:36] down through 67 8 go ahead and read 9-2
[1:38:38] it's a good one
[1:38:40] then jump on over you'll find
[1:38:43] all of these unities must come to pass
[1:38:47] the left must unite against the
[1:38:50] conservatives
[1:38:51] and it will conf it will force the
[1:38:53] non-spiritual
[1:38:55] conservatives to unite against what the
[1:38:58] left
[1:39:02] while they're all uniting and cleaning
[1:39:05] out their guns
[1:39:07] and marching on the capitol yeah we see
[1:39:09] what that produced
[1:39:11] the bride is uniting with christ the
[1:39:14] word
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:16] another union going on around the world
[1:39:19] oh it's so fitting one of the very last
[1:39:20] sermons that he preached
[1:39:22] the invisible union of the bride
[1:39:26] of christ
[1:39:29] notice this peter says first peter 1 3
[1:39:32] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:39:35] lord jesus christ
[1:39:38] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:39:43] has begotten us again
[1:39:47] or anew unto
[1:39:51] a lively hope by the resurrection of
[1:39:55] jesus christ
[1:39:58] from the dead
[1:40:01] so we're not begotten by a doctrine
[1:40:06] but as brother brandon sing and tell us
[1:40:07] a while ago a living word
[1:40:12] a living word you see the real bride
[1:40:15] accepts his entire person
[1:40:18] imagine a girl and a boy going together
[1:40:20] and oh my the boy just buys her candy
[1:40:23] one week and
[1:40:24] tree bark the next week and then vitamin
[1:40:26] c and
[1:40:27] yeah right how many of you girls have
[1:40:30] wanted that
[1:40:31] with dayton so you
[1:40:35] and he gives you an engagement present
[1:40:39] it's vitamin c vitamin d
[1:40:42] vitamin b12 look at my vitamin c
[1:40:46] you won't see all right for carrot cut
[1:40:49] color
[1:40:49] and clarity
[1:40:54] come on saints
[1:40:58] but if you focus on them gifts i said
[1:41:01] what are you getting for me friday
[1:41:03] waiting for me sunday i don't know about
[1:41:04] him but i begin to wonder about you
[1:41:06] i would think if you love me if you love
[1:41:08] my gifts but if you get him
[1:41:10] you get the wallet you get the keys you
[1:41:13] get the title
[1:41:14] you get the whole thing if you get him
[1:41:17] oh i love gifts
[1:41:18] i love faith i love miracles but if i
[1:41:21] got him
[1:41:22] i got the whole package this is why we
[1:41:25] believe in gifts and miracles
[1:41:27] but i'm not just coming to god through a
[1:41:29] gift i was not begotten through a sign
[1:41:31] i was begotten through a resurrected
[1:41:33] person
[1:41:35] jesus christ the living word
[1:41:38] and as i feed upon him he adds more and
[1:41:42] more
[1:41:42] and more to my stature
[1:41:49] let's read this together first peter one
[1:41:52] and four
[1:41:54] this is what we're called to to an
[1:41:57] inheritance
[1:41:58] incorruptible and undefiled
[1:42:02] that fadeth not away reserved
[1:42:06] in heaven for you who
[1:42:09] are kept i love this word
[1:42:13] it is a very simple english word but the
[1:42:16] he
[1:42:16] the greek word is a very profound word
[1:42:19] kept
[1:42:20] keep with the garrison protect
[1:42:24] by a military guard either to prevent
[1:42:28] hostile invasion watching and guarding
[1:42:31] to preserve one for the attainment
[1:42:35] of something angels of god
[1:42:39] are with you day and night all night
[1:42:44] all day angels
[1:42:48] watching over me my lord
[1:42:52] all night all
[1:42:56] day angels watching
[1:43:00] over me i said all night
[1:43:07] all day angels are watching over me
[1:43:12] my lord all night
[1:43:17] all day angels
[1:43:21] watching over me let everybody sing it
[1:43:24] now
[1:43:24] well all night
[1:43:28] all day angels are watching over me
[1:43:33] my lord all night
[1:43:38] all day angels
[1:43:42] watching over me
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:48] who are kept by the power of god through
[1:43:51] faith
[1:43:51] unto salvation ready
[1:43:54] to be revealed in the last time
[1:44:01] my brother sister this is us
[1:44:07] ready to be revealed in the last time
[1:44:10] verse 23 and i'm going to let you go
[1:44:12] being born
[1:44:14] again not of corruptible seed
[1:44:17] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[1:44:22] which liveth and abide us
[1:44:25] forever praise god
[1:44:30] oh my friends i hope today and trust by
[1:44:33] the grace of god
[1:44:35] every one of us are truly
[1:44:39] born again
[1:44:43] i know it's a serious time
[1:44:46] it's a soul-searching time really
[1:44:50] but let's just make sure i i don't want
[1:44:53] to preach
[1:44:54] fear constantly and keep you under that
[1:44:56] fear you can never live
[1:44:58] in the full position of who you are by
[1:45:00] living under the dominance of fear
[1:45:03] but we know that there is a fear which
[1:45:04] is godly fear
[1:45:06] that we check up and we check where we
[1:45:08] are just to make sure
[1:45:10] there is an assurance that comes with
[1:45:13] this token
[1:45:14] that we pass from death unto life but
[1:45:17] just make sure
[1:45:19] that the life you're living is one
[1:45:23] of the other person the lord jesus
[1:45:25] living out of you
[1:45:26] instead of you just simply trying to do
[1:45:29] it and trying to do it
[1:45:30] and trying to do it but the dawn of you
[1:45:32] i need to come in the altar and
[1:45:34] tarry for the holy ghost do i no you do
[1:45:36] not
[1:45:38] you see the only reason that we think a
[1:45:41] delay is necessary
[1:45:43] going into the book of acts and remember
[1:45:46] they went there to the upper room
[1:45:47] because
[1:45:48] they must wait until the feast
[1:45:52] is exactly right the holy ghost could
[1:45:55] not have come one day earlier two days
[1:45:57] earlier
[1:45:58] it must come on the feast
[1:46:01] the appropriate feast they was not sent
[1:46:05] there as a type
[1:46:06] that every believer would have to wait
[1:46:08] and wait and wait and wait
[1:46:11] they were waiting for a certain day to
[1:46:14] fit on the calendar
[1:46:16] because the lord jesus said fulfill that
[1:46:18] of the lamb
[1:46:20] and of the waving of the sheaf and they
[1:46:22] must wait till
[1:46:23] 50 days after that resurrection that's
[1:46:26] the only reason they tarried
[1:46:28] tearing is not something that is
[1:46:30] preached in the new testament
[1:46:32] that we go and tarry and wait and wait
[1:46:35] the only reason
[1:46:36] that we have to wait is to get the
[1:46:39] things out of our life that displease
[1:46:41] him
[1:46:43] and remember in future home the prophet
[1:46:45] lays it out so clearly
[1:46:46] and he said it's not you receiving the
[1:46:49] holy ghost
[1:46:50] it's the holy ghost receiving you
[1:46:56] don't you understand if every person
[1:46:58] could receive the holy ghost at will
[1:47:00] the majority of these christians out
[1:47:01] here would live like the devil
[1:47:03] until the very day before the rapture
[1:47:05] and then that will that receive the holy
[1:47:07] ghost and go right in the rapture with
[1:47:09] everybody else that's not the way it
[1:47:11] works
[1:47:12] he receives you
[1:47:16] remember the story of the prophet
[1:47:17] talking about the when he worked for the
[1:47:19] railroad company and they would go in
[1:47:22] there and pack the car
[1:47:23] and the inspector would come in and he
[1:47:25] would look at the car and look at the
[1:47:27] goods and shake it
[1:47:29] why because once they pulled that door
[1:47:31] down and put that seal on the door
[1:47:33] the railroad company was responsible for
[1:47:36] the safe delivery of those goods
[1:47:38] well if the train down the road the car
[1:47:41] pulled in front of it
[1:47:42] and the engineer had to throw on his
[1:47:43] brakes and lock up the train
[1:47:45] and there was a loose spot a temper or
[1:47:48] some other kind of something loose spot
[1:47:50] and then boxes went flying over that and
[1:47:53] done thousands and thousands of dollars
[1:47:55] worth of damage to those goods
[1:47:57] you know who was responsible the
[1:47:58] railroad company
[1:48:00] so we said the engine the inspector
[1:48:03] would come by
[1:48:04] and he'd inspect it and he would condemn
[1:48:06] the car
[1:48:08] if the car was not roadworthy as we'd
[1:48:10] say
[1:48:12] and make them do what take it all back
[1:48:14] out
[1:48:15] and start over again
[1:48:19] oh if the inspector comes by today and
[1:48:21] looks at your heart
[1:48:25] boy if he condemns me well that means he
[1:48:27] wants you to be right
[1:48:29] don't take it at all there's no hope for
[1:48:31] me no are you condemning no
[1:48:34] it means he wants you to get it right
[1:48:37] you left out this you left out that he
[1:48:38] wants you to be certain
[1:48:40] then let the holy ghost come back oh my
[1:48:43] let the ministry believe it or not the
[1:48:46] ministry are the ones that's packing and
[1:48:48] packing and then you take what they'd
[1:48:50] say
[1:48:50] and apply it to your life and move up
[1:48:52] and they brought in this big box of this
[1:48:54] brother daryl unloaded that and then
[1:48:55] brother donny bros so and so then
[1:48:57] brother joel brown and then this brother
[1:48:59] oh praise god thank you lord
[1:49:00] brother west unloaded a whole big load
[1:49:02] of it lay it in there lord lay it in
[1:49:04] there then the inspector comes
[1:49:06] boy is that thing solid man look at that
[1:49:09] yes sorry reach up here pull that door
[1:49:12] down
[1:49:13] lock it
[1:49:17] put that seal on the door she's sealed
[1:49:20] to the day of her redemption
[1:49:23] there ain't enough devils in hell to
[1:49:25] open that door
[1:49:29] aren't you glad you see this is the
[1:49:31] fulfillment of that verse of scripture
[1:49:33] kept by the power of god well pray for
[1:49:36] me i'm holding on well i feel sorry for
[1:49:37] if you're holding on yourself because

[1:49:42] us don't get you something else well

[1:54:53] wall there it's a bail about so big and
[1:54:55] have a
[1:54:56] thing hanging there maybe some of you
[1:54:57] all saw the picture but whenever erica
[1:55:00] completed her last one a couple of weeks
[1:55:02] ago
[1:55:02] they wanted her to grab a hold of that
[1:55:04] thing on the bell and
[1:55:06] jingle that bell actually the nurses
[1:55:08] made a video of it some of it was able
[1:55:10] to receive the video some of it looked
[1:55:11] like a steel
[1:55:12] picture but she was able to jingle that
[1:55:15] bell
[1:55:17] because she'd completed her prescribed
[1:55:19] last treatment
[1:55:21] wouldn't it be wonderful one day when
[1:55:24] we'll be able to grab that bell and ring
[1:55:25] that bell

[1:55:44] declare
[1:55:45] what i saw when i picked her up

[1:56:39] to eat
[1:56:40] and she would be so sick
[1:56:45] but as i was with her the other day when
[1:56:47] she went to the doctor
