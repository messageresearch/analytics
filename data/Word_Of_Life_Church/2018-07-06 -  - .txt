water that I had never dreamed of but for this water my dear lord has to die he said I'd lose first yet he made balloons he said I thirst yet he made the scene I first said the king of the ages from his great thirst he brought water to me now there's a river it flows as clear as crystal and it comes from God's throne and LA River it was up inside me bringing mercy and life-giving love he said either first yet he made the river he said I thirst yet he made the sea I first said the king of the ages Oh from his great first yes from his great first he brought water to me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] aren't you grateful he was so willing to do such a thing what a privilege we have we've got so much to be thankful for I've just been wondering this week this timeframe called thanks giving how many people have access spinach in thanks giving or if they spend it in aiding and shopping and drinking and all sorts of things as really nothing to do with giving thanks to the Lord I'm glad that God has a people that still know how to give thanks we don't wait one time a year I believe a real Christian has that something about them to give thanks to the Lord Jesus every day that they live don't have to be in church to do it you don't have to be sitting around the pastor it's just something in your heart that you realize he's done so many things for you and if it wasn't for his grace what would be tonight let me give you a little update on I had my procedure done on Monday probably most of you know about it and was able to come home Monday afternoon started passing a bunch of little tiny pieces of what used to be a big rock there's some rather intimidating about a kidney stone when you look in that little strainer and you said about 30 or 40 pieces of grains of sand and you think you are kidding me this thing has done this to me and all these people for six weeks little things can make a big difference amen so I've been doing better think the Lord been feeling better yesterday and today not 100% yet but I'm well on my way and I just want to say I appreciate you praying for me and I thank you for that but the Joker's gonna come and speak for us tonight I was afraid it might be too much for me to take tonight and tomorrow too so Lord willing we'll be taking tomorrow and if I'm feeling up to it I've got a hunt trip planned supposed to leave on Tuesday be going for a few days for the David's I'll be preaching Wednesday but the Dale Smith to be here next weekend Saturday and Sunday so got some really good things lined out for you so it just appreciate him and he comes in out with a need in your life that's important but do you believe you come to the right place to get it man that's just as important as having a need in your life let's open our hearts tonight we believe Jesus is so mindful of every one of us every need that we have the conscience that we have and the unconscious needs that we have he's mindful of our sins of commission he's mindful of our sins of omission he's mindful of our needs that we are aware of he's just as mindful of the needs that we know nothing about tomorrow morning you may be facing the greatest trial of your life next week whenever it could be who knows what will happened to us well we got this confidence he holds my hand he holds your hand I don't know what tomorrow holds but I know who holds tomorrow aren't you

would buy I would be glad to help but I would pray for a quick recovery so he could do it he got one part of the deal I don't I think half of that got left the house y'all know how I am I'm nervous every time I get up here last time I preached here brother in meaning wale come up to me afterwards and said man you could tell you're nervous and I thought brother you need to come tell me one ain't and then then I'll sit down but I really Canada privilege I appreciate brother Donnie having a confidence in me to ask and I love doing God a service but you've got a you got to look at your handling God's property here you're dealing with the love of God's life and I don't want to say anything wrong put anything together that's wrong so y'all pray for me if you will if you will turn your Bibles Genesis 24 we're going to read 2 verse 2 through 4 and Abraham said unto his elder servants of his house elder servant of his house that ruled over all he had put I pray Viva hander to that under my thigh I will make thee swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the god of the earth about should not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites and among whom I dwell but thou shalt go into my country to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you that we could come together Lord once again as your bride war laura's we were singing Lord to walk with your Lord that's not just taking a stroll along or that's becoming one with you Lord that is partaking of what you have for his father lord I pray tonight father that you would help us walk through these scriptures with you Lord Lord you you know when I put things together Lord note make me nervous the more I read them Lord the nervous I get I realize that a lot of putting together I don't know how to put quotes in the right place Father but Lord I'm kind of glad with that Lord it gives me a little edge Lord that I can trust in you that I couldn't lean on you father the Lord I pray to it come and I take these words Lord as we speak through the bride tonight Lord as I speak to myself Lord I have needs father that you would meet with us we welcome you Lord may you move up and down the house or speak to each heart but you have your place here tonight father in jesus name amen you can be seated I'm going to read one quote for you here I'm going to preach tonight on the search for a true bride by Bramson the evening messenger in 63 God has always counted character not members today we do vice-versa we count members good dress well payers instead of character Eliezer sweated out until he found sweated it out until he found character that's right who would he get and he trusted God character for what character for Isaac the bride which the church is the type of that was the natural seed Abraham this is the royal seat of Abraham if Elly's are the messenger hunting the bride and trying to find character if that man has come a messenger of the last day trying to find the Bride of Christ he will not look for a denominational membership he will look for a character that's willing watch a good character first then get her ready to meet Isaac this is this hope hope this is my favorite part after he found the character then he get her stand still long enough to listen to his message of Isaac I hope y'all don't mind me preaching a sermon I've already preached I preached this this past summer at her brother's church and I was telling brother Donnie back there I got to studying recently on this past month I didn't have any plans preaching anywhere but I try to study when I get a chance and I was studying on the life of the seed and held that the life of the seeds manifests itself through the word and in the power that is in that seed and if you look I got the reading seed is not heir to the shut and brother branham's brother branham's talking about when paul refers to Isaac and Ishmael in the Bible is a abraham's two children and he makes the comment that you know Paul saying that there was two sons that Abraham had he still been Abraham had three sons it took me a minute to digest that then I kept reading and he said that third son was Jesus Christ you know and I got to thinking the power that was in the gist in that natural seed the natural seed that that God looked at the Covenant seed of Abraham but God looked down at that see there's so much power someone's life in that seed he skipped all them generations between Isaac and Christ and said this is your third son but the part I looked at is that was the natural strain then Along Came Calvary God took that natural strain and turned it to a spiritual strength and he poured out the blood of the lamb on that seed the power and the life of that see don't even compare to what this spiritual seed has and I say that to say this I'm not preaching on that tonight but that's what I was going to preach on and I had this sermon and I prayed you know it just bared on my heart I had already preached it yes brother Darrell one time I go to eat with brother Darrell sometime I said brother girl is it okay to preach the same sermon somewhere else he said buddy I preached the same sermon to the same church twice before well that ain't too bad it's up at least it's not the same church so but I was praying about it in Monday night I was praying that this was just this sermon was just waiting on my heart just I don't I didn't know why it was weighing so heavy and I said Lord well next time I preach I'll preach it preach it again and brother Donnie takes me the next day so it was meant to be so there's only one problem I can never give it out like I get it so you'll get it and bits and pieces so we're looking at a leisure Abraham sends Ellie's were out on a on a mission to find a bride for Isaac first time I've read the scripture for you for years when he tells you go go get a bride for my son Isaac but do not go out here to the Canaanites go to my own people I want and I thought whoa this is not type of bride the brides of Gentile bride why is he sending it back to his own people and then I found a quote where brother Branham said the reason that was was that Jesus Christ will only accept the bride there's blood-related so she was typing him taking a bride back taking a bride from his own people because she was bred blood-related you've got to receive a blood transfusion before you become a bride and we look at you look at the message today you got people falling apart you got people falling in so many different places and we live in a world - where - the people of this world even people of this message I had somebody just tell me yesterday that the message preacher that leans more towards John 3:16 than anything you know it jump it you every promise that you accept and the Bible has to come through John 3:16 but you can't live on John 3:16 by itself and we got people I was talking to a lady at work one day we was talking about going to church and and she said well jesus loves me that's that's all I need and I knew she was she was she was referring to she was referring to John 3:16 and I don't need to go to church jesus loves me that's all I need I said what about when the Bible says forsake not together assemble yourselves together I mean she didn't even say out she'd say nothing she just shut me off and turned away like I wasn't even there but that's what people their message the bride of people today is John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that is the people the world and the people nowadays their support they're free they're taking that as their message to the bride they're taking that is as this is this is all I need for God so loved the world it gives you got sent on I'm saved um I can go do what I want now well you're right because that's what you want to do and as you as a laser goes to Rebecca's family of course you know the story how he prays their Lord if the right one comes Lord would she is a ask if I need water because she water my camels as well he didn't go there with the John 3:16 message he didn't go there for whoever wants to be Isaac's bride come out but that's what that's what people are leaning on they're leaning on that like they believe that that's what it is and so he goes there with a message basically let God Shore show me who it is I'm not gonna go there preaching to the family so he goes there and you know the story as it comes it's a similar thing today the 20th century when we had a L easier coming this day that was but the Branham was preaching the contest in 1962 and he referred to John 3:16 he said John 3:16 you start training for a fight it will get you on the floor you're on the floor John 3:16 got you in the fight so now what are you gonna fight with you're the Bride of Christ what are you going to fight with but BAM said then you have to train for the knockout punches we look at the people in the wilderness brother branham topped the rock when Moses smoked the rock and the water come out brother branham type that is John 3:16 how the Moses smoked the waters and the waters poured out everybody was fed everybody drank but they everyone perished there's going to take more than that word so as he comes as he comes to Rebecca's family and he comes to minute she does she accepts the eleazar's is the messenger and in the net she accepts I the way I like to look at it she watered the camels as she accepted the camels because brother branham typed him as the word but the Brenham said the beast the camel was a beast and the Beast represented power and the power towards the work so not only did she accept a messenger she accepted the word that the messenger brought and so he comes to her and after she accepts and he gives her the two of the earrings in the in the bracelets way in 10 shekels as he comes to her family her family notices the gifts that she's God and the messenger goes to her family to and preaches the same message to her family they'd appreciate her but what did they want they wanted the gifts that's all they could look at in the Bible and the Bible talks about Laban seeing or coming up to Rebecca what stands out most about that Scripture was he saw the gifts that Eliezer gave them that's what happened in our day but what people lost their focus of Isaac of Christ from the very start when they saw the gifts when they saw the miracles the healing the calling out that's where they place their emphases at was on the gifts and here's where the bride she's seen the owner of the gifts she's seen where the gifts came from where they get gifts belong and we and we look at the people back in that day you see when brother Branham was message started turned to the bride when brother Brandon booth brother Brandon said when he called it a third pool it's a calling out it's a pulling away then you had these ministers trying to take brother Branham to go get healing campaigns they even in the services you look back and listen to the seals brother Brian was telling in the seals when we get done here after after we preached his service hopefully we will have a have a healing line because that's what the people wanted and when it when it got less and less when the gifts didn't come like they did before they start following away and that's what that wasn't what Rebecca saw if you take the gifts that Rebecca had look at the gifts that Rebecca was given he gave her the bracelets he gave her the earrings and then they went into the tent sat with the family they gave her more precious jewels he gave jewels and precious gifts to the family so what did they say to him when he said I need to go I'm taking the bride go stay with us ten more days stay with us here with ten more days this wait a while as long as he was there the gifts were there as long as the gifts were coming they were satisfied as long as the gifts was coming they was never seeing the message of Isaac and here when you look at the people that in the last thing you look at the people now the people in the message why are they leaving they've been here 30 40 years you're not seeing the healing like you used to you're not seeing the souls saved like you used to you're seeing a message of correction you're seeing a message of preparation you see in a clothing of the bride it's not about you know speaking of tongues calling out and people rising up and you know everything is happy and getting a message of love every service everybody's coming in expecting to get a jewel sometimes you're gonna get a Brier sometimes you're gonna get a stick sometimes that's more than gold if you apply it in the right way so what does what does that leisure tell Rebecca we know he didn't go with the John 3:16 message but John 3:16 says for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son for the world the cosmos everybody for God would have no man perish so he gives so what is John 15 the same the same man that wrote John 3:16 in John 15 9 19 says if you were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of the world this is the message that el easier takes to Rebecca you're not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hated you hey if you ride you're not gonna fit in you're not gonna lie I've told my boys going to school don't try to fit in no matter how you try to if your seed I don't care how you try to fit in you ain't gonna fit in hey that Holy Ghost is going to make sure you don't fit in I don't care how hard you try many tells room you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that's why they hate you because you're peculiar that you show fourth praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light those verses those chapters without John 3:16 they're nothing you can't have those without John 3:16 but you can't have John 3:16 without having those if you're bright it's part of it just a few more verses here this is Eleazar preaching there Rebecca you could take it for your day you can take it for Rebecca's day whatever you want to do according to he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will visions 5 and 27 that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that they should be holy and without blemish you say Billy Joe I'm bright I don't have no spots sometimes people can't see their spots because they got so many wrinkles wrinkles hide spots I've said this before I probably haven't said it here you have people that think that tenure puts him in the bride I've been here 20 30 40 years I've been following this message that's the big cliche I've been following the message for 20 30 40 years that's that's your problem you've been following it everyone that followed the pillar fire out of out of Egypt perished because they followed it you have to become what you're following you have to get into what you're following you can't follow the message you can't follow the messages expect to be saved you're just following around what you all you're doing is eating dust because the message is kicking up the dust variety dust whether Bram said at Thomas decision wonder why Rebecca came before any other other girls this is what I said before while she was blood relation did you know that Rebecca and Isaac were cousins the bride of Jesus Christ is blood relation to him a blot of the blood brought by bride no wonder she was led by the spirit there was a connection coming together there was a union coming together blood relation with Jesus Christ now let's look at the journey after she receives the gifts they tried to get him to stay and he says I'm leaving today the bride's leaving I'm calling out the bride that was the message in this last day I'm calling out the bride just so you're not confused I'm brother Branham left the scene Eliezer didn't the same calling in the fivefold ministry is the call of El easier topic to Rebecca it's the same call then as it was when brother Branham came on the scene you know when you when you look at it now you you wonder why you don't see as many people at the altar you don't see so many people given their lives you see people are not coming to church but on Sundays anymore you know you know people get heartbroken that I don't cuz I know it's almost over there's fewer coming in the fewer they're coming in demeans the next one could be the last warm it's almost over the bride the marriage is already done okay some of you thinking hey we're gonna get married that part's already over in 50 1953 in Owensboro Kentucky brother Branham it was in 53 when brother banner first used the term mist Jesus Christ so it's over the merits has already happened she's producing she's bringing forth a son called Jesus Christ so if she leaves the camel train heads out we look at Rebecca she takes her gift she's got these gifts what does she do with hers I'm sure the family stockpiled theirs they used it to get hey I got a gift from the Prophet I got a belt buckle he prayed for me and I got healed how how many of remember brother banner talking about that young lady over an act in Kentucky that was dying and he's talking about you couldn't even lay a bedsheet on her and talked about her sister running down the hill screaming after she got healed I met that woman that the one that was coming down her sister she had blue jean shorts on smoking cigarettes she accepted a gift that's all that mattered she accepted a gift she missed the picture the Eleazar was painting every gift that was given look at every gift was given where'd it come to come from the father it came from Isaac if you read that chapter on Abraham and Isaac it refers to Abraham and it refers to Isaac as his master so all these gifts that they were getting came from Isaac and they did not realize where it came from if they didn't care they were richer that's been what people want what does Rebekah do with her gifts she takes him back to the word the camels she takes her gifts and climbs on the word it takes him right back to where they came from so they go on the journey they're going on this journey back to be dyes it I'd love to been a fly on a camel listening to Eliezer tell her about Isaac I've always wondered I guess because I don't I don't question my position in the bride for me God was real that to me is I'm standing here I no longer question that and being in that position and those of you that are I hope we all are consider yourself a member of the bride how could you hear the message the picture that el easier of this day painted of Jesus Christ and wants something else wants something different and no no doubt is they went on the journey the hell easier begin to talk to her and tell her about his master always they is they kept going you begin to explain what do you look like his mannerisms how much land he had how tall he was how he liked address what do you like to eat he would explain it to her and they would stop as she would say oh hi ELISA kill me simple it would stop to feed the camels el easier tell me some more they would stop to camp for the night el easier tell me more about Isaac they would be ready to lay down and she said hey leader don't don't stop talking don't stop describing it to me she fell in love with him before she ever saw him you can't say you've never seen him because this message has painted a picture so clear when you see him you'll know exactly who he is there'll be no doubt there'll be no doubt here he is but a laser is painting this picture to her and she's she don't see the gifts she still has them she don't think about him they're there but all she can think about is Isaac but the random talks about the story of Rebekah and Isaac how the random says in Redemption by judgment a beautiful story of Rebekah and how she got on the camel and went to meet Isaac with Eliezer and Isaac being the type of Christ the Son of God which was the son of Abraham who fell heir to all Abraham's Goods and all he had he was out in the field the evening time wandering around the field when he saw the beautiful Rebecca coming on candle on a camel but BAM said oh my that makes heels go through me the beautiful Rebecca he'd never seen her he never knew who she was but Eleazer was hunting her up and he found her by the witness the holy spirit said when Rebecca come to water the camels which was a sign that she was willing to go and got on the camel and went to me when he was out in the field halfway from the father's house when Rebecca saw Isaac she veiled her face she jumped off the camel and run to meet him it was love at first sight I don't know what he's gonna look like he may be a big man he made me a little man he may be brown he may be wide he may be black I don't know what color will be what kind of hair light what color eyes he'll be but I love him I don't care what he looks like I love him yes sir the church will love him and reading then I got the brother branham goes on to say he says he's on the road now he says I believe he's left the ivory palaces coming to town to receive his bride that was in 54 my brother Brandon believed that then where are we at now where what position are we on the bride are we dressed are we fully dressed you got a button undone somewhere is your veil not properly arranged there's your wedding dress not him the right way looking at how people back in that day brother Branham was here you know how much he loved God you know how much he loved the word I mean brother Branham he made no bones about Christ being the love of his life in the way he could paint a picture of him how he could explain him and people not want it and you got people now in this message that are falling away from this message trying to point it to humanity of ele easier looking at a man's humanity and putting the focus on that because a bridge vision that he had they can't find proof of it last time I read God said that Elijah was gonna know it J Hugh but I don't think that's what happened does that make God not God you say well brother Joe do you believe the bridge absolutely just like he said it but that's not part of the word that was there for somebody for some reason but that's not to me I'm not eating that I believe it with everything that's in me that's not on my plate that's not what I'm eating I'm eating the word I'm eating Jesus Christ that's just a picture in the dining room in my book it's part of the setting for some reason it's there but what I'm looking at is the picture that he painted the meal that he prepared me in Jesus Christ I'm not gonna look at his humanity I was talking to a friend of mine I came to visit here a few months ago and he was telling me but several years ago him and his father went to I believe it was brother banks wood that lived beside brother Branham if I'm not mistaken they went to visit brother banks son David and he said they were sitting there talking to him for a while and so David told him said that one afternoon he said brother Branham came walking down the sidewalk was just weeping just sobbing and brother banks like brother Brandon what's wrong he said I believe God's gonna take me he said brother Brandon what are you talking about he said I believe God's going to take me he said why wait something he said they believe I'm God and it killed brother Branham they just killed him to think that I preached I preached this picture of Isaac I've pitched this picture picture of Jesus Christ for so long and they think I'm preaching me they think I'm painting a picture of myself and he said brother branham said but it ain't the amount of hair he said it's my closest friends it's the ones that were around him every day it's the ones he ate with the ones he hunted with they thought he was God and it just killed brother branham to think that look at look at Rebecca where does she meet him at she met him in the field but we you know the scripture will meet him in the air we won't meet him in heaven we won't meet him in there and I like that time the biggest message I want to get to you in talking to you about Rebecca was she didn't go looking for a Bryan Bob ride girl she wasn't looking once she was going through her daily chores she was going to get water to cook with to drink to do the dishes her daily routine that's what she was doing and she run into the messenger you can't say I came searching for a bride like a bragger if you didn't search nothing you didn't search for anything but we sing that song up here the more I seek Him that song was true but you can only seek him after you're found and I'm going to change this picture here a little bit I'm gonna go to Ruth this is my favorite story in the book if you want to call it story blessed hi brother Tim Burnett was here but Tim said something he was preaching on I don't remember what it was was a certain strain of his that he preached on that more than anything and the bride is my strain I guess because it's it talks about me and I don't I don't know why but there ain't nothing that pulls the strings of my souls like seeing myself in a book but look at Ruth Ruth according to historians her and Oprah Oprah was the daughter of King Eglon of Moab you know the story her husband dies May long dies Chilean dies Oprah's corpus husband Naomi's husband is dead so she's going back to the homeland Ruth is not about to leave her no matter what I used to think it when I heard that when I was younger I didn't read much I was ticked for what people said that Naomi typed the church as far as the world church and I got the reading when I got stay brother Brandon said that she typed though Jewish gospel she was the gospel that brought the Gentile bride in and I just had done something for me I just it's just it was a picture of a Gentile bride clinging to that word just saying I'm not going anywhere I'm gonna go where you go I'm gonna I'm gonna do what you do that's hanging on to that word that's all she wanted but she didn't go looking for a bridegroom we always wonder as she come out I'm gonna read this real quick sorry I'm chopping things up I apologize Naomi now the type of the Jewish Church Ruth the type of the Gentile church notice now here she comes back see Ruth being a Gentile heathen worshiper she looked back and said I'll go with you where you live I'll live where you die I'll die where you're buried I'll be buried let your God be my god that's the Gentile church accepting salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord what a beautiful picture Bodrum says I wish we had more time on the inside brother Branham says she said let your people will be my people let me live where you live let me die were you dying let me be buried where you're buried let your God be my god beautiful picture of the young Gentile church coming in by the old Jewish Church the Jews had packed the gospel first the thing that always stood out to me was when she said let's your God be my god you and I got to study in this and I've had these notes most of these notes for about a year I got there's something that stood out to me and here's a Gentile woman a MOBOT woman tell Naomi let your God be my god but I got to think of that what Ruth didn't realize she was gonna bring forth the very God in flesh Naomi's God in flesh she didn't know what she was saying Naomi's God was going to become her God in more ways than she ever thought I thought Lord let that be in us let us produce the God the God of our life you know we we hear that song we sing that song he became me that that I could become him you know anything it becomes words it becomes words you say hey Bill how could it become words look at your actions are you doing what your God would do are you going where your God would go she comes to a strange land there's just something about a Naomi that she can't leave coming to - Naomi she's coming to a strange land she's coming to a strange people but they don't shun her as a Gentile they were they were considered dogs which was pretty much a good sign that these were godly people she goes to a field - to glean she's poor she lived to everything she had her dad was a king but she gave it all up for the God of Naomi what brings her to the field when I got stainless I wonder what brought Ruth to the field did glean but ask yourself that question those that were saved were we're not morning the message what brought you to the field of the word you can't say I was searching for something because you weren't it was a hunger Ruth was hungry that's what brought you this word there was there's that seed that's inside of you but when you take your first breath of life that's seed that gets dropped down in there a live seed hungers it's got to have nourishment or it'll die there's nourishment and there's qualities in water that you can't that the seed has to take to grow and so Ruth was hungry she wasn't looking to get married she was going to get food that's that's what brought you here you you were looking for something to eat you're eating the rotten corn of denominations you're eating molded food in denominations and that seed wasn't wasn't gathering nourishment but here she comes to a field she steps in this field and she don't know it when God's eyes she owns it all you didn't know what when you came here you didn't know what when you came into the word that everything that you're standing on everything you're eating belongs to you anyway she couldn't see that all she knew she had a hunger that's why you see people come and leave they come into this world with ulterior motives they come in with with an agenda they're not hungry some of them come in because they they think hey there's some wealthy people there I can rub shoulders with him we'd be buddies and this that the other it don't work that way you should have one thing on your mind is to eat I'm gonna eat that's what hungry people do they so that's what Ruth was doing she was hungry and I got I got to look in it at the gleaning the people that glean I did a search on on historical search on the people that glean back in there it's real vague during a whole lot of stuff because the poor people back in that day the poor people would allow them to glean after the the Gleaners would go forward the reapers would go forth they would they would cut the the stalks off down low they would bundle them up in sheaves and as they bundle them they're stomping moving around walking around stuff is falling off the sheaves some stuff don't get caught but it leaves a little stubble about that high little sharp stubbles and you got to crawl around in that the sheaves fall down to the pieces of barley and part of the stock and part of the tassel will fall down the ground it gets stomped by the Reapers so these Gleaners have to come in and pick that out why do you think Boaz told him to drop some handfuls for her she wasn't getting enough she wasn't getting much but if I came for a minute I want I want to paint a little picture here of Ruth gleaning she comes to the field of he knows she asked the servant can I clean in the field he tells her to go ahead she's journeyed a long time she has nothing she's poor she's hungry she needs something to eat the season but there is a dry season they reaping it when the season gets dry the barter gets dry the ground is dry and dusty she gets on her hands and her knees she's crawling through sharp stubble she's digging in the dust for little pieces of barley it's the heat of the day because their servant toboe as she's repear almost all day and only just now took a break so she's sweating she wipes her brow with her dirty hands what do you think bull ass saw when he walked up in that field no doubt she's getting scratched she's not only getting a handful cuz everything she's getting she's digging out of the dirt but Boaz walks by and he sees this little lady down on her knees dirty scratched her face dirty well she's wipe the sweat off with her dirty hands and she stops him in a track in his tracks that's exactly what God saw when he saw you you were dirty you were nothing you were digging it for everything you could get your life had reached bottom there was nowhere else for you to go you were starving to death and you crawl down on your knees to pick a piece of barley piece of barley called the word out of the dirt I was born in this message but I know a lot of people that came in and you people that came from different denominations you can't tell me the first time you heard that word satisfied something in you that you never never had Ruth's expected to go glean corn she said I'm gonna go get some corn that's all she never ate she didn't know what barley was all she ever ate was denominational corn she gets into a field she's crawling around and then the lord of the harvest walks into the field to look at her he walks by just say he's walking by and he looks over he stops well who's that Oh Lord that's Jean taro he's been here all day he's gleamed since morning he hasn't went to another field but he looked at brother Jean and fell in love with him and his dirty sinful fleshly humanity condition if you can't see yourself in truth you need to go back you need to pray you're through and go back and read it again but Ruth is she don't see him coming she want to satisfy that hunger but what was he was searching that day I was telling brother Donnie back there earlier I read some what they call a Midrash it's the rabbi's back in the second century took the old Jewish scroll was and start explaining them he's talking about Boaz and and Ruth and they they claimed that the day that Ruth and Naomi got to Bethlehem the people that met her met them the people of the city that met them were coming from the funeral of his wife so Boaz he was searching he needed somebody to carry on his name that was the same back then you had to have heirs but here there's something about her through the sweat through the dust through the dirt he looks at her and he falls in love with her and the Bible says the result there's kind of all kinds of maidens in the field not one of them moved him not one of him could turn the eye of Boaz but he fell in love with her so what does he tell his servants brother branham citizenry Demers redemption he said to the servants you see that young lady right there behind you yes sir let the gleaning be heavy every once in a while I'll drop a handful on purpose I love those handfuls don't you gleaning behind the Reapers drop a handful on purpose that she could get it how Ruth felt when she grabbed a handful said the Reaper turn around said that's alright that's alright you can have it you're not still picking up pieces you own the field you can get all you want you can get all you want when the day was over she beat out all her wheat and put it in her apron and took it to her mother-in-law her mother-in-law advised her if you want to find out how to do Paul said after giving in Hebrews 10 the chapter of faith now seeing that were compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every sin and run the race this patient is set before us lay aside every weight and the sin rather so easily beset us and run with patience so she goes to nail me and in my notes here I got her parentheses the gospel because every time she goes back to Naomi Naomi's advising or something this is a gospel telling her what to do she says don't you leave that field don't you leave this word you stay right here in this world since when the maidens go out you go with them don't be tossed about with every wind of doctrine you stay in Boaz's field and she stayed in Boaz this field to the harvest was over I'd say after Ruth was noticed by Boaz I'd say he came to the field every day and stayed as long as he could he wasn't going to miss it he was going to make sure that he saw Ruth in the field that's no different than your God tonight every service he comes here and he waits for you to walk in he stands up here his heart beating out of his chest for you to walk through that door and if you don't come his feelings don't change from the next service you'll wait and wait for you for the brain of sitting in silent well my mom won't wait on that Boaz finds out Ruth finds out I'm sorry that Boaz is next to key in the Naomi tells her what to do go to the threshing room floor lay at his feet find him go in there and find him reading some of the biblical figure lotions of today they claimed that she was going in there so he would lay with her I thought you know that's just the devil's perversion right there but the random said she laid at his feet to show that he trusts she trusted him and a type of throwing his skirt over was the type of the Holy Spirit I thought Lord people just do anything they can to pervert the word so Boaz tells Ruth I'll do whatever is required of me whatever it cost I'm gonna do of course you know the story how he goes outside the gate he goes outside the gate and with the next of kin and the little parlay they have out there and he says yeah I'll redeem Naomi's as well that day you redeemed Naomi you'll have to buy Ruth he said well I can't do that I'll Mar my own testimony then one scripture brother branham said he threw his shoe at him so my wives wanted her pretty bad but why did why did he want Ruth he saw a quality he saw a real lady through the dirt this was something he was willing to pay the price for the bride is a real lady don't matter if you're poor if you're rich it don't matter she's a real lady you don't find that anymore you know you know most of us work out here in the in the secular world and you see it every day I'm working with a girl one day she's now a nominal Christian but back then she wasn't she said just something every day she would say something filthy and just turn around and look at me and laugh so one day she come off with something just it was nasty she looked at me and says does it shock you and me say that it's no ma'am I said what would a shock means if a lady had said it and she she never you never said nothing else so that worked [Applause] so boaz is bound and determined to pay the price and i wonder if we ever if we ever stop and think about the price the bow has paid because there there's no better picture in the bible of the price of redemption that types calvary as much as Boaz outside the gate so Boaz tells her I'll pay anything she's got to be mine she's got to be mine you look at your life you look at the thing in your life everybody hides things you look at the thing in your life that you're the most ashamed of that nobody knows but you he said I'll take that I'll take that into myself you don't have to bear that shame if you bear that shame that your own humanity because I'm taking it from you the worst thing you've ever done in your life and he steps outside the gate and they begin to beating they begin to pull his beard out spit on him and you were the only thing on his mind the entire time everything they'd done every stripe he got he knew he was in it because he was buying you it was a purchase every strut the more they beat him the closer he got to you you think he felt that pain sure he did you think he was humiliated they stripped him naked we go through life every day of our life hey I'm in the message how many can say that every day of your life you'd think of the price that was paid for you only time you ever think of is when you fall and you start to repent do you ever think about Calvary on your good days when you're on top of the mountain this Calvary every of your mind so he's beaten he's bloody do you think he was just paying the price for you we weren't the only ones it goes from the beginning all the way to now there was a little bride down inhale that needed out the third seal brother branham said Eve was God's bride she fell in the garden can you imagine when that price was paid and Christ goes to hell and kicks open the doors I can imagine the first thing he said when he screamed that was Adam where art thou you think Adam just mosey don't out now I'm right here imagine he'd grab D by the hand nothing's gonna stop him she said Eve that's him right there that's him the second Adam was sitting free the first Adam and I don't believe he just jog out of hell with Eve and here we are the price that he paid all that cleaned the blood but God loved us all so much he said he gave John 3:16 what if we even what a Ruth had walked into the field and gleaned John 3:16 and walked out she was starved to death she would have starved to death but you got to have it all you've got a everything that's in the field you can't just eat part of the field you have to have it all you own it now so we mean you can eat it whenever you want so he goes outside he pays the price and what happens after he pays the price he sends Eliezer back to both Ruth says the price is paid make preparations I know in real life he didn't send a laser back I'm just dramatized in a little bit he goes back they send her back to Ruth the price has been paid Boaz has paid the price what a fruit said oh great could you tell Boaz one thing for me I'll be there I've DVR'd Ryan's Hope guiding light and all my children Wednesday nights and Saturday nights is the only time I get to watch them so as soon as those are over I'll be at the elbow as they'll be there Ryan's only hope is right here eating a word the guiding light will bring Ryan right here and all of God's children will be right here hey let's look at it for real let's look if we're gonna look at it let's look at it for real how bad do you want to be the bride have you got time have you got time to be the bride we got time for everything else we get so wrapped up in what we're doing the very God of heaven the King of glory your bridegroom sits here Wednesday night Saturday night Sunday morning with nothing on his mind but see you walk in the door and feed you a meal well we got too much to do Mahoney's has got a new muzzle loader and a new bow I want to buy and got a new gun so I got to work Wednesday night for I was over I got work Saturday night I can't make it that's your god that becomes your God we put too much things in life we put too much emphasis on life things we enjoy our pleasure our vacations hey the Vols are playing Saturday night I'll be there Sunday morning anything you put before God is your God if you miss church to have it I'm sorry but Wednesday nights Saturday nights and Sunday's is his date night for you that's his date night he comes up here he sits he pulls up a table his chair right here your chair right here and he has the waiter back there in the back preparing it cuz he's ordered it and you've ordered it you've put your order in he's put his older in and you're gonna leave him sitting here you're gonna sit home and watch Atlanta Braves play you've stood him up for a one-eyed devil you've stood up the King of glory for your own pleasure basically what you're telling him is the price he paid was not enough it's going to take more than that to get you to church hey there ain't a person in here don't fight to get to church because Satan's gonna make sure you fight he's gonna make sure he battles you every day them church doors are open you're in a battle but a price was paid for you to win that battle there should be a love a true bride will have the love to get here just because your bride you have the Holy Ghost you love God with all your heart that ain't gonna keep Satan from battling you it's going to happen I don't mean the step one toes I hope that's nobody in here I'm preached to myself too but we look at the price I want to wrap up here kiss means Redeemer brother Branham said now Boaz he had to make a public he said can you redeem her he said no he had to make a public testimony he picked off his shoe and threw it at him I said there you are but all Israel know that I've redeemed Naomi and also take Ruth I take Ruth for my bride who was it the Lord of the harvest a man there she is I redeem Naomi and get Ruth Ruth will be my bride what they say may her be that may she be like Leah and Rachel I raise up thousands and she has that's right unto Israel may she be that way and look he made a public testimony because that was studying this I had to make sure I didn't leave Naomi out she's got a major part to play in this but Brandon says she typed the Jewish church she typed Israel but you look at Naomi coming back and then we come back to nothing she lost all she had she needed a kinsman redeemer different script quotes brother Branham says naomi was redeemed and Ruth were purchased but before he could even repurchase Ruth he had to redeem Naomi you don't you think that Boaz held nan Naomi to high esteem why did he say he had Ruth is in the field she asked him she says why have I found favor in your sight because the way you've treated your mother-in-law it's been told to me and then once she comes to the threshing room floor what does she tell her he hands her the apron full of barley dough not empty to your mother-in-law but Naomi needed Redemption she needed to be redeemed back to what she had before she needed the name she needed her name reading back of her her husband so we look at the union of Boaz and Ruth produces a child and the people tell her but after the son is produced by the union of Ruth and they tell Boaz may your house be the house of Ferraz who was born on the table honor for rez was the breech Naomi needed a breach who took the child into themselves after it was born it was Naomi who produced the child the bridegroom and the bride looked up the name of course Oh bad means servant and strong supporter and it's got it as worshipper or worship so now he takes his child to nurse her bitterness returns back to worship her name has been restored through Obama through a bed without him she's got nothing she needed she needed this redemption because without the just the marriage alone just the marriage of Ruth and Boaz alone was nothing for her she had to have what they presumed produced to carry on her name and says she'd be miss to nerf the child and I looked this word up in the Hebrew is to support to confirm to be faithful uphold a nurse to stand firm to trust to be certain and to believe in she believed this child is where he stored her name back as I was studying this list and I'm done is that was steadiness house telling mother Terry Horne about it let's tell brother Terry I said but with Terry I really believe you know the union of a man and a woman when a man finds a bride and they become married in the sight of God you know I look back at Adam and Eve in the garden when God went through running through the garden calling Adam he wasn't just calling the man he was calling them both she wasn't named Eve until after the fall and God viewed them it is one and he said brother Joe he said I believe that so much he said that I believe when a man if a man and a woman are married and that woman is his eternal mate when God calls him from the grave she'll come with him and I found the quote y'all can look at it have you won this is not a doctrine so ain't ain't into that but brother Branham said this in kinsman-redeemer yesterday morning we were laying in bed a little a little late and the children didn't have to go to school we got to speaking about different things and how said what was hatred I said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love will never did begin and will never end it's eternal when a man loves a woman and marries her just because she's pretty still being into that but when a man finds a woman he loves he don't know why it loves her but he loves her she finds the man she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death or nothing else can ever separate them they stepped out into space of time and returned back to eternity eternity has dropped down in about body called time then it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish and I read that they stepped out into space of time if me and my wife go way of the grave and my name is Karl I'm gonna reach over and take her with me Christ is not complete without you you're 1 there's something about the bride that he loves you look at yourself and you say yeah I can't figure it out he didn't ask you to he didn't ask you to figure out you got to believe in his love you say why because he said so if he hasn't proved it enough but what he gave what else has he got to do you say oh brother Joe I love him too I do too but sometimes I wonder I'm speaking about myself does my life show it can people look at my life and say that man loves God i-i think about the song here he sings all the time bell bleeds and lament the second verse when she stands before him in linen white with righteousness that's not her own every time I think of that song I hear that song I think that's God looking at me but he don't see me he sees himself because it's his own righteousness that he sees you down yourself all the time you put yourself down all the time and you think why why am i this why am i that God don't look at that God don't look at your sturdy your stinking rotten humanity he didn't marry that he didn't marry that the bride to God in God's eyes is not humanity it's a bride with that spot or wrinkle and I believe with all my heart that she's just about dressed she may be fully dressed just waiting on the call let's bow our heads please seeing when it will want to be remembered say brother Joe um I believe I'm bright but I never think about it I never think about the price that was paid to purchase me maybe you're on the mountain a lot and you forget about Calvary that's the problem with this so many times we get up we never up days so long good times are going so long price of redemption just is a faded memory the only time we ever think about it is when we're down in the valley I'm to blame for that I do the same thing whenever I'm things are going well for me you know I hate to say it I forget about the cross but let's just pray in your prayer pray to yourself Laura let me recognize myself as a bride well Bram said until a bride recognizes who she is she's not getting out of here and you can't get married unless you recognize your bride Heavenly Father lord I thank you lord for her price you paid for me Lord Lord if I was to look at my own humanity look at my deeds my sins my faults my failures but what I would
