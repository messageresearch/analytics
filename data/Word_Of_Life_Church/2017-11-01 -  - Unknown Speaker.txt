picture long before with it we ever started in this existence God already had a perfect image of you of me of our family of our inheritance our children and he never takes his eye off that perfect picture and his purpose in his will is to bring you to that image I want to say Lord bring me to that image bring me to that image that perfect image that you had before the foundation of the world amen praise the Lord Jesus if you have your Bible we'll turn to the book of John chapter 10 John chapter 10 Amen brothers I have a PowerPoint that I sent you if you have it a man you could just have that ready have a few scriptures that will read and then we'll just have you be seated John chapter ten what does have you turned there and we'll begin looking at verse 10 John chapter 10 you love the Lord you appreciate his word last night amen I pray that it was a blessing and just felt to go and to continue in the same direction that we were last night and just continue in that same channel and that same thought the Lord's just had this upon my heart amen and just want to carry right on amen John chapter 10 verse 10 we'll begin reading here let's actually start at verse 7 then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but here's why the thief comes but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep we'll turn to John chapter 16 just a few chapters over John chapter 16 and verse 24 and in that day verse 23 and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name amazing that after all the time of being with Jesus they hadn't recognized the authority and the power that was in his name that actually the scripture says Jesus said up until this point you haven't even asked anything in my name he says let's read it again hitherto you have asked nothing in my name ask ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full I won't full joy him head braise the Lord wood has turned to the book of Revelation chapter 12 one more and we'll have you be seated amen just want to want to catch this one scripture here Revelation chapter 12 amen in verse 12 woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the seal for the devil is come unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time the devil knows that do we know it but there's only just a small little space of time left that's why the devil fights harder than ever before remember he's not omniscient he can't he doesn't know all things like God knows all he knows is what he can see literally physically I'm speaking literally here he's not like God he can't read the mind the only way the devil knows where time is in history is by watching and seeing he sees it when he sees the depravity the immorality he sees it when he sees homosexuality on the rise he knows the Bible and he believes the Bible he's a believer the Bible says you believe in God so does the devil he fears and he trembles he knows the scripture says that in the coming of the Son of man that it shall be just like it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah the devil sees the days of sodom coming and he knows must be short something's about to take place amen praise the Lord let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the reading of your word this morning we just asked Oh God would you come and make your word real to your people father I believe Lord that you're here because you've been invited and you come where you're invited Lord Father now may you just feel comfortable amongst us Lord may you take this simple little thought that you've given me Lord you've burden my heart with a heavy burden Lord something father maybe today's service Lord would be something that would be real personable personal to me Lord because you dealt with me on such a personal level Lord when you gave me this inspiration father but I want that too Lord not just bless me but allow me to communicate that burden to these people so that they can be blessed and edified also we ask Lord that you would come and have your way take control of this service in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated I'd like to speak to you on taking back your god-given property brother Branham says here in the resurrection of Lazarus and you have this you could put it up and man becomes a son of God not Hillman himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done unto you there he is there he is he says in the message what was the Holy Ghost given for the same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutheran's that sanctified the Methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it will be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for that's what the Holy Ghost is for when it will be so powerful brother Branham says this Holy Spirit will come under such power and such authority in that church that's me brother that's you then I literally draw the rest of them from the grave Oh God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture he says oh don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get at the mystery of God revealed to his church that's what's holding back the coming of Christ now and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church you know there's been power and authority that was given to Jesus there was power and authority that was given to the Son of God and the Bible says that all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his church so we know that we've been given supernatural power and authority over the devil but the Prophet says the problem is is that it lays dormant within the church he says also it is a fact that the Prophet for the last age must bring forth a message from God that will forerun the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers notice this and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power I think what it meant when the scripture says here just speaking of Jesus in Matthew chapter 7 verse 28 and 29 and brothers you can just follow me as I quote these the Bible says it came to pass when Jesus ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes the scripture says he taught them as one having authority this word Authority means with mastery with power with liberty as one who is in control now these people had heard from the scribes their entire life they had heard Pharisees teach and Sadducees teach and they were not illiterate men but they were educated eloquent in their speech have you ever heard someone and it's fascinating just to listen to someone a professor of any kind of subject when a person knows the subject that they study and they know the material you even say here a theologian break down certain Greek words and words in the Bible it can become fascinating just to listen and to hear the sheer brilliance of how well they know the subject if you hear a scientist start to break down something on the scientific level something you know me or you you could sit and listen and it just sounds like they're speaking another language but yet we can become so impressed just by the intelligence of that person because they know the subject very well they don't struggle when they speak they speak it and it just flows and the Bible says this is how the people heard the teachers the Pharisees as they took from the law of Moses and they were so skilled and and and I heard it said in one way that they could take a scroll that was written in the law the law was written in that scroll and they could take a pin and stick it through the the road up roll and tell you every letter that the the pin hit because they knew the scroll so well and the people had listened for so long to these Pharisees and to these scribes as they were intelligent but let me tell you before Jesus came on the scene there were still lepers there were still diseases there were people who could not speak there were mothers who had lost children there was adulterers and adultery there was fornication there was sickness there was blind people and I ask you where did they go for healing where did they go for deliverance when a mother had a child who was bound by a demon spirit when these demons didn't to show up suddenly when Jesus came on the scene but Satan had been afflicting God's people he had them in bondage and in under slavery he had been afflicting them with disease he had been afflicting them with sickness and with with bondage of sin there there in those days where I asked you could the family go who was struggling with marriage and a marriage may be on the brink of divorce and you know Moses say these were people these were children of God where could they turn to when their child was so full of a disease that he literally convulsed and shook in his body and they didn't know what to do with him where did they take their children and their and their family when they were addicted to drugs and addicted to alcohol and addicted to things of the world where could they take the church because where could they take their family all they could take him to was to a Pharisee who could recite the Word of God who could teach the Word of God and they could they could bring it under such a teaching but at the end of the day it didn't bring deliverance to the child it didn't bring deliverance to the marriage who was struggling these people needed a person who didn't just have an intelligence of the law but they needed to hear someone who had authority when he spoke who had power when his words came across his mouth and the scripture says when they heard them they were astonished because he didn't just speak authoritative Lee you know there's a very big difference in speaking authoritative Lee and speaking with authority a man can scream and raise his voice and he can act like he has authority he could yell and have a boisterous tone to his voice and even a person can become in fear and you could become you know shook up a little bit by that when a person yells but there's a difference when a person speaks authoritative Lee and when a person speaks with authority and the Bible says that he spoke he taught them as one having authority this was a person who knew who he was he knew who he came from he knew that upon his words all of heaven listen he knew that heaven backed up his words and when his words and the voice and the oxygen that God gave him in his body started coming up from his lungs and touched his vocal cords all heaven listened to the words of Jesus Christ and I ask you where could they take their families when they were addicted where could they take their children when they were addicted where could they take their families when they were broken where could they turn where could they go and today I asked the same question where can we come to when our families are in trouble when our children are addicted when our families are struggling when we have problems and real issues all my brother and my sister we don't need a theology lesson we don't need some kind of intelligence or a person who could speak eloquently or a person who could speak intelligently the churches of the world today are filled with men who could speak more eloquent than me or any other brother here today they're filled with people who sent years in sat in a school and listened to theology and doctrines of divinity and they told them in the Greek and they taught them in the Hebrew and they studied the Word of God and they come out of that school and they're putting on a pastorship of a church and they start a church on the man's ability or the man's intelligence and they build programs why because that's all that they have to hold the people they build programs and they build prayer they build dramas and they they put a school in the church nothing wrong with that and they put in you you notice every year these great churches get bigger and bigger and their budgets and their programs get bigger and bigger and they become more intelligent and it's filled today it's filled with churches of programs and skits and funny jokes and their sermons are filled with one-line jokes and one-line things trying to to have some kind of substance to give to the people they put a coffee shop in their vegetable for people to be able to have a Starbucks coffee and a doughnut while they sit in church why because that's all they have but I asked you my brother where can the hurting go where can the hungry go where can the bound go coffee can't set you free donuts cannot fix your marriage programs cannot give you power but what we need today is not a donut or a coffee we need people with authority and power to break the grip and the chains of the enemy [Applause] we need power and authority because we're facing a real devil we have real problems we have families with real issues and I say today we don't need a musket we don't need a funny joke we need the power of a mighty God in a real way to come and break the grip of the enemy off of her life and when Jesus came he brought power and he brought authority he spoke and that's why they asked him by what authority do you do these things and who gave thee this authority they asked him in whose name did you cast out these Devils and whose name did you do these things and what power or what authority did you cast out this devil they wanted to know where did you get your power where did you get your authority where did you get the with the way that you squared is it coming from where is this power coming from Oh what the church didn't know and what the world didn't know is that God was restoring Kingdom Authority and Kingdom power back to the people of God and he spoke as a king speaks he spoke in parables and he always referred to Kingdom the kingdom of heaven is like the kingdom of heaven now today we don't even know what Kingdom means and we read that word and we recite that scripture the kingdom of heaven behold the kingdom of God the kingdom of heaven but where do we really know what it really means back in those days there were real kings and there were real kingdoms the age that I grew up abhorrent born and I've never since there every every day I've been here on earth I've never been to a real there is a couple kingdoms a couple real kings but really there's really no such thing even the United Kingdom they call it the United Kingdom but it's not you and it's not a kingdom they have a king and they have a queen but you know what that queen has nothing to do with their everyday life they she's nothing more than a symbol and I am Britain has not had a King since you know with the last king they had the man who wrote this Bible King James was the last king who actually ruled because there's something different in a sovereign in one who rules and one who's a king or a queen you see you can actually have a person as a queen and call herself a sovereign or a king or a queen but there's a very real difference when that person rules their kingdom and Jesus came to rule his kingdom brother Branham says this he says I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority I'm afraid that Holy Ghost born men don't realize their Authority or the authority that God has permitted to his church I'll give unto thee the keys of the kingdom brother Branham says so exercise your faith let it loose let God have his way o God the Great Spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was God and did you know you were in him then if you're a Christian now you were in him then and if that be so the whole Godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and then when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later and we were at Calvary with him he went in the grave and we went in the grave with him we raised with him in his resurrection and now we've ascended by his spirit into the throne of grace setting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus listen to this and when the entire Word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ in there God made me pay for my sins in him there then he raised up and then he raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated together and now we're seated together with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you can only believe what God has given you Jesus spoke the word and it was so why the scripture said so the Bible says he gave him Authority and he gave him power and Jesus said in my name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll take up serpents and drink deadly things and it will harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover oh I cry speak Moses and go forward if you say to this mountain not if you pray to this mountain not if you pray to this mountain but if you say to this mountain because Authority comes by the voice authority comes by words Authority comes not by nodding not by thinking but by speaking God gave us a voice let the redeemed of the Lord the Bible says let the redeemed of the Lord say so why cry unto me speak if you say to this mountain not pray but if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said and brother Brennan says Satan knew that he had just a short-time that's what the scripture says in Revelations chapter 12 he said that he knew that he had just a short time and he knew so what was he trying to do he was trying to attack the purpose and the seed of God that's what he that's why he infiltrated the human race in the Garden of Eden he was trying to destroy the seed of God and he thought he was successful he thought he had accomplished his purpose but God said what I'm going to do I'm gonna take a seed and I'm gonna put a seed down inside of the earth down inside of the ground I'm gonna bury the treasure I'm gonna hide the treasure from the devil in a realm called the soul because the devil can afflict the flesh he can give us the Jesus he could give us sicknesses he could give us bodily harm he could even destroy our own human body and he could also attach your spirit he could also attach your memory he could start to get you and attach you on your affection and your reasoning and your conscience and your memory but God said but I'm gonna put my elected seed not in the flesh not in the spirit I'm gonna hide it in the soul because the devil can't get to the soul hallelujah and God knew when you heard the word of God maybe you didn't even realize it but something not in your flesh not in your spirit but something down on the inside of you responded to the Word of God that's why brother Adam said if you are gods you always were gods and you never cannot be gods Jesus said I come from God I go back to God he knew where he came from and where he came from gave him authority and power do you know where you come from know that you were in the back part of God's mind as an attribute a spiritual gene of your father and you came to this world to be tested and tried and your character to be refined but when you heard the word of God you recognized that as Eagles food you heard you heard from your theophany hallelujah and Satan thought he had him but God seed his line would go on through all the way through Redemption and Satan would follow that line it's even said that the tree of knowledge of good and evil have seen a painting one time it was it was a picture of a literal tree of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life and they were so close together that their branches actually intertwined and the prophet of God says this in the church age book he said the trees were so close they literally their branches intertwined one in another what was it Satan trying everything he can to destroy that seat of God and he thought he had him when he killed King and when he killed Abel he thought he had him when he destroyed Abel but then there came a Seth and he thought he had him one who destroyed Seth but then there came a Jacob he thought he had him when he killed when he destroyed Abraham when he destroyed Isaac but God seed and his purpose kept moving and kept flowing Jesus said here's my purpose I've come that they might have they be in my seed that they might have life and here's the devil's purpose to steal to kill and to destroy and that's what his purpose is and just as busy as God has been and his purpose Satan has been just as busy trying to destroy to steal and kill from the family of God he literally followed that seedless and he followed that line all the way till he came to Jesus Christ he knew something was different about this person the Bible says that the demons that the devils even knew when they seen him they said why have you come to torment us before our time they recognized the spiritual authority that Jesus had they recognized the spiritual authority they recognized though he didn't look like it he was a king [Music] now his kingdom was not on the earth he was a king from heaven and he laid aside his crown he laid aside his royal robes and he built a body he created a sperm and an egg and the blood cell and he came forth as a human being he was the man god he was the man God the god man brother Branham says it this way he was 100% God and he was 100% man don't let anybody ever tell you that he wasn't a man he was in every way tempted and tried and tested in every category that you as a human being in order to be a kinsman redeemer he took on flesh just like your flesh he got tired he got weary he felt pain oh when they nailed him to a cross and they nailed that stake in his hand he felt the pain as a man he felt the agony as a man he became so tired that God had to send angels to minister unto his spirit st. new something something different say it eventually recognized who he was tried to tempt him in the wilderness took him to a high mountain tried to get him to cast himself down said surely God the Angels will bear you up Jesus said get behind me Satan tried to get him to come to his position showed him all the kingdoms of the earth brother Branham says but Jesus knew one day he's going to inherit those kingdoms anyway and he defeated the devil in the wilderness and he comes out of the wilderness with power and with authority he's baptized in the Jordan River and Satan thought when they arrested him so what is his plan start to do he tries to destroy that seed of God he tried to destroy him he arrested him and then and the Bible says that they crowned him with the crown of thorns they spit in his face they mocked him they slapped him in the face and the Bible says they hung him upon a cross and nailed him to a tree no doubt Satan thought he had him because Satan knew the plan of God now remember Satan is not omniscient he's not all-knowing he doesn't know all things he believes the word and Satan listened and listens to the voices of prophets because he knows that the word comes to the Prophet and no doubt Satan was reading the words of Isaiah no doubt he was reading when Jesus stood in the temple and said this day this scripture is fulfilled no doubt Satan said that's exactly what Isaiah said that's exactly what the Prophet said no doubt when Jesus moved and eneded signs and wonders and miracles and he had authority and he had powers of Satan knowing my time is short the scripture says he's upset and he has fury and he has anger because he knows he has just a short space of time to interrupt the program of God and you know what he knew he knew that God as the Prophet said judged him as a sinner and Satan knew that if he died a sinner he'd go to hell no doubt he had been scheming and he had been planning had this entire thing all worked up it's gonna use the very word of God against God himself and the Bible says that the earth turned the sky turned black and the Sun hid its face what is it it looks like victory for the devil it looks like victory for the kingdom of darkness it looked like victory for the devil himself and Jesus died and they took his body and they put him in a tomb oh I could just hear hell starting to shout I could hear the party start getting second hear the the party starting down and the under realms of the lost and Satan and his demons and remember he doesn't know everything for all he know what a dumb devil what a dumb devil he thought he could kill him as a sinner and God would send him to hell and that's exactly what he did brother Brennan says here he goes oh the Bible says the same the Dia's sin descended a sin it is the same one who descended and preached to the souls that were in prison that prepended not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah and so Jesus the sins is theophany goes down into hell you think he was just laying in that tomb and his body is just laying there but what the devil didn't know and what the disciples didn't even know it's the mighty banker was busy at work conquering his kingdom they thought he was just laying there doing nothing but he was busy at work and he goes down into the realm of mortals you know just below the region of mortals the region of mortal beans lays the realm of demon power just below this realm of mortals just below us in another dimension prophet of God said that that just above us is that is the dimension of angels and powers and supernatural just in another dimension and the go up just a little bit beyond that is paradise where Abraham and Isaac and Ezekiel was and then just above that dimension is heaven itself where the son of God where God Himself is but take that the reverse the other way prophet of God said just below this room of mortals lays the realm of demon power and below that above that lays the souls of the unjust and below the souls of the unjust lays the very domain of Satan himself hell Hades gianna they caught him many different things in the Bible they called it Guiana because outside of Jerusalem gana was the the ditch where they put all the trash and they burn it and they called it on fire and it burned with fire for days Hell where Satan was just below just above us lays the holy spirit then under the altar lays the souls of just men and the next is God himself one going downward one going upward and you're caught right in the middle of those two rims and the prophet of God says your entire life the rim from below is trying to influence you and the rim from above is trying to influence you there's where your battle is and Jesus dies and he goes down there oh I could see him on Friday afternoon after his death only comes to the door and the regions of the loss and he knocks on the door brother Branham says in there was women and children and men those unjust ones who didn't repent into long suffering days he was going to preach two souls that were in prison young ladies down there men down there women down there there was old there was young they were all together in this hideous place the Prophet says I seen that hideous place one time in a hospital bed I seen it I seen hell and I was falling and falling and falling and falling seemed like I would never stop falling what is it brother an sees hell the prison of the lost souls oh and that mournful place in that hideous place Jesus walked to the door and everything had to witness that he was the son of God they had been preached you in the long suffering days of Noah and Jesus said you remember when you were young and you were in the days of Noah you remember when Noah was preaching Noah was preaching about me I am the one who Noah was preaching about and I'm the one who was anointing and inspiring Noah to preach Jesus says I'm the one who anak spoke of I'm the one who Enoch spoke of I'm the seed of the woman Satan has no idea what's taking place he's in Hell celebratin partying music's loud everybody's dancing for all he knows he's got victory little does he know Jesus is just one rim above him preaching a sermon and Jesus said I was the seat I'm the one who Enoch spoke of I'm the seed of the woman that was to bruise the serpent every word of God has been fulfilled I died just a little bit ago yonder on Calvary my blood is still wet on the cross and at Calvary I purchased my church and then brother Branham says he goes on down just a little bit further he goes down into the regions of demons own to the very gates of Hell and he knocks at the door I imagine as the partying was going and the music was loud suddenly someone says hey do you hear that he has sounds like someone's knocking and suddenly they said turn the music down and they hear enough Satan says oh man I thought everybody was here who's missing brother Bannon says he knocks at the door Oh his body was laying in the tomb little did they know the mighty Conqueror was visiting the just and the unjust he was visiting the very gates of Hell he was visiting the very torment and Hades the very place and the seed and the throne of the devil brother Adam says when he does the devil comes to the door and I can just hear him say oh it's you you finally arrived God judged you as a sinner and now you've come to hell brother Adam says oh there it comes and Satan says oh you finally arrived I thought I had you when I killed Abel I thought I had you and brother venom says you see when the seed was promised in the Garden of Eden the devil is constantly tried to destroy that seed and the death of Abel coming of Seth was just death burial and resurrection and the seed must continue and he said I thought I had you when I destroyed Abel I thought I had you when I destroyed the prophets I was positive I had you when I beheaded John but now after all this time you finally arrived and I've got you now brother branham says I could just hear Jesus say come here Satan now it wasn't yelling he wasn't screaming he didn't have a boisterous voice he knew who he was he knew his mission he knew his purpose and he knew all handed was going to back up his words and he said come here Satan I'm the boss now he reaches over and grabs the keys of death hell and put it on his side and he says I want to serve you and put you on notice you've been a bluff long enough devil but I'm the virgin born son of God my blood is still wet on the and the debt has been paid you have no rights no more devil you have no authority anymore Satan you're stripped give me those keys they belong to me [Applause] hallelujah that's why the book of Revelation says jesus said fear not for I am the first and the last and I have the keys of hell and death Oh hallelujah but the Brennan says that's right he turned around and gave him a good healthy kick and he slammed the door and said stay in there devil I'm the boss from now on I got the keys to death and hell and I can hear him as he starts up Easter's coming times passing fast but there's another group where's Joe where's Abraham were they at where's those fellows that trusted God's Word he's forgotten them to death annihilate them was it all over never prophet says never God has to keep his word I could see him take a little peep into paradise look over and I could see Sarah and Abraham walking around up there and after a while they hear a knock brother Brandon says Oh looky here something on the door Abraham goes and opens the door said honey come here look here back that's the very same one that stood with me under the old tree on that day and made a promise to me that's the same one oh just that I can see Daniel look over and Daniel said that's the rock that was hewn out of the mountain just as certain as I'm standing here that's the same one I could see Joel Brides up and say that's my redeemer that said that I said I knew that he lived and someday I'd seen with my own eyes ZQ looks over the top is he cursed as I've seen that same person he was the will in the middle of the will turning way up in the middle of the air here comes Enoch Enoch said I saw him coming with ten thousands of his Saints to execute judgment my brethren Jesus says I'm the one that you think I am I'm the seed of the woman I'm the son of David I'm the son of God I was the rock in the wilderness I was the man of the fell from heaven I was the quail that you ate in the morning I was the brazen serpent that was lifted up to deliver you from diseases I am she who was allowed was dead but is alive forevermore I am the first I am the last I am the Alpha the Omega and all power in heaven and earth has been given to me all authority and all power has been given to me I have the keys of death and how do you realize the authority and the power that you have the church has been living too long under the torment of a puff of a defeated enemy of a defeated coward who was defeated at Calvary and his power was stripped from him and power has been given to you as a son or daughter of God brother Branham says I don't care how weak you think you are and how so you think you are in the body of Christ even if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet you still have every devil in hell underneath you I say rise up today and recognize your position in Jesus take back what God Satan his stole from you you know Satan's a thief that's what he is he was defeated and lost his power but what he does is this he's a thief Jesus says he's a thief he steals kills and destroys you know the thief a thief takes other people's property something that doesn't belong to him a thief doesn't come in broad daylight he doesn't come in the middle of the day a thief comes he doesn't come in the broad they liked and announced that he's there but he comes when you're asleep and you're not watching and you're tired you know we had a thief break into our neighborhood in a neighborhood that we've moved from now lived in not in decent nice neighborhood nothing you know a no kind of major crime in it had my car broken into I think three times left I never locked my car because I don't ever leave anything in it that's valuable the only thing I got out to my car that morning and I I went to work and went in and got in my car and it was just a mess everything everywhere my DVDs my might my CDs all oh my oh my I had maybe thirty cents in pennies it was just stretched everywhere and I thought man Rachel got in here and she was looking for something messed my car up I called her waited for her to wake up I said honey what did you do to my car she said I was calling you to ask the same question what did you do to my car [Laughter] the thief had went in mine rummage through it went into hers rummage through and destroyed both of them suddenly it dawned on us there's been a thief he broke into I think they I think he broke into 47 Kars 47 or it was almost 50 broke into people's vehicle I talked to the investigator who was looking into it trying to find the thief he said you know this is a thief of opportunity I said what does that mean he said well he's not someone who wants to confront anyone he doesn't want a confrontation with you he's a thief of opportunity he says most likely he's walked through this neighborhood in the middle of the day you've probably seen him multiple times said really he said oh I'm sure of it I'm sure he said if someone has security video or footage of him we probably find him he said because this kind of thief goes in the middle of the day walks up and down the road waves to you says hello and he watches you he watches and patterns you he watches when do you leave when are you at home when are you at church in fact one of the families who was broken into it was while they were at church he came in and stole everything that they had stole their big 68 inch plasma TV I thought was gonna be disappointed if he comes into my house [Laughter] ain't nothing to take in the spot of the TV except the Hoffmans head of Christ you could have it you might need it he said he's a thief of opportunity comes in and he takes he watches and he waits he watches for you to let your guard down he tries to make you comfortable with him felt really he says yeah he's probably been in the car you know canvass in this neighborhood watching your schedule when do you go to work when is your wife go to the grocery store when he home when your kids go here go to school and he waits for his chance and his opportunity and he takes the thief comes when you're not focused when you're sleeping and you're tired and Satan robs people most when they become spiritually tired and unfocused this is exactly what Jesus was saying what the scripture says when it says be vigilant be sober because your adversary is like a lion going to and fro seeking whom he may devour so be sober be sober be clear be alerted be vigilant be on guard be spiritual don't get laughs don't get loose because the minute you get sleepy Satan comes and Rob's you blind Satan comes and Rob's you blind the Lord begin to just deal with me on a very personal level when he gave me this inspiration and begin to tell I begin to see this that the devil had robbed me and stolen things for me robbed me of my spiritual health robbed me of my spiritual appetite because that's what he is he's a robber he's a thief he wants to kill he wants to steal and he wants to destroy Satan hates marriage you know why he hates marriage because it's a covenant it's a bond and a real god-given bond brings unity and when you have marriages and families that are unified guess what you have a church that is unified and when you have families that are in discord and disunity of the time church problems are a result of family problem he wants to steal he wants to kill and he wants to destroy a thief doesn't come and announce that he's there but it comes when you're unfocused and once he stolen from you he doesn't call you in another state when you're out of town he doesn't call you and say hey Nana Nana boo boo I stole your iPad and now I stole your laptop he doesn't even tell you in fact he hopes you don't notice that it's missing the thief's job is to leave quietly - not even to cover his tracks to show no sign of a disturbance and suddenly you look around one day and you go hey where'd that go I bought a very expensive for me it was very expensive probably close to $500 just one tool I'll need it for one job wasn't gonna use it much and because of that I put that tool in a spot didn't think anybody would ever take didn't need the tool again for a really long time one day would just happen to be thinking about it and and and and thought you know where where is that thing huh I where did I put that started looking through my garage looking through my stuff called one of my guys and said hey is that on the truck no no you know I haven't haven't seen that yet well how long did you buy that said you know it's been been probably a year and a half or so been a long time started looking everywhere finally remember where it was and realized it was stolen and all that time I had no idea it was even missing until I needed it Samson didn't realize his strength was gone until he needed it he didn't know he had given something away and the Bible says and he knew not that the Spirit of the Lord had departed him he shook himself and said I'll go out as every other time and he knew not Satan had stolen something from him and Satan comes and he takes things and he Rob's things from our life and then one day we look around and we say hey hold on a minute where does that go you know Satan steals our prayers steals our prayer life jesus said as we quoted last hour first Thessalonians says we code it last night Paul says see pray without ceasing yet Satan will bring every kind of distraction and every kind of shiny thing to keep you unfocused and to keep you distracted this age we live in is full of distractions he takes things in our life that are not sinful and he makes them sinful he takes things that you may have Liberty to do you know the Apostle Paul said something that just struck me and just a profound waste not not left me in first Corinthians brother if you put that up that'd be great in 1st Corinthians chapter 6 I don't know how quick you can do that but I wanted I wanted to show this first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 12 you can turn if you have your Bible first Corinthians notice this chapter 6 verse 12 all things all things everything all things are lawful to me in other words I'm allowed to do all things I have Liberty in Christ but not all things are profitable now he's gonna change thoughts he's gonna give us a second thought notice this all things are lawful for me or I'm allowed to do everything but but but I will not be brought under the power of don't that to seek in for mine all things are lawful Paul says I could do I have Liberty in Christ I'm set free from the bondage of the law all things are lawful but Paul says but I will not allow anything in my life to have such a place in my life that it takes control over me and there are some things in your life brothers and there are certain things in your life sisters and young people there are certain things that you can do that you say there's nothing wrong with them there's nothing they're not sinful in and of themselves but what the devil wants to do he's a thief and he's a robber he wants to take that harmless thing and wrap you up and wrap you up and put you on a routine to where you got to do it every day at the same time every week on a routine and he robs you of time with your children he robs you of time with your family he robs you of time in the house of God he robs you of time in your prayer closet all things are lawful but not all nothing will have the power over me you take activities I don't care what it is harmless things recreational things that brothers do you take a sport that maybe you like to play but let that sport suddenly have power over you and you'll notice one day you'll look around you'll look around one day and go hey where'd my prayer life go hey why am I getting upset over that I never that never bothered me before and suddenly your temper flares up you don't know why you're angry all the time and right on your surface you're just ready to explode I think well I'm saved I'm born again I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and things that never used to trip you up before now suddenly you start to struggle with my preaching anybody today [Applause] hallelujah suddenly you look around one day and you realize those things that were harmless and nothing wrong with them suddenly you realize they have pallor I'm gonna close give me just a minute he stills and he Rob's and he takes he stills love he steals faith he kills slowly slowly spiritual death comes one compromise at a time one time you compromise on one little thing and then the next time it's easier and it's bigger and it's bigger and it's bigger he's a thief he comes to steal kill and destroy he steals tithes do you know that God said when you don't pay tithes and offerings you are robbing God and suddenly you find people that have faithfully paid ties for years and suddenly something comes in their life and just stops look around and go how long has it been since I gave an offering how long has it been since I gave ties to the Lord that's not your money it's the Lord's you think these things don't these little things don't matter as we learned last night they matter it's not just the Jericho's that God wants you to conquer he wants you to also have victory over the little puny ai's in your life he stills love mothers from huh from from children fathers from children he steals time he's a Stiller and a robber of time he fills your life with stuff to rob you of your children's childhood and suddenly you look back one day and you go wow they're gone and you realize your entire life was robbed and built with stuff that doesn't really matter you see Satan knows that he can't get you from your salvation he knows he can't he can't he can't rob you of your Redemption so what does he do he takes the quality of your life as a believer in Jesus Christ and he tries to destroy because he's a destroyer he kills by addictions he takes little things in our life things that are harmless and we become addicted to him the where we have to have them at the same time every time every day he's a thief he's a robber he's a destroyer and he's taken and he's robbed and he stole and I've got a message for today devil you've been stealing for too long and today you've been exposed today devil you've been exposed for who you are you thought that you could take for me my entire life but God said I god gave me a message and I said Lord I feel like I've been robbed I feel like I've been stalled what can I do and the Lord said you've got to go back to the enemy's camp and you've got to take back what the devil stole from you you've got to take back what the devil is taken from your family and from your from your church and from your mind and you've got to say today Lord you say how am I gonna do it is it just gonna suddenly come am I just gonna pray a prayer and God's just gonna give it back to me God said no you've got to buckle up you've got to stand up you've got to be willing to fight you've got to be willing to go into Canaan and say I'm coming back devil I'm here to take everything that you've stolen from me hallelujah you've got to take back what the devil stole from you you've got to stop being pushed around Shamgar got sick and tired of being robbed and being stolen from every single year if the Philistines would come he was just a simple little farmer just trying to live his life Philistines would come and take his crops take everything he worked for and his family would huddle up no doubt hide it under the bed hide it in the storm cellar hide it in the closet Shh don't say anything don't maybe that maybe they'll know that we're here and they'll destroy us just let them take it but one day timber said I'm tired and I'm sick and tired of just letting him take it I'm sick and tired of letting the devil rob me and still for me and pillage me and take everything that I've worked for for my family and for my children he got sick and tired of seeing a starving wife and starving children and cellars and cabinets that were empty so Shamgar picked up an ox coat wasn't a sword it wasn't his spear it was a farmer's plow a piece of equipment and God said take what's in your hand Shamgar you don't need to wait on some kind of sword or some kind of special sermon or some kind of super preacher you don't need to wait on some kind of super faith or some kind of supervision oh you've got to do its take what I've already given you go to the enemy's camp and take back what he's stolen from you oh how many people are here today just say I'm gonna take back what the devil stolen for me I'm gonna take back my property that God has given me Oh stand to your feet together I'm not gonna be pushed around musicians I'm not gonna be pushed around anymore I'm not gonna be a punching bag anymore I'm not gonna be pushed around had a young man come after I preached this sermon only one other time at our church just a week or so ago a young man whose family had going through horrible times and a mother and father just in and it looks like unless the Lord does something miraculous the family's gonna lose break up in and into in divorce unless God moves horrible situation devil just attacking this family attacking his home attacking his mother attacking his father attacking his mother with drugs and and and and all kinds of things life is just a total mess and every time I see that young man come to church I say thank you Lord for a miracle because it's a miracle he has any desire whatsoever to be in the house of God it's a miracle that he has any any desire at all and he sits there with his head down and every service he just sits there with his head like this watching you know what though no one criticizes him in know what that boys going through and every service he slumped over and he's got his head his head in his hands last Sunday I do two Sundays ago preach this message and I looked over and as I was preaching he suddenly took his head out of his hands and he started looking up watching had his eyes connected with me before I knew it he was sitting up in his chair before I knew it he had his arms like this I looked over one time and he was raised in his hands tears was coming down he came to the altar and he said I'm sick and tired of getting pushed around I'm tired of being on the run and on defense always with the devil I'm today want to take my sword and I want to take back what he's stolen from me hallelujah and God gave him victory because he realized Satan is a thief he's a robber he's a destroyer and you don't have to live under the authority and the power of the devil any longer you've been given authority and power you've got to be willing to lay hold hold the kingdom of God suffereth violence but the violent take it by force hallelujah preach this sermon and my dog my wife's is my wife and children's to hook call him that

alive family not no one to do my wife said you know what after that sermon you preached me and the children laid our hands on that dog and said we don't accept this devil we've been given Authority I

and they won't harm them and we've been given Authority and I curse this demon in Jesus name the very next morning the dog was running through the yard face was completely normal you would have never known anything had happened why because she took authority over the devil and the devil had to run cuz he's just a bluff he's just a liar and he's a liar in your life and all you've got to say to Satan I cursed up work and the power you have over my life I curse your works I curse the works of the Devourer in my marriage I curse the works of the Devourer in my children if you've got unsaved children curse the devil in Jesus name and say God you've given me authority and power [Applause] hallelujah by your heads with me if you could play something brothers we've been given authority and power over the devil all you got to do is recognize your position in Jesus recognize the authority and the power you have to take back your god-given property how many here could say today Satan I've looked around my garage I've looked around my house and I've seen that you've taken some things I didn't even realize we're missing I've looked around and realized you've been coming when maybe I was sleepy and tired and unfocused and I've looked Satan I've seen you've stolen a few things and you might have thought I was gonna be content just to let you have them you might have thought I was gonna be content just to go oh well I guess he's got him but something in me says Satan I'm coming to your territory I'm marching back into the enemy's camp and I'm here to claim what's mine I'm here to take what back what's mine take your hands your filthy hands off of God's property Oh Lord Jesus you see these hands that are up everywhere we're here to claim what's ours Lord he's a thief he's a

Lord you very you've placed Authority and power and every child of God every son or daughter of God Lord and I'm the Lord as I remember the scripture that we read in our opening that you looked at your disciples and said up to this day you've not even asked anything in my name and you said ask asked I want you to ask or maybe we could look around and see our troubles and our problems and may we
