[28:01] that you love me
[28:15] [Music]
[28:31] away
[28:34] no one knew
[28:36] how alone i was feeling
[28:42] and the emptiness
[28:44] i tried so hard to hide
[28:49] though i laughed
[28:51] and said my life was fine without you
[28:57] i was covering up the secret tears i
[29:01] cried
[29:02] [Applause]
[29:04] then one day
[29:06] someone told me of your mercy
[29:12] and the love you showed on a hill called
[29:16] calvary
[29:19] there you died
[29:21] and purchased my salvation
[29:27] when you broke
[29:32] [Applause]
[29:37] since you love me
[29:50] [Applause]
[29:50] [Music]
[30:06] i watched
[30:15] that you love me
[30:25] [Music]
[30:34] is
[30:41] [Music]
[30:51] [Applause]
[30:55] nobody but jesus could do that
[30:58] no matter how much anybody else would
[31:00] love you and care for you
[31:02] there's only one that could pay this
[31:04] supreme price
[31:06] let's turn today if you would in the
[31:07] book of romans chapter 6 verse 12
[31:10] so i'm happy to see each one of you here
[31:12] today in the house of the lord and
[31:14] as brother keith mentioned earlier we
[31:16] certainly miss those that aren't here
[31:19] some that are sick and some that are
[31:21] still just being very precautious
[31:23] because of the covet and all that and we
[31:25] understand that we certainly pray god
[31:27] will
[31:28] let this thing
[31:30] go through and pass away from us don't
[31:32] we amen
[31:33] romans chapter 6
[31:35] verse 12.
[31:37] what a great um
[31:40] a great passage of scriptures that we
[31:42] want to look at today
[31:45] the marvel of the mystery of the new
[31:47] birth and what it does for us is so
[31:50] wonderful
[31:51] and so amazing
[31:54] but i find it a marvel on the other side
[31:57] what it leaves
[31:59] undone
[32:00] waiting for
[32:02] the adoption of the body
[32:05] as marvelous as the new birth is and
[32:07] what it does
[32:09] the marvel of what it leaves undone
[32:12] to me is quite phenomenal as well
[32:15] romans chapter 6 verse 12
[32:19] let not sin
[32:21] therefore reign
[32:23] in your mortal
[32:24] body
[32:27] now
[32:28] i'm sure we believe together that this
[32:30] is not speaking to sinners
[32:33] there's no way this passage could be
[32:35] written to sinners
[32:37] they would not have the ability to do
[32:40] this so it's speaking to someone
[32:43] who has received a new power a new life
[32:47] let not sin therefore reign
[32:50] in your mortal body
[32:52] that ye should obey it
[32:55] in the lust thereof
[32:57] neither yield
[32:59] ye
[33:00] your members
[33:02] as instruments
[33:04] of unrighteousness
[33:06] unto sin
[33:07] so it separates you
[33:09] from your members which can be
[33:11] instruments
[33:13] but yield yourselves
[33:15] unto god
[33:17] as those
[33:18] that are alive
[33:20] from the dead
[33:22] ah so you see this proves we're talking
[33:24] about folks that have a new birth
[33:26] this can't be a sinner sinners are not
[33:29] alive from the dead
[33:30] and your members
[33:32] as instruments
[33:34] of
[33:35] righteousness
[33:37] unto god
[33:39] for sin shall not
[33:42] shall
[33:43] not
[33:45] have dominion
[33:46] over you
[33:48] well i want to do better i want to do
[33:51] better but i can't help it
[33:53] the devil made me do it
[33:56] i can't help it i ain't got no power
[33:57] over myself you need the new birth
[34:01] the new birth empowers us to where sin
[34:04] will not not possibly
[34:07] perhaps
[34:08] you see friends if folks read romans 7
[34:12] in the light of romans 6
[34:15] a lot of the mysterious thing about
[34:17] romans 7 will totally be dissolved but
[34:21] whenever people are scared to death of
[34:22] romans 7 they think somehow it's a
[34:24] baptist chapter in the bible it's not a
[34:27] baptist chapter it's the holy word of
[34:29] god
[34:30] but when we read romans 7 through this
[34:32] understanding of romans 6
[34:34] and to be able to separate it for sin
[34:36] shall not have dominion over you for ye
[34:40] are not under the law
[34:42] but under
[34:44] grace aren't you grateful for that today
[34:47] i made a lot to be remembered today in
[34:48] prayer
[34:50] spourheads if you would
[34:53] heavenly father we love you today
[34:56] lord i want to say how thankful i am
[34:58] that
[34:59] we're able to gather together again
[35:02] i realize not all of us lord some are
[35:05] still sick some are
[35:07] because of their jobs and work and
[35:10] because of their health they consider it
[35:13] lord still such a risk to get out in
[35:15] public or maybe
[35:17] mother and father that they're with or
[35:20] children or whatever more
[35:22] but we pray father that should be
[35:24] mindful of them
[35:26] lord as i look across the congregation
[35:28] today there are faces that i don't see
[35:31] and i pray that you'd be with them today
[35:35] lord jesus may you comfort them and help
[35:37] them
[35:38] may this thing pass from us lord that we
[35:41] can come back to a state of normalcy
[35:44] we're grateful lord that we're not
[35:46] having to be restricted to streaming
[35:49] totally that we're able to meet together
[35:53] father you see
[35:54] lord in our state that in the out in the
[35:58] rural areas it's on the increase
[36:01] or discovered in so much that
[36:03] the white house
[36:05] it issued that the state of tennessee
[36:07] start requiring a mandate
[36:10] of mass we pray father
[36:12] that you'd keep this evil from us lord
[36:15] lord we enjoy church we enjoy our lives
[36:18] and the things that we have to do
[36:21] lord how can we assemble ourselves
[36:23] together if we're sick
[36:25] and won't let us come together but we
[36:27] pray that you'd be mindful of us lord
[36:30] not only of this covid thing father but
[36:32] other sicknesses and diseases that
[36:34] people are dealing with and depression
[36:37] and sadness and all these things may the
[36:40] spirit of god i pray move for your
[36:42] children today
[36:43] speak to us father god as only you can
[36:46] do today from your word in the name of
[36:49] the lord jesus and the saints said
[36:52] god bless you may be seated
[36:55] turn with me if you would to galatians
[36:58] chapter four
[37:00] and let's read again of this uh
[37:03] allegory
[37:04] of
[37:06] ishmael and isaac
[37:09] for it is written that abraham
[37:12] had two sons
[37:15] the one
[37:16] by a bond maid the other
[37:19] by a free woman
[37:21] but he who was of the bondmaid
[37:24] was born
[37:27] after the flesh
[37:29] but he
[37:30] of the free woman
[37:32] was by promise
[37:35] now does this mean that isaac was not
[37:38] born by sex desire
[37:40] no
[37:41] no he was still born by sex desire
[37:44] but it was a miraculous
[37:46] birth
[37:48] notice this that paul
[37:50] in verse 24 he said which things are
[37:54] an allegory
[37:56] for these are the two covenants
[37:59] the one from the mount sinai which
[38:02] generous to bondage which is agar
[38:07] now we brethren as isaac was
[38:10] are the children of
[38:12] promise
[38:14] notice now he wants to separate
[38:16] even in the new testament
[38:18] that there are
[38:19] two categories of people
[38:22] by now of course the ishmaelites the
[38:25] midianites the shia bikes all these
[38:28] other hagarites hagarines
[38:30] all of these different ones were very
[38:32] noted among the jews they had battled
[38:36] them for many years
[38:38] and it was a common knowledge among them
[38:42] that these other sons of abraham had
[38:46] caused such
[38:47] trouble
[38:48] for the promised sea
[38:50] but it goes beyond isaac and ishmael now
[38:55] we're talking about a new verse we're
[38:57] talking about a new genos a new
[39:01] generation
[39:02] so how is it that there are still two
[39:05] covenants
[39:06] there are two
[39:08] mountains that we look to one is sinai
[39:12] and the other is jerusalem one is agar
[39:16] which is the new testament term for
[39:19] hagar
[39:20] and one is under another woman how can
[39:24] there be
[39:25] this brought over under grace if grace
[39:28] applies to every individual in the same
[39:32] measure
[39:33] if grace is given exactly the grace of
[39:37] forgiveness of sin the grace of
[39:39] sanctification
[39:40] the grace of a new life the grace of the
[39:44] token the grace of rapturing faith is
[39:47] given to every individual on the same
[39:51] measure how can there be
[39:53] two covenants in the new testament
[39:56] how can there be a church natural and a
[39:59] church spiritual if both of them are
[40:02] under the same measure
[40:04] of the grace of god
[40:06] now you see this doctrine of this was
[40:10] brought in after the new testament that
[40:12] there was no difference between the
[40:15] bride and the church but now watch this
[40:17] man who is able to separate law from
[40:21] grace and he's going to separate the
[40:24] children of the bondwoman from the
[40:27] children of the free woman he's going to
[40:30] separate agar from
[40:33] sarah he's going to separate church
[40:36] natural from church spiritual and he's
[40:39] also going to go a little deeper than
[40:42] that and he's going to bring in hebrews
[40:45] 4 12. and he's going to say that the
[40:48] word is a discerner of the salts and the
[40:52] intents of the heart the dividing of
[40:55] sunder that would separate the spirit
[40:58] and the soul
[41:00] from the moral and the joints so the
[41:03] separation friends it's not just us
[41:06] separating from the world out here well
[41:09] we don't drink no more and we don't
[41:12] smoke no more and we don't go to bars
[41:14] and we don't go to dances i thank god
[41:18] i'm separated from the world
[41:20] you're just on your way to the final
[41:22] separation which is you separating from
[41:26] yourself
[41:28] cigarettes is not your greatest enemy
[41:31] marijuana heroin drinking that's not
[41:34] your greatest enemy your greatest enemy
[41:37] is yourself
[41:38] and you'll fight that until the last day
[41:41] of your humanity on this earth
[41:44] it's not something like the new burst
[41:47] when the nature is eradicated forever
[41:50] that you'll never have to deal with that
[41:53] old nature again
[41:55] the body is still left in this image of
[41:58] neutrality it bears the image of the
[42:02] beast
[42:03] within it contains the potential to
[42:07] serve god was in it is the potential to
[42:11] yield its members as instruments of
[42:14] great truth and righteousness and great
[42:18] acts and great deeds which god requires
[42:21] us to do but on the other hand in this
[42:25] body is also an unregenerate untamed
[42:30] nature
[42:31] which is that which we were born with we
[42:34] were separated by spiritual death from
[42:38] our first husband which had the rule
[42:40] over us which was the nature from the
[42:43] soul but alas the verse of the soul
[42:47] does not override or bring into total
[42:51] submission and control by birth the
[42:54] fleshlight
[42:56] but it leaves it in the state by which
[42:59] it is a constant consequence of a war
[43:03] that is going on between you the body
[43:07] and you the soul
[43:10] now what this how paul runs his parallel
[43:13] so then brethren we are not children of
[43:17] the bondwoman but of the free now i find
[43:20] this amazing we're going to read here in
[43:22] genesis chapter 16 verse
[43:25] and we have the instance of abram and
[43:29] syria
[43:31] and we have god speaking to abram along
[43:34] the way and we have abram's response in
[43:37] different facets of his journey but
[43:40] these that we're going to read today are
[43:42] the very first written
[43:45] words of sarah syria that make scripture
[43:50] now i want you to notice the very first
[43:52] words that are recorded of syria in
[43:56] scripture
[43:58] they are not words of faith
[44:00] they are not words really of great
[44:03] understanding
[44:04] they are words that typify
[44:07] how that even an elect person
[44:10] that can lean to their flesh
[44:13] can say things that are so contrary to
[44:16] god's will
[44:18] now notice these are the very first
[44:20] words of syria that are written in the
[44:22] bible now sarai abram's wife bear him no
[44:27] children and she had a handmaid
[44:31] an egyptian whose name
[44:34] was hagar
[44:35] and sarai said unto abram behold now the
[44:40] lord has restrained me
[44:43] from bearing
[44:45] i praise thee go in unto my maid
[44:49] it may be that i
[44:51] may obtain children by her
[44:54] notice now what his response is
[44:57] and abram hearkened
[45:00] unto the voice
[45:02] of syria
[45:04] now during this time in the law of the
[45:07] land which is still observable in the
[45:11] hirian text which is found many many
[45:13] years ago written i've told you about it
[45:15] before on a cuneiform that was written
[45:18] in a round cylinder and they wrote
[45:21] different transactions of property and
[45:24] laws and things that was there so
[45:26] whenever a woman lived in this part of
[45:30] the world at that time she could have a
[45:32] slave or many slaves
[45:34] and it would be called a bond made now
[45:37] that woman was actually the property of
[45:41] the mistress
[45:42] so she could send her
[45:45] mistress her bondsmate into her husband
[45:49] if she was barren what sarai was asking
[45:52] for was perfectly legal by the law of
[45:56] the land
[45:57] but it was not the promise of god
[46:01] now i understand that god up to this
[46:04] stage of the revelation had not included
[46:08] syria by name
[46:10] in the program
[46:12] god had not told abram that syria would
[46:16] be the one to bring it
[46:18] but abram was so
[46:21] my he had such a desire in his heart to
[46:24] be a father never remember he's 75 you
[46:27] know plus now whenever this happens and
[46:30] sarah seemingly is too old to bear
[46:34] no signs of life at all
[46:36] and no doubt both of them are so anxious
[46:39] for the promise of god to come to pass
[46:43] in their life
[46:44] and god doesn't always make everything
[46:47] quite clear but god will say sometimes
[46:51] generalities and god will leave the
[46:54] particulars out now the particulars are
[46:57] many times what gets us in trouble it's
[47:00] the small fine print
[47:03] it's that which we really don't think
[47:05] matters much and god does that many
[47:08] times in order to try his people to see
[47:11] what they will do with that which is
[47:14] unwritten you see that's why there's
[47:16] many things that's even left in the
[47:18] message of the hour that are unwritten
[47:21] and unsaid and people are still wanting
[47:25] the same thing today so they will take
[47:27] tablecloth quotes well brother branham
[47:30] told my grandpa this and my great
[47:31] grandfather and i'm not going to dispute
[47:34] any of those sort of things but brother
[47:35] man told us to stay stable thoughts on
[47:37] the tapes
[47:39] praise the lord but yet there are many
[47:42] times that people want to bring god's
[47:44] word to pass and it wasn't said but it
[47:47] was almost said you can almost read it
[47:51] into that or you could almost make it
[47:54] say that well i don't want to just
[47:56] almost make it say it i want to see
[47:59] where it's said and if it's not said to
[48:02] be honest with you i'm not interested in
[48:03] wasting my time and spend a lot of time
[48:06] trying to study it i i have enough to be
[48:08] able to study what's already been
[48:10] written and been said but notice that
[48:12] god never by name identified sarai in
[48:17] the revelation so sariah looks at
[48:20] herself now notice what she does she
[48:23] looks at herself and she identifies i'm
[48:26] old the milk veins are dried up i've got
[48:29] this issue that one that one that one
[48:31] there's no way that i can be able to be
[48:34] a mother but apparently abram has still
[48:37] got life in him so then she looks at
[48:41] herself she looks at abram and she looks
[48:45] at hagar now the problem tells us she
[48:48] was a beautiful
[48:50] younger egyptian woman
[48:53] now the way the hurian law was set up
[48:56] that even though this handmaid would be
[48:59] able to go into the the wife's husband
[49:02] and she would conceive of him
[49:04] according to the hirian law
[49:07] actually that child that would be
[49:09] conceived from that union would not
[49:11] belong to the bonds made
[49:14] it would actually belong to the wife
[49:16] because the handmaid was the property of
[49:20] the wife how cruel slavery was
[49:23] but yet because this was a slave then
[49:26] whatever she brought forth whatever she
[49:29] had actually belonged to the mistress
[49:32] now abraham and at this stage abram no
[49:36] doubt had a great desire to see sarai
[49:40] included in the promise but he didn't
[49:42] really know yet because god hadn't said
[49:45] but i want you to notice the fault on
[49:48] abram's part
[49:50] that abram never consulted the lord
[49:54] about this
[49:55] so instead of abram getting along with
[49:58] god
[49:59] and going to find out now father you've
[50:02] not said if this is the right way or not
[50:05] but serie wants me to go into this young
[50:08] woman and she thinks maybe that you
[50:12] will use this egyptian and complete your
[50:15] promise through that let me tell you
[50:18] right now god don't really need our
[50:19] thinking
[50:21] god don't need our two cents keep it
[50:23] yourself your flat broke the way it is
[50:25] as far as morality and all the things
[50:27] around us come on that's right well we
[50:29] we need everything that god's given us
[50:32] so abram enters into this proposal
[50:36] without actually asking god but yet you
[50:40] can look at it from his point of view
[50:42] that looking at himself knowing that he
[50:45] had only a little more time physically
[50:47] that the time for his wife was already
[50:50] gone here is a young maid that possibly
[50:52] would be fertile and if he would be able
[50:55] to sow his seed in her then this might
[50:58] be the way that god would do it i mean
[51:00] god didn't say he wouldn't do that but
[51:03] the catch is god didn't say that he
[51:05] would
[51:06] now looking at a human this is where we
[51:08] get sometimes that we are calm and a
[51:11] dilemma that we don't know what to do
[51:14] now it looks like this might be the
[51:16] right way but it also looks like this
[51:19] could be the right way and sometimes
[51:22] you'll find it's not always written
[51:24] which one is
[51:26] now you know that as well as i do that
[51:28] god doesn't give us the book of our life
[51:31] and say tomorrow when we get up we'll
[51:33] open it up on monday and it's like
[51:34] you're already already written so you go
[51:37] down through the oil at nine o'clock
[51:38] watch this at 10 o'clock do that at 11
[51:40] o'clock do this and now you're going to
[51:42] come up against this choice today but
[51:44] that's all right don't worry about
[51:45] praying about it don't worry about
[51:47] running it through the word i've already
[51:48] got it wrote down here so when that
[51:50] comes then go ahead and make this
[51:51] decision but how cold and indifferent
[51:54] our walk with god will truly be so god
[51:58] doesn't give us the book of our life and
[52:00] all the choices and all the pitfalls and
[52:02] things that are going to be there and
[52:04] god sent out watch this and watch this
[52:06] and don't do this and do that and do
[52:08] that but instead god gives us great
[52:11] things about our life and then he gives
[52:13] us the holy ghost which is that
[52:15] person-dwelling presence and it will
[52:17] give us unctions and it will give us
[52:19] leadings and it will actually produce
[52:22] feelings you all know what i'm talking
[52:23] about that you feel in your heart don't
[52:25] go that way don't do this and there's
[52:27] many times that as humans we tend to
[52:30] override that
[52:32] oh all the rest of you are innocent but
[52:34] me i don't believe that
[52:36] and yet god will put that there for our
[52:40] benefit and yet abram will now whenever
[52:43] he's faced with this decision it must
[52:46] have looked right to him it must have
[52:49] sounds sensible now we're certainly not
[52:51] going to make an infidel or an
[52:53] unbeliever out of abram but let's make
[52:55] him a human being like all the rest of
[52:58] us because we bleached out the lives of
[53:01] these prophets we've bleached out the
[53:03] sages of the bible and we've actually
[53:05] taken away from them their humanity
[53:07] that's one reason folks have gotten so
[53:09] mad at me over the years of preaching
[53:11] that brother branham was a man he was
[53:13] not a god but he was a man he was born
[53:16] lost he needed to be justified
[53:19] sanctified and filled with the holy
[53:21] ghost brother branham still made
[53:23] mistakes till his life ended on this
[53:25] earth
[53:26] why because he was a human being
[53:28] that's right but yet the people of the
[53:30] message don't want to hear that no more
[53:32] than probably some of the jews wanted to
[53:34] hear that abram made a terrible choice
[53:36] but i want to tell you here today abram
[53:38] made a terrible choice he listened to
[53:42] his wife and sitter praying and seeking
[53:44] the counsel of god no doubt now not not
[53:47] to be rebellious and not to be stubborn
[53:50] against god's will but because the will
[53:52] was just not made plain and instead of
[53:55] him having that personal communion with
[53:57] god about this situation was eagerness
[54:01] and with great desire let me tell you
[54:02] something fran one of the greatest
[54:04] battles you and i will ever have in this
[54:06] life is us trying to make our ishmael
[54:11] the spiritual ruler of our walk with god
[54:15] you see our ishmael will lead us to the
[54:19] kebab
[54:20] every time
[54:22] he will point us toward the east toward
[54:26] mecca he will point us towards something
[54:30] that we can do in our flesh something
[54:32] that we can reason something well it
[54:34] just makes sense it just makes sense
[54:37] sometimes faith don't make sense
[54:40] you know that's right now watch what
[54:42] what's going to come out of this in
[54:44] verse 2 and sarah said unto abram behold
[54:47] now the lord hath restrained me from
[54:50] bearing i praise he go into my maid it
[54:54] may be that i may obtain children by her
[54:59] i found this so amazing this morning
[55:01] when i was looking at this word in the
[55:04] hebrew it is bonaire and it means to
[55:08] build to establish cause to continue
[55:12] build a house or establish a family now
[55:16] the idea of this word is that the
[55:19] children actually is what builds the
[55:23] house because it gives a lasting
[55:26] extension of the merging together of the
[55:30] man and the woman's chromosomes so it is
[55:33] a mixing together actually they didn't
[55:35] have houses or whenever abram really as
[55:38] far as what he lived him but he lived in
[55:40] a tent so the word that we used for
[55:42] house actually was not addressing a
[55:45] place that they resided but they resided
[55:48] in a tent which was not a permanent
[55:50] dwelling but the word they used for
[55:53] house was bonnard which was the
[55:56] establishing of that that house itself
[55:59] which was the posterity of children
[56:02] which is of course what david said in
[56:03] psalms 127 so the children were a
[56:06] blessing from the lord so sarah is not
[56:09] just wanting a child but it's that she's
[56:13] saying that god will establish the house
[56:17] of abraham
[56:19] through this egyptian
[56:21] instead of me she's wanting more than a
[56:25] baby she's looking for the establishment
[56:29] of the house of god or may i say so you
[56:31] can understand it the church
[56:35] so the house of god
[56:38] would be established by women
[56:41] denominations
[56:42] saying we
[56:44] are the bride
[56:46] god come into us
[56:49] and father our children
[56:52] they don't line up with your word they
[56:53] don't believe what you said
[56:55] but establish your kingdom
[56:58] through us
[56:59] and we will be your house
[57:03] god didn't do it then god won't do it
[57:05] now
[57:07] now it was actually until many hundreds
[57:10] of years later that they started using
[57:13] the word house to represent a building
[57:17] where people live but prior to this it
[57:20] was the extension of the man's life so
[57:24] sarah is saying to abram look i cannot
[57:27] help you build your house
[57:30] i cannot bear your life
[57:33] i cannot reproduce your dreams
[57:38] i cannot help you extend your house your
[57:42] banana
[57:44] but this worldly woman can
[57:47] [Music]
[57:50] so you might need a little bit of
[57:52] pentecost with a little bit of methodist
[57:54] with a little bit of baptist to give the
[57:56] bride revival the bride don't need no
[57:57] methodist mixture and no pentecostal
[58:00] mixture we've got enough word to have
[58:02] our own revival and we'll just pray and
[58:04] ask god to give it to us
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:07] so the children then by the woman was
[58:10] bestowed this is the way that it would
[58:12] be that the woman uh the handmaid would
[58:15] give birth to a child or children and
[58:18] then she would bestow them upon the
[58:20] mistress and she would actually raise
[58:22] them and wean them into that spot then
[58:24] she would relinquish her rights now
[58:27] remember the prophet runs this parallel
[58:29] whenever he preaches seed is not heir
[58:31] with a shot and he said this is what
[58:34] lucer done which is what hagar done when
[58:37] hagar give up her child to another
[58:41] woman's bosom
[58:42] and then the prophet runs that allegory
[58:45] that parallel side beside and he said
[58:47] that luther gave up his son and he
[58:51] called his son's name justification
[58:54] notice then the offspring or the progeny
[58:57] out of the loosened revival notice
[58:59] that's what he said in february 1965 and
[59:02] he called justification a son oh my so
[59:07] justification was the son of the lucerne
[59:10] move and then what happened the lucerne
[59:13] denomination took that son
[59:16] and claimed that son as their own so
[59:19] loser raised that son by faith when god
[59:22] gave him the revelation that just shall
[59:24] live by faith and then what did they do
[59:27] they relinquished that son over to a
[59:30] denomination called lutherans today show
[59:32] me a revival in any lutheran church
[59:35] so what did they do then they took that
[59:38] son and they said god will build a house
[59:42] through us
[59:43] we are the lucerne denomination and god
[59:47] will establish his house his kingdom
[59:50] through us and what did god do god left
[59:52] him sitting right there and went right
[59:54] on
[59:55] what did wesley do wesley gave up his
[59:58] child to them western denomination well
[1:00:01] i wish somebody would preach with me
[1:00:02] this morning what did pentecost do gave
[1:00:05] up their child to the pentecostal
[1:00:07] organization can i bring her on down
[1:00:10] home once a lot of the message folks
[1:00:12] done they've let the spirit of
[1:00:13] organization come into the message and
[1:00:16] they've raised up a seven thunder woman
[1:00:19] a perugia woman a tape woman a returned
[1:00:22] woman and they said we're going to build
[1:00:24] up the house of god no you're not not
[1:00:27] with no denominational prostitute spirit
[1:00:30] on you yay you've got to be a virgin
[1:00:32] unto christ out of the virgin-born bride
[1:00:36] will god produce hallelujah that
[1:00:40] fulfilled word to jesus christ and if we
[1:00:44] at happy valley church ever get under
[1:00:46] that old denominational thing god will
[1:00:49] do us the same way he will walk right
[1:00:52] off and leave us oh but i don't want him
[1:00:54] to walk off to you i don't want him to
[1:00:57] leave us here we can't build his house
[1:01:00] we cannot do it without him we need him
[1:01:03] every hour we need him every day we need
[1:01:07] him every service we need him to live we
[1:01:11] need him to breathe we need him with all
[1:01:14] of our being
[1:01:26] so in the hebrew
[1:01:29] she's saying i
[1:01:31] will be built up
[1:01:34] through her
[1:01:38] what's amazing is this is exactly the
[1:01:40] same word
[1:01:42] that we find
[1:01:44] in the land of babel
[1:01:47] come
[1:01:48] let us build ourselves
[1:01:51] a city
[1:01:53] very same
[1:01:55] word
[1:01:57] so hear silly eyes pointing
[1:02:01] to a way
[1:02:02] that would be outside of god's provided
[1:02:05] way amen
[1:02:07] god help us
[1:02:08] you see it's the same for us whenever we
[1:02:10] desire to build whatever it is
[1:02:13] outside of god's program for our life no
[1:02:16] matter what the plans are how well they
[1:02:18] may be constructed and however may seem
[1:02:20] to fed our lives the thing of it is is
[1:02:21] that what god wants for you
[1:02:23] is that what god wants for me but then
[1:02:25] to deal with a little bit about those
[1:02:28] who build the house
[1:02:29] labor in vain unless the lord builds it
[1:02:33] notice this again
[1:02:35] in verse three and sarai
[1:02:37] abram's wife took hagar her maid
[1:02:40] the egyptian
[1:02:42] after abraham had dwelt ten years in the
[1:02:44] land of canaan
[1:02:46] and gave her to her husband
[1:02:49] abram to be his wife
[1:02:52] and he went unto hagar and she conceived
[1:02:56] and when she saw she had conceived
[1:03:00] her mistress
[1:03:01] was despised
[1:03:04] in her eyes
[1:03:06] now abram goes into her and she
[1:03:09] conceives and then when she finds out
[1:03:11] she's a child what does she do
[1:03:14] she looks at cereal the mother of the
[1:03:18] promise
[1:03:19] and she actually despises her
[1:03:23] she has an element of pride and
[1:03:26] arrogance and she looks down on the
[1:03:30] promised mother
[1:03:31] as if though she's greater than her boy
[1:03:34] we get them looks all the time don't we
[1:03:37] they still look down on the promised one
[1:03:40] notice anseli said unto abram my wrong
[1:03:45] be upon thee you think what in the world
[1:03:48] did he do
[1:03:50] my wrong be upon thee i have given my
[1:03:54] maid into thy bosom and when she saw
[1:03:57] that she had conceived i was despised in
[1:04:00] her eyes the lord judged between me and
[1:04:03] thee ain't that a typical human being we
[1:04:07] do something and goof it up big time and
[1:04:09] then we blame it on the lord and
[1:04:12] somebody else
[1:04:13] well i'll tell you one thing i wouldn't
[1:04:15] have got into pornography if my wife
[1:04:17] would've done this and that and the
[1:04:18] other and i wouldn't have done this and
[1:04:20] said this if so and so had done so and
[1:04:23] so why don't you just face the facts
[1:04:25] you're like all the rest of us you're
[1:04:27] full of mistakes you're full of error
[1:04:29] don't trust that old animal of yours
[1:04:32] that old flesh of yours will deceive you
[1:04:35] it will lie to you it will let you down
[1:04:38] and then when you get in trouble all my
[1:04:40] say i told you so
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:44] oh god help us
[1:04:47] my so now
[1:04:49] sarai comes back and said the lord
[1:04:52] judged between me
[1:04:54] and thee and she was the very instigator
[1:04:57] of this but abram said unto syria behold
[1:05:00] thy maid is in the hand due to her as it
[1:05:03] pleases thee and when sarah dealt hardly
[1:05:07] was her she fled from her
[1:05:10] face
[1:05:12] but here now we go
[1:05:14] into some years
[1:05:17] of silence
[1:05:19] you see god had a great program for this
[1:05:23] woman
[1:05:24] but not under the name syria
[1:05:28] but before sarai could be changed to
[1:05:31] sarah
[1:05:33] there had to be a change
[1:05:35] in her heart
[1:05:37] you see if god would have come down the
[1:05:39] very next day after this took place and
[1:05:42] said now i'm going to change your name
[1:05:44] to abraham i'm going to change her to
[1:05:46] say i it would have been a body change
[1:05:50] without a heart change
[1:05:52] we can see from these scriptures that
[1:05:55] sarah is not quite right yet
[1:05:59] so she doubted god's promise she doubted
[1:06:02] god's program there must have been at
[1:06:04] least some sort of spiritual inclination
[1:06:08] or she could have never doubted it
[1:06:09] because the prophet tells us plainly
[1:06:11] that she doubted god's original word
[1:06:15] so whenever she does this it shows a
[1:06:18] weakness about sarai that needed to be
[1:06:22] changed before the body would be changed
[1:06:26] now we're going to go into about
[1:06:29] 13 years
[1:06:31] to where they'll be let's sit this way
[1:06:33] there'll be about about 11 and a half to
[1:06:35] 12 years of trying silence
[1:06:39] and we're not going to hear a whole lot
[1:06:42] a great deal
[1:06:43] about the promise of god being more made
[1:06:46] manifest to syria
[1:06:48] but the focus is now going to be on
[1:06:52] ishmael
[1:06:53] and abraham is going to raise him up
[1:06:57] according to josephus and many other
[1:06:59] historical writings that now abraham is
[1:07:02] instilling in ishmael he's going to be
[1:07:05] the heir he's going to be the ruler he's
[1:07:08] going to be everything that abraham
[1:07:10] looked for and yet here is a prophet of
[1:07:12] god and he is wrong as wrong can be
[1:07:16] teaching ishmael that he's going to be
[1:07:18] the heir
[1:07:19] that was not the heir at all
[1:07:22] but yet him being a prophet now don't
[1:07:24] get quiet on my children
[1:07:26] prophets make mistakes
[1:07:28] and those of you who cannot say that
[1:07:30] cannot quote that quote
[1:07:33] well praise the lord so here abram is
[1:07:37] teaching and pouring all of this effort
[1:07:39] all of this work why sure he was his son
[1:07:42] biologically yes but he was not the
[1:07:45] promised son of the word
[1:07:47] and yet he nurtured him and fed him and
[1:07:50] took care of him and remember abram had
[1:07:52] this weakness even when it cometh law
[1:07:54] because he done lot exactly the same way
[1:07:58] he had no error can't you see where our
[1:08:00] great personal battle is under the
[1:08:02] abrahamic faith it is us being able to
[1:08:05] identify ourselves in the proper place
[1:08:09] of the scriptures
[1:08:11] of us being able to look not you and lot
[1:08:14] not you and ishmael you and isaac
[1:08:18] the real you there is your promise that
[1:08:21] god's to give you
[1:08:23] but if satan cannot stop you from
[1:08:26] recognizing that there's one god and
[1:08:29] believing many great truths of the bible
[1:08:31] then he will try to stop you on the
[1:08:34] fullness of your inheritance no matter
[1:08:36] how much land abraham had what good was
[1:08:38] it going to do him if he did not have an
[1:08:41] heir and this is what he told god he
[1:08:43] said god what am i going to do
[1:08:45] the only one i've got is this eliezer
[1:08:48] this eliezer which is from the house of
[1:08:50] damascus can't you see where the problem
[1:08:53] was abraham battling for years he first
[1:08:56] saw it was what then he thought it was
[1:08:59] going to be ishmael oh now if anything
[1:09:02] well here here comes eliezer what is it
[1:09:04] it's who's going to build the house
[1:09:08] who's going to build a house can you
[1:09:10] imagine the people that day following
[1:09:12] abraham and they probably had quotes
[1:09:14] wrote down where abraham said ishmael
[1:09:18] will be my heir one day ishmael will
[1:09:21] stand in the pulpit and do this and this
[1:09:23] and this and ishmael will lead the sheep
[1:09:25] and ishmael will do something else
[1:09:30] but that was abraham saying that not god
[1:09:34] hallelujah
[1:09:36] now notice
[1:09:38] this matriarchal position
[1:09:41] that sarah tried to make it work but
[1:09:45] with what a substitute so she wants to
[1:09:48] make her matriarchal position come into
[1:09:51] view but through another way another
[1:09:55] woman that gives birth to this child
[1:09:57] then she will embrace this child and say
[1:09:59] now this is my child i don't care how
[1:10:01] much she said it was her child it was
[1:10:03] not her child now let me go a little
[1:10:06] farther and sit this way i don't care
[1:10:07] how much you think your past is your
[1:10:09] past it's not your past
[1:10:12] i don't care how much you say your body
[1:10:14] and your shortcomings and your mistakes
[1:10:16] and your failures is the real you it is
[1:10:19] not the real you
[1:10:22] you can call it mother you can call it
[1:10:24] jack rabbit you can call it whatever you
[1:10:26] want to call it but the prophet of god
[1:10:28] has identified to us you've never done
[1:10:30] it in the first place
[1:10:34] oh hallelujah
[1:10:36] you see in order to enter into this
[1:10:40] great position now she's going to be the
[1:10:42] matriarch of this great great union that
[1:10:46] god has prophesied about on his word but
[1:10:48] there must be a change in our heart now
[1:10:51] let me compare it here we look at tests
[1:10:53] and trials of life and things that we go
[1:10:55] through and we wonder lord why would you
[1:10:56] let this happen why would you let that
[1:10:58] happen yet every one of us if we'll be
[1:11:01] honest we'll be able to look back after
[1:11:03] trials and tests have come and gone and
[1:11:05] we say my goodness i learned so much out
[1:11:07] of this i wouldn't take nothing for that
[1:11:09] i've had several folks that's went
[1:11:11] through the church here in the last six
[1:11:13] months or so and they've gone through
[1:11:14] some real difficult times and talking
[1:11:16] with them and they've told me you know
[1:11:18] different ones i'm at various times i
[1:11:20] wouldn't take nothing brother donny for
[1:11:22] this thing i've been through and said oh
[1:11:23] my goodness why wouldn't you think could
[1:11:25] they really say that why would they say
[1:11:27] it because they got something out of
[1:11:30] that a closer union with the lord jesus
[1:11:33] a stronger faith you know a greater
[1:11:36] understanding of his plan for their life
[1:11:38] over and over again and yet they sit
[1:11:40] here and hear the word you mean the word
[1:11:42] alone can't do that sometimes we have to
[1:11:45] experience things
[1:11:46] sometimes we sit there not ahead amen
[1:11:49] amen amen that's right but we still
[1:11:51] don't get it until we go through it and
[1:11:54] then when we go through things it
[1:11:56] changes uh oh you say well i in my mind
[1:11:59] i resentment if god in his mind could
[1:12:01] not imagine how you feel then you tell
[1:12:04] me your mind is so strong you can
[1:12:07] imagine how people will feel when god
[1:12:09] couldn't do it
[1:12:10] god the great eternal himself could not
[1:12:13] place himself in his mind and really
[1:12:16] think harry i'm gonna think now i'm
[1:12:18] gonna think how how harry feels i'm to
[1:12:21] think how jd feels and i'm going to
[1:12:23] think it's so strong i'll become it no
[1:12:25] he could not do it well if god cannot do
[1:12:27] it you and i cannot do it either we
[1:12:30] cannot think ourselves into some of the
[1:12:33] spiritual status that god wants us to
[1:12:35] have we must go through it
[1:12:39] now sarah is going to a time i hope you
[1:12:42] understand this it's not going to be a
[1:12:44] time of glory it's not going to be a
[1:12:46] time of greatness the things she's going
[1:12:49] to experience but actually sarai until
[1:12:52] she changes over is going to go through
[1:12:54] a time of humiliation you imagine the
[1:12:57] shame because now abram's becoming a
[1:12:59] greater and greater man while leaving
[1:13:01] and living in this land people come to
[1:13:03] trade with them and barter and so on and
[1:13:05] you imagine when they begin to hear this
[1:13:06] baby cry oh have you got a baby have you
[1:13:09] got a child well yes yes it's my child
[1:13:11] oh congratulations sarah it's not mine
[1:13:14] actually it's it's hagar's my mate but
[1:13:17] i've taken it and i'm raising it so what
[1:13:20] is god doing god is molding something in
[1:13:23] syria god is molding something in her
[1:13:26] heart in her nature that is preparing
[1:13:29] her for a complete body change
[1:13:32] oh my but of course sarah no doubt
[1:13:35] wanted what we want that god would just
[1:13:37] mold the body change in us and we'd
[1:13:40] bypass all of our knocks and blunts and
[1:13:42] life and our mistakes and so on and god
[1:13:44] would just give it now friend he ain't
[1:13:46] gonna do it that way now we want to
[1:13:48] enter into a spiritual matriarch
[1:13:52] position of the universe because
[1:13:54] actually the bride of christ is the
[1:13:57] queen of heaven she is the very epitome
[1:14:01] of god's love in the feminist form oh it
[1:14:04] wouldn't be wonderful it would just be
[1:14:05] spoken to that place but god wants us to
[1:14:08] take a character from this human life
[1:14:11] that has been molded and made and shaped
[1:14:14] through hard trials and tests and
[1:14:16] through the back side of the desert why
[1:14:18] that's his choice i'm not sure but we'll
[1:14:20] understand it i'm sure once we get that
[1:14:22] you see
[1:14:23] before she could enter into this truth
[1:14:26] matriarchal position she must reach an
[1:14:29] element of peace and contentment within
[1:14:33] herself
[1:14:34] instead of struggling what do we see
[1:14:36] about this in genesis 16 1 we see a
[1:14:40] woman struggling with the will of god we
[1:14:43] see a woman trying to understand a woman
[1:14:46] trying to perceive and a woman feeling
[1:14:49] like god needs her help to bring it to
[1:14:51] pass
[1:14:53] she's not at peace with the promise of
[1:14:56] god you see when we are at peace with
[1:14:58] the promise of god and we're sick and
[1:15:01] we're prayed for if we don't get well
[1:15:03] tomorrow and next week next month that
[1:15:05] has nothing to do with it we still
[1:15:06] believe god's word well if god you know
[1:15:10] goes down through here and lets it and
[1:15:12] go on for months
[1:15:13] i'm still healed
[1:15:15] i'm still delivered
[1:15:17] but a person that doesn't have peace
[1:15:20] with the promise they're constantly
[1:15:22] looking they're looking they're
[1:15:24] searching they're trying to help god oh
[1:15:26] god what can i do god can i do this god
[1:15:28] can i do that
[1:15:29] sarah
[1:15:32] sarai
[1:15:34] you see these 13 years
[1:15:38] were a constant
[1:15:39] humiliation
[1:15:42] 13 years of molding
[1:15:45] and moving and shaping her heart
[1:15:49] into a matriarchal heart
[1:15:52] not only of a little boy
[1:15:54] but of a divine promise
[1:15:57] no doubt she was a loving substitute
[1:16:00] mother
[1:16:01] because probably by now she had accepted
[1:16:04] the fact well i guess this is it
[1:16:06] ishmael's as far as i'll go i'm
[1:16:08] justified and i'm sanctified i guess i
[1:16:10] can't get the holy ghost so i'll just go
[1:16:12] to church live a pretty good life and do
[1:16:14] whatever i can do maybe god will have
[1:16:15] mercy on me at the white throne judgment
[1:16:19] no doubt there's people that have that
[1:16:20] attitude this morning that the holy
[1:16:22] ghost has identified with you before the
[1:16:24] foundation of the world and he's only
[1:16:26] waiting on you to stand up to your
[1:16:27] matriarchal position
[1:16:29] but you've accepted justification and
[1:16:31] sanctification that's as far as you've
[1:16:33] gone in your walk with god
[1:16:35] notice this through this pain
[1:16:39] through this humiliation
[1:16:41] i'm suffering
[1:16:43] something is happening
[1:16:46] to sarah
[1:16:48] her ways
[1:16:50] are changing
[1:16:53] you see only then
[1:16:56] can sariah
[1:16:58] become
[1:17:00] sarah now just preach to me for the next
[1:17:03] few minutes so y'all won't take it
[1:17:05] personal all right
[1:17:08] now donnie
[1:17:10] i'm telling you something this morning
[1:17:11] son
[1:17:13] one of the worst things you can do
[1:17:15] is take your human makeup
[1:17:18] and make it the spiritual guide of your
[1:17:20] life
[1:17:24] you see so many of us we wonder well
[1:17:26] brother donny i don't drink i don't
[1:17:28] smoke my i don't have an ishmael who is
[1:17:31] it that fears god's promise won't come
[1:17:33] to pass
[1:17:34] it's your ishmael
[1:17:36] you're identifying and thinking that
[1:17:38] because you don't run around and you
[1:17:40] don't do this and that that you don't
[1:17:42] have a black dog you think because you
[1:17:44] don't go out here and commit adultery on
[1:17:46] your wife well where does that fear come
[1:17:48] from where does that doubt come from
[1:17:50] where is the question of god's word
[1:17:52] comes from you pack it within your flesh
[1:17:58] all night but you see it's only then
[1:18:01] when sarah has been changed inwardly
[1:18:05] that sarah can be changed
[1:18:08] outwardly
[1:18:10] i know when the body change is going to
[1:18:12] be
[1:18:16] i know when it's going to be
[1:18:19] now not a not a day or a month or a year
[1:18:21] or a second or something like that when
[1:18:23] the bride is ready
[1:18:26] you see when we asserie
[1:18:30] refuse to let ishmael
[1:18:32] be the guide of our soul
[1:18:36] but instead we let our soul
[1:18:38] guide ishmael
[1:18:41] boy you all require us more than a bunch
[1:18:43] of baptists
[1:18:45] now notice this chapter 18 of course is
[1:18:49] the great illuminating chapter of the
[1:18:51] body change in genesis 18. but we go in
[1:18:55] these years of silence that cereal eye
[1:18:58] is becoming molded day after day week
[1:19:02] after week i'm no doubt becoming a
[1:19:04] wonderful mother and she would take this
[1:19:07] child and love it as her own as much as
[1:19:10] she possibly could and she would still
[1:19:13] though it was hung over her
[1:19:16] that she knew that that hagar was still
[1:19:19] telling him things and hagar was still
[1:19:22] feeding him things now like it or not he
[1:19:25] is still
[1:19:26] half egyptian amen who
[1:19:29] jesus
[1:19:33] well if i was you i wouldn't look down
[1:19:35] too bad on ishmael
[1:19:36] since your first birth is between satan
[1:19:39] and eve
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:45] he said brother donnie where's the
[1:19:46] serpent see that tell me where it
[1:19:48] ain't it's all over everywhere
[1:19:51] i'm looking at a bunch of it this
[1:19:53] morning
[1:19:55] because i can't see your soul
[1:19:57] but i can see the offspring between
[1:20:00] satan and eve
[1:20:02] you say where in the world you get that
[1:20:04] out oh i'm i'll share it with you just
[1:20:06] momentarily
[1:20:08] you see god wants to bring us
[1:20:11] to chapter 18
[1:20:14] of our lives and that is the body change
[1:20:17] but god will not
[1:20:19] bring the forced body change
[1:20:22] until the willing change has been inside
[1:20:26] of us
[1:20:28] to wound that we
[1:20:30] make this ishmael
[1:20:32] subject to the word well they always
[1:20:34] want to do it now we're going to convert
[1:20:35] his smile to isaac no way he'll always
[1:20:38] rebel he will be stubborn he'll be a
[1:20:42] wild donkey of a man
[1:20:45] and some of y'all wonder why you're so
[1:20:46] hardheaded i don't wonder at all
[1:20:49] come on now y'all can't say amen at
[1:20:51] least pray real loud
[1:20:56] oh my notice this again in galatians 4
[1:20:58] 22 4 it is written that abraham had two
[1:21:01] sons the one bob a bond made the other
[1:21:05] by a free woman now paul actually puts
[1:21:08] this under the new testament name
[1:21:10] but in reality
[1:21:11] they changed abraham
[1:21:15] didn't have two sons
[1:21:22] ishmael's father
[1:21:24] was abram
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:30] ishmael's father was don reagan
[1:21:34] or whatever your daddy's name was
[1:21:37] amen but the father of isaac
[1:21:41] was a bra him
[1:21:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:48] oh can't you see our natural birth who
[1:21:50] is the father of my natural nature
[1:21:53] coming under the fallen adamic nature
[1:21:56] that i inherited oh is that right but
[1:21:59] who is the father of the birth of my
[1:22:01] soul it's not the first adam it's not
[1:22:04] don reagan it's not a pastor somewhere
[1:22:07] it's not a prophet somewhere the father
[1:22:10] of the birth of my soul is almighty god
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:16] amen amen and it's the two strains of my
[1:22:20] fathers that fight within me
[1:22:23] [Applause]
[1:22:26] notice this in galatians 4 28 now we
[1:22:30] brethren as isaac was of the children of
[1:22:32] promise
[1:22:34] but as then he that was born after the
[1:22:37] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[1:22:40] the spirit even so it is now now
[1:22:42] remember when paul writes this the
[1:22:44] ishmaelites the hagarins all of them
[1:22:47] they're pretty much you know they're not
[1:22:49] even around them so it's not like it is
[1:22:51] now the palestinian conflict to where
[1:22:53] they're battling for the land the roman
[1:22:55] empire was the one that was ruling when
[1:22:56] paul wrote this so it was not
[1:22:58] necessarily making reference to the
[1:23:00] ishmaelites the midianites the
[1:23:03] medianites and all the rest of those
[1:23:04] heights but he's making a spiritual
[1:23:07] reference to the battle that goes within
[1:23:09] us paul come to a great revelation when
[1:23:12] he said that in me that is in my flesh
[1:23:17] dwell us
[1:23:18] no good thing
[1:23:21] now that's not a very uplifting
[1:23:22] scripture is it that is not a great
[1:23:25] wonderful scripture that crowns our
[1:23:27] humanity with crowns of gold but you
[1:23:29] know what it's a great revelation if
[1:23:31] you'll ever come to it but some of you
[1:23:33] saying all of heaven is in your flesh
[1:23:36] some of you saying your flesh is so good
[1:23:38] and i think this and i think that you're
[1:23:40] crowning ishmael
[1:23:42] i said you're crowning ishmael
[1:23:46] notice this hebrews chapter six part
[1:23:48] three abraham had many children he had
[1:23:51] one before he had isaac which was
[1:23:54] showing the slipping up of the unbelief
[1:23:58] of sarah who wanted hannah pronounces it
[1:24:01] hannah to bring the child thinking she
[1:24:03] was too old and god to bypass and make
[1:24:06] some other way from the way he had
[1:24:07] promised to do it but god keeps his
[1:24:10] promise no matter how unreasonable it
[1:24:12] may seem notice sarah thought that maybe
[1:24:15] she could have hannah or hagar rather
[1:24:17] her maid to give birth to a baby through
[1:24:20] abraham and she would take it and that
[1:24:23] became ishmael listen what it cost which
[1:24:26] was a thorn
[1:24:31] ah
[1:24:33] so ishmael is a thorn in the flesh is he
[1:24:42] from then until now think of what one
[1:24:46] mistake
[1:24:48] think of what one mistake
[1:24:51] of an elect woman done
[1:24:57] the wars and all the conflicts between
[1:24:59] the arabs
[1:25:01] the ishmaelites
[1:25:03] praise the lord
[1:25:06] one mistake
[1:25:10] you see god can forgive us of our
[1:25:12] mistakes friends but when we do wrong
[1:25:15] we're sowing seeds
[1:25:18] and forgiveness does not dig them seeds
[1:25:20] up out of the ground
[1:25:23] praise the
[1:25:24] lord
[1:25:26] it is still ongoing now and it's worse
[1:25:29] now than it was in 1957. notice this in
[1:25:32] genesis 21 8
[1:25:34] and the child grew now we come to a time
[1:25:36] of course whenever isaac has been born
[1:25:39] he's about three years old something
[1:25:40] like that and ishmael is 16.
[1:25:43] now he's weaned and oh what a happy time
[1:25:46] it is they're having a great celebration
[1:25:50] and the child grew and was winged and
[1:25:51] abraham made a great feast the same day
[1:25:54] that isaac was wayne and sarah notice
[1:25:57] it's no longer serious
[1:25:59] and sarah saw the son of the
[1:26:02] denominations
[1:26:06] which she had born unto abraham
[1:26:09] mocking
[1:26:14] i've looked at this word and studied
[1:26:15] this word for years
[1:26:17] but i was so overwhelmed
[1:26:20] friday whenever i was looking at this i
[1:26:23] could not believe it i just simply could
[1:26:25] not believe it look at this hebrew word
[1:26:29] mocking is the hebrew word messiah
[1:26:33] you can see the hebrew writing there and
[1:26:36] it has the same root as ichsak which in
[1:26:39] the english
[1:26:41] is isaac
[1:26:43] therefore the way moses applies this
[1:26:46] word
[1:26:47] he uses it as a verb so a word of action
[1:26:52] so he said ishmael
[1:26:54] was isaacing
[1:27:01] ishmael
[1:27:02] was isaac in other words ishmael
[1:27:06] was acting
[1:27:08] like isaac
[1:27:13] lord have mercy
[1:27:15] so ishmael the flesh
[1:27:18] was acting
[1:27:20] like it was the heir
[1:27:22] to the promise
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:26] lord children i want you to think today
[1:27:28] of all the issues in our life and our
[1:27:30] walk with god we felt led to do this and
[1:27:32] felt led to do that and felt led to do
[1:27:34] look at all the crazy stuff that people
[1:27:36] blame on god i felt led to do this and i
[1:27:39] felt like i felt led to put my wife away
[1:27:41] and marry another well you didn't feel
[1:27:43] that of god to do that that was the
[1:27:45] devil that done now not the holy ghost
[1:27:47] and people will take their makeup and
[1:27:49] they'll take we take our oddities and
[1:27:51] our peculiarities and we think we're
[1:27:54] being led to the spirit people that are
[1:27:56] you know we're all different and we're
[1:27:57] all unique and god's not against that
[1:28:00] but what god has a problem is is
[1:28:02] whenever we will let ishmael go to isaac
[1:28:07] and we'll let ishmael decline what i
[1:28:10] well i want to do this and i want to do
[1:28:11] that and i think i need to do this and i
[1:28:13] believe this and that and the other and
[1:28:15] we tried to make ishmael i said what is
[1:28:18] ishmael doing ishmael wants isaac's
[1:28:21] position in the family of abraham and in
[1:28:24] the economy of god
[1:28:29] so ishmael is acting like isaac
[1:28:34] so he's ridiculing he's making fun and
[1:28:37] he's harassing him but he's doing it in
[1:28:40] the form of isaac
[1:28:44] oh lord
[1:28:46] think of it how many times that our old
[1:28:48] flesh our old maker well i think this
[1:28:51] and i believe that my goodness as a
[1:28:54] pastor how many times have i seen it
[1:28:56] that people got in such situations in
[1:28:58] their life and they thought it was the
[1:29:00] lord leading them it wasn't the lord it
[1:29:03] was this
[1:29:05] but we'll turn it around nine times out
[1:29:07] of ten and blame it on the lord well i
[1:29:09] just knew it was the lord i just knew it
[1:29:12] was the lord it was your ishmael acting
[1:29:15] like you're isaac
[1:29:17] he's one to lead you he's one to guide
[1:29:20] you
[1:29:24] oh my
[1:29:26] but you see ishmael was a natural man
[1:29:30] reproduced by abraham's strengths
[1:29:33] but isaac
[1:29:35] was a miracle son
[1:29:40] your new birth is a miracle child
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:44] your new birth is supernatural america
[1:29:47] isaac even though god used human
[1:29:50] instrumentality
[1:29:52] it was a supernatural burst and god's
[1:29:55] issue is this
[1:29:57] when we will try to replace the
[1:30:00] supernatural verse with a man-made one
[1:30:05] you understand why folks have pulled
[1:30:06] away from the message in the last
[1:30:08] several years of all this stuff going on
[1:30:10] don't you understand why
[1:30:11] it proves they were only ishmael
[1:30:15] isaac
[1:30:16] they were acting like isaac screaming
[1:30:19] amen to the quotes the same quotes now
[1:30:21] they hate the same prophet now they hate
[1:30:25] how could they do that they was never
[1:30:28] born again
[1:30:29] we gave them a book we gave them a tape
[1:30:31] we indoctrinated them but how many of
[1:30:34] them ever got to jesus christ and
[1:30:36] experienced a genuine new birth i don't
[1:30:38] want our children just to quote the
[1:30:40] prophet i don't want our children just
[1:30:42] to know the prophet's life story i want
[1:30:45] them to know jesus christ to be filled
[1:30:48] with the holy ghost if not their ishmael
[1:30:52] will act like isaac
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:31:02] see the koran
[1:31:04] teaches that ishmael
[1:31:07] was the child of promise
[1:31:11] so the muslims believe
[1:31:13] that god's covenant was with ishmael
[1:31:18] not isaac
[1:31:19] as a matter of fact they teach
[1:31:23] that abraham took ishmael
[1:31:26] up to the rock on moriah
[1:31:31] they also teach
[1:31:33] that abraham and ishmael
[1:31:37] went into that part of arabia
[1:31:43] and built the kebab
[1:31:45] and you all know what that is
[1:31:48] all right i'll explain it to you
[1:31:50] it's a stone structure
[1:31:54] which is
[1:31:55] thousands of years old
[1:31:57] been rebuilt and rebuilt
[1:32:00] but there's a black stone which is the
[1:32:02] foundation stone
[1:32:04] and they teach that abraham
[1:32:08] and ishmael went there into arabia saudi
[1:32:12] arabia
[1:32:13] and built this place
[1:32:16] to worship allah
[1:32:20] will abraham come out of hedonism how
[1:32:22] did he turn around go back into
[1:32:26] abraham never worshiped allah but elohim
[1:32:32] abraham didn't get a letter off of
[1:32:34] allah's name he got a letter off of
[1:32:36] elohim's name
[1:32:40] so it is a cube
[1:32:42] now what's amazing it historically is
[1:32:44] those of you that don't know anything
[1:32:45] about it you know that it actually
[1:32:47] became a focal point for many of the
[1:32:50] hedonistic religions and worship
[1:32:53] isis different ones
[1:32:55] and then when muhammad comes on the
[1:32:57] earth
[1:32:58] then muhammad claiming to be
[1:33:02] one of the seed
[1:33:03] of abraham
[1:33:05] now actually muhammad was born
[1:33:08] down through the tribal lineage
[1:33:11] from ishmael
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:17] so here's an ishmael
[1:33:20] they want to make him take isaac's place
[1:33:26] ishmael brought pain
[1:33:28] difficulty hardship in the home as soon
[1:33:30] as he was conceived argument started
[1:33:34] that sounds like the basis of islamic
[1:33:36] religion you know
[1:33:38] oh i know you ain't supposed to say
[1:33:39] anything about that but you say i don't
[1:33:41] follow them supposed rules i follow the
[1:33:43] holy ghost
[1:33:44] i know it's not accepted by the left and
[1:33:46] i really don't care whether the left
[1:33:48] likes it or really who don't like it i'm
[1:33:50] going to preach the truth today y'all
[1:33:51] want to hear the truth let me tickle
[1:33:52] your ear
[1:33:57] so they know that the bible
[1:34:00] is a book of the jews
[1:34:04] as a matter of fact muhammad even calls
[1:34:06] the people the jews in his writings the
[1:34:09] koran he calls them the people
[1:34:13] of the book
[1:34:15] the god also tells them it's all right
[1:34:17] for them to kill him so he's one
[1:34:19] confused man wasn't it
[1:34:21] so because the bible places isaac in the
[1:34:26] middle of god's promise
[1:34:29] then they must needs have another book
[1:34:35] so then an angel comes to him in a cave
[1:34:39] and begins to reveal which i don't i
[1:34:42] don't doubt that at all i don't doubt
[1:34:43] that he didn't see some kind of
[1:34:44] supernatural being but i know which side
[1:34:47] did it come from
[1:34:49] wasn't an angel from heaven
[1:34:51] well praise the lord then what did he do
[1:34:53] it put isaac out of the covenant
[1:34:57] and put ishmael
[1:35:03] then you have to have your own book
[1:35:07] to make your life here we got now so
[1:35:09] we've got judaism
[1:35:11] we've got christianity
[1:35:12] and we've got islam
[1:35:14] all three of the major faiths of the
[1:35:16] world
[1:35:17] all three of them with their roots from
[1:35:20] who
[1:35:21] abraham
[1:35:24] and all three of them saying the others
[1:35:26] are wrong each one of them say no you're
[1:35:27] not the bride we are and they say no
[1:35:29] you're not we are
[1:35:31] well one of them's got to be
[1:35:33] praise the lord
[1:35:35] so what will your flesh try to do
[1:35:38] it will try to take your book
[1:35:42] of your natural birth
[1:35:44] and make it the predominant force the
[1:35:47] koran
[1:35:48] of your life
[1:35:54] and then if the preacher preaches
[1:35:56] something or you read something in the
[1:35:57] message or you see something in the
[1:35:58] scripture that you don't like well i
[1:36:01] just don't believe that i just don't
[1:36:02] think i'm going to do it i think brother
[1:36:04] don is a little bit legal or i think
[1:36:06] brother donnie leans two minutes this
[1:36:07] way brother branham that's just brother
[1:36:09] branham's idea so you've got your own
[1:36:11] koran ain't you
[1:36:14] well well well y'all didn't even know
[1:36:16] you had a koran did you some of y'all
[1:36:18] said i ain't never read the quran in my
[1:36:20] life oh yes you have you live in that
[1:36:22] quran out of your life every day honey
[1:36:25] every day you follow your flesh the
[1:36:27] koran of your life is leading you around
[1:36:31] and the kaaba of your life guess what
[1:36:33] the kaaba is it is your own will that
[1:36:36] you will worship and exalt above the
[1:36:38] word of god well i want this and i want
[1:36:41] that don't make too much fun of those
[1:36:44] islamic people for being heathens
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:48] any idol that we put before the word of
[1:36:51] god we are committing idolatry
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:57] let's stand
[1:37:09] look friends
[1:37:11] look where israel in the world is right
[1:37:13] now
[1:37:15] so
[1:37:16] the muslims
[1:37:18] want to claim they are the promised
[1:37:20] people
[1:37:21] their book is the promised book the
[1:37:22] kabbalah is the place to go to worship
[1:37:24] that's why they will always no matter
[1:37:26] where they are i've seen them around the
[1:37:28] world
[1:37:29] i've seen some down in knoxville at
[1:37:31] walmart a few years ago
[1:37:34] and it's after 9 11 so i was a little
[1:37:36] bit anxious needless to say
[1:37:38] they opened up their trunk and they got
[1:37:40] out their prayer mats and they figured
[1:37:42] out which way was east and they got down
[1:37:44] there
[1:37:47] i got my truck headed out of there
[1:37:50] you never know they'll be packing a bomb
[1:37:52] somewhere
[1:37:53] but why do they do that because the
[1:37:55] kaabah is in the east well why why do
[1:37:57] they want jerusalem why would they want
[1:38:00] jerusalem because he supposedly had a
[1:38:03] night vision
[1:38:05] and he went up to jerusalem
[1:38:08] and he supposedly was carried up into
[1:38:10] heaven
[1:38:11] so then what does that do give them
[1:38:14] claims
[1:38:15] on the capital city
[1:38:17] of isaac
[1:38:21] so medina the kabba
[1:38:24] and now jerusalem
[1:38:27] so they build their big edifice over
[1:38:30] this rock which supposedly abraham was
[1:38:33] going to offer his son which supposedly
[1:38:35] the ark of the covenant set in the hewed
[1:38:37] out spot i saw a picture of it last
[1:38:39] night a huge outspot on this gigantic
[1:38:42] rock and they called it the dome of the
[1:38:44] rock
[1:38:46] and no jew was allowed to set his foot
[1:38:50] on that mount
[1:38:52] so what do they want to say this is ours
[1:38:58] and isaac
[1:38:59] you stay out
[1:39:05] well you say that makes me so mad at
[1:39:07] them a bunch of people
[1:39:09] will turn it inwards
[1:39:12] cause your ishmael
[1:39:14] wants to tell your eyes you ain't
[1:39:16] telling me what to do
[1:39:18] if i don't want to go to church i ain't
[1:39:20] going you ain't telling me to worship my
[1:39:22] hand you ain't telling me to raise and
[1:39:23] praise god i ain't doing it
[1:39:27] you ishmaelite
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:40] can you imagine friends these people
[1:39:42] teaching their children
[1:39:44] i saw a video the other day of a
[1:39:45] three-year-old girl
[1:39:48] which was a muslim
[1:39:50] she was being asked by her instructor
[1:39:52] why she hated the jews
[1:39:55] because she said the jews are pigs
[1:39:58] and apes
[1:40:00] and we will kill every one of them
[1:40:07] you see those who live after the flesh
[1:40:10] will die after the flesh
[1:40:12] now we we gasp when we say oh it's
[1:40:14] terrible oh that's awful
[1:40:17] when you follow your flesh
[1:40:19] instead of the spirit of god
[1:40:22] you're living after the flesh
[1:40:24] well i follow my flesh
[1:40:26] instead of the spirit of god
[1:40:29] aren't you glad for mercy
[1:40:37] so the ultimate question is this
[1:40:41] which son
[1:40:42] is the heir
[1:40:45] now most of you christians that love god
[1:40:47] with all of your heart you would die
[1:40:49] for the bible
[1:40:51] the muslims will die for the quran
[1:40:54] they say the bible has been interpreted
[1:40:56] so many times and went through 40
[1:40:58] different authors and written over a
[1:40:59] period of 1500 years how in the world
[1:41:01] could it be authentic the koran come
[1:41:04] from one person they say
[1:41:06] which is the voice of god
[1:41:10] and they would die for the koran
[1:41:14] they believe they're on the right side
[1:41:16] ishmael
[1:41:18] we believe our promised son is not isaac
[1:41:21] but jesus
[1:41:23] but they say jesus did not die
[1:41:26] and they say jesus was not a son because
[1:41:30] allah has no son
[1:41:35] so jesus was not a son of god he was a
[1:41:38] good man
[1:41:39] and they profit
[1:41:42] oh you won't hear this on cnn or nbc or
[1:41:46] any rest those places
[1:41:48] but we're children of truth
[1:41:52] don't focus so much on and
[1:41:54] all that sort of thing the focus i want
[1:41:56] you to focus on today is you
[1:42:02] and your ishmael trying to isaac around
[1:42:06] and leads you
[1:42:08] and you fall back upon your human nature
[1:42:11] and make that the leadership of your
[1:42:13] life and if you'll recall you acted the
[1:42:15] same way for the devil when you as a
[1:42:16] sinner
[1:42:18] what was it then ishmael what is it now
[1:42:21] ishmael god don't take converted ishmael
[1:42:23] he can never be converted
[1:42:26] it's got to be high second
[1:42:32] since 1948
[1:42:35] whenever they were declared
[1:42:37] a nation
[1:42:39] the u.n actually sanctioned it
[1:42:44] right
[1:42:46] the u.n sanctioned it
[1:42:49] david bin gurion stands up
[1:42:53] we stood there
[1:42:54] a couple years ago and this little hall
[1:42:58] wasn't as big as this building here
[1:43:01] where he stood up and declared that
[1:43:03] israel
[1:43:04] was a state
[1:43:07] the people danced and shouted and jumped
[1:43:11] and while they're jumping
[1:43:13] the arabs are gathering together
[1:43:16] they're getting their mig-29s they're
[1:43:18] getting their tanks
[1:43:20] in the next day thousands times
[1:43:22] thousands times thousands
[1:43:25] of arabs
[1:43:26] gather against them
[1:43:29] would you believe one day i wore the
[1:43:30] next
[1:43:33] you'll have to fight for every inch of
[1:43:34] the ground you claim in god
[1:43:37] your soul says you're healed your body
[1:43:39] says look at your symptoms
[1:43:41] your soul says you're delivered this
[1:43:42] besetting sin it ain't gonna bother you
[1:43:44] no more but your body will say i still
[1:43:46] want it which one you're gonna listen to
[1:43:48] the koran or the holy word of god
[1:43:54] declare your statehood
[1:43:56] this belongs to us
[1:43:59] i told you before it was hadrian the
[1:44:01] emperor
[1:44:03] which wanted to brought the name of
[1:44:05] israel out from the land so he changed
[1:44:07] the name
[1:44:13] change the name from the land of israel
[1:44:17] oh you know why they hate archaeology in
[1:44:20] israel
[1:44:21] you know why they hate it
[1:44:23] when they find a little old seal like
[1:44:26] they found six months ago
[1:44:28] and it was made to the name of barack
[1:44:32] one of the scribes that lived during the
[1:44:34] time of jeremiah
[1:44:36] and they dug it up out of the dirt and
[1:44:38] been buried for all these thousands of
[1:44:40] years
[1:44:41] you know how they hate it when they find
[1:44:43] that
[1:44:44] because it shows israel's
[1:44:46] pre-identity you know why the devil
[1:44:49] hates predestination in this message it
[1:44:51] shows your pre-identity before you
[1:44:53] become immortal
[1:44:55] [Applause]
[1:44:59] he don't want you digging back in the
[1:45:01] archeology of the lamb's book of life
[1:45:04] and find out you was a seed before you
[1:45:07] was a human
[1:45:10] [Applause]
[1:45:12] thank you hallelujah
[1:45:17] so every coin ever seal
[1:45:20] everything they find
[1:45:22] proves
[1:45:23] because the palestinians say this is our
[1:45:26] land it belongs to us
[1:45:31] but every rock predates
[1:45:33] palestinia
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] every quote i read about election
[1:45:38] predates my natural bertha
[1:45:41] [Applause]
[1:45:44] and predicts me being immortal
[1:45:47] so i keep digging in the archaeology of
[1:45:50] god's word
[1:45:52] hallelujah
[1:46:00] they had a war in 1948 1949
[1:46:03] 1956 1967 1973 to 1974 and 1978
[1:46:10] and it's still ongoing
[1:46:13] because the way the wind blows from the
[1:46:15] gaza strip
[1:46:17] over to jerusalem the capital
[1:46:20] the land blows out basically one
[1:46:21] direction all the time
[1:46:23] every week or so
[1:46:24] they will load up explosives
[1:46:27] in balloons small balloons birthday size
[1:46:30] balloons
[1:46:32] and put them up and release them and
[1:46:34] when they do to get them across the wall
[1:46:37] so it'll explode and destroy jews
[1:46:40] which they hate
[1:46:43] to this day why
[1:46:45] one woman
[1:46:49] take mermaid
[1:46:52] take my maid
[1:46:54] to be your wife
[1:46:58] oh man
[1:47:00] well let me not keep you wait until next
[1:47:02] week
[1:47:03] spoken word's original seed
[1:47:06] but every man no matter whether he's a
[1:47:08] pope
[1:47:09] priest
[1:47:10] bishop whatever he is he dies because
[1:47:13] he's a hybrid that's exactly
[1:47:16] he was born
[1:47:18] between
[1:47:20] satan and eve
[1:47:28] can't you see why we needed an act of
[1:47:30] kenosis
[1:47:32] for the mighty god to empty himself
[1:47:35] wow what was our problem
[1:47:37] birth
[1:47:38] our entire problem was a birth issue
[1:47:42] so we needed to be reborn
[1:47:45] praise god
[1:47:48] you love him with all your heart
[1:47:51] let's pray together
[1:47:56] lord jesus
[1:47:59] how great are those words
[1:48:02] how great is thy truth
[1:48:06] lord we thank you no matter how much
[1:48:08] satan tries to impersonate it
[1:48:12] it still lives
[1:48:15] lord god
[1:48:17] imagine if sarai
[1:48:19] and abram
[1:48:20] could have looked forward in time
[1:48:23] and seen what they would have brought on
[1:48:25] their posterity
[1:48:27] she would have never made such a fatal
[1:48:30] mistake
[1:48:32] if eve in the garden of eden could have
[1:48:35] looked forward
[1:48:37] and saw what she was fixing to do to all
[1:48:40] of her daughters
[1:48:42] if adam would have looked forward and
[1:48:44] seen what he was going to do to all of
[1:48:46] his children
[1:48:48] i find it hard to believe
[1:48:50] they would have followed through
[1:48:53] but then i bring it back to us and i
[1:48:55] think
[1:48:56] if we could look forward to some of the
[1:48:58] foolish things we do
[1:49:00] if we'd see the damage
[1:49:02] the harm
[1:49:03] to our children our grandchildren to
[1:49:05] whoever more
[1:49:07] would we still do them
[1:49:09] or would we say no lord help us to
[1:49:11] realize
[1:49:13] our lives we belong to a body
[1:49:16] we belong to a move we belong we're
[1:49:18] members of each other
[1:49:21] father god help us
[1:49:23] help us lord jesus to realize
[1:49:26] brother branham said that he feared
[1:49:30] not that he would backslide
[1:49:32] but afraid that he would cause a
[1:49:34] stumbling block
[1:49:36] in front of somebody
[1:49:38] he wanted his neighbors to know he was a
[1:49:40] christian he wanted the people around
[1:49:43] him
[1:49:44] to know that he was a christian
[1:49:47] yet lord so many in this message are so
[1:49:49] independent and they don't care they
[1:49:51] don't consider anybody else they go to
[1:49:53] church with they want their way and they
[1:49:55] don't care
[1:49:56] they're so hard-headed and so stubborn
[1:50:00] help us to realize father we're not
[1:50:02] following the bible
[1:50:04] we're following our hand-written koran
[1:50:08] we're making ishmael
[1:50:10] the ruler of our lives
[1:50:13] and leading him to the kabah
[1:50:15] and worshiping in the form of idolatry
[1:50:19] because you said stubbornness was as
[1:50:21] witchcraft
[1:50:24] rebellion is this idolatry lord
[1:50:28] help us father i pray
[1:50:30] forgive us lord jesus
[1:50:34] oh but from the very promise
[1:50:37] the very time that sarah was changed
[1:50:41] and the bible says
[1:50:43] god
[1:50:44] visited
[1:50:46] sarah
[1:50:48] praise
[1:50:50] god what a great honor
[1:50:53] to be visited
[1:50:55] by god
[1:50:57] would you mind if i bring it down this
[1:50:59] morning sir
[1:51:01] and say once again
[1:51:03] god
[1:51:04] visited happy valley
[1:51:08] god visiting evening live down in
[1:51:11] louisiana and visiting this church and
[1:51:13] that church
[1:51:14] assemblies around the world
[1:51:16] god
[1:51:18] visiting us to speak to us
[1:51:22] to change us
[1:51:23] maybe we're in a time of our humiliation
[1:51:27] a time of difficulty in trials and tests
[1:51:31] before our change
[1:51:33] maybe it's to change our heart
[1:51:36] before the finale
[1:51:37] of our bodies lord
[1:51:40] to take that last speck of reagan
[1:51:43] control out
[1:51:44] that last speck of yawns control or
[1:51:47] whitson control or smith or brown or
[1:51:50] whatever we are
[1:51:52] to where the soul finally achieves its
[1:51:55] ultimate goal
[1:51:58] can say i do nothing
[1:52:00] but what my father shows me
[1:52:03] i
[1:52:04] and my father
[1:52:06] are one
[1:52:09] we will not go to a kabah
[1:52:12] we will not go to some square cube
[1:52:15] of man-made theory
[1:52:18] but we will ascend
[1:52:20] to the new jerusalem
[1:52:22] the mother
[1:52:24] of us all
[1:52:27] help us lord
[1:52:28] jesus we worship you lord god
[1:52:33] can we just raise our hands friends in
[1:52:35] the presence of the king
[1:52:39] thank you lord god
[1:52:42] thank you lord god
[1:52:45] you want to be that type of christian
[1:52:46] today
[1:52:49] that you bring your ishmael subject
[1:52:52] you know the bible tells us whenever
[1:52:53] abraham died
[1:52:55] that isaac
[1:52:57] and ishmael
[1:52:59] they met together again
[1:53:02] and they buried abraham
[1:53:05] both of them could make claim
[1:53:07] this was our father
[1:53:09] but we have no historical account
[1:53:12] or any other scriptural account
[1:53:15] were they ever met again
[1:53:17] so at the death of a dispensation
[1:53:21] a time when god is not now just dealing
[1:53:23] with abraham
[1:53:25] but with the promised seed
[1:53:27] ishmael and isaac
[1:53:29] go their separate ways
[1:53:32] they go their separate ways
[1:53:35] as jacob and esau had to do the same
[1:53:38] thing and you already know you're there
[1:53:39] too
[1:53:41] they had to go their separate ways
[1:53:44] and it's amazing because it'd be so much
[1:53:45] easier if it was that way you know our
[1:53:47] flesh go one way and our soul go the
[1:53:48] other well that'll happen of course when
[1:53:50] we die or when they're changed
[1:53:52] but the thing of it is we live in the
[1:53:54] same unit
[1:53:55] but from within the soul
[1:53:57] the flesh will always bother you
[1:53:59] it'll be carnal sticky
[1:54:02] and it'll bother you
[1:54:03] but you can keep it under control by the
[1:54:05] holy ghost
[1:54:08] god aren't you so glad
[1:54:11] how many wants to be that type of a
[1:54:13] believer today
[1:54:15] you want to be an isaac
[1:54:17] that brings laughter
[1:54:19] look friends what's caused you and i so
[1:54:20] much problems it's our ishmael
[1:54:23] what caused us so much difficulty many
[1:54:25] of you today still pack scars in your
[1:54:28] life because of failures and things your
[1:54:31] ishmael done and it bears over on your
[1:54:34] walk your isaac walk
[1:54:36] because of humiliation and shame and
[1:54:39] things that you've done
[1:54:41] oh god
[1:54:43] may god help us today
[1:54:45] to severus from that whole life
[1:54:48] oh we worship you jesus
[1:54:51] we worship you jesus
