[0:21] his temptation.

[13:05] I once was lost,

[13:30] You only know.
[13:34] I'm glad you see

[13:47] an empty place.
[13:51] If not for grace. Let's sing it one more
[13:54] time. Where would I be?
[13:59] You only know.
[14:03] I'm glad you see

[14:42] Amen. Keep going. We'll take those.

[14:52] and how much we love them tonight. Amen.
[14:55] Let's give our singers a nice hand as
[14:56] you're seated tonight.
[15:45] At the feet of Jesus, I will lay my
[15:51] burdens down.
[15:55] I will lay my heavy burdens down.
[16:02] [Music]
[16:03] In the stillness I can hear my Savior
[16:08] calling out.
[16:12] Come to me and lay your burdens
[16:17] down.
[16:20] So I will lay down my struggles.
[16:25] I will lay down my shame.
[16:29] And all the fear I drag around through
[16:33] this life like a ball and chain. And I
[16:38] will sing halleluah
[16:42] to the one who sets me free.
[16:50] And you will find me at the feet of
[16:54] Jesus.
[16:59] And you will find me at the feet of
[17:03] Jesus.
[17:06] [Music]
[17:11] In the arms of Jesus, I will find my
[17:16] peace and rest.
[17:20] I hear him calling, "Come to me and
[17:25] rest.
[17:29] carried by my shepherd cradle tightly to
[17:34] his chest.
[17:37] There and there alone my soul finds
[17:42] rest.
[17:44] So I will rest in the shelter
[17:49] of my Savior's
[17:52] embrace.
[17:54] Hidden safely in the refuge
[17:58] of his mercy and his grace. I will sing
[18:04] halleluah
[18:06] to the one who sets me free.
[18:14] You will find me in the arms
[18:19] of Jesus.
[18:22] [Music]
[18:59] At the feet of my Savior,
[19:04] At the feet of my king,
[19:08] I will bow down and worship.
[19:12] And I will lift my voice and sing
[19:16] hallelu,
[19:18] hallelu
[19:20] to the one who sets me free.
[19:28] And you will find me at the feet of
[19:33] Jesus.
[19:37] And you will find me at the feet
[19:42] of Jesus.
[19:44] [Music]
[19:50] [Applause]
[20:03] Uh, somebody asked me to sing this. I
[20:05] don't know if they got the words in
[20:06] there. It was the other one, brother.
[20:08] I'm sorry.
[20:10] Lord, to sing about you.
[20:12] I sent it to Justin. I don't know if he
[20:14] got the words, but if if you know it,
[20:16] you help me sing it.
[20:18] D
[20:23] The world
[20:25] was this way
[20:28] before I came
[20:32] along.
[20:34] And it may not
[20:37] get better
[20:40] by the time that
[20:43] I'm gone.
[20:45] [Music]
[20:49] But if I
[20:52] have a part
[20:55] while I'm passing
[20:58] through,
[21:01] let me smile from
[21:04] my heart, Lord,
[21:06] and sing
[21:09] about you.
[21:12] [Music]
[21:15] Cuz I love
[21:18] you, Jesus,
[21:19] [Applause]
[21:21] and I love
[21:23] your name.
[21:27] And a long time
[21:29] ago,
[21:33] I'm
[21:35] glad you came.
[21:38] Let others
[21:41] go on.
[21:44] do what they want
[21:47] to do.
[21:50] But it makes
[21:53] me happy
[21:55] to sing
[21:58] about you.
[22:04] I've tasted
[22:07] some tear drops,
[22:10] had heartache
[22:12] and pain.
[22:15] And I've reached
[22:18] for rainbows,
[22:21] but only
[22:24] in vain.
[22:27] I was
[22:29] so empty,
[22:32] so lonely
[22:35] and blue.
[22:38] Till you came in
[22:41] my heart, Lord,
[22:43] with a song
[22:46] about you.
[22:52] And I love
[22:54] you, Jesus.
[22:58] And I love
[23:00] your name.
[23:03] A long time
[23:06] ago.
[23:09] I'm glad you came.
[23:17] Let others
[23:20] go on
[23:22] do what they want
[23:26] to do.
[23:28] But it makes
[23:31] me happy
[23:33] to get to sing
[23:36] about you.
[23:38] [Music]
[23:42] Oh, I love
[23:45] you, Jesus.
[23:48] Oh, I love
[23:50] your name
[23:54] a long time
[23:56] ago.
[24:00] I'm glad you came.
[24:07] Let others
[24:10] go.
[24:12] do what they want
[24:16] to do.
[24:19] But it makes
[24:21] me happy
[24:24] just to sing
[24:27] about you.
[24:30] Help me sing that chorus if you love me.
[24:32] Oh, I love
[24:35] you, Jesus,
[24:38] and I love
[24:41] your name
[24:44] a long time
[24:47] ago.
[24:50] I'm glad
[24:52] you came.
[24:59] ers
[25:00] go
[25:03] do what they want
[25:06] to do.
[25:08] But it makes us happy.
[25:09] But it makes
[25:12] me happy.
[25:13] So happy, Lord.
[25:14] Just to sing
[25:16] [Music]
[25:17] about you.
[25:22] Praise the Lord.
[25:24] Hallelujah.
[25:26] How many can say amen to that? Amen.
[25:30] Happy is the people whose God is the
[25:35] Lord.
[25:35] Amen.
[25:36] Amen.
[25:37] Happy is the nation, too. Could be why
[25:40] our nation's not happy anymore.
[25:42] Amen.
[25:42] Cuz certainly the Lord Jesus is not the
[25:44] God of our nation.
[25:46] But I'm glad that we can say as a
[25:48] people,
[25:49] he's our God.
[25:51] Amen.
[25:52] Well, didn't we have some wonderful
[25:54] meetings this weekend?
[25:59] Praise the Lord.
[26:02] I so enjoyed the word,
[26:04] singing, the worship, fellowship of the
[26:07] different saints from different places
[26:09] that came to be with us. Again, I want
[26:12] to say how much I appreciate all the
[26:13] effort of everybody, all the sisters and
[26:16] all the preparation of the food and all
[26:18] that you did, the deacons, all the
[26:20] brothers in the prayer line, just
[26:22] absolutely everybody. Thank you for what
[26:24] you did because it couldn't be possible
[26:26] without all of y'all putting forth your
[26:29] effort and we're so so happy that we
[26:31] could have this time. I'm sure you know
[26:33] it already. We've been robbed for
[26:35] several years of the blessings of being
[26:37] able to host a meeting. Isn't it a
[26:39] blessing to be able to do it? To watch
[26:41] the people of God come and be blessed. I
[26:43] don't how many people I've heard from
[26:45] already got healed, got delivered,
[26:47] people that got things from the Lord.
[26:49] That's it's just awesome. So before we
[26:51] read the word, let me take care of
[26:54] birthdays.
[26:56] I want to wish happy and uh happy
[26:59] birthday to Ashley and Courtney, their
[27:02] birthday on Monday. Happy anniversary to
[27:06] Miss Carol
[27:08] yesterday. 52 years.
[27:13] Wow.
[27:21] probably between her and my guardian
[27:23] angels, I won't even get a reward.
[27:27] I tell her all the time when I walk up
[27:29] before the Lord, he'll say, "You don't
[27:31] get anything. Your guardian angels and
[27:33] your wife gets everything. You cause so
[27:36] many issues."
[27:37] But oh my, what a what a wonderful gift
[27:42] God gave me when he gave me her. I I
[27:45] love her so much. I'm so thankful to God
[27:48] for her. Also like to wish her a happy
[27:50] birthday today. And um I'm not sure I
[27:55] should tell you how old she is, but I'm
[27:57] 69
[28:01] and we're born on the same day. So,
[28:05] Amen.
[28:08] I'd also like to wish Emma and Ellie and
[28:13] my son-in-law Scotty a happy birthday
[28:17] tomorrow
[28:18] and anybody else around the world that's
[28:20] had one the last few days. We hope you
[28:22] all had a happy birthday, too. So,
[28:25] praise the Lord. If I miss this week,
[28:28] I'm in a lot of trouble for sure, you
[28:30] know. So, so grateful for the blessings
[28:34] of the Lord. Let's turn tonight if you
[28:36] would to Genesis 24:53.
[28:40] Oh, how we thank the Lord for that rain
[28:42] that moves through
[28:45] that, too. I guess
[28:48] I don't care for the lightning very
[28:49] much, but
[28:51] Amen. Thank the Lord for the rain. I've
[28:54] been over here watering every day for I
[28:56] don't know how long. Several trips over
[28:57] here today, so it's getting pretty dry.
[29:01] Maybe you feel that way tonight in your
[29:03] soul. Maybe you need a good outpouring.
[29:05] I believe we're in the right place for
[29:07] it to happen, don't you?
[29:10] Genesis 24:53.
[29:15] And the servant brought forth jewels of
[29:19] silver
[29:21] and jewels
[29:23] of gold
[29:25] and raignment
[29:28] and gave them
[29:31] to Rebecca. Now I want you to notice now
[29:34] how that Moses when he writes this how
[29:37] the differentiation is between the gifts
[29:41] that the servant gives to her versus her
[29:46] mother and her brother.
[29:49] And the servant brought forth jewels of
[29:52] silver. Silver speaks of redemption and
[29:56] jewels of gold. Gold speaks of deity.
[30:02] And Raymond, well, you reckon she didn't
[30:05] have no clothes?
[30:08] But you see, this is a gift from her
[30:12] husband.
[30:15] So, her wearing the clothes he gave her
[30:20] sets her apart
[30:23] from any other maiden in the land. Now,
[30:26] I realize folks in this age don't think
[30:29] clothes matter. If I could call Rebecca
[30:32] tonight for a witness, she'd witness
[30:35] against all those that say it don't
[30:36] matter.
[30:37] Right
[30:39] now, she could have took the silver and
[30:41] took the gold and refused the clothes. I
[30:44] I don't like that. That's not my color.
[30:46] That's too long. I'd look like a holy
[30:49] roller. I'd look like an old woman. I'm
[30:51] only 16. You expect me to dress like an
[30:55] old woman?
[30:57] But you see, Rebecca, if you're going to
[30:58] be the bride,
[31:00] you're going to have to take the gifts
[31:03] the messenger brings to you. So, you
[31:06] can't sort and pick. I like, I don't
[31:08] like, I like, I don't like. It's not
[31:10] multiple selection. It's not yes and no.
[31:13] These are gifts and they come from the
[31:16] bridegroom. So, if you won't accept the
[31:18] bridegroom's gifts, guess what? He won't
[31:22] accept you.
[31:24] Quite simple, isn't it?
[31:26] And the servant brought forth jewels of
[31:28] silver and jewels of gold and raignment.
[31:32] So she must dress the part and look the
[31:34] part and gave them to Rebecca. Now
[31:39] listen at the difference. He gave also
[31:42] to her brother
[31:44] and to her mother
[31:48] precious things.
[31:50] Oh,
[31:51] precious things. What about the
[31:54] raignment? What about the redemption?
[31:56] What about the deity? No, they got some
[31:59] precious things.
[32:02] Now, notice what they do. This is the
[32:06] the agreement now that is being made.
[32:10] And they seal it as it were with a meal
[32:15] and with drinking.
[32:18] and they eat and drink he and the men
[32:24] that were with him. And they tried all
[32:27] night.
[32:29] And they rose up in the morning and he
[32:31] said,
[32:33] "Send me away unto my master." You've
[32:36] got to be kidding me.
[32:38] So he meets her one day, lays all this
[32:42] honor, tells her this whole scenario
[32:46] and wants to leave the very next
[32:50] morning.
[32:52] And they're still trying to process all
[32:54] this. They can't check him out. So
[32:57] they're still trying to process and
[32:59] think, who is this guy? and her mo her
[33:02] brother and her mother said, "Let the
[33:05] damsel
[33:07] abide with us
[33:09] a few days,
[33:11] at least 10."
[33:15] At least 10.
[33:18] After that, she
[33:21] shall go.
[33:24] I mean, let it be remembered tonight as
[33:25] we pray.
[33:28] Heavenly Father, we're still rejoicing
[33:30] in our hearts tonight, Lord Jesus, for
[33:32] the great services that we had your
[33:35] Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And we
[33:38] were just so blessed. Father, there's no
[33:41] telling the things of eternal value that
[33:45] were accomplished these few days that we
[33:48] were together. I believe the angels of
[33:50] God were here present every service to
[33:54] minister to the needs and the desires of
[33:58] your children. Not only in the visible
[34:01] audience, but Father, those that
[34:03] streamed and those that will go back and
[34:06] archive and lives I believe will be
[34:09] changed by what you placed on our
[34:12] brother's hearts. How we thank you for
[34:15] men of God in this day that surrender
[34:18] themselves to you and follow the leading
[34:21] of the spirit of God. We thank you for
[34:23] the brothers that helped in the prayer
[34:25] line. We believe, Father, great things.
[34:28] We will still hear about them and we're
[34:30] giving you praise for them in advance.
[34:32] Now, here we are again in another
[34:35] service. We were fed so well on the
[34:39] weekend, but I I just have to say, Lord,
[34:43] I've been so excited about coming to
[34:46] church again on Wednesday. Of course, we
[34:50] know that's the way we are as humans. We
[34:52] eat a good meal and before long, we need
[34:56] some more and then again and again. And
[34:59] we've done this all of our lives. So is
[35:02] it with our spiritual gastronomics
[35:06] that we never get enough? As your
[35:09] prophet said, it's like we never get
[35:11] enough. It's so rich in vitamins and so
[35:14] wonderful and we're so thankful for it.
[35:17] And then within a day or so, we're ready
[35:20] again. So Lord, would you speak to us
[35:23] tonight from your great word? We love
[35:25] you. We commit the service to you
[35:28] tonight. Father, we pray for comfort,
[35:30] Lord, for our sister Ruthanne Carter.
[35:35] Lord, we didn't didn't realize it was
[35:37] going to be just this week that you were
[35:40] going to call our brother Mack home.
[35:42] Lord, just a few days ago that he stood
[35:45] right here to my right, right in front
[35:47] of me, and me and the brothers laid our
[35:50] hands on him and prayed for him. Little
[35:52] did we know, little did I know as his
[35:55] pastor that would be the last time I
[35:58] would ever see him alive. Help us, Lord,
[36:01] to live every day as if that could
[36:04] happen to each of us. Cuz it doesn't
[36:06] really matter about our age. Lord, I'm
[36:09] thinking about those people down in
[36:11] Texas that had that flood, Lord, that
[36:14] came through and hit several of those
[36:17] camps and Lord, several of those young
[36:19] people that were killed and over a
[36:22] hundred that that have already been
[36:24] pronounced dead. We pray for your mercy,
[36:27] oh God, to those families and friends
[36:30] and those communities, Lord, and those
[36:33] twin girls. And I thought about our twin
[36:36] granddaughter's father and two sisters
[36:39] that were not twins yet when they found
[36:42] their bodies. They had their hands was
[36:45] clasped one to the other and they were
[36:48] hugging each other. Dear God, we pray
[36:51] for your comfort to them families. Help
[36:53] them, Lord Jesus. We don't know them,
[36:56] but Father, we're moved by the by the
[36:59] pain and the sorrow of others because we
[37:02] believe you are. May they feel your
[37:05] presence being near them, Lord God. In
[37:08] the name of Jesus, we ask it. Amen.
[37:12] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.
[37:14] You may be seated.
[37:20] There's no way
[37:23] that she would have known this
[37:26] particular day
[37:28] would change her life forever.
[37:33] Probably like Noah,
[37:37] like Abraham,
[37:40] like myself,
[37:42] like you. Carol and I were talking about
[37:45] it this week and she said, "You know, I
[37:47] I never really had no great plans in my
[37:52] life of what I wanted to become, of what
[37:55] I wanted to to be." And I said, "No, me
[37:58] either. I I didn't really have any great
[38:02] plans of I wanted to be this or that or
[38:05] the other." And I heard the prophet say
[38:07] that Noah was a man that didn't have
[38:11] great ambitions and great desires to
[38:15] become much of anything. We don't really
[38:18] have much history or much in the
[38:21] scripture written about this young lady,
[38:24] 16 years old. She probably didn't have a
[38:27] lot of goals and maybe a lot of
[38:29] objectives in life. thinking she would
[38:31] marry some local man. Maybe that would
[38:35] have been a businessman, a sheep herder,
[38:38] possibly a farmer, probably no more than
[38:41] that, thinking that she would marry a
[38:43] man and just have a family, raise some
[38:46] kids, just a normal average everyday
[38:50] type of person. But yet, little did she
[38:53] know what almighty God had in his plan
[38:58] for her. I guarantee you one thing as we
[39:01] sit here tonight, most of us if we could
[39:03] look back, we would have never in our
[39:06] wildest imaginations
[39:09] ever imagined the journey that we have
[39:12] been on thus far in our lives. Now, I've
[39:15] got several years behind me. Some of you
[39:17] sitting here tonight, you young people,
[39:20] you're in your tw in your teens or your
[39:22] early 20s, and you think, "Wow, you know
[39:25] what lays before me?" There's no
[39:27] telling. But there's one thing I know
[39:30] that if we can commit our life into the
[39:33] hands of him who brought us here, he can
[39:37] do more with our life than you and I
[39:40] could ever imagine.
[39:42] When we think about a person like this,
[39:46] it must have been overwhelming as she
[39:49] began to watch the great purpose and the
[39:52] plan of God unfold for her. Now, she
[39:56] felt that day a supernatural presence
[39:59] may be quite unlike anything she'd ever
[40:02] sense before. And we're told and taught
[40:06] that the angel of the Lord had moved on
[40:10] her heart about 30 minutes prior before
[40:13] the servant of God there. So, she felt
[40:18] it was going to be a great kind of a
[40:21] day. still in that she didn't know all
[40:25] that would lay before her. I imagine
[40:28] that as she embraced it and it began to
[40:31] unfold and her sitting back and thinking
[40:34] that night when she finally laid down
[40:37] and began to think about the day, what
[40:41] has just happened to me? What has just
[40:44] happened to me that this man has come
[40:48] from 450 to 500 miles away? He come with
[40:53] a plan, a purpose. I am overwhelmed by
[40:57] what has unfolded in my life this very
[41:02] day. And to think that almighty God had
[41:05] her name placed upon his plan before the
[41:10] foundation of the world. Now, that's
[41:13] wonderful about Rebecca. I believe the
[41:16] same thing about me.
[41:18] You believe the same thing about you.
[41:20] Now, you look and you say, "Well,
[41:22] Brother Donnie, I may never be a great
[41:24] person like Rebecca." That's right. You
[41:27] may not. Most of us will probably never
[41:29] make the great records of history in the
[41:32] way that she did. But think about it.
[41:34] Rebecca, young sisters, can never take
[41:37] your place. For some of you young ladies
[41:40] here tonight that are born again and
[41:42] filled with the Holy Ghost, your
[41:44] position in the kingdom of God has
[41:47] already excelled in the spiritual realm
[41:50] higher than Rebecca was ever able to
[41:54] walk because she never had a new birth.
[41:58] She never had deity living inside of her
[42:02] soul. You young sisters sitting here
[42:04] tonight that have repented and been
[42:06] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:10] and been filled with the Holy Ghost
[42:12] already your journey in Christ Jesus has
[42:16] brought you farther than Rebecca's did
[42:19] her entire spiritual walk with God. The
[42:23] angel of the Lord would have come and
[42:25] anointed her and that anointing would
[42:28] have pulled away from her. We don't know
[42:30] if she ever felt it again for the rest
[42:34] of her life, but here you sat tonight
[42:37] with deity living inside of your soul.
[42:42] We are a blessed people, are we not?
[42:45] Now, we've been looking at the matan and
[42:47] part of what the bridegroom sent for the
[42:52] bride. And as we look at it, the
[42:54] differentiation between the gifts
[42:57] signify position. and it signifies
[43:01] elevation. Now, I know a lot of folks
[43:03] have a hard time with election and
[43:05] choosing and predestination and
[43:08] fornowledge and all that sort of thing,
[43:10] but to me, I absolutely love it. I love
[43:14] it. I It's hard to explain, but I
[43:17] actually started studying predestination
[43:20] before I come to the message. Now, I
[43:23] don't know why because my uncle's church
[43:25] that I went to, they never taught it. I
[43:28] never heard one sermon all the years
[43:31] that I went there. All the years I went
[43:33] to the Pentecostal churches when I was
[43:36] not preaching. I never heard one sermon
[43:39] on election, predestination, fornowledge
[43:42] or any of that. But there was something
[43:45] in me that I started hungering for it
[43:48] and I started looking at it in the
[43:50] scripture. Now I realize of course what
[43:52] it was. It was the seed of God that
[43:55] began to call me to that spot. And I
[43:58] don't mind telling you after all these
[44:00] years in the message, it's still one of
[44:02] my favorites.
[44:04] I thank God for election. Don't you?
[44:06] Now, you know, I know that as I said,
[44:08] people many times they struggle with it.
[44:11] And and to them, to people without uh
[44:14] regeneration of the Holy Ghost, they
[44:16] look at it and seemingly take as if
[44:19] though it is unfair. But remember, it is
[44:23] God who does the selecting as it was
[44:27] with Rebecca. And Eleazar believed that
[44:31] God had a particular woman that was
[44:34] chosen for his master back home. Now, he
[44:38] did not have a manual. He did not have a
[44:40] book to go by. He did not give him a
[44:42] list of all the things above. But he was
[44:45] depending upon the Lord to lead him in
[44:49] the direction. and that whatever the
[44:51] spirit of God led him to do that this
[44:53] woman would have him her the matching
[44:57] traits and identity that the spirit of
[45:00] God had predetermined that would be the
[45:03] right type of a woman. Now, I know I've
[45:05] been saying it a lot, but let me say it
[45:07] again and reiterate it to you and make
[45:09] it plain. It's the same way with every
[45:12] one of you that are sitting here
[45:14] tonight. You young women, you young men
[45:16] that are not married, you're looking for
[45:17] a girlfriend or boyfriend and that
[45:20] you're at that age to where you have a
[45:21] desire for one and God wants you to have
[45:24] that. But remember, don't let the devil
[45:27] cheat you or shortch change you from
[45:30] that one that God has ordained for you.
[45:33] Now I'm not saying that you cannot have
[45:36] an element of happiness if you marry the
[45:39] wrong one. But you will never have the
[45:42] degree of happiness that you could have
[45:46] had in life if you will get the right
[45:49] one. So don't settle for less than the
[45:52] plan of God for your life. Can you
[45:54] parents say amen to that?
[45:56] Amen.
[45:57] Can you adults that are already married,
[45:59] can you say amen to that? Now election
[46:03] is all through the the Bible and it
[46:06] begins of course the New Testament and
[46:08] election is not a foundational doctrine
[46:12] that actually begins with the message in
[46:15] the last days. As a matter of fact,
[46:17] election was before the foundation of
[46:20] the world. But we see it displayed in
[46:23] the very first book of the Bible and we
[46:26] see it in the first couple of chapters
[46:29] of the very first book of the Bible
[46:31] which is gene ais or as we call it
[46:34] Genesis. Now God in his great attributes
[46:38] wanted to display the ability that he
[46:41] could choose for himself. And it's not,
[46:45] of course, that you and I have the
[46:47] ability to say, "Well, you can go. You
[46:49] can't go. You can go, you can't." It's
[46:51] totally out of our ability to choose,
[46:55] even for ourselves as well as others.
[46:58] I'm kind of glad cuz they don't tell
[47:00] what I choose left up to me.
[47:02] Now when you think about it that God in
[47:06] all of his greatness and whenever he
[47:08] began to to create the universe actually
[47:13] election was displayed in the creation
[47:16] of the universe and the planets and the
[47:19] stars. Now whenever father began to
[47:23] create the planets and he began to give
[47:26] them their glory. Now, as we stand down
[47:29] here and we look at at what the the
[47:32] scientists will call the elliptical
[47:35] plane. Now, the elliptical plane is that
[47:37] that we look out in the starry skies at
[47:40] night and we can look out through there.
[47:42] It's the way that we can see it looks
[47:44] like an horizon and we will see the
[47:46] zodiac. We'll see all the different
[47:48] stars and the elements. And with a
[47:50] telescope, of course, you can see more.
[47:52] But it's so designed that they they the
[47:56] signs would be visible but only from the
[47:59] earth. You see if we lived on Mars they
[48:02] would look totally different. So
[48:05] whenever he placed them out there he
[48:07] wrote his story in such a way that it
[48:11] would be viewed from this planet alone.
[48:15] So he chose this planet called earth.
[48:19] Now he gave it this name Earth. You know
[48:22] any other planets whose names are
[48:25] written in the Bible? Mars, Jupiter,
[48:30] Neptune, Saturn, Pluto? No, they're not.
[48:35] There's only one planet whose name is in
[48:38] the book of life in the Bible, and
[48:41] that's Earth. So now watch, we see God
[48:44] electing one planet out of the trillions
[48:48] of stars that are out there. God chose
[48:52] one planet and then God chose to put
[48:55] that planet in the elliptical plane and
[48:59] put it in this galaxies which is called
[49:02] our neighborhood. And in this
[49:04] neighborhood, God gave us a sun and God
[49:08] gave us a moon. And God gave us orbiting
[49:11] around all of that. And he put us within
[49:15] 93 million miles on the average is where
[49:18] the sun is from the earth. Now, had God
[49:21] put us a million miles closer, it would
[49:24] have been too hot and our lives would
[49:27] have never been able to exist on this
[49:29] planet. Neither would trees or plants or
[49:33] animals. Had God put us a million miles
[49:36] further out, 94 million miles, it would
[49:40] have been so cold, nothing could have
[49:42] ever lived. So, he put us exactly in the
[49:46] habitable zone where we would be able to
[49:50] live. We would have life. We would have
[49:52] water. We would have all the things that
[49:55] we need. That sounds like a loving
[49:57] father. So, what did he do? He displayed
[50:00] election to this one planet and it's the
[50:04] only one that has life on it.
[50:07] Right? There ain't another planet that
[50:09] has lakes, rivers, streams, mountains
[50:13] like we got. Oh my. Ain't that
[50:15] something? How did that happen? He
[50:18] elected this planet and gave it life.
[50:23] You see, he can give life to whomever
[50:27] and whatever he wants to give it to. So
[50:30] this ball of ice as it were, which is
[50:33] was it was in this pre-creation after it
[50:36] come into existence and before life come
[50:39] on it just a ball of ice and the spirit
[50:42] of God be to move upon it. election
[50:45] grace moved upon this ball of ice and as
[50:50] it began to fall and he placed it out
[50:53] there and placed it in the habitable
[50:56] zone. Now listen to me. The elect of
[50:59] God, the bride also live in the
[51:03] spiritual habitable zone of God's
[51:07] eternal life, Zoe. Now, there are other
[51:10] human beings that live outside the
[51:14] spiritual habitable zone. So, they're
[51:17] too cold to give birth to the word of
[51:20] God. Or they're too on fire for the
[51:24] world or for pleasures or whatever more.
[51:26] And they'll never give birth to the
[51:29] word. But yet, God chooses some to live
[51:33] in the habitable zone. They will have
[51:36] sunlight. They will have moonlight. They
[51:38] will have storms because they have an
[51:42] atmosphere. Now remember, the moon does
[51:45] not have an atmosphere like the earth.
[51:48] So when man would be able to walk on the
[51:51] moon years and years ago, do you realize
[51:54] there's no storms, there's no wind, and
[51:58] there's nothing there to take away those
[52:00] footprints. They're still there because
[52:03] there is no atmosphere. The rain cannot
[52:06] move through on the moon the way it did
[52:09] through here a few moments ago. There's
[52:11] no sunny days as it were. There's no 90
[52:15] degree weather because the moon was not
[52:18] chosen to live in a zone by which God
[52:22] would grant life. So there's no birds,
[52:25] there's no trees, there's no lakes,
[52:28] there's no streams, there's nothing like
[52:30] that. Yet it was chosen to be a
[52:34] satellite to the earth and God gave it
[52:38] great magnetic power within its
[52:41] creation. Now according to the molecular
[52:44] structure of course let me say it this
[52:46] way of the soul of the planet and
[52:49] according to how much iron ore and
[52:52] metallurgic things are on the core and
[52:54] on the inside each one of the planets
[52:57] will have so much drawing power. So God
[53:01] puts so much metallurgical drawing power
[53:04] in the moon that the moon being on an
[53:07] average of 267,000
[53:10] miles away from the earth. But whenever
[53:13] the moon gets in a certain cycle, the
[53:16] moon will control our our oceans, our
[53:21] seas, and all of that. You imagine over
[53:24] a quarter of a million miles away. And
[53:27] yet the moon controls our water and the
[53:31] tides. Why? Because God said it so.
[53:37] And then God placed our sun in such a
[53:40] spot for what? What's the sun there for?
[53:43] It's not there for Mars, brother D. It's
[53:46] not there for Jupiter. The sun is there
[53:49] because we needed it. And God created
[53:53] this thing which has been there for
[53:55] maybe aons of time. We don't know. And
[53:58] it's like this atomic ball of fire that
[54:02] is constantly generating at its
[54:04] temperature of course millions of
[54:06] degrees on the surface and be 93 million
[54:10] miles away. You imagine as hot as it was
[54:12] today 91 92 something like that. 93
[54:16] million miles away and it generating and
[54:20] pulsating that much sunlight and UV rays
[54:23] and heat coming out of it. And why did
[54:25] God do that? Cuz God didn't want you to
[54:28] live on a cold planet look like an
[54:30] Eskimo 24/7 off of your entire life. God
[54:34] wanted you to have nice warm sunny days.
[54:39] That sounds like a loving father to me.
[54:41] Now what is he doing? So he elected this
[54:45] planet to bear life. Now Mars might get
[54:48] jealous if it wants to, but its jealousy
[54:51] will never bring the attention and the
[54:55] attribute of God's love toward Mars. You
[54:58] follow me? Say, so you see, God chose
[55:01] this planet. Why, brother Donnie? I
[55:03] don't have a clue. It's certainly not
[55:06] the biggest one. my there's many out
[55:08] there that's much bigger than we are and
[55:11] ones that have more diverse colors and
[55:13] all kinds of things but for whatever
[55:15] reason this little tiny blue dot you've
[55:19] seen the picture I know that the
[55:21] astronauts when they got so far out and
[55:23] into space and then they turned around
[55:25] and they took the picture and there they
[55:27] were miles and miles and miles away and
[55:30] here was their home and what was it a
[55:33] little tiny blue dot right out the
[55:37] middle of nowhere and yet the Lord God
[55:40] elected this planet to bear life. And
[55:43] not only that, it is going to be the
[55:46] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[55:48] and the earthly bride.
[55:50] So you say, why in the world would the
[55:53] great eternal who made this little tiny
[55:57] thing not just put his love on it, but
[55:59] want to come down here and take his own
[56:03] human body from this particular planet?
[56:06] Why not Uranus? Why not Saturn? Why not
[56:09] Pluto? Because God's election is written
[56:12] in the heavens. Now watch. So God then
[56:16] ordained this one planet to have life
[56:19] and water and animals and plants and
[56:22] organisms and on and on and on we could
[56:24] go. And the only one that does. So then
[56:28] when the Lord God made it and the spirit
[56:30] of God began to move, the logos of God
[56:32] took it as it was in the middle of your
[56:34] microwave, sisters, that little tray
[56:36] that turns around and around and around
[56:38] in your microwave. And the logos of God
[56:41] let this come out and whenever it
[56:43] dropped down and he hung it there next
[56:45] to the sun and the prophet said he began
[56:47] to just spin it around. So when he
[56:50] started spinning it around, then the
[56:52] glaciers began to melt. And what it
[56:55] done, it carved out the Grand Canyon and
[56:57] carved out all these different places as
[56:59] it began to melt. And then he gathered
[57:01] the waters together. And he separated
[57:04] and called a great gulf up over the
[57:06] atmosphere. And he caused this great
[57:08] thing to come in to beautiful,
[57:10] beautiful, glorified state. Now watch.
[57:13] Then God chooses one particular area on
[57:18] the earth. So God chose one particular
[57:22] spot near Egypt and then he gave this
[57:25] spot a name. Now watch when God chooses
[57:29] then God names the thing he chooses.
[57:33] Now watch it. So he don't just call it
[57:36] uh whatever. You're you're a thing,
[57:38] you're an it, you're a No, but God gives
[57:42] it a name. So God called a certain spot
[57:45] now on the earth Eden. And then Eden was
[57:50] selected out from all of the places on
[57:54] the face of the earth. You imagine there
[57:56] was the aderondex, there was the the
[57:59] plateau and the great seven sisters in
[58:01] Africa, all the great mountains of the
[58:03] earth and all. But yet God chose that
[58:06] particular place there which the Jews
[58:09] call the navl of the earth. The center,
[58:13] the navl of the earth. And God chose
[58:16] that particular place and he called it
[58:19] Eden. Then watch him keep on as he
[58:22] narrows down his election. Then God
[58:26] names another place and he calls it the
[58:30] garden of Eden. Now watch what he's
[58:31] doing. He's choosing. choosing,
[58:34] choosing, narrowing it down, getting
[58:36] smaller, smaller, and smaller as he
[58:39] goes. Now, that's God's choice. You and
[58:42] I have nothing to say about that. So, he
[58:44] chooses with this very small planet in
[58:48] comparison to a lot of the rest of them
[58:50] out there. So, he started out with a
[58:52] very small planet. Then, he chooses a
[58:55] small location. Then he chooses a
[58:58] smaller something smaller than that
[59:01] called the garden of Eden. Then God
[59:04] decides that he's going to make a man.
[59:06] Well, God does not reach down and and
[59:09] get dust when he's going to make his
[59:10] flesh body out of the garden of Eden,
[59:13] but rather God made man from the Eden
[59:17] dust and then brought him into the
[59:20] garden of Eden. You see, Adam was not
[59:22] made in the garden of Eden, but rather
[59:24] he was placed in the garden of Eden. So
[59:28] what do we see? God choosing, choosing,
[59:31] choosing election. And the church said,
[59:35] now whenever God starts a principle that
[59:39] issues from his eternal essence, you can
[59:42] always go back to that. It will never
[59:45] alter or change. Now there are time
[59:48] attributes that God has that he will
[59:51] express in time. They are necessary and
[59:53] essential for certain things in time to
[59:56] prove. Many of those of course we will
[59:59] not need in eternity. The blood one day
[1:00:02] will no longer be needed.
[1:00:04] You realize one day you will no longer
[1:00:07] need faith.
[1:00:09] Faith will become sight. So you won't
[1:00:13] need faith. you will already be in that
[1:00:16] visible realm with him, but as he brings
[1:00:19] it into view. Now, we see God then as he
[1:00:23] calls a man by the name of Abram, one
[1:00:27] man out of all the inhabitants of the
[1:00:29] earth and then God brings it on down. So
[1:00:33] later, he's named Abraham and he goes
[1:00:36] from Abraham to Isaac. Now, Isaac is not
[1:00:39] the only son Abraham has, but God
[1:00:41] chooses Isaac over his halfbrother. So,
[1:00:44] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Judah, on
[1:00:50] down, on down, on down, on down. So,
[1:00:52] where do we see election begin? In the
[1:00:56] book of Genuses.
[1:00:58] Genuses. Look at the word Genesis. J E N
[1:01:01] E S I S. It's gan seed or seed chapter
[1:01:06] of the Bible. Now God is displaying that
[1:01:10] election. So to me, if he starts it
[1:01:12] there and he makes his first man and his
[1:01:14] woman, then it will be something that he
[1:01:17] will want to hand down to his elected
[1:01:20] bride. It was already in his existence
[1:01:24] to elect and choose. So if he chooses,
[1:01:28] he could make the horse and make the
[1:01:30] horse to where oh my, you'll he'll be an
[1:01:32] animal that will be admired and then
[1:01:34] he'll make other animals that you eat
[1:01:37] them. They're not admired very much
[1:01:38] except for their flavor. But others you
[1:01:41] just look at them, look at the lion. You
[1:01:42] don't ever harness him up, have him to
[1:01:44] pull a plow. Good luck with that. You
[1:01:46] you don't do a tiger that way. Certain
[1:01:49] ones are not made for not ones of labor,
[1:01:52] an ox and different ones down through
[1:01:54] the ages, they've been made that way.
[1:01:56] And there's certain birds that are very
[1:01:58] humble, their plumage, not very
[1:02:00] beautiful and all. Others that are
[1:02:01] absolutely breathtaking. And you say,
[1:02:04] why would he do that? He is a god of
[1:02:07] diversity. To some, he would give more
[1:02:10] glory. To some, he would make their
[1:02:12] songs prettier than others. He would
[1:02:15] make their cries. Some of them are very
[1:02:18] pitiful, you know, and that some of them
[1:02:20] they're so beautiful in their songs or
[1:02:23] like people when they're singing. And
[1:02:24] why would God do it that way? Because
[1:02:27] he's a God of variety. So some he chose
[1:02:31] to be more beautiful than others. Some
[1:02:33] he chose to be more gifted than others.
[1:02:36] So they just sing and sing. I know y'all
[1:02:38] think I'm a nut and I probably am. But
[1:02:40] I've got a lot of song birds around our
[1:02:42] house there where Carol and I live. And
[1:02:44] I love it whenever they come. I hate it
[1:02:46] whenever they're gone in the fall and
[1:02:47] the winter time. And I look forward to
[1:02:49] in the summertime. And there's certain
[1:02:50] ones that we've had there and they come
[1:02:52] back, you know, every year. Maybe not so
[1:02:54] much that particular one, but they will
[1:02:56] sing certain certain songs. And I listen
[1:02:59] to them. I've got one I call a Spencer
[1:03:01] bird because it sounds like he's saying
[1:03:03] Spencer, Spencer, Spencer. And I've got
[1:03:05] different ones and you you can hear them
[1:03:07] and they're just saying it. You mean
[1:03:09] y'all don't pay no attention to song
[1:03:10] birds? Why do you think they gave that
[1:03:12] song? They're not singing to one
[1:03:14] another. The Lord God knew what that
[1:03:16] would do to our hearts if we just
[1:03:18] recognize it. And you look at all these
[1:03:20] things that he put upon the earth. Have
[1:03:22] you ever seen the cardinal my with his
[1:03:24] beautiful red feathers? Have you ever
[1:03:26] seen him toing the mirror around taking
[1:03:27] selfies of himself? He don't realize
[1:03:30] he's that beautiful. Who? Why? God gave
[1:03:32] him that for us as his human children
[1:03:35] that we then are surrounded by election
[1:03:39] of the mercy and the grace of God. So
[1:03:42] God chose us by which he would be able
[1:03:44] to not only share his glory but we would
[1:03:47] also bear his glory. So Abraham, Isaac,
[1:03:51] Jacob, Joseph, Judah on down then of
[1:03:54] course to the line of the tribe of
[1:03:56] Judah. And then we have the Lord Jesus
[1:03:58] when he come to the earth. What did he
[1:04:00] do? He chose him certain disciples and
[1:04:03] they were all chosen to follow him. But
[1:04:06] there were three that were chosen of the
[1:04:09] 12 that the New Testament mentions more
[1:04:12] than any rest of them. How many knows
[1:04:14] who they are? Peter, James, and John.
[1:04:17] And yet John out of the three had a
[1:04:20] special intimate walk with the Lord
[1:04:23] Jesus which seemed more profound than
[1:04:27] even the others. My my I I I I would say
[1:04:31] some of the brothers really got jealous
[1:04:32] of all that, wouldn't you? Every time
[1:04:34] Jesus would go up on top of the
[1:04:35] mountain, you might as well, well, you
[1:04:37] guys might as well go. You're his pets.
[1:04:39] You know, Peter, James, and John. Here
[1:04:40] they go. Peter, James, and John. They
[1:04:42] was the one saw the maiden raised from
[1:04:44] the dead. Peter, James, and John. this
[1:04:46] Peter, James, and John that you know how
[1:04:48] human beings are, they probably had some
[1:04:50] real issues. But when you realize this
[1:04:52] is part of God's mercy, but with that
[1:04:55] divine favor, always keep this in mind,
[1:04:58] there comes a tremendous price to pay
[1:05:02] for such favor.
[1:05:04] And God has reflected his election down
[1:05:08] through the ages. Now, whenever we come
[1:05:11] to the New Testament, it's beyond me
[1:05:13] that people would think that when we
[1:05:16] come to the New Testament that God lays
[1:05:19] election, fornowledge, predestination,
[1:05:22] and all that totally aside because we're
[1:05:25] coming unto the dispensation of grace.
[1:05:28] But is that exactly the truth?
[1:05:31] Come on.
[1:05:32] Can we read some scriptures tonight?
[1:05:35] Now, for the folks that say they have
[1:05:39] left the message, whatever that means,
[1:05:42] let me as we read these things tonight,
[1:05:46] let me bring it to your attention.
[1:05:49] Are they also leaving these things that
[1:05:53] we're going to read?
[1:05:56] Romans chapter 8 verse 33.
[1:06:00] Who shall lay anything to the charge
[1:06:06] of God's elect? Now look at this word.
[1:06:09] I'm going to give you a bunch of the
[1:06:10] meanings of these words tonight because
[1:06:12] the meanings hold the mystery of their
[1:06:15] power. Now watch. Equitus,
[1:06:18] chosen, picked out, chosen by God.
[1:06:24] choice
[1:06:26] select
[1:06:27] the best of its kind or class.
[1:06:33] Excellent preeminence. Excellence
[1:06:36] preeminent applied to certain
[1:06:41] individual
[1:06:43] Christians. Now you'll find this in your
[1:06:44] songs and gardens if you want to look it
[1:06:46] up. Applied to certain Christian
[1:06:49] individual, you mean not all Christians,
[1:06:52] right?
[1:06:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:00] Oh my. Now notice that Paul said, "Who
[1:07:04] shall lay anything then to the charge of
[1:07:07] God's elect?" This is one of the gifts
[1:07:09] that the bridegroom gives to his beloved
[1:07:13] bride, that she is elected.
[1:07:18] Oh yeah.
[1:07:18] And the church said,
[1:07:20] Colossians 3:12, "Put on therefore as
[1:07:25] the elect of God." Now, I hope you
[1:07:28] understand that everybody
[1:07:31] will not be able to attain to all of
[1:07:35] these scriptures tonight that I'm going
[1:07:37] to share with you unless they are
[1:07:40] created for the same divine purpose to
[1:07:43] fit into the chosen or the called.
[1:07:47] Not saying they won't be saved. There'll
[1:07:49] be millions of them and they'll
[1:07:51] certainly outnumber the bride by far.
[1:07:54] And yet they will come up and come
[1:07:56] through the tribulation period and be
[1:07:58] judged and so on. But there's certain
[1:08:01] attributes and characteristics and
[1:08:03] traits that the bridegroom imparts as he
[1:08:06] did to the earth, as he did to Eden, as
[1:08:10] he did to the Garden of Eden. And he had
[1:08:12] to narrow it down to a handful of dirt
[1:08:16] in all of the country of Egyp Eden or
[1:08:19] that region, however big it was. And he
[1:08:21] had to go down and isolate to a certain
[1:08:25] pile or a certain, you know, perimeter
[1:08:27] of dust in order to make Adam's body. To
[1:08:31] me, I see election, election, election.
[1:08:34] It's the same way with the bride of
[1:08:37] Jesus Christ setting on the same pew.
[1:08:41] Some of you were with your mother, your
[1:08:43] father, your loved ones, whatever more.
[1:08:46] And God may have called you and left the
[1:08:48] rest of your family sitting there.
[1:08:51] Oh, I know people saying, "Well, if I'm
[1:08:53] elected, I'm going to claim my brother."
[1:08:55] I'll tell you, friend, that's not left
[1:08:56] up to us. Abraham did not pray that God
[1:09:01] would make Lot elect. He prayed God
[1:09:04] would save him.
[1:09:06] And God did. God saved him from the
[1:09:10] destruction that come to Sodom, but he
[1:09:13] never was elect. He was always a penny.
[1:09:18] He could never be a silver dollar.
[1:09:21] Now look, Paul again put on therefore as
[1:09:24] the elect of God. as the elect of God.
[1:09:28] Not just save people. As the elect of
[1:09:32] God, holy and beloved, holy and beloved,
[1:09:37] bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness
[1:09:41] of mind, meekness, longsuffering. Now,
[1:09:44] who is this verse attributed to? The
[1:09:49] elect of God. Will everybody have the
[1:09:53] humbleness of mind that the bride of
[1:09:56] Christ has? No sir, they won't. Will
[1:09:59] they have the proper view of themselves?
[1:10:02] They will not. This is attributed to the
[1:10:05] elect of God. Just like the earth living
[1:10:08] in the habitable zone, what I'm going to
[1:10:10] describe to you tonight by the help of
[1:10:12] the Lord is your habitable zone. This is
[1:10:15] where God wants you to live. So, as the
[1:10:19] elect of God, then Paul commands us for
[1:10:23] us to put this on. Wow. Notice how he
[1:10:26] says it. Put on therefore as the elect
[1:10:30] of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
[1:10:33] mercies. You mean to tell me there's
[1:10:36] something I've got to do? As the elect
[1:10:39] of God, I'm supposed to put this on?
[1:10:42] Well, you can see right now why a lot of
[1:10:44] folks will never do it. because the way
[1:10:46] they look at the cross, the cross does
[1:10:48] everything. They don't have to do
[1:10:50] nothing. Well, maybe for the category
[1:10:52] they fit in, that might work for them,
[1:10:55] but it won't work for me.
[1:10:56] Amen.
[1:10:57] And I hope and pray to God it won't work
[1:10:59] for you either.
[1:11:00] You see, for those around this message
[1:11:02] that think they can live the same way
[1:11:05] about a denominational life, if they if
[1:11:07] they don't ever change from that, it
[1:11:09] proves they're not the elect of God.
[1:11:11] Because the elect of God, they live in
[1:11:15] the habitable zone of God by which they
[1:11:18] are the recipients of life. What good
[1:11:21] would it have done to plant grass seed
[1:11:23] and apple trees and peaches and all that
[1:11:25] on Mars? What good would it have done
[1:11:28] God to say, "Let there be seed over on
[1:11:30] Neptune? Let there be this over there."
[1:11:32] It doesn't live in the habitable zone.
[1:11:35] So therefore, the temperature would not
[1:11:37] match where it's at. It don't do no good
[1:11:40] friends to try to bring this person to
[1:11:42] the word and that person to the word and
[1:11:44] that person to the word. That's why some
[1:11:46] of them can go for a long time and they
[1:11:49] try to give shelter to that word. But if
[1:11:52] they themselves are not a predestinated
[1:11:54] habitable zone, they'll never be able to
[1:11:57] give birth to the word. They can't do
[1:11:59] it.
[1:12:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:03] Oh my. Thank God. Notice put on
[1:12:05] therefore as the elect of God, holy and
[1:12:07] beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,
[1:12:10] humbleness of might, meekness,
[1:12:13] longsuffering. Titus 1:1. Paul, a
[1:12:16] servant of God and an apostle of Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ according to the faith
[1:12:22] of God's elect,
[1:12:24] not every Christian.
[1:12:27] Now watch how the New Testament
[1:12:30] segregates and pulls a certain category
[1:12:34] of people out from the rest of
[1:12:37] Christianity.
[1:12:39] But you see friends through the church
[1:12:40] ages this was lost.
[1:12:43] Calvin comes along and he begins to read
[1:12:46] it and then what does he do? He goes to
[1:12:49] seed and Calvinism of course goes to
[1:12:53] that seed core and when it does then had
[1:12:57] to come the Methodist and the
[1:12:59] Pentecostals and all that and then what
[1:13:01] did they do? They went from the
[1:13:03] Calvinistic ditch until the legalistic
[1:13:06] ditch.
[1:13:09] Does it really matter which ditch you're
[1:13:10] in? You're still ditch driving.
[1:13:13] The road's a whole lot smoother. You
[1:13:16] know, anybody ever run off the road into
[1:13:17] a ditch? It ain't fun, is it? It's not
[1:13:20] very nice. It's not very pleasant. The
[1:13:22] ditch ain't paved. The ditch ain't made
[1:13:24] for driving. Yet, a lot of us, that's
[1:13:25] where we've lived a lot of our lives.
[1:13:27] Some of you come from Baptist, you come
[1:13:29] to the message, you go from one side to
[1:13:31] the other. Believe me, I know. I come
[1:13:33] from Pentecost. And when I come from
[1:13:35] Pentecost, I was so fed up with a lot of
[1:13:37] the Pentecostal stuff. I come out of the
[1:13:39] Pentecostal ditch and went from there
[1:13:41] into a message ditch and got to a place
[1:13:43] I didn't believe in harding nothing of
[1:13:45] the supernatural for a long time. But
[1:13:47] thank God he finally got my hard head
[1:13:50] and my knad out of that ditch and set me
[1:13:53] up on the way. And it's a way of
[1:13:55] holiness. Aren't you glad you're on the
[1:13:57] way tonight? Thank you.
[1:13:59] Now watch Paul again says Paul a servant
[1:14:02] of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:14:04] according to the faith of God's elect
[1:14:08] and the acknowledging of the truth is
[1:14:12] after godliness. Peter again now notice
[1:14:16] how the apostles believe this.
[1:14:19] 1 Peter 1:2, elect
[1:14:25] according to the fornowledge of God the
[1:14:27] Father through sanctification of the
[1:14:30] Spirit unto obedience
[1:14:34] and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
[1:14:37] Christ. Grace be unto you and peace be
[1:14:42] multiplied. And to whom was this
[1:14:44] addressed?
[1:14:45] Elect.
[1:14:48] elect chosen. Second John 1:1, the elder
[1:14:54] unto
[1:14:55] the elect
[1:14:58] lady.
[1:14:59] I hope that's who I'm speaking to
[1:15:01] tonight.
[1:15:02] The elder unto the elect lady and her
[1:15:07] children.
[1:15:09] Huh?
[1:15:11] So, we've got an elect lady and she has
[1:15:14] children.
[1:15:17] whom I love in the truth. And not only
[1:15:21] I, but also all they that have known the
[1:15:25] truth. So, is election part of God's
[1:15:30] way?
[1:15:32] How many believe it? Let me see your
[1:15:33] hands. Let every devil out of hell say
[1:15:35] you're voting tonight.
[1:15:37] How many believes in election?
[1:15:40] It is not a doctrine that was founded by
[1:15:43] William Mary and Brennham. That's right.
[1:15:45] It was founded by Almighty God.
[1:15:50] Notice again in Romans 9:10. Not only
[1:15:53] this, but when Rebecca ah here we go.
[1:15:57] Here's the past now of the young lady
[1:15:59] that we're reading about. when Rebecca
[1:16:02] also had conceived by one, even by our
[1:16:07] father Isaac. For the children being not
[1:16:10] yet born, neither having done either
[1:16:13] good or evil, that the purpose of God
[1:16:18] according to
[1:16:22] ah so the purpose of God is not
[1:16:24] according to free moral agency. I know
[1:16:27] some of you all cherish your free moral
[1:16:29] agency. Mine's got me into the most of
[1:16:32] my problems in life. And I'll go ahead
[1:16:35] and say for you, it's your free moral
[1:16:36] agency that's made a mess out of many of
[1:16:38] your lives. Not election. Free moral
[1:16:41] agency got us in the mess. Election got
[1:16:44] us out.
[1:16:45] Hallelujah. Free moral agency got
[1:16:48] Abraham to a spot. He was about to give
[1:16:50] his wife away. Come on, somebody. Free
[1:16:53] moral agency got Moses into the spot he
[1:16:56] was in, but God brought him out. Free
[1:16:58] moral agency got Isaac into the same
[1:17:01] spot he lied about his wife. Free moral
[1:17:04] agency got brother Brandham into the
[1:17:06] spot that he didn't go when God called
[1:17:08] him to do. But God could not take
[1:17:11] somebody else and say, "William Brandom,
[1:17:13] because you failed me miserably, I'm
[1:17:15] going to get somebody else to take your
[1:17:17] place." There wasn't another man on the
[1:17:19] earth that could take his place. And let
[1:17:21] me bring it on down to you tonight.
[1:17:23] There ain't another mortal on the earth
[1:17:25] that can take yours. They ain't nobody
[1:17:27] can take your place. But brother Donnie,
[1:17:29] I've made so many mistakes. Yeah, join
[1:17:32] the family. So have all the rest of us.
[1:17:34] But that's the great thing about
[1:17:36] election. Hallelujah. That we make a
[1:17:39] mess out of it. And the grace of God
[1:17:41] comes right back in and says, "Devil,
[1:17:43] watch this. They made a mess and you
[1:17:46] made a mess. But watch me take that mess
[1:17:49] that you make and watch me turn it
[1:17:52] around because this is my son or my
[1:17:55] daughter that I elected before the
[1:17:57] foundation of the world.
[1:18:05] I imagine the devil hates election.
[1:18:09] I guess I just don't understand why a
[1:18:11] lot of message preachers do. Oh,
[1:18:15] I hope that don't mean they're on the
[1:18:16] wrong side.
[1:18:18] Now, notice
[1:18:21] for the children being not yet born,
[1:18:23] neither having done any good or evil.
[1:18:26] So, it was not based upon them at all.
[1:18:29] That the purpose of God according to
[1:18:32] election. Now, look at this word. It's a
[1:18:35] little different Greek word, which of
[1:18:38] course has a different meaning. chosen
[1:18:41] the act of picking out
[1:18:45] choosing used of the act of God's
[1:18:53] will.
[1:18:54] Ah,
[1:18:56] now this is the free will that I am.
[1:19:02] Oh, hallelujah. Boy, the free will
[1:19:05] Baptist would have a hard time with the
[1:19:07] meaning of this word, wouldn't they? But
[1:19:09] the free will bride don't because I'm
[1:19:12] not bride by my free will. I'm bride by
[1:19:15] his free will. That's exactly right. The
[1:19:18] earth is not the earth because the earth
[1:19:20] said, "Father, father, let it be me. Let
[1:19:22] me have life. Let me have streams. Let
[1:19:25] me have rivers. Let me have beautiful.
[1:19:27] Let me have the Amazon. Let me have the
[1:19:29] Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the
[1:19:30] Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea. Let me
[1:19:32] have it, Father. Let me have Alaska. Let
[1:19:35] me have beautiful Tennessee. Let me have
[1:19:36] the Blue Ridge. Let me have all that."
[1:19:38] Please, Father, please, please, please
[1:19:39] let me have it. It was God who
[1:19:41] predetermined and put all this beauty.
[1:19:44] I'll tell you, we live in a very
[1:19:45] beautiful planet, don't we? I've been
[1:19:47] around the earth, I'll tell you, and
[1:19:48] seen a lot of it. If it's this beautiful
[1:19:50] now, I cannot imagine what it's going to
[1:19:53] be like when it takes on its eating
[1:19:55] beauty again. It's the same way with you
[1:19:57] and I. If we are the beautiful sons and
[1:20:00] daughters of God in this fallen sake,
[1:20:02] can you imagine what it's going to be
[1:20:04] when we walk out of that 18 years old?
[1:20:07] I'm one year closer to being 18.
[1:20:11] Oh, you say you're farther away. No, I
[1:20:13] ain't neither. I'm closer now than I've
[1:20:15] ever been. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] Aren't you glad, brother D? We're closer
[1:20:21] every time my heart beats. I'm closer to
[1:20:24] being an 18year-old boy again.
[1:20:28] Oh, glory to God. The act of picking
[1:20:32] out, choosing.
[1:20:35] Again, you can find this in your
[1:20:37] strongest concordance.
[1:20:40] Used of the act of God's free will
[1:20:45] by which before the foundation of the
[1:20:49] world, he decreed
[1:20:53] the blessings.
[1:20:55] Oh no,
[1:20:59] to certain
[1:21:03] persons. Amen.
[1:21:06] Sort of like a certain planet
[1:21:08] and a certain region
[1:21:10] and a certain garden
[1:21:12] and a certain man by the name of Abraham
[1:21:13] and another by the name of Isaac.
[1:21:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:20] What the bride's matan would have to
[1:21:24] have this gift.
[1:21:26] Amen.
[1:21:29] Notice this. By free will, God's free
[1:21:32] will. by which before the foundation of
[1:21:34] the world he decreed his blessings to
[1:21:37] certain persons.
[1:21:39] The decree made from choice
[1:21:43] by which he determined
[1:21:45] to bless certain persons
[1:21:49] through Christ
[1:21:51] by grace.
[1:21:55] As a matter of fact, the prophet said
[1:21:58] that Esau was a much better man
[1:22:02] than Jacob was.
[1:22:06] Took care of his daddy. Done this and
[1:22:08] that and the other.
[1:22:11] Oh my. Some of y'all still got a little
[1:22:12] bit of free will Baptist in you, ain't
[1:22:14] you?
[1:22:16] Oh my goodness. Notice that the purpose
[1:22:19] of God according to election might stand
[1:22:26] not of works
[1:22:29] but of him that call us. It was said
[1:22:34] unto her who Rebecca.
[1:22:38] Now you imagine this. It was a great
[1:22:40] revelation, but it must have been
[1:22:42] somewhat burdensome
[1:22:45] cuz before her boys was ever born,
[1:22:48] it was told to her, "I've chosen one
[1:22:52] above the other."
[1:22:55] I love one of your boys and I hate the
[1:22:58] other.
[1:22:59] Now, not hatred in the way that you and
[1:23:00] I think. You look at the Hebrew word, it
[1:23:03] actually means love less.
[1:23:08] God loves the church.
[1:23:14] I love all you sisters here tonight,
[1:23:18] but there's one
[1:23:20] I love a whole lot more than all the
[1:23:21] rest of you put together.
[1:23:23] And brothers, if you don't feel that way
[1:23:24] about your wife, come here. I'm going
[1:23:26] cast that devil off of you.
[1:23:29] No. That is that the way I should love
[1:23:31] my wife?
[1:23:33] Should I love my wife more than your
[1:23:35] wife? You need to vote me out if I
[1:23:37] don't. Why? Because she is my wife. And
[1:23:41] yet I love our our wives, our sisters,
[1:23:43] our daughters, all that in the Lord. I
[1:23:45] love him. But yet, my there's something
[1:23:48] about the love I have for my wife. And
[1:23:51] God so loved the world.
[1:23:54] child never said God so loved the bride
[1:23:59] but the world the cosmos that he gave
[1:24:02] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:24:05] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:24:06] have everlasting life for God sent not
[1:24:08] his son into the world to condemn the
[1:24:11] world but that the world through him
[1:24:14] might be saved might
[1:24:16] not would be
[1:24:22] but Jesus was on a secret mission
[1:24:25] He come to seek and to save that which
[1:24:30] was lost.
[1:24:34] Notice
[1:24:36] Romans 9:12.
[1:24:38] It was said unto her, "The elder shall
[1:24:42] serve the younger. As it is written,
[1:24:45] Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I
[1:24:49] hated."
[1:24:50] What shall we say then? Same thing a lot
[1:24:54] of people say today is there
[1:24:55] unrighteousness with God? But they don't
[1:24:58] read the rest of this verse. God forbid.
[1:25:02] Even so, oh my Romans 11:5.
[1:25:06] Even so then at this present time also
[1:25:09] there is a remnant
[1:25:13] according to the election of grace. Oh
[1:25:16] my goodness. So you mean election works
[1:25:19] with grace?
[1:25:22] election of grace.
[1:25:27] Verse six, and if by grace and it is no
[1:25:30] more works, otherwise grace is no more
[1:25:33] of grace. But if it be of works, and it
[1:25:35] is no more grace, otherwise work is no
[1:25:37] more work. What then? Israel hath not
[1:25:40] obtained that which he seeketh for, but
[1:25:43] the election
[1:25:45] hath obtained it, and the rest
[1:25:50] were blinded.
[1:25:53] On what principle? Election.
[1:26:01] Well, brother Donnie, what if I'm bri?
[1:26:03] But if you want to be saved, you can be.
[1:26:07] I don't want to go to hell. I don't want
[1:26:09] to go to hell. You don't have to.
[1:26:11] Right.
[1:26:11] If you go to hell, you choose to.
[1:26:15] If you want to be saved, you can be
[1:26:19] saved.
[1:26:21] You can live a a godly life as far as
[1:26:24] that grace will allow you and leads you
[1:26:27] to. And the church said,
[1:26:30] "Who are these?" John said. And John
[1:26:32] didn't know who they were. These are
[1:26:34] those are they that came out of great
[1:26:37] tribulation. And they have washed the
[1:26:39] robes in the blood of the lamb and
[1:26:40] they've made them white. Why do they go
[1:26:43] through the tribulation? Because are not
[1:26:45] not under the full atonement. The full
[1:26:48] atonement of Christ's blood will speak
[1:26:50] of total innocence for those who are
[1:26:52] under. If every church member is under
[1:26:54] the blood of Jesus by being saved, there
[1:26:57] can be no Christians in the tribulation
[1:26:59] period.
[1:26:59] That's right.
[1:27:01] But they think
[1:27:04] they're fully under it. But they reject
[1:27:07] the word by the way to get to the full
[1:27:10] atonement. Oh, thank God for his grace.
[1:27:14] Notice then in first Thessalonians
[1:27:16] chapter 1 verse4, knowing brethren,
[1:27:19] beloved,
[1:27:21] your
[1:27:23] election
[1:27:25] of God.
[1:27:27] Now, here's another little package I
[1:27:29] found this evening. Now, I thought I was
[1:27:31] ready to preach tonight, but late this
[1:27:35] evening, the Lord come down in my study
[1:27:38] where I was at, and he started exploding
[1:27:41] these little bombs all around me. And I
[1:27:43] got to look at that word and looking at
[1:27:45] that word and looking at that word. So,
[1:27:46] I had to redo my sermon of what I
[1:27:49] thought I was going to what I thought I
[1:27:50] was going to bring tonight. So,
[1:27:51] apparently, there must be at least one
[1:27:53] person here tonight that needs this
[1:27:55] besides me. Amen.
[1:27:57] Another one of these little packages
[1:28:00] that I like to unwrap for you, Miss
[1:28:02] Rebecca.
[1:28:05] Is this little gift called
[1:28:07] predestinated?
[1:28:09] Now, this and yours got me in trouble
[1:28:11] all over the world,
[1:28:14] but it's also got me out a whole lot
[1:28:16] more trouble than I've ever got into.
[1:28:17] Amen.
[1:28:19] According as he hath chosen us in him
[1:28:25] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:28:29] we should be holy.
[1:28:34] Can't you see why Leodysia's church
[1:28:38] cannot fulfill this? They reject the
[1:28:42] entirety
[1:28:43] of holiness unto the Lord.
[1:28:46] As a man would say to his espoused, "Be
[1:28:50] thou sanctified unto me according to the
[1:28:54] law of God, Moses and of Israel,
[1:28:58] sanctified unto me." So the woman would
[1:29:02] be flirting with any other man. She was
[1:29:04] considered legally obligated to that
[1:29:07] man. And when they were engaged,
[1:29:10] but less they want to live the way they
[1:29:13] want to live, dress the way. Oh, what
[1:29:14] difference does it make the way you
[1:29:15] look? Why a little bit of makeup? Don't
[1:29:17] hurry and sing. My goodness, a little
[1:29:19] bit of paint helps an old barn. I agree.
[1:29:21] Sisters, are you calling your face an
[1:29:23] old barn face?
[1:29:25] You think I need did a little bit of
[1:29:26] makeup? Think you need to wear your
[1:29:28] dresses a little bit tighter to make
[1:29:30] yourself a little more sexy?
[1:29:32] Who you trying to impress? You want to
[1:29:34] be belong to a whouse?
[1:29:36] You want to be a prostitute or you want
[1:29:38] to be a daughter of God? Can't be boss.
[1:29:42] Remember that old mother
[1:29:45] Tell me how you can be even a foolish
[1:29:47] virgin and belong to a system
[1:29:51] when the rapture takes place and your
[1:29:53] name is found on that stalk book,
[1:29:56] you're lost. Amen.
[1:30:00] How in the world can the foolish virgin
[1:30:03] come out of a system? It's
[1:30:06] impossible for you to be a virgin and be
[1:30:10] a
[1:30:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:14] Now notice as he has chosen us in him
[1:30:16] before the foundation of the world that
[1:30:18] we should be holy and without blame
[1:30:22] before him in love having predestinated
[1:30:27] us. Amen.
[1:30:31] predestinated
[1:30:33] us
[1:30:35] determine before
[1:30:38] to predetermine
[1:30:41] decide beforehand
[1:30:44] in the New Testament of God
[1:30:47] decreeing from eternity
[1:30:51] to forord ordain a point beforehand
[1:30:57] and word of life church said
[1:31:00] praise Praise be to God. I'm so glad I
[1:31:04] believe in predestination. I'd be a
[1:31:06] mighty discouraged pastor tonight if I
[1:31:08] didn't believe in it. I don't mind
[1:31:09] telling you. Notice then it was God who
[1:31:14] did it. Having predestinated us. So,
[1:31:17] we're not just predestinated to be
[1:31:18] saved. We're not just predestinated to
[1:31:21] come to church, but we're predestinated
[1:31:24] to the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:31:27] Christ to himself according to our works
[1:31:31] and by paying tithes and going to church
[1:31:33] and helping the widow.
[1:31:35] According to what? The good pleasure of
[1:31:39] his will. Oh, look at this word again.
[1:31:42] You see, it was God's will, not yours,
[1:31:45] not mine.
[1:31:47] God's will. Amen.
[1:31:50] Oh, praise be to God. Look at verse six.
[1:31:53] To the praise of the glory of his grace.
[1:31:57] So you see, predestination does not
[1:32:00] conflict with grace. It complements it
[1:32:04] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:32:08] wherein he has made us. Another little
[1:32:11] package with a bow on it for it,
[1:32:13] Rebecca. He has made us accepted in the
[1:32:17] beloved,
[1:32:19] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:32:21] blood, the forgiveness of sin, according
[1:32:24] to the riches of his grace, wherein he
[1:32:28] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[1:32:30] and prudence, having made known unto us
[1:32:34] the mystery of his will, according to
[1:32:38] his good pleasure, which he hath
[1:32:41] purposed in himself. out.
[1:32:45] So, how many of these good people do you
[1:32:47] work with have a clue
[1:32:50] about the mystery of God?
[1:32:53] And some of your sisters want to marry
[1:32:55] such a man that make that your husband.
[1:32:57] Some of your brothers want to marry such
[1:32:58] a woman
[1:33:00] that has no clue of what you even
[1:33:02] believe. Oh, she's a good girl. She's a
[1:33:04] good girl. And what kind of home you
[1:33:06] figure you're going to have? Which
[1:33:07] church you going to go to?
[1:33:08] Her Baptist one or this one?
[1:33:10] Come on. How's your children going to be
[1:33:12] raised?
[1:33:14] You going to be able to fellowship with
[1:33:16] our sisters and their long hair and
[1:33:19] their long dresses? Go ahead.
[1:33:23] Preach, brother Donnie.
[1:33:32] Verse 10. that in the dispensation of
[1:33:34] the fullness of times, he might gather
[1:33:37] together in one all things in Christ,
[1:33:41] both which are in heaven, which are on
[1:33:43] earth, even in him, in whom also we have
[1:33:47] obtained an inheritance, being
[1:33:51] predestinated,
[1:33:53] according to the purpose of him who
[1:33:56] workketh all things up to the counsel of
[1:33:59] his own will. Can't you see why Satan
[1:34:02] has so exalted man's free moral agency
[1:34:05] and even in churches what he's done with
[1:34:08] free moral agency and he's made it
[1:34:11] higher in the mind of man than God's own
[1:34:13] will. I thank God tonight the will of
[1:34:16] God has power over my will. I'm a stupid
[1:34:20] human and you are too. We're as dumb as
[1:34:22] a coal bucket. We're as dumb as a box of
[1:34:25] rocks. We'd choose everything in our
[1:34:27] life would be the dumbest mess it ever
[1:34:30] was. Was it not for the grace of God,
[1:34:32] you would have chose the wrong church.
[1:34:34] You would have chose the wrong pastor.
[1:34:37] You would have chose the wrong wife. You
[1:34:39] would have chose the wrong man to
[1:34:41] follow. You would have chose a bishop
[1:34:43] instead of a prophet. Come on, somebody.
[1:34:46] You would not have chose Elijah. You
[1:34:48] would have chose some Nabos or some kind
[1:34:50] of something other. But God did not let
[1:34:53] it depend upon you. He said, "I can't
[1:34:56] trust my bride. I've got to choose for
[1:34:59] her. I'm going to choose Elijah. I'm
[1:35:01] going to choose this church. I'm going
[1:35:03] to choose this message. I'm going to
[1:35:05] choose this."
[1:35:07] Thank God he did. Thank God he did.
[1:35:17] Carol and I was talking about it the
[1:35:18] other day and she said, "Donnie,
[1:35:21] I love this message more than ever
[1:35:22] before." I said, "I know. I do, too. She
[1:35:25] said, "Wonder where we would be
[1:35:28] if God had not got a hold of us.
[1:35:32] No doubt I'd still been preaching.
[1:35:34] Where would we been, Harry?
[1:35:37] Pentecostal,
[1:35:39] apostolic.
[1:35:41] Oh, I might have had a radio broadcast
[1:35:42] or little television broadcast or, you
[1:35:46] know, some kind of this or that or the
[1:35:47] other. If it had been left up to my
[1:35:50] choice, no telling what I'd have been.
[1:35:53] Oh, but some of you have been.
[1:35:56] But I'm glad God is the interrupter of
[1:35:58] man's plans.
[1:36:00] Praise be to God. Aren't you glad he
[1:36:03] interrupted your plans? Interrupted your
[1:36:05] life. My goodness. Where would you be
[1:36:07] tonight, Brother Aaron? Where would we
[1:36:09] be tonight, Brother Ben? Were it not for
[1:36:11] the grace of God? Can't you see why God
[1:36:14] could not leave such a great program? Oh
[1:36:16] my. To to be able to just man to do it
[1:36:19] himself. Can you imagine these poor
[1:36:21] ignoramises
[1:36:23] that believe in evolution?
[1:36:28] I heard a creation scientist say not
[1:36:30] long ago, so it's a man that's a
[1:36:32] Christian and he's a scientist, but he
[1:36:34] doesn't believe in evolution.
[1:36:36] And he said, "So let's take that theory
[1:36:39] and let's take a pile of 2x4s,
[1:36:42] 2 by sixes, concrete blocks, shingles,
[1:36:46] insulation, wiring." And he went through
[1:36:49] a whole list of building material. And
[1:36:52] he said, "Let's put them all in one pile
[1:36:55] and see how long it'll take them to
[1:36:56] evolve into a house."
[1:37:02] Case closed.
[1:37:04] Can you imagine this place we live and
[1:37:07] it started with a polywog or started
[1:37:09] with some kind of slimy something other.
[1:37:12] It was no slimy something or another. It
[1:37:15] was our father God that said let there
[1:37:17] be and there was. Let there be and there
[1:37:20] was. It's the same way with you and I.
[1:37:22] We wasn't some polywag in a pond of
[1:37:25] scum. But we was an attribute of God
[1:37:28] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:37:30] world. And the Lord God says, "Satan,
[1:37:32] you may have them for a while, but
[1:37:34] they're mine. I'll get them. I'll take
[1:37:36] them away from you. I'll save them. I'll
[1:37:39] sanctify him. I'll fill him with the
[1:37:40] Holy Ghost. I'm warning you now, devil.
[1:37:43] He is mine. She is mine.
[1:37:50] Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:54] Glory to God.
[1:38:00] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:38:03] glory
[1:38:05] who first trusted
[1:38:07] in Christ.
[1:38:10] Now the word predestinate,
[1:38:12] Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he
[1:38:15] also did predestinate
[1:38:17] to be conformed to the image of his son,
[1:38:20] that he might be the firstborn, not the
[1:38:24] only one, but the firstborn among many
[1:38:28] brethren.
[1:38:30] Same father,
[1:38:33] same father.
[1:38:36] Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
[1:38:40] them he also called, and whom he called,
[1:38:44] them he also justified, and whom he
[1:38:47] justified, them he also glorified.
[1:38:52] What shall we say to these things?
[1:38:55] If God be for us,
[1:38:58] who
[1:38:59] can be against us?
[1:39:02] You believe that tonight?
[1:39:05] Thank you.
[1:39:05] Now, let's look at another one of your
[1:39:07] little packages here.
[1:39:09] What is that name tag? Oh, I see it.
[1:39:13] Forno.
[1:39:15] Forno.
[1:39:17] Romans 8:29. For whom
[1:39:21] he did forno.
[1:39:24] Again, your strongest concordance number
[1:39:26] 4267.
[1:39:29] for ordained
[1:39:31] know before to have knowledge
[1:39:34] beforehand. Amen. To forno those whom
[1:39:39] God forneew
[1:39:42] so that they would
[1:39:45] love him.
[1:39:52] So what is it you have to brag about?
[1:39:54] What is it you have to brag about,
[1:39:56] brother Malachi? What you got to brag
[1:39:58] about? Not one thing. Let me tell you
[1:40:00] why I love him the way I do. I'm
[1:40:02] ordained to.
[1:40:04] Come on, somebody. I was ordained to not
[1:40:07] be satisfied being a Baptist preacher or
[1:40:10] a Pentecostal preacher. Can you imagine
[1:40:12] me being a Catholic priest,
[1:40:16] big
[1:40:19] walking out with a woman's dress on? You
[1:40:21] imagine me? Oh my. I wasn't ordained to
[1:40:24] dress like no woman. I wasn't ordained
[1:40:26] to bring the lightened and the this and
[1:40:28] that and the other. I was ordained to
[1:40:30] pack the word of life. I was ordained,
[1:40:33] hallelujah, to bring life to the bride
[1:40:35] of Jesus Christ along with the rest of
[1:40:38] my minister. Brother, you was not
[1:40:40] ordained to stay in no Baptist church.
[1:40:43] You wasn't ordained to stay in no
[1:40:45] Methodist church. Neither are you
[1:40:47] ordained to sudden some dried up message
[1:40:49] church that don't believe in the power
[1:40:51] of God. Hallelujah. You're ordained to
[1:40:54] follow the ways of the Lord. You're
[1:40:57] ordained to be in his image.
[1:41:00] [Applause]
[1:41:07] Oh, glory to God.
[1:41:12] Romans 11:2,
[1:41:15] God hath not cast away his people,
[1:41:22] his
[1:41:24] people,
[1:41:26] which he forneew.
[1:41:32] What ye not of what the scripture saith
[1:41:34] of Elias? how he maketh intercession to
[1:41:38] God against Israel, saying God, listen,
[1:41:43] hath not cast away his people
[1:41:47] which he forneew
[1:41:50] hear that don't you?
[1:41:53] First Peter 1:2, elect according to the
[1:41:59] fornowledge of God the father. Can we
[1:42:02] look at another attribute?
[1:42:05] Yes.
[1:42:07] Chosen.
[1:42:09] Matthew 2:16.
[1:42:11] So the last shall be first and the first
[1:42:13] shall be last. For many
[1:42:17] be called
[1:42:20] but few
[1:42:22] chosen.
[1:42:24] Ah look at this word. Same one we looked
[1:42:28] at before. Equtos.
[1:42:31] Picked out. chosen by God to obtain
[1:42:35] salvation through Christ. Choice select
[1:42:39] the best of its kind or class.
[1:42:43] So in the class of Christianity
[1:42:48] that are the prime choice,
[1:42:50] the elect,
[1:42:52] the prime rib if you will,
[1:42:55] because they are prime and they come
[1:42:58] from under his rib, his heart.
[1:43:01] So they are the select cut, the premier
[1:43:05] choice.
[1:43:07] Churches, churches and brides, brides
[1:43:10] and churches, churches and brides,
[1:43:12] brides. But there must come one who has
[1:43:15] both mechanics and dynamics.
[1:43:19] Hallelujah. She don't come by
[1:43:20] membership. She come by the breaking
[1:43:22] forth of the blood of life that dripped
[1:43:25] on her name.
[1:43:27] The best in its class. Notice again 1
[1:43:30] Peter 2:9. But ye are a chosen
[1:43:35] generation. Well, glory to God. Genos,
[1:43:40] kind offspring, stock race.
[1:43:47] I am a racist.
[1:43:50] Yeah.
[1:43:51] The race of God.
[1:43:54] And in that race is black, white, red,
[1:43:56] yellow. Amen.
[1:43:58] Africans, Americans, there'll even be a
[1:44:00] few Tennessans say, "Thank God.
[1:44:03] I am part of this race."
[1:44:06] Come on, somebody. The black race is not
[1:44:09] superior. The white race is not
[1:44:11] superior. The Hispanic is not superior.
[1:44:14] But the God race is the superior race.
[1:44:18] That's what God wants the earth to be
[1:44:20] ruled by. The race of his own kind.
[1:44:26] Hallelujah.
[1:44:28] The race of God
[1:44:31] is fixing to take over the earth.
[1:44:38] All three sons of Noah, their races have
[1:44:42] ruled the earth and all three of them
[1:44:44] have proven they cannot do it.
[1:44:49] But God will have a race.
[1:44:52] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:54] Ye are a chosen generation,
[1:44:58] a royal priesthood
[1:45:00] and holy nation, a pecular
[1:45:05] people. Now this don't mean probably
[1:45:07] what you think.
[1:45:09] Look at the word peculiar
[1:45:12] purchase possession.
[1:45:14] People think peculiar means acting odd
[1:45:17] and strange and weird. So they try to
[1:45:19] make themsel weird. That's not what the
[1:45:21] word even means.
[1:45:24] a purchased possession, one's own
[1:45:28] property. In other words, you don't
[1:45:30] belong to yourself. You don't belong,
[1:45:32] you're not, you know, just an instrument
[1:45:34] in the church and the church owns you.
[1:45:36] You're not a pawn for a denomination.
[1:45:38] You belong to the Lord Jesus.
[1:45:41] You are a peculiar people. So if he
[1:45:43] tells you don't go there, you don't go
[1:45:45] there. If he tells you don't dress this
[1:45:47] way, don't act this way, don't do this,
[1:45:48] do that. If you are purchased by him and
[1:45:51] you belong to him, he can control you.
[1:45:55] You see why this don't fit everybody?
[1:45:58] Cuz they're saved out of control. Saved
[1:46:03] people.
[1:46:09] My
[1:46:11] I'll tell you one thing. I nearly had a
[1:46:14] runaway
[1:46:15] this evening when I was sitting
[1:46:17] downstairs studying. Look at this. A
[1:46:20] holy nation, a pecular people that
[1:46:24] should show forth the praises.
[1:46:29] I don't remember ever, brother Rob,
[1:46:32] clicking on this word praises,
[1:46:36] but was I surprised
[1:46:39] when I did.
[1:46:41] Look at what he says.
[1:46:44] Virtue
[1:46:46] praises
[1:46:48] a virtuous
[1:46:50] course of thought, feeling, and action.
[1:46:56] You understand? I'm coming right back to
[1:46:57] what the prophet said. You're worshiping
[1:46:59] the Lord when you're witnessing.
[1:47:00] Worshiping to the Lord when you're
[1:47:01] telling somebody there's a need of God.
[1:47:04] And we think praise can only be in the
[1:47:06] church. We're called to give praise to
[1:47:09] him out of virtue, not repetition. Let's
[1:47:11] everybody raise our hands and praise the
[1:47:13] Lord. Well, praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:47:14] Lord. Praise the Lord. It's a virtue.
[1:47:17] It's a virtue. This is the elect of God.
[1:47:19] Notice what they are. Oh, thank you,
[1:47:21] Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. That ye
[1:47:24] should show forth the praises.
[1:47:28] The praises.
[1:47:30] And it is virtue, a virtuous course of
[1:47:34] thought, feeling and action, moral
[1:47:38] goodness, any particular moral
[1:47:41] excellence as modesty
[1:47:45] and purity. So praises,
[1:47:48] so it ain't about this.
[1:47:53] Do we believe in that? Yes. This is a
[1:47:55] higher praise. You see, the church can
[1:47:59] do this. The church can do this and
[1:48:01] smoke and and live with somebody else's
[1:48:03] wife, but only the elect of God
[1:48:07] can be able to render this kind of
[1:48:09] praise
[1:48:10] because it's a virtue that comes from
[1:48:12] their new birth. They live in this
[1:48:15] habitable zone. This is a description of
[1:48:18] who they are. They're walking in a plane
[1:48:20] that other planets cannot walk in.
[1:48:22] They're living in a sphere, in a realm.
[1:48:24] And let me tell you something, it's so
[1:48:27] painful to them
[1:48:29] cuz it's like the more they get, the
[1:48:31] more they want. And the more they want,
[1:48:32] the more they get. And the more they
[1:48:34] get, the more they want. And the more
[1:48:34] they want, the more they get. And the
[1:48:35] more they get, the more they want. And
[1:48:36] the more they want, the more they get.
[1:48:38] And it's like they're never satisfied.
[1:48:39] And they're so satisfied. A lot of
[1:48:42] people think they're crazy.
[1:48:46] Why?
[1:48:48] It's like their thoughts,
[1:48:51] their virtue.
[1:48:53] It's more than just standing there.
[1:48:54] Hallelujah Jesus. Hallelujah Jesus. But
[1:48:58] it's a higher praise.
[1:49:00] A virtuous course of thought, feeling an
[1:49:03] action, moral goodness,
[1:49:06] any particular moral excellence
[1:49:10] as modesty and purity.
[1:49:13] But you are a chosen generation.
[1:49:16] I'll tell you one thing, this is quite
[1:49:17] amazing for a man that a few years prior
[1:49:20] to this and was written about him in the
[1:49:21] book of Acts said they were ignorant and
[1:49:23] unlearned. This old boy got an
[1:49:26] education, didn't he?
[1:49:28] A divine one. You are a chosen
[1:49:30] generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
[1:49:32] nation, a peculiar people, that you
[1:49:35] should show forth the virtue, the virtue
[1:49:39] of him,
[1:49:41] who has called you
[1:49:44] out.
[1:49:46] of darkness
[1:49:48] into his marvelous
[1:49:52] light.
[1:49:54] Let's stand our feet. We'll read the
[1:49:56] meaning of the word called
[1:50:00] Ko.
[1:50:02] Now listen the way Peter said it here
[1:50:06] was to shed show forth the praises of
[1:50:09] him who has called you out of darkness.
[1:50:13] K Leo be it
[1:50:17] to call
[1:50:19] aloud to name
[1:50:24] to give
[1:50:26] a name to.
[1:50:30] So God named the earth,
[1:50:33] man named Mars.
[1:50:36] God named Earth, man named Pluto.
[1:50:41] God named Earth.
[1:50:44] Man named Uranus.
[1:50:47] God named Earth.
[1:50:50] Man
[1:50:51] named the others.
[1:50:54] God called his church
[1:50:57] the church of the firstborn.
[1:50:59] Man called them Methodist,
[1:51:02] Baptist,
[1:51:03] Church of God.
[1:51:05] That same spirit come right around the
[1:51:06] message. Two soul, seven thunder, tape
[1:51:10] only. in a whatever name notice. But is
[1:51:13] that what God calls us?
[1:51:15] Does God call us the press play group?
[1:51:20] No. But that organizational spirit
[1:51:22] around the message does.
[1:51:24] Well, we're we're Peruia. We're we're
[1:51:26] Seven Thunder. Oh, that's a man name.
[1:51:29] But what does God do when you're called?
[1:51:32] God calls you personally.
[1:51:35] And then he calls you collectively to
[1:51:38] fellowship in a certain group or a
[1:51:41] certain body
[1:51:43] and he keeps on calling. So if you go by
[1:51:46] the way of the grave when the
[1:51:47] resurrection comes, he'll call and
[1:51:50] you'll answer.
[1:51:51] If you're alive, he'll call and you'll
[1:51:54] answer alive.
[1:51:56] The one who started calling keeps right
[1:51:59] on calling until you arrive at home.
[1:52:02] Hallelujah.
[1:52:03] It don't make no difference to him if he
[1:52:04] gets a business signal or not. He's
[1:52:06] going to override that business signal.
[1:52:07] He gets your attention. A lot of us have
[1:52:09] had a business signal in our lives. Come
[1:52:11] on, somebody. Lord, say, "Come pray
[1:52:13] more. Come pray more. Get closer to me."
[1:52:15] "Lord, I ain't got time. I ain't got
[1:52:16] time." They hang up the phone. "Uh, come
[1:52:17] come and get closer." "No, I ain't got
[1:52:19] time, Lord. I ain't got time." He said,
[1:52:20] "All right, I'm going to get you one way
[1:52:22] or the other." You walk in or I drag in.
[1:52:25] Your name's on that book and I don't
[1:52:27] make no mistake. So, I'm going to get
[1:52:28] you, boy. I'm going to get you, girl.
[1:52:30] You understand? Say, "Yes, sir, Lord.
[1:52:32] I'm willing. I'm willing."
[1:52:35] Notice
[1:52:37] to call aloud, to name,
[1:52:40] to give a name to.
[1:52:43] Lord, children, can't you see how
[1:52:44] fitting it was when the seals is being
[1:52:46] opened and Elijah stands up with that
[1:52:49] anointing
[1:52:51] of Christ, that mighty angel, Revelation
[1:52:52] 10:1, on him, and he says, "I no longer
[1:52:56] call you church,
[1:52:59] but I call you
[1:53:03] bride."
[1:53:06] Right? So in 1962 when the five stars
[1:53:09] line up, what he said it was a sign of
[1:53:12] an infant bride.
[1:53:15] Well, I hope and pray to God we're not
[1:53:18] that no more.
[1:53:20] The Lord Jesus ain't looking to come to
[1:53:23] his wife being a three-year-old.
[1:53:27] He wants a mature wife.
[1:53:31] How many wants to be mature?
[1:53:34] Oh, don't you love him?
[1:53:37] to receive
[1:53:39] the name of. Now notice to give a name
[1:53:42] to or to receive the name of.
[1:53:47] So it's a compound meaning that you can
[1:53:49] get a name receive a name.
[1:53:53] receive or you're received as a name
[1:53:58] to give some name to one
[1:54:02] to bear a name
[1:54:04] or title
[1:54:07] among men.
[1:54:10] Praise God.
[1:54:13] We don't want to be called Reaganites,
[1:54:16] Puadites,
[1:54:18] Spencerites,
[1:54:20] or Branommites.
[1:54:22] I want to be called by the name of the
[1:54:23] Lord Jesus.
[1:54:26] The call in the last days is not all
[1:54:28] right. Whoever's called by Reagan, come
[1:54:30] on. Whoever's a follower of Ron Spencer,
[1:54:34] whoever's a follower of Mark Spencer,
[1:54:36] whoever's a follower of D Ward, that
[1:54:38] ain't the name he's called it.
[1:54:41] But he gives his bride his name, which
[1:54:43] is his word.
[1:54:45] Let me close with this. Revelation
[1:54:47] 17:14.
[1:54:49] These shall make war with the Lamb, and
[1:54:52] the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is
[1:54:54] Lord of lords and King of Kings,
[1:54:59] and they that are with him
[1:55:03] are called
[1:55:05] chosen
[1:55:07] and faithful.
[1:55:11] Praise God.
[1:55:13] Well, what did you think, Rebecca? What
[1:55:17] did you think about your little packages
[1:55:18] tonight?
[1:55:20] You know what? I've got one little tiny
[1:55:22] one left, but it won't take me but just
[1:55:24] a couple of minutes. So, next Wednesday,
[1:55:26] we can kind of go some in another
[1:55:28] direction. Y'all like it?
[1:55:30] Okay. You would? All right. All right.
[1:55:32] It's It's called ordained. St. John
[1:55:34] 15:16. Ye have not chosen
[1:55:38] make choice to pick out to pick or
[1:55:40] choose for oneself. Choosing one out of
[1:55:42] many of God. Choosing whom he judged fit
[1:55:47] to receive his favors and separated from
[1:55:51] the rest of mankind to be peculiarly his
[1:55:55] own and to be attended continually by
[1:55:58] his gracious oversight.
[1:56:02] That ought to make a Presbyterian shout,
[1:56:04] "Glory.
[1:56:09] Glory to God.
[1:56:15] Jesus speaking to the disciples,
[1:56:18] "Ye have not chosen me." Remember the
[1:56:21] custom was in this first century, the
[1:56:24] rabbi never chose the disciples to
[1:56:28] follow him. But you chose the rabbi you
[1:56:33] wanted to follow.
[1:56:35] So this man was a rabbi, this one, this
[1:56:37] one. Each one of them had their own
[1:56:38] little, you know, heliel or whichever
[1:56:40] one they followed. And then you heard
[1:56:42] their teachings and then you would
[1:56:44] choose. Okay. So, so which one? But
[1:56:46] Jesus is setting his strength. Now look,
[1:56:48] boys, you all never chose to follow me.
[1:56:52] I chose you to follow me.
[1:56:55] What about it? Word of life.
[1:56:57] Who done the choosing around here? You
[1:56:59] or Almighty God?
[1:57:03] Ye have not chosen me, but I've chosen
[1:57:05] you and ordained you. Ordained. Appoint
[1:57:12] to set, to place or lay, to lay by, to
[1:57:17] make, or set for oneself
[1:57:21] or for one's use.
[1:57:25] To set, fix, establish, to set forth.
[1:57:29] Hallelujah.
[1:57:30] Acts 13:48. And when the Gentiles heard
[1:57:34] this, they were glad and glorified the
[1:57:38] word of the Lord. And as many as were
[1:57:42] ordained
[1:57:44] to eternal life,
[1:57:47] believed.
[1:57:51] You
[1:57:51] imagine if Peter and James and John and
[1:57:53] Paul would come into some of the message
[1:57:55] churches in the way they preach
[1:57:57] predestination today. They'd have to get
[1:57:59] up and rebuke some of these preachers
[1:58:00] and say, "Boys, that ain't the way we
[1:58:02] taught it."
[1:58:04] Read your Bible. Read Acts 13:48. Read
[1:58:06] Ephesians 4. Read Read all them
[1:58:08] different places. It wasn't you that
[1:58:09] made your choice. You boys got that
[1:58:11] Baptist thing all mixed up in your mind.
[1:58:14] 1 Corinthians 3:7 2:7. But we speak the
[1:58:17] wisdom of God in a mystery. even the
[1:58:19] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:58:22] the world unto our glory. Ephesians
[1:58:25] 2:10, for we are his workmanship,
[1:58:27] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[1:58:30] which God hath before ordained
[1:58:34] that we should walk in them.
[1:58:41] And the church said,
[1:58:43] "Amen."
[1:58:46] this variant.
[1:58:51] Oh Jesus, I'm so glad you interrupted my
[1:58:54] sermon.
[1:58:56] I hope that I can always be submissive
[1:58:59] to your divine interruption.
[1:59:03] Lord God, I'm so grateful
[1:59:06] that my choice,
[1:59:09] my integrity, my honor, my this, my that
[1:59:14] is not what's going to get me into the
[1:59:16] great paradise of God.
[1:59:19] Because you know me well.
[1:59:22] You know, Lord, I wouldn't never preach
[1:59:24] the first sermon. I wouldn't go through
[1:59:26] what I've gone through. And most of
[1:59:28] these people right behind me, they
[1:59:30] wouldn't have either. They would have
[1:59:32] chose the easy route because it's the
[1:59:34] way of human beings.
[1:59:36] But you ordained us to be different.
[1:59:41] All the people of the world look at our
[1:59:43] sisters and our hair and this and that
[1:59:44] and the other and they they stand out
[1:59:48] like I don't know what when they see
[1:59:49] them. I see it with my wife. I see it
[1:59:51] with my granddaughters, my daughters
[1:59:53] whenever we would go out to eat and they
[1:59:55] look at them with their dresses and
[1:59:57] their hair and they don't understand.
[1:59:59] But we are your people. We wear that
[2:00:02] badge proudly.
[2:00:05] Oh, Father, I pray you would help us
[2:00:07] all. Lord Jesus,
[2:00:10] we, dear God, can be true, faithful
[2:00:14] people. If there's a sister here tonight
[2:00:16] that does it because it's tradition, I
[2:00:20] pray you'd drop it into their hearts.
[2:00:22] Any of our young sisters that really
[2:00:24] still don't know why, may you make it so
[2:00:27] real to them.
[2:00:29] They'll walk out of these doors tonight
[2:00:31] with a revelation so real in their soul
[2:00:33] ain't enough. Devils out of hell to ever
[2:00:35] take it away from them. That it ain't
[2:00:37] mama saying it, ain't the pastor saying
[2:00:39] it. They'll know it because that's what
[2:00:41] Jesus wants me to do. He don't want us
[2:00:45] men looking like sissies and dressing
[2:00:47] like girls. He don't want our sisters
[2:00:49] dressing like boys.
[2:00:52] You made them male and female. That's
[2:00:54] the way you made them. That's the way
[2:00:55] you want them.
[2:00:56] Amen.
[2:00:57] Hallelujah.
[2:00:59] We love you tonight, Lord God.
[2:01:02] I thank you for calling me, Lord Jesus.
[2:01:05] I thank you for choosing me. I thank you
[2:01:07] for predestinated.
[2:01:09] I love predestination.
[2:01:12] You predetermined my destiny before I
[2:01:15] even have a right to choose.
[2:01:18] Thank you, Lord God.
[2:01:20] We worship you tonight, Father. We're
[2:01:23] called to praise to the praises of your
[2:01:27] glory by virtue
[2:01:29] by virtue
[2:01:31] of that new birth in our soul.
[2:01:34] Oh Lord Jesus, we worship you tonight,
[2:01:38] Father.
[2:01:39] Thank you, Lord God.
[2:01:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:45] Oh, don't you love him, saints? Can we
[2:01:47] just Can we just lift our hands now in
[2:01:49] his presence for just a little bit and
[2:01:52] just love him? Oh my Oh, aren't you glad
[2:01:55] to be elected? Aren't you glad that
[2:01:57] you're you've heard a call? Amen. You
[2:02:01] thought you'd always be a Baptist
[2:02:02] Methodist Church of God, whatever you
[2:02:04] were, but he had another name for you.
[2:02:07] It was Miss Jesus Christ. And thing of
[2:02:11] it is, we can't call oursel that and it
[2:02:13] stands. You might call yourself that,
[2:02:15] but only he can give you that name.
[2:02:19] When he gives you that name, there ain't
[2:02:21] enough devils in hell to take it away
[2:02:22] from you.
[2:02:23] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:24] Oh, we worship you tonight, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:28] We love that blessed name. We cast out
[2:02:30] devils in it. We're baptized in it. It's
[2:02:33] the loveliest name that we know. But we
[2:02:36] love it not just because it's your name,
[2:02:39] but because it's our name. Amen.
[2:02:42] It's the family, the earthly family name
[2:02:46] of redemption.
[2:02:47] Hallelujah.
[2:02:48] And we know the family name will be
[2:02:50] updated.
[2:02:51] Hallelujah.
[2:02:53] When you will get your new name, the
[2:02:56] family name will be updated.
[2:03:00] But until that hour arrives, we are
[2:03:03] perfectly content with the family name
[2:03:06] of redemption.
[2:03:08] Then in that day we will have the family
[2:03:11] name of the redeemed.
[2:03:15] Then we will be called by our true word
[2:03:20] name.
[2:03:21] So my name won't be Donnie. Harry's name
[2:03:23] won't be Harry. Carol won't be Carol.
[2:03:27] It will be that word name
[2:03:30] that you spoke our name into existence.
[2:03:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:38] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:03:41] Jesus.
[2:03:42] We worship you tonight, Father.
[2:03:46] Oh, how we love you, Lord God. We want
[2:03:49] to bring forth the praises of your
[2:03:52] glory, Father, in our lives. Not just
[2:03:54] with our hands, not just with our
[2:03:57] mouths, but by virtue, by thoughts, by
[2:04:01] the way,
[2:04:03] by the way treat one another. Oh God,
[2:04:06] we're praising you when we turn the
[2:04:08] other cheek. We're giving praise and
[2:04:11] honor to the work that you've manifested
[2:04:13] in our life. Whenever people run us
[2:04:16] down, and we could run them bound, maybe
[2:04:18] we know some bad things about them, but
[2:04:21] that would bring us down to their level.
[2:04:24] So instead of going down to their level,
[2:04:26] we'll go higher to your level.
[2:04:28] And we'll bring praise to your name. And
[2:04:31] instead of telling what we know about
[2:04:33] them, we'll pray for them.
[2:04:36] We'll pray for them that you'll change
[2:04:38] them. We'll pray for them that you'll
[2:04:40] forgive them. We'll pray for them, Lord,
[2:04:43] that you'll help them.
[2:04:44] Lord, instead of getting back at people
[2:04:47] and getting on Facebook and this and
[2:04:49] that and the other and tattling, we'll
[2:04:51] take the higher road.
[2:04:54] We'll just keep silent. A soft answer
[2:04:57] turneth away wrath. And love hides a
[2:05:03] multitude
[2:05:04] of sins.
[2:05:06] The prophet tells us that the reason
[2:05:08] that we don't feel that way about you
[2:05:10] and even about our brothers is because
[2:05:13] we've never come into that depth or that
[2:05:16] degree of love.
[2:05:19] Oh Jesus, help me to love you more. Yes.
[2:05:22] And I know if I start loving you more,
[2:05:25] I'll love the human race more.
[2:05:28] I'll love my brothers, my sisters more.
[2:05:32] My enemies, if I have any, I'll love
[2:05:35] them more. Oh, make me more like you,
[2:05:39] Jesus.
[2:05:40] Any How many will say that with me
[2:05:42] tonight just by raising your hands?
[2:05:45] Lord, help me to love you more.
[2:05:48] Help me to love you more, Lord Jesus. If
[2:05:51] I do, then I can love the way you love.
[2:05:55] For it's not your will that any should
[2:05:57] perish, but that all should come to
[2:06:01] repentance.
[2:06:02] Oh Lord God, that's the way we want to
[2:06:04] feel about people. No matter how they
[2:06:06] dress, how they act, how they live,
[2:06:08] whatever more, Lord,
[2:06:10] we want to love them, Father, the way
[2:06:12] you love them, Lord.
[2:06:14] Oh Jesus, we worship you, Lord God.
[2:06:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:22] Can we just love him a little bit before
[2:06:24] we go?
[2:06:26] Oh, thank God. I really enjoy these
[2:06:29] Wednesday nights when school ain't going
[2:06:30] on. So, we can stay just a little bit
[2:06:32] longer. I know you got your little young
[2:06:34] ones and you have to get them home. So,
[2:06:35] let's enjoy this next month or so,
[2:06:38] whatever it is before we have to go. If
[2:06:40] you need to go, sure, go on. But for
[2:06:42] those of you that want to stay, let's
[2:06:43] just stay here and worship him a little
[2:06:45] bit. Praise the Lord. Let's just enter
[2:06:48] into his praise, into his gates with
[2:06:50] thanksgiving,
[2:06:52] with a heart that's been redeemed.
[2:06:54] Thanking where you'd be tonight by your
[2:06:56] choice, by your great determination to
[2:06:58] do this or that. You might have been
[2:07:00] sitting in a Baptist church tonight or a
[2:07:02] Presbyterian or even worse, sitting in a
[2:07:04] bar stool somewhere drinking yourself
[2:07:06] unconscious.
[2:07:08] But the grace of God moved upon your
[2:07:10] heart.
[2:07:10] Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:11] And pulled you toward him. He called
[2:07:12] you. He chose you. He ordained you.
[2:07:16] chose you out of humanity. He chose you
[2:07:18] out of the rest of Christendom. Not to
[2:07:21] leave you just in a church, but he calls
[2:07:24] you to himself.
[2:07:26] Praise the Lord. Lead us here.
[2:07:29] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:07:32] Praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:07:35] Yet he loves.
[2:07:38] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:07:41] Yes, Lord God.
[2:07:43] He
[2:07:45] glory
[2:07:46] whose glory made
[2:07:49] the heavens
[2:07:51] shout.
[2:07:51] Oh hallelujah.
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:56] Oh,
[2:07:58] worthy
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:03] of such mercy.
[2:08:10] When he was on the road,
[2:08:18] I was on his side.
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:26] Hallelujah.
[2:08:28] I'm not on the ego
[2:08:33] trip.
[2:08:35] I'm just
[2:08:37] on my own.
[2:08:41] I make mistakes.
[2:08:44] How many does often swim
[2:08:49] just common flesh
[2:08:51] and bones?
[2:08:55] But he'll prove some
[2:08:58] just what I see.
[2:09:02] I'm of a special
[2:09:06] kind.
[2:09:08] When he was on the cross,
[2:09:15] you and I
[2:09:18] [Music]
[2:09:20] everybody now with all your heart thank
[2:09:23] God.
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:32] He loves
[2:09:34] me.
[2:09:39] His
[2:09:41] glory
[2:09:43] made the heaven
[2:09:46] shine.
[2:09:49] Hallelujah.
[2:09:51] Oh, what were
[2:09:57] I
[2:09:59] such mercy
[2:10:06] when he was on
[2:10:13] I was
[2:10:17] Oh, listen this verse, too. I love it.
[2:10:20] Hallelujah.
[2:10:23] The look of love
[2:10:26] was on his face.
[2:10:30] The source
[2:10:32] upon his head.
[2:10:36] The blood
[2:10:39] or gar on that scarlet gold
[2:10:44] stain was primar.
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:54] [Music]
[2:10:57] Jesus looked ahead
[2:11:00] in time
[2:11:03] when he was on the cross.
[2:11:08] [Music]
[2:11:10] You and I were all
[2:11:19] he
[2:11:23] [Music]
[2:11:27] loved
[2:11:29] me.
[2:11:34] His
[2:11:36] glory
[2:11:37] made
[2:11:40] the heaven shine.
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:45] I was so unworthy
[2:11:49] [Music]
[2:11:53] of such mercy
[2:11:57] [Applause]
[2:11:59] [Music]
[2:12:00] when he
[2:12:02] was on the cross.
[2:12:07] Oh, I was on
[2:12:12] his mind
[2:12:14] [Applause]
[2:12:16] for he
[2:12:20] [Music]
[2:12:23] Heat. Heat.
[2:12:31] [Music]
[2:12:37] the heaven.
[2:12:42] I was so
[2:12:47] [Music]
[2:12:51] sat.
[2:12:57] [Music]
[2:13:05] I will call his.
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:14] Praise the Lord Jesus. Would you mind
[2:13:17] doing a favor? Do me a favor tonight. I
[2:13:20] wonder how many might be in the building
[2:13:21] that's sick or got a need or request on
[2:13:24] your heart. Can we just lay our hands on
[2:13:26] one another and pray right now?
[2:13:28] Believer to believer. Remember, this is
[2:13:31] not just for preachers now. But Jesus
[2:13:34] said, "These signs shall follow them
[2:13:36] that believe." Brother Bram did this so
[2:13:38] many times. Brother Daryl has told me in
[2:13:40] the last six months or so that he's been
[2:13:43] doing this in different meetings where
[2:13:45] he's been instead of having prayer lines
[2:13:48] all the time. He' been praying and
[2:13:50] asking the Lord to give him direction.
[2:13:52] It's been absolutely unbelievable the
[2:13:56] amount of miracles. People have been
[2:13:59] healed with so many tremendous things
[2:14:02] that God has done for them just by
[2:14:04] believers laying hands on one another.
[2:14:08] Now, you're not praying for yourself,
[2:14:09] but you're praying for them. Lord Jesus,
[2:14:13] my brothers and sisters, have their
[2:14:15] hands one upon the other. We believe
[2:14:18] your word tonight, Father. This is part
[2:14:21] of who we are. We don't understand how
[2:14:24] it works, but all we know is it does.
[2:14:29] Father, they're not praying for their
[2:14:30] own needs, but they're praying for that
[2:14:33] sheep, that brother, that sister that
[2:14:36] may be so low and so despondent. Dear
[2:14:39] God, a trial that's so heavy. Maybe it's
[2:14:42] a son, a daughter, a wewarded person
[2:14:44] that they're concerned about right now.
[2:14:47] But Lord, you know what it is. And I
[2:14:49] pray in the name of Jesus, may the
[2:14:52] spirit of God bring healing, bring
[2:14:55] deliverance. Hallelujah. Lord, right
[2:14:58] here, as brother Matt was talking the
[2:15:01] other night about his situation with his
[2:15:03] ear, Lord, as I got a text just this
[2:15:05] just just this week of one of the
[2:15:08] brothers in our church that was dealing
[2:15:10] with a situation in his own ear, he was
[2:15:13] not even here. Couldn't make the
[2:15:15] service. But as he streamed the service
[2:15:17] and heard brother Matt talk about that
[2:15:19] situation, the spirit of God come to him
[2:15:22] and brought healing to his body. Father,
[2:15:25] in the name of Jesus, may sickness leave
[2:15:29] this people. May depression and sadness,
[2:15:32] may it leave them. Whatever they're
[2:15:34] bound with, Lord God, in the name of
[2:15:36] Jesus, may it leave them. Some of them
[2:15:38] wanting a greater a closer walk with
[2:15:41] you. Lord, may tonight be the beginning
[2:15:44] of that extended pass of the grace of
[2:15:46] God. Help them, Lord, in the name of
[2:15:49] Jesus. We give you praise for it,
[2:15:51] Father, in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:15:55] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Oh, we
[2:16:00] worship you tonight, Lord God. Thank
[2:16:02] you, Father. Well, it's me.
[2:16:07] It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need
[2:16:11] of prayer.
[2:16:13] It's me.
[2:16:16] It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need

[2:16:46] prayer.

[2:16:51] me, my

[2:16:57] It's me.
[2:17:00] It's me, Lord.

[2:17:44] me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[2:17:48] prayer. Oh, it's me.

[2:17:59] It's me.

[2:18:14] of prayer.
[2:18:17] Not the preacher, not the deacon, but
