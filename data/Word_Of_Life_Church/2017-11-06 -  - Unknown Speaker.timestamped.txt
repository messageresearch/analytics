[49:05] are listen at me now let me make myself
[49:07] clear so many churches I didn't count
[49:12] any particular church but I have to be
[49:14] careful the way our worst thing because

[49:30] Lord like that you sitting man but let
[49:32] me say you were God set me on fire and
[49:35] I'm running for my life I got my eyes on
[49:38] one thing know the bible begin to tell
[49:43] us how that Jesus if I could just slow
[49:50] down just a moment a man and the body
[49:53] was said in the Book of Luke the ninth
[49:56] chapter and if it's a seven verse and it
[49:58] came to pass that as they went in the
[50:02] way a certain man said unto him lord I
[50:05] would follow thee
[50:06] what's the Elva died out goeth and jesus
[50:10] said unto him fluxes have hosed the
[50:13] birds of the air have nests but the Son
[50:16] of man has nowhere to lay his head and
[50:19] he said unto another follow me but he
[50:23] said Lord suffer me first you go and
[50:26] burn
[50:27] my my father's buried my father pardon
[50:30] me and Jesus said unto him let the dead
[50:33] bury the dead but go and preach the
[50:37] kingdom of God and another also said
[50:41] Lord I will follow thee but let me first
[50:44] go in and and bid them for well which
[50:49] are at home at my house and jesus said
[50:52] unto Him no man has put in his hand to
[50:56] the plow and looking back is fit for the
[51:00] kingdom of God I think God for calling
[51:05] tonight I think God I heard my God
[51:09] called me and when he called me out of
[51:12] the system I have no desire to look back
[51:16] when he called me for my love Babylon I
[51:20] have no desire to loop back to Babylon
[51:23] are you hearing me I have no desire to
[51:26] loop back to the things of the world I
[51:28] got my mind on one thing amen is getting
[51:32] a body change and I know in order to get
[51:35] a body change that I must eat this word
[51:37] are you hear me I must stay put in a
[51:40] presence of the Sun amen in order to get
[51:44] about a change I thank God for the call
[51:48] tonight do you realize that there are
[51:50] many flows that I call the Bible say
[51:53] Paul said not many wise not many nobles
[51:57] not many a mighty means are calm but you
[52:01] know God takes the god take the the most
[52:04] simplest thing and confound the wise man
[52:08] God take people like Peter or Egret man
[52:12] and shake the whole world God take a man
[52:15] like David a man after God's own heart a
[52:18] sheep herd a man
[52:20] not nobody so smart a man but somebody
[52:23] that's willing to lay down whatever it
[52:26] takes
[52:26] Lord our ladies down if this causing my
[52:29] hindrance if this causing my distraction
[52:31] if my husband is my wife calls my
[52:35] distraction Lord forgive me because I
[52:38] want to follow you
[52:40] the way I realize that summer called
[52:47] summer sent and some just get up and
[52:51] wind which one of you you're one of them
[52:58] either you've been called by God or
[53:01] you've been sent by mama some preacher
[53:04] are you i a man somebody say man but if
[53:07] God called you whatever it takes
[53:10] Lord I'm willing to go all the way you
[53:15] know the word Church me at woman's in
[53:19] the Bible
[53:20] woman's type of the church the natural
[53:22] types the spirit and I thought about in
[53:25] the book of Genesis how that the Prophet
[53:28] Abraham sent a warning a man down to a
[53:32] lot and his wife and his family telling
[53:35] him to come out as solemn a man because
[53:38] God was getting ready to destroy Sodom
[53:42] and Gomorrah
[53:44] that's right but she took it real slight
[53:47] no no let me back up and she got very
[53:49] I'm sure she might have got desperate
[53:52] she mana she Milan was getting ready to
[53:55] run out of the house and she thought
[53:57] about she she left with nice fancy shoe
[53:59] then when I got the six-inch heel you
[54:02] know because she just want to go back
[54:04] and get those shoes are you hearing me
[54:08] said that don't sound like somebody that
[54:11] - right maybe maybe maybe she was
[54:13] running out and she thought about maybe
[54:16] this she need to bring her television I
[54:19] got with me maybe she thinks she need to
[54:22] take her television but will you meet
[54:24] God tells you to go out you need to come
[54:27] out and don't look back for nothing
[54:31] no I love it so well that because like
[54:35] why she she did come out she did justify
[54:39] she came out she might have cleaned up
[54:41] she might have stopped cutting the loose
[54:43] ends you hear what I'm saying
[54:45] she she might have stopped doing those
[54:46] stay she might have stopped wearing
[54:48] pants a man putting on man
[54:50] she might have died and she might have
[54:53] clean up and look just like a Christian
[54:57] look just like a Christian faith for
[55:01] coming to church paying the tithe the
[55:03] dues and adult and all day but let me
[55:06] tell you when she came out she came out
[55:09] to probably God say she just had to take
[55:11] that one long look bang are you hearing
[55:16] me and we she look back my Bible said
[55:19] that she turned to a pillar of salt
[55:23] oh my god I wouldn't eat here tonight
[55:26] you could be sitting in here
[55:28] and look at yourself you might be
[55:30] turning to a salt you said what you mean
[55:36] if you start losing that desire
[55:38] something that's happening you don't
[55:41] have that zeal like you you sir then you
[55:43] might be turning to yourself you might
[55:48] come out a move your feet like you're
[55:49] you sir how you use a patch of feet and
[55:52] praise the Lord it might be starting
[55:53] from your feet coming up you might be
[55:56] turning to the song I don't know but
[56:01] when Jesus say come you need to go and
[56:03] don't be distracted I don't care what
[56:06] sailor who say keep your eyes someone
[56:09] said brother children where you go I
[56:10] said I'm going to wish it at all someone
[56:12] saw you going down your brother done you

[56:34] about it sitting in church you know and
[56:38] I'm going to get your king in a minute
[56:40] here and I love this stretch of what

[56:46] the thirteenth chapter maybe the feel
[56:48] first that I'm a man if I'm karate if I
[56:51] write all that the Apostle Paul says
[56:54] examine yourself
[56:55] that's what he's saying examine yourself
[56:58] and see whether you are in the faith
[57:03] I hear me see rather yo I in Christ see
[57:07] what Paul trying to say he say examine
[57:10] yourself and see rather you interface

[1:03:43] particular time Elijah a man amen amen
[1:03:47] had fallen I think so many other
[1:03:49] prophets kill a man up under the
[1:03:51] unknowing
[1:03:52] somebody say man but you know sometimes
[1:03:54] you could be insured you could be
[1:03:56] praising God just Oh God
[1:03:58] brother choosing preaching the faith
[1:03:59] message I got faith I claimed in my
[1:04:02] healing I claiming my deliverer

[1:04:10] the same level
[1:04:11] somebody say man the same faith Amen you

[1:04:19] Church of the Living God I got my wife
[1:04:21] mind on one thing I got my mind on the
[1:04:24] Lord tonight amen
[1:04:26] but Elijah knew that his time was
[1:04:29] drawing nigh and God began to talk to
[1:04:32] Elijah when he came out of the cave the
[1:04:34] God began to speak to him amen God
[1:04:38] wasn't in the lighting God wasn't in the
[1:04:41] Thunder hey man God wasn't in the fire
[1:04:44] but God wasn't that still small voice
[1:04:51] how many you ever heard that still small
[1:04:53] voice I told you you a child of God that
[1:04:57] voice I tell you you can't be lost that
[1:05:00] voice I tell you you come from eternity
[1:05:02] and you go on back with God that voice I
[1:05:05] tell you the devil can't stop you
[1:05:07] a man no matter what come ago that devil
[1:05:10] can't stop you
[1:05:11] why because you hear that steel smaller
[1:05:14] jaw somebody say man that still small
[1:05:18] voice
[1:05:19] Elijah knew that it's time he was
[1:05:22] getting old I could see him my brother I
[1:05:25] could see all Elijah God began to tell
[1:05:28] him how to not amen
[1:05:31] one to be king over Syria one to be king
[1:05:35] over Israel and Elijah I want you to be
[1:05:38] the prophet of God amen
[1:05:40] he told Elijah but I want you to go down
[1:05:43] and I'm Angie Liza a man a man knew his
[1:05:47] time was up and you know what I believe
[1:05:49] Elijah a man that was doing amen
[1:05:51] I believe God knew had that prophet
[1:05:53] storing up food
[1:05:56] because he knew his time was soon to
[1:05:59] come to him but one things I love
[1:06:01] someone how that God was training Elijah
[1:06:06] God was training the church somebody say
[1:06:10] my God was training to church so you
[1:06:13] have Malaysia are you hearing me and I
[1:06:16] can imagine old ball head Elisha all
[1:06:19] wrinkled man came up on the top of that
[1:06:22] hill and I could see the Sun glistening
[1:06:24] his eye as he began to look over the
[1:06:27] hill he look down in the field he could
[1:06:29] see that prophet down there flying in
[1:06:32] the field I could see had no idea it was
[1:06:41] that little point in time let me tell
[1:06:43] you church and living God some time in
[1:06:46] your lives you try to do things that -
[1:06:48] don't worry but when that time come when
[1:06:51] there's a season and there's a time in
[1:06:54] your life when you know it's the season
[1:06:56] you need to step into it and claim your
[1:06:59] delivers you need to claim your healing
[1:07:01] you need to claim you are overcome I and
[1:07:07] Elisha
[1:07:08] well down there applying but God was
[1:07:11] down there training him training this
[1:07:14] man with twelve oxen and I can imagine
[1:07:17] the monsters must have got out of line
[1:07:20] but God trained that man to hire to help
[1:07:23] patient the us getting out of line I
[1:07:27] think about a pastor he he must have
[1:07:29] gotta he must got he had must have to be
[1:07:32] strong it meant to lead God's people a
[1:07:34] man now they get out of line and a man
[1:07:37] he keep plying that word he keep
[1:07:39] whipping the word and sometime they get
[1:07:41] back out a lot but I can imagine
[1:07:44] Elisha was flying in the field and I
[1:07:46] don't prophet a God began to look down
[1:07:49] as he began to feel there are nineteen
[1:07:52] of God on his life and that prophet of
[1:07:55] God began to come down to heal to the
[1:07:59] lights of that church glory to God
[1:08:01] somebody say man where was you and this
[1:08:04] came to you somebody say man
[1:08:07] was you a man when elijah came down to

[1:08:38] God for it tonight I don't know about
[1:08:43] you but I was going astray man also
[1:08:46] thank God I thank God tonight that he
[1:08:48] reached down his hand for a poor rich
[1:08:51] Center like I have I thought I was in
[1:08:54] the truth I thought I was going in the
[1:08:55] right direction
[1:08:56] but I heard a prophet as he was coming
[1:08:59] down the hill I suggest just play but
[1:09:05] God was training him but you know what I
[1:09:07] love so that mantle that Elijah had off
[1:09:11] fit Eliezer perfect
