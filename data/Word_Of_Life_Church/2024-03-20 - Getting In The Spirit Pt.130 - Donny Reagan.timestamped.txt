[47:16] church in this hour is the coming of the
[47:20] Lord
[47:21] Jesus here we are all these years later
[47:25] if that was the hope then
[47:27] how much more is it our hope
[47:30] now Lord God we're so grateful that our
[47:34] hope is not in
[47:36] politics our hope is not in the
[47:39] economy we know it's an election year
[47:42] for our nation and people get all
[47:44] cranked up and think boy this man will
[47:47] do this and this man will do that but
[47:50] we're taught in the scripture and the
[47:52] message of the hour that our nation is
[47:56] beyond non
[47:58] Redemption it's too far gone Lord we're
[48:01] so grateful that we're not looking for a
[48:03] political hero we're not looking for

[48:35] of God tonight are you happy happy to be
[48:38] serving the lord happy to be a son or
[48:41] daughter of god let's turn to Revelation
[48:44] 10 tonight if you would verse 7 Lord
[48:47] willing I guess we're still scheduled um
[48:49] for questions and answers tomorrow night
[48:51] at 7:00 for the Youth so y'all come
[48:54] remembering that it'll also be strange
[48:56] for those of you that are over the hill
[48:59] you can stream it and stay home uh we
[49:02] look forward to it got some really good
[49:04] questions again and we're thankful for
[49:06] the opportunity to be able to to answer
[49:09] them Revelation chapter 10 um verse 7
[49:14] down through verses
[49:16] 11 but in the days of the voice of the
[49:20] seventh
[49:21] angel when he shall begin to
[49:24] sound the mystery of
[49:27] God should be
[49:29] finished as he hath declared to his
[49:33] servants the prophets now remember this
[49:36] is God's way of declaring Revelations
[49:40] and Mysteries to make them known not by
[49:43] a pastor not by an tele evangelist not
[49:46] by a teacher but by a
[49:49] prophet and the voice which I heard from
[49:52] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[49:56] and take the little book I remember
[50:00] moving from chapter 5 when the book was
[50:03] closed to uh chapter 10 a great thing
[50:07] has transpired to make this even
[50:09] possible that it would be able to happen
[50:12] go and take the little book which is
[50:14] open in the hand of the Angel which
[50:17] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[50:22] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[50:24] him give me the little book and he said
[50:28] unto me take it so John says give it to
[50:32] me and he said no you take
[50:38] it you take
[50:41] it that's typical for us human beings
[50:44] ain't it give me give me give me give me
[50:48] and sometimes you know what God's
[50:49] telling us take
[50:51] it take your ground take your land amen
[50:55] take your inherit itance take your
[50:58] healing from the devil take your Victory
[51:01] from the devil and what do we tend to
[51:03] say give me give me give
[51:08] me I went into the angel and said unto
[51:11] him give me the little book and he said
[51:12] unto me take it not only take it but
[51:16] take it and eat it eat it how eat it up
[51:23] eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[51:26] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[51:30] sweet as honey and I took the little
[51:33] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[51:36] up and it was in my mouth as sweet as
[51:39] honey and as soon as I had eaten it my
[51:44] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[51:47] thou must prophesy again before many
[51:51] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[51:56] kings
[51:57] may the Lord bless his word you may be
[52:03] seated let's turn to the Book of Ruth
[52:06] chapter 4 verse
[52:09] three we know that there's couple of
[52:12] different books that are the types of
[52:15] redemption in the Old Testament Joshua
[52:18] is one of them Book of Esther and also
[52:22] the Book of Ruth in there is written
[52:26] part of the the great plan of God
[52:29] naturally looking back in retrospect
[52:31] makes more sense to us than it would
[52:33] have if we would have lived in the days
[52:35] whenever it was written even in the New
[52:38] Testament when they would have read the
[52:40] book of Ruth uh the book of eser even
[52:43] the Book of Joshua probably many of them
[52:46] did not see how it linked with God's
[52:49] mystery of what he was going to do down
[52:51] through the church ages but God has a
[52:55] way about him
[52:57] and if we can ever find that way then
[52:59] it's
[53:00] unchangeable and we can see it repeat
[53:03] over and over and over again and we can
[53:06] base whatever we believe on this
[53:09] principle that I am God and I change not
[53:13] so if God ever required Holiness out of
[53:17] people God always will if God demanded a
[53:21] sacrifice that would speak for us then
[53:24] God always will so if we can find that
[53:28] God deals with man in a certain way of
[53:31] redemption then we can see with its Old
[53:34] Testament dispensation between the old
[53:36] and the new or the new or even
[53:39] conclusively ending it up in the
[53:41] Millennium with the earth going into the
[53:44] eighth day then all of that will come
[53:47] through a very similar pattern now watch
[53:51] this in the book of ruths we're very
[53:53] familiar with the story and it is
[53:55] focusing now upon this stage to where
[53:59] Ruth has been obedient in her part to
[54:03] what her mother-in-law taught her to do
[54:05] and we of course must do exactly what
[54:09] God wants us to do in the Plan of
[54:11] Redemption and then he will do what he
[54:14] knows that we cannot we are told to take
[54:17] the book and to eat it but God is the
[54:20] only one that could open the book and
[54:23] make it edible so you see God does his
[54:26] part than we do our part we work
[54:29] together and it produces the finished
[54:32] product of what he wants now here we
[54:34] have this stage of the kinsman redeemer
[54:37] now remember Revelation chapter 5 it was
[54:41] exploiting the evil of Satan as it comes
[54:44] over the opening of the seals in chapter
[54:47] 6 it goes into chapter 7 of course
[54:49] chapter 8 the opening of The Seven seal
[54:51] and then chapter n chapter 10 chapter 11
[54:54] will be the Revelation the two witnesses
[54:56] chapter 12 over into the tribulation
[54:58] period and it's it's typed in the Old
[55:01] Testament and now Boaz is going to call
[55:06] for the next of kin to step forward and
[55:10] so you can understand it take the book
[55:13] If there is one there that can take the
[55:17] book now there was one that was a closer
[55:20] kin to Rose and we know that he actually
[55:25] had the first claim on The Inheritance
[55:28] now watch and he said unto the Kinsman
[55:31] Naomi that is come again out of the
[55:33] country of Moab sell us a parcel of land
[55:37] which was our brother
[55:40] elik and I thought to advertise thee
[55:44] saying buy it before the inhabitants and
[55:48] before the Elders of my people if thou
[55:51] wil redeem it redeem it but if thou will
[55:55] not redeem it then tell me that I may
[55:59] know for there is none to redeem it
[56:02] beside thee and I am after thee now
[56:08] notice I am after thee and he said I
[56:11] will redeem it now remember this is the
[56:14] Old Testament type of the book of
[56:16] redemption in the New Testament and of
[56:19] course we know that Ruth was a gentile
[56:22] now Maan her husband had passed away but
[56:26] he was a direct heir to the land which
[56:30] they had left remember that God divided
[56:32] the land it was God that gave them the
[56:35] inheritance zebulin napali naftal rather
[56:39] Joseph Benjamin Levi on and on and on
[56:42] and God said the land could never be
[56:44] sold among them so a person from the
[56:47] tribe of Judah could not buy some of the
[56:50] land from Ephraim and say I'll trade out
[56:52] with you god designated where they were
[56:55] to live and they were to be there so
[56:57] even though they had long since been
[57:00] gone that land could not be sold to
[57:03] another tribe a rich man come in and
[57:05] said now I I like that land I want it
[57:08] well what tribe you belong to well I I
[57:10] belong to Nephi I belong to Joseph I
[57:13] belong to Benjamin oh no no no that
[57:15] that's not possible you can't do that
[57:18] that it has to be one that belongs to
[57:21] this tribe so then the property was left
[57:24] to Malo but maon also died so then that
[57:29] meant that Naomi and Ruth were the
[57:32] current owners so it come down to them
[57:35] now in order to be able to buy this land
[57:38] and we know to history tells us this was
[57:41] his name and to was a very a very
[57:45] selfish individual he was an individual
[57:48] that wanted to buy land he was not
[57:51] interested in the lever law but he was
[57:54] interested in possess s and he was
[57:57] interested in all that he could get out
[58:00] of life there's many toes that are
[58:02] living in this day are they not so Boaz
[58:06] must go by the law and the law itself
[58:10] said that the next of Ken was the one
[58:13] that had the right to buy the property
[58:15] so here the house had run down the barn
[58:18] no doubt had fell and the land was in
[58:20] terrible shape so Naomi said you know
[58:23] what I don't have a husband I'm too old
[58:25] to get a husband my daughter-in-law
[58:28] she's not married so I think I'd
[58:30] probably be better off just to sell this
[58:32] property I'd be better off to sell it
[58:35] but it's got to come through the direct
[58:38] law of God so somebody a merchant passed
[58:41] through from Macedonia another Merchant
[58:43] pass through from Syria another pass
[58:46] through from thessalonica hey I want to
[58:48] buy this no it could not be sold to them
[58:51] it had to be sold to someone who was of
[58:55] the right
[58:56] tribe had to be sold to someone that was
[59:00] even of the right family that was a
[59:03] Kinsman so by right then this Kinsman
[59:07] the next of kin was told then after him
[59:11] of course was Boaz so Boaz wants it he
[59:15] wants this land but Boaz is not this
[59:18] selfish type the way to is Boaz wants it
[59:22] because he wants
[59:25] her he's going to get the land and he's
[59:28] going to get Naomi's rights when he buys
[59:30] it but he's buying it mainly because he
[59:34] wants
[59:35] Ruth now notice he says in verse 5 then
[59:39] said Boaz what day now to spoke up and
[59:43] said okay yeah I want this land I want
[59:45] it now remember the one that had the
[59:48] first claim on you and I was actually
[59:51] not
[59:53] Jesus that's right it was the devil
[59:57] devil somebody said it was the devil he
[1:00:02] had the first claim on every one of us
[1:00:05] and Satan said absolutely I want them
[1:00:08] I'll take it on but you know really what
[1:00:12] he wants he wants this
[1:00:16] earth when it was in its primeval
[1:00:20] State the volcano volcanoes were
[1:00:24] belching out and the fire was spewing
[1:00:27] upon the breast of the earth and the
[1:00:30] Rocks were belching out of its very Soul
[1:00:34] if I can say it that way and the lava
[1:00:37] was still smoldering thousands of
[1:00:40] degrees on the face of the Earth and
[1:00:44] Satan walked upon this Earth in its
[1:00:47] primeval State staking his
[1:00:52] claim I want this
[1:00:57] Earth now remember the Angels actually
[1:01:00] fell before the world the Earth was ever
[1:01:04] laid in its foundation
[1:01:06] form and they saw God they saw him as he
[1:01:11] spread the universe trillions and
[1:01:15] trillions of stars that we're still
[1:01:17] finding out all the universe and all the
[1:01:21] things that are there but God showed
[1:01:24] favor to one one little tiny Speck of
[1:01:29] dust in this little corner of this
[1:01:35] subdivision of the
[1:01:37] universe and when God shows special
[1:01:40] favor to anything though it may be small
[1:01:43] and minute and so
[1:01:46] insignificant Satan wants it you think
[1:01:50] he wants you CUA you're a
[1:01:52] yce you think he wants you because
[1:01:55] you're a Johnson or or a Phillips or a
[1:01:58] Robins or your name is Reagan or or or
[1:02:01] or Frederick or you think he wants you
[1:02:04] because you're Donnie or Betty or or
[1:02:06] whoever you are he don't want you
[1:02:08] because of that he wants you because God
[1:02:12] has shown a special favor towards you
[1:02:17] anything that God loves it presents an
[1:02:20] automatic hatred from Satan when God
[1:02:25] said his love upon you that marked you
[1:02:29] with this gigantic X on your back when
[1:02:33] God showed you the first Speck of his
[1:02:35] Mercy it might have been when you was
[1:02:37] three years old and you swallowed a
[1:02:39] marble and they thought you was going to
[1:02:41] die or something happened to you and
[1:02:42] you're 5 years old and and and whatever
[1:02:45] it was and God in his Mercy divinely
[1:02:48] intervene for your life that sent a
[1:02:51] message down to Hell we better watch
[1:02:53] this one from this time on because
[1:02:56] something happened to them they should
[1:02:58] have died something supernaturally
[1:03:01] intervened in their life I hope you
[1:03:03] understand what I'm saying and many of
[1:03:05] you can remember back God in his Mercy
[1:03:07] spared you when you were very young you
[1:03:10] didn't realize it then but once the
[1:03:12] spirit of God quickens your life there
[1:03:14] was something about you that was noted
[1:03:17] in heaven which also made a note down in
[1:03:20] hell and that's why when you were a
[1:03:22] little child it seemed like the guns of
[1:03:24] hell were aimed after you like there
[1:03:27] were nobody else in your family or
[1:03:30] nobody else you went to school with
[1:03:32] don't you understand why you wouldn't
[1:03:33] even serving God didn't even have maybe
[1:03:36] a knowledge of God but God showed you
[1:03:38] special favor and that marked you well I
[1:03:41] don't know how you feel about that
[1:03:42] tonight I consider that a great honor I
[1:03:46] consider that a great honor that Satan's
[1:03:48] got a big old EX on my back cuz that
[1:03:51] means Jesus has got a big check mark on
[1:03:54] my heart because I'm one of his I belong
[1:03:57] to him I don't know how you feel about
[1:04:00] it it is worse being loved in a special
[1:04:03] way I don't know how you look at your
[1:04:05] trials and how you face them but I look
[1:04:08] at mine oh my I look at them and I know
[1:04:11] I am hated by the devil I know he
[1:04:13] despises me if he can't get me one way
[1:04:16] he'll try another and another and
[1:04:18] another and another I mean knows what
[1:04:20] I'm talking about I consider that a sign
[1:04:23] of my heavenly father's appr approval it
[1:04:26] means that the devil don't like me and I
[1:04:29] want him to know tonight the feelings
[1:04:31] are definitely mutual I don't only don't
[1:04:34] like him I hate him I hate his kingdom I
[1:04:38] hate what he stands for oh hallelujah oh
[1:04:42] and I count it a privilege and an honor
[1:04:45] to be hated by the devil come on let's
[1:04:47] have church tonight what do you say I
[1:04:50] consider it one of the greatest honors
[1:04:52] of my life to be loved by all men Mighty
[1:04:57] God
[1:04:59] hallelujah apparently you are worth
[1:05:02] fighting for you are worse dying for you
[1:05:06] are worse him coming to this Earth
[1:05:11] for which puts a mark on your back we it
[1:05:14] proudly but don't never forget the check
[1:05:18] on the front of your
[1:05:20] heart now watch this what day that thou
[1:05:23] buest the field of the hand of Naomi
[1:05:28] thou must abide also of Ruth the more AB
[1:05:32] this now he definitely wanted to mention
[1:05:36] this
[1:05:38] name don't forget to say who she
[1:05:43] is be sure and tell old brother
[1:05:48] toad be sure and that old brother to no
[1:05:51] she's not a
[1:05:52] Jew but she's a gentile that was an self
[1:05:55] would have been bad enough to be of
[1:06:00] Moab which was born of
[1:06:03] incest come on
[1:06:05] now there ain't no way in the world that
[1:06:08] to hearing about
[1:06:11] her would ever want to Mar his
[1:06:15] inheritance so Boaz wants to be sure and
[1:06:19] let toad know where she come
[1:06:24] from but th must also abide also of
[1:06:28] Ruth the
[1:06:31] moabites the wife of the Dead to raise
[1:06:35] up the name of the Dead upon his
[1:06:38] inheritance now what Boaz is doing is
[1:06:41] reminding to of the leverate law anybody
[1:06:46] know what that means the leverate law
[1:06:48] the leverate law it was that if a man
[1:06:51] had a wife and the man died and did not
[1:06:54] have a son then when someone else took
[1:06:57] that woman and married her it was his
[1:07:01] obligation that the firstborn son would
[1:07:04] bear the name of that dead husband and
[1:07:07] also get his
[1:07:10] inheritance now keep in mind now
[1:07:13] whenever you're going to take this woman
[1:07:15] to your firstborn son out of this Union
[1:07:21] will get this
[1:07:23] inheritance she will be recognized
[1:07:26] among the tribes she will be accepted
[1:07:29] because you married her but are you
[1:07:33] willing to Bear her reproach H so he
[1:07:37] must raise up the name of the Dead why
[1:07:41] was this done so no tribes in the
[1:07:44] children of Israel or no families would
[1:07:47] be forgotten they would have a living
[1:07:50] Mentor one that would be remembered
[1:07:53] their generation on down on down on down
[1:07:56] and their patronage might be dead for
[1:07:58] hundreds of years but they would still
[1:08:01] have
[1:08:02] descendants now what how the prophet
[1:08:04] takes this and he said now in this
[1:08:06] Sevenfold book of seals of redemption
[1:08:08] that the lamb took the book within
[1:08:13] himself the lamb took the book within
[1:08:16] himself the only one who could do it and
[1:08:18] he took it from the right hand of him
[1:08:20] that sat upon the throne now to claim
[1:08:23] his Redemptive
[1:08:26] to claim his rights to claim for me and
[1:08:31] you what he redeemed us from to see back
[1:08:36] to everything that Adam Lost In the
[1:08:39] Garden of Eden he has redeemed us back
[1:08:42] to
[1:08:43] that praise God now notice what Boaz is
[1:08:48] standing there in the breach but there's
[1:08:51] one standing there in the breach with
[1:08:54] him which has a claim on
[1:08:59] her naturally humanly he has a stricter
[1:09:04] more legal claim and a hold than Boaz
[1:09:09] heart did to's claim was by the
[1:09:14] law I can make you marry me I can make
[1:09:19] you do this Boaz did not want to make
[1:09:22] her do that Boaz fell in love with
[1:09:27] her praise the Lord I hope you
[1:09:30] understand Jesus actually fell in love
[1:09:32] with you before the foundation of the
[1:09:36] world now notice what he says and I
[1:09:39] thought to advertise the saying by it
[1:09:42] before the inhabitants and before the
[1:09:45] Elders of my people if thou Wilt redeem
[1:09:49] it redeem it but if thou will not redeem
[1:09:53] it then tell me
[1:09:57] I want to hear you say
[1:10:00] it
[1:10:03] devil I want to hear you say it
[1:10:09] Satan that you don't want
[1:10:12] her I want to hear you say it you cannot
[1:10:18] afford to buy
[1:10:21] her
[1:10:24] Hallelujah
[1:10:26] well after all he's a poor devil
[1:10:31] anyway I'm going to give y'all my
[1:10:33] thunder right now
[1:10:35] but notice he says then tell me that I
[1:10:38] may know for there is
[1:10:41] none to redeem it beside thee and I am
[1:10:46] after
[1:10:48] thee and he
[1:10:50] said I will redeem
[1:10:53] it notice again the prophet in
[1:10:55] conference he said now no other man no
[1:10:58] Bishop no post Pope no Cardinal no
[1:11:01] nothing can help you you're the only one
[1:11:04] that can do it he's the one then the
[1:11:07] conference was Satan was standing there
[1:11:12] ready to claim the human
[1:11:16] race and he said he had rights because
[1:11:19] they
[1:11:20] sinned yeah so when you were born and
[1:11:23] you were attached by your neor
[1:11:26] to your mother he said it's another
[1:11:29] Renegade another Renegade another
[1:11:31] Renegade the prophet said when you see
[1:11:33] that naal it's a sign of a
[1:11:37] renegade so when we were all born
[1:11:42] amen we were Renegades
[1:11:45] lost seemingly without
[1:11:48] hope and I did say
[1:11:52] seemingly
[1:11:54] Hallelujah notice he goes on to say and
[1:11:56] you people that Che has had the tapes on
[1:11:59] the Seven Seals when the lamb come forth
[1:12:01] to claim his Redemption what he had
[1:12:03] redeemed time was finished then he's in
[1:12:07] the work now doing the work of
[1:12:09] redemption but someday never remember
[1:12:11] this is three months after the seals
[1:12:14] were broke open I know there's some in
[1:12:16] our ranks that want to say 1963 ended it
[1:12:19] all March of 63 ended it and when the
[1:12:22] Seven Seals is open there's no more
[1:12:24] Mercy but here's the same prophet of God
[1:12:26] saying three months after he preached
[1:12:29] the Seven Seals that someday he walks
[1:12:33] from the
[1:12:34] sanctuary to take up the book of
[1:12:38] redemption now notice things can happen
[1:12:41] in a symbol and then they must needs
[1:12:44] also happen in reality form and whenever
[1:12:48] we go in the Rapture is the reality form
[1:12:52] of the book of redemption made flesh
[1:12:56] being gathered into the hands of the
[1:12:58] Lamb of
[1:12:59] God now notice he says to take up the
[1:13:02] book of redemption that he's purchased
[1:13:04] with his own blood then the hour is over
[1:13:07] he comes forth then to
[1:13:10] claim what he
[1:13:13] has
[1:13:16] redeemed then said Boaz verse 5 what day
[1:13:20] thou buest the field of the hand of
[1:13:22] Naomi thou must also buy a Roose of Mo
[1:13:25] about it's the wife of the dead now he
[1:13:28] explains to
[1:13:32] toe this right of kinsmanship so you've
[1:13:36] got to acquire Ruth the property will go
[1:13:41] to her
[1:13:42] son and you must bear the reproach of
[1:13:45] her being a
[1:13:50] moabitas Hallelujah so you ain't just
[1:13:53] getting the Earth devil
[1:13:55] this Earth belongs to
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:01] us so if you get the Earth you got to
[1:14:05] get

[1:14:09] hell right now when I said that
[1:14:13] said I don't want Don I don't want you I
[1:14:17] don't want you aren't you glad you've
[1:14:19] got that kind of a name down in hell
[1:14:21] that Satan says oh no I I I'd like to
[1:14:24] have Tennessee but I don't want some of
[1:14:25] them tennesseans I'd like to have
[1:14:27] Indiana but I don't want some of them
[1:14:29] Holy Ghost filled Holy Rollers that them
[1:14:31] saints of God I don't want nothing like
[1:14:33] that why if if I let them on the earth
[1:14:35] they'd turn the world upside down in six
[1:14:37] months time they'd turn my kingdom
[1:14:39] upside down he don't want you he hates
[1:14:42] you he despises you oh I'm so glad he
[1:14:46] does but does he want this Earth yeah
[1:14:50] but he can't get it without getting me
[1:14:52] so it puts him in a straight
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:00] so you want Johnson City do
[1:15:04] you guess
[1:15:06] what you got to have

[1:15:40] our future home I know it Bears its
[1:15:43] resemblance still yet of being marked by
[1:15:45] sin but watch what will happen to it now
[1:15:48] how striking now he says he takes the
[1:15:51] place where we're to dwell in through
[1:15:53] the same process what process process
[1:15:55] he's talking about the process of
[1:15:57] redemption now he called The Church
[1:15:59] through justification called it through
[1:16:01] sanctification filled it with the Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost and Fire he took it through a
[1:16:05] process that he himself the Holy Spirit
[1:16:08] himself the Son of God could dwell in
[1:16:10] the human heart could dwell in the human
[1:16:12] heart now it has to go through the that
[1:16:16] before he can come into it oh brother
[1:16:19] Donnie I want to I give my heart to the
[1:16:21] Lord thank God you did I laid aside my
[1:16:24] smoking I laid it aside my drink and I I
[1:16:26] quit that thank God I I've got
[1:16:28] Sanctified good wonderful but he still
[1:16:32] ain't in you
[1:16:33] yet you're on your way but he wants to
[1:16:37] come into your soul and seal your soul
[1:16:40] to the day of your
[1:16:42] Redemption now watch he parallels the
[1:16:44] earth going to the exact same thing
[1:16:46] notice he done the world where the bride
[1:16:49] is going to live in the same way his
[1:16:51] same Plan of Salvation now the world to
[1:16:55] be redeemed for this redeemed person he
[1:16:59] uses his same method he baptized it in
[1:17:02] water after the uian destruction shed
[1:17:05] his blood upon it to sanctify it and
[1:17:07] claim it it's his Satan tried to say
[1:17:10] I'll give it to
[1:17:12] you he said no sir I'll buy
[1:17:15] it now watch s said I'll give it to you
[1:17:18] he said Ain't No Way ain't no way you
[1:17:20] giving me this if you give it to me
[1:17:22] you'll have a claim against it you have
[1:17:25] a claim and you'll be able to come back
[1:17:27] I want it abstract or nothing I don't
[1:17:30] want no deal with the devil I will not

[1:17:49] kind of people I want that's the kind of
[1:17:52] people I feel welcome being around he
[1:17:54] said
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:18:00] but now it has to go through a baptism
[1:18:03] of
[1:18:05] fire remember there will be a
[1:18:09] nuclear
[1:18:11] war World War I will be a nuclear
[1:18:17] war and it will bring such destruction
[1:18:20] and Devastation on this
[1:18:23] Earth it will s
[1:18:25] as if though it is not
[1:18:29] redeemable the nuclear fallout will be
[1:18:32] so
[1:18:34] horrendous Blackness
[1:18:36] Darkness but as he did you he will take
[1:18:40] this chaotic mess at the end of the
[1:18:43] tribulation period when the nuclear war
[1:18:46] will seem as if though Satan saying well
[1:18:49] if I can't have it then I'll destroy it
[1:18:53] I'll annihilate the whole if I can't
[1:18:55] have it I'll put it in man's head I
[1:18:57] broke into your laboratory enough to
[1:19:00] understand the atoms and I'll make man
[1:19:02] so smart I'll make the Russians and the
[1:19:04] Iranians and the Americans I'll make
[1:19:06] them so smart I I'll have the whole
[1:19:09] world annihilated if I can have it you
[1:19:12] ain't getting it
[1:19:18] God come on devil I'm God you're just a
[1:19:23] devil he could just tell him I want this
[1:19:27] Earth this Earth is mine it's my
[1:19:31] attribute and you will not destroy
[1:19:36] it amen but I want you to think of what
[1:19:39] a chaos it will be by the time the
[1:19:43] tribulation period rolls
[1:19:46] around it will be such a terrible Place
[1:19:50] ashes of human bodies will be all over
[1:19:53] the Earth and we will walk out on them
[1:19:58] that have rejected God's
[1:20:01] word and in a moment and a twinkling of
[1:20:04] an
[1:20:05] eye as he changed our ashes our
[1:20:09] mortality into an immortal body the
[1:20:12] spirit of God will come on the earth in
[1:20:15] the form of the Millennium
[1:20:19] experience and the Holy Spirit of God
[1:20:22] will straighten her back up off of her
[1:20:25] 23 degrees axis that she's tilted on the
[1:20:29] spirit of God will straighten she's
[1:20:31] wobbling now out in space wobbling
[1:20:33] wobbling wobbling like that that's why I
[1:20:35] put the moon out there but the
[1:20:36] gravitational Pole to help keep it from
[1:20:39] Just spinning out in the universe and
[1:20:41] the spirit of God will move upon the
[1:20:43] Earth and he will bring her back up and
[1:20:46] stand her upright and she will have the
[1:20:48] proper the proper angle the proper
[1:20:51] temperature she'll come right back like
[1:20:53] it was in the garden of of Eden why
[1:20:55] because Adam's sin called God out of his
[1:20:58] Millennium and God stopped his
[1:21:01] Millennium but he will live it out again
[1:21:04] in the form of Jesus Christ the son of
[1:21:07] David on the throne on the earth and we
[1:21:10] will walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[1:21:13] there will be Atomic fod everywhere
[1:21:16] there will be Atomic Fallout and then a
[1:21:18] moment of time he will
[1:21:23] change
[1:21:28] am and the Earth will be
[1:21:30] beautiful and
[1:21:32] green and the birds will be seen and the
[1:21:36] animals will
[1:21:39] transformed and the big gigantic African
[1:21:42] lions and the Asian Lions and the
[1:21:44] Tigers they look over at the
[1:21:47] sheep look over at the
[1:21:49] cattle and they'll just say how you
[1:21:51] doing
[1:21:53] today how you doing come on let's let's
[1:21:56] hang out together what do you
[1:22:00] say don't you see what he's going to
[1:22:04] do he's bringing this
[1:22:07] earth into this stage of
[1:22:11] redemption she's
[1:22:13] following in your
[1:22:18] footsteps amen you get the Holy Ghost
[1:22:22] before she does
[1:22:25] but you getting it is proof she
[1:22:32] will then before we go into the E day it
[1:22:35] will not be another nuclear explosion
[1:22:37] but it will be holy fire from God out of
[1:22:39] Heaven he will lift the bride at the end
[1:22:41] of the Millennium off the face of the
[1:22:43] earth and the fire of God will come down
[1:22:45] and he will begin to burn the surface in
[1:22:48] the prop said maybe thousands of rounds
[1:22:50] remember beneath her crust beneath her
[1:22:55] crust still lays all the bones and all
[1:22:58] the echos skeletons and all the things
[1:23:00] of the past ages in there lays the
[1:23:03] geological record of her past of her
[1:23:07] earthquakes of the of the different
[1:23:09] things that's there at L thousands of
[1:23:11] miles maybe beneath her crust and he
[1:23:14] will go all the way down to erase all of
[1:23:18] her past Hallelujah in the Millennium
[1:23:22] it's not the Eighth Day so we will live
[1:23:24] on the top of those things that are
[1:23:27] buried there and all those fossils and
[1:23:29] the dinosaurs and all of that but in the
[1:23:32] end of the Millennium that saw a new
[1:23:34] heavens and a new Earth Hallelujah and I
[1:23:37] John saw the holy city from God
[1:23:40] descending down from God out of Heaven
[1:23:42] as a bride adorned for her husband and
[1:23:44] the Eighth Day the Earth will receive
[1:23:47] the Holy Ghost in tight and God will
[1:23:50] annihilate every dinosaur skeleton
[1:23:53] everything that lays in her geological
[1:23:56] record of her past just like he does a
[1:23:59] son and daughter of God you may have the
[1:24:02] memory of being lost you may have the
[1:24:05] memory of being a sinner and being a
[1:24:07] drunk but brother sister once you get
[1:24:09] your new body your geological record is
[1:24:13] gone to Hallelujah not only gone from
[1:24:16] your soul but gone from your mind gone
[1:24:20] from your memory whenever we move into
[1:24:23] that body the whole record is
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:35] annihilated notice it has to go through
[1:24:39] a baptism of
[1:24:41] fire Holy Fire from God which cleanses
[1:24:44] the
[1:24:45] earth and the
[1:24:47] heavens around
[1:24:49] it the heavens are contaminated with
[1:24:53] these demons
[1:24:55] yeah they they move back and
[1:24:58] forth they they communicate they talk
[1:25:00] that's what the prophet saw on the
[1:25:02] fourth dimension was these
[1:25:04] demons so God will Purge remember not
[1:25:09] one devil has ever set a foot inside
[1:25:13] your new
[1:25:15] city the devil has been Before the
[1:25:18] Throne of
[1:25:20] God right he went right there and
[1:25:22] accused job and and he still accuses us
[1:25:25] to this day but there ain't never been a
[1:25:28] devil footprint inside the bride's new
[1:25:31] home God's got a sign up there as it
[1:25:34] were no trespassing to Devils no Devils
[1:25:37] allowed there won't be one devil that'll
[1:25:39] never set a tow print inside that new
[1:25:42] city Jesus is gone to prepare it for you
[1:25:44] there won't be one imp there will not be
[1:25:47] one sickness there will not be one
[1:25:48] trouble not one devil has ever set a
[1:25:51] foot inside of that precious City what
[1:25:53] it's got your name roll all over
[1:25:56] it amen and he's got to make this Earth
[1:25:59] to be a suited place for him to come
[1:26:02] down and live on
[1:26:05] it notice the baptism of fires to
[1:26:08] cleanse it from sin from sickness from
[1:26:11] disease germs from sinners from the
[1:26:14] devil and all this group he's cast out
[1:26:16] of the Lake of Fire Holy Fire from God
[1:26:18] comes down from God out of heaven and
[1:26:20] burns it up notice to make it ready for
[1:26:24] God to dwell in for God in the new
[1:26:27] world is to come and dwell in the earth
[1:26:30] cuz you say God he dwells in the human
[1:26:34] heart but he and the bride becomes one
[1:26:38] and they go to their
[1:26:40] home in the new
[1:26:43] world and the same Plan of Redemption is
[1:26:45] used to redeem both
[1:26:48] world and the persons that live in it
[1:26:51] praise be to
[1:26:53] God now watch ruths 4:
[1:26:58] 6 and the Kinsman
[1:27:02] said I
[1:27:05] cannot say it
[1:27:08] again I
[1:27:13] cannot redeem it wanton you to
[1:27:18] notice he don't even call Ruth by name
[1:27:25] he don't even acknowledge her as if she
[1:27:29] even
[1:27:30] exists but he says
[1:27:33] it he didn't want her he wanted the
[1:27:37] Earth he wanted the
[1:27:41] property but God called you by
[1:27:46] name Hallelujah aren't you glad you're
[1:27:49] not a number was God you've got a
[1:27:52] name oh my and the Kinsman said I cannot
[1:27:58] redeem it for
[1:28:00] myself lest I
[1:28:03] Mar my own
[1:28:08] inheritance redeem thou my right to
[1:28:13] thyself for I cannot say it again devil
[1:28:17] just say it one more
[1:28:20] time I cannot redeem it can you imagine
[1:28:24] imagine how Ruth and Naomi
[1:28:27] felt they might have said hold my
[1:28:30] mu oh my you I feel a spell coming on
[1:28:34] cuz just a few minutes prior to this he
[1:28:36] said I want it a few minutes prior to
[1:28:39] this he said I will redeem it oh you
[1:28:42] imagine her heart must have sunk and
[1:28:44] then only must have said no no no no
[1:28:47] this is not the way it's supposed to go
[1:28:49] this is not the way it's supposed to be
[1:28:51] look friend when God has a plan there
[1:28:53] ain't enough devils in hell to stop it
[1:28:56] and if God has a plan even the prayers
[1:28:59] of the children of God won't stop it
[1:29:01] either because there's times we pray
[1:29:03] contrary to the will of God but I'm so
[1:29:05] glad his sovereignty overrides even
[1:29:09] sometimes our sincerest wrong
[1:29:12] [Applause]
[1:29:15] prayers oh it seemed like everything was
[1:29:20] lost the whole plan is going to be
[1:29:22] messed up
[1:29:25] and then he said I
[1:29:29] cannot redeem it now the word redeem
[1:29:32] means to set free by paying a price I
[1:29:36] find this amazing on this little chapter
[1:29:38] it's not that big at all but the key
[1:29:40] theme of this chapter whenever you get
[1:29:41] time to read it is redemption the words
[1:29:44] redeem buy Redemption purchase is used
[1:29:48] 15 times in this one so a person cannot
[1:29:52] be redeemed without someone paying the
[1:29:55] price and to says he did not want it he
[1:29:59] he he couldn't do it now you know to us
[1:30:02] salvation is free but don't ever get in
[1:30:04] your mind the Salvation is free on God's
[1:30:08] part it cost God oh my such a price it's
[1:30:13] free to us but it's not free to him and
[1:30:17] the kinman said I cannot redeem it for
[1:30:20] myself lest I Mar
[1:30:25] talk to me now devil talk to
[1:30:27] me the word Mar to
[1:30:31] destroy
[1:30:33] corrupt go to
[1:30:35] ruin
[1:30:38] Decay that's exactly the way he feels
[1:30:42] about you Holy Ghost feel acts 238 young
[1:30:47] ones you would certainly be a reproach
[1:30:51] in one of his modern prostitut systems
[1:30:55] for you to get in there and go to
[1:30:56] telling them that you got baptized in
[1:30:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:31:01] that God had sent a prophet in the last
[1:31:03] days with a message why you certainly
[1:31:05] would mire the good thing they've got
[1:31:07] going he said I don't want them bunch of
[1:31:09] holy rollers around here but the prophet
[1:31:12] tells us in the invisible Union that's
[1:31:14] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:31:17] forth because they've got the second
[1:31:19] Adam's way of acting how was that not
[1:31:23] like a bunch of theologians but acting
[1:31:25] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:28] amen come on somebody and what did they
[1:31:30] say about them second Adam's children
[1:31:33] they said why these men are drunk Peter
[1:31:35] said up and say glory to God we're not
[1:31:38] denying that we're not drunk we're just
[1:31:40] don't using the brand you all think were
[1:31:42] using this is that that was spoken by
[1:31:44] the prophet Jo it shall come to pass in
[1:31:48] the last day sath God I will pour out of
[1:31:51] my spirit upon All Flesh your Sons and
[1:31:54] Daughters shall prophesy come on
[1:31:57] somebody that promise is still going on
[1:31:59] tonight that promise is right here in
[1:32:01] this building tonight if there's
[1:32:03] somebody that ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:05] you can leave out of this place tonight
[1:32:08] with the Holy Ghost because that same
[1:32:11] God is still baptizing people with the
[1:32:13] Holy Ghost and still Healing The Sick
[1:32:16] and still casting out Devils cuz he's
[1:32:18] the same yesterday today and
[1:32:22] forever
[1:32:28] so he
[1:32:32] renounced the r of
[1:32:34] Redemption on the
[1:32:36] account of one
[1:32:40] condition or maybe I should say it like
[1:32:44] this one
[1:32:50] person
[1:32:52] Hallelujah Oh Glory to God so he says no
[1:32:58] no no no no I I I would I would Mar my
[1:33:02] inheritance now it said that to was
[1:33:06] already
[1:33:10] married to the World Council of churches
[1:33:12] I I mean he
[1:33:16] had he was already
[1:33:19] married and had children of course
[1:33:23] [Laughter]
[1:33:26] so you imagine bringing this Holy Roller
[1:33:29] Roose into the World Council I I mean in
[1:33:33] in into your
[1:33:35] home and and Ruth you know I mean his
[1:33:37] other wife maybe you know she had double
[1:33:40] closets in her room because her dresses
[1:33:42] were so short she could double stack you
[1:33:44] know I mean or or or slight drawer and
[1:33:47] and and things like that but Roose Roose
[1:33:49] would require this great big old space
[1:33:51] you know cuz she was a dress wearing
[1:33:53] woman and and of course you know she
[1:33:55] appeared on the outside like a Godly
[1:33:57] woman and a holy woman and all the
[1:33:58] people there that she had this report
[1:34:01] among them that she was a righteous
[1:34:02] godly woman why cuz God had called her
[1:34:05] name called her out of Moab and
[1:34:08] worshiping Kosh to worshiping the Living
[1:34:11] God and he said oh Lord have mercy if I
[1:34:14] brought her in like that now if I could
[1:34:16] get her to cut her hair off and if I
[1:34:17] could do her to get her to do this Ru
[1:34:18] said there ain't no way you getting me
[1:34:20] to do that way ain't no way at all I've
[1:34:22] done seen m name written in the book I
[1:34:25] heard from oopy I recognized the word of
[1:34:28] God was Eagle food I left the other
[1:34:30] thing so to if you plan on marrying me
[1:34:32] let me tell you what I do I pray when
[1:34:35] I'm up I pray when I'm down I sing when
[1:34:37] I'm up I sing when I'm down I jump when
[1:34:40] I'm up I jump when I'm down I've got
[1:34:42] Victory when I'm up I've got Victory
[1:34:44] when I'm down you might hear me get
[1:34:46] alone by myself and I can't speak Hebrew
[1:34:48] no more you might hear me get alone and
[1:34:51] you see me down on my knees oh yeah you
[1:34:54] see me down on my knees and you hear you
[1:34:56] see my lips moving and you think that
[1:34:59] I'm defeated you think that I'm say y
[1:35:01] that's the end of him until you heard me
[1:35:04] say
[1:35:07] amen and you realize I was not saying
[1:35:10] it's over you realize I was not saying I
[1:35:13] quit come on children you realize I was
[1:35:16] not giving up but I was giving my burden
[1:35:19] to the Lord I was giving my trouble to
[1:35:21] the Lord and amen mean so be it and you
[1:35:25] realize oh Lord how can I bring a woman
[1:35:28] like that into my denomination how can I
[1:35:31] bring a woman like that into my system
[1:35:33] she'd tie up the whole
[1:35:35] [Applause]
[1:35:50] thing and
[1:35:52] also
[1:35:58] to had a little bit of a
[1:36:01] crisis a little financial
[1:36:04] crisis he was going to have to come up
[1:36:06] with the
[1:36:08] money to buy this
[1:36:13] property the Bible does not tell us
[1:36:15] about the Kinsman that he was
[1:36:18] wealthy but it tells us that Boaz was
[1:36:25] so this Kinsman did not have the
[1:36:28] wealth
[1:36:31] right y'all
[1:36:33] ready good so the Bible says that Boaz
[1:36:38] was a mighty man of
[1:36:43] wealth and he could afford to buy the
[1:36:48] Earth as a matter of fact he could
[1:36:50] afford to buy the whole
[1:36:51] universe he could afford to buy whatever
[1:36:54] he wanted because he was a mighty man of
[1:36:59] wealth and after all the
[1:37:03] Devil he's a poor
[1:37:07] devil let me just read you some things
[1:37:09] that I put down here today he has no
[1:37:14] love no
[1:37:16] power no mercy no
[1:37:19] inheritance no forgiveness no
[1:37:22] Deliverance
[1:37:24] no eternal life no golden streets no
[1:37:28] Gates of peril oh come on now come on
[1:37:31] now he has no peace to give you oh he
[1:37:34] will not roll your burden away he is a
[1:37:37] very poor well while I've got him down
[1:37:39] let me stomp him let me kick him let me
[1:37:42] humble him right down there where the
[1:37:43] Lord wants you to see him he is not your
[1:37:46] Lord and Master he has got nothing to
[1:37:49] offer you compared to what our lord
[1:37:51] Jesus can give you he has no eternal
[1:37:54] life he has no Eternal peace he has no
[1:37:58] Eternal Kingdom he has no Eternal City
[1:38:01] well glory to God he only has a lake of
[1:38:05] fire to take you to and you will be
[1:38:07] annihilated and destroyed but our Boaz
[1:38:11] has love and he has mercy and he has
[1:38:14] healing and he has deliverance and he
[1:38:17] has Miracles and he has signs and he has
[1:38:20] oh Hallelujah he has joy and speakable
[1:38:24] and full of Glory so which one do you
[1:38:27] want to marry a rich man or a begging
[1:38:35] devil
[1:38:43] Hallelujah so to
[1:38:45] says I love the way this is written
[1:38:48] redeem thou my right and literally in
[1:38:51] the Hebrew he's saying at this this way
[1:38:55] redeem my
[1:38:58] Redemption I can't do
[1:39:00] it I can talk them into sinning but I
[1:39:04] can never get them
[1:39:06] out don't you understand he can get you
[1:39:09] in and he'll get you in over your head
[1:39:12] Sam will always lead you farther than
[1:39:14] you ever intended to go and Satan will
[1:39:17] lead you in there but he can't get you
[1:39:20] out he can't deliver you
[1:39:24] amen well glory to
[1:39:27] God redeem my Redemption perform that
[1:39:33] act of
[1:39:34] redemption which I
[1:39:37] cannot
[1:39:43] perform it's absolutely amazing when you
[1:39:46] look at
[1:39:47] this the
[1:39:48] Kinsman wanted to protect his name
[1:39:55] and his
[1:40:00] inheritance the scripture doesn't even
[1:40:04] mention his
[1:40:09] name so what he wanted so hard to
[1:40:13] protect he wound up losing
[1:40:16] anyway Boaz was willing glory to God
[1:40:21] Boaz was willing
[1:40:24] to Mar his
[1:40:26] name what he
[1:40:28] owned to get
[1:40:30] her and because of that love and
[1:40:33] commitment his scriptures his name is
[1:40:36] found written in God's Eternal
[1:40:39] Word
[1:40:41] hallelujah oh let the world laugh at us
[1:40:43] let them make fun of us let them do
[1:40:45] whatever they want to do but let us
[1:40:46] realize friends we have the greatest
[1:40:48] honor the human beings could ever have
[1:40:50] and that is give our All to Jesus Christ
[1:40:53] oh the world and the devil will tell you
[1:40:55] oh you're you're losing so much you're
[1:40:57] being robbed of so much and tell me what
[1:40:59] am I being robbed of tell me what have I
[1:41:02] being robbed of my goodness if I live a
[1:41:04] couple more months I'll be 68 years old
[1:41:06] which means I've been preaching 50 years
[1:41:07] of my life been Pion for 40 and and been
[1:41:10] a Christian you know all these years y
[1:41:13] Brother Don do you regret it are you
[1:41:14] kidding me you kidding me I've never
[1:41:17] smoked I've never drunk I've never been
[1:41:19] high well I shouldn't really say that I
[1:41:21] have been high in Heavenly places in
[1:41:22] Christ Jesus but I ain't never done none
[1:41:24] of that would I want to go back and
[1:41:26] relive it are you kidding me the way I
[1:41:29] look at it I'm married to the King of
[1:41:31] Kings and the Lord of lords and that Low
[1:41:33] Down Rotten devil he ain't got no Heaven
[1:41:36] he ain't got no righteousness he ain't
[1:41:38] got no Purity why would I leave my Lord
[1:41:41] Jesus and follow a like that why
[1:41:44] would I leave the King of Kings and the
[1:41:47] Lord of lords and go following the devil
[1:41:50] and him Lead Me to Hell No thank you
[1:42:00] so notice what Boaz did he took the
[1:42:05] risk of
[1:42:08] love and
[1:42:11] obedience and his name is found written
[1:42:14] in the scripture and held and high
[1:42:21] honor praise
[1:42:26] God Ruth
[1:42:29] 4:7 now this was the manner in former
[1:42:31] time in
[1:42:33] Israel
[1:42:34] concerning
[1:42:36] redeeming and
[1:42:38] concerning
[1:42:41] changing for to confirm all
[1:42:45] things a man plucked
[1:42:52] off his
[1:42:54] shoe now that's weird to us right we
[1:42:59] said you imagine you're going into a
[1:43:01] courthouse and the next closing you got
[1:43:02] brother Paul you go in and you tell the
[1:43:04] buyer and the seller now y'all trade
[1:43:06] shoes they're going to say oh dear
[1:43:08] God and this guy processed our
[1:43:13] loan but now
[1:43:16] remember it was perfectly fitting for
[1:43:18] the
[1:43:20] time so you mean changing of the
[1:43:24] shoe was a sign of changing of property
[1:43:27] and deeds and confirming it
[1:43:31] also so then you would take your shoe
[1:43:34] off and give it to his neighbor and this
[1:43:39] was a testimony in Israel we said why in
[1:43:44] the world would they do that brother
[1:43:46] Donnie because they didn't have
[1:43:48] Tennessee walking
[1:43:51] horses to walk around their property or
[1:43:53] golf carts or 44s or
[1:43:57] four-wheelers but they walked over their
[1:44:00] property in their
[1:44:06] shoes so everywhere their foot
[1:44:10] touched was a sign of their
[1:44:13] inheritance so to give your shoe to
[1:44:17] someone else seal the deal because them
[1:44:21] shoes had walked on these 593 Acres
[1:44:26] trees ponds Creeks you know whatever's
[1:44:29] there these shoes have walked on them so
[1:44:33] if I could get you to give me your shoe
[1:44:36] that meant you were forfeiting your
[1:44:41] right
[1:44:43] Hallelujah don't you understand why our
[1:44:45] lord Jesus had to come down to the
[1:44:48] Earth and kick off his shoe as it was
[1:44:53] take on mortality and humble himself and
[1:44:57] remove his
[1:44:59] shoes would you Marvel then that at the
[1:45:02] Last Supper he would get a basin of
[1:45:05] water and sit down and remove the shoes
[1:45:08] of his disciples and wash their
[1:45:13] feet why they're fixing to walk new
[1:45:17] ground Holy Ghost
[1:45:20] ground Peter sandals won't be able to
[1:45:23] take him there he'll need some shoes of
[1:45:26] Jesus Oh Glory to God so by removing the
[1:45:31] sandal notice now since they walked off
[1:45:34] the land this is the way they did it so
[1:45:36] this was the sign of their
[1:45:39] inheritance all right now
[1:45:42] to I want you to forfeit your
[1:45:46] rights take off your
[1:45:51] shoe
[1:45:59] now would y'all want to walk like there
[1:46:00] for the rest of your
[1:46:02] life I would to God we could see it
[1:46:05] tonight in the eyes of God if we could
[1:46:07] look at it right we would realize the
[1:46:09] devil is as barefooted as he can
[1:46:15] be and every promise you get a hold of
[1:46:18] that you find your name written on and
[1:46:20] you have a need for it Prince means
[1:46:29] possession to reach over and take the
[1:46:31] devil's shoe off give me my healing
[1:46:42] back now you see since they walked on
[1:46:44] the land then by removing the
[1:46:48] sandals of the
[1:46:50] Guardian a widow removed his
[1:46:54] authorization to administer the land of
[1:46:58] her
[1:47:00] household don't you understand where
[1:47:02] that shoe who it was took off in front
[1:47:05] of it was took off and the front of
[1:47:12] us give it up
[1:47:16] devil let me have it
[1:47:21] do glory to God I wish I was out in the
[1:47:25] woods by myself I feel another language
[1:47:27] coming
[1:47:29] on Oh
[1:47:32] Glory take your shoe off give it to
[1:47:37] me I'm sick of you robbing me of my joy
[1:47:41] I'm sick of you robbing me of my health
[1:47:44] I'm sick of you robbing me of me and my
[1:47:47] children going to church and sitting
[1:47:48] there I'm sick of you stealing my wife
[1:47:51] away from me my husband away from me I'm
[1:47:53] sick of you stealing my rock for me to
[1:47:55] have the Holy Ghost give me your
[1:48:04] shoe now listen I know this seems
[1:48:07] strange to you but in the hurian and the
[1:48:10] newsi
[1:48:12] texts which was found to be written in a
[1:48:15] uniform style in other words on a
[1:48:19] cylinder of clay and they didn't have a
[1:48:22] book The Way We Do today but they would
[1:48:23] take and write them on wet moist clay
[1:48:27] and they actually have written found
[1:48:30] transactions that were buried in the
[1:48:32] sand and beneath rocks and all that the
[1:48:34] hurian text is one of them and the newsy
[1:48:36] text are others and they actually have
[1:48:39] it written there about this that land
[1:48:43] transfers in the newsy text involved
[1:48:47] replacing the old owner's
[1:48:51] foot on the land
[1:48:53] with that of the new
[1:48:56] owner so when they would go out and
[1:48:58] close the deal instead of sitting in the
[1:49:00] lawyer's office and signing 57 pages of
[1:49:03] stuff you don't even know what you've
[1:49:04] signed away and you're just sitting
[1:49:07] there hoping that that's the last face
[1:49:09] because of your hands about to fall off
[1:49:11] you say so what would they do then
[1:49:13] brother Paul had a piece of property he
[1:49:15] wanted to sell me we go out to that
[1:49:17] property and brother Paul stands on that
[1:49:20] property and then whenever the deal is
[1:49:22] made he removes his feet off of that
[1:49:27] property and I step mine back on it he
[1:49:31] has forfeited his rights to claim
[1:49:35] ownership to that property it is no
[1:49:38] longer his well glory to God can I have
[1:49:40] a few more minutes thank you I'm going
[1:49:41] to take them anyway whether you want me
[1:49:42] to have or not notice the prophet said

[1:55:51] okay
[1:55:53] if he can't make a flea or a fly or one
[1:55:57] Speck of
[1:55:58] dust why would you believe one word he
[1:56:01] has to
[1:56:02] say call him what he is a
[1:56:06] liar a liar a cheat a
[1:56:11] deceiver let's stand up and we'll
[1:56:14] Worship the Lord while he's trying to
[1:56:15] make a little
[1:56:21] d
[1:56:27] let me read this and we'll close it's I
[1:56:29] need to include this if you don't mind
[1:56:31] now Satan knows this same principle
[1:56:33] Footprints means
[1:56:36] possession for Satan had the Earth the
[1:56:39] very rocks that he once walked up and
[1:56:42] down on the
[1:56:44] earth burning
[1:56:51] brimstonegunsmithing
[1:56:53] earth when it was a burning
[1:56:59] volcanic so when God is causing the
[1:57:02] Earth in its primeval stage Satan's
[1:57:05] walking up and down on it this is mine
[1:57:08] this is mine I claim it I want it
[1:57:11] Footprints means
[1:57:15] possession I want you to notice
[1:57:17] something then the prophet said God put
[1:57:20] back into the hands of a man a way back
[1:57:23] to what he was looking for he had to
[1:57:25] weep no more yet when he broke the
[1:57:28] backbone of Satan there Cal the backbone
[1:57:32] of
[1:57:33] sin I want you to notice in that
[1:57:35] paragraph above let me tie these two
[1:57:36] together now them same rocks that had
[1:57:40] cooled
[1:57:42] off when Jesus died at Calvary beled
[1:57:48] o the Earth got sick and started
[1:57:51] vomiting
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:57:55] and when the earth started vomiting it
[1:57:58] vomited up some of the
[1:58:01] footprints that were made thousands of
[1:58:03] years before in
[1:58:08] lava
[1:58:11] uhhuh when Jesus died at Calvary it
[1:58:13] belts Force out of the earth them same
[1:58:16] rocks that had cooled off I remember he
[1:58:19] walked on it when it was fire
[1:58:23] and left his
[1:58:25] Footprints then it cooled off and he
[1:58:28] said I got it there's
[1:58:32] evidence before there was ever a man
[1:58:35] here I was
[1:58:37] here before there every woman I was here
[1:58:40] there's my
[1:58:42] footprints and cooled off
[1:58:50] Stone Hallelujah
[1:58:54] so when Jesus died at Calvary the earth
[1:58:58] started shaking
[1:59:00] Shak what was he doing belching up the
[1:59:07] ownership busting up them Footprints I
[1:59:11] mean busting them all to pieces you know
[1:59:14] what's amazing is the prophet said I
[1:59:16] read read the other day he said I read a
[1:59:18] book the other day and he said it just
[1:59:20] so thrilled me and he said that they
[1:59:22] said they said that Adam died and was
[1:59:27] buried on the very same place where
[1:59:30] Jesus died and he said I thought oh Lord
[1:59:34] could that be was that the way it was
[1:59:37] that Adam died and was buried and here
[1:59:40] come the second man Adam and died and
[1:59:43] rose again but he didn't just rise from
[1:59:45] the grave but them footprints that
[1:59:48] Insignia that sign of ownership he said
[1:59:50] come on Earth help me out a little bit
[1:59:53] go to shaken and the Earth began to
[1:59:54] respond to the voice of God and the
[1:59:56] earth started shouting woo glory to God
[1:59:59] amen hallelujah thank you Jesus thank
[2:00:01] you Jesus went to kicking out Footprints
[2:00:03] out there and God just busted them all
[2:00:05] up he said hey devil hey devil I want to
[2:00:08] know where your Deeds at I want to know
[2:00:11] where your Deeds at well I I know I walk
[2:00:14] right down by Calvary there I want you
[2:00:16] to show me where your ownership is
[2:00:18] that's the way it does a real son or
[2:00:20] daughter of God when the devil says he's
[2:00:22] mine She's Mine He's Mine and Jesus said
[2:00:25] I want you to know they ain't yours no
[2:00:28] more I done shook hell out of their life
[2:00:31] I shook drinking out of their life I
[2:00:33] shook lying out of their life your
[2:00:35] Footprints are
[2:00:45] destroyed and he broke the backbone of
[2:00:49] Satan di at Calvary the backbone of sin
[2:00:53] and of
[2:00:55] sickness our sins are forgiven no more
[2:00:59] can Satan black us from God there's a
[2:01:04] highway made a telephone sitting up
[2:01:06] there and there's a line to
[2:01:09] Glory it brings every person in reach of
[2:01:13] that line Ruth 48 therefore the Kinsman
[2:01:18] said unto Boaz buy it for thee and he
[2:01:22] drew
[2:01:24] off his
[2:01:26] shoe I forfeit my rights to your bride
[2:01:31] she's way too noisy for
[2:01:37] me I read the other day friends and one
[2:01:40] of the playoffs football y'all know of
[2:01:43] course I'm a big sports fan
[2:01:46] right but I read for some of the people
