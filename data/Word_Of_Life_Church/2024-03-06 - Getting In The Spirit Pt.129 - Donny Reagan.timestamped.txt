[31:26] all
[31:28] [Applause]
[31:37] praise the
[31:38] Lord let's turn to the Book of
[31:40] Revelation tonight if you would
[31:42] Revelation chapter 10 verse
[31:45] 7 question answers tomorrow night
[31:49] 7:00 also I want to uh make make mention
[31:53] of it to you that brother Keith Phillips
[31:54] got to go home today at his procedure
[31:58] and went well so we're thankful to the
[32:00] Lord for that um want to just continue
[32:03] to remember our brother that said I
[32:04] could take several weeks for him to get
[32:07] his strength and stuff back he really
[32:09] really weak so just keep him in prayer
[32:11] if you would Revelation chapter 10 verse
[32:15] 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[32:17] seventh
[32:19] angel when he shall begin to
[32:22] sound now remember when the prophet
[32:24] quoted this he said it's not when he
[32:26] first first started
[32:28] out but it's when it began to
[32:31] sound his
[32:33] message so in the days of the voice of
[32:35] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[32:38] sound the mystery of God should be
[32:42] finished as he hath declared to his
[32:45] servants the
[32:47] prophets and the voice which I heard
[32:49] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[32:52] go and take the little
[32:53] book which is open in the hand of the
[32:56] Angel which stand upon the sea and upon
[32:59] the Earth and I went unto the angel and
[33:02] said unto him give me the little book
[33:06] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[33:10] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[33:14] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[33:19] now this is one way that I've learned
[33:21] down through the years to watch
[33:23] people and they say they absorb the
[33:26] revelation of this end time of this word
[33:30] and you watch their life and see if
[33:33] everything about this message for years
[33:36] and years is nothing but
[33:39] sweet more than likely they ain't got it
[33:42] right
[33:43] yet because if it's really the truth and
[33:47] it's revealed to you in the right way it
[33:50] will be sweet but there will be such
[33:53] bitterness that will come with it you
[33:56] will pay a price if you believe this
[33:59] word right now you can believe this word
[34:03] from an intellectual conception and
[34:04] believe it wrong you'll pay very little
[34:06] price but if you believe it right you
[34:10] will pay a tremendous price now look at
[34:12] John what a strange thing this would be
[34:14] and I took the little book out of the
[34:16] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[34:18] my mouth as sweet as
[34:21] honey and as soon as I had eaten it my
[34:26] belly
[34:27] was bitter so when it moves from the
[34:30] mouth to the digestion to living it
[34:34] every day complying to the outside
[34:38] requirements the inside requirements the
[34:41] sanctification stage of it all that's
[34:44] where a lot of folks drop off and it's
[34:47] the bitterness and they don't understand
[34:50] they love the sweetness of it there
[34:52] ain't nothing ever been as sweet as this
[34:54] is but there ain't nothing ever been as
[34:57] bitter as it can be as well ain't that
[35:01] something y'all looking at me strange
[35:02] how
[35:03] come we just look at the sweet side
[35:05] don't we that's what we look at now
[35:08] watch and he said unto me thou must
[35:12] prophesy again before many peoples and
[35:16] Nations and
[35:19] tongues and Kings H so was Jesus telling
[35:24] John that he was going to have a turn
[35:30] Ministry well Jesus told him he was
[35:32] going to prophesy
[35:35] again that do we believe John's raising
[35:38] from the
[35:40] dead well I got you on that one didn't
[35:44] I no but the Book of Revelation is doing
[35:48] that isn't it amazing that a book can
[35:52] represent a man or a man can repres
[35:56] represent a book Let's bow our heads
[36:01] together father we so love you tonight
[36:04] we thank you for the opportunity to be
[36:05] gathered here tonight under the opes of
[36:08] the revealed word of this last day we're
[36:11] thankful for every word of every day
[36:14] that you've given down through the age
[36:16] but we are so grateful for the word that
[36:19] has come to us in our day we desire to
[36:24] take this word and eat it all how many
[36:27] sweet Services have we had how many
[36:31] sweet meals that were just so awesome
[36:34] and the presence of God was so wonderful
[36:37] and Revelation so flooded our souls and
[36:41] then maybe tomorrow or the next day or
[36:43] next week or next month some bitter
[36:46] things go to happening in our lives and
[36:48] we wonder what is going on nothing just
[36:52] proof of
[36:53] digestion I pray you would help us
[36:55] tonight father
[36:57] as we look into your word reveal it to
[36:59] us in a clearer way we ask in the name
[37:02] of the Lord Jesus and the saints of God
[37:05] said amen amen God bless you you may be
[37:11] seated so the Book of Revelation 10 had
[37:14] been
[37:16] opened by the only one who was worthy to
[37:19] do it
[37:22] Christ which happened in Revelation
[37:24] chapter
[37:25] 5 then the seal will start breaking in
[37:28] Revelation CH
[37:29] 6 and then it opens up to Revelation
[37:34] 101 whenever he sees another Mighty
[37:37] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[37:39] a cloud and a rainbow on his head all
[37:43] these symbols of course and Declarations
[37:45] of something that God was showing then
[37:48] we come to a very peculiar part in that
[37:52] John is commanded to take the book and
[37:56] to to get the book out of the hand of
[37:58] the
[37:59] Angel it must have been I know in Vision
[38:02] most of us have never had visions of
[38:04] course like this but there must be still
[38:07] a sense of humanity and human feelings
[38:12] and human persuasion when you're under
[38:15] the influence of these types of Visions
[38:18] we know that the prophet would relate
[38:20] different visions that he would see and
[38:22] things that he would experience and he
[38:24] would have human action going between
[38:28] the Divine and the natural and it would
[38:31] be hard for him to tell if he was in a
[38:33] vision or if it was just real life so
[38:37] with John you must have been the same
[38:39] way wondering is this a vision or is
[38:42] this real so the angel says go take the
[38:45] book out of himy that's there and so he
[38:48] goes and he takes it and he said now he
[38:50] gives him into give into instruction one
[38:53] instruction two instruction three he has
[38:55] to follow him in the exact order that
[38:56] God gives it so he goes takes the book
[38:58] they said now eat the book go ahead and
[39:00] eat it so he takes the book of course it
[39:03] was assemble he goes to eating it oh so
[39:06] sweet in his mouth and it wasn't no time
[39:10] till it lands down into his belly into
[39:13] his stomach now the reason of course
[39:16] that God wanted this book revealed was
[39:19] because of the contents that was in the
[39:22] book so what was it well it was a love
[39:25] story it was a story of redemption it
[39:27] was a story of manifestation it was a
[39:30] story of Life Death a story of sin it
[39:34] had so many different things in the book
[39:37] in each age there would be a certain
[39:39] allocation of that word that would be
[39:41] given to people on the Earth the elect
[39:44] of God would be gerti by the opening of
[39:47] that word it would pull them others
[39:50] would come around for a while and come
[39:52] around for a season and then they would
[39:55] finally realize this is not for me this
[39:58] is not who I am and then they would
[40:00] begin to find fault and they would pull
[40:03] this way and pull that way and pull that
[40:05] way but to the elect of God it was the
[40:08] spirit of God calling to them because
[40:12] when you recognize the word of God is
[40:14] Eagle food then you left the other thing
[40:18] and you actually heard from your
[40:21] theophany so your theophany in the sixth
[40:24] Dimension now don't ask me to explain it
[40:26] because I can't but your
[40:28] theophonic is a part of you that you've
[40:31] not yet seen a part of you you've not
[40:34] yet known it's an attribute of God that
[40:38] is your body in a spiritual sense you
[40:41] bypassed it you didn't go through it
[40:43] like in the beginning we should have but
[40:45] you bypassed it but yet it's still your
[40:48] identity always was always will be and
[40:52] somehow when the message of the hour
[40:55] begins to sink up with your soul God
[40:58] allows your theophany to present to you
[41:02] a link an
[41:04] identification of the message of the
[41:06] hour and you actually not hearing just
[41:09] from the message but you're actually
[41:11] hearing from your
[41:13] theophany now you see why that others
[41:16] cannot ever really truly identify from
[41:18] the soul with the message of the hour is
[41:22] because they have no theophany waiting
[41:25] in the sixth dimension
[41:26] that actually ties them to the revealed
[41:30] word of the hour so the contents of
[41:34] what's in the book is what's so
[41:36] important for God to get so it's the
[41:39] title deed to everything that Adam had
[41:43] it's the title deed to everything Adam
[41:46] was and everything we were supposed to
[41:48] be before the fall and then it was
[41:52] sealed up after the fall and the book
[41:54] does not go back into a library in
[41:57] heaven somewhere but goes into the hand
[42:00] of almighty God now remember God the
[42:03] Eternal as the Hebrew actually
[42:06] identifies him it actually calls him the
[42:10] Eternal the Eternal so the Eternal even
[42:14] thy God it is him this is the name by
[42:17] which he made him manifest himself
[42:19] manifest to Abraham and this is what the
[42:22] Jews call him by so the Eternal had this
[42:25] Within himself and he knew that it would
[42:28] come to pass and there was nothing that
[42:30] would ever stop it but there's this long
[42:33] process by which he will bring the
[42:36] inhabitants of the earth whose names are
[42:38] on the Lamb's Book of Life he will bring
[42:41] them back to where they will be able to
[42:43] take the book for their life he will
[42:47] find them in such chaos he will find
[42:50] them in such utter distress and they
[42:52] will feel like there is no hope and the
[42:55] ray of life will begin to break around
[42:57] their life and they will know something
[43:01] supernatural has happened to them and
[43:03] it's link them somehow to God himself
[43:07] not not a church not a preacher not a
[43:11] feeling not an emotion but somehow it's
[43:14] something beyond all of that all that
[43:16] comes with it aren't you glad that it
[43:18] does now you see whenever uh someone
[43:21] Embraces the revealed word of the hour
[43:24] it's been in every age but when Reve
[43:27] whenever the reveal word of this hour
[43:29] has actually struck their soul and it
[43:31] becomes what they think what they say is
[43:33] open I like to watch people whenever
[43:36] they say they've embraced it and I like
[43:37] to see what they do with the revealed
[43:39] word but I also like to watch and see
[43:42] what do they do with the Bible how do
[43:45] they relate the reveal word of the hour
[43:48] to the Bible do they think that the
[43:52] Bible is no longer needed do they think
[43:56] that the Bible is just something that we
[43:58] no longer really reference to that much
[44:01] because we don't really need it anymore
[44:04] well that lets me know whether they're a
[44:06] preacher or whoever they are that the
[44:08] revealed word has not really come open
[44:11] to that individual because when it come
[44:14] open to our prophet he did not want to
[44:17] replace the Bible with and take his
[44:21] books and just say now you no longer
[44:23] need the Bible at all but he would
[44:25] always po us himself back to the holy
[44:28] scriptures is that right so if that's
[44:31] what it done to him then I'm convinc it
[44:34] will do the same thing to you and I so
[44:37] instead of the Bible becoming just a
[44:40] book that we used to need and we used to
[44:43] read and it it gathers dust somewhere in
[44:46] a in a bookshelf I believe if that same
[44:49] thing happen to him will happen to us it
[44:53] will do the exact same thing and what it
[44:55] did did to him was it never put him to
[44:58] where that you find brother brandham
[45:00] carrying his books after the seals come
[45:03] open to the pull pit and him reading
[45:06] texts out of his books praise the Lord
[45:09] but I find him packing his Bible still
[45:13] there they' still got his Bibles of
[45:15] course you've seen them any of you
[45:16] that's been there and you've seen his
[45:17] Bible you can see the notes that we have
[45:20] back here in the library and the in the
[45:21] glass case there that they're trading
[45:23] out for us from time to time and what
[45:25] what you will see is that it opens up
[45:27] with a title and there will always be a
[45:30] scripture right up on top and brother
[45:32] bam does not start out was one of his
[45:35] quotes and brother Brenham does not just
[45:37] have quote after quote after quote of
[45:39] himself and absolutely leaves out Isaiah
[45:42] Jeremiah Zachariah Zephaniah habac
[45:45] Malachi Matthew Mark Luke and John
[45:47] Philippians Romans Galatians praise the
[45:49] Lord but what does it do actually when
[45:52] the seals come open to him it helped him
[45:55] to to see that the Bible itself actually
[45:59] became a new book now notice it's not a
[46:03] different translation now we're living
[46:06] of course in the Daya where that we have
[46:08] many many many translations I'm not
[46:10] necessarily against all of them some of
[46:12] them I am against because they're
[46:14] against the original that's right but
[46:17] there are many of them that will come
[46:19] and take the Greek word and the Hebrew
[46:21] word and give a little further
[46:23] understanding than what the 1611 King
[46:26] James version did but yet we didn't come
[46:29] the opening of the seals didn't bring a
[46:31] William brandham version of the Bible it
[46:34] did not bring a message version of the
[46:37] Bible but what it did was it made the
[46:40] Bible a new book why would that be
[46:43] because with the opening of The Seven
[46:46] Seals then the contents that was in
[46:48] there you would read your same Bible
[46:51] over again but at you're reading it now
[46:55] under the evening light with the seals
[46:58] that have come open not only in
[47:00] Jeffersonville but in you and in your
[47:03] own understanding it doesn't do any good
[47:06] for you to read the seals and memorize
[47:08] the seals and know what he said on page
[47:11] so and so and paage so and so and paage
[47:13] so and so if them seals never come open
[47:16] to you you see God don't want you and I
[47:19] to grab the seal Book and know the seal
[47:22] book by memory and be able to quote the
[47:24] seal book if we've never been handed the
[47:27] book of our own life what good does it
[47:30] do us and then we go through life trying
[47:33] to figure out well what am I supposed to
[47:34] do where do I belong well I'm going over
[47:37] here it's pitiful how many message folks
[47:39] have followed this move till it kind of
[47:41] petered out and then they followed that
[47:43] move and they B blowed up and then the
[47:45] move went to that move and they've been
[47:47] from one move to another to another
[47:50] right inside the message y'all going to
[47:51] preach with a me tonight you know why
[47:54] it's it's evident they never found what
[47:57] they are looking for they're still
[47:59] searching brother Charlie Cox preached a
[48:01] message down at the church where I was
[48:03] at in Kentucky years ago and he entitled
[48:06] it still shopping and he took that how
[48:09] that women like to go and they shop and
[48:11] they go look in one dress and look in
[48:12] another dress and another dress and he
[48:14] used sister his wife you know Sister
[48:16] Nelly and how she loved to shop brother
[48:18] Charlie like a lot of us men he didn't
[48:20] like to shop at all and he said you know
[48:22] once you really get the real thing and
[48:25] you're looking for the right thing in
[48:26] the word then you're not shopping for
[48:28] another you've actually got what you're
[48:30] looking for and I don't know how you all
[48:33] feel tonight I'm not looking for another
[48:35] church age messenger I'm not looking for
[48:37] another Prophet I'm not looking for
[48:39] another preacher to come and explain
[48:42] what he said somebody just tell me what
[48:44] he said I'm looking for Ley that wants
[48:47] to believe what he said and live what he
[48:50] said and let the Lord Jesus manifest
[48:53] himself in our life every day so that we
[48:56] can be a light to this city that we live
[48:58] in so you can be a light to the people
[49:01] that you work with cuz there might still
[49:04] be some around here that needs to hear
[49:06] about this great life but as long as we
[49:09] focus and Satan can keep us just on the
[49:11] past in March of 1963 and we memorize
[49:15] and memorize sure memorize the seal book
[49:18] oh yes absolutely you'd be better off to
[49:20] memorize that than you would Better
[49:22] Homes and Garden you'd be better off to
[49:24] memorize that than you would tick talk
[49:25] and and Instagram and Facebook all that
[49:28] bunch of garbage you'd be better off to
[49:30] memorize scripture than you would a
[49:31] bunch of nonsense but don't stop at
[49:34] memorization because Revelation is not
[49:38] memorization and memorization is not
[49:41] Revelation but when if you see them
[49:43] seals broke open and it reveal the
[49:47] contents of not only the Bible but also
[49:50] the mystery of your life Who Am I who am
[49:54] I where where do I belong where do I
[49:57] belong in Christ where's the church that
[49:59] I go to who's my pastor it's really sad
[50:02] that a lot of folks sit under a preacher
[50:04] for years and still don't have a
[50:05] revelation of who the pastor is so they
[50:08] think they want to be over there and
[50:09] they think they want to be over there
[50:11] and they think they want to be over
[50:12] there that's really pitiful you need a
[50:15] revelation you need a revelation of who
[50:18] you are you need a revelation of who
[50:20] Jesus Christ is you need a revelation of
[50:23] your position to him that you're not
[50:26] Church you're not some bunch of dirt
[50:28] bags that's just trying to hang on
[50:30] you've been redeemed by the blood of the
[50:32] Lamb you're forgiven you're washed
[50:35] you're Justified you're clean come on
[50:37] somebody well that's what God wants us
[50:40] to be and that's why it's so essential
[50:43] that the spirit of God open up to us the
[50:45] mystery of who
[50:49] me me and not only me but you it won't
[50:53] do you any good to say I believe brother
[50:55] Donnie knows who he is I believe he
[50:57] knows what he's supposed to do I do I do
[51:01] yes I'm glad I live in a present tense
[51:05] revelation of who I am and what I'm
[51:08] supposed to be doing I'm not living back
[51:10] 20 years ago come on church I'm not
[51:13] living back whenever I first come here
[51:15] and was over at the other building I
[51:17] have
[51:18] updated I said I have updated I am
[51:22] living in
[51:23] 2024 anybody else here with me so I've
[51:26] got a vision for 2024 my vision for what
[51:30] it was in 1987 1988 when I first come
[51:34] here it's not the same tonight or today
[51:37] oh it's different than it was you say
[51:39] why brother Donnie well don't you
[51:40] believe the message I believe it now
[51:42] more than I believed it then and I
[51:44] believe we need to preach it I believe
[51:46] we need to say Ament to it and I believe
[51:48] it needs to be made manifest in our life
[51:51] in a greater way than it was in the 80s
[51:54] don't you
[51:56] now watch I want you to understand
[51:57] whenever the prophet says this now it's
[51:59] hard to say this it's very hard because
[52:01] speaking to people who feel the same way
[52:03] I do and the way I have been for many
[52:05] years but since the opening of those
[52:07] Seven Seals of them Angels just behind
[52:10] the mountain Yonder now nowh he standing
[52:13] in Phoenix them Angels standing just
[52:15] behind the mountain Yonder this has
[52:18] become a new book a new book so it
[52:22] wasn't like that he got a new
[52:24] international version or say he got you
[52:26] know the the Living Translation it
[52:28] wasn't even then it wasn't even around
[52:30] there so he hadn't got the Benson
[52:32] version he had got not the the wickl
[52:34] version but what it was the word of God
[52:36] had so broke open that it become to see
[52:39] things in there that had never seen
[52:42] before now this is a man that had been
[52:43] preaching for decades of his life but
[52:46] the Bible became a new book it's the
[52:49] things that's been hid is being revealed
[52:52] as God promised in Revelation 10 he
[52:54] would do it and we're privileged people
[52:58] that God has chosen of the earth that we
[53:01] might see and understand these things
[53:05] can anybody say
[53:07] Amen which is not some mythical fleshly
[53:10] Mind of a person Tred to make it up it's
[53:13] the word of God made manifest proven
[53:16] that it's right proven not by science
[53:19] but by God so when the seals come open
[53:23] then it did not replace scripture it did
[53:26] not replace the Bible but it simply was
[53:29] more information about what the prophets
[53:33] had already said now remember not
[53:35] replacement I know you may wonder why do
[53:37] I keep emphasizing that because many of
[53:40] the doctrines that have been around the
[53:42] message for years have been replacement
[53:45] to scripture you cannot back them up by
[53:48] the Bible I can take my Bible and prove
[53:51] the doctrines of this
[53:54] message
[53:55] as a matter of fact that's what I do
[53:57] when I introduce the message to somebody
[53:59] I intentionally don't use quotes what
[54:02] good is to tell them what a prophet said
[54:03] when they don't even know really what a
[54:05] prophet is so what do I do I use my
[54:09] Bible praise the Lord when I went to CH
[54:12] China when I go to India different
[54:14] places where they never seen before I
[54:16] take my message of course on my laptop I
[54:19] took message books but I never
[54:21] approached it from the perspective of
[54:23] the message itself I was was preaching
[54:25] the message under the opes of the
[54:29] scripture so I would take the scripture
[54:32] and then I told brother Murphy when we
[54:33] get there brother Murphy let's have a
[54:35] question answers first service I want to
[54:37] see where they are I want to preach up
[54:39] here if they're here if they're here I
[54:42] don't want to preach down here I want to
[54:44] find out where they are and then I'll
[54:46] study accordingly and then I'll wrot
[54:48] down all the scriptures brother Murphy
[54:50] take it down to the office you imagine
[54:52] communist printers on communist
[54:55] computers and they're printing out
[54:57] scriptures from the holy word of God so
[54:59] I wanted everybody there to have a copy
[55:01] of it so we could fly cuz I had a lot of
[55:03] ground to cover in a few days so every
[55:06] one of them would be handed out a copy
[55:08] of that brother Bisal said he listened
[55:09] to it on the godhead he said I hadn't
[55:11] listened to it for 15 minutes I felt so
[55:14] sorry for the devil cuz I knew exactly
[55:16] what he was in for why because once we
[55:19] see the message of the hour we don't
[55:22] have to hide our Bibles we don't have to
[55:24] say I don't know how to back it up with
[55:26] a Bible I can take God's scripture and
[55:29] preach to you election for ordination
[55:33] predestination sanctification baptism of
[55:36] the Holy Ghost water baptism in the name
[55:39] of our Lord Jesus come on somebody I can
[55:41] preach to you a Rapture I can preach to
[55:44] you why oh I couldn't do it years ago
[55:47] but the seals come open and it helped me
[55:50] to realize we don't need to shine our
[55:52] Bible we need to embrace our Bible we
[55:55] need to eat that word of God come on
[55:58] somebody say
[56:00] Amen now this is what happened to the
[56:02] prophet notice immediately the Feast of
[56:05] the trumpets after that the angels of
[56:07] the Lord appeared and told about the
[56:09] seven trumpets or the Seven Seals that I
[56:11] was to return back to Jefferson and
[56:13] preach the Seven Seals and if I ever
[56:15] said anything that was inspired it was
[56:19] in that there where the angel of the
[56:21] Lord met us and the Bible became a new
[56:25] Bible there it opened up and revealed
[56:28] all the things that the reformers and
[56:30] things had left out it was the complete
[56:33] revelation of Jesus Christ allog
[56:36] together new to us but
[56:40] perfectly exactly
[56:46] with I don't know about you I want a
[56:49] scriptural
[56:50] church when I like to go when I go hear
[56:53] a message preacher I want want to not
[56:55] only hear a message quoting scripture I
[56:58] want to hear a man that can also take
[57:01] scripture and message and put it
[57:05] together praise the Lord a man Dodges
[57:09] scripture that's a red flag to me
[57:12] perfectly exactly with the scripture
[57:15] that was the word which has always been
[57:19] I was so inspired and directed and I say
[57:24] Amen to that and where did the spirit of
[57:27] the word of God where did it Point him
[57:29] back to right back to the scripture
[57:31] because remember he had preached for
[57:33] years and years that that white horse
[57:35] rider was the Lord Jesus yeah he
[57:38] preached for years and years and when he
[57:40] got ready to preach the first seal that
[57:42] first day when he was studying and he
[57:43] said I was ready to make a horrible
[57:46] mistake what was that mistake preaching
[57:49] it the same way he had preached it for
[57:51] years and he opened the scripture and
[57:53] had read that for years and read about
[57:56] that white horse and said it was the
[57:57] Lord Jesus conquering forth can you
[57:59] imagine how that man felt when the angel
[58:02] come the first day and opened up that
[58:05] first seal and when he saw it there by
[58:07] vision and he looked at that white horse
[58:09] and that Rider and he thought oh my God
[58:12] that's not
[58:13] Jesus it's the
[58:17] Antichrist Jack I wonder how he
[58:19] felt you don't know what it's like is
[58:22] the preacher to realize you said
[58:23] something wrong it's like oh Lord have
[58:25] mercy I can't believe I said that oh no
[58:28] I said that
[58:30] wrong you imagine him realizing that he
[58:33] preached that years he preached it wrong
[58:37] but I can follow a man like this that he
[58:40] can get in the pull pit and admit that
[58:42] he preached it
[58:43] wrong praise the Lord somebody oh
[58:46] Hallelujah now watch so it become a new
[58:50] book and when it did he had to change
[58:52] some of the things that he preached I
[58:54] realize some of the message folks don't
[58:56] like it going this way but he used to
[58:58] believe and preach that leprosy was
[59:01] contagious he used to believe and preach
[59:04] that Mary produced an egg come on now I
[59:07] can rattle a bunch of them off of you
[59:08] you go to challenge them in your spirit
[59:10] don't do it don't do
[59:15] it why can't people change with him
[59:18] because they make a God out of it you
[59:20] want to make him infallible when you do
[59:22] that you're going exactly contrary to
[59:24] what he
[59:26] taught praise the Lord so it was a an
[59:30] open book a new book not a replacement
[59:34] now but a new book so the seals look
[59:37] different justification looked different
[59:39] we preach justification but not exactly
[59:42] like Luther did we preached
[59:43] sanctification we'll hear a little bit
[59:45] about this weekend Lord Brother but not
[59:46] exactly like the Methodist did that plus
[59:49] we preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:52] and the restoration of gifts but not
[59:54] exactly like Aza street right amen come
[59:56] on somebody but we preach that and we
[1:00:00] believe that but how do I preach
[1:00:02] justification now I preach justification
[1:00:04] now with the light of the invisible
[1:00:07] Union which was in November 1965 at Jack
[1:00:10] Morris that you're not just Justified
[1:00:12] but you never done it in the first place
[1:00:14] you see Luther couldn't preach
[1:00:16] justification like that why the seals
[1:00:18] had not come open yet wesle they could
[1:00:21] only preach the sanctification of the
[1:00:22] natural realm I want to pre to you Lord
[1:00:25] will in this weekend of two stages of
[1:00:27] sanctification the Divine and the
[1:00:29] natural Wesley could not preach it that
[1:00:31] way the pentecostes could preach the
[1:00:33] gifts yes they did I was one of them I
[1:00:36] know so they could preach it I preached
[1:00:38] them years ago but I preach them
[1:00:39] different now I preach them with a line
[1:00:42] of an open book come on somebody and
[1:00:45] they but oh yeah I believed in gifts had
[1:00:47] gifts seen gifts manifested I've seen
[1:00:49] all the mess that went with it but I
[1:00:51] believe with all of my heart if we will
[1:00:53] operate it the way we we've been taught
[1:00:55] under the evening light there will not
[1:00:57] be division there will not be a bunch of
[1:01:00] nonsense it won't be hit and miss and
[1:01:02] hit and miss I believe if we do it the
[1:01:05] way the Holy Ghost wants it done it will
[1:01:07] be exactly right every time not one out
[1:01:11] of five not one out of a 100 but it will
[1:01:14] be right every
[1:01:17] time and the church
[1:01:19] [Applause]
[1:01:21] said I want you to notice now let's do a
[1:01:24] little PR
[1:01:25] well there was two great men that God
[1:01:30] used in a Reformation time for the Jews
[1:01:34] one of them was Ezra and the other was
[1:01:37] Nehemiah and the people had been without
[1:01:40] the
[1:01:41] word the the ministry the priesthood had
[1:01:44] started marrying idolatrous women the
[1:01:47] Levites didn't even do service no more
[1:01:50] they went out bought a field and was
[1:01:53] plowing and farming and this and that
[1:01:55] the house of God lay in
[1:01:58] Ruins and the word had become
[1:02:02] closed they wasn't even sure what God
[1:02:05] wanted anymore everything was such a
[1:02:08] gray
[1:02:09] area the reason it's gray is because you
[1:02:12] don't have the right
[1:02:15] light so when Ezra opened the book now
[1:02:18] remember it was the book of the law
[1:02:20] which contained Thou shalt and thou
[1:02:22] shalt not and all of that and but the
[1:02:24] time that Ezra come along the five books
[1:02:28] of Moses were a thousand years
[1:02:32] old a thousand years
[1:02:37] old read with me in Nehemiah chapter 8
[1:02:41] verse5 and Ezra opened the
[1:02:47] book in the sight of all the people for
[1:02:51] he was above all the people they had
[1:02:54] built him a
[1:02:55] Pulpit and when he opened
[1:02:59] it all the people stood up if we've got
[1:03:04] to visit us here tonight you may wonder
[1:03:06] why whenever we read the scripture
[1:03:08] around here that everybody stands well
[1:03:11] this is part of the reason why we figure
[1:03:14] we owe an allegiance to the open
[1:03:17] word now when the people stand up notice
[1:03:20] what this does now to
[1:03:22] Ezra and Ezra
[1:03:24] bless the Lord the great
[1:03:28] God and all the people sat there and
[1:03:31] nodded their
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:37] heads now notice so he says something
[1:03:41] and then the people said
[1:03:45] amen all the people answered amen y'all
[1:03:49] only said hi for what they said they
[1:03:52] said amen amen
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:57] amen with lifting up their
[1:04:00] hands and bow their
[1:04:03] heads
[1:04:04] wow now Lord notice what this book being
[1:04:08] opened is doing to these
[1:04:11] people it's bringing a response now they
[1:04:15] don't have the Holy Ghost of course no
[1:04:16] new births but the word of God that is
[1:04:19] there and the spirit or the anointing
[1:04:21] that's being released which is the
[1:04:23] restoration of the word restoration of
[1:04:25] worship restoration of thetical
[1:04:27] priesthood restoration of the temple the
[1:04:29] wall so on and so on and there's a
[1:04:31] spirit of Revival that's among
[1:04:36] them oh
[1:04:37] my and they bowed their heads and
[1:04:41] Worship the
[1:04:42] Lord with their faces to the
[1:04:47] ground when the book come
[1:04:51] open now go with me to the Book of
[1:04:55] Luke chapter
[1:04:57] 4 now we have the god of
[1:05:01] Israel on the
[1:05:04] earth and he came to Nazareth where he
[1:05:08] had been brought
[1:05:09] up and as his custom
[1:05:12] was he went into the
[1:05:15] synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:05:18] day wow what a strange custom Jesus had
[1:05:24] he went to
[1:05:26] church how weird is
[1:05:29] that if the Lord Jesus felt like he
[1:05:32] needed to go to
[1:05:37] church so you see Jesus didn't show up
[1:05:40] once over 14 years it was actually his
[1:05:45] custom to go to church
[1:05:51] regularly well praise the Lord he went
[1:05:54] into the synagogue on the Sabbath's day
[1:05:57] and stood up for it to
[1:05:59] read and there was delivered unto him
[1:06:02] the book of
[1:06:06] Isaias and when he had
[1:06:10] opened the
[1:06:12] book he found the
[1:06:17] place so the book is
[1:06:21] opened but that within itself is not
[1:06:25] enough he's looking for something in
[1:06:32] particular now he could have turned over
[1:06:34] and said in the beginning God created
[1:06:37] the heavens and the Earth and the Earth
[1:06:39] was without form and void and darkness
[1:06:42] covered the face of the deep and the
[1:06:44] spirit of God moved upon the waters and
[1:06:46] said let there be light and there was
[1:06:49] light and on and on and on and on it
[1:06:52] could have said that but actually the
[1:06:55] spirit that was on him directed him to
[1:06:59] the
[1:06:59] word of that
[1:07:02] day hallelujah
[1:07:05] hallelujah I love to preach the Bible
[1:07:07] stories but I'm going to tell you right
[1:07:09] now preaching about little David and his
[1:07:12] slang ain't going to put you in no
[1:07:14] Rapture preaching about Moses up on
[1:07:16] Mount Mariah or Abraham on Mount Mariah
[1:07:19] and Moses on Nebo and preaching the same
[1:07:21] Bible stories has been preached for the
[1:07:23] last thousands of years without the
[1:07:26] evening light now you run them Bible
[1:07:28] stories through the evening light and it
[1:07:30] will Enlighten you in a way that you
[1:07:32] ain't never seen David sang before but
[1:07:36] you see when you still try to preach the
[1:07:38] same Bible stories under the Baptist
[1:07:40] anointing or under the Pentecostal
[1:07:42] anointing come on somebody or under you
[1:07:45] know your own personal agenda it will
[1:07:48] never produce it but let the anointing
[1:07:50] of the end time preach about little
[1:07:53] David you get the seals out of him you
[1:07:55] get the thunders out of him you get the
[1:07:57] opening of the book out of him why takes
[1:08:00] the same Bible and actually makes it a
[1:08:03] new book so it makes David look
[1:08:06] different than the way I used to preach
[1:08:08] him I used to preach some of these same
[1:08:10] things back Y in Pentecost but it was
[1:08:12] under a different light under a
[1:08:15] different anointing but now I can preach
[1:08:18] it and whenever I do I say oh my Lord
[1:08:20] where in the world was all that laying
[1:08:22] it was laying there all the time but the
[1:08:25] book has now become open and helped me
[1:08:28] to see further than what I ever saw
[1:08:31] before but I don't want to just see
[1:08:32] David different I don't want to just see
[1:08:34] Solomon different I want to see me
[1:08:37] different I want to see you different I
[1:08:39] want brother skip for us to be able to
[1:08:41] see ourselves in that open book instead
[1:08:44] of looking so much at our humanity and
[1:08:46] getting so tied up on our old flesh and
[1:08:49] our old weaknesses and many you focus
[1:08:51] more on that than you do you n birth I
[1:08:54] told you years ago and it still stands
[1:08:56] true today one of the greatest
[1:08:58] challenges a bride's going to have in
[1:09:00] the last day is believe what you know
[1:09:02] about yourself or taking what God knows
[1:09:06] about you and the way God looks at you
[1:09:08] which one are you going to believe you
[1:09:11] going to be to believe the report of
[1:09:13] your flesh you going to believe the
[1:09:15] report of your weakness or are you going
[1:09:18] to believe the report of the word I'm an
[1:09:21] overcomer I am called in this
[1:09:24] Hallelujah I am Unstoppable I was
[1:09:27] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:09:29] world and I will be there by the grace
[1:09:32] of God in spite of
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:44] myself so he opens the book which a been
[1:09:48] a
[1:09:49] scroll and you imagine was just standing
[1:09:52] up there
[1:09:56] they're waiting and they're waiting and
[1:09:57] they're waiting what's he doing he's
[1:10:01] looking for
[1:10:08] himself and he found the
[1:10:11] place where it was
[1:10:14] written the
[1:10:16] spirit of the
[1:10:18] lord it's upon
[1:10:22] Moses the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:10:24] Joshua the spirit of God came on David
[1:10:28] the spirit was on John the
[1:10:30] Baptist he was looking for where it was
[1:10:33] written about
[1:10:35] himself the spirit of the Lord is
[1:10:41] upon can you say
[1:10:43] it
[1:10:45] sir the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:10:50] me because he hath anointed
[1:10:58] Ed now you see there's this element
[1:11:01] about us that we say oh my
[1:11:04] goodness ain't that
[1:11:07] bragging ain't that bragging about about
[1:11:10] us no you didn't do that you didn't put
[1:11:14] the spirit on you you didn't fill
[1:11:17] yourself with the Holy Ghost God did
[1:11:19] that you're not bragging on what you've
[1:11:21] done you're bragging on what he did you
[1:11:24] wasn't even worthy of the Holy Ghost I
[1:11:25] wasn't
[1:11:28] either the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:11:32] me because he has anointed
[1:11:35] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:11:39] has
[1:11:47] sent he hath sent me to heal the
[1:11:51] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:11:53] the captives the recovering of sight to
[1:11:56] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:11:58] are bruised and could have said me at
[1:12:01] every one of those stops there me me me
[1:12:05] me to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:12:08] Lord and He close the
[1:12:12] book and he gave it to the
[1:12:16] minister and set
[1:12:20] down and the eyes of all of them
[1:12:25] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[1:12:27] on
[1:12:30] him now he had his bar
[1:12:33] mitzvah whenever he turned 12 years old
[1:12:37] his first time to read the
[1:12:40] Torah so he had already done this as a
[1:12:42] wee
[1:12:43] boy but now this is the age of
[1:12:47] 33 the age at which a
[1:12:49] priest would stand and start ministering
[1:12:54] so as a little boy stood there and he
[1:12:56] would read the Torah and made comment
[1:13:00] maybe some of them said I remember
[1:13:03] him that's Jesus bar Joseph barment son
[1:13:08] Jesus the son of Jo they say he's
[1:13:11] illegitimate oh they say you know he's
[1:13:13] wory I know I know I know all that but I
[1:13:16] I remember as a we boy I just remember
[1:13:19] said Moses said Isaiah said Jeremiah
[1:13:23] said said yeah ain't that the same
[1:13:24] little boy that was over in the temple
[1:13:26] when his mama lost him and went over boy
[1:13:28] they said he is over preaching about
[1:13:30] Moses he's preaching about Jeremiah you
[1:13:33] know why he's preaching about them cuz
[1:13:36] he couldn't read this
[1:13:40] scripture he couldn't read this
[1:13:42] scripture right here when he was a boy
[1:13:43] of 12 years old and said this day this
[1:13:46] scripture is
[1:13:50] fullfilled so he had to preach about
[1:13:52] Moses and Jeremiah and
[1:14:00] Ezekiel so all the eyes of the people
[1:14:03] fastened on him as he going to preach
[1:14:06] about Moses he he going to preach about
[1:14:09] Daniel or about David is slang Little
[1:14:12] David play on your harp hallelujah
[1:14:15] hallelujah Little David play on your
[1:14:18] heart hallelujah boy if he goes to
[1:14:20] talking about David my goodness I'm
[1:14:22] going to shout I'm
[1:14:26] going but all of them sit and look at
[1:14:28] him real Earnest like y'all looking
[1:14:33] midut and he began to say unto
[1:14:36] them this
[1:14:39] day Lord
[1:14:41] God this
[1:14:45] scripture this day is this
[1:14:48] scripture
[1:14:50] fulfilled in your ears
[1:14:56] now he couldn't say this at 12 years
[1:15:00] old as a matter of fact he couldn't say
[1:15:02] it before he got
[1:15:05] baptized he couldn't say it when he was
[1:15:07] 18 couldn't say it when he was
[1:15:10] 20 but the father had to come in
[1:15:16] him we stood in that little community of
[1:15:19] Nazareth not long
[1:15:21] ago and they had built a little replica
[1:15:25] of a synagogue the little village where
[1:15:27] it was there and it just just awesome
[1:15:30] just incredible place no electrical
[1:15:33] wires you know no you know no no
[1:15:36] civilization just Stone paths and and
[1:15:38] little Gardens and Vats and Winery and
[1:15:41] and things like that look no doubt the
[1:15:43] way it would have looked very similar
[1:15:45] 2,000 years
[1:15:47] ago and then where they thought that
[1:15:49] that the little synagogue or the little
[1:15:51] place would have been and then not too
[1:15:53] far from where the synagogue was there
[1:15:55] was a precipice a place real
[1:15:58] high cuz remember when he said some of
[1:16:01] these words they took him to that place
[1:16:03] and they was going to shove him over
[1:16:06] amen yes they were because the devil
[1:16:08] can't stand it when you see yourself in
[1:16:12] the
[1:16:16] word praise
[1:16:20] God so now Jesus is able to identify
[1:16:25] himself from the open
[1:16:28] word but with it all the sweetness of
[1:16:33] standing there and the Revelation just
[1:16:36] permeating his
[1:16:37] being but the bitterness come a few
[1:16:41] minutes after
[1:16:42] this and they set their goal from that
[1:16:46] time on to kill
[1:16:48] him why he identified himself in the
[1:16:52] Bible
[1:16:54] why he he he's letting on like that was
[1:16:58] him it
[1:17:02] was the prophet of God tells us the same
[1:17:04] scripture that spoke about the groom
[1:17:07] prophesies about the bride
[1:17:11] too so then what
[1:17:13] about our title
[1:17:16] deed what what do we get what what does
[1:17:20] salvation do for us forgives us for our
[1:17:22] sins cleanses us you know makes us love
[1:17:25] people all that but I'm I'm talking
[1:17:27] about what what do I
[1:17:30] get what do do you
[1:17:35] get whenever my mom and daddy passed and
[1:17:37] Mama passed first and then Daddy and uh
[1:17:40] you've heard me tell it before that we
[1:17:42] thought my brother Jamie was the the
[1:17:45] executive of the will so we all gathered
[1:17:47] there at the little Double Wide Trailer
[1:17:49] where Mom and Daddy lived and Jamie gets
[1:17:52] their little box out about that big that
[1:17:54] has important documents in
[1:17:56] it and he he opens it up and he drags
[1:17:59] the wheel out and he reads it he says
[1:18:03] Donnie you're the
[1:18:07] executive I said
[1:18:10] what that's what it says you're the
[1:18:15] executive I'd heard that word
[1:18:18] before but I had no clue what I supposed
[1:18:20] to
[1:18:21] do so I started
[1:18:24] researching Now by that time of course I
[1:18:26] was living in Tennessee so I had to pull
[1:18:28] up the laws of
[1:18:30] Kentucky in order to understand I begin
[1:18:33] to read that and there was elements
[1:18:35] about it that frightened me because if I
[1:18:38] didn't do it exactly right I could get
[1:18:40] in
[1:18:41] trouble so I wanted to study and I
[1:18:44] wanted to search and I wanted to know
[1:18:47] what my responsibility was now if I wish
[1:18:51] to I could have took a portion
[1:18:53] out of what little bit Mom and Daddy had
[1:18:55] they never didn't have much in this life
[1:18:57] no way but what little bit they had I
[1:18:59] could have took an extra portion out of
[1:19:02] that because I was the
[1:19:05] executive but I personally didn't feel
[1:19:07] like that I should do
[1:19:09] that I get that from my big
[1:19:13] brother him being the firstborn he could
[1:19:16] have had a double portion that's right
[1:19:19] but instead he said I want to share
[1:19:21] everything that I get on equal terms
[1:19:25] with the rest of the
[1:19:26] family praise be to God so he wants to
[1:19:31] give us healing and deliverance he wants
[1:19:34] to give us a position in the body if he
[1:19:36] wants me to have it why shouldn't I take
[1:19:39] it I never had a one of my brothers and
[1:19:42] sisters to argue with me and say now
[1:19:44] Donnie it ain't right it ain't right oh
[1:19:46] there's a couple of them Harry you know
[1:19:47] mentioned about it you ought to take
[1:19:49] this or you ought to take that no I
[1:19:50] don't want to do that I I don't I don't
[1:19:51] want to do that you know I I I want you
[1:19:53] all to have that that part of it too
[1:19:56] let's just share it but I didn't know
[1:19:58] what to do so I had to study what do I
[1:20:00] do what do I do I had to go before the
[1:20:03] judge i' never been before the a judge
[1:20:05] in my life I sat there for hours
[1:20:07] listening to people get charged with
[1:20:09] this and that and the other there was a
[1:20:11] man that had broke his bail and his bond
[1:20:13] got right up before me that judge let
[1:20:16] him have it I'm telling you what he my
[1:20:19] he lowed the boom on that old boy and
[1:20:22] then then he said Mr Reagan and I walk
[1:20:25] up there and I'm shaking and he said so
[1:20:28] sorry to hear about the passing of your
[1:20:30] parents I'm sorry that we have to meet
[1:20:34] under these
[1:20:36] situations and I
[1:20:38] realized it depends on what terms you
[1:20:42] stand before the judge on Amen his tone
[1:20:46] of voice you see for those who stand
[1:20:49] before the Lord God at the white throne
[1:20:52] they will hear no
[1:20:54] mercy they will hear no voice of
[1:20:57] pity but when you and I stand before the
[1:21:00] Lord Jesus to get our reward we will not
[1:21:03] hear anger we will not hear a vengeful
[1:21:06] voice that ready to whip us and ready to
[1:21:08] send us to hell why it's the terms that
[1:21:11] we meet him on we're meeting him on the
[1:21:15] status that we are
[1:21:18] brothers so he won't look at us through
[1:21:21] Angry Eyes of wrath and judgment he
[1:21:24] won't even look at us through the pillar
[1:21:26] of fire that would be the wrath of God
[1:21:29] he will look at us through the love
[1:21:31] which pulsates from his own being and
[1:21:34] when he looks out he sees brothers and
[1:21:38] sisters that are part of the family of
[1:21:41] God oh my don't you want to meet him
[1:21:44] that wayen when I begin to read what I
[1:21:48] had to do and then I had to contact
[1:21:49] these people and I had to post something
[1:21:51] in the newspaper paper if there's any
[1:21:53] outstanding bills and I had to do this
[1:21:56] and I had to make a big gigantic
[1:21:57] checklist and check everything off to
[1:22:00] make sure had to contact the IRS and had
[1:22:02] to contact this and contact that oh my
[1:22:05] goodness I got so tired of doing it all
[1:22:07] why did I have to do all that I was
[1:22:09] still pastoring you at the time of
[1:22:11] course I've still got to do this and
[1:22:12] I've got to make this phone call I
[1:22:14] didn't live in Kentucky I lived here so
[1:22:16] it wasn't an easy thing for me to do but
[1:22:18] I got to thinking about my Lord he
[1:22:20] didn't live down here he lived in heaven
[1:22:23] but what did he do he said I'm willing
[1:22:25] to forsake heaven right now I'm willing
[1:22:27] to leave the praise of angels and go
[1:22:29] down to the cursings of man I'm willing
[1:22:31] to leave a a beautiful perfect place and
[1:22:34] I'm going to go down there they're going
[1:22:35] to hate me they're going to despise me
[1:22:38] but I'm going to stay there till I get
[1:22:39] the job done and he did he went to the
[1:22:42] Cross he paid the price and he bought
[1:22:44] the book and he ascended up in the
[1:22:46] resurrection raised for our
[1:22:48] justification and has been there for
[1:22:50] 2,000 years but still the book B was
[1:22:53] held in the hands of almighty God how
[1:22:55] many appreciates the cross tonight how
[1:22:57] many appreciates the blood how many
[1:22:59] appreciates the resurrection and yet the
[1:23:01] cross nor the blood nor the resurrection
[1:23:04] open the Seven Seals but Christ himself
[1:23:07] must slip back down at the end time at
[1:23:10] the revealing of the son of man he had
[1:23:13] to come back down Hallelujah and take
[1:23:16] that book in order to open up who you
[1:23:18] were the cross pointed to your way back
[1:23:21] across the ASM The Blood Washed you and
[1:23:24] cleansed you and made a way for the Holy
[1:23:27] Ghost to come in you but you still
[1:23:29] didn't know who you was as I said the
[1:23:31] other night Paul never preached the
[1:23:33] Seven Seals show me one place he ever
[1:23:35] mentioned the word show me one time Paul
[1:23:37] ever mentioned the word seven Thunder it
[1:23:40] was not needed for their age they were
[1:23:42] the alpha bride but I'll tell you who
[1:23:45] needed the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:23:47] the Omega bride lucer did not need it
[1:23:50] Wesley did not need it but who needed it
[1:23:53] it was the resurrection phase we are the
[1:23:57] resurrection phase the Rapture stage
[1:24:00] don't you see Paul is waiting on us
[1:24:03] Luther is waiting on us and the
[1:24:06] revelation of this end time will Rapture
[1:24:10] the entire church body Hallelujah for
[1:24:13] 2,000 years of church ages they are all
[1:24:17] waiting on us hang on Paul hang on Paul
[1:24:21] we're coming hold on Peter we're coming
[1:24:24] and we will cause the resurrection of
[1:24:27] the
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:37] Dead watch this in the breach now am I
[1:24:40] the forfeited title deed is now in the
[1:24:43] hands of the original
[1:24:45] owner almighty
[1:24:48] God the title deed to the
[1:24:51] Earth to eternal life when Adam forth it
[1:24:55] then Satan's dirty hands could not take
[1:24:58] it so it went back to its original
[1:25:02] owner God himself we're going to find in
[1:25:05] just a minute there he sits on the
[1:25:07] throne with it in his hand the title
[1:25:10] deed oh that makes me fear
[1:25:14] religious the title deed to eternal life
[1:25:20] Abstract title deed
[1:25:23] to eternal
[1:25:25] life you see for the brothers in this
[1:25:28] message who the seals have broke open to
[1:25:31] them they Don't Preach eternal life in a
[1:25:35] denominational
[1:25:38] perspective cuz a denominational
[1:25:41] perspective is God gives you something
[1:25:43] that was never
[1:25:49] yours and they preach adoption like this
[1:25:52] that you was like out of an orphanage
[1:25:54] somewhere and he come by and felt sorry
[1:25:57] for you and he adopted you into your
[1:25:59] family that ain't the way we preach
[1:26:02] adoption why we preach it through the
[1:26:04] opening of The Seven Seals so eternal
[1:26:07] life to us is not us getting something
[1:26:11] that we was not air
[1:26:13] to oh Hallelujah it was something that
[1:26:16] was already ours that's why the prophet
[1:26:18] could come and say and it chok some of
[1:26:20] the message people today you would saved
[1:26:22] on no certain day you always was saved
[1:26:26] it was yours oh Hallelujah before there
[1:26:29] was ever a World before there's ever a
[1:26:31] star or a speck of dust out there in the
[1:26:34] cosmic life it was you when you was
[1:26:36] identified with that and he goes on to
[1:26:38] say in streetport there's only one form
[1:26:40] of eternal life and that was you you
[1:26:43] don't remember it but you were there I
[1:26:46] can't preach eternal life the way I did
[1:26:49] that in Pentecost because back under I
[1:26:51] preached at the that you could have it
[1:26:53] but you could lose it and you could get
[1:26:55] it and then you could lose it I don't
[1:26:56] know how many times people in Pentecost
[1:26:58] got the Holy Ghost over and over and
[1:27:01] over and over again every Revival I'd go
[1:27:04] preach in some places that get the same
[1:27:06] Holy Ghost again and again I don't
[1:27:08] preach it that way no more children I
[1:27:10] preach once you get it in your soul your
[1:27:13] soul is sealed to the day of your
[1:27:15] Redemption and there ain't no turning
[1:27:18] back because that desire has done been
[1:27:21] annihilated in out of you I preach the
[1:27:24] Holy Ghost but I preach it through the
[1:27:25] opening of the word of
[1:27:31] God the title deed to eternal life
[1:27:36] Abstract title deed to eternal life and
[1:27:39] Adam forfeited for wisdom instead of
[1:27:41] faith it went back into the hands of the
[1:27:43] owner almighty God what a great thing
[1:27:46] all right waiting what's it doing in the
[1:27:48] hands of God
[1:27:50] waiting for for
[1:27:53] Redemption
[1:27:58] claims now keep in your mind this was
[1:28:00] not
[1:28:01] consummated at the
[1:28:05] cross the book was still in his hands
[1:28:08] look at this sermon here the title of it
[1:28:10] the breach now remember he opens this
[1:28:12] series with God in
[1:28:14] Simplicity and then the
[1:28:16] breach now watch this is the scene
[1:28:20] people might have thought he was just
[1:28:21] laying out of drama do you understand
[1:28:24] all of time had merged together it is
[1:28:28] now standing at this very point in time
[1:28:31] of the scripture of Revelation
[1:28:34] 5 It's Not Just An Occurrence well it
[1:28:37] was a good type it was not a type the
[1:28:41] lamb had the book in his
[1:28:43] hands in March of
[1:28:49] 63 he couldn't give it to Luci
[1:28:52] he was a
[1:28:54] reformer not a
[1:28:56] prophet he couldn't give it to Wesley he
[1:28:59] couldn't give it to that black man that
[1:29:02] received the understanding about the
[1:29:03] restoration of gifts on isusa street he
[1:29:06] had to give it to
[1:29:09] Elijah and there was the
[1:29:14] lamb what's it waiting for so the book
[1:29:17] had been there for these 2,000 years
[1:29:19] after the work of the Cross 2,000 years
[1:29:22] years after the resurrection it's it's
[1:29:24] waiting waiting for what redemption's
[1:29:30] claim redemption's claim so who who can
[1:29:33] get
[1:29:35] it only the
[1:29:37] Redeemer John couldn't go take that book
[1:29:40] till after the lamb took it you
[1:29:43] understand brother R could not take that
[1:29:46] book The Lamb took it first and gave him
[1:29:49] the open revelation of what was in the
[1:29:51] the
[1:29:52] contents the lamb took it and then come
[1:29:54] and told John take it so what the
[1:29:56] prophet had to do the prophet had to
[1:29:58] come and take it in order to Feast on
[1:30:00] that setting the presence of God and
[1:30:01] each Angel come each day making known to
[1:30:04] him the Revelation which was made only
[1:30:06] to known to
[1:30:09] thems and then he comes and preaches
[1:30:12] from that open book and what he finds
[1:30:14] out what he preaches himself and you
[1:30:16] watch him he goes back and he preaches
[1:30:17] Joseph he's going back and preaches a
[1:30:19] bunch of them things that he' already
[1:30:21] preached before for but now he's
[1:30:23] preaching with a different slant what
[1:30:25] was the slant the book had come
[1:30:29] open and he could see things about him
[1:30:31] he had never seen before oh praise God
[1:30:34] waiting for Redemption claim he made a
[1:30:36] way of redemption he made a way back and
[1:30:39] someday the Redeemer is to take it back
[1:30:43] waiting for Redemption claims what is
[1:30:45] the book of redemption this titled deed
[1:30:48] abstract deed you say abstract what does
[1:30:51] an abstract D mean what is it what's the
[1:30:54] meaning of it it means it
[1:30:57] searched all the way back to the
[1:31:00] beginning sir it's Redemption means all
[1:31:05] legal
[1:31:07] possession to all that was lost by Adam
[1:31:10] and Eve oh my what that ought to do to a
[1:31:13] born- again Christian it's legal
[1:31:16] possession to the abstract deed titled
[1:31:20] deed of eternal life
[1:31:22] means that
[1:31:25] you possess
[1:31:30] everything that Adam and Eve lost then
[1:31:35] he
[1:31:37] says what of it
[1:31:41] Brethren now I ask you do you figure
[1:31:45] from the way most of us reacted to that
[1:31:47] statement tonight that I just read most
[1:31:50] of us need a revelation of
[1:31:58] it so when that
[1:32:02] abstract is made clear to your
[1:32:05] life it's legal possession of the
[1:32:07] abstract title D of eternal life means
[1:32:10] that you notice he ain't pointing to
[1:32:12] himself now now don't misunderstand me
[1:32:15] he's not even pointing to the possession
[1:32:18] of the Lord
[1:32:20] Jesus
[1:32:22] the opening of the seals in this day is
[1:32:24] not just about what Jesus
[1:32:28] got it's what you
[1:32:34] get notice in the Easter seal when the
[1:32:38] spirit of God comes upon
[1:32:40] you and you
[1:32:42] truly are one of God's attributes that
[1:32:45] he spoke of now if you're not you'll
[1:32:47] wonder and flustra and run here and
[1:32:48] there and everything else and never come
[1:32:50] to the knowledge of the truth but if
[1:32:52] you're one of those the old things are
[1:32:53] passed away right quick see and you
[1:32:56] become new and the Plan of Salvation is
[1:32:59] finished you're ready to obey every word
[1:33:00] that God ever
[1:33:04] spoke of you of you God ever spoke of
[1:33:10] you what brother brandham fulfilled is

[1:33:16] is I can't be what brother Tim is I I
[1:33:18] can't be what brother Wayne Lawson is
[1:33:20] brother Daryl I want to find the words
[1:33:22] that speak about
[1:33:23] me don't you I want to find Lord what
[1:33:26] what what does the word say about me I
[1:33:28] want to find the place in the scripture

[1:33:39] sheep this
[1:33:40] day this
[1:33:42] scripture is fulfilled before your
[1:33:50] eyes

[1:33:56] spoke of you see for you to do you're
[1:34:00] submissive to his word the contract

[1:34:10] you the
[1:34:12] debts are all
[1:34:15] paid it's all struck off as it was on
[1:34:19] the day of Pentecost like the pent
[1:34:21] costal experience today and the coming
[1:34:24] of the Holy Ghost in the last days is
[1:34:26] Promised it's like the
[1:34:28] abstract to a title
[1:34:31] deed now you can get a title or you can
[1:34:34] get a title to a place but you still
[1:34:37] don't say it's yours now some of these

[1:37:28] checked out the abstract they've done a
[1:37:30] title search which I was okay with
[1:37:34] anyway cuz I didn't want to tie a bunch
[1:37:36] of money up in it and somebody else come

[1:38:13] in the closet I ain't coming out of the
[1:38:15] closet I ain't got nothing in the closet
[1:38:17] I'm ashamed of come on somebody because
[1:38:19] I've done got the abstract to my title
[1:38:21] de I can look the devil right Square in
[1:38:24] the eye and say show me where I'm a
[1:38:26] sinner convince me of my sin you
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:36] devil when you get an abstract it shows
[1:38:39] that everything that's ever against
[1:38:43] you is struck
[1:38:45] off Plum back from the
[1:38:48] foundation and when a man has said he
[1:38:50] believed the
[1:38:52] word then when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:38:55] it's the
[1:38:57] abstract to the title don't you see what
[1:39:00] a lot of message people have done
[1:39:02] they've taken the message books and
[1:39:04] tapes and message churches and doctrines
[1:39:06] and so
[1:39:07] on and they've made that their
[1:39:11] title and they try to overcome just from
[1:39:14] the title only and they've got all the
[1:39:16] terms and all the cliches and they're
[1:39:18] quoting the title the title the title
[1:39:20] the title
[1:39:23] but if you've not received that Holy
[1:39:25] Ghost yourself in your soul to seal that
[1:39:31] title oh when the Holy Spirit comes it
[1:39:34] is the abstract to the title that gives
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:40] permission when you have that abstracted
[1:39:43] every bit of that belongs to
[1:39:45] you and everything is on it belongs to
[1:39:48] you that gives you the ab ract when the
[1:39:51] Holy Ghost comes upon this tital
[1:39:55] deed that God saw back Yonder before the
[1:39:59] foundation of the
[1:40:02] world praise be to God so when you heard
[1:40:06] from your
[1:40:07] theophany there was an Awakening of the
[1:40:10] Jean seed on the inside a quickening of
[1:40:13] that tidal portion which God put in you
[1:40:17] which is part of your identification
[1:40:18] before the foundation of the world so
[1:40:20] God saw that then he send the Holy Ghost
[1:40:22] being the abstract down upon that little
[1:40:25] deposit oh Lord have mercy Hallelujah
[1:40:29] that's why the devil can't talk real
[1:40:30] bride out of this message the only
[1:40:32] people that a lot of these people have
[1:40:34] been able to talk out of these message
[1:40:35] are intellectual Believers oh I'm glad
[1:40:38] I'm out of the cult I'm glad I left this
[1:40:41] I'm glad I left that I'm glad you left
[1:40:43] two you old unbeliever yeah get out of
[1:40:46] our way we're going on with God if
[1:40:49] somebody can put you in it some somebody
[1:40:51] can take you out if somebody can talk
[1:40:54] you into it somebody can talk you out
[1:40:56] but if God baptizes you into this
[1:40:59] Hallelujah and God gives you the
[1:41:01] abstract to the title de there ain't
[1:41:04] enough devils in Hell there ain't enough
[1:41:07] YouTube videos there ain't enough people
[1:41:09] saying well I'm free no you ain't you're
[1:41:12] bound by that devil there ain't enough
[1:41:15] nothing to get you out of his mind and
[1:41:17] his
[1:41:19] thoughts
[1:41:31] that gives us the abstract when the Holy
[1:41:33] Ghost comes upon this title deed that
[1:41:36] God saw back Yonder before the
[1:41:38] foundation of the world and put its name
[1:41:42] on The Book of
[1:41:44] Life but was born through a man and
[1:41:47] woman and subject to sin and guilty of
[1:41:50] sin but when I believed on it I received
[1:41:54] the
[1:41:57] deed but when the Holy Ghost
[1:42:00] come it was the abstract that everything
[1:42:05] against me whether my mother done it my
[1:42:09] father done it my grandmother done it

[1:42:18] race is what our culture is we come to
[1:42:20] to God with a lot of garbage and a lot
[1:42:23] of baggage and it wasn't just what you

[1:42:27] daddy done what your uncle done what you
[1:42:28] ain't done what your grandpa done but

[1:42:44] ever get you back under then there is no
[1:42:47] more identity that you was ever lost God
[1:42:50] don't ever remember you being lost the
[1:42:52] only thing he remembers about you is you

[1:54:22] turning so
[1:54:24] fast Lord as I read the other day the
[1:54:27] words that Putin
[1:54:29] said Britain talking about sending maybe
[1:54:31] some soldiers to Ukraine some of the
[1:54:33] other European nations considering it's
[1:54:36] offending F-16 Fighters and so on Putin
[1:54:41] got before his cabinets and warned the
[1:54:45] west and told
[1:54:47] them if they did the world could come to
[1:54:51] an
[1:54:53] end because he would send nuclear
[1:54:59] bombs as I read that I just laughed I
[1:55:02] thought you level you you ain't got
[1:55:05] enough power to bring this world to an
[1:55:10] end but we can see it all Gathering we
[1:55:13] can see Israel lord they're the ones
[1:55:15] that's been attacked and yet the media
[1:55:18] attacks them every day yeah the UN
[1:55:21] attacks them
[1:55:24] constantly it's easy to see how they
[1:55:27] parallel between the bride it seemed
[1:55:30] like no matter what the bride does she's
[1:55:33] always criticized run down
[1:55:36] hated preachers around this message that
[1:55:39] don't really even preach it they can get
[1:55:40] by with about anything and people will
[1:55:43] make excuse for him it beats all I've
[1:55:45] ever seen and a true man of God I don't
[1:55:49] care how he lives how he walks and what
[1:55:51] he does everybody in their brother hates
[1:55:55] him but that's the way it's supposed to
[1:55:58] be oh Lord God we're not asking to make
[1:56:01] it easy on us we're asking you make us
[1:56:07] strong make me strong
[1:56:10] God make me
[1:56:13] gallent help me father that I can act

[1:56:27] lion and I'll fight with everything
[1:56:31] within
[1:56:32] me oh Jesus help us as the people of
[1:56:36] God may we find that place which was
[1:56:40] written of
[1:56:44] us

[1:56:48] hallelujah
[1:56:50] as you Lord God spoke to me last year I
[1:56:53] was going through a terrible
[1:56:56] thing not knowing which way to go not
[1:56:58] knowing what to do
[1:57:01] exactly but I remember your words Lord
[1:57:04] God you hold your
[1:57:07] peace and I will fight for

[1:57:18] you are know andest to do it other times
[1:57:21] we're to hold our peace and let you
[1:57:25] fight so it takes the spirit of God to
[1:57:29] lead us when it's our time to
[1:57:32] Roar and when it's our time to hold our
[1:57:34] peace you rebuke the Pharisees you call
[1:57:38] them names you preached you hollered
[1:57:40] whenever you were here but when you
[1:57:43] stood before Pilate you didn't open your
[1:57:46] mouth so there's a time to scream forth
[1:57:49] and there there's a
[1:57:50] time to hold our peace and
[1:57:54] forgive teach us Lord to be led by your
[1:57:59] spirit may we find the place that is
[1:58:03] written of us oh
[1:58:06] God I wonder how many with me in this
[1:58:10] building those of you that are
[1:58:13] streaming you just raise your hand to
[1:58:15] the
[1:58:16] Lord Lord I want I want to find my
[1:58:21] place I don't want to just find it in
[1:58:23] Word of Life Church I want to find it in
[1:58:25] the
[1:58:26] word I want to find it in Christ if I
[1:58:29] haven't arrived yet let me find
[1:58:33] it let me find it
[1:58:36] Lord praise
[1:58:38] God would you just raise your hands to
[1:58:40] God both of mine are
[1:58:42] up I believe I'm in my
[1:58:45] position but who knows God may change
[1:58:48] the strategy of my my life in a week or
[1:58:50] two or three I might have to go in a
[1:58:53] different direction you never know you
[1:58:54] never know what God has on his mind but
[1:58:57] I just want to be sensitive to following
[1:59:01] I don't want to be tricked
[1:59:02] either as a leader it's one of the most
[1:59:05] dangerous things in your life when you
[1:59:08] go to making a profound
[1:59:11] decision Satan can impress upon you and
[1:59:14] convince you that it's
[1:59:17] God as a leader it can be so treacherous
[1:59:21] you have to wait make sure wait make
[1:59:25] sure check it by the word look back and
[1:59:29] forth back and
[1:59:31] forth you husbands you need to realize
[1:59:33] that as well when you make decisions
[1:59:35] pertaining to your home your family God
[1:59:38] will hold you responsible
[1:59:40] Brothers we need him like never
[1:59:44] before Oh
[1:59:47] Hallelujah can we pray right
[1:59:51] now oh lamb who opened the
[1:59:55] book and tore off the Seven
[1:59:59] Seals and when the first seal was
[2:00:03] broke there went forth a
[2:00:06] symbol a white horse with a
[2:00:09] rider a
[2:00:11] bow with no
[2:00:13] airs
[2:00:16] symbols it laid there for 2,000 years
[2:00:19] years people guessed at it pondered
[2:00:23] wondered but when the seal was
[2:00:26] opened Revelation formed to your Prophet
[2:00:29] down on the
[2:00:30] earth so here appears this
[2:00:33] Angel and he comes down on the seventh
[2:00:36] angel is on the earth at the time of
[2:00:39] that coming Lord God May Word of Life
[2:00:43] realize Revelation
[2:00:46] 101 has already happened
[2:00:49] it was a secret Advent of our
[2:00:53] lover coming to the Earth to bring the
[2:00:57] tital deed to loose us from all those
[2:01:00] old
[2:01:02] marriages because this is the age of the
[2:01:06] Rapture praise
[2:01:09] God you had to sneak
[2:01:12] down the world didn't know
[2:01:15] it as it was in the days of Sodom thus
[2:01:19] will it be in the days when the son of
[2:01:21] man will be
[2:01:23] revealed then in verse 32 in that 17th
[2:01:27] chapter of Luke when you were speaking
[2:01:29] there then after talking about the son
[2:01:31] of man then you said these profound
[2:01:34] words
[2:01:36] remember Lot's
[2:01:40] wife so after the revealing of the son
[2:01:43] of man we are to remember Lot's wife
[2:01:51] for it was after the son of man Elohim
[2:01:53] came down to
[2:01:56] Abraham an angel come and brought a
[2:02:00] message they turned of course and walked
[2:02:03] away from that
[2:02:04] truth compromise went into
[2:02:08] Sodom you never did tell us to remember
[2:02:11] Sarah or to remember Rebecca or to
[2:02:14] remember Rachel or to remember some of
[2:02:17] the Old Testament prophetes
[2:02:20] but you told us to
[2:02:22] remember Lot's
[2:02:25] wife so truly we are living in the day
[2:02:28] when Lot's wife is turning away from the
[2:02:32] light of the
[2:02:35] day and she will also get a body
[2:02:39] change cuz once they walk away from this
[2:02:42] word they start piercing their ears
[2:02:45] their nose dressing different dressing
[2:02:50] ungodly some of them turning into
[2:02:53] homosexuals once they walk away from
[2:02:55] this
[2:02:57] word they're getting their body
[2:03:02] Chang oh Lord God we don't want to be
[2:03:05] turned to
[2:03:07] Salt we want to be turned into eternal
[2:03:11] life we don't want to be turned into
[2:03:14] salt
[2:03:17] Lord I want to be turned back to a young
[2:03:20] man not
[2:03:23] salt so if we walk away from this end
[2:03:26] time message of Malachi
[2:03:28] 4 we will also be
[2:03:30] changed oh yeah we've seen them as
[2:03:33] they've walked away from it preachers
[2:03:35] and all we've seen what they
[2:03:38] become former preachers I seen a picture
[2:03:40] a couple years ago former preacher the
[2:03:42] message sent with a beer in his
[2:03:44] hand former message preacher but now
[2:03:47] free yeah getting their body
[2:03:51] changed and their mind turned over to
[2:03:56] reprobates oh Jesus won't you pass by
[2:03:59] this way tonight
[2:04:01] Lord we thank you for every book every
[2:04:04] tape that you've given us to the
[2:04:06] prophet's message but Lord God we also
[2:04:08] recognize we must have the Holy Ghost in
[2:04:10] our
[2:04:12] souls the books and tapes alone won't do
[2:04:15] it even the prophet told us oh brother
[2:04:17] random I believe every word you said he
[2:04:18] said that's just being
[2:04:20] able to
[2:04:23] read just being able to
[2:04:26] read but take the book of our Liv Lord
[2:04:30] tear the seals
[2:04:33] off reveal what needs to be
[2:04:36] revealed take us back to the
[2:04:39] foundation and clear
[2:04:42] it praise God that we can stand and say
[2:04:47] I want
[2:04:50] was
[2:04:52] lost
[2:04:54] but
[2:04:57] now I'm
[2:05:01] found was
[2:05:05] blind but
[2:05:12] now pick the right
[2:05:15] key where were there the sins we were
[2:05:20] wretched few years ago some of you
[2:05:22] ladies would look in your closet you
[2:05:24] would pick out which minis skirt you was
[2:05:25] going to wear or your favorite pair of
[2:05:29] pants some of you Brothers you couldn't
[2:05:33] hardly wait for warm weather to comeing
[2:05:35] so you could pick out your favorite
[2:05:37] shorts and show them ugly legs of
[2:05:41] yours now you can't hardly wait for
[2:05:43] spring to come so you can change your
[2:05:47] long pants your sisters don't look for
[2:05:50] manyi dresses no
[2:05:52] more you don't look to go to your
[2:05:54] favorite hairdresser so she can cut your
[2:05:56] hair
[2:05:58] off you don't stop by the liquor store
[2:06:00] to have a little fright in that
[2:06:04] drink why he took your book and tore the
[2:06:09] seals off remember when the mysteries of
[2:06:11] the seals were it was revealed it didn't
[2:06:13] just reveal the lamb it also revealed
[2:06:16] the
[2:06:17] Antichrist that's what that's what
[2:06:19] people don't want to see about their own
[2:06:20] life they want to see that Darkness
[2:06:22] about their own life and the short pits
[2:06:24] shortcomings and pitfalls of their own
[2:06:27] life but when the seals come open it
[2:06:29] also reveal that but we're not here
[2:06:32] tonight to focus on all that part let's
[2:06:34] just get it took care of get it under
[2:06:37] with the
[2:06:38] blood and lamb take take your book and
[2:06:42] so saturate your soul with the Holy
[2:06:44] Ghost then you'll be able to find in the
[2:06:47] book as well and you'll take the book
[2:06:49] and what you'll find is when you go to
[2:06:51] reading the word that you won't just
[2:06:52] read about brother brenman there read
[2:06:53] about your mama your daddy your pastor
[2:06:55] brother Daryl the people that you admire
[2:06:57] and all that sort of thing but you'll be
[2:06:59] able to find something in there about
[2:07:03] you about you this is me so you find
[2:07:07] yourself looking in the
[2:07:08] mirror

[2:07:12] me don't you love
[2:07:15] him let's sing together now
[2:07:19] so when we get there that day what you
[2:07:21] reckon we'll be praising the Lord for
[2:07:24] how faithful we were how loyal we were
[2:07:26] to the cause of God how much we prayed
[2:07:28] and bore our testimony
[2:07:31] of it'll be his
[2:07:34] grace his
[2:07:37] Mercy you said Brother Don just and I
[2:07:39] got saved let me tell you something I
[2:07:41] hope you're realizing you need Grace for
[2:07:44] what you've heard tonight you need the
[2:07:47] grace of God to help you you comprehend
[2:07:49] what you've heard and help you to be
[2:07:51] able to take that book physically any of
[2:07:54] us might be able to do it but by
[2:07:56] Revelation will'll never do it if God
[2:07:59] Don't Make It Real to us but I don't
[2:08:02] believe he would preach anything to us
[2:08:05] that's not attainable for
[2:08:07] us you believe the same somebody's going
[2:08:10] to do it I figure it might as well be me
[2:08:13] sister Vicki it might as well be you
[2:08:15] brother Smith it might as well be you
[2:08:16] you young Brothers what about it it
[2:08:18] could be you your sisters where you can
[2:08:21] find the place in the word and one day
[2:08:23] you'll be able to point your finger on
[2:08:25] that scripture in John in that day you
[2:08:28] will know it's I and you and you and me
[2:08:31] and the father and you and I are
[2:08:36] one and you'll be able to put your
[2:08:38] finger on that scripture and say this
[2:08:40] day this scripture is fullfilled I and
[2:08:44] my father are
[2:08:47] one

[2:22:15] when I first come to the Earth Lord as a
[2:22:17] baby I didn't know myself I didn't know
[2:22:19] Mama didn't know Daddy didn't know
[2:22:22] nobody and therefore however long it was
[2:22:25] it was just me the first born and Mom
[2:22:27] and
[2:22:28] Daddy and then some time after that
[2:22:31] Tammy was born and then Harry was born
[2:22:35] and with each son or daughter that was
[2:22:38] born then I be to recognize them so I
[2:22:42] didn't have to be jealous of them they
[2:22:44] were part of me I was part of them
[2:22:47] so recognizing our siblings in the
[2:22:50] family of God is part of God that's part
[2:22:54] of God in us so we don't just focus on
[2:22:57] our position alone and our church alone
