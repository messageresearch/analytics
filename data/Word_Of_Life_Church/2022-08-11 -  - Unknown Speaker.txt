TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it may seem strange to people outside of our ranks but we know that our companion that was given to us by God it's actually not just our choice now it is our choice but when you look at it in reality the church that you go to is not really your choice the pastor that you set under it should not be your choice I mean I I hear it all the time that there's people actually come to Happy Valley and I wasn't their choice of a pastor now it always makes me feel so wonderful I mean they're just being honest they would rather went here and there and there and and they're they're trying to make a point whenever they will tell me that I'm so glad that they always tell me the point afterwards because I'd probably just walk away very discouraged but but the point was that brother Donnie my first choice would have been to go here or there or there but I just kept feeling the Lord was leading me here and now I see why because under your ministry we've changed and we've done this and that and the other so it it might be the same way with a mate so the very one that God might have for you initially you might look at them and they might look at you and they might not like you at all and they think what in the world is a matter of that girl what in the world is the matter with that boy sort of like Carol did me when we initially met I knew she'd come around bless her heart she was just a little bit slower than me but she finally called up but God when God gives us that something it is truly a revelation now I'm sure that all of you young people sitting here tonight have had Revelations from God in your life have you not whether the serpent seed God sending a prophet whatever doctrinal saying and you may have heard it since she was a little boy or a girl but one day reading and reading the Bible listen to a tape setting in a service maybe at a used camp or a banquet all of a sudden that doctrine that you had heard all of your life and yet a preacher just went a little different angle than the way you'd ever heard it before and it's just like a light bulb switched on and you say oh my goodness I see it oh I'll see it and now they're saying you see what serpent say serpent said you've heard that since she was in Sunday school but all of a sudden it becomes so real to you what was that a revelation from God and a real mate that God puts together that's what they really are but brother Donnie what about the brown eyes and the blue eyes and the broad shoulders and the tall dark and handsome he might be short fat and squatty hey Sister Sarah are you saying amen I noticed it was just one-sided there but there's something about it when God puts you together that time can never separate sickness heartache can never separate I love the way that brother random deals with this in Kinsmen Redeemer When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why now how odd is that now that would be the very opposite of the way most people would describe what we call Falling in Love y'all familiar with the term right I mean truth of goodness that ain't outdated falling in love so some people say it's love at first sight and truly for some it might be that way but for most people it's probably the term that I just used falling in love so you're around that person and you get to liken them more and more and you become more compatible and you all these things are going together so what's happening you're falling in love with that individual but if you can write down all the answers of why you love that person I would advise you not to marry them brother darling you didn't catch the quote he said when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why oh she's pretty she's you know her hair is certain certain color her eyes you know he's this tall dark handsome or short whichever I know and whenever they you know well and then that that well every one of those things you listed might change so as the electrician was up on the roof of a certain Baptist Church and he's repairing an electrical War and he gets into that wire and his body grounds The Wire and his face a married man with children nearly all of his face caught on fire and burn off so if his wife married him because he was handsome and she goes to the hospital his flesh is melted he has no eyes no nose true story no lips they do surgery after surgery after surgery as a matter of fact this man is the first one in the United States to get a full face transplant so if she married him because of looks she would have a right to divorce him and marry another but what if she married him because she loved him and she couldn't really Define oh yeah his looks with certain certain so-ands always eyes his hair this and that and the other you can ask a lot of the men in our church that hair might go in time oh and if it don't turn loose it will turn gray so it's going to turn one way or the other so when a person notice how he says this a man finds a woman he loves her and he don't know why he loves her and she finds the man that she loves or sisters this is a tough quote to swallow no matter what he looks like brother rob you should have said hey man right there buddy he loves her she loves him listen what this is that's an eternal mate in glory deaths nor nothing else can ever separate him because they are from eternity and stepped out into a space of time and will return back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time and it goes right back up into eternity again it can not perish so how do you know when someone is right the right one that God has for you you pray you look at it now there's nothing wrong with looking at the differences that you have and you've heard me say it before that whenever I'm counseling a couple that's going to be engaged to get married and most of them will come to me before they get engaged and we're praying about it and I will ask them do you love each other yes yes have you prayed about it yes if you talk to her father yes we've got his Blessing and then I'll say do you like each other yeah that's what they always do they always life what are your life when I say that now the reason I asked that is because after counseling 40 plus years of married people what I find is many times things that get on one another is things they don't like about one another it's not that they don't love anyone each other anymore but it's just the habitual day-to-day activity say some of you guys don't pick up your clothes very well now I'm not saying I'm just saying you know I'm just I'm not saying that there's anybody guilty here and you you've got you oh all right we've got a brother here under conviction lay your hand on your mercius and so he doesn't pick up his shoes very well and each of us have our makeup the girl was raised in her Norm the boy was raised in his norm and when you come together what are you going to do you're going to have trade-offs and you're going to find a new norm and create a new one but the difficult part is being able to merge together but if you've got real Love by which you can base it on your love will be stronger than your dislikes for this and other now my wife Carol she is a neat neat person I mean she loves Nate super neat no more neat the better it is well I'm the type of guy if I'm working on something I've got this drawer open that door open this door open it don't make no sense to me to get screw out and put it back together get it open it or get another screw out do that that don't make no sense so I've got cabinets down in my basement and I like to build Woodworking and taxidermy work and different things that I do down there so I've got cabinets to stand about this tall double doors you open them up well I've got wood here I've got you know feathers over here I've got snake skins here I've got this this so if I'm doing a Taxidermy something for some of some of the brothers I may have eight or ten of these cabinets open at one time that is until Carol comes downstairs now Carol's only going to be there 10 or 15 minutes but as Carol comes by each double door them double doors don't close automatically but Carol automatically closes them for me so she'll come through and close every one of them and when she leaves now I have to exert more energy to open every one of them back up let's see you're laughing but you'd be surprised how many people that I have counseled that have had things just this simple and causes the office problem ever was oh I dealt was an issue several years ago a man and wife it was nearly it was nearly a divorce case they called me it was screaming it was hollering it was awful and it was simply because she wanted breakfast for supper but he wanted supper for supper you think that's funny did you I'll call you the next time they call me did they love each other of course of course would they wish harm on either one no but it was just the likes and the dislikes real love can look at the flaws of that man that you want to marry and they don't have to say no they don't exist no I close my eyes to any of her faults you better look at them buddy that's going to be what's going to aggravate you but if you love her more than her faults and you love him more than his faults and his shortcomings ah sounds like to me you all stepped out of eternity together to live here in a body call time so don't be afraid to look at shortcomings and don't be afraid to be able to acknowledge well this is fine knowing you that that's okay I have no problem with that because our love will help us to deal with it that's the way Real Love Is that's the way he loves us he looked at us and knew we would cause him so much pain even after we got saved but he loved us so much he said I'm willing I'm willing to embrace you with all your shortcomings aren't you glad boy I'll tell you one day if Jesus didn't love me like that there'd be no hope for me how do you know when someone is right the right one God has for you again proach it prayerfully open-hearted open mind be able to look and see are you compatible and don't just look at him but whenever I'm counseling sisters I will tell them that young man that you're looking at see how he treats his mama see how he treats his sisters if he has them that'll give you a pretty good idea of how he's going to treat you because if he has inferiority complexes toward women if he's raised by a strong woman in the house he may take that out on you once you're married I might not go into this office here and finish this and it's the same way young men whenever you are looking to marry a girl look and see how she treats her daddy look and see how she treats her brothers her uncles look and see how she treats the pastor or other men of authority in her life because don't think she's going to despise the pastor and her father and every other male figure in her life and all of a sudden oh she's just going to melt in your arms and everything is going to be wonderful you're dreaming boy I should say you've got a nightmare why because there's something in her that has molded her that way real love can look at that now see some of y'all thinking I'll never be married I'd rather for you to delay it and find the right one I don't want to talk to you all in there right so when it's real love it can look at the flaws the shortcomings the mistakes and there's something in you that drives you toward that individual because it'll be God that pulls you together clear okay
