[10:22] Amen. If you don't mind, just remain
[10:24] standing while we look at our prayer
[10:25] request this morning. Uh, Brother Jim
[10:27] Hughes sends this in. My mother's been
[10:29] going through treatments for bladder
[10:30] cancer over the last year and a half
[10:32] after finishing series of treatments in
[10:34] the spring. She went back for routine
[10:37] tests in July. The doctors advised her
[10:39] she needed to do a biopsy, but the
[10:42] treatment was not successful and the
[10:44] cancer was still there, plus a new spot.
[10:47] On the 27th of August, Brother Daryl
[10:49] preached with a prayer cloth on him.
[10:52] Hallelujah.
[10:55] My mom received the cloth that night and
[10:58] hasn't been without it since. She had
[11:01] the biopsy on both spots the next day.
[11:05] This past week, she received a call
[11:08] from the doctor's office telling her no
[11:13] cancer.
[11:19] Is that good?
[11:21] Hallelujah.
[11:23] Oh, we all just want to give God all the
[11:25] glory. Praise the Lord. Brother Jim, God
[11:27] bless you for that testimony this
[11:29] morning. God is so faithful.

[11:34] aware of it. He's moving when you're not
[11:36] even aware of it. You got to You got

[12:02] how well she is doing. Somebody say,
[12:04] "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Sherry,
[12:08] you go ahead and give the Lord a good
[12:09] hand on that, too. Amen.

[12:16] Barbara is in the intensive care unit, a
[12:18] fractured L1, high heart rate, cannot
[12:21] get her pain under control. So, we want
[12:23] to remember that prayer request. Sister
[12:26] Maryanthony says, "Please pray for
[12:28] Sister Brandy suffering uh with a very
[12:31] bad cold." So, we want to remember that.
[12:33] Brother Amos Cuts, heard from him.
[12:34] They've got several prayer requests from
[12:36] over in Virginia. He just like for the
[12:38] church to be uh mindful of those. So
[12:41] many that we didn't take the time to
[12:42] list them all, but the Lord knows all
[12:44] about the needs. Sister Ruth Louise Jax
[12:46] is requesting prayer for her daughters.
[12:48] Remember that. Sister Lisa Lane wants to
[12:51] thank everyone for praying for her
[12:53] mother Sandy Murray. On Wednesday, she
[12:55] was experiencing severe pain due to TMJ
[12:58] complications, but thanks to your
[13:00] prayers and God moving on her behalf,
[13:03] she is doing much better. Praise the
[13:06] Lord. Give the Lord a hand on that.
[13:12] Amen. Sister Janet Payne, thank you for
[13:14] your continued prayers for her heart.

[15:05] has been going through treatments for
[15:06] bladder cancer over the last year and a
[15:08] half. She finished series of treatments
[15:11] in the spring. She went back for routine

[21:07] [Music]
[21:25] I heard the preacher talking
[21:29] about three wooden crosses
[21:32] upon a hill for everyone to see.
[21:38] Two sinners on the outside couldn't save
[21:42] themselves if they tried. All I could
[21:46] think is man that sounds like me.
[21:51] I've been the one on the left full of
[21:54] guilt and regret long gone on the wrong
[21:57] side of living. I've been the one on the
[22:00] right always looking for a fight
[22:02] thinking I could never be forgiven.
[22:05] I'm standing here today overwhelmed by
[22:08] grace cuz I know paid my cost. Thank God
[22:13] for the man on the middle cross.
[22:17] [Music]
[22:23] He didn't have to do it. But for me, he
[22:27] went through it. A love like that'll
[22:31] never understand.
[22:34] [Music]
[22:36] Lord knows I don't deserve it. And I
[22:40] know I couldn't earn it, but mercy rain
[22:44] down on this desperate man.
[22:50] I've been the one on the left full of
[22:52] guilt and regret. Long gone on the wrong
[22:55] side of living. I've been the one on the
[22:58] right, always looking for I can never be
[23:02] forgiven.
[23:04] Standing here today overwhelmed by grace
[23:07] cuz I know paid my cost. Thank God for
[23:12] the man on the middle cross.
[23:17] The cross is where he went. Oh, but that
[23:21] ain't where he stayed.
[23:24] He brought me back to life when he rose
[23:28] about that grave.
[23:31] Someday I'll stand before him. And I'll
[23:34] see Jesus face to face.
[23:38] I worship and adore him. For a life
[23:42] forever changed.
[23:44] [Music]
[23:46] I've been the one on the left, full of
[23:49] guilt and regret, long gone on the wrong
[23:52] side of living. I've been the one on the
[23:55] right, always looking for a fight,
[23:57] thinking I could never be forgiven.
[24:00] I'm standing here today overwhelmed by
[24:03] grace cuz I know paid my cost. Thank God
[24:09] for the man on the middle cross.
[24:13] Oh, thank God for the man on the middle
[24:18] cross.
[24:22] [Music]
[24:24] [Applause]
[25:00] [Music]
[25:16] Do you ever find yourself asking God
[25:20] where he's been?
[25:23] ever get up out of bed saying, "I can't
[25:27] do this again."
[25:31] Have you ever been afraid of what
[25:34] tomorrow's going to bring?
[25:38] And you're facing it alone. At least
[25:41] that's what you think.
[25:46] I can tell you after going through that
[25:49] valley, even though I couldn't see it at
[25:52] the time, it was in my weakest moments
[25:56] that he held me. And I know you'll find
[26:00] he will carry you when you can't go on.
[26:04] He will be your strength when your
[26:07] strength is gone. He will lift you up.
[26:10] He will be enough
[26:13] to get you through.
[26:15] When the road is long and you want to
[26:18] quit cuz you think you've got nothing
[26:21] left to give. You can fall apart, fall
[26:25] into his arms.
[26:29] He will carry you
[26:35] when you get the kind of news that you
[26:38] hoped you'd never hear.
[26:41] [Music]
[26:42] When you're chasing down a dream just to
[26:46] watch it disappear.
[26:50] When somebody that you love turns and
[26:54] walks away
[26:58] and they leave you standing there with
[27:01] shattered faith.
[27:05] You don't have to pick up all the broken
[27:07] pieces. You don't have to try to cover
[27:11] up the scars. You are loved and you can
[27:14] always run to Jesus just as you are. He
[27:19] will carry you when you can't go on. He
[27:23] will be your strength. When your
[27:25] strength is gone, he will lift you up.
[27:28] He will be enough
[27:31] to get you through.
[27:34] When the road is long and you want to
[27:36] quit, cuz you think you've got nothing
[27:40] left to give, you can fall apart, fall
[27:43] into his arms.
[27:47] He will carry you.
[27:53] His heart is never weary.
[27:57] No, he's never tired. Through the
[28:00] toughest fight, through the longest
[28:02] night, through the flood and through the
[28:05] fire,
[28:09] he will carry you when you can't go on.
[28:13] He will be your strength when your
[28:15] strength is gone. He will lift you up.
[28:18] He will be enough
[28:21] to get you through.
[28:24] When the road is long and you want to
[28:27] quit cuz you think you've got nothing
[28:30] left to give, you can fall apart. Fall
[28:33] into his arms.
[28:37] He will carry you.
[28:43] [Music]
[28:45] He will carry you.
[28:50] [Music]
[28:52] He will carry you.
[28:56] [Music]
[29:03] [Applause]
[29:05] [Music]
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful that he carries
[29:14] us?
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the brothers could pull up,
[29:17] I'd rather have Jesus.
[29:21] Wednesday night, Brother Donnie was
[29:23] talking about this story about the
[29:26] people that got crucified for Jesus. And
[29:29] I thought of this song, and it's an old
[29:31] song. We all know it, and I want you all
[29:32] to sing it with me. But I'd say we'd all
[29:34] say we'd rather have Jesus than anything
[29:36] in this world.
[29:38] [Music]
[29:49] I'd rather
[29:52] have Jesus
[29:56] than silver
[29:58] or gold.
[30:02] I'd rather
[30:04] be his
[30:07] than have riches
[30:10] untold.
[30:13] I'd rather
[30:15] have Jesus
[30:19] than housees
[30:21] or lands.
[30:25] I'd rather
[30:27] be led
[30:30] by his nail

[35:21] [Music]
[35:21] [Applause]
[35:27] Praise the Lord.
[35:30] Thank you, Father.
[35:32] Let's pray together.
[35:36] Lord Jesus, we realize it's none man's
[35:40] nature to want that.
[35:44] We're born lost
[35:46] out of your presence.
[35:49] and actually in a state of enemies.
[35:53] You and I at one time were enemies.
[35:58] All the rest of these people were the
[35:59] same way.
[36:01] We're so grateful that you've moved on
[36:04] our hearts and our lives and changed us
[36:08] to we're no longer enemies, but we're
[36:12] friends,
[36:14] children, beloved.
[36:17] Heavenly Father, as we've come today
[36:20] again that we could worship and sing and
[36:23] praise and hear testimonies of the great
[36:27] things that you're doing among us,
[36:29] preaching of the word.
[36:32] We're just asking that you'd help us.
[36:35] You see, our needs, they're many, but
[36:38] Lord God, we know that our God is
[36:40] greater than all of our needs combined.
[36:44] I have my hand, Father, on these prayer
[36:46] calls today. And you see the needs.
[36:49] We've just heard a great testimony of
[36:51] what you've done today of of a prayer
[36:53] cause. And as simple and foolish as it
[36:56] might seem to the world, we know it
[36:58] works. And we're grateful. Would you
[37:01] help us today, Father? Help me to be
[37:04] able to get out of the way to speak
[37:06] something that will be beneficial to
[37:09] your children. In the name of the Lord
[37:11] Jesus, we ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:17] I'm just as happy to be a Christian
[37:19] today.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; To be saved and know that the power of
[37:24] God has touched your heart and changed
[37:27] you,
[37:28] &gt;&gt; made you to what he wanted you to be.
[37:32] Let's turn if you would to second Peter
[37:33] chapter 1 verse 2. We greet you in the
[37:36] name of the Lord Jesus and that awesome,
[37:39] holy, wonderful name that we all love so
[37:42] well.
[37:44] I want to speak to you again today on
[37:46] godliness.
[37:48] How many once more godliness in your
[37:51] life?
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you.
[37:57] Second Peter 1 and2 through the
[38:00] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[38:04] according as his divine power hath given
[38:06] unto us all things that pertain unto
[38:09] life and godliness,
[38:14] through the knowledge of him that hath
[38:15] called us to glory and virtue, whereby
[38:19] given unto us exceeding great and
[38:21] precious promises,
[38:24] that by these you might be partakers of
[38:27] the divine nature. How blessed we are.
[38:30] Having escaped the corruption that is in
[38:33] the world through lust. And beside this,
[38:36] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[38:39] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[38:43] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[38:46] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[38:51] to godliness brotherly kindness,
[38:55] and to brotherly kindness, charity.
[38:58] May the Lord bless his word. You may be
[39:00] seated.
[39:08] I don't mind telling you as I've um
[39:12] been studying on godliness.
[39:16] I've been somewhat surprised
[39:20] to see the different things about
[39:23] godliness
[39:25] that
[39:27] I myself had never quite thought of
[39:30] and the attributes of godliness. And we
[39:34] know that of course godliness means to
[39:37] be like God. And I'll read to you what
[39:40] we read last week where the prophet in
[39:42] dealing with it said if you've got
[39:44] genuine faiths and put genuine virtue to
[39:46] it, genuine knowledge, genuine
[39:49] temperance,
[39:51] then genuine patience, you're moving
[39:54] right on up the line. Fifthly, at
[39:56] godliness, godliness. What does
[39:59] godliness mean? I looked in four or five
[40:02] dictionaries and couldn't even find what
[40:03] it meant. Finally, I was down at brother
[40:06] Jeff there and we found it in a
[40:08] dictionary. Godliness means to be like
[40:12] God.
[40:14] But in what sense?
[40:17] How can we be like God?
[40:21] Well, he goes on further and he reads
[40:23] the scripture of Matthew 48. We'll take
[40:26] this one. He says, jump down a little
[40:27] bit there in the quote. You know, the
[40:29] Bible says you are God's. Jesus said so.
[40:32] All things that's in God is in you.
[40:35] Matthew 5:48 quotes it again. Jesus
[40:38] speaking in the biatitudes be therefore
[40:41] perfect. He spells it. What's that?
[40:44] Perfect. Even as your father in heaven
[40:47] is perfect. You got way up here now. For
[40:50] you have to do that. Notice where this
[40:52] is at. Way up close to the top. All
[40:56] these things to be added first. Then
[40:58] when you get up here, he's asked you to
[41:01] be perfect godliness, sons and daughters
[41:05] of God. How many things I could say
[41:09] along that line. So to be
[41:13] in the attribute of godliness is to be
[41:17] like God and the simple meaning that he
[41:19] give us. But godliness reflects divine
[41:23] character and as Peter said to us also
[41:27] divine nature encompassing
[41:30] reverence for God also devotion for God.
[41:35] It's our ethical conduct our behavior
[41:40] the way we treat people uh the things
[41:44] that we love. Now this may shock you a
[41:47] little bit. Godliness is not just loving
[41:51] what God loves, but godliness is also
[41:56] hating what God hates.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Now, there are things, many things that
[42:04] God hates.
[42:07] Now, this is where some people would
[42:09] have a very difficult time because they
[42:12] have in their mind that God loves
[42:14] everything.
[42:16] But he can't do that and be God because
[42:19] there's so much darkness and evil and
[42:21] wickedness in the world. And to be like
[42:25] God is more than just not partaking of
[42:29] what God hates, but also hating it with
[42:32] the same passion that he hates it with.
[42:36] So there's some people that would not
[42:38] partake of certain things that would be
[42:40] wrong, but they actually don't hate the
[42:43] thing. Now remember, and I'm talking
[42:45] about hating people. God loves the
[42:48] sinner, but he hates the sin.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So there's things that
[42:52] God absolutely hates. So we want to love
[42:57] what God loves, and we want to hate
[43:01] actually the things that God hates. So
[43:03] that is to be godlike. Let me read this
[43:05] to you again in 1 Timothy 3:16. And
[43:08] without controversy, great is the
[43:10] mystery of godliness. So to be like God
[43:14] is a mystery. It's a mystery to be like
[43:17] God. God was manifest in the flesh,
[43:21] justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
[43:24] preached unto the Gentiles, believed on
[43:27] in the world, received up into glory.
[43:30] Now this word as with many other Greek
[43:33] words that are used in the New
[43:34] Testament, they may come from one uh
[43:36] Greek root and then out of there like
[43:38] the English language, there'll be other
[43:40] words that'll come with it. So
[43:42] godliness, godly, and several others
[43:45] come from the same thing. Listen to this
[43:47] in 2 Corinthians 1:2. For our rejoicing
[43:51] is this, the testimony of our
[43:55] conscience. Listen to the way he said
[43:57] this. The testimony of our conscience
[44:00] that in simplicity and godly sincerity.
[44:05] So there is sincerity that is not godly.
[44:09] There are many people that is just as
[44:11] sincere as they can be, but they're
[44:15] sincerely wrong.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; That type of sincerity is not godly.
[44:22] Now, having traveled around the world
[44:24] and seen many different types of
[44:26] religions myself, and I've shared with
[44:28] you some of the things that I've seen
[44:30] through the years and seen people that
[44:33] would do all kinds of things to their
[44:35] body and how that they would worship
[44:37] idols and so on and so forth. And are
[44:39] they sincere? Yep. Absolutely sincere.
[44:43] But yet, their sincerity is not godly
[44:46] sincerity. So, we don't want to just be
[44:49] sincere, but we want our sincerity to be
[44:54] godly. Is that right? Now, notice this
[44:57] word here. It is theos, the Greek word,
[45:00] and it refers to things of God, his
[45:04] counselss,
[45:06] interest, things due to him. Whatever
[45:10] can in any respect be likened unto God.
[45:16] whatever in any respect that can be
[45:18] likened unto God or resemble him in any
[45:24] way. Now notice in Paul says, "For our
[45:27] rejoicing is this, the testimony of our
[45:30] conscience that in simplicity and godly
[45:33] sincerity,
[45:35] not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
[45:37] grace of God, we have had our
[45:39] conversation in the world and more
[45:42] abundantly to youward." Now notice again
[45:45] he says that in 2 Corinthians 7:9. Now I
[45:48] rejoice. Now Paul had to say some pretty
[45:51] harsh things to the Corinthian church in
[45:54] 1 Corinthians. And he had to deal with
[45:55] some pretty tough issues. Remember there
[45:58] was adultery, fornication, different
[46:00] things that was going on, misuse of
[46:02] spiritual gifts and things like that.
[46:04] And Paul now a few years later is
[46:07] writing back in 2 Corinthians and he's
[46:10] referring back to what he did. Now
[46:12] notice the heart of a real servant of
[46:15] God when he has to deal with things in a
[46:17] corrective manner. I love the way he
[46:20] writes this. And I rejoice not that you
[46:23] were made sorry, but that you sorrowed
[46:27] to repentance. Now watch. Paul knew that
[46:30] they were made sorry because he had
[46:33] brought to light the sin that was going
[46:36] on in the church and the church was just
[46:38] letting it go right on. And there was
[46:40] other things that he had to deal with.
[46:42] And Paul said, now he said, I rejoice
[46:45] not that you were made sorry. It did not
[46:48] make him happy to make them feel heavy
[46:52] and sorrowful. But it did make him happy
[46:56] that it produced a certain type of
[47:00] sorrow. Now notice he said, "But that
[47:03] you sorrowed to repentance." Now this is
[47:06] the way every true servant of God when
[47:09] he has to preach corrective measures.
[47:12] It's to be able to promote the people
[47:14] that are guilty of doing wrong that he
[47:18] by the grace of God will help them to
[47:21] enter into a state of godly sorrow and
[47:25] they feel so bad for what they've done,
[47:28] what they said, the way they've acted,
[47:31] the way they behaved. Godly sorrow is a
[47:34] great thing to have. I hate to say it,
[47:36] but it's apparent. A lot of people in
[47:38] the age we live in, they don't have a
[47:41] clue what it's all about because they
[47:43] feel it very little, if any, anymore.
[47:47] Now, that's the hardness of this age
[47:49] we're living in. And you and I will have
[47:51] to watch ourselves because we're around
[47:54] Leodyans every day of our life. And I
[47:57] see it in the message that many message
[47:59] people are getting to a spot to where
[48:02] they do not understand godly sorrow.
[48:05] They simply get angry at the man who
[48:08] says anything to them that makes them
[48:11] feel that way because they feel bad and
[48:14] they don't like the way they feel. So
[48:16] what do they do? They take it out on the
[48:18] mailman, the man who delivered the
[48:20] message. So they get angry at him not
[48:23] realizing that you are so blessed to be
[48:26] able to still feel godly sorrow because
[48:31] many people friends just cannot feel it.
[48:34] Now notice but ye were made sorry after
[48:38] a godly manner. So there is a godly
[48:43] sorrow and there is a godly manner. So
[48:48] what we're talking about anything that
[48:50] pertains to God. So it comes from the
[48:52] very heart of God that he would anoint
[48:56] ministry and they would preach things
[48:59] that would actually in the service make
[49:02] people feel repentant and it would make
[49:04] them feel sorry and they would feel an
[49:07] element of anguish and they would feel
[49:09] an element of sadness because the word
[49:13] has exposed something in their life and
[49:15] a shortcoming. Do you understand that?
[49:18] That is a godly manner. That is a godly
[49:22] manner. True, it's only in time. But we
[49:26] all still need that. I don't know about
[49:27] you, I need that in my life. If I'm
[49:30] wrong and I I'm hearing a tape or I'm
[49:32] hearing a preacher preach, I want to be
[49:35] able to receive that from my heart and
[49:38] not wait till it makes an alter call,
[49:39] but right there bow my head while the
[49:41] preaching is going forth and say, "Lord,
[49:43] I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I did not
[49:46] realize I'd done that. Lord, I didn't
[49:48] know that was wrong. Please forgive me.
[49:50] How many happens to you all the time?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Well, you see what that is? That is a
[49:55] godly sorrow working after a godly
[49:59] manner. Now, anything now remember that
[50:02] pertains to God is godliness. Now look
[50:06] what happens to us as we come to church
[50:09] that we are participating in the mystery
[50:12] of godliness. As preachers are preaching
[50:15] to us and we're feeling our hearts being
[50:18] smitten while we're in the service and
[50:20] people look at it and tell, "Oh man, I
[50:22] was getting into it so good until I
[50:24] begin to feel so sad." Oh no. That's
[50:27] part of the mystery of godliness. You're
[50:30] blessed to be able to feel it. Now
[50:33] notice Paul goes on to say, "For that
[50:35] you were made sorry after a godly manner
[50:40] that you might receive." Notice this.
[50:42] you might receive damage
[50:46] by us
[50:48] in nothing.
[50:51] Now, can you comprehend this? That
[50:53] preachers have the ability to cause the
[50:57] people of God great damage.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Look at this word that Paul is using
[51:06] now. He said, "I I wanted you all to
[51:08] feel bad and feel sorrow, but I did not
[51:11] want to damage you." Oh, I wish every
[51:14] preacher could realize that. For you
[51:17] were made sorry after a godly manner
[51:19] that you might receive damage by us in
[51:23] nothing. Paul was saying, "I don't want
[51:25] you all to be damaged by me. I don't
[51:28] want what I'm bringing to damage you,
[51:32] but I want it to be able to bring a
[51:34] godly sorrow. And you will enter into
[51:37] this godly manner of repentance, and
[51:40] you'll feel wrong. And what does it do?
[51:42] Then it does not leave a longlasting
[51:46] damage. God gives every God called man
[51:50] something in his gift. It's not traits
[51:52] and characteristics that's in the gift
[51:54] of God, a call of God. Even when you're
[51:57] dealing with corrective things to where
[52:00] you say, "Lord, please help me to know
[52:01] when I've said enough and to shut my
[52:03] mouth up when I've said enough so I
[52:05] don't go too far." Why? It's damage
[52:08] control. And only the spirit of God can
[52:11] help you to know. You're not going to
[52:13] find any, you know, on a rate on a
[52:15] rating of 1 to 10 how far for a preacher
[52:17] to go. When you get up to about five,
[52:19] start slowing down. When you get to six,
[52:21] you're going too far. When you get up
[52:22] higher, you better be careful. But every
[52:25] preacher has this ability to damage the
[52:29] very people he's preaching truth with.
[52:31] What? Truth.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Truth. But not finding that balance and
[52:37] we're able to encourage them and to be
[52:40] able to tap them when they need to be
[52:41] tapped and to bend them over your knee
[52:44] when they need to be bent over your
[52:45] knee. Now, you see, it takes the Holy
[52:47] Ghost to be able to know how to do that.
[52:50] And Paul was so delicate after this had
[52:54] happened. Now being a preacher, I could
[52:56] relate just a little tiny tiny bit in
[52:59] the way that Paul is saying this. And
[53:00] being a preacher, you hear it a little
[53:02] bit different, I guess. But Paul is now
[53:05] so rejoicing in God. Brother Joel, he
[53:07] must have had some wonderings and some
[53:10] feelings. God, I hope I didn't go too
[53:12] far. I hope I hope I didn't press it too
[53:15] straight and too far. And watch him from
[53:17] his heart. Now he's reiterating this
[53:20] that he had felt and the wonderment
[53:23] about it. Now we said, let me read verse
[53:25] 9 again. I rejoice not that you were
[53:27] made sorry, but that you sorrowed to
[53:31] repentance, but you were made sorry
[53:33] after a godly manner. So a preacher has
[53:36] the ability then to make people feel so
[53:39] sorry, but it's not after a godly
[53:42] manner. And instead of turning them to
[53:44] repentance, a preacher has the ability
[53:47] of making them turn away from the place
[53:50] that they actually need to go to. How?
[53:53] Because he brings them so low and
[53:56] discourages them so much and some of
[53:58] them sitting there were right on the
[54:00] precipice of the brink of turning away.
[54:04] And that preacher actually brought them
[54:06] beyond that place and they made up their
[54:09] mind sitting right there in that
[54:11] service. I'm giving up. I ain't doing
[54:13] it. There's no way I can do it. Oh, God
[54:15] have mercy. Think what a serious thing
[54:18] it is for preachers with the ability
[54:20] that they have to damage people of God.
[54:24] It's such a balance. Oh, friends, pray
[54:26] for preachers like you ain't never
[54:28] prayed for them before.
[54:30] Now notice he said, "You were made sorry
[54:32] after a godly manner that you might
[54:35] receive damage by us, not by the devil,
[54:39] not by demons, but by us in nothing."
[54:44] Notice in verse 10, for godly sorrow,
[54:48] godly sorrow workketh repentance to
[54:51] salvation. Now, here to me is part of
[54:53] the mystery of godliness.
[54:56] What is godliness? So it's to be like
[54:58] God. So a child of God when they hear
[55:01] that they have done something wrong or
[55:03] they've had a wrong attitude or whatever
[55:04] it is then godly sorrow works toward
[55:08] them in a godly manner and the display
[55:12] of godliness
[55:14] is the outcome of them the man of God
[55:17] obeying the word them hearing the word
[55:19] receiving it in the right attitude. Then
[55:21] that godly sorrow works repentance. And
[55:24] the mystery of godliness has been made
[55:26] manifest in the service in several
[55:29] different ways. And them demons was
[55:31] standing there saying, "What in the
[55:32] world just happened? What in the world
[55:35] went on?" I was hoping he'd push them so
[55:38] far that it would discourage them. Who
[55:41] stopped him? What stopped him from going
[55:43] on? And then look at their hearts. Look
[55:45] at the tears running out of their eyes.
[55:47] And instead of getting mad and being
[55:49] angry, look at what it done. Oh no. Oh
[55:52] no. It's done went into that element of
[55:55] godliness which is rendered godly sorrow
[55:58] and brought about a godly manner. And
[56:00] now it's unfolding itself as a bud does
[56:03] in the spring. And it opened up itself
[56:06] and blossomed into a flower of
[56:08] repentance. And they made it right right
[56:11] there in that service.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Notice, for godly
[56:16] sorrow workketh repentance to salvation,
[56:19] not to be repented of, but the sorrow of
[56:22] the world workketh death. Now, what a
[56:24] delicate balance, you see, that a man of
[56:26] God has to bring to the people in that
[56:30] he wants to bring a godly sorrow, but
[56:32] not the sorrow of the world. What is the
[56:35] sorrow of the world? The sorrow of the
[56:37] world is so much heaviness and so much
[56:39] sadness and so much trouble. We feel it
[56:41] all around us every day, don't we? Every
[56:43] day of our life. But notice how Paul
[56:45] contrasts that not to be repented of but
[56:48] the sorrow of the world workketh death.
[56:52] So the sorrow and the heaviness of the
[56:55] world and the disappointments of life
[56:57] and the things that we go through. What
[56:59] does it work? Do you understand that
[57:01] type of sorrow actually aids and abetss
[57:04] the death that is working in your body
[57:06] already? Old age itself starts on you
[57:09] after you're about 20ome years old and
[57:11] you're getting older and old. You become
[57:12] more nervous. you become where you can't
[57:14] take things like you could and Satan
[57:16] keeps on every day of your life
[57:18] accumulating all this sorrow and that
[57:21] sorrow works on the desk in the realm of
[57:24] your mortality and it will add to your
[57:27] nervousness. It will add to your
[57:28] tension. It will add to your oppression.
[57:31] I wish somebody would hear me this
[57:32] morning. It will add to your sadness and
[57:35] that actually works on that sorrow.
[57:38] Works on that death that's in your
[57:40] mortal body. You know what it convinces
[57:42] me? We ought to be more happy.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; We ought to have more of the joy of the
[57:47] Lord in our heart. Turn that frown
[57:48] upside down and smile. You got a whole
[57:51] lot to be happy for, children.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Now notice this in verse 11. For behold
[57:56] this selfsame thing that you s startled
[58:01] after a godly sort. What carefulness it
[58:06] wrought in you. Now watch the master
[58:08] teacher and how he so selectively and
[58:10] carefully picks the right words and see
[58:13] now he's turning it around. But he
[58:15] couldn't tell them this whenever he was
[58:17] preaching it to them. He had to kind of
[58:19] let it sting and kind of burn a little
[58:21] bit because it could have been taken
[58:24] that he was saying it and then watering
[58:26] it down after he got done preaching it.
[58:29] So he had to leave it in that stern way
[58:31] and that straight way. Now he can come
[58:34] back after he's dealt with some pretty
[58:35] harsh things. And he tell him, "Now this
[58:37] is what I couldn't tell you then because
[58:40] you would have took it wrong. I would
[58:42] have give it to you this way. And if I
[58:44] would have told you this right here,
[58:46] right now, it would have actually
[58:48] watered down the effect of the word."
[58:50] Well, and God loving and so awesome that
[58:53] he would do that to us. Oh my. You
[58:56] sorrowed at a godly sort. So there's
[58:59] some sorrow that is godly. What
[59:02] carefulness it wrought in you. Yay. What
[59:05] clearing? What clearing of yourselves?
[59:09] Clearing of yourselves. What did it goly
[59:12] sorrow which worked repentance? Yay,
[59:15] what indignation? Yay, what fear? Yay,
[59:18] what vehement desire? Yay, what zeal?
[59:21] Yay, what revenge? Oh my goodness. All
[59:23] of that come out of hideburning.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Wow. So, y'all are getting more out
[59:28] again your hideburn than what you ever
[59:30] thought. If you'll take it right, you'll
[59:32] get zeal. You'll get vehement. I mean,
[59:34] it'll it'll do you so much good.
[59:38] Oh my. Yay. What revenge and all things
[59:42] you have approved yourselves to be clear
[59:46] in this matter. Oh my. Now watch again
[59:50] in 2 Corinthians 11:2. And we all know
[59:53] the scripture. I know. For I am jealous
[59:55] over you with godly jealousy. So you
[1:00:00] mean there is a jealousy that is godly?
[1:00:03] Yeah. As a matter of fact, God himself
[1:00:05] in the book of Exodus, Leviticus,
[1:00:07] Deuteronomy, many places in the Old
[1:00:09] Testament, God says that he is a jealous
[1:00:11] God. As a matter of fact, one of those
[1:00:14] places he said his name is jealous.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't know the Bible said that?
[1:00:20] Yeah, it does. That he said his name is
[1:00:23] jealous and that I am a jealous God.
[1:00:25] Now, it's not human jealousy. Human
[1:00:28] jealousy would make a man if he sees
[1:00:31] somebody else flirting with his wife, it
[1:00:33] would make him if he's got a temper, you
[1:00:34] know, want to roll up his fist and knock
[1:00:36] out a few of his teeth in his mouth or
[1:00:38] whatever that he would do. But that's
[1:00:40] not godly jealousy. That's human
[1:00:42] jealousy. But there is a godly jealousy.
[1:00:45] And this is what Paul was expressing to
[1:00:48] the church in that day that he looked at
[1:00:51] the church as one who had as a father
[1:00:53] had betrod them to Christ. And he said,
[1:00:56] "I'm jealous over you with a godly
[1:00:58] jealousy." And then he tells him why.
[1:01:01] Because notice what he said, "I have
[1:01:03] espoused you to one husband." So Paul
[1:01:07] sees the devil flirting with the church.
[1:01:10] He sees Satan and sad to say, but a lot
[1:01:13] of what he was using was preachers. And
[1:01:15] them preachers was trying to pull them
[1:01:17] away from the love of God in the way
[1:01:19] that Paul had be able to bring it to
[1:01:21] them. But he said, "I'm jealous over you
[1:01:24] all." Now, Paul was not jealous as a
[1:01:27] jealous preacher can get jealous. Now,
[1:01:29] preachers can be jealous. I don't mind
[1:01:31] telling you. And if you go preach for
[1:01:32] them in their church and the church is
[1:01:34] really blessed, they'll get jealous if
[1:01:36] the service goes too good. You want to
[1:01:38] know how I know that, huh? You know,
[1:01:40] that that's that's awful. That's
[1:01:42] absolutely terrible. That jealousy is
[1:01:44] not of God. But there is a godly
[1:01:48] jealousy that every true servant of God
[1:01:51] will have. and he'll look at the bride
[1:01:54] of God, the wife of God, and if he sees
[1:01:56] temptation and lying, whatever it is
[1:01:58] that Satan is doing, flirting with that
[1:02:01] wife of God, then that servant of God,
[1:02:04] oh my, it just really bothers him. He
[1:02:06] just said, "That's not right. That's not
[1:02:08] right." It's not that he's looking, oh,
[1:02:10] these are my people. These are my sheep.
[1:02:13] These are mine. These are mine. They're
[1:02:16] not mine. They're his.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; So, can I have a godly jealousy in a
[1:02:20] right way? Yes. I can and I do.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; I do have a godly jealousy. I'm jealous
[1:02:27] over you. Not your money. I don't want
[1:02:29] your money. You know that. I'm not
[1:02:31] asking you for your money. I don't want
[1:02:32] your things of life. I'm not jealous
[1:02:35] because well, if somebody preacher comes
[1:02:36] and he's blessed, the way I look at it,
[1:02:38] if a man of God steps behind this pull
[1:02:40] pit and you're blessed, I'm blessed.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I've said it to you before. If he can
[1:02:44] preach, praise God, and he's really
[1:02:46] anointed of the Lord and you get help,
[1:02:48] it might lighten my load for a day or
[1:02:50] two. And if he can't preach, you won't
[1:02:52] be able you you won't be able to stand
[1:02:55] you can hear me preach again. You know
[1:02:57] what? So either way, whether can preach
[1:02:59] or whether that can't preach, I ain't
[1:03:00] got nothing in my heart. There's not one
[1:03:03] servant of God that I'm jealous of in
[1:03:05] this message. Not a one. No, sir. But I
[1:03:08] do have a godly jealousy over the people
[1:03:12] of God. Now notice again in 1 Timothy
[1:03:16] 1:4, Paul said, "Neither give heed to
[1:03:18] fables and endless genealogies which
[1:03:22] minister." Notice what they do. Minister
[1:03:25] questions.
[1:03:27] Questions. Notice the people that are
[1:03:30] leaving the message. What are they
[1:03:32] focusing on? Questions.
[1:03:35] Questions.
[1:03:37] Questions. Qu I don't understand this. I
[1:03:40] can't make this fit together now. I
[1:03:42] can't make that fit together and all my
[1:03:44] questions. Paul said don't even focus on
[1:03:47] that rather than godly edifying
[1:03:51] which is in faith. So here again we come
[1:03:55] to something that can be done both godly
[1:03:58] and can be done humanly and demonically.
[1:04:02] So there is a godly edifying and there
[1:04:05] is a human edification. And Paul had to
[1:04:08] deal with this of course in 1
[1:04:10] Corinthians and it pertained to the
[1:04:12] gifts. So the people were speaking in
[1:04:14] tongues or different things that they
[1:04:15] were doing and there's no interpreter
[1:04:17] there and they would just get up in
[1:04:19] service and speak in tongues and boy
[1:04:21] they had a time. I'll tell you what they
[1:04:23] were so blessed. Those of you that have
[1:04:25] spoke in tongues, you know how awesome
[1:04:27] that it can be. And Paul had to write to
[1:04:30] him and say, "No, no, no. That's not the
[1:04:32] way it's supposed to be done. a person
[1:04:34] that's does not have an interpreter
[1:04:36] there. They're edifying themsel and
[1:04:40] they're feeling so wonderful and so good
[1:04:42] and so blessed, but everybody else is
[1:04:44] sitting there looking at them think,
[1:04:46] "What in the world are they saying? What
[1:04:48] is going on? What is that?"
[1:04:51] Self-edification.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Paul wrote about it, you know, about
[1:04:54] first Corinthians about prophecies and
[1:04:56] tongues and interpretation. And the
[1:04:58] emphasis was that they were missing in 1
[1:05:00] Corinthians was edification to the body,
[1:05:03] but they were focusing on edification to
[1:05:06] the self. And then there's demonic
[1:05:08] edification by which demons will try to
[1:05:11] use us, utilize who we are, what we are
[1:05:14] that will edify the kingdom of Satan.
[1:05:16] And in turn, there is a godly edifying.
[1:05:20] A godly edifying which is in faith. Now
[1:05:24] look at the mystery of God this morning
[1:05:26] as it unfolds. So we see that there is a
[1:05:30] a a feeling in our heart of of when I'm
[1:05:33] wrong and oh God I need to make that
[1:05:35] thing right. And you think that's
[1:05:37] ungodly. That is godly. That is godly.
[1:05:40] There is a godly jealousy. Then here we
[1:05:43] find there is a godly edifying. 2
[1:05:46] Corinthians or Timothy rather 3:12. Yay.
[1:05:49] And all that will live godly
[1:05:52] in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:05:55] persecution. Same English word but a
[1:05:58] total different Greek word
[1:06:02] which is piously or godly. So it doesn't
[1:06:06] come from the root word theos but it's a
[1:06:08] different word. But all of those that
[1:06:10] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:06:13] persecution. Now, this is why that many
[1:06:16] Christians in the day that we're living
[1:06:18] are not persecuted for their walk of
[1:06:21] Christianity. They look no different
[1:06:23] from the world. They talk no different
[1:06:25] from the world. They act no different
[1:06:27] from the world. But yet, they have a
[1:06:29] profession that they are Christians.
[1:06:31] Praise the Lord. But those who live
[1:06:33] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:06:37] persecution. And the church said,
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Any y'all ever suffer persecution
[1:06:42] because you live godly? Uh-huh. What if
[1:06:45] you know what? If our church, all of our
[1:06:46] women dressed like all the rest of the
[1:06:48] so-called Christian women of the world,
[1:06:49] and all of our young people act like
[1:06:51] them, listen to the same kind of music.
[1:06:53] They done everything they did. They
[1:06:55] smoke, they drink, they they take dope
[1:06:56] every now and then when they have to to
[1:06:58] can't make it through life. And all of
[1:06:59] our brothers, they start doing all the
[1:07:01] exact same thing. It would be amazing
[1:07:03] how much of the persecution that we go
[1:07:05] through would be totally eliminated
[1:07:07] because they would look at you and see
[1:07:09] themsel reflected in the way you act and
[1:07:12] the way you live. You see, it is the way
[1:07:14] you live, the way you talk, the way you
[1:07:17] dress, the way you act. It actually,
[1:07:19] unbeknownst to them, it makes them feel
[1:07:22] odd. It makes them feel different.
[1:07:24] Although they'll tell you you're the odd
[1:07:26] one, it's them that feels really odd
[1:07:29] about being around you. Why do you do
[1:07:31] that? Why do you do that? Well, believe
[1:07:33] it or not, all the Baptist women used to
[1:07:35] wear dresses like our women do. All the
[1:07:37] Methodist women, praise the Lord, that's
[1:07:40] right, they used to be. So, I wonder who
[1:07:42] is the odd ones then since their
[1:07:44] grandmothers used to dress the way you
[1:07:46] do and the grandmothers in the Methodist
[1:07:49] church and the Baptist. There's still a
[1:07:50] few primitive Baptists and a few that
[1:07:52] do. But you realize if we would take
[1:07:54] away all that, I'd stop reading quotes.
[1:07:57] I'd stop calling brother Random's name.
[1:07:59] then a lot of the reproach by which we
[1:08:02] are reproached by would be eliminated.
[1:08:04] But I wonder what else would be
[1:08:06] eliminated. I wonder if the healings and
[1:08:09] the miracles and the signs and the power
[1:08:11] of God that we love so much at our
[1:08:14] church, I wonder if that wouldn't go
[1:08:16] with the reproach. Let me bear the
[1:08:18] reproach in order to have Jesus.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Yay. And all that will live godly in
[1:08:24] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[1:08:26] So my question would be for many of
[1:08:29] these people who have left the message,
[1:08:30] has the persecution left with it? When
[1:08:34] were they persecuted the most? When they
[1:08:37] were following this message or now in
[1:08:39] some denominational church somewhere?
[1:08:41] Come on, somebody. Are they suffering
[1:08:43] persecution? Are they being ridiculed
[1:08:46] and laughed at? No. Because that goes
[1:08:48] with the truth. And when you let go of
[1:08:52] truth, persecution automatically goes
[1:08:55] with it.
[1:08:56] Well, praise God. Notice Titus 2:12,
[1:09:01] teaching us denying ungodliness. So,
[1:09:05] here's the opposite of godliness.
[1:09:09] Ungodliness
[1:09:11] and worldly lust. We should live
[1:09:14] soberly, righteously,
[1:09:17] and godly in this present world. Now,
[1:09:21] here it again is the same word you see.
[1:09:23] So we are to live holy lives righteously
[1:09:28] and godly in this present world. So
[1:09:31] we're not supposed to look like the
[1:09:34] world. So if our message produces the
[1:09:37] exact same thing that all the rest of
[1:09:40] Christianity does, I would have to walk
[1:09:42] away from this message today.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Why? It don't separate. It don't call
[1:09:49] people out. God has never sent a message
[1:09:52] that did not call his children out of
[1:09:55] the world.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice in Hebrews 12 verse 28,
[1:10:01] here's a different word, same English
[1:10:03] word. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[1:10:05] which cannot be moved, let us have grace
[1:10:09] whereby we serve God. God acceptably
[1:10:13] with reverence and godly fear. Now this
[1:10:17] is eucibus not but eczeibus which is
[1:10:22] devout pious and dut beautiful. So it
[1:10:26] releases something and the mystery of
[1:10:29] godliness to the hearts of those who
[1:10:31] have it. People look at it like the word
[1:10:34] of prison. They look at it that we can't
[1:10:36] do this and can't do that. Oh no, we can
[1:10:38] do the same things that everybody else
[1:10:40] does, but we just don't want to do it.
[1:10:42] Well, what is that? It's the godliness
[1:10:44] that's released in our nature which
[1:10:48] makes us want to be like God.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; It makes us want to be like that. Now,
[1:10:54] of course, our flesh is not saved and
[1:10:56] our flesh is still grammatized naturally
[1:10:58] like everybody else's flesh and
[1:11:00] therefore it sets up a great battle. But
[1:11:02] the stronger of the two will always win.
[1:11:05] Now, if your flesh is stronger than your
[1:11:07] spirit, your spiritual walk with God,
[1:11:10] you're going to constantly be living a
[1:11:11] life of defeat. You're going to be
[1:11:13] living a life where you ain't got no
[1:11:14] happiness and no joy cuz you're living
[1:11:17] way down beneath your privilege in God.
[1:11:19] Come on, somebody say amen. But if you
[1:11:22] can allow it, the spirit of God in you
[1:11:24] will help you to live godly. Oh my.
[1:11:27] Second Peter chapter 2:9. The Lord
[1:11:31] knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
[1:11:35] temptation. So you mean the godly will
[1:11:38] face temptations more so than the rest
[1:11:41] of them out of temptations and to
[1:11:44] reserve the unjust unto the day of
[1:11:48] judgment to be punished. God don't let
[1:11:50] me be there. Third John 1:6 which have
[1:11:55] borne witness of thy charity before the
[1:11:58] church whom if thou bring forward on
[1:12:01] their journey after a godly sort. Now
[1:12:05] here we come back to the original word
[1:12:06] theos after a godly sort. So there's
[1:12:11] godly temperament, godly manner, godly
[1:12:14] sort, godly jealousy. Wow, this is some
[1:12:17] of the things I'm just overwhelmed by
[1:12:18] whenever I got to looking at. So theos
[1:12:21] is refers to the things of God, his
[1:12:23] councils and interests, things due to
[1:12:25] him. Whatever in any respect can be
[1:12:27] likened unto God. All right. Now, so if
[1:12:30] we want to be like God, what is God?
[1:12:34] What is God? So God is what?
[1:12:40] Well, I mean, Brother Donnie, I mean, he
[1:12:41] he he's God. I know that. But what is
[1:12:44] God? So what is God? If I'm want to be
[1:12:48] like God, I've got to find out what God
[1:12:51] is. Read remember in Deuteronomy 4:31,
[1:12:54] "For the Lord thy God is a merciful
[1:12:58] God."
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So if I want to be like God, I've got to
[1:13:02] be merciful.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, godly children.
[1:13:06] Let's get into the mystery of godliness.
[1:13:09] For the Lord thy God is a merciful God.
[1:13:12] He will not forsake thee, neither
[1:13:14] destroys thee, nor forget the covenant
[1:13:17] of thy fathers, which he swear unto
[1:13:20] them. Now, wait a minute, Brother
[1:13:21] Donnie, that's God. How in the world can
[1:13:23] I do that? Matthew 5:7, blessed are the
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Surely not the same word
[1:13:33] that God is.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; God is merciful and I must be merciful
[1:13:40] and you must be merciful.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Now remember these are the biatitudes.
[1:13:45] Blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:13:48] obtain mercy. Luke 6:36.
[1:13:52] Be ye therefore merciful as your father
[1:13:56] also is merciful. So, can we expect
[1:13:59] everybody to obtain this level? Not to
[1:14:02] this degree. Now, we're moving into the
[1:14:04] mystery of godliness where the
[1:14:06] perfection of the godhead is in every
[1:14:09] attribute, whether it's a man or a woman
[1:14:12] or Jesus.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:14:16] So the attribute of the theos, the
[1:14:19] godhead, will manifest itself in sinners
[1:14:23] saved by grace as it did in the Lord
[1:14:26] Jesus who didn't need any saving.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Anybody want to go with me?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Notice again now what else is God? 1
[1:14:38] Corinthians chapter 1:9. God is
[1:14:42] faithful. By whom you were called unto
[1:14:45] the fellowship of his son. Isn't that
[1:14:47] beautiful? By whom you were called unto
[1:14:50] the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ,
[1:14:53] our Lord. You're not called to be a
[1:14:55] slave. You're not called to be a
[1:14:58] servant. You're called to fellowship
[1:15:01] with the Lord Jesus.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Friends, think about it.
[1:15:06] So we come to church to fellowship and
[1:15:08] to see the saints of God. That's only
[1:15:11] one reason we come to church. We come to
[1:15:13] fellowship with the Lord Jesus. So what
[1:15:16] do you do when you fellowship with your
[1:15:18] brothers and sister? You talk to them.
[1:15:21] You sit down. You eat with them, shake
[1:15:23] them by the hand, put your arm around
[1:15:24] the neck or whatever it is, and you
[1:15:26] fellowship. That's what he wants to do
[1:15:29] with us. And that's what he wants us to
[1:15:32] do with him. It ain't just about us
[1:15:34] coming to church and doing our religion.
[1:15:36] I've come today to fellowship the Lord
[1:15:39] Jesus. I've come to talk to him. I've
[1:15:41] come to praise him. I've come to put my
[1:15:43] arms around him. But I know how he feels
[1:15:45] about it. I know he wants to talk to me.
[1:15:48] I know he wants to put his arms around
[1:15:50] me. But we get in too big of a hurry.
[1:15:52] Y'all got too many plans after church
[1:15:54] today. Y'all, you need to start coming
[1:15:57] to church and say, "Well, this is what
[1:15:59] we've got planned at 2:30, but who knows
[1:16:01] what the Lord might do. We might not
[1:16:03] even be out of church, be Lord have
[1:16:05] mercy, Brother Donnie, I can't stay at
[1:16:07] church 3:00. Why not?" My goodness, you
[1:16:10] only come twice a week. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:16:13] You work way more than you come to
[1:16:14] church. You sleep way more than you come
[1:16:16] to church. It's evident that all of you
[1:16:18] eat way more than you come to church.
[1:16:20] Come on, somebody.
[1:16:22] This is our time in the presence of the
[1:16:25] Lord Jesus which we can fellowship with
[1:16:28] him.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice Ephesians 1:1. Paul, an
[1:16:33] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:16:35] God to the saints which are at Ephesus
[1:16:39] and to thee.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Ah, so here they are now taking on the
[1:16:46] attribute of godliness. They're being
[1:16:49] like God. God is faithful.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So, how many of you are faithful in the
[1:16:57] sense that God was that God said, "I'll
[1:16:59] never leave you." And yet, some of you
[1:17:01] have turned away from friends.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Whenever they didn't treat you right,
[1:17:09] brother,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; I guess I could take my iPad and finish
[1:17:14] this back in my office if y'all want me
[1:17:16] to.
[1:17:19] Brother Don, they're not deserving of
[1:17:21] kindness. And you're telling me you
[1:17:23] were.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody here deserving of mercy?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Kindness, forgiveness, love.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm talking about
[1:17:36] godliness this morning. You see, it's
[1:17:38] doing for you what no doubt I look like,
[1:17:41] too, with the deer in the headlight
[1:17:42] look. Sitting down in my study looking
[1:17:44] at it. I probably look the same way that
[1:17:46] y'all are looking at me. You know, I'm
[1:17:47] sitting up there bugeyed. Really, God?
[1:17:49] You got to be good. I mean, this is what
[1:17:50] you want. You want us to actually be
[1:17:52] like you. You want us to be like you.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; What an awesome honor.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Notice Colossians chapter 1:2. To the
[1:18:01] saints
[1:18:03] and faithful brethren in Christ which
[1:18:07] are at Colasse. Grace be unto you and
[1:18:10] peace from God our Father and the Lord
[1:18:13] Jesus Christ. Revelation 17:14. These
[1:18:16] shall make war with the Lamb, and the
[1:18:18] Lamb shall overcome them. For he is Lord
[1:18:21] of lords and King of kings, and they
[1:18:25] that are with him are called and chosen
[1:18:31] and faithful.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You mean God wants me to be faithful?
[1:18:36] Yes. Faithful to what, Brother Donnie?
[1:18:39] His word, his people. Not just your
[1:18:42] wife. Come on, somebody. Not just your
[1:18:45] three or four young ones. God wants you
[1:18:48] to be faithful in what? In everything he
[1:18:51] tells you to do. So if God says no to a
[1:18:55] prayer that you petitioned him about and
[1:18:58] you breaks your heart, what does God
[1:19:00] want? Faithfulness. I'll serve him. As
[1:19:04] Job said, though he slay me, yet I will
[1:19:07] serve him. This is the bride that's
[1:19:10] going to come back. My friends, we're
[1:19:11] talking about the bringing forth of
[1:19:13] those that's going to make war. And the
[1:19:15] bride will be released out of heaven and
[1:19:17] come back and make war. It's not them
[1:19:20] that shout and they do shout. It's not
[1:19:22] them that speak in tongues and they do.
[1:19:24] But notice the attributes of those who's
[1:19:26] coming back to fight with him. They are
[1:19:29] called and chosen and faithful.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be faithful?
[1:19:36] God is
[1:19:40] light.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; First John 15. This then is the message,
[1:19:48] the message
[1:19:51] which we have heard of him and declare
[1:19:53] unto you that God
[1:19:56] is
[1:19:57] light
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; and in him is no darkness at all.
[1:20:05] Matthew 5:14, "Ye are a light."
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When you let your
[1:20:16] light shine, you're expressing
[1:20:20] godliness.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You're being like God.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; But Donnie, I I can't I can't quote
[1:20:27] quotes. I can't quote scripture. You
[1:20:29] don't have to let your light shine. Just
[1:20:31] let it shine.
[1:20:33] Just let it shine. You're in Walmart.
[1:20:36] Let it shine. God knows Walmart needs
[1:20:38] it. Well, not so much the building, but
[1:20:39] everybody that's in there. So, wherever
[1:20:41] you're at, you're going to college,
[1:20:43] you're going to school, you're trading,
[1:20:44] you're buying, you're selling, whatever
[1:20:46] you're doing, let your light shine as a
[1:20:49] Christian, and you're breaking darkness.
[1:20:51] And you have a little element there that
[1:20:52] you could be dishonest about this, that
[1:20:55] the other. And there ain't nobody there.
[1:20:56] I'm not there watching looking over your
[1:20:58] shoulder and the deacon board ain't
[1:21:00] there. But you know what? You're a
[1:21:02] Christian and you're a godly saint of
[1:21:04] God. So, you're going to let your light
[1:21:06] shine even in a business transaction
[1:21:08] when it could make you more money if you
[1:21:10] go the other way. But you are godly on
[1:21:13] the job. You're godly at college. You're
[1:21:16] godly at school. You're godly no matter
[1:21:18] where you are. Come on, somebody. If you
[1:21:20] go down to Florida and take a vacation,
[1:21:23] you're even godly down off the beach.
[1:21:24] You don't strip down like a lizard pile
[1:21:26] up under a big pile of umbrellas down
[1:21:28] there. Come on, somebody. Uh-huh. You go
[1:21:31] to Pigeon Fort and you don't sneak down
[1:21:34] there and drink with the, you know, all
[1:21:36] the sipping places that they've opened
[1:21:37] up down in Pigeon Ford and come to the
[1:21:40] whiskey and the this and that and the
[1:21:41] other. No, you're a child of God. You do
[1:21:45] drink wine, but it's that new wine that
[1:21:47] Jesus talked about. It's that kind that
[1:21:49] makes you so drunk on the presence of
[1:21:51] God that you don't know who you are and
[1:21:54] you lose sight of this world that you're
[1:21:56] in.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] Oh my.
[1:22:02] But I love the transformation now that
[1:22:05] Paul speaks about in Ephesians 5:8. For
[1:22:09] ye were
[1:22:12] sometimes darkness.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Now, you were not in darkness.
[1:22:18] You actually were darkness.
[1:22:23] from our souls pulsated darkness.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You ever notice how people will connect?
[1:22:31] You ever notice there's anybody in the
[1:22:32] church that's getting cold on God and
[1:22:35] somebody may come in from the wild blue
[1:22:36] yonder, you know, they don't even know
[1:22:38] one another and they'll connect just
[1:22:40] like with them. Or they go to another
[1:22:41] church to visit. I've seen it in youth
[1:22:43] camps for decades
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; and youth camps. Cold kids go to, you
[1:22:46] know, to youth camp and there'll be
[1:22:48] another cold kid and they'll join
[1:22:49] together that cold kid. You know why?
[1:22:51] They don't feel comfortable out on fire
[1:22:53] kids.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; They're fanatics, man. They don't like
[1:22:57] them on fire kids. But on fire, kids,
[1:23:00] keep on fire. We need you in this day we
[1:23:02] live in. Amen.
[1:23:05] Now, you see, you were not trying to put
[1:23:08] on darkness. You were.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; You were. I was.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; We were darkness.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; What happened? What happened that I
[1:23:19] could be changed from darkness to light?
[1:23:21] The same Lord God that said, "Let there
[1:23:24] be light." And there was light. That
[1:23:27] same spoken word spoke over my soul and
[1:23:30] said, "Let there be light in his soul."
[1:23:33] And there is.
[1:23:35] That same Lord God spoke over you. Let
[1:23:38] there be light.
[1:23:43] For ye were sometimes darkness, but now.
[1:23:48] Oh, I'd like to preach to you sometime
[1:23:49] on them two words. But now, but now are
[1:23:55] ye light.
[1:23:59] You're not in the light. You are
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; light.
[1:24:04] Lord,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; but now are ye light in the Lord.
[1:24:10] walk
[1:24:12] as children
[1:24:14] of light.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Can I go on a bit?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; God
[1:24:23] is love.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Now, let me shock you.
[1:24:28] I don't want to be able to just love
[1:24:33] people
[1:24:35] and I don't want to just be lovable.
[1:24:40] This is my goal.
[1:24:43] To become
[1:24:45] love.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll let you think about it for a
[1:24:52] minute and then I'll read it to you.
[1:24:54] First John 4:8, he that loveth not
[1:24:58] knoweth not God.
[1:25:01] For God, now God is not just loving,
[1:25:05] though he is. That's an attribute
[1:25:06] though. Loving.
[1:25:09] God isn't just loving.
[1:25:12] And God isn't just lovable,
[1:25:15] but God is actually love.
[1:25:20] And he loved the unlovable. Romans 5:6.
[1:25:24] For when we were yet without strength,
[1:25:28] in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
[1:25:33] For scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:25:36] one die. Yet p venture for a good man.
[1:25:40] Some would even dare
[1:25:42] to die.
[1:25:44] But God commendest his love toward us in
[1:25:49] that while we were yet sinners,
[1:25:54] Christ died
[1:25:56] for us.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Make me more like you, Jesus.
[1:26:02] Notice this. And the prophet, he picks
[1:26:03] us up about love and he said, "Now we're
[1:26:05] partakers of his divine nature." You get
[1:26:07] it? Then you become a partaker after
[1:26:10] coming into his body. A partaker of his
[1:26:14] divine nature. Christ's nature in you.
[1:26:18] How can you cheat,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; steal,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; lie,
[1:26:24] backslide,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; procelitect,
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; everything else with the divine nature
[1:26:29] of Christ in you? It's impossible. Let
[1:26:33] that soak just a few minutes now cuz
[1:26:34] it's right. If you be a partaker in
[1:26:37] Christ and you become a new creature,
[1:26:39] old things have passed away. All things
[1:26:41] are become new. And the church said,
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; "All of our warings and fussings and
[1:26:48] stewings and arguings and tempers,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; come on. All these things
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; pass away.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Help us Jesus.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; All our warings
[1:27:12] and fussings and stewings and arguings
[1:27:17] and tempers,
[1:27:21] all these things pass away.
[1:27:25] Now he goes on down a little bit further
[1:27:27] in the quote and says, "But the fruit of
[1:27:29] the spirit is first love." Love who?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Then is when you love those
[1:27:37] who are unlovable.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Have you ever dealt with people that
[1:27:46] just a stinking rotten and sorry good no
[1:27:50] good for nothing low down bunch of
[1:27:52] trash?
[1:27:54] Oh my
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; that ain't even worth loving.
[1:28:00] I ain't wasting my love.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But if you're that short, I advise you
[1:28:04] not to
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; until you get this dose.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Because you get this dose, it makes you
[1:28:11] love the unlovable. Now, let's just be
[1:28:14] honest, friends. There's something about
[1:28:15] us as humans. There are certain people
[1:28:17] that we can love easier than others.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:25] Well, we're certainly glad to have so
[1:28:27] many angels here with us today. Y'all
[1:28:29] tricked me there for a minute cuz you're
[1:28:31] looking like regular people that come
[1:28:32] into church here and you out on their
[1:28:33] clothes, I guess. And I I just didn't
[1:28:35] recognize it. We're going to have to
[1:28:37] hang up a a special coat rack out there,
[1:28:40] I guess, for angelic wings so y'all can
[1:28:42] hang them out there. And you're
[1:28:44] fluttering me so much up here.
[1:28:47] Come on.
[1:28:49] You see, God can love people that would
[1:28:52] spit in his face.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:29:08] Spirit is first love. Love who? Then is
[1:29:11] when you love those who are unlovable.
[1:29:13] That's the spirit of Christ. Love, joy,
[1:29:17] peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:29:18] meekness, gentleness, patience. There's
[1:29:20] the fruit of the spirit. Again, he said,
[1:29:23] "Love moved a mighty God.
[1:29:28] God so loved the world, the unlovable,
[1:29:33] till he came down and made himself flesh
[1:29:36] here on earth. and dwelt among men to be
[1:29:39] spit upon and mistreated and be laughed
[1:29:42] at and made fun of them
[1:29:45] fun and to redeem us back. What ought we
[1:29:48] to do tonight? Take our places by the
[1:29:52] side of the cross and say, "Here I
[1:29:54] stand, Lord Jesus. I come. I come. I
[1:29:58] wash all my sins away. Take my malice.
[1:30:01] Take my difference away from me. Let me
[1:30:04] love you, Lord, with a fervent love.
[1:30:06] Then all these little old things will
[1:30:09] pass away.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; You see, this is something about God
[1:30:15] that I'll have to say I never I never
[1:30:17] realized until I came to the message.
[1:30:20] And as I've been studying this in the
[1:30:22] last week and a half or so, it's made
[1:30:24] more real to me why that some of the
[1:30:27] folks who've pulled away from the
[1:30:28] message that they really don't want the
[1:30:31] message and they can't live
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; this kind of a lie.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Now, it's much easier for them to read
[1:30:38] portions of scripture in the Bible
[1:30:41] with no preacher really preaching on.
[1:30:43] So, they just select out certain
[1:30:44] scriptures and oh yes, I'm a Christian
[1:30:45] and I'm I'm this that and the other. But
[1:30:47] a prophet had a way of bringing it down
[1:30:49] where the, you know, where the rubber
[1:30:51] meets the road type of thing. And as I
[1:30:53] begin, look at this, I realized, oh, so
[1:30:56] this is one of the reasons why I'm
[1:30:58] leaving the message. I'm getting away
[1:31:00] from all I'm leaving this and other. So
[1:31:02] what what part are they leaving?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; They're leaving love and mercy and
[1:31:06] forgiveness. And
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; come on,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; cuz our message is full of love. It's
[1:31:12] full of mercy. It's full of grace. Yes.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; But I realize, brother Dave, a lot of
[1:31:17] these folks, it's evident by what they
[1:31:18] turn into once they leave. They cannot
[1:31:21] live this word.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; And neither can you and I unless he
[1:31:25] himself gets in.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Now notice this attribute about God.
[1:31:32] God is a lover.
[1:31:37] Now this is preached the year I was
[1:31:39] born, 1956.
[1:31:42] And I want all those years of my life
[1:31:46] fearing God. Even after I become a
[1:31:48] preacher,
[1:31:50] I was scared of God.
[1:31:53] And I got under a fear
[1:31:56] even in Pentecost
[1:31:58] that if I did not fast every week,
[1:32:02] I was afraid. I was afraid God wouldn't
[1:32:04] use me. I was afraid of this. I'm afraid
[1:32:07] of that. So I fast three days, 5 days, 7
[1:32:10] days, 10 days. Longest I ever went was
[1:32:13] 14.
[1:32:16] Setting up tents, driving tents, stakes,
[1:32:18] all kinds of things. It's wonder we
[1:32:20] hadn't died. Ain't Harry? I've seen my
[1:32:23] wife fast till she's so weak she
[1:32:27] couldn't hardly get out of the bed.
[1:32:30] Something wrong with fasting? No,
[1:32:32] nothing wrong with fasting. But it's the
[1:32:34] idea that you're doing it under. And it
[1:32:36] becomes such a bondage and a fear. If I
[1:32:39] did not fast, God would not use me. And
[1:32:43] if I made a mistake, he's out to get me.
[1:32:46] And if I mess up, he's going to get me.
[1:32:49] You said, "That's crazy, is it?" Brother
[1:32:51] Brandham said he used to think God hated
[1:32:53] him, but Jesus loved him.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But he found out that it's the same
[1:32:57] person.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what the message done
[1:33:02] for him. It's no wonder that he could
[1:33:04] bring love to us like this because
[1:33:05] that's the way he looked at it, too.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; But look what it does. What the message
[1:33:11] does to release you from that type of
[1:33:14] fear.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; God is a lover. God is love. And God so
[1:33:19] loved the world when they were unlovable
[1:33:21] that he gave his son to make them
[1:33:22] lovable. Here it is. God wants to come
[1:33:25] down
[1:33:27] and make love to you.
[1:33:30] Listen
[1:33:32] at these adjectives and verbs together.
[1:33:35] He's seeking
[1:33:37] verb action. Thirsting,
[1:33:42] hungering,
[1:33:44] trying to get to some of your starchy
[1:33:46] hearts
[1:33:49] to make love to you.
[1:33:53] Can you imagine that you and I have
[1:33:55] something that almighty God wants?
[1:34:01] And you know why he hungers? Cuz we
[1:34:03] deprive him.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Now, wouldn't it be so foolish? I get
[1:34:13] thirsty enough. I'm going to drink this.
[1:34:15] But wouldn't it be so foolish if I was
[1:34:17] so thirsty in parts and y'all sitting
[1:34:18] there thinking, "Brother Donnie, drink
[1:34:20] it. Son, drink it. What's the matter
[1:34:22] with you?" What if I go to drink and
[1:34:25] somebody go, "Oh, no. You can't have the
[1:34:26] Hey, hey, don't you don't you do that.
[1:34:29] And God says, "I want to make love to
[1:34:31] you. I want to pull you up close to me
[1:34:34] and whisper my secret things to you. I
[1:34:38] loved you before the world began."
[1:34:41] And you're mine.
[1:34:44] But when you ain't working, you're
[1:34:47] fishing. And when you ain't fishing,
[1:34:50] you're playing video games. And when you
[1:34:52] ain't playing video games, you're
[1:34:54] sleeping.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And when you ain't sleeping, you're
[1:34:56] hawking. And when you ain't hucking,
[1:34:58] you're polishing your car. And when you
[1:35:00] ain't doing that, you're doing this and
[1:35:02] doing that and doing that and doing that
[1:35:04] and doing that.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; And about the only time I get is three
[1:35:11] times a day. Lord Jesus, bless his food.
[1:35:13] Amen. Thank you.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And then when you lay down 10 seconds
[1:35:17] before your eyes fall asleep because
[1:35:18] you're so wore out because you've been
[1:35:20] so busy.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Man, I'll tell you one thing. golfing
[1:35:23] and playing kickball and football and
[1:35:25] baseball and basketball and soccer and
[1:35:27] horseback riding and hiking and boating
[1:35:29] and fishing.
[1:35:31] That stuff wears you out, don't it?
[1:35:40] And then at night, Lord God, I forgot to
[1:35:43] tell you our electric bills passed due
[1:35:46] and our mortgage. Baby, God help me. Me
[1:35:50] and my kids, my wife's been fixing me.
[1:35:52] Throw down the God, I ain't churching
[1:35:55] over there. Lord God, you see the
[1:35:56] alternator went out on a car and I had a
[1:35:58] blowout on my Jeep coming to church
[1:36:00] today. And God, I've got this and I've
[1:36:01] got that.
[1:36:05] I wonder if we make him feel like a JC
[1:36:07] Penney store
[1:36:09] or Sears and Robuck catalog.
[1:36:13] So, we place in our order.
[1:36:17] No thanks.
[1:36:24] No appreciation.
[1:36:27] No, I loved you sir.
[1:36:30] No, you mean everything to me.
[1:36:34] And another day you lived your life and
[1:36:35] your short existence. And let me remind
[1:36:37] you about your life. Speaking of life,
[1:36:40] it is as a vapor.
[1:36:43] David said, "Your days are like the span
[1:36:45] of a hand.
[1:36:49] So if a man lives three score in 10 70
[1:36:52] years
[1:36:53] and this is your span
[1:36:56] 20 30 40
[1:37:00] this is your span of your life like a
[1:37:02] vapor a mist that appears on the earth
[1:37:05] and it's gone.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; So one day leads to another and another
[1:37:09] and oh I'm going to do better absolutely
[1:37:12] I I made up my mind I'm going to do
[1:37:13] better but I just can't do it today.
[1:37:16] I've already got all these things going
[1:37:18] and all this stuff planned. And you know
[1:37:19] what? The devil will make sure tomorrow
[1:37:22] and the next day and the next day and
[1:37:25] the next day and the next day and then
[1:37:28] before you know it, you look at yourself
[1:37:30] and you're 50, 60, 70 years old
[1:37:35] and you think, "Oh no,
[1:37:39] I had all these great intentions.
[1:37:46] Speak to us, Lord.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; He's seeking, thirsting, hungering,
[1:37:54] trying to get some of your starchy
[1:37:56] hearts to make love to you as a love
[1:37:59] affair. Not fear, not bondage, a love
[1:38:03] affair. Not a law, but a love. It's all
[1:38:08] love. God so loved. My prayer is for the
[1:38:11] church that we can have such love till
[1:38:14] we love people whether they love us or
[1:38:16] not.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs today is to
[1:38:20] express a love even to a man that could
[1:38:22] spit in your face. Now he's bringing you
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; like Jesus.
[1:38:33] And you could still with not from a
[1:38:36] hypocritical standpoint,
[1:38:38] but from your heart pray for that man's
[1:38:42] soul.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. If you can just love
[1:38:47] those who love you while the sinners do
[1:38:49] the same thing, but we're different.
[1:38:52] When Christ has come into our heart, we
[1:38:54] love those who do not love us.
[1:38:58] Love the unlovable. And when we were
[1:39:01] unlovable one time too, you know, and
[1:39:03] Christ loved us until we came to him.
[1:39:05] Then if we be of Christ and Christ is in
[1:39:09] us, we have the same spirit of
[1:39:12] fellowship. Listen to this. And
[1:39:15] cooperation.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And helping to try to move the great
[1:39:22] load and make life a little easier.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. for your fellow man.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Brothers, let's skip a
[1:39:37] few and I'll close here. Come over to
[1:39:39] Thou Knowest All Things in Hammond in
[1:39:41] Indiana, 1952. Let's stand together.
[1:39:43] We'll pick it up again, Lord willing.
[1:39:48] There isn't nothing else that you can
[1:39:50] do, only believe.
[1:39:52] And if you believe, then them little
[1:39:54] immoral things would just drop off like
[1:39:56] that.
[1:39:59] As you believe,
[1:40:02] you become
[1:40:04] love,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; not loving
[1:40:12] love.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; So, you love those that hate you. It's
[1:40:17] strange, I know. You hate the sin, but
[1:40:21] love the sinner.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; You hate the wrong and the wickedness
[1:40:25] and whatever that people do. But if
[1:40:26] we're not careful, we'll merge that
[1:40:29] hatred for their sin over to them and we
[1:40:32] will look at them. We're calling it
[1:40:34] zeal. Oh yeah, zeal. Boy, I'm so zealous
[1:40:37] for God. I wonder if God would call it
[1:40:40] that.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Or if God would call it hate, but we're
[1:40:44] thinking it's our hatred for their sin.
[1:40:47] Is it really?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Is it really?
[1:40:51] Or do we look at them with such pity
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; and pray that God can deal with them,
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; godliness?
[1:41:03] Who wants to be more godly?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Me too.
[1:41:11] Let's bury it.
[1:41:15] I
[1:41:17] was sinking
[1:41:20] deep
[1:41:22] in sin,
[1:41:24] far from the peaceful
[1:41:28] shore,
[1:41:32] very
[1:41:34] deeply
[1:41:36] stained
[1:41:38] with sin,
[1:41:40] sinking to rise. pass
[1:41:44] no more
[1:41:47] but the master
[1:41:50] of
[1:41:53] oh thank you Lord heard my despairing
[1:41:59] cry
[1:42:00] [Music]
[1:42:03] from the waters
[1:42:07] lifted
[1:42:09] me
[1:42:11] now save
[1:42:13] and
[1:42:18] let's sing it together now. Need to
[1:42:20] change the chords.
[1:42:22] Love
[1:42:24] lifted
[1:42:26] me.
[1:42:30] Love
[1:42:32] lifted
[1:42:34] me.
[1:42:36] Ain't God
[1:42:38] where
[1:42:40] nothing
[1:42:42] else could help
[1:42:46] love
[1:42:48] lifted
[1:42:50] me. Can we sing it together? Oh, God's
[1:42:54] love
[1:42:56] lifted
[1:42:58] me.
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] Love
[1:43:03] lifted
[1:43:06] near.
[1:43:09] When
[1:43:11] nothing
[1:43:13] else
[1:43:15] could help,
[1:43:17] love
[1:43:19] lifted
[1:43:20] me. Oh, praise God.
[1:43:25] all my heart
[1:43:28] to him I give.
[1:43:32] Ever to him I will cling.
[1:43:37] Don't you feel that way today? In his
[1:43:41] blessed
[1:43:43] presence
[1:43:44] live. Thank you Lord God. Ever his
[1:43:48] praises I'm going to sing.
[1:43:54] Love so mighty
[1:43:57] and so true
[1:44:01] merits my soul's
[1:44:05] best song.
[1:44:09] Faithful
[1:44:10] loving
[1:44:12] service
[1:44:14] to to him. Everybody now. Oh, can we
[1:44:20] just close our eyes and raise our hands
[1:44:21] and sing it to him now? Love
[1:44:25] lifted
[1:44:27] me. Everybody with all your heart. Love
[1:44:32] lifted
[1:44:34] me
[1:44:38] when
[1:44:40] nothing
[1:44:41] else.
[1:44:44] Oh God, help us, Lord.
[1:44:48] We're so grateful for the love you give
[1:44:49] to us. Help us, Lord God, to express
[1:44:52] that gratitude by giving that same love
[1:44:56] to others.
[1:44:57] Those that are unlovable, those Lord God
[1:45:00] that aren't even worthy as we'd say.
[1:45:03] But Lord God, love through us, Jesus.
[1:45:07] When nothing
[1:45:10] else
[1:45:11] could help,
[1:45:14] love
[1:45:16] lifted.
[1:45:17] Listen to that first verse again. I was
[1:45:19] sinking.
[1:45:21] I
[1:45:22] was sinking so deep in sin,
[1:45:28] far from the peaceful
[1:45:32] shore.
[1:45:34] Thank you, Lord God.
[1:45:36] Sing it to him now. Very deeply stained
[1:45:41] within.
[1:45:42] I had gone down for the last count,
[1:45:45] sinking to rise no more.
[1:45:48] Oh, but thank God. But the master of
[1:45:54] the sea,
[1:45:56] he heard my despairing
[1:46:00] cry
[1:46:03] from the wall
[1:46:07] that's lifted
[1:46:09] me now. Save
[1:46:12] am
[1:46:14] I.
[1:46:16] Oh, God's love
[1:46:19] lifted
[1:46:21] me. Everybody sing it with all your
[1:46:23] heart now. Love
[1:46:26] lifted
[1:46:28] me.
[1:46:30] Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:32] When
[1:46:34] nothing
[1:46:35] else could have his love.
[1:46:44] Oh, his love
[1:46:48] it lifted
[1:46:50] me.
[1:46:52] Thank God
[1:46:54] it lifted
[1:46:57] me
[1:47:00] where
[1:47:02] nothing
[1:47:03] else
[1:47:05] could help.
[1:47:10] Love
[1:47:13] lifted
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:18] me.
[1:47:21] Oh, it lifted me.
[1:47:27] Thank you, Lord God.
[1:47:32] Hallelujah.
[1:47:34] Live through me, Holy Spirit.
[1:47:38] Praise God.
[1:47:41] Now I realize today I might have
[1:47:43] preached the first Corinthian phase of
[1:47:46] this,
[1:47:48] but hopefully I can come back maybe next
[1:47:50] week or week after that and preach the
[1:47:53] second Corinthian phase of this.
[1:47:56] And maybe I can say I'm so sorry you
[1:47:59] were made sorry. But I'm just sorry you
[1:48:02] wasn't made sorry. to worldly sorry
[1:48:04] because then you'd be sorry like
[1:48:05] everybody else out here that's sorry but
[1:48:08] I'm so glad you was made sorry with a
[1:48:09] godly sorrow.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; And now I can see the smile on your face
[1:48:13] that that godly sorrow worked repentance
[1:48:15] and you asked the Lord to help you to be
[1:48:17] a better person.
[1:48:19] How I long to preach my last second
[1:48:23] Corinthian
[1:48:25] sermon
[1:48:27] when the people have attained
[1:48:30] to what God knows is the final mark
[1:48:34] and the capstone will come down
[1:48:37] and cap us off.
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:41] Let's sing this together now.
[1:48:45] Oh Jesus,
[1:48:49] we live through.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Holy
[1:48:55] Spirit,
[1:48:57] live through me.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Live through me, Jesus.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Don't just preach to me, Lord, but live
[1:49:04] through me.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; I will be your house
[1:49:10] to dwell in.
[1:49:14] through history.
[1:49:17] Praise the Lord God.
[1:49:19] Hallelujah.
[1:49:21] I will be that good
[1:49:25] Samaritan
[1:49:28] to some
[1:49:31] else indeed.
[1:49:34] Live through me.
[1:49:38] Holy
[1:49:40] Spirit come all sing together through
[1:49:44] me.
[1:49:45] Same words again. Hol
[1:49:49] live through me.
[1:49:53] Holy
[1:49:54] Spirit
[1:49:56] lives through me.
[1:50:03] I
[1:50:05] will be
[1:50:07] yours
[1:50:09] to dwell in
[1:50:12] live through me.
[1:50:18] I will be
[1:50:21] that good
[1:50:24] Samaritan
[1:50:27] to some
[1:50:29] else in need.
[1:50:33] Live through me.
[1:50:37] Holy
[1:50:39] Spirit
[1:50:40] live
[1:50:42] through me
[1:50:47] and love through me.
[1:50:51] Holy
[1:50:53] Spirit,
[1:50:55] love
[1:50:56] through me.
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:51:02] I want to be your house to dwell in so
[1:51:10] you can love through me.
[1:51:17] Let me be that good
[1:51:22] Samaritan
[1:51:25] to some
[1:51:28] else in need.
[1:51:31] Love through me.
[1:51:35] Holy
[1:51:37] Spirit,
[1:51:39] love
[1:51:40] through me.
[1:51:46] Forgive
[1:51:47] through me.
[1:51:50] Holy
[1:51:51] Spirit,
[1:51:53] forgive through me
[1:51:57] [Laughter]
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:52:01] as I lift
[1:52:04] my hands in worship.
[1:52:08] forgive through me.
[1:52:15] I will be that good

[1:56:44] love through you.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:56:50] Praise your name, Lord.
[1:56:53] We worship you, Lord.
[1:56:56] We worship you, Lord.
[1:56:58] Can we just raise our hands now with
[1:57:00] just all of our hearts and the sincerity
[1:57:03] in our hearts? Let's just give Jesus a
[1:57:06] little bit of loving today
[1:57:11] until we get there where we physically
[1:57:13] can put our arms around him.
[1:57:16] Believe it or not, he wants your loving.
[1:57:20] He wants you to take time to tell him
[1:57:24] how you feel about him and what he means
[1:57:25] to you.
[1:57:27] Hallelujah. Even angels cannot replace
[1:57:30] you when it comes to that.
[1:57:33] So before we go, can we just give Jesus
[1:57:36] a little bit of our loving which is
[1:57:38] reserved only for him. We love our
[1:57:39] children. Us brothers love our wives and
[1:57:42] sisters love your husbands. We love our
[1:57:43] grandchildren. We love many, many things
[1:57:46] of life.
[1:57:48] But what about Jesus?
[1:57:50] You get home, your little dog will go to
[1:57:52] run up in your lap or your cat or
[1:57:53] whatever you have and you see your
[1:57:55] grandkids after church and you'll open
[1:57:57] up your arms and say, "Come here and see
[1:57:59] Poppy or come and see Grammy." Whatever
[1:58:00] it is you say. Why? Cuz you want a
[1:58:03] little bit of loving from them. What if
[1:58:06] you can magnify that a millions of times
[1:58:09] the Lord God has his arms opened up to
[1:58:11] us today saying, "Children, give me a
[1:58:15] little of your loving."
[1:58:18] Oh, hallelujah. Jesus,
[1:58:21] we worship you, great Adonai.
[1:58:25] We were lost, but you found us. We were
[1:58:28] wretched. We were blind. And we were
[1:58:30] naked, but you clothed us. You changed
[1:58:33] us. You transformed us. And now you've
[1:58:37] made us your bride.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; So if you are a lover,
[1:58:42] oh hallelujah, and we're to be godly,
[1:58:46] then we are to be a lover, too.
[1:58:49] We know Satan patterns himself the same
[1:58:51] way. So he wants his children to be
[1:58:52] lovers of the world and the things of
[1:58:54] the world and we can see that in them.
[1:58:56] They love it. Then heavenly father we
[1:58:59] also are a lover. A lover of God, a
[1:59:03] lover of purity, of righteousness, of
[1:59:05] honesty, integrity, character. We love
[1:59:08] to worship you. We love to praise you.
[1:59:10] We love to sing.
[1:59:13] It may seem odd and unusual, but I love
[1:59:15] to lift my hands when I feel absolutely
[1:59:18] nothing. I love to lift my voice when I
[1:59:22] feel nothing
[1:59:24] cuz I
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; am a lover and I don't love the devil
[1:59:30] and I don't love his world, but I love
[1:59:34] you
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; and your children and your cause and
[1:59:38] your intention and your purpose and your
[1:59:40] motives. I love you, my Jesus.
[1:59:44] Hallelujah.
[1:59:46] Oh, we worship you, Lord God.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Can we just worship him now? Just just
[1:59:54] take a couple of minutes and I'll let
[1:59:55] you go. I don't mean to wear you out
[1:59:57] when we get together, but I just love to
[2:00:00] be in his presence so much myself. I
[2:00:03] don't know about you, but I have to
[2:00:04] fight hell every day of my life. And
[2:00:06] when I get in his presence, I don't get
[2:00:08] in no hurry to leave. Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; I want to sit at your feet,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; drink from this cup in your hand,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Lord God, back against you and breathe.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Feel your heartbeat.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; This love is so deep.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's more than I can
[2:00:41] understand
[2:00:44] how you rest in your peace. It's
[2:00:48] overwhelm.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's it. Children,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; just love on him. Just love him. Take
[2:00:54] him.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; The more I seek you.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Whisper to him. I love you, Jesus. I
[2:01:00] love you, Jesus.
[2:01:02] The more I find you.
[2:01:08] Oh,
[2:01:11] the more I find you,

[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; my Lord, the more I love you.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you, Lord.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; I want to sit at your feet. Drink from
[2:01:31] this cup in your hands. Lay back again.
[2:01:37] back against and brea.

[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Feel your heart be.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; This love is so deep.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; It's more than I can understand.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; I rest in your peace. It's overwhelming.
[2:02:02] The more I seek you with all your hearts
[2:02:07] now. Oh, the more
[2:02:11] I find you,
[2:02:17] my Lord. The more
[2:02:20] I find you,
[2:02:25] the more it makes me love you.
[2:02:33] Want to sit at your feet. What an honor
[2:02:36] to sit at your feet in your hand. Lay
[2:02:41] back against you and breathe.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Feel your heart.
[2:02:50] This love
[2:02:53] is more than I can understand.
[2:02:58] I rest in your peace. It's overwhelming.
