the support rather Donnie gives us youth this youth the youth here at this church and you know some pastors don't they just don't invest that much in their in their young people and the love that he

we're part of a wonderful body of believers here the spirit of the camp was just amazing the the the sense brotherly love and kindness just grows year by year it gets stronger and stronger there was so much victory the the the young people just were one of the you know I say this every year but they're just one of the finest groups that we've ever had there they they always just continue to be a product of the families and the homes that we have here in this church and it's it's a it's amazing to me we're just so blessed you know brother branham saw those little flickers a lot in that dark stream we some of our young people are those all right we've got young people here who have the Holy Ghost do you know what a blessing that is you know what what a blessing it is what an honor it is

tonight you can be seated god bless you we're gonna try I don't I don't normally like to talk it's not my job to talk just sing I feel like this song needs a little bit of just a tiny bit of background in the Old Testament how many was heard of Miss Phoebus chef I can't even pronounce his name and that's what this song is about him being carried to the table and you know the to me the song means that we can't see our brokenness when we're at God's table and to me that's sitting under the word and somehow I feel normal when I'm under the word and I feel like I'm not broken and I know that's the inner part this flesh is broken and we're flawed but I thank God for his table that we pull out two every week I think God for it so y'all pray for me try to get through this one [Music] [Applause] wounded and forsaken I was shattered by the fall broken and forgotten feeling lost and summoned by the king into the Masters courts lifted by the Saviour and cradling his own scary to the table seated where I don't belong carry to the table swept away by his [Music] and I don't see my brokenness anymore when I've seated at the table [Music] the table fighting thoughts of fear wondering why he called my name am I good enough to share this cup this world is left me lying but even in our weakness Jesus calls our name his whole presence we are healed and on a shame [Music] maybe to do the table seated where we [Music] yes we're carry to the table [Music] swept away by Godzilla and we don't see our brokenness anymore when we're seated at the table very to the table [Music] hold the table of you carried me my god you carried me [Music] my god you can you carry me my god you can't read me my god you carry as we're carry to the tape see [Music] very to the table swept away [Music] we don't see our brokenness we're seated at the table [Music] to the [Music] the table of yes we're carry the tale of our [Music] [Applause] capable of the Lord tonight I'll tell you we ain't good this weekend didn't we hey man so appreciate it brother Matt appreciate you fine young men that commit themself to the Lord and take the gift that God's giving them let's turn if you would to night to the book of Acts chapter 20 begin reading verse 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood for I know this which must have been a sad thing to know some things you know were good things to know some things you know aren't painful some things you know were heartbreaking for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them who is it Kingdom builders now they'll come in the name of Jesus they'll come speaking about the cross but really the theme of what they're wanting is you me to follow them they are the focal points that's why everything comes right back to them it's how great they are how gifted they are annointed they are they're the only ones going and the closer you become to part of that inner circle everybody else is all the way out this is prophecy it was said 2,000 years ago it's still coming to pass this very day hey man let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus how we thank you for your word tonight father we're so grateful that we believe tonight dear God that we are part of your church we realize Lord being a part of that it's it's as if though a target is on our back or the word preacher or a lay member or whatever we are Satan hates us because of your love toward us we're grateful Lord Jesus that we are part of this great Church of the Living God we ask you to take a word tonight Lord and just speak to us help us father that we can be benefitted by your word and we know that we shall be if we open our hearts tonight Lord you see this prayer cost that I have in my hand that I want to wear tonight as a speak Lord this situation your father for brother Dave Swanson you know all about it Lord and his family and passing of sister Lydia's father which is pray for your mercy your grace that should help the family during this loss during this time Lord speak to us tonight your word in Jesus name and the Saint said god bless you may be seated Paul says for I know this some things we know by knowledge some things in oba pattern we know about the way that they repeat himself down through time no doubt this was so illuminating to this prophet by the Spirit of God that he knew it the young pattern he knew it beyond type he knew it beyond historical value but he knew it by revelation he knew that by his prayer being there and I hope you can take this right then the presence of of a strong anointed gifted servant of God that within itself has a great ability of keeping much evil away from a flock by Paul's presence being among the people he knew that much was held at bay it did not stop at all but much was kept bad because he was such a strong gifted anointed person he knew when that presence was no longer there that these men who had been waiting who had been watching for the opportunity that they would arise and he said for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock now his ability by the Spirit of God no doubt a very strong leader because you didn't play with Paul because if you done something he would rebuke you it didn't make a difference if your name was Peter or whoever you was it made no difference to this man is their eye so that would then itself will kind of hold people back a little bit and he knew that and he knew whenever his presence was gone that some of them were waiting for that very opportunity now whether he would actually ever come back this way again at a historically he never come back in this direction again from Meletis and on down through the vicinity where he had been and some of them was waiting for the very time that he would not return some of them no doubt waiting when he would leave the earth and whatever he did this was their opportunity Timothy was a strong man but not quite as strong as Paul was and I realized some folks resent a strong man they won a weak man they want a man which tries to butter up everything and you know make everything gentle and brother branham talked about himself and he talked about brother Neville and he talked about the church order and the tabernacle some of the things which needed to be said and he said it brother Neville was a gentle person an easy person easy type of gone and he said sometimes too gentle but he said it just so happens that I can say it now most people don't like a man like that they would much rather have a man that's easy gentle one they can push so they'll turn a man like that hard harsh mean militant yeah well this is the kind of man that Paul was Timothy historically wasn't like that even in the scripture he wasn't that way because really he didn't need to be but yet Paul because of this Jesus was the type of individual that he could look at people with such compassion and such love and you look at others and call them dogs oh my goodness and I've scared y'all to death now you're afraid to breathe go ahead and match your eyes your eyeballs will fall out if you don't so go ahead and bat your eyes now Paul could be this way I dare say there was not a more loving man in the New Testament and Paul was other than the Lord Jesus because of what he done but people misunderstand law they think that love is always letting people get what they want and letting them get by with whatever more that's not love at all that's a pushover but yet not only do the sheep read that but also the wolves read it as well now Paul identified these and he called them Grievous wolves and the Greek word here is heavy strong mighty or dangerous wolves but it's also a compound word which means fat wolves now these wolves were going to become fact on the blood and the fleece of the sheep so they're gonna be fat wolves not from eating other wolves not from eating bears but from eating sheep so they will fatten themselves on the blood of the Sheep now the sheath themselves don't have the ability to resist this type of a force they don't have the ability to fight you know a dog can buy a horse can kick a cow can butt and kick as well a donkey all kinds of animals have all type of self-protection mode but a sheep has none so if you see folks in our shirts that know how to fight they know how to gossip they know how to talk they know how to run down you know right they're gonna eat dinner with a sheep at all you're dealing with a goat that's right folks that know how to defend themselves you know right there they're not truly surrendered sheep to God well I should have had brother Matt to preach the nice my notice this they the sheep themselves need strong leadership now you'll find out one of these days if you don't know it already that the thing that some of you despise in strong leaders has been some of the very things that has kept your soul from Hale it has kept our church from many things that other churches deal with because of a strong leader and if you could have changed me and changed other men that we've had no doubts some of the very things you would have changed you'll find out in time has been the very things that God has used to keep us from a lot of trash so if you would have manipulated me or manipulated the men that have come in here or the associate men the here you'll find out that some of the things that we you would have desired to change was the very things that have kept you and your family from going through a lot of things that other folks have went through and if God would have granted you what you thought was your best you would have been cutting your head off that's right now Paul recognized of course that these wolves would be the enemy of the fog and we know that the Lord established this new saying what's he called the church and was so beloved eeeh and because he loved it so much that made it an absolute enemy for Satan himself anything that God loves Satan hates anything that God calls by the tail term of endearment as beloved now a person can be loved of God but it isn't the same as being beloved of God we know that the Lord had 12 disciples and he had other preachers that went along with him but we know that out of those 12 that he had three that were very special praise the Lord now I add 12 us were called apostles but he had three which were very special to him no doubt those three carried a great load because you know how people are they're always jealous if they think somebody has some loco sort of Jesus and they aren't or little closer to the pastor so Jesus had Peter James and John he never took Bartholomew and ever took Matthew he never took a lot these other guys up to experience the great experiences with him Peter James and John three out of the twelve and then John was even more beloved it appears than the other two were now do you think Jesus had that kind of relationship well if you know your Bible you know that he did well it all sewn comes that was the most types of relationship many people envy that from people because they see special something that God gives certain ones whether it's a preacher or a singer a musician a song leader and they have a special touch others will envy that they almost despise that and they want that so much but if they only knew the consequences that come was being in that position now Paul was that type of a man he was called by God yet special revelatory position that God gave him special understanding about mercy grace the law of the types of shadows the Gentiles that none of the rest of the brothers had none of them absolutely none of them in the New Testament walked in the sphere that Paul did but yet the man went through more than many of the other apostles put together because with that comes a great tremendous price then on the other hand Satan and his demons also they measure these men of God the same way now you've heard me said on many many times and I'll probably continue to say so I not only want to have a testimony among you and among my contemporaries and my brothers that I minister with in the message but I want my testimony to reign beyond these four walls I want it to ring beyond just my friends by the 10 brother my price for the wrong Spencer or you know all these brothers I want it to go beyond that I wanted also to ring down inhale now I know that Satan does not like any of us if we're sons and daughters of God is that true but you can also watch the opposition that men of God give a preacher I don't care how great people think he is if the devil don't give him much flack that tells me a lot about the man if that man is really called of God and chosen of God and really accomplishing as much as he lets on that he is you better believe he'll hates that man it's the same with any Christian whether it's a man woman boy or girl they might Myles and say there this and there that in the other you know talk is cheap but if Satan pretty much does not bother them and most of their trials self-inflicted if I was you I'd watch that person because more than likely there are a whole lot of hot air and not a whole lot else that goes with it and it's the same way in every ministry that God calls you don't just look at how many people's following the manga don't look at well they've got so many contacts from this side all that really doesn't have any relevance when it comes to how demons fear the individual but you watch the church who watched the man you watch the people that absolutely Satan hates them and that will give you a pretty good idea of how their testimony reflects down in the pits of darkness which lead to me has a great relevance and how God looks at that individual now no doubt was Paul Peter was hated James was hated all the rest the Apostles were hated but can you imagine how this man was hated this man had such an insight on predestination Peter couldn't even touch it James couldn't even touch Paul's understanding of the election and the predestination of God he wrote about election and predestination in the mystery of the bride and the mystery of God he wrote things that even Simon Peter himself said our beloved brother Paul writes Saints it's hard to be understood you imagine Peter sitting down reading Timothy and reading Titus and reading Philemon and Philippians and first and second Corinthians and Ephesians tehsil and I couldn't know through the Thessalonians rather and Timothy and all that and Peter just shaken he something and where did he get this understanding my goodness what great revelation this brother had praise the Lord so you know then also in hell this whenever they knew that this man was under the Roman why they was watching him to bring him to Rome they let him go for a season they reached him again you imagine that the demons down in hell were waiting for the day when this man's life could be taken from it no no no they was thinking in a multiplied form that if this man stops the revelation oh stop if he stops the clear understanding will stop if he stops it will give us more leeway into the flock because looking at it in a total different way than the sheep are looking at the cheaper thing oh my poles gone we'll have no more letters than and we'll get no more of his great understanding which is true but yeah the demons were looking at it in a total total different perspective because this gift was so strong it was so powerful oma and whenever they would do things others you know others said come against others they wouldn't say a whole lot they wouldn't do a whole lot whole even the beloved John got so pressed that even calls somebody's name on time and John had went into a bathhouse now remember John was the disciple of Lord so on and the societal of that don't cause people's name in public does so yeah John did he called a man's name in the name of dr. fees John went into a public bathhouse and he found out there's a false teacher in there and he said may God give us mercy to bring the others bathhouse for it falls down on us the disciple of love you see friends folks don't understand love they find love it's a little tea detail oh the little Ginny can agree love can be a kitty cat but love can also be a full-grown black mane lion [Applause] [Music] but people want a passer that's a beauty communicator Camellia patches [Applause] now when Paul was riding where Luke was riding actually what Paul was saying he wanted to identify what's going to come against the church now if God has got pastors Satan's going to have them if God's got your apostles Satan's going to happen everything that God has Satan's gonna have some that'll mimic what God has so God's got a true pastor Satan Ohio false pastors now they won't stand up and draw pentagrams on the wall take a golden slice of goats neck and say oh we're doing this in the name of the Lord Jesus no no that wouldn't scare anybody well it would scare people but that would never deceive anybody end up believing this man is leading them deeper into the riches of Christ so what do you send up do we believe in the cross we believe in mercy we believe in salvation we believe in Christ Christ Christ Christ well folks so scared to death the name of the Lord Jesus never knows how many denominations were preachers it's always Christ Christ Christ Christ what's wrong with the name Jesus the angel said thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall save his people from their sins now if Satan is going to mimic what God has God has two teachers Satan has false teachers God has true prophets God has Satan had goddess true ones God has true ones Satanists fossils but he'll try to do this he'll try to convince you Satan's false ones are the true ones and God's true ones other fossils and both of them are pointer fingers the other and say that house where the truant and they'll both use the quote to say don't gonna bring the press against us they're bringing the press against us and they're saying no no the ones ready to give something you're saying who's who what's not so much it's done that way on purpose to confuse you now don't misunderstand it the true leaders know they are true leaders the false leaders know they are false so the whole scheme is not to convince to true that they're true or to convince the false that they're false the whole scheme is to try to confuse you of who's true and false [Applause] that's where you got to have the Holy Ghost having the message on your phone is not your seal bless God I'll tell you one thing I'll go in and I'll type in the message that's well and good and I did nearly every day of my life but you can still be deceived by having the message half on your fault you're not see or by having the message that you're not see or by listen to tapes you're not sealed by coming to church you're sealed by the Holy Ghost oh my notice this Jesus in Matthew chapter 7 verse 15 he himself sets this force of course before even mentions about the founding of the church beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves beware of notice now what they are they're not witches they're not wizards they're false prophets so what will they be doing they will be acting like to prophesy that's what a prophet does well praise the Lord [Applause] Amy and they'll come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly so you can look at them on the outside and they'll look the part and talked apart but inwardly they're a wolf on the inside you shall know them by their ah two men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles so you won't know him by their shout you won't know much just ability to quote the word or the message but what's the fruit of their life and the Prophet also tells us the fruit is their teaching so what do they teach is the Sun the summation of all their teaching is that how great they are how gifted they are how wonderful they are and how do you need them so desperately or is it about you and Christ and the church and the millennium and what he's trying to do or does it always come back to them one of the first signs of a false prophet and the second one is if you don't hear him who try to scare you to death now I'll tell you one thing so-and-so wouldn't listen to me and a tree fell on so-and-so I'll tell you one thing they didn't listen the man their car run off the road so-and-so I'll tell your friends should not believe how many times I've been approached for such stuff people trying to scare me you forgot I was in Pentecost for many years I was in Pentecost and would see men call people out I had a man to call me out one day and tell me what I prayed that day word for word and a woman come up in the unbuttoned her blouse and stuck his hand in on her breast don't come to me with your isms and your feelings your Quivers and your shakes [Applause] raise the Lord well well no the second Peter chapter 2 verse 1 but there were false prophets which were among the people talking about the children of Israel even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bringing upon themselves Swift destruction and many this is the sad horn and many shall follow their pernicious ways why because she can be easily deceived well I didn't get many amens on that and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of so these guys will actually come in and they will deny the Lord God that bought them Jesus and they will begin to speak evil of the way of truth and sometimes genuine sincere people will follow them and they'll actually leave a true pastor a true prophets message and follow a false prophet praise the Lord is this the truth absolutely notice Paul again acts 20:29 for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock I notice it's not that the false prophets are just gathering goats they're actually affecting sheep there's not a person sitting in this place than that no matter how predestinate you're and how elected you are that has not been deceived one time another in your life some of you made it be deceived about something tonight about something that you believe or somebody you've got such confidence in or whatever more but it doesn't if you've got to hold a ghost you won't stay deceived he will straighten me out that's right now so these type of people they're not interested in the unity of the flock they're not interested in the unison of the body they are interested in fleecing the flock and said have actually take care of the flock so they are Pharisees under the pretense Jesus rebuked him sharply when he was here and rebuked him for you know taking advantage of the widows and of the poor and he said you stand there you Pharisees and you will not go in the gate yourself and you won't let others go in and yet you're saying you're really sincere love God notice this in verse 30 now Paul is going to categorize these groups also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them now there's always be a two-fold type of saying to crises of the coming enemy and one of them is what men of your own self so this will be men of your own ranks men of your own message can we say of the same move the same mother the same doctrine theoretically they'll start out with the same doctor but the problem is to have two different fathers you see it's coming back to the thing as it was in the Garden of Eden it's Eve again I said it's Eve again Eve had the potential I've given birth to Cain Abel but Adam could only father Abel Eve could give verse to both praise the Lord the prophet messenger did not bring to us a message from God which was mixed up with denominational a carrion he brought to us the word but as the church we had the potential as the female of giving birth to most Cain and Abel it's your choice oh ma praise the Lord now these are very difficult times we know that but we also know that we're not the only ones to deal with such things these type of people are actually bred in the very community of the church itself so they will be men that will come among you and they may sit there for years they may set under the auspices of the message of the hour and then all of a sudden of sight their software kicks in and they start displaying their agenda now may I say this tonight my little brother Darrel brother the West but the Terry all the recipes minister brothers here but as much as I love brother Darrell if I ever saw brother Darrell raised up in this church and try to start a split in this church I'll call his name out I'll rebuke him and he knows me well enough to know I will brother horn I'm warning you buddy by the last some warning letter gene [Music] oh you scared for your position no I'm watching over a flock a flock this is my heart ah my position and you think this is the only place I converge I've got more invitations in the last 10 years and I've had in decades in my life if I accept that every invitation I'd you'd never see me for six months but I don't what I want I'm going to don't worry this is my heart right here this is my burden which should be with every true God commented Sebastian so in that this is where Paul takes this disincentive and he says that there will be some that will come up from your own community and they will make a prey of the flaw they will actually make themselves fat on the on the necessities of setting around there but the whole thing is to promote themselves to sources of apostasy that will try to invade you one from within and one from without and they will be diverse why because the sheep are diverse some sheep would never follow you know we could call men's names or certain doctrines or whatever more but they would never follow a certain certain move or orchestrated or began by a certain man it just would have no appeals to them but other things will come around that do you know if they're very quiet and way back and they're not very you know Pentecostal this would say more than likely a real Pentecostal God that would come in around the message and try to pull people off to follow him no simcha people will never listen to him because that's of the way their nature but if their nature more scholarly and lore you know they really like deep so-called stuff Noah that'll be the thing then Satan will have won exactly for the palate of their taste and that's a whole mob never heard such preaching in my life no Lorelai this this is unbelievable this is the only man and the message you know right there when they say that you better get away from it this is not a one-man message in the sense of one pastor and one evangelist I agree one man brought this message one prophet of God brought this message but it is no longer one man one pastor one grade of engine Asst that the bride is flopping around it is a ministry that God has around the world OMA right that's why I rebuke you they try to do that to me don't do that whether you come to church or whether you stream the service don't get that devil on you to think our church and I'm this and that we're nothing only by the grace of God are we even saved tonight him feel where the Holy Ghost and can see life don't never make nothing out of me or no other man Jesus is the great one among us all the rest of us are servants what's this in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse 13 Paul says for such are false apostles deceitful workers you see these guys are not all preachers but they're workers that get among the people like maggots on a gut wagon and they work oh boy they work well if God's got good workers Satan's got deceitful workers he ain't just impersonating preachers you've got good workers and her church that are good and you've got some that stick their nose and everybody else's business we don't believe in Deaconess this year at the church but we've got something even though they're not ordained well thank you Jesus come out or - hold on some of them invitations I might be needing them uh Hector tonight for such are false apostles deceitful workers friends you think this is not powerful transforming themselves into transforming themselves by the way you mean they have a power and ability to change themselves to transform themselves when they're evil too rotten their kingdom builders but they had the ability to transform themselves as if though they are so sincere so genuine who said scares away well that's the negative side to transforming power but the good part is if they've got the power to transform themselves into that you ain't gonna tell me you ain't got the power to transform yourself into it's a love God that can live an overcoming victorious life if they can do that for their friend for false pretense for error then cannot lead by the divine impartation of eternal life let God transform us into creatures that reflect his glory [Applause] notice in verse 14 the high parallels these guys and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of darkness really Wow now Satan really wanted to deceive you he would never appear to you the way he did to me when I was a young Pentecostal preacher laying upstairs and that brothers at room at builders from upstairs where I was sleeping by myself after I preached war out drove several days preached come heroin with me the Intel was at home for whatever reason I'm so tired that night I just exhausted but in the early way hours of the morning brother Wesley I felt something shaped my bed and it was enough to where it woke me up so I just kind of turned around and as I stood as I laid there rather I've seen this creature about 6 foot tall draped in black standing at the foot of my bed and he took his body and bumped against that bed and the headboard hit the wall well when I saw that I didn't have time to pick up the phone and dial nine-one-one I called somebody close to the 9-1-1 I got up in their bed I started coming up keeping my eyes right on him but the lane again he'd come right against the bed and the headboard hit the wall and he spoke to me out of there and said I've come took his finger like this long finger with his thumb stretched out just like this I've come to take your life low gravely terrifying voice I've come to take your life so I took my hands and push myself up in the bed a little bit higher on now I'm almost looking at him straight on and now he comes and he bumps right against the bed and he's pushing the bed against the wall like that and he said it again I've come to take your life well I wasn't in the message then don't don't be mad don't misunderstand me but I met Jesus for a header row Brenham I met Jesus forever listen to it take that's a lot of folks problem they come to the message to that ever meeting Jesus first all my goodness we witness to him and bring him from the Baptist Church of the Methodist Church of the Church of Christ and we simply change their doctor and we never produce a word verse and abemolik I for I knew enough about the word to know that is the son of God I had authority over devils and I ain't lost that knowledge so I raised up in the bed I thought big boy if you're gonna point your finger to me I'm gonna point mine back at you so I'm pointing my finger back at him and I said I rebuke you in the name of Jesus he stood right there and just to taunt me at the bed again I said did you hear me I rebuke you in the name of Jesus go back to Hell where you come from God being my witness I'll answer for it the day of judgment I saw this being as a head come back into this into this cape that it was dressed in and he backed up not taking his eyes off he took his hand down like this shaking glory to God and he backed off and he backed into the darkness there tell me how that happened the darkness I have no idea cuz there's a window right behind him the darkness was so black where he was but you know what he wasn't comin trying to deceive me that's really who he is but if he was coming trying to deceive me with the doctrine or a theory he had never appeared like this he'd never come that way because I'd say I rebuke you in the name of Jesus so what will he do he'll come dressed up like an angel or dressed up with this quote on in this scripture that's cut up and hacked up come on children he'll never come to you like that for trying to deceive you but when he comes to deceive you he puts on those wings on his back and you fly around for you and say yay as God said [Applause] well praise the Lord Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if Satan has preachers their acts even called his aren't you glad you ain't one of the whom truth if it is better he wouldn't any more than us hey Widmore aren't you glad aren't you guys aren't you go ahead he wouldn't want you the way you are say yeah devil come on answer I don't want you the way you are ain't nobody you tie up hell you wouldn't be down you're two hours you'd be preaching Hellfire and brimstone you'd be preaching infection hide oh won't you that's right he don't want us and we don't want him so what's he trying to do torment us and aggravators and everything in the world can do I'm glad Satan hates me because the feelings are totally mutual [Applause] therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness praise God for the message praise God for Malachi 4 oh thank God for sending us a prophet but of course we all know that prophet you know he only preached part Revelation and you know when he had his dream hit only went two-thirds of the way and brother Ram could only lead us two-thirds of the way and the other third has a row you need to be on Dollywood or Hollywood or someone like that we got no room for you come out Church what they do so there are always laying it out brother Branham was a good man why he had so many wonderful things to say but AHA goat so they transform themselves so they say the prophets and to us with it he believed the message new it's a shame how gullible we are well praise the Lord galatians chapter 2 verse 3 but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren so i got false pastures false preachers false apostles false teachers false workers and i got false brothers how you doing brother hey i don't brother i doing such that so won't just try to come in from the ministry level it'll come from every level in the body false brethren unawares unawares brought in my question about this verse is wonder who brought them sometimes good sincere people are trying to add to our church try to add to the flock of God and if you're not later the Holy Ghost you will be bringing in a false yeah a false brother that'll set in among us and because of your zeal not no knowledge but you'll see oh you are inviting pale mamas well hallelujah my Bible tells me the Lord had it dated to the church such as should be saved no friends this is not I'm Way or Avon we're not going around not well why don't you out get out you do a community outreach we are the community outreach well why don't you set up a booth i Gert the grey Fairgrounds a face on my face that throw me under the fairgrounds we're not selling pumpkins we're not giving away watermelons this is the gospel oh man that because the false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage so they come in as spies so if somebody come in here tonight and they wanted to be a spy among us and this dress like Bozo the Clown now would you think they were very inconspicuous what if they come in looking like on the head on a Carter County Jail outfit what color they aren't orange or something like that and they had on a change you know chains on their legs and chains on their arms and I mean this has hi for the church that said over here we're brother Wayne is this high for the church at empty out they said lord have mercy a convicts got out somebody called the police call it but that's not very keen speakers but what if somebody come in and they dress like everybody else they look like everybody else on this had a man ever now and they want a book and they want a table as a whole we've got to convert happily or I'll be babying a serpent brother don't you say we shouldn't speak to people I'm saying you should speak to those the Holy Ghost leads you to and not your own zeal oh my good to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you you believe Paul had love recipes what do you think he had but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it make us no matter to me whew rough sort of a guy wasn't he God accepteth no man's person does happy Valley Church believe them no matter what your last name is first name is middle name is Bo they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me Philippians chapter 3 verse 2 this is this love as it oozes out of this man's heart beware of dogs these ain't poodles Rottweilers and pit bulls look at the word dog on a man of impure mind an impudent man you mean to tell me a man whose heart was full of love referred to people people ass dog huh now what's cool if you go to now they should have never taught him in that Theological Cemetery I mean the seminary he must have missed that day that's what it was he had to flume he was out that whole week on pulpit manners on how to rebuke people in such a way that they don't even know you're doing it that your Sojin to you and you're so loving that you're just like a honey in the honeycomb it just oozes out of you and when people are done they can't even hardly get to the car they're covered in gooey honey and molasses and they stick to the steering wheel and they gotta be pried out of the front seat when they go to the car because your pastor is just so chocolaty and butterscotchy and marshmallowy that sounds yucky beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision now you know to us a dog that doesn't mean at all what it did to these folks the dog was a reproachful term designating arrogant and dangerous men so if a man raises up in this church or raises up in the message and I would refer to him as a dog would I be considered to be a word preacher by most people who say they believe this word and believe the Bible and believe the message no I would why because people are ignorant our senses are becoming Laodicea Thais tolerance tolerance tolerance tolerant you think it's not affecting you but it is it's affecting you every day we hear it tolerance tolerance and I get sick of hearing it because I want to tolerate everybody about us they want to tolerate everybody for do anything they want to do but they have no tolerance for choice [Applause] so you see unlike today where people would have all kinds of dogs if you have dogs I'm not against it if you have dogs in your house I'm not against it but you have to take this mindset of what this was written in the way they thought about it and this day dogs mainly wandered the streets they were not in people's homes they wandered the streets without a master [Music] so when Paul compared people to those he said you can't come subject you don't have a master you're here and you're there and you're somewhere else and you're ravenous and you rip and tear and you can't be subject you do understand what dogs hate you understand Purina what's not terrible and Paul wrote this there was no job shall you do understand what they ate you don't corpses they hung around crucified bodies and this being a rocky place when they would dig them in the in the graves many of them couldn't afford a great tumor of the frame so they dig very shallow graves and the dogs would follow the funeral procession and they would dig up Uncle Joe and eat Uncle Joe so Paul said you men you can't be controlled you can't be taught you can't be brought subject and you're feeding on a dead carcass you know send friends when you're feeding on yourself your pride your vanity how wonderful how great oh my you're the greatest singer in the message you're the greatest songwriter in the message you're the greatest preacher oh that ain't nobody the message can play the organ like you're the guitar like you or whatever more you understand what you're doing you are feeding on your dead corpse [Applause] malignant dissatisfied beware of dogs beware of evil workers teachers who endeavor to pervert the gospel and of the concision and you know preachers can be sarcastic they can be extremists when they preach this is what Paul is actually doing here the word concision is katha Tomi which is to cut up or to mutilate so he's using a sarcastic term to refer to the Jews which are emphasizing circumcision circumcision was an act given by God a holy righteous thing for thousands of years but now God had moved beyond it as a sign of the seal in your flesh and Paul refers to as somebody cutting themselves and just move mutilating themselves come on now why because when God moved out of it that's what it becomes Lord of Mercy children can't you see with the move of John Smith and the Lord moved in the Baptist Church it was a great move of God and when they made an organization God moved right Oliver God moved out of the Methodist Church them for the message people that refused to go on with a move of God God will move right out of their message churches their message people and move right over the bride will be no more than any other denomination or name [Applause] oh my goodness Oh Lord Jesus let me give you the meaning of this word that Peter refers to here again second Peter chapter 2 verse 2 to skip verse 1 but they and many shall follow their pernicious ways pernicious is damnable other destruction of perishing ruin in verse 3 says through covetousness shall they with feigned words molded formed as from clay wax or stone so they take their words and they move and they cut them and they shaped them and they put their words together to try to make you believe Allah so you'll be damned now notice what they will do then with their feigned words they will make merchandise of you whose judgment now the longtime linguist not and their damnation I wonder if folks would allow this Prichard here Peter what if he'd be allowed to come preach these big fine faint sea churches around here what if that lamb come up to the First Baptist I reckon he could go downtown Kingsport and all them big nice churches down in Church circle they can Peter be invited one of the suckers resume I walked with the Lord Jesus I've walked on water only man in history that's ever done I failed but it didn't walk on for a while I was with him when he raised up I've done this and that in the other son I couldn't water resume of a guy who is this guy Peter oh lord have mercy your motto to read first things first and second Peter for you said you wanted his pulpit cuz whenever he went down he believed that if you raise the wrecks you'll believe the same thing so Peter come in you're denied you saying I'm preaching hard I'm like a Cub Scout compared to what these guys will do you're you know Paul walked out walk down to Walmart in Elizabeth and tomorrow and went to Johnson City and then went to the Johnson City Mall tomorrow night lord have mercy not have him in jail by the weekend goddess chapter 1 verse 9 holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre sake one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are always laurs evil beasts slow bellies whoa this witness is true wherefore oh we've got to lay it aside there's these words wherefore can you condemn anybody well I can't condemn me anyone Who am I to say if a man wants to marry you perfect claimed the name of God [Applause] rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in face revelation 2 - I know thy works and thy labour in thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found their lives whoa geez in church age I know that they are there no this is now these apostles or rather who called themselves prophets and apostles and found that their lives oh that's pretty flat isn't it I'm not responsible for that he is he said they were liars but the Bible said try man and if there be a man among your spiritual or prophet or says here's how the Lord will make myself known to him I'll speak to him in visions and in dreams and if what he says comes to pass then then and then only this is what William Marion Branham said I don't care what somebody else said who has the same wife's name or if his last name is McGillicuddy or Bryant or a Reagan or nut makes no difference I said to me it makes no difference if they're not saying what the word said they're liars beasts iron Ellison if what he says comes to pass then hear it don't be afraid of him because I'm with him oh but here's the catch phrase but if it doesn't come to pass then don't hear he hasn't got my word then once he got alive from the devil see if it's his word it happens now they found out these fellers wasn't carrying on according to the Bible see that we're trying to get something else now let's try him that say they are apostles in or not and has found them life now that is a blunt statement thou has tried them who called themselves Oh apostle isn't that presumptuous what right has a people to try those who call themselves apostle how do they try them oh I love this here it is in Galatians 1 at 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be our curse it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people the original word could not change not even a dot or a dash now it's being said from headquarters if there's two types of fivefold ministries today there is a false fivefold ministry and there's a true faithful ministry and the true faithful ministry will play tapes I say that is damnable doctrine from Hale the Bible never taught that brother branham never taught that come on church don't get quite on me show me what brother Branham said it I'll come back this weekend and apologize praise the Lord praise the Lord you imagined by the random setting and her brother Neville and said brother never purchase things that sometimes absolutely astounds me he said I've heard purchase from all over the world and he said my brother never preaches it astounds me why didn't he rebuked him and say brother never why aren't you playing my tapes what are you doing you trying to get the people to follow you brother now you ain't supposed to say that but I am that don't go along with headquarters I got a different headquarters that's the problem my headquarters ain't in Jeffersonville all right ain't in Shreveport under the INA streets in in in Johnson City I get my orders from headquarters show me I'm a man who can be corrected show me or the prophet of God rebuked or shamed by the devil or any other picture show me what brother Branham had a line of preachers coming through and ordained their fingers you're at Liberty standing give me the page paragraph date charlie it is a seducing spirit I know you don't want to hear this tonight but you're gonna hear it anyhow and whether or not you want to accept and those of you that are streaming it is linked side-by-side by that do do you think to make a God out of William random and it is straight from the pits of hell you are doing brother branham's such a discredit he said to make me Jesus Christ is to make me Antichrist can you imagine what people are doing that you're actually making by the ban of Antichrist [Applause] don't you remember friend when he saw that dream and whenever he struck that snake that was that Oh deity spirit to start up and Canada and the tail come down to Georgia you only know the two men that is started down camel and ride down the gorge you understand where it come from and brother been instructed saying and what happened there crawl right off into the water and her brother told him let it go let it go to be alright when he turned back around that's they come to that that thing was so strong that he said it bit him but the blood was too rich [Applause] now one random blood random blood and except from that old deity devil one random blood you don't wanna be raking blood and I want to be Willis blood it's gonna be the blood of a like Jesus that'll keep us balanced in the Word of God and keep this deity thing away from us [Applause] Oh hallelujah praise God when you realize it you know that in the life stays for us to be able to hold our head above the fanaticism that will be around this message now tortured 1215 years ago one of the greatest things at the end time would refer you to be able to hang your head toward Christ and not be so ashamed to be identified with all the nonsense around the message or the RAM belt with a little bit of the nonsense that was here whenever he was here the friends it was nothing and now try to keep your shelter and keep a lot of this trash from you love me more speak enough stay in the word stay in the word I've told you the story time and time again I know but it comes on my heart several years ago when I was preaching down in Kentucky who still passed in there sister sisters had come to the church our name is Millie Burton good little o sang that godly woman she come up to me after one of the services there so but it aren't going to share a story I said yes sister Berta said she had a nephew that worked for the federal government looking and studying money this part was counterfeiting so I steadied and steadied and steadied so she inquired from him you know what do you do well we look you know we just I can't tell you everything we do but she said so what does it counterfeit $100 bill look like he said I've never seen she said never seen one he said no a male he said we study the truth the originals so much that if I ever see one I know it you can spend all of your time trying to go out and all these websites and straighten out all these people who've left a message or you can spend so much of your time feasting on the word enjoying the word you're just going on the Lord ladies on your heart to speak to some on it there maybe you can bring them back fine but many of you they feel like you're gonna bring them back oh I know I can do it I know I can do it it's a trap of the devil for you if you believe mr. Shepherd it's a trap of the devil for you do you see all these ministers going out here and doing all that you know why a lot of it it's a waste of time these people want to argue with you they want to debate with you then what to pull you into something or so a little bit of a doubt in your mind so you go over to this website well what about this and what about that and what about that you can't prove this and you came through then said I don't know why so all this stuff in your mind why not spend time studying the original you'll never find me a quote or a scripture or the Holy Ghost feeds on false doctrine the Holy Ghost feeds on the word praise God don't you love them at all your heart may God keep us may God protect us we've had things come and go since I've been here as you pass through and brother Phillips to share as your pastor years ago and whoever mole wherever you've come from you know we're never going to be exempt from church troubles never you got too many targets here every individual from this pulpit back to the nurseries every individual here is a potential instrument to cause trouble in this church why would Satan not want to come in here you've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people there can be a potential instrument just sow discord let two young people in the church getting a spat don't think it's just about that boy and his friend Satan's got a bigger target in the matter mind he wants to get their moms and dads involved and then the grandparents involved and then their closest friends involved and then and ultimately you know where he wants to go to right here but the horn told me the other day that vertigo they say can be caused by stress told me that in the office and I said I don't know why I would be straight that deer in the headlight look you know me a stress-free life my friends what he hates truce and he hates promoters after the jesus said it well on this robbery i will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it aren't you glad you're part of that go ahead and hit in the head he's worth it this our heads together god bless you lord I imagine it Peter and Paul James even Luke as they wrote basically the three main writers of the New Testament it must have been so sad for them to have to take up space and the Holy Writ to write of discord and trouble and false prophets and false apostles and false workers but yet they felt it was needful they couldn't just write about the good things that was going on in the church they also needed to write about the difficulty and the hardships of the trouble it's the same in our message Lord it would be nice we could just stand up and just constantly deal with this mystery in that mystery and go from one great great thing into another but in reality services aren't two-niner just a simple sometimes even more so that we Heavenly Father can be alarmed and Paul I'm not sure if the counter D but and this one verse he said the word beware three times in that short voice verse beware beware beware I don't think that was just for that day but I believe it's for this day as well help us Lord Jesus may our hearts always be so sensitive to the Holy Ghost each of us just find our place and be what you've made us to be and be happy I know it'll be one of the greatest achievements of the elect down through the ages is to be satisfied with the predestinated allotment that you've given to us in reality that's what led Eve to her fall the serpent to his fall Satan to his fall on and on and on and on talking people out of their position offering them a higher one than their called to do and then they fall Lord if we could only find what you've made us and be happy for Aaron help us Lord Jesus help us not to be satisfied for less than what you've made us or constantly reaching for more but to find exactly what you've made us and I love the way the Prophet deals with it whenever they ask him in question answers how can a person find the will of God and find what they're supposed to be doing and he answers it in such simplistic terms generally a person's position is known something like this he says about whether they can do it or not so if a person claims are called to preach and they can't preach after 30 years they ought to accept the fact a person who claims are called to do whatever be a sunday-school teacher be a deacon be whatever they're thinking they're called to be if you did not gift them with the ability to do it then apparently they've misunderstood something even people who get involved in the church workers in the church that try to straighten out this and straighten out that and wind up making a bigger mess and what the mess was before Lord made they begin to look up about and realize maybe I'm not called to do this what a great revelation it'll be for all of us when we can find that spot and we're just happy we're just happy being what you've made us a lot of the jealousy will subside the anxiety the pressure that we feel of trying to sing like this one or preach like that one or jump like that one or shout like that one would just be what you've made us to be and go on lord help us out pray father Lord may you speak to every heart here tonight and those it has trained this service may our ears be open to the Holy Ghost and Lord when we go to hear a sheep looking wolf though it may smell like a sheep though initially it may be like a sheep but when that inside of the inside goes to speaking the main motive and objective may the Holy Ghost within us recognize the voice of a wolf well that's a preacher or a lay member or a gossiper or whoever it is wolves ain't just preachers sometimes it can be a woman that seems so humble and ain't nothing but a busybody just meddling and meddling into one thing into another her name's attached to fifty seven things going on the church at the same time help us lord help us to realize we are not rapture ready when we are doing such things and we are not rapture ready when we are listening to such things it proves we're not being led of the Holy Ghost help us Lord God we love you Jesus with all of our hearts I thank you for this service tonight Lord it's your word I know it's not the part I enjoy preaching you know you know when I get done tonight already I'm feeling it Lord I'll be lowering a
