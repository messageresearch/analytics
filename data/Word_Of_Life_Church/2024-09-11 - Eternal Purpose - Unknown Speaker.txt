ahead brother Bobby this makes me God's grace does for us um as many of you know I was diagnosed with therosis of the liver and a 10 cm Mass on the right side of the liver this was in about May of 2022 we had took a family trip to the Ark in Kentucky and I became very sick and while I was there I broke out in a rash that covered about 80% of my body my temperature was high I made it back home and went to the emergency room and they thought they titled it maybe a boil skin disease uh I I just looked like I'd been boiled in oil that's how my whole body looked and uh they didn't know what to do for me uh they sent me home then it escalated till I was hospitalized and they found out out it was a rare form of sasis and it only happens in random cases uh Mayo Clinic has treated two cases of it and the rest the doctor said it most doctors had never seen it on a human it was only in textbooks that they had saw it so God brought me through that but in the meantime I was uh began to swell in my abdomen and they had uh the doctors had done MRI and they determined I had therosis but I had to go in for a parenthesis and they had taken actually nine and a half 2 lers of fluid from me so I went on for a little while the fluid began to gather again and usually when this happens you're not too far from the end is what they say sometimes so but I was trusting God so I go back again they take 8 and 1/2 2 L again then my right lung filled and they took a one L of fluid out of my right lung I sat and watched them draw it out into something like a coke bottle I was uh 6 years old and we had a chance to go to brother braham's meetings in Chicago Ohio in 1960 and we we were there for five nights and two things that I remembered we were in a Pentecostal Church growing up there was a lady that they requested prayer for her name was Polly Reed and she she was in Middletown Ohio and you'll hear it on the tape it is I Be not Afraid we our family was setting two rows of seats from her when brother bam called her out he said that light was circling over there it landed first on a lady beside of her then it moved over to her and he told her he said you have a hole in your heart and you're going to die well we had just heard that testimony about 3 weeks before that in our hometown Church in Virginia never did we believe that we would see that lady so she was healed immediately I'm giving you this background to to try to encourage you with faith uh on the night he preached the reject the king there was a lady laying across from me on a stretcher and she looked like the great niece of Florence Nightingale she was Skin and Bones she's able to barely raise her hand up off the cot brother R's getting ready to leave the platform and he turned back and looked in our Direction he said what was that past me he said that wasn't an uler he said that was a cancer devil well he immediately prayed for her and I saw her with my own eyes get up off that cot and Shout to the glory of God I whispered to my mother I said how is she standing on those legs or nothing but broomsticks but she did that was a platform for for the faith that I I got when this when I got this diagnosis so I go to the doctor and they say well you got the therosis you got a 10 cm Mass it's possibly cancer first wanted to do surgery maybe a transplant then they come back and said you don't qualify for either so I said you you giv me no hope medically they said no I said well I've got a high power that has the final answer so I would not take any drugs any chemo uh they they actually got mad at me because I wouldn't go the route they wanted me to go but seeing this from my childhood I knew God was the same yesterday today and forever and I have testified that to many of these brothers they can tell you that I've said that after saying this as a young boy that God was the same and he still is I don't care what you're going through what you've been diagnosed with you don't have fear and you get up every day and you testify you thank God for healing you that's what I did and I'm still standing here today they did a MRI and a again about a year ago the doctor three months ago said well you know you've got cancer don't you I said well that's what they say I never have said I have this or I don't have it I said they say I have it but I'm not testifying to that so they don't you know they couldn't couldn't hardly grasp that so but anyway uh I was uh recovering doing better and I was on a platform on Wednesday night playing the guitar but I still very weak in my body I was hardly able to walk brother Daryl had prayed for his last person here and uh I I wanted to get up and go down but I was too weak I didn't think I could get back up if I did so I said God I saw this as a child I said I don't have to go to him you can send him to me that was the very words I said in my heart he prayed for the last person I was sitting here in the old church he put his coat across his arm he walked toward me and he turned around looked at me like he had never seen me before he walked straight to me and started praying for me from that time on my health started turning and by the grace of God I'm standing here today and can give you this testimony no matter what the devil tells you don't accept it it's it's not the final answer he's a blood and go go about your life brother BR said go about your life and don't fear I had no fear I can honestly say with my hand over my heart when they told me the diagnosis I walked through the valley of the shadow of death but I had no fear because I knew if he he took care of me all the rest of my life he could do it this time that's right so brothers and sisters no matter what he tells you don't fear it brother Ram said do not fear it and you go about your life and you sing and you give God praise and you thank him every day for what he's done and you will see the results God bless you I think brother Bobby could say that he doesn't regret one mile that he's traveled for the Lord and that right there is why because if he didn't believe in him he could have left him there to die but instead he healed him and there he is amen let's sing this old song I don't regret one mile I've traveled for the Lord and I don't re ret one time I trusted in his words I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m that I traveled for the Lord let's sing it one more time oh I don't regret one m i Trav for the Lord and I don't regret one time I've trusted in his word I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret one m I traveled for the Lord no oh I don't regret [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] D for the you can say Amen to that can't you brother Jackie seemed like I was uh well I was just a a young boy and the Lord spoke to me down on the river that day and told me to preach then he spoke to me told me when I turned 30 I'd start traveling and so when I turned 30 I got an invitation down into South Carolina and that kind of got me traveling and then I traveled for years and worked 40 hours a week and I come home sometimes 3 4:00 in the morning and sat in the chair for a little bit and throw water in my face and go to work then in June of 2000 I was coming back from lunch going back to surgery come around the corner of a hallway there at the VA hospital and just walked right into the presence of the Lord he was just hanging there and I just begin to weep a voice spoke to me and said go preach my word so in 2000 I went fulltime and 24 years later I don't regret a mile that I've traveled for the Lord amen he's he's been so good for all of us and that's what we want to look at tonight is to know that none of us are here by accident but there's a purpose for all of us if you have your Bibles turn with us tonight to the book of Ephesians want to read from Ephesians chapter 3 verse 11 and brother Justin talking about 911 as we remember that that day and he was right he was at our house was having a little birthday party for Carissa and Allison uh the day that that happened and I guess everybody remembers where they was at when they got news of that that terrible day but amen Ephesians 3 we just want to read one verse there of verse 11 trust something to be said tonight to help you to encourage you that's truly the reason that we came and I don't uh know all that everybody here is facing or what you're going through with individually and how many needs would be here tonight but there's one thing that I do know is that there's not a need in the building that's greater than our God there's not one diagnosis that you've got that God wasn't aware of didn't take God by surprise it might have shocked you but not God he knew all about it can you believe that tonight he's got it all in control I said he's got it all in control Ephesians 3:11 the the Bible says this according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord now Eternal means without beginning and end that which always has been and always will be without beginning Without End never to cease Eternal may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight on God God's undefeatable Eternal purpose God's undefeatable Eternal purpose or if I could take a context out of that I'd like to say the man who wrote the book says I'm one of them Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to stand before your people we surrender this congregation and oursel into your hands For Your Glory may you come tonight Lord and speak Words of Life to our hearts and Lord may we not just be hearers of the word as James said but may we be doers of that which we've heard may we accept it believe it and confess it for we know that is the ABCs of our healing that is the ABCs of our walk dear God is to believe what you said in your word about us we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you may be S seated thank you buddy now I want to draw this first into your mind that there's not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing that could destroy us not one thing until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing the prophet said so then we come to understand this evening that we are made for a purpose you see this church here T night that we're in and we thank God for it it's such a such a beautiful building but this Foundation that was dug this building the roof and the interior and that was put in it was not just done all this wasn't just done to see if it could be done it was put here for a purpose your home that you was in before you come to church tonight was not just accidentally put there for somebody just wasting time where well we'll just see if we can build this no your home was made for a purpose your home was made to serve a purpose the automobile you drove here tonight was not made just to see if it could be made the material was not wasted by man it was made for a purpose to serve a purpose the clothing that you wear tonight was not just to see if somebody could design or fashion a piece of clothing no it was put for a purpose the food that you eat was not grown on the earth just to see if it could be grown but the food that we eat was grown to serve a purpose amen and God just not uh just didn't just happen to be making a tree just to be making a tree but he made a tree for a purpose and I want to say tonight that God made you not just to see if he could do it but God Made You for a purpose amen therefore there is a purpose for all of us being here we're not here here just to be another human being but we are here because God made you for some purpose we W just put here to eat the food that God grow we're not just put here to live in a house that some man made or or to drive an automobile that somebody created or wear clothes that somebody fashion but we are here for a specific purpose the trees God didn't have to make trees the way he made them but he made the trees for a purpose though they're different from one another yet he made each tree for a purpose purpose he could have make trees any way he wanted to make them he could have made flowers any way he wanted to make flowers but he made all of them the trees and the flowers everything he made for a purpose and what was that purpose to give a witness to give a testimony oh think about that he just didn't make a tree to be making it but he made a tree for a purpose that it would be a witness that it could give a testimony some people well that's just a tree but to God it's a witness it's a testimony he made them to Bear witness for they are God's Witnesses they are a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right the very trees that God placed upon the Earth will condemn some of these false religions for the trees the that God himself created serve a purpose to give a witness that Jesus Christ is right the death burial and Resurrection gives a witness that we are not dead eternally but we shall live again amen it shows a supreme intelligence look at the sun the prophet said when it comes out in the morning what's what happens to the sun it's a little baby born in the East about 10:00 it's a teenager at noon time it's in its strength in the evening time it's middle aged and at the evening time it's gone it's set it's finished but is that all there is of the sun no God's got a purpose for the Sun so the Sun comes back and rises again what does it what does it speak of it speaks of a birth a life a death and a resurrection Hallelujah it goes to show that it was made by a supreme intelligence to serve a purpose it's here for a purpose and I say tonight if that's true for for a flower if that's true for a tree if that's true for the sun then what about you what about you do you think we just accidentally fell into this thing you think God just accidentally created us I tell you no as the tree has a purpose and the flower has a purpose and the sun has a purpose to give a witness to be a testimony God has created you Hallelujah to be a witness no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you're here to serve a purpose it don't matter how old you are how young you are every person here was here for a purpose to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose and the nail on my finger is here for a purpose my eye and every part of my body is here for a purpose sure this little finger maybe not look as much as the as the bless of my eye but it's still a part of my body and it serves a purpose and I need that nail on the little finger come on somebody well I'm not the eye I'm not the tongue I'm not the ear but I don't care if I'm just a little toe on the foot the last toe where that little crease touches the foot if that's who I am in the body I still am here to serve a purpose hallelujah amen my eye every part of my body is here to serve for purpose it was not put here just to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put here to serve its purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing nothing that can destroy us till God's purpose is fulfilled I make a Baptist shout I said there is nothing that can harm us until the purpose that God has put us here has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache we have how sorrow that we go through all these things are for a reason God is not the author of confusion and everything that happens in our life God has a purpose for allowing it to happen amen and no matter what we Face the sorrow the pain the disappointment the sickness the fear all the things that we face as human beings has not been put here to destroy us because our purpose Hallelujah cannot be defeated by the things we suffer Hallelujah Hallelujah no matter how much heartache no matter how much sorrow all these things are a reason there's a reason for it but nothing you face in life will defeat the purpose that God has brought for your life it's the undefeatable Eternal purpose of the almighty God oh Hallelujah God placed you here you didn't stagger into this thing he could have put us in Luther's day Wesley's day he could put us in the days of Paul he could put us in the days of Jesus we could have been one of the discipl I Les but he chose this age this time this season this place to place you here it was not by accident but God knew in the last day in this age of confusion and lies and all the distress and all the darkness he knew he could put you here because he knew you would believe him when he spoke amen hallelujah Nations a lie to you governments a lie to you family a lie to you come on somebody but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah and he knew he could have you here he could place you here and against all and against all darkness and against all confusion and against all denominations and against all internets somebody would believe his word and he said that's you I placed you here because I know you're the Seed of Abraham and Abraham's seed believes God when he speaks Hallelujah I'm not based well I got a sensation I'm not basing on a sensation I'm not basing it on the Goosebump I'm basing on thus sayth the word of God Sensations a lie to us emotions a lie come on somebody those things a lie to us but the word of God will never lie to us hallelujah well brother I want you to know I got it when you shouted no you got it when you believed that's right well Glory Hallelujah the undefeatable Eternal purpose of God God placed you here as a true witness of God that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ well brother Dar what's the answer to believe the sign what is the answer to believe the sign on Facebook and on the Internet it's you Hallelujah he put you here to be a true witness that all other religions is false and Jesus Christ is right think about it go with me for a few minutes in your mind before there was ever an angel a star a planet there was no air there was no life there was no stars there was no World there was nothing else it was God and God Alone Ella Ella Elohim which means the self-existing one there was nothing else existed but him and the self-existing one that we call God but before there was ever anything to worship him he was just a self-existing one and the self-existing one had a desire he had a purpose something that he wanted to achieve and he purposed within himself that he would do this thing and he spoke let there be light and there was like why he purposed it and the Darkness could not stop the light from coming forth because God's purpose can never be defeated amen hallelujah no matter how mysterious it may seem to be God always keeps his word God keeps his word if God makes a promise of anything God will keep that promise you and I make promises we intend to keep but things happen that we have to to break a promise but not God oh no he knows all the future from the beginning he don't make a promise unless he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise God Don't Make A Promise unless he knows it's going to unless he knows he's going to keep it unless he knows what's going to happen Hallelujah he will not make a promise unless he knows he's going to keep it other words God just don't say something to be sa if God says something he means it and if God says he'll do something he'll bankrupt all Heaven before he'll let that promise fail you God purposed within himself to prove his word he said I will prove my word to be the truth listen to me I don't believe God heals people just to show his power to heal that's not why God heals he heals to fulfill his word for the word says He Is A Healer amen he shows he fulfills his word he keeps his promise when he came here on the earth the first time he said that he did this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets listen to me all God's word must be fulfilled all of it all of it all of it God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing that can defeat it so how happy we all to be today are you happy y let your face know it come on somebody he's got it all in control oh brother darl you don't know what I'm going through with you don't know what I'm going through with but that don't matter that don't change God's program that don't change God's purpose that don't change God's plan he's still God he's still mov come on somebody he's got it all in control he's not lost his power he's not a do old Grand Pa sleeping somewhere God is on the throne amen how happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said Hallelujah God said let a virgin conceive and bring forth a child and it was as God said God said behold i s you Elijah before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it was as God said that's right God said there'll be a bride she'll be bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit and she is she is him and it is as God has said there will be a bride brother I reckon when she'll come she's here brother Bon said in 64 he said the bride is born in infancy the word is come forth through the end time friends we're at the end time in' 64 it was a bride in infancy but what's happened between 60 64 and 2024 the bride has come to maturity she's reached the age of love She's reached the season she can reproduce him again on the earth Hallelujah think of it the heavenly father do you think for one minute that the heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose even though Satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility he will not be defeated and he's given us perfect assurance that we will not have to be scared of anything amen what the father has purposed in your life can never be defeated the undefeatable eternal purpose of God for your life think about that you see what do you mean well think of David David was anointed by the great prophet Samuel to be king and between the ages of 10 and 15 year old who was 9' N9 in tall and saw the king that David no doubt looked up to he tells David you're just a youth you're too young you can't do it and Goliath has been a Warrior from his Youth and you're still a youth but the giant that stood before David did not see the God who was with David Hallelujah if he did he would have turned from the battle amen but God done said to David you will reign as king it came through a prophet's message God sent a prophet to tell David what his future was he might have preached future home to him come on somebody God sent a prophet to tell David not only what was happening right now but things that are to be and God told David through a prophet you will reign his King now how can he die by a giant as a boy and reign as king so David took God at his word and as far as the word was was concerned Goliath was defeated before the battle ever started because God's purpose for David's life could not be defeated by a giant and the giant that tries to R over your life cannot defeat God's purpose for your life amen you said brother darl I've got a giant raining in my life right now I've got this mountain as a boy told me Sunday down when he come up for gra me want me to pray for him he said I've got this mountain that needs to be moved but let me tell you no mountain can stand in the way of God's purpose for your life amen no jant no trial no habit no sickness no disease come on somebody there is nothing n o t h n nothing that can defeat God's purpose for our life it'll be as God has said it will be Shad M shako Flo into a furnace heated up seven times hotter than it ever been heated before and we said they said whether God would deliver us this we do not know but there's one thing we do know he is more than able to deliver us he's able to deliver us but nonetheless we will not bow to this image and the prophet said God had someone who would serve him and his purpose would not be defeated fire cannot defeat the purpose of God's plan and the prophet said how we left the say this morning all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church well brother Daryl you reckon Putin I don't care what Putin's going to do he ain't going to do nothing but what God allow him to do amen and if they push one button we'll be gone before it ever strikes the United States yeah all the bombs they have all the threats they have the imminent oh my yo everybody's looking for a donkey they're looking for Harris or they're looking for Trump to save this nation they believe in a donkey tell you this nation don't need a donkey nor an elephant it needs a lamb they rejected the thing that they [Applause] needed all the bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church all the explaining the way all the mathematics so forth the intelligence of the world has disguised the purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children don't you understand they'll never crucify him again but the prophet said what is the third crucifixion brother Jackie the crucifying the effects of the word that can never nail him to a tree again that's been done one time but what they they do now through the websites through the books come on somebody they try to take the word of God and make it no effect in your life amen come on somebody but the Bible said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the the word of God so what did they do they tried to explain it away by their intelligence they try to explain it away by their mathematics something trying to destroy the faith of God's children all this believe the sign trash all these books that they buy on Amazon it's a bunch of nonsense I said it's a bunch of nonsense you think I'm going to believe somebody that wrote a book that can't do one miracle that don't know God from a hot and to come on somebody I serve the Living God tonight and he promised to send Elijah the prophet and he kept his word and he sent that prophet to me and he opened the seals and he revealed to me my purpose for being on the earth amen there is no book from Amazon going to take that away from me Hallelujah the prophet said they'll never do it that faith that faith will live on forever Moses when he talking and all the wisdom of the Egyptians when he knew that God had a purpose for his life what did that Revelation come from his mother said she was the Fifth Gospel it was Joseph his mother who took Moses and shoved him right out into the jaws of death what did she take him to what were they doing with these Hebrew children they was throwing them into the river they was feeding them to the crocodiles and and what did yed do she knew that God delivered Noah by an ark so she built an ark for her baby and what did she do she pushed it right out there in the now where all the crocodiles was she pushed it right out into the jaws of death why would she do that because she knew God's purpose could not be defeated amen there wasn't enough water in an aisle to drown him there wasn't enough crocodiles in all the world that could swallow him he was God's chosen and he was God's chosen for that purpose and nobody could take his place we are God's chosen today we believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus there's no bombs there's no hell there's no nothing else that can destroy God's purpose we have got to go into the resurrection it's promise it's a promise that we have of our God Amen he said there will be a Rapture as far as God's concerned we already have Moses on the back side of the desert out there the the screams and the HTS and the Wilderness stagging around almost perishing but he knew that nothing could defeat God's purpose huh for God had placed him there God had put Moses there to do what God told him to do cuz his purpose cannot be defeated think of Joseph and and mared a child the child was to be born in Bethlehem not on the road to Bethlehem not on the hill to Bethlehem not at the city welcome sign of Bethlehem it had to be Bethlehem because the word of God called for it listen to me Mary Don't Be Afraid Of The Journey Don't worry about the mule Dy don't worry about the thieves on the road we're on the journey to the Eternal purpose of God the child will be born in in Bethlehem the word will become flesh in Bethlehem why God purposed for it to be oh little bride don't be afraid of the journey we were born for a purpose and that's to reproduce Jesus Christ in flesh again Hallelujah God watched over them AGI why because they had the appropriate gifts to identify his presence on the earth there was nothing that would stop them from getting to Jesus Jesus they were born to identify him on the earth then what have we been put here to do little bride I tell you we have been put here to identify him on the Earth today amen making him the same yesterday today and forever we're more than a church member we're more than a message believer come on somebody the devil believes and trembles we're more than that we was born for a purpose God wrote your name with Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world he knew the color of your skin he knew the color of your hair he knew the color of your eyes he knew your name and wrote your name with Jesus why Brother David why would he write my name with Jesus why brother Jackie because we are join AES hallelujah hallelujah when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable well brother I don't feel that way he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it if you believed it you might start feeling it there is nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you are absolutely undefeatable you got to turn to your neighbor and say you're undefeatable well that was weak well you'll say it sooner or later you are absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not Christ not Christ the body but the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her then let's go from here tonight with this understanding we will not be defeated there is nothing that is is coming there is nothing that Satan is bringing there is nothing that can stop this bride we may have trials we may have troubles but there is nothing that will stop this bride from fulfilling the purpose of God for the bride will not be defeated and God's purpose will not be defeated he has given us perfect Assurance amen that we are the bride and we will not be defeated therefore we have nothing to fear amen did not he tell his disciples that night when they were scared did not he say Be not Afraid when he stepped in the boat him man I turned to him and said don't you understand what's happening don't you understand what you're experiencing don't you understand where you're at the word is being made flesh do you understand where you're at forence not a Creed not a Dogma the word is being made flesh amen listen you were made for an eternal purpose because you are the manifestation of an attribute you are the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you he made an earth to take you out of to make you a human being every man that come to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he's called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening listen a young Minister don't have to try to produce his ministry brother Joe if God's called him God will open the doors that's right come on somebody you see it so much nowadays where they adverti theirself on the internet make theirself available but if God's called you for this God Will Make A Way for it to happen amen hallelujah God has ordained for you just keep Ste remember if he's called you for this there's nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what God's word will be made manifest you were born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place God's word will Triumph it cannot fail that's where every Christian ought to stand knowing trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will all work out right amen I don't understand it he never asked us to understand it but he did ask us if we believed him yes sir amen I remember that night sure I was crying and I got a basket for her to throw up in cuz she's so upset she said I've lost my daddy I've lost my sister she said why would God do this for us my little baby why would he do this she said you're gone all the time you're never home you're traveling why would he do this to us I said listen honey I don't know I don't know why this is happening but there's one thing I do know sometimes God don't ask us to understand he just ask us can we trust him can we trust what he's doing he'll make a way for us somehow some way he didn't bring us this far to leave us he didn't build a home in us to move away come on somebody he never taught us this s to let us drown and he never lifted us up in this hour to let us down he's got it all in control oh my let me hurry what was Jesus manifested for why was Jesus manifested on the earth to show God did not they say show us the father he said have I not been with you so long what was he here to do to show us God then what has the bride manifested for what is she manifested for why is she here in this hour why is he raised her up in these last days what is she therefore to show God what's more of this world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen do you love him he sent the life that he lived by he sent that life back to the church the Holy Spirit God's purpose we find here of sending the Holy Spirit back to the church was for one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that was God in Christ continuing the plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his Works through the church continuing his work through the church the God that was in Christ continued his plan through Christ and out of Christ into the church to continue his work through the church he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was he that was to come he was he that was he that is and he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved the church that he might have the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminence the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church Jesus said he that believeth in me works I do shall he do also and even more than this shall he do for I go to the father's sea that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody who can so see it that they can let the word manifest through them someone who can so see the purpose of God the plan of God that they can let the word manifest through them Jesus so seated was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he was God's revelation God revealed then this Ransom Church of the last day purposed by God to be here what is she she is not a Creed she is not a Dogma she is not a she is not a denomination what is she she is

Revelations 10-7 to vindicate this all these Mysteries to vindicating these last days that God has opened the book and revealed the seals and the word has been made flesh once again the same word that spoke for the groom now speaks for the bride bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit she's God's revelation God revealed in flesh once again Christ is the mystery of God revealed all

mystery this great secret and he kept it in his mind yes sir but the prophet said what was once this great secret this great mysterious secret that was in his mind but the prophet said it ain't in his mind anymore it was in his mind but where is it at that great secret that was in God's mind is now put into the heart of the believer what was once God's Great mysterious secret that was in his mind has now been placed in the heart of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God's once God's Great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest where in you think of it Lord think of it oh my wow because God promised it and he keeps his promises he cannot fail his promises are always true says any May ever seen the picture of that light the angel Lord the pillar of fire you know what's up in Washington DC you know these bunch of people that wants to trash the message they said that it's not up there hanging of course not because they rotate stuff in

that led Israel it's still leading this church there's not a wind strong enough that will stop this bride amen they ain't got nothing that will stop you there's no not a sickness there's not a trial that'll keep us from achieving God's Great Eternal purpose for our lives there's something within us it's a fire that's burning a light that's been lit by God and no Breeze can blow it out there's no cold spell in the church there's no indifference among the people there's no persecution of the world can can blow out that flame that God has lit for God has purposed that his torch light of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no powers no powers that Satan has can blow it out they will only make it burn brighter as they blow as they criticize as they come against it they will not shut it down it will just burn brighter I've been touched by a fire let the world come and watch me burn [Applause] I can't put it out we've seen him I've seen him in the promised word for this day

word that was being preached he knows all about you can we rest can we rest in his plan how many of you remember brother Alfred Hall anybody remember brother Hall you know brother Hall was a pretty dark skinned man wasn't he well here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion now some of you may not know what a mungon is but a mungon they call them the mysterious people out of the hills of Tennessee and Virginia over here and some people claim they were Cherokees some claimed they were pugie and genre and I don't know what all they claimed these people to be but there was actually a tri-racial people they were white black and Native American reason I know so much about it a lot of my mama's people the Goodman and the Moors and the Gibsons and the Sweeny they was all identified as that so here a few year ago they had a mungon reunion up in Virginia and me and my brother went to it and we was walking out through there now they had brother they had a man by the name of Brent Kennedy Dr Brent Kennedy and he wrote a book on the mungon it's called the mungon a mysterious people actually have the book there in my study and so we was walking around up there at this melon reunion and I told my brother Dwayne I said I tell you right now if anybody is at this reunion it'll be brother Alfred Hall and we turn the corner guess who we run into I said brother Hall I knew you would be here and he started laughing and he had that book Brett Kennedy the mysterious melons of mysterious people I said I knew you'd be here he said yeah he said the man that wrote the book said I'm one of them and I've come to tell youall come on now the man who wrote the book the author of this book The Bible said he is the author and finisher of our faith amen and he's come to tell us he's come to tell us the author of this book has come to tell us according to Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did prate him whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and what shall we say do these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things how many things how many how many amen this bride is lacking nothing he has freely given us all things he's given us joy he's given us peace he's given us Health he's given us Redemption he's given us for he's given us forgiveness he's given us the Holy Ghost he's given us the promise of a Rapture he has freely given us all things the author of the book said [Applause] so who shall lay anything to charge elect to God's elect it is God that justifi who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of God of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter they and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded can I get an amen I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angel nor principality nor power nor things present nor things to come nor hyp nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord then what should we be we are children of the promise being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and our HS with him with the promise no matter how much sickness comes what kind of death we die how much poverty we go through God's purpose cannot be defeated he will raise us up again for he said because I live ye shall live also the author of this book said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the her of the Servants of the Lord
