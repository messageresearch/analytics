[7:26] this is a testimony from Sister Ruth
[7:29] priest the last few weeks the Lord Has
[7:31] Done many wonderful things I want to
[7:33] give a testimony of one of the ways he
[7:35] has moved for us
[7:37] this postpartum healing process has not
[7:40] been an easy one I've been suffering
[7:42] with postpartum anxiety the anxiety was
[7:45] so bad it was hard to function when I
[7:48] would close my eyes to sleep I would see
[7:49] demonic faces in my mind it was a
[7:52] tormenting anxiety that hung heavy in
[7:54] the atmosphere around the house
[7:56] I had been watching brother Tim Pruitt's
[7:59] message call changing the atmosphere and
[8:01] it spoke perfectly to where I was
[8:03] spiritually the enemy was fighting us so
[8:06] hard I told Phil that I felt like the
[8:08] Lord was about to move early one morning
[8:10] I was lying in bed and able to sleep
[8:13] sometime around four o'clock I felt a
[8:16] peaceful feeling start in my feet and
[8:18] gently move over me as it moved over me
[8:21] the darkness vanished and is and in an
[8:24] instant I felt like myself again
[8:26] in that moment I knew it was the Lord
[8:29] since then the heavy atmosphere around
[8:30] the house Has Lifted and the anxiety
[8:33] disappeared I'm so thankful for his
[8:35] beautiful touch is anything too hard for
[8:38] our God praise the Lord
[8:40] amen
[8:43] thank you the Lord
[8:45] brother Kirk sacker says he will be
[8:48] having a cardiac medical procedure in
[8:50] the morning or on Tuesday Morning rather
[8:52] would be grateful for your prayer so we
[8:54] certainly want to pray for the Kirk the
[8:56] Lord would be mindful of him during that
[8:58] time sister Eva Hagee called wanted to
[9:01] thank everyone for their prayers she is
[9:03] a faithful streamer and considers us her
[9:05] home Church she loves and appreciates

[9:12] hospital recovering from a major stroke
[9:14] she is also in the process of adopting
[9:17] her grandchildren and is asking for God
[9:19] to give her strength and wisdom during
[9:22] this time so we certainly commit that
[9:24] need unto the Lord this morning

[9:29] grandson his name is Canaan he is six

[19:58] he's developed a tumor on his heart into
[20:00] him on his lung and liver and I just
[20:02] asked God to pray in this long story
[20:04] short they said six months to a year
[20:06] with surgery we didn't feel comfortable
[20:08] with that so we pressed along and it's
[20:10] been eight months and he's been in great
[20:12] he's been great God's been touching him
[20:14] but the the story is I last Friday night

[31:17] before we
[31:19] read here I'd like to ask you to
[31:21] remember brother
[31:22] Eugene Kennedy he's in um
[31:25] a hospice house up in Bristol Tennessee
[31:28] had to take him up a couple of days ago
[31:30] he's certainly not not doing very good
[31:33] and I heard from Sister Janet this
[31:34] morning his mouth is
[31:36] got some really bad places in it it
[31:39] can't swallow can't eat
[31:42] um just inverting
[31:44] bad shape certainly needs the Lord to to
[31:47] move our brother today we believe the
[31:49] Lord's mindful don't we I certainly
[31:51] mindful I also want to thank you for
[31:54] praying for Erica and she had her
[31:58] treatment on Thursday and then the shot
[32:00] on Friday just done well so far thank
[32:03] the Lord for that just real real weak
[32:06] and needs needs strength there but we're
[32:08] just believing the Lord that he's going
[32:10] to move forward
[32:11] I know the prophet told us that whenever
[32:13] Jesus was here on the earth that he used
[32:15] remedies
[32:16] actually whenever the king Hezekiah was
[32:20] going to die the Lord sent the prophet
[32:22] and told him that and he prays and sends
[32:24] him right back around again he goes back
[32:26] to him again and he actually brings a
[32:29] pole to some figs
[32:31] and puts on that ball
[32:33] and God uses things like that Donny
[32:37] that's not odd it must have seen when
[32:39] the Lord Jesus would have spit into some
[32:42] dust and made it into mud and rubbed it
[32:45] on a Blind Man's eyes
[32:47] so I don't care if he spits in my face
[32:50] if he has chemo if he
[32:53] we just want to be well don't we yeah
[32:55] that's right we want to do what God's
[32:57] called us to do
[32:58] so let's just bow our hips together
[33:01] we'll pray I mean you have a need on
[33:03] your heart today to signify the lifting
[33:05] of your hand

[33:28] so needy we have so many needs father
[33:31] we're bringing them before you brother
[33:33] Eugene you see is
[33:35] state that he's in Lord
[33:38] dear God as I want to sing the other day

[33:44] but I know that he's got a new body
[33:46] that's waiting for him it's wealthy and
[33:49] hell and a rather well rather and we
[33:52] know that Satan no matter what he does
[33:54] he cannot take us until that purpose of
[33:57] God is finished
[33:58] our brother's been through this for so
[34:00] many many years and we don't always
[34:02] understand but we know that we can trust
[34:04] you you saw the hands that were uplifted
[34:07] here today Father we pray that you'll be
[34:09] mindful of each one of those needs Lord

[34:17] we can be able to be what you want us to
[34:20] be we know the darkness is pressing
[34:22] against us like never before
[34:25] Satan and all of his demons are doing
[34:27] everything they can to stand against the
[34:29] people of God
[34:31] and the lid has been tore off of hell
[34:34] but God we believe you have a people
[34:36] that are standing on the earth that will
[34:38] withstand everything Satan does we're
[34:41] glad to be identified with that today
[34:43] help us as we look into your word now
[34:45] father in Jesus name
[34:47] amen
[34:49] second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1.
[34:55] I'd like to look today
[34:58] at the force
[35:00] the fourth woman
[35:03] in the line of the genealogy
[35:06] of our Lord Jesus coming to the Earth
[35:10] of the five women that Matthew writes
[35:13] about
[35:15] four of them supposedly gentiles
[35:20] three of them
[35:22] in sexual misconduct
[35:26] hurts pains Sorrows all kinds of things
[35:30] that come from
[35:33] but it depends on what we will allow the
[35:36] things that we go through do to us
[35:38] they can shape us they can mold us they
[35:41] can make us better people or we can hang
[35:43] our head in shame you know hide from it
[35:46] all but myself I desire to be what the
[35:49] Lord wants me to be no matter what I
[35:51] have to go through
[35:54] second Samuel chapter 12 verse 1.
[35:57] and the Lord sent Nathan
[36:00] unto David
[36:03] and he came unto him
[36:04] and said unto him
[36:07] there were two men in one city
[36:10] the one rich
[36:11] and the other poor
[36:13] the rich man had exceeding many flocks
[36:16] and herds
[36:18] but the poor man had nothing say one
[36:20] little you land
[36:22] which he had bought and nourished up and
[36:25] it grew up together with him and with
[36:27] his children
[36:28] and it did deed of his own meat and
[36:31] drank of his own cup
[36:33] and lay in his bosom
[36:36] and was unto him
[36:38] as a daughter
[36:39] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[36:42] man
[36:43] and he spared to take of his own flock
[36:46] and of his herd to dress for the
[36:49] wayfaring man that was coming to him
[36:52] but took the poor man's lamb
[36:55] and dressed it for the man
[36:58] that was come to him
[37:00] you may be seated may the Lord bless his
[37:02] word
[37:12] Bathsheba
[37:14] is a very unique character
[37:18] in the
[37:20] genealogy of Our Lord
[37:23] I preached about her and David for
[37:26] decades
[37:28] but as I begin to look as I've been
[37:31] studying on these women
[37:34] I realized that there was
[37:36] an Avenue of bathsheba's life
[37:39] but I'd never looked at before
[37:42] and I saw things about her
[37:46] that was different than what I had
[37:50] noticed before I hope I'm and you never
[37:53] get to a spot to where we sank so much
[37:56] we know so much that God came and
[37:59] lightness more
[38:01] I've always looked at Bathsheba
[38:05] as being
[38:07] in great fault
[38:09] and I have flawed her
[38:13] because of instances of of the bats of
[38:19] course and David seeing her
[38:22] but as I begin to look into the way the
[38:26] scripture sets her forth
[38:29] I realized that
[38:31] she wasn't to blame
[38:34] in the way that I had blamed her
[38:37] maybe some of you can understand what
[38:40] I'm saying and it's amazing how that we
[38:44] can look at things for so long and yet
[38:48] all of a sudden the Lord just opens it
[38:51] up and it's like you're looking at an
[38:52] entire new thing that you've never seen
[38:55] before
[38:58] by this time it has been a little bit
[39:02] over a year
[39:04] David has hid his sin
[39:08] he's been sick
[39:11] he's been weary
[39:13] he's been without Joy
[39:16] he's lost power and his life
[39:20] is miserable
[39:22] everybody that was close to him
[39:25] could tell something was wrong
[39:29] he wasn't riding any more songs
[39:34] he was not
[39:36] pinning any Psalms
[39:39] his Joy was depleted
[39:43] he was quite miserable
[39:47] but yet
[39:48] he had not come to the spot to where
[39:51] that he was able to go to the source of
[39:54] what was causing all this stuff and fix
[39:57] it
[39:59] and God let it go and he let it go and
[40:02] he let it go
[40:04] but David was acting true to form
[40:08] to the most of humanity
[40:11] that when we get in trouble
[40:13] we don't always go to the source that we
[40:15] should go to
[40:17] and you if you want to get a background
[40:20] of kind of where David was during this
[40:23] time frame you can read psalms 32. and
[40:28] Psalms 51. and you'll see where that
[40:32] David was and how that he knew he was
[40:36] wrong
[40:37] and he was so missing the former time
[40:42] he'd had was God
[40:45] now at this stage in David's life he's
[40:47] he's a middle-aged man
[40:50] and David like many other great men
[40:54] he had reached a plateau
[40:57] and his walk was gone
[40:59] I suppose he felt like by this time
[41:03] he would be able to back off a little
[41:06] bit and he wouldn't have to do as much
[41:10] and he wouldn't have to be under such
[41:12] strain and such difficulty
[41:15] he'd been fighting since he was a small
[41:17] boy
[41:19] he had been dealing with giants
[41:21] Philistines
[41:23] backslidden King Saul he'd been dealing
[41:26] with so many things in his life
[41:30] but now he had entered into a place of
[41:34] rest
[41:34] a place to where that the kingdom had
[41:38] been established some of the tumultuous
[41:42] relationships among Saul's family and
[41:45] all of that had finally calmed down
[41:49] there were still things going on but yet
[41:52] he felt like that he had come to a spot
[41:54] to where he didn't necessarily have to
[41:57] fight like he did before
[42:00] you know that can be a good thing but it
[42:04] can also be one of the most dangerous
[42:06] times of your life
[42:09] David had not yet been willing to come
[42:13] out and confess his sin now this is the
[42:18] man
[42:19] but let us look at the woman
[42:22] by the name of Bathsheba
[42:25] in Chronicles it calls her bathshewa
[42:30] but the same woman was a common Hebrew
[42:33] trait that they would rename their
[42:36] children after they were born they would
[42:39] see a predominant factor in them and
[42:41] they would name them you know whatever
[42:43] whenever they were born and then they
[42:45] would see them as they would grow up and
[42:48] mature and they'd start seeing other
[42:50] things in them and they would rename
[42:52] them so apparently this had happened to
[42:55] her she is married to Uriah the hittite
[43:00] he's a mighty General in the armored
[43:03] Army of David her father is Ellie m
[43:08] her grandfather is a great man also one
[43:13] of David's personal counselors his name
[43:16] is a hisophile
[43:19] a histophile and also Uriah the hittite
[43:24] were part of David's personal bodyguard
[43:28] they were called the 30. the 30. they
[43:33] were the men that were hand-picked by
[43:36] David generals lieutenants
[43:40] counselors that were his personal
[43:43] bodyguard
[43:45] this is who the woman was identified
[43:49] with now with some men in her life so
[43:53] she we don't even know if she even knew
[43:55] King David personally so the story that
[44:00] we want to look at is a classic story
[44:04] of a man of great power
[44:08] and a woman with no rights
[44:12] a man of great influence
[44:15] a man that was known around the
[44:20] Civilized world at that time
[44:23] a great man yes indeed a great man
[44:27] a powerful man
[44:29] but he's fixing to meet a powerless
[44:32] woman
[44:34] Now by their custom not necessarily the
[44:38] law of God but by their custom in this
[44:41] time frame of their culture
[44:44] a king could kill anyone
[44:47] who refused to do what he said
[44:51] he had to have no scripture No quote
[44:54] he didn't have to have anybody to go
[44:56] along with it his word was law
[45:01] now you and I both know there's very few
[45:04] men that can handle that kind of power
[45:08] to be honest with you God never made man
[45:10] to have that kind of power
[45:13] so we don't really know as far as the
[45:18] story when she is beckoned by King David
[45:22] whether she screamed out as The Book of
[45:27] Leviticus said a woman is supposed to do
[45:29] if she's assaulted we don't know if she
[45:33] tried to talk him out of doing wrong
[45:37] were really unsure
[45:39] but there's one thing about the scenario
[45:42] that we do know
[45:44] David was King
[45:47] and he was a powerful King notice in
[45:51] second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1. and it
[45:55] came to pass after the year was expired
[45:57] at the time when kings go forth to
[46:02] battle
[46:03] that David sent Joanne
[46:06] but the Bible doesn't say it was time
[46:09] for joab to go out
[46:11] but it was time for David to go out
[46:15] now here's the setting then that we see
[46:18] which is going to lead up to something
[46:21] that David will never outlive the rest
[46:25] of his life
[46:26] so we see uh something in David that has
[46:32] now become a fault a lack a disrespect
[46:37] for God for his position that David is
[46:41] now pulling back and shirking an element
[46:45] of his responsibility
[46:48] notice how the author of Samuel writes
[46:51] it at the time when kings go forth to
[46:53] battle that David sent joab and his
[46:57] servants with him and all Israel and
[47:00] they destroyed the children of amen and
[47:04] besides rabban but David carried still
[47:09] at Jerusalem so they go out and they go
[47:12] to fighting and joab takes command and
[47:16] he steps up and David is at home at
[47:20] Jerusalem
[47:21] and while joab is fixing to lay Siege
[47:26] against rabba
[47:28] Lucifer is laying Siege
[47:31] against David
[47:34] and he will prevail quicker
[47:37] than Joe abwell
[47:40] well joab and the army is carrying out
[47:44] David's command
[47:46] David now enters into a slothful lazy
[47:52] type of time in his life
[47:55] now if you haven't been there you will
[47:58] be there as a Christian
[48:00] all Christians face this time whether
[48:03] you're a king a preacher a deacon a
[48:06] housewife all of us go through times in
[48:10] our life to want to see my everything is
[48:12] going really good
[48:14] and we become if we're not careful
[48:16] slothful lazy very Relentless to do
[48:20] anything and we think well it's the
[48:23] blessing of God not always not always is
[48:27] it a blessing of God we can see from the
[48:29] way that the scripture terms this this
[48:31] was not a time of Shabbat for David God
[48:35] never decreed this this was David's
[48:38] dereliction of his own Duty now notice
[48:42] in verse 2 and it came to pass in an
[48:46] evening time now this is of course
[48:48] written in the Mediterranean type of
[48:51] vernacular so it seems very strange to
[48:52] us but the these these people in this
[48:56] era they would rise at Daybreak let me
[49:00] give you a cycle of their day they would
[49:02] Arise at Daybreak and then they would
[49:05] have their new meal about lunch at lunch
[49:07] time would be around noon and then the
[49:10] Eventide would begin at three o'clock
[49:14] that would be the hottest part of the
[49:16] day most of their houses were built with
[49:19] a flat roof they didn't have the roofs
[49:21] that we do today so no more than 8 10 12
[49:25] feet tall and they would go up on the
[49:28] roof because it was cooler so they would
[49:31] always unless they was in Wartime or
[49:34] emergency going on they would take a nap
[49:37] in the cool of the day or the heat of
[49:39] the day rather waiting for the day to
[49:42] cool off too hot to work too hot to do
[49:45] much so they would take a siesta so
[49:49] David is up on the roof now he's already
[49:53] negligent of his duty notice in what the
[49:56] Bible says that David arose from off his
[49:59] bed and walked upon the roof of the
[50:02] King's house so look what he's doing
[50:04] nothing
[50:05] nothing
[50:08] so he gets up off of his bed now this is
[50:11] a king this is a man who has great
[50:14] responsibility a powerful man but a
[50:17] powerful man needs to be a busy man
[50:21] because if he's not he will get in great
[50:24] trouble
[50:26] so notice he walked upon the roof of the
[50:29] King's house and from the roof he saw a
[50:34] woman washing herself now the Bible
[50:38] doesn't give us great detail about the
[50:41] woman much prior to this and it doesn't
[50:44] say anything in this particular verse of
[50:47] what the woman was actually doing how
[50:51] she was going about and I myself have
[50:55] always projected her as a seductress or
[51:00] a temptest one who was this type of
[51:04] woman but as I begin to read in the
[51:07] scripture what I found amazing in the
[51:11] last few weeks is I've been pouring over
[51:13] this is that not one time did the Bible
[51:18] ever blame
[51:21] Bathsheba
[51:27] as a matter of fact it Likens her to a
[51:31] lamb
[51:32] not an adulteress at all
[51:36] and God never mentions her or blames her
[51:42] he blames David
[51:46] so as I begin to look at this and I've
[51:48] looked at at Ruth of course as you know
[51:51] and we've looked at at Tamar and we've
[51:55] looked at Rahab and now looking at at
[51:59] this woman which is a different scenario
[52:01] altogether and I begin to realize that
[52:04] God took these woman women rather along
[52:07] with Mary and use their life their
[52:11] background their story their past what
[52:15] they come through what they went through
[52:16] and all of that to merge a type of the
[52:21] Gentile bride as a whole as if so they
[52:25] were a kaleidoscope of God picking a
[52:30] bride so some would come from reverse
[52:32] scarred background come with some would
[52:34] come from the background of all types of
[52:37] sexual promiscuity and others would come
[52:39] from the background that would be very
[52:41] rare but a few of them would come like
[52:44] Mary or there was hardly any he's saying
[52:46] against them at all other than just
[52:48] their natural birth and yet God would
[52:51] take from that this woman would reflect
[52:54] so many in this one so many and God put
[52:57] the whole thing together to make a
[52:59] picture of what his Gentile bride would
[53:03] actually be
[53:05] amen now what's this and the woman was
[53:07] very beautiful to look upon so here
[53:11] David is now just kind of lazing around
[53:15] and not really doing much so he peers to
[53:18] have entered into a time to where he's
[53:21] kind of slothful and just laid back
[53:23] taking a lot of naps as we'd say it
[53:26] today spent a lot of time on video games
[53:28] and he knew more about Netflix and he
[53:31] did the gospels he knew more about
[53:33] television and movie stars and knew more
[53:36] about football and you know he could
[53:38] tell you all the running backs and the
[53:39] quarterbacks and the no backs and the
[53:41] waybacks and all types of things like
[53:43] that but he didn't know too much about
[53:45] the Bible
[53:46] well priest mother died
[53:49] you see so David arises off of his bed
[53:53] and in this afternoon of idleness when
[53:57] he has nothing to imagine that this is
[53:59] the time when kings are supposed to be
[54:01] out to Bible and he has nothing to do
[54:04] there's something wrong with this
[54:05] scenario from the very beginning now
[54:07] remember this is King David this is a
[54:11] man after God's Own Heart
[54:15] this is the Giant Killer this is the
[54:19] dancing shouting Psalm writing
[54:23] David
[54:29] so David steps out now according to the
[54:33] law
[54:34] David of course was not supposed to take
[54:38] anything or lust after anything that did
[54:42] not belong to him
[54:44] now when you look and as I begin to look
[54:47] at the at the history of this and I
[54:50] found out that I actually want Bathsheba
[54:53] was doing while she was not taking a
[54:56] bath Just For Pleasure she was not
[55:00] taking a bath and all bubbly and soapy
[55:03] as like some of you sisters might like
[55:05] it and she had done this to be able to
[55:08] where the king would see her but what
[55:11] she was doing she was taking a Mikvah
[55:16] a Mikvah now she had just finished her
[55:21] cycle
[55:22] and according to the levitical law when
[55:24] a woman would come to this cycle she was
[55:28] to take a Mikvah
[55:30] and that was there had to be so much
[55:33] standing water and but there had to be
[55:36] water which come out of a lake or a
[55:39] river or even the ocean
[55:42] and they would take this water and mix
[55:45] it together with fresh water but it
[55:47] could not be running water
[55:49] but standing water
[55:52] and they actually wouldn't even disrobe
[55:55] they would not become undressed so she
[55:59] was dressed and this was the proper way
[56:03] to take amygdah sort of like whenever we
[56:07] get baptized in water so we are baptized
[56:11] with our clothes on is that right so
[56:14] what she was doing and this is why that
[56:18] God never condemned her as being a
[56:21] prostitute or ill-famed or anything like
[56:25] that
[56:26] and God now is going to through this
[56:30] Union God is going to bring some years
[56:33] later King Solomon and also another Son
[56:37] by the name of Nathan
[56:40] which out of this lineage will come the
[56:44] Messiah
[56:45] so you think there had to be a perfect
[56:48] will of God that somehow God would have
[56:51] joined David and Bathsheba together but
[56:55] it was not the way David was going to go
[56:57] about it
[56:59] oh my can you say Amen so the Mikvah
[57:03] then is the ritual bass designed for the
[57:07] Jewish right to complete where this
[57:10] woman would be cleansed so she's not
[57:12] doing it as a way of a prostitute to be
[57:16] able to look out for this man and see if
[57:19] somebody will look at her and lust after
[57:21] him notice sin in verse 3 and David sent
[57:25] and inquired after the woman so David is
[57:29] now he sees the woman and the Bible says
[57:32] she was beautiful to look upon and David
[57:34] sent and inquired after the woman and
[57:37] one said
[57:39] and one said
[57:43] it's not this Bathsheba the daughter of
[57:45] elium the wife of Uriah the hittite
[57:50] so David apparently was unaware of who
[57:53] the woman was but somebody told him
[57:57] one of his generals one of his who knows
[58:00] what it was but somebody told David who
[58:03] this was and this individual knew who
[58:05] she was very well
[58:08] but the main thing he knew was she was
[58:11] married
[58:15] and what does David do in response verse
[58:18] 4 and David sent Messengers
[58:23] and took her
[58:27] this is an amazing word took
[58:31] to take gift fetch
[58:34] lay hold of
[58:36] snatch
[58:38] capture
[58:40] to steal to be taken captive
[58:45] so now we have the great King David
[58:48] stealing a sheep
[58:56] oh my
[58:59] so now we have
[59:01] a different scenario about a great man
[59:05] I wish I didn't have to preach this
[59:08] I wish I never had to bring this up
[59:12] but I'm glad God had it written in the
[59:14] Bible
[59:14] that's one thing I love about the Bible
[59:16] it don't just write all the good things
[59:18] about the people that writes me into
[59:19] their faults and their failures
[59:22] and I appreciate a man that'll preaching
[59:24] myself
[59:26] now notice and David sent Messengers and
[59:28] took her and she came unto him and he
[59:32] lay with her for she was purified from
[59:37] her uncleanness and she returned unto
[59:42] her house
[59:44] now here David the mighty man the man of
[59:49] influence
[59:50] takes advantage of his position
[59:54] and he assurps his kingly god-given
[59:58] authority
[59:59] over a woman which has no rights no
[1:00:03] rights
[1:00:04] if she would have refused him she could
[1:00:07] have been killed
[1:00:10] oh my goodness how many men have done
[1:00:14] exactly the same thing well I'm going to
[1:00:17] preach with or without you this morning
[1:00:19] how many preachers have done such a
[1:00:23] thing and they use their position to to
[1:00:27] weigh like sisters in the church whether
[1:00:30] they were married or single or young or
[1:00:33] whatever they were and by their position
[1:00:36] fall to lower than a snake
[1:00:43] well Hallelujah
[1:00:45] what is it it's not only preachers this
[1:00:48] is why the metoo movement several years
[1:00:52] ago come to light in America because
[1:00:56] many women began to come out and testify
[1:00:59] that their boss done this or said that
[1:01:02] or did this or would promote them if
[1:01:04] they would do special favors don't sit
[1:01:06] there and look at me like you don't know
[1:01:08] what I'm talking about
[1:01:09] why is it because you can't find many
[1:01:13] real true men or women as far as that's
[1:01:16] go and the age that we're living in that
[1:01:19] can have authority over others and not
[1:01:23] use that influence for their own rotten
[1:01:26] benefit
[1:01:28] but I say shame on every one of them
[1:01:31] that does it whether it's a preacher
[1:01:33] whether it's a man in a company whether
[1:01:35] it's a CEO or whatever he is I say shame
[1:01:39] on them
[1:01:40] well praise the Lord
[1:01:43] so here David now is going to move into
[1:01:48] a very very rotten cycle of humanity
[1:01:53] now notice how that the prophet Nason
[1:01:56] it's funny the prophets how God would
[1:01:59] give them the words to say it it must
[1:02:02] have been a heartbreaking scenario that
[1:02:05] day him no doubt God gave the man a
[1:02:08] vision and it must have been so
[1:02:11] discouraging because this was the same
[1:02:14] man that God used to tell David that God
[1:02:18] would establish with him and his seed an
[1:02:22] Everlasting Covenant
[1:02:24] and now he has to go back and convey a
[1:02:28] different message but David liked the
[1:02:30] most of us
[1:02:32] had such an easy time seeing the
[1:02:35] thoughts in other people but struggled
[1:02:38] to see his own
[1:02:44] praise the lord well I preached to me
[1:02:46] and y'all just kind of bear with me as I
[1:02:48] preached to me today okay
[1:02:51] now notice how the prophet Nathan
[1:02:54] conveys this and the Lord sent Nathan
[1:02:57] unto David and he came to unto him and
[1:02:59] said unto him there were two men in one
[1:03:03] city the one rich and the the other poor
[1:03:07] so now a year has gone and David
[1:03:11] thinking maybe that he's been able to
[1:03:13] hide this and been able to get over it
[1:03:16] but yet knowing in his conscience that
[1:03:19] this thing is not right with God and God
[1:03:23] is going to bring his son to repentance
[1:03:26] now I'm not sure exactly how this sermon
[1:03:30] is going to go as a matter of fact it's
[1:03:33] taken me hours upon hours upon hours to
[1:03:38] find the direction in which way I should
[1:03:42] project this so I know the Outreach of
[1:03:46] it is going to be tremendous I know that
[1:03:48] already and I know already there's going
[1:03:51] to be lives that are going to be
[1:03:53] affected by
[1:03:54] and it will affect you and I according
[1:03:57] to how we will let it affect us I want
[1:04:00] to affect men a good way
[1:04:02] if I can learn by David's mistake so be
[1:04:05] it if you can learn by David's mistake
[1:04:08] so Beth and the church said
[1:04:11] so it must have taken direction from the
[1:04:15] spirit of God to be able to help Nason
[1:04:18] to know what to say now remember the
[1:04:21] king had power even over the prophets as
[1:04:24] far as taking their life if they so
[1:04:27] desire King David could have called when
[1:04:30] Nathan come in to start to tell this
[1:04:32] story he could have called and had him
[1:04:34] beheaded right there now he was against
[1:04:36] and not that it was according to God's
[1:04:37] law but according to the law of the land
[1:04:39] and the way they looked at it so NASA no
[1:04:42] doubt must have entered into the court
[1:04:45] of the king with great precaution yet
[1:04:48] feeling he had a message by now Nathan
[1:04:51] knew what had went on God had conveyed
[1:04:54] to him the mystery of the secret of the
[1:04:57] sin now watch the rich man had exceeding
[1:05:01] many flocks and heard now remember
[1:05:03] David's background was that he was
[1:05:06] formally a Shepherd so the spirit of God
[1:05:10] no doubt LED Nation to be able to convey
[1:05:14] a story that would catch David's
[1:05:17] attention and if you don't mind me
[1:05:19] saying it this way to get him off guard
[1:05:22] something that would let him hear the
[1:05:24] story and would be able to penetrate
[1:05:27] past the guard of himself which he still
[1:05:31] had up because of his own pride and
[1:05:34] Humanity now so the spirit of God gives
[1:05:37] Nathan a story that David's going to be
[1:05:40] able to relate to so he uses the story
[1:05:43] as a shepherd and sheep now remember
[1:05:46] David was quite the shepherd and no
[1:05:49] doubt he had risked his life many times
[1:05:52] remember when he fought the lion and
[1:05:55] when he fought the bear no doubt he had
[1:05:57] many many personal stories that he could
[1:06:00] have told so the spirit of God LED
[1:06:03] Nathan to deal with something not with a
[1:06:06] king committing adultery not by the king
[1:06:08] taking this man's wine no no no he
[1:06:11] couldn't go that way so he would have to
[1:06:14] display this story in a parable and it's
[1:06:18] amazing how that us humans are that if
[1:06:21] we will tell a story and we leave the
[1:06:24] actors nameless and how good godly
[1:06:27] people will be able to judge that story
[1:06:30] with no name attached to it and from
[1:06:34] their heart they'll look at said that
[1:06:36] ain't right I'll tell you one thing that
[1:06:38] ain't the way it should have been done
[1:06:40] but if you're to put a name on the story
[1:06:42] initially that has said something
[1:06:45] totally different
[1:06:51] I hate that about every one of us
[1:06:54] you might as well just go ahead and Nod
[1:06:56] your head or say Amen because you're
[1:06:58] just like every other stinking rotten
[1:07:00] human being
[1:07:05] so if God would have let Nathan and
[1:07:07] Nathan would have come out now I'll tell
[1:07:09] you one thing David who are you to
[1:07:10] challenge me who are you but God did not
[1:07:13] want to condemn the man to be lost
[1:07:17] he left him
[1:07:21] and he wanted to help the man
[1:07:24] to repent
[1:07:30] so you imagine when Nathan starts
[1:07:32] telling the story right from the
[1:07:34] get-go's we'd say
[1:07:37] the poor man had nothing
[1:07:40] save one little
[1:07:44] prostitute
[1:07:45] one little Harlot one little temptress
[1:07:48] that she was evil and wicked notice the
[1:07:52] way God projects Bathsheba
[1:07:55] in this parabolic form
[1:07:58] that she was actually a you lamb
[1:08:05] now David's attention
[1:08:07] no doubt he'd heard about it all of his
[1:08:09] life how that Shepherds would do this
[1:08:12] and Shepherds would do that and they
[1:08:13] would sneak the Lambs and they'd they'd
[1:08:15] tell the owner well this one got killed
[1:08:17] and buried this one and David himself
[1:08:20] was out there in the field and I knew
[1:08:21] they lied they'd saw that lamb so
[1:08:24] anything to do with lambs and sheep boy
[1:08:26] it got his attention
[1:08:30] but the Torah man had nothing
[1:08:33] save one little you lamb
[1:08:37] which he had brought bought rather I am
[1:08:41] nourished up
[1:08:43] so the poor man I remember David's a
[1:08:46] rich man and he was hearing this in a
[1:08:49] two-fold manner from his background of
[1:08:51] being a Shepherd but also being a king
[1:08:54] which is to help bring Justice to the
[1:08:58] poor of his kingdom as well as the rich
[1:09:01] so the words from the prophet are
[1:09:04] exactly precise
[1:09:07] what God wants to do is open David's
[1:09:10] Soul past David's flesh
[1:09:14] and get it open just long enough where
[1:09:18] the Prophet can insert the sword
[1:09:23] why to kill him to annihilate him to
[1:09:26] destroy him to bring him to repentance
[1:09:32] I'm so glad that's our father
[1:09:35] now remember he still is leaving the
[1:09:38] story without names
[1:09:41] so the one you lamb
[1:09:44] is Bathsheba
[1:09:46] I'm the poor man of course is Uriah and
[1:09:50] the rich man is David but you see the
[1:09:52] story sometimes has more power
[1:09:55] if you leave the names out
[1:10:02] sort of like us
[1:10:04] you know if it's your son or your
[1:10:06] daughter or your best friend then we
[1:10:09] render one judgment and if it's just a
[1:10:12] story in general but our righteousness
[1:10:14] will raise up let that man die glory to
[1:10:17] God let this happen and that happen
[1:10:21] mmm
[1:10:23] long as it's nameless people oh we're so
[1:10:26] righteous
[1:10:28] do you understand the Bible tells us
[1:10:31] to have respect of persons is sin
[1:10:40] when we were rendered judgment
[1:10:42] differently because it's a different
[1:10:44] person
[1:10:45] under the same scenario we have sinned
[1:10:48] just like if you'd smoked a cigarette
[1:10:50] drunk a bottle of beer
[1:10:54] come on now
[1:10:56] God help us
[1:10:59] now what's even the adjectives that the
[1:11:03] prophet uses
[1:11:04] because he Likens Bathsheba to a you
[1:11:08] lamb a young lamb now I don't know if
[1:11:11] you know this or not but the Jewish
[1:11:14] history says that Uriah was an older man
[1:11:20] and he had several children
[1:11:22] by another woman
[1:11:25] but Bathsheba was a young woman
[1:11:29] now watch the adjectives of the Prophet
[1:11:31] so this poor man how do you lamb a young
[1:11:36] beautiful wife
[1:11:39] a convert to Judaism and so much that
[1:11:43] she was taking the midva being converted
[1:11:46] from being a gentile
[1:11:49] so he has this
[1:11:52] young wife
[1:11:53] now notice
[1:11:55] the prophet says he bought her
[1:11:58] which of course the way they did it was
[1:12:00] they would give them a dowry
[1:12:03] they would have to give the father so
[1:12:05] much for the daughter depending on her
[1:12:07] beauty and depending on whether she's
[1:12:10] educated or not
[1:12:12] so if you had a beautiful woman you had
[1:12:14] to pay a lot if she had you know a
[1:12:16] little bit of book learning how to tell
[1:12:17] a lot more I guess you'd look for a lot
[1:12:19] of dumb ugly ones in that day wouldn't
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:23] been on how fat your pocketbook it was
[1:12:26] but now this was their dowry
[1:12:35] so watch now the prophet is laying it
[1:12:38] out in such a beautiful description you
[1:12:40] see once we look back at this it makes
[1:12:43] so much sense how beautiful it is after
[1:12:46] I begin to read this I wonder if I ever
[1:12:48] read this before have I ever read this
[1:12:50] before
[1:12:52] so he nourished this you lamb up look at
[1:12:57] the words he uses he nourished her up as
[1:13:00] his own flesh
[1:13:03] which is the way husbands should do
[1:13:05] their wives
[1:13:07] now watch what he's doing on purpose
[1:13:09] Nason is showing such a love between
[1:13:14] this poor man in this new lamb
[1:13:17] so the lamb is not just a you know it's
[1:13:20] not just an animal it's not just a piece
[1:13:24] of property to this man but it's
[1:13:28] actually a part of his family
[1:13:31] he nourished this land
[1:13:33] now I don't know if you're aware of this
[1:13:35] or not but unlike Us in the modern day
[1:13:38] they did not have dogs and cats in their
[1:13:44] houses
[1:13:45] as a matter of fact to them a dog was
[1:13:49] one of the lowest animals on the Earth
[1:13:51] but they would have pet Lambs
[1:13:57] uh-huh pet lambs and other farm animals
[1:14:01] and some of them would actually feed
[1:14:03] them from their table they'd never have
[1:14:06] a dog or a cat now I'm not against you
[1:14:07] if you got one it's up to you but I'm
[1:14:10] just telling you the way it was in their
[1:14:11] time so what's Nathan how he takes this
[1:14:15] scenario and he says it grew up together
[1:14:18] with him
[1:14:20] and notice how he includes his children
[1:14:21] and with his children
[1:14:24] so now he meets this beautiful young
[1:14:27] woman and she becomes his wife and then
[1:14:31] she is also growing up and he loved her
[1:14:34] so much and watch how Nathan sets it
[1:14:37] forth that she was not an animal
[1:14:39] she was not a piece of property why is
[1:14:42] he say that
[1:14:43] because that's the way David treated her
[1:14:49] she was nothing more than a piece of
[1:14:52] Flesh to satisfy his lust
[1:14:58] but that's not the way Uriah looked at
[1:15:01] her
[1:15:03] to your eyes she was this precious
[1:15:05] wonderful
[1:15:08] thing that God had given him
[1:15:16] bless Lord God
[1:15:18] it did eat of his own meat and drink of
[1:15:23] his own cup
[1:15:24] and lay in his bosom
[1:15:27] and was unto him
[1:15:29] a daughter now notice all of these
[1:15:32] adjectives that he's using is the
[1:15:34] expression of Love That Uriah had for
[1:15:38] Bathsheba each adjective is making David
[1:15:42] worse and worse as far as his pitch and
[1:15:46] fervor of anger
[1:15:49] you imagine him saying that dog
[1:15:53] I cannot believe a man would do
[1:15:57] something like that what in the world
[1:16:01] and Nathan is describing him
[1:16:09] so David is a thief
[1:16:12] David is a sheep stealer
[1:16:18] and by this time the parable is given
[1:16:21] he's also a murderer
[1:16:27] now David killed thousands
[1:16:31] remember the song the daughters of
[1:16:33] Israel sang to David
[1:16:34] Saul has killed his hundreds but David
[1:16:37] his thousands and his tens of thousands
[1:16:42] and I hope you don't misunderstand me
[1:16:44] but as far as We Know by scriptural
[1:16:47] account he'd never murdered anyone
[1:16:52] which is not the same thing as killing
[1:16:54] the enemy of God then you're doing it
[1:16:55] God's bidding
[1:16:57] if you look it up in the Ten
[1:16:59] Commandments when it says Thou shalt
[1:17:01] kill and Chase the Hebrew word it is
[1:17:03] Thou shalt do no murder the same God
[1:17:06] that said Thou shalt not kill is the
[1:17:07] same God to tell kill the amorites kill
[1:17:10] the Hittites kill the Philistines is
[1:17:12] that right but there's a great
[1:17:13] difference in killing to defense and in
[1:17:16] murder and this was premeditated murder
[1:17:26] King David
[1:17:30] or you can still enjoy the book of
[1:17:32] Psalms after this
[1:17:33] you can still enjoy the songs and all
[1:17:36] the things that God did it ought to make
[1:17:37] you appreciate them even more than
[1:17:39] you've ever appreciated
[1:17:42] oh my
[1:17:44] God so here
[1:17:46] his affections were so endeared to this
[1:17:49] this woman so whatever that he had is
[1:17:53] shared with her
[1:17:54] and she was part of his house and
[1:17:57] they just loved her so much
[1:18:01] now what's Nathan as he moves to verse
[1:18:03] 4.
[1:18:04] and there came a traveler
[1:18:07] unto the rich man
[1:18:09] and he spared to take
[1:18:12] of his own flock
[1:18:16] so the traveler that came
[1:18:19] what was it David's passion
[1:18:23] gave its lust
[1:18:25] anointed by the devil
[1:18:30] so the traveler came
[1:18:33] and he knocked on David's door
[1:18:36] you see this is the way sin does
[1:18:39] it will come as a guest
[1:18:43] but remain as a master
[1:18:49] unless you open the door and boot him
[1:18:51] out
[1:18:55] there came a traveler unto the rich man
[1:18:58] and spared to take his own flock
[1:19:03] and of his own hurt
[1:19:06] so watch him now as he brings us
[1:19:08] together and he makes it like a scenario
[1:19:10] and that day would have been and it was
[1:19:12] of their custom you know the Bedouins
[1:19:15] even today the Arabs it's one of the
[1:19:17] greatest attributes that they have among
[1:19:19] themselves that if they see someone
[1:19:21] walking or or a stranger coming through
[1:19:25] hospitality is something that they do
[1:19:27] it's it's part of their custom and part
[1:19:30] of who they are so here he takes the
[1:19:33] common scenario of that day and he sets
[1:19:35] it for us that a stranger come through
[1:19:38] and he invited him into the house and
[1:19:40] and instead of him taking one of his own
[1:19:42] Lambs one of his own sheep what he does
[1:19:46] he goes to the house of this one poor
[1:19:49] man and only has this one sheep and this
[1:19:53] one sheep is not one among ten thousand
[1:19:55] it's not one among 500.
[1:19:59] it's the only one he has
[1:20:03] and he kills that sheep
[1:20:05] and he feeds that sheep
[1:20:08] to his Passions
[1:20:10] to his lusts
[1:20:16] praise the Lord
[1:20:21] but talk here's this word again fetch
[1:20:24] snare
[1:20:26] steal
[1:20:29] so now we have David
[1:20:32] the thief
[1:20:36] and what did David steal a sheep isn't
[1:20:39] it strange that God would liken a man's
[1:20:43] wife
[1:20:44] to being a sheep
[1:20:47] so now King David
[1:20:50] is a thief
[1:20:52] and a murderer
[1:20:57] well I think y'all are required to
[1:20:59] subscribe this morning
[1:21:03] but he took the poor man's land
[1:21:07] and dressed it for the man
[1:21:09] that was come to him now notice again in
[1:21:13] the parable that God addresses David as
[1:21:18] the aggressor
[1:21:20] David as the trespasser
[1:21:24] God would never
[1:21:26] I can't believe I hadn't seen this
[1:21:28] before
[1:21:29] God would have never identified
[1:21:32] Bathsheba
[1:21:34] as a you lamb
[1:21:37] as innocent had she been a temptress
[1:21:42] you understand
[1:21:45] so King David takes this lamb and feeds
[1:21:50] this passion this lust
[1:21:54] he doesn't love her
[1:21:57] he doesn't love this woman
[1:22:01] so he sends her back home
[1:22:12] oh my goodness
[1:22:15] but you see by the time Nason comes
[1:22:18] David the Sheep stealer is now David the
[1:22:22] murderer
[1:22:25] second Samuel chapter 11 verse 14 and it
[1:22:28] came to pass in the morning that David
[1:22:30] wrote a letter to joab I'll save your
[1:22:33] time you can read it when you get time
[1:22:35] you remember how that he tried to get
[1:22:37] Uriah to go into his wife and he
[1:22:39] wouldn't do it she'd remember all of
[1:22:40] that that David wrote a letter to joab
[1:22:44] and sent it by the hand of Uriah
[1:22:50] now in this letter he's going to tell
[1:22:52] him what to do
[1:22:54] to get Uriah killed
[1:22:57] and Uriah carries that letter himself
[1:23:02] this man is a general of yours if you
[1:23:05] know the background of for for them to
[1:23:08] even live close enough this man was a
[1:23:10] gentile or hittite
[1:23:12] which according to history for this man
[1:23:14] to live this close to the House of David
[1:23:15] that he could have looked out on the top
[1:23:18] of his roof and see his house he had to
[1:23:20] do many great feats for David and for
[1:23:23] the Kingdom of Israel his house was a
[1:23:26] gift from King David
[1:23:28] so close he could see it into his house
[1:23:32] this man that may have even risked his
[1:23:35] own life for David
[1:23:39] and he gives him a message he's packing
[1:23:41] his own death's warrant
[1:23:44] but he was so loyal to David he would
[1:23:47] have never dared to broke the seal on
[1:23:50] that letter and read it
[1:23:56] he was more loyal
[1:23:58] than David was
[1:24:02] at this time in David's life
[1:24:05] a gentile was more reputable
[1:24:09] than the king of Israel
[1:24:19] he wrote in the letter saying
[1:24:22] set ye Uriah
[1:24:24] in the Forefront of the hottest battle
[1:24:27] and retire ye from him
[1:24:31] that he may be smitten and die
[1:24:36] and this man sticks this in his pocket
[1:24:39] and hands it over to joab and goes about
[1:24:41] his merry way
[1:24:43] not realizing his King has just betrayed
[1:24:47] him
[1:24:48] and he came to pass on joab observed the
[1:24:51] city that he assigned Uriah a place
[1:24:53] where he knew that Valiant men were and
[1:24:57] the men of the city went out and fought
[1:24:59] with joab and there fell some of the
[1:25:01] people of the Servants of David and
[1:25:04] Uriah the hittite
[1:25:06] died also
[1:25:09] And yet when David hears this
[1:25:13] about this rich man he gets so angry he
[1:25:18] gets so mad
[1:25:22] why the parable
[1:25:24] had no names
[1:25:30] so let's go back to the parable in verse
[1:25:33] 5.
[1:25:34] and David's anger
[1:25:36] was greatly kindled against the man that
[1:25:40] he didn't know who it was
[1:25:43] hey man
[1:25:48] and he said to Nathan
[1:25:51] as the Lord left us
[1:25:56] the man that hath done this thing
[1:26:01] shall surely
[1:26:03] die
[1:26:07] now let's just be honest and Frank with
[1:26:09] each other
[1:26:11] this would not have been his judgment
[1:26:14] had it been his name that introduced the
[1:26:17] parable
[1:26:20] that would have been one excuse after
[1:26:22] another
[1:26:24] well it's my wife's fault which one yeah
[1:26:27] to 300.
[1:26:29] well it was this in thought nothing's
[1:26:31] fault and that and done this and this
[1:26:33] and done that that's the way human
[1:26:35] beings are
[1:26:37] we're a sorry law didn't we
[1:26:40] Amazing Grace how sweet to sound God but
[1:26:42] still love us in spite of all the trash
[1:26:44] about us
[1:26:46] oh my
[1:26:48] so David passed judgment
[1:26:51] not realizing
[1:26:59] of all the blindness that we as human
[1:27:02] beings can have
[1:27:06] it's that which makes us blind
[1:27:13] and our family and our closest friends
[1:27:19] foreign
[1:27:21] just holds his piece and lets David go
[1:27:25] ahead and pronounce the judgment
[1:27:28] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[1:27:34] because he did this thing and because he
[1:27:37] had no pity all you see the sermon
[1:27:40] was a success
[1:27:46] the mind can be one hundredth of one
[1:27:48] percent as successful as Nathan's was
[1:27:50] that day it'll be of great success today
[1:27:56] where did he get this ideology of pity
[1:28:00] where did this come in the scenario
[1:28:02] because the man loved it fed it from his
[1:28:05] table drank from his cup all these words
[1:28:08] it was opening up David's Spirit it was
[1:28:11] opening up David's inner man so the
[1:28:14] prophet could say what
[1:28:16] what he's fixing to say the sword must
[1:28:19] enter his
[1:28:22] that is righteous indignation he's open
[1:28:24] now he's very vulnerable but now the
[1:28:27] prophet has got him exactly where he
[1:28:29] wants him he won't be that long he's
[1:28:31] only got a little while just like I have
[1:28:32] with you only got a little while to be
[1:28:35] able to reach inside of there and be
[1:28:37] able to penetrate deep down into the
[1:28:39] soul
[1:28:45] now David is actually quoting the law
[1:28:49] Exodus 22 1 if a man shall steal an ox
[1:28:54] or a sheep and kill it and sell it
[1:28:59] he shall restore five oxen for an ox
[1:29:03] and four sheep
[1:29:05] for a sheep
[1:29:08] we love that quote did he
[1:29:12] and what about the sixth commandment
[1:29:15] and what about the seventh
[1:29:18] he brought Thor
[1:29:20] of the ten
[1:29:29] maybe when I get done we should all make
[1:29:31] our chair an older call
[1:29:36] isn't it amazing how we can judge others
[1:29:38] and be so harsh and judge and
[1:29:42] we break four Commandments here and
[1:29:44] three Commandments there and two over
[1:29:45] here and
[1:29:49] remember what come out of his mouth this
[1:29:51] man shall pay
[1:29:53] fourfold
[1:29:59] so the son that is born of David and
[1:30:03] Bathsheba
[1:30:04] number one
[1:30:07] am not number two
[1:30:11] I don't know John number three
[1:30:14] Absalom
[1:30:29] no wonder the Bible tells us judge not
[1:30:32] and you shall not be judged
[1:30:38] he still doesn't know
[1:30:41] who the rich man is
[1:30:44] he doesn't recognize that you land The
[1:30:46] Traveler
[1:30:48] but look in verse 7.
[1:30:50] he's open he's vulnerable
[1:30:53] Now's the Time
[1:30:55] in sir
[1:31:00] insert Nathan said to David
[1:31:04] thou
[1:31:06] art the man
[1:31:09] thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:31:13] I Anointed The King over Israel
[1:31:16] and I deliver thee out of the hand of
[1:31:18] Saul
[1:31:21] God goes on to tell him I gave it on
[1:31:24] Master's house thy Master's wives into
[1:31:27] thy bosom
[1:31:28] and gave that the house of Israel and of
[1:31:30] Judah and if that had been too little
[1:31:34] I would have moored over have given unto
[1:31:37] this such and such things I gave you all
[1:31:40] that but if that wasn't enough I would
[1:31:42] have even done more if you needed it if
[1:31:46] you wanted it
[1:31:50] wherefore
[1:31:52] hast thou despise the Commandment of the
[1:31:56] Lord
[1:31:58] to do evil in thy thou Hast killed
[1:32:02] Uriah the hittite
[1:32:05] with the sword
[1:32:09] now wait a minute
[1:32:11] David wasn't there on the battlefield
[1:32:13] was he
[1:32:17] but God said it as if though David
[1:32:20] himself
[1:32:21] had killed him
[1:32:23] you see whenever we run down one another
[1:32:26] and ruin one another's influence we just
[1:32:28] killed our brother or our sister
[1:32:31] we might as well just took a knife and
[1:32:33] stabbed right in their back and you see
[1:32:35] this tends to follow with this type of
[1:32:38] scenario
[1:32:40] I remember several years ago I was in
[1:32:43] another country
[1:32:47] at a convention that I was preaching
[1:32:51] and the pastor that was holding the
[1:32:53] convention introduced me to this man and
[1:32:55] that man a lot of men I did not know of
[1:32:57] course
[1:32:59] and he introduced me to this particular
[1:33:02] individual he said brother Donnie this
[1:33:04] is an associate of our church I said oh
[1:33:06] okay nice to meet you brother
[1:33:10] that night as I was preaching I was
[1:33:12] speaking about Satan and how he stole
[1:33:15] the angels from God at the beginning
[1:33:17] you've heard me preaching on Satan's
[1:33:18] ambition
[1:33:19] and
[1:33:21] for whatever reason
[1:33:23] I just turned and the man was setting
[1:33:26] right here to my right
[1:33:28] and I said it would be something like
[1:33:31] this brother
[1:33:33] that he goes to the local church here
[1:33:36] and he he gets tired of being an
[1:33:38] associate
[1:33:39] so he wants to start his own church
[1:33:44] and I just liken that to Satan
[1:33:47] well sometime after that this man
[1:33:50] contacts me
[1:33:53] and he tells me that he and some of the
[1:33:56] people of that assembly are fixing to
[1:33:58] divide this church
[1:34:01] they've done got a building this is like
[1:34:03] a week or two before it's fixing to
[1:34:06] happen
[1:34:07] and I
[1:34:09] I wondered why in the world is he
[1:34:11] telling me this course I've tried to
[1:34:12] talk him out of it because I knew the
[1:34:14] brother knew there was no reason at all
[1:34:16] for him to do it
[1:34:17] I pondered over it I thought about it I
[1:34:20] prayed about it I I thought Lord what do
[1:34:23] I do do I do I tell this brother he was
[1:34:26] a friend of mine do I tell him do I let
[1:34:29] it go I don't want to be a meddler I
[1:34:31] don't want to be a troublemaker or
[1:34:34] nothing like that
[1:34:36] so I've got this real close friend
[1:34:39] that stands about this tall
[1:34:41] and got real dark hair
[1:34:44] and dark eyes
[1:34:47] and pulls no punches
[1:34:52] so I called him on the phone now unlike
[1:34:55] some of you that when you got saved you
[1:34:57] found out you knew everything in the
[1:34:58] message and you don't need no help from
[1:35:00] nobody I'm I'm not that way I'm kind of
[1:35:03] ignorant dumb sort of a guy and I need
[1:35:04] help about every day just getting up out
[1:35:06] of bed you know so I called brother Tim
[1:35:09] and I said brother Tim let me tell you
[1:35:11] this situation I find myself in a
[1:35:13] quandary I don't know what to do and he
[1:35:15] said well I'll tell you one thing
[1:35:19] uh oh boy here we go
[1:35:23] if brother Daryl or any of the preachers
[1:35:26] at your church was going to do that to
[1:35:29] you I would let you know about it
[1:35:32] and you are obligated to call that
[1:35:35] brother
[1:35:37] I said okay
[1:35:41] so I call thy brother
[1:35:44] I wasn't scared about the Tim I just
[1:35:46] wanted to make sure I was right
[1:35:49] I called the brother that was the pastor
[1:35:52] talked a little bit made Small Talk how
[1:35:54] you doing doing good how is church doing
[1:35:56] good I said How's brother so-and-so Oh
[1:35:58] Brother Don he's doing so good he's been
[1:36:01] such a blessing to us he's this that the
[1:36:03] other
[1:36:06] and then I had to tell him the bad news
[1:36:10] I said brother I hate with all of my
[1:36:12] heart
[1:36:13] to be the bearer of bad news to you but
[1:36:15] this Sunday they're going to do thus and
[1:36:17] soul and thus and so and thus and so
[1:36:20] now that was bad okay it was bad
[1:36:25] but what happened even worse to us this
[1:36:27] brother
[1:36:29] entered into a stage of being a murderer
[1:36:33] because he started fighting this
[1:36:34] preacher and other preachers
[1:36:37] you see
[1:36:39] this man
[1:36:41] had an ambition
[1:36:43] um
[1:36:44] yeah
[1:36:46] David had an ambition
[1:36:49] and it wasn't always Godly
[1:36:52] would somebody at least breathe out
[1:36:54] y'all are getting me nervous I'm afraid
[1:36:56] you're all going to pass out at one time
[1:36:57] there you go ah intake there you go
[1:37:01] that makes me feel better
[1:37:03] they said what killed all them people at
[1:37:05] one time is that guy's sermon he wiped
[1:37:07] out the whole church
[1:37:10] how'd that all happened well we've done
[1:37:12] code blue on all of them and the autopsy
[1:37:14] said every one of them died of a heart
[1:37:15] attack
[1:37:20] that was sad
[1:37:22] for what was even more sad
[1:37:25] the man that caused that scenario
[1:37:29] backslid
[1:37:31] got away from God
[1:37:33] other people led away from God
[1:37:38] and because of his sin
[1:37:41] to this day
[1:37:46] you see us the people of God were not in
[1:37:48] this by herself
[1:37:51] you may think oh nobody I have no
[1:37:53] influence over anybody don't you believe
[1:37:55] that
[1:37:56] if it ain't nobody more than your wife
[1:37:58] and your sons or your daughters we are a
[1:38:01] body friends
[1:38:03] and we need one another
[1:38:07] like never before
[1:38:10] so David
[1:38:12] the harpist the singer the shelter the
[1:38:17] Giant Killer
[1:38:19] becomes
[1:38:21] Saint killer
[1:38:25] becomes a murderer
[1:38:29] a sheep Thief
[1:38:33] Steeler
[1:38:35] does it really make any difference to
[1:38:37] God whether you steal money or sheep or
[1:38:40] oxen
[1:38:43] somebody else's car some of you would
[1:38:45] never steal somebody else's car
[1:38:48] but you're jealous of this and that and
[1:38:49] the other so you still favor
[1:38:52] you're still something that don't belong
[1:38:53] I would rather have favor in the eyes of
[1:38:56] five people god-given favor than to have
[1:38:59] favor in the eyes of five thousand and
[1:39:01] have to steal it by conniving lies
[1:39:04] and deceit
[1:39:15] so now I'm going to put the Judgment in
[1:39:17] your lap what should we do with this
[1:39:18] King
[1:39:19] should we tar and feather him
[1:39:23] should we kill the man
[1:39:28] I know some of you have been treated
[1:39:29] terrible
[1:39:30] some of you have been treated awful by
[1:39:32] preachers it takes the grace of God for
[1:39:34] some of you still believe in Preachers
[1:39:37] but just because one has done you wrong
[1:39:39] don't mean that there's not some left on
[1:39:41] the earth that is still God's servants
[1:39:44] I guarantee you that I could say this
[1:39:46] without exaggeration I've been treated
[1:39:48] worse by preachers than all of you all
[1:39:51] put together
[1:39:52] and brother Branham could say without
[1:39:54] exaggeration he'd been treated worse by
[1:39:55] preachers than I have been
[1:39:58] and he still believed in Preachers
[1:40:01] as a matter of fact he hoped that God
[1:40:03] would make both of his boys preachers
[1:40:07] because to him there could have been no
[1:40:10] higher call
[1:40:14] so Bathsheba
[1:40:16] maybe you've been hurt
[1:40:18] someone took advantage of you and hurt
[1:40:20] you
[1:40:22] what do you do with it
[1:40:24] let me just give you a little
[1:40:26] preview of what we'll continue on with
[1:40:29] Lord Buddha next week
[1:40:32] she's the only one
[1:40:35] in the Bible
[1:40:38] of the Queens
[1:40:40] that was given the title
[1:40:42] of Queen
[1:40:47] she was the only one in the Bible
[1:40:51] coming up like this
[1:40:53] that was given thrown
[1:40:57] Sheba
[1:41:03] well I can't tell you I can't wait till
[1:41:05] next week as a matter of fact
[1:41:08] they say proverbs 31.
[1:41:14] you don't want proverbs 31 is we'll read
[1:41:16] it after church who can find the
[1:41:19] virtuous woman
[1:41:21] the Jewish historians say Solomon wrote
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:26] as an epitome
[1:41:35] King Lemuel
[1:41:37] is what he calls himself
[1:41:39] he refers to his mother over and over
[1:41:44] again she could have felt sorry for
[1:41:46] herself she could had all types of you
[1:41:48] know grudges and this and that and the
[1:41:50] other but instead of doing that she let
[1:41:52] God take his mercy and rewrite her life
[1:41:57] she was innocent she was innocent
[1:42:05] spell our heads together
[1:42:15] oh the Lord God
[1:42:19] Heavenly Father
[1:42:25] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:42:30] I commit this service the sermon this
[1:42:33] word
[1:42:36] and these people into your care
[1:42:40] this visible audience and the invisible
[1:42:43] and there'll be many thousands no doubt
[1:42:45] that we'll hear it
[1:42:47] so if there's a David about to make a
[1:42:50] horrible mistake
[1:42:52] may you stop him
[1:42:55] maybe there's a David that's made that
[1:42:57] horrible mistake already and he's
[1:42:59] daling living with the condemnation of
[1:43:02] it
[1:43:03] worried that he's crossed the line and
[1:43:05] can't get back
[1:43:08] maybe there's a Bathsheba that has been
[1:43:11] trespassed against by a man
[1:43:14] of power a man of authority
[1:43:18] she feels like her life is worthless
[1:43:22] Lord God whatever wherever we are today
[1:43:26] help us Jesus
[1:43:29] your Prophet taught us well power apart
[1:43:33] from character
[1:43:34] is satanic
[1:43:37] Lord we realize that many men in this
[1:43:40] message
[1:43:41] have so abused their position
[1:43:46] Lord God I wish I wasn't privy
[1:43:49] to all that I know that has happened
[1:43:52] around this message over the years by
[1:43:54] preachers
[1:43:57] I wish in one way Lord I could have been
[1:43:59] left alone
[1:44:01] just stayed down in Kentucky and nobody
[1:44:03] knew me
[1:44:05] I wish I would have never had to been
[1:44:09] brought to the position that I'm in I
[1:44:12] wish I could have been
[1:44:14] left down there
[1:44:17] but that wasn't your will
[1:44:21] so help me Lord
[1:44:23] ignorance is bliss as we say
[1:44:27] how many of us no doubt wish we wouldn't
[1:44:29] know this and know that and know the
[1:44:31] other
[1:44:33] but father we pray today that you would
[1:44:36] help us
[1:44:38] then Lord God we not only pray that you
[1:44:41] would forgive us
[1:44:43] oh Jesus but we ask that you would help
[1:44:46] us
[1:44:47] not to wrong others
[1:44:50] help us father when we
[1:44:52] judge matters
[1:44:54] to be very careful
[1:44:58] help us Lord that no matter whose name
[1:45:01] is attached to a scenario
[1:45:03] may we not render a different judgment
[1:45:06] because if it's a family member
[1:45:10] or a loved one or a friend
[1:45:13] may we render the exact same judgment
[1:45:17] no matter who it is
[1:45:20] because the word is always right
[1:45:25] oh Jesus
[1:45:28] may you Hallelujah
[1:45:33] may you insert your sword as it were
[1:45:37] if we need to be cleansed to be washed
[1:45:40] to be cut loose from something
[1:45:43] maybe it's something that we hold in our
[1:45:45] hearts
[1:45:46] maybe some have been so trespassed
[1:45:48] against Lord they don't want to trust
[1:45:50] nobody
[1:45:51] may you bring healing to them today
[1:45:53] Father
[1:45:55] Lord God we
[1:45:57] bring our lives before you
[1:45:59] we commit them into your care
[1:46:03] I know Lord many of these people have
[1:46:04] been hurt by preachers have been let
[1:46:06] down by them
[1:46:09] they hold every preacher even me at
[1:46:12] arm's length as we would say
[1:46:14] because they've been hurt so deeply it's
[1:46:16] like they can never trust again
[1:46:20] the Lord Jesus I pray you would help us
[1:46:23] that we can love again
[1:46:25] trust again
[1:46:27] Hallelujah
[1:46:29] able to have confidence again Lord
[1:46:33] some don't just need healing in their
[1:46:34] body
[1:46:36] they need healing in their spirit
[1:46:39] imagine that woman at the well must have
[1:46:42] been one
[1:46:44] difficult woman to ever reach
[1:46:47] she'd been so abused by men
[1:46:50] so taken advantage of by men
[1:46:54] same as Rahab The Prostitute turned out
[1:46:57] on the street by her parents to make a
[1:46:59] living selling her body
[1:47:01] must have been so hard for her to trust
[1:47:04] another man
[1:47:07] and yet here come a preacher
[1:47:09] with the message of the hour
[1:47:12] and there was such an overwhelming force
[1:47:14] from her soul
[1:47:15] that helped her to believe that message
[1:47:19] she found herself being healed
[1:47:21] of trust
[1:47:23] she trusted them men so much she hid
[1:47:25] them she risked her own life
[1:47:28] to hide them on the roof of her house
[1:47:32] Lord Jesus help us to love again
[1:47:36] help us to trust again
[1:47:40] help us to forgive
[1:47:43] oh Jesus
[1:47:45] I'm speaking from experience myself
[1:47:48] today Lord
[1:47:51] I thank you for helping me Lord Jesus
[1:47:55] I've been hurt since a child
[1:48:00] start being hurt by preachers and I was
[1:48:02] just a boy
[1:48:05] as many of these have
[1:48:07] but I thank you today Lord
[1:48:10] I can still Trust
[1:48:12] I can forgive these people don't realize
[1:48:16] what a miracle is standing before them
[1:48:21] the Lord my worst greatest hurt
[1:48:24] has been
[1:48:26] by preachers
[1:48:28] preachers that you trust once you have
[1:48:31] confidence in
[1:48:33] ones that you believe or stand with you
[1:48:37] during the hard times
[1:48:40] and when the hard times come come they
[1:48:42] turn their back and go the other way
[1:48:46] but I'm so grateful today Lord
[1:48:48] that you helped me I still believe in
[1:48:51] Preachers
[1:48:52] I still believe in sheep
[1:48:55] because the second next category that's
[1:48:58] hurt me though what most has been sheep
[1:49:01] sheep that you cry for you pray for
[1:49:05] you give them their life you give them a
[1:49:07] portion of your life every time you
[1:49:08] preach
[1:49:10] they rob you of your sleep they rob you
[1:49:12] of your family time they rob you of all
[1:49:15] kinds of things in your life
[1:49:18] then they get tired of you and they turn
[1:49:20] and walk away
[1:49:21] and don't even have the common courtesy
[1:49:24] to come and talk to you
[1:49:27] they treat you lower than they would
[1:49:29] their dog
[1:49:31] or their house cat
[1:49:34] they don't even have enough respect to
[1:49:36] come
[1:49:37] and talk to you
[1:49:39] but I'm so grateful today Lord
[1:49:42] I still believe in sheep
[1:49:45] and our love for sheep
[1:49:49] help me Jesus
[1:49:51] help these people Jesus
[1:49:55] help the ones in Africa that'll hear
[1:49:58] this
[1:49:58] the ones in Canada
[1:50:01] the ones in Europe
[1:50:04] Lord God in the name of Jesus
[1:50:08] if there's a sheep stealer they don't
[1:50:11] hear this
[1:50:12] deal with his heart
[1:50:15] if there's a money Thief
[1:50:18] or whatever kind of thief it is
[1:50:21] help them to realize as long as they got
[1:50:24] breasts they got hope
[1:50:27] it might be easy for us to condemn the
[1:50:29] thief but Lord I believe
[1:50:31] there's Mercy for the thief
[1:50:34] that's what the message from Nathan was
[1:50:36] about
[1:50:37] he's talking to the thief himself
[1:50:42] Lord Jesus help us not only to reach out
[1:50:45] to the injured
[1:50:47] but the injurer
[1:50:49] help us not only to reach out to those
[1:50:51] who've been hurt but The Herder himself
[1:50:55] or herself
[1:50:57] that's where it draws the line for us it
[1:51:00] makes it so hard for us Lord if we know
[1:51:03] somebody hurts our past or hurts our
[1:51:05] friends hurts our family oh it's really
[1:51:08] hard on us it's hard for us to speak to
[1:51:11] him again it's hard for us to treat them
[1:51:13] the same
[1:51:14] but Lord Jesus help us to be like you
[1:51:17] are
[1:51:18] help us to reach out to The Davids in
[1:51:20] our life
[1:51:22] granted Lord
[1:51:25] I think when we can come to that spot
[1:51:27] from our soul
[1:51:29] we're probably not too many weeks away
[1:51:31] or months away
[1:51:33] from a body change
[1:51:36] we scream Seven Seals and holler seven
[1:51:38] trumpets and all that sort of thing
[1:51:41] but it's really the hidden things inside
[1:51:43] of our heart
[1:51:44] that tell Who We Are
[1:51:48] oh Jesus if I've ever took anything from
[1:51:51] any person
[1:51:53] if I've ever wronged any person
[1:51:56] forgive me Lord God
[1:51:58] if there's anything against me today I
[1:52:01] pray my father
[1:52:03] yet forgive me
[1:52:05] I don't want to leave this life with
[1:52:08] anything held Against Me Lord
[1:52:10] cleanse me
[1:52:12] Wash Me
[1:52:14] I don't just pray for myself I pray for
[1:52:16] everyone here Lord God
[1:52:19] or is there anyone here
[1:52:21] under the sound of my voice
[1:52:24] that would stand to your feet and say
[1:52:25] Lord
[1:52:26] that's my prayer too
[1:52:28] if there's anything I've done anything
[1:52:30] I've said
[1:52:31] if I have offended anybody if I've done
[1:52:34] anything wrong
[1:52:35] if I even if I don't even know about it
[1:52:37] North
[1:52:39] please forgive me
[1:52:42] please forgive me
[1:52:46] no wonder David said it is against thee
[1:52:49] and the only that I've sinned
[1:52:52] cleanse me from blood guiltiness Lord
[1:52:56] and I will be cleansed
[1:52:58] Wash Me with hyssop
[1:53:02] and I shall be washed
[1:53:06] God don't just forgive smoking God don't
[1:53:08] just forgive drinking
[1:53:10] God forgives it when you won't speak to
[1:53:12] that neighbor
[1:53:13] when you shun that one that's done your
[1:53:15] little wrong
[1:53:16] he specializes in forgiveness of those
[1:53:19] things too
[1:53:22] can we just bow our heads together and
[1:53:24] just
[1:53:24] pray for each other not necessary that
[1:53:26] you they hand on them if you don't want
[1:53:28] to but
[1:53:29] you're not just praying for yourself now
[1:53:32] you believe what you want to about this
[1:53:34] sermon but if you trust me as your
[1:53:36] pastor
[1:53:37] almighty God gave me this
[1:53:43] heavenly father in this solemn moment
[1:53:47] to Bow our heads and we're not just
[1:53:49] necessarily praying for ourself but
[1:53:51] we're praying for each other this
[1:53:53] morning
[1:53:54] we're praying Lord for those that we go
[1:53:57] to church with
[1:53:59] those that we love is our part of this
[1:54:01] flock
[1:54:03] but Lord we don't want to just limit it
[1:54:05] to that we want to pray for
[1:54:07] our brothers and sisters around the
[1:54:09] world
[1:54:12] and we most of all want to pray for
[1:54:14] those
[1:54:15] who have trespassed
[1:54:17] against us
[1:54:20] Lord we know from
[1:54:22] the remaining portion of this story
[1:54:25] as it goes on in time
[1:54:28] it hits the fail
[1:54:30] was bathsheba's grandfather
[1:54:33] and when Absalom raised up an
[1:54:35] Insurrection against David
[1:54:38] and wanted to divide the kingdom
[1:54:41] and pull people away from David's
[1:54:43] Kingdom
[1:54:45] ahithophel
[1:54:46] took sides with Epsilon
[1:54:51] and even though David had done wrong
[1:54:53] Absalom was not justified in what he had
[1:54:56] done
[1:54:57] and the hitherfell broke allegiance to
[1:55:00] God's anointed
[1:55:02] and we know the end of the story
[1:55:05] his counsel was rejected
[1:55:07] and he goes and takes his own life
[1:55:10] because he was on the wrong side in the
[1:55:13] time of battle
[1:55:14] he sided with the wrong leader
[1:55:19] oh Lord God I pray you would help us
[1:55:21] father
[1:55:23] we pray for those who've spoken against
[1:55:26] us
[1:55:27] we pray for those who have done us wrong
[1:55:31] from the young girls
[1:55:34] with those that go to school with the
[1:55:35] young men of people they work with that
[1:55:38] maybe laugh at him and ridicule them we
[1:55:41] pray for them
[1:55:42] for those that work in the medical field
[1:55:44] and they're laughed at because their
[1:55:46] sisters
[1:55:47] dress different than most of them
[1:55:50] we pray for them today
[1:55:53] forgive them Father
[1:55:55] we do not want to get a grudge
[1:55:58] like a hitherfell did
[1:56:00] and it didn't kill David
[1:56:03] but it took his own life
[1:56:06] because he would not let go
[1:56:09] of David's fault and David's sin
[1:56:11] but it ate on him and ate on him and the
[1:56:15] first opportunity of hitherfell saw he
[1:56:18] joined with Absalom
[1:56:20] to try to take the kingdom away from
[1:56:23] David but even though David was wrong
[1:56:26] he had repented
[1:56:28] and he was still your anointed
[1:56:32] Lord Jesus forgive us
[1:56:35] of our failures our shortcomings
[1:56:38] we love you father
[1:56:40] if I've done anything wrong said
[1:56:42] anything wrong to anyone
[1:56:45] forgive me Jesus
[1:56:47] we love you Lord God
[1:56:51] praise be to God
[1:56:54] if there's some here Lord that can't
[1:56:56] love again
[1:56:57] help them to love again
[1:57:01] help them to trust
[1:57:04] granted I pray father
[1:57:07] now whatever you have need of in your
[1:57:09] heart would you just raise your hands as
[1:57:11] a sign of surrender to the Lord
[1:57:14] you don't have to speak it out loud if
[1:57:15] you don't want the person standing by
[1:57:17] you to hear what you're saying
[1:57:19] but just in your heart Lord you know
[1:57:22] what a name Lord you know I have a hard
[1:57:24] time trusting
[1:57:26] you say I'm so scarred and I've got so
[1:57:28] many things I just can't trust Lord
[1:57:30] but I need your help to heal me
[1:57:33] I need your help
[1:57:34] to forgive
[1:57:36] and to love again
[1:57:38] to trust again
[1:57:40] to believe in people again
[1:57:44] to believe Lord to trust
[1:57:48] oh Jesus
[1:57:49] we worship you great Adonai
[1:57:53] we bless your name father
[1:57:56] right now may you Minister healing Lord
[1:58:00] I pray among your people
[1:58:04] Hallelujah I may need healing in your
[1:58:06] spirit today not just so much your body
[1:58:10] may God bring it to your friends
[1:58:15] oh Jesus let's just worship Him for just
[1:58:18] a few minutes now before we go
[1:58:22] thank you Lord God
[1:58:24] many years ago I was preaching
[1:58:26] a convention was brother biscoll and
[1:58:28] brother vandile
[1:58:30] that brother Harold Hilda Branch Church
[1:58:33] that had a prayer line
[1:58:35] brother Harold wanted me to preach that
[1:58:37] night so I went on the direction of
[1:58:38] faith we preached for prayed rather for
[1:58:41] several hundred people
[1:58:43] the last service which was on Sunday
[1:58:45] I didn't know what I was going to preach
[1:58:47] I was so tore up I wouldn't even go eat
[1:58:48] lunch
[1:58:50] you those of you that have heard brother
[1:58:51] van and brother biscoll they preached
[1:58:53] everything I felt like there was to
[1:58:55] preach they didn't leave nothing even in
[1:58:57] the back of the Bible the concordance
[1:58:58] for me to preach from
[1:59:00] I looked at the maps but they covered
[1:59:02] the maps too
[1:59:03] so I thought what in this world am I
[1:59:06] going to preach on what am I going to
[1:59:07] say I took care I said you go for lunch
[1:59:09] I need to be by myself
[1:59:10] I need some time from the Lord
[1:59:13] let us begin to pray and talk to him
[1:59:16] his presence come in that hotel room
[1:59:17] where I was at
[1:59:19] and he dealt with me about going down
[1:59:21] the line of the scarred human beings
[1:59:23] many of you have heard that
[1:59:25] I went a little bit different direction
[1:59:26] but
[1:59:27] that night as I began to preach and I
[1:59:30] knew in just just a few moments I was in
[1:59:32] the right Channel
[1:59:34] I began to preach I could see people
[1:59:36] weeping here and there and there and
[1:59:37] crying preach the sermons I was fixing
[1:59:40] to wind up brother Harold stepped up
[1:59:41] behind me said offer a prayer line I
[1:59:44] said we just had one the other night he
[1:59:46] said offer a prayer life
[1:59:48] I said all right
[1:59:49] I said brother Harold says if we want to
[1:59:52] have a prayer line anybody here would
[1:59:53] want to be prayed for
[1:59:55] we didn't have one
[1:59:57] we had three
[2:00:00] one preacher was at one prayer line
[2:00:02] another preacher was in another prayer
[2:00:04] line
[2:00:05] I was at another one
[2:00:07] the things I heard that night brother
[2:00:10] of people coming through people in their
[2:00:13] 80s one sister 90 years old
[2:00:17] the story she told me
[2:00:19] would break the heart of the hardest
[2:00:21] person
[2:00:23] they wouldn't come in through for cancer
[2:00:24] a few of them were but most of it was
[2:00:27] scars
[2:00:29] that had more Decades of their life
[2:00:32] brother Hildebrandt told me later he
[2:00:34] said call me a few days after I got home
[2:00:35] he said you act like he was really
[2:00:37] nervous that night I said I wasn't
[2:00:39] acting I was nervous
[2:00:42] and he said well I just wanted to let
[2:00:44] you know
[2:00:45] we've already had more requests
[2:00:48] for that sermon than all the rest of
[2:00:51] them
[2:00:51] put together
[2:00:54] deep wonderful profound preaching
[2:00:59] and yet all that deep preaching
[2:01:01] apparently
[2:01:02] had not touched the Wounded Spirits and
[2:01:05] broken hearts
[2:01:07] of many many hundreds of those saints of
[2:01:10] God
[2:01:11] let go friends
[2:01:13] learn to trust
[2:01:16] learn to live again
[2:01:19] so God
[2:01:21] can have a throne for you someday
[2:01:27] let's just worship a little bit before
[2:01:28] we go camera
[2:01:31] let's just close our eyes now just
[2:01:34] let him Minister healing to you
[2:01:37] create in me
[2:01:41] a clean heart
[2:01:47] oh
[2:01:49] God
[2:01:53] and renew our right spirit

[2:12:56] [Music]
[2:13:00] by myself
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:16] I hope I can get this out right Lord
[2:13:21] healed me a number of years ago
[2:13:24] and uh the other night like he was
[2:13:27] actually just brother John hornyak
[2:13:28] because I think up praying
[2:13:30] and he just was just talking about the
[2:13:33] things the Lord has done for us that we
[2:13:35] haven't really given him credit for
[2:13:37] and or that's just the way it was
[2:13:39] impressed upon my heart you know and
[2:13:41] years ago it's about about 2005. I've
[2:13:45] been in the military off and on for last
[2:13:47] 20 years and I was in the Army and
[2:13:50] they had I had me I had a blood clot it
[2:13:54] happened an optic nerve I had surgery
[2:13:55] and a vaccine about the same time they
[2:13:58] don't know what caused it by lost Vision
[2:13:59] almost completely in my right eye
[2:14:02] and uh
[2:14:06] and I got prayed for
[2:14:08] and uh
[2:14:10] I went to first of all I could get ahead
[2:14:12] of myself I went to a specialist and I
[2:14:14] was 23 years old and uh it started
[2:14:17] macular degeneration in my right eye at
[2:14:19] 23 and they said hadn't seen it and
[2:14:21] somebody his youngest me before
[2:14:24] and they wanted to do steroid injections
[2:14:26] directly through my eyeball and and and
[2:14:29] just keep trying to pump up that nerve
[2:14:33] and
[2:14:34] um I'm not I wouldn't consider myself a
[2:14:36] man of great faith
[2:14:38] like I just I feel like it was almost
[2:14:41] just fear not really wanting to go
[2:14:43] through that
[2:14:45] yeah and I just I mean God prayed for
[2:14:49] and Lord Heal me like I had I would get
[2:14:52] headaches and stuff like that so I just
[2:14:54] didn't feel like I was completely healed
[2:14:56] you know and so I was you know in my own
[2:14:59] Pride probably not getting up not really
[2:15:01] testifying what the Lord had done
[2:15:03] and uh it kind of revisit here recently
[2:15:08] they would
[2:15:10] uh the military's coming through Within
[2:15:14] These whole another round of vaccines
[2:15:16] they want me to take and as high risk
[2:15:18] for blood clots so I kind of took a
[2:15:19] stand I didn't want to didn't want to
[2:15:21] lose vision again
[2:15:23] and um so uh just kind of held out held
[2:15:27] out don't want to do that they're going
[2:15:28] to kick me out so well they're like well
[2:15:30] go see an eye specialist we want to see
[2:15:32] and I hadn't after being prayed for I
[2:15:35] just was like I'm not going to see a
[2:15:37] specialist anymore I just that was it
[2:15:38] you know it was like 15 years ago I just
[2:15:41] I'm not going and and my vision I got a
[2:15:43] little headache so I'm going to live
[2:15:45] with it I'm just not going to see a
[2:15:46] specialist anymore just claim my healing
[2:15:48] I've been going back 15 years
[2:15:51] and what what brother Donnie said
[2:15:53] talking about leaving a scar
[2:15:55] and and you know that definitely I have
[2:15:58] a lot and this time I went to The
[2:16:01] Specialist here in Johnson City and
[2:16:02] looked he's like I can see you with a
[2:16:04] scar
[2:16:05] but your optic nerves completely healed
[2:16:08] you know
[2:16:10] so I still get headaches through it but
[2:16:12] I just really we need to stand on the
[2:16:15] Promises God's given us
[2:16:17] and just know that sometimes even those
[2:16:20] if the weakest of faith if we can claim
[2:16:23] it and just stand it doesn't matter what
[2:16:25] the devil says and I you know just
[2:16:29] actually was when uh sister Erica was
[2:16:31] just leaving the other day here she she
[2:16:32] just looked like she was in a lot of
[2:16:34] pain
[2:16:36] it was like my heart hurts for those of
[2:16:40] the saints that I see that the devil's
[2:16:42] coming against us
[2:16:45] we got to believe and pray for each
[2:16:47] other and really understand that even
[2:16:49] though our faith May the devil might lie
[2:16:52] to you and say you're not a great
[2:16:53] Christian but he said if the weakest of
[2:16:55] these will stand up Lord the demons who
[2:16:59] cry
[2:17:00] so I just fell I had to share that
[2:17:09] amen hallelujah
