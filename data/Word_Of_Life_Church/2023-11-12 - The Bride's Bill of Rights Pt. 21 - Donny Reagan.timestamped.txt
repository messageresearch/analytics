[45:45] amen
[45:49] baby let's Stand
[45:54] Together
[46:01] what a great thing children
[46:03] are I find it so amazing that our nation
[46:07] and the state that it's in financially
[46:12] terrible shape all types of things that
[46:15] are going on in the
[46:17] nation and yet by the way politics are
[46:22] going the most important thing today in
[46:25] many of the elections to many people are
[46:30] abortion it's not how much you're paying
[46:32] for gas it's not how high groceries
[46:36] are the most important thing is they're
[46:39] polling people as they come out of the
[46:41] exit poles and the way that they're
[46:43] voting it's so a woman can have a right
[46:47] to
[46:48] murder her
[46:53] baby that tells us where we are for
[46:56] friends we would have never thought our
[46:58] nation would have ever come to a place
[47:00] to where it is in so many ways we can
[47:03] see all the protest around different
[47:06] cities of America and around the world
[47:09] and people that are protesting for baby
[47:13] murderers Hamas I'm talking about can
[47:16] you imagine a human being taking a baby
[47:20] a live
[47:21] one turning up a gas oven
[47:26] and sticking a live baby a turkey I
[47:29] could see a ham a
[47:32] chicken a
[47:34] baby do you understand that's what
[47:36] happened to Israel just over a month
[47:38] ago taking babies and sticking them in
[47:41] the
[47:43] ovens cutting baby feet
[47:46] off decapitating human
[47:50] beings it's bad enough for them to do it
[47:53] and we've got hundreds and thousands of
[47:55] people all over the world they're saying
[47:58] they've got a right to do
[48:02] so and what's really sad about it is
[48:05] many of those people do not
[48:07] realize that if Sharia law would ever
[48:10] gain it won't we know that but if it
[48:12] would ever gain World dominance do you
[48:15] understand what the leaders of amas have
[48:16] said Israel is only the
[48:19] beginning they want to annihilate every
[48:24] Christian right right every one of
[48:29] them every
[48:31] Christian every
[48:34] Jew every
[48:36] homosexual you're a walking dead
[48:39] man or a dead
[48:42] woman you understand whenever Muhammad
[48:46] was convinced he took up for the Jews
[48:48] initially anybody ever read the Quran
[48:51] I've got
[48:52] one he called them the people of the
[48:55] book
[48:56] that was so until he went to
[48:58] Medina when he goes to
[49:01] Medina and meets with the Jews he's
[49:04] totally convinced they're going to
[49:05] receive him as a prophet and whenever he
[49:08] goes there the Jews say you're a false
[49:12] prophet cuz you ain't saying what Moses
[49:15] said you ain't saying what Jeremiah said
[49:18] oh my that's what started the conflict
[49:21] of the Muslims with the
[49:24] Jews why is it
[49:26] why is it they're the most hated people
[49:29] that have ever lived on the face of the
[49:31] Earth somebody say Amen well it's also
[49:36] the same way with the bride of Christ
[49:37] she's the most hated of all the
[49:39] religious that there is in the world but
[49:42] I'm so glad that there's a people that
[49:44] still got the right
[49:46] mind praise the Lord you know how
[49:49] blessed you are to be able to disagree
[49:51] with somebody and not want to kill
[49:53] them murder them
[49:57] praise the Lord that was my greeting to
[49:59] you today how y'all
[50:03] [Music]
[50:07] doing let's turn to the Book of Luke if
[50:09] you would today luk Luke chapter
[50:14] 8 verse
[50:17] 11 I love this Parable it's phenomenal
[50:22] Parable um May the Lord
[50:26] help us today as we look into his word
[50:29] Luke 8
[50:32] 8:1 now the parable is
[50:34] this the
[50:36] seed is the word of
[50:39] God those by the wayside or they that
[50:43] hear then cometh the
[50:46] devil and
[50:48] taketh away the
[50:50] word out of their
[50:54] hearts my goodness can you imagine a
[50:58] being that is so strong that a person
[51:02] can hear the
[51:03] truth and the word falls down into their
[51:06] hearts and the devil will come and
[51:10] actually take that word right out of
[51:13] their
[51:14] hearts but I want you knows Jesus when
[51:17] he interprets this Parable he does not
[51:18] say takes it out of people's
[51:22] Souls yeah only their hearts
[51:25] lest they should believe and be
[51:29] saved they on the Rock are they which
[51:33] when they
[51:34] hear receive the word with
[51:39] joy these people want to step further so
[51:43] they heard the word and they said that's
[51:45] awesome that is so good that's so
[51:48] wonderful oh I'm I'm going to I'm going
[51:50] to change my ways this is what I
[51:53] want now notice what can happen to
[51:56] when they hear receive the word with
[51:59] joy
[52:01] these have no
[52:04] root which for a
[52:07] while
[52:09] believe how many have we seen down
[52:12] through the
[52:13] years and in time of
[52:17] Temptation
[52:18] fall
[52:21] away that which fell among the Thorns
[52:24] are they which when they have heard go
[52:28] forth and are
[52:30] choked with
[52:32] cares and riches and pleasures of this
[52:37] life and bring forth no
[52:41] fruit to Perfection I want you notice
[52:44] these now the devil doesn't exactly take
[52:46] it out of them completely but they just
[52:49] never become a fruitful Christian they
[52:52] hold a profession but they don't have it
[52:55] any fruit to
[52:57] Perfection verse 15 I hope every person
[53:00] here today is verse 15 am but that on
[53:04] the good
[53:06] ground that in amazing Jesus does not
[53:09] differentiate between the
[53:11] seed what he differentiates between is
[53:15] the ground where the seed
[53:18] landed not the seed but where the seed
[53:21] landed but that on the good ground are
[53:24] they which in an
[53:26] honest and good
[53:29] heart having heard the word notice what
[53:33] they do now so they hear
[53:35] it and they keep it and bring forth
[53:41] fruit with
[53:43] patience praise the Lord so they hear it
[53:48] they keep it and they bring forth fruit
[53:53] with patience so even even fruit bearing
[53:56] is not
[53:58] enough it has to be fruit bearing with
[54:03] patience so I'd like to speak to you
[54:05] this morning for a little bit on a life
[54:09] filled with
[54:11] patience and may love to be remembered
[54:15] today heavenly father as we approach you
[54:18] Lord
[54:20] Jesus it's been said now for
[54:23] millennium that the Lord is
[54:26] coming it's been said in sermons and
[54:29] songs it's been talked about by millions
[54:32] and millions of people for the last
[54:35] 2,000 years Jesus is going to come back
[54:39] but we believe we are closer than any
[54:43] other
[54:44] generation to that actually
[54:46] happening we look about us we see the
[54:49] signs
[54:50] everywhere we see the spiritual Darkness
[54:53] that's upon the Nations the gross
[54:56] darkness that is upon the people father
[54:59] we are so grateful for the evening light
[55:03] that was promised to be here may you
[55:06] help each of us
[55:07] today father as the word Goes Forth may
[55:11] it land on good
[55:15] ground Lord Jesus may we bring forth
[55:18] that
[55:19] word with patience may fruit come out of
[55:23] our lives fruit that will produce a body
[55:27] change help me to get out of the way
[55:30] Lord I need you speak through us your
[55:33] words of life I pray in Jesus name and
[55:37] the Saints said amen amen God bless you
[55:40] you may be
[55:47] seated what a great thing patience is
[55:51] how many's got a whole bunch of
[55:54] it
[55:55] [Music]
[55:57] and he's got a little a little
[56:00] bit I was standing not long ago at the
[56:04] Carter County
[56:05] Bank and the lady there that was waiting
[56:10] on me said you have to excuse me
[56:11] preacher it's what she calls me preacher
[56:14] cuz uh we've got a lot going on today
[56:17] and uh I'm I'm pretty impatient now this
[56:20] is a Christian woman and uh I said well
[56:23] you know what the Bible says don't ma'am
[56:25] and she said well about what and I said
[56:27] about
[56:28] patience I said the Bible says
[56:30] tribulation worketh patience patience
[56:33] experience experience hope and hope
[56:37] maketh not asham because the love of God
[56:40] is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[56:42] Ghost which is given unto us but
[56:45] whenever I was talking to her another
[56:46] teller walked up and said what did you
[56:48] just say so I went back to that verse
[56:50] again in Romans and quoted it her again
[56:52] well there's another one come over and
[56:54] one wanted to hear the same thing so I
[56:56] had a little Bible teaching there at the
[56:59] cter county
[57:00] bank and she said the lady I was talking
[57:03] to initially said oh Lord I'm not sure I
[57:07] need to ask for patience more
[57:09] then but really patience is not
[57:12] something that we will get by asking for
[57:15] it it's not something like healing or
[57:17] another petition that we place before
[57:20] God and we say God I need patience and
[57:22] then tomorrow it's in the mail or next
[57:25] week God actually just lets it drop out
[57:28] of Heaven to you but patience is one of
[57:30] the Divine Graces that come from the
[57:33] attributes of God which is something
[57:35] molded deep within the child of God by
[57:38] their walk the Holy Ghost comes of of
[57:41] course we know by us receiving him and
[57:46] him actually receiving us he seals us to
[57:49] the day of our
[57:51] Redemption healing can be instantaneous
[57:54] many things God can do for us that are
[57:57] instant but patience is not one of them
[58:00] patience is something that comes by
[58:03] testing and trying the Lord Jesus
[58:07] knowing now the gospel is going to be
[58:10] sown Luke writes this a little bit
[58:12] different than Matthew does as far as
[58:15] the parable but I love the way that Luke
[58:17] words it in that he picks the category
[58:21] of the earth and he shows how that
[58:23] people will able to hear he give us many
[58:27] parables about the seed that was going
[58:29] to be sown he likened it to a fisherman
[58:32] that would go out and cast a big net and
[58:35] whenever the fisherman would go to
[58:37] drawing in he had no idea what I was in
[58:40] the net but they would just start
[58:42] pulling it and they would pull and Pull
[58:45] and then they' pull them in the boat
[58:48] they would find eels they would find all
[58:50] types of things that by the levitical
[58:53] law Jews could not eat so they would
[58:56] throw them back in they couldn't eat an
[58:57] eel throw it back in shellfish throw it
[59:01] back in all kinds of things they could
[59:04] not eat so he likened the gospel and the
[59:07] kingdom to being like a fisherman so
[59:10] whenever he spoke in Parables and it
[59:13] must have been very confusing to some
[59:15] because the Bible says even the
[59:17] disciples when they were along with
[59:18] Jesus they said what does this mean we
[59:21] we don't understand so is the setting of
[59:24] Luke 8
[59:25] so they asked Jesus what did you mean by
[59:28] this because he said the Kingdom of
[59:30] Heaven is liken unto a sour so a s one
[59:33] forth to sew his sea so you imagine now
[59:35] this is the way they did it in their day
[59:37] they would take him by hand and they
[59:39] would sew the seed so they'd walk about
[59:42] and they would sew the seeds here and
[59:43] there Jesus knew they were all aware of
[59:46] that so he said that's the way you're
[59:48] fixing to start preaching preaching is
[59:51] like that so you will start sewing the
[59:54] seed now you don't know who is there you
[59:57] don't know who's got good ground and who
[59:59] don't that ain't none of your business
[1:00:01] you just seow so you're going to go out
[1:00:04] and you're going to start sewing and
[1:00:06] there'll be some my they'll respond
[1:00:09] they'll say praise God I've been
[1:00:12] searching and looking my whole life for
[1:00:15] an answer to all my
[1:00:17] problems and a lot of people are and
[1:00:20] they will hear that and it does
[1:00:22] something to them and it really moves
[1:00:24] and they say my goodness I believe this
[1:00:27] is the this is the answer to all of my
[1:00:29] life's problems and they'll receive it
[1:00:33] some of them and others of them it lays
[1:00:36] right there oh I've heard that all my
[1:00:38] life I've heard about religion I've
[1:00:40] heard this and that and while they're
[1:00:42] pondering over it and thinking about it
[1:00:45] the birds will fly over and the birds
[1:00:48] will see
[1:00:50] it so the bird gets his eye on that seed
[1:00:53] and he goes down and he picks it right
[1:00:55] up from the person before they ever walk
[1:00:58] out the door and they walk out the door
[1:01:00] what' you think about the service I've
[1:01:03] heard that before man I ain't got time
[1:01:05] for no religion I know some of them
[1:01:07] people that go to that church there's
[1:01:09] Hypocrites that go there we don't deny
[1:01:12] that but we're hoping they'll get
[1:01:15] saved we don't deny it you don't let
[1:01:17] that stop you from going to Walmart do
[1:01:19] you well if you go to Walmart there
[1:01:22] Hypocrites there some of you is going to
[1:01:23] go to restaurant after a while you're
[1:01:25] going to be served by gay people is that
[1:01:27] going to stop you from eating you're
[1:01:29] going to be served by Hypocrites and
[1:01:31] Devils is that going to stop you no it's
[1:01:33] the same way about coming to the house
[1:01:35] of God there's there's ill people that
[1:01:37] walk through them doors there's some sad
[1:01:40] people that walk through them doors but
[1:01:42] there's some good people that walk
[1:01:43] through them doors too so the thing of
[1:01:46] it is are you going to let what we're
[1:01:48] handing out be hindered by the people
[1:01:50] that come in or are you going to say I'm
[1:01:53] going there not to take count of the
[1:01:55] Hypocrites I'm not going there to watch
[1:01:57] this one or that one I'm going there to
[1:01:59] be changed myself that's the way we need
[1:02:02] to look at it now some whenever they
[1:02:04] hear it you know they just don't it
[1:02:06] doesn't really spark hard anything at
[1:02:08] all others Jesus said they'll hear it
[1:02:11] and they'll receive the word as Matthew
[1:02:13] says Anon Anon with joy and M they are
[1:02:17] so happy and it actually starts doing
[1:02:20] something for them and they'll let
[1:02:22] things go they'll let go of this and
[1:02:24] that I had a terrible temper I had a
[1:02:26] really bad habit and God changed me and
[1:02:29] boy they're just so happy and people can
[1:02:32] look around and say can you get over him
[1:02:35] can you get over her how she is so
[1:02:38] changed and then Trouble
[1:02:41] Comes tribulation
[1:02:44] comes and they say I didn't realize
[1:02:47] being a Christian was going to be so
[1:02:50] hard I didn't know people would laugh at
[1:02:52] you I didn't know that you'd go through
[1:02:55] trials and tests like this
[1:02:57] before well I'll tell you you
[1:03:00] will you see the devil is the type of
[1:03:04] King that wants everyone to come into
[1:03:06] his kingdom but what he does he hides
[1:03:10] their Destiny he hides the end result if
[1:03:15] Satan would be honest and show every one
[1:03:17] of us five minutes in the regions of the
[1:03:23] Lost
[1:03:25] we would feel the darkness penetrating
[1:03:28] our
[1:03:29] souls we would hear the screams the
[1:03:32] hollers the crying of the Damned and the
[1:03:38] doomed and we would see them demon
[1:03:41] Spirits haunting people and as you
[1:03:44] arrive they come up to you and go
[1:03:51] oooo and you're looking for Mama but but
[1:03:54] there ain't no Mama you're looking for
[1:03:56] Daddy and there ain't no
[1:03:59] Daddy if he would let us see just a
[1:04:01] couple of minutes I guarantee you this
[1:04:04] altar would be filled with people but he
[1:04:07] ain't going to show you that he wants to
[1:04:09] keep the end result of your choice in
[1:04:12] choosing him away from you until it's
[1:04:16] too late but you see the Lord Jesus
[1:04:19] ain't like that Jesus will let you know
[1:04:22] if you come after me people's going to
[1:04:24] hate you if you come after me people
[1:04:27] will make fun of you people will despise
[1:04:30] you you know why he has nothing to hide
[1:04:33] the Lord Jesus wants you to know that
[1:04:36] you'll be name will be cast out as evil
[1:04:39] people will make fun of you in life
[1:04:40] because he wants you to serve him with
[1:04:43] all of your heart but he wants you to
[1:04:45] know this is not the easy way this is
[1:04:49] the straight and the narrow and that's
[1:04:51] what makes the people of God so out
[1:04:54] understanding they look at Satan and his
[1:04:56] choices and they see that he's hiding
[1:04:59] the real he's hiding the real depths of
[1:05:02] what they will get Satan hides that from
[1:05:04] his people but the Lord Jesus shows them
[1:05:07] exactly many of the things of life and
[1:05:10] yet they choose and he said oh I love
[1:05:12] them so much they chose me in spite of
[1:05:15] all the things I told them would come
[1:05:18] their way but Satan can't do that but
[1:05:21] you see the Lord set forth and finally
[1:05:24] he brings the last category into this
[1:05:27] Parable and that was those that would be
[1:05:30] able to receive the seed word in the
[1:05:33] good ground of their hearts now he said
[1:05:35] on the good ground are they which in an
[1:05:38] honest and good heart I wonder how in
[1:05:41] the world that's even
[1:05:42] possible since the same Lord Jesus said
[1:05:45] there is none good no non
[1:05:48] one how in the world could he say
[1:05:51] anybody would have an honest and a good
[1:05:54] heart unless the power of transformation
[1:05:58] had already started working on their
[1:06:00] heart and it was a soil that was
[1:06:04] predetermined to receive the
[1:06:07] seed now that within itself was
[1:06:10] wonderful but I want you to notice how
[1:06:12] it goes on which in an honest and a good
[1:06:14] heart having heard the word now that
[1:06:17] part doesn't make them any different
[1:06:20] than the rest of the people but they
[1:06:22] heard it and they kept it unlike the
[1:06:26] person that the birds come through
[1:06:28] picked it up unlike the other person
[1:06:31] that they received it for a while and
[1:06:33] then the things of the world got in the
[1:06:34] way and the other stage of the people
[1:06:37] that the pleasures of life The Riches of
[1:06:39] Life the things of life and you know he
[1:06:42] didn't say that the birds took it but
[1:06:45] actually the weeds choked it out so the
[1:06:49] weeds are the difficulties of life and
[1:06:52] the trials and the things you go through
[1:06:54] through and the weeds grew up and grew
[1:06:56] up and got bigger and bigger and
[1:06:59] stronger and stronger and actually
[1:07:01] wrapped their tentacles as it were
[1:07:03] around the word and begin to choke the
[1:07:06] very life right out of the
[1:07:11] word and before long that person said I
[1:07:14] don't know what's happened to me I used
[1:07:15] to love to go to church I used to love
[1:07:17] to read my Bible and I used to love to
[1:07:19] pray but seemed like I just don't I
[1:07:22] don't find pleasure in it anymore more
[1:07:24] it ain't no wonder the things of Life
[1:07:27] have choked out the word and the word
[1:07:37] is and the word
[1:07:40] dies in their
[1:07:44] hearts but Jesus said this category of
[1:07:47] people hear it and they keep it they go
[1:07:51] to church of course and and they get
[1:07:54] hold
[1:07:55] on so the preacher gets up there and he
[1:07:58] goes to grubbing around a little bit
[1:07:59] over here and he'll grub around a little
[1:08:01] bit over there and you know a lot of
[1:08:04] folks don't mind that as long as he's
[1:08:05] grubbing around you or you just don't
[1:08:09] touch them now every one of us need to
[1:08:11] be grubbed around don't we why because
[1:08:14] it's just something about nature wonder
[1:08:16] who puts Miracle Grow on the morning
[1:08:19] glories wonder who puts Miracle Grow on
[1:08:22] all the weeds of you that have a garden
[1:08:25] isn't it amazing you till it you you
[1:08:27] disc it you do everything and you plant
[1:08:29] the rose and you put your h on beans and
[1:08:32] you put your sweet corn and your maters
[1:08:34] and your ters and your watermelons and
[1:08:37] all that out of there and then you go to
[1:08:38] look in and there wasn't nothing out
[1:08:40] there and all of a sudden here come
[1:08:41] Johnson grass and here come this grass
[1:08:44] and that grass and you're out there a
[1:08:46] chopping and a hoing and a carrying on
[1:08:48] who in the world Waters them who in the
[1:08:50] world puts that Miracle Grow on them and
[1:08:52] makes them grow it's actually in the
[1:08:55] dirt itself and yet if you don't take
[1:08:58] care of that you have just wasted your
[1:09:01] money and buying them seeds you've
[1:09:03] wasted your money and planting them is
[1:09:05] that right so if you're going to get a
[1:09:07] garden you're going to have to work at
[1:09:09] it right it's the same way with our walk
[1:09:12] with God but many folks want God to do
[1:09:15] it all and they say well that's why we
[1:09:16] pay the preacher so the preacher can do
[1:09:19] the praying and the preacher can do this
[1:09:21] and that and the other well I do that I
[1:09:24] do pray I do read my Bible I study I do
[1:09:27] what I can to bring you the fruit of the
[1:09:29] word of God but if you don't chop around
[1:09:32] your own life as well it ain't going to
[1:09:34] do you a whole lot of
[1:09:36] good but this category of people what
[1:09:39] they do they hear the word and they keep
[1:09:42] the word and they bring forth fruit now
[1:09:44] what is the fruit the fruit is the stage
[1:09:47] of the word once it comes into fruition
[1:09:50] in other words it does not stay there in
[1:09:53] Word form you see a life lived by the
[1:09:56] word is the word expressed so the Lord
[1:10:00] Jesus didn't come to the Earth just so
[1:10:02] that he could have a bunch of Bibles
[1:10:04] that would be published and would hand
[1:10:06] out Bibles to everybody and then
[1:10:08] everybody that would have a Bible would
[1:10:10] be the word made manifest that's not the
[1:10:12] way it works it's actually when you hear
[1:10:14] the word you receive the word then the
[1:10:17] word comes into your soul and becomes
[1:10:20] quickened by the power of God then when
[1:10:23] it does does that word transforms and
[1:10:26] changes itself into the fruit stage of
[1:10:30] the word not many people all they do is
[1:10:32] read the word listen tapes read your
[1:10:34] Bible whatever it is and they discuss it
[1:10:36] and they talk about it and they just go
[1:10:38] on and on and on how wonderful the word
[1:10:41] is but it's never changed from word
[1:10:45] stage to fruit stage so what is the
[1:10:48] fruit the manifestation of that promised
[1:10:51] word that lives out in a human human
[1:10:53] being's life and somebody said that's
[1:10:56] what he's coming for is when the word
[1:10:59] becomes fruit just like you if you only
[1:11:02] want two or three grains of corn why
[1:11:05] plant your garden why not just eat the
[1:11:07] seeds that you do why not eat your high
[1:11:09] rer bean seeds why do you do that cuz
[1:11:12] you want more don't you so you take one
[1:11:15] little pack and you plant a row and
[1:11:17] another row and another row because you
[1:11:20] want more that's what God wanted God did
[1:11:22] not want just one perfect son if he did
[1:11:26] he should have never let the Lord Jesus
[1:11:28] die but the Lord Jesus came so that he
[1:11:31] could plant a row and another row and
[1:11:34] another row and another row and bring
[1:11:36] forth Sons and Daughters of God all over
[1:11:39] the Earth which is exactly what's
[1:11:41] happening then with that notice the way
[1:11:44] Jesus says it that they will bring forth
[1:11:47] fruit with patience now what is patience
[1:11:51] well you know people look at and say
[1:11:53] well I I'm a man of very great patience
[1:11:55] it it runs as a nature in my family well
[1:11:58] that's not the patience we're talking
[1:11:59] about some people are truly more patient
[1:12:02] than others but this is not nature given
[1:12:06] by the natural births it is actually
[1:12:09] something that is cultured and grown by
[1:12:12] God himself but God doesn't use
[1:12:15] blessings to do it God does not use just
[1:12:18] signs wonders and miracles even though
[1:12:20] we believe in that but yet patience does
[1:12:23] not come by Miracles patience does not
[1:12:27] come by healing or by shouting or by
[1:12:33] rejoicing it comes by
[1:12:36] tests notice the prophet mentions this
[1:12:39] about about Noah in the Statue of a
[1:12:42] perfect man he said Noah had patience
[1:12:44] yeah Noah had real Godly patience God
[1:12:47] said I'm going to destroy this world
[1:12:48] with rain Noah preached 120 years at it
[1:12:52] plenty of patience he said not even do
[1:12:54] fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as
[1:12:57] Dusty As It Ever Was for 120 years but
[1:13:02] he was patient don't notice patience now
[1:13:06] Godly patience that Noah said it's going
[1:13:08] to rain and he does it for 120 years and
[1:13:11] after that 120 years it was just as dry
[1:13:15] as it was when Noah first started notice
[1:13:18] he said what God will do now just as
[1:13:21] dust As It Ever Was for 120 years but he
[1:13:23] was patient then God tries your patience
[1:13:28] so for 120 years God is working on this
[1:13:33] man's patience so no results nobody got
[1:13:37] saved other than his family nobody come
[1:13:40] oh if they did come they'd laugh at him
[1:13:42] make fun of him but had no converts at
[1:13:45] all not one so he has his sons and his
[1:13:49] sons wives and that's all that's the
[1:13:51] very ones he started with so so he
[1:13:53] didn't really wind up with anymore than
[1:13:55] what he started so with patience he
[1:13:57] preaches and preaches now remember he's
[1:14:00] he's building this big boat too so he's
[1:14:02] working and he's preaching and he's
[1:14:04] preaching and he's working so what is
[1:14:07] God doing God is building this man's
[1:14:09] patience now building and trying a
[1:14:12] patience is not even the same thing so
[1:14:15] God is building his patience now God's
[1:14:18] going to try his patience now watch this
[1:14:21] he says actually told
[1:14:23] I want you to go ahead and get in the
[1:14:25] ark I'm going to run the animals in
[1:14:27] there and I want you to get in climb way
[1:14:29] upstairs now so you can look at the top
[1:14:32] window now I want you to get in there
[1:14:34] what he tell these people tomorrow I've
[1:14:36] been preaching for 120 years it's going
[1:14:38] to take place now what's God doing so
[1:14:41] for seven days he sets inside the ark
[1:14:44] what's that for God trying his patience
[1:14:47] to see if Noah will lose patience in the
[1:14:50] promised word of the message of the hour
[1:14:54] cuz it seems like nothing has happened
[1:14:57] except he's built this great big
[1:14:59] gigantic boat and now he's got all them
[1:15:02] animals in there with him and when he
[1:15:04] got in God shut the
[1:15:07] door no he didn't shut the door the
[1:15:09] animals didn't shut the door God shut
[1:15:11] the door and he sat there day one day
[1:15:13] two day three on through day seven so
[1:15:15] what is God doing for seven days he is
[1:15:19] now trying the patience of this man that
[1:15:22] already proved that he had patience but
[1:15:25] patience that cannot be tried is not
[1:15:28] deemed
[1:15:31] Godly praise the Lord notice David in
[1:15:35] Psalms
[1:15:36] 37:7 rest in the Lord and wait patiently
[1:15:41] for him I love the way that the writers
[1:15:43] of the scripture would do and they would
[1:15:45] State a fact and then they would kind of
[1:15:48] go to a paradoxical side of it in other
[1:15:50] words they would come with something
[1:15:52] that would be contrasting this is what
[1:15:55] David does rest in the Lord and wait
[1:15:57] patiently for him fret not thyself
[1:16:00] because of him who prosper in his way
[1:16:05] now watch what patience will do patience
[1:16:08] will look at the promise of God and it
[1:16:10] will wait on God to be able to fulfill
[1:16:13] his word and while you may be going
[1:16:15] through hard times in your life and
[1:16:17] struggling you look around at the wicked
[1:16:20] and you can see that the wicked seem to
[1:16:22] have it a lot easier than you do as a
[1:16:24] child of God David made faced this so
[1:16:28] many times and he said look at the
[1:16:30] ungodly how can the ungodly Prosper the
[1:16:34] way they do he said they spread forth
[1:16:36] their leaves as a Green Bay Tree and he
[1:16:39] said look at the righteous how they go
[1:16:41] through such difficulty and David this
[1:16:44] question was still unanswered by the
[1:16:46] time that David comes here but he's
[1:16:48] found a little bit of inside to be able
[1:16:50] to say rest in the Lord and wait pay
[1:16:53] patiently for him threet not thyself
[1:16:56] because of him who prosperes in his own
[1:17:00] way now notice what David saw he saw a
[1:17:03] servant of God that loved the Lord and
[1:17:05] the Lord wouldn't let him go this way or
[1:17:07] that way couldn't do as he pleased had
[1:17:09] to obey the Lord and seemed like he had
[1:17:11] such a hard time but he watched The
[1:17:14] Wicked and they could do whatever they
[1:17:16] wanted to do and it seemed like they
[1:17:18] prospered every way they turned they was
[1:17:21] never tried they was never tested it
[1:17:24] seemed like whatever they touched was
[1:17:26] just blessed and David said God I don't
[1:17:30] understand I don't understand but he
[1:17:32] come to at least this recognition that
[1:17:35] we have to wait patiently on the Lord
[1:17:37] how many needs help to wait patiently on
[1:17:40] the Lord Psalm 40 and one to the chief
[1:17:44] musician a Psalm of David I waited
[1:17:47] patiently for the Lord he inclined unto
[1:17:51] me and heard My Cry notice how patience
[1:17:55] now is tied to a son or daughter of God
[1:17:58] waiting for an answer a manifestation of
[1:18:01] a real need in your life and you're
[1:18:03] crying and you're praying and it seemed
[1:18:05] like God is not hearing you again New
[1:18:08] Testament Luke CH 21: 19 what a
[1:18:11] Paramount scripture this is in your
[1:18:15] patience possess ye wow your
[1:18:21] souls
[1:18:24] in your patience notice Jesus doesn't
[1:18:27] say in my
[1:18:29] patience but in your patience
[1:18:33] possess ye your souls this is one of
[1:18:37] your rights children to have a life full
[1:18:41] of Godly patience I know it's hard on us
[1:18:44] we got instant coffee we got instant
[1:18:47] potatoes we got instant warm-up meals
[1:18:49] from microwaves we got instant
[1:18:51] drive-thru and you know how them are
[1:18:53] they ain't instant either you just get
[1:18:56] to a place to where you tell them go
[1:18:57] ahead and give me what you want to
[1:18:58] you're gone to anyway he go s and get a
[1:19:01] Big Mac and you get a Burger King
[1:19:02] Whopper you think how in the world is
[1:19:04] that possible for
[1:19:05] McDonald's you order a ham and egg
[1:19:07] biscuit and they wind up giving you a
[1:19:09] bone and cheese I mean you saying how in
[1:19:11] the world could this happen but God has
[1:19:15] a way of trying his people in an instant
[1:19:18] fast age so a man gets saved today by
[1:19:22] next week he feels like he's called to
[1:19:24] preach and he wants to start him a
[1:19:26] church huh a man sings In A Honky Tonk
[1:19:28] one week and next week he gets saved and
[1:19:31] we get him up on the platform and let
[1:19:32] him start singing and picking his guitar
[1:19:34] don't even let him be tried a little bit
[1:19:36] come on don't get quiet on me and yet we
[1:19:39] realize God has not changed at all in
[1:19:42] the way that he makes Christians God
[1:19:44] still makes Christians the same way that
[1:19:47] he made the first one the slow tried
[1:19:51] process and boy it's hard pardon us lay
[1:19:53] of sins now watch in your PA patience
[1:19:57] possess ye your soul now this is the way
[1:20:00] you and I are going to possess our souls
[1:20:04] by patiently bearing all afflictions
[1:20:08] reproaches indignities shame
[1:20:12] humiliation
[1:20:14] persecution let nothing disturb or
[1:20:17] distress you even when God will say no
[1:20:20] and you ask him fervently God I need
[1:20:23] this God please move this way please God
[1:20:26] and yet sometimes God will say yes
[1:20:28] sometimes God says no and sometimes God
[1:20:31] says wait a
[1:20:32] while oh I never did like that
[1:20:36] word I find it amazing you have a
[1:20:39] doctor's appointment at 10:00 in the
[1:20:41] morning at 10:15 you're still sitting
[1:20:44] there watching at 10:20 you're watching
[1:20:47] now don't raise your hands but how many
[1:20:49] of you by 10:30 have already gotten mad
[1:20:51] and left the doctor office but it
[1:20:54] depends on how sick you are some of you
[1:20:56] would sit there as Carol and I did a
[1:20:58] while ago not too long back to where
[1:21:00] that we went to see a heart doctor you
[1:21:02] know just to get a checkup and all that
[1:21:04] sort of thing 30 minutes passed 45
[1:21:07] minutes passed an hour passed an hour
[1:21:09] and a half past they finally come out
[1:21:10] and said you know what we've had a
[1:21:12] little bit of delay y'all want to
[1:21:13] reschedule we said well we done cleaned
[1:21:15] up and dressed up we might as well just
[1:21:17] wait so we sat there and waited and
[1:21:19] waited but I thought I wonder how many
[1:21:21] people would be willing to wait on a
[1:21:23] preacher to talk to him that long they'd
[1:21:26] get mad at a hornet and go to another
[1:21:27] church while I tried to talk to him for
[1:21:30] 5 minutes and he was so busy he wouldn't
[1:21:32] even have time but the real people of
[1:21:35] God are an example of divine patience
[1:21:39] because they will knock and they will
[1:21:42] knock come on somebody say Amen a real
[1:21:45] son or daughter of God but puts their
[1:21:48] need and their situation and their
[1:21:50] problems into the hands of Jesus and
[1:21:53] they tell him Lord I hope you like
[1:21:54] looking at my face because I ain't
[1:21:56] leaving until I get what I have needed
[1:22:00] if I get it today that's fine if I don't
[1:22:02] get it today I'll get it next week but
[1:22:04] however long it takes is exactly what
[1:22:07] I'm going to do now want you notice in
[1:22:09] so there's something about Divinity that
[1:22:12] God Blends into the measuring and the
[1:22:15] making of this type of thing why because
[1:22:18] God himself is called the god of
[1:22:23] patience is that amazing he's not called
[1:22:26] the god of money he's not called the god
[1:22:29] of many things that we love and many
[1:22:32] things that we fill our lives with yet
[1:22:35] he's called in the Bible the god of
[1:22:39] patience so there is a Godly patience
[1:22:42] that we must have acts 14: 211 and when
[1:22:45] they had preached the gospel to that
[1:22:47] City and it taught many they returned
[1:22:50] again to lisra and to Iconium and
[1:22:53] Antioch confirming the souls of the
[1:22:55] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:22:59] in the faith now listen to the apostolic
[1:23:01] way that we must through much
[1:23:05] tribulation enter into the kingdom of
[1:23:09] God notice the word tribulation the
[1:23:12] lipsus Affliction trouble anguish
[1:23:16] pressing pressing together pressure how
[1:23:19] many feels pressure in the age we're
[1:23:21] living or press
[1:23:23] and distress so you mean this is the way
[1:23:26] we enter into the kingdom of God well
[1:23:28] where's the easy believism that is so
[1:23:32] preached among so many in the day that
[1:23:34] we live in that you just do whatever you
[1:23:36] want to do and well if you want to go to
[1:23:37] church it's okay if you don't it don't
[1:23:39] really matter you know if you want to
[1:23:40] live right it don't really matter where
[1:23:42] does that come from from the Bible that
[1:23:44] is not in the Bible notice now this is
[1:23:48] what the apostolic Doctrine was in the
[1:23:51] book of Acts so look at it again maybe
[1:23:53] on Wednesday night confirming the souls
[1:23:55] of the disciples and exhorting them to
[1:23:58] continue in the faith that we must
[1:24:00] through much tribulation enter into the
[1:24:05] kingdom of God Romans 5:3 and not only
[1:24:08] so but we
[1:24:10] Glory oh my goodness we glory in
[1:24:16] Tribulation how many needs
[1:24:18] help how many needs help with this
[1:24:21] scripture
[1:24:24] not only so but we glory in Tribulation
[1:24:28] also knowing that
[1:24:31] tribulation worketh
[1:24:34] patience so what is patience in
[1:24:37] endurance under trials without
[1:24:41] sustaining loss or
[1:24:45] deterioration urance under
[1:24:48] trials without sustaining loss or under
[1:24:52] deterioration so in other words it's
[1:24:54] when you and I are going through
[1:24:57] something that is so trying oh but
[1:24:59] that's my faith yes Faith coupled with
[1:25:02] patience Faith believes he will move but
[1:25:06] patience will wait it out right you see
[1:25:09] people can lose their faith and they
[1:25:11] don't understand why it's because they
[1:25:14] don't emphasize and realize the
[1:25:16] importance of patience coupled together
[1:25:18] with faith what is faith faith is the
[1:25:20] substance of things so forth the
[1:25:22] evidence of Things Not Seen but we must
[1:25:25] have patience coupled with faith in
[1:25:28] order to bring a during promise to pass
[1:25:33] now what happens many people will begin
[1:25:35] to deteriorate they ask God oh God I
[1:25:38] need this God I want that God please
[1:25:40] move and they ask and they ask and they
[1:25:43] think well what in the world happened I
[1:25:44] don't understand what's going on well
[1:25:46] maybe God is trying your patient now you
[1:25:49] see it's not so much for God's benefit
[1:25:52] it's for our own it's to help us to see
[1:25:55] either we don't have much or we've got a
[1:25:58] little and he wants us to have much and
[1:26:01] the test is the only thing that will
[1:26:04] tell you wouldn't it be so
[1:26:06] nice that this morning each of us could
[1:26:09] walk up on a patience
[1:26:12] scale we'd walk up and we'd plant our
[1:26:14] feet we'd stand right there and now
[1:26:16] stand still and then the needle goes up
[1:26:18] and said
[1:26:20] wo wow you're about to blow the needle
[1:26:24] oh my
[1:26:27] goodness or I wonder if we would walk up
[1:26:30] on it and the needle barely moved and
[1:26:32] the needle said was that a fly that come
[1:26:34] through was that a speck of
[1:26:38] dust and then Dr God says now tell what
[1:26:41] I'm going to do I'm going to write you a
[1:26:42] script we're a script age aren't we I'm
[1:26:45] going to write you a script go by
[1:26:46] Walgreens CVS wherever it is and you
[1:26:48] just pick this up it should be done
[1:26:49] within 30 minutes or so you take these
[1:26:51] three times a day and by the end of 30
[1:26:54] days I promise you you will have so much
[1:26:57] patience why your wife can burn your
[1:26:59] toast every day she can fry your eggs
[1:27:01] when she knows you don't want them fried
[1:27:03] you don't want them over easy you want
[1:27:05] and it won't even bother you the kids
[1:27:08] will raise their voice the preacher will
[1:27:10] Stomp all over your toes and you won't
[1:27:12] even get mad no more Brother Lou will
[1:27:14] sing a song and he knows you don't like
[1:27:17] that song and you'll sit right there and
[1:27:18] before you know it you'll start smiling
[1:27:20] like a posle and you'll go to in your
[1:27:22] hand glory to God I love that song I
[1:27:24] love that song within 30 days you will
[1:27:27] have the most abundance of patience
[1:27:29] you've ever seen in your
[1:27:33] life how we
[1:27:37] wish but instead God looks at us and
[1:27:39] said Brad
[1:27:41] Gilbert you need more
[1:27:44] patience Paul Arwood oh you've got that
[1:27:47] million dollar smile but you ain't got
[1:27:49] near enough patience
[1:27:51] boy
[1:27:56] so God will let trouble and difficulty
[1:28:00] of course you know what trouble does to
[1:28:02] us praying people we pray we pray more
[1:28:05] yes don't we we we pray more we ask God
[1:28:07] for
[1:28:08] more and we ask God for his help and his
[1:28:12] intervention and then we look at where
[1:28:14] we are and we think God what's a matter
[1:28:16] with me I've asked and I've asked and
[1:28:18] I've asked in faith believe you is there
[1:28:19] a reason Lord there's something in my
[1:28:21] life it's the second phase the coupling
[1:28:24] together of your faith with your
[1:28:27] patience God is trying you to see will
[1:28:31] you lose some of what you have if he
[1:28:35] stretches it
[1:28:39] out and he doesn't answer as soon as you
[1:28:43] thought and what's amazing
[1:28:46] is he may answer somebody else's prayer
[1:28:49] n the same
[1:28:51] prayer
[1:28:52] and they'll get it so
[1:28:55] soon and they don't even live half as
[1:28:57] good as you
[1:29:00] do as a matter of fact I sat the other
[1:29:02] day talking to a
[1:29:04] businessman he was telling me about
[1:29:06] Erica's
[1:29:07] funeral he went to our
[1:29:10] website saw the service complimenting
[1:29:13] the ministers and the service and never
[1:29:15] seen anything like it never heard
[1:29:16] anything like it he said then I went to
[1:29:19] your website and I heard the C you
[1:29:22] preached on
[1:29:25] why and he went to tell me that he had a
[1:29:27] brother that had passed with
[1:29:31] Co and there was another preacher that
[1:29:34] had come to their Church his brother was
[1:29:35] a pastor actually and there was a
[1:29:38] preacher that come to their church and
[1:29:40] this preacher also had
[1:29:42] coid but he
[1:29:44] lived and they said he sister-in-law
[1:29:47] which heard the testimony of this man
[1:29:49] that God moved for
[1:29:52] and he throwed her in one of the
[1:29:53] greatest battles of her
[1:29:56] life because his testimony brought a
[1:29:59] negative reaction to her and she
[1:30:02] couldn't understand if God would heal
[1:30:04] that man why didn't heal her
[1:30:07] husband why did God take her husband
[1:30:10] which was also a preacher and let this
[1:30:13] man
[1:30:14] live so you see whenever we don't
[1:30:18] understand things it can certainly try
[1:30:22] our patience and we're waiting and we're
[1:30:24] waiting and if you're not careful you'll
[1:30:26] find yourself almost resentful toward
[1:30:29] God for healing this person of this
[1:30:32] situation and you had a dear friend that
[1:30:34] died with the same thing yeah and then
[1:30:37] you go to questioning you see what's
[1:30:39] happening is that under this your face
[1:30:43] is
[1:30:45] deteriorated your patience is actually
[1:30:48] breaking up and you're struggling
[1:30:50] because why you don't understand but you
[1:30:54] see faith will hold on even when your
[1:30:57] understanding is unfruitful right
[1:30:59] somebody said amen and we will sustain
[1:31:04] loss during this so This is actually the
[1:31:07] word that Paul used was a metaphor that
[1:31:10] was used for refining
[1:31:12] Metals gold silver brass bronze I mean
[1:31:15] know that all these things come from
[1:31:17] where they come from the earth then they
[1:31:20] found it out many many years ago the
[1:31:22] metallurgical value of brass and iron
[1:31:25] and tin and gold and silver and it all
[1:31:28] comes from the Earth but it it doesn't
[1:31:29] just lay there pure gold by itself it
[1:31:32] doesn't lay there uranium titanium you
[1:31:35] know there's a big silicon mine over
[1:31:37] here in North Carolina which is one of
[1:31:38] the purest in the entire world a but
[1:31:41] hour and a half or so from here and yet
[1:31:44] whenever they go in that and find all of
[1:31:46] that they still have to run it through a
[1:31:49] purification process it's that
[1:31:52] but it's mixed up with
[1:31:56] Earth I believe a lot of y'all got love
[1:31:59] Mercy kindness Grace forgiveness all of
[1:32:02] that thing but that Purity is mixed up
[1:32:06] with your humanity and it dilutes the
[1:32:09] purity of what we have by how much
[1:32:12] Humanity that we have left so what do
[1:32:14] they have to do they have to run it
[1:32:15] through a process and then each time
[1:32:19] they run it through the process it makes
[1:32:21] it more cure you've heard me tell about
[1:32:22] the Gold Mine The Carol and I saw years
[1:32:24] ago in South Africa and they're in that
[1:32:26] gold mine they had the same amount of
[1:32:29] gold and they would heat it up and it
[1:32:31] would become more pure each time they
[1:32:33] would heat it up it took out more draw
[1:32:36] and more draw and more dross each time
[1:32:39] God lets us go through something it's
[1:32:42] actually taking more impurities out and
[1:32:45] letting the real genuine shine more how
[1:32:48] many wants that with all your heart amen
[1:32:51] how how many wants to
[1:32:56] process notice what Paul says now not
[1:33:00] only so but we glory in Tribulation also
[1:33:02] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:33:05] patience and
[1:33:07] patience
[1:33:09] experience and
[1:33:11] experience hope now look at the coupling
[1:33:14] together of this
[1:33:17] train so it's like you've got one car
[1:33:19] hooked to another hooked to another now
[1:33:21] you just say well there's the engine
[1:33:23] that's the train no that's not the
[1:33:25] complete train well the Caboose that's
[1:33:28] that's the that's the last sign that's
[1:33:30] not the complete train one hook to
[1:33:32] another to another to another patience
[1:33:37] and experience and experience hope and
[1:33:41] hope make us not ashamed because the
[1:33:45] love of God is shed abroad on our hearts
[1:33:47] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:33:52] so
[1:33:53] experience Hope Oh all those things are
[1:33:56] wonderful but notice where it comes so
[1:33:59] tribulation worketh patience it doesn't
[1:34:02] create it it doesn't make it it works
[1:34:07] it it works it so you got a guy that
[1:34:11] goes into the gym he's getting a little
[1:34:13] bit pudgy a little bit of fly up hanging
[1:34:16] off there so his wife buys him a monthly
[1:34:20] admission into the local gym so he goes
[1:34:23] in there and he sees them guy sitting
[1:34:29] there Welly they can bench press how
[1:34:31] much
[1:34:33] ever this other guy walks in there say
[1:34:36] if they can do her I can do
[1:34:40] her so he reaches down there 175
[1:34:47] lb I'll be back next
[1:34:50] week
[1:34:56] stopping at the drugstore on his way
[1:34:57] back
[1:34:58] home to buy some anal
[1:35:02] jesic and you see that's so a many new
[1:35:04] Converse where they come to the Lord oh
[1:35:06] hallelujah hallelujah I'll reach down
[1:35:08] there boy I've
[1:35:14] beenal maybe I should start out with 5
[1:35:18] lbs so what do you do you work up to
[1:35:23] it so you start taking whatever you
[1:35:25] start and you goodness gracious I didn't
[1:35:28] realize that could be so bad and you do
[1:35:31] it again and you make another trip to
[1:35:33] church I mean to the
[1:35:35] gym come on and you're hearing and
[1:35:38] you're hearing and you're getting
[1:35:40] stronger and stronger and say hey I'm
[1:35:42] pretty good by that 15 pounder now I'm
[1:35:45] really going to take a jump 17 and a
[1:35:46] half I'm going to really jump up and
[1:35:48] then before you know it 20 25 5050 or
[1:35:51] whatever it is and it's the same way
[1:35:53] with tribulation it works that it works
[1:35:57] it like a muscle and our spiritual
[1:36:00] mechanism that God gives us as the
[1:36:02] people of God so tribulation worketh
[1:36:05] patience patience experience experience
[1:36:09] hope hope make us not ashamed because
[1:36:12] the love of God is shed abroad on our
[1:36:13] Holy Ghost but yet many people in this
[1:36:16] age don't want
[1:36:18] that I need patience order and I want it
[1:36:20] now
[1:36:28] Romans chapter 8 ver 24 for we are saved
[1:36:33] by hope but hope that is
[1:36:37] seen is not hope for what a man seeth
[1:36:43] why does he yet hope
[1:36:46] for but if we hope for that we see n now
[1:36:50] remember hope
[1:36:52] is Faith's little
[1:36:56] sister but don't you do away with her
[1:36:59] she's still part of the family of
[1:37:03] God the Bible tells us about Abraham in
[1:37:07] Hebrews against hope he believed in
[1:37:12] Hope notice it he says for if we hope
[1:37:15] for that which we see not then do we
[1:37:20] wish what about
[1:37:27] faith faith and
[1:37:30] patience should be coupled together to
[1:37:33] make the
[1:37:36] chain you see hope is more than just
[1:37:40] something that might
[1:37:42] exist it's something that you know it's
[1:37:44] a valid claim supported by faith don't
[1:37:48] go away with
[1:37:50] hope
[1:37:52] to keep that which you've committed to
[1:37:54] the Lord against that
[1:37:58] day notice again in Romans 15:4 for
[1:38:02] whatsoever things were written a four
[1:38:04] time were written for our learning that
[1:38:07] we
[1:38:08] through patience patience and comfort of
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:15] scriptures might have
[1:38:17] hope watch how these things link
[1:38:22] patience and comfort will help
[1:38:26] produce
[1:38:29] hope we want it all in one
[1:38:32] package get every bit of it at once God
[1:38:35] says nope I ain't never made a Christian
[1:38:37] like that I ain't going to start making
[1:38:39] one now I'm going to make mine the same
[1:38:41] way now notice Romans
[1:38:44] 15:5 now the god of patience and
[1:38:50] consolation Grant you to be likeminded
[1:38:53] one toward another according to Christ
[1:38:56] Jesus that you may have one mind and one
[1:38:59] mouth glorify God even the father of our
[1:39:05] Lord Jesus Christ what a great thing it
[1:39:08] is to have a life filled with
[1:39:12] patience praise God second Corinthians
[1:39:15] 6:4 but in all things approving
[1:39:18] ourselves as the Ministers of God in
[1:39:22] much patience in afflictions in
[1:39:26] Necessities in distresses Colossians
[1:39:30] 1:11 strengthen with all might according
[1:39:32] to his glorious power unto all patience
[1:39:37] and
[1:39:38] longsuffering with
[1:39:40] joyfulness how many can shout when
[1:39:43] you're under such
[1:39:46] burdens how many tends to
[1:39:49] complain how many tends to gripe and
[1:39:52] Grumble and I don't understand why what
[1:39:54] have I done well that's that's where
[1:39:56] most of us are that's where we fit this
[1:39:58] is why we need this to help us oh
[1:40:05] my thank you Lord God 2 Thessalonians
[1:40:09] chapter 1:4 so that we ourselves glory
[1:40:12] in you in the Churches of God for your
[1:40:16] patience and faith in all your
[1:40:19] persecutions
[1:40:21] and
[1:40:22] tribulations that ye endure remember 2
[1:40:25] Thessalonians is written around 55 to 60
[1:40:30] AD they were cutting their heads
[1:40:34] off remember in the time of
[1:40:37] Nero he had all these vast gardens
[1:40:39] around his
[1:40:42] Palace and they would dip
[1:40:45] Christians and Pitch tar t a r
[1:40:49] pitch wrapped them in sheep's clothes
[1:40:51] they said well Jesus heus said that they
[1:40:54] were
[1:40:55] sheep so they would put fleece around
[1:40:58] them
[1:40:59] Christians and pour that tar pitch on
[1:41:02] their bodies on that wool and set them
[1:41:06] on fire and neero would walk through his
[1:41:09] garden at night looking at all his
[1:41:11] plants and all of his flowers and all of
[1:41:14] his trees not lit up by electric lights
[1:41:18] but lit up by the saints of God
[1:41:22] being on
[1:41:23] fire your brothers and
[1:41:27] sisters and Paul write to them could you
[1:41:29] imagine a preacher trying to find words
[1:41:32] of comfort preaching that God is a
[1:41:35] loving God preaching that God is a
[1:41:37] merciful
[1:41:41] god
[1:41:44] M gives it a little bit different view
[1:41:47] doesn't it so that we ourselves glory in
[1:41:49] the Churches of God for your patience so
[1:41:53] they'd find a woman that was pregnant
[1:41:55] carrying her baby and they'd take their
[1:41:57] knives and rip her belly open as a moss
[1:42:00] did just a few weeks ago and pull the
[1:42:03] baby
[1:42:04] out and dash its head against a stone
[1:42:07] and kill
[1:42:10] it Lord God Hebrews
[1:42:14] 6:12 that you be not slothful but
[1:42:17] followers of them notice followers of of
[1:42:21] them who through
[1:42:23] faith and
[1:42:25] patience
[1:42:27] inherit the
[1:42:31] promises for when God made promise to
[1:42:34] Abraham because he could swear by no
[1:42:36] greater he swear by himself saying
[1:42:39] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[1:42:41] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[1:42:44] after he had patiently
[1:42:48] endured he obtained
[1:42:52] the
[1:42:53] promise and yet when Sarah died you know
[1:42:57] how much property Abraham had
[1:43:02] none he went to the field in the cave
[1:43:06] there was a cave there in the field Cave
[1:43:08] of
[1:43:09] matpa which means the cave of two
[1:43:14] mouths God promised him the whole land
[1:43:16] I'll give it all to you and yet when the
[1:43:19] man died
[1:43:21] the only thing he had in
[1:43:23] possession was a
[1:43:27] cemetery but Paul identifies it and he
[1:43:30] said he obtained the promise well you
[1:43:34] couldn't prove it by title go down to
[1:43:36] courthouse and search how many land
[1:43:39] Parcels does Abraham own Abraham Abraham
[1:43:42] Abraham Abraham oh yeah the sons of
[1:43:45] H yeah the sons of H sold him this this
[1:43:48] cave there and exorb
[1:43:51] price you compare the price of what they
[1:43:54] sold it to compared to the hurian text
[1:43:57] which they uncovered years and years ago
[1:43:59] it was an exorb amount not the way
[1:44:02] Abraham looked at it because by
[1:44:04] Revelation he found out job was buried
[1:44:08] there and the only piece of ground the
[1:44:11] man owned was a cemetery but Paul said
[1:44:16] he obtained it yeah Oh Glory to God
[1:44:21] I remind you again in case some of you
[1:44:24] are wondering my daughter Erica obtained
[1:44:28] the promise Amen brother Junior Davis
[1:44:31] obtained the promise others that we have
[1:44:34] prayed for obtain the promise Man car
[1:44:37] was talking about coming to church and I
[1:44:38] told her I said she did not lose the
[1:44:41] devil lost the devil lost it was not us
[1:44:44] as the children of God we obtain the
[1:44:48] promise Hallelujah
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:53] Hallelujah so after he had patiently
[1:44:56] endured he obtained the promise notice
[1:44:59] let me close with this Hebrews 10:36 for
[1:45:02] you have
[1:45:04] need of
[1:45:06] patience that after you have done the
[1:45:09] will of
[1:45:10] God you
[1:45:12] might
[1:45:14] receive the
[1:45:17] promise so you think you mean actually
[1:45:19] believed I we've had faith faith
[1:45:23] believes he can and believes he will but
[1:45:26] patience couple will facei will say I'm
[1:45:29] going to wait until it
[1:45:32] happens CU I have Godly
[1:45:35] patience let's Stand Together Hebrews 12
[1:45:41] verse1 wherefore seeing we also are
[1:45:44] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:45:48] witnesses let us lay aside every wait
[1:45:51] and the sin which just so easily beset
[1:45:55] us and let us run with patience with
[1:46:01] patience the race that is set before us
[1:46:06] Hebrews
[1:46:07] 13:21 make you perfect in every good
[1:46:10] work to do his will working in you that
[1:46:12] which is well pleasing in his sight
[1:46:14] through Jesus Christ to whom be glory
[1:46:16] forever and ever amen James 1 three
[1:46:21] knowing
[1:46:22] this that the
[1:46:24] trying of your
[1:46:26] faith work
[1:46:28] us
[1:46:30] patience but you see if somehow we
[1:46:34] look at patience and think what do you
[1:46:37] need patience for I've got faith I've
[1:46:39] got faith but the trying of your faith
[1:46:42] actually works patience and brings it to
[1:46:46] the stage of fulfillment how many
[1:46:49] Christians here today been asking God
[1:46:52] for something healing for your body
[1:46:54] salvation for a loved one for a long
[1:46:58] time long
[1:47:02] time maybe some of you asking for
[1:47:04] healing some of you asking for the Holy
[1:47:05] Ghost some maybe asking for a husband a
[1:47:07] wife a son or
[1:47:09] daughter don't think faith alone will
[1:47:12] bring it but
[1:47:15] patience patience
[1:47:17] coupled with your faith
[1:47:21] notice James says in verse four but let
[1:47:24] patience have
[1:47:26] her I find this so amazing that he
[1:47:29] designates patience in the feminist
[1:47:34] gender now remember the prophet tells us
[1:47:37] about faith that faith has hair on his
[1:47:39] chest which ain't a
[1:47:41] woman if it does she's really
[1:47:45] weird but look at little weak
[1:47:49] patience but let patience have her
[1:47:54] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[1:48:02] entire
[1:48:03] wanting
[1:48:06] nothing let patience have her perfect
[1:48:09] work that ye may be perfect now this is
[1:48:12] not sinlessness but it's Tios the Greek
[1:48:16] word Tios which means fully
[1:48:21] matured
[1:48:23] lacking
[1:48:25] nothing don't you understand how people
[1:48:27] can have faith that God can heal but
[1:48:31] they don't have patience to endure child
[1:48:34] training how many people have I prayed
[1:48:36] for brother Daryl prayed for these other
[1:48:39] brothers have prayed for through the
[1:48:40] years that we've been here and they
[1:48:42] would come and get a great miracle
[1:48:43] brother R spener was tell me not long
[1:48:45] ago of one of the greatest Miracles he
[1:48:47] ever seen in his ministry and it was at
[1:48:49] a woman and a hospital and they called
[1:48:51] him to pray for the woman wasn't saved
[1:48:52] the woman wasn't wasn't serving the lord
[1:48:54] in the light of the hour and he goes in
[1:48:56] and they give her just a few hours to
[1:48:58] live and he prays for him what he's
[1:49:01] praying for God shows him a vision he
[1:49:02] sees this woman walking down the hallway
[1:49:04] and he tells him by a certain time
[1:49:06] she'll be out of here the nurse said sir
[1:49:07] do you understand this woman's dying he
[1:49:09] said I didn't say that the Lord's one
[1:49:11] told me
[1:49:12] that by the next day the exact time that
[1:49:15] he said so it
[1:49:17] happened that woman still ain't serving
[1:49:19] God
[1:49:21] yet she had Faith to believe it would
[1:49:23] happen but patience to
[1:49:26] endure don't you understand faith alone
[1:49:29] will not do it we must be coupled with
[1:49:38] patience how many needs
[1:49:42] help let patience have her perfect work
[1:49:46] that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:49:51] complete wanting
[1:49:55] nothing let's Barry
[1:49:59] it praise the
[1:50:03] Lord
[1:50:05] hallelujah now I'm not going to ask how
[1:50:08] many today wants trouble how many wants
[1:50:10] tests and trials and none of us want
[1:50:12] that of
[1:50:13] course but I do believe all of those of
[1:50:16] us today that are sincere before the
[1:50:18] Lord we want to be perfect and entire
[1:50:23] lacking nothing in our
[1:50:26] walk how many say Lord help me today
[1:50:30] help me
[1:50:32] Jesus Lord God I raise both my
[1:50:37] hands heavenly father as we bow our
[1:50:39] heads to the dust of the
[1:50:43] earth when we come to this world we did
[1:50:46] not have these Divine things in
[1:50:49] US Lord when I give my heart to you as a
[1:50:52] 12-year-old boy little did I know the
[1:50:55] years and
[1:50:56] years that it would take in my journey
[1:50:59] to
[1:51:00] develop and make these
[1:51:03] traits father many of these Believers
[1:51:05] standing here today been saved for
[1:51:09] decades and that they still probably
[1:51:11] find themselves ripening and maturing in
[1:51:15] your
[1:51:16] presence Lord we don't want just want
[1:51:19] faith
[1:51:21] but we want Fai with
[1:51:25] patience so can we patiently
[1:51:28] wait while a person is prayed for and
[1:51:31] healed and we know they don't even live
[1:51:34] really a consecrated
[1:51:36] life and others are prayed for that live
[1:51:39] a better life and live more consecrated
[1:51:41] than that one does and instead of
[1:51:44] healing them you take
[1:51:48] them can we with patience then wait to
[1:51:52] see them in the
[1:51:59] resurrection help us

[1:52:51] wisdom that you'll allow to come our way
[1:52:53] what is
[1:52:55] necessary that our patience can be
[1:52:59] TR Lord sometimes you answer in a way
[1:53:02] that is so surprising to us it
[1:53:04] overwhelms us because you know how we
[1:53:06] are we have our minds run in a certain
[1:53:09] direction you're going to do this and
[1:53:10] this and this and then you do something
[1:53:13] so different and it it it just it just
[1:53:16] overwhelms us we don't know what to make
[1:53:18] of it
[1:53:20] but we're so glad

[1:53:49] heart

[1:53:54] fruit fruit with
[1:53:57] patience Paul catches it of course in
