[7:28] through a difficult situation really
[7:30] needs the Lord's guidance, wisdom, needs
[7:32] a move of the Lord to help get things
[7:35] straightened out for her. Thank you and

[8:09] Church, recovering from gallbladder
[8:11] surgery. Want to remember her as we
[8:12] pray. Please remember sister Beverly
[8:15] Ford being restored back to the Lord and
[8:18] the message in an hour of so many
[8:20] leaving. This is a tremendous thing. So,
[8:21] they're thanking the Lord for that. I

[8:27] neck, shoulder, and lower back. Please
[8:30] agree with him in prayer that God will

[13:13] &gt;&gt; So many times I've questioned
[13:17] certain circumstances
[13:20] of things I could not understand.
[13:26] Oh, that's right.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Many times in trials,
[13:32] weakness blurs my vision and my
[13:35] frustration gets so out of pain.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's I am.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; I've never
[13:47] forsaken.
[13:49] I never had to stand one test.
[13:56] And as I look at all the victories,
[13:59] the spirit rises up.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Through the fire, my
[14:05] weakness is made strong. Sing it now.
[14:11] He never promised that the cross would
[14:15] not be heavy
[14:17] and the hill would not be hard to come.
[14:25] He never offered
[14:28] victories without
[14:31] help.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Just remember when you're s Lord in the
[14:42] valley of decision
[14:45] and the adversary says give it just hold
[14:52] on
[14:55] our Lord will show up
[14:58] and he will take you through the fire
[15:02] again.
[15:05] [Music]
[15:07] I know within myself that I will surely
[15:13] that if I trust the hand of God, he'll
[15:17] shield the flesh.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[15:22] again.
[15:26] He never promised that the cross would
[15:30] not be heavy and the hill would not be
[15:34] hard to find.
[15:40] He never offered
[15:43] victories without fighting. But he said
[15:46] hell would always come in
[15:51] singing to him. Just remember when
[15:54] you're standing in the valley of
[15:58] decision
[16:00] and the adversary says give you just
[16:06] hold on.
[16:09] Our Lord will show up
[16:13] and he will take you through the fire
[16:17] again.
[16:19] [Music]
[16:22] I know within myself that I will surely
[16:27] that's a truth.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; And if I trust the hand of God, he'll
[16:31] shield the flames again. Glory
[16:34] &gt;&gt; again
[16:36] and again.
[16:41] He never promised that the cross would
[16:44] not be heavy and the hill would not be
[16:49] hard in the time.
[16:55] He never offered
[16:57] a victory without mighty. He said help
[17:02] would always come in time.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Just remember when you're standing.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:12] of decision.
[17:14] The adversary says here
[17:24] our show
[17:27] and he will take you through the fire
[17:31] again.
[17:34] Just hold on.
[17:38] will show up
[17:41] and he will take you through the fire
[17:45] again.
[17:51] Hallelujah. Give the Lord a good hand
[17:53] this morning.

[32:11] he just sits down and looks at her like
[32:12] that. He just
[32:14] &gt;&gt; That's true. He's smitten, didn't he,
[32:16] sis?
[32:18] &gt;&gt; You imagine as an earthly father can
[32:20] look at a child and be so smitten. What
[32:24] about our father God?
[32:26] When he sees us and give birth to us and
[32:29] we grow and fall and make mistakes and
[32:33] he just looks at us and loves us so
[32:35] much. Let's pray together.
[32:38] Lord Jesus, my brother and sister stand
[32:42] here today and Lord, they want to bring
[32:44] their little daughter that you've given
[32:46] to their union into your presence. Lord,
[32:50] human love is such a powerful thing.
[32:53] Would cause a mother to run into a
[32:55] burning house to save her child. It
[32:58] would cause a parent to do horrendous
[33:01] acts that humanly they wouldn't do. Lord
[33:05] God, it reminds us of your great love
[33:09] that Almighty God would leave heaven to
[33:12] come to a cursed place like this because
[33:15] you loved us so much. Father, as I bring
[33:18] her into your presence today, I pray
[33:21] Lord that you just keep her by your
[33:23] grace. Lord Jesus, make my sister as a
[33:28] prophet has taught us to be the fifth
[33:30] gospel to be able to instill in her that
[33:34] which only a godly mother can do. Help
[33:37] my brother that he can be able to be
[33:40] such an example to her. May she be
[33:43] raised in a home where
[33:46] singing and tapes are played and
[33:49] preaching and she comes to church and
[33:51] hears the songs of Zion. Lord God, would
[33:55] you grant it? Keep her from the evils of
[33:58] the day. If time should tear, Lord, that
[34:01] should get old enough to be able to know
[34:02] right from wrong. Maybe she will give
[34:05] her heart to you when she's young. Lord,
[34:07] we dedicate her to you today for a life
[34:10] of service. Father, in the name of
[34:13] Jesus. Amen.
[34:16] Well, I put her to sleep.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord, baby.
[34:25] God bless y'all.
[34:33] Let's stand together and I'll read my
[34:35] text and put some of the rest of you to
[34:36] sleep. Now,
[34:41] Isn't it wonderful to be a Christian?
[34:44] &gt;&gt; To be a child of God, to know the
[34:47] awesome things that the Lord Jesus has
[34:49] done and is currently doing. I'm just so
[34:53] happy myself to be a part of it. Let's
[34:56] uh turn to the scripture that we've been
[34:59] reading here for so many uh weeks now in
[35:02] second Peter chapter 1
[35:06] verse two. Now I want you to think as we
[35:08] read this today that the setting is um
[35:13] in the first century
[35:15] the churches are very very
[35:19] few and small in number. This would have
[35:22] been probably in a lot of places a
[35:25] massive church in the f in the early
[35:28] days in the first church age.
[35:31] um they would have had to hid. They
[35:34] would have been by this time when second
[35:37] Peter's written persecution has already
[35:39] started coming against the church.
[35:41] People have lost their lives. People are
[35:44] paying a tremendous price to be a
[35:46] Christian. Unlike today, you just get in
[35:49] your car and you multiple choice. I want
[35:51] any money or mo. Which one do I want to
[35:54] go? So, you just pick the church. And
[35:57] that day there was no such a thing.
[35:59] That's right.
[36:00] Think of it. Initially, there's only one
[36:02] church.
[36:04] Only one.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; So, if you'd have went to Corinth, they
[36:07] wouldn't split message churches
[36:09] everywhere. There's one.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; That is God's original plan.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; And then the others properly go out and
[36:17] are sent out by apostolic direction, not
[36:21] the cunningness of man.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Same way in cree, same way in Patmas and
[36:26] all the different areas where the
[36:27] churches were. And this man here had a
[36:31] real experience with these virtues that
[36:34] we're going to read about.
[36:37] Now he says, "Grace and peace be
[36:38] multiplied unto you through the
[36:40] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[36:43] according as his divine power hath given
[36:46] unto us all things that pertain unto
[36:50] life and godliness, through the
[36:53] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[36:56] glory and virtue, whereby are given unto
[36:59] us unto us exceeding great and precious
[37:06] promises.
[37:07] I hope we never get away from looking at
[37:10] the promises of God with such terms of
[37:14] endearment.
[37:17] Oh, do we take it for granted, children.
[37:20] Listen what Peter says. Whereby are
[37:22] given unto us exceeding great great
[37:25] would have been wonderful, but exceeding
[37:29] great and precious promises. and that by
[37:34] these you might be partakers of the
[37:37] divine nature, having escaped the
[37:40] corruption that is in the world through
[37:43] lust. And beside this, giving all
[37:46] diligence, add to your faith, virtue,
[37:49] and to virtue knowledge. Now, remember
[37:52] when Peter first starts out, he's got he
[37:55] has faith. He definitely has faith even
[37:58] before his conversion. But he also had
[38:00] to realize he didn't have enough faith
[38:02] to keep him. He thought he'd stand for
[38:05] the Lord Jesus no matter what. Matter of
[38:07] fact, he bragged about it. I don't care
[38:09] what John does. I'll be with you. I'll
[38:12] stand with you. And Jesus said before
[38:14] the crows, you'll deny you even
[38:16] know me. He probably didn't even believe
[38:18] him then because his human faith was so
[38:21] strong. But you see, human faith will
[38:24] fail us.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Human virtue will fail us. human
[38:28] knowledge, patience, temperance, all
[38:30] these things. And beside this, giving
[38:32] all diligence, add to your faith,
[38:35] virtue, and to virtue knowledge. So when
[38:38] we read this, keep in mind, we're
[38:40] talking about a man that experienced
[38:42] this firsthanded himself. Peter didn't
[38:45] start out a perfect Christian, a perfect
[38:48] preacher.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; What did he do? He had to grow in what?
[38:54] Same pattern God wants you and I to grow
[38:55] in. and to knowledge temperance and to
[38:58] temperance patience and to patience
[39:01] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[39:04] kindness and the brotherly kindness
[39:07] charity. How many like to be remembered
[39:09] today as we pray? Amen. Let's just bow
[39:11] our heads if you would.
[39:13] Our heavenly father, we count it such a
[39:15] privilege that we could be gathered here
[39:17] today, Lord, once again, not under the
[39:20] oposes of a system, not under the oposes
[39:23] of the leadership of some carnal man
[39:26] that wants to build a kingdom for
[39:27] himself, but we believe under the
[39:30] leadership of the Holy Ghost. Father, we
[39:33] are asking today that you would help us
[39:36] as we've gathered here, Lord. Our needs
[39:38] are many. and we're bringing before you
[39:40] those that are sick, those that are
[39:42] weary, those Father, that need the Holy
[39:45] Ghost, those that are going through
[39:46] tremendous times in their life. And
[39:49] we're just praying today for strength
[39:50] for your people, not just in our local
[39:53] assembly that we know from people around
[39:56] the world, Lord, that we're in contact
[39:58] with constantly that there are so many
[40:01] needs among your children. But we
[40:03] believe if we can look at it right,
[40:05] these are opportunities of faith by
[40:08] which you can move for us. So we present
[40:10] our needs, our desires. I present myself
[40:13] to you today, Father. Help me to
[40:15] surrender to you and to submit, open my
[40:18] mouths, Lord, to the things that are
[40:19] pleasing to you. Shut my mouth to things
[40:22] that would be wrong or irrelevant. Help
[40:25] me, Lord Jesus, that I can follow your
[40:27] leading today. In Jesus Christ's name we
[40:30] pray. Amen. God bless your children.
[40:33] Sure love you. Today you can be seated.
[40:40] I decided
[40:43] I'd go ahead and
[40:45] preach on u
[40:48] patience again.
[40:51] [Applause]
[40:58] That was about as weak as dish water,
[40:59] wasn't it?
[41:03] Now, I said that during our scripture
[41:06] readings, not just to take up time, but
[41:10] so you would be able to catch the
[41:12] foundation of the man that we're talking
[41:16] about. Now, we know that people can say
[41:18] all kinds of words. You know, I see it.
[41:20] I've done so many funerals in my
[41:23] ministry and watch people as they come
[41:25] through and they're shaking hands with
[41:28] the family or putting their arms around
[41:29] them, whatever it is they do to express
[41:31] their feelings and condolences. And many
[41:34] times I've heard them as they say, "I
[41:36] know exactly what you're going through.
[41:37] I I know exactly the pain that you're
[41:40] feeling." And in one way, they might
[41:42] know a similar pain, but it don't mean
[41:45] they know exactly because every marriage
[41:48] is a little bit different. every
[41:50] relationship of a parent to a child, of
[41:53] a grandson, to a grandmother or a
[41:56] grandfather. And it's the same with
[41:58] preachers preaching sermons that
[42:00] preachers can get a lot of good thoughts
[42:02] and put a lot of things together. But
[42:05] there's a great difference between a man
[42:07] preaching from theology and preaching
[42:11] with theology mixed with experience.
[42:14] Now, I hear songs sometimes, gospel
[42:17] songs, which is the only kind I listen
[42:18] to, of course. And I will think of this
[42:21] brother or maybe that sister, and I I'll
[42:24] send brother Larry sometimes songs and
[42:26] say, "Hey, see if anybody any of our
[42:28] singers would like to like to learn this
[42:30] song. I'll send some to Harry. I'll send
[42:34] different ones to brother Caleb or or
[42:36] different ones that I think I know their
[42:38] style and and how they enjoy, you know,
[42:41] certain songs and I'll send it to them."
[42:43] But with many of them, if I don't do it
[42:46] then, I've done it before. And I will
[42:49] give them this little disclaimer. Now,
[42:52] if this does not connect with you, don't
[42:55] you feel obligated to learn to sing this
[42:58] song because I've had people to do me
[43:01] the same way that they would send me a
[43:03] song. I want you to sing this song.
[43:05] Would you learn to sing this song for
[43:07] me? And I'll listen to it and listen to
[43:10] it and listen to it. Good words. Nothing
[43:13] wrong with a song. Tempo's good. You
[43:15] know, everything about the song, I don't
[43:16] see anything wrong with it necessarily,
[43:19] but there's just no connection with me
[43:22] being a singer. Crippled up as I am as
[43:25] being a singer, there's no connection
[43:27] between the song and me. Does that make
[43:30] sense? Now, you singers understand what
[43:32] I'm talking about, don't you? And
[43:34] somebody else could hear it and say,
[43:35] "Oh, that sounds just like Brother
[43:37] Harvey. Oh, I can hear Brother Harvey's
[43:39] tone. That sounds just like Brother Dave
[43:41] Swanson." and brother Dave Swanson gets
[43:43] it and he's wrinkling his nose and
[43:45] thinking, "What were they thinking when
[43:47] they sent me that song?" So, it's the
[43:50] same way with preaching and with
[43:52] preachers in that preachers could preach
[43:55] about patience and love and forgiveness
[43:58] and kindness and yet maybe themselves
[44:00] have never really been tested to a
[44:03] degree to where they had to forgive
[44:06] somebody that had caused them such pain
[44:09] in their life. Now, will what they say
[44:13] have weight? It will because it's the
[44:16] truth. And God's truth can never be
[44:19] preached or even be shared by one
[44:22] another without it having value. But
[44:25] will it have the same value as coming
[44:29] from a person who is not only preaching
[44:32] it, but who is living and preaching the
[44:36] same sermon themsself? Now you see God
[44:39] knew that in relation to humanity from
[44:43] the Old Testament he could tell them
[44:45] don't do this don't do that go here
[44:47] don't do there dress this way don't mix
[44:49] your field with seeds don't put linen
[44:52] and woolen in your garments don't do
[44:54] this don't do that don't do that and
[44:56] then God gave the law which could never
[44:59] give them a a love and a release from
[45:01] sin but God wanted to understand when he
[45:05] would tell people don't do this. How
[45:08] much more simple can I make it? Don't do
[45:11] this. And people said, "We won't do it,
[45:15] Lord." And they turned right around and
[45:18] do it, Lord.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Preach.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; And God's thinking, "What is the matter
[45:24] with them bunch of nottheads?"
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Now, that's Kentucky vernacular.
[45:30] So God wanted to become a human and
[45:34] understand whenever the word said don't
[45:37] do this. He wanted to understand by
[45:41] experience the feel in flesh that even
[45:46] though you know you're not supposed to
[45:49] but there's something about a human
[45:51] being that something still pulls them
[45:55] &gt;&gt; that makes them want to
[45:56] &gt;&gt; preach. So God wanted to understand so
[46:00] that he could condemn sin not in heaven
[46:04] but in the flesh.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So he wanted to condemn sin in the
[46:09] flesh. So he must have human desire,
[46:13] human makeup. So can you imagine
[46:16] Almighty God allowing himself to
[46:19] condense sin to such a level that he
[46:23] could suffer sexual temptation
[46:28] &gt;&gt; that God could suffer the temptation of
[46:32] wanting to drink,
[46:36] &gt;&gt; wanting to find something that would
[46:38] help ease the human tension and human
[46:43] pressure that we all feel.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't want just to add more
[46:48] scriptures to the Torah, the law as you
[46:51] know it. He didn't want to add just more
[46:53] books and more thou shalt not and thou
[46:56] shalt not. Oh my goodness, you imagine
[46:58] what it would be in the age we live with
[47:00] all the thou shalt nots that we don't
[47:02] need to do. My goodness, we'd all have
[47:04] books packing around under our arms,
[47:06] wouldn't we? Because Satan is constantly
[47:10] by science updating and making sin more
[47:14] desirable. And in reality, if you're
[47:16] going to go only by what's written,
[47:19] you're going to have many sins out here
[47:21] that the Bible does not describe them
[47:23] word by word.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; But the Bible covers them all by three
[47:28] main issues. Lust of the flesh, lust of
[47:30] the eyes, and the pride of light. That
[47:32] covers every bit of it. Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; So Peter is not writing now of something
[47:38] that is very good theology. By now he
[47:41] himself no doubt has been able to grow
[47:45] up to where he's far beyond his initial
[47:49] stage of faith in the Lord Jesus. He's
[47:52] beyond virtue because we can see in Acts
[47:55] two, the spirit of God had began to
[47:57] anoint these apostles and the holy fire
[48:00] of God had come inside of them and they
[48:02] were doing the same thing, miraculous
[48:04] works that Jesus did. So virtue was
[48:07] coming out of them and then knowledge
[48:10] and then Peter was moving himself. So
[48:13] he's growing along with the church. So
[48:15] as he's riding here and God reveals to
[48:18] him these steps of what God's going to
[48:20] use for the building. material. Peter
[48:22] can no doubt look at himself and think,
[48:25] "My goodness, that's what's happened to
[48:27] me. That's what's happened to John.
[48:30] That's what happened to Peter and James
[48:32] and the brothers that rub shoulders with
[48:35] the Lord Jesus." Wouldn't that been an
[48:37] awesome experience to been there among
[48:38] them disciples? But to be honest with
[48:41] you, if I had a choice between the two
[48:43] time frames, I would choose this one
[48:45] right here.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. If I could have lived 2,000
[48:48] years ago and my name would have been in
[48:51] there and then and and Jesus called
[48:53] Donnie and Jesus called J. D and Jesus
[48:56] called Rob, I'd rather live right now
[48:58] than I would have them because they
[49:01] couldn't get the Holy Ghost till after
[49:02] he had done lived and gone. But now it's
[49:05] my possession and yours. So in reality,
[49:09] we live in a greater time. So Peter
[49:13] understood what it was like to lack
[49:16] patience, especially with his brethren
[49:19] and to lack patience sometimes with God.
[49:23] He knew what it was like to lack
[49:25] godliness, which means to be like God.
[49:29] He knew what it was like about to lack
[49:32] brotherly kindness. So he's not writing
[49:35] sitting around and reading somebody's
[49:37] book. And boy, this would make a good
[49:38] sermon here in second Peter. I think
[49:40] I'll put it together today. I think I'll
[49:42] write it all down and I'm going to
[49:44] select this. Peter never selected this.
[49:47] The Holy Ghost did. You believe that the
[49:50] spirit of God was the one who anointed
[49:52] Peter to write down these building
[49:55] blocks that God was going to lay during
[49:57] the church ages and also in the
[49:59] individuals. Let's go back again to
[50:02] verse six. And to knowledge temperance
[50:04] and to temperance patience. Let's look
[50:07] at the meaning of the word again.
[50:09] Patience enduring patience continuence
[50:14] patient waiting
[50:17] help us Jesus
[50:19] steadfastness in the New Testament the
[50:22] characteristic of a man who is not
[50:26] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[50:31] his loyalty to faith and piety even when
[50:35] the greatest trials
[50:38] and sufferings patiently and
[50:41] steadfastly.
[50:43] Now, we're talking about something then
[50:46] that it is not given or even thought
[50:48] attainable for a sensible person that
[50:51] this can ever be got by a young
[50:54] Christian. Now, whenever we did our
[50:57] landscaping around here a couple of
[50:58] years ago, and brother Aaron and his
[51:00] brother set most of it out, and as I've
[51:03] noticed it this spring that some of them
[51:06] died and didn't make it through the
[51:08] winter. So, I've been coming back and
[51:10] replacing them. And some of them that's
[51:13] been there for a couple of years now,
[51:15] they've been able to break out of the
[51:17] pot shape that they were in whenever the
[51:19] brother set them out. And the roots
[51:22] begin to go out from the because they
[51:25] wrap around the inside of the plastic
[51:26] pot and they'll wrap around this way
[51:29] vertically horizontally. And then that's
[51:31] as far as they can go until they're
[51:33] released. And then once you take them
[51:36] out, you dig a bigger hole, one and a
[51:38] half to two times bigger. And you dig
[51:40] the hole, you put it down, you rake the
[51:42] fresh soil around it. Then if you
[51:44] desire, you can put root stimulator
[51:46] which helps them with the shock because
[51:49] plants get a shock when you take them
[51:52] out of the pot they're in and then you
[51:54] pot them into the ground. So it's into
[51:57] shock through the plant. So they have
[51:59] made a certain fertilizer of a ratio
[52:02] that will stimulate growth. Now that's
[52:04] all good. You can follow them steps
[52:06] exactly right. But then if you go to
[52:09] watering that plant during the dry
[52:11] months and you will what they call
[52:14] shallow water and all you do is water
[52:17] the top of the ground around that plant.
[52:19] Now what you're going to do is cause
[52:21] those roots to come this way toward the
[52:25] very top cuz you're shallow watering and
[52:28] that's where they know the water is. But
[52:31] if you deep water that ground around
[52:34] that plant, then whenever the sun will
[52:37] dry out the first inch and a half or 2
[52:39] in of the top soil, then the roots know
[52:42] that water is deeper down. And what will
[52:46] the roots do? They start going this way
[52:50] instead of this way. Now, that's the way
[52:52] it is with a lot of Christians. They go
[52:54] to churches that all they do is shallow
[52:57] water the top of the ground. And they
[53:00] make excuses for why they can't live
[53:02] right, while they're fall short of the
[53:04] glory of God. And they simply give them
[53:06] a little patch and a little pat here and
[53:08] there. God understands. God understands.
[53:10] So they're shallow watering their
[53:12] Christianity and they never become
[53:15] stable.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Now I love hydranches as y'all can tell
[53:19] by looking when you come in. So, what I
[53:22] did was this spring I started planting
[53:24] some more to add to our collection. But
[53:28] what I found out was, which I already
[53:30] knew it, but this this summer's really
[53:32] brought it out. These that have been in
[53:34] the ground now for a couple of years, I
[53:36] didn't hardly have to water them at all.
[53:39] But these new ones that I've set out,
[53:42] I've had to water them, some of them
[53:44] daily, and I've been calling them
[53:46] hydrangeas baby Christians. I told Carol
[53:50] the other day, she said, "What are you
[53:52] going to do?" I said, "I'm going over to
[53:53] the church to water the baby Christians
[53:56] because 90 plus degree weather,
[53:58] humidity, all that, them little old
[54:01] things, they go to shriveling up that
[54:03] way and the little old blooms go to
[54:05] dropping and drooping down on the side
[54:08] and they look absolutely awful." Well,
[54:10] hallelujah. That's the way some of y'all
[54:13] come into church sometimes. your little
[54:15] leaves is all weirded around and your
[54:17] little blooms is all over and you got
[54:19] this big sour look on your face. Come
[54:22] on, somebody. But then I notice these
[54:25] same ones out here that have been out
[54:27] for a while and they've been through
[54:29] some hard times. They passed the initial
[54:32] shock stage of being planted out there
[54:36] and they made it past that. Then they
[54:38] made it through some dry spells, some
[54:39] wet spells. They've survived a couple of
[54:42] winters. Cold, you know, single digits.
[54:44] Pretty tough stuff. And yet standing
[54:46] right there beside them. And right
[54:48] behind them, especially on this bank,
[54:50] are some little bitty babies about this
[54:52] tall. And all my other brothers
[54:54] delicately put them in the ground. And
[54:56] then as I begin to go around and I water
[54:59] a little here, and I'll water a little
[55:00] there, and I'll water a little here. And
[55:03] you realize that we are much like them
[55:05] types of plants. But myself, I don't
[55:09] desire to be a baby hydrangea all of my
[55:13] life. Do any of you all? Is that your
[55:15] vision of yourself that you've got to be
[55:18] babyed through every trial, baby through
[55:21] every test? Oh, sure. Through long
[55:23] droughts, we all need a little extra
[55:26] help every now and then. So, if you see
[55:27] me kind of swiveled up, if you don't
[55:29] mind, pour a little bucket of water on
[55:31] me. But you know what? I don't want a
[55:33] bucket of water every time I go through
[55:36] a trial. I want to be rooted and settled
[55:40] and I want my roots to go down this way
[55:43] in the message of the hour, the gospel
[55:46] of Jesus Christ. That's friends exactly
[55:48] what's happened in our ranks in the last
[55:50] several years. Why folks have left? You
[55:53] know why? Because they were shallow
[55:55] watered. They were shallow water. Many
[55:58] of them was following the preacher that
[56:00] led them into the message. They never
[56:02] had a revelation. No way. And then they
[56:04] lost confidence in that preacher or that
[56:07] deacon that gave them a book and there
[56:10] went their version of the message. Well,
[56:11] I'll tell you one thing. If that's all
[56:13] you've got, I feel sorry for you. But if
[56:16] you're built upon a rock, there ain't
[56:18] enough devils in hell. There ain't
[56:20] enough preachers that fall away or
[56:23] deacons that fall away to ever move you
[56:26] because you are not shallow watered. You
[56:30] are rooted and anchored down in the
[56:33] ground. And your roots are not on the
[56:35] top of the ground. Well, I don't feel
[56:37] like going to church. I don't feel like
[56:40] praising God. You've been shallow
[56:41] watered.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. God wants you to go
[56:45] to church when you don't feel like going
[56:47] to church. God wants you to praise him
[56:51] when you don't feel like praising him.
[56:54] That's the greatest time there is to
[56:56] praise God when you don't even feel like
[56:58] it. Oh my. Oh, but brother Donnie, I'm
[57:01] so weary. Come on. You've been watered
[57:04] deeply around here. You've been watered
[57:06] deeply to give you some stability. When
[57:09] the sickness comes and the disease come
[57:12] and the trouble come, we are not moving.
[57:16] Amen. We're going to praise him in the
[57:18] sunshine. We're going to praise him in
[57:21] the storms. We're going to praise him in
[57:23] the difficulty because we have been
[57:26] watered deeply. And our roots go beyond
[57:30] up here.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[57:39] Give us patience, Lord.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Some of you didn't say it. You was
[57:46] afraid he'd hear you. He caught your
[57:48] thoughts. Anyway,
[57:51] &gt;&gt; notice this. The prophet said, "No
[57:53] wonder Paul could stand in the face of
[57:55] death and say, "Oh, death, where's your
[57:58] stain? Grave, where is your victory?"
[58:01] See, through tribulations, he had
[58:03] learned
[58:05] the love of God.
[58:09] Through tribulations,
[58:12] so through tribulation,
[58:14] we learn something about the love of God
[58:17] that grace alone never teaches us.
[58:22] You see, those who associate understand
[58:24] the great depth of God with grace alone
[58:28] are going to be robbed of so much stuff
[58:31] cuz this is the way they equate grace,
[58:33] love, grace, mercy, grace, love, grace,
[58:35] mercy. And they don't understand and
[58:37] they don't want tribulation. Look, I'm
[58:39] not an idiot. I'm not standing up here
[58:41] and said, "Lord, give me another trial.
[58:43] Give me another test." I might have been
[58:44] born in the morning, but it wasn't this
[58:46] morning and it wasn't yesterday morning.
[58:48] You ain't looking. No, no friends. I'll
[58:50] tell you right now that goes around
[58:52] asking God for trouble. Asking God,
[58:54] Lord, try me. Try me, Lord, if you want
[58:56] to. Oh, no. I don't do that. I'd rather
[58:59] have the mountain top any day out of the
[59:01] week than I would the valley. I'd rather
[59:03] have healing. I'd rather have health.
[59:05] Come on, somebody. I'd rather have
[59:07] things going good, too. But I know in
[59:10] order for me to be what I need to be,
[59:13] I'm going to have to experience
[59:14] hardship, trials, troubles. And to be
[59:18] honest, I don't ask God to keep them
[59:20] away from me.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; I would be ashamed
[59:25] to ask him such.
[59:29] Notice the prophet said, "Through
[59:30] tribulation, he had learned the love of
[59:33] God. Suffering brings patience.
[59:38] It works tribulations to bring patience.
[59:41] Of course, now patience makes love
[59:47] and trust.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Wow. Romans 15:4. Can we take a journey
[59:53] through the scripture this morning?
[59:55] Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; For whatsoever things were written
[59:58] before time were written for our
[1:00:01] learning that we through faith
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; virtue knowledge that we through
[1:00:10] patience
[1:00:12] and comfort.
[1:00:14] Oh, praise God. Patience and comfort of
[1:00:19] the scriptures might have hope. Don't
[1:00:23] you love your Bible? Oh, thank God for
[1:00:27] letting us have a a Bible in this.
[1:00:29] Imagine our brothers and sisters around
[1:00:32] the world, some of them still do not
[1:00:36] have a Bible in their possession.
[1:00:40] Churches in Africa, churches in India,
[1:00:43] which are helping buy them, don't even
[1:00:46] have a personal Bible.
[1:00:50] We've got them laying around in our
[1:00:51] home. We've got them on our phone. have
[1:00:53] got them here and there and there. And
[1:00:54] do we even use them?
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my preach, brother.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Through patience and comfort of the
[1:01:04] scriptures might have hope. I'll tell
[1:01:07] you, this man that we're talking about
[1:01:09] here that wrote this as well, had his
[1:01:12] own experience of patience. It wasn't a
[1:01:16] beautiful theological term that he
[1:01:18] thought would make a nice passage of
[1:01:21] scripture. He had his own trial of
[1:01:23] patience with God and with people.
[1:01:29] Notice in Colossians 1:10, that you
[1:01:32] might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[1:01:36] pleasing, being fruitful in every good
[1:01:40] work, and increasing in the knowledge of
[1:01:44] God, strengthened with all might
[1:01:47] according to his glorious power unto all
[1:01:52] patience and longsuffering.
[1:02:02] Yeah, I pulled it up.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; It says joyfulness.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; I mean, I wanted to pull that up to make
[1:02:09] sure I wasn't overlooking that word.
[1:02:10] I've got them letters that big right
[1:02:12] now. And that's that's exactly what he
[1:02:14] said.
[1:02:17] strengthened
[1:02:20] was almighty according to his glorious
[1:02:22] power unto all patience
[1:02:26] and longsuffering
[1:02:28] with joyfulness.
[1:02:30] Imagine going around a smile on your
[1:02:32] face and people say your bills paid.
[1:02:34] Nope.
[1:02:37] Your rich uncle died. No, it left you a
[1:02:40] fortune. No, he died in a poor house.
[1:02:44] What are you smiling about? I'm a child
[1:02:47] of God.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I was lost and he saved me. I was blind
[1:02:50] and he opened my eyes. He delivered me.
[1:02:53] Set me free. Oh, you've got so much more
[1:02:55] to be happy for than you got to be sad
[1:02:57] about.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] 1 Thessalonians 1:3, remembering without
[1:03:05] ceasing your work of faith. Oh my.
[1:03:12] And labor of love and patience of hope.
[1:03:18] Now, not now just patience with hope in
[1:03:20] this verse, but your patience of hope.
[1:03:25] So, you're waiting on hope. And this is
[1:03:28] the way you're waiting for it.
[1:03:30] patiently.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there when it seem
[1:03:32] like there's no hope in sight and you're
[1:03:35] patiently waiting for hope, which is
[1:03:37] faith's little weakest sister,
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; but you get so desperate and you seem
[1:03:41] like faith. Oh my, it's so so far out.
[1:03:44] You say, "I'll settle for a little bit
[1:03:45] of hope right now." Cuz even sister hope
[1:03:47] can help and you ain't got no hope.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Glory. And patience of hope and our Lord
[1:03:54] Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our
[1:03:57] father. Hebrews 6:11. And we desire that
[1:04:01] every one of you do show the same
[1:04:04] diligence to full assurance of hope unto
[1:04:08] the end. That you be not slothful,
[1:04:12] but followers of them who through faith
[1:04:17] and
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; inherit
[1:04:25] the promises.
[1:04:27] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Lance, you know what I realized when I
[1:04:34] was studying on this yesterday?
[1:04:37] I realized
[1:04:41] as a family, church family too, we
[1:04:45] patiently waited, patiently waited for
[1:04:48] God to bring healing to Erica, for God
[1:04:52] to bring healing to some of your loved
[1:04:54] ones
[1:04:55] that he took.
[1:04:58] We waited. We believed. We claimed the
[1:05:00] promise. We waited with patience
[1:05:05] for him to heal them,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; but he didn't.
[1:05:10] So, he took them. And it just struck me
[1:05:13] yesterday.
[1:05:15] So, our patience has not stopped,
[1:05:20] but it's only shifted directions.
[1:05:23] So now, instead of patiently waiting for
[1:05:27] them to be healed,
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; we're patiently waiting for them to get
[1:05:32] up.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; So the trial does not stop. Even when it
[1:05:39] changes direction, our patience is still
[1:05:42] ongoing.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; You saw it, oh man, when you wait for
[1:05:46] the Holy Ghost. Oh, I am the Lord, help
[1:05:48] me. Please help me. And you patiently
[1:05:50] waited. That was the end of it. No, God
[1:05:52] will just change the direction because
[1:05:55] he wants your patience to get to a
[1:05:58] certain level and he will not stop until
[1:06:02] you have arrived. It hit me Carol
[1:06:05] yesterday as I study him. Then Lord, we
[1:06:08] are still waiting. We are waiting
[1:06:11] patiently for what? For the morning
[1:06:15] between 7 and 9:00.
[1:06:19] I'm not sure if that's Central Standard
[1:06:21] Time. If that's New Zealand time, I
[1:06:23] really don't even care. All I know is
[1:06:25] I'm waiting patiently. Well, it's
[1:06:28] patience. I am waiting for the day.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. When Brother Daniel Nun is
[1:06:33] going to walk into my house and there
[1:06:36] will be Brother Calvin Ward and there
[1:06:38] will be on and on and on and on. You
[1:06:40] talking about a meeting and a gathering
[1:06:43] time we're going to have and my patience
[1:06:46] will see me through.
[1:06:49] So don't throw away your patience
[1:06:53] because God doesn't answer the prayer
[1:06:55] the way you think
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; he should have.
[1:07:02] Be not slothful.
[1:07:05] So I mean Christians can be slothful.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; How are they slothful?
[1:07:10] By not having faith and patience.
[1:07:13] still a Christian
[1:07:16] who through faith and patience
[1:07:20] inherit the promise. You see, these are
[1:07:23] qualities that are absolutely essential
[1:07:27] to the steadfastness of the people of
[1:07:30] God in the age that we live in. And many
[1:07:33] of those who inherited the promises that
[1:07:35] we have made, great heroes of faith, no
[1:07:39] doubt they were so weary and their
[1:07:42] faith, it was so strong, but without
[1:07:45] being coupled with patience, their
[1:07:48] strong, magnanimous faith would have run
[1:07:52] out.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; They believe God could still do it. Oh
[1:07:55] yes, God's great. God can do this. God
[1:07:58] can do all that. God can do that. That's
[1:08:00] wonderful. But without patience,
[1:08:04] a human being draws up and swivels and
[1:08:09] their blooms turn down.
[1:08:12] Oh my.
[1:08:15] Listen to what the prophet said about
[1:08:18] Noah. I love this statue of a perfect
[1:08:21] this perfect man because he gives us
[1:08:24] examples of these virtues. Noah had
[1:08:29] patience. Yeah. Noah had real godly
[1:08:32] patience. God said, "I'm going to
[1:08:34] destroy this world with rain." And Noah
[1:08:36] preached 13 seconds.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; How long?
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; 120 years.
[1:08:49] Plenty of patience. He says, "Not even
[1:08:52] do fell from heaven.
[1:08:55] wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever
[1:08:58] was 120 years. But he was patient.
[1:09:01] Brother, I'll tell you one thing. Faith
[1:09:03] is a great thing. Faith alone would have
[1:09:06] never carried Noah through.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; You got to keep believing. God, I don't
[1:09:11] know what's going on. I don't
[1:09:13] understand. Don't you see why we need
[1:09:15] this? faith will still believe him. But
[1:09:18] people with great faith that don't have
[1:09:21] patience can still not inherit the
[1:09:23] promises because we emphasize so much on
[1:09:27] faith. And patience is the quiet humble
[1:09:31] little sister.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't need faith. Oh, no, we
[1:09:36] don't need faith. We you know, we we got
[1:09:38] we got this and we got No, we need all
[1:09:40] of them. All of them makes us that
[1:09:44] complete Christian that is stable in
[1:09:47] God's promise even when he knocks the
[1:09:50] wind out of you. That's one thing when
[1:09:52] demons come by your way and they wind up
[1:09:55] their old fist and they hit you boy so
[1:09:58] hard and knock you down and you
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; but it's totally different when Jesus
[1:10:05] does it.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:10:12] And he's standing there and looking at
[1:10:13] you when you're
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; you can't even say help.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; But he's got confidence in you.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; And you get back up,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; wipe yourself off and say, "I'm going
[1:10:27] back to church.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to church on Sunday morning."
[1:10:30] You get to trying to church on Sunday
[1:10:32] morning. This person didn't speak to
[1:10:33] you. Somebody had your favorite parking
[1:10:35] spot out here on the parking lot. Then
[1:10:37] you come inside church and somebody has
[1:10:39] your pew and you you're just really
[1:10:42] fighting the devil. I mean, you're going
[1:10:43] through pure hell time I get up here.
[1:10:45] Your parking spot's gone, your favorite
[1:10:47] pews gone, and beside that, somebody
[1:10:49] that you don't like come right in and
[1:10:51] sit down by you, and you saying, "How in
[1:10:53] the world can I ever get anything out of
[1:10:55] church,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; patience,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; sir?"
[1:11:02] Yes, sir.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying that to none of you
[1:11:05] good little darlings here. Boy, we have
[1:11:08] some rascals to stream these services,
[1:11:09] though. So, I'm no doubt a lot of that
[1:11:12] went for them.
[1:11:14] Now, notice he said just as dusty as it
[1:11:18] ever was for 120 years. But he was
[1:11:22] patient. You imagine laboring, building,
[1:11:24] sweating, people laughing, making fun of
[1:11:27] him, ridicule him. Noah said, "Boys,
[1:11:29] don't pay no attention to them. Go on in
[1:11:31] town. Get the nails. Get the pitch. Get
[1:11:32] this, that, and the other. Come on right
[1:11:34] back out. Say, "Hey." Hey, ain't you in
[1:11:38] that ark cult?
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I hear that your daddy said, "God
[1:11:48] God spoke to him and told him to build
[1:11:52] an ark."
[1:11:54] Who ever heard of such a thing? Matter
[1:11:56] of fact, it's the first time that word
[1:11:58] was ever used in the Bible.
[1:12:00] So, it must have been a very strange
[1:12:02] object.
[1:12:04] I feel sorry for you poor boys because
[1:12:07] you were brought up in that cult. But
[1:12:10] we've got some pamphlets and some
[1:12:12] YouTube videos that will help liberate
[1:12:15] you all from that art cult. Imagine
[1:12:22] the daughter-in-laws go to town to buy
[1:12:25] food and this and that. He said, "You
[1:12:27] poor things. Won't Noah let y'all even
[1:12:30] trim your dead ends." Well, look here.
[1:12:33] Here's a fine mascara place and here's a
[1:12:36] a this and that and this. You poor
[1:12:38] saints. We feel so sorry for you.
[1:12:42] And they were humans like you. Can you
[1:12:44] imagine them coming back and telling
[1:12:45] their husbands, "They're calling us a
[1:12:47] cult.
[1:12:49] They say we're following a man."
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; They were,
[1:13:00] but it just so happened to be the right
[1:13:02] man.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You imagine Noah going to town
[1:13:09] going to get his building permit.
[1:13:13] So he goes through this red tape, that
[1:13:15] red tape, that red tape. I was like,
[1:13:16] "Okay, sir." So next, next Noah. Noah
[1:13:21] something. No. Who's Noah? Who's Noah?
[1:13:23] It's me. It's me.
[1:13:25] So Noah comes in said, "And and what is
[1:13:27] it that you're want to build, sir?"
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:13:37] You said chicken coop. And ain't no
[1:13:39] chicken coop.
[1:13:42] What? What? Explain it. Well, it's 75 ft
[1:13:47] tall and 300 ft long. It's, you know,
[1:13:50] that three stories. I said, Lord have
[1:13:52] mercy, son. What are you building? We
[1:13:55] ain't never seen nothing like this. He
[1:13:57] said, cuz ain't never been nothing like
[1:13:59] it.
[1:14:02] Ain't never been nothing like it. Well,
[1:14:04] we'll definitely have to go before the
[1:14:05] board and see. I mean, what what about
[1:14:07] the wiring? What about the plumbing?
[1:14:09] What about the residency? How many is in
[1:14:11] your family? Well, I I make them the
[1:14:13] bedrooms that that God
[1:14:16] Oh, you mean you hear voices?
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on, brother.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; We have an adjoining building over here
[1:14:25] on the right for people who hear voices.
[1:14:31] I'm glad I can still hear his voice.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Aren't you,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; friends? We look at and say, "Oh, oh, we
[1:14:39] go through so much stuff." Really?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what this man and his
[1:14:45] family must have went through? And how
[1:14:47] the devil tried to get among them?
[1:14:51] And how many did he have?
[1:14:54] 350,000,
[1:14:56] a million followers, 700,000, 40,000.
[1:15:07] Now that would definitely have the
[1:15:09] appearance of a cult.
[1:15:14] If you look up the meaning of cult and
[1:15:16] Mariam and Webster cycle Britannica,
[1:15:19] different ones, you'll find out the
[1:15:22] meaning they designate to it would
[1:15:25] definitely describe Noah
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; and Moses and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and
[1:15:31] Jesus and Peter and James and John and
[1:15:33] Paul and definitely us. So, as long as
[1:15:36] my life is patterned that, I'm good with
[1:15:39] Mariam.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I'm good. Aren't you?
[1:15:45] So, he didn't just have faith, but he
[1:15:48] had patience.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Patience.
[1:15:53] And I said, "No, I want you to go ahead
[1:15:54] and get in the ark cuz I'm going to run
[1:15:56] the animals in there."
[1:16:00] Okay. So, now he completes it and God
[1:16:05] tells him, "Y'all go on in." He said,
[1:16:08] "Okay. All right. Praise the Lord." Here
[1:16:10] it here it comes. Here it comes.
[1:16:13] So we said, "Lord, how do I communicate
[1:16:16] with the animals?"
[1:16:18] So me and my boys go out and we get a
[1:16:20] pair of this and a pair of this. I've
[1:16:22] got it all took care of.
[1:16:24] I will divinely speak to everyone who's
[1:16:28] supposed to be on the boat.
[1:16:31] I believe he's still doing the same
[1:16:32] thing of the day now we're living in.
[1:16:35] Well, praise be to God. Can you all
[1:16:37] imagine an old box turtle, him and his
[1:16:39] misses? Come on, honey. You're taking
[1:16:41] forever. So, here they go. Well, they
[1:16:44] had to give them a two-eek notice before
[1:16:45] everybody else. Hallelujah. Come on,
[1:16:47] honey. I'm getting wore out. What in the
[1:16:49] world are you doing? Here they go. Here
[1:16:51] they go. But the art can't leave without
[1:16:53] the box turtle. Oh, I'm so glad that God
[1:16:56] had a box turtle because well, I feel
[1:16:57] like we got some Christians like that in
[1:16:59] our church. The giraffe is already in
[1:17:01] the boat. The elephant's already been in
[1:17:03] the boat. The racehorse is already in
[1:17:05] the boat. Way in the back is the box
[1:17:07] turtle. But we ain't going without the
[1:17:10] box turtle. No, I'm not leaving you
[1:17:13] here. No, I'm not giving up on you. No,
[1:17:17] I am not. I am not.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And don't you give up on me either.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Imagine every 45 minutes you say,
[1:17:34] I'm more out. Are you said Lord have
[1:17:36] mercy? This is killing me. Said, "Can we
[1:17:38] stop a bit?" Said, "Yeah, let's just
[1:17:39] take a breather." So they'd hang out.
[1:17:41] Hang out. Here go the kangaroo. Just
[1:17:44] There goes the ostrich.
[1:17:47] Said, "Y'all be careful now."
[1:17:50] But you ain't gone without us.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when Noah, they finally
[1:17:59] approved his building permit. I said,
[1:18:00] "Now before you can actually move in and
[1:18:04] us give you a certificate of occupancy,
[1:18:09] what do you have planned in this
[1:18:10] anyway?"
[1:18:14] Well, it's really hard to explain.
[1:18:18] It's like, well, to be honest with you,
[1:18:20] I don't understand it all myself, but
[1:18:23] from the best I understand, the heavens
[1:18:25] is going to break loose and the
[1:18:27] fountains of the deep are also going to
[1:18:29] break loose, too.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And then they're all going to come up.
[1:18:32] And then the stuff called rain. Remember
[1:18:34] that word had never been used before.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Rain. What is rain? Well, the best I
[1:18:40] understand is something about moisture
[1:18:43] and clouds. What's a cloud?
[1:18:46] We've never had clouts.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Imagine manoy. Believe them poor people.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I feel so sorry for them.
[1:18:59] They're following a man that says he
[1:19:02] talks to God and lights and rain and
[1:19:05] pillars of fire. And
[1:19:12] you imagine when he go down the street
[1:19:14] and needed some more 20 penny nails to
[1:19:16] finish it up. I said, "Look at it." Here
[1:19:18] it comes. How you doing?
[1:19:23] Doing good. How y'all doing?
[1:19:26] Doing pretty good. So that's good cuz it
[1:19:28] won't be lasting much longer for you.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm telling you, unless you get in
[1:19:34] the ark, you're going to die.
[1:19:39] So you know what some of them people
[1:19:40] done? They started building their own
[1:19:42] arcs.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; So the prophets said they built their
[1:19:47] own. So they said, "Hey, you know what?
[1:19:49] This there might be something to this."
[1:19:51] So they started building their own, but
[1:19:52] it wasn't God constructed.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; So they mimicked Christianity with a
[1:19:58] much easier way. Now you can come in our
[1:20:00] ark and do anything you want to do. This
[1:20:03] is grace ark. This is community ark.
[1:20:06] This is mercy ark. This is And boy, they
[1:20:08] go to naming them arcs everywhere. So if
[1:20:10] it started out with one, now you got
[1:20:12] them on every corner,
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; churches.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Now notice how the prophet dramatizes
[1:20:21] this. Now I want to tell these people
[1:20:23] tomorrow what I've been preaching for
[1:20:25] 120 years is going to take place.
[1:20:29] Go down there and tell them what was the
[1:20:32] first sign Noah got in the ark. Wasn't
[1:20:34] no rain. Noah laid the first day. No
[1:20:38] rain.
[1:20:40] It's going to happen. I hear Miss Noah
[1:20:42] coming at us and say, "Dad,
[1:20:46] are you sure?"
[1:20:50] That was bad enough when them people out
[1:20:52] there laughed at him.
[1:20:54] But when his wife,
[1:20:57] those close to you,
[1:21:01] a dad, you know, I love you. I've cooked
[1:21:05] you many a meal and washed your clothes
[1:21:07] and bore your children, but maybe maybe
[1:21:12] you need to look at this. I mean,
[1:21:14] because we've searched the archives and
[1:21:16] we cannot find a newspaper or article
[1:21:19] anywhere that says so many people died
[1:21:22] and fell off that bridge.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; I mean, y'all just need to face the
[1:21:26] facts, which are
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Let's look at some facts.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:21:36] was a man killer. Facts.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Truth was still God's prophet.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jonah was a backsliding prophet,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; but he was still God's prophet. Let's
[1:21:48] take facts and faith and truth. I don't
[1:21:50] mind doing it a lot. As a matter of
[1:21:52] fact, we could start from the book of
[1:21:53] Genesis and run it right on down and
[1:21:56] realize God has always used failing
[1:21:59] human beings to do his great
[1:22:02] accomplishment on the earth. And he will
[1:22:04] bring the finale with the same thing.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:22:11] I can hear Mrs. Noah coming around and
[1:22:13] said, "Dad, are you sure? Don't talk
[1:22:15] like that. He had patience cuz he had
[1:22:19] faith." Yes, sir. He had virtue. He had
[1:22:22] knowledge that God was right. He had
[1:22:24] temperance. He didn't find loose and
[1:22:25] say, "Well, I don't know what's all
[1:22:27] about. I lost my popularity out there.
[1:22:29] No, no, people don't don't care for me
[1:22:31] no more. I'll go out there and start
[1:22:33] over again."
[1:22:35] He had patience. God promised God will
[1:22:40] do it.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And Word of Life Church said,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I can see a son come around and say,
[1:22:49] "Dad,"
[1:22:51] stroking his hand over his long gray
[1:22:53] hair. You know, he was hundreds
[1:22:57] of years old.
[1:23:00] Wow. Hundreds
[1:23:04] of years old. his son come to him now,
[1:23:06] daddy. Daddy, look, we love you,
[1:23:12] but don't you think maybe maybe that
[1:23:15] wasn't God? Maybe it wasn't God. You
[1:23:19] went through the prayer line and be be
[1:23:21] honest. You're worse.
[1:23:24] You're worse. You feel worse.
[1:23:27] Maybe you just need to accept the fact
[1:23:30] that you're not going to get healed.
[1:23:32] That it's not God's will and this and
[1:23:34] that and the other. Boy, it's one thing
[1:23:35] if a sinner tells you that if it's your
[1:23:37] wife, your husband, somebody you go to
[1:23:40] church with. I wish somebody would hear
[1:23:41] me preach today.
[1:23:44] Hallelujah.
[1:23:47] Oh my.
[1:23:49] I know you're an old patriarch and I I
[1:23:52] love you, daddy.
[1:23:56] Woo. How many's ever been told that
[1:23:58] before? Maybe not call daddy, but call
[1:24:01] best friend or I love you, brother. I'm
[1:24:04] just concerned about you. I'm just
[1:24:07] concerned you're you're going to that
[1:24:09] church over there and I've heard the
[1:24:10] office bunch of stuff that ever was.
[1:24:13] Well, my advice to you would be come and
[1:24:16] see. Come and see. Don't take this
[1:24:19] person's word or another person's word,
[1:24:21] but come and see and experience the
[1:24:24] living God. Oh, but I love you, Daddy.
[1:24:29] Oh,
[1:24:31] could it have been possible
[1:24:34] that you would have been a little bit?
[1:24:39] Now watch how it starts.
[1:24:41] Never
[1:24:43] great big. No. Is there some way you was
[1:24:46] just a little little tiny bit wrong?
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:57] Oh no. No. Why? God says so.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Well, daddy, this is six days that we've
[1:25:04] set up here. You imagine them thousands
[1:25:06] times thousands of people sitting on the
[1:25:08] outside. Hey, Noah, I thought you said
[1:25:11] it was going to rain six days ago. What
[1:25:14] in the world are y'all doing? Y'all
[1:25:15] better get out of there. What if that
[1:25:17] thing catch us on fire? Now, we've got
[1:25:19] the CO2 meter out here, and there's no
[1:25:22] way you're going to be able to live
[1:25:23] because all the things going on inside
[1:25:25] that arc, all them animals, y'all better
[1:25:27] run while you can. You better leave.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; oh my
[1:25:37] pitched inside and out. We've been all
[1:25:39] these years building on it. And you
[1:25:42] stood out there and preached till you
[1:25:43] turned gray and bald.
[1:25:47] I hope to the mercy of the Lord I
[1:25:48] fulfill that first part but not the last
[1:25:50] one.
[1:25:53] And here you are up here now trying to
[1:25:55] say such and such and the people are
[1:25:58] laughing throwing rotten tomatoes.
[1:26:04] Look what you've been doing.
[1:26:06] Be patient, son.
[1:26:10] Be patient, son. Are you sure?
[1:26:13] You need to hear him say this now. And
[1:26:15] the way that he says it, he says it with
[1:26:18] such a strong, adamant voice. It will
[1:26:22] rain.
[1:26:25] His daughter-in-law said, "Father,
[1:26:28] it will rain,
[1:26:32] but you've been all these years waiting.
[1:26:34] We've been preparing and you told us it
[1:26:36] was going to rain a week ago and we're
[1:26:38] in here and the doors are all shut and
[1:26:41] here we all walking around in here and
[1:26:43] the sun scorching right down but it will
[1:26:46] rain.
[1:26:49] Isn't it amazing that God tried his
[1:26:51] patience in building it? tried his
[1:26:53] patience in the animals. And then once
[1:26:56] they get sealed in,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; they're sealed in and now they're
[1:27:01] waiting for the finale of what? Patience
[1:27:05] to finally mature in the final stage.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Now, what if he didn't let his patience
[1:27:12] go and he walked in the door? All right,
[1:27:13] now it's 15 minutes. We'll give God 15
[1:27:15] minutes. If it don't 15 minutes, we're
[1:27:17] dismissing this church. We're selling it
[1:27:18] all. We're leaving the property. We're
[1:27:20] all leaving the message. What are you
[1:27:21] talking about leaving the message?
[1:27:25] All the scriptures that talk of this
[1:27:28] message, all the scriptures that are in
[1:27:30] this message, when people say they're
[1:27:32] leaving the message, I mean they're
[1:27:33] leaving the new birth, too.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; They're leaving water baptism, they're
[1:27:37] leaving grace, they're leaving mercy.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:27:46] but he had patience.
[1:27:51] Now, when you get that way, add it.
[1:27:56] But if you ain't got it that way, don't
[1:27:58] try to add it. It won't work.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; It won't work on healing. It won't work
[1:28:04] on nothing else. It's got to blend in
[1:28:05] with the same material. It's vulcanized,
[1:28:08] too. That's right. You've got to add it.
[1:28:10] Patience with God's promise.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Noah believed it and he had
[1:28:17] patience with God
[1:28:20] 120 years.
[1:28:22] I want every person in this building
[1:28:26] that has been asking God for a certain
[1:28:28] thing
[1:28:30] and waiting on God,
[1:28:33] every person visibly and every person
[1:28:36] that'll ever hear this recording.
[1:28:39] I want you to stand to your feet right
[1:28:41] now. If you've been waiting as long as
[1:28:43] Noah,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; send me your photo.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; If you're going to email us,
[1:28:57] I want somebody
[1:29:00] to say it and say, "I've been waiting
[1:29:03] for 120 years."
[1:29:06] There might be some that'll do it, but
[1:29:07] we know
[1:29:12] And you will give up after five.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; You will give up after three. You will
[1:29:17] give up after four years and say, "Well,
[1:29:20] God ain't going to do it."
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible here speaking of Abraham, our
[1:29:33] father.
[1:29:35] Hebrews 6:15.
[1:29:42] And so after he had patiently
[1:29:46] endured,
[1:29:48] he obtained
[1:29:51] the promise.
[1:29:53] I'm convinced, friends,
[1:29:55] the problem with many of us of us is not
[1:29:58] a lack of faith.
[1:30:01] It's a lack of patience.
[1:30:05] patience toward God and patience toward
[1:30:09] one another.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Many of you may have great patience when
[1:30:12] it comes to God, but when it comes to
[1:30:15] dealing with your fellow man
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; or your fellow church member
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; or them sorry outfits you work with on
[1:30:22] your job, even if they are your nephews
[1:30:26] or your uncles or whoever they are.
[1:30:29] Hebrews 10:36,
[1:30:32] "For ye have need of patience,
[1:30:37] that after you have done the will of
[1:30:40] God,
[1:30:42] you might receive."
[1:30:46] But, Brother Donnie, I prayed for my
[1:30:48] daughter. I prayed for my son. He's
[1:30:49] getting worse. I come through the prayer
[1:30:51] line. I held a prayer closet in my hand,
[1:30:53] and wouldn't you know it, after they got
[1:30:54] prayed for, they've done worse and
[1:30:56] worse. But you have need of patience, my
[1:30:58] brother. You have need of patience, my
[1:31:01] sisters, that after, notice, you have
[1:31:03] need of patience after you have done the
[1:31:05] will of God, you might receive the
[1:31:09] promise. Look at the order of events
[1:31:12] that happens many times with a believer.
[1:31:14] So you had need a patient. Well, faith
[1:31:17] is enough, isn't it? No.
[1:31:21] No.
[1:31:24] Oh my.
[1:31:27] Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:31:31] had patience with God.
[1:31:34] Yes, sir. Moses said, "I've heard the
[1:31:35] cry of my people and I've seen the
[1:31:37] afflictions. I'm coming down to deliver
[1:31:39] them. I'm going to send you down." A
[1:31:42] little contrast there between him and
[1:31:43] God. God showed him his glory and he
[1:31:46] said, "Here I go." Well, once he seen
[1:31:48] the glory of God, he had faith. He got
[1:31:51] down there and the first thing the
[1:31:52] contrast come out there and said, "The
[1:31:55] Lord God said, let my people go." And
[1:31:58] Pharaoh, I want you to know this. I've
[1:32:00] come as a representative of God and you
[1:32:03] must obey me.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh said, "Obey.
[1:32:13] Do you know who I am? I am Pharaoh. obey
[1:32:19] you a slave.
[1:32:25] You see the pharaoh you may be dealing
[1:32:27] with may be a besetting sin.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Or it could be a sickness or a disease.
[1:32:33] Could be a temper. Could be this that
[1:32:35] and the other. And it will try to speak
[1:32:38] to you with an authoritative voice. I am
[1:32:41] your master.
[1:32:44] Your grandpa was this way. Your daddy
[1:32:46] was this way. your uncles was this way.
[1:32:48] It runs in your family,
[1:32:51] but you need to turn right back around
[1:32:53] and say, "But I am a son or a daughter
[1:32:56] of God."
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh said, "Obey. Do you know who I
[1:33:04] am? I'm Pharaoh. Obey you a slave." He
[1:33:07] said, "You'll obey me or perish.
[1:33:12] You'll do either one you want to do."
[1:33:15] And the church said,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; I'm totally convinced, friends, I know
[1:33:18] you've heard me say it a lot and I'll
[1:33:19] keep on saying it. If people's going to
[1:33:20] do what they want to do, if people want
[1:33:22] to live just a watershed Christian life,
[1:33:24] that's all they're going to do. The
[1:33:25] roots is going to be right on the top of
[1:33:27] the ground. They go by feelings, they go
[1:33:28] by emotions, they go by pulsation, they
[1:33:30] go by impressions of things. I feel led
[1:33:32] to do this, feel led to do that. Has no
[1:33:35] substantial root growth if they take it
[1:33:37] right back to the word. And they're
[1:33:38] constantly up and down, up and down. But
[1:33:40] I don't care how many there are like
[1:33:42] that. God's got people around the world
[1:33:45] that have been planted in Christ Jesus
[1:33:47] the word. They love feelings, but they
[1:33:49] don't let feelings lead them. They can
[1:33:52] be impressed, but they don't let
[1:33:53] impressions lead them if they're
[1:33:55] contrary to the word. Come on, somebody
[1:33:57] say, "Amen." God wants you and I to be
[1:33:59] the type of Christian that we can be
[1:34:02] watered deep. And when trouble comes, we
[1:34:04] say, "You ain't moving me sickness. You
[1:34:06] ain't moving me devil. You ain't moving
[1:34:09] me pain. You ain't moving me anxiety.
[1:34:12] And you ain't moving me self-pity.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:26] Now, we know when Moses got down there
[1:34:28] and he had these supernatural signs
[1:34:31] which have no record in the scripture
[1:34:33] that ever been done before. And Moses
[1:34:35] thinks he's one of a kind.
[1:34:38] So he'd done some signs and God said,
[1:34:41] "Now pick up that stick. Throw it down.
[1:34:43] Pick it up." And he said, "Praise God.
[1:34:45] I'll tell you one thing, boy. Here I
[1:34:47] go." He gets down there in Janice and
[1:34:49] Chambers is in the court of Egypt.
[1:34:52] Right there they are in Pharaoh's
[1:34:53] palace. So Moses throws down his eye.
[1:34:57] How you like that, big boy? So Pharaoh
[1:35:00] said, "Hey Janice, you and Jamus, come
[1:35:02] here." So they go,
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Moses said,
[1:35:07] "Lord, I thought I was the only one that
[1:35:09] could do that."
[1:35:11] Well, between me and you, I didn't tell
[1:35:12] you that. You just thought that in your
[1:35:15] own mind cuz you thought you were so
[1:35:16] special.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; So them snakes go to crawling around. Oh
[1:35:22] my goodness. You imagine right there and
[1:35:24] they all jumping back. They go to crawl
[1:35:26] around. In a minute, you know what
[1:35:27] happened? Moses snake went over and
[1:35:29] swallowed theirs up. You know where that
[1:35:32] snake was? It wound up being in that
[1:35:34] rod. My hallelujah. Moses conquered the
[1:35:37] Red Sea. Moses conquered all the rest of
[1:35:39] it with them serpents inside that rod.
[1:35:42] Death was swallowed up in victory.
[1:35:45] Hallelujah. It's the same with our Lord
[1:35:47] Jesus. He wants to take that thing that
[1:35:50] bothers you and swallow it up and let
[1:35:52] you overcome every day of your life.
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:36:01] When you've done exactly what he says do
[1:36:05] and it seems like it went wrong.
[1:36:08] Stand still.
[1:36:11] Be patient. Moses said, "You know, when
[1:36:14] I was laid on the foundation, there was
[1:36:16] patience laid on. I just wait and see
[1:36:18] what God will do." That old serpent
[1:36:21] crawling around blowing and hissing one
[1:36:24] at another.
[1:36:26] First thing you know, Moses serpent went
[1:36:28] gulp
[1:36:32] and gulped them all down. He had
[1:36:35] patience.
[1:36:37] I find this amazing that he attributed
[1:36:39] the gulping to patience instead of
[1:36:42] faith. Maybe that's the reason some of
[1:36:44] you ain't gulping your enemies.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; You think cuz you've got such great
[1:36:48] faith. Praise God. I can call God down.
[1:36:51] I can do this with my faith. My faith.
[1:36:53] But have you got patience? Have you got
[1:36:56] patience with your faith that you can
[1:36:58] say, "Well, I'll wait. I'll just wait
[1:36:59] and see what God will do." Well, how
[1:37:01] long have I got to wait? However long it
[1:37:02] takes.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Let's jump down here to the Hebrew
[1:37:12] children. The Hebrew children had
[1:37:15] patience. Sure they did. God had
[1:37:17] promised them and told them, "Won't you
[1:37:18] bow to no image?" But they had patience.
[1:37:21] Our God's able. Nevertheless, we're not
[1:37:23] going to battle your image. See patience
[1:37:26] knowing this that God would raise him up
[1:37:28] in the last days. They started walking
[1:37:31] up the ramp. One looked to the other.
[1:37:35] We got patience.
[1:37:37] One step, God wasn't there.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Two steps,
[1:37:45] he wasn't there.
[1:37:47] Three steps, four steps, five steps,
[1:37:50] just kept going. He wasn't there.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Anybody feel like that?
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Well, you take one and another and you
[1:38:01] know at the first step, well, he's going
[1:38:02] to be right there by you and you take
[1:38:04] it. Where are you, Lord?
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, that makes me
[1:38:07] nervous.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That tears me up. Shows I need more
[1:38:11] patience.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And it shows you do, too.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:38:16] Oh my. Five steps just kept going.
[1:38:20] Sydney wasn't there.
[1:38:22] stepped right off into the fiery
[1:38:25] furnace.
[1:38:28] They had patience,
[1:38:30] but he was there.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Which would have been the greater
[1:38:34] miracle? Step one or the furnace? Step
[1:38:39] two or the furnace? Step three, step
[1:38:42] four. Step five, which was the greater
[1:38:45] miracle? You tell me. Was step three.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Step four, step five. Where was the
[1:38:51] greater miracle?
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; The furnace.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; The furnace. Don't you see what he wants
[1:38:56] sometimes out of our lives? He wants
[1:38:58] furnace message believers.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; It's evident. We've got step one message
[1:39:04] believer, step two, step three, step
[1:39:06] four, step five. But God wants furnace
[1:39:11] message believers.
[1:39:15] You imagine that fire being so hot the
[1:39:19] closer they got. They were sweating way
[1:39:21] worse than I am this morning. Sweat
[1:39:23] running down their face, running down
[1:39:25] their backs. They stood there and they
[1:39:27] could feel the heat and their skin,
[1:39:30] their flesh, feeling it and the singing
[1:39:33] of the hair on their arms and their
[1:39:35] hands.
[1:39:36] And them men who threw them in, it
[1:39:39] killed them.
[1:39:42] And they're thinking, "Lord God, where
[1:39:45] are you? Where are you?" But we still
[1:39:48] believe you. We still believe you.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; People think, children, that when
[1:39:55] somebody's fighting a terminal disease
[1:39:57] and God doesn't heal them, think, well,
[1:39:59] they lost the battle to cancer. That is
[1:40:02] a lie from the pits of hell.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; If they are a believer, they never lost
[1:40:08] that battle.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Yes sir.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:21] By their faith and patience, they
[1:40:24] brought out a manifestation
[1:40:27] of the almighty God that had not been
[1:40:30] before and has never been since
[1:40:34] by three Hebrew boys.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Now, let me close.
[1:40:41] What about three Kentucky boys
[1:40:45] or Tennessee boys or Virginia boys or
[1:40:49] North Carolina girls or South Carolina
[1:40:53] we'll even give a little grace and say
[1:40:55] Illinois
[1:40:58] bunch of Yankees
[1:41:02] even Canadians.
[1:41:06] Hallelujah. We say, "Oh, if I could only
[1:41:09] been them Hebrew boys." Let me tell you
[1:41:11] something. Some of you have been through
[1:41:13] more than they've been through.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Because they went through one trial in
[1:41:17] their life. One trial like this. And
[1:41:22] they overcome and have been preached for
[1:41:26] thousands of years.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; You live in the middle of hell.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Satan's eaten.
[1:41:35] Oh Jesus.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Do you live one day without your
[1:41:38] thoughts being violated by Satan?
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Do you have a fivehour period in a day
[1:41:45] where there's nothing but total peace in
[1:41:47] your mind?
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You're living right in the middle of
[1:41:51] hell.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You've heard me say it for years. Eve
[1:41:56] lived in a perfect paradise and could
[1:41:59] not live right. And yeah, sure you are
[1:42:02] in the middle of hell.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Satan's eating. Remember when the
[1:42:08] prophet was sitting there JC Penney
[1:42:10] store at that mall and many of you have
[1:42:11] been there
[1:42:14] and he said them women going up that
[1:42:16] escalator speaking Spanish and different
[1:42:18] languages and he said there I was back
[1:42:22] in hell
[1:42:24] again
[1:42:26] and you live in it every day of your
[1:42:29] life. It ain't no wonder you don't you
[1:42:32] can't pray.
[1:42:34] Oh my. Brother Fred had sent me a quote
[1:42:37] the other day where brother Random asked
[1:42:38] him a question. Brother Brandon, why
[1:42:39] can't as believers and followers of the
[1:42:41] message, why can't we pray and have
[1:42:43] revival
[1:42:45] and feel like we want to feel?
[1:42:49] He said, "Well, my brother, sister, the
[1:42:52] revival
[1:42:53] is over.
[1:42:58] I believe that for the nation.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; I believe that globally, but I don't
[1:43:03] believe it's over for an individual.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz the prophet goes on to tell us
[1:43:08] sometime thereafter, you never let
[1:43:10] revival die inside of you.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We don't want to come
[1:43:14] in here and sit down and say, "Well, we
[1:43:16] can't have a move of God cuz the prophet
[1:43:18] of God said revival's dead." It is dead
[1:43:20] for the world. It is dead for the
[1:43:23] denominational system, but it should not
[1:43:26] be dead between the bride and her
[1:43:30] husband. She ought to have more passion,
[1:43:33] more love, more desire for him than
[1:43:36] she's ever had in her life.
[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you in the stand.
[1:43:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:59] Don't you love him with all your heart?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:44:06] We'll start a prayer line here this
[1:44:08] morning. Everybody come over on this
[1:44:09] side here.
[1:44:11] Who needs patience?
[1:44:14] Well, that'll be a quick one, won't it?
[1:44:18] But don't you worry about getting tired.
[1:44:20] There won't be nobody to come through
[1:44:21] it. God, I pray you give them trouble.
[1:44:24] God, stir their marriage. God, cause
[1:44:26] family problems. After the first prayer,
[1:44:29] everybody say, I feel led to not go
[1:44:31] through.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; But the Lord knows us well enough to
[1:44:40] know
[1:44:42] most of us would never ask for such
[1:44:44] things.
[1:44:46] So he's going to send it to us anyway.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; But don't worry, he won't overwhelm you
[1:44:52] yet would be needless from dissensious
[1:44:54] such trials that would be opposite to
[1:44:57] the desired purpose of what he wants.
[1:45:00] Not to destroy you, but to help you.
[1:45:04] I know you're like me. I've been through
[1:45:06] so many things in life, and in the
[1:45:07] middle of it, I think, I'm not sure I'll
[1:45:09] ever survive this.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure I'll come true.
[1:45:14] Now, I'm going to share something with
[1:45:15] you that may seem very, very strange and
[1:45:17] unusual to you. I have never, since I've
[1:45:21] been a Christian, never one time ever
[1:45:25] wanted to go back on God.
[1:45:31] Never. Not one time.
[1:45:36] I have never contemplated backsliding,
[1:45:40] going back on the Lord. Never have.
[1:45:44] Quit being a pastor.
[1:45:48] Quit being a preacher
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; streaming on the internet every day.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Turn them streamers off and we never
[1:46:02] stream one more service.
[1:46:07] I get these emails and texts and letters
[1:46:10] from moms and dads church.
[1:46:22] [Applause]
[1:46:32] Patience.
[1:46:34] Patience.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Patience.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Patience.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Patience with the pastor.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Patience with the song.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Patience with the singers. Patience with
[1:46:53] the deacons.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Patience with the parents. When you
[1:46:57] deacons get on their children, they get
[1:46:59] mad. And the deacons said,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:47:09] patience.
[1:47:12] The amazing thing of the matter is once
[1:47:14] you get it, you see Noah had arrived to
[1:47:17] the seal of the time of his life.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; When he was sealed in the ark and once
[1:47:23] he arrived at that sealing stage of
[1:47:25] patience, did God say, "Okay, you're
[1:47:28] good. You're good from this point on."
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Uhuh. After he was sealed, then he
[1:47:33] entered into a deeper trial of his
[1:47:36] patience, a different type of trial
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; than he had because before it been out
[1:47:41] there,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; but now once he gets sealed in,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; he's been tried by God in the most
[1:47:48] intimate personal way.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; The person could be tried,
[1:47:53] children, daughters, and
[1:47:56] it wasn't he needed more things. No, but
[1:47:59] now God is trying his sealed stage.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see. That's what I'm looking for.
[1:48:16] That's what I'm looking for.
[1:48:19] When the bride around the world,
[1:48:23] it's all sealed in.
[1:48:26] And then God lets our seal stage of
[1:48:29] faith virt
[1:48:40] God.
[1:48:44] I've told Carol this for many, many
[1:48:46] years
[1:48:48] with all the funerals that I've had to
[1:48:49] preach through the years.
[1:48:52] Maybe this is the one I'm looking for.
[1:48:54] She said,
[1:48:56] I say last
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; one day I'll preach my last year
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; with prayer last prayer.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; But you know what I'm going to do? I'm
[1:49:08] going to go preaching with all my heart
[1:49:10] as safely as I can
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; until the last one arrives.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many more trials and
[1:49:17] tests you're going to have. Keep in mind
[1:49:20] you're looking for that last
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; one of these days that last will be
[1:49:25] conquered.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; The word can say around the world,
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; it's over.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; She's ready.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; It's totally impossible for us to think
[1:49:37] about such a thing happening. Can you
[1:49:40] imagine getting a church of this size?
[1:49:44] All of us ready. Be ready and stay ready
[1:49:47] for restrictive fail. 30 seconds 30
[1:49:51] seconds
[1:49:53] and we all stay ready living in this
[1:49:55] polluted world. We all stay clean,
[1:49:58] curbs, no anxiety, no anger, no stress,
[1:50:00] nothing. We're all just we stay ready
[1:50:02] for 30 seconds after God gets us to that
[1:50:04] ultimate place. Now multiply that by
[1:50:07] thousands of congregations around the
[1:50:09] world and God brings his bride all to
[1:50:12] that place.
[1:50:14] They're all there. They fall around
[1:50:17] and they stay ready for higher long. It
[1:50:20] seems like an impossibility. The
[1:50:23] probability of such high dealing with
[1:50:25] mortals not in horrified place in human.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; It will be his crowning achievement.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Of
[1:50:37] it will stir heaven to such a state of
[1:50:39] escalation.
[1:50:41] The sixth dimension will empty out.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:50:48] And it will cause
[1:50:50] a resurrection.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I believe we're near.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; We can't do that exactly.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Only he
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he will?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:11] Are you going to have patience
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; to wait for that?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Help me.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Now, you see, if you have that patience
[1:51:19] now and you go to the way of the grave,
[1:51:22] don't worry. You will awake
[1:51:26] with that same anticipation.
[1:51:30] Cuz as you go down, you'll raise. You
[1:51:34] see, for those who died with terminal
[1:51:35] sickness and disease and they were
[1:51:37] looking for a new body, a well body, you
[1:51:40] understand when they were raised, that
[1:51:42] same faith they had will be encapsulated
[1:51:45] in that brand new body and they say,
[1:51:47] "Here it is. I've arrived." Because
[1:51:50] whenever they pass, they didn't lose
[1:51:52] their faith.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; that faith will carry them right over.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Your patience will carry you right over.
[1:51:58] Brother said it's not they go to sleep.
[1:52:00] And he said they will awake with that
[1:52:03] same anticipation.
[1:52:06] It's just like they took a little nap,
[1:52:08] but they say, "Praise God, I was looking
[1:52:09] for his coming 2,200 years ago." Well,
[1:52:13] hallelujah. Here it is. Just that quick.
[1:52:18] It'll be there. Peter will awake and
[1:52:21] he'll look around. Paul will awake and
[1:52:22] say, "Well, here it is, saints. Praise
[1:52:24] God. We've been napping. What's it been
[1:52:26] about 5 minutes since Paul has been
[1:52:28] around 2,000 years?" Really? You just
[1:52:30] felt like a little male and the dead in
[1:52:32] Christ should rise first.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:46] Oh Jesus,
[1:52:50] I pray that you'd help each of us today.
[1:52:52] Father,
[1:52:55] you know what we need. Would you move
[1:52:57] this incredible task?
[1:53:01] Dear father, I can't imagine
[1:53:04] some of these brothers here that are
[1:53:05] builders and they get plans and they
[1:53:08] look at the foundation, they look at
[1:53:10] this and that. I've seen brother Phil,
[1:53:13] these different ones. I I couldn't my
[1:53:15] goodness, I couldn't build nothing
[1:53:16] myself, but I see them and they take
[1:53:19] studies and they got the scale there of
[1:53:21] what it's what it is and they got the
[1:53:23] pictures of roof and this and that and
[1:53:25] the other. It looks like an incredible
[1:53:27] task to somebody.
[1:53:30] Then Lord, I take this promise of yours.
[1:53:33] Upon this rock, I will build my church
[1:53:37] and the gates of hell.
[1:53:40] I will prevail against it.
[1:53:43] That's your promise, Jesus.
[1:53:46] Lord, here we stand. And some of us have
[1:53:48] got sheep off. Some of us are still just
[1:53:50] barefest.
[1:53:52] Some of us have plumbed and maybe some
[1:53:54] of us have got wiring.
[1:53:57] But ain't none of us totally completely
[1:53:59] done yet. I figure
[1:54:01] we look around and we think, Lord, will
[1:54:04] it ever be? Yes, it will.
[1:54:08] Hallelujah.
[1:54:11] It was your desire to have a world full
[1:54:15] of sons and daughters of God.
[1:54:19] And you will have it, Lord God.
[1:54:22] For there is nothing you have ever
[1:54:24] desired that has not been yours.
[1:54:28] Help us today, Jesus. I pray for the
[1:54:31] weary, the oppressed, the sick.
[1:54:34] Lord, for those that feel like they
[1:54:35] can't go any farther, and I didn't get
[1:54:37] to it here today, but I've got the quote
[1:54:38] here before me where the prophet said,
[1:54:40] "Brother Brandham, I can't wait. What
[1:54:42] can I do? I I can't go any further." He
[1:54:44] said, "Just keep on going." Said, "But
[1:54:46] brother Brandham, I can't go any
[1:54:48] further. What can I do?" Repeats
[1:54:49] himself. just keep on going.
[1:54:53] So, it's quite simple, but yet so
[1:54:56] profound. So, maybe they're at what they
[1:54:58] feel like a standill in their life. They
[1:55:01] aren't growing. They aren't in that
[1:55:04] stage and think, "Lord, what what's
[1:55:05] going on with me?"
[1:55:07] Carol and I have noticed this corn field
[1:55:09] that's right down below the church here.
[1:55:12] It's on our way. And I've passed it. My
[1:55:15] goodness, I don't know how many days in
[1:55:17] the last two months I've been over here
[1:55:19] at the church doing this and that and
[1:55:20] the other. Sometimes four and five trips
[1:55:23] a day watering these baby Christian
[1:55:25] hydrangeas out here.
[1:55:27] And I've passed that corn. I told her, I
[1:55:30] said, "It looks like to me that stuff is
[1:55:32] growing every day." We passed it coming
[1:55:35] to church and she said, "Look at it how
[1:55:36] tall it is, Lord." She said, "Let us
[1:55:39] grow." And I was like, "Yeah, that's
[1:55:41] what we want to do." It's got big old
[1:55:43] ears of corn on it. Now the toss up on
[1:55:45] the top, but before we know it, the
[1:55:49] growing cycle will stop and that it'll
[1:55:53] stand there and dry and dry and dry and
[1:55:55] that farmer will come for the harvest.
[1:55:59] The growing will cease.
[1:56:02] Help us, Lord Jesus, till we can grow
[1:56:05] and grow and grow. And then once we're
[1:56:08] sealed in and the virtues is there and
[1:56:10] we're there at that final stage
[1:56:13] just for a little while in the drying
[1:56:15] time, we lay in the presence of the sun
[1:56:19] and all the greenness be baked out of
[1:56:22] us.
[1:56:23] Grant it. Lord God,
[1:56:26] would you do me a favor? Would you lay
[1:56:29] your hand over on the person standing by
[1:56:30] you? If it's a brother standing by,
[1:56:33] sister, not your wife, you don't feel
[1:56:34] comfortable doing so, just move around
[1:56:35] if you'd like to.
[1:56:38] Let's just offer a word of prayer. You
[1:56:40] never know friends what people come to
[1:56:42] church with
[1:56:46] the burdens, the sorrows,
[1:56:49] the despair, the anguish.
[1:56:52] Hallelujah.
[1:56:54] Lord Jesus, as we have our hands laid
[1:56:57] one upon the other today, Father,
[1:57:00] I believe you're mindful, Lord.
[1:57:04] Dear God,
[1:57:06] we're not praying for each other, but
[1:57:08] we're we're praying for ourel rather,
[1:57:10] but we're praying for each other. Maybe
[1:57:12] it's a brother with a burden. Maybe a
[1:57:14] brother with a besetting sin, a sister
[1:57:16] with a a terrible home life. Lord Jesus,
[1:57:19] you know, and I believe you're mindful,
[1:57:24] Father, at the end of our special
[1:57:25] meeting here and Carol and I left the
[1:57:27] fellowship hall and we were going to go
[1:57:30] home. And as we walked into the
[1:57:33] sanctuary here, Lord, we saw a sister
[1:57:36] from another place sitting here with the
[1:57:39] lights off. And I turned the lights on
[1:57:41] so we could see our way through. And we
[1:57:44] saw the sister sitting here crying.
[1:57:47] So Carol, I said, "Should we go maybe go
[1:57:50] speak to her?" So we walked over to
[1:57:54] where she was and I said, "Sister,
[1:57:56] can we help you? you you got you got
[1:57:58] something going on.
[1:58:01] Hallelujah.
[1:58:03] She said, "Brother Donnie,
[1:58:05] I was just sitting here praying
[1:58:08] that the Lord would send you my way."
[1:58:12] Oh Jesus,
[1:58:14] I believe that you're just as mindful
[1:58:17] right now. Father,
[1:58:20] these people don't need me, though.
[1:58:21] Lord, they need you. I can't heal them.
[1:58:25] I can't help them. I'd do anything I
[1:58:27] could. You know I would. I'd talk to
[1:58:28] them. I'd pray for them. But Lord, their
[1:58:30] battles are greater than me. They're
[1:58:32] greater than any preacher.
[1:58:35] Bring healing.
[1:58:37] Bring joy. Bring peace. Father,
[1:58:41] some need the Holy Ghost. May they be
[1:58:43] filled right now
[1:58:45] in your presence, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:50] We worship you, Lord.
[1:58:53] as we sing the song, I need you, Lord.
[1:58:57] I need you, Lord, right now.
[1:59:01] Some can't wait till Wednesday night.
[1:59:04] Maybe they cannot wait for this touch
[1:59:06] that they need from you. They need it
[1:59:08] today. Lord,
[1:59:10] I pray for our brother Steve Newsome.
[1:59:12] Jesus,
[1:59:14] may your healing virtue go to our
[1:59:16] brother today, Lord. Dear God, you know
[1:59:19] the burdens on my heart for different
[1:59:21] ones that are sick and afflicted in the
[1:59:24] name of Jesus. Oh Lord, they're fighting
[1:59:27] for their very life.
[1:59:29] May the healing hand of God go toward
[1:59:32] them, Lord.
[1:59:34] Jesus, we need you right now, Father.
[1:59:38] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:59:41] Let us raise our hands, can we? In the
[1:59:43] presence of the Lord.
[1:59:46] Now, I want you to just think about what
[1:59:49] you need. You prayed for that brother,
[1:59:51] that sister. Thank you for doing that.
[1:59:55] You might not understand it, but God God
[1:59:58] feels for us when we do that. As a
[2:00:01] matter of fact, there's several
[2:00:02] discernments where brother Brandham
[2:00:04] would speak to an individual and the
[2:00:07] person wouldn't get getting it and a
[2:00:10] person standing by them would peck them
[2:00:12] on the shoulder or speak to him and he'd
[2:00:14] make brother Ben say something about it.
[2:00:16] God bless you sister for doing that. God
[2:00:20] bless you. And because you did that,
[2:00:22] you've got this and this and this and
[2:00:26] this.
[2:00:27] Now you imagine because they cared for
[2:00:29] that other individual and the spirit of
[2:00:32] God gave the prophet a word from them.
[2:00:37] Well, now you've prayed for those by
[2:00:39] you. What word do you need? Oh, brother
[2:00:42] Donna, do you have a word for me? I do.
[2:00:46] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[2:00:48] you, ask what you will. Delight thyself
[2:00:51] also in the Lord, and he will give thee
[2:00:53] the desires of thine heart. In that day,
[2:00:58] I am the Father and the Father in me. I
[2:01:00] in you and you and me.
[2:01:04] Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] Hallelujah.
[2:01:08] Let's sing together just a little bit
[2:01:09] before we go, can we? You love him with
[2:01:12] all your hearts.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want to please him? We
[2:01:16] don't want to just please him with our
[2:01:18] dress. We don't want to just please him
[2:01:20] with not cursing and all that sort of
[2:01:22] thing, but we want to please him in the
[2:01:25] building stones in our life.
[2:01:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord,
[2:01:38] right now.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we need you, Lord.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; I need you, Jesus.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need healing. I I need to live
[2:01:54] with you.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; I need to let go of this resentment,
[2:01:57] this attitude that I have. Lord, I need
[2:01:59] you.
[2:02:04] Lift our hands
[2:02:10] and worship.
[2:02:17] Oh, we
[2:02:22] need you.
[2:02:27] I make it personal. I need you.
[2:02:38] I need you.
[2:02:44] I need
[2:02:46] you.
[2:02:48] I need you.
[2:02:52] I need you. I need you, Jesus.
[2:03:01] Thank you Jesus.
[2:03:05] My handship.
[2:03:16] Oh, I need you Lord.
[2:03:21] I need you Lord
[2:03:25] right now.
[2:03:31] Oh, we need you, Lord.
[2:03:36] We need you, Lord,
[2:03:41] right now.
[2:03:44] It's a trying time.
[2:03:47] We need you, Lord.
[2:03:51] We need
[2:03:53] it Lord
[2:03:56] right now.
[2:04:04] We lift our hand
[2:04:10] and worship
[2:04:12] at
[2:04:14] your throne.
[2:04:16] Oh, we need you, Lord.
[2:04:21] We need you, Lord,
[2:04:25] right now.
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:31] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[2:04:37] I need you, Lord,
[2:04:41] right now.
[2:04:46] Oh,
[2:04:48] I need you, Lord.
[2:04:51] I need
[2:04:53] you, Lord.
[2:04:56] I need you right now.
[2:04:59] I need
[2:05:01] you, Lord. I lift my hands.
[2:05:06] I will bow
[2:05:08] my knees and worship
[2:05:12] at your throne.
[2:05:16] Oh, I need you, Lord.
[2:05:21] I need you, Lord,
[2:05:25] right now,
[2:05:29] [Music]

[2:06:32] Let's sing together one more before we
[2:06:33] go, can we? Can you say it's been good
[2:06:35] to be in the house of the Lord today?
[2:06:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:41] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Won't you turn
[2:06:43] around and shake hands with somebody?
[2:06:45] God bless you, brother, sister. Good to
[2:06:46] see you today in the house of the Lord.
[2:06:50] Amen. God bless you, saints. Love you so
[2:06:53] much.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this song here.
[2:06:59] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And all my days,
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; all my
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; I've been held in your hands.
[2:07:12] From the moment that I wake up
[2:07:17] until I lay my head.
[2:07:21] Oh, I will sing
[2:07:23] of the goodness
[2:07:26] of God.

[2:08:27] and I have live
