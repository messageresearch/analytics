[15:21] feel the prayers of the saints all over
[15:25] me. And y'all don't know what it meant
[15:28] to me. It meant everything to me. And I

[15:55] mercy. How gracious you are to each and
[15:58] every one of us. Lord, you're with us
[16:02] when we don't deserve it. You guide us
[16:05] when we don't deserve your leadership.
[16:08] We praise you today, dear Father, from
[16:11] the bottom of our hearts for all that
[16:13] you do for each and every one of us. And
[16:16] we bring before you this morning all
[16:18] these needs of these people, which are
[16:21] many. And Lord, we know that you know
[16:25] each and every one of them. And we know
[16:26] that you're aware of each and every one
[16:28] of them. And Lord, if they didn't want
[16:31] them answered, they would have never
[16:33] wrote them in. So I pray today, dear
[16:36] father, from the bottom of my heart
[16:39] that you go to each and everyone
[16:42] individually and answer these prayers
[16:45] and touch them and let them know that

[17:06] for it. How we thank you for it. And we
[17:09] believe everything that you tell us,
[17:12] Lord Jesus, in your word. For your word
[17:15] is true.
[17:16] And we know that that word will keep us,
[17:19] Lord Jesus, if we'll only believe. And
[17:23] we thank you for faith today, dear
[17:25] Father. We thank you for that faith that
[17:28] you've placed with inside of our hearts,
[17:31] inside of our souls to believe that
[17:34] word. So many people don't understand.
[17:38] So many people don't have that faith.
[17:41] But I thank you for the faith that
[17:43] you've given to each and every one of us
[17:45] this morning. Lord Jesus, we just bring

[36:17] [Applause]
[36:19] victorious warrior
[36:21] and lord of everything.
[36:26] I run my shelter.
[36:30] I
[36:33] redeemer blessed redeemer
[36:36] who reign
[36:47] more faithful
[36:49] and true. Lord Jesus.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[37:05] [Applause]
[37:05] [Music]
[37:15] for you.
[37:21] I find myself here.
[37:33] Heat. Heat.
[37:44] Yeah.
[37:46] Heat.
[37:56] Yeah. Heat.
[38:15] There is a fountain.
[38:19] There is a king
[38:22] victorious warrior
[38:25] and lord of everything.
[38:30] I myself he's the
[38:34] carame.
[38:51] [Applause]
[39:13] I cannot imagine when the
[39:16] millions
[39:18] of voices of the children of God gather
[39:22] in that great today
[39:25] and they begin to sing and worship and
[39:27] praise
[39:29] and the angels of God will just have to
[39:32] bow their heads and back out are the
[39:36] children of the most high begin to sing
[39:40] songs that only they
[39:42] can understand.
[39:44] as we looked at it here Wednesday night,
[39:46] that God
[39:48] actually is using the angels
[39:52] to as they would minister to the saints
[39:56] of God and those that are heirs of
[39:58] righteousness. And yet God is using the
[40:02] church to put on a theater.
[40:08] theater.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Paul uses the word spectacle
[40:13] that we are a spectacle to men, to the
[40:18] world, and to angels. And the word
[40:21] spectacle
[40:22] is a theater.
[40:25] So God by his grace and mercy is working
[40:27] through our lives and people around the
[40:29] world. And the angels are watching the
[40:33] theater as God does it.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Wow. because they simply don't
[40:37] understand it. God kept the mystery of
[40:40] redemption from the angels.
[40:44] So much of what is going on and has been
[40:46] going on through the church ages,
[40:48] they're having to watch the people of
[40:50] God
[40:52] and catch it as it's going on. I've
[40:54] often wondered what it must have been
[40:56] like in March of 1963
[41:00] whenever the lamb is taking the book and
[41:03] opening the seals. Now remember, brother
[41:05] Brandham was not the lamb, but it was
[41:06] the lamb doing it. And the angels for
[41:10] their first time were hearing things
[41:13] they had wondered about and pondered
[41:15] about for thousands and thousands of
[41:19] years. Isn't that awesome?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's such an honor for us
[41:25] to be gathered together today. Let's
[41:27] turn if you would to second Peter
[41:30] chapter 1 verse two. Hope you're not
[41:32] getting tired of reading these same
[41:35] verses of scripture. No.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[41:41] through the knowledge of God and of
[41:44] Jesus our Lord. I love this verse here
[41:48] as according as his divine power hath
[41:51] given unto us all things that pertain
[41:55] unto life and godliness. and not the
[41:59] world, not sinful pleasure, not things
[42:02] like that, but all things that pertain
[42:04] unto life and godliness,
[42:08] through the knowledge of him that hath
[42:10] called us to glory and virtue, whereby
[42:13] given unto us exceeding great and
[42:16] precious promises,
[42:19] that by these you might be partakers of
[42:22] the divine nature. You see, that's where
[42:24] angels miss it. They cannot partake
[42:28] of the divine nature the way you do.
[42:31] Having escaped the corruption that is in
[42:33] the world through lust. And beside this
[42:37] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[42:39] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[42:42] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[42:45] patience, and to patience godliness,
[42:49] and to godliness
[42:51] brotherly kindness.
[42:54] Wonder why that's the last one.
[42:56] Brotherly kindness.
[42:59] Brotherly kindness is the last one
[43:02] before the capstone.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; And to brotherly kindness, charity. I
[43:08] may let them be remembered today as we
[43:10] pray. Me as well.
[43:14] Lord Jesus, we so thank you, Father,
[43:19] that we're able to assemble ourselves
[43:21] together.
[43:24] Lord, as I was over here this week doing
[43:26] some work around the place and
[43:28] standing up there at the playground and
[43:30] just looking down toward our our
[43:34] facility that you've given us and
[43:37] Lord, tears running down my face and
[43:40] just so thankful in my heart that you've
[43:43] let us have a place that we can assemble
[43:47] together and Lord, not only for us but
[43:50] for others have special meetings and
[43:53] different things that we can do to
[43:55] invite friends and brothers and sisters
[43:57] to come and partake with us. We're just
[44:00] so grateful for all that you mean to us.
[44:02] Lord, we pray today, Lord God, that you
[44:06] would help us as we're looking at the
[44:09] building blocks of the tabernacle of
[44:12] God, that which is being worked upon now
[44:16] for a couple of thousand years and the
[44:20] Gentile dispensation.
[44:23] And we know with any building that is
[44:26] being built that there can be visible
[44:30] parts that are done that show such great
[44:34] change.
[44:35] And yet we also know those of us that
[44:37] have built homes and things like that
[44:39] and we've seen construction and once the
[44:42] framing goes up it just seems like it
[44:44] can fly and make such changes. Then the
[44:47] roof. Yes. What great changes. Then when
[44:51] it goes to the inside,
[44:53] the wiring,
[44:55] the insulation,
[44:57] different things, the plumbing, it's in
[44:59] the walls, and you go in and look at it
[45:00] and think, "What have they even done
[45:03] today? What have them sorry guys been
[45:06] doing? They ain't hardly done nothing."
[45:09] I wonder, Lord, if it's not that way
[45:11] with us sometimes in our spiritual
[45:13] building, there's fast parts. There's
[45:16] parts that you do in our lives and it's
[45:18] so noticeable. Yeah. There's other parts
[45:22] that you're doing that no one may not
[45:24] even know anything about it but us.
[45:28] But we know those things are essential.
[45:31] Help us today, Father, as we look into
[45:33] your word in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[45:36] Amen. God bless you, saints. You may be
[45:38] seated.
[45:40] Aren't you glad he's still working on
[45:42] you?
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:43] Boy, am I glad he didn't give up on me.
[45:47] A long time ago, I'm sure that for each
[45:50] of us, we've not only experienced the
[45:53] grace of God when we were first saved,
[45:55] but we've experienced it many, many
[45:57] times since we got saved because God
[46:00] knows we need it every day of our life.
[46:03] So, godliness means
[46:06] to be like God. But in what way? How can
[46:11] mere mortals which are uh imperfect,
[46:15] flawed and have all kinds of faults and
[46:18] shortcomings even to the even after they
[46:20] become born again. How can they be like
[46:24] God? How could they ever be even
[46:27] expected or for he himself to require
[46:31] them to be like him to be godly or to
[46:36] have godliness
[46:38] in their lives? And yet we know he's not
[46:41] asking us to do anything that is not
[46:44] attainable by his power being inside of
[46:47] us. He's not that kind of a God that
[46:49] would ever require such things that he
[46:51] knew that we could never do. But he also
[46:55] knows that by being partakers of the
[46:57] divine nature, that within itself, just
[47:00] as your mother and father and your
[47:02] family, and some of you probably can
[47:04] look at certain features in your hands,
[47:07] your face, your ears, your nose,
[47:09] whatever it is, and you look just like
[47:11] your daddy, just like your mama, whether
[47:13] you like it or not, it's just the way
[47:14] that it is. And you didn't ask to be
[47:17] that way. You didn't actually choose to
[47:19] be that way, but it was given to you
[47:22] through the mixing of the 23 chromosomes
[47:24] from your mother, the 23 from your
[47:26] father, and then the embedded DNA that
[47:29] is there. It just automatically comes
[47:31] out. Well, we know then by being
[47:34] partakers of the divine nature that
[47:36] there's some things and they'll show up
[47:39] immediately whenever we are born again.
[47:41] Other things, boy, it can take years
[47:45] before we really start seeing them
[47:47] manifested in our life. But that's the
[47:50] greater work because every day we are
[47:53] displaying the mercy and the grace of
[47:55] God as he's working in our lives. And
[47:58] even whenever we think oursel, I'm at a
[48:01] standstill. Anybody ever get there in
[48:03] your walk with God to where you just
[48:05] feel like, you know what, boy? I mean, I
[48:07] was really growing and I was doing this
[48:09] or that, but it's very similar to
[48:12] construction. Once we got the walls up
[48:14] on this place here, the people that
[48:15] passed by, they didn't have a clue, you
[48:18] know, what we were doing on the inside,
[48:20] but there was so much to be done on the
[48:22] inside. Same way with your house, if you
[48:24] ever built one. Same way with the house
[48:26] of God. For many of you, you've already
[48:29] straightened up on the outside. People
[48:31] can look at you, see your hair, clothes
[48:33] you wear, things that you do. And some
[48:36] of you may not look one bit different
[48:38] right now than you look 20 years ago or
[48:41] 25 years ago, except maybe a little bit
[48:43] fatter and a little bit uglier. Other
[48:45] than that, you know, you look the same.
[48:47] As you as you increase in size, your
[48:49] dress sizes get bigger. Excuse me. There
[48:53] and you know those things on the
[48:54] outside. But what about the inside? What
[48:58] about the inside? And you see that's the
[49:00] part that can become so difficult.
[49:02] Jeremiah said that the human heart when
[49:04] he talked about the heart how corrupt
[49:06] and how who who who can even know it. He
[49:09] said the human heart and the human heart
[49:12] can have things that are so embedded so
[49:14] deep in it that even your closest
[49:16] friends. Have you ever been shocked and
[49:19] surprised by people that you thought you
[49:22] knew and you thought you knew them so
[49:24] well? Oh my goodness. And you heard this
[49:26] or that or the other name. No, no way.
[49:29] No way they would ever be like that.
[49:31] Come to find out they were. Why? Because
[49:33] it was embedded so deep inside of them.
[49:38] And the heart is a very treacherous,
[49:41] dangerous thing. Only God can change
[49:44] that. You can change your appearance
[49:46] yourself on the outside, but only God
[49:50] could go into the heart. Now, this is
[49:51] some of the spiritual building blocks
[49:54] that God is building and making his
[49:56] people into. And when I look at this one
[49:58] of godliness, Carol, I was talking about
[50:00] the other day and I told her that I I
[50:02] don't mind telling you that I've been
[50:03] the most surprised by this one of all of
[50:07] them that we've looked at so far as far
[50:10] as the things that the Lord has opened
[50:13] in his word and allowed us to be able to
[50:15] look into and see to to help us to be
[50:18] like him. And today we'd like to look at
[50:21] another one of those if God will help us
[50:23] in an attribute of godliness. Now I
[50:26] realize it's probably going to shock you
[50:28] whenever I mention it to you, but what
[50:30] we want to look at today is going to
[50:34] church.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[50:37] amen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Wow. Who would have ever thought going
[50:43] to church would make you godly?
[50:49] Shall we read Luke 4 verse 16?
[50:54] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[50:56] been brought up.
[51:01] And as his custom was,
[51:06] you mean to tell me Jesus went to
[51:10] church?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't even an apostolic church.
[51:17] Mhm.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a Methodist church. It was a
[51:22] synagogue.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; And you all know how they worshiped in
[51:26] the synagogue services. Well, I read
[51:29] through them again yesterday to look at
[51:31] it historically.
[51:33] It sounded pretty boring to me.
[51:37] So, they read part of Leviticus. They
[51:39] read part of Deuteronomy. They go
[51:40] through a bunch of things and it was the
[51:42] same thing over and over and over again.
[51:48] The same words. They would read the same
[51:51] words, the same portion of scriptures.
[51:53] And then of course they would have
[51:54] songs. It was the same thing over and
[51:57] over and over again. And yet Jesus went
[52:02] to church.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Now look at this. And he came to
[52:06] Nazareth where he had been brought up.
[52:09] And as his custom was, well, I'll tell
[52:13] you one thing. If Jesus custom was to go
[52:16] to church, it's mine, too.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I realize that there's people who
[52:22] would love to be able to go to church,
[52:24] but they can't do it because they're
[52:26] physically unable or there's not a
[52:29] church to where they can go. And those
[52:32] of you, and I hear from them every time
[52:33] that I that I deal with this, those that
[52:35] stream the service, "Oh, brother Donnie,
[52:37] what are we going to do? We ain't got a
[52:38] church to go. Now remember, this is
[52:41] people for for people who feel like they
[52:44] do not need to go to church or simply
[52:46] don't believe in it. But it's also for
[52:50] us who are regular churchgoers
[52:53] so that hopefully we will be able to see
[52:57] even greater why we go to church and
[53:00] what we should do when we get to church.
[53:03] So just going to church and showing up
[53:06] and being there is not all the Lord
[53:08] wants us to do. So now think of it going
[53:12] to a synagogue. Now remember there's
[53:14] only one temple but in lots of different
[53:17] outlying s places in Jerusale around
[53:19] side of Jerusalem in the land of Israel
[53:22] they would have a synagogue. Even today
[53:24] there is no temple but anywhere you find
[53:27] a Jewish community a very large one
[53:30] you're going to find a synagogue. So, a
[53:32] synagogue, they would have a certain
[53:34] portion of that. They would read the
[53:36] Torah, they would sing, they would do
[53:38] these different things. And then they'd
[53:40] also have like a fellowship hall, a
[53:41] fellowship building. Those of you that's
[53:44] been around, you've seen what they're
[53:45] made like. And this is sort of what it
[53:47] was. So, it was sort of a a common type
[53:50] of a place. Carol and I stood a few
[53:52] years ago and stood right on the very
[53:55] rocks of the synagogue that the Lord
[53:58] Jesus would have went into whenever this
[54:01] scripture would have been fulfilled. So
[54:03] it was like a community type of building
[54:06] but only for the Jews. So they would use
[54:09] it as a multi-purpose type place. They
[54:12] did not offer sacrifices. Remember, they
[54:15] read the law, they discussed the law,
[54:17] and whenever a boy came into his bar
[54:19] mitzvah, he was 12 years old. It was the
[54:22] first time that he was able to stand
[54:24] publicly. Remember, public worship has
[54:28] always been a great thing to God. So,
[54:32] their bar mitzvah was not in private.
[54:34] Their bar mitzvah was not away from
[54:37] everybody else, but it was in public. It
[54:40] was a public celebration. So the boy 12
[54:43] years old, he comes before them and the
[54:45] priest hands him the scroll and he would
[54:48] turn there and read. Now according to
[54:50] them at 12 years old, he became a man.
[54:54] He was a man in the sense of that he
[54:56] could be able to read the Torah and be
[54:59] able to start commenting on what it was
[55:02] and what it meant. So here the Lord
[55:05] Jesus would have actually went to the
[55:08] synagogue at the age of 12 years old
[55:11] whenever he had have been allowed to
[55:12] read the Torah. But he didn't start
[55:14] going to church when he was 12. As a
[55:17] matter of fact, he went at the day of
[55:19] his dedication. You remember that? But
[55:22] his mother and stepfather would have
[55:25] taken him over and over and over again
[55:29] to church. So God went to church.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Now to be like God,
[55:38] guess what?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; You and I need to go to church.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Wow. My now you think this is an
[55:47] attribute of godliness that an element
[55:51] of message people will never attain to
[55:55] because they see no need whatsoever
[55:58] to go to church. They just don't do it.
[56:01] And they say, "Well, you know, you can't
[56:03] get very much truth there." Now, I want
[56:05] you to think 2,000 years ago and the
[56:09] setting, the scenario that would have
[56:11] been there. It was the same thing at
[56:13] every service over and over again, you
[56:15] knew exactly what scriptures they was
[56:17] going to read. You knew exactly some of
[56:19] the same things that the priest was
[56:21] going to say. So, there would have been
[56:23] hardly no spirituality in those services
[56:28] at all.
[56:29] There would have been no life, no
[56:33] spiritual life, no revelation.
[56:36] There would have been no preaching, no
[56:40] anointed men of God saying, "I feel led
[56:43] to go this way. The Lord changed my
[56:45] subject. I feel led." No, there was none
[56:48] of that at all.
[56:51] And Jesus went every time the doors was
[56:53] open.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Now, think of how little truth that they
[56:57] had. You imagine they never seen a
[57:00] miracle their entire life. Jesus as a
[57:04] young boy going to church never saw a
[57:08] miracle.
[57:10] Jesus going to church never heard a Holy
[57:15] Ghostfilled anointed preacher stand up
[57:18] and preach the word.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; But it was men that were trained cold
[57:24] formal theological
[57:27] And Jesus went to church every time the
[57:30] doors is open.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You got to be kidding me. To that kind
[57:35] of a church.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus made it regular part of
[57:41] his life.
[57:43] [Laughter]
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Now you know people use excuse. Well, I
[57:47] I don't always agree with everything
[57:49] that's preached.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; So you think he did?
[57:54] Now, if that would excuse you from going
[57:57] to church, then it should have excused
[57:59] the Lord Jesus. And after you got to be
[58:01] a young man, you can say, "You know
[58:02] what, mama? I don't want to go back no
[58:04] more. I mean, I know everything they're
[58:07] going to say before they say it. I I
[58:10] know what they're going to read. I know
[58:11] what they're going to do. We've been
[58:13] doing this for all of these years, and I
[58:15] really have no desire to go." Oh, but
[58:17] you see, God goes to church.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was no life, no new births,
[58:26] nobody received the Holy Ghost, nobody
[58:29] got healed, no deliverances, no
[58:32] miracles. And Jesus kept right on going
[58:35] to church.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Why? God.
[58:41] So Jesus was actually known, and I love
[58:44] the way that Luke catches this. He's the
[58:45] only one of the four writers of the four
[58:48] gospels. And he actually places Jesus an
[58:52] element about Jesus human life. And I
[58:54] absolutely love it because he places
[58:57] Jesus in the scripture as being habitual
[59:02] when it come to going to church and
[59:06] being a worshshiper.
[59:08] So Jesus didn't just attend church, but
[59:13] Jesus was a worshipper in church. Now,
[59:16] he might have been one of the very few
[59:18] that actually did, you know, the rest of
[59:20] them, yes, praise Yahweh, hallelujah,
[59:22] Adonai, this, that, and the other. But
[59:24] can you imagine the Lord Jesus going to
[59:26] church? He worshiped. He praised.
[59:29] Hallelujah. Oh my. I mean, I kind of
[59:32] figured y'all would look at me strange,
[59:34] but I didn't think he'd look at me this
[59:36] strange this long. So, I'm hoping it'll
[59:38] pass, you know, here momentarily. So
[59:40] Jesus was an habitual church attender
[59:44] and he was also an habitual worshipper
[59:48] that every time he went to the house of
[59:50] God. Now what what a an absolute rebuke
[59:54] for those who in Christianity who say
[59:58] well I know what they're going to do.
[59:59] They're going to start at 10:00 or like
[1:00:01] us 11:00. Brother Lou is going to get up
[1:00:03] there and he's going to mess up saying
[1:00:05] this and you know the song leader is
[1:00:07] going to do this and whoever's going to
[1:00:08] sing that. Somebody's going to mess up
[1:00:10] on the sound system cuz they always do.
[1:00:12] Whoever turns up that air conditioner,
[1:00:14] they're absolutely freezing me to death.
[1:00:17] And somebody else on the other side of
[1:00:18] the church going through the change of
[1:00:20] life and they got 47 fans while they're
[1:00:22] sitting there flying. I know what
[1:00:23] brother Donny's good. He's going to read
[1:00:25] quotes. He's going to do this. You'd
[1:00:27] have had a hard time going to Jesus
[1:00:29] church.
[1:00:31] [Applause]
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; So you see, it's not just the church and
[1:00:35] it's not just what everybody else is
[1:00:38] doing. The question is, what are you
[1:00:41] doing?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; When you come to church,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; you see, it's not about it being worked
[1:00:46] around the way you like church. It's not
[1:00:49] the way you like church. It's not really
[1:00:51] even the way I like church. It's the way
[1:00:54] God wants it. That's what we want to do
[1:00:57] is to be able to please him. Now imagine
[1:01:00] the corruption
[1:01:02] and the rottness of doctrine
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; that was during this first century. Now
[1:01:09] it wouldn't that be an excuse to stay
[1:01:11] home.
[1:01:14] There would have been hardly any purity
[1:01:17] of truth and doctrine that he would have
[1:01:20] heard had they commented on it. It's
[1:01:23] easy to see they didn't have an
[1:01:24] understanding because there he was right
[1:01:26] among them and they never did know who
[1:01:28] he was and they still don't many of
[1:01:30] them.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But wouldn't that be a reason to stay
[1:01:33] home?
[1:01:35] I said, "Well, they're blind.
[1:01:38] They don't know who I am. I ain't going
[1:01:40] up that bunch of blind bunch of people."
[1:01:43] Can't you see friends this attribute of
[1:01:45] God?
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; This attribute of God is so valuable and
[1:01:52] so important. And yet so many message
[1:01:55] people ridicule it.
[1:01:59] dishonoring the resurrection
[1:02:02] every week
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; and staying home and going shopping and
[1:02:06] listening to a tape and then go out and
[1:02:08] spend the rest of the day doing this and
[1:02:11] that and the other, whatever it is they
[1:02:12] do.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. Either we have this or
[1:02:18] we don't go in the rapture.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I don't understand people who don't go
[1:02:23] to church.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; They choose not to. I mean, and why they
[1:02:27] ever want to go to heaven?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz I mean, it's like church every day.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; So, if you can't go a couple of times a
[1:02:35] week, you'd never enjoy being to heaven.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; So, there would have been such
[1:02:41] corruption doctrinally.
[1:02:44] There would have been such blindness.
[1:02:47] You would have hardly heard any
[1:02:49] revelation at all unless Simeon
[1:02:53] would have come through every now and
[1:02:54] then.
[1:02:57] Now, if Simeon would have come there
[1:02:58] every now and then, he'd probably
[1:03:00] whenever they'd write read, you know,
[1:03:02] some of these scriptures of Isaiah 7:14
[1:03:04] and, you know, Isaiah 35:3 and Zechariah
[1:03:07] 6:12 and Deuteronomy 18:15, uh, Genesis
[1:03:12] 3:15-18.
[1:03:13] And if they read some of them, hit say,
[1:03:16] "Glory." Of course, the deacons about,
[1:03:18] calm down, oh man, you're interrupting
[1:03:20] the preach. Oh, glory to God. I'll tell
[1:03:23] you one thing. Hallelujah. I'm going to
[1:03:25] see that baby born. They'd probably say,
[1:03:27] "Poor old guy. He's just got dementia or
[1:03:29] something. You know, he don't know where
[1:03:31] he's at." But most part, the rest of
[1:03:33] them just sat there and sleep.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't wait till church was
[1:03:39] over so they could talk about how many
[1:03:41] sheep they had, how many goats they had,
[1:03:44] how many horses, how many she assasses
[1:03:46] and camels, and how much money they made
[1:03:49] that week.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, it's amazing because
[1:03:53] all it's done is changed from sheep now
[1:03:56] to palladium or gold or silver or chrome
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; or real estate. People haven't really
[1:04:04] changed that much, have they?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; So, there would have been such
[1:04:09] corruption and such rottness, but that
[1:04:12] had no effect whatsoever on the Lord
[1:04:16] Jesus going to church.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; You mean he went to church when there
[1:04:23] was nobody with revelation? Absolutely.
[1:04:26] He went to church when they was as blind
[1:04:29] as they could be. Absolutely. They done
[1:04:32] the same thing over and over again and
[1:04:35] he went back every time the doors is
[1:04:38] open.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; It was his custom.
[1:04:43] It was his custom. So, this is something
[1:04:46] that Where's Jesus at? Well, what time
[1:04:48] is it? It's on the Sabbath. I know
[1:04:50] exactly where he's at. He's in church.
[1:04:52] Well, wouldn't that be something to be
[1:04:54] said about us? My my. You see, there was
[1:04:58] nothing that would keep him away as far
[1:05:01] as what most people would use for
[1:05:03] excuses today from going to church. He
[1:05:06] went anyway to the house of God. Now I
[1:05:09] hope that you understand by bringing it
[1:05:12] this way that it is actually our duty as
[1:05:16] sons and daughters of God to attend
[1:05:18] church regularly.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Regularly and that much more. Paul says
[1:05:28] as we see the day approaching. Now
[1:05:30] notice that it is better. It would be
[1:05:34] actually better to go to a place where
[1:05:37] their doctrine is not 100% accurate and
[1:05:41] they might have a little bit of
[1:05:43] formality in their worship if they have
[1:05:45] any worship or they could be on the
[1:05:47] other side. They could be a little radic
[1:05:49] and they could be a little Pentecostal
[1:05:51] in their worship. But it would be better
[1:05:54] to do that and go and you give your all
[1:05:57] in that service than it would be to stay
[1:06:00] at home by yourself.
[1:06:03] You say, "How could you say that?" By
[1:06:05] the living word, the way he lived. How
[1:06:08] did he live? Did he find a perfect
[1:06:11] church? There were none. Come on,
[1:06:13] somebody. There were no perfect
[1:06:15] churches. There wasn't even none after
[1:06:17] the Holy Ghost come on the day of
[1:06:18] Pentecost. We can read the epistles of
[1:06:21] Paul and realize they all had their
[1:06:23] issues. And every message church in this
[1:06:26] day has its issues. Every message church
[1:06:30] has its problems. Every message
[1:06:33] individual has their problems. Whether
[1:06:36] Americans, whether they're Africans,
[1:06:38] whether they're Tennessans or Texans or
[1:06:41] wherever they're from, they have their
[1:06:43] issues. But to me, it is still my
[1:06:46] responsibility and my duty to go to the
[1:06:50] house of God and not just sit there like
[1:06:52] a bump on a pickle, but when I get
[1:06:55] there, I am going to worship. I'm going
[1:06:58] to sing. I'm going to clap my hands. I'm
[1:07:01] going to praise. That's who I am.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Now notice even though now people look
[1:07:08] at well there's no churches around
[1:07:11] nowhere where the doctrine I 100% agree
[1:07:14] with them. I'll tell you one thing. I'd
[1:07:16] be better off to stay away from them.
[1:07:18] You're not following the pattern that
[1:07:19] Jesus followed. As a matter of fact,
[1:07:22] someone was telling me not long ago of a
[1:07:24] man that attended our church years ago
[1:07:26] and and he he went to one church and
[1:07:29] another church and another church and
[1:07:30] finally just ah then none of them
[1:07:32] churches ain't none of them you know on
[1:07:33] the word but yet he was witnessing to
[1:07:36] someone about the message and he was
[1:07:39] witnessing to a businessman and he said
[1:07:42] yeah have you ever heard God son a
[1:07:43] prophet no and the guy was a little bit
[1:07:45] curious about it you know so he started
[1:07:47] talking talking to him about this uh you
[1:07:50] know about this message. My goodness, he
[1:07:52] said some I've never even heard it
[1:07:54] before in my life. So the farther they
[1:07:56] went along and talking and so this man
[1:07:58] asked him and said, "So where do you go
[1:07:59] to church at?" He said, "Oh, I I don't
[1:08:01] go to any church." Well, aren't there
[1:08:02] some churches around your Yeah, but I
[1:08:04] don't go to any of them because I I
[1:08:06] don't agree with any of them. You know
[1:08:07] what the man done that he's trying to
[1:08:09] convert? Said, "You know what, sir? You
[1:08:11] need to be in church somewhere. So
[1:08:13] you're trying to tell me you've got more
[1:08:15] light than I do and you don't even go to
[1:08:18] church. Now you're talking about a slap
[1:08:20] in that man's face of his testimony. And
[1:08:23] the sad part about it is that
[1:08:25] denominational man he was talking to was
[1:08:27] better off than that message man was.
[1:08:30] You know why? Cuz he's so arrogant, so
[1:08:33] puffed up and he's not doing what Jesus
[1:08:36] done. Now Jesus could have stood outside
[1:08:38] the doors at every service he went. He
[1:08:41] could have critiqued this and throwed
[1:08:42] off on that. Said that was a lie. That
[1:08:45] wasn't true. And Jesus could have made
[1:08:47] every service turned it into total
[1:08:50] chaos. But instead of doing that, Jesus
[1:08:52] kept on going back to church. You
[1:08:55] imagine as a little boy, the little boy
[1:08:57] Jesus would stand back go adonai, adoni,
[1:09:00] Elohim, Adonai. He would worship and he
[1:09:03] become a teenager and Jesus would pray
[1:09:06] and Jesus would worship and he'd stand
[1:09:08] there as he'd hold the Torah when he was
[1:09:10] 13 years old and his little locks around
[1:09:13] his head and he would stand there like
[1:09:15] that. Oh, Adonai. Adonai, Adoni. And
[1:09:18] they always knew Jesus was in church
[1:09:21] because you saw him and you could hear
[1:09:24] him. Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] I ain't much of a silent worshipper. I
[1:09:29] ain't much. Come on, somebody. I realize
[1:09:31] there's a time, but I'll tell you one
[1:09:33] thing. I I believe when we come to the
[1:09:35] house of God, if we ever express our
[1:09:38] feelings, our emotions, everything that
[1:09:41] we are, it should be toward the living
[1:09:44] God. People want silent prayer and
[1:09:47] silent specials and silent preachers.
[1:09:50] Where in the world do you get that at in
[1:09:52] God's word? Lift up your voices. The
[1:09:55] Bible says, "Lift up your hands. Clap
[1:09:57] your hands. All you people shout with
[1:10:00] the voice of triumph to the Lord. If
[1:10:04] you'd shout at a volleyball game or a
[1:10:06] baseball game or a basketball game and
[1:10:09] won't lift your voice to the Lord Jesus,
[1:10:12] I say shame on you. I said shame on you.
[1:10:16] Let it be our custom, hallelujah, that
[1:10:19] we not only go to the house of God, but
[1:10:22] we worship when we're there. We say amen
[1:10:25] to the word and when it cuts us we say
[1:10:28] Lord help us.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You imagine the doctrines were
[1:10:35] not pure and the service Jesus never
[1:10:39] attended a service that was perfect.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; But he went to church every time the
[1:10:49] doors is open. Yes.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Now wonder why
[1:10:54] he would do that. So then where are
[1:10:57] people who just refuse to go to church?
[1:11:00] I'm talking about message people who
[1:11:02] claim they're in a more revelated state
[1:11:04] of the light. Where do they get their
[1:11:07] example to stay home?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Well, it's not from Jesus
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; and it's not from the apostles.
[1:11:20] And it's not from our prophet.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; So could it be it's from this guy?
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Now he goes to church,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; but he don't go to worship God.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; The devil goes to church and demons go
[1:11:41] to church.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; But they don't go to worship God.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; They don't go to get anything out of the
[1:11:46] service. They go to pick. I don't like
[1:11:49] this. I don't like that. That wasn't the
[1:11:51] way I wanted it. That wasn't the way I
[1:11:53] wanted it. And then they come with that
[1:11:55] attitude and then they'll get on people
[1:11:57] that will let them get on them.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; I don't want them devils on me.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Have I ever been in a
[1:12:04] perfect service? Never in all my life.
[1:12:06] I've probably been in more than most of
[1:12:07] you all have. And I've sometimes, you
[1:12:10] know, you're going through, boy, I wish
[1:12:11] that was better. I wish that was better.
[1:12:13] I wish they hadn't said that. I wish I
[1:12:14] hadn't said that. But you know what you
[1:12:16] do? You keep on going back and saying,
[1:12:18] "Praise God, Lord. Maybe I'm the one
[1:12:20] that's out of tune. Maybe I'm the one
[1:12:22] that needs help." Come on, saints.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Now, do we want to be like God or not?
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Well, God,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; you see, it's always been of vast
[1:12:36] importance to God that worship was
[1:12:39] displayed in a public manner.
[1:12:44] Public manner.
[1:12:46] So, and it's also our responsibility
[1:12:50] to not only come to the house of God,
[1:12:53] but also assist and make sure that our
[1:12:57] children understand the value so that if
[1:13:00] all of us older people die and the next
[1:13:03] generation, they'll sell this building
[1:13:05] here and they say, "We don't go to
[1:13:06] church."
[1:13:08] That's up to you parents to instill the
[1:13:10] value and the importance in your
[1:13:13] children's life of going to church.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Question answer is 1964 a sister asked
[1:13:21] brother Brandham. She said that she
[1:13:22] believed the message and her son with
[1:13:25] her believed the message and received
[1:13:27] it. But her husband went to a
[1:13:29] denominational church and he started
[1:13:31] talking to their son. I'll just brief
[1:13:33] this part. You can read it if you like.
[1:13:34] And they started he started talking to
[1:13:36] her son and he pulled him away from
[1:13:39] following the message as well. And then
[1:13:41] the sister tells that her husband wants
[1:13:44] her to go to church with her with him
[1:13:46] rather. And she asked the question
[1:13:48] should she go to church with her
[1:13:51] husband. This isn't the answer. Go with
[1:13:53] your husband, but don't be partakers of
[1:13:56] what they're doing. See, you're supposed
[1:13:58] to love your husband, and love is what
[1:14:01] does it. You just be real salty and
[1:14:04] he'll get thirsty if there's anything in
[1:14:07] him. Don't join their denomination. You
[1:14:10] said stay away from that denomination,
[1:14:12] which is part of the sister's question.
[1:14:14] Don't join it. Go to it. If you can't
[1:14:18] get a whole loaf, get a half.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; If you can't get a half, get a slice.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Let me break it on down. If you can't
[1:14:28] get a slice, get a crumb. If you can't
[1:14:31] get a crumb, get a smell.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; If you want to go to church, you'll find
[1:14:38] something good to go for.
[1:14:41] Now,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; I know y'all think I'm nuts anyway. But
[1:14:43] I'm going to tell you one thing. If I
[1:14:44] lived in a community where there was
[1:14:46] nothing there but a Baptist church or a
[1:14:48] Methodist church or whatever it was, I
[1:14:50] would do my best to go at least every
[1:14:52] now and then just to let the devil know
[1:14:54] I still profess to be a Christian.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because there's something
[1:15:00] about public identification that you're
[1:15:03] not ashamed of your God. You're not
[1:15:06] ashamed of being recognized that you are
[1:15:09] a Christian. They might throw me out
[1:15:11] because I if I'm going I am going to
[1:15:13] worship. I'm going to worship. I'm going
[1:15:16] to praise. I ain't going to sit there.
[1:15:18] I'm going to bless the name of my God.
[1:15:20] He's done so much for me. I've got so
[1:15:24] much to thank him for.
[1:15:27] Now, I want you to notice how that
[1:15:28] brother Brennham takes this and he said,
[1:15:30] "But that's the way you win your
[1:15:32] husband." That by doing that, don't be
[1:15:36] arrogant.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Why would he throw that in now to a
[1:15:41] message believer?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Does that tend to go with message
[1:15:46] believers?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; In the way they look at others. That's
[1:15:50] right.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Don't be arrogant and he'll know he's
[1:15:56] got just as much as you have.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; So you mean a denominational believer
[1:16:02] would have just as much as a message
[1:16:04] believer if the message believer has an
[1:16:06] understanding of the message, but with
[1:16:08] it they got an arrogant spirit.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Talk to us Jesus.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Talk to us Jesus.
[1:16:16] But when you can show something that you
[1:16:19] have that he don't have, that'll make
[1:16:21] him thirst to be like you. Wow.
[1:16:24] Godliness.
[1:16:26] Don't you want so much of God in your
[1:16:28] life that other people will long to be
[1:16:31] like you? I'll never forget it. I don't
[1:16:33] think as long as I live. Let me scan the
[1:16:36] audience.
[1:16:37] Yeah. Okay. I'll see them. There was
[1:16:39] there was a several years ago at the
[1:16:41] other place. There was a man and his
[1:16:43] wife come up and they're here this
[1:16:44] morning. They come up and and and the
[1:16:47] the the sister says she hadn't made the
[1:16:49] full commitment yet to the Lord. Uh but
[1:16:52] I'd been watching the spirit of God deal
[1:16:53] with her for a while. And as she come up
[1:16:56] there,
[1:17:00] standing right by her husband,
[1:17:04] and she told me, "I want what he's got."
[1:17:10] Now, her mother and daddy's here today.
[1:17:11] They're godly people.
[1:17:14] Family members here today, godly people.
[1:17:17] I hope I was a godly pastor.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; But she didn't say she wanted what I
[1:17:22] had.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; She didn't say she wanted what her mama
[1:17:25] had, what her daddy had. Not
[1:17:27] discrediting that. But who was it that
[1:17:30] had made such an impact upon her life?
[1:17:33] Her husband.
[1:17:35] Brothers, that's the kind of husbands we
[1:17:37] want to be.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you amen say amen?
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of wives that you wives
[1:17:44] want to be. Now, here the prophet
[1:17:45] reversed around. It was a sister. So,
[1:17:48] the prophet is teaching this message
[1:17:50] woman how to be able to live the message
[1:17:54] every day in such a way that her
[1:17:56] Methodist I wasn't going to call it, but
[1:17:58] that's what he was. So that her
[1:18:00] Methodist husband would be able to
[1:18:03] hunger and thirst after what she had.
[1:18:06] Brother, sister, when the message of the
[1:18:08] hour does that in our lives, then let's
[1:18:11] share that. We want to share a bunch of
[1:18:13] theology and share this and that and the
[1:18:15] other. Let's wait till we get a good
[1:18:17] dose of the Holy Ghost before we go to
[1:18:19] try to telling people about Malachi 4.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. And trying to do go to
[1:18:26] service again. The prophet said, "People
[1:18:29] think that I don't even believe in
[1:18:32] people going to church.
[1:18:35] That's a million miles
[1:18:39] from the truth.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Not a half a mile, not a quarter of a
[1:18:44] mile, not two miles, a million miles. So
[1:18:47] those in the message who oh my who
[1:18:51] propagate this, who proclaim it, who
[1:18:53] like to set it forth, you are a million
[1:18:57] miles according to the very tapes that
[1:18:59] you listen to.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; From the truth.
[1:19:04] We
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; must
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; what?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I can show you where he said we must
[1:19:18] assemble ourselves together, but I
[1:19:20] cannot show you where he said
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; he said
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; we must play his tapes when we come to
[1:19:26] church. Come on.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, are we going to
[1:19:34] say what he said? No, we're not. A lot
[1:19:37] of us are not going to say it. We're
[1:19:39] going to say what we like that he said
[1:19:42] and what we don't like, we ain't going
[1:19:44] to say it.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. I don't know
[1:19:47] about you this morning. I want to say it
[1:19:49] whether I like it or whether I don't.
[1:19:51] There's things he said that burns me up.
[1:19:53] There's things he said that sets me on
[1:19:55] fire. But I say, "Amen." Lord, help me
[1:19:58] to move up. Help me to move up. Come on,
[1:20:00] somebody. Let's have church this
[1:20:01] morning. There's things that he said.
[1:20:03] Boy, I can. Amen. Hallelujah. But you
[1:20:06] can tell a lot of people ain't guilty of
[1:20:07] that cuz that amen comes out when it's
[1:20:09] really coming across to them. They sat
[1:20:11] there and that bottom lip pooches out
[1:20:12] like I don't know what. And you know
[1:20:14] they're guilty as a hound dog in the hen
[1:20:16] house. But a real saint of God can say,
[1:20:18] "Lord, help me. Help me. Lord, I want to
[1:20:20] move up." Come on, children. Why do we
[1:20:22] come to the house of God? The prophet
[1:20:24] said, "We come to church to find our
[1:20:27] faults. We come to church to hear our
[1:20:29] shortcomings." Why? So the gospel can
[1:20:32] come forth and straighten us out and get
[1:20:34] us ready to leave this world.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We must
[1:20:42] assemble ourselves together and that
[1:20:44] much more as we see the day approaching.
[1:20:47] See, we must
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; It is
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; come together in unity. If I lived in a
[1:20:54] city and they had nothing there, well,
[1:20:56] some church, I don't want to call any
[1:20:57] name, but any church, if they only
[1:20:59] believe one thing,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; that Jesus was divine and all the rest
[1:21:06] of it was wrong.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; I'd go to that church.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Why? He understood the importance of
[1:21:16] assembling yourselves together.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If I can't get a whole
[1:21:24] loaf of bread, I'll take a slice. I'll
[1:21:27] go listen and worship the Lord and show
[1:21:31] him. Oh.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean so those who don't go to
[1:21:36] church aren't showing him?
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; They're doing their part.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; To be like God. and he wants to be like
[1:21:53] God.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Remember, your hand will
[1:21:56] answer to you at the dead of judgment.
[1:21:58] Now, notice I want to show him that I'm
[1:22:01] doing my part. I want him to know that
[1:22:04] I'm alive. Well, can't he know that
[1:22:06] you're alive when you're staying home
[1:22:08] listening to a tape 12:00 Eastern time
[1:22:11] all around the world? Can't he know that
[1:22:13] you refuse? I know, friends, you look at
[1:22:15] me like I've got a ward on the side of
[1:22:17] my head, but you don't understand what's
[1:22:19] going on around this message around the
[1:22:20] world. This this movie is gaining
[1:22:23] momentum everywhere. People staying at
[1:22:25] home, people leaving churches, people
[1:22:27] falling out with one another. Best of
[1:22:29] friends that have been friends for years
[1:22:31] and years. And yet they're saying, "If
[1:22:33] you go hear a preacher preach, you ain't
[1:22:34] hearing the perfect voice of God. I will
[1:22:37] not go. I'm staying home." You're
[1:22:39] breaking what the very prophet of God
[1:22:42] taught.
[1:22:46] Excuse me.
[1:22:48] Now listen what he said about going to
[1:22:50] church publicly. actually what it does.
[1:22:53] I want him to know that I'm alive, but I
[1:22:56] want everybody to know what side I'm on.
[1:23:00] And how you going to do that, brother
[1:23:02] Brennham? By going to church.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I want everybody to know what side I'm
[1:23:10] on. I assemble with the Christians and
[1:23:14] their worship and serve the Lord.
[1:23:20] Oh,
[1:23:22] why? Why? What was the necessity of
[1:23:25] going to church? God
[1:23:28] loves to go to church.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; God loves to come together with his
[1:23:36] children
[1:23:38] and let them worship him.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Well, can't you worship him at home?
[1:23:43] Yes, I do. Every day of my life, I
[1:23:45] worship God every day of my life. Every
[1:23:49] night, every morning, noon time, I
[1:23:51] worship him. Every day of my life, I
[1:23:54] don't wait to come to church to worship
[1:23:56] him. My life is worship.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; My life is a worship and an offering
[1:24:03] unto my God. You understand? I hope you
[1:24:06] all do the same thing. You should look
[1:24:08] every moment that you have time. Well,
[1:24:10] what am I going to thank him for? What
[1:24:11] about life? What about breast? What
[1:24:14] about sanity? What about the clothes you
[1:24:16] got on your back? What about the
[1:24:17] breakfast that you ate, the water that
[1:24:19] you drink, the sunshine that he allows
[1:24:21] to come upon the oxygen that he gives
[1:24:23] you, a home church, a pastor that loves
[1:24:25] you, brothers and sisters, a
[1:24:26] resurrection and rapture, faith, hope,
[1:24:29] mercy, goodness, kindness, generally.
[1:24:30] You want me to go on? Have you got
[1:24:32] enough wrote down? You've got enough to
[1:24:34] praise him for. You should never stop
[1:24:36] praising him. But I'm going through so
[1:24:38] much stuff. And it'll be him that'll
[1:24:40] bring you through the stuff you're going
[1:24:42] through. He's the one who will give you
[1:24:44] victory. He's the one who's brought you
[1:24:47] safe thus far.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16:18, the very first
[1:24:56] time this word is used in the New
[1:24:58] Testament, and the founder of the church
[1:25:00] is the one who uses it. And I say unto
[1:25:03] thee that thou art Peter, and upon this
[1:25:05] rock I will build my church. Ecclesia,
[1:25:11] ecclesia,
[1:25:13] assembly, a gathering of citizens
[1:25:17] called out
[1:25:20] from their
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Called out from their homes into some
[1:25:35] That's what he said.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what the founder said.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It's not up for debate.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Called out from their homes into some
[1:25:45] public place, an assembly of the people
[1:25:48] convened again at the public place of
[1:25:51] the council for the purpose of
[1:25:54] deliberating.
[1:25:56] That's what I'm doing this morning,
[1:25:57] deliberating.
[1:26:03] Why? Why can't we do that at home? I
[1:26:05] guess so. I suppose if that's what Jesus
[1:26:07] wanted, he could have used another word.
[1:26:09] But this one is the one he used to
[1:26:12] describe his bride.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And it just so happens I believe I'm
[1:26:17] part of it. So, as long as I'm
[1:26:19] physically able and if I get too old to
[1:26:21] come anymore, y'all can't roll me in a
[1:26:22] wheelchair. And if I've got a stream, me
[1:26:24] and Carol will sit side by side and hold
[1:26:26] hands in the wheelchair and we'll shout
[1:26:28] in our wheelchair. May not be able to
[1:26:30] move from the half of the body up. But
[1:26:32] I'm going to do whatever I can. If I
[1:26:34] come to church and I'm 85 or 90 and I
[1:26:36] fall asleep, have a little pity on me
[1:26:38] and somebody gouge me on the side if I
[1:26:40] go to sleep. But please bring me to the
[1:26:43] house of God. If I get to where I was
[1:26:45] like John was, and they had to pack him
[1:26:48] to the house of God, but John said,
[1:26:50] "I've got to go to church. I've got to
[1:26:52] go to church now. have got to be in the
[1:26:54] presence of God. But it's not just the
[1:26:56] presence of God. It's the presence of
[1:26:58] God's children. People that you're going
[1:27:01] to spend eternity with. In this presence
[1:27:04] today is healing. In this house is
[1:27:07] deliverance. In this house, no matter
[1:27:09] what you need of, it is here today with
[1:27:13] the people of God.
[1:27:24] Hebrews chap 10 24.
[1:27:28] Now Paul was addressing this issue of
[1:27:31] going to church in his day. Now I want
[1:27:34] you to get the setting of it.
[1:27:37] He tells them in the next verse down
[1:27:39] here not to forsake the assembling of
[1:27:42] themselves together.
[1:27:44] So there was a temptation
[1:27:47] not to go to church
[1:27:50] in this time frame in the first first
[1:27:53] century.
[1:27:55] But you realize it wasn't Dollywood
[1:27:59] and it was why we got a picnic up on
[1:28:00] Rome Mountain and we'll skip church
[1:28:02] today. Come to church and then do your
[1:28:03] picnic at Rome Mountain.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:10] But the Romans was following to their
[1:28:13] churches
[1:28:16] and they would go in and raid the
[1:28:17] services
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; and take people out and cut their heads
[1:28:21] off.
[1:28:24] Pregnant women had their bellies ripped
[1:28:26] open and their babies jerked out of
[1:28:28] their belly and dashed their brains
[1:28:31] against rocks.
[1:28:34] They were being burned at the stake. So
[1:28:36] they would follow them to church
[1:28:39] to know whether they met. Was they going
[1:28:42] to the grocery store? Actually, if you
[1:28:44] laid out of church and went to the
[1:28:45] grocery store, they let you live.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; But you know who they got?
[1:28:52] Those that went to church.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; And they knew them first century
[1:28:56] Christians that was filled with the Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost went to church.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But this fear, this fear had
[1:29:03] got among them
[1:29:05] and part of them had got so afraid. Now
[1:29:08] brothers, think of it. You're the
[1:29:09] protectors of your home.
[1:29:12] How hard it would be, brother Joel. Yes,
[1:29:14] sir.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; For us to know if we pulled up to Word
[1:29:16] of Life Church and the police, state
[1:29:19] troopers,
[1:29:22] the militia, the military
[1:29:24] would be standing out there. All right.
[1:29:26] Get their name, get their ID, get their
[1:29:28] license plate. We'll be contacting you
[1:29:31] this week.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Why? What have I done wrong? You come to
[1:29:36] church.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Wonder if it have enough left to pay the
[1:29:41] electric bill.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Think of what these Christians were
[1:29:47] facing.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And yet in the face of that, Paul said,
[1:29:51] "Forsake not the assembling
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; of yourselves together." Yeah.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, my friends, the
[1:29:58] judgment of God that will await some of
[1:30:00] these message people? They're facing
[1:30:02] none of that.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; But they're under a lie of hell.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when them first century
[1:30:13] Christians walk up there as a testimony
[1:30:15] against the modernday Leodysian message
[1:30:18] people
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; that could drive to a house of God right
[1:30:22] down the road, right up the road,
[1:30:24] whatever. I don't want to go. I don't
[1:30:26] like that. I don't like that. They're
[1:30:28] not playing tapes. They're not doing
[1:30:30] this. God have mercy on your soul.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Now, notice how he addresses this in
[1:30:38] verse 24 before he says, "Forsake not as
[1:30:41] simming of yourselves together in 25."
[1:30:44] Let us consider
[1:30:48] one another. So, you see, fellowship
[1:30:51] with God should never wind up being
[1:30:54] selfishness on our part. Well, I'm going
[1:30:58] to church because I want this and I need
[1:31:00] that and I this and I that. Paul is
[1:31:03] wanting them to get it straight the
[1:31:05] reason they go to church.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Let us consider one another
[1:31:13] to provoke
[1:31:15] unto love
[1:31:18] and to good works. So you mean the
[1:31:20] leoty, the Christian believers can
[1:31:23] actually provoke one another to love and
[1:31:27] to good works?
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; So you come to church and you you see
[1:31:32] brother so and so ain't been there and
[1:31:33] his wife and their children have been
[1:31:35] there. You you well I'll pray for him.
[1:31:37] That's the deacon's responsibility. It
[1:31:38] might be your responsibility just as
[1:31:40] well to check on them and say, "Hey,
[1:31:42] y'all doing okay? We've been missing
[1:31:44] you. We want you to know we love you and
[1:31:47] we're here to do anything that we can to
[1:31:49] help you. Are y'all y'all okay? We love
[1:31:51] you. This is what your Bible says.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Provoke them to good works. Now, why you
[1:31:56] imagine the saints of God when they got
[1:31:58] this letter and they said, "Oh, I don't
[1:32:01] should we tell brother so and so and
[1:32:03] sister so and so, I know she's got a
[1:32:05] newborn and and that they're scared to
[1:32:07] come to church." They're afraid.
[1:32:09] Children, look how spoiled we are.
[1:32:15] If we wanted to, we could have church
[1:32:17] every night of the week.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You could come here daily and pray, you
[1:32:21] could do whatever you want. Oh my, how
[1:32:25] would we have acted in that age to where
[1:32:27] our very life and the preachers makes
[1:32:29] you wonder how many preachers we'd have
[1:32:31] today?
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real God ones.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; And they knew while they were standing
[1:32:37] up there that they could be taken
[1:32:39] straight to jail.
[1:32:47] Let us consider
[1:32:49] one another
[1:32:51] to provoke unto love and to good works.
[1:32:55] You see, we fellowship and we meet
[1:32:57] together not just for God and for us,
[1:33:00] but for one another.
[1:33:02] I find it amazing that the emphasis is
[1:33:05] not just put on what you get out of
[1:33:07] church. That's right.
[1:33:10] But it's on you helping others
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; and you ministering
[1:33:15] to others. You see faithfulness in
[1:33:17] church attendance,
[1:33:19] especially when you're down
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and when you're low,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; you lose a loved one and you don't want
[1:33:25] to come back to church for a while
[1:33:27] because you don't want people asking you
[1:33:29] how you doing and what's going on.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; And yet I've seen some of you come in
[1:33:34] here and sat down and I knew your heart
[1:33:36] was broken. And humanly you'd rather
[1:33:39] stayed away for a bit cuz you knew
[1:33:42] everybody's going to come. How you
[1:33:43] doing? How you doing?
[1:33:46] And you come home anyway. You know what
[1:33:48] that did to us?
[1:33:51] That so encouraged us.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; That so helped us that in your pain.
[1:33:56] Well, you could have stayed. Sure. You
[1:33:58] could have stayed and streamed the
[1:34:00] service and sat outside in your car
[1:34:02] until it come time for me to get up and
[1:34:04] preach and then you dart in the door and
[1:34:05] as soon as I pray, you're gone. cuz you
[1:34:07] don't want to you don't want to shake
[1:34:08] nobody's hand. What kind of
[1:34:09] yellowbellied coward is that? Come to
[1:34:12] the house of God. Get in there before
[1:34:14] the singing starts. Sit down,
[1:34:16] concentrate, meditate. Amen, brother
[1:34:19] Donnie. Preach. Read your Bible. Sit
[1:34:22] there. Sing with the saints. I don't
[1:34:24] want just the devil to know I'm
[1:34:25] identified with preaching. I want the
[1:34:27] devil to know I'm identified with the
[1:34:29] singing part of the service. I'm
[1:34:31] identified with the prayer request part
[1:34:33] of the service. Come on, somebody. There
[1:34:35] ain't going to be no preaching in
[1:34:37] heaven, but there's going to be a whole
[1:34:39] lot of singing going on if I'm going to
[1:34:41] be identified with the singing there.
[1:34:43] I'm going to sing here. I know I can't
[1:34:45] carry a tune in a large bucket, but I'm
[1:34:47] going to carry it as well as I can. I
[1:34:49] may battle out off keys sometime, but I
[1:34:51] want God to know what side I'm on. If
[1:34:54] the devil, oh my, can his people can do
[1:34:57] what they do? What about us as the
[1:34:59] children of God? Off key, on key, no
[1:35:02] key, middle key, we ought to sing. We
[1:35:05] ought to clap our hand. We ought to amen
[1:35:07] the preacher. We ought to come and bring
[1:35:10] our presence even when we don't feel
[1:35:12] like it. Why? It encourages others.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; You want to know one of the most
[1:35:23] discouraging things a pastor can deal
[1:35:26] with?
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; people not attending
[1:35:31] church.
[1:35:35] So for some of these sermons that I
[1:35:36] study for, ask my wife, she knows how
[1:35:39] much I study. Ask my family. They come
[1:35:41] up to eat with us and I'll say, "I got
[1:35:43] to go. I got to go study." I may look at
[1:35:46] a thousand quotes and scriptures for one
[1:35:50] Sunday morning service. Hours and hours
[1:35:53] and hours and hours and hours.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And people come in, run in and out,
[1:36:02] sleep. Some don't even show up.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you and let hell
[1:36:09] know it. If there ain't nobody here
[1:36:12] Wednesday night but me and Carol, I'm
[1:36:13] still preaching what God's put on my
[1:36:15] heart. I'm not letting my joy be
[1:36:18] affected by the devil, but it sure ain't
[1:36:20] going to work very good for you. You
[1:36:22] encourage me. You encourage every man of
[1:36:26] God that gets up there. It makes it
[1:36:28] worth the effort. Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:36:30] We are here not to live for ourself
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; but live for others.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You imagine brother Joel this
[1:36:42] must have been a hard verse to write.
[1:36:46] Now you there's no way you and I can
[1:36:48] understand the responsibility brother
[1:36:50] Harvey that Paul must have felt when he
[1:36:52] wrote this
[1:36:53] knowing that what if he writes this and
[1:36:57] somebody comes to church and they lose
[1:36:59] their life
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; that very night and he's the one who
[1:37:05] told them to come to the house of God.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; But Paul deemed it worth it.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; What a better way to go. Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Not forsaking
[1:37:20] the assembling of yourselves together,
[1:37:24] as the manner
[1:37:27] of some is.
[1:37:31] Now notice the word forsaking. Read it
[1:37:34] there. Leave,
[1:37:36] abandon,
[1:37:39] desert.
[1:37:42] Do you understand all these folks around
[1:37:43] the message that have quit going to
[1:37:44] church, they are deserters
[1:37:47] in the army of God?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; They have deserted
[1:37:58] their post of duty.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Imagine the brand tabernacle setting
[1:38:04] empty this morning
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; and has for years. Right.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; God have mercy. The prophet told us,
[1:38:16] remember, one day this tabernacle
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; will lose its strength.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And it has.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Is that going to be our pattern?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Are we going to follow that? Is that
[1:38:29] what we want? That's not what I believe
[1:38:32] the message was sent for. The message
[1:38:34] was sent to restore the hearts of the
[1:38:37] children back to the faith of the
[1:38:39] original apostolic fathers. But why do
[1:38:42] they do this or under deception of the
[1:38:44] devil? Come on, somebody. That's exactly
[1:38:47] right. And they don't believe that
[1:38:48] brother Brandham came to restore that
[1:38:49] word. No way. They believe this message
[1:38:52] is something totally new. Well, if you
[1:38:55] make Brother Brener bringing something
[1:38:56] totally new, then you are making him a
[1:39:00] false prophet. Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Only a false prophet brings new
[1:39:06] things that are contrary to the written
[1:39:09] word of God. And if brother Brandham
[1:39:11] would have preached things contrary to
[1:39:13] that Bible, I could not follow this
[1:39:15] message. I would not have gi my all. But
[1:39:18] I hear his message and I look in the
[1:39:21] Bible and I see it saying the same
[1:39:24] thing. So what am I going to do? I'm
[1:39:26] going to give all that I have to this
[1:39:29] word. I'm going to give all of my life
[1:39:32] to this word.
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Forsake, leave, abandon,
[1:39:49] desert,
[1:39:51] leave in straits, leave helpless.
[1:39:56] Yeah.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the people in that
[1:40:01] community in the Brandham Tabernacle
[1:40:04] when they passed by going to their
[1:40:06] church here or there and there and there
[1:40:07] it sits empty.
[1:40:09] Someone told me not long ago they up
[1:40:11] there and they actually went in to see
[1:40:13] it and it smelled moldy. You can go in
[1:40:16] all right and have silent prayer.
[1:40:20] Where's that at in the Bible?
[1:40:25] Do we want mold on our walls?
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Why is there mold on the walls? Cuz
[1:40:30] there's mold in their souls.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; They're not saying what God's prophet
[1:40:35] said. They're not saying what the Bible
[1:40:37] said.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you don't say. Don't just sit here
[1:40:41] and scream amen to it. And if you don't
[1:40:43] come to church the way you ought to come
[1:40:45] to church, you ain't doing it neither.
[1:40:48] Well, preach, Brother Donnie. I don't
[1:40:50] want to just say amen to it. I want to
[1:40:52] Amen. I'm going to let my feet do the
[1:40:55] amen and two. I'm going to get up and
[1:40:58] put my clothes on and come to the house
[1:41:00] of God and sing and pray and worship and
[1:41:04] magnify the name of our God.
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Desert, leave,
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; leave helpless.
[1:41:19] totally
[1:41:21] abandoned.
[1:41:25] So this is the word that Paul chose to
[1:41:27] use because some of the saints of God
[1:41:30] was fearing for their lives,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; not laziness
[1:41:36] and slothfulness.
[1:41:39] Their lives was at stake going to
[1:41:41] church.
[1:41:44] But Paul was saying, "Children, I know
[1:41:46] it's hard.
[1:41:48] I know it's scary for you, but you got
[1:41:51] to keep going to church.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Totally abandoned,
[1:42:04] utterly
[1:42:05] forsaken.
[1:42:08] God have mercy on those
[1:42:11] that are responsible for turning that
[1:42:13] tabernacle
[1:42:15] into a molded rundown building.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Where Jesus Christ
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; sent his anointing and his angels there
[1:42:25] to bring messages like the world had
[1:42:28] never heard before.
[1:42:31] healings, miracles, signs, wonders, the
[1:42:33] word of God, Christ Jesus himself, come
[1:42:36] there in that last week of March and
[1:42:38] tore those seals open and reveal those
[1:42:42] seals, things that have been hid since
[1:42:44] the foundation of the world.
[1:42:47] And now it sits there shut up.
[1:42:57] It is the duty of the saints of God to
[1:43:00] assemble
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; together for public worship.
[1:43:05] Who says Godmen?
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; He wants it done.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; As the manner of some is. So, here's
[1:43:15] some of those dear saints, brother Rob.
[1:43:19] So, here is Paul is identifying said
[1:43:21] some of them it's become habitual.
[1:43:24] They're just afraid to go to church
[1:43:25] anymore.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "Now look, children, you
[1:43:29] can't do that." Well, why don't they
[1:43:31] tell them, "Why don't we take a
[1:43:32] sabbatical? I'll tell you what, we'll
[1:43:34] shut the churches down for about 6
[1:43:36] months or a year or something like that.
[1:43:37] And once this persecution thing is over,
[1:43:40] once people are Christians or, you know,
[1:43:41] that they're going to give them a break,
[1:43:42] no doubt in time. And once this is all
[1:43:44] over, we'll all come back together. And
[1:43:46] how many will you have left?"
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] We've seen what the devil done to us in
[1:43:54] the COVID shutdown.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't talking about us just the message
[1:43:58] as a church. I'm talking about the
[1:43:59] message around the world. And yet one of
[1:44:01] the main leaders of it said CO was one
[1:44:03] of the greatest things that ever
[1:44:04] happened to the message. How in the
[1:44:06] world could anybody full of the Holy
[1:44:08] Ghost say such trash?
[1:44:10] Brother Donnie. Yes. Rubbish of the
[1:44:12] devil. When God's word tells us to come
[1:44:15] together and somebody said it's the
[1:44:16] greatest thing ever was cuz it'll force
[1:44:18] people to listen to more tapes. You need
[1:44:20] the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Say it, Lord.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You see, so in the times of persecution,
[1:44:33] the great temptation was, "Don't stop
[1:44:35] being a Christian. Don't stop living for
[1:44:37] God, but just don't go to church."
[1:44:45] And they entered into this dangerous
[1:44:48] neglect.
[1:44:53] So Paul tells them
[1:44:56] to exhort one another.
[1:45:00] Let's press play this morning, shall we?
[1:45:02] Except I'll read it to you. Here we go.
[1:45:06] The breach between the seven church ages
[1:45:09] and the seven seals. Page 116, paragraph
[1:45:11] 327. You love him. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:45:14] Oh, what would we do without this? Man
[1:45:16] shall not live by bread alone, but every
[1:45:18] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:45:19] God. Now remember where this is
[1:45:21] preached, breadtham tabernacle,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; the place that today is shut down.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, feed me Lord upon your word. Forsake
[1:45:32] not to assemble yourselves together as
[1:45:35] the manner of unbelievers.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Not people with a greater revelation.
[1:45:45] and believers.
[1:45:47] And it was said in the same building
[1:45:49] that's sitting empty this morning.
[1:45:53] God have mercy, children. What will the
[1:45:55] future hold if the Lord carries and goes
[1:45:57] on for a few years and I die and go by
[1:45:59] the way of all men and then it comes up?
[1:46:01] How many will we have that'll still
[1:46:03] attend Word of Life Church? Will you so
[1:46:06] instill it in your children? Children,
[1:46:08] we've got to go to church. It's
[1:46:10] imperative that we go. But daddy, the
[1:46:13] young people ain't kind to me. Then you
[1:46:15] think they was kind to Jesus. They
[1:46:17] treated Jesus bad. They run him down.
[1:46:20] But he said, "We're going to church
[1:46:22] today, mama. Get your clothes on. We're
[1:46:24] going to the house of God." Why? God
[1:46:27] goes to church.
[1:46:31] That's godliness.
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:46:44] The prophet said, "Many of these poor
[1:46:46] wandering, straying children stirring
[1:46:48] around through the world tonight
[1:46:51] without a church home."
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, that they'll see their
[1:46:56] error.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; And come to the house of the living God.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And word of Life Church said,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Help us now for we ask it in Jesus name.
[1:47:14] s of the Christ. And I said, "You get
[1:47:17] that bunch of lukewarm church members
[1:47:19] down there to the altar and let them
[1:47:20] pray through till the Holy Ghost sets
[1:47:23] their soul of fire. There's no signing
[1:47:26] cards." He was talking to a pastor now.
[1:47:28] So he had to get so many people to sign
[1:47:29] a card to at least show up twice a year,
[1:47:32] Christmas and Easter. This is Brother
[1:47:34] Brandham's response to him. You get that
[1:47:36] bunch of lukewarm church members down
[1:47:38] there to the altar and let them pray
[1:47:40] through. I think that's somewhat our
[1:47:41] message folks need. Till the Holy Ghost
[1:47:44] sets their soul on fire, there'll be no
[1:47:47] signing cards. God's in their heart. God
[1:47:50] goes to church.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; He loves to worship.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God
[1:48:01] loves to worship. He don't want us to
[1:48:04] come to church and suffer like we're
[1:48:05] half dead. He wants us to worship
[1:48:08] because God
[1:48:10] loves to go to church.
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; God
[1:48:23] to church. He loves
[1:48:28] to worship.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; So to be godly,
[1:48:33] we got to worship when we get there.
[1:48:37] preaching.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "How in the world can
[1:48:43] that be true? That God loves to worship.
[1:48:49] Who's he worshiping?"
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Who do you figure? Right.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Remember the old English vows which used
[1:49:00] to say and I' I've married a few people
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; still with them to this day. With thee
[1:49:05] my body I thee worship.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; With thee my body I the worship. And the
[1:49:14] Lord God loves to go to church because
[1:49:16] there he loves to pull his bride in his
[1:49:18] arms and he loves to anoint her with his
[1:49:21] presence. He loves to bring healing to
[1:49:22] her body. He loves Don't you understand?
[1:49:24] He with his body, oh glory God, he with
[1:49:28] his body went to the cross and gave his
[1:49:31] body and he could say it back to us with
[1:49:34] thee. Oh hallelujah, with my body, I
[1:49:37] give it to you. You know why you're
[1:49:38] sitting there dried up like that? You
[1:49:40] don't understand the meaning of worship.
[1:49:41] It means to adore. It means to bring one
[1:49:44] to an elevated level. The Lord Jesus
[1:49:47] don't want to just come to church with a
[1:49:49] bunch of cold dead church members, but
[1:49:51] he wants to have a relationship. He
[1:49:54] wants to have a love affair,
[1:49:58] a love affair with every one of his
[1:50:00] children. And he pulls you in his arms
[1:50:04] and makes love to you.
[1:50:08] [Applause]
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:50:17] We feel that every person is duty bound
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; to attend some church and belong to some
[1:50:26] church as a Christian.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Wow. Press play, obey.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Don't just press play and say nay.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Press play and obey.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You want to rhyme it
[1:50:43] out? I can make as many memes as you
[1:50:45] can.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; We feel that every person is duty bound.
[1:50:51] Does every person mean every person or
[1:50:54] not?
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:50:59] Many people say, "Oh, I stay home and
[1:51:02] read my Bible.
[1:51:05] I'm just as well off."
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; No. prophets.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible said we shouldn't forsake to
[1:51:11] assemble ourselves together.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; We got to do that.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; We've got to stand together.
[1:51:20] And the church said,
[1:51:23] [Applause]
[1:51:30] happened in a certain nation that I was
[1:51:32] in. Someone set up the meetings and we
[1:51:34] didn't have any cooperation and they
[1:51:36] just set up the meeting and thousands
[1:51:38] poured into that country and there was
[1:51:40] no church home.
[1:51:42] What difference does that make?
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Now this is 1957. It was the India trip
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; which was 1954.
[1:51:54] So they done had from 1948
[1:51:57] up to the early part of 1954 on tape.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they set up tape churches?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; God to church. Yeah,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I've been there at that little church in
[1:52:19] India
[1:52:22] and saw that marketplace of what they
[1:52:25] said tens of thousands of people
[1:52:27] gathered there and so many of them they
[1:52:29] couldn't even get them in. It shut down
[1:52:31] the police. It shut down the city. It
[1:52:33] shut down everything. You know what gets
[1:52:35] me is? If Brother Brandham were to be
[1:52:37] here today, them some same people that
[1:52:39] that keep on going with all their
[1:52:40] nonsense about not going to church,
[1:52:42] Brother Brandham would go to church. And
[1:52:44] you know what them sorry outfits would
[1:52:46] do? They'd get ready and get up and go
[1:52:48] to church.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be home pressed and play
[1:52:50] if the prophet of God was standing in
[1:52:52] the platform. It shows me the height of
[1:52:54] their hypocrisy.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Word of life. You
[1:52:58] should come to church whether your
[1:53:00] pastor is preaching or not. You should
[1:53:02] come to church whether your favorite
[1:53:04] evangelist is there. It is your duty to
[1:53:07] come to the house of God in order to
[1:53:10] encourage one another and in order to
[1:53:12] let the devil know, hey, they still go
[1:53:15] to church. And in order to let God know,
[1:53:17] hey, they still go to church. I'm going
[1:53:20] to go down and make love to them while
[1:53:22] they're there.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine 50,000
[1:53:32] converts
[1:53:36] And it tells us the same story in 1962
[1:53:38] and said every one of them went back to
[1:53:40] the Sikhs James and Buddhist
[1:53:44] right
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and he tells us why there was no church
[1:53:50] home
[1:53:52] to take them to. I don't know what
[1:53:54] happened.
[1:53:56] We had five nights and 5,000 each night
[1:53:58] or more come to Christ. I don't know
[1:54:00] what happened.
[1:54:04] I'm going to go ahead and read the rest
[1:54:05] of this.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; I've learned a little better than that.
[1:54:09] Now,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; anybody that's got a brain can
[1:54:14] you learn better. Come on. Let's make
[1:54:16] God's prophet what he was. A human being
[1:54:18] learning as he went.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; This is his words. Press play and say
[1:54:24] it.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Every every Well, apparently one
[1:54:29] every wasn't enough. Remember Jesus
[1:54:31] saying, "Surely, surely, truly, truly."
[1:54:33] That was double verification. So the
[1:54:35] prophet double verified it again. Every
[1:54:38] every person that's saved, oh, I found
[1:54:41] the issue. Showers the world. Every
[1:54:44] every person that's saved ought to have
[1:54:47] a church home.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And every person that's saved in here
[1:54:51] this morning said, "What?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Every every person that's saved ought to
[1:54:57] have a church home." But brother Donnie,
[1:54:59] a lot of the people at their church
[1:55:01] don't like me. I know how you feel. I
[1:55:03] feel the same way sometimes.
[1:55:05] But you know what? I ain't going to stop
[1:55:07] coming. Y'all may vote me out as pastor,
[1:55:10] but you can't vote me out from being
[1:55:11] able to come here. And if you to block
[1:55:13] me at the door, I'll sat outside and
[1:55:15] stream and I run up and down the parking
[1:55:18] lot. Glory to God. Jesus saved me.
[1:55:20] Hallelujah. I'm going to heaven. I will
[1:55:23] not stay home. I'm not going to stay at
[1:55:25] the house and pout. I'm going to come to
[1:55:28] church and shout
[1:55:30] hallelujah. I'm called to worship God.
[1:55:34] I'm called to go to church.
[1:55:46] [Applause]
[1:55:53] Hallelujah.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Every
[1:55:57] every
[1:55:59] person that's saved
[1:56:02] ought to have a church home.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They ought to be in church
[1:56:07] every
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; every
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; time that church has a service or every
[1:56:15] time you pass it,
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; go in,
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; open the doors
[1:56:23] and go in and pray or do something.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You see, friends, he had a respect of
[1:56:32] the house of God. I'm afraid many
[1:56:34] message people do not.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine then that he'd tell
[1:56:39] people that just passed by the church
[1:56:41] building just go in
[1:56:44] and pray.
[1:56:52] Can I read one more?
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know there's many rise up and go
[1:56:57] out and say, "Oh, I don't need to go to
[1:57:00] church anymore.
[1:57:01] Praise God.
[1:57:03] Notice how religious they are now. So
[1:57:06] they tell their lie and then praise God.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to church anymore.
[1:57:13] Praise God.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has come. He's the
[1:57:17] teacher. When you get that idea, you're
[1:57:19] just wrong.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in
[1:57:23] the church?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he was going to be the teacher,
[1:57:28] there are first apostles, prophets,
[1:57:30] teachers, evangelists, and pastors. The
[1:57:33] Holy Spirit set teachers in the church
[1:57:36] so he could teach through the teacher.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; God sent pastors in the church so
[1:57:42] hopefully he could pastor through the
[1:57:43] pastors. He sent evangelist to the
[1:57:45] church so he could evangelize through
[1:57:47] the evangelist. He said people in the
[1:57:49] church instead of chairs, instead of
[1:57:51] pews so he could live in your life. God
[1:57:53] don't live in your padded chair. God
[1:57:55] don't live in no padded pew. God wants
[1:57:58] your heart, my heart, our soul, that he
[1:58:01] can live inside of us and be able to let
[1:58:03] people know, do you go to church? Oh,
[1:58:05] no. I'm in the message. I don't go to
[1:58:06] church. Well, you're not in the message
[1:58:07] there. Because if you really believe
[1:58:09] God's message of the hour, you find you
[1:58:11] a place. Well, brother Don, ain't none
[1:58:13] of them perfect. Why in the world would
[1:58:15] you want to go to a perfect church?
[1:58:16] You'd ruin it in five minutes being
[1:58:18] there. Ain't no one of you perfect,
[1:58:20] including the preacher that's preaching
[1:58:21] to you today. I ain't looking for a
[1:58:23] perfect building. I ain't looking for a
[1:58:26] perfect people. I found a perfect God.
[1:58:29] And that perfect God will produce a
[1:58:31] perfect bride.
[1:58:42] to read two.
[1:58:44] Can I read one more? Plus that last one
[1:58:46] that I read, that would be two, right?
[1:58:47] One plus one.
[1:58:51] Brethren, when you got the baptism of
[1:58:53] the Holy Ghost, it separates you. It
[1:58:57] delivers you from the things of the
[1:58:59] world.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; It makes you love God.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; It makes you
[1:59:09] go to church.
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:13] That's the problem.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; A lot of these folks don't have the Holy
[1:59:16] Ghost.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; If they had the Holy Ghost, it'd grab
[1:59:20] them up. Get your tie on. Get your
[1:59:22] shirt. I don't want to go to church. I
[1:59:24] don't like going to church. They're
[1:59:25] going to have preachers. I don't like
[1:59:27] this that. The Holy Ghost said, "I never
[1:59:29] asked you if you wanted to go." This is
[1:59:31] an order. And you're in the army of God.
[1:59:34] You get up and put your britches on. You
[1:59:37] put your shirt on your tie if you're
[1:59:39] wearing a tie. You don't want to have
[1:59:40] fine with me that you get to the house
[1:59:42] of God and don't you stop and roll that
[1:59:45] bottom lift out but you go to clap in
[1:59:47] your hand and you smile at that man of
[1:59:49] God and you pray for that man of God cuz
[1:59:51] he's been up half a night to in order to
[1:59:53] serve you a good warm Sunday meal. You
[1:59:57] ought to realize it. You ought to say,
[1:59:58] "Preach it, brother." Go ahead, brother.
[2:00:00] I'm with you. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:00:03] Encourage that man of God. Encourage the
[2:00:06] people sitting around by you to say,
[2:00:07] "Amen, too.
[2:00:09] [Applause]
[2:00:11] Hallelujah.
[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; It makes you love God. It makes you go
[2:00:20] to church. It makes you worship him. It
[2:00:26] makes you tell your neighbor about it.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; It makes you live above sin.
[2:00:41] Don't open it, Donnie.
[2:00:57] Who's running this thing back there in
[2:00:58] the back? You know what I done? I laid
[2:01:00] this over and I got all these quotes
[2:01:01] right here in front of me on this
[2:01:02] screen.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, children,
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; it ain't no wonder Satan hates church.
[2:01:16] It ain't no wonder you have such a time
[2:01:19] when it comes to going to the house of
[2:01:21] God.
[2:01:22] You ever have that hard of a time when
[2:01:24] you're going to Walmart,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Kroger, Engles, your favorite football
[2:01:30] team, baseball team, basketball team?
[2:01:32] Isn't it amazing that everything in the
[2:01:35] world will try to hinder you from
[2:01:37] church?
[2:01:39] How it must please Papa when you come in
[2:01:42] and you say, "We made it." And you look
[2:01:46] around said, "Where's Susie?"
[2:01:49] Oh, dear God, we left her at home. Oh,
[2:01:51] Lord have mercy.
[2:01:54] Everything in the world would be on your
[2:01:56] mind.
[2:01:58] Cuz Satan has been looking over my
[2:02:00] shoulder and he sees what God's put on
[2:02:03] my heart and he says, "Oh Lord,
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; if Daniel gets that, oh my goodness,
[2:02:10] if that sister gets it, oh, the demons
[2:02:12] go up there and mess up with it, mess up
[2:02:14] their minds, cause this and cause that,
[2:02:16] cause it." If if they say if he he says
[2:02:18] that and they get it, it'll set them
[2:02:20] free from that thing that's been
[2:02:22] bothering them.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; You're too late.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I can done tell by the looks on their
[2:02:28] faces, they got it.
[2:02:36] Hallelujah.
[2:02:41] Let's bow our heads together. We'll pick
[2:02:44] it up again. Lord,
[2:02:50] oh Jesus. Thank you.
[2:02:53] Thank you,
[2:02:57] Lord. I pray today that you'd help each
[2:02:59] of us.
[2:03:02] What makes my heart sad about this Lord
[2:03:04] preaching it is
[2:03:07] if we could see brother Frank and sister
[2:03:09] Jackie and ask them
[2:03:12] would y'all rather be sitting at home
[2:03:13] streaming
[2:03:15] because you're not physically able to
[2:03:17] come to church
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; if I could go down into
[2:03:23] South Africa
[2:03:26] talk to them folks there who stream our
[2:03:28] services way out in the middle of
[2:03:30] nowhere
[2:03:32] have no church, no preacher around.
[2:03:35] And I could ask them, "Would y'all
[2:03:38] rather stay home and stream?"
[2:03:42] Some of them just recently thought they
[2:03:44] might be able to get a visa to move to
[2:03:46] the States
[2:03:48] and they thought they might be able to
[2:03:50] be allowed to come here. Oh, how excited
[2:03:52] they were just to be able to go to
[2:03:54] church.
[2:03:57] Here we are, Jesus.
[2:04:00] We can go and the least little thing
[2:04:02] discourages us. Forgive us, Father.
[2:04:07] Help us. I pray, dear God. Oh, I know
[2:04:09] our families are going to go on
[2:04:10] vacations and trips and things like
[2:04:12] that. Sure,
[2:04:14] but the negligence is not so much a
[2:04:16] vacation. The negligence is not a family
[2:04:18] outing or something like that, but the
[2:04:20] negligence is when it's just easier to
[2:04:23] stream and stay home.
[2:04:28] You never allowed us or any other
[2:04:31] churches to start using streaming
[2:04:35] so that people would just stay at the
[2:04:37] house.
[2:04:40] Lord, there's something about us coming
[2:04:42] together.
[2:04:44] May we always do it, Lord, I pray.
[2:04:49] And maybe not just get here, but getting
[2:04:52] here is part of the battle for sure.
[2:04:56] But now it's hearing time, listening
[2:04:58] time, worshiping time.
[2:05:02] We love you, Father.
[2:05:06] How many of you today would raise your
[2:05:08] hand to the Lord? Lord,
[2:05:10] forgive me. I I've not had the always
[2:05:12] had the right attitude about church.
[2:05:15] I admit it, Lord. I've been sawful and
[2:05:18] lazy.
[2:05:20] Would you forgive me, Jesus?
[2:05:25] Would you lay your hand over on that
[2:05:27] person standing by you and let's just
[2:05:28] off for a word of prayer.
[2:05:32] I think of a children if you'd lived in
[2:05:34] the synagogue day and they would have
[2:05:36] read the exact same scriptures over and
[2:05:38] over again made some of the exact same
[2:05:41] comments service after service after
[2:05:44] service. Would you like Jesus have been
[2:05:47] faithful? Oh, you'd have stayed home
[2:05:49] said he don't need to go. They don't
[2:05:51] need to go. Thomas missed one meeting
[2:05:54] and wouldn't you know it that was the
[2:05:56] very meeting Jesus showed up in a
[2:05:57] glorified body.
[2:06:00] Oh my.
[2:06:03] May God so strike our hearts with the
[2:06:06] deeper sense of love and devotion
[2:06:10] to realize you going to church. It's not
[2:06:12] just about you, but it's when you're
[2:06:14] there, you're encouraging your pastor.
[2:06:17] You're encouraging others that see
[2:06:19] you've come through a hard trial and a
[2:06:21] hard time and yet they see you pressing
[2:06:25] and they can tell you're heavy and
[2:06:27] distraught and you don't know what to do
[2:06:30] but you come anyhow.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, as we have our hands laid
[2:06:36] one upon the other.
[2:06:39] Now it's not just me praying but it's
[2:06:40] your children praying for one another.
[2:06:42] Father,
[2:06:44] I pray dear God,
[2:06:48] may each of us fall in love
[2:06:52] with you more than we ever have in our
[2:06:54] life.
[2:06:56] And if we fall in love with you, it'll
[2:06:59] reflect itself by meeting together with
[2:07:02] you and your children where there you
[2:07:07] can worship.
[2:07:10] I believe you want to come in this place
[2:07:12] this morning with your presence.
[2:07:17] Put your healing arms, your loving arms
[2:07:21] around those that are weary and troubled
[2:07:23] and sad
[2:07:25] and pull them up close to you, Jesus.
[2:07:28] Just whisper secret things to them.
[2:07:32] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:35] Who are we? I know, Lord. Who are we
[2:07:36] that the almighty God would desire to
[2:07:40] pull us into his loving arms? I can't
[2:07:42] say that I fully understand it, but all
[2:07:44] I know is I believe it's the truth.
[2:07:49] Help us, Jesus.
[2:07:51] Forgive us for ever having the idea
[2:07:55] church as usual.
[2:07:58] Lord, may we come under such expectation
[2:08:00] when we walk through them doors that we
[2:08:02] never know from one service to the next
[2:08:04] what you're going to do, what you're
[2:08:06] going to say, how you're going to move.
[2:08:11] Oh, we worship you, Lord. We worship
[2:08:14] you.
[2:08:15] We always want to be open to you that
[2:08:17] you can do as you wish to do. But we
[2:08:21] also realize some services we may not
[2:08:24] see near as much display of your power.
[2:08:29] And one of the reasons could be because
[2:08:31] you're wanting to see what we're going
[2:08:34] to do in that service.
[2:08:37] So you want to see how are we going to
[2:08:39] love you with no anointing? How are we
[2:08:42] going to praise you with no shouting
[2:08:45] sermon? What are we going to do in that
[2:08:47] service?
[2:08:50] And I don't want to fail, Lord.
[2:08:53] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:08:56] I bless your name today, Lord God.
[2:09:02] Can we just lift our hands together now,
[2:09:04] friends, and just close your eyes? I
[2:09:06] know you got lunch plans. Beautiful day
[2:09:08] outside. You got things you're going to
[2:09:10] do. Nothing wrong with that.
[2:09:13] But let's not let's not let that crowded
[2:09:14] to his time.
[2:09:17] Hallelujah.
[2:09:19] We worship you, Lord God. I bless your
[2:09:22] name, Jesus.
[2:09:25] I thank you, Father.
[2:09:28] We praise you, Lord. We're here to
[2:09:30] encourage.
[2:09:32] We're here, Father. It's our duty. Yes.
[2:09:35] We have fulfilled our duty today. But we
[2:09:37] want it to be more than dutious works.
[2:09:41] We want it to be from our souls, from
[2:09:43] our hearts.
[2:09:46] Oh Jesus, with my body I thee worship.
[2:09:53] With my hands, with my mouth,
[2:09:56] I thee worship my God. With my soul,
[2:10:02] I thee worship. I give to you what I
[2:10:04] give to none other. There's not a person
[2:10:07] in the world that I love any more any
[2:10:10] more precious and dear to me than Carol
[2:10:13] than down to my children, my
[2:10:15] grandchildren, my church, my friends
[2:10:17] around the world. But you have that
[2:10:20] sacred special place
[2:10:22] that you're the only one that gives a
[2:10:24] certain type of love and only one that I
[2:10:27] give a certain type back. It's reserved
[2:10:31] for you only, Lord.
[2:10:34] We worship Jesus.
[2:10:37] We worship you Jesus.
[2:10:41] With my body,
[2:10:45] the worship,
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:48] with my blood, I gave
[2:10:52] for you.
[2:10:55] My sorrow and my crying that day.
[2:11:02] It was opened all for you.
[2:11:09] For you
[2:11:11] are the reason
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:16] that I went to Calvary.
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:22] Now broad I peel.
[2:11:26] I ask you my love.
[2:11:29] Would you give your body to me?
[2:11:38] Give me all you.
[2:11:44] Give me all you.
[2:11:50] I want your hands.
[2:11:53] I want your eyes.
[2:11:57] Would you give it all to me?
[2:12:03] Will you give me all you are?
[2:12:10] Will you give me all you are?
[2:12:17] And one day I'll give a new body
[2:12:24] to you.
[2:12:32] Service after
[2:12:34] service
[2:12:36] I come to meet you.
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:44] time
[2:12:46] after time.
[2:12:49] I'm there to greet you,
[2:12:56] but you're so busy with your wife and
[2:13:03] your children and your business and all
[2:13:07] your other things, too.
[2:13:10] that you scarcely raise your hand and
[2:13:15] your voice and give me time I want from
[2:13:20] you.
[2:13:25] Will you give me your all
[2:13:30] my bride?
[2:13:33] Lord God forgive us.
[2:13:37] Oh, will you give me your all,
[2:13:43] my loving bride.
[2:13:50] I love you
[2:13:53] and I want you
[2:13:57] and I need you to be my wife.
[2:14:03] Will you give me your all? Will you give
[2:14:07] me your all? For I gave my all for you.
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:18] I'm longing to see you,
[2:14:22] to hold you,
[2:14:26] to put my arms
[2:14:29] around you. I'm longing to touch you,
[2:14:35] oh God.
[2:14:39] Oh God,
[2:14:44] I want to put my hand
[2:14:48] upon your shoulder,
[2:14:52] my eyes to meet your eyes
[2:14:56] [Music]
[2:14:58] to put my arms all around you, my love,
[2:15:05] place you by my time.
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:12] Will you give me your all?
[2:15:16] [Music]
[2:15:18] Will you give me your all?
[2:15:22] [Music]
[2:15:24] Reserve that part
[2:15:27] for me, my love.
[2:15:31] Only you can share with me.
[2:15:37] And soon and very soon we'll be
[2:15:42] together.
[2:15:43] And soon and very soon we'll be talking.
[2:15:50] And soon and very soon we'll be walking
[2:15:56] together.
[2:15:59] Together.
[2:16:03] Give me your all today,
[2:16:06] my bride.
[2:16:09] Give me your all. Let me be by your
[2:16:13] side. Will you give me your all? Let me
[2:16:18] love you so dear. Will you give me your
[2:16:22] all? I'll take away your fears.
[2:16:28] Will you give me your all
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:37] m
[2:16:42] It was for you I cried,
[2:16:46] for you I died,
[2:16:49] for you I raised from the dead.
[2:16:55] It was for you I lived. It was for you I
[2:17:01] give everything I am today.
[2:17:09] Now will you give me your all?
[2:17:18] Your all.
[2:17:23] Will you give me your all?
[2:17:28] Oh Lord God,
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:31] your all.
[2:17:34] Sweetheart,
[2:17:36] I want your
[2:17:40] all.
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:46] Hallelujah.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[2:17:52] Hallelujah.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Father, we worship you today, Lord.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just raise
[2:18:01] our hands, can we? I'm going to let you
[2:18:03] go here shortly.
[2:18:06] We give you praise, Lord Jesus.
[2:18:10] Thank you, Father.
[2:18:13] Thank you, Father, for all that you mean
[2:18:15] to us today. Lord,
[2:18:18] if there's one who hasn't made that full
[2:18:20] commitment to you today, I'm afraid
[2:18:22] before they walk out these doors, smite
[2:18:26] their hearts with such conviction, Lord
[2:18:28] Jesus, they'll be able to surrender
[2:18:30] their all finally.
[2:18:33] Anything they've held back in that
[2:18:35] secret closet of their life, Lord, may
[2:18:38] they be able to give it to you and walk
[2:18:39] out of here with a greater determination
[2:18:42] to live for you, to serve you.
[2:18:46] but also to love you like they never
[2:18:49] have before.
[2:18:52] We worship you today, Jesus.
[2:18:55] Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:01] Thank you, heavenly father.
[2:19:04] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:19:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:19:11] Brother Larry, let's sing together. I
[2:19:13] could still go free.
[2:19:15] Let's sing this together before we go.
[2:19:19] Not forsaking the assembling of
[2:19:21] ourselves together
[2:19:24] as the manner of some is, but exhorting
[2:19:28] one another to do what? To come
[2:19:32] together.
[2:19:34] Exhorting one another. Carol and I was
[2:19:37] privileged yesterday to be able to meet
[2:19:39] with some of the widows here at the
[2:19:41] church and just have a time of
[2:19:43] fellowship together. And
[2:19:47] many of them brought pictures and of
[2:19:49] their husbands that had passed. And each
[2:19:53] picture that was brought in on the
[2:19:55] table,
[2:19:57] my heart got heavier and heavier.
[2:20:00] And I stood there and looked at him and
[2:20:02] they wanted me to talk to them a little
[2:20:03] bit. And I tried to, but I just got so
[2:20:07] broke up.
[2:20:12] I could see it on their faces. And some
[2:20:14] of them talked to me before the little
[2:20:16] gathering and tears running down their
[2:20:18] eyes,
[2:20:20] longing for that resurrection. And how
[2:20:23] we can do it, cuz we're free.
[2:20:27] We're free.
[2:20:29] Let's sing it together.
[2:20:31] Lock me up in a prison. Let me sing it
[2:20:33] as we go. You can log Whoa.
[2:20:38] We won't be able to sing it there, will
[2:20:40] we?
[2:20:42] You can lock
[2:20:45] me up
[2:20:48] in a prison
[2:20:54] and throw
[2:20:57] away
[2:21:00] the key.
[2:21:05] You can take
[2:21:09] away
[2:21:11] my vision
[2:21:15] [Music]
[2:21:16] from these eyes
[2:21:20] that now
[2:21:22] can see.
[2:21:26] Sing it with me now.
[2:21:28] Deprive
[2:21:31] me of
[2:21:34] the food
[2:21:35] [Music]
[2:21:37] I need.
[2:21:42] even by
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:55] know
[2:22:01] that I
[2:22:04] can still
[2:22:06] go free.
[2:22:10] Oh,
[2:22:11] said that I
[2:22:15] could still
[2:22:17] go free.
[2:22:23] What kind
[2:22:25] of a man
[2:22:28] reach down
[2:22:31] his hand
[2:22:34] and do this for me?
[2:22:41] for me.
[2:22:44] So
[2:22:47] unworthy
[2:22:49] to me,
[2:22:52] but not f
[2:22:54] to kill
[2:22:58] on
[2:23:00] the cross.
[2:23:02] Had my name in
[2:23:05] his will. He said that I
[2:23:10] could still
[2:23:12] go free.
[2:23:19] Never
[2:23:21] could
[2:23:24] quite
[2:23:26] understand
[2:23:29] why he
[2:23:32] would leave
[2:23:34] his throne.
[2:23:39] Home
[2:23:41] on
[2:23:43] the road
[2:23:46] of an earthly
[2:23:49] man.
[2:23:51] Feel the pain
[2:23:54] of flesh.
[2:23:56] Flesh and bone.
[2:24:00] Oh,
[2:24:02] in later
[2:24:05] child
[2:24:08] that long
[2:24:11] path
[2:24:13] that led
[2:24:16] to Calary
[2:24:23] where the blood
[2:24:26] red saints broke.
[2:24:29] Call
[2:24:31] my chains. He said that I
[2:24:37] could still go free.
[2:24:42] Oh, he said that I
[2:24:47] could still
[2:24:49] go free.
[2:24:54] Tell me what kind
[2:24:58] of a man
[2:24:59] [Music]
[2:25:00] would reach down
[2:25:03] his hand
[2:25:06] and do this for me.
[2:25:12] Oh, for me.
[2:25:17] Oh
[2:25:19] unworthy
[2:25:22] to live.
[2:25:24] Oh, and not fail
[2:25:27] to kill.
[2:25:29] But the man on
[2:25:33] the cross
[2:25:35] had my name in
[2:25:38] his will.
[2:25:40] He said that I
[2:25:44] could still
[2:25:46] go free.
[2:25:50] Oh, I never
[2:25:55] could
[2:25:57] quite
[2:26:00] understand
[2:26:03] why king
[2:26:06] would leave
[2:26:08] his throne.
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:14] Take on
[2:26:17] the role
[2:26:19] of an earthly
[2:26:23] man.
[2:26:25] Feel the pain
[2:26:28] of flesh
[2:26:30] and more.
[2:26:33] Think of a children for you. He did it.
[2:26:36] And later
[2:26:39] trod. Thank God that lonely
[2:26:45] path
[2:26:47] that led
[2:26:50] to Calary

[2:27:06] your shame and said that you
[2:27:11] you can still
[2:27:13] go free. Let's sing it together now. Oh,
[2:27:18] he said that I

[2:27:31] Go in the fear of God.
[2:27:34] Hallelujah.
[2:27:36] Reach down
[2:27:38] out
[2:27:41] and do this for me.
[2:27:48] For me,
