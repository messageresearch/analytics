[11:25] Hallelujah. We're going to look at our
[11:26] prayer requests. We have several
[11:28] tonight. We're going to let you know
[11:29] about. Want to remember brother Jim and
[11:31] Sister Linda Maxwell. Both homesick need
[11:34] a touch from the Lord tonight. Sister
[11:36] Brenda Vasic from Rola, Missouri called
[11:40] to request prayer for herself. She's
[11:41] been dealing with cancer of the liver.
[11:43] Considering the possibility of some
[11:45] alternative treatment, please pray for
[11:47] healing that God would lead her in the
[11:50] right direction. Also, she's asking
[11:52] prayer for her sister Peggy Kirkpatrick,
[11:55] who needs strength and wisdom to deal
[11:56] with an ongoing and very serious family
[11:59] matter that God knows all about. So, we
[12:02] just commit that unto the Lord. Brother
[12:04] Brian Chapman from Guyana called and
[12:06] wanted to extend his greetings to the
[12:08] church and to the ministry. He considers
[12:11] us his home church. And if pleasing to
[12:13] the Lord, would like nothing more than
[12:15] to be able to visit and fellowship with
[12:17] us. Please keep keep him in your prayers
[12:20] that God will keep him safe and direct
[12:22] his path. Well, we'd like to meet that
[12:24] guy, wouldn't we? I hope he hope he
[12:26] makes it the Lord would just work it out
[12:28] till he could come see us. Sister Eva
[12:31] Hegy from Illinois wants to thank
[12:32] everyone for their prayers. Uh, and for
[12:35] the prayer cloth that Brother Donnie
[12:37] prayed over. Her grandson, who is 14
[12:39] years old, overdosed on some
[12:41] prescription pills. But God's timing was
[12:44] perfect because she received the prayer
[12:46] cloth and was able to place it on him
[12:48] after the overdose. The doctors were not
[12:51] expecting a good outcome, but he woke up
[12:54] is alert and is expected to make a
[12:56] complete recovery. Please continue to
[12:58] keep sister Eva, her daughter who is
[13:01] bipolar and gr grandson in prayer. So,
[13:04] thank the Lord. Thank the Lord for that
[13:06] testimony tonight. Amen.
[13:09] I'd like to request prayer for the
[13:11] believers for my 80 83 year old
[13:14] stepmother
[13:16] Ray Forum. She's already not in the best
[13:19] of health, but a while back the doctors
[13:21] found a large bulge in her throat that's
[13:23] been trapping food. When she swallows,
[13:25] they're scheduling surgery for some time
[13:28] for sometime soon. Please pray that
[13:31] she'll have a full recovery and possibly
[13:33] even healing before the surgery can be
[13:36] uh performed. Thank you. And I will keep
[13:38] you updated. Brother Don Forum sends
[13:40] that in. So we just commit that to the
[13:42] Lord. Brother Randy Scott wants us to
[13:44] remember him in prayer. Going to be
[13:46] having a heart procedure. Just asking
[13:49] that the Lord would let all things work
[13:50] to his good. We just believe he's more
[13:53] than able to do that, don't we? Amen.
[13:55] Brother Greg Robbins not feeling well
[13:56] tonight. Needs a touch from the Lord. So
[13:59] let's remember him. John Taylor turns
[14:01] this in from my daughter's friend and
[14:03] coworker. uh severe allergic reaction
[14:07] has caused life-threatening events over
[14:09] and over recently. The cause is unknown.
[14:12] So, we want to commit that need unto the
[14:13] Lord. Sister Ruth Louise Jax is
[14:16] requesting prayer for her daughter
[14:17] Elizabeth. She is ready to surrender her
[14:20] life to the Lord, seeking deliverance,
[14:22] healing, wisdom, and guidance in all
[14:24] matters concerning her walk with the
[14:25] Lord. Also, Sister Ruth will be having
[14:28] some follow-up tests performed regarding
[14:30] some mobility issues she's been dealing
[14:33] with. Please pray that she will receive
[14:35] a good report. Also, she turns in a
[14:37] prayer request for her nephew. His name
[14:39] is Samuel. He's going through a very
[14:41] difficult time in his life, but most of
[14:43] all, pray for his salvation. So, we want
[14:46] to remember that request tonight as
[14:48] well. Please pray for Conrad Ule. I
[14:52] didn't get that name right, I'm sure. He
[14:54] pastored a small church in Pittsburgh
[14:56] for many years. Recently retired to move
[14:59] to Asheville to be with his children and
[15:01] grandchildren. He recently had a massive
[15:04] stroke. Has been requested that we pray
[15:06] for him. So we want to remember that
[15:08] prayer request tonight. Sister Barbara
[15:10] and Brother Bert want to be remembered
[15:11] in prayer tonight. The Lord would touch
[15:13] them. Prayer request. Brother Melvin
[15:15] Lynch called and request prayer for
[15:17] Sister Becky. She's dealing with a
[15:19] kidney stone and would like to have
[15:21] prayer that she can pass this stone
[15:23] without having to go to the hospital. So

[15:26] tonight as we pray. Many needs. How many
[15:29] of you have a need you'd like for this
[15:31] group to pray about tonight? Could we
[15:33] just stand together? Let me make this
[15:34] announcement before we sing a little bit
[15:36] more of that song. The tithing
[15:38] statements are available for you in the
[15:40] library. If you'd like to pick one of
[15:42] those up, some of you have requested
[15:44] those. They are available in the library
[15:46] tonight. So, tithing statements. So,
[15:48] remember that the blood will never lose
[15:50] its power.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; The blood keeps us clean.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we've been washed by the blood.
[15:58] Amen. Look at your neighbor and tell
[16:00] them, "God bless you."

[16:05] statement you can make to somebody is

[30:33] song, but while I was singing, I got so
[30:35] burdened for someone I love very dearly.
[30:37] So um I hope it's a blessing to you, but
[30:41] I'll be honest, I'm not sure I'm going
[30:42] to even be able to sing it tonight. So,
[30:43] [music] I just ask for your patience and
[30:45] uh I just trust that it's a blessing.
[30:58] [music]
[31:09] Come out of sadness from wherever you've
[31:13] been. [music] Come brokenhearted,
[31:16] let rescue begin.
[31:19] Come [music] find your mercy. Oh sinner,
[31:23] [singing] come kneel.
[31:25] Earth has [music] no sorrow that heaven
[31:28] can heal. Earth has no
[31:31] [singing and music] sorrow that heaven
[31:33] can give.
[31:38] So lay down your burdens, [music]
[31:44] lay [singing] down your shame.
[31:49] All [singing] who are broken,
[31:54] lift up [singing] your face.
[31:59] A wonderer, come [music]
[32:02] home.

[32:10] Lay down your heart. Lay down your
[32:14] [singing] heart. Come as [music] you
[32:17] are.
[32:38] There's hope [music and singing] for the
[32:40] hopeless and all those who stray. Come
[32:44] sit at the [singing] table.
[32:46] Come taste the grace. There's rest for
[32:50] [music] the weary, [singing]
[32:52] rest that endures.
[32:55] Earth [singing] has no [music] sorrow
[32:57] that heaven can cure.
[33:02] So lay down [music and singing] your
[33:04] burdens.

[33:35] Lay down your [singing]
[33:38] lay down your heart. [music] Come as you
[33:42] are.
[33:46] Come as [music] you [singing] are.
[33:51] All in his [music and singing] arms.
[33:56] and come as you are.
[34:03] There's joy in the morning. Oh, sinner,
[34:06] [music]
[34:06] be still.
[34:08] Earth has no sorrow [singing] that
[34:11] heaven can't heal.
[34:14] Earth has [music] no sorrow [singing]
[34:16] that heaven can't heal.
[34:21] So lay [music] down your burdens,
[34:27] lay [music] down your [singing]
[34:29] shame.
[34:33] All who [music and singing] are broken.
[34:38] Lift up your face.
[34:43] Oh wonder [singing]
[34:45] come. [music]
[34:49] You're not too far.

[35:15] Oh, [music]
[35:17] there's joy in the morning. Oh, sinner,
[35:21] be [music] still.
[35:23] Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't
[35:26] [music]
[35:27] heal.
[35:28] Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't
[35:33] heal. [music]
[35:38] [applause]
[36:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:11] &gt;&gt; I've had many tears of sorrows.
[36:14] [singing]
[36:15] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[36:20] There have been times I didn't know
[36:22] right [singing]
[36:23] from wrong.
[36:27] [music] But in [singing] every
[36:29] situation,
[36:31] God gave blessed [singing]
[36:33] constellation.
[36:35] Let my trials come [music] to only
[36:38] [singing] make me strong.
[36:42] [music]
[36:44] Through it [singing] all,
[36:48] [music] through it all,
[36:52] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[36:56] I've [singing] learned to trust in God.
[37:01] [music] Through it all, [singing]
[37:05] through it all, [singing]
[37:09] I've learned to [music] depend upon his
[37:13] word. [singing]
[37:17] I've been to a lot of places
[37:21] and [music and singing] I've seen so
[37:23] many faces.
[37:25] There have been times [singing]
[37:27] [music] I felt so all alone.
[37:33] But in those lonely hours, yes, those
[37:38] precious [singing]
[37:39] lonely hours, [music]
[37:41] Jesus lets me know that [singing] I am
[37:45] his own.
[37:48] [music] Oh, through it all.
[37:54] Through [music]
[37:54] it all,
[37:58] I've learned to trust in
[38:00] [singing and music] Jesus.
[38:02] I've learned to trust in God.
[38:05] [music] Through it all, [singing]
[38:10] oh through it all,
[38:14] I learn to [music and singing] depend
[38:17] upon his word.
[38:20] [music]
[38:21] And I thank God [singing] for the
[38:24] mountains.
[38:26] And I [music] thank him for the valleys.
[38:29] And I thank him for the storms [singing]
[38:32] he's brought me through.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, for if I ever had a problem, I
[38:41] wouldn't [singing] know that my God can
[38:44] solve it. I never [music] know what
[38:47] faith of God can do. [music]
[38:52] Oh, [singing]
[38:53] through it all.
[38:57] Oh, [music] through it all. [singing]
[39:01] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[39:05] I've learned to trust in [singing] God.
[39:09] Through [music] it all,
[39:13] oh [singing] through it all,
[39:16] [music]
[39:17] I've learned to depend [singing] upon
[39:21] his word. [music]
[39:25] I've learned to depend
[39:27] [music and singing]
[39:28] upon his word. Through
[39:33] [music]
[39:39] [applause]
[39:46] it all,
[39:47] &gt;&gt; I've learned to trust in Jesus. Praise
[39:49] the Lord.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in the house of
[39:53] God tonight?
[39:55] &gt;&gt; What a great privilege for us. We um are
[39:59] certainly under anticipation for the
[40:01] service tonight.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Believing the Lord's going to come and
[40:05] speak to us by his word. And before we
[40:07] do, we I certainly want to say I
[40:09] appreciate all of you praying for me.
[40:10] While I was sick, I'm doing a lot
[40:12] better. Still ain't got my strength back
[40:14] 100%, but um I'm doing really good. Um
[40:18] Carol got sick yesterday. Um so we
[40:21] certainly desire if you'd pray for her
[40:23] and remember her. Looks like apparently
[40:26] the same thing. as any good wife does
[40:28] take care of her sick husband, she winds
[40:30] up getting sick herself. So, so just
[40:32] certainly appreciate you remembering
[40:33] her. I'm sure that most of you have
[40:36] heard about this storm they're saying is
[40:38] coming our way, right?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; I'll be the first to admit I don't
[40:43] understand all about the way God and
[40:47] storms and the devil and storms work.
[40:51] Okay, I do know the devil can get in
[40:54] storms and the devil can get in wind.
[40:57] And I know that was not the Lord that
[41:00] caused the storms and the wind out on
[41:02] the ship and then Jesus turned and
[41:05] rebuked what he started or what he
[41:07] caused. So I do know that there's been
[41:11] different occasions of course in the
[41:14] scripture and the prophet's life and
[41:16] then u of other people I know as well
[41:19] where the saints of God have prayed and
[41:21] God has turned storms stopped storms
[41:25] made them lighter than what they said it
[41:29] was going to be. And um I just believe
[41:32] prayer works.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Now God's not our mascot. He's not the
[41:37] type of, you know, we we want him to do
[41:39] this and we tell him to do that. So
[41:42] myself when I approach him on anything
[41:44] that I'm uncertain about, I just always,
[41:47] Lord, unless you have a reason or you
[41:51] have a cause. U but for those of you
[41:54] that have heard about it, it certainly
[41:56] sounds like it could be a pretty rough
[41:57] thing. How many believes that we can
[42:00] pray and ask God to move on our behalf
[42:03] &gt;&gt; and be mindful of us during this time?
[42:07] All right, let's just uh let's just pray
[42:09] together. How many has a need in your
[42:10] heart personally, your life, for your
[42:12] family? God bless you. Let's hold these
[42:15] needs here before the Lord and we'll
[42:17] we'll pray together. [cough]
[42:20] [clears throat]
[42:21] Lord Jesus, how grateful we are that we
[42:25] can bow our heads
[42:27] and call upon your wonderful name.
[42:31] What a privilege it is for us as
[42:34] Gentiles, especially
[42:37] that were without the Commonwealth of
[42:39] Israel, dogs, outcast,
[42:43] and yet today the bride of Christ. We
[42:47] thank you for what you've done for us.
[42:49] We're grateful. May it never become
[42:52] common us just get used to it that we
[42:56] can pray. It's still a privilege to me
[42:58] to pray. It's an honor to be allowed to
[43:02] come into your presence.
[43:04] So, Father, we're asking tonight that
[43:06] you would help us. You saw all the hands
[43:09] that were uplifted, dear Jesus. You see
[43:12] this prayer cross that I have in my hand
[43:15] tonight, dear God, for our precious
[43:17] sister here, Lord, that's facing some
[43:20] things and test and so on. And you know
[43:22] all about that, Lord Jesus. And we're
[43:25] praying that you'll be with her.
[43:26] There'll be no evil that'll come of
[43:28] this. Father, we also ask you that you'd
[43:32] move for Carol, Lord, just brokenhearted
[43:36] that she couldn't come to church
[43:37] tonight. May the spirit of God, I pray,
[43:40] just move for and touch her, Lord. May
[43:43] this thing pass from her body. I know
[43:46] Lord that there's many different
[43:47] viruses, bugs, this that and the other
[43:49] that's going on and so many folks that
[43:52] are sick. But we believe that you're a
[43:54] healer of all these.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we want to mention to you
[43:59] about this storm situation.
[44:02] You know, heavenly father that the
[44:05] prince of the power of the air. He's the
[44:08] one that likes to break into things and
[44:11] speed up winds that are made normal and
[44:15] natural and nominal and turn them into a
[44:18] hurricane and tornadoes. And he loves to
[44:21] get in the wind and to be able to
[44:24] destroy people. And he's not just
[44:26] wanting to destroy your children. He
[44:29] wants to destroy his own because it's
[44:31] not just message people who get hit in
[44:34] hurricanes and tornadoes. It's any
[44:38] people and he expresses his being that
[44:42] he hates humanity. That's just who he
[44:46] is. He cannot love.
[44:50] But we're calling upon the God of love
[44:53] because we have experienced the love of
[44:56] God.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. So, we're asking you tonight,
[44:59] Father, for your mercy. I'll just be
[45:01] honest before you and these people. I I
[45:04] don't understand how all these things
[45:06] work, Lord. And if we would be asking
[45:08] anything that would be out of what you
[45:10] want it to be, then we just say, "Forget
[45:13] all that." But as far as we know, just
[45:16] the best that we're looking at. You see,
[45:18] Father, the things that they're saying
[45:19] and forecasting and ice and this and
[45:22] that and the other. And father, we're
[45:25] just praying that you would watch over
[45:28] your children. I have heard testimonies
[45:31] from South Carolina, from the
[45:33] Philippines, from different parts of the
[45:36] world, of India, of Madagascar, of
[45:39] different places where the children of
[45:41] God was in the line for terrible,
[45:44] terrible storms and something happened
[45:47] and turned and we believe that's our
[45:50] God. Yes.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; So, Father, we're praying for this.
[45:54] We'll we'll pray it in this way and
[45:56] we'll know we're never out of your will
[45:57] when we do. We're praying for your
[46:00] mercy, Father, to us. Be mindful of us,
[46:03] Lord Jesus. We thank you. Of course, we
[46:06] have people's well-being in mind and we
[46:09] have all these things. But Lord, you
[46:11] know, my main reason I don't want to
[46:13] miss church on Sunday. I just love going
[46:15] to church. I love being where you are
[46:18] and being where your children are. Would
[46:21] you just be mindful of us, Father? In
[46:23] the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray.
[46:26] Amen. God bless you, saints. Aren't you
[46:29] glad we have a heavenly father that
[46:30] loves us so much
[46:32] &gt;&gt; and is so concerned about the things
[46:35] that we are concerned about? Let's read
[46:38] if you would tonight [clears throat] in
[46:40] the the book of Jude again only one
[46:42] chapter of course and we'll begin
[46:44] reading ver in verse 4.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[46:47] &gt;&gt; We've been speaking about the bride's
[46:49] dowy and what her father has given to
[46:53] her. And the dowy of course are multiple
[46:56] gifts given by the love and the
[47:00] character of the father and that he
[47:03] would give it to her to equip her for
[47:07] her new life. but also as it was in the
[47:09] case of of Rebecca that it would have
[47:13] been for her journey cuz she has a
[47:14] several month journey from where she's
[47:17] going to be able to meet her bridegroom.
[47:20] So for us, for many of us, it's been
[47:22] decades of our life that we've been in
[47:25] this journey to meet our bridegroom. And
[47:28] truly, we need gifts from our father as
[47:31] well in our diary. It will contain so
[47:35] many things. Many of them will be
[47:36] supernatural. Many of them will be
[47:38] natural. It'll be things like healing.
[47:41] It'll be things like place for you to
[47:43] live, a place for you to work, all kinds
[47:45] of natural things. But then first and
[47:48] foremost is the things that are
[47:51] supernatural. So it may be a little bit
[47:54] of a contrast to what I'm going to read
[47:56] tonight, but you'll see where I'm going
[47:57] to go once we do. In verse four in the
[47:59] book of Jude, for there are certain men
[48:02] crept in unawares who were before of old
[48:08] ordained
[48:10] to this condemnation,
[48:12] ungodly men, turning the grace of our
[48:17] God into lascifiousness and denying the
[48:21] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:26] I will therefore put you in remembrance
[48:29] though you once knew this. Now watch he
[48:31] carries a thought from verse 4 to verse
[48:34] 5 on to verse 6 and then we read it in
[48:38] Peter also that Peter picks up the same
[48:41] thing and talks of the same thought. So
[48:44] it's of beings and people that were in a
[48:48] certain state or a state in a certain
[48:52] position and then something happened to
[48:55] them and they walked away from that
[48:57] state and then these writers point for
[49:01] us to look at them currently where they
[49:04] are and see what happened to them when
[49:07] they turned away. I will therefore put
[49:10] you in remembrance, though you once knew
[49:12] this, how that the Lord having saved the
[49:14] people out of the land of Egypt, excuse
[49:17] me, afterward destroyed them that
[49:20] believe not. And the angels, now he
[49:23] jumps from human beings, he jumps to the
[49:25] angels. And the angels which kept not
[49:28] their first estate, but left their own
[49:32] habitation, their own habitation, hath
[49:36] he reserved an everlasting chains under
[49:39] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[49:44] day. May the Lord bless his word. You
[49:45] may be seated. Now, you may wonder, what
[49:48] would a dowy have to do with talking
[49:51] about fallen angels and people that have
[49:54] once walked in the light of God and then
[49:58] turned away from that light of God? What
[50:01] what would we need something to equip
[50:03] us? I'll tell you why. So, we don't
[50:06] become one of those people.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Now, it's a great thing when people come
[50:12] to light. It's a great thing when people
[50:14] come to the knowledge of our Lord and
[50:16] Savior Jesus Christ, but it's just not
[50:19] great enough. It's wonderful when people
[50:22] can come to light and be illuminated,
[50:25] and the spirit of God can help them and
[50:27] set them free from lots and lots of
[50:29] things. But knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[50:33] will not keep you from the power of
[50:35] darkness. Knowledge of the mysteries of
[50:38] God are also, but knowledge of the
[50:41] mysteries will not keep you either. Now,
[50:44] for us to try to think of what it must
[50:47] have been like for angels which had
[50:50] never cursed, never lied, never stole,
[50:53] never done anything wrong. All they knew
[50:56] was hallelujah, praise the Lord. And
[50:59] they were given this awesome position in
[51:02] the presence of God. And they worshiped
[51:05] him. No doubt they had a love for him
[51:08] and they had an adoration which was pure
[51:11] and true and genuine initially and now
[51:14] remember they were created on a basis
[51:18] and put in a very similar position as
[51:21] Adam was in the garden of Eden. So it
[51:24] was a position that was given directly
[51:28] to them, but they could fall from it and
[51:32] they were not sealed to that position
[51:34] for eternity. Neither was Adam. But yet
[51:37] they were on probation. So these angels
[51:41] in this probationary period begin to
[51:44] hear another message from another great
[51:49] being. And this great being was God's
[51:53] right-hand man to fellowship. Question
[51:56] answers 1959. God's right-hand man to
[52:01] fellowship. Now his name was Lucifer in
[52:04] the beginning or day star or
[52:08] lightbringer,
[52:10] son of the morning. And he was one of
[52:14] great ability and power. Isaiah 14
[52:17] declares him. Also, Ezekiel 28 declares
[52:20] him and tells us that he was a mighty
[52:23] one. He was in charge of the music
[52:26] department in heaven. Thou was created
[52:30] perfect in the day that thou was
[52:32] created. Thy harps and thy pipes and thy
[52:36] tabs. And in him was every precious
[52:40] stone, the sardis, the topaz, the
[52:43] carbuncle, all these beautiful things
[52:47] which are actually the foundation stones
[52:50] of the city you and I are striving to go
[52:53] to. And he was given a great preeminence
[52:57] among the angels of God. And sin began
[53:03] [cough and clears throat]
[53:04] not on the earth but actually in heaven.
[53:08] And Isaiah 14 catches it when he said,
[53:12] "I will." There it began.
[53:16] So he wanted to be like God,
[53:20] but he had nothing or no one to work
[53:24] through. So he is not omnipotent,
[53:28] omnisient, omnipresent.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; [cough]
[53:32] &gt;&gt; So he has to have beings by which he can
[53:36] reflect everything that he wants to be.
[53:41] But he can't make any. He's everything
[53:44] God was
[53:45] [cough]
[53:46] except a creator.
[53:49] So he can't create beings to worship
[53:53] him. He cannot create beings to help him
[53:57] carry it out.
[53:59] So where's he going to get them? He's
[54:01] going to get them from God.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; But there's a class of angels that he
[54:07] cannot get, which are elect.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; But it just so happened God made some in
[54:15] a similar category as Lucifer himself.
[54:20] They too were put on probation.
[54:24] So he exalts himself over in the north
[54:27] side of heaven and he begins to have
[54:30] some meetings, we'll call them. Now the
[54:33] original church was God's church. God
[54:37] was the pastor, the overseer, all of
[54:40] that.
[54:42] [cough] Excuse me.
[54:45] But Satan decided
[54:47] that this is a great idea.
[54:51] I also would like I want to be a pastor.
[54:55] I I I wanna I want to have beings that
[54:58] will fall down before me and adore me
[55:01] and worship me and love me. Where am I
[55:04] going to get them? SO HE LOOKS ALL
[55:07] through the myriads of angels
[55:11] and he noticed by creation
[55:14] that there was difference in degrees
[55:18] certain ones above others. So there was
[55:20] cherubams, saraphims, zooms, angels and
[55:25] different categories and he watched as
[55:29] God had put him in this position to
[55:32] stop. So he was the angel which stopped
[55:36] the approach.
[55:38] So any other angels that came before the
[55:40] throne of God, they must come through
[55:43] the door or the way Lucifer.
[55:48] So if they come up, Lucifer stopped the
[55:52] approach. Now this is part of his name
[55:54] in Ezekiel 28. Thou art the anointed
[55:58] cherub and I have set thee so.
[56:02] Oh my. But Lucifer like a lot of people
[56:06] forget who made him what he was.
[56:10] And he because of his beauty, his beauty
[56:15] excelled above the others. And he must
[56:19] have had a preeminence in nature, a
[56:23] preeminence in gifts.
[56:26] and he began to notice himself and he
[56:29] looked at himself, maybe drug out his
[56:32] Droid and his iPhone and everything he
[56:34] had, snapping selfies and this selfie
[56:37] and smiling and you know all kinds of
[56:39] things and oh, he just got stuck on
[56:42] himself.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Sounds like our modern day people, don't
[56:46] it?
[56:49] And he went over into the north
[56:52] and began to preach
[56:55] rebellion.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Rebellion
[56:59] against who? Well, there's only one
[57:01] leader there. God.
[57:05] So these angels moved under this
[57:08] influence.
[57:10] Now they lost according to what Jude
[57:13] said their habitation.
[57:16] But he never says they lost their
[57:18] anointing
[57:20] &gt;&gt; or their gifts
[57:23] &gt;&gt; or their ability to appear and
[57:27] disappear.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; They didn't even lose their ability to
[57:31] transform themselves
[57:34] as angels of God.
[57:38] So they can talk like angels of God.
[57:41] They can look like angels of God. They
[57:43] go to church. They talk about God. They
[57:47] can be so religious.
[57:50] I see why I needed things like this in
[57:52] my diary.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Our battle is not a flesh and blood.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; I need angels to help me.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody else in here with me?
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Now these angels once they change sides,
[58:11] a war started in heaven. honestly don't
[58:14] know how angels fight. I don't know what
[58:17] they fight with, but I just know that
[58:20] they fought. And the devil took by his
[58:24] tail. Now, not t a i l, but the prophet
[58:28] said t a l e, his lies, his story. So by
[58:36] his tail, he took that and started
[58:39] sweeping among these angelic beings
[58:44] which were on probation.
[58:47] I don't mind telling you tonight,
[58:49] friends, I'm glad I'm not on probation.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; If you're elect bride tonight, you ain't
[58:55] on probation to see what you're going to
[58:57] do. Papa already knows what you're going
[58:59] to do.
[59:01] Cuz if I was, I'd probably like a lot of
[59:03] others beings. You better be glad you
[59:05] ain't, too. Oh, glory to God. Brother
[59:08] Donnie, I love my free moral agency say,
[59:10] "Well, I've gotten one, but mine's
[59:12] what's got me in so much trouble most of
[59:14] my life. My ignoramus decisions and
[59:17] stuff that I've chose." I'll say amen
[59:19] for you, too, cuz all y'all guilty just
[59:21] like I am. Now, think these angels
[59:25] unlike us, they wasn't born in sin. So
[59:28] it wasn't like one day, you know, that
[59:31] they got caught in sin and you know that
[59:34] they born that way and they just
[59:35] something. No, they just right there
[59:38] clearly
[59:39] thinking about it in their minds not
[59:42] knowing exactly what what the judgment
[59:45] would be thereafter.
[59:47] But right there they made their mind up.
[59:50] I today
[59:52] am leaving God.
[59:56] I will never again
[59:59] call on his name.
[1:00:02] I make up my mind. I am going to start a
[1:00:06] being which had a beginning like I did.
[1:00:12] I'm not sure where he will take me. I'm
[1:00:15] not sure what I will become. But I am
[1:00:18] sick of God.
[1:00:20] ALL I'VE DONE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS is
[1:00:23] worshiped him and praised him and
[1:00:26] blessed his name.
[1:00:28] I want to live a little.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WOULD BE like
[1:00:37] to be under the control, the tutorship
[1:00:41] of another being.
[1:00:43] And I'd sure like to ask them now.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And how is that going for you?
[1:00:54] Now remember, there is no redemption for
[1:00:57] angels.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Once angels ever make this move, they
[1:01:04] can never get back.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; There's no blood, there's no mercy seat,
[1:01:10] there's no mercy from the heart of God
[1:01:13] to redeem angels.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] So we see when humans
[1:01:24] are touched by the power of God
[1:01:27] and father does something for them and
[1:01:31] illuminates them. And we know
[1:01:33] illumination comes in stages but
[1:01:36] illuminates them enough to know that
[1:01:37] they're lost and that there's a way out
[1:01:41] and they get saved
[1:01:43] and then they start turning loose things
[1:01:45] and letting go things. And as we looked
[1:01:48] at it last Wednesday night that for some
[1:01:51] of them the demons who inhabit their
[1:01:54] bodies
[1:01:56] actually by their own choice will leave
[1:02:00] on their own.
[1:02:04] And then if that person is under
[1:02:06] conviction and they can them demons can
[1:02:09] sense it. will leave on their own before
[1:02:12] they come to the altar, before they go
[1:02:15] to seeking prayer and seeking God.
[1:02:18] And then that gives that devil a right
[1:02:21] to go back.
[1:02:25] But if he is cast out,
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; he has no authority to come back.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless the person falls away,
[1:02:36] willfully by their choice
[1:02:41] and then they invite that devil back in
[1:02:43] by invitation.
[1:02:46] Now Jude wrote about such people and
[1:02:49] Peter does too in second Peter chapter 2
[1:02:52] verse 20. For if after they have escaped
[1:02:58] the pollutions
[1:03:00] of the world. Now look at this word
[1:03:03] pollutions. What it means the that which
[1:03:06] defiles defilement vices the foulness of
[1:03:11] which
[1:03:12] contaminates one in his dealings with
[1:03:17] the ungodly mass
[1:03:20] of mankind.
[1:03:22] So, it's totally possible then that a
[1:03:24] person could be delivered from such vile
[1:03:28] pollutions.
[1:03:30] They're actually set free. They're
[1:03:33] delivered from them. For if after they
[1:03:36] have escaped the pollutions of the
[1:03:38] world, now notice how they get this
[1:03:41] deliverance.
[1:03:43] Through the knowledge
[1:03:46] of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:03:51] You notice Peter didn't say they were
[1:03:53] born again.
[1:03:55] Peter doesn't say they got sealed.
[1:03:59] He doesn't say they got the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:02] But they were delivered from pollutions
[1:04:06] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[1:04:10] Savior Jesus Christ. Now remember, a
[1:04:14] person can be delivered of great things,
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; but knowledge of the Lord and Savior
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ will not keep your soul.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You got to be sealed, saints. Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; So he says if after they have escaped
[1:04:35] the pollutions of the world through the
[1:04:37] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ, they are entangled
[1:04:44] again.
[1:04:45] So they get delivered from these
[1:04:47] pollutions and then something happens to
[1:04:51] them along their journey. could be a
[1:04:53] week, could be six months, could be 50
[1:04:55] years, but something happens to begin to
[1:04:59] entangle them. So, it might be a vice,
[1:05:04] it might be a sin, it might be a
[1:05:06] weakness that they, you know, lean
[1:05:09] toward a certain inclination, a certain
[1:05:12] thing that that they had in their first
[1:05:15] life and it's always kind of bothered
[1:05:18] them and they've never really got
[1:05:19] totally delivered from it. And then
[1:05:21] Satan watches ad and watches at and he
[1:05:24] will set up an entanglement. Now notice
[1:05:27] the word that he uses. So it's not like
[1:05:30] that they were really walking right into
[1:05:33] it, but it was more of a trap, more of
[1:05:37] something that was there as a snare to
[1:05:40] try to entangle.
[1:05:42] And he says if they are entangled again
[1:05:46] and overcome two stages. So, a person
[1:05:50] can become entangled with something that
[1:05:54] bothered them before or something new
[1:05:57] and it doesn't mean that it will
[1:06:00] actually capture them. You and I both
[1:06:02] have seen people that they recognize
[1:06:05] something was going on, an entanglement
[1:06:08] in their life, and the spirit of God
[1:06:11] spoke to them through the word, through
[1:06:14] a ministry. Might have been a dream,
[1:06:16] might have been a tape. God has many
[1:06:17] ways to do that.
[1:06:19] And they recognize what was going on and
[1:06:23] they were able to see almost sort of
[1:06:25] like an octopus and it's, you know, its
[1:06:27] tentacles were wrapped around this arm
[1:06:29] and this leg and this arm and all of a
[1:06:32] sudden they become enlightened. Oh no.
[1:06:34] Oh no. And and instead of yielding to
[1:06:37] that, they fight with everything that's
[1:06:40] in them and they are able to pull out.
[1:06:44] AMEN.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; BUT PETER GOES ON TO SAY that if they
[1:06:47] are entangled again therein and
[1:06:52] overcome,
[1:06:54] overcome.
[1:06:55] The word overcome is to be inferior, to
[1:06:58] make less, worsted, to be conquered by
[1:07:03] one, forced to yield to one, set below.
[1:07:09] Now you see where an overcomer is just
[1:07:12] by the reverse of using this definition.
[1:07:16] An overcomer is one that is above sin,
[1:07:22] above entanglement, above this, above
[1:07:25] that. What's the entanglement for? To
[1:07:28] bring you down to its level of sin.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now notice and Peter
[1:07:36] says they are entangled again and
[1:07:40] overcome.
[1:07:42] The latter end is worse with them
[1:07:47] than the beginning. How in the world can
[1:07:50] we wind up being worse than we were when
[1:07:54] we were born lost?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; How much more worse can you get than
[1:08:00] that?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you can't.
[1:08:04] You see, being born lost is a terrible
[1:08:07] thing. All of us were born that way. But
[1:08:10] yet, there's actually a worse end than
[1:08:14] there would be a beginning of just being
[1:08:17] a lost mortal in this life. And what is
[1:08:21] it that would bring a person to this? is
[1:08:25] because they hear truths
[1:08:28] and truths, more truths, more truths,
[1:08:31] accumulative truths in their life and
[1:08:34] then all OF A SUDDEN THEY START changing
[1:08:37] and going another way and Satan will lay
[1:08:41] an entanglement for them and a tentacle
[1:08:44] will wrap around their hearing or it
[1:08:48] will wrap around their sanctification.
[1:08:50] It will wrap around their prayer life.
[1:08:53] it will wrap around this and that and
[1:08:55] the other and it's pulling on them.
[1:08:57] There's still mercy and there's still
[1:08:59] help. Just because you're entangled
[1:09:01] tonight does not mean you're overcome.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; But if you allow those entanglements to
[1:09:09] keep getting the best of you, remember
[1:09:11] what it's for. It's there to pull you
[1:09:14] down on their level. Yeah.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; "And then whenever it overcomes them and
[1:09:23] pulls them into this state where they
[1:09:27] cannot return." Now, can some people
[1:09:30] return from being in a terrible state?
[1:09:32] Of course they can. But there are some
[1:09:36] that when they go for their last time,
[1:09:40] there will never be a way back.
[1:09:44] And then they actually enter into this
[1:09:47] part of the prophecy which is a very sad
[1:09:50] one really. Uh that the latter end is
[1:09:54] worse with them than the beginning.
[1:09:58] Notice in verse 21, for it had been
[1:10:01] better for them not to have known
[1:10:07] the way of righteousness than after they
[1:10:11] have known it, to turn from the holy
[1:10:16] commandment delivered unto them.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Now, maybe I'm strange. Maybe I'm weird.
[1:10:23] I don't go around everybody that I meet.
[1:10:25] I don't carry brother Ram's tapes in my
[1:10:27] pockets and books in the trunk of my car
[1:10:30] and every mortal that I meet I hand out
[1:10:32] one. I pray about who I want to witness
[1:10:34] to
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; because I'm convinced many of us have
[1:10:38] witnessed to people and we'd been better
[1:10:40] off to left them alone.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT REALLY IN
[1:10:46] THEM, we're not careful, we're giving
[1:10:48] them one book after another, one tape
[1:10:51] after another for them to use as
[1:10:54] blasphemy against their own souls.
[1:10:59] Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Now, if I sat by people on a plane and
[1:11:02] they're sitting there, I've got my
[1:11:03] computer in my lap and they're sitting
[1:11:04] there looking at it, you know? I mean,
[1:11:06] they can read. It's a Bible program.
[1:11:08] They can read a scripture. They don't
[1:11:10] know what the message is, of course, and
[1:11:11] they're sitting there reading and
[1:11:12] they're curious. What do you do? You a
[1:11:14] businessman? No, I'm a preacher. You You
[1:11:19] can imagine the looks you get in this
[1:11:20] day and age. But depending on if they
[1:11:23] are a Christian or not a Christian and
[1:11:25] then you know I just drag out my fishing
[1:11:28] line and go to baiten it up a little bit
[1:11:30] and kind of
[1:11:33] and then what what church do you you
[1:11:36] pastor? You evangelist what you know uh
[1:11:38] yeah I'm a pastor Baptist. It's amazing
[1:11:42] to me how people just assume you're a
[1:11:43] pastor. I think do I look like a Baptist
[1:11:45] preacher? [laughter]
[1:11:48] I had somebody asked me that the other
[1:11:49] day at a place of business around said
[1:11:50] what do you do? I said, "I'm a
[1:11:51] preacher." Is that a Baptist church? I
[1:11:53] said, "No, not a Baptist."
[1:11:56] BUT YOU KNOW MYSELF, I DON'T JUST, HEY,
[1:11:59] LET ME GIVE YOU THIS BOOK. HEY, let me
[1:12:00] give this church TO YOU. YOU KNOW, GOD
[1:12:02] SENT A PROPHET. THAT PERSON MAY not even
[1:12:03] know the Lord Jesus as their savior.
[1:12:06] Let's get them saved first.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that's a lot of what we've
[1:12:10] done the message. We pull people in the
[1:12:12] message before they ever got saved,
[1:12:14] before they ever met the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:15] Preach, Brother Donnie. Come on.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You see, I DON'T WANT TO make it worse
[1:12:20] for people. I want to make it better for
[1:12:23] them if I can.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Charlie Cox told me I friends of
[1:12:30] brother Charding used to live down there
[1:12:32] about 60 miles or so from where he lived
[1:12:34] and was able to spend a lot of time with
[1:12:36] him years and years ago. And I'd ask him
[1:12:38] how it was when brother Brandham was
[1:12:40] there because Actton Campground wasn't
[1:12:43] too far from where brother Charlie lived
[1:12:44] and where the old infidel was. And
[1:12:46] they'd go out and squirrel hunt in the
[1:12:48] woods and and uh they would come out and
[1:12:51] they have squirrel blood all over them.
[1:12:52] They'd go to a little country store and
[1:12:54] old Kentucky guys sitting there
[1:12:57] whittling. Anybody know what whittling
[1:12:58] is? Some of you aren't. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:00] And what part of Kentucky you from? So
[1:13:02] they'd sat there whittling, spitting
[1:13:03] ambeer, you know, out through there.
[1:13:05] There come brother Bren of men, you
[1:13:07] know, have squirrel blood all over him
[1:13:08] and his whiskers all ged out. HE DIDN'T
[1:13:11] GO AROUND, GLORY TO GOD, YOU KNOW,
[1:13:13] ELIJAH'S ON YOUR FRONT PORCH. He never
[1:13:16] told nobody who he was. And he didn't
[1:13:18] really WANT THE BROTHERS. BUT BROTHER
[1:13:20] CHARTIS SAID IT WAS absolutely amazing
[1:13:23] when he would walk up on the porch or
[1:13:25] wherever they'd go around or grocery
[1:13:27] store, whatever it was, that there was
[1:13:29] something about that presence that
[1:13:33] people would stop what they were doing.
[1:13:35] They would stop talking, stop whittling,
[1:13:38] stop spitting or amber, whatever it was,
[1:13:40] and just look and just look that would
[1:13:43] come on their face. So to me, it's more
[1:13:47] than just our mouths running around and
[1:13:50] trying to let people know what we know.
[1:13:52] It's being led by the spirit of God.
[1:13:55] Now, I'm going to make a statement that
[1:13:56] might shock some of you, but some of
[1:13:58] those preachers who actually have come
[1:14:01] into the message and turned and went
[1:14:03] away, they would have been better off to
[1:14:06] stay Baptist.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; They would have been better off to stay
[1:14:10] Pentecostals or Methodist. At least they
[1:14:13] just been judged for what they knew
[1:14:15] then. But for some of those who have
[1:14:18] stood in message pullpits and preached
[1:14:21] this message and said they believed it
[1:14:23] and then turn and walk away from
[1:14:26] holiness and walk away from this end
[1:14:29] time message, I hope and pray there's
[1:14:31] mercy for them. Only God knows that. But
[1:14:34] I know this. If they don't turn back and
[1:14:38] repent, Amen.
[1:14:41] and make right THE BLASPHEMOUS CHARGES
[1:14:45] against God's prophet. It will be more
[1:14:48] tolerable for them all folks THAT WAS
[1:14:51] DESTROYED at Sodom than it will be for
[1:14:54] those who've sat in a message church and
[1:14:57] turned [cough]
[1:14:59] excuse me saints. WHY? BECAUSE of truth
[1:15:04] of enlightenment.
[1:15:07] Truth is so WONDERFUL AND IT'S SO
[1:15:10] AWESOME. BUT REMEMBER, every divine
[1:15:12] truth that God shares with us, it comes
[1:15:17] with a responsibility.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; A responsibility. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
[1:15:23] tonight for this truth. [cough]
[1:15:27] [clears throat]
[1:15:28] For it had been better for them not to
[1:15:31] have known the way of righteousness, and
[1:15:35] after they have known it, to turn from
[1:15:37] the holy commandment delivered unto
[1:15:39] them. But it is happened unto them
[1:15:43] according to the true proverb.
[1:15:46] The dog is turned to his own vomit again
[1:15:50] and the s that was washed
[1:15:54] to her wallowing in the mire. Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice that Peter uses
[1:16:00] two of the lowest creatures on the earth
[1:16:05] to a Jew, a dog and a hog.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And I also want you to notice that he
[1:16:15] likens them that they were a dog before
[1:16:20] and they were still a dog. IT'S NOT LIKE
[1:16:23] THAT. THEY was a dog, then they become a
[1:16:25] sheep. Then they backs and went back to
[1:16:27] being a dog.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; they was a hog and then they become a
[1:16:31] sheep and then they backed and went
[1:16:32] back. They always was a dog or they
[1:16:35] always was a hog.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I I know, friends. I
[1:16:42] know. You know, I got a strange view on
[1:16:45] things anyway, but whenever I read this,
[1:16:47] this verse brings me such encouragement
[1:16:49] because I don't find myself in this
[1:16:51] verse at all cuz I am not a dog and I
[1:16:54] sure ain't no hog. You know what I is? I
[1:16:57] was a sheep.
[1:16:59] I said I'M A SHEEP. I DIDN'T ROW IT. I
[1:17:02] DIDN'T REALIZE even before I ever got
[1:17:04] saved, but I had THAT IDENTITY WAY BACK
[1:17:08] before the foundation of the world. SO
[1:17:10] SLOP DON'T INTEREST ME. And dog vomit
[1:17:13] sure don't interest me CUZ I AIN'T NO
[1:17:15] DOG.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; COME on somebody. CAN'T YOU SEE HOW WHEN
[1:17:19] people leave away from this word and
[1:17:22] they walk away from the message of the
[1:17:24] hour and it's been so in every age that
[1:17:27] they become worse than many people who
[1:17:30] never even knew it in THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:17:32] LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVE WALKED
[1:17:34] away from the message of the hour and
[1:17:37] what they've turned into. Do you do you
[1:17:39] REALIZE EVEN SOME THAT was preachers and
[1:17:42] preached this message years ago have
[1:17:44] turned into become agnostics and
[1:17:47] infidels don't even believe there is A
[1:17:50] GOD? THEY WOULD have been better off
[1:17:53] never to have known it. Oh my. But thank
[1:17:57] God tonight there is a people who are
[1:18:00] neither dogs nor hogs. And you ain't
[1:18:03] going back to vomit cuz you never did
[1:18:05] vomit in the first place. Come on,
[1:18:07] somebody. YOU AIN'T GOING BACK TO NO
[1:18:10] WALLOWING IN THE M BECAUSE YOU AIN'T NO
[1:18:12] HOG. YOU WAS A SHEEP, BUT YOU WAS A LOST
[1:18:15] SHEEP, BUT YOU WASN'T A LOST DOG and you
[1:18:18] wasn't a lost hog. YOU WAS JUST A LOST
[1:18:21] SHEEP. SO I ASK YOU, when the prodical
[1:18:23] son was down in the pig pin, was he a
[1:18:26] dead boy or a dead pig? WAS HE A DEAD
[1:18:29] DOG or a DEAD PIG? BUT HIS FATHER SAID,
[1:18:32] "MY SON WHICH WAS DEAD is alive again."
[1:18:37] THE FATHER DID NOT SAY, "MY BOY BECOME A
[1:18:40] PIG. MY BOY BECOME a hog." OH NO. HE
[1:18:44] ALWAYS was his boy. HE LEFT THE FATHER'S
[1:18:47] HOUSE AS A BOY. HE WAS OUT OF FELLOWSHIP
[1:18:50] AS A BOY. HE WAS IN THE MUD HOLE AS A
[1:18:53] BOY. BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD, HE COME TO
[1:18:57] HIMSELF.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:19:06] [snorts] Now let us move into a another
[1:19:09] realm here. Acts chapter 16 verse 16.
[1:19:14] And it came to pass as we went to prayer
[1:19:18] a certain damsel
[1:19:21] possessed
[1:19:22] with the spirit of divination.
[1:19:27] Now listen carefully now. This is not
[1:19:31] a circus fortune teller.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; This is an individual who has become
[1:19:38] possessed by a demon power of
[1:19:41] divination. Anybody know what the word
[1:19:43] divination means? Well, I'm going to
[1:19:45] read it to you. Divination.
[1:19:48] Puthon.
[1:19:50] In Greek mythology, the name of the
[1:19:53] Pytheian serpent or dragon that dwelt in
[1:19:58] the region of Pythonus
[1:20:02] Fosius and was said to have guarded the
[1:20:05] oracle at Deli and slain by Apollo. In
[1:20:10] the Greek text, it is the spirit of the
[1:20:15] pythons.
[1:20:18] So now REMEMBER THIS LITTLE WOMAN WAS
[1:20:22] NOT WORKING at a circus as I said or
[1:20:24] some carnival and able to let me give me
[1:20:27] your palm, give me your palm and read
[1:20:29] the lines. No, this one was a real one.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; By that I mean she had submitted her
[1:20:37] soul over to the devil and a spirit of
[1:20:43] divination.
[1:20:44] So you mean demons can divine? They most
[1:20:48] certainly can.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Now Satan is not all knowing, but Satan
[1:20:55] does know certain things
[1:20:58] and he even knows certain future things.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and look at me all
[1:21:03] bugeyed. Don't you remember, brother
[1:21:05] talking about brother Richard Blair?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Richard Blair got really
[1:21:10] sick and almost died. And before that
[1:21:13] happened, brother Brennham said the
[1:21:15] devil tried to get brother Blair to deny
[1:21:19] brother Brennham and question him about
[1:21:22] some things and it was quite a struggle
[1:21:24] there in brother Richard Blair's mind
[1:21:26] and then this sickness come ON HIM AND
[1:21:29] HE ALMOST died and brother Brandon
[1:21:31] refers back to it and said Satan knew
[1:21:36] he was going to need me.
[1:21:41] Now, how did the DEVIL KNOW THAT? WELL,
[1:21:44] YOU SEE, THERE'S CERTAIN things that
[1:21:46] father will allow him to know if it's
[1:21:50] going to be beneficial to the kingdom of
[1:21:53] God. Now, he knew that THERE WOULD BE A
[1:21:56] MESSIAH. He didn't know exactly the time
[1:21:59] frame, the period because of the way
[1:22:02] that God veiled in the in the scripture,
[1:22:04] but he KNEW THERE WOULD BE. BUT NOW WHAT
[1:22:06] I FIND so amazing is right before the
[1:22:09] Lord Jesus was born here surfaces the
[1:22:15] name Yeshua.
[1:22:18] Yeshua. Of course that's that's the
[1:22:20] Hebrew word for Joshua. And that word
[1:22:24] was used for many years. Parents would
[1:22:26] name their children AFTER JOSHUA. BUT
[1:22:28] IT'S LIKE IT ENTERED into a state of low
[1:22:31] for many many years. Even in the Bible
[1:22:33] reading through it, you don't find very
[1:22:34] many after certain time frame where they
[1:22:36] named their children Yeshua or Joshua.
[1:22:40] BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE COMES THIS
[1:22:42] SURGE.
[1:22:44] Now watch even when Jesus referred to it
[1:22:47] said, "So did you think the Galileans
[1:22:49] that were killed at the tower, did you
[1:22:52] think they were GREATER SINNERS OR WHAT
[1:22:54] ABOUT THIS man that is that led this
[1:22:56] many people off? AND WHAT ABOUT THIS man
[1:22:58] that done this?" And the prophet said,
[1:22:59] "Satan always forerunning the true to
[1:23:03] mess up people's minds."
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Is it any wonder then in our age that we
[1:23:10] have the fire worshippers?
[1:23:13] Any wonder in our age that we would have
[1:23:16] all of that stuff that come from
[1:23:18] California, the blue flame worshippers
[1:23:21] and all, you know, the the Elijah's and
[1:23:23] John Alexander Dowy buried up in Zion,
[1:23:26] Illinois and a and Elijah's robe and
[1:23:29] going to start a little bit of heaven on
[1:23:30] earth for those of you that have been
[1:23:32] there and aware OF IT. WHAT WAS IT?
[1:23:34] SATAN FOR RUNNING. NOW, HE DOESN'T KNOW
[1:23:36] EXACTLY the day, the year, or the month,
[1:23:40] BUT IT'S LIKE GOD GIVES HIM A SEASON BY
[1:23:44] WHICH THE TIME THAT I'M GOING to do a
[1:23:47] certain thing, this is the season. And
[1:23:49] he can watch the move of God on the
[1:23:51] earth and see where it's at. And he's
[1:23:54] been able to read it long well enough to
[1:23:56] be able to know this is the time. I
[1:23:58] wonder with all my heart, friends, if
[1:24:01] that's why all hell is not coming
[1:24:03] against the bride of Christ like never
[1:24:06] before. Satan can hear what God's men
[1:24:09] are preaching. He can see and hear your
[1:24:12] cries of you crying for your children
[1:24:15] that are lost, that are backset. He
[1:24:17] hears your heart's cry. You want more of
[1:24:19] the Lord. Is that right? NOW, SATAN MAY
[1:24:22] NOT KNOW EXACTLY THE DAY OR THE HOUR. I
[1:24:24] don't believe he does as far as when the
[1:24:25] Lord's going to come. But he can see by
[1:24:27] the urgency and the reciprocating part
[1:24:30] on in our part from heaven. And he
[1:24:33] watches us and sees and and looks at the
[1:24:36] men of God, what they're preaching and
[1:24:37] where they are. And said, "Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[1:24:40] I I better pay attention right here. I
[1:24:41] might miss an opportunity. LISTEN WHAT
[1:24:43] GOD I KNOW THERE'S A BUNCH OF FOLKS in
[1:24:46] the message that don't believe in
[1:24:47] preachers, and it shows how dumb they
[1:24:48] are, cuz the devil sure does. As a
[1:24:51] matter of fact, the devil's kind of
[1:24:52] keeping up with the time. Not because he
[1:24:54] listens to the tapes, but because he's
[1:24:56] listened to God call and listen what
[1:24:59] they're preaching right now.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody wake up and say,
[1:25:03] "Amen."
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. SO,
[1:25:07] whenever Elizabeth and Zacharias,
[1:25:10] imagine the angel of the Lord appears to
[1:25:11] them AND SATAN'S TELLING HIS, "HEY, HEY,
[1:25:13] HEY, HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
[1:25:15] Did you HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR WHAT THAT
[1:25:17] ANGEL TOLD THEM? that that that THAT
[1:25:19] MESSENGER. HEY, HEY, WHERE IS IT? WHERE
[1:25:21] IS THAT? WHERE IS THAT? TURN OVER.
[1:25:23] Malachi 3, Isaiah 40. Oh, oh, hey, hey,
[1:25:26] hey, it's getting close. THAT THAT THEY
[1:25:29] SAID WHAT THAT ANGEL TOLD them was that
[1:25:31] he would forun that that messenger, that
[1:25:34] covenant. We better pay really close
[1:25:36] attention. GO OUT THERE AND GET THEM
[1:25:38] FALSE PROPHETS READY AND GET THEM PEOPLE
[1:25:41] FROM GALILEE and cause THIS TO RAISE UP
[1:25:43] AND THAT RAISE UP BECAUSE that scarecrow
[1:25:46] will scare them keep on whenever the
[1:25:48] real thing comes and they'll oh it's
[1:25:49] just another false prophet
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I wonder what he's telling these demons
[1:25:56] down in hell now
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; hit THEM PEOPLE WITH EVERYTHING YOU GOT
[1:26:03] TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER LIKE THEY AIN'T
[1:26:05] NEVER LOVED ONE FATHER, THEY'RE TRYING
[1:26:07] TO CLEAN UP THEIR LIVES. THEY'RE TRYING
[1:26:08] TO BE THE KIND OF PEOPLE.
[1:26:11] COULD Could the the rapture be close?
[1:26:14] COULD IT BE CLOSE? I'M FIXING TO GET THE
[1:26:16] earth cuz that's what HE WANTS. IS MY IS
[1:26:19] MY TIME THIS CLOSE? THAT'SN'T THEM GUYS.
[1:26:23] Listen to them what they're saying. Have
[1:26:25] you NOTICED THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT
[1:26:26] EMPHASIZING THIS DOCTRINE AND THIS
[1:26:28] IDEOLOGY? THEY'RE EMPHASIZING THE LOVE
[1:26:31] OF GOD AND THE STAT OF A PERFECT MAN.
[1:26:33] AND THEY'RE PREACHING, WE GOT TO GO ON
[1:26:34] AND WE GOT TO FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER AND WE
[1:26:36] GOT TO BE WHAT GOD WANTS US TO BE. OH,
[1:26:38] THAT THAT'S UNUSUAL FOR THEM MESSAGE
[1:26:40] PEOPLE. THEY FUSS AND FOUGHT FOR YEARS.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Unusual.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Listen up, devil.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It's just about home time.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:26:55] [applause]
[1:26:56] I don't KNOW THE DAY NOR THE HOUR, but I
[1:26:59] believe we are close.
[1:27:03] NOW NOTICE IN THIS woman
[1:27:06] possessed with a spirit of divination,
[1:27:11] spirit of a serpent,
[1:27:14] met us which brought her masters
[1:27:19] much gain
[1:27:21] by sooth, saying,
[1:27:25] look at the meaning of this word to act
[1:27:28] as a seer.
[1:27:31] prophet
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; deliver an oracle
[1:27:37] prophesy
[1:27:39] divine.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; So she was a diver,
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; a soothsayer.
[1:27:51] Uh she had some no doubt
[1:27:56] accurate things that were said.
[1:28:00] Now, her masters, which is plural,
[1:28:03] made a lot of money because a demon was
[1:28:08] in this girl's body.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; And she wasn't working at a carnival,
[1:28:14] but she was actually divining some
[1:28:16] things
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; and able to tell people things. Boy, I
[1:28:22] believe this is about the quietest y'all
[1:28:23] ever been since I've been here for 38
[1:28:25] years.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; SO SHE WAS
[1:28:32] a diver and a soothsayer. Now remember
[1:28:35] that's what they also called Balum in
[1:28:39] the Old Testament, a soothsayer.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; So they she met them
[1:28:49] which brought her master's much gain by
[1:28:54] soothsaying.
[1:28:56] Now remember, brother Random tells us
[1:28:58] that there was such things of course as
[1:29:00] real mediums and this is one of them.
[1:29:02] The same followed Paul and us. Now
[1:29:05] remember the book of Acts was written by
[1:29:07] Luke. So Paul and us. So it was Luke and
[1:29:12] whoever else the brothers that was with
[1:29:13] him. SO THE SAME FOLLOWED Paul and us
[1:29:18] and cried saying
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; these men are the servants
[1:29:26] of the most high God LION [screaming]
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; right
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; this DEMONPOSSESSED WOMAN
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; is using the same name of God that God
[1:29:39] revealed to Abraham Elon
[1:29:44] M
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I find this so amazing because a
[1:29:50] demon-possessed woman recognize men of
[1:29:52] God
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; quicker than church people do.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; These men are the servants
[1:30:03] OF THE MOST HIGH GOD
[1:30:07] which show unto us
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; the way of salvation.
[1:30:13] Well, if we believed in women and
[1:30:15] preachers, we'd say, "Preach it,
[1:30:16] sister."
[1:30:21] Can you imagine a woman
[1:30:24] who in her body
[1:30:27] a demon so possesses her soul
[1:30:31] that no doubt in the realm of vision
[1:30:34] which is the fourth dimension.
[1:30:36] She would be able to see things that
[1:30:38] were accurate and true.
[1:30:41] maybe even hear words and hear names
[1:30:45] that were said
[1:30:49] because remember she kept making a lot
[1:30:51] of money for these guys. Had it been
[1:30:54] guessing that throw pimmons and apples
[1:30:57] and pears and stuff at them wrote them
[1:30:58] out of town.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; But she had a lot of return customers.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Why? She's telling them some things that
[1:31:07] was exactly right. Now, it doesn't mean
[1:31:09] everything she said was true,
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; but there was some things she divined.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; THESE MEN ARE THE SERVANTS OF THE MOST
[1:31:22] HIGH GOD, WHICH SHOW UNTO us the way of
[1:31:26] salvation. And thus did she many days.
[1:31:33] But Paul being grieved
[1:31:35] turned and said,
[1:31:39] notice who he talks to.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; To the spirit.
[1:31:44] Oh yeah. HE DON'T SAY IT TO THE GIRL
[1:31:49] CUZ SHE'S NOT THE one that is doing the
[1:31:53] divining.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT HER INTELLIGENCE. A FRIEND,
[1:31:57] CAN YOU understand what I'm saying? THAT
[1:31:59] SHE HAD a supernatural intelligence that
[1:32:03] was telling her things that were right
[1:32:07] and it was a demon.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a demon-possessed person
[1:32:15] talking about y'all need to y'all need
[1:32:17] to hear these preachers? They're telling
[1:32:18] the truth. I I'm telling you what, these
[1:32:20] preachers are telling the truth. And
[1:32:21] that person was full of the devil.
[1:32:26] And yet some other people which is full
[1:32:28] of the devil called them liars and false
[1:32:29] prophets. You know why? Different devils
[1:32:32] and different bodies.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Some are called to do this. Others are
[1:32:37] called just to stir up people's minds
[1:32:39] and the rabble and all that sort of
[1:32:40] thing. And it's same it's from the same
[1:32:43] kingdom. But remember these devils can't
[1:32:45] get along with one another.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID THE DEVIL CANNOT LOVE.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. YOU IMAGINE THESE BILLIONS
[1:32:53] OF PEOPLE THAT ARE serving him. He does
[1:32:56] not love one of them.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he don't even like
[1:33:03] them.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; They will live their entire life for
[1:33:08] him, their master, which hates them.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; He wants to take them to hell with him.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He has no heaven. He has no love. He has
[1:33:22] no mercy. Has no healing.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Thank God I don't live for him.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Thank God you don't live for him.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; THEN PAUL TURNED AND SAID TO the spirit,
[1:33:36] "I command thee."
[1:33:39] Praise [laughter]
[1:33:40] God. [sighs]
[1:33:43] You think sons of God haven't moved from
[1:33:45] the Old Testament to the New?
[1:33:48] You ever remember when the angel of God
[1:33:50] stood there in the book of Zechariah
[1:33:53] and Joshua the high priest went before
[1:33:56] God and when he did there was this
[1:33:59] accuser the devil sir
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; and he stood there with spotted garments
[1:34:03] all over him
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; the angel of God come and THE LORD SAID
[1:34:08] CLOTHE HIM
[1:34:10] TAKE HIS FILTHY GARMENTS AND CLOTHE HIM
[1:34:14] IN righteousness who was it Christ. Of
[1:34:17] course,
[1:34:19] EVEN WHEN MOSES DIED and the the devil
[1:34:22] come looking for his body AND THAT ANGEL
[1:34:26] STOOD THERE, NEVER F NEVER FELL, NEVER
[1:34:29] SINNED, NEVER LIED, BUT he didn't even
[1:34:32] have the authority to rebuke the devil
[1:34:34] on his own authority, but he said, "The
[1:34:36] Lord rebuke you."
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; But here's a son of God, hallelujah,
[1:34:43] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:46] AND HE SPEAKS TO THAT DEMON OF
[1:34:48] DIVINATION
[1:34:50] and he does not say the Lord rebuke you.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; I COMMAND thee
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ to come out
[1:35:06] of her.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And he came out that same hour.
[1:35:17] So, we have a woman with a spirit of
[1:35:19] divination
[1:35:22] and we have a man with a spirit of the
[1:35:24] divine.
[1:35:27] [laughter]
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; I'll take that one any day out of the
[1:35:32] way. What about you? Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD SO LIVED IN this
[1:35:37] man's body
[1:35:39] that when he heard that voice of that
[1:35:41] anointed son of God, he got scared and
[1:35:45] left.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; And of course, they were all so happy.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; They were so proud that she was
[1:35:56] delivered and set free.
[1:36:01] And when her masters saw that the hope
[1:36:03] of their gain was gone, well, they
[1:36:06] really cared about her and her soul,
[1:36:07] didn't they?
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; They cared about her being lost and all
[1:36:10] that sort of thing. WHEN THEY SAW THAT
[1:36:12] THEIR HOPE OF THEIR GAINS WAS GONE, THEY
[1:36:15] CAUGHT Paul and Silas and drew them into
[1:36:18] the marketplace unto the rulers and
[1:36:21] brought THEM TO THE MAGISTRATE, SAYING,
[1:36:23] "These men being Jews do exceedingly
[1:36:27] trouble our city." Lie lie.
[1:36:31] They trouble their pocketbook.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. BUT THEY KNEW
[1:36:36] THAT WOULDN'T GET THESE old boys thrown
[1:36:38] in jail if they'd tell the TRUTH. SO,
[1:36:40] YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE
[1:36:42] DON'T CARE TO MAKE up lies on men of
[1:36:44] God.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; AND TEACH CUSTOMS WHICH ARE NOT LAWFUL
[1:36:49] FOR US to receive, neither to observe
[1:36:52] BEING ROMANS. OH, DUMB DEVIL AGAIN. This
[1:36:56] man that JUST CAST OUT THIS DEVIL was a
[1:36:59] Roman.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And the multitude ROSE UP TOGETHER
[1:37:05] AGAINST THEM. FICKLE MULTITUDE, the
[1:37:09] rabble.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "Amen. Our nation's
[1:37:13] full of it."
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; You could have a mutiny of saying that
[1:37:19] Humpty Dumpty is not God and there'd be
[1:37:22] some of these idiotic Americans that
[1:37:25] would follow it.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand why they've turned
[1:37:28] down God's truth? And the nation that
[1:37:30] forgets God shall be turned into hell.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Bible.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And the multitude rose up together
[1:37:40] AGAINST THEM, AND THE MAGISTRATES RENT
[1:37:43] OFF THEIR CLOTHES AND COMMANDED TO BEAT
[1:37:46] them when they had laid many stripes
[1:37:48] upon them and cast them into the prison,
[1:37:50] charging the jailer to keep them safely.
[1:37:53] Oh, how Satan
[1:37:56] seeks
[1:37:58] TO BE REVENGE ON [screaming] PAUL FOR
[1:38:02] dispossessing this demon out of this
[1:38:04] woman's body. YOU SEE, IT'S NOT JUST THE
[1:38:06] MAGISTRATES. IT'S NOT JUST THOSE PEOPLE
[1:38:09] WHO LOST IT, BUT THEM DEMONS ARE SO mad
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; because a son of God is on the EARTH TO
[1:38:17] CAST OUT DEVILS
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; and it makes them demons so aggravated.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; So they're going to raise up a
[1:38:29] persecution against them.
[1:38:32] Wow. So guess what? If we dis disrupt
[1:38:36] the devil and disturb him, we can expect
[1:38:39] him to lose his cool.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Disrupt.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And you know what IT'S GOING TO CAUSE
[1:38:45] HIM TO DO? IT'S GOING TO CAUSE HIM TO
[1:38:48] CAUSE US TROUBLE AND DISTURB US. WHY?
[1:38:51] He's getting back at us.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; He don't believe that scripture. I will
[1:38:55] repay, sayeth the Lord. But if you tear
[1:38:58] up the kingdom of hell, the kingdom of
[1:38:59] hell's GOING TO COME AT YOU. But I say,
[1:39:01] "Come on, devil. Come on, devil. If I'm
[1:39:04] ordained of God to tear up hell, I'll be
[1:39:06] able to bear the consequence. Oh,
[1:39:08] Brother Donnie, be careful. I'm I'm
[1:39:09] careful. I'm careful. All right. But I
[1:39:11] ain't going to be so careful. I'm a big
[1:39:13] coward. Come on, somebody. I believe WE
[1:39:15] ARE ORDAINED OF GOD TO CAST OUT DEVILS,
[1:39:18] TO HEAL THE SICK. AMEN. TO DRIVE DEMONS
[1:39:21] OUT OF PEOPLE'S BODIES AND SET THE
[1:39:23] CHILDREN OF GOD FREE FROM MANY OF THESE
[1:39:25] OPPRESSIVE THINGS.
[1:39:28] [applause]
[1:39:33] I warn you,
[1:39:35] such ministers
[1:39:38] THAT MAKE THE GREATEST TURMOIL FOR hell
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; will also pay a great price.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. Absolutely.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Sure they will. That's part of being who
[1:39:48] we are. AND THEY WILL GET THE GREATEST
[1:39:51] OPPOSITION, of course.
[1:39:54] BUT NOTICE then that if THE LORD JESUS
[1:39:57] KNOWING that it would come to this way
[1:40:01] upon the earth that there would BE
[1:40:04] RULERS OF DARKNESS that would come
[1:40:06] against us that he wouldn't just have
[1:40:09] preachers like Paul and men of God down
[1:40:12] through the ages but they would also
[1:40:16] have pastors and teachers and
[1:40:18] evangelists
[1:40:20] that would never be a prophet, never
[1:40:21] have a prophetic word. maybe. But
[1:40:24] they're called and anointed of God to
[1:40:27] teach the word, to live the word, to
[1:40:30] pray for God's sick sheep,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and watch the devil leave them.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; notice Acts 19:13.
[1:40:40] Then certain of the vagabond Jews,
[1:40:44] exorcist,
[1:40:45] took upon them to call over them which
[1:40:49] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[1:40:52] Jesus,
[1:40:54] saying,
[1:40:56] "We adure you
[1:40:59] by Jesus
[1:41:01] whom Paul preaches."
[1:41:06] And there were seven sons of onekea a
[1:41:09] Jew and chief of the priest which did
[1:41:13] so.
[1:41:15] Notice now AND THE EVIL SPIRIT answered
[1:41:21] and said, Jesus I know
[1:41:27] and Paul I know,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; but who are ye?
[1:41:35] They should have known right then they
[1:41:37] was in bad trouble.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; CUZ WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CAST OUT A
[1:41:42] DEVIL
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL YOU'RE TRYING TO CAST OUT
[1:41:46] DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; you're on the wrong side of the fight.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; NOW, CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT DEMONS IN HELL
[1:41:58] know God's servants
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; and God's sheep?
[1:42:05] I tell you one thing. If I ever get in a
[1:42:06] mess of trouble, that's the kind of man
[1:42:08] of God I want praying for me.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Now, think of it. THEY THOUGHT BY TAKING
[1:42:14] A secondhanded name, A SECONDHANDED
[1:42:18] EXPERIENCE. NOW, THEY were already
[1:42:21] exorcist. I'm not sure if they had any
[1:42:23] success or not, you know, but they they
[1:42:26] thought we're going to come into the
[1:42:28] message a little bit. SO, WE HEAR THESE
[1:42:31] GUYS USING the name of Jesus. The name
[1:42:32] of Jesus. the name OF JESUS. SO, WE'RE
[1:42:34] GOING to we're going to update a little
[1:42:36] bit and we're going to commend the
[1:42:37] message.
[1:42:39] So, they grab this old boy and they
[1:42:41] said, "I'll tell you what
[1:42:44] in THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:42:46] WHOM PAUL PREACHES,
[1:42:49] YOU COME OUT OF THERE." That old boy
[1:42:52] said, "Whoa,
[1:42:55] Jesus, I know. PAUL, I know, but who are
[1:43:02] you?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Well, let's see how the story ends.
[1:43:11] And the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:43:15] leaped
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; on them
[1:43:19] and overcame them and prevailed against
[1:43:23] them so that they fled out of that house
[1:43:27] naked and wounded.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Imagine these old boys didn't use the
[1:43:34] name of Jesus whom Paul preaches no
[1:43:36] more.
[1:43:37] YOU SEE, FRIEND, I DON'T WANT TO STAND
[1:43:40] UP AND TRY TO CAST OUT DEVILS IN THE
[1:43:42] NAME OF JESUS WHO BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:43:45] PREACHED.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; OH, SATAN, BROTHER BRAND, I'M ASS SURE
[1:43:52] YOU WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE. UH-UH. That
[1:43:55] ain't the way I'm going to do it. Come
[1:43:57] on. Oh, hallelujah. IF I'M GOING TO CAST
[1:44:00] OUT DEVILS, I DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHO
[1:44:02] PETER PREACHED, WHO PAUL PREACHED.
[1:44:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:07] I WANT THAT DEVIL TO KNOW ME.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT THEM DEVILS TO KNOW WHO YOU
[1:44:13] ARE. NOT DONNIE REAGAN'S GRANDDAUGHTER,
[1:44:16] NOT DONNIE REAGAN'S NEPHEW, DONNIE
[1:44:19] REAGAN'S NIECE, JD'S GRANDDAUGHTER. YOU
[1:44:22] WANT EVERY ONE OF THEM DEVILS TO KNOW,
[1:44:24] "OH, THAT'S Oh my goodness, that's
[1:44:26] that's so and so. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1:44:28] yeah. That's a young girl. Oh my
[1:44:30] goodness, that girl." You talking about
[1:44:32] tough to tangle with that little girl.
[1:44:34] Yeah, you know her name. Absolutely. I
[1:44:36] know her name. I've been assigned to her
[1:44:37] house a few times before. I've tried to
[1:44:39] afflict her with high blood, low blood,
[1:44:41] no blood. I've tried to afflict her with
[1:44:43] all kinds of things. That little old
[1:44:44] skinny things gets in there in the
[1:44:46] closet and she goes to praying and goes
[1:44:48] to crying a little bit AND GOES TO
[1:44:49] JERKING AND SHOUTING AROUND A LITTLE BIT
[1:44:51] AND TALKING IN SOME kind of tongue. I'LL
[1:44:53] TELL YOU ONE THING. I'VE RUN OUT OF THAT
[1:44:55] CLOSET WITH MY FINGERS IN MY EARS
[1:44:57] JERKING MY HAIR TRYING TO GET OUT OF
[1:44:59] HEADING BACK TO HELL AS FAST AS I CAN.
[1:45:01] THIS AIN'T JUST GOOD FOR THE PREACHER.
[1:45:03] THIS AIN'T JUST GOOD FOR THE DEACON BOY.
[1:45:06] IT'S GOOD FOR EVERY CHILD OF GOD. SO YOU
[1:45:09] CAN KNOW WHO YOU [screaming] ARE. AND
[1:45:10] NOT ONLY YOU, BUT THEY KNOW who you are.
[1:45:14] [applause]
[1:45:18] [sighs and gasps]
[1:45:20] [panting]
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:45:25] [snorts]
[1:45:26] [sighs and gasps]
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:29] [applause]
[1:45:39] So if this
[1:45:42] is what we're fighting against,
[1:45:45] what do I need
[1:45:47] in my diary chest?
[1:45:51] Theology,
[1:45:53] feelings, emotions. That's good. We
[1:45:55] believe in that. We've got We got
[1:45:56] feelings. We got emotions.
[1:45:59] But I've got to have an angelic help,
[1:46:04] an angelic influence.
[1:46:08] How could I, how could you, as a mortal,
[1:46:11] ever wrestle with a demon of divination?
[1:46:16] How could I ever wrestle with a demon of
[1:46:19] homosexuality
[1:46:20] or lust
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; or denominationalism?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; How could I ever do it?
[1:46:29] I could and I don't have to.
[1:46:34] How could I wrestle with disease and
[1:46:36] sickness in my body and in yours?
[1:46:40] Unless, as the prophet said, may the
[1:46:43] healing angel of God
[1:46:46] who stands on this platform,
[1:46:49] may he come and minister to you tonight.
[1:46:53] You see, that's exactly what it was at
[1:46:56] the pool of Saleom.
[1:46:59] God sent down an angel of healing.
[1:47:03] Now, he might could fight wars and he
[1:47:05] might could do different things, but in
[1:47:06] that particular role, he was a healing
[1:47:09] angel.
[1:47:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:14] They're the ones that travel around from
[1:47:16] community to community
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; looking up your address and bringing
[1:47:20] your healing to you.
[1:47:24] Why? There's demons of sickness, demons
[1:47:28] of disease. Remember the prophet
[1:47:30] whenever he by vision in that fourth
[1:47:32] dimension would see those demons and the
[1:47:34] faces and the looks and you know he he
[1:47:37] described certain cancers as being like
[1:47:39] a crab and certain ones that be what he
[1:47:41] he's seeing that that's exactly what
[1:47:43] he's seeing. Remember years ago I said
[1:47:46] it was still over the old church and the
[1:47:49] prophet used the word one time only that
[1:47:51] I found and the word was oimous.
[1:47:58] Oimus.
[1:48:02] It been a long time since I'd remembered
[1:48:05] running across that. So when I went home
[1:48:07] after service, I I thought I'm going to
[1:48:10] Google that and see what in the world is
[1:48:13] there anything out there like that.
[1:48:16] Oh, I found something. All right.
[1:48:20] A creature was red and eyes and
[1:48:23] horrible.
[1:48:27] Can you imagine way back during the 50s
[1:48:30] before that name was even being used
[1:48:32] yet,
[1:48:34] God already had his prophet to call it
[1:48:36] by name.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; We need this message
[1:48:43] to equip us.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; For what's around us every day.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, it's greater
[1:48:52] than you.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; It's greater than me.
[1:48:59] But with him in us, we'll crest every
[1:49:03] wave.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:49:10] As great as angels are,
[1:49:13] yet
[1:49:15] the prophet said the prayer from a child
[1:49:17] of God will go a million miles higher
[1:49:24] than from an angel.
[1:49:27] The angels can only come
[1:49:30] and help you find your position,
[1:49:33] but they can't act in your place.
[1:49:38] Think of it. Us flawed, imperfect human
[1:49:42] beings. And God sends holy
[1:49:45] angelic beings to nurture us and help us
[1:49:52] into being the queen of heaven.
[1:49:58] And one day when it's all said and done
[1:50:01] and the prophet said that the angels
[1:50:03] will circle the earth,
[1:50:06] imagine myriads of them around the
[1:50:09] earth.
[1:50:11] And he said they'll be standing there
[1:50:12] with their heads bowed
[1:50:15] cuz we're singing songs of redemption
[1:50:19] and they're looking at you
[1:50:22] and honoring you.
[1:50:25] Imagine by the end of his ministry in
[1:50:27] 1965 the church age book was just being
[1:50:30] completed and done.
[1:50:32] By then he said the gates
[1:50:35] had already been hung. Remember the new
[1:50:38] city was not created before Jesus came
[1:50:40] down.
[1:50:42] Jesus said I go away to prepare a place
[1:50:46] for you.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; So he's creator of the new heaven and
[1:50:52] high priest at the same time. very busy
[1:50:55] fell, isn't he?
[1:50:58] So, he's been there for over 2,000 years
[1:51:02] creating this new city.
[1:51:05] The gates one gigantic pearl, the walls
[1:51:07] 216 ft tall, all these beautiful things
[1:51:11] that are there. Cuz remember, the devil
[1:51:13] will never set one foot inside that
[1:51:16] city.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; He's trumped all over heaven, but he
[1:51:19] ain't tromping around our new house,
[1:51:21] right? [laughter]
[1:51:26] And he said, "The angels of God are
[1:51:29] waiting breathlessly
[1:51:33] for you."
[1:51:35] Can you imagine?
[1:51:38] Angels of God
[1:51:40] waiting for us.
[1:51:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:47] Don't you love him tonight, children?
[1:51:52] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:51:57] If there's anyone of you here tonight
[1:51:59] that's
[1:52:01] entangled
[1:52:05] or you've got things in your life that
[1:52:09] you need the Lord to help you to get it
[1:52:12] straightened out.
[1:52:16] I believe his presence is here
[1:52:19] and he's here to help us.
[1:52:24] We've seen him do so much.
[1:52:27] We'll be here three years
[1:52:31] in February.
[1:52:34] We have seen him do so much in three
[1:52:36] years. It would be a sin for us to
[1:52:39] disbelieve.
[1:52:42] Much less all the things he did for us
[1:52:44] at the other place.
[1:52:47] So whatever you have need of tonight,
[1:52:51] he's here. It's not that you're great
[1:52:53] and I'm great. Ain't none of us great at
[1:52:55] all. It's him who's the great one. But
[1:52:59] we are commissioned by him.
[1:53:04] Hallelujah.
[1:53:08] Let's just bow our heads together.
[1:53:12] Not only our heads, of course, but our
[1:53:14] hearts. And I want you to just think
[1:53:15] now. Is there anything that the Lord
[1:53:18] brings to your heart that you need to
[1:53:22] fix, that you need to take care of?
[1:53:25] If there is, just raise your hand there
[1:53:27] before the Lord. You don't have to speak
[1:53:29] it out. Lord, you you know, Lord, you
[1:53:31] know, I I need this. I need to take care
[1:53:34] of that.
[1:53:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:42] Heavenly Father,
[1:53:46] we know they're here right now.
[1:53:50] The prophet likened it
[1:53:54] this way when he said, "The angels of
[1:53:56] God are here." They're waving those
[1:53:58] white flags and those demons
[1:54:01] are here waving their black flags.
[1:54:05] They're both pulling
[1:54:09] and a battle is sitting in a [snorts]
[1:54:10] ray.
[1:54:13] And he said the battle will go according
[1:54:16] to our faith.
[1:54:20] So it doesn't go because of the will of
[1:54:22] angels of God. Neither can it go because
[1:54:26] of the will of demons.
[1:54:28] It goes by the way we want it to go.
[1:54:34] So if we want victory, we want healing,
[1:54:38] we need the Holy Ghost, whatever it is,
[1:54:40] Father, that that we're in need of
[1:54:42] tonight,
[1:54:45] if our hearts can become one with that
[1:54:47] word
[1:54:49] and your logos
[1:54:52] can become a Rama word.
[1:54:55] And if you can drop it in our hearts
[1:54:58] right now, Lord Jesus
[1:55:02] by his stripes
[1:55:04] ye are healed.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; We quote it and quote it and quote it
[1:55:09] and we know, Lord, we know we're quoting
[1:55:12] Logos. And that's what we're supposed to
[1:55:14] do and we'll continue to do it. But oh,
[1:55:18] when the spirit of God will take that
[1:55:20] same word
[1:55:22] and it's no longer us saying it, but
[1:55:25] it's you saying it
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; and that becomes a Rama word, which is a
[1:55:31] word with a living voice.
[1:55:36] Satan can quote the logos,
[1:55:40] but he's never yet been able to tap into
[1:55:42] the Rama
[1:55:44] because he don't have access to the
[1:55:46] living voice.
[1:55:48] But we're children and we do. Lord,
[1:55:52] there's people here tonight with needs
[1:55:54] in their bodies, in their homes, in
[1:55:56] their lives. They're children.
[1:55:59] Maybe a companion that's away, children
[1:56:02] that's backslid.
[1:56:04] Father, we just believe you tonight that
[1:56:06] you'll help them.
[1:56:09] I pray for my dear wife, Lord, at home
[1:56:12] tonight, unable to be here.
[1:56:16] In the name of Jesus, may the spirit of
[1:56:19] God go to her. I know she's streaming
[1:56:21] the service right now. May the angel of
[1:56:24] God beat me home. Hallelujah.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, I pray for now. I
[1:56:31] pray for the others. Lord, I didn't hear
[1:56:33] the prayer request, but I know of others
[1:56:35] that are sick and suffering and in need.
[1:56:37] Dear God, in the name of Jesus, may the
[1:56:41] angels of God go to your children
[1:56:44] tonight. Father,
[1:56:46] bring healing, bring deliverance,
[1:56:50] Father. Brother Jimmy and I laid our
[1:56:52] hands on Brother Dao. Lord, he brought
[1:56:55] me his prayer cost before church and his
[1:56:57] feet was just hurting him so bad. Dear
[1:57:00] God, we join together as a church body
[1:57:03] tonight for our brother. Lord, he comes
[1:57:06] and gives service after service, stands
[1:57:09] and up on his feets, the deacon, and
[1:57:12] Lord trying to serve your people. May
[1:57:14] the angel of God go back to brother Dao
[1:57:17] tonight, Father, in the name of Jesus.
[1:57:21] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:25] We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[1:57:28] May oppression,
[1:57:31] may
[1:57:33] may sadness,
[1:57:36] hallelujah,
[1:57:37] may it leave the children of God right
[1:57:40] now in the name of Jesus.
[1:57:43] You demons of darkness that try to rob
[1:57:46] us as God's children, we're tired of you
[1:57:50] robbing us.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Peace is ours.
[1:57:55] Joy unspeakable and full of glory is
[1:57:58] ours.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:02] Thank you, Lord Jesus. We claim it
[1:58:04] tonight, Father.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Would you minister tonight, Lord, to
[1:58:08] your children?
[1:58:10] We worship you, Lord God.
[1:58:13] Thank you, Father.
[1:58:15] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:58:19] Can we worship him just a little bit?
[1:58:20] Why don't you lift your hands now for
[1:58:22] whatever for whatever you have need of
[1:58:26] and just claim it right now as your own.
[1:58:29] It's my inheritance.
[1:58:31] Peace, healing, my son, my daughter, my
[1:58:35] husband, my wife. I don't know where I'm
[1:58:38] going to get my house payment next
[1:58:39] month, my car payment, but he's my God.
[1:58:43] And he said in his word, I wish above
[1:58:45] all things that thou mayest prosper and
[1:58:46] be in health even as thy soul prospers.
[1:58:49] Psalms 37 and4, delight thyself also in
[1:58:52] the Lord, and he'll give thee the
[1:58:54] desires of thine heart.
[1:58:56] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. If ye abide
[1:59:00] in me and my words abide in you, ask
[1:59:02] what you will and it shall be done.
[1:59:06] Amen. Is that yours, friends?
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just
[1:59:11] worship him together. Now, remember your
[1:59:13] worship, your praise is the water on the
[1:59:18] promise.
[1:59:20] Maybe some of you wondering why when you
[1:59:22] leave church and you claim something and
[1:59:25] the seed don't ever come up. It could be
[1:59:28] the amount of water that you're putting
[1:59:30] on it. And if you just give about 2
[1:59:32] minutes, you're at the end of the
[1:59:34] service. And then you don't do it going
[1:59:36] home,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; And you don't give it do it in the
[1:59:39] morning when you get up.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; And when you pray over your breakfast
[1:59:42] and when you pray over your lunch, you
[1:59:44] need to stop watering that seed of
[1:59:46] healing.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; It's God's word. It cannot lie.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Remember that's what Abraham done every
[1:59:52] day. The prophet said he watered that
[1:59:54] promise.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Every day was praise.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Let's just love him together. I know
[2:00:04] some of you got small children. If you
[2:00:05] need to go home, that's all right. But
[2:00:07] for those of you that can, let's just
[2:00:09] stay and worship him right now.
[2:00:12] [music]
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's just forget about
[2:00:16] what you got to do tomorrow. Now,
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; the journey you got to make back home. I
[2:00:20] know some of you driven over an hour or
[2:00:22] so. [music]
[2:00:23] You got that journey in front of you.
[2:00:26] [singing]
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; But let's just think about him. [music]
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Think about how much he loves us and how

[2:11:37] and ask brother Joel to bless us with
[2:11:40] that song.
[2:11:42] Heavenly Father, we
[2:11:44] have been blessed to be in your sacred
[2:11:47] courts tonight of your presence.
[2:11:50] We want you to know we don't take it for
[2:11:52] granted.
[2:11:54] Dear God, we're asking you, Lord, that
[2:11:56] you just go with each of us. Keep us by
[2:11:59] your grace, Father. We pray, Lord. Maybe
[2:12:03] some of them didn't feel like they got
[2:12:04] anything tonight, but maybe by tomorrow
[2:12:07] evening or early Friday morning, they'll
[2:12:09] notice that little pain that was in that
[2:12:12] back.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; It ain't there no more.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That grally voice is feeling better. And
[2:12:18] that strength that seemed to be
[2:12:19] depleted,
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; oh, they're feeling so much better.
[2:12:23] We believe them angels of God are still
[2:12:27] still visiting the communities of the
[2:12:29] saints of God. We believe it, Lord. Go
[2:12:32] with us now, Father. We plan on coming
[2:12:35] back here for church on Sunday, Lord
[2:12:37] willing. And we're expecting you to come
[2:12:39] and meet with us again in a mighty way.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; We love you so much, Jesus.
[2:12:45] Grant, Father, in Jesus name.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:13:37] Tell them [music and singing] for me,
[2:13:39] I'm going up yonder. How about you?
[2:13:44] I'm going [music] up yonder.
[2:13:49] I'm going up yonder
[2:13:53] to [music and singing] be with my Lord.
[2:13:59] I'm [music] going up yonder.
[2:14:04] I'm going up yonder.

[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Now I can take the pain. [singing]
[2:14:24] There's heartache that life brings.
[2:14:28] I have comfort in knowing
[2:14:32] [music and singing]
[2:14:32] I'll soon bid this old world goodbye.
[2:14:38] [music]
[2:14:39] As God gives me grace, [singing] you
[2:14:42] know what I'm going to do? I'm going to
[2:14:44] run this Christian race
[2:14:49] until [music] I see my savior.
[2:14:52] Till I see him face [music] to face.
[2:14:59] I'm going [music] up yonder.
[2:15:02] Amen.
[2:15:04] I'm going up yonder.
[2:15:09] I'm going up yonder [singing]
[2:15:12] to be with [music] my Lord.
[2:15:19] I'm going up yonder. Amen. [music]
[2:15:24] I'm going up yonder.
[2:15:29] I'm going up yonder [music]
[2:15:32] to be with [singing] my Lord. Just sing
[2:15:35] it as you go.
[2:15:38] Now I can take the [music] pain. God
[2:15:41] bless you.
[2:15:44] The heartache that life brings.
[2:15:46] [singing]
[2:15:48] [music] I have comfort in knowing one
[2:15:51] day I'm going to put on wings and fly
[2:15:56] [singing] away. [music]
[2:15:58] As God gives me grace,
[2:16:03] I'll look that old [music] devil in
[2:16:05] [singing] the face
[2:16:08] and say to him,
[2:16:11] "You will be no more
[2:16:17] because I've been [music] changed from
[2:16:20] here to there.
[2:16:23] I've got glory deep inside myself. I'll
[2:16:28] [music] proclaim my Savior for ever
[2:16:33] more.
[2:16:38] I'm going [music] in the rapture. Amen.
[2:16:43] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:16:48] I'm going in the [music] rapture.
[2:16:52] Goodbye bye bye bye bye
[2:16:55] [music and singing] bye world.
[2:16:58] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:17:03] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:17:08] I'm going [music] in the rapture
[2:17:12] to be with [singing] my Lord.
[2:17:16] I can take [music] the pain. I can take
[2:17:19] the pain.
[2:17:23] The [music]
[2:17:38] Heat. Heat.
[2:17:42] [music]
[2:17:45] Heat.
[2:17:50] [music]
[2:17:57] Heat. [music]
[2:18:06] Heat.
