[31:20] under babies not when their hive grown
[31:24] little man any let's bow our heads
[31:29] together
[31:31] Heavenly Father the joy that's in my
[31:34] brother and sisters heart today
[31:36] I'm sure it's beyond what they can even
[31:38] explain to be able to look down at a
[31:43] little boy or a little girl
[31:45] see the mixture of their DNA and their
[31:48] chromosomes and truly it's a miracle how
[31:52] our nation so many many years ago fall
[31:54] into such a place where they would
[31:56] legalize killing such little gifts from
[31:59] God we're grateful for men and women who
[32:02] still desire to bring children into the
[32:05] earth to assume the awesome
[32:07] responsibility of trying to love them
[32:10] nurtured and raised them we thank your
[32:13] father for our brother and sister we
[32:16] pray the Spirit of God would help them
[32:17] give them wisdom Lord give them strength
[32:20] to be able to know how to raise the
[32:21] little son to be able to teach him in
[32:24] the admonition of God maybe so so
[32:28] familiar with the sounds of prayer in
[32:30] their home made a music of the gospel be
[32:34] able to be something that he's raised
[32:36] from just a little guy of hearing may
[32:39] the Word of God be implanted so in his
[32:42] heart the enemy gets old enough to be
[32:44] able to make the choice of right from
[32:46] wrong the impression upon his little
[32:49] mind will be so great
[32:51] there'll be no question which way he
[32:52] will go your prophet tells us Lord of
[32:55] some boys brothers many of them that was
[32:58] raised in a home oldest one went to be a
[33:00] sailor second and so on and so on and so
[33:03] on
[33:03] they would begin to question and wonder
[33:06] what it was that imprinted upon their
[33:08] little lives and went back and found out
[33:11] that it was a picture of a boat in the
[33:14] bedroom where they were all raised and
[33:15] it's so imprinted something on their
[33:18] hearts
[33:18] if a picture can do that what about the
[33:21] love of God father we bring into you
[33:24] today
[33:24] dedicated a life to you for a life of
[33:27] service we thank you for God keep him
[33:30] from the evils of the day the diseases
[33:32] and sicknesses that are so rampant
[33:34] father in Jesus name we pray amen
[33:48] notice brother West was ready clapping
[33:50] loud there he may was we believe our
[34:02] children are part of our heritage as the
[34:06] people of God of who we are it's a great
[34:10] great privilege to be able to bring
[34:12] children into the Earth's and then to
[34:13] assume the responsibility to raise them
[34:15] and teach them she's so sad that our our
[34:19] society and our civilization has become
[34:21] so self-centered that millions of babies
[34:25] being aborted it's a one day our nation
[34:29] as well as the nations of the world will
[34:30] stand before God an answer for all that
[34:33] they've done when you look at it some
[34:36] animals have more love for their young
[34:39] then people do you ever look at a
[34:44] chimpanzee or an ape or a silverback
[34:48] those males that are in charge of their
[34:50] family will fight to the death to
[34:53] protect a wee baby and some human beings
[34:57] are so beneath animals they will give
[35:01] their babies away we hear about it all
[35:04] the time being dropped in a garbage
[35:05] disposal woman give birth to a baby and
[35:08] target and walk off and leave it men
[35:11] women walk off and leave their babies do
[35:13] you understand where we are people are
[35:17] lower than monkeys apes when I told my
[35:22] comparing a human to another human we're
[35:24] talking about our society our world is
[35:27] lower than animals take the Spirit of
[35:31] God off of a human being they are worse
[35:34] than a chimpanzee
[35:37] worse than an ape that's why I thank God
[35:42] for parents that want to raise their
[35:44] kids most of time whenever I dedicate
[35:47] these babies I'm dedicating her mom and
[35:49] dad along with them you can have a sad
[35:50] song it was really it's something that
[35:53] little baby didn't come with a manual he
[35:55] didn't come with a book or a CD on how
[35:57] to a man god bless you let's read
[36:01] together today Song of Solomon chapter 7
[36:04] verse 11 will read through verses 13

[36:12] presence of the Lord come my beloved let
[36:16] us go forth into the field let us Lodge

[37:07] years ago may we not be forgetful
[37:09] hearers may not only just acknowledge
[37:12] that it's right and acknowledge that
[37:14] it's true but father made to be
[37:16] something that will correspond in our
[37:18] souls that will help us to want to live
[37:20] it as we look into the great things that
[37:22] lay before us today I pray that you
[37:24] would anoint us Lord may we move for
[37:27] just a few moments as it were beyond
[37:28] time may we leave this building may our
[37:32] thoughts being raptured in the presence
[37:34] of God or what great things lay in front
[37:36] of us our future is definitely clear how
[37:40] thankful we are Lord be with us today
[37:41] speak to us once again we ask
[37:43] the name of the Lord Jesus the Saint
[37:46] said God bless you you may be seated
[37:49] mm-hmm for those of you that wasn't with
[37:51] us last night we were looking at some of
[37:54] the purposes of God fulfilling the
[37:56] millennium and the cause of the
[37:58] millennium of what he wants to fulfill
[38:00] and the word the first one that we
[38:04] looked just a background for just a
[38:05] little bit the first one that we looked
[38:07] at it is the transition from time and to
[38:09] eternity the transition from the age
[38:12] that we currently live in into the
[38:15] eighth day the age of perfection and
[38:17] states of perfection also God will
[38:20] finalize and complete the Abrahamic
[38:23] covenant that was made to Abraham that
[38:25] the children of Israel will be able to
[38:27] have this land and he along with them
[38:29] also the Palestinian covenant which was
[38:32] the Covenant made with God and the
[38:34] people to the land of Palestine and we
[38:37] looked at it and showing that God's
[38:39] promises though they may linger yet God
[38:42] is obligated to his own character to
[38:44] fulfill that word then thousands and
[38:47] thousands of years since God told
[38:49] Abraham that he and his seed would be
[38:51] heir to the land yet to this very day a
[38:54] stone under the horn just a little bit
[38:55] ago there's walls and things built
[38:58] around Israel as we was there in May and
[39:00] seeing the minarets which is a sign of
[39:02] an Arab community they have it divided
[39:05] into three basic categories and groups
[39:07] and you got Arabs over here which is
[39:09] they have their autonomy their own
[39:10] autonomy to make their own laws and all
[39:13] those sorts of things and Israelis not
[39:15] even allowed in there and yet that land
[39:17] belongs to them how is it that you've
[39:20] got these these Palestinian Authority
[39:23] and you've got you know all the people
[39:25] of the world saying you can do this and
[39:27] you can't do that and you cannot
[39:29] according to the promise of God God gave
[39:31] it to Abraham what caused it their sin
[39:33] it's the same way with us God gives us
[39:35] the righteous Christians to be all these
[39:37] things that he wants just to be but when
[39:39] we allow sin to come in our life and the
[39:41] devil tells us what we can and will and
[39:43] cannot do but we realize that God is
[39:46] going to restore our lands as he's going
[39:48] to restore the Land of Israel and it's
[39:51] the promise of God so we'd like to pick
[39:53] up on that this morning and and be able
[39:56] to look at there
[39:57] another covenant that God made it is
[40:00] called the Davidic covenant now this is
[40:02] beyond of course the Adamic covenant
[40:03] this is beyond the covenant given to
[40:06] Abraham it goes along with it but yet
[40:08] it's more complimentary it's more
[40:10] catered to one man and his his lineage
[40:14] then it would be the nation itself now
[40:17] God shows of course Abraham being a
[40:19] Gentile and God calls him out makes him
[40:22] a great covenant promise then God goes
[40:24] inside of that lineage and divides it
[40:27] and he makes the Levites even more
[40:29] called out than the Land of Israel
[40:31] itself and then God can break it down on
[40:34] an individual basis to where that God
[40:36] picks certain individuals to do certain
[40:38] things above the nation and that's what
[40:41] he done to David so God was not just
[40:43] making a man that he would be able to be
[40:46] a king for forty years which was the
[40:48] ideal span of time that God would let a
[40:50] man be a king and the natural sense but
[40:53] God was also making a future Kingdom
[40:56] he's going to make the Davidic covenant
[40:59] by which God will make certain promises
[41:02] to David and David's line alone which
[41:05] will not apply to the rest of the
[41:07] children of Israel you believe God can
[41:09] do that God can call certain individuals
[41:12] it can make them preachers pastors
[41:13] prophets he can make them whatever he
[41:14] wants to make them and God can give them
[41:17] above their brethren God can give them
[41:19] more things than their brethren the rest
[41:21] of the brethren should be able to accept
[41:23] that but many times of course they don't
[41:25] but God chose David he was of course the
[41:27] wee one the one that everybody else
[41:30] thought mild oh never never ever
[41:31] happened to him as a matter of fact
[41:33] whenever the Prophet comes and he calls
[41:35] for Jesse to bring his sons in he don't
[41:38] even remember David well that's greatly
[41:39] to be loved and thought about by your
[41:41] daddy in it that when daddy calls in all
[41:44] the brothers you're the only one they
[41:45] forget so they just kind of leave you
[41:47] out there where you belong because
[41:49] you're kind of an odd head anyway so
[41:50] they leave you out there by yourself
[41:52] you're a little bit fanatical you're
[41:54] quite musical and most musical people
[41:56] can be kind of highly emotional and so
[41:58] on so they leave him out there because
[42:00] he shouts and jumps around and place the
[42:02] harp and everything so they thought he
[42:04] might you know really interrupt this
[42:07] saying no he wasn't gonna interrupt it
[42:09] as a matter of fact he was the reason
[42:11] the Prophet was there so let it be known
[42:14] to you and I today we're not going to
[42:16] interrupt heaven were one of the reasons
[42:18] that heaven is made I'm one of the
[42:20] reasons that there is a rapture so I'm
[42:23] not going to be an interruption to the
[42:24] rapture so God calls David now we'll
[42:28] read this if you would in second Samuel
[42:30] Chapter 7 verse 8 and this is identified
[42:33] and called the Davidic covenant now
[42:35] therefore so shalt thou say unto my
[42:38] servant David thus saith the Lord of
[42:41] hosts I took thee from the sheep coat
[42:44] from following the Sheep to be ruler
[42:47] over my people over Israel
[42:50] I was with see whether so ever thou
[42:53] wentest
[42:54] and have cut off all thine enemies out
[42:57] of thy sight and have made a great name
[43:01] like unto the name of the great men that
[43:04] are in the earth now notice this is not
[43:07] inclusive with all of Israel this is the
[43:11] Davidic covenant that is hidden inside
[43:14] the Abrahamic covenant also hid inside
[43:18] the Palestinian covenant you understand
[43:21] now God is going to make a special
[43:23] covenant with this man which is separate
[43:26] but inclusive with the Abrahamic
[43:29] covenant notice in verse 10 moreover I
[43:32] will appoint a place for my people
[43:34] Israel and we will plant them now notice
[43:37] David is in the land of Palestine in the
[43:41] land of Israel whenever the prophet of
[43:43] God is going to say these words to him
[43:46] but yet God's saying it as if though
[43:49] this is a future event that God is going
[43:53] to appoint a place for my people Israel
[43:56] and will plant them that they may dwell
[44:00] in a place of their own and move
[44:04] no more now notice this is important it
[44:07] is key when we understand the tense of
[44:10] God's word that God says things in
[44:13] present tense God will say them in past
[44:15] tense and God will say them in future
[44:18] tense now here they are present tense
[44:20] they're living in the land David of
[44:22] course has his capital in Jerusalem and
[44:25] the land of Israel is prospering during
[44:27] very well never entered actually into
[44:30] the full boundary from the River Nile
[44:31] over to the Euphrates but quite a quite
[44:34] a large possession of land but yet God
[44:37] is saying they will move no more wise
[44:39] God saying this because God is speaking
[44:42] prophetically and putting the tense of
[44:45] the word they've got a lot of moves
[44:47] before this portion of the word will
[44:49] come to pass now this will coincide with
[44:52] the Abrahamic covenant that God will
[44:55] give it to them and they will never move
[44:57] it will also coincide with a Palestinian
[44:59] covenant that they will never have to
[45:02] move again but so far it seems as if
[45:05] though they're in a great peaceful time
[45:07] and they'll move no more neither shall
[45:09] the children of wickedness which
[45:12] included the Philistines they amirite
[45:15] the Jews the poles ALS and all those
[45:19] that are born of Abraham are not the
[45:21] seed of Abraham all Jews are not elect
[45:26] Jews will persecute the 144,000 that's
[45:32] right
[45:32] Jews will persecute the hundred and
[45:35] forty-four thousand just like so-called
[45:37] message people were persecuted the bride
[45:40] because they're not the same thing
[45:42] notice that God puts them all in one
[45:45] category and he says the children of
[45:47] wickedness will afflict them no more as
[45:51] before time now friends honest so we can
[45:53] all say that this scripture has not been
[45:56] fulfilled as of yet because the children
[45:59] of Israel are still under great
[46:00] oppression from all different points
[46:02] around the world even though they're not
[46:04] all gathered in in Jerusalem or in the
[46:06] land of Palestine
[46:07] we know that it will finally wind up
[46:09] with all the nations of the earth
[46:10] gathering together and the battle which
[46:13] is in the valley of Megiddo which is
[46:15] called Armageddon and there of course
[46:17] Christ will come down and fight for them
[46:19] notice he says in verse 11 and there
[46:22] since the time that I commended judges
[46:24] to be over my people Israel have calls
[46:27] thee to rest from all thine enemies the
[46:30] Lord tell us see that he will make thee
[46:33] on a house now a house it's not what we
[46:36] would think that God's gonna build him a
[46:38] structure but a house was something that
[46:40] God would give them a heritage which was
[46:43] a name and a reputation and a character
[46:46] which would actually outlive their
[46:49] natural posterity on the earth so
[46:51] David's gonna live to be 70 something
[46:52] years old and he will die but God said
[46:55] I'm going to build you a house
[46:57] which will not die when you die in other
[47:00] words your name and your posterity and
[47:03] your identification will live much
[47:05] longer than you ever live because I'm
[47:09] gonna build you a house and when thy
[47:11] days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep
[47:14] with I fathers I will set up thy seed
[47:17] after thee which shall proceed out of
[47:20] thy bowels and remember scripture can
[47:22] have a compound meaning and we're going
[47:23] to read a portion here that does out of
[47:25] thy bowels and I will establish his
[47:27] kingdom I notice speaking of the son of
[47:30] David in the spiritual sense but also of
[47:32] Solomon in the natural sense he shall
[47:35] build a house for my name and I will
[47:37] establish the throne of his kingdom for
[47:40] ever but of course we know that didn't
[47:42] happen to Solomon because it was
[47:44] actually taken away from him because of
[47:46] his unbelief now here the watch how God
[47:49] does this in his slides in the Messianic
[47:50] kingdom of Christ and then he reverts
[47:53] back to the Solomonic Kingdom in verse
[47:55] 14 I will be his father and he shall be
[47:58] my son if he commits iniquity which
[48:00] couldn't apply to the Lord Jesus since
[48:02] he never done that I will chasten him
[48:04] with the rod of men and with the stripes
[48:07] of the children of men but my mercy
[48:10] listen to scripture how profound but my
[48:13] she shall not depart away from him as I
[48:17] took it from Saul whom I put away before
[48:21] thee now freely tell you something you
[48:24] talking about something the same God who
[48:26] offers us mercy can also take it away
[48:29] and I don't care how much you beg how
[48:32] much you scream and how much you holler
[48:33] for it if God takes it you're done so am
[48:37] I so the nation so we see then it was
[48:40] God who gave the Mersenne you saw but
[48:42] notice they call Solomon is going to be
[48:46] a part and a beneficiary of the Davidic
[48:49] covenant God tells him and God knows
[48:51] that Solomon will get away but God tells
[48:53] him even before Solomon ever rings if he
[48:56] ever gets away from me I will treat him
[49:00] because of you I will treat him
[49:03] different than the way I treated Sol
[49:06] because whenever he messes up I will
[49:09] treat him with a rod of Correction I
[49:12] will use Kings I will use people I will
[49:14] use all these things and I will not I
[49:17] promise you David I will not cut off
[49:21] your son well if God could make that
[49:25] promise today that how much more can God
[49:27] the spirit make that promise to the body
[49:30] Jesus and say I will never cut off your
[49:34] seed this is why you're secure today my
[49:38] friends are because of our faithfulness
[49:40] not because we're so good why I feel one
[49:43] for the mercy of God nobody no telling
[49:45] where we'll all be this morning that's
[49:48] right notice undyne house and thy
[49:50] kingdom shall be established for ever
[49:52] and before it see notice now it's not
[49:56] just going to be established forever but
[49:58] it will be established forever before
[50:00] thee speaking of a time that David will
[50:04] be in existence and the word forever of
[50:06] the Hebrew of course says nu on which is
[50:08] a space of time but your kingdom will be
[50:10] so established
[50:12] that the years and the generations will
[50:14] pass and you will see it which could not
[50:17] come to pass when he was a mere mortal
[50:19] but it will come to pass my score of
[50:22] five notice again in Psalms eighty-nine
[50:27] three I have made a covenant with my
[50:31] chosen I love this word chosen look at
[50:37] it the Hebrew word book here choice one
[50:39] chosen one elect of God nobody asked you
[50:44] some do you reckon the early apostolic
[50:45] church was Free Will Baptist you got
[50:48] come there in the Apostolic Church had
[50:50] any problem with predestination and
[50:52] election and for ordination you reckon I
[50:55] mean then Ben shoes and coming with this
[50:57] background of election you imagine what
[50:59] some of the Apostolic preachers how they
[51:01] would hear some of the message preachers
[51:03] preach predestination and they say you
[51:05] boys don't even know nothing about first
[51:07] peace you imagine them struggling with
[51:10] free moral agency and imagine them
[51:13] really having a hard time trying to
[51:15] understand predestination not at all
[51:17] predestination election foreknowledge
[51:20] sovereignty of God was a common teaching
[51:23] among the Apostolic believers as it will
[51:26] be among the restored Apostolic
[51:29] believers in the last day only the free
[51:33] will Baptists among also struggle with
[51:35] it not a purse Allah believers because
[51:37] it's a foundation of who they were they
[51:40] believed they were the chosen people can
[51:43] you imagine any are the Apostolic
[51:45] Christians Jews solving how we're
[51:47] struggling believe in the election they
[51:50] would have never had such a struggle why
[51:52] the whole basis of who they were was
[51:55] based upon God's choice not theirs
[51:59] [Music]
[52:01] well i'ma just go ahead and say it some
[52:03] of you may not like it but I wonder how
[52:05] many apostolic sermons were ever
[52:07] preached entitled free moral agency
[52:10] show me one New Testament sermon that
[52:13] was ever preached or they ever quoted
[52:15] says it wasn't even written to a
[52:18] powerless dead
[52:21] jesus saying in the book of Revelation
[52:23] whosoever will let him come show me one
[52:25] place in your Bible what they ever stood
[52:28] up and preached it what did they preach
[52:30] though elect according to the
[52:32] foreknowledge of God and the
[52:34] sanctification of the Spirit and belief
[52:37] of the truth that's what they believed
[52:39] oh my goodness how nor if I get all fat
[52:44] it's you need that or you notice how
[52:47] Psalms 89 for thy seed will I establish
[52:51] forever and build up dice wrong to all
[52:56] generations Salah verse 34 my covenant
[53:02] well I'm not break nor alter the saying
[53:05] that is gone out of my lips once ever
[53:07] sworn by my holiness that I will not lie
[53:11] unto David his seed shall endure forever
[53:14] and his throne wow this is part of the
[53:24] Davidic covenant love friends it's not
[53:27] yet happened but it well
[53:32] here's Sloane as the Sun before me
[53:38] notice I'm Sadie 937 and shall be
[53:40] established forever as the moon and ice
[53:44] of faithful witness in heaven Salah
[53:47] Salah was a musical cannon tation kind
[53:49] of like a pause or turn around as would
[53:51] call it in the music I remember this was
[53:53] a song it must have been really
[53:55] something that David was singing about
[53:56] himself and said 1:30 to 11 or Psalms
[54:02] whether the Lord has sworn in truth
[54:05] under David he will not turn from it of
[54:09] the fruit of thy body will set upon thy
[54:16] throne I don't care what the pol says
[54:23] PLO I don't care what Arabs say I don't
[54:26] care what the English say I don't care
[54:28] what Trump says or Obama says or nobody
[54:31] else said this is why God says the Land
[54:36] of Israel belongs to the children of the
[54:38] Israel and they're fixin to take it over
[54:41] not only them but we are too now I am
[54:46] currently a resident of Tennessee in the
[54:49] United States of America but before long
[54:52] I'm changing my residents praise be to

[55:31] how many's movin Westmead lord chenna if
[55:43] we could get our eyes on the promises
[55:45] the promises and realize how close they
[55:48] are how these things out here would fade
[55:52] nor lose hosea hosea chapter 3 verse 5
[55:56] is he says afterward shall the children
[55:59] of Israel return and seek the Lord their
[56:02] God and David their keep they'll seek
[56:15] the Lord their God and they'll be saying
[56:20] or David David's gotta be here somewhere
[56:30] thank you and shall fear the Lord and
[56:36] His goodness when in the latter days
[56:42] before time fades out and the last
[56:46] thousand year increment is finished it
[56:49] blends into eternity Luke 1:31 behold
[56:55] thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[56:57] bring forth a son and shall call his
[57:01] name Jesus
[57:03] they are xuan he shall be great and
[57:07] shall be called the son of the highest
[57:11] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[57:15] throne of his father David
[57:22] so David his father but yet he's David's
[57:25] father
[57:27] this is a father-son relationship
[57:30] glory to God and the Lord God shall give
[57:34] unto him the throne of his father David
[57:37] and he shall reign over the house of
[57:41] Jacob forever and of his kingdom there

[58:41] to seven Church ages and glorified
[58:43] bodies and that will be millions of
[58:46] human beings living on the earth and
[58:49] natural and glorified bodies do you
[58:52] understand that will be a resurrection
[58:55] that will call them out out the graves
[58:57] and glorified bodies and that will be a
[59:00] resurrection of the heathen in non
[59:05] glorified bodies you said you mean God
[59:13] can cause a man to get up from the dead
[59:15] and not have a glorified body why don't
[59:17] you ask Lazarus
[59:20] why don't you ask the little maid he
[59:23] called her from the dead and she
[59:25] real-life Cecilia for how many every
[59:28] years and died after his resurrection
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:42] now let us move from here let's move to
[59:45] the Book of Daniel Daniel sees the
[59:48] coronation of King Jesus praise God you
[59:59] and I are so excited about the rapture
[1:00:01] under such anticipation
[1:00:04] can you imagine King Jesus he has been
[1:00:09] waiting now for 2,000 years he's been a
[1:00:11] victor he's been a vector to be able to
[1:00:16] redeem his people from sin but he's been

[1:24:55] this but you see because you're done
[1:24:59] what you've done look at all this wife
[1:25:01] I've got there
[1:25:04] and then look at all this group that's
[1:25:06] living outside to see the Animus that's
[1:25:08] what I call the whosoever lugar I've got
[1:25:10] all them too and if I don't only call
[1:25:13] those out of the book of life Adam that
[1:25:15] they'd never been here because they
[1:25:16] wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life don't
[1:25:19] beat yourself down I took your mistakes
[1:25:21] and I was able to turn it around Adam
[1:25:23] you're forgiven Lord Shiva if you'd I
[1:25:33] could look at it today some of you still
[1:25:34] living under the guilt of your stand
[1:25:36] you're staying in your past and you're
[1:25:38] standing you that Satan condemned you
[1:25:39] day in and day out you all will be able
[1:25:41] to stand by the grace of God 930 years
[1:25:46] of seeing such stuff and say I am
[1:25:48] forgiven
[1:25:49] I don't know how an innocent lamb could
[1:25:52] be able to be taken in by poison
[1:25:54] Almighty God forgive me for that but I
[1:25:56] have to accept it I can see him he's 900
[1:26:07] in 30th year he's already got old now
[1:26:11] which I reckon you would it down 130 he
[1:26:19] got up that morning you've said you okay
[1:26:25] thank you I've been thinking a lot about
[1:26:33] don't home Adam no no don't you go
[1:26:40] talking me like this I stand over the
[1:26:46] other day just sharing some of the
[1:26:49] brothers what it was locked back here if
[1:26:55] I got so sick Adam don't please don't
[1:27:01] leave me you've been my shield I'll
[1:27:10] protect you
[1:27:12] not a man whatever never all travelled
[1:27:16] me in the guard never let me be burnt
[1:27:20] but you forfeited your king
[1:27:25] don't make me oh maybe he just
[1:27:32] something's kind of passing but it's
[1:27:36] some pass when I imagine one day when he
[1:27:40] was sitting in a coffee shop there was
[1:27:43] this young guy come here you see know
[1:27:47] this crown of people gathered around
[1:27:49] this old man he knew who was cause he
[1:27:51] heard his name was he knock oh look at
[1:28:04] the chronology even though Abraham
[1:28:08] disappears out the pages of the Bible
[1:28:10] and the light of God changes from
[1:28:11] Abraham to Isaac Abraham is still alive
[1:28:17] when Isaac fades off the scene steps out
[1:28:20] of the pages of the Bible and the focus
[1:28:22] comes on Jacob Isaac is still alive you
[1:28:30] imagine this young guy little bitty ol
[1:28:32] guy
[1:28:32] and hears about these stories of these
[1:28:36] dinosaurs we're home in the paradise of
[1:28:39] God and they say brother Adam words are
[1:28:43] telling us that want to get about how he
[1:28:46] used to come down Merida
[1:28:52] put you all to sleep at night but I've
[1:28:56] told that one over and over again but
[1:28:58] please would you tell it just once more
[1:29:01] well it was it was the most wonderful
[1:29:03] thing I'm telling you what it was just
[1:29:08] well medieval II would just stay on the
[1:29:12] earth that day and I'd move trees and
[1:29:15] the former furniture that's why yes
[1:29:20] Adams do it today and and then in the
[1:29:25] evening I'd say even sweet heart it's
[1:29:27] time for us to go up to the big
[1:29:28] Cathedral to worship God and directly
[1:29:32] would hear it and I'd look over the
[1:29:44] bushes and others that yellowish green
[1:29:46] light and I'd heard that voice children
[1:29:51] have you enjoyed your stay on earth
[1:29:54] today we couldn't be afraid but it was a
[1:29:57] holy reference it was on all but we
[1:30:00] wasn't afraid and would say oh yes Papa
[1:30:02] said I've come down to kiss you good
[1:30:06] night Lily knocks him over they're gone
[1:30:13] Gordon God I want to know God that so
[1:30:23] what did he do
[1:30:25] I'll never forget his own cell he he had
[1:30:29] taken lay me down there in the garden or
[1:30:31] some branches and leaves everything was
[1:30:33] so comfortable and he laid me down he
[1:30:36] take my arm and he'd stretch my arm out
[1:30:38] like that and I remembered just like it
[1:30:40] was yesterday
[1:30:40] he laid my arm out and then he'd take a
[1:30:43] Eve and he'd lay her down in her hair
[1:30:45] and you know put her hair account over
[1:30:46] my arm that way and then he'd reach over
[1:30:48] you see you'd reach over and kissing me
[1:31:01] children what makes you feel funny
[1:31:09] who's your preacher top because you've
[1:31:13] never been able to have that yet but it
[1:31:20] ain't gonna be long your Lord Jesus
[1:31:21] ain't gonna lay out your husband's arm
[1:31:23] but he's going to come walking down the
[1:31:25] length of that table thousands of miles
[1:31:27] off and take his a garment he'll reach
[1:31:32] up and say JD oh crap you'll be able to
[1:31:38] take your hands and grab ahold here's
[1:31:39] her arm and just pull him over close to
[1:31:42] you God and I can't do that
[1:31:45] got a consuming fire can't do it but
[1:31:47] this is God your more faith in his
[1:31:50] sonship you imagine living on the earth
[1:32:01] in the Millennium but every day the
[1:32:08] natural Kings on the earth will set up
[1:32:10] the government their school's their
[1:32:12] education I've said it several times I
[1:32:15] know but I'm gonna keep on sin until I
[1:32:16] get off of it every school will be a
[1:32:18] Bible School you'll be born under the
[1:32:25] knowledge of God but the heathen won't
[1:32:27] be they will be talked about the Lord
[1:32:33] who do you figure in this building knows
[1:32:35] me the very best today my daughter's
[1:32:39] know me well my son in-laws know me you
[1:32:43] brothers at work with me know me but who
[1:32:45] do you reckon knows me the best of all
[1:32:48] the people in this church today of all
[1:32:51] my friends around the world
[1:32:53] who do you figure knows me the best you
[1:32:55] know who it is
[1:32:56] it's that little woman sitting right
[1:32:57] there
[1:32:59] and I don't want to brag but I just want
[1:33:02] to be flat honestly that there ain't
[1:33:03] nobody that knows Jesus like his
[1:33:07] precious 144,000 they've got a great
[1:33:11] wonderful relationship the kings of the
[1:33:13] earth will have a great wonderful
[1:33:15] relationship but brother Louie who knows
[1:33:17] about his grace who knows about his
[1:33:19] mercy who knows about his compassion his
[1:33:22] forgiveness like the elect let us close
[1:33:32] so in retrospect excuse me as I go
[1:33:35] backwards what a great thing it must
[1:33:40] have been when the volcano said cool
[1:33:42] down the tsunamis from the oceans had
[1:33:47] all lain flat the black rich dirt from
[1:33:52] the heart of the earth
[1:33:53] had now covered it the seeds which have
[1:33:58] been spoken by his word started to
[1:34:00] sprout and the waters were washed off
[1:34:03] and gathered the great expanse of the
[1:34:05] waters was gathered up in the expanse of
[1:34:07] what is called the heavens and then a
[1:34:10] great majority of it went down to the
[1:34:12] earth reserved for flood time and the
[1:34:15] reservoirs in the earth and the dawn of
[1:34:20] that seventh morning God makes his son
[1:34:24] and his wife then God says I'm going to
[1:34:29] rest now the great dinosaurs coming
[1:34:34] through the paradise of God the great
[1:34:37] birds with wingspans of who knows how
[1:34:39] big landing on Adam's shoulders a
[1:34:44] beautiful paradise but Adam's sin put
[1:34:51] that dawn of the seventh morning on
[1:34:54] pause so you're listening to a sermon
[1:34:57] from brother Branham or your favorite
[1:34:59] preacher whoever it is someone calls you
[1:35:01] on the phone and you pause to do what
[1:35:06] later resumed
[1:35:08] right so Adam reached over by free moral
[1:35:13] agency so what free moral agency is good
[1:35:15] for reached over and touch the button
[1:35:21] Paul's he did not have access to stop
[1:35:27] neither did the devil so all of a sudden
[1:35:35] the seventh morning paused the dinosaur
[1:35:41] started looking at each other different
[1:35:43] the wharf which had laid by the lamb and
[1:35:46] the little kid and they were friends and
[1:35:49] frolicked and not only his little ones
[1:35:51] but his mature ones all of a sudden
[1:35:54] their digestive tract changed the earth
[1:35:57] tilted on its axis I'm fast-forwarding
[1:35:59] much of this of course the foliage in
[1:36:03] the leaves changed the barometric
[1:36:05] pressure and the earth become more
[1:36:07] volatile above which it could change and
[1:36:10] allow seasons to come on the Earth's
[1:36:13] great cataclysmic changes started moving
[1:36:17] on the globe of the earth Wow the
[1:36:22] seventh morning was paused so what is
[1:36:26] the Millennium the finger of the second
[1:36:30] atom
[1:36:33] reaches over resume
[1:36:42] we will walk out on the ashes of the
[1:36:48] wicked and when we do we'll look at what
[1:36:54] used to be Arizona for those of you I
[1:36:57] think we have some here today from
[1:36:58] Arizona and they walk out say wow this
[1:37:02] ain't Phoenix wait we have to bring our
[1:37:06] water from the Colorado River
[1:37:08] there's foliage everywhere there's
[1:37:11] leaves everywhere
[1:37:13] do you understand there's places in
[1:37:16] South America that have had not one inch
[1:37:20] of rain in over a hundred years the
[1:37:27] driest place on earth
[1:37:30] no rain since records have been kept but
[1:37:36] I saw that the other day and I said hold
[1:37:39] on rains coming
[1:37:43] because when the re IGN takes place our
[1:37:47] aian will follow your so maybe barren
[1:37:55] and dry today but if you can get the
[1:37:57] King to rain rain will fall oh I wish we
[1:38:15] could leave today
[1:38:17] I don't mind telling you sermons I guess
[1:38:20] it's hard on me I tell my physical and
[1:38:22] tell them it's a strain and all the
[1:38:24] study you go into it I'm just told man
[1:38:25] it's hard to come out from underneath
[1:38:27] this and walk out in the middle of hell
[1:38:29] again how can we ever be the same
[1:38:34] sitting at the table of our Lord I'm
[1:38:36] glad we don't have to wait actually to
[1:38:38] save this table I think we're at it now
[1:38:39] but you love him children don't you want
[1:38:44] to be there more than anything else this
[1:38:47] world God oh brother Donny you want to
[1:38:51] be a king you want to be a ruler
[1:38:53] I don't want to be nothing except just
[1:38:56] there if me and Carol live in the
[1:39:00] farthest place out if I'm the last house
[1:39:05] on the last row of the last run out in
[1:39:08] the middle of the Bering Strait if
[1:39:10] there's any bearing or straight left to
[1:39:13] be there will be wonderful to me I don't
[1:39:19] deserve to sit at his table I don't
[1:39:22] deserve to sit with you all how in the
[1:39:25] world would I ever compare to a man like
[1:39:29] David Abraham Isaac brother branham
[1:39:33] Luther Wesley or the mercy but if I can
[1:39:38] just be that
[1:39:41] praise God
[1:39:43] well I want me a mansion right next door
[1:39:45] to Jesus with that attitude I'm not sure
[1:39:47] you'll even be around if you think
[1:39:50] you're that special there's something
[1:39:51] wrong you need an adjustment grace helps
[1:39:55] us to realize none of us deserve it
[1:39:58] but it's what God Himself gave to us
[1:40:01] before the foundation of the world your
[1:40:11] Lord Jesus what can we say after such
[1:40:16] things or I believe it father I believe
[1:40:22] it's true Lord how how we need your help
[1:40:28] so bad to be able to live your word we
[1:40:32] don't want to just talk about it discuss
[1:40:33] it we don't want to debate and argue it
[1:40:36] we want to live here father be the kind
[1:40:40] of Christians as your word says that
[1:40:42] you're not ashamed to call them brethren
[1:40:46] that's what I want the majority of my
[1:40:50] life has done gone I've not been a great
[1:40:53] person and never will be I know that I
[1:40:55] don't have the makeup to be a great
[1:40:57] person but if I'm a saved person a
[1:41:01] person who is for him Oh Lord Jesus help
[1:41:05] me I don't have much that I could bring
[1:41:08] to you today all I have is me I'm not
[1:41:12] smart not intellectual don't have great
[1:41:16] wealth don't have a business Lord if you
[1:41:20] asked me for a million dollars I there's
[1:41:22] no way in the world if you ask me for
[1:41:24] way less than that there's no way I
[1:41:26] could give it to you if you asked me for
[1:41:29] our great personality I couldn't give
[1:41:31] you that either you asked me for a great
[1:41:33] mintage of a great family No so really
[1:41:38] I've very little that I could offer but
[1:41:43] I remember reading in the Bible one day
[1:41:45] that there was a little boy who skipped
[1:41:48] school his mama packed his lunch for him
[1:41:51] and told him to Guam school and bid good
[1:41:53] boy but somehow another that day you
[1:41:56] blessed a boy in his truancy he missed
[1:42:00] school but he attended one of Jesus
[1:42:02] means jesus told His disciples set set
[1:42:08] the people down and feed him they said
[1:42:10] Lord we ain't got enough so they go
[1:42:15] search around city by God anything that
[1:42:17] a boy said well I'm supposed to be in
[1:42:19] school I was going to eat just for lunch
[1:42:21] but I don't really what it could do but
[1:42:25] I'll give it to Jesus so they come back
[1:42:33] to Jesus and say Lord we've got this
[1:42:35] little boy's lunch Jesus looked at it
[1:42:39] it's enough or do you want my lunch got
[1:42:44] my breakfast and then are you what do
[1:42:47] you want if you get me you get all that
[1:42:51] if I keep it to myself I'll mess myself
[1:42:55] up on I'll ever run into life but if I
[1:42:58] can give it to you today Lord may each
[1:43:02] of us me and women boys girls maybe be
[1:43:06] able to give our all to you Lord we want
[1:43:11] to be there so bad Lord Jesus Lord I sit
[1:43:15] and stare you on this thing I just go to
[1:43:16] pining for heaven so bad I just get so
[1:43:20] homesick it makes me feel sad and heavy
[1:43:24] but then I'm saying what about this
[1:43:27] sister she's not where she needs to be
[1:43:29] what about this brother they're not
[1:43:31] where they need to be oh god bring the
[1:43:34] children is so we can go home father
[1:43:39] help us today Lord how many of you was
[1:43:43] me today would like to give Jesus your
[1:43:46] lunch is it work your mind your heart
[1:43:48] your hands your ability amen
[1:43:53] although we just want to commit it to
[1:43:55] you now we love in all of our hearts
[1:43:59] thank you Lord Jesus as we enter into
[1:44:02] this time father of Christmas time or
[1:44:04] had so commercialized
[1:44:06] and taken away from the spiritual aspect
[1:44:08] of it yet we know the Prophet preached a
[1:44:10] Christmas sermon every year talked about
[1:44:12] it so much every year so itself had a
[1:44:14] sacredness in his heart I think it can
[1:44:17] for us as well even he would wish the
[1:44:19] people Merry Christmas in' they would
[1:44:21] buy him a suit new suit every year so he
[1:44:24] held an element of it in respect and
[1:44:26] honor so weak today Lord Jesus we want
[1:44:31] that Christmas gift the one the first
[1:44:34] the only the original Christmas gift
[1:44:37] Jesus Christ not wrapped with pretty red
[1:44:41] bows and ribbons Santa Claus paper but
[1:44:45] the attribute of God wrapped in human
[1:44:48] flesh and when he come forth from Mary's
[1:44:52] womb and took the breath of life for the
[1:44:55] first time God breathed he who made
[1:45:02] breath he who made life took life the
[1:45:07] word breathed thank you Father
[1:45:11] you become that gift that we could be
[1:45:15] forgiven
[1:45:15] we as Adam of old accept that innocent
[1:45:19] lamb I don't understand how it all works
[1:45:22] but I know one thing it's your program
[1:45:25] and if you accept it I accept it if you
[1:45:28] say you'll accept the Lord Jesus in my
[1:45:30] place I will accept that atonement
