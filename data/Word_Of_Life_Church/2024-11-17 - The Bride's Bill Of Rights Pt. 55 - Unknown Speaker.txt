what a people we would be um got a baby dedication this morning brother Israel and sister Martha bringing the little girl little baby Genesis to dedicator to the Lord today know Genesis is the book of Beginnings I'm not sure if this is the beginning of a big family or exactly bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of s bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to [Music] Jesus now you think that ain't something look at that really got she's checking you all out let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father what a great honor it is Lord to be able to stand in this last days and to still see mothers and fathers that desire to carry out part of their responsibility on the earth Lord we know that in our nation women's rights and women's control over their bodies and so on as they say it's been so devastating but we're so grateful dear Jesus little Genesis as my brother Israel laid her in my arms and now Lord I want to bring her up to your arms you're the one who gave her to them I pray father that you just helps them we know it's not just really a dedication of a baby but a consecration of mother and father that they can be able to accept the awesome responsibility that You' placed in their hands she never come with a manual from the hospital she never come with a how-to book from the doctors but we're so grateful you've given us one it's your word a how-to book to raise children and we're thankful that it carries right on out to this last day so father we bring a little Genesis to you today we ask you Lord that you just watch over her little life help her mother help her father keep her from the evils and sickness and diseases that are so prevalent in the day that we live we dedicate our little life to you today Father for a life of service in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen praise the lord conratulations we stand today and we'll turn to the Book of Genesis no kidding Genesis praise the Lord is an awesome day to be a Christian serving the lord living for him today praise God Genesis chapter 1 verse 14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years now s Moses covers the big scope of everything first and then he breaks it down in a few more verses here let there be lights in the firmament which is the expanse of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs look at the meaning of this word signal a distinguishing Mark Banner token ins sign or also a standard so the lights in the heavens are going to be for a token or a sign or a standard Manor standard is something that that is used to measure other things by and for seasons and for days and years now look at verse 15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth H so the Earth is going to be the focus of a lot of what God is doing yet by far not the biggest not the brightest but his choice and you see that's what makes all the difference so the Earth is the only one whose name is in the Book of Life you won't find Mars Pluto Saturn Neptune Uranus now the rest of those planets and all those that have been found now but Earth to give light upon Earth and it was so now watch him there breaks it down in categories and God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day which is what we know is the sun and the Lesser light which is the Moon to rule the night he made the Stars also I get overwhelmed every time I look at this word and I click on it look what it is it's kokab which is of Messiah Brothers of Messiah Brothers numerous progeny personification God's omn missence which is figurative of course God made the two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also Genesis is overwhelming really because it condenses unbelievable amount of things that was happening and it sounded like it was just Bam Bam Bam but in this this little verse and he made the Stars also quite simple quite Compact and yet the estimated number of stars and the visible universe so far that have been seen one septian that's a one with 21 zeros behind it and God made the Stars so far over two trillion galaxies that they found two trillion galaxies and what was your problem s that was so big today that you thought just no way and think who made this your father thank you Lord makes me feel ashamed sometimes don't it you I great he is and listen how Moses says in verse 17 and God set them God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth notice again he mentions the Earth again to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good Genesis 2 verse 1 thus the heavens and the Earth were finished would you notice how that Moses puts the Earth in a different category from the heavens the heavens and the Earth the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them which is saal that which Goes Forth an army an army war Warfare host a host of an organized Army over one septian in the army of God and you realize not a one of them has ever caused him one problem in my little short life brother Phillip of 68 years I have caused him more heartache more trouble than trillions of galaxies and yet I can give him something that all of those Stars cannot they cannot love him they serve his purpose but they're made to do so what difference between me and them and and you is I choose to do so they were made to do so we choose to do so and many he has a need in your heart today a request Heavenly Father we are so humbled at your greatness I pray today father that your blessings would be upon the word that should help me to be able to get out of the way Lord I'm not here today to belittle what your children are going through because they're many of them suffering tremendous things facing terrible battles and things in their lives but yet Lord if I could somehow be able to show them maybe just a little bit greater of what you are I think it would help them to bring it all into perspective that no matter how big our problems are how big our issues are and our troubles you are so much greater than them all father I have this prayer cost in my hand today Lord you see our sister Lord that this is going to you see the problems that she's having in her body and we're agreeing together as the saints of God lord Jesus that she's going to be completely delivered and made well of this anoint me Lord and anoint your people speak to us the words of life in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak to you today on the right to be in divine order the right to be in divine order let's look now about our father and how great he is some people the way they view God they resent anything about order and structure and things that are put together it's like some people view order as Robin them of a element of their freedom they look at structure they look at things put together and it running on a methodical pattern and they look at that as if somehow it takes away from the great Supernatural or the phenomenon but yet our God is a god of structure and God of order so he doesn't just make things and let them run as they will he doesn't choose any of us and says well just do whatever you want to do try try to get to heaven as best you can um just live as close as you can to me and whenever it's all said and done whatever you give me I'll take and U I have no requirements I have no no guidelines no set standards just do whatever you think is best now a lot of people have that that idea of God that they will do whatever they think they can and they'll wind up giving it to God and God is just so desperate God is so desperate for anybody that will just give him any attention at all that he'll just pretty much take whatever they give him that's not my God our God is is a god of divine order that being said it does not mean that in that order is not freedom and liberality but it never goes beyond the guidelines of the one who set it up so he structured a church he structured a body he structured the order of ministry he structured it in the Old Testament knowing that it would have a time limit on it that it would run for several thousand years and then there would be a new order that would replace it and we know even where we are now the order of grace mercy through the perpetuation of the blood of the Lamb of God that is a great divine order of God holy wonderful order but it too is only here for the SE season for one day we will no longer need blood between us and our father we couldn't stand to be able to be brought into his courts today in his presence without the value of a mediator there's no way we we would just die there's no way we can do it because our bodies are still marked by sin and we still bear mortality in us today so there's got to be something that will stand between us but I want you to think now for those saints of God that have gone beyond the curtain of time they no longer have that barrier that you and I are limited by today called Fai one day you will no longer need faith faith will actually be become sight and it will become reality now today we believe there is a God right so all that come to him must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him but for those who have already entered into paradise and into his great presence they don't have to have a faith walk because they've already passed beyond the curtain of time and they have experienced reality in a form that you and I know absolutely nothing about so Fai will end in sight and then the Blood On The Mercy Seat will no longer be there as a matter of fact when the bride goes up in the Rapture it will be pulled from there it's only symbolic anyway but it will be pulled from there and no longer be needed to go between you and I in the presence of our Lord and for the first time in the Rapture will be able to walk up in the face of Jesus himself and look at him with our changed eyes touch him with our changed hands and himm reached back to us because this order that God has given us will have brought us to a higher place and we know that there was a levitical order in the old test but a prophecy of a new order in the new and it was going to be a priesthood after the order of MDC right so God will have a new order of a priesthood just to let you know we're already in it so whenever God before he ever brought human life upon the Earth and then Moses being channeled by God to to pull into this Avenue wherever he was whenever he started seeing all these things and he looked out across what scientists call the elliptical plane now remember on the earth since the Earth is placed in this certain part of the universe everything looks different from the earth than it would from any other planet now for those of you that have traveled in different parts of the world and you would look at the Zodiac here and then you would look at the Zodiac in Europe or if you've been to New Zealand or Australia and you look at it and the stars and their patterns they will look a little bit different for those of you that are privileged to be able to see the Northern Lights in Canada or in in Norway and some of those places like that and you see how different that the stars and the placement of the stars look according to where you're standing on earth now remember they are there for signs for season for days to divide the light from the darkness and all that so depending on where you are on the earth and you look up and see the exact same Stars you might see them in a little different way having been out in Arizona and some of the places and the parts of the Earth where there isn't as much population and light pollution it's amazing how many stars are there right in our our skies every night but we don't see them because we have so much light pollution now whenever God wrote them of course and put them there because they were his first Bible there was no light upon the Earth so the brighter the light gets upon the Earth the more it takes away from the glory and the Brilliance that's in the heavens so some of the greatest telescopes that man has upon the Earth are in some of these places where there isn't any man-made denomination I I mean uh man-made light because man-made light will distract from Heavenly light you see that's what always gets people in trouble when it comes to them looking at the word and trying to understand the word because they're looking at it from The Grandfather's light or their father or their mother or their uncle or their aunt and they're always reading the divine order through tradition or church entity and it always hinders us every time now let me let me just go back here to Genesis 1:16 again and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament now let me share these numbers with you again estimate suggests that there are about one septian stars in the universe and I said it was 21 zeros but it's actually 24 so a one and 24 zeros and an estimated estimated two trillion galaxies now by the way that scientists have been able to measure what they call the observable universe now that is only what they've been able to to see them they use gamma rays and they use other X-rays and things like that and they will send them out as far as that Ray can travel and then it will turn and come back and they measure the distance from where it leaves its original point back and then they time it how far it is now watch this the observable universe is approximately 93 billion ion light years in diameter 93 billion light years in Diamond now listen how big in a lightyear is if you forgot it since you went to school a lightyear the distance light can travel in one Earth's year is 5.88 trillion miles so in one year light will travel 5.88 trillion miles and so far the observable universe is 93 billion light years so you take 93 billion and multiply it by 5.88 trillion and you're going to blow your calculator all two pieces now that's just what they found so far I find it so amazing that they found all this out in our day sir in our day you see they started they looked at the stars way on back and they looked at him in a very primitive form but in this day the mysteries of the universe and the stars and all that they found so far it's just incredible because it's unfolded in the same time frame that God sent an Angelic message down from heaven and a releasing of an anointing from Heaven on the earth to take a people back to their origin which is in heaven so while God is doing this great thing on the Earth and then science always forer runs what God is doing on the earth is that right so we live in the age of astronauts astronauts so then they send out their their Hubble and then once they got it out there they didn't realize that the Hubble Tes scope had to have something similar to glasses put on it because it was unable to focus and do what they needed it to do and then they had to send some people out there to readjust its lenses and they likened it to putting a set of glasses on the telescope and by that in the last how many every years that it's been there it's opened up an entire new realm and what they were able to do and they thought they could never surpass that until of course they made the new one and now they've sent it out there and it's blowing away the previous Church ages before it now remember the signs are there for Stars the Stars rather for signs and tokens and visible say of God writing his Bible so if it's going on up there and the observable universe and remember it's still expanding now when life travels it's still ongoing it's not like that it's ever actually stopped when he said let there be light it has never stopped from the time he said that so if time would car another 100 years or 200 years and they would break into it more and more and they would measured as a matter of fact they've already proved it by the scientific research from back in 1959 to where we are now that from the measurable difference of the on the elliptical plane and by using what's this the radius of the visible universe according to calculations the current comoving distance to particles from which the cosmic microwave background and you saw you just use them in your house the microwave background radiation was emitted which represents the radius of the visible universe is about 14.0 billion parex 45.7 billion light years everybody got what I've said so far I was going to say those of you who raise your hand I'm going to have you to stand and repeat it now what does this mean to most of us absolutely nothing do this sister is going to help you make better pancakes I doubt it better beans and cornbread and maters and ters no but hopefully it will overwhelm you to realize how great our God is and to think that nothing moves up there out of cater the only thing that has ever caused him problems are those beings that he put on free moral agency you see all these things that I've read to you so far today not a one of them have a soul not a one of them have a choice a mind to reason and think well I I don't think that makes sense I I don't think God wants that I don't think they can't think they were made to do all this great glory and he hasn't had one problem with one of them none of them have ever caused him any issues let's read Hebrews 1 one God who had sunry times and diverse manner spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world's plural the world's plural and man Einstein broke into what understanding he had in his day and believe it or not they've surpassed Einstein Hebrews 11:3 and when he looked at where that broke into eternity if they could send something out so far from the earth and measure it by time and how many millions of light years it would be out in the universe and then come back to the Earth it would only be gone just a few years and Einstein said there's only one answer for that they broke into eternity and when they ask him how could it be he said there was one only one explanation through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God Amen worlds not one plural the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so all this matter and mass and black holes and time and all of that where did it come from nowhere where'd God get the Magnesium the iron the atomic fire that's in the Sun every day that and we're setting on a molten ball of it upon the Earth where did all that come from the Sun s so n yeah for by him God created all things what was the son the word so when God spoke he gave birth and out of his existence come his creative word which is the son s o n and by him all things were created a brother Ram is on a hunting trip greatest battle ever fall tells us about it and him and the brothers was looking up at the night skies and I imagine being out there in Arizona I've hunted some of that same territory there and it's quite phenomenal when you get out there and you go to looking up uh what what you see and he said I I said somewhere now he's talking to the brothers I had pointed out to me one time in an observatory the Zodiac beginning with the Virgin coming over through the cancer age on down until the last was the lion Leo the Lion the first coming of Christ the Virgin the second coming by the line of the tribe of Judah and I said I tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it I love his honesty don't you so here's someone who was trained to look at the stars and then through a telescope to be able to look up into the night skies and then maybe point it out to brother brandom and say now look here's here this that and the other unlike you and I today where we can download an app and hold our phone up I mean know what I'm talking about and it will be able to tell you exactly here and there and there so then if you have a telescope which my son-in-law Scotty does and then we've been able to get up there on their uh paved parking or driveway coming in and at night skies look up and take that and point you directly into where it is now look how much further it's Advanced now than it was even when brother Brandon was here so brother brandham was shown it and yet he by the naked eye looking out there in the night skies and he couldn't find it so what do we need we need direction direction to be able to look now it's there but it don't help us if we don't know which way to look now by the grace of God it's the same way with the godhead and the gospel and with the church now you know a lot of people they don't have a problem being identified with the church mystical but most people's problem is being identified with the church local the church mystical then they oh yeah absolutely I'm a Christian I'm born again I'm part of the body well where do you attend oh I don't go to church I I I don't attend church cuz I I really don't need to but I'm part of the body wow so they have no problem being identified with church mystical but they have a problem being identified with church local but if you're actually in church mystical you will be part of an assembly that's right and there's many people the stream our services and other brothers all over the world and the reason they're not in church is not because they believe they don't have to be but because circumstances will not allow them to be there they live in places where there are no churches and it's not their first choice to have to stream but they also are identified with an assembly now see so it's a miror reflection of the stars that are in the heavens now most of us have no we can't even relate to the Stars up there and the numbers and all that that I gave you some of you don't even remember them right now you definitely won't remember them over your lunch today because you can't really relate right we we just can't relate it's so far over the top of our head and that's just not where we live but yet I like to look at it myself because I see my life story I see your life story I see that the dragon will be got a hold of I see the Capricorn I see all of that in the mystery of God what a little bit that I've been able to look at it and see and understand so to me it's predominantly over me every day of my life that I am going to win in this Warfare because it's already declared in the heavens now remember what's going on on life now and on the earth and time it Falls to us hour by hour day by day week by week month by month but if you want to know how it's all going to end turn up this way and look at Leo the Lion and then we'll look at the water spout and we look at all the things that are up there and we see the end has already been declared from the beginning it's written in the stars now whatever then we look upon the Earth at oursel and you're the prophet was down on the earth and looking up and him and the brothers is out there and they said uh it was showed to me by the Zodiac and I've tried my best to see it and I just can't see it yet it's there those who are trained know it's there job saw it now remember when God come to job and and God quoted to job the Bible that job knew and God asked job about the constellations which was pades the Seven Sisters Orion so God qu oted to him even about Urus did you are you the one who controls Urus are you the one that does the plees and why in the world would God quote that to job because job was a stargazer so he watched how did the Magi able to follow the lord Jesus and get exactly when where he was born and yet King Herod didn't know nothing about it it was right under his own nose because Herod did not know how to look in the Stars well let me tell you something don't think that I'm crazy now this morning and think Lord have mercy brother Donnie studied so much he's went absolutely nuts you see that's one advantage that the bride has in every Church age is that we also follow the Stars so in the Book of Revelation we see the right hand of Jesus being open and we see seven stars in the right hand of our Lord Jesus and those Seven Stars point to us that there will be seven Messengers that will come on the earth and out of their ministry will come the reflected light from the S so n of God and it will lead the elect back to where they come from the rest of the world look at oh we don't believe in no church AG Messengers we don't believe in no prophets well I feel sorry for them but they just can't see the constellations of the church ages amen now watch the prophet goes on and he said man used to look at it because it was a Bible but in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years now what I'd like to know is how did he know that before they started talking about it billions of liar they observable universe was not then what it is now as far as their knowledge so we have a Kian that did not go to NASA school or did not graduate from Harvard but talking in terms that scientists use today he could probably say it took you all long enough but you finally did get caught up now watch this in that whole great mass of millions and billions of light years God sets in the midst of it all and he looks down Paul is in there my mother is in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the order of that Heavenly Host now watch keep in mind and we're talking about the ride of divine order so it's not like these Stars they just go at random and they're upside down and sideways and you know one goes this way and one goes that way no they're everyone in an orbit in so much that our scientists will be able to tell us when there will be a solar eclipse or a lunar eclipse they'll be able to tell us pretty much the length of the days they'll have it now look at your Weather Channel they'll tell you when the sun will rise in the morning and they'll give you an approximate time of when the sun will set tomorrow afternoon and they can tell you out for years to come when a lot of these things will happen in the heavens why because they've studied it and it is so in order that they can forecast years and years to come when this and that and the other will happen is that right now now whenever it happens then then people on the Earth that love those sorts of things oh my uh a dear precious friend of mine brother Doug Baker from out in out in Tucson brother Doug Loves to to take photos and things of the eclipses and all that just this past year out in Arkansas and then went in different places and he's quite a quite a photographer and he's been able to get the one that is very rare and very occasional that it can be got but it's called the wedding ring I mean know what I'm talking about ever seen the picture of it few of you hardly none of you okay all right what whenever the eclipse comes upon the Earth and it's a certain time when the moon and the and the sun will come across the path and it reaches a certain spot and when it does if you have your camera right on it then the illumination from the outside forms a perfect circle and there will be a little tiny light right at the very top and it looks like a wedding ring ah a wedding ring so God wrote it up there in the scar in the stars and in the skies that the moon and the son would be husband and wife and every now and then God lets the sun Crown the moon with a wedding ring and it's written and the Stars so none of y'all have ever seen it well go online this evening Google will blow up after church morning go online and you can find it now why would God do such a thing which that is only visible from the earth now if you is up on Mars you'd never see it if you on Pluto you'd never see it you know you have to be at a certain place in a certain time frame to be able to see that the wedding is going on I just think when we were in our little denominations and even in some of our independent churches where many of them were just as bad as any denomination that was in the world we would never be able to see that there was a wedding going on but God called us out and opened our eyes and let us see there's a wedding going on and let me tell you today we are not going to the wedding we have already been wed we are going to the marriage supper of the Lamb because the wedding is going on right now we are joined together to our lord Jesus in an invisible Union praise be to God from all over the Earth from every nation every culture every race of people God is calling out a bride why because all of these stars that there in the heavens and this one that makes the sword of 9 and then nebulus 3:19 that's down on the bottom of it and it was actually there the light that you look at tonight when you look at the nebula which comes down from The Sword of The Swordsman on a Rion and you look in through that that light was actually started and left that nebula in the days of the Emperors of Rome it is that far away by the time it gets to us one day you will realize that Heaven is not a 100 billion light years away it's right here around us in another dimension our departed loved ones are not a billion light years away they are only 20 ft from where we are not only that your glorified body is right here in this building this morning and it's one to send a charge through you like a battery oh God let us get our jumper cables hooked up to our body what will it do it will unite us to the [Applause] groom I sought of the order of that Heavenly Host not one of them's out of place it's amazing what one child can do in a house right Harry it's amazing what one grandson can do everything is in order everything is in place and that one child comes in and in five minutes it's turned upside down and of course if you're a grandparent you just smile and laugh and acts like it's so wonderful as a matter of fact they say grandchildren are reward for not killing your kids brother Homer Longoria says the grandchildren were so Grand you wish you had had them first and forget them young ones but can you imagine our father and this is only an estimation of what they see has over one septian stars in the universe and not a one of them has ever broke time how many millions and billions of years have they been there and they're just going around and around what's their purpose to please him to serve him and to be able to actually for you to look at him and say wow wow a't that something and he says go ahead and join him kids enjoy him I put that out there for you when you would walk out there in the night and your battle so heavy and your trials so difficult and you think I don't know if I'll ever make it through this one or not that you could look up and say yes that star right there is the same one Adam looked at think of it the stars that you see at night Moses stood under them not so long ago Adam and Eve oh my his father would come down in the evening and the evening star would start settling in Adam and Eve would look at it it's the very same one you'll look at this afternoon that morning star that if you're up early enough in the morning and it comes out of their seat exact same one that Adam whatever he would awoke from a good night's rest in the Garden of Eden and stepped out there oh glory to God it was the very same star that Adam looked at the very same star that Joshua looked at the very same star when the Lord Jesus walked upon this Earth and he must have looked out there and looked at it and thought wow wow what a say in my word form I spoke all this into existence it's the same star is the same son that you look at at your church is the same one that he hurled out of his mouth millions of years ago the same one that Joshua when he stood there that day and say Moon stand still and son you stand still the very one that you will look at after church is the same one that Joshua stopped what's so sad for us is we just keep carrying our troubles carrying our problems trying to figure out our difficulties as if though it's left up entirely to us let me tell you today watch some of you ain't getting no victory over the things you're dealing with because you're trying to solve them yourself cuz there's something about as human beings it's one of the hardest things we can ever do is let things go let your hatred go it will destroy you if you don't if you don't let hard feelings go they will destroy you not only you but your children and their children and on down and on down you are making a way and setting a path for your children so if you hold resentment and pack that on down to another generation another generation you understand you're going to stand before God for Generations resentment generational hatred generational be the big people let it stop here come on somebody let's not carry on we don't want to be like people that if feuded down Through the Ages let's lay aside and be the bride forgive [Applause] I thought listen to this how he relates this God's Great Army and I thought of the soldiers so he views the stars as soldiers I thought of the soldiers and how do that Moon would happen to get out of order the Earth would be covered again with water in just a few minutes the Earth should be just like it was when God decided to use it to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was upon the breadth of the earth and if that Moon would ever move it would do the same thing again now look at the order of the stars and we all know of course by the tides and how the Moon it don't just get in your mind that that water is coming up on the visible part it's actually taking place under the the core of the earth as well that's why whenever they drill down on the earth this high tide and low tide they will hit salt water at certain times and will not hit salt water at other times why it's moving in the earth remember when the flood came it wasn't just from up here the Bible says The Fountains of the deep broke up so there hangs that Moon oh she's the weaker one she comes to four quarters justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself she she grows in glory she condescends in glory she grows in glory she condescends in glory she is a mirror of her husband the sun yetep the sun being 93 million miles from the earth the moon on an average of 267,000 miles and yet the atmosphere is so thin upon the moon the footprints of the first astronaut are still there it's like the scars that's on our hearts sometime we bear them and we carry them the only way we'll ever be able to rise above them is we must be overwhelmed by the presence of our son and our son can change our thin unforgiving unloving atmosphere and bring us into a regeneration of the soul and help us to look like the sun live like the sun act like the sun [Applause] and how long has it been since the moon has done all this maybe millions of years and when Papa made the Earth she stood up like this same temperature all the way around no Seasons no spring summer fall stood on her axis top and bottom but he made her with a degree an element of degree by which after the fall she would start tilting over like this and then when she did so it would allow the wobble inside her like this do you know why she does not wobble out of orbit and annihilate herself try to do your top that way try to take a bottle and set it and make it do that very far it'll just get completely out of wh you know why don't do it the lunar effect so being tilted over like this she still spins at a th miles an hour how in the world is that possible and every one of us sitting here day not sick as a horse we're spending a th000 miles an hour you all have been sitting you're spending a th000 miles an hour oh and people say there ain't no God oh my goodness we're spinning around last out here a, miles an hour and we're spinning over like this why don't we just wobble wobble wobble and annihilate oursel because God put this power above us she saw my this over 200,000 miles from us but God created her with a power that would affect the Earth God created an element called The Church the body of Jesus Christ this is why we need to go to the house of God this is why we need Fellowship watch people that get out of church and watch them wobble and wobble and wobble and wobble and they get totally out of retrospect to God but God has a church the Church of the Living God it helps balance you up and even in our warp status it helps us oh that's right amen so when the Moon Turns her back the tide comes in and then the Moon Turns back around and say ah oh no no no no only so far and the tide backs off can't you say why we need God ordained holy ghost film Ministry yeah I love the tapes I love reading the books but tapes ain't got an eyeball they ain't got a spiritual eye to watch the condition of the church come on somebody that's why you need a Shepherd that's why you need men of God that are in tune with the message of the hour and they can catch the spirit of the church they can catch where the church is at come on Church oh my thank God for the tapes thank God for our Bible but my Bible does not have eyeballs my Bible does not have the ability to judge the spiritual metrics of our church but God uses men Hallelujah God uses man he always has and he always [Applause] will and when that moon rocks a little bit away from the earth and the tides come up when it goes down it just follows the tithe it's God's Great heart Army and when I thought about that being God's Great Army we went to bed then I begin to think that not a one of those get out of their place they're all set in place and there's moving anywhere out of them it's for a cause and will affect this Earth we're just seen the results of it now from some of moving into other spots now I thought then is that great Heavenly Host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out a cater yeah so you watch it in a church you watch it in a family you watch it in a nation you get the leader of the nation whose mind is so perverted away from reality and Truth watch what one leader one president one whatever it is and can turn that entire nation upside down or bring them back to the trur we see all through the Old Testament that God would have kings that would raise up there was people like Josiah of course and ASA different ones that God Hezekiah that God would raise him up and there might be a good one then there' be 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven did evil on the side of the Lord did evil on the side of the Lord did evil on the side of the Lord as his father did all the days of his life and then thou would send Israel what is it you've got a rogue star a rogue star that is affecting the entire Kingdom so is it with preachers so is it with preachers oh my notice this he says what about the disorder of the Earthly host how when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order now listen this is your charge we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit now it would have been easier of course to let Angels run the church let Angels run the kingdoms let Angels run the empires on the Earth but God chose to give man a probationary period upon the Earth and to prove to all the races there are no Superior human races every one of them are corrupt praise the Lord now people may call black power and white power and purple Power and pink Power and all that sort of thing it's a bunch of trash and nonsense the black race is not Superior over the White and the white sure ain't Superior over the black or the Indian or any other God made of one blood all people and the church said but God has let these es be able to Reign nrod actually if you look at your history you find out that Nimrod was one of the first ones to rule and according to all the history that I can find emerod was a black man so the one that was a leader first was the black race and then you look at the whites and all that they have done the prophet tells us being a white man that the white man is a renegade well come on you white people you can say Amen to it can you that is a renegade don't you understand all the negative things that he spoke against us As Americans he never spoke against the Spanish or the French or the Italian the way he did us he spoke against America so much and he said the American Spirit is frolic Frolic and laughter haaa but that also means we've got more to overcome and by the grace of God we will overcome the American Spirit we do do not want to be just identified as Americans we want to be identified as Sons and Daughters of God oh my let's can I have a few more minutes watch Joel prophesied that there would be a return of an Army in the last days Joel chap 2:7 they sh run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War they shall March everyone on his ways plural now watch the word of the Lord using a symbolism as an army so this Army of God in the last days these are the descriptions of what they'll do they'll run like Mighty Men if you notice it doesn't say they were Mighty Men but they will run like Mighty Men there's only one Almighty Among Us that's right and it ain't you and it certainly ain't me it's him but we're going to run like mighty men and women and they shall climb the wall like Men of War and they shall March everyone on his ways now why would he use the word March so a March is and you've seen it of course in military parade I just think it's so neat myself whenever you look out there and you've got hundreds of thousands of soldiers and they're just marching and their legs are moving back and forth like that and their arms are doing whatever and you think wow they had to train so much to be able to do that but I wonder if Word of Life Church is marching today are we all going at the same Pace are our legs going this way or one's going this way and one's going that way and one's going that way somebody's heading over here some of you is heading over there how are we ever going to defeat the Devil if we don't join together as an IND you I'm an individual yes but as individuals that are joined together for one purpose to the house of God we're not trying to take your individual identity but simply rob you or take away from you an error that you do not need an identification with the Church of the Living God you do if you are a Christian there should be a hunger in your heart not just to come to a building but to be a part of the body of Christ notice what he says they shall March everyone on his ways so it's a decare dedicated path for each one to march on and they're not going to be marching over over here the pastor's wife ain't going to be over there and the Deacon's wife the Deacon's wife ain't going to be over there with the pastor and the pastor is going to be down his place and the trustees there and the song leader and the musicians and the lay people everybody finding their way and marching marching marching and they shall not break their ranks now most human beings have a problem with rank here we go now we're out of the stars now we're out of the galaxies and we're right back down where we all live oh my y'all will be raising your hands for me to go back to the septian and all the rest of the stuff huh they shall not break their rank so what is breaking the rank so it's one that would be designated to be in a certain position and someone else looks at that position and they would rather be there than to be where God placed them but Joel's prophecy said they will not break the ranks look friends as a pastor I have a designated rank in the body of Christ I am not a prophet so the word cannot come to me I am not called to straighten out the Prophet I am not called to give all understanding to what the prophet said I'm not called to be a Joshua to come and follow up on the prophet's message don't get quiet on me now and neither are you as lay members called to straighten out what you think the prophet messed up you are called to get in your position get your army get your uniform if you've been given a butcher knife or whatever you been given get it out if you're a tater peeler have the sharpest Tater peeler you can find if you're called to peel carrots and maters and ters for all the rest of us get in the kitchen my sister and go to peeling them maters and don't you feel like that we don't need you if the Army don't eat they don't fight oh you say well brother Donnie I'm not a great man of God the only thing I can do is pray for you and that's what will help me to meet the devil one onone that's what'll help the rest of the men of God around the earth is Mam and daddies and young people that are praying God help our ministry God help our pastor give him wisdom give him knowledge give him understanding God help brother Daryl God help brother Joel God help these Minister Brothers to preach the word that's your rank [Applause] they shall run like Mighty Men they shall climb the wall like Men of War they shall March won't you notice the order of the army of God they're not playing around they're not just josling back and forth I was never in the military but there's many here that have been and they could tell us how it is oh and I go to low sometimes in Home Depot I bought a bunch of the plants and different things for around here and they say you're in the military I said does the army of the Lord count depends on whether they're religious or not if they're religious they said well sir it ought to I've never picked up a gun to fight for our nation I never took training but I have been called to the army of the Lord oh yeah brother Daryl tells the story that whenever he was called and he went up as a young man he's left-handed he always assumed he was left ey dominant so whenever they sent him out on the Rings to fire guns they told Brother Daryl that he would be on the howitzer that you don't know what that means do you well they didn't give him a Target this size they give him one this size but it wasn't until he got out of the armed forces that he realized and found out he was right eyed dominant so being left-handed automatically had go this way couldn't already at the side of a barn but he found out he's looking through the wrong eye uhhuh the wrong eye you see God's changed eyes now for seven times so it went from Paul to the second Church a satday church a and this is why that the Pentecostal and many of them here behind us they're still shooting but they can't hit the side of a barn they can't do nothing they're compromising on marriage they're compromising on birth control they're compromising on abortion and all these other things but the only reason you can see is because you're seventh eye dominant you found out what eye age you're living in and then you looking at it well Hallelujah to God you found out well glory to God I'll tell you one thing yeah I was that too I was Pentecostal eye dominant I couldn't hit the side of a barn Harley but thanks be to God I found out that I was seventh angel I dominant and once I've got lined up you ask the devil my success rate that's why it ought to be with you as Sons and Daughters of God it ain't me it's you ain't you it's the grace of God that lined up our eye dominance and that's why we won't just overcome drinking we won't just overcome the negativity of the world we will actually overcome death itself for there are people I believe with all of my heart that are sitting in this building today that will not die it's because you've got your sight lined up our sight is not just aimed on cigarettes it's not just aimed on Tobacco our sight is on death Hallelujah and we will conquer death itself in a moment we will be changed by the power of [Applause] God listen but when you're out in eternity time flies look in verse eight and we'll close with this so they run like Mighty Men they'll climb the wall like Men of War they'll March look at them running climbing marching but not breaking I know people don't like don'ts but there's dos and there don'ts right in the same verse you got to mixed together look at verse eight neither shall one here's another don't neither shall one thrust another oppress or crowd one one of the very few armies on the earth that kill our own wounded so when we see a man or woman down if we don't like why can we just push them down farther I'd like to ask you Saint something if we were not in 2024 almost 25 we were in the first century and there was a woman showed up at our church we don't know exactly what her name was cuz the Bible doesn't mention her but all we know is she has got son some kind of reputation cuz she had five husbands and was living with another man that wasn't her own but we heard that Jesus got a hold of her would Word of Life Church be okay with the woman at the well coming to our church what about the man from Gad right who had a legion of demons in him drinking lying adultery so many demons when they were cast out that it killed a whole herd of hogs and every one of them demons lived in one man but yet it just so happened that man had robbed you one time that man had knocked your daddy in the head that man had violated your niece but after getting saved that man wanted to come to church would we be okay with that or would we tell him well you set out in your car and stream you can't sit in here amongst us us what former Liars prostitute denominational prostitutes and everything else I want the person in here this morning beginning at this pull pit who has been without sin hello testing one two one two if any of us make it it'll be God's grace not our works not that we deserve it so who is it that keeps us the grace of God I have risked my reputation many times over the years for preaching for certain preachers the mainstream message preachers told me don't go there don't go there oh don't go there I have risked my reputation counseling and praying for people that was so lost and such scum on the bottom of the barrel say how in the work can you do that oh because the prophet told us Jesus reputation was made among such people and I realized hadn't been for the grace of God I could have been an adulterer a liar a murderer so if we were in the first century and our church a messenger was not brother brandham but it was Paul and Paul wanted to come and preach in our church hold a meeting and some of you all began to search his background you found out this man this man had Steven stoned this man had many of the children of God thrown in jail yes sir they were beat because of him they were whipped some of them lost their lives the prophet said the very reason Paul wanted to become a martyr was because that thing haunted him of all the people brother Phillip what he had put him through would if any of you all have a problem with Paul come and hold us and meet him ain't it amazing how we get we become so self-righteous so l lift it up and we're the ones that can give people Grace and you can have Grace and you can't and you can and myself I go back to the words of Jesus blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy pades is in the same same spot that the Lord God placed her in millions of years ago not saying that there's not a variance of degree by which atmospheric pressure or something might make them you know back and forth back and forth but it's not like that the star from pleades went to um Urus or wound up in in Taurus or some of the others I honestly can't say that myself I've complained I've grumbled I still to this day wish I was not a pastor I wish did this day I wasn't even a preacher cuz most of my problems in life has come from God's people being a preacher has just about destroyed me and annihilated my sanity Welcome to the Real World but in reality if the Lord God were to say to me this evening okay Donnie I heard what you told the church there um you want me to just drop this thing about the preacher deal and we just let you go I look up and say now Lord you know I was only teasing right I mean I it's odd isn't it it's odd how we are in reality we want his will and his word more than anything else but we're in the middle of it boy it can be so hard it can be so tough but remember there is a divine order all it takes is a husband to step out of the will of God and watch that whole family a wife to step out of the will of God step out of the will of God just for a period of months and cause all kinds of pain and anxiety same with a pastor of a church so a pastor starts in a certain direction away from God can you imagine if I'd get so stupid stupid just beside myself just out of my mind I think I ain't going back no more that's what some of you all say so if I just said I'm done with it I'm moving to I ain't telling none of you cuz I don't want you to where I'm going but if I was the one God sent here to help you then where would you go what would happen to you and you and you because you see a man that's really called of God it's like God has put him there and being part of that constellation then God sends the other stars to be part of that constellation then another man comes in tries to boot him out or you know they try to take people from another constellation I don't want anybody else from any other constellation myself I only want people at our church who God sends cuz if they come floating in with us and they come on their own we're all going to be unhappy what would happen to your life if the devil could wear me down and wear brother Tim PR down and other men of God down so low that they just think I can't take it no more and that star just goes out of the middle of the cluster oh it's plenty of preachers yeah you could get another my you could have one vot in in by next Sunday but how would the constellation work how would this be how would that be you see that all right now you can see it from my spot so what about yours well it seem like I ain't got no friends at the church it seemed like this is going on I I think we should look for another place I I think we should go ah but you'll tell me I shouldn't do that but you look at yourself and well you know what I'm a free moreal agent yeah exactly that's what's got you in so much trouble right and me and every other human being so what we should do is say Lord help me if this is my place I'm a part of this constellation then help me to do what I can let me shine and you know there's a certain equation that scientists have come up with to be able to measure the brightness and the illumination of stars a lot of it has to do with distance of course from where we see them but what they found out is it's the depths of the iron core and how much iron is in the core of that planet and there are no five pointed stars as you know they're all uh in a circle anyway but it's because of that and then the borrowed light reflects upon them so the star cannot brag about anything that it's done cuz whoever made it put that iron or in its core so the density of the iron core will say would be 27% then it will have the capability of catching the light well there's another star out there and it may be closer to the Earth than that one is but it's density of its core it's only 21% iron or no matter how much it tries it will never produce the same light as the other one so the 27% guy can't really brag to the 21% guy I got more iron or than you got all he can do is shine shine shine back to the Creator my goodness if you can sing like a mocking bird this morning and every body here just absolutely loves your singing and maybe there's some that sings like a crow and then sometimes they sing like this and that and the other but they're singing with all their heart don't make fun of them God's the one who gave them that much iron or yes sir maybe there's preachers boy they can preach and they're absolutely your favorites boy they get called to preach conventions and great big meetings and then there's other little brothers and they go here and there and there and never preach conventions but rest their life I thank God for them Stars how many wants to be what God made you you're a part of the army friends let's bow our heads praise God lord Jesus as we have our heads bowed down to the dust of the Earth from when our bodies were taken Lord we believe that our origin is not of this Earth but of a Heavenly nature we're praying that you'd help us today Lord I pray for myself first not because I'm selfish but because I think I'm the most needy one here no doubt I'm more needy than anybody that'll stream this service or anybody that'll AR of it because to my care and charge has been committed The Souls of hundreds of people and thousands that I affect around the world and sometimes it scares me to death to think about it if I ponder over it much I get so nervous I can't hard even think about it it I need you Lord help me help me Jesus that I'll stay magnetized to your word as long as I do that then I'll have no no worries about going off this tangent or that one or money or women or popularity or nothing else as long as I'm magnetized to your word which your Prophet said was the north po star and the needle always goes to that North Star then I'll be safe as long as I'm there in you Lord I pray for my brothers and sisters this morning that you'd help each of them some of them are looking and they're searching We Believe Lord that many of the people of our Earth are going through an identity crisis they don't know who they are father we realize Satan is taking great advantage of that for the time frame that we're in Satan is feeding all this transgender stuff and this gay stuff to the young people and they were born a boy but through all this corruption it confuses them and they're not sure if they were a girl born in a boy's body or if they're a girl or vice versa and it's an identity crisis and then our rotten government has got so rotten that they want to change them from what they were born to be to something else and what they're finding is which our government present tense government has hid the documentation and the proof that many of these young people that have gone through these things has increased suicidal rates and has increased regret of doing it true Lord God we at one time had an identity crisis some of us thought we were Baptist we thought we were Pentecostal we thought we were Beyond salvation we could never be bride but what you did was you sent a message in the last days that would wake us up to our true identity and the crisis was settled and the chaos was changed but since has happened Lord now is a attacking us from outside cu the soul is so anchored to the North Star he can't move it no more so he'll hit us with diseases and arguments and difference of opinions and this and that and the other to disrupt our minds and our hearts and our homes and our churches Lord we need you so much may our church never lose our true identity if there's any standing here today today going through an identity crisis whether it will be a sexual one or a spiritual one I pray father that you would help them to bring back bring back to their being their original purpose and program of God we're here to serve you despite our failures our mistakes Satan tried to give Fallen Christians this identity crisis when they mess up horribly terribly and they think they can't be saved he tries to bring back the memory of the identity crisis trying to make them lose their identity that they are the elect of God David must have went through that whenever he committed his terrible Deeds at B Sheba and all the things went on we can hear him crying out praying but finally David was able to find it cleanse me with hisp and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be pure for it is against thee and the only have I sinned oh God but blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate both day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water which bring forth its fruit in its season whatsoever he doeth shall prosper but the ungodly are not so but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away hallelujah hallelujah therefore the righteous shall not stand in the way of Sinners nor the ungodly in the seed of the righteous oh Father May the identity be crisis be settled I pray Lord in the name of Jesus we worship you father we are your stars of the end time
