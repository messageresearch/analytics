is so simple and yet so powerful we know that we've set aside these uh particular services for questions and answers but we just need to keep in mind that while we're here um the Lord is mindful of every need that we have there may be a need that will lay outside the confines of these questions and answers but if you have a need that does if we can be sensitive and believe and just reach out to the Lord tonight I believe he can move me in a direction for two minutes three minutes five minutes whatever it need be to be able to minister to you not only to you but there's many many more that stream in this service than what there is here in this visible audience so we say the same thing to them as well certainly privileged for us to be gathered together like this tonight we're so grateful uh not been that long ago don't seem like that we was having to have service and on the holiday in and such an inconvenience the brothers having to take the music down um many services after every service set it back up again we couldn't have of course special services like this and I'm just so happy the Lord's give us our own place back again aren't you I'm going to start tonight with this um this question I want you to listen to the question carefully because it's it's a little bit unusual but it was um a question that that was U sent to me by a couple of different people that were talking about this subject so I thought instead of just answering them individuals that I would um answer it before you all and also for the for the whole church since it affects um several people in our church Someone told me that breeding dogs cannot offer tithes for this kind kind of service because God doesn't want money from these things can you explain and you can see there that breeding dogs can offer tithe in this kind of service because God doesn't expect money from these two things can you please explain because we have people in our church that breed dogs for a living is breeding dogs wrong now this is the scripture that uh the indiv indviduals both of them actually sent to me there shall be no whor of the daughters of Israel nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel and then the next verse Thou shalt not bring the hire of a or the price of a dog which seems really odd that you talk about prostitution and talk about a Bow Wow but actually this word is not a four-legged dog anybody know what it means you do Rob Carol is okay Thou shalt not bring the hire of a or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow for even both these are an Abomination to the Lord thy God let's just pray together again and we'll answer this question by the help of the Lord Jesus we thank you tonight for your mercy to us Lord thank you that we could be gathered together again Lord just such an honor to stand before young people who have a desire to come they were just here last night but they wanted to come again and I'm sure others wanted to and they couldn't for whatever reason but we pray that you just be mindful of us Lord and those that are streaming the service would you help us to understand thank you Father for these questions and I pray that you'd help me to move us side that I would be able to answer them in the correct way granted father I ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated now let's um let's look at this uh verse 17 again now I ask you this question it would seem kind of strange and odd but once once I go to giving the meanings of the word it's pretty much a self-explanatory but whenever we would read it especially in the English language we would tend to think that God um was talking about dog raising but this was a Canaanite practice that was very common especially among the Canaanites that worshiped and had a goddess of fertility most of the Canaanites had gods and goddesses and there were many of them they were plural so if they had a goddess which was a goddess um that they wanted to bless their crops their children and all that sort of thing may seem very very weird and strange to us but they would actually have Temple prostitutes both male and female and whenever you would come to bring an offering to this goddess the most common one was asteroth as it changed of course down through a time it became a sty but it was the same God began with the the Phoenicians but um each one of them developed their own so it was the goddess of fertility so whenever you would come to worship then and bring an offering a sacrifice then they would also have these male and female prostitutes that was there and they was not there for any good reason you can imagine what they were there for so they were there to worship this invisible goddess and they were there to bring an offering and they were also there to partake of prostitution so they felt like that by doing that that would bring them fertility to their lands to their children and so on so now let's read this verse 17 Again there shall be no wh of the daughters of Israel now I know sometimes the Bible can use very plain language and the Bible of course wants it to be clear so it's easy to understood but I want you to look at the meaning of this now remember the Old Testament was written in Hebrew and the New Testament was written in Greek so the word here is Kesha Kesha and it means means a female Temple prostitute or a harlot so there shall be no of the daughters of Israel nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel now look at the meaning of this word very similar kadash which was a male Temple prostitute so God said there be no male no of the daughters of Israel or a sodomite of the sons of Israel now look it jumps down to verse 17 and it would seem to be opposites but actually verse 17 and verse 18 are talking about the same thing Thou shalt not bring the hire of a now it may seem very weird to us but apparently there was the tendency or the possibility because Israel did get into this eventually and they got into many of these false gods and some of them were going to be so farfetched in their minds and so perverted that they were going to either prostitute themselves or they were going to pimp out their daughters and their granddaughters and so on and then whenever they would make the money off of this prostitution they would actually want to pay tithes off of this prostitution now that shows how corrupt that a human being could be now we would think people would become so VI like that they just get away from God and don't want nothing to do with God but whenever a person gets a religious spirit on them they're actually seven times worse than just a rank sinner because then they get religion and they get evil mixed together so God wanted this to be established don't bring this to me because I will not accept this tithing of this type of the life but then you think well why would God then talk about the high of a female prostitute and then talking about selling a dog and making money off of a dog Thou shalt not bring the hire of a or the price of a dog but look at the meaning of the word dog dog literal or it can mean contempt or abasement or a male cult prostitute a male cult prostitute so both 17 and 18 are speaking the exact same thing so the price of a dog here that the Bible is referring to is not money obtained from the sale of a dog but rather a male prostitute which God called a male prostitute a dog so I guess I wonder then today whenever we've got um males and females that stand in a lot of the denominational churches that are homosexual they claim to be pastors they claim to be teachers they say that God accepts them God wouldn't even accept the tithe of one much less one themsel and God has not changed has he but yet you look around in the world and they will get to a place to where they will try their best to force us to accept them as normal they can cut off my head I will not accept them as normal because if I do I will have to call almighty God a liar praise the Lord so God would not accept them the tithing of a woman which was in prostitution neither would God accept the tithing of a man which was in prostitution now let's read a few scriptures in the Old Testament and show you how that the Jews related to dogs in general and when you look at this and it'll help you to appreciate why that this symbolism was used in this in 1st Samuel chapter 17 verse 43 whenever David went out to meet Goliath and the Philistines said unto David am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his Gods so it was a common thing not only among the Jews but among the Philistines that a dog a natural dog did not have a very good representation among them now David whenever Saul is after him 1 Samuel 24:14 after whom is the king of Israel come out after whom Dost thou pursue after a dead dog so here he puts a Double Indemnity upon this so just to be called the dog would have been bad enough so David adds another negative thing to that and he says King you're this great king of Israel why would you waste your time coming out to somebody like me now look what he's trying to do Saul feels like David is a threat to his kingdom but David calls himself something that was so low and so a base now he's not calling himself a male prostitute in this instance but he's calling himself just an animal so he would be able to relate to Saul I am no threat to you I am no threat to your kingdom I am no more than a dead dog compared to you so why would you waste your time coming after me and then he said after a flea 2 Samuel 16:9 then said abashi the son of Zariah unto the king now this is whenever David had went up to the city and asked for victuals there and they would not do it because they said we don't want you here we don't believe in your Administration we we follow Saul we have nothing to do with you so he cursed him and and and of course it made all the rest of David's followers very angry why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over I pray thee and take off his head so this is the way naturally then that they would relate to a doll now watch Psalm 22 this is the prophetic Psalm of the Lord Jesus hanging on the cross and David under inspiration is speaking these words as if it was the Lord Jesus himself for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet verse 20 deliver my soul from The Sword my darling from the power of the dog so this is the way they related it so for God to call a man a dog it was one of the lowest things that he could be called Isaiah 5610 his Watchmen are blind now listen at God talking about the leader of Israel listen how obase they had become themselves his Watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs that was by no means a compliment they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to Slumber yay they are greedy dogs so it wasn't bad enough that God called them one adjective and dog but God said I'm going to lay the double whammy on you you're greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are Shepherds now notice who he's talking to he's talking to the leaders of the flocks of Israel Shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way everyone for his own gain from his quarter I imagine the Holy Ghost would probably call a lot of preachers today d dogs when you and greedy dogs now watch in the New Testament the book of Philippians chapter 3:2 that Paul picks up the same mindset now remember he was a Jew so as we would have um terms that we would use and call it a local cism then it would be words that we would say here in Tennessee and you might go to up in Ohio and they'd say where are you from we all say you know as dumb as this and crazy as that where are you from Brother D and brother Den they used to go up to Ohio and Indiana to hunt years ago whenever they' go to some of them stores up there and they'd stop you know buy them a cup of coffee or whatever and then people would just get them to talk say talk talk again say something else we want to hear what y'all got to say because what they were saying was so strange to them now remember Paul was a Jew so in Paul's words and his terminology to bring it over word they would be able to relate to it Paul said Beware of dogs so when you see a beware of dog sign that's actually scriptural but Paul wasn't talking now again about a four-legged dog but he's talking about people beware of dogs beware of evil workers Beware of the concision second Peter 2:21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness and after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it has happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again now here Peter of course picking up the symbolism of a dog a dog doing what a dog vomiting and then turning right back around and eating that vomit and what's he liken it to people that knew the truth and then they turn away from that truth and that go back to the world and Peter used this symbolism again one of the lowest animals that there was to a Jew and he says and a s that was washed to her returned to her washed after she had been washed of course in the mar so he was showing how that people are like dogs and Hogs oh my goodness I sure don't want be called that de you in the Book of Revelation now watch John blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs now once again the Lord is not talking about chabas and Great Danes and German Shepherds and German police and you know all that sort of thing for without are dogs look at the New Testament now the Greek word here it is Kuan which is a dog or a man of an impure mind an impudent man so what Moses is referring to here is not people selling dogs and making money off of them but it is actually was actually a male prostitute called by God a dog and let me read to you from the Moffet translation of the Bible no one of woman of Israel shall be a temple prostitute and no man of Israel shall be a temple prostitute you must never pay a vow unto The House of the Eternal your God with the money that is the hire of a prostitute or the wages of a catamite anybody ever heard that word before catamite that word is a word which means a young boy which is taken and turned into a prostitute for the use of older men it's an Abomination The Eyes Of God both are abom om itable to the Eternal your God now once the King James version of course was written which most of you know it was the 1611 version then after that there's been many different versions of that they go back they get the Latin Vulgate uh they get different Greek translations the Greek interlineal and they get different ones I know I'm probably speaking all the top of your AG you don't want them even talking about but it's basically that they go into the words and they look at it to try to get a little clear understanding than what was written several hundred years ago and this is where we get some of the uh newer versions of the Bible so I'm going to read you a few of them from the exact same verse this one's a new international version you must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or a male prostitute in the house of the Lord your God to pay any vow because the Lord your God detest them both the Berean Study Bible you must not bring the wages of a prostitute whether male or female into the house of the Lord your God to fulfill any any vow because both are detestable to the Lord your God the New Living Translation States when you're bringing an offering to fulfill a vow you must not bring to the house of the Lord your God any offering from the earnings of a prostitute whether a man or a woman so notice now these newer version s that they don't say a woman and a dog but a woman and a man does that make sense everybody a woman or a man for both are detestable to the Lord your God the Christian Standard Bible do not bring a female prostitutes wages or a male prostitutes earnings into the house of the Lord your God to fulfill any vow because they both are detestable to the Lord your God the Amplified Bible says you shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price I really like this one of a dog a sodomite into the house of the Lord your God in payment for a vow now I just like to remind everybody not just necessarily you all tonight but those that might stream this it wasn't God who needed saving it in the Old Testament so God has not changed his views about such things so dogs are part of God's animal creation and according to Genesis 126 God put the animal Creation in subjection to man to to to to sell a dog a cat a rabbit a horse a cow a pig whatever more there's no difference in selling a dog than there would be a horse or a cow or something else but God actually was not mean mean a four-legged dog but he was referring to a sodomite and may I just say that didn't stop in the Old Testament well we can take the book of Romans we can also take many other places in the New Testament and prove that God's view of that is still exactly the same and the church said praise the Lord question number two how is it fair that a message Christian goes in the Rapture but any other denomination doesn't how is it fair that a message Christian goes in the Rapture but any other denomination doesn't well let me say first of all that we don't really measure God by the way that we would think Fair first of all God owns all Grace all Mercy all compassion he's the source he's the fountain he's the resource he's the Creator so God can give grace mercy Peace Love forgiveness pardon uh Redemption reconciliation on and on and on and on I could go to whomever he wants because it's his to be able to give now it's not so much that message people are any better than anybody else because there's some message people if we would call them that that are probably lower than some of the Baptist people you work with because just because they go to the name of message don't mean they believe the message a bit more than anything so the term message can just be another denominational tag if people don't live the right kind of a life but what we believe by saying the message is that God has sent a prophet with the message in the last days that would be a restoration back to the original word that the apostolic church had in the beginning so let's read together and we'll read a few things about how God can be able to elect by for knowledge and God be can be able to give certain things that he wishes to give to certain people because he is Sovereign within himself for we know Paul said that all things work together for good to them them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so God is not asking us okay how many wants to be saved how many wants to go to heaven how many wants to be bride how many wants to be Church how many wants to be reprobate how many wants to be a clean vessel how many wants to be an unclean vessel but God himself fornew every person that would ever want to serve him and he also know th those that if he would go on for a million years they would never serve him the Millennium is a proof that if God gives people a thousand years of Peace some of them at the end of the Millennium now remember they've not been taught sin they were actually created a new in a human body at the beginning of the Millennia so their parents never handed down to them sinful traits the way mine and yours did they're going to be brought up because it'll people that never have the opportunity to be able to have the gospel preached to them God down Through the Ages has kept different ones hope you understand this that there's people right now that we will never reach with this message around the world they will never be reached a just God will never let them people be judged before the white Throne judgment without being able to hear about it so why would God do that because he wants to reserve some to be able to raise them up in the Millennium and they will hear it for their first time in the Millennium and at the end of that Thousand Years the devil would would be loosed out of his P prison and these people which saw you and I in glorified bodies they saw no deaths no suffering no sin no lying no adultery everything was peace the temperature was perfect the climate was perfect absolute perfection was upon the Earth and yet these people after 1,000 years of seeing all of that will say I hate Jesus Christ I hate his kingdom I despise this stuff now unlike you and I we were born with that they were not born with it they were actually called by the voice of God Out of the Dust of the earth they were not born by their parents by mother and father father but God called them from the dust of the earth and God is going to give them a chance so no doubt they got a soul no doubt a human Spirit to be able to make that choice with reasoning and at the end of that thousand years they will make their choice to go with the devil now just go on and say this if the Millennium would have been a million years then people would have done the same thing so some people no matter how long God would give them at the end of it he looks at that span of time and he he sees they would still hate him they would hate his word they would hate his economy they would hate his kingdom they would hate instruction they would hate him telling them what to do he knows that but he also knows there's people on the Earth that love him they'll serve him it makes no difference what they've got to go through now you and I don't know that we can look at them and say but they're such good people well let me say it to you like this you will know people on one level if I could talk to them same people for about 30 minutes and just take the Bible and show them some of the things from the pages of their own Bible I want to use mine I'll use theirs and just let me show them go from fly from one page to another to another and show them things in their own Bible you'd be amazed in 10 to 15 minutes the anger the upset look that they would start giving the tone of their voice how it would change but see if you don't cross them that way you'll never see that but really what gets them up and gets them all red is whenever they go to seeing things in the word so remember whenever you are looking at people many times you're only judging them about what little bit that you know about them I can tell you that not only just a denominational people but also of message people you'd be surprised at the way that people have done there's been a few times me sitting in my office and me actually counseling people from our church that I thought I was going to get hit there was a man a few years ago that was sitting across the desk from me and he come in and he come in and he sat down and he said you was preaching at me I said I was not I wasn't preaching at you I didn't even know you were here he got up out of his chair and took his fist and went right like this to me ah somebody you all shook hands with and said hello brother wow I thought Jesus my nose is big enough it don't need to be no bigger I said now brother calm down just calm down and sat down I said I was not preaching at you the Holy Ghost might have been and if he did then I ain't apologizing for that jumped up again and come at me again so you see whenever a preacher which is Anointed by the Holy Ghost will take the word and go to saying things now most of you I'm not going to tell that person's name because you don't need to know but most of you would never believe that and if you didn't believe me and take my word for it the way you know that person you'd think no no no way well I come back close to having a bigger nose I know so you see God knows things about people that you and I look at them and we say oh but they're such good people they're just such good people well according to Jesus there is none good no not so do we believe our opinion about people or what Jesus said that includes us if it was not for the grace of God we wouldn't be good for nothing we wouldn't be clean enough for a good clean bullet is that right but God has changed us by his grace now watch Paul in verse 29 for whom he did for no I love this word for ordained no before to have knowledge beforehand Those whom God fornew so they would love him praise be to God Those whom God forew so they would love him now remember the question how is it fair that a message Christian goes in the Rapture but other denomination does not notice again as Paul goes on to say he also did predestinate so God forne them and then he predestinated which means to determine before to predetermine decide before him in the New Testament of God decreeing from eternity to for orain an appoint beforehand so how many of your brothers now are going to tell me here tonight that you are perfectly f fine you unmarried Brothers with your mother and father picking out your wife what you brothers are you're not brother Paul well I mean what's the what's the issue you wouldn't want someone picking out your wife but we want to pick out God's we want to tell God who he is to allow in his bride how dare we all right now let's switch it to the other side sisters that's unmarried would you want your daddy picking out your husband would you want your little mean brother or your little mean sister was that fair Ellie would you want your sisters picking out your hubby what about it what about it sisters what about it Brothers what what Brother Don that's not even fair well it's not fair for us to pick out God's wife is it so what did God do God picked out his own now was it fair for me to pick Carol y'all think that was fair was it fair for her to answer my choice and say yes I'll marry you was it fair for your dad to pick your mom or what if somebody else wanted him well shouldn't shouldn't he marry them just simply because they want him so you see in reality we honestly don't believe from practical realm that we have the right or say to force anyone to marry someone else we don't even believe that naturally I'm sure not going to do it to God so God himself will choose who goes in the Rapture now remember the Rapture is the crowning when God made the woman in the beginning the woman was such a special creation to God that he brought and give her to the man and the man was the crowning of all of botney life and animal life and the mountains and the rivers and the streams and then God gave the woman and Paul picks it up of course when he's dealing with headship in the New Testament and he lays it out that the woman is such a great thing and given as a great price to the man so is the bride to Christ Jesus so when whenever we talk about who's going in the Rapture it is the elect of the AG is that God himself chose it's like his wife so it must be a woman that is such a reflection of him so if God allows one liar in the Rapture it shows what kind of man that he is so if God allows one hypocrite one adulterer one hormonger one sodomite just one that's all it'll take and say there's millions of others that's genuine consecrated Christians and yet God compromises and allows one liar to come in that shows us what kind of a God that he is but he won't will he he will not allow any of that to come so then whoever's going to go in the Rapture it will be God's choice and they will reflect his choice in a woman now you your brothers that are still looking for a wife if you come and bring uh a woman in the office to me and now brother Donnie as I met with a young brother and sister sitting here tonight Sunday and they're talking about their relationship and just questions about this and that and the other now if you brothers would bring a woman in with you into my office and sat down and she's got on a mini skirt about like this she's got earrings hanging down like this look like stirrups on a saddle and she's dressed ungodly and indecent and I've got to sit there like this the whole time she's in the office because she's dressed so awful and you come to tell me brothers that you've come to pray about marrying this woman then there's something wrong with your taste and what a Godly woman is brother bam even goes on to say that if a man marries such a woman that he knows is not fit to be his wife pretty much he's getting what he deserves so if God would feel that way then about us men would any of your brothers want to go on the street I'm not really familiar with with Johnson City where any of this would be but I've Been Told that there's certain places in Johnson City where you can go and it's known for prostitution would any of you young Brothers go there and pick up a lady and and bring her to church on Sunday morning and decides you want her to be your wife would any of y'all do that you would well you see then if we wouldn't want to marry a prostitute then we should not try to force God to marry a prostitute now we're not against individuals in organizing religion many of them love the Lord and they will have to come out of that before it goes into Satan or once they're found in there when the when the mercy seat is closed they receive the mark of the beast why because denominationalism is the mark of the beast why you say that Brother Don because a church like this you think an organization wouldn't love to have a church like this and you know one the first things they would do is get rid of me because no organization is going to tell me what to preach no board no system a bunch of people getting together now brother Donnie you ain't going to preach on this and this and this you're barking up the wrong tree ain't nobody telling me what to preach but Jesus and telling me what I can't preach but a denomination will send you what you can and cannot preach and if I did not comply and and they gave me to Wednesday night then you know what they're going to do they're going to get rid of me and they're going to give this church to someone that they choose and then they're going to tell you all what you can do and what you can't do and they're going to tell you sisters oh you don't have to have that long hair that was that knucklehead that you had up there for a pastor you don't have to wear dresses no more then you're going to have a bunch of men that tells you what to do well now wait a minute wait a minute he he showed us this in the Bible Deuteronomy 22:5 says it's an Abomination for a man to put on that which pertains to a woman and a woman put on that which pertains to a man he even read it from the New Testament the book of Peter and read the New Testament from the books that Paul wrote how that women are to dress modest oh yeah but we we we got greater understanding we got greater understanding than that well we we don't believe that applies no more that's why God cannot work with an organization if it ever gets to a spot that I or the deacons or the trustees or any other human being wants to be the head over this church instead of the word the Holy Ghost won't stay here we'll grieve him right away ain't that right amen so an organization then when people stay in that and have that if they're there when The Mercy Seat is taken from the earth the prophet said said come out of her Revelation 18:1 when that angel Mighty Angel come down from heaven and said come out of her my people so they cannot stay in organization and be bride or called to be an old brother don't there will be people that'll go out of the Catholic church that is a lie you show me that in the Bible oh but there'll be people that'll come out you show me that in the Bible and I'll sit down and let you finish these question answers but the Bible says come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins you see to be found in an organization once the Rapture takes place means that you are sealed with the mark of the beast what is that it's an image that's made un the original maybe somebody can ask me a question on that Revelation 138 revelation 178 because it's that's what organized religion is it's not a 666 up here on your hand and you know years ago whenever they started I remembered as a as a kid whenever they started putting the um barcodes and all that on groceries any all some of y'all old enough to even remember that but I remember even back in Kentucky people was afraid to buy their groceries if they had a barcode cuz they knew it was the market of the Beast well when computers come they were scared to death it was going to be that well you know now Bill Gates wants to put a a chip in everybody and people scared to death all know in Denmark I've already seen the videos of it in Denmark they've already got it your name your social security number your bank account everything slid right under right up here this part of your hand you go through you scam nobody can replicate you if you're anywhere in the world they can track you by satellites they know exactly where you are people scared to death it's the mark of the beast you know why Satan does that he puts up this false Mirage so it will scare people and he knows himself the mark of the beast is organized religion and he gets them all to join that but he puts this scarecrow up here this is the mark of the beast this is the mark of the be oh watch the computer oh don't never scan your hand oh no no no I scanned mine in Carol's passport yesterday from an app on my phone for New Zealand Transit and what that did was we been a US citizen we don't have to have a Visa but they do want an identification to just a pre-qualification to get you there so I took my passport held it up in my hand and I took my phone and lined it right up with the code down on the bottom and whenever it did it captured it pull my name up my address social security number then I held my phone up and it told me where to put it and took a picture of me I did Carol exactly the same way now if I would have had to went through Washington DC which I've done that before it can take weeks I got the notification today everything was fully processed now will Satan use that in the last days he will but your iPhone is not the mark of the beast and even if you're a Droid user poor old saying it ain't to Mark the Beast either what is it organized religion now watch Paul says that whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren who's the Rapture for the family of God Brothers and Sisters of the economy of God verse 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them them he also called whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified now this is what God has done to those who are in the for knowledge of God and predestinated them to eternal life oh brother Donnie won't want that many to be saved there will be millions of them saved CU do they love the Lord yes many of them love the Lord they love the Lord but loving the Lord and being bride is not the same thing now watch in Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now watch this according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now this is the sad part about many church members they actually think they're under the blood but they're not because they reject the way to get to the blood you see Satan has achieved a great thing and that he has separated the blood from the word so people get the blood the chemistry on their mind Jesus hanging on across cross why there's so many songs about the cross and the blood and we must have the blood yes we must have the blood but remember what bled was the word it was the word made flesh that was bleeding blood to wash the bride in but Satan has got most of the denominational people convinced that the blood and the word oh yeah I'm saved I'm a Christian I love God but what difference does it make how I dress and what difference does it make to God if a woman cuts her hair that that don't make no difference so you say what they do they separate the word from the blood oh I'm saved I've got everything I need I I just don't have to comply to all of that and who was it that told you that who was it that told you that that was not necessary it was not God now who was it so it was some man or some woman or some system that told you that it's not in the scripture so they think they're under the blood because oh Lord Jesus I I want to be saved oh Father save me oh praise God I feel better brother Donnie do they feel better yes my goodness how many people get saved they get saved but they don't have the Holy Ghost they're not born again you imagine when Jesus told Peter that day I'm going to tell you what's going to happen to you buddy before the car crows you're going to deny you even know me what what I can't what Jesus what John sure Josiah oh yeah I can see him do it any day Rob yeah Paul yeah these sisters of course me Jesus don't you know who I am I'm Simon Peter you're don't you remember you told me I had the keys to the kingdom I don't care what anybody else I'll never do it the Lord Jesus himself is standing there telling him he's so full of arrogance and he's so proud of who he thinks he is Jesus Christ is telling him and he will not even believe it before the crows Peter you're going to deny that you know me I will not do it I'll Stand By You Jesus just goes right on and ignores him he said Simon Simon Satan hath desired that he may have you that he may sift you as sweat but I have prayed for you that your face will not fail and you know what I find amazing is Peter failed but Peter's faith didn't Jesus didn't pray that Peter wouldn't fail but he prayed that his faith wouldn't and his faith never failed it and Jesus turns right around and says when you are converted now remember this man had preached for Years cast out Devils heal the sick his one the original 12 that Jesus sent out in Matthew 10 and when they come in they said Lord we saw Satan oh we we saw saw demons cast out we saw the sick heel and they come back rejoice and all praise God and notice what Jesus said about that Evangelistic tour he said I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as Lightning that's what them disciples had done pre Holy Ghost but they wasn't converted they accepted Jesus as their Savior Jesus actually baptized them in water Jesus baptized his own disciples so jesus takes them down and baptizes them in water ain't none of us got that testimony heavily so Jesus is talking to a saved Sanctified baptized Preacher Man and he tells him when you get converted Preacher Man strengthen your brothers wow so Peter was saved Sanctified Justified Sanctified had anointing preached cast out Devils but didn't have the Holy Ghost and preter Peter turned out to be a cussing preacher wow you remember that in the Bible he cursed he cursed what happened to his justification what happened to his water baptism ISM what happened to his sanctification flew out the window didn't it what happened to his great experience of casting out Devils he couldn't hold him he didn't have the Holy Ghost so let me say it so you'll be sure to understand no one no one no one without the Holy Ghost will go in the Rapture whether you go by the claim Baptist Methodist message tape only perusia seven Thunder perusia whatever you call yourself that's not what will get you in the Rapture it's whenever he sees the token displayed in our lives brother Donnie can people come out of the Baptist Church absolutely they can but they won't remain Baptist they won't remain Catholics they won't remain Pentecostals that's the problem with some they come out of the Baptist Church for years and years and set in a message church and then they decide they don't want the message in its pure form and then they leave and go right back or go to some hybrid type of a deal and then they find out they really didn't want it and its pure form they wanted in a hybrid form as a man like to run over me today when I was at Lowe's in the parking lot he backed out and I noticed on the rear of his car it was getting quite close to me and I was reading and it was a Tesla and I was reading on the rear of his car and it said dual motor I thought I know a lot of Christians like that you know that they're dual motors so I mean I I finally had to move because the man was going to run me over but every person who goes in the Rapture must have the Holy Ghost just to be a Christian is not enough to come to our church is not enough to say you believe God sent a prophet is not enough or you say brother Donnie I I believe every word brother brandham said and I'll quote back to you what brother Bram said oh brother brandham you say I you say I believe every word you said he said that's just being able to read so you see a person can believe it from here and not believe it here how many of you have listen to ever tape brother Brennon preached anybody 1149 I think might be 1153 now cuz they found a few more anybody listen to every one of them anybody read every book of the Bible I know some of you have you some of you reread your Bible several times that's good that's wonderful that don't mean you got the Holy Ghost and there may be things that you'll listen to a tape tomorrow pick up a book and it oh you'll have the offest time with it ever was oh goodness you just that oh man and you say I believe every word he said what you mean is you believe every word so far that you've heard him say but the Holy Ghost knows that after tomorrow you'll be listening to another tape and you'll hear something it's going to Scorch you like and hit you it's going to boy it's going to burn you up but the Holy Ghost in you will say Amen help me Lord help me right but if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you'll say no oh now wait a minute uh well that that might just been the man part well you know I I don't know that I need that part after all we're Sovereign in our church so what we claim you know that's such well a lot of folks are doing the day that we're living they want to claim sovereignty when they want exemption from certain doctrines in the message it's going around the world what if that one thing you're claiming sovereignty from is the Capstone of your life and you claim sovereignty and you say I really don't need that and Jesus sent that word to you to see will you accept that word too oh my goodness preach it brother Donnie I will now let's go on was it fair so what I'm going to do now is in asking this question I'm going to ask you all some questions but I'm actually going to ask you the questions I am going to give you the answer so don't worry about having to answer was it fair that God chose Abraham over all the rest of the people of the Earth was it fair now in the way that we would say fair but keep in mind now he's the one that's giving out grace and mercy so it's his right any of your brothers like a shirt I've got on tonight this anybody like this caller you like it you like it you like it okay okay so now this is my shirt somebody bought it and gave it to me so it would be fair for me to give my shirt to either one of these brothers now the brothers that wanted it are nodding their heads yes the rest of you just sitting there looking would that be fair would that be okay would that be fair this is my shirt so can I give it to one one of these brothers would you all think that's fair or would you say brother Donnie that ain't fair you can't give what who give you any say over what I do with my shirt praise the Lord Genesis 17:3 and Abram fell on his face now this is before his name is changed to Abram Abraham and God talked with him saying as for me this is God talking behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shal be a father of many nations and you know what's amazing about this God never even ask him God never even said now I tell you what I I've got this I've got this deal I'd like to make you know what do you think I I'd like to do this and this and this but I'm waiting on you to tell me God never even asked him he said as for me my Covenant is with you God never even waited for a response God never even waited for an amen God just said like it or lump it I'm your God like it or lump it you're my choice well you're going to be a nut if you lump it so what did Abraham do I like it I like it I like it God thank you thank you but how many more millions of people were on the face of the Earth and God only said this to one man now you see if we can ever find traits and characteristics of the Eternal then we know he does not change so again I ask you another question was it fair that God chose Isaac and not Ishmael Genesis 1719 and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and deed and thou shalt call his name laughter which is what I Isaac means laughter and I will establish my Covenant with him now remember Sarah has not even conceived him yet so where is free moral agency you mean to tell me God is making this Covenant this boy is not even conceived in his mother's womb and God is saying oh yeah just let me tell you your wife going to have a boy and let me tell you what his name is going to be his name is going to be Isaac and let me also tell you what his Destiny is he's my choice I choose him before he's even born when I went minut what about free more agency no wait a minute God wait a minute well what if he don't want to serve you he will want to serve me I saw to it before the foundation of the world I predestinated him to love me that ought to make a presbyterian want to shout praise God I ordained him to serve me brother Donnie can God do that he can because Grace is his Mercy is his you imagine God telling Jeremiah before you were formed in your mother's womb I ordained you to be a prophet to the Nations oh my goodness one of the hardest jobs of the Old Testament and God never even asked him now how fair is that does that seem fair to you Jeremiah always felt so sorry for it he was one of the most hated prophets you haven't read the book of Jeremiah you should he was one of the most hated Prophets and God demanded so much of this man God required so much of him I can't wait to see him he went through so much stuff and God never even asked him hey I was thinking about making you a prophet what do you think God never even asked him God just told him you are going to be a prophet it ain't multiple choice is it can I have your permission God just said I don't want your permission I don't need your permission I ordained you to do this and you're going to do it right and Jeremiah's going to say right right but you know what he also said when he got burdened down and he got under such distress he said I made up my mind I wouldn't speaking no more in the name of the Lord but he said his word was shut up like fire in my bones I couldn't keep from speaking I had to prophesy so what was that that overpowered his human will prophetic utterance from God I ordained you to be a prophet I ordained you hope you understand what I'm going to say I've had it happen to me many of times when I made up my mind God I ain't never I ain't never told God God I I'm going to quit serving you you know I know people go through that I never have my problem has not been me going to quit serving God my problem has been the the ministry part that's what I said oh God why' you call me to be a preacher what you say brother Donnie how could you do that Harry sent me a quote the other day where brother Brandon was talking about mey and he said he told mey he said mey I'm just so discouraged I'm just so down I don't even know if God even called me to preach you imagine a prophet she said Bill shut up shut up God called you to preach Oh Praise God you imagine tell Elijah to shut up but I guess even sometimes Elijah needs to shut up but what is it don't you understand you may not be a preacher but don't you understand when you come to that spot that you think you can't make it and you made up your mind I'm quitting I'm turning my back on God and something down on the inside gets a hold of you and say you ain't doing it you ain't doing it you ought to thank God for that you know what it is it's your election it's your predestination our Humanity would have given up no doubt many times but the same God that called Jeremiah called you praise the Lord now notice God said I would establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him so God designates the man Isaac and God designates his seed and as for Ishmael anybody know what his name means look at his name i s h m a e l the two last letters of his name are the name of God L God eel God heard his mother so his name is a derivative of God hears so this boy has part of the name of God in his name Isaac doesn't Isaac name is laughter why cuz Abraham laughed and Sarah laughed so God said all right I'll name your boy after what you all done yall laughed I call him laughter but look at Isel his name is more spiritual more scriptural than Isaac's is but God does not make his Covenant with Ishmael now notice what he's going to do for Ishmael I have heard thee because Abraham said Lord what about Ishmael what about isma God said all right I've heard you I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beget and I will make him a great nation and what's absolutely amazing is when you study the genealogy of these 12 princes you will find the 12 princes of Ishmael actually get their inheritance years before the 12 sons that come out of Jacob did so ishmail was a type of organized religion so here they get their position in the worldly goods and remember when the children of Israel was down in the land of Egypt they were already enjoying their inheritance and when they come out and they go to cross near the property God said said hey y'all leave that alone don't you take that that belongs to them organizations you leave them alone now are we here to damn them and to say oh yeah no no no no no they've got their part they've got their part but can they ever take the bride's part no and can the bride take their part no who puts them in this difference of designation God does it was not Ishmael and Isaac and they were throwing dice one day and God said all right whoever gets a three and a two that's the one that I'll choose for mine all right whoever gets a six and a six I'll give them blessings no that wasn't the way that it happened God said I choose Isaac and Abraham says but what about my other boy what about my other boy God says all right all right I've heard you I'll make him a mighty nation I'll give him 12 princes I'll give him this and that and the other but if you if you study on the ishmaelites and you study on the sons of coutura which was Abraham's second wife after the death of Sarah you'll find out anybody know who the those people are they're the people from Saudi Arabia Iran Iraq Libya turkey they are the people down Through the Ages that have persecuted the Jews Israel today is surrounded by some of the ishmaelites the Saudi Arabians all of those who mainly are Muslim people and yet they have the same Father Abraham anybody ever read the Quran ever seen one anybody got one well I've got one I've read it now the Quran of course is the muslim's replacement to the Bible in the Bible bble God chose Isaac over Ishmael so the Muslims needed another Bible they needed another Bible so their Prophet says that the angel Gabriel came to him and other angels and different times of visitation and he wrote down the Holy Quran as they call it and in the Quran it is ishma that is God's choice not Isaac so they couldn't stick with the Bible so what they do they wrote thems a new Bible to misplace Isaac and his seat after him so Archaeology is still digging and finding they just found recently some things that dates back to David I saw the seal the other day of the seal and the the time of Jeremiah one of the scribes that was alive in the time of Jeremiah they found it in the original steps that had been dug out by Solomon fell down through the crack and it was laying right there and it was the Seal of Baro b a r u c h find that name in the book of Jeremiah the book of Lamentations and they they proved it over and over again that the Jews were there before Islam ever even was birthed but what do they want look at Ramadan going to begin what 2 three days something like that the Jews are thinking it's going to be it goes on for a month supposed to be a holy month a month of rest a month of Peace but they're afraid that the Palestinians and the Hamas and all this sort of thing is going to use it as a time of rebellion watch them watch the Jews look at the world look at the bride you'll see a great parallel the demons even have some sort of insight to who the elect are watch who they persecute watch who they fight watch who they stand against now remember in the fourth dimension where prophets saw their Visions they would not just see sickness and things like that but brother random would actually see streaks of Darkness that would come from people and he would see streaks of light and he would say you're a Christian because it's light around you now a person may have cancer standing on the platform someone sitting back here would have cancer this demon inside this person's body would communicate to that demon inside that person's body and them demons were talking back and forth and it would leave a tra as it were of Blackness and darkness and he would see it so this devil here would tell on that devil there but they were afraid because of that gift in his life he said can't you hear them they're screaming they're afraid they're scared they're trying to get unbelief gathered the battle is Raging unbelief is gathering faith is here which way will it go brother brandham he said according to the way you believe that happens every time we come to church so this war is going on the church natural they don't have a clue what the spiritual bride grows there they couldn't endure A month's worth of the bride's trials that don't mean that there won't be some of them that will be saved this is the group that will come out of Great Tribulation and they will stand there and be judged before the Judgment seat and I saw the Books open and another book was open which was the book of life and I saw the dead both small and great stand before God and when these books were open then they were judged out of the things that was written in the books concerning their deeds I'll tell you one thing I would never want to stand before him in that way would you would any of you here tonight want to stand before God and what you have to try to justify you is well you prayed so many times and and you paid your TI and you give an offering and and you you sent a text the other day to somebody to try to encourage them and and and you went to church sometimes you w't always faithful there um and and you you read your Bible occasionally and that's what you've got to say on your behalf oh Lord but when the bride stands before him the bride don't stand before the white Throne why she has already been accepted in the Beloved now the sad part about it is many church people think they're accepted too but if they are why will they be left behind in the Rapture and if they bride why don't they dress like bride why don't they act like bride we'll get to it this week and I want to close on on Sunday Lord willing part of the wedding vow that was said when a groom would take the bride a Jewish groom and he would marry a Jewish bride he would say these words be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel now this is what the groom would say be thou s Sanctified speaking to the bride be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel now the word Sanctified was cleaned set apart in other words he's saying to her don't you know any other man don't you have any other man to be your head don't you have any any other man that's going to dictate to you and lead you and guide you you are cadesh you are set apart to me you are Sanctified to me but the majority of the leodan churches aren't even Sanctified in the way they dress they're not even Sanctified in the movies they watch or the music that they listen to they're not set apart they're not Sanctified and remember if we are part of the Bride then we are priests so priests could not just walk into the presence of God with the attire that they chose they could not walk into the presence of God with just you know any kind of behavior anything they wanted God told them beforehand you wear this and this this and this and this and if you don't if you dare walk in my presence without this I'm telling you ahead of time I will kill you I will kill you so if God says to the church I don't want you dressing like the world I don't want you acting like the world I want you to be sanctified unto me but the church say I'm not doing that I don't care what they say ain't nobody telling me how to dress will you see what you're doing you're telling Jesus don't you tell me how to live don't you tell me how to dress so that proves you're not Sanctified you're not set apart to walk with God we have to be s sanctify don't you love him let's bow our heads oh Heavenly Father we count it such an honor Lord Jesus that we have been called by you father we are thankful for every name that the spirit of God has called since the shedding of the blood 2,000 years ago we are so grateful that the mercy of God was so abundant that you wouldn't just call from the Lamb's Book of Life but you would also call from The Book of Life we know that the Lamb's Book of Life is that Personal Diary as it was the elect names are in that portion of the book and no names can ever be blotted out of the Lamb's Book but we know that na names according to the scripture can be blotted out or removed from the book of life and there will be people who were saved and people who went to church and done this and that and the other and yet you give us the example in Matthew 25 when they will be judged and also in the Book of Revelation and they will be judged Matthew 24 again they cast out Devils heal the sick done many signs and wonders and their name will be taken out of the book of life so that's people who said they knew you and they did know a portion of your grace oh Jesus if there's one young person here tonight father father that does not have the token the Holy Ghost Lord God I pray that you'd visit us here Lord we thank you for the shedding of the blood at the cross we thank you for your Resurrection on that Sunday morning we're so grateful for it but we know Lord God the Holy Spirit himself must come back that is the abstract to the titled deed that gives the clearance on our soul that everything that was against us is blotted out so it's not enough to be a good Baptist or a good Methodist or a good message believer we must be filled with the Holy Ghost Paul comes in the book of Ephesians and says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption when Paul comes into the upper coast of Ephesus and he finds certain disciples there and he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said we've not heard so much that there was any Holy Ghost this is so sad because they were following John the Baptist teachings John's mother had the Holy Ghost John's father had the Holy Ghost and John had the Holy Ghost before he was born and they hadn't even heard of it so here they were following the prophet John or so they thought and they hadn't even heard about what he got when he was in his mother's womb how much longer will it be before some of our message people won't even know what the Holy Ghost is they won't even know if they've got it or if they don't help us Lord not to console ourselves and try to hide and say well I I believe God sent a prophet that ain't enough the token must be displayed himself oh Jesus if there's a young person here tonight and they love you they felt the call upon their heart but they've got things in their life that they know is not right they've got besetting sins and something struck them when I said that about being Sanctified and set apart Lord God may they realize you're here tonight to help them with that I wouldn't want my wife Carol calling up some other brother on the phone and flirting with him I wouldn't want her meeting some of these brothers after church or some of these young brothers and inviting them hey brother how would you like to meet me tomorrow at chili how would you like to meet me tomorrow at Red Lobster and we'll sit and fellowship about the Lord of course Carol wouldn't do that she ain't that type of person but you don't want your wife either flirting with the world you don't want your wife telling you I don't believe what you say about ha I don't believe what you say about dress I want you to know Jesus I just don't believe it and and if you're going to be that way I don't want Heaven oh how that must break your heart when church people tell you that but oh Jesus the bride says teach me Lord you're my husband You're My Redeemer you're everything to me if there's anything in my life that displeases you show me Lord show me Hal Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah for the Lord Jesus is still making the bridal call he's not saying it like a Jewish man would be thou Sanctified unto me according to the law of Moses and of Israel but rather he may say something like this be thou Sanctified unto me by my name by my baptism by my word by my spirit be thou Sanctified unto me my bride have no other head have no other leader even if your pastor leaves the word you leave him for me you leave your favorite preacher you leave your favorite YouTube guy if he leaves the word you leave all men for me if they leave my word hallelujah how many of us will stand our feet tonight and just raise our hand and say Lord let me be Sanctified unto [Music] you what about it young men young women most of you are single there's a few of you that I see tonight are married but with any of you brothers that are married would you want your wife calling men texting men my goodness you wouldn't even want something like that if nothing more than that happened of course you wouldn't you would feel like there was a disloyalty there neither does Jesus want us texting the devil as we would say he don't want us making no date with the devil or with sin or with an element of unbelief and fear no no and his bride a't want to do that Jesus wants you texting him only Jesus wants you all your instant messages being to him all the communications that he have and Jesus can take your phone spiritual phone I'm talking about now Jesus can take your spiritual phone any day cuz he knows your passcode he knows every corner of your life Carol can check my phone I can check hers we know each other's passcode she has the Liberty at any time to check any email any text any communication I get from anyone around the world I have nothing to hide from her I'm the same with her I can take her phone I can look at her s her history I can look at where she's searched I can look at her browser her whatever I want to why cuz she loves me she's Sanctified unto me praise God can you let Jesus look at your browser can you let Jesus look at your homepage Let Jesus look at your Facebook Let Jesus look at Instagram and you post nothing that he'd be ashamed of pra praise God I say it in these terms so you can relate to it oh Hallelujah young people these are the type of people that are going in the Rapture not the type of people that invite Jesus into the front door of their life and say I want you to save me from hell I want you to forgive me from my sins but you are not allowed to move out of the living room you can come and you can sit in the couch you can sit in the recliner you are not allowed in the kitchen you are not allowed to look in the refrigerator you are not allowed in my bedroom you are not allowed on my laptop don't you dare pick up my phone or my iPad but I want you here to save me I want you here to keep me out of hell I want you to give me some peace but don't you go to nosing around in the rest of my house if you have that attitude tonight toward him you're not in Bride mentality cuz the bride invites him in the front door into the front room and once Jesus saves her the bride invites him to the dining room so they can sit there and eat together brother BR said you live in a three- room house then she invites him to the Parlor where you can sit there and fellowship what about it young people invite Jesus into those three rooms in your house kitchen where you eat living room where you Fellowship and then what does the bride do she invites him to the bedroom because she's married to him what for procreation the extension of his own image to be reflected in her but the church keeps Jesus in the living room while she takes other lovers into the kitchen and other lovers into every other room of her house worldly music ungodly things in her life dominates her bedroom dominates her dining room and Jesus is sitting in the living room chained to a chair oh but don't you want to give Jesus permission to go into every room of your house is there anybody here with me tonight that would would say Jesus my whole house is open to you my living room my kitchen my bedroom my dining room Lord my basement downstairs where I spend a lot of time listen to tapes and listen to music it's open to you Lord I know you feel welcome there because you meet me there so often and I thank you for that oh Jesus may your presence touch each heart here
