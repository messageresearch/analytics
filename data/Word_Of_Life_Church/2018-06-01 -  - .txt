night when he laid down I wonder what he fell now have you ever thought about that I wonder what he was thinking that he I wonder if he went by and looked up on the hill and then I got to thinking I wonder if he felt what I felt that afternoon in Jonesboro Tennessee in an old building when I knelt down here by myself and that feeling I felt when I got up I was free no more alcohol no more drugs I was free the man in the middle made me free have I failed him yes I have a failure but he's not one time ever failed me well Kate you loved him for that tonight praise the Lord if you have your Bibles to see the tert with us to the we only read from the book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 10 and then also from Psalms 68 verse 20 the Gooch in the name of the Lord Jesus and kind of honored to be here this evening remember our sick and afflicted and just trust the Lord Jesus the move for my brother different ones in the hospital right now and we serve a God who's certainly able amen praise the Lord that some gun Ephesians 1 verse 10 and then we're gonna read from Psalms 68 20 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him even in him now Psalms 68 20 the Bible says this he that is our God is the god of salvation he maybe won't be old Buddha sitting on the throne it won't be hairy Krishna come on somebody won't be some Islamic he that is our God is the god of salvation and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death unto our God belong the issues from death now that word issues means escape in other words unto our God belongs the escape from death he owns it hallelujah let's bow our heads Heavenly Father How Great Thou art I will just worship you to naught and magnify your name and O Lord we're just so grateful for the man in the middle Lord I was the Barabbas you took my place Lord and you set me free and I thank you for that tonight dear God the Lord may you just come and open the word to our hearts God that we could see our our a little more clearer God that we could see the urgency of the moment that we're living in dear god and father may we see what's been provided for us Lord and may we quickly receive it Lord and run to it father and receive the benefits of it Lord we pray for father we live in a dark hour trouble sometime as brother Jean said in his prayer Lord but father is no surprise to us you said these things would be here Lord you said it would be that way dear God so what do we see we're just seeing the manifestation of the word of God for this our Lord and if they are fulfilling their part there's another people of the earth whose Commission to fulfill their part dear God and we are the light of the evening time Lord Oh God but it strike hold to us tonight father may we receive Lord the benefits that's been given to us by Calvary for every diptych blessing was paid for at Calvary and his blows in his place in the hand of the believers in height Olga we use it Lord we exercise our rights as believers to take hold tonight Lord above the sickness that reflects your people and say Satan no more in the name of Jesus Christ take your hands for God's people loose them tonight for the glory of God or father may you come through the building that I search our hearts Lord search our lives lord may we be ready against that our Lord for the time is at hand bless your children or the little bride around the world God but you do wonderful things tonight maybe it'd be great testimonies tomorrow but because you are our God the god of our salvation and to you belongs the issues of death God how we thank you for it tonight Lord we commit this service into your hands for your glory for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says it may God bless you Saints you may be seated hallelujah thank you me was that song hey hey man hallelujah you know I went through a local drive-thru here the other day and I dropped Cheryl off it sounds to get some stuff for the for the wedding and I went through the drive-thru and got some food while she was getting stuff at Sam's and went back to pick her up and when I come around through the drive-through there to place my order I guess maybe the speaker was out I don't know but they were some attendants out there with a little iPad and they were taking orders and so I pulled up you know to where the person was and I and I greeted him and said how do you do and they said how you doing and actually recognized him I knew these people and so as they were there and I was putting in my order telling them what I wanted you know all of a sudden it was just a few drops of rain beginning to fall him it wasn't really raining but it was just a drop here and a drop there and just enough you know a splat that would get your attention that the that a water drop it fell and I said my it looks like it's going to rain I said I hope you don't get wet and the person taking my order said this to me they said I hope I can be like Noah and get inside before the rain comes [Applause] and I said to this person me too [Music] and the reason I said that was that the person taking order was a young person that used to come to our church I won't speak to you tonight for just a few minutes on getting inside before it rains or for the tape as I told the brothers gathering to escape gathering to escape you see a gathering is always a reaction to an action people don't just gather there's always a reason why somebody gathers for church for a wedding for a funeral whatever it would be so we see them that a gathering is that actually a reaction because something has caused a gathering you know this September I will be on the field evangelizing 29 years the Lord spoke to me back when I was turned thirty year old I was 29 at the time and I felt like the Lord spoke to me one day and said when you turn 30 you'll start traveling and when I turned 30 year old the first place I went was down in Beaufort South Carolina and preached for brother John Keith and from there it kind of developed to where we're at tonight but 29 years on the field evangelizing 19 years this June full-time and I stand humbly not to brag on myself I just want to make a point but I was going 166 days from home last year you know in 29 years on the field you get a little sentimental I guess and I was driving down through Missouri the other day and I got to thinking about all the meetings that I've had in Missouri down through the years as a as a young man 31 32 year old brother David Siler bosom buddy he used to follow me over it's just a young boy come to all my meetings down in Missouri up down into Arkansas I know David for years Wayne Lawson knew he went as a boy and I got to thinking about all the meetings brother Jean and I got to thinking about all the different brothers and sisters that I had seen in those meetings you know the potluck sector service was over and set around the table and just fellowship and and I begin to think this brother is gone and that sister is gone and that brother's gone and as I was thinking about these things I thought all what I wouldn't give to go back would tub and to being one of them services again it's the me that brother Leon Wilson's I loved that precious brother he's been dead for years I I was there the night he died I used to go down he was old have you Mississippi accent no brother Leon you know he used to say brother walk come down here to the multi-purpose building and I thought what I wouldn't give to go back to the multi-purpose building just one more time but you see change his heart how wonderful it would be but you see it'll never be for the Bible says here we have no continuing City those days are gone those meetings are in the history books if you will we can never gather back like that again the multi-purpose building it don't even exist them or that whole thing is going now and so we can never gather back again to the multi-purpose building but there is the place hallelujah what we all can gather together what will never have to part and that is in him that is in Christ there's going to be a meeting in the air and we'll never have to part again you see I'm talking about gathering gathering in him an action a reaction to an action I you know one of my favorite characters in history it's Geronimo you know I've read his autobiography and I'm you know brother man said he was a real gentleman only fighting for his god-given rights and Geronimo in his autobiography talked about how he was down at the market one day and all the way back from the market they was met with some runners who told him that the Mexicans had attacked the village while he was down at the market they had come into the village and had killed all the women and the children and the old men and he said when I heard the news that the village had been attacked he said I found that my aged mother and my wife and my three little girls were all among the dead they had all been slain and Geronimo said there were no lights in the camp so without being noticed he said I silently turned away and stood down by the river it said how long yesterday I do not know because she said I had no purpose left in my life everything had been tooken away from me I didn't care if I lived or if I died said how long I stood there I do not know he said but when I saw the Warriors arranging for Council Geronimo said I took my place I gathered around the council fire with the rest of the Warriors and when it comes to make the move when it comes to do a retaliation when it comes to strike back against the Mexicans who done this to his people he said I gathered with the lawyers and I found my place among them brother Brennan talked about the mages that they were stargazers and they watched the heavens for the sign of the Messiah to manifest and the prophets said they worshiped the one true God and so they would go up on the rooftop and they would build a fire because they knew that that was true God dwelled in fire and they would gather their self around the sacred fire watching and waiting for a sign of the Messiah waiting for God to move they would gather around the sacred fire you see something was causing them to gather geronimo of the Warriors were gathering for revenge they were gathering for stargazers to see the sign of the Messiah to see God move and I say to you I don't know where you're at tonight I don't know what you're living at tonight I don't know what your plans are for the future I don't even know what you think about this message tonight but what I want to say to everybody who hears my voice tonight I want you to understand whatever your plans are brother sister I want you to know it's gathering time [Applause] and when you see God's people begin to gather around and unite the self around the pillar of fire when you see God's people fighting the Saints around the sacred fire of God the Holy Spirit manifests in the midst of the people I tell you find your place find your place around the fire of God because it's moving time the Prophet talked about mother Eagle and how she took her little ones and set them down into a field and flew high up on the cliff of a rock had said him and the Prophet was watching through binoculars and he wants those little Eagles he said ma what did you believe they were having when I listened to him describe this I thought I'd like to be in a church service like that they were just jumping over one another they were chirping they were happy you know I don't know why people scared of noise in church I don't understand why people scared of noise in church her brother injuries say it one time and I was down in Florida actually saw it myself but there's a sign down there the people at the in Florida around the local air force base were complaining about the f-18s in the 16s and all the noise that they make there's one fluid the house still they rattled the windows and they were flying and the people were complaining about the noise and they wanted it to stop so the Air Force put up a big sign at the gate said pardon our noise but it's the sound of freedom hallelujah when you're afraid if I go to church somebody might scream well part in our scream part in our shell father hallelujah but it's the sound of freedom paranoia the blood of Jesus Christ has made us free no more condemnation it's under the blood they were jumping and frolicking having a big time and the Prophet was watching him they said all that was way off in the North said a northerner started thundering the Thunder begin to roar he said I watched that mother he goes to she threw up that head she began to look said she let out a scream and come off that rock and flew down into that grassy field and stretched forth her wings and he said perhaps the little ones being instructed before they left the nest she must have told him in case you need to escape this is what you do she was giving it all she was giving them instructions how to get out of the field safely and he said perhaps been instructed before they left the news that here they come running and he said they grabbed a hold of those calls grabbed a hold of their weeds look they're beak into those feathers and he said she lifted off that metal with all those little Eagles on her back flew straight into a storm that was blowing 40 mile an hour the Prophet God said I cried like a baby because he said I thought someday he'll come from glory he'll stretch forth his wings Luther knows his place Wesley knows his place hallelujah we know our place each of us being instructed hallelujah by the revealed Word of God for our day we know exactly where we are exactly where we need to be [Applause] hallelujah and we'll grab a hold of the wings of Jehovah and he lifts us into glory [Applause] gathering to escape gathering to escape the purposes were coming down to the gathering time the harvest time Genesis was the planning of the seed and for six thousand years has been maturing of the harvest and now the seed has become seed itself the seed has become seen itself but it didn't go back this way it went full circle in other words it went through its cycle of growth that was a predetermined cycle for a wheat plant that she would plant it and it would go through its cycle and when it got to the final stage of growth it would be the maturity stage and how do you know that its mature because its seed again you see if the farmer harvest is any other time prior to having seed he can never have another crop so he must wait in love for the seed that was planted to go full cycle of growth and when it reaches a level when will he take this bride when she reaches a level of maturity that she can reproduce him of the earth again hallelujah but what is he coming for a bride who is bone of his bone flesh of his legs spirit of the spirit life of his life she is he loved the earth hallelujah it's seed time again it's see time again what's happening the seed it's coming to maturity now the seed has become seen itself he went back so the blossom from the blossom to the fruit in this gathering time now harvest time now all the great things that started the true church has started in Genesis has come down to the fruit town the fruit of the Spirit let me tell you something this bride will not be a barren bride she will not be a fig tree who bears no fruit come on somebody but she will bear and manifest the fruit of the Spirit hallelujah the Antichrist spirit has started the genesis has come down to its fruit and we're just now in the closing time of the world's entire dispensation of mortal beings everything is dying around us including our government [Music] [Applause] and yet the Prophet said it's the greatest time that anyone or any age ever lived is this time for brother though it's so dark it's so gloomy it's so cold the people are so hard hello it's a wonderful time it's a great time because the Bible said they would do that but when they are doing that they are a people on the earth who is the light of the other and they are manifested Alleluia they are manifested the life of Christ the greatest age can ever live here is this day God has given us the privilege to live in the greatest time it's a shakin time it's a troublesome time for sinners but it's a marvelous time for Christians because we know we are packing up giving the last little things together to go home to meet the Lord it's one of the most horrible times for the unbeliever and the sinner that he has ever witnessed because the due time is close at hand and it's the most blessed time for the believer the worst time for the sinner the blessed time for the believer and it's happening at the same time it's the most blessed time for the believer for the redemption is at hand the two factions is in the earth tonight the believer and the unbeliever the one the Lord is coming to receive and the one the Lord is coming to condemn and is coming he is coming he will do both at the same time he will receive one and condemn the other at the same time he will bless one and curse the other and his appearing so then we see we are at the gathering time it's sea time or harvest time the seed that was planted has come full cycle and now it's seed time again making him Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end the first and the last [Applause] it's the gathering time it's the gathering time because that's the only time for the theory that he can take her is in this season the season of the harvest the season of maturity the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 see that's why revelations Oh true life that was in the stalk tassel and husk is now gathering in the seed no see see brother Jean I'll Luthor head Leslie god bless all Leslie head and it comes on down now we are the fullness the seven churches is the fullness of the previous six Church ages we are the consummation of Luther Wesley restoration of the gifts it's all come down to the seat on the seat chapter the harvest and and all that revelation all that life is now in her hallelujah manifesting what the fullness all glory to God now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the harvest the Alpha has become the omega the groom has become the blood they lujah the first has come last and the last is first the seed that we're in has come through a process that has become seed again jesus said that be fearful signs in the heavens we got him they call him UFOs the Prophet said they were investigating angels fearful sights in the heavens man's hearts failing for fear perplexity of times distress between nations sounds like evening news it foxes don't you see he says the seed time is here now [Applause] harvest time the things the Bible said would come to place the seed that's been planted don't you see it it's taken life the seed that was planted it's taking life and it's living it's living it's living you see it's the seed taking life that's what's causing the gathering [Applause] the reaction of an action it's moving time there's no question it's moving time that's not the question the question tonight is what are you gathering - its gathering time it's moving time that's a given we there's no use there's no debate on that but the real question is is what are you gathering - because you see every person in this building man woman boy girl you don't matter every one of us must gather to something because it's gathering time you see friends don't you see that's why they said among us for years by the genes for years they said among us they live singing in our churches but where are they tonight they're going they went out from us because they were not a part of us they are gathering to the room they are gathering to the road but we are also gathering it's gathering time gathering to escape you see that sign right there above the door that is a lighted exit son they are markers to tell us in case of an emergency how did scape how to get out of this building if you need to leave quickly if we need to escape if we need to get out these signs these lighted exit signs show us the well let's say that I said humbly God knows I do but I flew a hundred eleven thousand air miles last year and every flight I was ever owned they gave the emergency whatever that's called thank you and they'll stand out there two exits at the back two in the middle two here and look behind you the exit behind you might be the closest exit loving any lights in the aisle will instruct you on how to get out and if you're sitting at the exit door you have to read the card to tell you how to open the door but worried about me opening that probably remember it but you know what I see on those flights same thing you see if you've ever flew people looking at magazines people send the text people with their earbuds in people looking at their iPads nobody pays attention nobody listens to what that poor woman says and she has to do it every flight do you know why they don't listen you know why they don't look up you know why they don't look for the exit sign because they don't think they need it but I saw just last week where a window blew out of the plane and about shut the copilot out I'd say somebody was looking for the exit sign [Applause] they don't pay attention people don't pay attention in church they'll laugh and get notes and get up and go to the bathroom 57 times in one service you know why they don't think they need to hear what's being said but let a fire break out let us shoot or cut into the church get on somebody let an emergency break out now all of a sudden everybody trying to find the exit but a lot of times it's too late the chaos is on them the destruction is on them it's only those who are prepared against the hour will escape did you see the news the other day in Hawaii where some guy pushed the wrong button of course he's looking for a job but he pushed the wrong button and everybody started getting text imminent nuclear warhead airstrike 13 minutes to impact this is not a drill whoa 13 minutes to impact this is not a drill y'all hear that is anything people ran into the streets screaming people ran into churches people ran into the police station they ran into hospitals people called their kids and said hey you know that was vacation to learn Hawaii after laying on the beach and they called the game daddy wants to do what we're getting won't see you no more people screaming people crying people hugging one another people running not knowing where to go 13 minutes back what would you do tonight if you knew you had exactly 13 minutes to live and yet before the service is over thousands of people will die in the United States thirteen minutes running into a church but it was too late the church could not help them the police could not help them they were trying to find a place themselves but you see it was fake it wasn't real it was a mistake but the point I'm making is when it's trucked in the realization I'm fixing to be destroyed they were not ready like in the days of Noah with Noah predicted 120 years and though his message was a message of mercy the people failed to heed the message it was something that was said to save them and yet they would not listen that's a very beautiful picture of the times of today how could you say beautiful brother branham painting the pictures less like that he said it's beautiful because the Lord Jesus is coming soon for his church it's the most beautiful felt than any creature of God's could ever think of to get out of this chaos to get into the Blessed glory where the old will be young forever and the sick will be healed forever there'll be no more sorrows no more heartaches if that ain't the most beautiful picture I can think how blessed it is for those who are waiting for that gathering time it's beautiful what makes it so beautiful is because in that time of judgment there was a door and escape it was in the earth that God had provided under our God the god of salvation belongs the escape from death our God owns the escape route the exit don't you see who the exit lighted sign is it's Christ I am the light of the world he said I am the way the truth and the life I am the door I am the door that time of judgment what did God provide for them he provided for them an escape route an escape door he was in the art that God had provided and to her God belongs the escape from their God turned for those who care to escape in the days of Noah and they sent them a profit and that profit directed them to God's provided way God's Way of doing things God spoke to know and told Noah to prepare the ark for the saving of his people to warn all the people in the end one way of salvation one way not three not five what I'm gonna do it my own way I really to a guy on the airport deal they used to be in this message he tried to explain to me his way of salvation not only was that confused he was confused that's my way he said that's the way I think it is but if they don't line up with the word it's not our way [Applause] nor will prepare the ark in a man was a vindicated prophet to prove the way of escape humble and sincere heard this man heard him that escaped the death of the world of sin the world was being destroyed in that day they escaped the death threat that was laying upon the whole world God so came for them when the world was on the death row the whole world he said my spirit what I always strive with man and the whole world was on a death row but God cared for those who came to escape thank God provided an escape route God provided an exit sign God provided an escape door for those who wanted to leave the pool was so great I want you to think about this I'll hurry but the pool is so great - even the animals know that something was wrong the pool the pool to escape was so great that even the animals felt the pool prophet said I see old mother bird sent a pair father bird just singing away and the first clap of thunder began and lightness zigzagged across the sky and I can hear father bird say to mother bird come on dear let's head right straight to the ark that's exactly what Noah said was going to happen that's the Spirit of God moving in us let's go to the ark dear let's go to the org I can see old mother Campbell out there eating on the side of the hill father camel over here where was the first boat of light and went through the sky and the signs and wonders begin to appear the signs and wonders begin to appear I can hear father camel say to mother camel come on mom that's it something's tugging on the inside of here something's moving me I've got to get to the Ark let me tell you if you feel that bull if you feel that bull I say to you tonight run something's moving me I've got to get into the ark I said I tell you God had ordained that they would come into the ark what was happening they were gathering to escape they were gathering to escape where were they gathering act in the door of the Ark the narrow way that led into the art What did he say I've said before you an open door Strait is the gate and narrow is the way and the field that'll be that I find it for broad is the way that leads to destruction [Music] what were they being led to what were they being draw to a narrow opening in the side of the arc the escape route one generation owner out to death the others were on a route to escape you see there were two gatherings one being led by God was gathering in the ark and one group gathering on the outside of the ark two gatherings one was gathering in for safety the other was gathering on the outside bulking and laughing but don't fail to get this the same message the same message gathered both of them there [Applause] there's not another message but it's not another way this is the way don't you see the very message you say you can't live will condemn you the very message not another that's not one for the badness of one for the Catholics it will come on somebody there's one message there's one god there's one way there's one faith the same message brother - the same message caused both people both groups together one for escape one for destruction what did God say he said I will laugh at you in that day for a pipe and you were not dead I called and you gave me no answer what's he gonna do hog-tie stow us in what she got to do to convince us this is the way out we are gathering to escape what did he do to them just look at it for a minute what did he do he send a message indicating the light of profit with the meltem don't you see he's done the same thing to us the outside Balkan ain't no damn North getting oil come out and play go north come on Laura we shot is what's up in the sky they no rain up there we searched all the newspapers we can't find that article nor [Applause] have you been looking at the book Facebook have you been brother Dell they had Facebook where the Bible said there's nothing new Under the Sun somebody don't you see they did the same thing they're doing right now Malkin the messenger mocking his message making fun of him laughing aren't you why are you bunch of boat cults you're just a boat cult following some man I saw somebody post on social media complaining about this church they said I thank God we don't follow a dead man I thought are you serious do you read Paul do you eat pieces I thought what a stupid statement that's just stupid you didn't even worth answering we don't follow no dead man really Peter been dead for 2,000 years they still reading his writings brother you shouldn't say that okay how physically challenged or whatever they were laughing at the messenger laughing at his message laughing at the arc but don't you see Noah's preach in a way of escape and his very message manifested before them the very message he was preaching produced about the same message had gathered both of them there one was Malkin one was laughing holy was the door shut but when the first day nothing happened the second day nothing by the third day they was up tap dancing on top of the boom yeah you want us to catch you out buddy that door must be on in there do you have air conditioning no come on Oh we'll get you out come on boy get your ass are you still alive in there that's all it was the rain started it might have just been a shower at first but it didn't stop it didn't stop it kept raining and rain it who don't understand we saw this what's up in the air we don't understand how in the world is it right there's nothing up there but you see if God says it's gonna rain from the sky it's gonna rain from the sky I don't have to figure it out I just believe in God said so I love that he makes the blind see I don't know how he makes the lame walk I don't know how he does it I'm just so glad that he does it we don't understand the waters always come up from the deep it's always come up from the ground but God didn't say ground God since God knowing it was here they found the hiding place who hurts you go ahead for him he found a hiding place to the hunting Christ was sealed away by the Holy Ghost so here the Prophet said the devil can't even find you if you had to you could be so here in Christ the devil can't even find you you know when that door shut they never saw Noah again they never saw him again it kept getting higher and higher all of a sudden they're laughing and they're cheering and their Facebook post their Twitter accounts they started deleting them but it was too late the rain kept coming hey no no baby you know I was just kidding with you man I I didn't mean nothin behind had no wood wood wood bodies we work together down at the plant I know this is nothing no I was in that message for a while I came there for a while I never said nothing against you Noah I never said nothing against the man for God's signal if you can't take me take my baby no no that's not baby baby it's not my baby's fault it's my fault [Applause] [Laughter] baby as you well know they'd all be never accepted God shut the door the gathering dad was complete the door was shut no listen listen to what the woman the voices were silenced till all he heard was her body's beaten against a boat two groups one gathered to escape the other gathered for destruction Ruben said I believe the day with the signs and wonders appearing everywhere and the coming of the Son of God I believe that every man or woman that's ordained of God to hear the voice of God hears that tug they serve to the Orcas fast as they
