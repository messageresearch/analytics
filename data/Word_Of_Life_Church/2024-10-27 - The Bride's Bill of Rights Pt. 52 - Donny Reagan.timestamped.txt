[43:31] appreciate all of our friends and
[43:34] sometimes people we don't even know that
[43:36] have sent thousands times thousands of
[43:38] dollars to be able to funnel through the
[43:41] church here to be able to buy heaters uh
[43:45] propane gas generators just all kinds of
[43:48] things people have sent clothes from I
[43:51] think 12 or 13 different states uh box
[43:55] trucks tractor and trailers just

[43:58] helicopter landed out there the other
[44:00] day and brought fresh bread so I'm glad
[44:04] God didn't send us a helicopter he sent

[44:11] eagle praise the
[44:13] Lord cuz we needed fresh bread in this
[44:16] end time too didn't we not amen so we're
[44:19] so so grateful for that and um I know

[44:34] people had already died in the mountains
[44:37] when it got cold because they didn't
[44:39] have proper heat and stuff like that so
[44:42] let's pray that God will be merciful to
[44:44] them and help us to be able to find them
[44:46] and do what we can um we just want to

[45:04] to each of them we're grateful for all
[45:06] that you've done for all the our church
[45:08] here it wouldn't do any good if they'd
[45:10] send all that stuff if we didn't have
[45:11] people here that would be willing to
[45:13] take their time some of them take off
[45:15] work as I've said before bring their
[45:17] children there in the fellowship all and
[45:19] watch their children while they try to
[45:21] do all that all the brothers that have

[46:12] several different Brothers have been
[46:13] able to pray for people that's got needs
[46:15] and we're grateful for that we so

[46:23] see how that goes won't we anyway some
[46:26] of the um people even from our local
[46:29] community have come in to try to help
[46:32] distribute and help do things just
[46:35] whatever they can do around the church
[46:37] here and I myself I appreciate that they
[46:40] ain't no telling what they've heard
[46:42] about us there ain't even no telling but
[46:45] to be able to come and to be willing to
[46:47] do that I'm grateful for it and I know
[46:50] that uh some of the Saints here some of
[46:52] the brothers as well when they go out

[46:57] ones even from the community to come if
[47:00] they want to come sure come check us out

[47:06] might look a little different act a
[47:08] little different you know what the Lord
[47:10] may let us reach that very last
[47:14] one so let's not be too critical to
[47:16] judge them let's just pray if there's
[47:18] something there that we will be able to
[47:20] share not only a box of Cheerios and a
[47:22] BN box of Pringles and all kinds of
[47:25] water but let them sense Jesus Jesus
[47:27] sent us is that your desire My too
[47:30] that's exactly what we want amen um I
[47:33] wonder how many of us have a need a
[47:35] request in our heart today we'd like to
[47:36] make know before the Lord before we pray
[47:39] have a sister Branda Harmon with us
[47:41] again today and she's been through a um
[47:44] hip replacement had a really difficult
[47:46] time with all that glad to see you sis

[47:50] bless you
[47:57] Brother Lou already mentioned it but
[47:58] brother Glenn tamson we're certainly
[48:00] glad to have him his wife with us today
[48:02] in the service we pray the Lord for our
[48:03] Brethren we're just thankful for what
[48:05] the Lord's doing for him and we believe
[48:06] he's going to complete the work in his
[48:08] life don't we amen so we want to pray
[48:11] over this prayer clo too as we pray
[48:13] let's just hold our needs before the
[48:15] Lord Heavenly Father we have so much to
[48:17] thank you for that we basically could
[48:20] take the entire service the entire day
[48:23] the entire month if each one of us would
[48:25] give praise just for the things that we
[48:28] know you've done there ain't no telling
[48:30] how long it take us because you've been
[48:32] so good to us we want you to know we
[48:36] appreciate it father we even appreciate
[48:39] the trials that you will in your wisdom
[48:41] allow to come our way because there's
[48:44] something about trials that produce
[48:46] something in us that even Miracles won't
[48:50] produce we love Miracles we love healing
[48:53] we love Deliverance but yet trials and
[48:56] test
[48:57] produce a character in your people that
[49:00] the miraculous will not for we know that
[49:02] when you were here on the earth you
[49:04] performed many many miracles to all
[49:06] kinds of people and yet when it comes
[49:09] right down to that where were many of
[49:12] those people whenever you were dying on
[49:15] the cross hid away ashamed did not want
[49:19] to be identified with you because the
[49:21] reproach was so heavy and it could have
[49:24] cost them their life so Lord Jesus
[49:29] that's the kind of love for you we want
[49:31] oh I love you when I I see you do the
[49:33] Miracles I love it I love it when I see
[49:38] you deliver your children but Jesus I
[49:41] thank you that your love holds us strong
[49:44] even when we're going through trials and
[49:45] we don't understand why and we're trying
[49:48] to sort through it all and make sense of
[49:50] it all and a lot of times we just can't
[49:52] do it but thank you that your love holds
[49:54] us then father you see this prayer cost
[49:57] I have on my hand today I'll preach with
[49:59] it Lord and we're just believing you for
[50:01] a complete recovery for our sister
[50:02] Brenda you see what she's been through
[50:04] father other great needs here in our
[50:06] assembly today you saw the hundreds of
[50:08] hands that were uplifted signifying
[50:10] something that's important and of value
[50:13] to them would you minister to them today
[50:15] Father no doubt I'm the most needy
[50:20] person in this building today for one
[50:23] mortal to try to take the word of God
[50:27] and speak something to souls that are
[50:30] sick hungry thirsty needing things oh
[50:34] God I need you help me shut my mouth to
[50:37] anything that would displease you may I
[50:40] be a channel today by which the Holy
[50:42] Ghost can flow through me we'll commit
[50:44] it all to you Lord God and give you
[50:46] praise for eternity for the results in
[50:51] Jesus Christ's name we
[50:53] pray amen God bless you let's U turn to
[50:58] filimon again
[51:01] today I love this little big book not
[51:05] many chapters not many verses but it has
[51:09] some powerful powerful things in it we
[51:11] know all of God's word of course is
[51:13] powerful fimon 1 verse 5 Paul writing to
[51:19] a brother which had become converted
[51:22] under his ministry and the great things
[51:24] that God had done for him he'd grown a
[51:28] lot in the Lord and the Lord had been
[51:30] able to bring him from like the rest of
[51:32] us a life of sin but Paul wants this man
[51:37] to be able to understand not only
[51:39] written to him of course but people down
[51:41] Through the Ages that there's a way by
[51:43] which a Believer can grow even further I
[51:47] think we all want that don't we notice
[51:50] how
[51:51] Paul starts this about the brother
[51:54] hearing of thy love and Faith which thou
[51:59] H has toward the lord Jesus and
[52:03] toward All Saints I want you notice he
[52:07] does not mention the length of his hair
[52:11] he does not mention the garments that he
[52:13] had on he does not mention which group
[52:17] that he belonged to because by this time
[52:19] there was already several groups in the
[52:21] first century church but what he heard
[52:24] about this brother was his love love and
[52:27] his faith not just toward the lord
[52:32] Jesus notice hearing of thy love and
[52:35] faith which thou Hast toward the lord
[52:39] Jesus and toward those Saints who you
[52:42] really like and those who are your
[52:46] favorites oh my on
[52:49] no
[52:51] toward
[52:52] all all
[52:55] saints that they
[52:58] communication of thy faith may
[53:01] become effectual now the word
[53:04] communication is coia so it is a
[53:08] fellowship wow so you mean
[53:11] Faith needs to be communicated it's got
[53:15] to be communicated that the
[53:18] communication of thy facei may become
[53:22] effectual we looked at this word let's
[53:24] look at it again it's Greek word by
[53:27] which we get our English word energy
[53:29] from but it's powerful and active so
[53:33] your face can become powerful and active
[53:37] and this is the way it'll happen by the
[53:42] acknowledging of every good thing which
[53:44] is in you in Christ Jesus so
[53:48] acknowledging is
[53:50] eposis
[53:52] precise and correct
[53:55] knowledge not just knowledge precise on
[54:00] and correct knowledge precise that's the
[54:04] way the smart bombs have become in our
[54:08] age that Israel uses that America uses
[54:12] so I I saw some video not long ago of a
[54:15] bomb and they had a an abandoned tank
[54:18] setting out in the desert and this F-16
[54:22] was flying you know MCH one whatever it
[54:24] was over the desert
[54:27] sends this bomb launches it out of this
[54:29] F F-16
[54:31] fighter and they have a camera on this
[54:34] bomb and as it's going down moving this
[54:37] speed and as it's going down they video
[54:40] it and they put it right down the
[54:42] manhole of that
[54:45] tank now a lot of the nations of the
[54:48] world are still using the bombs that
[54:50] have no intelligence so they're not
[54:53] smart bombs that's the way a lot of
[54:55] Christians are trying to fight the devil
[54:58] they've not updated to Malachi
[55:01] 4 now under this ministry of the last
[55:04] day God has precise bombs so the Holy
[55:08] Ghost can be able to come and anoint a
[55:10] preacher to where he'll go right to
[55:13] where you live is that right he'll stand
[55:17] up and say things that you talked about
[55:20] before you come to church is that right
[55:22] we've all had it happen to us so what is
[55:24] that that's God using using a precise
[55:28] bombb to go exactly to where that it
[55:31] needs to go now watch this so what Paul
[55:34] said the way faith is going to be
[55:36] energized is by being able to use
[55:38] precise and correct knowledge so
[55:42] apparently there can be an
[55:45] incorrect
[55:47] knowledge so you have knowledge but
[55:50] you're not applying it in the correct
[55:51] way and what good does it do us so it's
[55:55] precise and it's correct correct
[55:59] knowledge used of the knowledge of
[56:01] things ethical and divine that the
[56:05] communication of thy face may become
[56:07] effectual energized by the acknowledging
[56:10] precise and correct truth of every good
[56:14] thing which is in you in Christ Jesus
[56:20] Philippians
[56:21] 4:8 finally Brethren whatsoever things
[56:25] are true
[56:27] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[56:30] things are just whatsoever things are
[56:34] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[56:37] whatsoever things are of a good report
[56:41] if there be any
[56:43] praise
[56:45] think on these things look at the
[56:49] meaning of this word to take into
[56:52] account to make an account of this word
[56:56] word deals with reality if I log as a
[57:00] mail or reckon that my bank book has $25
[57:05] in it it has $25 in it otherwise I am
[57:10] deceiving
[57:12] myself the word refers to facts not
[57:18] suppositions may the Lord bless his word
[57:21] you may be seated
[57:27] Ephesians 2: 6 Paul goes on to say that
[57:32] he has raised us up together and made us
[57:35] sit together in Heavenly places in
[57:39] Christ Jesus Heavenly places in Christ
[57:44] Jesus now you're talking about a group
[57:47] of people that are so blessed by God
[57:51] whoever these are whether they are Japan
[57:55] Africa India America whatever the state
[57:58] they're in around the in the United
[57:59] States whether they are Black White
[58:02] whatever the race their ethnicity
[58:04] doesn't really matter Paul doesn't even
[58:05] deal with that but he says in Christ
[58:09] Jesus so he's raised us up together and
[58:12] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[58:15] in Christ Jesus now I want them to speak
[58:17] to you again today is the right we've
[58:19] been talking about the bride's rights
[58:20] and we remember of course the lord gave
[58:22] me this thought however long ago it was
[58:25] about our bill of of rights which was
[58:26] given to us by our founding fathers
[58:29] after they gave us the Constitution then
[58:31] they decided sometime after that
[58:34] December
[58:35] 1795 they brought it into what they call
[58:38] ratify our Bill of Rights and it would
[58:41] give us these Bill of Rights and they
[58:43] started out with 10 10 rights that as
[58:47] American citizens you would have no
[58:50] matter where you come from if you come
[58:52] in here the right way you might be born
[58:54] here several Generations or you might
[58:56] immigrate into here and you will be able
[58:59] to receive that same Bill of Rights by
[59:02] the law that belongs to every one of us
[59:04] that are American citizens well if
[59:06] America did that for their their
[59:09] occupants and their inhabitants of
[59:11] America what about the Lord what he has
[59:14] done for us as his people but you know a
[59:17] bully could come in and try to tell you
[59:19] you don't have a right to this and a
[59:21] right to freedom of speech and you don't
[59:24] have a right to have a far and you don't
[59:27] have a right to be represented in court
[59:29] and you don't have a right and if you
[59:31] don't know your rights that enemy could
[59:34] convince you you don't have it but if
[59:37] you know your rights you'll be able to
[59:39] say them look this is my Bill of Rights
[59:43] as an American citizen my grandfather
[59:45] come here from wherever my father was
[59:47] born here I have a a US citizenship it
[59:51] is mine you're not taking away from me
[59:54] my right to be able to have a
[59:56] representation in court I have a right
[59:59] to be able to be a US citizen I have a
[1:00:03] right and you are not taking it from me
[1:00:06] now a lot of us when it would come to
[1:00:08] our American rights we would fight to
[1:00:10] our last breaths I wonder why we don't
[1:00:13] do it when it comes to our spiritual
[1:00:14] rights you have a right to peace you
[1:00:18] have a right to happiness you have a
[1:00:20] right to Joy you have a right to Healing
[1:00:24] if you're sick today you got a right to
[1:00:26] a supernatural move in your body come on
[1:00:29] preach with me today so no matter what
[1:00:31] you got going on in your life God has
[1:00:34] covered everything that you have need of
[1:00:37] and you've got a right to but what's
[1:00:38] amazing is you'll have to fight for
[1:00:40] every right that you've got is that true
[1:00:43] now just because it's yours don't mean
[1:00:45] that it'll fall in your lap you were
[1:00:47] born with those rights as American
[1:00:49] citizen I wonder how many of us here
[1:00:51] today even know what the first 10 were
[1:00:53] anybody anybody even know what they were
[1:00:55] and not amazing now you see if we had
[1:00:57] been former uh Chinese people from
[1:01:00] communist China I find this amazing that
[1:01:03] allot the immigrants had come to America
[1:01:05] and whenever they would come from
[1:01:06] Venezuela they'd come from China maybe
[1:01:08] from Russia whatever it was when they
[1:01:10] come in and through immigration they
[1:01:13] find out that they can become an
[1:01:14] American citizen you know the wor the
[1:01:16] first things that some of them people do
[1:01:18] they want to find out what is their
[1:01:21] rights what what what's what belongs to
[1:01:24] me so instead of us we were born in it
[1:01:27] oh yeah grandpa said something about it
[1:01:29] I don't even know what they are I don't
[1:01:30] guess it really matters oh but it does
[1:01:32] matter but who is it that appreciates it
[1:01:35] so much those that never had it so if
[1:01:38] you were a communist China and then you
[1:01:40] come into America one of the first
[1:01:42] things they want to do is find out so
[1:01:44] what does the Constitution say what does
[1:01:47] the Bill of Rights say what is mine you
[1:01:51] know brother bandam called it like an
[1:01:52] arcade and he said if you go into an
[1:01:54] arcade and he said said that someone
[1:01:56] gave you that and it had all these
[1:01:58] things in it so you go to pulling out
[1:02:00] every drawer and you'd open up every
[1:02:03] door to find out what's yours and he
[1:02:05] said if there was something up high that
[1:02:07] I couldn't be able to reach it I'd get a
[1:02:09] ladder and I'd open the door and I'd go
[1:02:12] up there and find out what was mine why
[1:02:14] he was curious as to what was his well
[1:02:17] as the bride of Christ we know that we
[1:02:19] have a great responsibility in being
[1:02:22] bride but we know also we have many many
[1:02:25] blessings and whatever we have need of I
[1:02:27] believe from the stage of our journey to
[1:02:30] where we start that drawing from the
[1:02:31] Lord and we come to him through
[1:02:33] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:36] then we start lay laying in the presence
[1:02:38] of God him revealing to us his word then
[1:02:41] it is this journey and as we go along
[1:02:44] our needs will change as it does
[1:02:46] naturally when I was a young boy I
[1:02:49] didn't need many the things that I need
[1:02:50] now as an older man whenever I signed up
[1:02:52] on Medicare years ago and I started
[1:02:54] getting this Catal in the mag in in the
[1:02:57] mail and it was for things for people
[1:03:00] like Carol and I and United healthc Care
[1:03:02] and it started having all these things
[1:03:04] that you could pick out diapers for old
[1:03:07] people and uh hearing aids and hearing
[1:03:09] this and and pain patches and this thing
[1:03:12] are you kidding me and I thought I don't
[1:03:14] need all that do I maybe I do I don't
[1:03:17] know that I do but I thought you know my
[1:03:19] needs a as a man they have changed
[1:03:22] somewhat since I was when I was a boy
[1:03:25] and it's the same way when we grow in
[1:03:27] the Lord that initially you may deal
[1:03:29] with sins in your life and this thing
[1:03:31] and that thing and you're kind of
[1:03:33] immature and you're growing and you're
[1:03:34] learning and then as you do you put that
[1:03:37] behind you and you go on and God and you
[1:03:39] look back and think wow that was so hard
[1:03:41] for me to overcome that was so difficult
[1:03:44] for me to put under my feet but thank
[1:03:46] God it's behind me now and then you look
[1:03:49] at things that you're facing now
[1:03:51] sometimes they be more complex aren't
[1:03:53] they and they're more difficult
[1:03:55] sometimes and what they were when you
[1:03:56] were a younger Christian because the
[1:03:58] devil is allowed listen to me by the
[1:04:01] allowance of God to be able to hit us in
[1:04:05] a way once we become more mature than he
[1:04:08] ever did when we first got saved you
[1:04:10] remember when the children of Israel
[1:04:12] left the land of Egypt and God sent them
[1:04:14] a certain way now he could have sent
[1:04:17] them a shorter way which would have been
[1:04:19] a shortcut they would have reached that
[1:04:22] land a lot quicker but the Bible said
[1:04:25] that he would not not send them that way
[1:04:27] because they would have many many
[1:04:29] enemies they would have faced and he
[1:04:31] said it would L they would become
[1:04:34] discouraged in the way so the shorter
[1:04:37] way might be this way would say but here
[1:04:40] was an enemy there was another there was
[1:04:41] another there was another but yet God
[1:04:43] may send them way around this way and go
[1:04:47] way back there to get to it there's not
[1:04:49] near as many enemies but it'll take them
[1:04:51] a lot longer now whenever we grow and
[1:04:54] mature in the Lord then Lord can allow
[1:04:56] us to be tested in such a way that we
[1:04:59] would have never thought possible when
[1:05:01] we were a young Christian can anybody
[1:05:03] say Amen to that today but you look back
[1:05:06] and you realize that God trusts you and
[1:05:09] I now in order to do that we must have
[1:05:12] then our position in the Lord Jesus now
[1:05:14] I'm not talking about just by 1
[1:05:16] Corinthians 12 where by Spirit we are
[1:05:19] baptized into the body but I'm talking
[1:05:22] about us finding our place in Christ
[1:05:25] Jesus by this logo as Paul uses the word
[1:05:29] that it is a precise and correct
[1:05:31] knowledge that we know who we are and
[1:05:35] with the anointing or without it we
[1:05:37] still stand upon the promise of the word
[1:05:40] notice in Ephesians 2:10 for we are his
[1:05:43] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:05:48] good works which God has before ordained
[1:05:51] that we should walk in them this is who
[1:05:54] I am as a child of God I believe a
[1:05:57] predestinated life follows a
[1:06:00] predestinated seed people who just talk
[1:06:03] about predestination all the time and
[1:06:05] they're a seed and they're a seed and
[1:06:07] live ungodly and live like the devil
[1:06:09] they don't even understand what
[1:06:10] predestination is because there is a
[1:06:13] holy life that a predestinated seed is
[1:06:15] ordained to have there is an overcoming
[1:06:19] life that a predestinated seed is
[1:06:21] ordained of God to have notice in verse
[1:06:24] 12 that at that time you were without
[1:06:27] Christ being aliens for the Commonwealth
[1:06:29] of Israel and strangers from the
[1:06:32] covenants of Promise having no hope now
[1:06:34] this was us Gentiles having no hope and
[1:06:38] without God in the world but now in
[1:06:42] Christ Jesus ye who were sometimes were
[1:06:47] a far off are made nigh by the blood of
[1:06:51] Christ second Timothy 1:9 who has saved
[1:06:55] us and called us with a holy calling not
[1:06:58] according to our works but according to
[1:07:02] his own purpose and Grace which was
[1:07:06] given us in Christ Jesus the night you
[1:07:10] went down to the Altar and got sa no it
[1:07:12] was given to you in Christ Jesus before
[1:07:16] the world ever began as a matter of fact
[1:07:19] before there was a devil I done had my
[1:07:21] inheritance in him amen before there was
[1:07:24] ever a sickness before there's ever a
[1:07:26] cancer before there's ever a trial I was
[1:07:29] given complete victory over every trial
[1:07:32] I'll ever boy brother sister you can't
[1:07:34] beat that I'm talking about this is what
[1:07:37] your allocation and your allotment is
[1:07:40] but it won't do you any good if you
[1:07:42] don't rise and claim it now sometimes
[1:07:45] God is here to help our faith and Paul
[1:07:48] even mentioned about those in the New
[1:07:50] Testament that were helpers of people's
[1:07:53] Faith now that's what a minister is
[1:07:55] supposed to be he's supposed to be a
[1:07:57] helper of people's faith and there's
[1:08:00] times that our faith will actually be
[1:08:02] strong enough with a little bit of
[1:08:05] assistance from our brothers and sisters
[1:08:07] and they come and stand with us your
[1:08:09] faith and our faith together will help
[1:08:12] us to be able to attain that Victory but
[1:08:14] there's other times in our life your
[1:08:17] face and my face and the fa of the
[1:08:19] Church Believers believing with you will
[1:08:21] not be enough sometimes it actually
[1:08:25] takes the faith of God
[1:08:27] himself God himself in you believing his
[1:08:32] own word now please don't misunderstand
[1:08:34] me actually when that happens you don't
[1:08:36] even my need my faith with you then you
[1:08:39] don't need the faith of your wife nor
[1:08:41] the faith of your husband because you
[1:08:43] have received the face of God believe it
[1:08:46] or not that's what's going to make the
[1:08:47] consummation of the body change now you
[1:08:49] know that there are many battles that we
[1:08:51] will face and God does not step in
[1:08:54] supernaturally every time and let us
[1:08:57] have access to his face because we would
[1:09:00] be so spoiled we're already spoil rotten
[1:09:02] anyway and we'd be even worse if every
[1:09:05] time we faced a hard trial that he just
[1:09:07] dropped that face in our hearts and he
[1:09:10] believed through us and this simply
[1:09:12] happened but you know what he'll do he
[1:09:14] knows when we're in those urgent times
[1:09:17] that we simply cannot do it it was by
[1:09:20] that that Abraham was able to attain to
[1:09:23] the promise of a body change we know the
[1:09:25] prophet said Sarah actually never did
[1:09:27] believe I mean she fell constantly short
[1:09:30] of the glory of God and it was God's
[1:09:32] mercy that was given to us I've been
[1:09:35] there the same way many times I'm sure
[1:09:37] you have too to where my faith just does
[1:09:40] not seem like it could reach that place
[1:09:43] where it needed to be but aren't you
[1:09:45] glad he's there to help us now what once
[1:09:48] God gives us this position in him it's
[1:09:51] for us of course it's for our family if
[1:09:53] you're married it's for you and your
[1:09:54] spouse you have children it's for the
[1:09:56] whole family that God can be able to use
[1:09:58] you you see this is part of the economy
[1:10:00] of God that God didn't just save us and
[1:10:02] say well y'all go to church every now
[1:10:04] and then live pretty good life you know
[1:10:06] be a pretty good person kind of be moral
[1:10:08] if you can and try to be honest if you
[1:10:10] can if you can't understand you know if
[1:10:11] you have to lie a little bit every now
[1:10:12] and then and and just try to do the best
[1:10:14] you can and then whenever you get to
[1:10:16] heaven I I'll make everything perfect
[1:10:17] for you that that's not salvation that's
[1:10:20] not the new birth but God wants us to be
[1:10:22] Overcomers while we're living right in
[1:10:24] the middle of H H believe it or not you
[1:10:27] are a paradox this morning you are
[1:10:29] living in an insane world you're living
[1:10:32] in a demon possessed world the lid was
[1:10:35] tore off the kettle in
[1:10:37] 1961 Satan's headquarters at one time
[1:10:40] was in Paris France he's moved around
[1:10:43] several times and he's followed
[1:10:44] civilization at one time of course it
[1:10:47] was across in the Middle East and then
[1:10:49] it became in Paris France then it moved
[1:10:52] again it moved to where not Washington
[1:10:54] DC see but Hollywood so out of Hollywood
[1:10:58] then Satan began to being his new
[1:11:00] headquarters he began through movies and
[1:11:03] media and so on be able to try to
[1:11:06] control the minds not only the American
[1:11:08] people but of the world but we know that
[1:11:11] when he does that that the spirit of the
[1:11:13] Lord is here to lift up a standard
[1:11:15] against him so is it any Wonder to us if
[1:11:17] the devil moved his headquarters into
[1:11:19] the United States that God would send a
[1:11:22] prophet not from France not from
[1:11:24] Portugal not from Poland but from where
[1:11:26] America why Satan raised up and made a
[1:11:29] challenge to God God said fine I'm here
[1:11:32] already I've got a boy born down here in
[1:11:34] Kentucky and I'm going to have my word
[1:11:36] to be able to manifest through him I'll
[1:11:38] have a group of people right in the
[1:11:39] middle of your Paradise devil they'll
[1:11:42] live right they'll be right they'll not
[1:11:44] take your mind but as a matter of fact
[1:11:46] they'll have my mind they'll believe the
[1:11:48] word they will stand against everything
[1:11:51] you do not only that I will try them to
[1:11:54] such a place they won't even understand
[1:11:57] sometimes what's going on they won't
[1:11:59] only just meet you devil but they will
[1:12:01] meet me and they will pray about certain
[1:12:03] things and I will emphatically say no to
[1:12:06] them and you know what they'll do
[1:12:08] they'll love me anyhow they'll serve me
[1:12:10] anyhow I don't want to serve God just
[1:12:13] When God says yes that's the kind of God
[1:12:16] a lot of people want they ask God for
[1:12:18] this and God says yes they ask God for
[1:12:20] that and God says yes they ask God for
[1:12:22] that and God says yes I want to be the
[1:12:25] type of believer and I am that if God
[1:12:28] tells me no I say Lord your ways are
[1:12:31] perfect Lord you make no mistakes you
[1:12:33] know come on somebody don't you want to
[1:12:35] be the type of believer that if the Lord
[1:12:38] says no David you can't have that no
[1:12:40] Dave you can't have that no Freddy you
[1:12:42] can't have that you say praise God I
[1:12:45] love you anyhow Lord praise God you made
[1:12:49] no mistakes Jesus oh my I don't want to
[1:12:51] be the type of believer in this salt lay
[1:12:54] of sin age God has to put me in a bubble
[1:12:57] and he can never try me he can never
[1:12:59] test me he can never let hell come
[1:13:02] against me but I want to be the type of
[1:13:04] believer that not only can I overcome
[1:13:06] demons not only can I overcome powers of
[1:13:09] hell but if the Lord God wants a
[1:13:11] wrestling mes like he did with Jacob and
[1:13:14] the Lord throws me in the ring and I'll
[1:13:16] say Lord this ain't Fair Lord this ain't
[1:13:18] fair I can't wrestle you and yet God
[1:13:21] says come on Donnie come on can you
[1:13:24] believe me I'm going to to pull my
[1:13:25] anointing away from you I'm going to
[1:13:27] hear your cry but I'm not going to
[1:13:29] answer I wish somebody would preach with
[1:13:31] me this morning I'm going to I'm going
[1:13:33] to let you go through things you're not
[1:13:34] going to understand that when I come out
[1:13:37] on the other side I might be limping but
[1:13:40] I'll be a limping Prince Hallelujah I
[1:13:43] might have went in there and I might
[1:13:44] been able to walk on my own accord I
[1:13:47] might need help when I come out on the
[1:13:49] other side but what I do I will be a
[1:13:52] believer that can stand and say I love
[1:13:55] you with all of my
[1:14:03] heart now let me get to what I opened up
[1:14:05] with that we're not just called to
[1:14:07] minister to people and the Lord has
[1:14:10] helped us in the last months to be able
[1:14:12] to minister to people from our church in
[1:14:14] a way that we've never quite done before
[1:14:16] and it don't mean we'll ever do it again
[1:14:18] but for whatever reason God allowed us
[1:14:21] to be able to minister to people that
[1:14:23] have come through this storm and and
[1:14:25] flood and all this stuff that happened a
[1:14:27] bit ago it was not orchestrated by us
[1:14:29] but I believe God allowed it to happen
[1:14:31] that's what God wants us to do so we do
[1:14:34] it for the occasion we also are called
[1:14:37] to minister to the
[1:14:42] Saints but even greater than those
[1:14:45] two if you're bride today you are called
[1:14:49] to
[1:14:50] minister to almighty God amen amen
[1:14:57] now how can you minister to
[1:14:59] anyone who does not have some sort of
[1:15:05] need so if you haven't been over the
[1:15:07] fellowship hall in a bit you need to
[1:15:09] look at it cuz there's water sitting
[1:15:11] everywhere our Pavilion down yours full
[1:15:13] of
[1:15:14] stuff and some of the places we've been
[1:15:16] taking they say you know back off a
[1:15:17] little bit cuz we got so much stuff so
[1:15:20] we're trying to find more people that
[1:15:23] need this stuff
[1:15:25] so you can only minister to people who
[1:15:28] have
[1:15:29] needs well how could God have need of
[1:15:34] anything you see it's the way he
[1:15:38] projected
[1:15:40] himself in eternity there was no one
[1:15:44] there but him the logos was not there
[1:15:48] light was not there Darkness was not
[1:15:51] there there was nothing but him there
[1:15:53] was not even one angel
[1:15:56] he was just the
[1:15:58] Eternal but then he began to project the
[1:16:02] thoughts from his mind and he out of his
[1:16:05] own being then he comes to a form which
[1:16:10] is
[1:16:11] himself but in a form that can need
[1:16:16] something if not you wouldn't be here
[1:16:21] today so what is it an act of
[1:16:24] condensation astion so the logos comes
[1:16:28] out of the Eternal as a little
[1:16:30] flickering
[1:16:32] light a little white light that comes
[1:16:35] out of the
[1:16:37] Eternal God giving birth to a son the
[1:16:43] Son of God the
[1:16:45] Loos if you understand the baptism of
[1:16:48] the Holy Ghost on your soul real good
[1:16:51] you'll understand what you got when you
[1:16:54] got to Holy Ghost you're part of the
[1:16:59] logos I'm just talking about now Aus
[1:17:03] strect I'm talking about your portion of
[1:17:08] God
[1:17:11] hallelujah so he starts expanding
[1:17:15] himself into a form which can need
[1:17:21] something a a form that can reach out
[1:17:26] and can be touched that could touch and
[1:17:29] be touched love and be loved and in this
[1:17:35] form he allowed this to be so that oh
[1:17:39] Lord help us that he would appear in
[1:17:44] this
[1:17:45] form with great needs
[1:17:50] himself and so make himself that he is
[1:17:55] not
[1:17:56] complete without
[1:18:00] you praise be to
[1:18:03] God now watch in Exodus 28:1 this is God
[1:18:09] instituting the aonic priesthood now
[1:18:12] remember the reason that God gave this
[1:18:14] was because the people themselves up to
[1:18:17] this time the the firstborn the father
[1:18:20] of course first was the priest of the
[1:18:22] home then the firstborn son would take
[1:18:24] it and on and on that's the way God
[1:18:26] intended for it to be in the original
[1:18:28] but Israel got to a place that that was
[1:18:31] taken from them so God brought forth a
[1:18:33] levitical priesthood and he chose the
[1:18:36] family of Aaron take thou unto thee
[1:18:39] Aaron thy brother and his sons with him
[1:18:42] from among the children of Israel that
[1:18:45] he may
[1:18:48] Minister unto
[1:18:51] me what would God need
[1:18:57] now what have we been doing in the last
[1:18:58] several weeks and people from all over
[1:19:01] America and people that we don't even
[1:19:03] know sending their money and buying this
[1:19:05] and buying that well we're we're
[1:19:07] ministering to people in this terrible
[1:19:10] terrible situation that have lost their
[1:19:13] homes lost power lost all kinds of
[1:19:16] things and they have needs right and it
[1:19:20] created this spot to where we by the
[1:19:23] grace of God would be able to minister
[1:19:25] to their needs if that hurricane would
[1:19:28] have come through on the Atlantic side
[1:19:30] or had it went up through Texas and come
[1:19:33] that way and totally bypass us there
[1:19:35] would be no need for us to have all this
[1:19:37] stuff over here there would be no need
[1:19:39] for our brothers to make all these trips
[1:19:41] they made up all these Hills and hollers
[1:19:43] and mountains and all that stuff there
[1:19:45] would be no need they would be no need
[1:19:48] they would have their power they would
[1:19:50] have their houses they would have all of
[1:19:52] that and but something created did this
[1:19:57] need don't you understand that in the
[1:19:59] form of the Eternal he had no
[1:20:06] need but he condens sin into this
[1:20:11] form that he started needing
[1:20:15] something you know how we are as humans
[1:20:18] sir we don't like feeling
[1:20:21] vulnerable we don't like feeling like we
[1:20:24] need
[1:20:26] anybody well come on now don't get quiet
[1:20:28] on me well I I you know I can do what I
[1:20:31] want I can do this I can work I don't
[1:20:33] need nobody I don't know now you see
[1:20:35] whenever we get that spot we're in a
[1:20:37] dangerous
[1:20:39] shape the Eternal himself condescended
[1:20:43] into this form that he
[1:20:47] needed
[1:20:50] something so it wants Aaron and his sons
[1:20:54] to minister unto the Lord in the
[1:20:57] priest's office even Aaron NAD Abu
[1:21:01] elazar isamar Aaron's son so now the
[1:21:05] priests are going to minister of course
[1:21:07] to the people but first they've got to
[1:21:10] minister to
[1:21:12] God now you see even a preacher can be
[1:21:16] able to minister to the people talk to
[1:21:18] them encourage them try to help them but
[1:21:21] if he goes to leing God out of that
[1:21:23] Administration
[1:21:25] that's when they go to get in trouble
[1:21:27] they can still minister to the people
[1:21:30] because of Prior years of experience and
[1:21:32] knowledge of studying the Bible but it's
[1:21:34] so important that a real Minister also
[1:21:37] minister to God as well as the people
[1:21:41] amen because his ministry is not just
[1:21:44] the people
[1:21:46] themselves but it's God
[1:21:50] first NOW Watch What Happens here in 2
[1:21:53] Chronicles chapter 13:10 but as for us
[1:21:57] the Lord Is Our God and we have not
[1:21:59] forsaken him and the priest which
[1:22:02] minister unto the Lord are the sons of
[1:22:05] Aaron and the Levites wait upon their
[1:22:10] business so here now some several
[1:22:12] hundred years after it was established
[1:22:14] in Exodus we have them repeating the
[1:22:17] same thing that the priests are
[1:22:19] ministering so apparently the Lord had
[1:22:21] some
[1:22:22] needs what was it
[1:22:26] what would God
[1:22:28] need from us come on now Daniel
[1:22:34] 7:9 I beheld till the Thrones are cast
[1:22:37] down and the Ancient of Days did sit His
[1:22:41] Garment was white as snow and the hair
[1:22:43] of his head like the pure wool his
[1:22:46] throne was like the fiery flame and his
[1:22:49] wheels as burning fire a fiery stream
[1:22:54] issued
[1:22:55] and came forth from before him now
[1:22:58] notice thousand
[1:23:02] thousands thousand
[1:23:05] thousands
[1:23:07] ministered unto
[1:23:10] him so here the pillar of fire has been
[1:23:13] encapsulated around the Throne of God
[1:23:16] and this must have been something for
[1:23:18] Daniel to see this fiery issue coming
[1:23:22] from the presence of God and there are
[1:23:25] thousands thousands that are standing
[1:23:28] not to be judged right but standing
[1:23:32] there with the great king and they are
[1:23:35] ministering than Lord to
[1:23:41] him thousand thousands ministered unto
[1:23:44] him and 10,000 times
[1:23:49] 10,000s stood before him in other words
[1:23:52] this group of people stood out in front
[1:23:55] of
[1:23:57] him but there was some people who were
[1:24:00] not in front of him they were around
[1:24:05] him thousands thousands were around him
[1:24:09] now here they are they're standing near
[1:24:12] him they're standing behind him they're
[1:24:14] they're giving him what he needs and the
[1:24:17] others were those which were in front of
[1:24:20] him oh God don't let none of us be
[1:24:23] there I do not want to stand in that
[1:24:26] position I want to stand right here in
[1:24:28] the first part of this verse thousand
[1:24:31] thousands ministered under him and
[1:24:33] 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the
[1:24:39] Judgment was
[1:24:42] set and the
[1:24:44] books were
[1:24:47] opened so what do we see
[1:24:51] King with his Queen yeah
[1:24:56] who's before him those who
[1:24:59] have not been raised in the first
[1:25:03] resurrection now they're going to be
[1:25:05] judged and who's there with him in the
[1:25:10] throne his
[1:25:12] wife watch this in the breach Daniel
[1:25:15] said the Judgment was set in the books
[1:25:16] were open 10,000 times 10 thousands of
[1:25:19] thousands ministered to him King and
[1:25:23] Queen Another the book was open which is
[1:25:25] The Book of Life that's for the church
[1:25:28] and the queen and the
[1:25:31] King stood
[1:25:33] there so in the
[1:25:36] Judgment the queen will be ministering
[1:25:40] to her husband and aiding in the white
[1:25:44] Throne
[1:25:46] judgment
[1:25:48] amen do you understand if you're in
[1:25:50] Christ Jesus today you will never stand
[1:25:53] before the white Throne Judgment of God
[1:25:56] you have passed from Death unto life you
[1:26:00] will never be judged that ought to make
[1:26:03] a presbyterian want to
[1:26:06] shout oh
[1:26:09] hallelujah thank you Lord notice in the
[1:26:12] first seal now remember when he come he
[1:26:15] come with his
[1:26:20] bride is't it amazing when Paul sets the
[1:26:23] setting of the Rapture the translation
[1:26:25] the body change said behold the Lord
[1:26:29] cometh quoting from the Old Testament
[1:26:31] with 10,000s and Jud also of his Saints
[1:26:36] he's coming with
[1:26:39] them
[1:26:40] Hallelujah in the resurrection they are
[1:26:43] the Vindication that Calvary was a
[1:26:48] success oh my notice this remember he
[1:26:51] come and he come with his bride the wife
[1:26:55] ministers to her
[1:26:58] husband the wife ministers so your
[1:27:03] brothers whenever you go out and brother
[1:27:06] BR used the example so many times in so
[1:27:08] many different scenarios of a man that
[1:27:10] would be out working and he he comes in
[1:27:12] after a hard day and his wife is there
[1:27:15] and she comes in and and greets him and
[1:27:17] puts her arms around him and all that
[1:27:20] and then she's fixing supper for him and
[1:27:22] they sit there and talk and you know
[1:27:23] they they discussed their day and he
[1:27:26] said he might be going through such hard
[1:27:28] times but just the touch of her hand
[1:27:32] upon his cheek upon his brow can just do
[1:27:37] something so to that man like it can
[1:27:40] calm so many things she doesn't take it
[1:27:43] all away but you see this is what God
[1:27:46] gave the man the woman for the beginning
[1:27:49] he never gave a man a wife so that she
[1:27:53] would be able to be his head or that she
[1:27:56] would be running for president or she'd
[1:27:57] be mayor or Governor or something like
[1:28:00] that but God gave her the correct
[1:28:02] position and that was a help meat now
[1:28:06] women today want to be the
[1:28:09] meat they don't need a man but you see
[1:28:11] they're in the wrong place there're to
[1:28:13] be a help me don't you understand it was
[1:28:16] a foreshadow or a prefigure of what the
[1:28:19] bride would be to the Lord God
[1:28:22] himself how could he made Adam in his
[1:28:25] own image and everything that he made he
[1:28:27] said was good until he looked at the man
[1:28:29] and said it's not good for the man to be
[1:28:31] alone so where did man get this
[1:28:33] loneliness at he got it from his father
[1:28:36] so his father was there in eternity with
[1:28:39] myriads of angels that were around him
[1:28:42] but he was still alone oh yes he was
[1:28:45] alone because he had no one of his own
[1:28:48] genos or of his own kind angels are not
[1:28:52] of his kind they were created to worship
[1:28:55] him they were created to be able to be
[1:28:57] there for Beyond of Ages maybe they were
[1:29:00] but he wanted something of his own kind
[1:29:03] have you ever seen a man marrying a
[1:29:05] donkey well in this day you probably
[1:29:06] could and I've heard of him marrying
[1:29:08] pizzas I've heard of him marrying their
[1:29:10] cars and marrying all kinds of things
[1:29:12] that shows the you know the ignorance of
[1:29:14] the world we're living in but man was
[1:29:16] not made to marry a man a woman not made
[1:29:19] to marry a woman come on don't get quiet
[1:29:21] on in that word of life but God had the
[1:29:23] perfect order in the beginning whenever
[1:29:26] he gave the man a woman and that woman
[1:29:29] then was to be a helpmate not a doormat
[1:29:32] not a a being that was property to the
[1:29:35] man and not a male chauvinist and the
[1:29:37] man did not honor her and love her and
[1:29:40] respect her praise the Lord and whenever
[1:29:43] we look at that Adam what was it that
[1:29:46] was something within him that he long
[1:29:48] for something and he didn't even know
[1:29:49] what for maybe go down to the cool Blue
[1:29:52] Waters as they would riple down off the
[1:29:54] mountains and M the flowers in Paradise
[1:29:57] were awesome and the birds of paradise
[1:29:59] would land down on his shoulder and C to
[1:30:01] him and sheet of the tiger would come
[1:30:03] over and the lion the giraffe the
[1:30:05] hippopotamus and everything would just
[1:30:06] come around like a big family and yet
[1:30:09] Adam would look at it he'd see male and
[1:30:11] female Rhino male and female elephant
[1:30:13] male and female Canal everything that he
[1:30:15] saw was in pairs and then he kept
[1:30:18] feeling this something why do I feel
[1:30:20] this way everything is perfect
[1:30:22] everything is perfect what's wrong with
[1:30:24] me what's wrong with me and maybe look
[1:30:26] down in the water that day as it would
[1:30:28] come down into a gentle spot as it would
[1:30:30] trickle off the rocks and the beautiful
[1:30:32] flowers around it and he would look and
[1:30:34] he would see his own image but there was
[1:30:37] no one by him the way there was by the
[1:30:39] elephant there was no one behind him he
[1:30:42] would look and there was not another
[1:30:43] human being on the Earth but him I don't
[1:30:47] care how rich you are I don't care how
[1:30:48] much you worse I don't care what great
[1:30:50] your name is God made you to be a social
[1:30:54] preacher God made us to need one another
[1:30:57] God made us oh come on somebody to have
[1:31:00] friends and have Fellowship oh I know I
[1:31:02] know it's risky having any friends they
[1:31:05] may break your heart but I'm telling you
[1:31:07] one thing it'll be worth the risk if you
[1:31:09] ever get down and there's only one
[1:31:11] friend that can come by and help you and
[1:31:13] pull you up you'll be so glad you've had
[1:31:16] them and the Lord God saw it and it must
[1:31:19] have reached a place of Paramount
[1:31:22] Paramount something that moved the heart
[1:31:25] of God we don't know how long it it even
[1:31:27] was it could have been years it could
[1:31:29] have been aons of time before God
[1:31:31] finally come to the spot and said it's
[1:31:34] not good so did Adam get worse was there
[1:31:37] something in him that was changing day
[1:31:39] by day God didn't say that initially
[1:31:41] when he made him but something had
[1:31:43] happened in the man it was his father's
[1:31:46] attribute in his son that was declaring
[1:31:50] I need to be expressed I need someone to
[1:31:54] talk to I need someone to love do you
[1:31:57] understand today it's something that
[1:31:59] many Christians never get about God God
[1:32:03] is a
[1:32:05] lover God is not a mean contrary hateful
[1:32:10] God that hates Humanity that hates the
[1:32:13] world God is a lover our God is the very
[1:32:19] essence of oh come on Church let's have
[1:32:21] church this morning our God is the very
[1:32:25] essence of love and if you are allowed
[1:32:28] by the grace of God to move into that
[1:32:31] sphere with God you will experience
[1:32:33] something other mortals can only dream
[1:32:40] about
[1:32:45] Hallelujah notice in Ezekiel 4319 Thou
[1:32:48] shalt give to the priest the Levites
[1:32:51] that be of the seed of zadok
[1:32:54] which approach unto me to minister unto
[1:32:59] me sayeth the Lord a young bulock for a
[1:33:02] sin offering now we go to Ezekiel 44:16
[1:33:04] now remember Ezekiel 44 through chapter
[1:33:07] 48 is the Millennium
[1:33:10] Temple the Millennium Temple and they
[1:33:14] shall enter into my sanctuary and they
[1:33:17] shall come near to my
[1:33:19] table to minister unto me and they shall
[1:33:23] keep my
[1:33:25] charge Ezekiel 45:4 the holy portion of
[1:33:28] the land shall be for the priest the
[1:33:30] Ministers of the sanctuary which shall
[1:33:33] come near to minister unto the Lord I
[1:33:36] hope you're catching that only priests
[1:33:40] yeah can come near the presence of the
[1:33:44] Lord close enough to minister to him in
[1:33:47] this Avenue yeah not necessarily just
[1:33:51] saved people
[1:33:54] but
[1:33:55] priest for thou Hast made us unto our
[1:33:58] God Kings and Priests and we shall reign
[1:34:02] upon the
[1:34:03] Earth so only
[1:34:06] priest Oh Glory to God are called to
[1:34:11] come in this
[1:34:13] close the average
[1:34:16] Christian can be outside the
[1:34:19] sanctuary outside in the courtyard they
[1:34:23] can hear his voice they can see the
[1:34:25] cloud they can see the fire but they
[1:34:28] will never be pulled in behind the veil
[1:34:32] to where the holy of holies
[1:34:35] is separation between bride and church
[1:34:39] notice acts 13:1 now there was a church
[1:34:41] there at Antioch certain prophets that
[1:34:45] and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that
[1:34:47] was called Niger and Lucius of siren and
[1:34:49] manad which had brought up was Herod the
[1:34:52] tetrarch and Saul as they
[1:34:57] ministered to the Lord and
[1:35:01] fasted the Holy Ghost
[1:35:03] said separate me Barnabas and
[1:35:07] Saul for the work where unto I have
[1:35:10] called
[1:35:11] them now look at New Testament now so
[1:35:15] here were some men that were under the
[1:35:18] unction of the spirit of God and they
[1:35:20] were ministering to the Lord total
[1:35:22] different meaning this word in the New
[1:35:24] Testament to assume an office which must
[1:35:29] be
[1:35:31] administered at one's
[1:35:34] own
[1:35:41] expense to move into a position Harry in
[1:35:45] the New
[1:35:47] Testament and if you're called to do
[1:35:50] this it will come at your your
[1:35:59] expense praise the
[1:36:02] Lord oh Jesus to discharge a public
[1:36:06] office at One's cost of Christians
[1:36:09] serving Christ whether by Prayer by
[1:36:12] instructing others concerning the way of
[1:36:14] Salvation or in some way but notice in
[1:36:17] the Old Testament where' the gold come
[1:36:18] from where the silver where the purple
[1:36:20] where the blue where did all those
[1:36:22] things come from to be to drape upon the
[1:36:24] priest it came from the
[1:36:27] people amen but in the New
[1:36:30] Testament if you're called to go into
[1:36:32] the presence of the
[1:36:35] king it will cost
[1:36:38] you amen it won't be your wife paying
[1:36:41] the price for you and if you got a
[1:36:43] Ministry especially if you're a preacher
[1:36:45] your wife will pay a price too your
[1:36:47] children will your family will right sir
[1:36:51] sure you all pay a price for the
[1:36:52] ministry here it ain't just me the
[1:36:55] preachers that's identified under this
[1:36:56] ministry and every other ministry that's
[1:36:58] called of God ordained by the world you
[1:37:00] as a church pay a certain price for
[1:37:02] being identified with me sure you do
[1:37:05] down in hell every preacher has a
[1:37:08] certain
[1:37:09] ID in Hell he's known as an intellectual
[1:37:12] he's known as a spiritual man he's known
[1:37:14] as whatever more and what that will be a
[1:37:17] sign certain damic powers demonic powers
[1:37:19] and forces that will be a sign to be
[1:37:22] able to try to go against that man and
[1:37:24] many times it will use this person that
[1:37:26] person that person that person sometimes
[1:37:28] from inside the church itself sometimes
[1:37:31] from outside but remember it's because
[1:37:34] hell identifies them as a threat and you
[1:37:38] come here you so oh man I thought I was
[1:37:40] doing pretty good till I moved here and
[1:37:42] once I got here all hell broke loose
[1:37:44] well praise God that's a good sign
[1:37:45] you're identified in hell with the
[1:37:48] ministry of Truth I'll tell you one
[1:37:50] thing I'd sure hate to be identified
[1:37:52] with the false prophet in hell wouldn't
[1:37:54] you I'd hate to be identified oh my as
[1:37:57] some false teacher that's leading people
[1:37:59] D stray if I'm going to be identified
[1:38:01] let me identify with men of God with the
[1:38:05] truths of the
[1:38:08] hour now watch as the ministry of the
[1:38:12] Bride we are then to minister to our
[1:38:16] husband what does my husband
[1:38:19] need what would the Lord God Almighty
[1:38:22] need
[1:38:25] love
[1:38:28] Fellowship
[1:38:30] praise adoration you see this is in his
[1:38:34] condensed
[1:38:37] form how many people has blasphemed his
[1:38:40] name this
[1:38:42] week how many people have said there is
[1:38:45] no
[1:38:46] God and they breathe his air every day
[1:38:51] they drink his water they eat his food
[1:38:54] they live on his Planet this don't
[1:38:57] belong to us it belongs to him they
[1:39:00] breathe his oxygen that he created they
[1:39:02] they they benefit by his ozone which he
[1:39:05] put upon the Earth they benefit by his
[1:39:09] trees that he made which processes
[1:39:12] through chlorophyll and is able to
[1:39:14] filter out all the gases they benefit
[1:39:17] every day of their life but all the
[1:39:19] things he has provided and will they
[1:39:21] Minister back to him and and thank him
[1:39:26] no that's your
[1:39:29] place one child of God which is a priest
[1:39:33] of God in the presence of the
[1:39:36] almighty can do more to minister to the
[1:39:39] Lord God than thousands times thousands
[1:39:44] of church members that's
[1:39:46] right church members praise too church
[1:39:50] members worship
[1:39:51] sure we know the casual atics in this
[1:39:54] day man they're all about worship ain't
[1:39:55] much about the word but they're all
[1:39:57] about worship so they sing and they
[1:39:58] Swoon and they swiggle and you know they
[1:40:00] do all the things that they do and all
[1:40:02] that sort of thing but unless you're
[1:40:04] worshiping in God's provided place he
[1:40:07] don't receive the worship of the hour
[1:40:10] and remember the manifestation of the
[1:40:11] name of God is the word interpreted so
[1:40:13] you've got to be at the right spot you
[1:40:15] couldn't just go these priests couldn't
[1:40:16] just go out under a tree and do this
[1:40:19] they had to be at a certain spot in a
[1:40:20] certain location and they didn't pick
[1:40:23] the spot fight God did I said God
[1:40:26] did oh my notice question answer 64 they
[1:40:31] came to the Judgment he came with him
[1:40:34] 10,000s times 10 thousands is that right
[1:40:37] they ministered to him the
[1:40:40] bride
[1:40:42] queen and king who is your little
[1:40:47] Queen in the
[1:40:51] home she ministers food to you is that
[1:40:55] right you see she ministers to you the
[1:41:00] bride ministers to
[1:41:03] Christ the
[1:41:07] word
[1:41:09] sir ain't it amazing but we've got that
[1:41:12] so one-sided that the way we look at it
[1:41:15] preachers preach to us and tell us the
[1:41:17] word and Sunday school teachers and you
[1:41:19] know youth groups and and all that the
[1:41:21] word the word the word that's only part
[1:41:23] of it that's right you are actually
[1:41:26] supposed to minister the word back to
[1:41:29] him that's
[1:41:34] right so if a man is a so breed winner
[1:41:37] in the home and he goes out and makes a
[1:41:38] living he buys the groceries of course
[1:41:41] he may not be able to make enough in
[1:41:42] this day the way as high as inflation is
[1:41:44] but he he makes the groceries and his
[1:41:46] wife goes out and gets them and brings
[1:41:47] him back home and then the man you know
[1:41:50] the woman puts it all together and has a
[1:41:51] nice meal for him and but but she takes
[1:41:55] what he paid for and ministers
[1:41:58] it back to
[1:42:01] him well could he not learn how to cook
[1:42:04] hary's a pretty good cook Justin's a
[1:42:06] pretty good cook probably some of you
[1:42:08] other brothers in your a pretty good cup
[1:42:10] present company left out of
[1:42:15] it so couldn't God have just created
[1:42:19] this love around him if he wanted it
[1:42:23] couldn't a man go to the grocery store
[1:42:26] and buy the same
[1:42:28] contents and fix his own
[1:42:36] meal and he could also sit down at the
[1:42:39] table by
[1:42:42] himself and eat
[1:42:49] it but oh how it is when you sit down at
[1:42:51] the table
[1:42:54] whether you're at home or a restur you
[1:42:56] reach over and grab your wife by the
[1:42:59] hand and say let's
[1:43:02] pray Oh Glory to
[1:43:06] God how the Lord Jesus longs to be this
[1:43:09] way in our lives that he can reach over
[1:43:13] and take hold of our hand and
[1:43:15] say let's pray
[1:43:18] sweetheart Lord let's love together
[1:43:22] let's fight fight
[1:43:26] together I cannot
[1:43:29] imagine with all all I've been through
[1:43:32] as a as a preacher and my position in
[1:43:35] life and you can relate the same way in
[1:43:37] your position in life I cannot imagine
[1:43:40] what it would be for me to try to face
[1:43:43] that without my dear
[1:43:46] Carol I think about my little friend
[1:43:48] down in Louisiana today
[1:43:55] having to
[1:43:56] go through the rest of his life without
[1:43:59] sister
[1:44:02] Karen getting texts from him and
[1:44:05] expressing to me the sadness and the
[1:44:09] loneliness in his
[1:44:11] heart why in the beginning he was not
[1:44:14] made to live in Paradise
[1:44:19] alone this is why Adam forfeited
[1:44:24] everything you imagine a flashback of
[1:44:27] time when you realize what she had done
[1:44:31] and he thought I cannot live here by
[1:44:37] myself I'd like to preach it to you
[1:44:40] sometime for the love of a
[1:44:47] woman the prophet said she ministers
[1:44:50] food to you is that right the bride
[1:44:53] ministers to Christ the word man shall
[1:44:55] not live by bread alone but every word

[1:45:04] encouragement we need the word for
[1:45:06] promises to base our our healing and our
[1:45:09] Bill of Rights does he need healing no
[1:45:13] does he need Deliverance for something
[1:45:15] no but you see what he wants to do is he
[1:45:18] wants to hear us tell him how great he
[1:45:22] is oh yes sir GL and when you're facing
[1:45:27] the greatest trial of your life and you
[1:45:30] take his word and say but Lord Jesus you

[1:45:47] through that it's costing you listen

[1:46:48] for this word oh my but I'm convinced of
[1:46:51] this the things that we go through in
[1:46:52] this life are not even worthy to be
[1:46:55] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:46:57] revealed in us at that day but I'm not

[1:47:16] are my deliverer you are my savior
[1:47:28] he could have bypassed all of this had
[1:47:31] he so desired sir all this space of
[1:47:37] time went straight to the Lamb's Book of
[1:47:40] Life and started with the letter A or
[1:47:42] the first letter in the Hebrew and spoke
[1:47:45] every one of his children's names from
[1:47:47] that book into
[1:47:51] existence he could have them gathered
[1:47:53] them around him and they would have
[1:47:55] looked at his exalted glory and he could
[1:47:58] have said to them
[1:48:00] children I could have been a savior I
[1:48:03] could have been a redeemer a
[1:48:06] heater but alas all of you are spoken
[1:48:11] word you're a SE genene Hallelujah you
[1:48:15] are a sophony you are a glorified body
[1:48:18] so you can never
[1:48:21] fall and he could a said I I could have
[1:48:24] saved you Daniel I could have saved you
[1:48:26] Harry I could have saved you
[1:48:30] Emma but now I can't cuz you're
[1:48:34] perfect on but when it's all set and
[1:48:37] down at the end we gather around Papa's
[1:48:41] throne and there we are by the millions
[1:48:45] and we're ministering unto him it won't
[1:48:47] be him telling us it'll be us telling
[1:48:51] him am I was lost and you saved me I was
[1:48:56] sick and you healed me I was bound I was
[1:49:00] under oppression I was under depression
[1:49:02] I was under anxiety and last Wednesday
[1:49:05] night you come by and set me free Oh
[1:49:08] Glory to God we will praise we will
[1:49:11] Adore we will worship him for the
[1:49:15] ceaseless
[1:49:17] ages this is only your warmup time bride
[1:49:21] get ready I said get ready you are going
[1:49:26] to worship your husband
[1:49:39] forever let me just share a little
[1:49:41] something here with you for before I
[1:49:45] close brother Brown was down in Kentucky
[1:49:48] brother Charlie coxes
[1:49:53] there was a power line that come
[1:49:54] underneath brother Charlie's driveway so
[1:49:56] you turn in off of that road there I've
[1:49:58] been many times you turn in off of that
[1:50:01] road and pull in that driveway up the
[1:50:03] driveway sort of like that and there's
[1:50:04] some power lines right across the
[1:50:07] driveway so brother BR him had been
[1:50:09] there hunting with brother Charlie him
[1:50:10] and some other brothers and while he was
[1:50:12] there he
[1:50:14] noticed there was a mother Dove sitting
[1:50:17] out there in those par
[1:50:19] lines and he said in the evening that
[1:50:21] mother would take her little
[1:50:23] babies and they would sit out there in
[1:50:25] the power line and they' take their
[1:50:28] necks and just kind of hook around each
[1:50:30] other and they just sit there
[1:50:33] C
[1:50:36] Co and she would C to
[1:50:41] them and they would go back to
[1:50:45] her and the father would come over and
[1:50:47] they just saw sitting there just cooing
[1:50:51] cing now notice that that picture there
[1:50:54] he said and I thought of how
[1:50:58] God of the dove is such a loving burden
[1:51:01] God wanting to make love with these
[1:51:05] human
[1:51:05] beings God wants to be loved God wants
[1:51:09] to love you for God so loved the world
[1:51:11] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:51:13] whosoever perish or whosoever believes
[1:51:15] in Him should excuse me should not
[1:51:16] perish but have everlasting life blessed
[1:51:19] be the Lord then God warning to make
[1:51:24] love he had to make something
[1:51:29] lovable So Adam was so
[1:51:34] lovable so
[1:51:37] lovable you know to me one of the
[1:51:39] saddest things I've ever seen in my life
[1:51:41] it's a human being that don't know how
[1:51:43] to
[1:51:44] love and I've had to deal with a lot of
[1:51:46] them in my
[1:51:47] Ministry it's like they don't know how
[1:51:49] to do it I've had family members
[1:51:54] ants uncles whatever that word that way
[1:51:57] it's like they could never tell you they
[1:51:59] loved you it's not they could never say
[1:52:03] I appreciate you or acknowledge any good
[1:52:06] thing you've ever done it's not they
[1:52:08] just can't
[1:52:09] relate they could relate to your cousins
[1:52:11] maybe or you know somebody else some
[1:52:13] stranger out there but never relate to
[1:52:15] you as a child don't raise your hand but
[1:52:17] some of you know what I'm talking
[1:52:19] about so Adam was so
[1:52:23] lovable and we've all been around people
[1:52:25] that you know you don't know where to
[1:52:26] shake their hand or not it's like
[1:52:28] grabbing hold of a dragon's tail you
[1:52:32] know you know if they like you if they
[1:52:34] hate you they want to Slit your throat
[1:52:36] or what you don't you understand what
[1:52:37] I'm saying they're just not very lovable
[1:52:41] but can you imagine Adam in the Garden
[1:52:43] of Eden he was so
[1:52:46] lovable and those first years of his
[1:52:48] life When papa would come down in the
[1:52:50] garden and they'd go to church together
[1:52:52] every
[1:52:54] day and papa would come down that pillar
[1:52:56] fire and he start
[1:53:04] woo and Adam way on the west side of the
[1:53:07] garden he
[1:53:11] said Lord
[1:53:19] God so here they'd come together
[1:53:23] and he say
[1:53:24] son how's everything been today oh
[1:53:29] papa it's been so
[1:53:32] wonderful I was just out there on the
[1:53:34] West Side just looking I saw some trees
[1:53:36] that I hadn't seen
[1:53:38] before I was just marveling in your
[1:53:41] majesty I saw some birds there with
[1:53:44] plumage that I'd never noticed before
[1:53:47] and I saw some animals there tell me
[1:53:50] about it oh papa they were just you know
[1:53:52] know they were so big and and they had
[1:53:54] this and they this and I was just
[1:53:56] thinking how great you
[1:53:58] are I wonder for you come here son sit
[1:54:02] down by me just just tell
[1:54:06] me but then whenever he'd say Papa thank
[1:54:10] you for coming down he said yeah I want
[1:54:11] to I want to kiss a good night and I'll
[1:54:14] see you
[1:54:16] tomorrow but then Adam would lay there
[1:54:19] in a bed of leaves Maybe
[1:54:23] kind of turn and toss he'd say what's
[1:54:25] wrong with
[1:54:27] me what's wrong with
[1:54:32] me why do I have this yearning for
[1:54:36] something I've got
[1:54:38] everything a man would want and if I
[1:54:42] want anything else he'll give it to
[1:54:48] me but I'm reminded of the story of
[1:54:50] Michaelangelo
[1:54:54] when he goes to the great
[1:54:56] big spot where they
[1:54:59] mine the stone the white Carrera
[1:55:05] marble and he looks at this massive
[1:55:07] piece of stone puts his
[1:55:10] hands behind just back this
[1:55:13] way he walks around and looks at it and
[1:55:16] says
[1:55:26] so he made a complete circumference
[1:55:28] around it a couple of
[1:55:30] times and the people there with him said
[1:55:33] what is
[1:55:35] it he said I see an
[1:55:39] image wanting to be released oh
[1:55:46] yeah
[1:55:49] amen now I got to be honest with you
[1:55:52] when I look at a rock I don't see
[1:55:56] that I may look at you and you may look
[1:55:59] at me and all we say is just a wasted
[1:56:02] human a flawed human one that is messed
[1:56:06] up big time but aren't you glad the Lord
[1:56:09] God can walk around us and say I see an
[1:56:14] image that's wanting to be delivered
[1:56:16] from that sin
[1:56:27] let me close with
[1:56:31] this God
[1:56:34] is a
[1:56:37] lover God is love and God so loved the
[1:56:40] world when they were
[1:56:43] unlovable that he gave his
[1:56:46] son to make them
[1:56:50] lovable listen this carefully
[1:56:53] here it is God wants to come
[1:56:56] down and make love to
[1:56:58] you he's
[1:57:00] seeking
[1:57:02] thirsting
[1:57:04] hungering trying to get to some of your
[1:57:07] starchy
[1:57:08] Hearts to make love to you as a love
[1:57:12] affair not a
[1:57:15] law can you imagine almighty God seeking
[1:57:24] thirsting
[1:57:27] hungry Lord have
[1:57:31] mercy God is
[1:57:34] looking and
[1:57:36] trying and
[1:57:39] moving and
[1:57:43] begging
[1:57:45] persuading to find a little heart that
[1:57:49] he can come into and cool
[1:57:52] and make love
[1:57:56] to why would we make almighty
[1:58:00] God
[1:58:04] beg
[1:58:05] beg you know what I say shame on all of
[1:58:09] us amen you agree brother Danny shame on
[1:58:14] all of
[1:58:15] us if I would make God beg for 5 minutes
[1:58:20] 10 minutes of my time

[1:58:26] Droid not God and this and God and that
[1:58:31] but you and God
[1:58:34] Amen lot of y'all got Sanctified from
[1:58:36] cigarettes and you got Sanctified from
[1:58:38] drinking alcohol I'm begin to wonder if
[1:58:40] we don't need some sanctification from
[1:58:42] our smartphones on
[1:58:54] let's bury
[1:58:59] it your
[1:59:01] right to a position like
[1:59:04] this God offers you
[1:59:07] friends a position that is so sacred and
[1:59:11] so holy that Angels can't even have it
[1:59:17] cherubims cannot have what I've preached
[1:59:19] to you today
[1:59:22] you imagine Holy Angels that have never
[1:59:24] sinned never
[1:59:26] lied never done anything
[1:59:29] wrong and yet God does not offer them
[1:59:32] this
[1:59:33] position but God offers it to you today
[1:59:36] and
[1:59:38] I well we can love him we can serve him
[1:59:41] we can Praise Him many of you already
[1:59:43] have that you know you do but the thing
[1:59:46] of it is after God gives it to you the
[1:59:47] devil will try to make you so busy and
[1:59:50] occupy you with so much stuff of
[1:59:53] life to where that we make our father
[1:59:55] our husband hunger and thirst and
[2:00:02] beg oh my I wonder how many of your

[2:00:38] best cook in the country and how happy
[2:00:40] you are she's a mother of your children
[2:00:42] how much you love her and well you see
