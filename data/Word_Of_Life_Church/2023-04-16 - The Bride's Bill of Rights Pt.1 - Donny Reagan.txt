the Lord if you know that to be true today ought to be the happiest person in the world to be able to experience true love perfect love you realize there's been billions and billions of people that have lived on the face of the Earth but more than likely a tenth of them attempts they've been the only ones who ever experienced perfect love others experience all kinds of love love as degrees perverted love Strange Love warped to love but perfect love what an awesome thing that is God bless you you can be a city we've got a baby to dedicate before we go to the word and we're just in Sydney we'll bring a little Sun Jew today will dedicate him to the Lord [Music] bring down [Music] bring the little ones I guess this is the last one too bear the Reagan name finally a boy Heavenly fathers we stand you in your presence today we're so grateful for the gift of life if we had all the wealths of the world and yet died we had every fine automobile lived in the finest homes what would all be worse if we didn't have life so life is a great thing we're thankful Lord Jesus that you've given to us the privilege of life father is Justin and Sydney bring the little son Jude Harrison Reagan into your presence today I know this thing here was gratitude in their hearts and so happy I pray Lord that you would just help them we know that these children don't come with a manual they don't come with a how-to book to tell us how to raise them so you gave us one yourself your scripture and we're thankful Lord that you've given a set I pray that should help both of them to be able to instill in him that which will be lasting Justin might be able to teach him different things that he knows no doubt Sydney could teach him things that she knows but yet if it would only be in this life and things pertaining to this life then what would happen when this life is over so what I believe they want to instill in him is those things that will get him on the other side to the real continuation of life so we're bringing before you today Father I pray that you keep him from the evils of this day Tom will Terry get old enough to be able to acknowledge and receive you may do it while he's tender Lord keep him from the sickness the diseases the plagues of humanity we're dedicate his little life to you today the life of service in the name of the Lord Jesus amen [Applause] you saw a rare thing that's the only few times I've ever seen these eyes God bless you to stand together I'm under such expectations today what our Lord is gone to speak to us Mark chapter 16 verse 17. while you're turning there I want to want to speak to you today on the brides bill of Rights the bride's bill of Rights and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover behold notices Luke chapter 10 verse 19 as well Mark catches it quite unlike on any of the rest of the gospel writers but Luke pins this in this way with the commission given to the apostles behold I give unto you power To Tread on serpents and scorpions and Over All the power of the enemy I guess the question is do we believe that now in the New Testament whenever we see the word power there's a couple different Greek words that was actually used for it in the original one of them is excusia which is an authority given to you to do something but it doesn't mean you have that power dwelling in you that's excusia so this is what Jesus gave to the apostles initially an authority sort of like a State Trooper or a policeman or a deacon somebody that's given Authority but it's not that they have that Authority dwelling in them but it's given to them then the other word that's used the way we translate it power in the New Testament is dunamis and that is where we get our word Dynamite from and it's the power of an inherent life so it's something actually within you that's coming out expressing itself notice Jesus says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you let me bless him nothing shall by enemies oh but you say brother Donnie what about sickness what about that can't hurt you I know it seems strange people think my that is the craziest thing I ever heard in my life no it just can't hurt the real you or it might bother your body it might bother your spirit but your spirit is not you your body is not you I made like to remember today as we pray I'd like you to remember me as well the Lord just helped me hear him speak to us today father we're so grateful today to be in your house and thankful for each one that's your present Lord for those that are streaming the service around the world those that will go back and archive it we pray for them as well today Father those that are sick that would love to be here and cannot now we're bringing our requests and our needs before you we're so needy as we stand here Lord no doubt in my mind I'm the most native person here today because I have to stand before these people and try to bring something of Eternal value and eternal quality how can I do such How can any man do such there's only one way possible that is if you take this vessel of humanity and anoint that gift that you've placed within me and help me to get out of the way and speak your heart your mind and your thoughts so father we're expecting for you to do that great thing today in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated being American citizens I'm sure that most of us know that we have a constitution we have of course our branches of government that were set up by our founding fathers they establish this nation on the principles that it would be unlike where they came from which was England for the power of the King was the final word he didn't have to have witnesses against you to be able to take her life if he wanted to kill you he could if they wanted to do whatever they wanted to do take your property confiscate your goods they could do that but when our founding fathers came here so many many years ago they wanted to establish a government they called it for the people and by the people it's too bad that our leaders today still don't believe the same thing then there was something that they decided to do a few years later after 1776 whenever they started sending it in motion and their great fathers gathered together and I put together the great Constitution and what they believed that it should be but as they went on with this newly founded government they realized that there were some things that needed to be further clarified so the people that are the citizens of this newfound democracy as they call it they would need certain rights they would need certain things that would protect them just in case the government ever got out of control again Smart Guys wouldn't they now they felt like that probably even in this thing called the Democracy that it was not perfect and of course we know that it's not but they wanted again to give the constituents of this democracy something that they felt like would bring the government down from the White House and Congress and Senate and all of that down to the individual the poor common farmer the poor common housewife and the you know the little person that was illiterate and that was not famous or important so they decide they designed this rather something that they would give to the common people as well as the elected officials and they called it a Bill of Rights a Bill of Rights I haven't heard of it how many of you know what's each one of your rights are sure ah we're true Americans now look at what that does to us now we're American citizens most of us I'm sure and yet we have this Bill of Rights and most of us probably don't even know what's in it that gives you the right to this and the right to that testing one two about my microphone so isn't it amazing what democracy will do though it will make you to where you're so trusting that you just accept whatever they say and you say it well surely they wouldn't do anything to me that's contrary to the law well let me tell you surely they will they will so they designed this now let me read this to you what the Bill of Rights means the Bill of Rights guarantees the liberty of the individual and limits the power of the government in judicial and in other proceedings the U.S Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and no doubt there's millions of Americans that have lived born died and all this and this nation never even knew what their rights were and some of them no doubt were prosecuted by the government or by other people and if they would have known their rights they could have stopped it in its tracks but the lawyers knew their ignorance and the lawyers by being able to talk to them knew they did not know their rights given to them by their own government so they took advantage of them so this bill this Bill of Rights then was set aside so that it would protect us you can see there what it is it guarantees among many other things the rights of free speech oh okay now do you honestly believe that is being honored in our nation come on now well it depends on what you're saying if you're saying what the woke generation wants you to say they believe you ought to have free speech until you say something contrary to them then they want to take your free speech from you but you're looking at one little Kentucky hillbilly that knows my Bill of Rights and not shut me up so by the Bill of Rights I have the right to the freedom of speech now a lot of people know this so they will not try to shut you down by the law but they will try to shut you down by pressure so they'll try to call your name or put your name in of your face in the paper or you know put you on TV or whatever and then it will cause all kinds of pressure on you don't you see why that our nation is heading straight for the pits of hell because they don't have laws to be able to do a lot of the things they're doing but they will put pressure on these corporations and these corporations don't want to be identified as you know somebody that don't it's not all inclusive on everything so they want to include everybody which means include the wrong and hate the right that's what inclusive means so they want to let everybody know where they stand and they will do their advertisements who in the world ever thought years ago that television would ever allow two men to be on their kissing whoever assault had ever allowed two women to be on there well don't get quiet on me already now you see brother Donnie you shouldn't say that oh but my Bill of Rights gives me the right to say that so I have the right of the freedom of speech I have the right of freedom of religion and you better enjoy that while you can because it ain't going to be much longer that's going to be taken away from us oh you said church will always be here well the church may always be but the bride won't be so if you want to go to church you better go by Going's good that's right so we have the Fright of the freedom of speech we have the right of religion to choose whatever religion that we want and we also just to mention the three of them we have a right given to us of trial by jury now why is that important see to us we don't even think that much about it well because them coming from England and coming from the European nations that was ruled by Kings and monarchs if they didn't like you they would be able to fabricate some some sources and fabricate some witnesses that lied against you and the King could pick at your property he could send you to jail for the rest of your life or basically take your life from you so the founding fathers wanted this to be inclusive in our rights as American citizens that we would have a right to trial by jury now even as good as that is but they have found ways around that to be able to bribe the people bribe Witnesses bribe jurors and so on but let me tell you something friends I'm glad we're serving a God today who also has another book of Rights now this one here a big portion of them no doubt as we go on in time little by little they're being taken away from us now any government any body of legislation the judicial branch the presidential branch that would try to come all outright and take all of these from from us they know better there's too many of us Americans are still on guns they know better than that so they won't do it outright but they'll do it little by little by little by little and we sit right here and watched them do it and we don't say anything and we just go ahead and let them do it and before long we're going to wake up and realize that we are in another Nation that's different from ours what is it it's become a Banana Republic well praise the Lord third world country that's what we're heading for well while our nation's heading for a third world country I'm heading to a third pool country amen they can have this place they can do whatever they want to with it but the Lord spoke this to me this week and I don't mind telling you I was just kind of shocked when I heard the voice of God say these words the bride's Bill of Rights it just kind of set me back a little bit Harry and I had to say it I was praying thinking meditating on the word and as I began to think about it and I started repeating what I heard the spirit of God say and then all this started coming together and I thought wow that's absolutely wonderful but unlike our government our heavenly father does not give us a list of our rights and then in time turns around and takes them all back away from us and somehow convince us that he's doing it for our good you see our founding fathers recognize that with a democracy it was not perfect so there was faults and flaws in the system and we can see it surely our nation being around for all these years now and we can see that there's death and flaws in democracy the prophet tells us it's all it's all sales and know when to be able to drive it but yet we also know there's great Liberties but we are so trusting now believe me being in China and preaching in China being there when brother biscoll was arrested and them them also looking for me but they thought I was a Canadian so brother biscoll had my itinerary in his briefcase and we was going in separate cities different directions and when they arrested him he took my itinerary Torrid into pieces and ate it a piece at a time to keep them from Finding Me So he was a Canadian they assumed I was a Canadian so they started searching all the passport entries for Donald Lee Reagan Jr a Canadian but they found out I wasn't a Canadian so they come back and ask him again is this man a Canadian so he had to tell them the truth no he's not a Canadian he's an American citizen well then they started looking for me as an America now be being there in China and watching the Chinese people how they would assemble and they were so leery of everyone they were so leery of everybody and as I watched it I realized that democracy tends to rock us to sleep and we're so trusting We Trust our government we trust lawyers We Trust preachers that's one of the worst butts you can trust I'm telling you right now we just trust people we're just so trusting and we are so gullible and so foolish at times because we trust everybody but watching the Chinese and how they would do for instance in one city whenever I was there whenever you would step off of the elevator a big hotel where we were at and hadn't rented a room a sweet thing there they had two three different rooms so we could have services so whenever you step off of the elevator there's a chair and a man sitting this close to you so when you step off the elevator it's an armed guard and he's stepping right there to look at you and he's seeing which direction you go you go left or to the right and he makes a note of which room you go into he notices everybody that comes into your room he has a time of everybody coming in everybody going now now I guarantee you one thing if we started noticing that by our government it would make us a little bit more suspicious would it not so the Believers would have to start coming about an hour before service and that Meander around and go down here and turn around and come back and go down there but you know what it didn't hinder the move of the Holy Ghost at all because this one lady come in and they had to push her in at a wheelchair and as I began to speak the word and begin to preach under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and pray for that woman I saw an absolute miracle from God because I saw that woman stand up which was crippled and could not walk in and whenever that woman left she pushed her wheelchair out that's the kind of God I'm talking about now you say brother Donnie you mean you believe that power is still here I know it's still here now why do I believe that because I read it to you today from your book of Rights these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils have we seen it done so that is our Bill of Rights but it's always Satan is always trying to take away from us what belongs to us now of course we know that he he controls the power of the government of every nation and that's why that our nation itself it was a good idea good principle and it lasted for a long time but it will not endure We Know by prophecy in Revelation 13 this is the chapter that the United States is found in and it was a beast that raised up that John saw not come up out of the water like the Beast of Revelation 17. or the other Beast that he saw but this Beast raised it up from among people which was and it had two tiny horns it was civil and ecclesiastical power so this Beast raised up out from among people a nation in other words and then this Beast it was given the authority to speak as the Beast before it which of course is going to become the Antichrist and the mark of the beast so the civil and ecclesiastical power representing the horns and what was that animal that John saw now remember John lived in the country near the Mediterranean so John had never seen an American Buffalo or a bison but the prophet tells us that what that Beast was was actually a buffalo so it was a bison but John didn't know what to call it so he just looks and says there was a peculiar looking beast and you can imagine him seeing a buffalo it never seen one in his life and it had short horns and represented civil and ecclesiastical power so that would come to a great power it for years would be the greatest nation on the earth and she has been is she not but little by little she's losing her power over the nation little by little the U.S dollar China right now is uniting with Russia and uniting with Iran and they're trying to make another Power one of the first things they want to do is to be able to bring the US dollar to its knees and they're trying their best right now with the Chinese currency with Aruba From Russia with the Iranian currency to bring together it's going on every day open your eyes children Where We Are and what will it do it will bring our nation to its knees you say why would God do that because God gave this nation its Liberty God gave this nation this place to worship and they started out praying and seeking God and now many of them will let you know they don't even want God in their Courthouse no more they don't want God in their schools and the truth of it is a lot of the churches don't want God in their churches no more I hope and pray we never get to that place oh my if you folks get to the place you don't want God here I ain't welcome neither and your word Jesus ain't welcome don't look for me because I won't hang around long I want you to notice of what God wanted to designate to his people and gives them a bill I can call it that a Bill of Rights now in that bill it would give them the authority to certain things what does the right do now we know we're living of course in an age when people's rights is such a big thing and they've got a right to do this and a right to do that and a right to do something else and they don't just want you and I to acknowledge their rights we want they want us to bow to their rights you think the transgender saying and all that it's just so that they can be able to get equal rights oh no they don't want no equal rights they want rights above your own they want you to bow to them and acknowledge them as being normal I'm sorry take my eyes out cut my ears off cut my tongue out that is not normal no no I don't care what you say well Glory I want you to notice now that God in order to give this Bill of Rights he himself must come now he knew that it would take many thousands of years for it to come to the spot that it would be that his people would be able to acknowledge it and have the power within them to live out the rights once they find out about it now you know how it is in our judicial system if you're a rich person and you're a rich kid then your daddy can pretty much get you out of anything you get involved in and now don't sit there and look at me funny it's the truth if you've got money money talks and you can be able to get a rich lawyer know how to pull this string and do this and that and the other and you take a lot of the poor kids if they get out and do whatever they do that's wrong they ain't got a Fighting Chance well come on now they are a minority that's right and because of that then they don't always know their rights well let me write a parallel to you in the same way that if say who can keep us from knowing our rights he will rob from us the various things the Lord Jesus paid for and gave to us is that right now because it comes by the power of God now God gives it in a divided form by that I mean God gives it to us in the written word so the written word would be the written Bill of Rights but the written Bill of Rights does not give you the power within yourself to be able to stand and claim what is yours now you can read it and memorize it in your mind and in your spirit but it takes more than just your mind and your spirit to be able to inherit your entire book so just imagine when you get saved that God gives you your own personal book of Rights and God makes a deposit by calling on you and of course drawing that seed of life which is inside of you into a spot to where it can be sparked to life back when that himself starts your journey and God then starts letting you set under Ministry Ministry that will tell you who you are what you were what you come from where you're going and what will they do they want to bring you to an understanding really in one sense of the word god called preachers are like lawyers they are men that want to Define to you you're right so you've got a right to go here you've got a right to do this and you don't have a right to do that and you don't have a right to do that you understand so God knew that it would take this on the earth to be able to help the people of God to find out who they were so God started giving man then a little bit of his rights in the Garden of Eden and he gave to Adam and Eve the opening we see the first glimpse into the book of Rights or the the Bill of Rights whenever a man was placed in the Garden of Eden and though that man was placed on a probationary period to see what would he do what would he do was what God gave him how would he treat this book how would he be able to evalue it in his own eyes in comparison to other things and as we know Adam didn't do very well with him so Adam chose his wife over the book of Rights and the Bill of Rights so then what he did he forfeited eternal life so God then in turn has to come back and God makes the man and the woman leave the garden of Edom but God gives them a promise I will restore you I I will bring you back back to what just a beautiful place just a place for this nice big beautiful trees and all the animals are tamed there is that all God wants us to have no there's more than that God wants to bring us back to a spot to where the Earth will never again ever hear the Rumble of Thunder that the Earth will never be able to bury one child there'll never be one person there that will ever die oh what a lamb there'll never be one there that will ever cry or sadness or sorrow will ever strike their heart but it all must be brought back under the law of reconciliation so God must reconcile this human race back to himself so how does he do it well of course God has a Judicial Court and God has an appellate court and God has lawyers and God has representatives and then God also has an end which is of course the attorney for the other side and that attorney from the other side knows his rights as a matter of fact he knows not only his but he knows yours I'd say probably knows ours a lot better than a lot of us know ours so he knows exactly how far he can go but he also knows that it's not just the law itself that will keep him from taking things from you but it will be your inability to withstand him and if you thinking well I ain't worthy and I ain't good enough I can never be good up well see right there you yourself are denying your Bill of Rights this Bill of Rights is not given to us based on our worthiness it's given to us because he wanted us to have it well if he wants me to have it I reckon I should have it anybody else feel the same way my goodness I could wait the rest of my life and never be worthy I could rate the rest of my life and so could you I never be of a character that well okay now I'm ready now I'm good enough now you know what knowing me if I did all that I'd get it in the next day I'd Die Subway said all my life wait you get good enough then I get good enough and I get the book and I'm sold I can't even read it no more what good does that do why not get it now and let the Holy Ghost inside of you help you to live better and do better and walk closer to God as you're growing while you're feeding on your Bill of Rights now since item forfeited life father must bring life back into the picture so no matter how many good things that we would have we could be the richest person on the earth we could own houses and lands and great possessions and be the CEO of all types of different things but really when it comes down to it what good is any of that if you don't have life you ever seen a CEO with all of his stocks and bonds and he's in his casket there well if you did they wouldn't wait there long everybody coming in will grab a hold of one and say God bless his heart hallelujah thank you Jesus well glory to God the Lord blessed me I went to that funeral Hallelujah I found me a couple of stocks you Thief so what good does all that do if you don't have life so God wanted to restore man to lie of course God sent the prophets they could never be able to bring life God sent the judicial system of the Old Testament which was the levitical law that could never bring life God gave the Ten Commandments could never bring life so God himself then the person of Life must come to the Earth in a form that could be a shareable form now listen to me that God must get his life back into the lives of individuals so how could he ever do that since God is eternal life and God can never die so God must come to the Earth in a form which can be assimilated now in other words God would change himself from the great Eternal that he was and come to the Earth in a human form called sonship and God would get inside that human sonship body and make that body where it would be able to be broken open for others and they would come to him and receive that life now notice it like this so here God comes to the Earth and second Corinthians 5 17 says God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so here is Christ the body The Vessel the bottle if you will but I'm not interested in drinking the bottle I don't need the bottle I need what's in this bottle to be able to help me because I'm already sweating sweating running down my back running down my face running down my legs so I need something that will help replenish me as I start sweating you agree with me so is it okay with you all if I take a little bit of refreshment is it okay with you if I get a little bit of what I need and I take that into me now this is separate from me it's not me as you know this is purple and I'm not purple this is potassium and this and that and the other and I have some of those things in me but they are getting depleted they're coming out of me as I'm standing here under the anointing so what I need is a little bit of help so God was in Christ reconciling the world now what I'm fixing to do is turn up the power of God and I just swallowed God now God was in the bottle but God cannot die so God had to open the bottle when the lid was broke or the seal was broke and then on the cross when he gave his wife to be a perpetuation for us how many he says amen he made a way then that we could drink him in praise the Lord and then he would start rushing through us as all of this is doing to me right now and it won't be long to where this will no longer be Gatorade but it will actually go into me and become me and I will become it so then I started the power of assimilation when I started to drink this so by drinking this I took it into my body now if that would have been dirt inside of there if there would have been Nails oh that would have been all kinds of other things you say I could not get any benefit out of that this is why friends that we must not come to just doctrines we must not just come to a knowledge of the word we must come to a spot of something that's compatible with us which is what life so God so loved the world that he gave us on the begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God said not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved then we start to assimilate by his great power the nature that was in the bottle so what was in the bottle Jesus Christ it was Mercy it was forgiveness it was love it was all of those great things that was in because God made himself in a transmissible form a form which could be received by a human being and it would start immediately changing their lives now when you receive him do you become perfect then absolutely not you keep on assimilating as you feed upon his word so God then must bring life back to man read with me if you were in Revelation chapter 22 verse 14. I want you to notice how John here writing down the words that was given to him on the Isle of Patmos blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have ah so this is in your Bill of Rights then blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right exclusion look at the word Authority right jurisdiction the ability or strength with which one is endued one who possesses Authority the sign of Regal Authority so there is a right to the tree of life now wait a minute isn't that what was in the Garden of Eden and God said lest the man should put forth his hand and take of the tree of life and God set faming cherubims at the entrance to the gate of the Garden of Eden and said man cannot come back in here until I have made myself into a form by which man can assimilate me into him and I will come into the man and as he drinks me and partakes of me I will change him from the inside out oh praise the Lord so notice John is the only one in the New Testament as far as the writers that actually mentions this this way that a person may have a right to the tree of life now this is my right if I obey God's word I'm called by him I have a right to the Tree of Life there is no Devils there is no church there is nobody that's going to keep me from my right to the Tree of Life now notice in Paradise When we arrive there the Bible tells us that those leaves on the trees will change every so often so every month every 30-day cycle period they will change and what was that it was supposed to do partaking from the trees in the Garden of Eden this is one thing that warded off old age he would never age so as we are eating off the tree of life our use is constantly renewed amen it's the same way with the word of God that's why whether you're 15 or 75 you can have Revival when everybody else's drying up blowing away why you're renewing your use in Christ Jesus amen the glory Never Dies now watch this again in Saint John 1 1 again the same writer just phrases things a little different he came into his own on his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power look at this word again excuse you so he came to his own his own received him not but to as many eyes drunk him in as many as received him to them gave he power not only to shout not only to be healed but to become the sons of God so he gives us a jurisdiction once we receive his life to become sons of God well let me just tell you right now if you ever become one you'll never become anything else whoa oh that I believe if you ever get into Jesus Christ and seal there by the Holy Ghost you'll never get out for him now notice John he said but as many eyes received him to them gave he excuse you again Authority right jurisdiction to become oh what a word what a word to become look at the meaning of it come to pass do you understand every son and daughter of God is a word from God laying in the annals of history and it takes the spirit of God to Quicken them and bring them to pass don't you understand why we are students of Prophecy and we believe prophecy do we not so a word may lay in the Bible for thousands of years that don't change nothing to us that does not mean it's not real it does not mean it's not genuine but what we know is that word has just not yet come to pass so every son and daughter that comes to God and enters into that great channel of his thinking and of his love God gives them the power to come to pass what are they a prophecy if you will and the prophecy was their name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world before there is ever a devil he spoke your name but for that's ever in his sickness he spoke your name and he spoke your name as a prophecy and there's only one way for you to come to pass the same God who spoke it has to Quicken the word first hundreds and hundreds of years Isaiah 7 14 late in the school a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son Thou shalt called his name Emmanuel you know the scripture very well it lay there for years and years 712 years but one day the spirit of God fell on that word and that virgin was walking down the street to a well and an angel of God met her what was God fixing to do help Mary come to pass don't you understand this is our time friends this is our day be encouraged today there's not enough powers of Darkness to stop this Pride from coming to pass Oh Glory to God notice so John says but as many as received him notice he doesn't say his ideology his his opinion don't receive doctrines but you receive him who is him the person of the word so as many I'm not talking about a Christ of a denominational view I'm talking about him not a third person the person amen as many as received him to them gave he gave he power exclusive Authority right jurisdiction to come to pass let me just tell you this morning you're looking at a Son of God that's coming to pass I believe I'm looking at Sons and Daughters of God that's coming to pass I've been coming to pass for a long time as a matter of fact I don't mind tell you I'm pretty glad today that I've been serving the lord Jesus since I was a 12 year old boy Lord willing in a couple of months Carol and I've been married 50 years and we'll turn 67. I don't mind telling you I am so happy I've been coming to pass since a 12 year old boy and I still ain't stopped coming to pass I'm still coming to pass well everybody here with me today you don't want to stop you don't want to get to a spot well I'm in I guess that's all they need oh no we want to keep on coming to pass word by word by word by word until we fulfill our position of what God wants us to be oh thank God notice the meaning of this word again it goes on to express it come to pass be done be fulfilled notice verse 13 this is really hard on some folks which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh now if you're a free real Baptist here today God bless you whoever you are but John John wasn't Free Will Baptist John believed God's will overrode free will according to your Bible here you did not become a child of God based on your will now this is your Bible [Music] which were born not of blood nor of the will again fella Mia the Greek word here the will of the flesh desire what one wishes or has determined shall be done which is the way the majority of Christendom preaches the new verse absolutely contrary to the scripture well Hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God I'll tell you one thing I wanted to discard God I got out of town I wanted to live for him I went up and I grabbed a hold of the horns of the altar oh no he grabbed the hold of your horns and throat your cigarettes out and your alcohol out of that whole filthy life that you was living and he'd rub you up to the altar come on somebody amen it wasn't you you love sucking on cigarette you love living the way you live but the Lord Jesus got a hold to you and said come on son it's your time to come to pass it's your time to be fulfilled which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man and where's that great big thing you've done but of God I'm so glad my salvation ain't based on my will I'm so glad your salvation ain't based on yours because there ain't no doubt in my mind a lot of you've done made up your mind I ain't serving him no more I'm quitting on this that another but whenever you made up your mind to leave he wouldn't let you go whenever you made up your mind I ain't going back to church no more I said oh yes you already get ready you're going to the house to start it's all I'm a little I said oh yes you are oh Jeremiah said I made up my mind I wasn't going to speak no more in the name of the Lord but Jeremiah said it was like a fire burning inside of my phone salvation is bigger than you salvation is bigger than me it's not my will it's not your will it's his [Applause] so my Bill of Rights says I have the right to be born of God now once I'm in now it opens up the whole new door of what's mine once I get in foreign Hebrews 13 9. be not carried away about with divers and strange doctrines for it is good a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited to them that have occupied there and I remember he's writing to the Jews and they're still struggling about meats and what's clean and unclean now watch Paul as he says we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle now he's running the contrast between the levitical order and the title of this book is Hebrews so that's who it's written to Jews and they're trying to merge the Mosaic law in to Christianity remember Paul didn't without the book of Galatians and he said them guys come through and they was projecting this false Doctrine in the churches that Paul established these false teachers got it and I'm telling them you've got to be circumcised and you can't do this and you can't do that you you go you got to have the law of Moses or you're not even saved Paul said what in the world's happened to you and they even turned them people against Paul can you imagine the people sitting there in the galatian church and some of these false teachers turned the very man that verse them under the word of God and they let a false teacher turn them against him oh my goodness now your Paul is showing them look you all are trying to emphasize the levitical order and the Mosaic law I'm a Torah and all of that and he said whenever we are baptized into the body we have an altar that you have no right to eat at anybody know what that means you see one the the Levites and the priest would receive the wave offering the heave offering God would say take this certain thing take the shoulder we'll say the shoulder of a sheep and the shoulder the ham of a real now I want you to only offer so much of that to me but then I want you to give the rest of that shoulder to the priest the Levites so they were considered that their their sustenance their natural sustenance that they were eating and fellowshipping was God from the same sacrifice why they would get a portion of God's offering wow that's your opponent saying you all want to push the law you want to push the levitical order he said well let me just tell you right now that once we are baptized into the body of Christ we are eating from another altar I didn't say there wasn't eating he just said we're eating from another Altar and the sacrifice on that altar is not around a turtle dove or a pigeon it was God himself made flesh and a human body oh Lord Jesus notice again Paul uses the same word excuse you we have an altar word of they have no right to eat which serve the talent so if you're still trying to serve God by do's and don'ts and this and that and the other oh yes there's do's and don'ts in the economy of God but we don't come to God by fulfilling do's and don'ts first we get saved then we do the deuce and we stop doing the don'ts a part of the sacrifice was given for them to eat and they partook of the sacrifice and it was their daily sustenance what in the world are you talking about I'm saying we have a right every day to eat the unfailing body word of the son of man you see many folks stop what's a Paschal sacrifice at the cross they never go any farther oh well yeah Jesus died for me Jesus thou all praise the Lord he died for me all those always died for me he died for me that's right but we are in order not after levitical order but the order from El Quezada and what did the priesthood do they did not stop and say okay well we brought that one off and we'll just stop they brought it day by day by day by day what does God want it to be with me and you well he saved me well that's good but are you eating of what he is and who he is and the character of his word well no come on eating of what he is good so you need all the cross meant to you is it just initially liberated you from your sin but you see to a real believer the cross becomes an altar and that we are baptized into the body by the Holy Ghost and as we are setting though we're feeding into our souls the revealing of the son of man which is the message of the hour Christ Jesus this is why we will eat ourselves to a body change [Applause] you see those who just acknowledge Him being on on the cross that's as far as they ever go but God in every age updated updated the church so they'd be able to catch the word for the day they lived that's why Luther caused some Revival Luther sat down at the table the Christ opened the book of Romans and he come out and said that Josh shall live by faith what Luther had he bit into a great big Lamb Chop Luther sunk his teeth down to that reveal word of the Earth come out there like a wild man say glory to God I'm free glory to God I'm free I don't have to do Penance no more I don't have to pray to Mary no more I don't like to pray to Joseph no more and that Lamb Chop was still sticking out between his teeth and the devil said good Lord what in the world is that so loser found his place at the altar if you're sitting here today and your son or daughter of God or you're streaming this service and your name is on the Book of Life not only is your name in The Book of Life but your name is on the table now I perform weddings in different parts in the United States and assisted in some different countries and it's being the minister or a singer or someone that will pray over them they want to give you a place of honor so that's enough you said over here and you said over here well how am I going to know where I'm going to say it brother Donnie your name will be near your seat right so you and sister Carol will set on so and so we had your name place that so I know when I woke up and I look at that brother Donnie Reagan now there might be other brother Donnie Reagan's in the world but that other brother Donnie Reagan didn't officiate in that wedding so I was known by my works and my identity with this family so I figure my name is Donnie Reagan that paper says Donnie Reagan so don't you try to get my seat because that ain't your name so if you can identify yourself with the family of God that you are a new creation Changed by the power of God and you can find your name you've got a right to sit down brother sit down sisters and feed on the unfainted word of the son of man United ones at the end time the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on right you're not feeding on a man that don't speak about everybody because that's what a lot of folks are feeding on that's why they can only receive from one preacher and the fat one preacher ain't preaching well I didn't get nothing out of service I say shame on you you go to church in the right attitude I believe you'll get something no matter who's preaching notice the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so it's your rights so you say well I try to read the Bible and I don't get nothing out of it ah don't you see what that Devil's doing you realize one of the best sleeping pills you'll ever get in your life is a Bible or a message book you can sit there and look at outdoor living and you look oh my lord it's 1 30 in the morning oh my goodness I got so caught up on Facebook oh my goodness I got I got so caught up on this and that and the other and you pick up your Bible and you're as wide awake as you are right now or some of you anyway and you sit there and read your Bible and in a few minutes yeah yeah all right yes sir why the devil's trying to pull you away from your table so let me ask you some of your brothers worked hard all day you go in my goodness you open that door and that Aroma of your favorite meal smacks you on the face now you're going to clean this for five of them taters however you like them and she's cooked that corn however you like it and she's cooked a big fat hamburger a big old ham roast whatever it is and you walk on that so oh oh I can't wait honey I'm gonna go get me a shower I'm gonna come in and sit down and boy everything seems all Rosy and you walk in and sit down and she says this ain't for you you said what do you mean this is my favorite meal because you didn't you didn't kiss me when you come here you didn't say how has your day been the only thing you got on your mind is that have meat boy you ain't getting none of that old hand me what's she trying to do she trying to rob you if you're right you paid for that ham mer oh my God all right people say well I would go to church but there's Hypocrites there I agree with you they are you'll let that keep you from going to Pizza Hut you let that shot people going to Walmart you know that's how stop you from going to Target or whatever more no you go right in there beside everything in the world you get what you want and you walk out that's the way it ought to be at the house of God I'm not coming to look at the Hypocrites I'm not going to let them hinder me I'm going to pull my feet under his table I'm gonna see on that unfailing body word it's my ride we ain't gonna have time to get into this but I'm going to get into it a little bit another one of my rights and yours wake up devil here we come is to be like the original Church those from the church age book an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change and the church said [Applause] apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first church age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all other agents what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in what so this is our old people say well poor brother Donnie he's Pentecostal thank you for that compliment [Applause] I am absolutely oh not 1906 but original Acts 2. I'll tell what I want around here I want to have the kind of church around here that if Peter wants to walk in them middle doors right there he'd come down the middle of screaming holler and shouting glory to God that's the same way the kind of church we had on the day of Pentecost Paul would come right down through that door Thomas would come right down through that door and James and all the rest of the Apostles say glory to God Brothers looked at this we didn't have this nice of carpet and we sure didn't have these lights and all these fancy things on the wall but boy we had the same Holy Ghost we have the same power except the captain free Healing The Sick race of the Dead casting out devil why do we want it brother Jonathan it's all right [Applause] thank you what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other eggs the thing of it is do we want what he wants now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first or the original church is founded and how God manifested himself and heard the word can't change or be changed because the word of God oh notices then that church is at Pentecost is the standard thank you what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern now my wife is an expert seamstress she sowed since she was a little girl how was it when your grandma would touch you four three years old setting her Grandma's lap and her grandma would use that old sewing machine hell has ever seen one of them I've done some young people don't want me to talk about it well that's the old travel top where you sit there and pump it with your feet and her grandma would hold her in her lap while she sewed and taught her how to sew she's made absolutely beautiful things of course cannot so but what I have done is helped her place the pattern on top of the material so depending on what she's making so when she started doing this curtain sharing done many things that are really really big and large as she did over here in the fellowship hall that was too big for her to hold so I was a good little helper but she wouldn't want to see anything I ever sowed that's for sure but I know enough about patterns to know that the pattern comes in a little piece of paper a box or whatever it is and then they make that pattern of several Sciences depending on if it's a dress or whatever more so it may range from 4 to 12 or 6 to 12. so you have to pick out your size or the age you're living in Glory what's ours is size seven of course amen and then you lay that pattern upon the fabric now Carol's been doing it long enough for a lot of times she can just hold her hand or she'll tell me to put my hand on top of it she don't even pin it and she'll take the scissors and just cut right around now she might use the same pattern over and over again because she don't need to make a new pattern to make the same dress so the Lord God didn't need to make a new pattern to make the same church that he had in Acts 2. oh Wally all he had to do was drag out the Bill of Rights and bursts of people by the Holy Ghost opened their eyes and they would say my lord it's the same size it will do the same thing that acts the same way why Hebrews 13 8. so the Lord God laid out a pattern right and he gave the goods to the apostles and preacher said now sow it together for me of course Satan looked at that pattern it scared him to death he thought he had got rid of that one and only Jesus now it looks like it's a multiplied form they live like him they talk like him they died like him and they're raised from the dead like him [Applause] Satan thought I've got to do something I got it or something changes this is awful this is awful so what'd he do he started sending people in among them he tried to defeat him from was out and found out that didn't work so he started setting people in among them and set them down the prophet said that Nickelodeon Spirit started crying out we don't need any more of that shouting now tell you one thing we don't need none of that hand clapping stuff some rich folks got saved maybe some of the Nobles and the ups and ups and the outs and outs and whatever more they got saved and you imagine them coming in and said no no no no no I like that preacher protect music Lord have mercy I like that preacher if you've ever been to church in your life or you've seen so many people jumping and running and screaming in your life well maybe you need to change patterns and get in the original Acts 2 pattern you'll find that's the way they done it so in every age he's done exactly the same thing try to pull the people away from the promised word of that age then they will alter what the product looks like this little handkerchief right here Carol and I used to work at a sewing Factory years and years and years and years ago Carol worked in the sewing Department I worked in the shipping Department as far as I started preaching full-time I would watch them guys because the shipping Department was right next door to the guys the receiving department so they would receive these rolls of fabric they would come from all over the country and they would take them rolls and run them back and forth and back and forth and add tables as long as from here to the back of the church and that have a man on either side of them Rose and they'd take this machine probably got more automated now but they'd run back and forth and layer that fabric and sometimes them layers they had a knife that had a knife blade that long I'm not exaggerating and then they would take after that to run the right to run that's right according to the Mount of desert that they wanted to make and then they would take this gigantic pattern and they would put it together and lay it over then there would be guys in there with these knives and they would go through cutting through this this high and that goes through cutting all that out and they had they had done it for years and years and they would send these Goods to alden's and to spiegels and to uh you know Sears and all them sort of thing so what's amazing was you was the beginning of where it started then it went through a process and they take it down through the sowing people and then they'd take it to the inspecting people and then they take it to the other people then it would come back to me and I was right next door as a matter of fact I used the same shipping door as they received the goods in so the goods would come in off of a truck buy and there might be hundreds and hundreds of rolls of this Fabric and it would come in this great big shipping door and they would start the process run it all through gear all the way down to there all the way back over to here and come right out to my department and whenever I was finished with it it went out the same door it'd come in but it looked a lot different this time because now each piece had took on the identity of the pattern you see God don't want us just all rolled up in one big bundle of this church but God wants to roll us out all glory he wants to cut us he wants to shape us he wants to mold us and we'll come right back out that same door we come into but we will have our identity as a finished product question praise the Lord praise the Lord the brides bill you have a right today if you're sick to be healed you have a right if you don't have the Holy Ghost to be filled before you leave this place today if you're lost without God and he's dealing with your heart you have the right to come to pass but before you can come to pass you got to come to him come to him and he will help you come to pass praise be to God to as many as received him to them gave he The Authority right right the jurisdiction the position to become sons of God in other words to come to pass because what you do you come into the door of humanity all roll Goods there they are all of humanity lays out before the before the great almighty God but who places the pattern God does now depending on how them layers of fabric because there's no way in the world you're going to be able to get a roll of fabric big enough to make all that one run so they would overlap them layers of fabric and sometimes they'd overlap them six inches 12 inches until they would build it when the guys would lay the pattern out they just go down through and lay it out then whenever they would cut that out that piece of the pattern might overlapped on a scene so someone would have to go through and bundle them all up and then they would start the first line of sowing the sergers and they would start searching it but once they pulled in there and of course the more they sold the more money they make so they go very fast and they might reach in there and pick out one but it just so happened it was like this if it's not a continuation but it was a lap over so what would they do put it aside discard it the pattern fell on them they experienced the touch of the salt but they was not a continuation of the book of Acts as a matter of fact they despised all that emotion they didn't like all that worship and I'll tell you one thing you sure don't want to go to heaven then because they're going to be shouting and praising God and worshiping God and blessing God for eternity oh children who places the pattern God by his election Grace so he lays it now what they would do the designers of the pattern would lay that piece of paper so they could get the most out of the goods but at the very best they could do there would always be remnants I would see tons of remnants of fabric picked up by the garbage people because there was nothing you could make out of them they were so small you could never make nothing out of them isn't it awful that a human being comes to this world and they live their life and when it's all said and done what have they done a wasted life through in a scrap Heap Alma are we willing today to let the great designer lay his pattern on our life Lord movement shape me cut me well they're telling you man I gotta get cut you can never make a piece of good you can never make a dress or a jacket or a shirt or whatever until it's cut once it's cut it starts taking on an image a shape of the pattern let's bow our heads together is there anyone here today that maybe you've not you've not met the Lord in that way you've gone to church for a lot for years of your life maybe even a member but as far as saying that you know him and he lives in you and thinks out of you and all of that but you'd like to know in that way but you just raise your hand to him today God bless you God bless you amen thank you Father maybe there's others heavy that you've accepted him you believe him you're walking in his way in his word but you don't have that dunamis that power to help you to overcome and you struggle with so many things and you're not only struggle but they went over you sometimes we can't do this on our own friends it takes the power of him any of you here today you'd like to be remembered you need the holy ghost in your life the token God bless you yes Lord Jesus Hallelujah he's also wanting a refilling of the Holy Ghost while we're praying for him those of you that have raised your hand would you lay your hand on somebody standing there by you let us all for prayer one for the other heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ we believe what we've heard today we believe this is the answer of the pattern you're the one who made the church the way you wanted it man has messed it up man has changed it man has made systems an organization out of it it's pitiful what it's become but Lord God there's still an original Church in the Earth father you see the needs in our brother's body today physically Lord this pain that he's been dealing with Lord also he needs a refilling of the Holy Ghost I joined my faith with my brother and with his Saints Lord in the name of Jesus touch him now father you suffered stripes in your body so he could be healed now in obedience to my Bill of Rights I lay my hands on my brother in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God touch him right now may this pain leave him in the very cause of it father I pray for a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord every fiber of his being filled with the presence of God granted I pray father in the name of Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Father We Worship You Lord can we just raise our hands in the presence of the great king now make our petitions our desires known to him but don't just spend all this time now ask and ask and asking go ahead tell him what you need sure he wants you to but when you made your list known let's turn it around let's worship him and give him something back he woke up this morning he give you the breath that you breathed you all have breathed thousands of times since you've been here in this building today your hearts beat thousands of times every one of them heartbeats is a gift from God Hallelujah you've got hands most of you where you can raise them up in the presence of God why don't you do it right now just raise them hands up before the Lord Jesus that's one of your rights to worship it now you realize in many countries around the world they don't have the right to worship God but they still worship Him Anyway they still praise him anyway it's against the law but they do it why they honor the rights above the law of the land oh let's just worship him a little bit Let's Just Praise Him now let's water the seed that we've heard we know that Praises water so let's water the seed that we've received and heard today may the Lord God make it so real to our hearts Hallelujah all Praise Your Name Lord Jesus thank you
