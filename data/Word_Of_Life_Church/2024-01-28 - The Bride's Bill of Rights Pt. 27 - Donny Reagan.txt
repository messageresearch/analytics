it but we'll try it today my brother sent me this song A few months ago and I hadn't I hadn't tried it but I heard brother BR say something this morning that reminded me of it the song is carried to the table I if you've heard it or not but I'm glad that I have a desire to eat from this great banquet table of the end time message you know there's all kinds of churches we all passed coming this morning and we could have stopped there and went to church and done our social whatever of just going to church but I told Karen the other day we was talking about different churches and different opinions and different thoughts even message churches I told her I said there's one important thing I want from church and that is I want my tank filled up with rocket fuel not water or 80% gas and 20% water and corn starch or whatever they're putting in gasoline nowadays but I want Rocket Fuel that's what I want and I believe that here's where it's at hey brothers I'm sorry wounded and forsaken I was shattered by the Fall broken and forgotten feeling lost and all alone summoned by a king into the Master's courts lifted by Savior and cradled in his arms I was carried to the table seated where I don't belong carried to the [Music] table Swept Away by his [Music] love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm seated at the table of the Lord I was carried to the table the table of the Lord fighting thoughts of fear wondering why he called my name am I good good enough to share this cup this world has left me lame even in my weakness My Savior called my name and in his holy presence I'm Healed and [Music] unashamed and I was car me to the [Music] table seated where I don't [Music] belong I've been carried to the table oh Swept Away by his love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm seated at the table of the Lord I was carried to the table seated where I Dawn [Music] beong carry to the table Swept Away by his [Music] love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm seated at the table with my Lord Carri to the table the table of the Lord I was carried to the table [Music] this table of the [Music] [Applause] Lord Heavenly Father we we count it such an honor to be sitting at the table of the Lord that song of course been taken from the story of David a great king who heard about his friend Jonathan's son his maid had taken care of him had fallen with him and made him crippled and David heard that there was an heir of Jonathan left so he brings this crippled young man to dine at the king's table our mother fell with us left us all crippled and Afflicted but one day the master called and said come and eat with me come and set with me dine with me be my guest for the rest of your life we're so glad we accepted that invitation we've come once again father that we could feed at your table as it's customary for us to do whenever we eat at home or go to a restaurant and we will bow our heads and thank you for the food food that we're about to receive well that's what we're doing now we're bowing our heads thanking you for the spiritual food that we're going to receive today you know our needs that they are many but we know that our God is so powerful and so wonderful I pray you'd come and take charge of the service Lord help me to get out of the way help the people as well to be able to get out of the way as John brother John has already prayed for we know it takes them pulling as well to receive help us today Jesus we open our hearts to your word speak to us father as only you can do we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you we are truly blessed aren't we to be able to be children of God Feast at the table of the king let's turn to 1 John 2:5 today greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus certainly love you and appreciate you thank God for his Mercy to us I'd like to speak to you again today on the right to perfect love the right to perfect love 1 John 2 verse 5 who so keepeth his word and him verily is the the love of God perfected now it's not just everybody that says they believe it even those that would maybe scream and holler amen and all of that but the way John phrases it he says who so keepe us that is take it as your own guard it watch over it and keep it as a sacred trust who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we know not guess but know we that we are in him 1 John chter 4 verse 12 no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us his love is perfected in US verse 16 we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love I know I've shared this meaning of this word but let's look at it again if you don't mind today abide remain continue to remain not to depart to continue to be present not to become another or different so he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him may the Lord bless his word you may be seated now I realize this is totally impossible for any of us today to every never be able to attain to perfect love it's something beyond what we can reach none of us are born with the human capacity to be able to love in a perfect way most of our world most of our life is filled with imperfect things you have a flawed Pastor flawed deacons flawed musicians I preach to flawed sheep your wife is flawed your husband is flawed your children are flawed our leaders our government it's flawed every man of God that ever stood on the Earth was flawed there was only one that ever lived here that was perfect and he gave his perfect life that he might bring us to this aren't you glad but still when we look at it to think that we are called to be able to love in a way that only God could love and I know that most of us probably struggle in some Avenues of our life when it would come to love now we know that there are gifts and thank God for gifts of the Spirit and thank God for talents and anointing and all of that and we know we must have that the Lord Jesus put that in his body but one day there will be no more preaching there'll be no preaching in heaven there'll be no speaking in tongues or interpretation uh somebody trying to find the word of the Lord for somebody there won't be any of that but what will there be in heaven we will come back to this perfect love it will never die you see the Antichrist can be able to reproduce and mimic any gift that God has but the devil cannot love it's not any is just not capable of loving and yet God demands of us as his people that we have a perfect love now we've done looked at the meaning of this words and know that perfect is tellos which means complete mature or grown up it's not talking about Flawless but it's talking about a mature love a Divine love that's what it is now if you could understand it in this way when the Lord came to the Earth that he came as the very fountain of love and he come to make us that we unlovable he come to make us lovable so in the state that we were in we were not very lovable and we all can be honest I'm sure and say that there's certain people that we have an easier time loving is there anybody that'll be honest and shake your head at least and say yeah that that's right there are certain people that I can love easier than other others and yet you're real love is not proven by loving those people actually the greatest test of your true love is loving those that aren't as lovable now what makes it very difficult is sometimes we might have family members that aren't as lovable as other people are and some family members will be more lovable than others some preachers are more lovable than others some people are more lovable I'm talking about the human element now but the love of God has the capability of loving those that are unlovable let me share a few of these things with you this morning God is a lover God is love and God so loved the world that when we were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable so God so loved the world now whenever the Bible tells us that it was Jesus of course speaking it then he was speaking it from the first person knowing that the world wasn't lovable and the truth of it is the majority of the world still isn't lovable today they're so wrapped up in their self and their sin and what they want to do and God cannot love sin God Can Love The Sinner is that right but God cannot love sin and God does not love our sin either as Christians God does not love sin but he does Love The Sinner and he has the ability to separate that sometimes we struggle with that so if people do things that we don't like and they're not lovable maybe in Avenues of their life we tend to cast them in the same tub as it were of their sin and say well I just don't like them and I don't love them well we need to be more like God to where that we can be able to separate them from what they're doing and eventually of course the love of God becomes mature in our lives and it'll produce a group of people over the face of the Earth and they'll be Rapture Ready Now notice the prophet goes on to say here it is God wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get to some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's all love God so love the Lord don't want to to serve him out of fear what man that's it's married here in this building today would want his wife to constantly have to be told tell me that you love me tell me that you love me what woman here would want her husband or what which of you parents would constantly want have to ask your children children do you love me do you care for me children what Pastor would want that what sheep would want that from their Pastor they want to hear it from me you want to hear it from me right that I love you I want to hear it from you that you love me my wife wants to hear it from me I want to hear it from her God wants to hear it from us God doesn't want the song leader to have to get up or the preacher and Pull and beg and and do everything just to get a little praise out of us or a little bit of worship there's something wrong with us when that has to be done it ought to be Auto atic that we love him so much that we're looking for an opportunity to be able to praise him and raise our hands and and adore him why because it's a love affair that's what he wants I found that many people have fallen in love with the message and many of them actually fell in love with brother brandham but I'll tell you I'm wondering how many of them fell in love with the Lord Jesus they really get excited about talking about doctrines in the message and they get so excited talking about this and that and the other I I've seen them get very exited talking about their certain favorite preacher but then you go to mention the Lord Jesus and they just kind of sit there and look at you you know the Lord Jesus so who's he it just so happens to be the creator of all this I think he ought to still excit us don't you because he took us when we were unlovable and transformed us and made us to where that we were lovable then after he did that he could not have a love relationship with us until we were transformed and made lovable now that we are made lovable he wants to have this spiritual relationship with us to where that he comes down not just twice a week three times a week when we're in church but every day of our life when you're driving down the road when you're taking your kids to school when you're coming back from school if you're at the grocery store he wants to have a love relationship with you so much that he can bring tears to your eyes and he can bring a song to your heart and just something about you to where that you have that that ultimate time with you and the Lord Jesus now he said to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love again in the law having the shadow he says it's the spirit of Jesus Christ that makes me love the unlovable Now watch how brother Brandon describes about himself before this love came in him it makes me do things that I thought I never would do it makes me do things that I thought I never would do now you know what if it hasn't affected you the same way you need more of it today now how many wants a Revival how many wants a Revival in your heart in our church and you know we wish that we could say so on in the our nation we know that'll never be but I believe that we can have a Revival as an individual and also as our church whether or not our whole nation does the nation's finished as far as that but listen how he describes one of the greatest hindrances that keeps us from revival one of the greatest hindrance in the church today keeps a Revival back is the lack of that Godly love that Christ expressed when he was here on the earth now sure we could all pray more and we might could assemble more often and there's many things that we could do but why in the world would he choose love because what is a Revival a Revival is not adding more members to our church a Revival is just not how much we can jump and shout and surely we will do that but Revival is clean the trash out of us getting closer to God is that right and and falling more in love with him and this is the thing I found in my walk with the Lord that I cannot fall in love with him more without falling in love with his people more and wanting to be of Greater service I've live the majority of my life serving God's people started preaching when I was an 18-year-old boy and I have no regrets Oh Brother Don you gave your teens you gave your 20s your 30s your 40s your 50s the majority of my 60s to the service of God do you regret it only thing I regret is I wish I'd have done a better job and I wish I had more life you feel the same way so I found though that whenever I fall more in love with him that somehow it intensifies the love that I have for his people and I want to do what I can to help them even if they're not bride if I can help them just make life a little bit easier for a foolish virgin because the Lord Jesus don't just love the bride he loves the foolish virgin too he actually loves the lost and it's not his will that any should perish to me the more we fall in love with him the more we fall in love with the human race itself is that right now what's what he says here one of the greatest hindrance to the church today that keeps a Revival back is the lack of that Godly love that Christ expressed when he was on the earth it's easy for you and I to love somebody that loves us but Jesus didn't have that kind of love so the way we love Jesus didn't have that kind of love because our best friends and our best buddies and all of that are those naturally that agree with us now you don't have to say amen for the next few minutes if you don't want to it might help me a little bit if you did but we all can relate so much better to those that we really like and our our best friends and our best Pals and all that's the ones we just want to spend so much time with and tend to avoid the others and and arnest lovable but listen what he said Jesus didn't have that kind of love he had God's love and God loved his enemies for God so loved the world when the world was unlovable God still loved the world now if we're not careful we find that same way in among our our religious ranks that we tend to agree with folks and love them more that even doctrinally agree with us closer and that will be the ones that we tend to love the most but is that really the kind of love that Jesus had in reality there was no one in his stay upon the Earth the years that he was here even understood his Doctrine even the apostles they were so far away from him doctrinally they couldn't even understand the common simple terms I'm sure glad he didn't stop loving them because they didn't agree with him doctrinally now understand that we tend to Gra itate more toward those that believe like we do but is that real love when we do it that way now see already I'm going have to preach an amen myself too this morning now once again he says if you can just love those that love you why the Sinners do the same thing but we're different when Christ has come into our heart we love those those who do not love us how many can say you do that with all your heart sir how many can say you want to do that with all your heart amen me too now when Christ has come into our heart we love those who do not love us love the unlovable and we listen we were Len n the unlovable one time too and you know Christ loved us until we came to him now whenever it would come then to say doctrines and in between churches and doctrines and things in the message and Doctrine we must have a Doctrine to be a church churches that don't have doctrines don't even meet the requirement of being a church but how do we treat people them whenever we would find out say this church and this brother and that sister they don't exactly agree with us doctrinally how are we going to treat them are we going to treat them less favorably are we going to love them as much as we did before we found out they disagree with us in Doctrine are are we going to love them in spite of that and if we have more understanding than they do we're going to pray for them that God will help them to see what we see now you know this one thing I love about the message of the hour that it's not just quotes but our Prophet showed us how to live this message as well and really the message don't do us a whole lot of good if it's all up here and it don't come down here and help us to live a life that is like Jesus Christ right the devil is not scared of the of the the word as long as it lays in the written format in the Bible it's been laying there for years and years and years you could take your Bible lay it on that organ lay it on that lesle lay it on this pull pit lay it on that handrail come back a thousand years from today that handrail will not be changed one bit neither will this neither will the piano but we could ever get that word off of them pages into our hearts and let it Quicken our hearts it will change us day after day after day now let me give you just a little bit of an example here this morning of how the prophet that whenever he come now he knew that he was a restoration prophet and he knew that he was pointing the people back to the original Apostolic message so the mindset of the way the message is going to be brought is going to affect back future generations of how they perceive the message so it's important to him that he not only brings the doctrine and the restoration of the original Apostolic teachings but that he also shows us how do we deal with issues whenever we would have problems say in our church or how would we deal with issues when we have them in our home or how would we deal with them whenever we would have a difference of opinion among preachers now if you've got at least two preachers I can almost guarantee you you're going to have two opinions about just about anything you're going to talk about because every one of us have a different opinion and it's why we need an absolute and our absolute cannot just be you know well I believe and I think and I feel there must be something more than that and God gave us his word then God sent his his messengers of course and they would come and reflect that absolute light of the hour and it would give give us a direction in the way that we need to go and everybody said now remember we're talking about the right to perfect love I don't love I don't want to love the way everybody else out here loves I do not want to love the way the majority of Christians love I want to love in the Avenue of completion maturity fullness so if I go by the way of the grave and my heart is beating its Li beats and my breath is fixing to leave my body that I will know I am ready to meet the Lord Jesus I don't want to preach to you and wind up being lost myself I don't want to be able to quote the scripture and quote the message and wind up standing before God and him say to me depart from me you work of iniquity I never even knew you now I'm not going to be able to achieve that just by having signs and wonders and miracles and I've told you before I've had them all of my Ministry I started seeing miracles in my Ministry when I was a teen age preacher boy and they've continued to be there all of my life but I also know the Antichrist can produce the same signs we can but that same Prophet that I just quoted that to you said but the Antichrist cannot love so casting out Devils this that the other sure that that can be done but we want more than that is that right now watch's this brother brandham in his church and there was several Cycles in the Church of the brandham Tabernacle how that they went through in the gifts moving in the church there and uh in the early 50s they had it to where that they would Gather in a room and they would meet and then they would write down tongues interpretation and prophecy and all that and they write it out L on the platform and then someone would read it and then they come through another cycle in the Church of the brandham Tabernacle that brother branam had them up on the floor and allowed them to be on the floor and then he said to heavly said now just let it go for a while we can't judge it let it go for a while so they did and then whenever they set the cycle that it was to be in the way that he felt like it should be in church order 12 26263 then whenever he did some of the people pulled away from Brother brandom's church and they left his church and they went to Junior Jackson's Church JT Parnell Don R and some of those other brothers that were now I wonder the attitude that we would have had as Word of Life Church if we would have been a sister Church in that day and we would have heard about what happened that brother random did this and this is the way he felt like that it should be done and then some of those people pulled away and left and they went to some of the other churches I wonder what our attitude would have been well let me read to you what some of the attitude of the people in brand Tabernacle how they were thinking about some of these other people and the names that they were calling them now watch this question answer 64 now also here I might bring this out I don't think my brother's here tonight but somebody made fun of somebody leaving the Tabernacle and went down to brother Junior Jackson's for church and they said they went down amongst the dead birds aren't you ashamed to make a Mark AR that come on now now wait a minute God's Prophet set that church in order the way he felt like it should be done and these people pulled away from that and so these people there were in defense of it and they said they're dead birds my they don't believe what brother R taught they're dead birds wow Welly if some of y'all know us going this way this morning You' prayed more wouldn't you before he come to church now I want you to notice how brother brandham reacts to this this reaction is very important if he reacts the wrong way he will influence thousands of preachers around the world he will affect thousands of lay people around the world for decades watch his reaction aren't you ashamed to make a remark like that ever who you are if you're my kid here in Christ I'm ashamed of you wow now doctrinally they were right but in their spirit and in their attitude yeah they were wrong now the people in my view that left and pulled away they were an error but you cannot correct an error in Doctrine by having an error in attitude so in order to correct error you've not only got to have the truths you've got to also have the right attitude now see what was missing with these people they had the truth and they could to say didn't you hear God Prophet say he told us if there's any question here let this tape be played and this is the bishop or the overseer he said and if there's any question let him come back to this tape they had the quotes and they had the word concerning because he said he was doing it exactly the way that Paul did it in the first church now it did amazing here that the message is in this stage in 1964 and already doctrines and and difference of opinions in the message churches are starting to raise up and there's a little bit of Separation now watch watch so instead of brother brandham joining on the bandwagon bandwagon of blasting Junior Jackson and those that left it would seem as if though he actually took sides with them and spanked his own youngans wow I mean he just flat wears them out why he picks up something about this attitude which is not Christlike amen you see what I'm saying friend we we want to be right doctrinally do we not how many wants to be right doctr sure we want to be right doctrin when it comes to election predestination all these wonderful things of God but I also want to be right if someone would disagree with me or you or with our church to where that we would be able to have not only the quotes of the message but the spirit the messenger had now let me just be honest with you it's easier for you to have one of his books or one of his tapes than it is for you to have the same Holy Ghost to him oh it's much easier to pick up a book oh I believe every word of it Hallelujah I believe every word of it well do you believe this word right here I just read to you this morning now you see God is dealing with this man and he slang the foundation he's only got about a year and a half left on the earth and it's so important that not only do we have the doctrines of the message but we have the spirit of the message and Paul told Timothy he said there is none other in the gospel that is as likeminded with me as you are and that word likeminded is of the Same Soul of the Same Soul so Timothy not only said what Paul Paul said but he looked at at Paul to see how how did he deal with confrontation how did he deal with when people would differ with him what kind of spirit did the man have and then Paul would give him what a compliment now there were all kinds of other preachers in that first century and yet Paul said about Timothy there's not a one of them that has the same soul that I have like you do so to me you look at that and you saying it must have been more than just quoting the doctrine and quoting the passages of scripture but there was something more about it he didn't say it was of the same Doctrine but of the Same Soul what is the soul nature of the spirit so in him he saw something about Paul and he would see maybe after he was beaten and after he was treated terribly and even the church the church at galatia had one time received him as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus then they begin to listen to some false teachers and they turned turned away from Paul the very man that led them to Christ and no doubt he watched him how does he deal with that opposition how did he how does he deal with people when they turn him down won't have a thing to do with him so what does he do does he just keep the same attitude bless God if you want to do me that way go on to hell you old serpent seed anyhow or does he keep on reaching out to him and loving them and really expressing Christ in another format I know I know I know I know I know I don't the great move right now the main thing is signs wonders and you know all of that but myself I desire to express the Lord Jesus and maybe attributes that aren't as loved as other people I want to be able to Love Like Jesus loved I want to be able to forgive like Jesus forgave I want to be able to love my enemies and pray for I want to be able to even love my friends and they don't seem to love me very much and I I want to be able to not hold a grudge against anybody in my heart come on somebody preach with me this morning I don't want to think of a sinner or anyone else in this world that I want them to be lost and if you think that way about somebody you need to hit this older whenever I make an aler call today I want to be able to be so much like him not only will I cast out devils and by his grace I do not only do I lay hands on cross eyes and them straightened out by his grace I have and we'll continue to do so and Cancers be healed and so on and so on if that's all I do then people in Matthew 24:24 can do the same thing but I want to forgive like Jesus I Want to Love Like Jesus I want to have so much mercy and compassion I ain't talking about compromising with sin I'm talking about being able to experience a love which cannot be impersonated by the devil amen now watch brother brandham he has the opportunity now if he wishes he's already mentioned Junior Jackson's name Don rutle JT Parnell all it takes is a couple of words brother Brenham ruin them yeah ruin them now is your opportunity ruin them but notice the way he handles it ever who you are if you're my kid in Christ I'm ashamed of you do a thing like that Junior Jackson is my brother Don rutle is my brother well the reason of it he said because I set the church here in a certain order come back to see if I could get the manifestation of the gifts half of them pulled away from it because when you start to speak or preach or something it was getting to such a place you could hardly preach L there was somebody spoken tongues somebody interpreting somebody giv the interpretation and half of it never even come to pass wow I thought it never even come to pass but now it's a pastor he let it go until it felt like it could be judged he said they were kids now it's come time to be judged in December of 63 now whenever he did it upset some of them now he said I believe in speaking in tongues and I believe in interpretation but it must be something directly to the church or something which is he said the Lord is coming soon which is all right don't use vain repution Jesus said so as the heathens do it must be something go tell brother so and so a certain thing he done to get this right why go tell brother sister so and so you done a certain thing down there the other day you transgressed the law of your husband the vow to your husband unless she makes that right the holy spirit will cut her off there you've got thus saith the Lord then bring that sin in that's when you got a church like ananas and Safara that's the gifts I want at our church I'm not looking for a repeat of what I saw in Pentecost how many of you all saw them types of gift in Pentecost now any of you that have raised your hands do you want to repeat no no sir why cuz it wasn't right was it hit Miss hit miss the Lord's coming I say the Lord's coming I'm here what is it repeating scripture which God's Prophet said that's not what it is so whenever the prophet said it in order then look what they done now he said then whenever we got a church like that ananas and Safar will return and remember it will come back we know that he says then we got a church that stands solid I believe the tongues and people that's got them gifts if they're real genuine Christians and interested in it they'll meet themselves together because give the tongues an interpretation see what they can do to further the kingdom of God they've got a Ministry on their own but it don't belong here in the middle of the audience where the Sinners are being dealt with and so forth but of course some of those other people didn't believe that they didn't go along with it so whenever brother Rand said it in order they said I'm leaving he ain't preaching what I believe oh my on now can you imagine anybody walking away from the prophet of God's church I can really because they walk away from his teaching in our church or whoever else Church it is because it's his body don't make no difference either you believe what he said or you don't believe what he said just the bottom line but now notice now his reaction and he said they say you're unlearned and sometimes they got so irreverent with it not our gang huh what a word to call them now our gang hadn't but I let him go ahead for a while and I said watch it now I told the Brethren there's Witnesses here that know this I said let it alone and we'll find out whether it's God or not if it cannot stand chastisement then it's a bastard child exactly what the Bible said so when the chastisement come what happened I want you to notice now the way that he's dealing with this he's not compromising and say well you know really I I probably shouldn't have said that I I I didn't know I was going to make people mad and I I I really shouldn't have said that and I'm so sorry so I'm going to retract what I said so all of those of of you that left us yall just come back and and I'm I'm I'm sorry I apologize no you're talking about Elijah I said you're talking about Elijah so he's still standing firm on what he believes but Harry has a different attitude right you see there's such a delicate balance in us being able to stand firm unmovable absolutely unmovable and not being mean about it and not being harsh and not being grouchy and hateful oh my Lord praise God now you told me you wanted love do we are not well see here is Love on display in a way when people are totally disagreeing with you myama now watch he said did not I tell that tell you that long ago he's speaking to brother brother Neville asked to Pastor here he said what about this and that I said let it alone they're babies we can't judge it but watch when it really comes to pin it down to the word now brother Jor Jackson had a right to disagree with that now I have a right to disagree with it too but I forfeit my right because I trust him more than I trust myself and to be honest I trust him more than I trust any of you praise the Lord now notice his attitude see through the whole thing now remember he can ruin these guys if he would have said a few words that would have seemed to chross in negative way who would have had any confidence in them oh my junior Jackson had a right to disagree with that he wants his church the people all want to speak with tongues and things in the audience that's brother Junior's a not brother Junior's blessings not brother Junior's great manifestations from god notice he's not compromising now what he believes he's Iden ifying what this will do it will bring troubles troubles and more troubles but if that's what brother Junior Jackson wants he said then people speaking in tongues and things in the audience that brother Junior Jackson's Troubles that's up to him but now how many of us could say this next line let's say what he said Junior Jackson believes this message the same as any of the rest of us does sir now why did some of y'all just pull your toes up in your shoe like that whenever I read that don't you see we need help because what do we want to do cut people off bless God they don't believe what the prophet of God said it's just plain and simple we not going to no Rapture and when did God give you the glasses to go to looking down in people's soul and tell who's bride and who ain't praise the Lord now I wonder what some of you had done if you've been going to the brandham tabernacle during these several span of years that brother brandham was allowing these babies to operate their gifts one mistake after another after another wonder if you don't want to brother Brandon said brother Brandon when you going to set them people down when you going to set this thing down when you going to do this that and other and he when brother Neville even come to him asking of course for advice and counsel what did the prophet tell him leave it alone they're babies oh my goodness so what if when you started talking as a child and [Music] you and your mama said shut that up until you can speak eloquent English don't open your mouth again on now sir so we had to learn didn't we I don't know about you I'm still learning to speak good English myself but we spit and we slobbered and you know Mama and Daddy's vying over which one you going to say first mama or daddy of course and then then it'll be you know Papa or Noo-noo or whatever it is oh said M first s man first Hallelujah so the prophet gave him that time so if you would have been in the message and you would have been going to that church and you would have said Lord have mercy this is what they' done at the Pentecostal church I come out of I can't believe brother R was letting this go on I'm leaving I'm out of here love love love but when you going to preach on something else when we get this when we get this let's let's get this and then we can move on into the gifts perfect love the prophet said will produce perfect gifts maybe we should preach that first amen maybe we should get that baptism of Love first then we'll really know what gifts are supposed to do they're not to gratify us they're for Ed edification of the body now watch as he goes on and he said Junior Jackson believes this message the same as in the rest of us as it's not a dead bird to go there Junior Jackson is a man of God that I love was all of my heart W but brother randam he didn't he didn't set his church up well you do yours and it amazing that brother Bram didn't say up till about a few months ago and then after a few months ago I'm sorry I cannot love him with all of our heart but he still loved him with all of his heart and what's amazing is he goes on for another year and a half or so he's still there in the meetings he's still a part of the move of of the message of the hour brother R was still referring to him still talking about him he don't shun him he don't slide him why our messenger had what he preached amen I think it's time that we as his followers supposedly get what we've been talking about for decades more of the love of God in our hearts what Good's it going to do for us to talk about the Rapture what Good's it going to do for us to sing songs about it and sing about going to heaven and miss the very Avenue of divine love love that'll put us in there can I have a few more minutes of your time notice this he refers to it in perfect love and he also calls it Divine love now he said what the church is lacking is divine love I don't mean affectionate love for one another I mean the agapo Love The Godly love and have it so richly in your heart until you just love the Lord and what's the connection and everything and you take his word for it and you don't mistrust it you see it's always Pro evident that I've seen it through the years whenever people don't have the right trust for God and whenever things will happen to them that they don't understand and they go to questioning God's wisdom and God's choice and this and that and I've always noticed that excuse me there tends to be a lack of love because love produces more Trust the more you love him the more you can trust him but if you don't love him right then when he does something that you do not understand then you well how how come you do that why did you do that I don't understand why you do that but if you love him and love him and love him and even if he breaks your heart you trust him because you love him now we said we love thee with unchangeable love 25 years ago you place that Divine love in my heart for the Lord Jesus and it grows sweeter every day I'm so happy notice now how he relates this about love that we grow in the Lord till we become in the full stature the measure or the stature of Christ did we get it all once we got the Holy Ghost we did not I don't know about you I'm still growing today in knowledge and understanding hopefully in wisdom and all of that but I don't want to stop growing in love I want to be able to grow in love more and more and more if going beyond the curtain of time changed the prophet's life forever and he said everything that you ever preached this is what it was the Holy Ghost This is Love and thus sayith the Lord lay aside everything until you get Divine love perfect love and the church said you say I love him come on down but can you trust him when the doctor shakes his head can you trust him when everything has gone wrong you need an overflowing baptism of love divine love but is it amazing though when we think about baptism we think about more emotional ecstatic joy and all that oh I I I think probably the majority of our people sitting here today need another baptism of love and what you'll find is you'll finds yourself falling in love with your wife and your husband and your kids maybe even your pastor too maybe even the deacons maybe even somebody that crosses you a little bit or your boss on the job tomorrow and you walk in there after that baptism of love and you think man that guy is so grouchy but you'll walk in there feeling different toward him in your heart and then you realize it wasn't just him that needed help it was actually you oh my everybody hang with me now or heading for some turbulence if I had every gift in the Bible and could exchange it yes sir for love I'd never wink an eye I'd take it right now and remember he's not doing away with gifts but he showing us the value Prophet Paul said that whenever people speak in tongues that's a wonderful thing but he said actually it's greater if they prophesy so even among the gifts there are some that are greater than others and this is actually greater than any of them I find it so amazing though in our days especially in the ranks of the message that the gifts that are being so emphasized there's really only three tongues interpretation and prophecy so when the prophet is talking about gifts and the quotes does that include the other six come on on Amen don't raise your hand but I wonder how many of you can name all nine today I wonder how many of our preachers can name all nine or did they just focus on three oh I'm I'm sorry I must have said something wrong makes you wonder don't it so you see God has an order a way what if he could fill every individual here in our church with such love of God and we wonder what's God waiting on what's God waiting on oh we're looking for a great hour we're looking for the missing limbs to be restored we're looking for ananas and saf fire wonder what what's God waiting on and if we're not careful we're going to get in the big tizzy and we're going to try to work up something with the music or work up something with this or that and we're going to run right ahead of the whole program of God with an armload of substitutes that's all right cuz we didn't get love first I ain't talking about just the degree of love we have now I'm talking about Divine love with such a degree someone could take a gun out and stick it to your head and you would pray for them they could lie on you on face book they could run you down and instead of your flesh picking up your keyboard uhhuh I'll get you back I'll tell this I'll tell that you get down on your knees and pray God forgive them you talking about having some gifts praise the Lord amen notice now he goes on to say Let Me Feel the blessings of the Lord Jesus and his Divine love in my heart that's shed abroad by the Holy Ghost and I'll exchange any gift in the Bible for that wow oh you say I've spoken tongues I don't have nothing to do with it I've shouted still don't have nothing to do with it Paul said I could speak in tongues like men and angels and still be lost I could have faith to move mountains still be lost that ain't it if the Divine love of God isn't in your heart to take everything of the world out you're lost and the devil is only deceiving you that's just one of the things that I saw whenever I was in Pentecost as a Pentecostal preacher that people could speak in tongues and prophesy remember brother Brand's introduction the first time he saw the gifts in operation Muke Indiana and there was two main men he said boy if I can get around them I was just a hunger and he said to be around them and one of them would speak in tongues and the other and interpret he said everything that I knew it just testified to the spirit that I had and he said I got around them and he said pulled over into that little gear he said them gifts and calling of God without repentance and he said that one man was a genuine Christian that other one was married to what was it a blackhead woman and had a had a child by a blond-headed woman am both of them the same spirit of God and that's what we want back let's get so full of his love that not a day goes by that we don't pray for the Lost for a family there's probably not a person in here tonight that don't have a friend a family that's lost do we call their name every day we've got children we' got grandchildren without the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're more concerned about Facebook we're more concerned about this and that and the other than we our lost friends we're in the end time I know you've heard this for years and years we're at the end time at any moment our lord Jesus could come and if he come where would your children be lost on where would some of our message kids sitting in church and some of them you know oh they come to church and they sing and do this and that and they don't have the Holy Ghost you don't go without it young people it's not enough to say well I'm the use of a Word of Life I'm the use of evening light you've got to be a holy ghost filled Christian but my mama is a good person that's not what will put you in you've got to have the [Applause] token oh my again he said where there's tongues they shall cease where there's prophecies they'll fail the Antichrist can produce any sign that's in the Bible but he cannot love there's nothing about him to love agapo love is divine love and when Divine love is in your heart there's a difference in your life and everybody knows it that's right you live like a Christian act like a Christian walk like a Christian your whole system I love this quote your whole system is timed to God's Bible yes your whole system is timed and of course that includes the gifts that includes healing that includes Miracles that also includes turn the other cheek that also includes pray for them that despitefully use you that all always includes us stopping gossiping on tail bearing well preach it brother Donnie oh my let me after this morning the holy spirit so beautifully coming down and bathing us listen what a statement the holy spirit so beautifully coming down and bathing Us in his great Beauty so we were unlovable and he made us lovable and we were ugly and marred and all of that and in church in his presence he comes down and bathes Us in his Beauty so we take on his love we take on his nature and our old ugliness our old rough ways and whatever more he bathes Us in Beauty and calms us and and and does away with our carnality and all of that and whenever we leave and we walk out we're washed and bathed in the beauty of his Holiness so tell me sisters how much would you pay for a gallon of water that can make you beautiful some of you that feel like you're ugly some of you men that's as ugly as I am God bless you Brothers I hate to say it but you are what would we pay for a quart of water guaranteed that you wash your face in it and you're transform you've got this Grecian profile you've got these dazzling eyes forget it and yet we can be bathed in the beauty of his Holiness amen and we ain't even got time to stay around after the preacher's done my goodness some of y'all can't even sit still five minutes after I say let's stand you're gone where y'all going in such a hurry yes sir that's when we want to worship he said now it's time to be bathed down in the presence of God and worship now listen what he says after they were bathed in this beauty of God's righteousness I was just inspired to speak them words and say some glorious day all the gifts that's in the church will be set aside on the mantle as it was the Holy Spirit himself will just take the church search in such control of divine love now I want you to notice now once the Holy Spirit does that it ain't that there ain't no more healing and there ain't no more miracles and there ain't no more Supernatural listen what is going to happen the holy spirit will just take the church in such a control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk without hands being laid on them it'll just be one great Unity Miracles ain't going to stop the more love we get signs ain't going to stop the more love we get but it'll transfer from man getting the glory to God getting all the glory I tell all if that what we want I don't deserve no glory no other preacher deserves Glory he's the one that deserves it mist let me read this and as you stand to your feet oh if the Pentecostal Church would only satisfy thirst in God instead of trying to follow some evangelist or some emotion or some little ISM or little sensation how much better El it be you'd follow the holy spirit in Divine love instead of Sensations and little gifts and things like that how much better off you'd be God don't want you to run after gifts God wants you to thirst after him well you know what get the giver you get all of his gifts in the package and if you're a real believer you want them I mentioned to you the other night I think it maybe to the youth I've been around so-called gifts most of my life I'm not sure how many I've ever seen really that were really real a few I've heard a few manifestations and it would line up but it would be hit Miss hit Miss right B Jim right some of you that saw it why would I ever want to go back to that so in Carol and I was in a tent meeting one night and a preacher calls her out and tells her sister you're called to preach I agree with him because she had two people in her congregation Lish and Erica sometimes they didn't either one them listen but she preach anyhow yeah can you imagine a preacher standing up supposedly under the holy ghost telling a woman she's called to preach that's contrary to God's word but you see when you have nothing to judge it by nothing to measure it up it's just free course then in comes one demon after another after another I would love it if the spirit of God would fall Among Us with genuine gifts and somebody come in here and sat down and their life wasn't right with God and we say it this way after the gifts were matured tongues interpreters and so on would meet in a room provided and they would write down on a letter or a note give it to Brother Louie or to me and I'd come out and say the gifted people met prior to service thus saith the Lord yeah tell brother so and so he did this against his wife if he don't make it right within three days he'll die I guarantee you one thing if that moved in Among Us we'd be a better Church come on somebody people are scared to death to get around a man that they think's got discernment that shows me there's something wrong with their life don't you understand when brother Bram said discernment absolutely wore him out he said but God has given me some help at the Tabernacle you know what that help was tongues and interpretation that's what he said I'm not adding that that's what he said tongues and interpretation why because tongues and interpretation rightly done is prophecy right you imagine God giving brother brandham this help what was it it was the spirit of God Discerning isn't one wasn't I'm the Lord I'm here and I'm here to help and I'm here to bless and I'm here to do this that's not what it was it was you need to fix this in your life you need to take care of this I saw you day before yesterday on your face crying and praying before God and you said this and this and this and God's going to answer your petition if it don't come to pass it's false wow I guarantee one thing when we started come to church y'all might not stand up turn and talk as much for church you might be in here oh Jesus if there's anything in my life take it out Lord Lord forgive me for what I said oh God forgive me man you talking about having some meetings woo we' have some meetings around you wouldn't we let's pray together Lord Jesus I stand before you today knowing that I will give an account of this sermon one day so I don't want to approach you Lord as The Shepherd of the sheep first as the leader of the flock I want to approach you first as an individual me standing before you alone by myself first in prayer and I tell you today sir I need more I want more I must have more of your life love help me Jesus help me to love more like you help me to forgive I read it to him a few weeks ago where the Roman historians and those of capedan and the different ones took note of it and wrote it in their historical writings they were not even Christians but it was over and over again how they talked about the Christians and how they loved and one of them says their Master tells them they are brothers and of course they believed him and I found it so amazing when I was studying on that from a historical standpoint that the historians wasn't writing about them just casting out devils and Healing The Sick and and raising the dead they heard about that but it wasn't that so much that made the historical record as it was how they loved one another and how they loved you and they loved you so much they were willing to go to the Coliseum sisters would have their bab their bellies ripped open and their babies jerked out and its little brains dashed against a stone wall because they loved you brothers would give their lives sisters would give their lives for you and your cause because of Love help us Lord Jesus oh Father God I'm asking you now not just for me but for these people I know we have some visors here in our gates today but I pray Lord Lord that should help each of us and those that will stream the service and archive it later may we search our hearts Lord God I know that it's beyond me I I can't love this way I just have to be honest with you I can't do it and I'll be honest for them they can't either we can only love this way if you baptize Us in such a baptism of life love then Lord if we can get that kind of love and that will be our foundation then if you choose to let gifts come among us then there won't have to be worry about no selfishness involved in them gifts if they would just read 1 Corinthians 13 the way Paul's setting it in order about tongues interpretation prophecy the whole thing if they would read it with the right mind mindset even chapter 11 and 12 leading up to 13 they would realize he's trying to stri strike down the selfishness that is in the Corinthian Church so they were measuring everybody's experience by their own well you got to speak in tongues cuz I did you got to shout cuz I did you got to do this Paul said does all speak in tongues do all prophesy so they're taking their spiritual gifts and using it as an element of arrogance and measuring other people in their own church by them you don't scream the way I do you don't shout the way I do so you're not as close to God as I am Paul was trying to help them receive spiritual gifts are for the edification of the body that's why I told a person that would speak in tongues if there's no interpreter they are to keep silent in the church because speaking in tongues is edifying themsel but it just just so happens they're not the only one in church today this is the whole picture oh Jesus may you Circle The Globe father with the refilling of the Holy Ghost dear God I I really get concerned about where we are I know sometimes sheep don't know it and they don't understand it but our message has been on a brink of silver war many times and we're on the brink of another help us Jesus help every preacher Lord not to use their influence to incite a war against their own Brothers your Prophet could have started a civil war right there in Indiana but instead said he took the higher Road I thank you for this question answers Lord I Thank you for a man of God before us that we can follow his example praise God make me more like you Jesus how many here today would just raise your hands and say Lord I want to be more like you would you be honest and say I need more love I need more of love for the Lord Jesus love for my brothers and sisters more tolerance for their mistakes more tolerance for people that I may think don't exactly go along with what brother Brenham said come on somebody what will it make us do it'll make us pray for him instead of judging them nobody pointed us as the judge anyway it'll make us pray for him and try to reach out to him and maybe understand what caused them to lean that way praise God would you do me a favor now of course there's so many of you here today there's no way I can go amongst you but would you take your hand and just let over on the brother sister standing by you and we're not going to pray for gifts now I'm not against that Paul told us to earnestly desire the best gifts but he said rather to prophesy but the prophet told us don't seek gifts you can understand when you take this terminology it's for selfish means seeking it like you would weals seeking it like you would position we just simply open ourself he said the gift of Prophecy might fall up on a person today and never fall on them again speaking in Tong Tong interpretation of tongues may fall on a person and it may never hit them in their life but if you can get Divine love it'll be yours forever don't you see what divine love is friends it's a little bit of foretaste of what we're fixing to enter into in heaven there won't be nobody speaking in tongues in heaven interpreting all that those gifts are given to us in time for correction but perfect love is the world we will live live in Forever Lord Jesus as we have our hands laid upon another Lord I remember reading in the Bible where the apostles were filled with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and then after they went go through a great trial and a great hardship the Bible says they were gathered together again and the spirit of God came again and fill them so they had already been baptized in the Holy Ghost and their soul sealed but they needed another refilling apparently Lord and it wasn't that long after the initial one Lord God I need one today Jesus Lord God would your spirit be able to come among us today Father I'm not asking you for gifts and if you want me to have any of that go ahead that's that's fine but my desire baptize Me In Love Lord Lord Jesus may I be dipped immersed today in a baptism of love that when I come up out of there I will love like I have never loved before Oh father it's not this Leo to see and stuff I'm talking about of compromising and this and that I'm talking about holding a standard we see an example today of our Prophet how we stood his ground and stood what he felt like was right but he also showed us how to treat people that do not agree with what we stand for all we can stand and we're going to by your help but maybe we've not always had the right attitude toward those who didn't agree with us Lord baptize me today Jesus immerse me into your love immerse me oh Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus baptize every one of these musicians baptize every one of our deacons our trustees Our Song leaders every man woman boy or girl our Ley our youth our youth leaders every one of us Lord God baptize us into such a baptism of love that we will leave this place today and saying by the grace of God I am changed I am changed I've been a Christian for 50 years or whatever more of my life but may each of us be able to say by the grace of God I am changed Hallelujah I am changed oh Jesus we were unlovable and you loved us now if you are living in us help us to love the unlovable help us to love the drunk the liar The Prostitute maybe the brother the sister that has trespassed against us help us Lord to forgive even as you forgave to love even as you loved Lord God oh Father fill us with that type of love then if if you so desire let these spiritual gifts fall among us but Lord let it be on the basis and the foundation of divine love if not it will cause one trouble after another but if we can get baptize in the real baptism of the Holy Ghost it won't be about my tongues or my prophecy or my Visions or my this or my that it'll be about the Church of the Living God it won't be about somebody claps longer for them than they did for me it won't be well I don't get to sing as much as they do it's not about us as an individual it's about the body of Jesus Christ we worship you today we love you father oh May the Holy Ghost I pray fill every fiber of my being Lord God oh Jesus how could I ever forget that day Lord when you come down in my uncle's little church there in the spirit of God so touch me yes that was a portion of your spirit how could I ever forget it Lord I remember as long as I'm in my right mind but oh Jesus May something happen to me today even greater than that Lord May such a baptism of Love engulf our souls that we will find our hearts our souls so in love with you that we can't live without talking to you every day we can't live without being a part of your word that when the church doors is open we can't wait to get to the house of God because we're so in love and Lord may we be so in love with you that we don't wait till Wednesday night to praise you but we praise you on Monday we praise you on Tuesday we praise you when it's raining we praise you when it's snowing we praise you when we're up we praise you when we're down because we fell in love with you Lord oh Grant it Lord Jesus Grant it Lord Jesus I pray father May the spirit of God fill Every Soul here today Lord fill Every Soul with your presence father in the name of Jesus Grant it I pray oh God grant it I pray hallelujah hallelujah in the name of Jesus Grant it Lord God fill us Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus let's just worship

he's wanting you to respond brother Brandon was down at brother Charlie Cox is there in 1956 and this quote I read to you today about making love to you this is after he was there brother Charlie told me about us standing out in his driveway several years ago there was two turtle doves sitting up on the power line then little turtle does was sitting there taking their necks and going around one another and they was cooing and cing and back and forth brother brandom took that and used it as a parable and explained to brother Charlie and all the brothers and he said that's the way God is God's wanting us to sat on that line with him he'll take his head and lean over to us and we'll coup back oh is that what you want today you don't want to be a law you're scared to death oh I got to go to

minutes in the presence of the Lord praise God think about where we're seated were seated at the table with the King remember that little shulamite when she come into the court of Solomon remember when he sent that Peloquin down there for for her the B the buyer it was made of gold and silver and purple and blue the Divine and Heavenly colors he sent his guards down there to get her to fetch her home you imagine she leaves that little Country Village where she's born and raised and she's heading up to a palace she don't know the ways of a queen she don't know the Royal Court she don't know how to curtsy as we'd say she don't know how they talk but she's on her journey praise God that's where we are today he's polishing up our etiquette he's polishing up our Royal manners so we'll know how to act in the Heavenly City praise be to God he's teaching us how to love glory to God so at the white Throne judgment when we are set there to be judges we will know how to judge properly oh we worship you Jesus you imagine what a journey it was as she goes back she heads back on the Peloquin now it takes several days for her to get back and they have to stop at night and Solomon sends his personal bodyguard to watch over her every one of them had their swords drawn there are to protect her you imagine at night should' say what's he like how do I do this and how do I do that I don't know I'm a country girl I don't know but she's on her way right outside the city the day of the arrival they get fires they get incense they get musicians it was Unbecoming for Solomon to go all the way back to her house so Solomon left his Palace and met her Midway so he walks out across the gate glory to God of the drawbridge and he comes down to where she is and meets her between his home and her home they've got incense they've got fire prayers and sacrifice the music is playing the guards stand there and they present Miss shulamite we looked at it years ago shulamite is the feminist form of Solomon so Mr peace marries Miss peace Mr Jesus Christ married Miss Jesus Christ he takes her by the hand you imagine nervously she slips her hand in his and they start walking up her heart is racing she ain't no City girl and here comes all them people they're screaming they're hollowing the eastern and Middle Eastern people even the message sisters do that today in Africa and different parts of the world when they're worshiping here they come h hallelujah hallelujah she's constantly needing his Assurance you okay I don't know I don't know you're doing fine just hold to me but I've
