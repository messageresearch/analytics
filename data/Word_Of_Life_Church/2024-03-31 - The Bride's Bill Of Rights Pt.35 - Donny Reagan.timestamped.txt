[39:26] Jesus
[40:23] you can put the words on the screen if
[40:24] if you want that way some guys won't put
[40:27] my picture on the
[40:33] screen aren't you glad he's
[40:36] alive how do you know he's
[40:41] alive I know he's
[40:44] alive I've seen him do Miracles that's
[40:47] that's one way I know he's
[40:49] alive I've seen him bring me from a
[40:53] sinner to what I am I know he's alive
[40:56] I've seen him bring bring me through
[40:57] many hard times in my life and bring me
[41:01] up on top so I know he's
[41:03] alive the gates and doors bar all the
[41:07] windows fastened
[41:10] down I spent the night in sleeplessness
[41:15] Rose at every
[41:17] sound half in Hopeless
[41:20] sorrow half in fear the day we find the
[41:24] soldiers breaking through to Dr us all
[41:33] away but just before the sunrise I heard
[41:37] something at the
[41:39] wall the gate began to
[41:42] Rattle and a voice began to
[41:45] call I hurried to the window I took down
[41:50] into the street expecting swords and
[41:56] torches and the the sound of solders
[42:03] feet there was no one there but Mary so
[42:08] I went down to let her
[42:10] in John stood there beside me as she
[42:14] told us where she'd been she said they
[42:18] moved him in the night and none of us
[42:21] knows where the stones been rolled away
[42:26] and now his body he isn't
[42:30] there we both ran toward the garden then
[42:34] John ran on
[42:36] ahead we found the stone in the empty
[42:40] tomb just the way that Mary said but the
[42:44] whining sheet that wrapped him in was
[42:47] just an empty
[42:49] shell however where they taken him was
[42:53] more than I could
[42:56] tell
[43:01] was something strange that happened
[43:03] there just what I did not
[43:06] know John believed a miracle but I just
[43:11] turned to go circumstance and
[43:15] speculation couldn't lift me very
[43:19] high cuz I'd seen them crucify
[43:25] him then I saw him
[43:28] [Music]
[43:32] die back inside the house again the
[43:36] guilt and anguish
[43:38] [Music]
[43:40] came everything I'd promised him just
[43:44] added to my shame when it last it came
[43:48] to choices I denied I knew his
[43:54] name even if he was a
[43:57] [Music]
[43:58] life it wouldn't be the
[44:04] [Music]
[44:06] same suddenly the air was filled with
[44:10] strange and sweet
[44:12] perfume light that came from everywhere
[44:16] draw Shadows from the
[44:19] room Jesus stood before me with his arms
[44:23] held open
[44:26] wide I fell down on my knees and just
[44:30] clung to him and
[44:32] [Music]
[44:35] cried like this then he raised me to my
[44:40] feet and as I looked into his
[44:45] eyes Love Came shining out from him like
[44:49] sunlight from the
[44:51] sky guilt to my
[44:54] confusion disappeared in sweet relief
[44:57] [Music]
[45:00] and every fear I'd ever had just
[45:04] melted into
[45:06] [Music]
[45:22] peace oh he's
[45:26] alive
[45:28] he's
[45:30] alive he's alive and we're forgiven
[45:34] Heaven's gates are open wide he's
[45:39] alive he's
[45:41] alive he is alive and I'm forgiven
[45:46] Heaven's gates are open wide he's
[45:54] alive he's alive
[46:02] [Music]
[46:19] hallelujah praise the Lord go ahead give
[46:22] him a hand clap he deserves it thank you
[46:26] Jesus
[46:32] praise the
[46:34] Lord praise the
[46:36] lord well if he is alive and we believe
[46:39] he is I guess the next question might be
[46:44] what are we going to do with
[46:45] him what are we going to do about him
[46:49] and what are we going to do with what
[46:50] he's done for us how he affected our
[46:55] lives today is a day day that
[46:58] Christendom acknowledges as the
[47:01] resurrection or like that wasn't this
[47:03] particular day but it's a day that we've
[47:06] set aside to be able to acknowledge what
[47:09] our Lord has done and we are so grateful
[47:11] today aren't
[47:12] we but what's sad about it to me is that
[47:16] tomorrow the majority of a lot of the
[47:18] church people will go right back to
[47:20] drink and smoking lying cheating running
[47:22] around doing whatever which means to me
[47:27] Easter didn't really have much effect on
[47:29] them at
[47:30] all but I'm so glad that Easter is not
[47:34] one day a year amen I don't know about
[47:37] you I enjoy Easter every day of the
[47:50] year let's turn to Luke chapter 7 if you
[47:54] would Luke 7:
[47:58] 44 now it's not going to be about the
[48:01] tomb today it's not going to be
[48:04] about the Roman guards and all of
[48:08] that but we'd like
[48:11] to focus
[48:13] on if he is alive and he has needs
[48:19] desires from his people are we going to
[48:22] be able to meet them or are we going to
[48:25] repeat the situ situation of Luke
[48:31] 7 we'll resume our scripture from the
[48:34] woman who's not been
[48:36] invited to the dinner that Jesus is
[48:41] at and the Simon the Pharisee has
[48:45] treated him bad cold and different
[48:49] reminds me of this world
[48:51] today we'll pick up in verse
[48:54] 44 and he turned to the woman
[48:58] and said unto
[49:01] Simon which is strange isn't it so he
[49:05] turns to her but he don't actually speak
[49:08] to her he turns to her and looks at her
[49:13] but he
[49:14] says unto
[49:16] Simon seest thou this woman I entered
[49:20] into thine house thou gavest me no water
[49:22] for my feet but she hath washed my feet
[49:26] with tears
[49:28] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[49:30] head thou gavest me no kiss but this
[49:34] woman since the time I came in hasth not
[49:37] ceased to kiss my
[49:39] feet my head with oil thou didst not
[49:44] anoint but this woman hasth anointed my
[49:48] feet with
[49:51] ointment Jesus is contrasting of course
[49:54] between her and Simon every that Simon
[49:58] neglected to do she did and did it
[50:02] better than he would
[50:05] have now look in verse
[50:07] 47 wherefore I say unto thee still
[50:12] talking to
[50:13] sment her sins which are
[50:16] many are forgiven now remember during
[50:20] this whole scenario he's not said one
[50:23] word to her
[50:25] yet so like he's not even acknowledged
[50:28] her by
[50:31] words I want you to listen to this
[50:33] carefully for she loved
[50:36] much but to whom little Is
[50:39] Forgiven the same love us little you
[50:43] know I found that principle to be
[50:44] exactly the same
[50:46] today this just one reason why a lot of
[50:48] the people that have been raised in
[50:50] message churches and they sat there and
[50:52] they've been raised with all the right
[50:53] morals and boy they can claim the moral
[50:56] High Ground
[50:57] I never drunk I never took dope I never
[51:00] done this this and this what I found
[51:02] with a lot of them is there're some of
[51:04] the hardest people you'll ever reach in
[51:06] your
[51:07] life because it's like they was raised
[51:10] up in church cut their teeth on a
[51:12] message Pew they started hearing the
[51:14] prophet said this and the prophet said
[51:15] that from the time they was that
[51:20] high so when they go to run it into
[51:22] people that really need
[51:24] forgiveness they ain't got much and if a
[51:27] person falls over and over and over
[51:29] again flat of their face they'll cut
[51:32] them
[51:33] off you know why they was forgiven of
[51:37] little themselves
[51:40] initially and they love
[51:44] little these are the words of Jesus now
[51:47] but to whom little is
[51:50] Forgiven the same love us little I don't
[51:54] know about you I don't want want to be
[51:57] that
[51:58] person I never did drink I never did
[52:00] smoke never took dope in my life never
[52:02] done any of that but as a kid I read
[52:05] this scripture and I purposed in my
[52:08] heart people's asked me Brother D why
[52:11] don't you give your testimony of how
[52:13] this I said I ain't really got that much
[52:15] to say would take me about 10 minutes so
[52:17] I ain't really got you know a lot of
[52:19] people got this big long gigantic
[52:21] testimony they was out into this and
[52:23] that and the other it takes days and
[52:25] days and talk about it well doesn't
[52:27] really but when I read this I remembered
[52:30] as a kid I thought God don't let this
[52:33] paralyze my love for
[52:36] you because I never did do a whole lot
[52:39] that somehow I can't love you
[52:43] greatly now listen but to whom little is
[52:46] Forgiven the same love us
[52:50] little I love this verse
[52:53] 48 and he said un
[52:57] to
[52:59] her so the first words she hears
[53:03] directly from him to her are these
[53:08] words thy
[53:10] sins Lord are
[53:14] forgiven praise the
[53:18] Lord aren't you glad yours have been
[53:23] to let's go before the Lord now in
[53:26] prayer
[53:29] Lord Jesus as we have gathered here
[53:32] today we're thankful Lord hearing the
[53:35] songs that we've heard
[53:37] sung about how great you are in your
[53:39] resurrection and what you've done for
[53:42] us we are so
[53:45] happy dear God but we're thankful that
[53:48] tomorrow morning when we get up this

[55:04] today is not only the day of worship and
[55:07] celebration as the word is used for
[55:12] Easter but it is also a day of
[55:15] celebration for the transgender
[55:17] Community yeah transgender day of
[55:22] visibility and our president stood and
[55:25] from the White House came the great
[55:28] news and they're so happy that it landed
[55:31] on
[55:32] Easter and if our president don't repent
[55:36] the man will be annihilated in hell oh
[55:39] my if our nation does not repent the
[55:43] majority of Americans will be
[55:47] destroyed in the Lake of Fire
[55:50] amen and if you're here today and you're
[55:53] lost if you don't make peace with God
[55:56] you will wind up in the same place amen
[56:00] but you don't have
[56:01] to you see it's all by choice well what
[56:05] if I'm not bride that doesn't even
[56:07] matter if you're not bride and you don't
[56:10] want to be lost you don't have to you
[56:14] choose to be
[56:16] lost you fight your way to hell every
[56:21] day amen you fight over a mama's prayers
[56:24] a daddy's prayers a grandmother or a
[56:26] preacher a church whatever it
[56:31] is our setting opens again
[56:34] with this man which has a very
[56:38] hypocritical
[56:40] heart a man that is chosen this
[56:43] particular time to be able to humiliate
[56:47] and embarrass the Lord
[56:50] Jesus he feels like he'll be really
[56:54] applauded by maybe the
[56:57] scribes and the upper echelon the
[56:59] Pharisee
[57:01] move no doubt they'll meet him down at
[57:04] the marketplace tomorrow and they'll
[57:06] shake his hand and say wow that was
[57:10] absolutely phenomenal how did you ever
[57:14] orchestrate that in your mind to work
[57:17] this out where you could get this actor
[57:20] this
[57:22] impostor Jesus soall the son of God God
[57:27] the Messiah you tricked him into coming
[57:31] and then once you got him there you
[57:33] didn't wash his feet you gave him no oil
[57:36] no kiss I've got to congratulate you it
[57:40] was well
[57:44] planned but it just so happened to be
[57:47] there was a seat of God there that was
[57:50] going to interrupt Simon's
[57:54] plans I'm glad God still got them
[57:56] scattered everywhere don't
[57:59] you her conduct showed that this woman
[58:03] was truly
[58:04] pentant desired to be cleansed from what
[58:08] she
[58:09] was now we know her occupation was she
[58:13] was a woman of ill
[58:16] Fame probably wasn't a time that that
[58:19] happened that she didn't feel terrible
[58:21] about
[58:22] it wishing to God she could get
[58:25] delivered the law condemned her people
[58:28] condemned her no doubt the women of the
[58:31] city would have nothing to do with her
[58:34] they looked down on her they shamed her
[58:36] they ridiculed her but this had such a
[58:39] hold of her life she didn't feel like
[58:42] she could ever be
[58:44] free but you see when Jesus has a name
[58:47] on his personal
[58:49] diary there's not enough powers in hell
[58:53] to keep them from
[58:55] Redemption
[58:56] her penitent attitude and her reaction
[59:00] to that attitude and because her love
[59:05] was what Jesus called great now wonder
[59:09] where she got this great love cuz she
[59:13] hadn't even got the Holy Ghost
[59:17] yet actually this woman never
[59:22] repents by
[59:25] words
[59:27] show me her repentant prayer dear Lord
[59:30] Jesus I pray today heavenly father that
[59:33] you would just come on the scene and
[59:35] pardon me of my
[59:37] sins we don't even find the word sorry
[59:41] we don't find the word
[59:44] repent but what we see is her repentant
[59:48] attitude reflected by
[59:52] works and bearing his shame
[59:56] now notice the contrast between the
[1:00:00] Pharisee and the woman how different
[1:00:03] they were Simon was so indifferent
[1:00:07] toward the lord Jesus so his
[1:00:10] indifference was
[1:00:13] contrasted by her penitent
[1:00:16] attitude and the Lord Jesus contrasts
[1:00:19] the both of them and these verses that
[1:00:22] we just read so she was so earnest
[1:00:26] Earnest and so desirous to do something
[1:00:28] for him he withheld water from
[1:00:33] him and she gave water from her
[1:00:39] eyes she gave precious
[1:00:42] tears now I want you to think about
[1:00:45] yourself today on this Easter
[1:00:48] day and as many have gathered around the
[1:00:51] world and already in New Zealand the
[1:00:54] service is there brother Daryl and and
[1:00:56] Brother David they're about 18 hours
[1:00:57] ahead of us across the International
[1:00:59] Date Line in the Pacific so they're
[1:01:02] about 18 hours ahead of us so it's
[1:01:04] already uh well past their Easter
[1:01:07] services no doubt in Louisiana it's it's
[1:01:10] already getting winding down they're
[1:01:12] fixing to eat breakfast get on the bus
[1:01:14] head back home different parts of the
[1:01:16] world Europe they've done had their
[1:01:18] Easter services I've done got greetings
[1:01:21] from Europe and and Africa this morning
[1:01:23] on the Easter but as we're gather here
[1:01:26] today I wonder how many people here and
[1:01:29] how many people around the world that
[1:01:31] have celebrated Easter but in reality
[1:01:34] they will do the exact same thing some
[1:01:38] of our churches in America today have
[1:01:41] set aside this day and they're going to
[1:01:44] have drag
[1:01:50] shows titling it Drag Me to Church
[1:01:58] it's no wonder that our nation will be
[1:02:02] annihilated I know this is not the
[1:02:04] Easter Sermon you expected to hear is
[1:02:08] it it breaks my heart as an American to
[1:02:12] think the bombs already have our names
[1:02:15] written on them is it any
[1:02:18] Wonder we take this blessed thing of the
[1:02:21] resurrection of our
[1:02:23] Lord and we do want to the very sins of
[1:02:27] Sodom which is an abomination in the
[1:02:31] eyes of God oh brother Donnie don't say
[1:02:33] that don't say that you'll get us in
[1:02:35] trouble the way I look at it I'll get in
[1:02:37] trouble if I don't see it I'd rather be
[1:02:40] in trouble with the world than in
[1:02:42] trouble with
[1:02:46] God so what did they do I wonder how
[1:02:49] many churches today have sang and they
[1:02:51] worshiped and they've raised their hands
[1:02:53] and they've had their drag queens
[1:02:57] to celebrate
[1:02:59] Easter what an
[1:03:03] Abomination Jesus don't want no drag
[1:03:06] queen in Memorial oh he will he will Ex
[1:03:10] he will let you come to him like that
[1:03:13] but you won't remain
[1:03:17] one I said you won't remain one you go
[1:03:21] from a drag queen to being the Queen of
[1:03:24] Heaven if you get get saved Sanctified
[1:03:28] filled with the Holy
[1:03:31] Ghost I wonder how many churches today
[1:03:34] held water from him I wonder how many
[1:03:38] was held
[1:03:40] oil wow Simon did not give one drop of
[1:03:46] oil this woman broke open a whole
[1:03:52] box and she didn't go to Big Lots to get
[1:03:55] it
[1:03:56] but she went to the most expensive
[1:03:59] perfume place in the whole
[1:04:05] vicinity imagine her as she walks out of
[1:04:07] there with this in her hands and
[1:04:10] probably she's never even held such an
[1:04:14] expensive exotic oil in her
[1:04:18] life little bit of calamus mixed with
[1:04:22] just a tinch of camper a little scent
[1:04:26] wood a little bit of
[1:04:28] myrrh and the aroma was so powerful as
[1:04:32] it was released out of this Teakwood
[1:04:36] box and she just just savored it walking
[1:04:40] it down and she could have kept it she
[1:04:44] could have took it back
[1:04:45] home but she bought it for a
[1:04:49] reason and the name of the reason was
[1:04:54] Jesus I if you didn't come today to show
[1:04:57] off your new dress sisters if your
[1:04:59] brother's got a new tire or a new suit
[1:05:01] or a new sport coat I hope you didn't
[1:05:04] come today to show it off I hope the
[1:05:06] reason you came to church today was the
[1:05:10] same name why she came to Simon's house
[1:05:14] the Lord Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ
[1:05:21] Hallelujah not one drop of oil was given
[1:05:24] by Simon
[1:05:26] but she break open the whole
[1:05:29] box he treated him with
[1:05:32] humiliation and
[1:05:34] shame and despite and looked down his
[1:05:38] nose at him as an
[1:05:40] underling but when she come in she
[1:05:43] treated him like a
[1:05:47] prince imagine in the same room one
[1:05:51] gives no water the other gives water
[1:05:53] from the
[1:05:54] tears as one of the father's Church
[1:05:57] fathers wrote blood from her
[1:06:02] heart weeped its way out her
[1:06:07] eyes and she kisses his feet Simon gives
[1:06:11] his no kiss upon his
[1:06:14] neck but she kisses over and over and
[1:06:19] over his feet in the same building two
[1:06:24] totally different things going
[1:06:26] on oh I if there's going to be any water
[1:06:29] today let it come from me if there's
[1:06:33] going to be any oil today let it come
[1:06:36] from me if there's going to be any
[1:06:38] kissing the sun let it come from me may
[1:06:42] I never be guilty of going to church no
[1:06:45] matter where it's at around the world
[1:06:48] and fulfilling the part of Simon how
[1:06:52] many feels that way
[1:06:54] today the water
[1:06:56] for the feet the kiss for the
[1:07:00] neck the oil for the head now all of
[1:07:05] these were
[1:07:07] ordinary Oriental
[1:07:10] courtesies so this wasn't like it was a
[1:07:13] great extravagant thing that Jesus
[1:07:16] should have got everybody else in that
[1:07:19] building already got
[1:07:21] that so he was left out intentionally
[1:07:27] our nation our world is so
[1:07:31] consumed with everybody's
[1:07:35] rights but they've left out Jesus
[1:07:40] rights Jesus has a right to a church he
[1:07:43] has a right to a people filled with the
[1:07:46] Holy Ghost he has a right to a church
[1:07:49] that he himself purchased but do they
[1:07:51] want to hear that do away with it
[1:07:57] but we're of a different genos a
[1:08:00] different seed
[1:08:03] line when Jesus would justify this
[1:08:07] woman in the eyes of Simon he would used
[1:08:12] her
[1:08:13] works because that's the only thing
[1:08:15] Simon would be able to relate to he
[1:08:18] wasn't a man of the heart he was a man
[1:08:20] of the head so he couldn't relate to
[1:08:24] Faith but when Jesus went to acknowledge
[1:08:27] this woman to
[1:08:30] herself he never mentioned her
[1:08:33] works it mentioned her
[1:08:37] faith never mentioned the oil never
[1:08:40] mentioned the water never mention what
[1:08:43] one of her
[1:08:44] Works want you notice and God gifts
[1:08:48] always found their
[1:08:50] places you are
[1:08:52] identified by your gift now keep this in
[1:08:56] your mind when we're talking about Simon
[1:08:58] and this woman that you are identified
[1:09:02] by your gift now the prophet is
[1:09:04] preaching his Christmas message here in
[1:09:06] 1963 God's gifts always find their
[1:09:10] places so he's talking about the
[1:09:13] Magis and he's talking about the father
[1:09:16] who had a child that died and the little
[1:09:19] girl all she wanted was a little
[1:09:22] doll and the man went out of his mind
[1:09:27] and the man looking for his little
[1:09:29] daughter thinking she was still alive
[1:09:32] and he found a little
[1:09:36] dolly it was torn it was
[1:09:39] ragged but he wanted to take his little
[1:09:42] girl a doll so of all stories a prophet
[1:09:46] used this in this
[1:09:47] sermon and he said that was appropriate
[1:09:51] gift for a little
[1:09:53] girl now I want you to see think
[1:09:56] today what you give the Lord Jesus not
[1:09:59] just on Easter but every day tomorrow
[1:10:03] Tuesday Wednesday the rest of your life
[1:10:06] that actually
[1:10:08] tells how and what you think of
[1:10:13] him now listen carefully you are
[1:10:16] identified by your gift that you give
[1:10:20] your entire being to it to identified
[1:10:28] deity so if all you give Jesus is we see
[1:10:32] you here today on Easter Sunday and we
[1:10:34] won't see you again to Christmas or to
[1:10:37] next Easter or Mother's Day or something
[1:10:39] like that that actually tells what you
[1:10:42] think about
[1:10:44] Jesus because your gift
[1:10:48] identifies what importance you think he
[1:10:51] should have you understand Simon's
[1:10:55] deprival of the water and the kiss and
[1:10:59] the oil and just the common
[1:11:03] courtesy it showed what he thought about
[1:11:07] Jesus little did that man
[1:11:10] know
[1:11:13] God walked into his
[1:11:16] house and God set in one of his
[1:11:23] chairs I hope everybody here today
[1:11:26] recognizes allmighty God is in this
[1:11:30] building this
[1:11:32] morning the angels of the Lord are here
[1:11:36] with us in this service
[1:11:38] today and our gifts back to him whether
[1:11:41] it's praise raising our hands adoration
[1:11:45] Lord I love you I worship you Jesus by
[1:11:48] your gifts back to him today and every
[1:11:50] other day tells how you value him
[1:11:56] in your
[1:11:57] life so if you speak to him every now
[1:12:00] and then that's your gift you worship
[1:12:03] him every now and then that's your gift
[1:12:05] that tells how you value Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ by the gift you give
[1:12:13] him now listen this is a powerful
[1:12:15] statement you're identified by your gift
[1:12:19] that you give your entire being to it to
[1:12:22] identify deity then you identify
[1:12:25] yourself with deity by giving all you
[1:12:30] are now you see this one thing that
[1:12:32] separates the bride from the church the
[1:12:33] church will never be able to do this
[1:12:35] they will never be able to give
[1:12:37] everything they are to
[1:12:40] him and by doing that that identifies
[1:12:44] their position of where they are but the
[1:12:48] bride has a god-given ability it may
[1:12:51] take her years in spite of all of her
[1:12:54] mistakes and
[1:12:55] failures but she will finally reach that
[1:12:58] place one day that she will be able to
[1:13:02] give everything she is and when she does
[1:13:05] she steps into that
[1:13:07] sphere of deity
[1:13:12] herself it ain't no wonder Satan wants
[1:13:15] you to keep an Avenue of your heart a
[1:13:18] secret besetting sin that only you and
[1:13:21] God know
[1:13:22] about because Satan knows if you're ever
[1:13:25] able to arrive at that spot that you can
[1:13:28] say
[1:13:30] Lord I give you everything I
[1:13:33] am my pride my arrogance my temper my
[1:13:37] habits if they're wrong whatever it
[1:13:40] is that don't mean you won't be bothered
[1:13:42] now but you finally reached a spot where
[1:13:46] you could give it all to him
[1:13:49] amen notice how he says then you
[1:13:52] identify yourself with deity by giving
[1:13:54] all you you are what you are to
[1:13:59] deity
[1:14:01] himself now the anot type of this was
[1:14:03] over in the Book of Genesis whenever the
[1:14:06] first two worshippers outside the garden
[1:14:08] of garden gate brought an offering to
[1:14:11] the Lord Hebrews 11:4 by faith Abel
[1:14:15] offered unto God a more
[1:14:19] excellent
[1:14:21] sacrifice a more excellent
[1:14:25] now Cain offered a sacrifice but it was
[1:14:29] a sacrifice of botney life no
[1:14:34] blood No sacrifice a pumpkin don't cry
[1:14:37] when you cut it a tomato Don't Cry tears
[1:14:40] whenever you cut it right but an animal
[1:14:45] an animal would have to feel the pain of
[1:14:48] death it's amazing how we trade dead
[1:14:53] things for live things
[1:14:56] look at a lot of the sports and things
[1:14:58] that people get so caught up in what is
[1:15:01] it a dead thing whether that's a
[1:15:03] football a baseball a basketball a
[1:15:06] soccer ball pickle ball whatever it is
[1:15:09] look at the things that people worship
[1:15:11] their cars their homes their jobs every
[1:15:15] one of those things and many more that I
[1:15:17] can name every one of them are dead they
[1:15:20] have no life no life and yet they will
[1:15:23] put those dead things
[1:15:25] before the resurrection and the life the
[1:15:29] Lord
[1:15:30] Jesus see think of how that Satan has
[1:15:33] got us into such a trap that we will put
[1:15:37] dead things before the only thing that
[1:15:40] can give us
[1:15:43] life now watch and as Paul goes on in
[1:15:47] this that Abel offered unto God a more
[1:15:50] excellent sacrifice than Cain so Cain
[1:15:53] did but his excelled in Glory by which
[1:15:58] he obtained witness now notice this is
[1:16:01] very unusual witness and yet the Bible
[1:16:05] doesn't tell us of anybody else being
[1:16:07] there except Cain and Abel but yet it
[1:16:10] goes on to say by which he obtained
[1:16:13] witness that he was righteous and how
[1:16:17] was this witness obtained that God
[1:16:21] testifying of his
[1:16:24] gifts Oh you mean so God himself
[1:16:28] testified now when you compare this back
[1:16:30] with the Book of Genesis and theodosian
[1:16:33] one of the early writers in the 2
[1:16:35] Century took this word he was actually
[1:16:37] the first one to take the Hebrew Bible
[1:16:41] and be able to translate it over into
[1:16:43] the Greek so the New Testament Greeks
[1:16:46] would be able to read and understand the
[1:16:48] Old Testament so he was quite a a a
[1:16:51] scholar of Greek of taking the the
[1:16:54] Hebrew word and bringing them over so he
[1:16:57] picked up this word and he says that
[1:17:00] whenever God
[1:17:02] looked upon Abel's
[1:17:05] sacrifice that the word means to
[1:17:09] ignite with a
[1:17:12] fire so God look so
[1:17:16] intensely at Abel's
[1:17:18] sacrifice that God set it on
[1:17:23] fire with his
[1:17:28] eyes I hope if he's not done that to you
[1:17:32] he will before this service is over
[1:17:34] today believe it or not I just described
[1:17:37] to you receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:40] Ghost amen you can jump shout holl and
[1:17:43] scream and run all that's wonderful and
[1:17:45] good but if you ever get the Holy Ghost
[1:17:47] The Eyes Of God look so intently upon
[1:17:50] your soul as it were that he sets you on
[1:17:53] fire and you'll be on fire the rest of
[1:17:56] your
[1:18:00] life notice Paul says that abble offered
[1:18:03] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:18:06] came by which he obtained witness so
[1:18:09] there is worshiping praying praising God
[1:18:13] offers the lamb takes the knife The Rock
[1:18:15] cuts it and he he goes through all the
[1:18:17] sacrifice and while there oh Adonai yahe
[1:18:21] Elohim and He blesses God and he's
[1:18:24] standing in there and all of a
[1:18:30] sudden and he opens his eyes and he sees
[1:18:32] his
[1:18:33] lamb on
[1:18:37] fire but he wasn't the only
[1:18:42] one his a brother had decorated his
[1:18:45] altar with flowers and beautiful roses
[1:18:48] and
[1:18:50] lies had all of his produce laid out and
[1:18:54] he worked
[1:18:56] hard no fire no witness no God
[1:19:03] nowhere you see that altar represented
[1:19:05] every church that does not want the true
[1:19:09] baptism of the Holy
[1:19:11] Ghost and there's millions of them
[1:19:14] today they gather and they'll have the
[1:19:17] the Easter lies on the Altar and the
[1:19:19] beautiful flowers and the arrangement
[1:19:21] and my their music would outdo ours 10
[1:19:23] to one their ability to sing and their
[1:19:27] preacher would preach a whole lot nicer
[1:19:29] and have his words Al together much
[1:19:31] nicer than I could ever
[1:19:34] preach and their congregation will dress
[1:19:37] so nice Rolex watches everywhere and
[1:19:40] jaguars and this and that and the other
[1:19:42] on the parking lot but I wonder if
[1:19:44] there'll be one of them that'll bear
[1:19:47] witness of the presence of God being in
[1:19:49] the
[1:19:51] service do we want his witness or not
[1:19:55] not or do we want to just gather like
[1:19:58] everybody else and go home and then go
[1:20:00] eat lunch and say it was a good
[1:20:03] day if he doesn't bear witness that we
[1:20:06] are preaching the truths we are just as
[1:20:11] lost as anyone
[1:20:17] else notice this in the unwelcome
[1:20:21] Christ Jesus with dirty feet
[1:20:25] it does something to me to say that God
[1:20:30] Jesus the invited guest the prince of
[1:20:33] Glory the Fountain of Life and unwelcome
[1:20:36] with dirty feet sitting there with
[1:20:40] dung on his
[1:20:43] feet from the
[1:20:46] road so here is Jesus sitting in Simon's
[1:20:51] house sweating he's
[1:20:53] perspired Jesus would have had body
[1:20:55] order Believe It or Not Just Like You
[1:20:57] and
[1:20:59] I the donkeys the cattle the sheep used
[1:21:02] the same roads that the pedestrians
[1:21:05] would have
[1:21:07] used Jesus would have had some of that
[1:21:10] manure mixed with the dust on his
[1:21:16] feet so he's sitting there
[1:21:21] smelling sweat has marked his clothes
[1:21:26] and he himself himself can smell the
[1:21:29] dung on his feet and you imagine
[1:21:31] everybody
[1:21:33] else oh boy he's some Holy Roller ain't
[1:21:37] he how can they even serve him he stink
[1:21:41] so
[1:21:44] bad Son of
[1:21:46] God Messiah
[1:21:49] Christos anointed
[1:21:53] one
[1:21:56] I wonder how much he was laughed at
[1:21:59] today on Easter
[1:22:08] Sunday amongst all the rest of them all
[1:22:11] polished and smelling good there he
[1:22:14] said with
[1:22:17] droop weary face sweat stains on his
[1:22:21] beard eyes drooped
[1:22:26] down
[1:22:29] unkissed Jesus
[1:22:32] embarrassed Jesus
[1:22:36] humiliated
[1:22:37] Jesus
[1:22:42] unwelcome
[1:22:43] Hallelujah but he had a woman that was
[1:22:46] willing to bear his reproach before his
[1:22:51] resurrection he's got thousands times
[1:22:54] thousands of men and women today who are
[1:22:57] willing to bear his reproach after his
[1:23:03] resurrection because see we are the same
[1:23:06] type of people that she was we are
[1:23:09] willing to bear his reproach laugh at me
[1:23:12] if you please make fun of him if you
[1:23:14] wish to I really don't care I'm willing
[1:23:18] to Bear the reproach of the word
[1:23:22] today oh my
[1:23:25] I want you to listen to this
[1:23:28] Jesus
[1:23:30] wants to be
[1:23:35] kissed can you
[1:23:37] imagine
[1:23:39] Jesus wants to be
[1:23:43] kissed there's a scripture in the Bible
[1:23:45] that said kiss the son lest he be angry
[1:23:51] that's right Jesus wants to be k
[1:23:56] kissed did you ever kiss
[1:23:59] him sure you can he's sitting there
[1:24:02] unwelcome Dirty Feet Jesus a dirty feet
[1:24:05] oh don't that make you feel
[1:24:09] funny Jesus Dirty Feet unwelcome look
[1:24:12] what you do with him today instead of
[1:24:15] bringing him into your big fine Church
[1:24:20] you push him off in some little
[1:24:22] Mission Down on the Corner
[1:24:28] Corner the Lord's given us a nice place
[1:24:32] I'm grateful for don't
[1:24:33] you but I'll tell you one thing I hope
[1:24:36] we never get to a
[1:24:38] place that we tell Jesus you ain't
[1:24:41] welcome in there
[1:24:43] church we don't want no running we don't
[1:24:45] want no people screaming at the altar we
[1:24:47] don't want no jabbering in that tongue
[1:24:49] stuff we don't want none of that stuff
[1:24:51] around here but as long as I'm the
[1:24:53] pastor we
[1:24:56] anybody with
[1:25:02] me the prophet told us that people tend
[1:25:05] to when they get a new church they tend
[1:25:07] to get cold and
[1:25:10] starchy well I say we break that Norm I
[1:25:14] say we refuse to fit in that quote T to
[1:25:18] you now you can fit in that quote if you
[1:25:21] wish to but I ain't going
[1:25:23] to
[1:25:24] notice this if someone came at your
[1:25:27] house and you didn't entertain them they
[1:25:29] wouldn't come many times maybe that's
[1:25:32] what's a matter tonight maybe that's
[1:25:34] what's a matter around our homes and
[1:25:37] around our churches we're afraid or
[1:25:40] ashamed to entertain Jesus you're afraid
[1:25:43] somebody will hear you say
[1:25:47] Amen you mean just by saying amen you
[1:25:52] are actually entertaining
[1:25:56] Jesus if you believe a servant of God is
[1:25:59] Anointed by the Holy Ghost and brother
[1:26:01] Pete stood up here on Wednesday night
[1:26:03] and ministered the word didn't he do an
[1:26:05] awesome job and ministered to us the
[1:26:07] word of God and you realize you're not
[1:26:10] Amen in brother Pete you're not Amen in
[1:26:12] brother Donnie so much you're Amen in
[1:26:15] the word it's Jesus anointing that man
[1:26:18] and when you say Amen men women children
[1:26:22] boys girls when you say amen you are
[1:26:26] entertaining Jesus
[1:26:35] Christ well just from that I'd say a lot
[1:26:38] more of you need to entertain Jesus with
[1:26:40] more of your amens instead of sitting
[1:26:41] there looking at me come
[1:26:44] on you're afraid to raise up your hands
[1:26:47] and give him praise you're ashamed cause
[1:26:50] your neighbor sitting there or somebody
[1:26:52] else what do I I care about your
[1:26:56] neighbor Worship the Lord you asked him
[1:27:00] you invited him then worship him when he
[1:27:07] comes Hallelujah when we invite him to
[1:27:11] come in your then when he comes let's
[1:27:14] worship him let's praise him let's adore
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:23] him oh
[1:27:28] my I love the way he words this there's
[1:27:32] just something about this Moody
[1:27:34] Institute
[1:27:36] vernacular that brother Brenham gained
[1:27:38] from going to Bible
[1:27:40] Seminary and all the years that he spent
[1:27:43] in Latin and Greek and all of
[1:27:47] that what we need tonight is an
[1:27:50] oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining
[1:27:53] place
[1:27:56] hallelujah what we need tonight is an
[1:27:59] old fasting Jesus Christ entertaining
[1:28:03] place is that what you all want Word of
[1:28:06] Life to be an
[1:28:09] oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining
[1:28:13] place but I'll tell you friend that
[1:28:15] don't fit with a lot of modern theology
[1:28:18] that don't fit with a lot of modern
[1:28:20] churches are not interested in
[1:28:22] entertaining Jesus they want to
[1:28:25] entertain the mayor or they want to
[1:28:27] entertain the governor or they want to
[1:28:29] entertain the rich and the famous I say
[1:28:32] we forget all of that and we make up in
[1:28:35] our minds by the grace of God we are
[1:28:39] dedicating this building to be an
[1:28:42] oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining
[1:28:45] place where the sick can be healed and
[1:28:48] the lost can be found and those without
[1:28:51] the Holy Ghost can be filled and those
[1:28:54] those that are backslid can be renewed
[1:28:57] and those Hallelujah that are bound with
[1:29:00] homosexuality can be delivered and the
[1:29:03] oppressed can be raised
[1:29:11] up hallelujah
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:22] hallelujah what we need to is an
[1:29:24] oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining
[1:29:28] place where men and women can
[1:29:32] forget
[1:29:34] themselves and
[1:29:37] entertain
[1:29:40] Jesus but he comes
[1:29:43] anyhow even if you just give
[1:29:47] him five minutes a
[1:29:51] day over in the closet
[1:29:54] down in the
[1:29:56] basement he will take
[1:29:59] it he will take
[1:30:02] whatever you offer
[1:30:05] him a't that
[1:30:12] awful you and I would never look at it
[1:30:15] quite like this I'm sure and then the
[1:30:16] prophet said that shows to
[1:30:19] me he's God to
[1:30:23] me
[1:30:27] so out of your busy day if you wind up
[1:30:30] giving him 10 minutes just him and you
[1:30:32] alone not you on texting and you you
[1:30:34] know checking this and looking at that
[1:30:36] and all that just just you and him alone
[1:30:39] and you just give him five 10 minutes
[1:30:41] he'll take it and turn around and say
[1:30:43] thank
[1:30:47] you thank you for spending a little bit
[1:30:49] of time with
[1:30:51] me and me to world to
[1:30:56] you know the truth of it is all of us
[1:30:58] want to feel like we're loved don't we
[1:31:01] don't we want to feel like we're loved
[1:31:02] don't we want to feel like that we're
[1:31:04] accepted don't we want to feel like
[1:31:06] we're a part of
[1:31:08] something don't you
[1:31:11] understand so does
[1:31:14] he I read a quote the other day where
[1:31:17] the Prophet said whenever I founding
[1:31:18] fathers and whenever they wrote that
[1:31:21] Declaration of Independence and they set
[1:31:22] an empty chair at the table
[1:31:26] he said I believe with all of my heart
[1:31:28] Jesus Christ set in that
[1:31:34] chair but do you think they want him
[1:31:36] anymore you think they want him in
[1:31:38] Congress they want him in Senate you
[1:31:40] think our White House wants him no oh
[1:31:43] some of you got your hopes Donald
[1:31:44] Trump's going to win it all back and
[1:31:45] bring America back to Revival that man
[1:31:47] is going to go to hell too if he don't
[1:31:49] get
[1:31:50] saved well come on you bunch of
[1:31:52] Republicans Or democrats whatever I
[1:31:54] ain't preaching politics I'm preaching
[1:31:56] salvation you don't go to heaven because
[1:31:59] you're a former president or a current
[1:32:01] president you go to heaven because you
[1:32:03] meet God's
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:12] requirements here he's sitting in the
[1:32:14] Pharisees house
[1:32:17] God walked in the
[1:32:19] door and nobody paid any attention to
[1:32:22] him they were too busy that's what we
[1:32:26] are today we're too busy making prelates
[1:32:28] we're too busy to see if this person's
[1:32:31] baptized correct or not we're too busy
[1:32:32] to see what position he has what can he
[1:32:35] do with him in the church we're too busy
[1:32:37] with people and the things of the church
[1:32:40] to let Christ come by without
[1:32:43] entertaining we're too busy to see
[1:32:46] everything's carried on just so un so we
[1:32:48] fail to entertain Jesus after we've
[1:32:52] invited him to our place
[1:32:57] many times you're too busy at home in
[1:33:00] your home life you got so many
[1:33:05] things you have to
[1:33:07] do you can't take time to pray just too
[1:33:13] busy how many can say
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:20] amen now let's look at the Song of
[1:33:22] Solomon
[1:33:24] chapter 5
[1:33:27] verse1 this is after Solomon and the
[1:33:31] shulamite or
[1:33:36] married
[1:33:38] she has done
[1:33:40] something that more than likely every
[1:33:43] Christian has done at one time or
[1:33:46] another she actually went into the
[1:33:50] bedroom and went to bed without him
[1:33:55] she didn't wait on
[1:33:57] him and
[1:33:59] he he comes to the door to where she
[1:34:03] is oh brother you talking about
[1:34:05] reminding you of this Ley and
[1:34:08] age I am coming to my garden Song of
[1:34:13] Solomon 5 ver1 I coming into my
[1:34:15] garden my sister my
[1:34:19] spouse I've gathered my myrr with my
[1:34:25] spice now remember the Song of Solomon
[1:34:27] was
[1:34:29] considered so intimate and and such a
[1:34:33] book of mystery by the Jews it was
[1:34:35] called the holy of
[1:34:38] holies of the Old
[1:34:41] Testament Jewish parents would not let
[1:34:43] their kids read it until they were
[1:34:46] several years old no doubt they still
[1:34:48] don't understand it to this
[1:34:51] day now in this the time of the Lord is
[1:34:56] answering to the antitype of Solomon and
[1:34:59] the shulamite is the antitype of the
[1:35:02] bride and our Lord's satisfaction is
[1:35:06] in his church and and Christ is
[1:35:10] delighted with the offerings of his
[1:35:14] people which he says this by I have
[1:35:17] gathered my myrr and my
[1:35:20] spice and then the next thing we see is
[1:35:23] the Lord
[1:35:24] satisfaction is found in his people's
[1:35:29] love as I said last Sunday it just about
[1:35:33] overwhelms me to think that he would
[1:35:34] condescend to such a level of
[1:35:38] dependency upon
[1:35:41] Humanity you know that is that day and
[1:35:43] age we're living in you can't depend on
[1:35:46] nobody right the way I look at it
[1:35:49] there's going to be at least a few
[1:35:50] contractors a few painters a few few
[1:35:54] electricians few carpet layers a few
[1:35:57] this that and that and that and that
[1:35:58] that'll be saved so the Lord can prove
[1:36:01] to the devil that he can save them right
[1:36:04] and if they give you their word they
[1:36:06] will keep it or at least let you know
[1:36:07] why they
[1:36:09] can't I I figur there'll even be a few
[1:36:11] Christians that'll be
[1:36:13] there because Christians are just about
[1:36:15] as bad you know they give you a word
[1:36:17] about this and other it don't mean
[1:36:18] nothing shame on us our word should be
[1:36:21] our bond amen come on now children don't
[1:36:25] get that old Leo to seeing thing on you
[1:36:27] it is lying you know if you tell
[1:36:30] somebody that you won't be there and
[1:36:31] something comes up at least let them
[1:36:33] know if you owe them tell them brother
[1:36:35] I'm sorry I'm going to pay you but I
[1:36:37] just can't do it don't just take for
[1:36:39] granted that it's okay it's not okay
[1:36:43] well who in the world was that for you
[1:36:45] or you or well we don't know but our
[1:36:49] Lord's satisfaction again is the love
[1:36:52] for his people because he so desired to
[1:36:56] love and to be loved notice he says I'm
[1:36:59] coming to my garden my sister my spouse
[1:37:02] I have gathered my myrr with my spice I
[1:37:05] have eaten my honeycomb with my honey
[1:37:09] I've drunk my wine and my milk eat oh
[1:37:12] friends drink yay drink abundantly oh
[1:37:16] beloved I have eaten my
[1:37:19] honeycomb and my honey he takes such
[1:37:22] intense SA isfaction in the things that
[1:37:26] you and I give to him we are the ones
[1:37:29] bringing these offerings of the myrr and
[1:37:32] the frankincense which is the aromatics
[1:37:35] that FS the room of his presence where
[1:37:37] we are and then the honeyone and and the
[1:37:41] drink and the eats and all that he's
[1:37:43] going to have that's where he gets
[1:37:46] something ministered to him that angels
[1:37:49] can never
[1:37:51] touch oh
[1:37:54] and yet he receives it with our
[1:37:58] flaws he receives it tainted with
[1:38:03] humanity and acknowledges it as if
[1:38:06] though it was from the Holy
[1:38:09] Angels
[1:38:13] thems to hear him describe it it was
[1:38:19] perfect he accepts our love and says I
[1:38:22] have eaten
[1:38:24] my
[1:38:25] honeycomb with my honey I have eaten my
[1:38:29] honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my
[1:38:31] wine and my milk so his satisfaction
[1:38:35] with our love and praise and worship and
[1:38:38] adoration as if he's eating and drinking
[1:38:42] this is what it does to our
[1:38:45] Lord when you worship When you pray when
[1:38:48] you
[1:38:49] praise you are watering remember the
[1:38:51] prophet talking about Rebecca when she
[1:38:54] took the baales of water and she watered
[1:38:56] the camel the very Holy Spirit he said
[1:38:59] which was going to carry her back when
[1:39:00] you Worship the Lord and praise him and
[1:39:03] bless his name you are ministering to
[1:39:06] the very power that's going to change

[1:55:36] head
[1:55:42] Wasing that's you for those you that
[1:55:45] never been the M country if you don't
[1:55:47] understand the do of Hermon and the D
[1:55:49] was such a precious thing to them it's
[1:55:51] actually part
[1:55:53] Heaven that God said he would give them
[1:55:55] the de of heaven we have all the time
[1:55:58] doesn't mean that much to us but
[1:56:00] remember that some places get an inch
[1:56:02] and a half rain in a year's time 2 in
[1:56:04] Rain 6 in in a whole year so for them to
[1:56:08] do was a great thing and God would allow
[1:56:10] the the way the saltwater would be able
[1:56:12] to rise from the Mediterranean and come
[1:56:15] in and it would be able to release it
[1:56:17] right now in Africa they've been able to
[1:56:19] develop a way to be able to get water
[1:56:21] even to the desert
[1:56:22] and Africa to where they catch ex scams
[1:56:26] and they will comeing in because as it
[1:56:27] comes over in the mountains and the sea
[1:56:29] water will come up it rises up and it's
[1:56:32] amazing how the Lord has a desination
[1:56:35] plan in the air and he will allow that
[1:56:37] salt water to come up be able to perform
[1:56:40] vapor and rise up and they have these
[1:56:42] nets that are hundreds and hundreds of
[1:56:44] meters long and they will catch it and
[1:56:46] the deceleration of this and the salt
[1:56:49] will absolutely leave outside the water
[1:56:51] and they run it down into little strains
[1:56:53] and it will drip drip drip just
[1:56:55] thousands and thousands of little
[1:56:56] strains and then they R it down into the
[1:56:58] reservoirs and there what the trial
[1:57:00] people will get the water and he had
[1:57:02] stood out there to wor that it was so
[1:57:05] long that his locks for dripping with
[1:57:10] the
[1:57:12] D my head sh is deep and my rocks of the
[1:57:16] Dos of night he pleases he
[1:57:20] pleas and
[1:57:23] and begs to be admitted even under the
[1:57:27] character of a PO W
[1:57:33] fa you know see I'm master I'm the Al
[1:57:37] I'm Omega but he relates himself as a
[1:57:47] stranger I found this very interesting
[1:57:49] in studying this it has been said he has
[1:57:52] not merely given us the ideal standard
[1:57:55] after which we are to seek but he has
[1:57:58] also preserved for us the humble
[1:58:01] patterns of those who have striven to
[1:58:05] reach the utmost Heights who have climed
[1:58:09] a good way towards it but who
[1:58:12] nevertheless have proved that though
[1:58:15] they were the best of men they were men
[1:58:20] at best
