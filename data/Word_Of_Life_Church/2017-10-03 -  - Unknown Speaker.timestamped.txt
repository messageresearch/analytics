[36:08] a whole lot it contains history contains
[36:11] wars and and i if you like wars and
[36:13] battles it contains that and but it can
[36:16] it's a it's also a love letter from God
[36:18] to us amen and the scripture says
[36:21] greater love hath no man that we read

[58:18] need of a man I want to be faithful amen
[58:22] and walk in that light as he is the
[58:24] light a man they told me back in the old
[58:27] days when they used to walk by ladder
[58:28] night but they couldn't get ahead of the
[58:31] line because if they got ahead of the
[58:33] light they would fall in a ditch
[58:35] hey man and then they got to lagging
[58:36] behind they would fall in the ditch but
[58:39] they had to stay right with the life I
[58:40] want to stay right with the life as he
[58:42] reveals like to me
[58:44] and be faithful and walk in that guy
[58:46] then he'll reveal more to me man
[58:53] hallelujah
[58:54] hey man he'll reveal to me as I have
[58:58] need of it again talking about the love
[59:04] letter cross the mystery 1963 said but
[59:11] God's great mystery what the eternal God
[59:14] had as a mystery how now been unfolded
[59:18] in Jesus Christ then was given out down
[59:21] to his church
[59:22] what was once in God's mind is now in
[59:25] the body of Christ
[59:27] hey man Jesus making love to the church
[59:33] his bride hallelujah I believe I'm a
[59:37] part of it
[59:37] amen me and brother Gary was talking
[59:40] coming up the road church this morning
[59:42] we're just talking you know like I said
[59:44] about this guy and I don't know how they
[59:46] think or how they operate
[59:48] amen because hey I've been in this just
[59:51] about practically all my life
[59:52] and I don't know how some of them
[59:53] operate and think I know I'll bet
[59:55] there's some Ginuwine out there that's a
[59:57] let's go maybe a little bit of something
[59:59] they man but I don't know but me and you
[1:00:01] we know what it is amen and we
[1:00:04] constantly think about these things
[1:00:06] amen and that's talking about to give up
[1:00:08] my dad said it's all - we made my wife

[1:00:13] Christmas and see everybody I don't know
[1:00:15] if you know me or not and you know
[1:00:17] sometimes I hate to go and face it you
[1:00:20] know in some way and if the Lord Saturn
[1:00:22] always is going to have to face
[1:00:23] something like that one these days
[1:00:25] unless we get out of here in a bar and
[1:00:27] that's what I'm hoping for
[1:00:28] that's what I'm trusting in God here
[1:00:30] that I can take my wife by the hand amen
[1:00:32] and we get out of here together in a
[1:00:34] body change but until then we've got to
[1:00:38] keep pressing but I don't know how they
[1:00:40] think
[1:00:40] but at night I think I said God if I
[1:00:43] miss it the scripture says if you
[1:00:47] couldn't handle it if you can keep up
[1:00:49] with those soldiers they meant what when
[1:00:51] the horses come amen

[1:01:01] make it in the tribulation oh god if you
[1:01:04] can't make it now how about it when the
[1:01:06] tribulation comes amen and I think about

[1:05:52] to be a wedding supper hallelujah
[1:05:55] hallelujah let's look at the engagement
[1:06:00] hey man we're Bream Sid on revelations
[1:06:05] chapter 4 part 1 1960 listen what he
[1:06:09] says and isn't that just exactly what
[1:06:12] they say today how could a bunch of holy
[1:06:14] rollers a bunch of people that can
[1:06:17] hardly write their own names how could
[1:06:20] they ever be the church how would a
[1:06:21] group like that ever be but that's just
[1:06:24] alright when we got engaged and felt
[1:06:26] that but the royal kiss of Jesus on our
[1:06:29] hearts to take away our sins
[1:06:31] something tells us he's coming back
[1:06:33] again amen and they sung that song he's
[1:06:35] coming back just like he said
[1:06:38] hey man he's coming back for me I got
[1:06:41] his ring oh hey man my god I've been
[1:06:44] engaged to him I've been but thrown to
[1:06:46] him a man and he's coming back you
[1:06:52] remember that story that the Prophet
[1:06:53] told about that man that came down from
[1:06:55] Chicago looking for a wife made a
[1:06:58] promise for the girl all she wasn't much
[1:07:01] to look at like the other girls were
[1:07:03] there but he found character in her a
[1:07:07] man and said I'm coming back in a year
[1:07:09] said I'm going to prepare a place and
[1:07:12] I'm gonna come back and receive you
[1:07:14] again hey man and that whole year they
[1:07:17] meant all they made fun of her but she
[1:07:19] took what she made and begin to make
[1:07:20] herself ready begin to prepare herself
[1:07:23] hey man when it was almost about the
[1:07:26] time for him to come all they begin to
[1:07:28] harass her they be getting to make all
[1:07:29] kinds of name-calling all kinds of names
[1:07:32] but she had the promise hey man we got a
[1:07:34] promise a man he said he's coming back
[1:07:37] just like he said he did 1963 a man he
[1:07:41] came back a man opened up to us the Word
[1:07:44] of God a man chose a bride a man with
[1:07:51] character that was like his character
[1:07:55] that's why Lanza went to that widow
[1:07:58] woman why because she was of the same
[1:08:00] caliber as Elijah was that's why he came
[1:08:04] to me and you this morning because he
[1:08:05] realized that menu was of the same
[1:08:07] caliber as Malachi 4 was a man thank you
[1:08:15] lord
[1:08:16] hey man hallelujah
[1:08:19] she begin to hear a man then wills of
[1:08:24] that wagon the horse is beating her a
[1:08:27] man on the ground a man she let out that
[1:08:30] door hey man come away with me well one

[1:08:42] I'm gonna be go hallelujah
[1:08:45] amen hallelujah thank you Lord again he
[1:08:53] says on oneness 1962 now the church now
[1:08:57] is engaged to cross for the wedding the
[1:09:00] wedding has never been performed yet
[1:09:02] it will be at the wedding supper
[1:09:06] Amen it said it will be at the wedding
[1:09:08] supper of the Lamb
[1:09:09] so you see the church is now engaged
[1:09:12] then you said the truth he said you see
[1:09:14] that the church is now engaged like a
[1:09:15] man engaged his wife what does he do
[1:09:18] while they're engaged he'd just be
[1:09:20] storing all kinds of things
[1:09:21] send her presents making her feel good
[1:09:24] well that's what Christ is doing to his
[1:09:26] church he's sending us gifts of the
[1:09:28] Spirit how can you be engaged then when
[1:09:30] you're denying these kids exist it's the
[1:09:32] very blood tokens it's God's token to
[1:09:35] the church jesus said so these signs
[1:09:37] shall follow them that believe
[1:09:39] amen it says love tokens to us so
[1:09:42] brother Charlie I want everything that
[1:09:43] God's got for me
[1:09:45] every little gift he's got for me I
[1:09:47] wanted a man that ain't gonna deny that
[1:09:50] I'm a man I want everyone that God's got
[1:09:53] for me man don't you a man he said
[1:09:58] wouldn't it be so awful for what for a
[1:10:00] lady to deny those gifts that that man
[1:10:03] that when she was engaged to that means
[1:10:05] you wouldn't want to be his wife hey man
[1:10:07] I don't want to deny her denounce any of
[1:10:09] them again in the same message he said
[1:10:14] again he said I'll keep those things in
[1:10:16] mind the church must believe every word
[1:10:18] every promise every iota and claim it
[1:10:21] for themselves I'm claiming every
[1:10:23] promise for myself this morning a man
[1:10:26] I'm claiming on Hill just morning hey
[1:10:29] man if you're sick claim it with me this
[1:10:31] morning

[1:10:36] Christian this morning I'm the bride
[1:10:38] across this morning

[1:10:42] hallelujah hey man everything I'm
[1:10:46] claiming it for me and exercises
[1:10:48] themselves in it hey man that's what I
[1:10:51] want to do exercise myself in it if I'm
[1:10:54] down this morning
[1:10:55] hey man I'm coming to the church with a
[1:10:57] smile on my face with a praise on my
[1:10:59] heart with a song on my lips and sing
[1:11:01] hard if nobody works with you I'm gonna
[1:11:03] worship ya then nobody wants to make
[1:11:05] love to you I'm gonna make love to you
[1:11:08] if nobody wants to talk to your Lord I'm
[1:11:10] gonna talk to you if nobody wants to
[1:11:12] worship your lord I want to worship you
[1:11:16] that's how you give the devil a black
[1:11:18] eye hey man raise your hands when you
[1:11:20] don't feel like raising your hands a man
[1:11:23] shot when you don't feel like shouting
[1:11:24] dance when you don't feel like dancing
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:31] hallelujah there's been a lot of times
[1:11:33] when I didn't feel like going to church
[1:11:35] my walk the other day she said David I
[1:11:38] got such an awful headache
[1:11:39] I said about I don't even feel like
[1:11:40] going hey man but she said you know what
[1:11:43] I'm gonna go anyway then man heaven came
[1:11:47] down hallelujah
[1:11:48] hey man when you've done you all the
[1:11:51] greater the sacrifice the greater the
[1:11:53] blessing
[1:11:54] hey man when you've done your best
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:58] hallelujah I want to give him my best
[1:12:01] hey man so he says the exercise if I was
[1:12:06] engaged a girl that was a single man I'd
[1:12:09] send her something an engagement ring
[1:12:10] she wouldn't wear it then that shows she
[1:12:12] doesn't believe me
[1:12:14] see see she doesn't want to be my bride
[1:12:17] but if Christ sends his church the gifts
[1:12:19] that he promised and they reduced him
[1:12:21] and they're not say they're not so they
[1:12:24] don't want to be the Bride of Christ
[1:12:25] they're exposed to some other lover and
[1:12:27] not to Christ oh this morning I don't
[1:12:30] want to be in smiles and some other
[1:12:31] lover but I want to be smiles to my
[1:12:33] husband amen and that's Christ the word
[1:12:37] for the hour and the day that we're
[1:12:39] living in amen he said it not to cross
[1:12:44] the broad room so the real church keeps
[1:12:46] the promise and keeps all in that sense
[1:12:49] the gifts that God sins he says all
[1:12:51] right
[1:12:52] hey man so now we're going to look at
[1:12:56] the marriage certificate and the wedding
[1:12:58] man hey man
[1:13:03] he said only invisible union of the
[1:13:05] bride 1965 they said no your old book is
[1:13:09] gone with your old Union now your name
[1:13:13] in your hole has been transferred
[1:13:17] now you say do you mean to tell me that
[1:13:20] my old but God put it in his sin
[1:13:22] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before

[1:13:33] God hey man I stand perfect before God
[1:13:39] you stand perfect before God amen

[1:14:19] store with him carts giving praise to
[1:14:21] God giving it to the way they feel felt
[1:14:23] hey man when Jack came to he was

[1:14:39] down there went down there she's got
[1:14:41] saved I can't live with her now and

[1:14:46] hey man under the blood perfect hey man
[1:14:52] hallelujah hey man he dropped it and it
[1:14:57] see if forgiveness never-to-be remember

[1:17:08] coming to the Lord
[1:17:10] 19:55 7 he said in those days they
[1:17:13] didn't have wedding rings
[1:17:14] they had a tablet they call it tablet
[1:17:16] they put on their head
[1:17:18] it had ten coins and it went all around
[1:17:21] their head and that was a sign there was
[1:17:23] a married woman and no man was to fool
[1:17:26] with them no boys was to flirt with them
[1:17:28] they were married each of those coins
[1:17:31] and we can only have time but I have it
[1:17:32] I'm gonna try to keep my word as close
[1:17:34] as possible I can't tell you what each
[1:17:36] one of those coins met it was placed in
[1:17:38] there and each coin met a certain virtue
[1:17:40] of that woman the first meaning her
[1:17:42] loved her husband second her pledge a
[1:17:44] virtue to live clean for him in the
[1:17:46] third and fourth and fifth on to the
[1:17:48] ninth and tenth he says it again if you
[1:17:51] want to look it up same message if you
[1:17:53] want to look it up look in Galatians
[1:17:54] five you found out that that woman
[1:17:56] represents the representative church and
[1:17:58] the church is its POW isn't it spout
[1:18:00] swap the Christ and the tablet that the
[1:18:02] church is supposed to where it's found
[1:18:03] in Galatians five which is love joy
[1:18:06] peace longsuffering goodness maintenance
[1:18:09] gentleness patience that is the tablet
[1:18:12] that's supposed to be war and the church

[1:18:51] Holy Ghost he sets you out in a separate
[1:18:54] place to yourself
[1:18:55] March you see you're a different person

[1:19:12] spiritual dress that counts the wedding
[1:19:14] garments been put on you what you are
[1:19:16] like Jesus
[1:19:21] well Guinea says the Seventh Seal 1963
[1:19:24] we can see the elements ready to bring
[1:19:27] it back we can see the elements ready to
[1:19:30] bring the church into the press
[1:19:32] to Christ we can see the bride taking on
[1:19:35] the form putting the wedding garment on
[1:19:37] making ready we can see the lots of
[1:19:38] fruit flickering we know we're at the
[1:19:40] end Oh brothers and sisters we see it
[1:19:44] we're at the end my friends now let's
[1:19:48] look at the marriage ceremony hey man
[1:19:52] he said now the next thing on the
[1:19:55] message question answers 1964 he said
[1:19:58] now the next thing is to happen here's
[1:20:00] the Jewish or the Gentile elect a bride
[1:20:01] to be caught up with the rest of the
[1:20:03] Gentile elected bride that's been down
[1:20:05] through the ages he called be caught up
[1:20:08] in the presence of Christ in the heavens
[1:20:10] but dead raises the ones that's alive
[1:20:13] and remain is change and they're caught
[1:20:14] up together air to meet the Lord then
[1:20:16] because and the wedding ceremony in
[1:20:19] glory geez after that has caught up into
[1:20:21] the skies Jesus returns on the earth and
[1:20:24] makes itself known just people in the
[1:20:25] top of the like Joseph made himself
[1:20:28] known to his brothers and his wife no
[1:20:30] Gentiles was present nobody but Joseph
[1:20:33] alone when he made himself known to his
[1:20:35] brethren I'll understand that now again
[1:20:39] Feast of the trumpets or they are the
[1:20:42] first seal excuse me
[1:20:43] 1963 he said he has taken a Gentile
[1:20:46] bride and would take her from here to
[1:20:48] the palace to his father's house in
[1:20:50] glory for the wedding supper and will
[1:20:52] slip back down and make itself known to
[1:20:54] his brethren the 144,000 see there he
[1:20:57] stands and remember look at the cymbals
[1:20:59] perfectly brothers and sisters were
[1:21:05] going somewhere anyway again he says on
[1:21:08] the rapture 1965 he said in the trumpet
[1:21:12] with the sound of the trumpet and when
[1:21:13] it does it could always a trumpet called
[1:21:15] is or to the feast of the trumpets II
[1:21:17] which was the Pentecostal feast the
[1:21:19] great feast in the sky and the feast of
[1:21:21] the trumpets and now trumpet announcer
[1:21:23] calling together calling to the feast
[1:21:25] and now the Lambs suffering the staff
[1:21:27] that sitting together in the bride the
[1:21:30] feast of the trumpets the wedding supper
[1:21:33] he's called us to a feast he's called us
[1:21:37] to a wedding supper
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:40] again he said on question answers 1964
[1:21:43] he said he said his wife in the palace
[1:21:45] that's the type the bride would be in
[1:21:47] the palace and glory at that time being
[1:21:49] Jesus makes itself known to the June see
[1:21:51] after the wedding ceremony but three and
[1:21:53] a half years and Jacob's trouble that
[1:21:55] three and a half years the end of the
[1:21:56] seventeen week of daniel than my size to
[1:21:58] be cut off in the midst of and he
[1:22:00] prophesied three and a half years and
[1:22:01] was cut off
[1:22:02] been there Serena half years left yet
[1:22:04] for the prophets Moses and Elijah and
[1:22:06] then at the end of that seventy days and
[1:22:08] yet determine is yet determined upon the
[1:22:10] people as Daniel said then at the end of
[1:22:12] the seventy days Jesus make itself known
[1:22:14] to them he's the Prince that should come
[1:22:17] to the Jews see again he says we take
[1:22:21] for instance of marriage for Union we
[1:22:23] find out that the marriage we find the
[1:22:24] courtship and agreements then the
[1:22:26] marriage that should settle it for all
[1:22:28] time now that that same thing is with
[1:22:30] Christ the church see a courtship dog
[1:22:33] call into her hearts which surrender the
[1:22:35] marriage ceremony and the bride takes

[1:30:28] three about almost three years ago me I
[1:30:30] was out in Tucson and Phoenix doing some
[1:30:33] services preaching and we got to go up
[1:30:35] to Flagstaff and up there and we got to
[1:30:38] go to the Grand Canyon
[1:30:39] you know just driving along all of a
[1:30:41] sudden what grandeur what splendor but
[1:30:45] you know what that's just nothing when
[1:30:47] we stand there and see that city oh how
[1:30:52] the prophets said at that time we should

[1:30:56] miles long oh my I mean you are there
[1:30:59] battle-scarred veterans hallelujah all
[1:31:03] we've been through the walk battle we've
[1:31:05] been through trouble we've been through
[1:31:06] difficulty but we're sitting at that

[1:31:12] King comes out and wipes the tears from
[1:31:14] our eyes said they'll cry no more it's
[1:31:17] all over thank you lord
[1:31:19] oh what a day that'll be what a day I'm
[1:31:23] looking forward to that day now a couple
[1:31:30] more things that were close let's look
[1:31:32] greater love listen what he said balm in
[1:31:38] Gilead 1959 he said in a good evening to
[1:31:43] all the servants of Christ present and
[1:31:45] in the radio land it's a privilege for
[1:31:48] me to come tonight speak into this fine
[1:31:50] audience and I've often wondered what I
[1:31:54] would do
[1:31:55] if I held in a charger cup a glass as
[1:32:00] we'd call it two drops
[1:32:03] he said just two drops of the little
[1:32:06] blood of the Lord Jesus he said how
[1:32:09] often he said I've often thought if I
[1:32:14] would be granted that privilege of
[1:32:15] packing two drops of the little blood of
[1:32:17] the Lord I thought my would that be a
[1:32:20] privilege
[1:32:20] he said just two drops in a cup he said
[1:32:25] I'd have a privilege I packing their
[1:32:29] little brother Lord he said how I would
[1:32:31] hold that to my heart walked so humbly
[1:32:34] and slowly and watching every step that
[1:32:37] I would not drop it or spill it in any
[1:32:39] way wouldn't you feel the same way if
[1:32:42] you just had two drops amen
[1:32:47] nation but then as I was thinking that
[1:32:50] tonight I have before me in the side the
[1:32:53] Lord a greater price than two drops of
[1:32:56] the little blood of our Lord I have the
[1:32:58] purchased of his blood hallelujah
[1:33:02] oh he said I wouldn't brother Bab he's
[1:33:05] an eye good if I could just put two
[1:33:07] drops
[1:33:08] he said I'll walk ever so slowly so
[1:33:11] humbly so I wouldn't spill it he said I
[1:33:13] was thinking that but tonight I got
[1:33:16] greater in front of me morning is the
[1:33:21] purchase of that blood oh what a love
[1:33:28] story listen he said I had the purchase
[1:33:33] of his blood his people that he gave his
[1:33:36] blood that his people might live so he
[1:33:40] thought more of his people oh you may be
[1:33:47] sitting here this morning
[1:33:48] he might say I'm just a nobody brother
[1:33:52] Donny don't know me brothers so do so
[1:33:55] don't know me brother David don't know
[1:33:56] me
[1:33:56] so-and-so don't know me I never got to
[1:33:59] shake the pastor's hand I never got to
[1:34:01] do this
[1:34:01] but listen so he thought more of his
[1:34:06] people
[1:34:07] then he did his own life so tonight or
[1:34:11] this morning whether you think you're
[1:34:12] nobody or if you think you're somebody
[1:34:14] he thinks more of you than he did his
[1:34:17] own life
[1:34:19] He gave His life that his people could
[1:34:22] leave us I hold this my audience tonight
[1:34:26] and the greatest respect because it's
[1:34:29] the purchase of his blood
[1:34:31] it's the purchase of the blood of the
[1:34:34] Lord hallelujah again question answers
[1:34:39] 1964 he said sometimes I may have to
[1:34:44] answer it may hurt it may scratch and I
[1:34:53] don't mean it to be that way I mention
[1:34:56] it with one purpose as I said Christ
[1:34:59] before me and I got to remember that
[1:35:01] it's him then I've got to get an account
[1:35:03] for so my first love is to him my second
[1:35:08] love is to you people
[1:35:09] and so his church that he's purchased
[1:35:13] with his own blood and he really loves
[1:35:16] you oh listen to this church you know
[1:35:22] the devil can get us the thing that
[1:35:23] Christ don't love us he's got us whipped
[1:35:27] but I just come to tell you this morning
[1:35:29] that we got the greatest love story of
[1:35:31] all and that pride God said them to drop
[1:35:34] sidewalk so carefully but I got the
[1:35:37] purchased of his blood before me and he
[1:35:41] said here he said I got to give an
[1:35:43] account he said my first love is to him
[1:35:45] my second love to you people
[1:35:47] and so his church that he's purchased
[1:35:50] with his own blood and he really loves
[1:35:53] you more than he loved his self because
[1:35:58] he gave his self for you your the
[1:36:01] purchased of his blood and I handle it
[1:36:06] just as careful and sincere as I know
[1:36:07] how but then in doing it some time you
[1:36:10] may think that was very rude remark I'm
[1:36:12] it's so blunt that I'm doing it with him
[1:36:14] in my mind to try to make the reverie
[1:36:16] buddy see that it just it must be this
[1:36:18] way it's not anything
[1:36:20] hurt or no more than just to make sure
[1:36:21] that the people gets it and I hope
[1:36:23] everybody receives it in that way and
[1:36:25] here we find out what is on our minds
[1:36:29] but he said he really loves you more
[1:36:31] than he loved his self because he gave
