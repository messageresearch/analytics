left this morning ain't you just listen to his heart beat out Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever may the Lord richly bless you the second Timothy chapter 2 verse 1 the Bible says this excuse me says therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also verse 3 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ for no man that warith entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier let us bow our heads this morning I want to speak to you just for a few minutes on chosen to be a soldier our Heavenly Father how in our hearts this morning we rejoiced Lord as we heard the pastor say Lord of the darkness upon the earth and yet you in your love for us has made a way of escape Lord and father in the human and our inability Lord can't even speak big words but yet Lord in my heart this morning it speaks what it feels to say to you Lord we love you and we adore you and we magnify your name Lord we asked this morning that you would take this feeble fault Lord and enrich it to the hearts of your children that they may take courage Lord for father we realize we are not here just play in church it's not something that we just do Lord as just a part of our life but Lord we believe this morning that it is our life Lord and we want to be about the father's business and we pray this morning Lord that your word would strike our hearts that we could take courage to take our position Lord for father if we are the body of Christ if Satan can get us dislocated the Lord I've seen in surgery when people come in with dislocated hips and and dislocated shoulders how painful it is they've still got a leg but it don't function and Oh Lord if the enemy can just get us off of our position Lord but God may each of us today find our place Lord and stand upon it Lord that great things could be done by your people for you said your word would not return unto you void bless brother Donny Lord and his family this ministry blessed the church or God may we be a great life shining here Lord in this valley may our sick be healed today may our weak be made strong me those who desire the Holy Ghost may you just drop it into their souls this morning Lord that when we leave the building may we say did not our hearts burn within us bless your people today Lord for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says I mean god bless you may be seated this morning chosen to be a soldier there is as we all well know this morning a war and this war is going on between two armies it is an army of darkness and it is an army of light and I want you to understand this morning that you have been chosen into this army of light to serve this wasn't a draft it wasn't just a random draft that God that you're your number came up and you was drafted nor did you have to register for selective service I want you to understand this morning that this may be a volunteers faith but what I'm talking about this morning it's not a volunteer army you didn't have north could you choose to be here you were chosen before the foundation of the world I want you to understand this morning you were chosen by God to be a soldier in the army of God Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit they should that your fruit should remain that whatsoever he shall ask the Father in my name it may be given to you this battle that we've been called to fight in it'sit's not just something that started last week it's been raging for years the brother said this great first battle that was ever fault it began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth in originating in heaven and then it was thrown down from Earth cast out of heaven to earth and fellow human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan has come to destroy the Bible said to defendant but for one purpose that's the kill and steal and to destroy so we understand that Satan has come to destroy God's creation he wants to destroy what God has created for himself that's what Satan's arm it's what he's come to do is to destroy this that's what his purpose was was destroy it the battle began here on earth and now it's even raging in US and the Prophet said it's been raised and ever since and our commander-in-chief I want you to understand he could have placed you in any part of the battle that he chose he can replace you in the battle for justification he could have placed you in the battle for sanctification he could have placed you in the battle for the restoration of the gifts but he chose to place you in this hour of great darkness he did not place here he chose you for this hour that you could be called to the frontlines now I know many times when we talk about war and we talked about battle sisters say well you know that's a man's thing that's got nothing to do with me this message has nothing to do me but I want you to understand anyone that's been in the Army realizes there's different divisions of the army they are soldiers who are called to be infantrymen they pack weapons they march with boots when I was in the Army I was in I always in artillery our job was to support those that fought with the rifles we thought with the big gun but not everybody fights out of the trench in an army even the Battlefront army they have cooks [Applause] amen but could studies play you can't fight real good on an empty stomach so you may not be called to be an apostle but you as a sister have been called chosen by God in his army to work in your kitchen [Applause] [Music] suppliers different transporters those different positions but the whole thing makes us a battlefront battle-hardened army amen God has called us to the frontlines for this last great assault on Satan's Kingdom I want you to understand this morning we've been called to do two things we've been called to build up our father's Kingdom but we've also been called to destroy Satan's Kingdom oh yeah I was born to tear down Satan's Kingdom hallelujah we've been called to tear his kingdom down how would you understand we are the Sham guards of today called by God to be restored back to battle for a rightful position as sons and daughters of God to possess ever redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died to secure for us we have been called to be what God had in his mind of us before the foundation of the world we have been called chosen in this hour to fulfill the prophetic word spoken by Malachi 4 for what is the father's business for us to identify 1732 indicate Malachi 4 5 and 6 good vindicate revelations t7 we've been put here to show the world that the minister william branham kaempffer god amen because we become what the Prophet said has a job that you're saying this morning when Mary said being unto me according to that word she realized I am the words of Isaiah made fresh hey man the message of Melaka for made flesh in me in this dark hour that were living in the hour of Satan's invasion the Prophet said her father while the great darkness is own and the battle and the devil invading the countries invading the pulpits you need to pray for the fivefold ministry hey man they're under attack fading the pulpits invading the churches invading the peoples invading the businesses invading the cities and the schools and the homes the prophecy oh god help us to stand and pull the sword quickly and fight for God's in that day of gross darkness listen to me that's not a day that's coming that's a day that's here now the father said the world will go insane that's not something that's going to happen that's happened now they lost their mind they don't even know what bathroom to use the world tell somebody you know it's the truth if you're counting on the Democrats you're in trouble if you're counting on the Republicans you're in trouble it's not Donald Trump I'm count no it's the Trump a man the sounding of the gospel that's proclaimed in this hour God said my word will not return to me void I don't care how dark he gets this message will be fulfilled stay a gross darkness in this our house said it would be if we didn't have prophetic words if we didn't know the future if we hadn't heard things that are to be the prophet said did that day of gross darkness that's this day the light will return the pure word and we will not could be not hope so we will we will return to the power of Pentecost - welcome back to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ so Satan be glad in you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former ring mortally and he will cause to come down for you the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all and I will I will restore to you the years that the locusts are eaten and the cankerworm and the caliper and the poly worm I will restore to you my great army hallelujah and God said I have chosen you for this great army boy - God what was the power of Pentecost what fueled Pentecost the Bible said when the day of Pentecost fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as the fire and it said upon each one of them ever a person that was gathering in the Assembly got the wrong lick a fireman I don't leave brother brems I don't need brother darkness I've got known what did Caleb say that day Kayla didn't say give me somebody else's Mountain give me something that's leftover but instead of their said enough of this nonsense a love for this negative talk gave all hallelujah give me my mouth Dinah man there's a liquor fire for you this morning there's a liquor fire for me this morning oh man they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as a Spirit gave them utterance the power of Pentecost is God in his people [Applause] what is the evening light what is the evening light it's not just the title of some of our message churches evening like tavern em it's not just a title what is the evening light it's God in his people God in his arm Ibrahim said let's talk about the Messiah the Messiah the Messiah the Messiah they are the light of the church today they are the light of the world jesus said to the disciples ye are the light of the world what is evening lighted you we are the light if we reflect the Messiah light the messiah signs follow the Messiah it's the same as they follow the Messiah Jesus said in Saint John 14 well fairly verily I say unto you the works I do sure you do also and greater works of this yeah you do because I go to the Father and I send back the lips of fire to make a mini bigger body a man that size the wonders will follow that buddy [Applause] we see in this hour two armies an army of darkness and an army of light Satan's army brings diseases a man that brings diseases when you're sick you're being affected by his army you're under attack by his own army my soldiers Satan's army brings diseases but all God's got an army and God's army is commissioned to cast their maltreatment every time Satan puts anything onto you God's army is to cast him out a man cast out that's the very tactic that God used Satan used the army of destruction to disbelieve God's Word and same up a better Kingdom then Michael had and God cast him out that's God's method is to cast out evil cast Bam's reasoning cast down superstition test them scariness just tell diseases toss down xi'an any man we're above it oh we live so beneath our privilege God has called us about these things he never said that we wouldn't be sick he never said we wouldn't be afflicted he never said we wouldn't be attacked but he said I have to missing you that when the attack comes fast it down amen we are an army the Christian Church is the army of God we are soldiers soldiers of the cross and I know many of your brothers here or soldiers in the natural you served our country thank you thank you for your service thank you for what you did thank you for going to war that we could still fly the flag and we could still stand here this morning had preached this word if you can read sake the teacher if you can read English thank a soldier [Applause] the most wonderful thing about this army is that God's army will never be defeated God's purpose can never be defeated my god hello Viki say you man if nothing like you know how to make you say Amen to know no matter how hard the battle rages no matter how much the bullets fly no matter how hard it gets no matter how much you sweat we will never be defeated we're not going down to Los Angeles it's going down but I'm not going down I've got my orders I've got a need vertical evacuation it's told her I'm sure hey man holiday when I was in the Army we had general as military amendment we had General Orders but we got a direct order from our commander for our option for the Jimmy hope you don't mind me telling this he was in Vietnam regime is in Vietnam he told me he was scheduled I guess to leave in a certain day but they let him out 30 days early or something like that and he was out there in the field and they came to him with this orders to go home he said he left everything let's refer you left everything let me tell you something we got orders for a rapture and when I go I'm leaving everything behind I'm not packing up to leave I'm unpacking a man I'm dropping my home I'm talking my shovel and man I'm laying my weapon down ain't gonna study War no more I probably said how happy we ought to be are you happy here let you face no it won't be such a hard time listen I'm not belittling it we all have hard times I know you don't believe it preachers do too but how happy we are to know that no matter how hard we don't lose nothing that can defeat purpose oh happy will to be known today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no pearls nor nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God is purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's immortal eternal plan it must be as God said we shall never be defeated no matter what takes place no matter what laws they pass in this country know how much they spew their hatred for just Christians they will never shut us up really sound never be defeated so that means we're just on a picnic you know no free from trials and tribulations in the hood no that's just the opposite you know God told Moses I've already given you the land as far as God was concerned that's why I told Moses why are you crying just speak the word I've done told you my mind concerning this anything that tries to stop you from getting to that land speak it out of the way I've done told you it's your land I have already given you the land why cry just speak the word and yet he told Joshua footsteps means possession you will fight for every inch of land every inch of ground that God's already gave you because God don't want no lazy video playing Christians [Applause] no he don't want no babies that's not in the Pampa business come on somebody I know you've got snot interesting baby powder he wants to dust your ass but it's not with baby powder it's with the anointing of the Holy Ghost your fight boys Paul told Timothy thou therefore endure the hardness endured the hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ that word into a hardness it means to suffer trouble to endure afflictions to be afflicted to suffer endure evils hardships troubles to be afflicted therefore thigh Bible reads it this way take Paul said take with me I'm not just telling you something that I'm not doing brother better didn't tell us to do something that he didn't do himself he led the way he showed us the way nice Peter said we follow in his footsteps crossing take with me take with me your share of hardship and suffering which you are called to endure that's a good first class soldier of Christ Jesus we're not on a picnic we're in a battlefield many people think when they just become a Christian well that's all I need to do you can just show up when I want to show up you know if I don't go Saturday night I won't go on Saturday night I'll just that's all I need to do it settles it forever the Christian everything's gonna be smooth sailin come on the ship of Zion was got a buffet and everything just the Prophet said don't never get that in your head for I become the Christian to fight and to fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get into the battle and when you gather that day around this table that won't be one spot or wrinkle but he said there will be stars scarred soldiers of the cross the men stood out there you know the Roman in the head the parade and the guy stood out there and all of them the shoes were sounding the brass was sounding look pleased with everything was just right and there's a guy sitting out there his eye was all cut out he stars all over his face he tried to salute but he couldn't his arm didn't work right he saw the man standing there he tried his best even though he was wounded even though he was scarred he still was in the ranks well he stopped the chest in you you're there where did you get those scars I got them in service for my king he said you you will ride with me today when I was in the army we had to work we worked in the what we called the motor pool we I was on a one five five Howard had like a chrome barrel we could shoot around the 21 miles on a max charge of a green bag a charge so we'd go out and be firing those those are the the condensation whatever the the barrels would rust so we'd have to go back when we come in from the field and we would take sand and we would take all and we would put it all over that barrel then we would take a rope and walk up and down that barrel getting the rust off of it so we're ready for the next fire mission hey don't go home lay your Bible up till next week be ready to fire one downrange at any time but I'll never forget was in the motor and when you did that that all you know come here would fly off you'd be covered in all and the captain came down we had a guy this guy did nothing you make a good Church remember somewhere I guess Oh his shoes you can see his stall the crease you could cut matter with it and he carried his handkerchief like this and the captain came down to the motor pool here we was covered in sand and all and here he was looking like he'd just come out of the dry cleaners and the captain gave him the day off because he looks at good you know I think that's the reason I got out of the army can I get an amen that's the way some people look at that Cup everything is just right in place but you know why cuz they ain't done nothing they never have to change their shirt after service [Applause] and I didn't come to be a spectator I come to be a participator that when I leave I want the devil to know I was here I want the devil to know I wanted to hear my voice I want to hear my man I wanted to hear my praise to God to fight the good fight of faith to be a chosen would be a soldier in the Army of God we're Christian soldiers you got to train to be brought up to know the techniques of the enemy how to fortify to know how to fight the fight I'm here to tell you this morning that's your current situation or your circumstance your current hardship your current trial may be a direct result of your placement in God's army because God will allow these things to mold us and shape us for the battle he wants to use us in I remember one time we was out in the field I was a 203 man I had a a grenade launcher a the name 16 you know I went to the rifle range brother Donnie tell you brother Daniel they've hunted with me no I went to the rifle range and fired off a few rounds and the drill sergeant Clem said you want to be the 203 man you're going to be the grenade launcher you'll have to be accurate you just have to be close so I turned it the whole town I was in the army I was a 203 man and I never forget one time the airforce boys come and pick this up brother use Air Force would they come and pick the stuff out of the field and put our guns up in the back of the c-130s I think this what they were anyway I was sitting there with my m16 in my 203 and this Air Force guy he looked at me he said what in the world is that and I thought my god I'm in the wrong branch of service but God allowed things to come into your life to train you for the 203 to train you for the m16 to train you for the one m198 the one five five pounder God will load you the way he wants to use you if God wants you to be a cook be the best cook if God wants you to be the supply man be the best supply man if God wants you to be a transporter try smart with everything within you but if God split you on the frontline fight with everything that is within you they men listen to me as the battle rages you become a real target the enemy has an arsenal of weapons he may try to keep you suppressed deep rest compressed or distressed but be encouraged in the midst of the fight be encouraged know that no matter what the devil throws at you remember what the Bible says the Bible says no weapon no weapon that's formed against me shall prosper hallelujah huh maybe a real target but I want the devil to know that we are real army we're not Boy Scouts were soldiers Satan's desire is for you his brother Donny preacher here a couple reasons not to go in his trophy room he won't your head in his trophy room he would love nothing more to take you down in battle and put your head on his wall I got this one with lust I got that one with this I got that one with that but I want the devil to know the bride that's got a trophy room also and we're gonna hang on a wall the devil of lust the devil of pride come on somebody the devil told me we're gonna burn my bow because when we leave here every devil will be under our feet [Applause] we already quit barmy God equips his army for the battle he's called them to fight the fees were 16 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of his mind but on the whole armour of God she may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil but we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may beliefs and the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and did he gives us one more weapon then I'm afraid we hardly ever really use verse 18 he gives us one weapon more praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit you see prayer is not a burden prayer is a weapon prayer is communication with your God the prophet of God said that prayer was more powerful than an atomic bomb they dropped the atomic bomb in Hiroshima - in World War two there were people you can look at the pictures they were people that disintegrated from the blast of that bomb the only thing left was the shadow on the sidewalk where they were standing and for years years children were born with 1012 fingers and 1 iron all kinds of birth defects born without brains born I'll console because of the effects of one bomb dropped on Hiroshima and the property God said your prayer is more powerful than an atomic bomb that a mother praying for her children long after she's gone and in the grave that prayer will suckle tear until that moment that it's needed a man some of y'all remember sister park god bless mr. Clark so oh you're talking about a warrior she was a warrior she was my Sunday school teacher when I was a little boy and I went to see her when she was sick went over the house me show after church one night I'll never forget what she told me hey my sister she was wonderful we've said that she said yeah it's what she'd always say yeah she said I prayed for you I always prayed for you so we just a little boy I seen that God had called you to preach she said even when you wasn't serving the Lord I pray for you he just made me cry out here when I was running up down the road like an idiot God for me you see prayer is not something that's one-sided I hate a conversation when you can never get a word in you know I'm talking back hey doing god bless you can see buddy I gotta go I never got say hello and that's the way we do God sometimes when I'm in a bit of a man jumping big the prayer it's not a checklist prayer is not a wish list it's a communication between you and the God who created you and you talk to God and then you give God a chance to talk back I know what I when I first started so loud I know it's silly but it wasn't silly at the time it was a real battle Satan attacked me that there was no God and I Restless I know there's a god but as wrassling it was so real I was actually my chest from grievin was physically sword I know it's silly thoughts silly I know it was it is now but it wasn't then it was a real battle I said god I know there's a god I know you're real if you would just speak to me and I opened the window and you know what I heard a bird a bird singing something said who do you reckon he's singing to it was gone it was gone Amen oh my what a man breaking the whole place prayer is a weapon notice there's no armor in the back because we are not to retreat we cannot flee from the devil because the word doesn't say that the word doesn't say we flee from the devil but what the word actually says is the devil flees from us there's no need to back up there's no need to turn around we're not the one that has to move he must move resist the devil and he will flee from you always moving forth endured hardship as a good soldier Paul said no man that Wars entangled himself in the affairs of life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier that war means to do military duty to be on active service to be a soldier to fight no servant soldier when it's service gets entangled in the inner prices of civilian life his aim is to satisfy and to please the one who enlisted him the one who chose him anybody it's everything and I know those brothers has been in the military once ever been enlisted in the military it's familiar with the term civilian life when a man is listed in the military you find yourself in basic training I know I'm gonna bring back some bad memories for some of you home but you see what you're in basic training though certain expectations are required of you the commander-in-chief expects you to put off the old man you're no longer to act like a civilian because civilian is non-military I was 17 year old in boot camp at Fort Sill Oklahoma and I remember that night they got us off the blessing me March they put us in line and took us into this building we had to start taking off her clothes and putting them in boxes to ship home and started giving us all the same uniform and then they marched us over they marched us over to the barber and they set this boy down you know he's one of these pretty boys at the barber said how do you want your hair son he said just take a little bit off the side and kind of block it across the back it is that no problem he filled a pocket onion Seuss story said didn't bother me I didn't have much to lose but here we were all recruits but they turned us into soldiers by being taught to endure hardness the hardness that we endured in basic made of soldiers the officers instilled into us the Army's concept of discipline and obedience we endured hours of drilling endless parades nowrap marches constant pressure tasteless food guard duty without sleep bullying my sergeants lectures exposure to inclement weather the whole procedure was designed to toughen us up to make us ready from battle the Roman soldiers of Paul's day were the toughest and most disciplined and the most efficient soldiers in the world and Paul in his mind was reminded of that when he told Timothy he was a soldier of Jesus Christ he had been chosen picked up by God and he needed to learn to endure the hardness that a good soldier does he does not quit because he faces difficulty tasks or dangerous situations he knows that his life is expendable many a man has gave his life for his brother but jesus said no man has laid his life down oh yeah many a good man died on the battlefield saving his fellow soldiers knowing she must be prepared to lay your life down when it's required brother it's a little man wife these two sing a song it thrilled me goes something like this forgive me Lord and try me one more time I'll be yours if you'll be behind if I follow if I fell let me rise and try again forgive me Lord and try me one more time and the Prophet said I like that for eating good soldiers apt to get wounded or they're apt to get hurt buddy still a soldier it's got a purpose of something to fight for he'll rise and try again any soldier of the Cross will do the same thing and I say to you this morning maybe you've been shell-shocked maybe something in your life a shell-shocked you and you've got amnesia that you don't know where you came from and you don't know where you're going but listen to the words of brothers also listen to Mary say being under me look back into the word and see that God chose you for this army god bless you in his army remember who you are you may be a wounded soldier but you're still God's property rasa rasa let's fight again knock the dust off let's go keep on the firing line don't act like a civilian you're a soldier well you're a soldier you don't come and go when you want to you don't show up when you won't - you got a post of duty you've got a responsibility stay your post don't get caught up in the affairs of this world you have a mission you're here for a purpose Paul's instruction series that were known not to get caught up in the things that's secondary to our mission not to entangle ourselves with the affairs of this life were Warren we must not be distracted from the battle who not like the world without of the world we're chosen by God to be soldiers don't never get so busy living life you forget what you're living for going to church should not be just a part of your life well I you know it's it's Sunday I guess I should go don't let don't do not let Church be a part of your life but let search be your life don't entangle yourself in the cares of this world enduring the hardships as a good soldier of the cross you see Paul knew what can I have just a few more minutes Paul knew what it meant to endure hardships he said I found a good fight I kept the faith I kept the faith I was imprisoned but I kept the faith I was changed but I kept the faith I was told I was hungry I was beaten but I kept the faith I was rejected but I kept the faith I was persecuted but I guess the faith I thought I was like that but I kept the faith I lost my job over one of the leads but I kept the faith I had great sorrow but I kept the faith I faced great trials but I kept my faith my wife's not change but I kept the faith I got sick but I kept the faith through the trial through the grief through the hardship I did not turn back I did not quit I tilt sighing the faith I never laid my weapon down stay focused my brother my sister only eyes your eyes on the goal of what we're marching to don't get tangled in the affairs of this world but keep your focus on pleasing him who has chosen you to be a soldier soldiers of the cross moving forward our aim our objective is to please him like enough who walked with God he moved forward as God moody not moved and the Bible said he was not because God took him that before his translation he had this testimony he pleased God how do we please God the Prophet said by keeping his word I was chosen to be a soldier I am what God says [Music] but brother I just don't feel that way never asked you how you felt he never said did you feel it he just said did you believe it how a chosen of God I am chosen of God to be a soldier that's what God says I am and I am what God says I am a chosen soldier how do you know because my daddy said so okay I'm gonna read something to you and if any part of this or what I read applies to you I want you to stand if this describes who you are I want you to stand if it describes what you are I want you to stand and acknowledge this is Who I am if you don't apply to you please don't stand don't just ankles are best answers but if it's something that I speak strikes your heart don't you

me around I cannot be discouraged enough to turn me aside I cannot lose enough to cause me to quit when Jesus called me into this army he equipped me to fight and gave me my marching orders no weapon formed against me will prosper I will win my god has and will continue to supply all my need I am more than a conquerer I will always triumph I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me the devil cannot defeat me people cannot delusion me whether cannot weary me sickness cannot stop me battles cannot beat me money cannot buy me governments cannot silence me and hail cannot handle me for I have a soldier chosen by God amen hello I am a soldier chosen by God even death cannot destroy me for women commander calls me from this battlefield he will promote me to his side I will be allowed

and the gates of Hell will not prevail against her but she shall prevail over them I am a soldier chosen by God an undefeatable army [Applause] the puppet said when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you're absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's easy because you see our commander in chief it's not given orders from a cloud he's given orders from you greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world I am a soldier here I stand this morning god bless his soldiers that's March own desire we're marching to Zion this barians oh god I am a soldier chosen by God I did not volunteer I was not randomly drafted but before that was over all you wrote my name on your role of your army I may not be a captain I may not be a lieutenant I mean I just make me us it doesn't matter what my right is I'm just happy Lord to be in your army because I never chose this you chose me I remember Lord when I was in the army driving by Happy Valley going back to Fort Bragg I would drive by this church every Sunday evening see the folks out in the parking lot Hovey spelled sad that's all them all never felt like who was in the part of that but I remember the Lord over towards North Wilkesboro listen an old rock and roll station on my radio the radio faded out brother branham faded and it started preaching all the way over towards winston-salem before it faded back out again Oh Lord he was wooing me calling me bringing me to the realization you do belong there those are your people but I find it's no disgrace they said the babe roof struck out more times than he hit homeruns yet he was the homerun King Oh God just let me be found swinging Lord let me just be found who've been with you hooker me nor this thing I read its folk to your children this morning may they take it with the Lord when the battles come may they realize it's just the hardship that makes us battle-scarred Warriors battle-hardened warriors for Lord any man will tell you that's ever been in combat when you're in a foxhole and the bullets are flying over your head you want somebody beside you that's been in battle before someone that knows that that whistle sound of that missile means it's going to miss you Oh God maybe not faint Lord make me labor and I will do it bless your children this morning God they see the battles God you will have these things that come in their life to modis to make us stronger to increase our faith the Lord made they take the sword of the word this morning but Satan's army brought diseases brought sorrow brought trouble upon their lives maybe they take the sword of the word this morning maybe they realized who they are that no weapon formed against them shall prosper and may they take it Lord it may be they say boo devil as the Prophet said the man had the dream and every time the devil said boo he jumped back and the devil got bigger and finally the man started saying boo back and he got smaller and smaller and the Prophet said him to dream the man took the word of God and beat him to death with it Oh God may we take the word this morning and drive it to the heart of our enemy may get off of our children may we be a sham guard today and stand up on our god-given rights as sons and daughters of God this is our inheritance this is what you gave us you said dear God that we can have joy you said you would above all that we would prosper and be in health God you said these things belong to us every get their blessing that Christ died for is ours may we be like Celgard today Lord and drive the enemy off of our property for we are soldiers granted today glory may we take these simple just a simple thought but Lord when the battle rages this week may they realize I cannot be balled out I will not be pushed out Oh God I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord granted today father a parades whatever heads bowed just a moment maybe you're a wounded soldier maybe you're shell-shocked my brother Ben talked about the soldiers that was on the train and they were taken into a sanitarium because they didn't know who they were they'd been battle shocked by the war of the shells and all and it caused them to have them neva they didn't know what to do with them so they had him on a train taking them to a to a sanatorium and they stopped at a whistle stop to kind of let the boy stretch their legs and the Prophet said this young boy got off the train they got the looking around got the rub in his face he started walking up over a hill and over another hill come upon an old cabin and an old man came out and said son they told me he was dead but I knew you'd come home to me and the father said right there in those familiar surroundings he came back to the reality of who he was maybe you've been battle shocked this morning maybe you've been in the battles raised if you've you've had so much trouble and you've had so much hardship and you went through so much that you feel like I just don't even know who I don't even know what my purpose is anymore but I say to you battle wounded soldier of the Cross looking through the manual of the word this morning look into what the word says that you are God has chose you in this army and you will not be defeated look in the familiar surroundings of what the prophets said we were where we come from and where we're going would you just say this morning Lord Lord take away my amnesia or take away my her die Lord I want to I want to pick up the weapon I want to fight again Lord I want to go back to the frontlines what have you just raised a hint of this morning say Lord I will who this soldier but I'm reporting for duty god you're able to take the wounds away or you're able Lord I report to you this for my commanding officer unless those hands are erased report for duty hood maybe you're here you've never realized that God has chosen you for this great thing maybe it's like me out there running up and down the road thinking it wasn't for you but something spoke to your heart this morning and you realize this is who I am this is what I am this is my purpose for being on the earth this is what I've been called his service for I wonder if he would just slip off that Oh civilian robe put your uniform on this morning pick up your weapon as we used to sing in the army pick up your weapon and follow me oh I wonder if you just raise your hand to say Lord I want to report for basic training take me lord save the world off of me the things of the world off of me let me be a real soldier bless you this morning Lord you see the hands go we surrender to you today Lord take each other's from the pulpit to the back door Lord behold the sword use the sword for this lack great bush to destroy Satan's Kingdom Greta Gordon received my brother my sister today my fellow soldiers Lord were a band of brothers who he need each other we will stick together we will fight together and we will reign together because we are the army of the Living God and no weapon formed against us shall prosper the gates of Hell will not prevail against us but we shall prevail over them granite today Lord for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says amen praise God do you love you today amen I'm a soldier I'm a soldier and your army of the Lord you better sing good I know well let's just think a little bit before we go can we amen go ahead [Music] [Music] I'm sold [Music] [Music] it is [Applause] soldier [Music] soldier [Music] so in [Music] [Applause] he's the Lord Jesus oh yeah we're not wonderful hey man hey you know I could have read those same quotes and read those same scriptures but I didn't have them same experiences to tell by what he had to tell or brother Terry or brother Daniel or brother JD and the rest of here that was in the military so I would have preached it with all of my heart and I would have believed it all in the heart but the experience is that he told the Houser and the most of you was like me you didn't know if that was the house or if it was 155 or 203 that meant nothing to me did it took most of you that was non-military well you see whenever non message folks coming here us preach something they [Music] and when we read the Bible and when we read the message we don't want to be detached from it right we want to know by experience when you're talking about the God of the Bible you're talking about my god you tell me that God in the message you're talking about my God because that's who I have an experience with him praise God thank you brother Darrell the Darrell had another sermon that he was telling me about that he was studying preparing for but his computer went haywire and crashed I mean I've had several of those events happen to me before that I studied in a certain direction and all of a sudden it just totally disappears off the screen and after you come to yourself and passing out then you saying what in the world I'm not going to preach but I've seen it so many times when everybody go this way or that will ever lint in cyberspace their sermons out there somewhere floating around wherever they went and then you go to regrouping and then you see the direction you know the Lord wanted so to me this is perfect was nothing probably every one of us need to get that thing that he was reading there at the end I'm a soldier all that and make it a part of who we are nearly every day of our life don't Lee hey man god bless you so much so enjoy the service today we're gonna pray again before we let you go we've got a one of our brother soldiers that's in the hospital today down in Georgia brother Randy gets a man who's been really sick very been gone through some real difficult times and sister Sharon had to take him into the hospital yesterday sodium really really low brought it up and he's doing better but they're gonna keep him again overnight tonight we want to just pray for our brother before we go anybody else with that something you'd like to just raise your hand lifers to pray for you before we go all right god bless you let's just hold these these needs and request in our hearts Heavenly Father how we thank you so much today for this great word Lord Jesus thank you for such encouraging wonderful things truly Lord for the most of us that have not been in the military we can only relate because of an uncle or someone else that we knew and the stories that they have told us and Lord our group of young people this week have journeyed to one of the concentration camps and then to Normandy maybe yesterday today or something like that and for a lot of them they had loved ones maybe that was there but yet fathers we hear these things today we've never been for the most part most of us been into the military service we're grateful for those who have but we're grateful father that we've been in the service of the Greek king for that's truly a better service than the Air Force the army the National Guard whatever more we're grateful for each of those it sacrificed but father we pray that you would help us that we can be able to do that I mean we realize Lord that we're not our own you chose us to be soldiers in the army of God so therefore we cannot quit we cannot turn back we cannot do as we wish we are your people father we pray for brother Randy today in the hospital Lord Jesus that should move for our brother in the name of Jesus while we're praying right now made the hand of God reach down and touch our brother there in the hospital in Georgia you see Lord what he's been going through and we're just asking you Father not for a touch but Lord for a complete deliverance father you say sister Sharon has been really difficult for her and Lord I'm asking you that should move for her as well today I'm sure Lord is family standing here they're certainly concerned about the situation we know that Satan may come against us his brother brother Daryl quoted it the Prophet told us that Satan's army put sickness on us but the army of God takes it off so in the name of Jesus we resent these demons that's attacking our brother may it leave him father Lord there was hundreds of hands a rep lifted father God that signified a need physical spiritual psychological financial whatever it might be in the name of Jesus these are your soldiers Lord our Father God help them to see today their rank is not really important it's not important where everybody knows them or not what's important is they're faithful in what you've called him to be help each of us men women boys girls preachers non preachers deacons non deacons head that's that doesn't matter as long as we're faithful to you and do everything that we can
