[0:28] e e
[1:01] will announce oh my the priest would
[1:04] announce so that everybody that's around
[1:07] him will know that this person is a
[1:10] leper now catch this he takes upon the
[1:13] name of a leper so he receives a name
[1:17] change and now he's going to be called
[1:21] by the disease that has inflicted his
[1:23] body he's going to be called by that
[1:25] disease he will live underneath that
[1:28] name he will walk underneath that name
[1:31] he will no longer be called friend
[1:33] because he is a leper he will no longer
[1:36] be called brother because he is a leper
[1:39] he's no longer dad he's no longer
[1:42] husband he's no longer Uncle because
[1:44] he's received a name change he is a
[1:48] leper he takes upon him the name of the
[1:51] leper and the leprosy changes their
[1:53] entire life he's removed from the camp
[1:56] he becomes contagious among the people
[1:59] to where wherever he goes it affects
[2:02] everything that is around him because he
[2:05] has leprosy that's the reason why that
[2:08] God sends Ministry in the last days to
[2:10] preach against sin to preach against
[2:12] unbelief because if leprosy starts in
[2:15] the church and it starts amongst the
[2:17] people it will not stop just with one or
[2:20] just with the other but it has the
[2:22] tendency to move from one to another to
[2:25] another so it must be pronounced over
[2:27] the entire congregation he he is a
[2:33] leper notice that he says this in verse
[2:36] 44 he is a leprous man he is unclean and
[2:41] the priest shall pronounce him utterly
[2:44] unclean his plague is in his head and
[2:48] the leper whom the plague is his clothes
[2:52] shall be rent his head bear he shall be
[2:56] put Upon A covering over his upper lip
[2:59] lip and he shall cry unclean I want you
[3:04] to catch this he's now going to take and
[3:07] he's going to Veil himself he's going to
[3:10] Veil his face he's going to Veil his
[3:14] lips and now he's going to actually
[3:17] change the way he talks now he's going
[3:20] to pronounce what the priest has already
[3:22] said he's going to tell them I'm unclean
[3:25] and in the days when the plague shall be
[3:27] in him he shall be defiled he is unclean
[3:31] he shall dwell
[3:33] alone without the camp shall be his
[3:38] habitation I want you to listen this he
[3:41] becomes separated from the camp because
[3:44] he is infected there's a separation that
[3:47] takes place because of leprosy can I say
[3:50] it like this there comes a Chasm between
[3:53] the leper and the priest between the
[3:56] leper and the congregation he is
[3:58] banished he is separated he has set
[4:01] aside he's placed outside the camp
[4:03] anybody hear me they are considered the
[4:06] lowest part of society they are
[4:08] considered to be the outcast nobody
[4:10] wants to be around them they are
[4:12] contaminated they don't have no
[4:14] Fellowship they ain't got no friends
[4:16] they don't feel no love they have no
[4:18] help you know why because they are
[4:21] lepers leprosy affects the nerves of the
[4:25] body he's unable to sense they can't
[4:29] feel feel right now and the longer they
[4:31] have it the more desensitized they
[4:34] become and their fingers are so broke
[4:36] open that they get injured so easy they
[4:39] can knock their finger wide open and
[4:41] they don't even realize that they're
[4:43] hurt it's because of the disease that is
[4:45] upon them they become desensitized they
[4:48] become unaware and the bacteria eats
[4:51] away at the body till they don't even
[4:53] look human no
[4:56] more they discharge a fluid
[5:00] oh listen their sores would ease with
[5:04] fluid and it would create a foul stench
[5:08] everywhere that they go their eyebrows
[5:10] would fall out their eyes become staring
[5:14] and red and their eyebrows as it falls
[5:16] out and their hair is gone you can
[5:18] imagine looking at one like this and
[5:21] then their voice will become so horse
[5:23] and my they would sound so raspy and
[5:26] that and their breath would just be
[5:27] wheezes because of the aome ations that
[5:30] was running up and now their vocal cords
[5:32] to where you can hear them wheezing and
[5:35] their hands and their feet they would
[5:37] ulcerate slowly they would suffer day in
[5:39] and day out until they become so listen
[5:42] so controlled by these these parts of
[5:45] their bodies that has been busted
[5:48] open they would live an average about
[5:51] nine years and at the end listen to me
[5:54] at the end is mental
[5:58] Decay at the end in they're not thinking
[6:00] right they slip into a coma they die
[6:04] early and the suffer becomes so
[6:06] repulsive he does not listen to me not
[6:09] only does he become repulsive to
[6:12] everybody that is around him he becomes
[6:14] repulsive to himself and as they are
[6:17] required to cover themselves because of
[6:19] their sores because of their wounds they
[6:22] would take and cover their face and
[6:24] whenever the leper went he had to give
[6:26] warning of what he is he had to give a
[6:29] warning of what his is he would tell
[6:31] everybody I'm unclean I'm unclean he
[6:34] would repeat the words of the priest
[6:37] Hallelujah he would say I'm unclean he
[6:40] would say it over and over again think
[6:43] about it he's identified by his speech
[6:46] he's identified by his confession he's
[6:48] identified by his profession his
[6:51] confession is I'm
[6:53] unclean he's identified by the way he
[6:56] talked he's identified by the way he
[6:58] walked he was ident ified by War he War
[7:01] they would take the garments think about
[7:03] they dress different than the rest of
[7:04] the congregation his confession is
[7:07] different than the rest of the
[7:08] congregation his clothes are
[7:12] different than the rest of the
[7:14] congregation his walk is different his
[7:17] speech is different the lover the leop
[7:19] would cover themselves they would make
[7:21] themselves a
[7:25] covering and he was
[7:27] identified where he lived at
[7:30] he could not live in homes he would live
[7:32] in the colony of the lepers around
[7:35] others that was just like him that's the
[7:38] law of the leper and I know today that
[7:42] is a terrible sight to be able to paint
[7:44] before a congregation it's a disgusting
[7:47] picture that someone whose life would
[7:50] become so contaminated to where their
[7:52] life would ooze and ooze everywhere they
[7:55] go and many times they would take and
[7:58] their life is such a stench oozing
[8:01] infecting everything they touch wherever
[8:04] their feet would walk they would infect
[8:05] where they would go and their face is
[8:07] unbearable to look at and that is the
[8:10] leper they're defiled by their
[8:12] actions if he drank from a vessel The
[8:16] Vessel was to be destroyed if he laid
[8:18] upon the bed the bed become unclean
[8:21] because whoever lays on the bed after a
[8:24] leopard they become unclean just like
[8:26] the leper Oh Glory if he touch the wall
[8:30] the house was unclean think about it
[8:32] wherever he went he tainted the
[8:35] atmosphere everywhere that he went and I
[8:37] know that's terrible but let me say this
[8:39] there's something far worse than natural
[8:41] leprosy and that is the leprosy of the
[8:44] Soul because that is exactly what every
[8:47] one of us was today no matter if you was
[8:50] raised in the message no matter if you
[8:52] cut your teeth on the back of a message
[8:53] Pew every one of us was born in that
[8:56] condition we was born contaminated we
[8:58] was born oooing everything we touch
[9:01] become contaminated our voice towed upon
[9:04] us our hands toed upon us we was
[9:06] desensitized by sin we was desensitized
[9:09] by the world every one of us was born
[9:12] lepers our eyes was polluted our ears
[9:15] was polluted our speech was
[9:18] polluted the songwriters sing it like
[9:21] this we was lost and undone without God
[9:25] or his son Our Lives produced an odor
[9:30] that was unbearable oh you see where I'm
[9:32] going it was unbearable in the presence
[9:34] of God It produced a stench that God
[9:37] could not stand we had this disease
[9:39] because we was defiled we was defiled by
[9:42] our actions and the words that we
[9:45] spoke and everywhere we went we was
[9:48] clining unclean by our lives everywhere
[9:52] we announced we're contagious you better
[9:55] get back you better get away we
[9:58] confessed our unclean
[9:59] we confessed our problems amen we
[10:02] confessed what we was we said we're
[10:04] alcoholics we said we was drug addicts
[10:06] we said we had all kind why is it it's
[10:08] because our voice told us that we was
[10:10] tainted with his
[10:14] leprosy the prophet said it like this
[10:16] leprosy symbolizes
[10:18] sin incurable listen where especially in
[10:23] its last stage so at the last stage of
[10:27] leprosy it's to totally uncurable again
[10:31] an influence leprosy represents it's a
[10:33] typ rather of sin and when a man won't
[10:36] stand correction by the
[10:41] word he's full of leprosy he blows up
[10:44] and Carries On Again the influence of
[10:47] another leprosy why I'd rather have
[10:50] leprosy any that kind of leprosy any
[10:52] time than that kind that's the leprosy
[10:55] of the Soul so when it comes to leprosy
[10:58] think about this
[10:59] when the scripture talks about this
[11:02] leprosy must be
[11:04] cleansed almost every time the scripture
[11:07] mentions it it talks about the cleansing
[11:10] of a leper it talks about the cleansing
[11:13] so in order for a leper to be cleansed
[11:16] he must come into the presence of the
[11:18] high
[11:21] priest Hallelujah I said he's got to
[11:24] come into the presence of the high
[11:26] priest and the high priest that
[11:28] confessed and said he was a leper the
[11:30] one that said he was unclean the law
[11:32] that pointed out what he was that same
[11:35] high priest amen has to confess that he
[11:38] is
[11:40] [Applause]
[11:42] clean do you realize there ain't no man
[11:45] can be saved unless he confesses that
[11:48] he's saved there's something about the
[11:50] words that comes out of your mouth you
[11:52] must confess there must be something
[11:54] that comes from the soul and the Very
[11:56] heart of a man that gives him the desire
[11:58] to be dead
[12:03] different leprosy has to be cleansed and
[12:07] when it comes to our
[12:09] sin when it come to your spiritual
[12:12] leprosy our sin could only be cleansed
[12:16] by the high
[12:17] priest there was only one thing that
[12:21] could loose us from the law of this
[12:23] leper and I want to tell you what it is
[12:26] it's the blood of Jesus Christ God
[12:29] accepted a substitute of the blood from
[12:32] the very beginning and that blood is
[12:34] just as powerful right now it's just as
[12:37] good right now as it was the day that he
[12:39] shed it 2,000 years come on somebody say
[12:42] Amen I'm talking about a perfect blood
[12:45] I'm talking about a blood that can lose
[12:47] a man I'm talking about a blood that can
[12:48] change a man I'm talking about a blood
[12:50] that can pick you up and take your
[12:52] defiled life and then stop up the oozi
[12:55] and stop the defilement
[13:02] so not only with the high priest which
[13:04] caused him to be banished and to be
[13:07] separated and placed outside the camp
[13:09] Not only would he be required to tell
[13:11] him that he would live in a Barren
[13:14] solitary empty place but I want to tell
[13:17] you not only did God say that there's a
[13:19] way to deal with it but God also to
[13:22] instituted a way to get
[13:24] back I said there's a way back I want to
[13:27] tell you tonight I don't care who you
[13:28] are are I don't care what you're dealing
[13:30] with I don't care what mistake you made
[13:33] I don't care how dark your life is there
[13:35] is a way back today there is a way back
[13:37] from leprosy there's a way back from
[13:39] oozing there's a way back from sin there
[13:42] is still a way back today I don't care
[13:44] how wretched you are I don't care how
[13:46] deed you are there is a way back for
[13:49] every believer there's a way that's been
[13:56] provided when a leper gets loosed
[14:00] it proves that there's a higher law that
[14:05] supersedes the law of the leper there's
[14:08] a l glory god institutes a way for a
[14:12] leper to get back now catch this and let
[14:15] me go this direction now remember when
[14:18] Moses had went down into
[14:21] Egypt he was there oh how can I paint
[14:24] him today he was there to set the
[14:27] captives free he was there for the
[14:30] purpose of Deliverance he's there to get
[14:33] man out of bondage he's there to be able
[14:36] to receive that which was already God
[14:38] and already belonged to God he's there
[14:40] to get them back he's there to lead them
[14:45] back but you see
[14:47] Moses went but it was more than Moses it
[14:52] was Christ in
[14:53] Moses now watch what God's going to do
[14:56] God was going to vindicate before phara
[14:59] that notice he's going to vindicate that
[15:02] the one is speaking to him is the one
[15:04] that's sent to bring deliverance and God
[15:07] is going to validate this Prophet before
[15:10] pharaoh and God tells Moses this is what
[15:12] I want you to do I want you to take your
[15:14] hand Moses and I want you to put it
[15:16] inside of your bosom and Moses takes his
[15:19] hand and he puts it in his bosom think
[15:21] about it friends he put it over his
[15:24] heart and when he put it over his bosom
[15:26] he pulled his hand out it's full of
[15:30] leprosy now watch not just leprosy
[15:33] leprosy in its last
[15:37] stages now you don't understand it's the
[15:39] worst that it can get it it's it's
[15:42] destined to die there's no way to get
[15:44] around it it is the last stages of
[15:46] leprosy and when he pulls his hands out
[15:49] he sees his hand is full of leprosy in
[15:52] the last
[15:54] stages and then God says Moses put your
[15:57] hand h Hallelujah put your hand back
[16:01] into your bosom and when he pulled it
[16:04] out the second time
[16:06] Hallelujah when he pulled it out the
[16:08] second time his hand was completely
[16:12] clean let me just tell you Moses's hand
[16:17] was originally
[16:20] [Applause]
[16:23] clean Moses's hand was originally clean
[16:27] but when he poured it out like your
[16:29] first birth and you come out notice it
[16:32] was defiled you had sin you had unbelief
[16:36] it was oooing it was bleeding it had
[16:38] leprosy in the last
[16:43] stages but then God said Moses put your
[16:46] hand Hallelujah put your hand back into
[16:49] your bosom Moses put it back where it
[16:51] originally was put it back where it
[16:53] belongs at put it back over your
[16:56] heart you see under our first birth we
[17:00] was all born the way Moses pulled his
[17:02] hand out the first time we was born in
[17:05] the last stages of leprosy we was all
[17:08] contaminated that's what our first birth
[17:11] did to us the law found us Guilty by the
[17:14] law of the leopard by our first birth we
[17:16] was found guilty because of
[17:21] leprosy but something happened I said
[17:25] something happened I'm preaching to you
[17:27] somebody Shout with me a minute I said
[17:29] something happened I want to say that
[17:31] ain't the end of the story that ain't
[17:33] the last thing God said that ain't the
[17:35] last thing God wanted but I want to tell
[17:37] you God said Moses take your hand put it
[17:40] back in there you take that right hand
[17:42] Moses put it back over your heart put it
[17:44] back over your bosom put it back in
[17:46] Christ put it back under the blood put
[17:48] it back in there put it back to the
[17:54] attribute Hallelujah so he put his hand
[17:59] back into his bosom and I want to tell
[18:01] you when you get born again when you get
[18:04] born again when you come in the second
[18:07] time by a new birth anybody believe that
[18:09] today we come back the original way that
[18:12] God intended for us to be we are
[18:14] completely unadulterated we are
[18:16] undefiled we are uncontaminated we are
[18:19] clean in the sight of God because
[18:21] Hallelujah because of our new birth he
[18:24] has changed us he has changed us he has
[18:27] changed you he's changed
[18:34] me our first birth represents the Law
[18:38] which we was bound by but your second
[18:41] birth represents Grace represents the
[18:44] power of the blood represents the power
[18:46] of
[18:47] atonement Grace has the ability to lose
[18:51] every
[18:52] leper
[18:54] Hallelujah and when I came back to the
[18:57] bosom of God I come back to where I come
[19:00] out of I come out initially unclean but
[19:04] that was not my original attribute that
[19:07] was not my original identity as a son I
[19:10] was not an originally a leper I was
[19:13] always a Son of God so he takes that
[19:15] clean hand put it in there Moses I want
[19:17] to let you know that's what every one of
[19:19] us
[19:23] was Paul says it like this for you are
[19:26] dead I'm talking about what happened
[19:28] happened to your leper for you are dead
[19:31] and your life
[19:37] Isam said Moses put his hand in his
[19:39] bosom it became leprosy like every man
[19:42] is to begin with a sinner by Nature
[19:45] there's no way around it you're born in
[19:47] sin shape into iniquity you come to this
[19:49] world speaking
[19:51] lies but then there is another
[19:59] God said put your hand into your bosom
[20:01] listen to him over your heart he put his
[20:03] hands again at the at the commission of
[20:07] God where he was brought forth
[20:11] firsthand a leper and brother says you
[20:14] were brought forth by
[20:19] God now read this next part not by but
[20:24] by Nature so by Nature think about
[20:28] underneath the humanity part it was not
[20:30] by choice that we was born lepers it was
[20:33] by Natures because of the law that man
[20:36] was born under after the fall in the
[20:38] Garden of Eden every one of us was born
[20:43] contaminated but then he says then you
[20:46] go back
[20:48] again when he come
[20:50] out you may not even be able to say Amen
[20:53] to this but I'm going to say it anyway
[20:55] the hand was clean and
[21:07] and I want to tell you if you didn't
[21:10] have a choice the way you come out of
[21:11] the bosom the first time what makes you
[21:14] think you got a choice when it comes out
[21:16] of the bosom of God by a supernatural
[21:18] birth of the word by the pull of the
[21:20] spirit of God upon you listen friend
[21:22] it's not something you chose it's not
[21:24] something I chose it's a Divine Oracle
[21:27] of God as a attribute son Hallelujah
[21:30] that God seen you originally as an
[21:33] attribute of God you didn't even have a
[21:41] choice again why it had to be Shepherds
[21:43] now here he stands holding his right
[21:48] hand over his heart standing like
[21:55] this where the hidden secret
[21:59] of
[22:06] Redemption where the S hidden secrets of
[22:10] redemption had been hid since the
[22:12] foundation of the world listen what he
[22:14] says Jesus is God's right
[22:19] hand take your right hand Moses I don't
[22:23] want you to put it back in there again
[22:25] take your right hand of power this time
[22:27] take your Authority Moes Jesus is God's
[22:30] right hand we all know there Moses
[22:32] betrayed him exactly he held the secrets
[22:35] of the father and he has showed them
[22:38] unto
[22:39] us don't you see you was hidden in the
[22:43] bosom of God and his hand listen to me
[22:47] his hand had to pull you out his hand
[22:50] had to reach into the secret part of the
[22:53] word oh my the mystery that was in his
[22:55] mind before the foundation well and he
[22:57] pushed oh my all the way past your
[22:59] leprosy past all the defilement and he
[23:02] reached in
[23:04] [Music]
[23:05] there and he pulled you out I said the
[23:09] right hand pull me
[23:14] out Hallelujah I said the right hand
[23:17] pull me out how about you did he pull
[23:20] you out you couldn't pull yourself out
[23:22] you didn't have the ability to pull
[23:24] yourself out but the right hand of God
[23:26] Amen he reached back into the very
[23:28] Eternal mind of God and he pulled you
[23:36] out which tells us our origination as an
[23:41] attribute was not something you
[23:44] become it's something you always
[23:51] was come on this is a debate people have
[23:54] right here well don't you tell me that
[23:56] Brother David I know I know I'm a Son of
[23:59] God made me a Son of God I know he made
[24:01] me a Son of God because he gave me the
[24:03] holy ghost that ain't true on come on
[24:07] God didn't give you the Holy Ghost to
[24:08] make you a Son of God God gave you the
[24:11] Holy Ghost because you always was a Son
[24:14] of God it's not God changing what you

[32:07] little
[32:09] while and the Lord spake un Moses saying
[32:13] this is going to be the law of the leper
[32:15] and the days of cleansing now watch us
[32:17] go up he shall be brought into the
[32:21] priest and the
[32:23] priest shall go
[32:25] forth out of the camp
[32:29] are you hearing me in other words he
[32:32] knew you couldn't get to where he was
[32:34] because you was too dirty he was too
[32:37] defiled he was too unclean so I want to
[32:40] tell you what he did he left the camp I
[32:42] said he condescended from the camp and
[32:44] he came all the ways he stretched his
[32:46] tent all the way from Heaven down to
[32:48] earth and what did he do he come forth
[32:50] out of the camp and the priest shall
[32:53] look and behold if the plague of leprosy
[32:55] be healed in the leper then shall shall
[32:58] the priest listen to this then shall the
[33:01] priest
[33:03] command go ahead and say it take for him
[33:06] to be cleansed two birds of Life Cedar
[33:09] scarlet and some faith and the priest
[33:13] shall command that one of the birds be
[33:14] killed in an earth and vessel over the
[33:17] spirit running water not stagnant not
[33:21] dead church not a dead move not a move
[33:24] of yesterday but running water God don't
[33:27] like stagnant anything he don't like
[33:29] stagnant ponds he don't like stagnant
[33:31] systems he don't like stagnant Wells he
[33:33] don't like stagnant
[33:35] churches everything that God has has got
[33:38] some movement to it aren't you glad that
[33:39] he does and I want to tell you they may
[33:41] try to take our message and try to will
[33:44] it down to just some type of emotional
[33:45] workup but I want to tell you before
[33:47] they ever said it I already had this I
[33:50] already had a joy in my soul I already
[33:52] had a dance in my step this ain't
[33:54] something new to me we've been doing
[33:56] this since the pillar of Fire came and
[33:58] tabernacled himself inside of our so
[34:01] this ain't something new it's been going
[34:03] on for years you may not have been do it
[34:05] but I
[34:12] have as for the living bir and and
[34:16] amazing people try well this is some
[34:17] great new move are you kidding this is
[34:18] the oldest move there ever has
[34:20] [Applause]
[34:22] been the bride didn't start
[34:25] this Aus stre didn't start this
[34:28] neither did the day of Pentecost start
[34:30] this but remember God asked Joe where
[34:33] was you when the morning Stars s
[34:35] together and all the sons of God shouted
[34:38] for Joy this is the oldest religion of
[34:41] the world let me tell you that's what I
[34:43] was in the bosom of God I was an
[34:45] attribute rejoicing about my salvation
[34:47] in Jesus Christ this is the oldest
[34:49] religion in the world
[35:01] as for the living bird
[35:03] bride
[35:05] believer
[35:07] Saint he shall take it and the cedar the
[35:10] Scarlet the hisop shall dip them in the
[35:13] living bird in the blood in the blood of
[35:18] the bird that was
[35:19] killed verse seven he shall sprinkle
[35:23] upon him that is to be cleansed from
[35:26] leprosy seven times
[35:29] com listen to this and when he
[35:32] pronounces him he's going to say
[35:35] something opposite than what he said
[35:37] when he found you
[35:40] guilty but if he can declare me
[35:44] unclean if something else happens he can
[35:47] declare me righteous in the sight of God
[35:50] come on what is righteous the state of
[35:51] him is he is as he ought to be he shall
[35:54] pronounce him pronounce him
[35:59] clean and shall set the living bird
[36:02] loose think about it now there's a new
[36:05] confession and there's some new speech
[36:08] there's a further revelation of the word
[36:11] one bird pays the price the other bird
[36:13] gets Loos one bird suffers one Bird Goes
[36:16] free one bird sheds the blood the other
[36:18] one receives the
[36:22] blood and after he receives the blood he
[36:25] don't sit on a Pew he don't get stagnant
[36:28] but he starts putting that word together
[36:30] and he has the mechanics but now he
[36:32] needs the Dynamics and the Bible says
[36:34] that bird would fly away he would take
[36:37] him to an open field and they would
[36:39] loose that bird and that bird would take
[36:41] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[36:43] he would go to putting those wings into
[36:45] action and everywhere he went the blood
[36:47] amen the same way that the defilement of
[36:50] leprosy would Ooze from his body now the
[36:52] blood the blood's dripping from his
[36:54] wings dripping from his beak dripping
[36:57] from his tow
[36:58] [Applause]
[37:01] one bird pays the price the other bird
[37:04] gets
[37:05] loosed can you imagine that
[37:08] leper former
[37:13] leper amen he would look up at that bird
[37:17] flying across that field and he would
[37:20] realize it's because of the
[37:24] blood do you realize I'm free because of
[37:28] the blood of
[37:29] another outside the camp our Lord was
[37:33] sacrificed and that blood opened up a
[37:36] doorway it made a way because of his
[37:38] right hand listen to me that blood that
[37:40] we have received I'm not just talking
[37:43] about a
[37:46] covering I'm not just talking about
[37:48] being covered by The
[37:49] Blood come
[37:52] on but I want to tell you that's Church
[37:54] age mentality
[37:58] Luther preached covered Wesley preached
[38:01] covered Pentecost taught covered but
[38:04] this message did not just preach
[38:08] covered preach with me somebody I don't
[38:11] want to do away with our old songs
[38:12] covered by the blood but I want to tell
[38:14] you needed more than just being covered
[38:16] we needed more than just a covering this
[38:19] message come oh my to give us the
[38:21] intricate details of what the blood has
[38:24] done to the soul of a man that has come
[38:26] under the blood of the Covenant it's
[38:28] giving him a new confession it's giving
[38:31] him a brand new
[38:36] identity God hiding himself simplic to
[38:38] the breach if I got a red spot on my
[38:40] hand and I cover it with
[38:44] white the red spot's still there is it
[38:47] not well brother I can't see it that
[38:49] don't mean it ain't there come on I said
[38:53] the flesh has a way of covering things
[38:55] up people's got a way of covering things
[38:57] up we can look righteous we can dress
[38:59] righteous we can have long hair we can
[39:01] all have necklaces and earrings and all
[39:03] that but I want to tell you it's got to
[39:05] be more than just a covering it's got to
[39:08] be more than just putting it on on the
[39:09] outside young lady it's got to be more
[39:12] than a long dress there must be more
[39:14] than just a cover there must be a
[39:16] working of that blood inside of your
[39:18] heart Hallelujah that changes your very
[39:26] nature I got red spot on my hand and
[39:28] covered why red spot's still there it's
[39:30] still
[39:31] there but God sent down from
[39:37] heaven a
[39:41] bleach so from the very Heart Of God he
[39:45] sends down a bleach for sin it was the
[39:49] blood of his own son that when our
[39:51] confessed
[39:53] sins drops into God's bleach
[40:00] not just cover
[40:02] it try to find it again listen what he
[40:06] says watch this past Church age
[40:09] mentality the coloring of sin goes back
[40:13] through the
[40:15] mediators down through the time until it
[40:19] hits the accuser Satan and it lays on
[40:22] him till the day of
[40:25] judgment Luther never preached that
[40:28] Wesley never preached that Asuza never
[40:31] preached that but under the son of man
[40:33] Ministry Son of God son of man under the
[40:36] son of man Ministry think about he's
[40:38] letting us know what the power of the
[40:40] blood has done that it's taken your sin
[40:43] and it takes it away from you and it
[40:46] puts it back on your accuser and it lays
[40:48] on
[40:53] him the blood does not just cover sins
[40:57] it literally changes the molecular
[41:02] structure it changes the molecule it
[41:05] changes the fragments and it gets laid
[41:08] back upon the Devil and Satan will pay
[41:11] for the origination of the law that
[41:14] caused the fall in the
[41:17] beginning but brother what you don't
[41:19] understand is I did this and I did that
[41:21] and I ask you what are you talking about
[41:27] how many times do we tell God the Lord I
[41:29] know I did this and Lord I did that and
[41:31] whenever you confess that sin and put it
[41:33] in the bleach of his blood it leaves the
[41:35] very Mind Of
[41:38] God sin that's been confessed don't
[41:42] belong to you no
[41:43] more that was the leper that died it's
[41:47] not yours it's your adversaries and it
[41:50] it's put back upon him listen for it is
[41:53] imperative that we catch this today you
[41:56] must recognize listen to me you must
[41:59] recognize what the blood's done for you
[42:02] if you don't Satan will run you around
[42:04] the stump he'll beat you over the head
[42:06] with your feelings he'll show you every
[42:07] mistake if you don't have a revelation
[42:09] of the blood I want to tell you you're
[42:11] missing a real piece of
[42:14] [Applause]
[42:16] God and if you know what the blood does
[42:19] when Satan brings it up you can say what
[42:21] are you talking
[42:25] about Brother David I feel like a HP no
[42:27] I'm not speaking from flesh I'm speaking
[42:30] from attribute son amen amen I'm not
[42:34] talking about that old leer that died
[42:36] that leper that lose I'm talking about a
[42:37] new identity by the blood that changed
[42:39] me and born me
[42:43] [Music]
[42:45] again it's not being hid in the
[42:48] blood but the blood is a
[42:50] bleach are you hearing me the blood is a
[42:54] bleach I hear Brother Ram say this
[42:58] and I thought it's the bleach of God's
[43:00] blood and I thought wonder what the
[43:03] definition of bleach even is so I
[43:06] thought I'd bring it
[43:07] today you see
[43:09] bleach is a
[43:11] chemical that literally changes the
[43:14] molecular structure of a
[43:19] stain I'm not sure how I'm going to act
[43:22] from this time on
[43:27] look at this bleach works by releasing
[43:32] oxygen
[43:33] molecules in a process called
[43:37] oxidation the oxygen molecules released
[43:41] by bleach break up the chemical
[43:47] wow it breaks up the chemical bonds of
[43:51] the chroma
[43:52] Force so what's what bleach does it
[43:56] produces es a
[43:58] process
[43:59] Hallelujah it produces a process by a
[44:03] chemical that literally breaks up the
[44:10] bonds the change chromophor molecules
[44:14] either reflect no color or color outside
[44:18] the visible
[44:21] spectrum hang on your chairs sunlight
[44:33] amen works like a bleach so if I'm
[44:37] getting this right if you lay in the
[44:40] presence of the sun long
[44:43] enough I said if you lay in the presence
[44:46] of the sun long enough it'll take every
[44:49] stain it'll take every FR chromophor
[44:52] it'll take every molecule because the
[44:54] sun works like a bleach what's the bride
[44:57] doing she's laying in the presence of
[45:00] the son and he's rening her to a place
[45:03] of maturity and literally dissects the
[45:07] very
[45:11] chromophor
[45:16] GL
[45:19] Hallelujah
[45:21] Glory I said Glory
[45:27] go ahead and preach to us brother
[45:29] [Applause]
[45:32] Webster under
[45:34] whing chemical
[45:36] bleaches work in one of two
[45:38] ways an oxidizing
[45:42] bleach it works by breaking the chemical
[45:45] bonds that make up the chromophor listen
[45:46] to this this
[45:51] changes the
[45:52] molecule into a different substance
[45:58] [Applause]
[46:01] I said it breaks it in a complete
[46:03] different substance it don't look the
[46:05] same it don't smell the same it don't
[46:08] ooze the same it don't walk the same it
[46:10] don't talk the same it don't confess the
[46:12] same it's a total different substance
[46:15] alog
[46:18] together go ahead and set the I'll
[46:20] preach I want to tell you that's what
[46:22] the blood can do for a man it can take
[46:24] you and change every bar that Satan M
[46:27] you with every molecule every fragment
[46:29] it can change you and release you into a
[46:32] total different
[46:41] substance a reducing
[46:45] bleach a reducing
[46:48] bleach
[46:50] works by converting
[47:02] I wonder what happened to you when you
[47:03] went to the
[47:07] altar you went there as an ugly nasty
[47:09] grass stain of the
[47:11] Earth but when you got
[47:14] up there was a
[47:17] conversion reducing bleach spots
[47:20] converting multiple sins I mean
[47:23] Bonds in the chroma for into single Bond
[47:27] so it goes from being many and it
[47:30] transfers them over into
[47:34] one can't make this
[47:40] up sunlight
[47:42] Hallelujah sunlight acts as a
[47:46] bleach through a process leading to
[47:49] similar
[47:50] results High Energy Services I mean
[47:53] photons
[48:00] feel like some of that energy is Flowing
[48:02] right
[48:03] now high energy photons of
[48:07] light often in violent in
[48:12] in and
[48:16] UltraViolet we may
[48:19] SPF to make sure we don't get burnt by
[48:22] this natural Sun but spiritually God
[48:26] don't want you put nothing between you
[48:27] and
[48:30] him listen friends we're not living the
[48:33] age of spiritual
[48:34] sunblock I said let it let it shine in
[48:37] the fullness of its power let it shine
[48:40] on me Let It Shine On My Face Let It

[48:53] shine on us
[49:00] high energy photons of light often in
[49:02] the Violet in the ultraviolet range it
[49:05] can disrupt the bonds in the chromophor
[49:09] don't Satan hate when that happens he's
[49:12] got a trick and a trap lay right for you
[49:14] and about the time you're going to step
[49:16] into it he's going to pull it right out
[49:17] of underneath your feet and he's walking
[49:19] through there about that time the light
[49:20] hits you and you walk right over it
[49:28] listen what he does it literally changes
[49:31] you it disrupts the bonds and the chrom
[49:34] for rendering the resulting
[49:38] substance rendering you
[49:48] colorless everybody buckle up make sure
[49:50] you got your fix it in
[49:54] in here's my last announcement
[49:57] today extended exposure of the
[50:01] sun often leads to massive discoloration
[50:06] reducing the colors to
[50:10] white though your sins be a Scarlet
[50:14] though your sins be a Scarlet they shall
[50:17] be they shall be they shall be white as
[50:23] snow

[50:37] Hallelujah in the presence of God the L
[50:40] lepers has been loose from the bonds of
[50:44] sin loose some corruption lose some
[50:49] defilement
[50:51] loose the breach he says and what
[50:54] happens to the son he becomes perfect in
[50:59] fellowship with the
[51:01] father
[51:03] again
[51:05] again again standing on the other side
[51:08] of the chasm with no remembrance of sin
[51:11] against him there's no more stain of
[51:15] bleach can be seen anywhere he's free
[51:18] Hallelujah just as that ink can never be
[51:22] ink no more it's because it's broke up
[51:26] and sent
[51:28] back and when a confessed sin is
[51:30] confessed and been dipped into a man or
[51:33] woman that's been dipped into the blood
[51:35] of Jesus Christ it kills all
[51:38] symptoms every molecule of sin you know
[51:42] what kind of damage you would do to hell
[51:44] if that would hit you right now and you
[51:46] will recognize what this blood has done
