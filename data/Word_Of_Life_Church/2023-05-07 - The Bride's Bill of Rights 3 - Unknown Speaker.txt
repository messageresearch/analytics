Matthew chapter 18. okay step in office and get iPad 2. I've actually got three I've got two iPads and I've got it on my phone so we're ready yeah y'all ready y'all good I'm good too well I decided to come back up again Matthew 18 18. go ahead and bring it on out very early I'll say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven and again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching what anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven amen amen James 5 16. confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man this is more than saying a prayer it's a fervent effectual something burning within you the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail us much First John 3 21. beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God listen this now whatsoever we ask we receive of him now notice this because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing and his side let me believe that all those scriptures all right let's just hold our needs our requests and our heart today as we go before the Lord also got a prayer calls here for sister Joanne tessaway so I want to remember our sister how many has any desire request in your heart today heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the earth Lord from once our bodies came and unless we're changed they'll go back that same way but how grateful we are to know today that we are more than just mortal men and women boys and girls standing in this place today but we have been touched by eternal life Heavenly Father we have read what we believe to be your infallible words Lord Jesus we bring our needs our requests our desires our petitions before you asking you Lord God that you would move or those that are sick those that are weary those that are needy Lord this Prayer cross that I have in my hand for sister Joanne how we miss our Lord we just miss her Lord she's not been the same since she had that surgery and Lord it just caused so many different things about no life but we're asking you today in the name of Jesus move for our sister father as a body we ask you and we agree together touch her today Heavenly Father all the needs of your people help me that I can get out of the way father that you can speak through me the words of life granted Lord God amen amen God bless you you may be seated I'd like to speak to you again today if you don't mind on the bride's Bill of Rights I know I've read this to you but I want to read it again the Bill of Rights guarantees the liberty of the individual and Limits The Power of government in judicial and other proceedings the U.S Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and guarantees among many other things the rights of free speech freedom of religion and trial by jury our founding fathers must have deemed it very very needy that after they developed the constitution of our great nation that they felt something was left out and they needed to clarify and make it clear that people would know themselves and the government would know that we needed these rights there's many rights of course it's been added since then many of you have heard about the Miranda Rights you all know what the Miranda rights are it was given of course a decision made by the Supreme Court I think it was 1966 and it is whenever you are arrested that a police officer will tell you you have the right to remain silent if you say anything it can and will begin used against you you have a right to an attorney if you cannot afford an attorney the court will appoint for your attorney named after a man of course whose last name was Miranda and it's something that has been instituted and our nation to protect so if God wanted to give his people rights you know what that speaks to me that speaks to me that he knew we was going to need them he ain't going to get them to us just to so it'd sound pretty and nice if I need rights I'm going to need them and if I'm going to need them I guess I need to understand what I'm going to need them for and I need to know what they are and I need to know how to apply whenever I'm in real need so the majority of us more than likable never even need to understand our Bill of Rights as American citizens of course the way our country's going in the direction it's gone you never know anymore do you we never thought we'd be where we are right now and who knows if the Lord tarries for a couple of more years where it will be that they will start and we know that the prophet tells us that there will come a press and they will try to shut us down and all that sort of thing but then he also tells us in Christ the minister of God revealed they'll never shudder up shall be taken up so how that's going to work I don't know but if need be then I think we need to know our Bill of Rights but one thing I do know for sure as Christians as children of God I think the Lord wants us to know what is rightfully ours as Believers can anybody say Amen to that so as the people of God there are things that are given to us some of them come automatically some of them do not now now the attribute of righteousness which is right standing with God it's something that comes by faith of accepting the atonement of what he did for us the Perfection I heard brother Joe talking about the other night to the youth and he was talking about perfection it just struck me again about the two aspects of perfection and one of them is the tiskanu which is the Perfection which is given to us by accepting the appropriation of the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus but then there is another word that is used in the New Testament perfect Perfection which is to Leos which means to grow up and mature that's not speaking about sinlessness but it's speaking about becoming mature perfect sounds like the same thing to us but it's not so there's a difference between the two and some of those things actually grow and they mature and they become more fluent in our lives as we become more are submitted to him and then there are certain things that we must do ourselves to have on our own I've been looking at it in the last couple of days where brother Branham would tell people that we're sick and there was various things going on with them and he would tell them be a man stand up take your healing from the devil don't let the devil rob you of your healing I thought isn't that amazing there was times that God supernaturally would come through and just drive that evil away from people and then it had to do anything basically except just believe and then there'll be other times that they would have to fight and they would have to push beyond that in order to get what was rightfully theirs I mean he's had to do it in your life sure if you've been saved long you have and yet it takes the spirit of God to help us to know which one of those times is it going to be sovereignly given or is Sovereign Grace going to come and anoint me anoint you to be able to stand and take what is rightfully ours I believe myself it takes the spirit of God to help us with that so if we got a little bit of time today I'd like to go through a few more of our riots is that all right the rights as the people of God and I'm going to start out heavy from the get-go okay so we're not playing I'm not laying no Foundation no buttering up here comes the big guns right off one of our rights as the people of God is to have deity inside of us now this is not one of those things that we learn this is not one of those things that we will eventually grow into it's not one of those things that we can be taught into educated into you'll never have enough emotion to work yourself up into it God is the only one that can give us deity because God himself is the only source of deity but God is so great that he wants to share deity with his wife now everybody in the realm of Christendom does not have deity embodied in their flesh every person that is saved does not have the indwelling presence of deity they are Justified and they're coming up to the second stage of Grace hopefully sanctification but deity can only come when the deified one imparts this portion of his own being inside of us now if we have that today I figure we ought to be just some of the happiest Mortals that are alive on the earth because you realize a lot of people will never have that but yet God has made it available if we are the right category and we believe what he said notice in Saint John 14 20 at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you now Jesus didn't say they knew it then but he sat at that day so he was speaking prophetically to a timeline that people on the Earth would start recognizing notice how he said it that you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you notice this one is different than any other of the arrangements of the threefold of this mystery that Jesus says this generally he would say the father and me and then you you but in this one he sandwiched us right in between him and the father now remember him and the Father the father is not an old man and Jesus is a young man but the father is the spirit and Jesus is the embodiment of the word so you and I become sandwiched in between the spirit and the word so the father is going to be the one that will pull us to himself notice he said it that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you verse 23 Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and the church said he won't just say he believes them he will keep them amen notice so he will keep my words and my father will love him and we spirit and word will come unto him and make our Abode with him oh he said no brother Donnie he's talking plural that's right he is talking plural not two Gods Not an old man and a young man but he's talking of this this Divine thing that God divided himself into which is spirit and word so we will come and make our Abode in him now for those of you that read your Bible and you listen to tapes and you listen to Ministry and you try your best to be able to fill your minds and your spirit with the word of God if you don't do that I'd advise you to do so because what that does is that gives you the building up of much mechanics in your human spirit that will build up the mechanics in your mind and in your memory you see one reason that I study so much I don't have to study as much as I do but I choose to do it this way because I found it out years and years ago when I was a Pentecostal preacher that the more that I laid in my spirit once I got anointed by the Holy Ghost it was like I was just given the Holy Ghost more wood and more coal and more combustible substance for him to anoint well I found that to be true when I say the message of the hour so whenever I go to preaching and a lot of times it happens and I'm counseling people and me and Carol whenever we get done with that we did here just like Sunday and whenever we both left she said I was absolutely amazed I said I was too I ain't even looked at them scriptures and I don't even know how long I haven't even remember those quotes and all how long but what you have stored in you then the Holy Ghost can come and use what you've got there now if all you've got is money and fishing and hunting and going here and Disney and this and that and the other the Holy Ghost don't use Disney quotes the Holy Ghost don't use the price of gold and the price of aluminum and this and that and the other the Holy Ghost uses his word and you've got to realize as a soldier you've got to have the word stored up inside of you for the Holy Ghost to use it now notice what Jesus says we will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him so unlike the Old Testament Prophet when the spirit of God would come on the man and then leave him come on the man and leave him unlike that the spirit of God in the New Testament does not want to come on us he does not want to make us emotional we believe in Emotion we believe in shout and run and praising God but I want more than that myself I don't want just that whenever I'm here and then when I walk out of here I ain't got enough Victory to even blowing the peach fuzz off of the peach I want an eviction whether I feel God or not that I can stand and look the devil rights Square in the face and say back off this is my territory this is my property oh yes scream let's holler with the best of them let's clap our hands but let's have enough Victory on Monday morning that when the devil says boo you boo back you don't just count down oh devil oh devil oh no we want more than an emotional worker we want a stirring of the pillar of fire down inside of our hearts notice First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 16. know ye not that ye are the temple of God can you imagine how astounding that this must have been in the first century for people who are still transitioning from the Jewish temple and the Jewish temple was still built by this time this is written around 66 A.D so almost some 30 years before it's going to be destroyed and you was Jews there were some Jews mixed amongst the people there because Apollos Aquila rather than them they were there living in the city of caress so the Jews would have got this written epistle by Paul and you imagine when they opened this up and Paul said you are on the temple of God you talking about hard to swallow because some of them have been raised going to the temple can you believe in your mind that they would have had a hard time sure transitioning from that Holy Holy place and looking at themself and saying you've got to be kidding me well I can see God living in that with all the gold and the silver and the blue and the purple and all them magnificent building and all the great orchestration and all the cherubs and this and that and that same God would now live inside of me and I would be the Temple of the Holy Ghost but I guarantee you they send a lot there in Koreans and when they read this they said praise be to God no ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you now remember this is your right as a real son or daughter of God to have deity living inside of you and the church said First Corinthians 6 19 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory so you believe Jesus Christ is deity you believe he is deity then you have a right as a child of God to embody deity I'm not talking about something that is less than Christ himself I'm not talking about a lesser dose of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the very same thing that fell on the day of Pentecost and what I'm hearing let me say it this way this is not just for preachers and it's not just for a few special men in the message let me tell you this so you understand it right from the very beginning I do not believe that preachers have the only option on receiving the holy ghost or being led by the spirit of God I do not believe that God intends for his bride to Rally in this last day around a few special gifted men and everybody else just kind of sets down and well nobody's gotten us I saw that in Pentecost it made me so sick to see it I don't mind telling you I see the same thing reoccurring again and our message and you know what it always does it will always pull pull the emphasis away from God in the body and put it on God and a few hand-picked men that's contrary to the Bible That's contrary to the message God wants every young boy every young girl ever sister ever man ever woman ever boy every girl to have deity living on the inside of them he wants you to be able to speak to your enemy and say take your hands off of my body take your hands off of my child take your hands off of my husband oh praise the Lord it ain't right friends it ain't right it ain't pleasing to God that we start another thing that's been down Through the Ages that we would rally around a few special men and so well they're the only ones that's got it and everybody else just follows them you show me that in God's word there is no such a thing oh sure God's got me that are anointed by the Holy Ghost but I'll take one thing if we're not careful we're going to get that old Nickelodeon thing and everybody's got to move here and move that let me tell you right now God don't want everybody moving to this church God don't want everybody moving to brother Tim approach church or brother Ron Spencer's shirt or brother Ron Peterson's church God wants them saying where he put them well come on brother Donnie and preach amen how we all going to spread our light around the world if everybody comes here or everybody moves to Virginia or everybody moves to Minden Louisiana you are supposed to bloom where God puts you you're supposed to bloom or God sets you out oh I wish somebody would preach with me this morning God wants you and I to be exactly what he's ordained us to be I realize a lot of the mega church idea is sweeping the message of the last statement let me tell you something God's going to have preachers at Pastor 20 or 30 or 40 and third shifts as important in the kingdom of God as the biggest church inside the message and we don't need to run them down we don't need to look down on them but we need to recognize God may have some in the inner city of Chicago he may have some in Houston he may have a little storefront here and there and there he don't want them all to move over this place or that place he wants them to move all right he wants them to move deeper in Christ Jesus and more follow the Holy Ghost more full of the power of God brother Donnie do you want a mega church no I want a church full of the Holy Ghost I want a church full of the power of God I don't want to be a mega Pastor I serve a mega God we've got a mega message we've got a message of the end time that's what I want to be a part of I'm not interested in having the biggest church in the message or the biggest church in Johnson City I've got the biggest God in the message I've got the biggest God hallelujah why would I want a man to be my idol well Glory whoever that was for there you go [Applause] I want you to listen to this said in 1950. by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from sin we become Sons and Daughters of God who is God the one that stood there and rolled the Stars off his hands and Rose worlds out of his hands made the things which do not appear deity and deity himself lives in man the Creator that made heavens and earth lives in mankind notice this 1951 if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells and the man Hallelujah then you're talking about blind eyes being opened they said nothing impossible to God but God said nothing is impossible with you now we all believe the first part and I wonder how many of us believe the second part that he just quoted nothing shall be impossible with you praise the Lord now you see what we need to move up now you say why Satan don't want you to see this he you know the prophet never said oh if the message preachers will come to their place and the Rapture will go he said if the bride recognizes who she is then the Rapture will go it's not just me recognizing who I am it's not brother down these other ministers recognizing who they are you've got to recognize Who You Are in Christ Jesus notice the very God that stood back there on the mystical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be his son and you're a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah there you are it might choke you but study over that a little while it might choke to you but study over that a little while y'all ain't getting shout to you all right I ain't got the one bottle of Gatorade I got a few more in the fridge just raise your hand if you need it and I'll help you now watch this again in 1954 can you imagine 1950 1951 1954 these statements are being preached while a lot of the other men are saying now who's got a hundred dollars here tonight I need 20 people that'll stand with 20. I need this and that and the other you need my holy oil you need my holy water you need my holy this and what was this man standing there saying that God himself had come down in the form of a human being you see mother Branham never left us a college we don't have a super highway named after him we don't have an interstate or a bridge you know you go different places and there's bridge is named after Billy Graham and there's roads named after Oral Roberts and this named after this man and that man he didn't leave us a college he didn't leave us a road he left us a word to get to heaven oh Robert's bridge will never help you across eternity Billy Graham's bridge over in Nashville will never help you get into eternity but the message of God given to us by the prophet of Malachi 4 will help us span the place of time and bring us into eternity but not only when we're dying but right now it will help us to recognize we are the Bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] oh my deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Spirit now let me go back up here and read this again just to give you a little preview of where we're going God 's self came down into a blood cell and rap the blood around him so here comes the eternal and he grabs a hold of a blood cell that he created and wrapped himself you're talking about humility and big becoming little how could the Eternal one grab one blood cell that he created and wrap himself so small and so small and so small and so small and so small and he wrapped that blood cell around himself and got inside the womb of Mary Mary Lord of God that makes me feel like running the blood cell The Germ of life God himself wrapped wrapped in this blood cell that brought forth the son Christ Jesus how does he do by that to make you perfect don't you understand white did this he wrapped himself in that blood cell so the sword would pierce the blood cell and release God thank you Lord God now what does he do he brings you through that blood cell into himself you get it through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that invales the life of Jehovah and we coming through that blood cell become a part of that life so deity itself lays in the man that received the Holy Spirit don't stop but just coming to church don't stop using I believe God said a prophet that's good but don't suffer you don't get the blood cell by saying I believe brother Adam was a prophet of God I believe Donald brother Donny's a good man I believe this in my home Church oh that's good but don't stop there there's only one way you get deity you got to get inside the blood cell why the blood cell held deity the blood cell held deity and then thy sword all thy spirit that Roman soldier whenever he pierced him it broke open the blood cell God could wrap himself but God couldn't release himself God could release himself it had to be through that breaking of the blood cell through anger through Wrath then when he broke it open then a little woman comes up a little man a drunk a liar heart at a prostitute comes through the process of the new birth oh they know is wretchedness and sin and vow their whole life and they come through the process of God and God changes them and God gives them deity so deity lays in the man that's received the Holy Spirit you are a son I'm a Branham by birth and a part of Mr and Miss Branham is in me and if you become a son or daughter of God part of deity Lays and the pastor and the great evangelist what is it like you tell me Hallelujah not Christ and the preacher not Christ just in the special anointing man of God but Christ in you the hope of glory brother down why you say this because you've got to recognize who you are Saints you're not going to overcome but we're glory to God Brother Don he's a good brother I believe he really loves the Lord I appreciate that with all of my heart but the devil won't hit you as long as you're around me maybe he'll hit you when you're by yourself we don't want our young people going to ever Youth Camp there is and every use banquet that there is and shouting and running and jumping around and coming back was not an ounce of Victory we want them to go and get something and bring it back home to us we want them to hide Victory when they get back when they can say glory to God the Lord touched me at camp but the touch was lasting it didn't last until I just got home and it was gone but I got a touch praise the Lord and I want to share it with others [Applause] notices you see how the devil robs you so you can't do this all things are possible to them that believe you are a part of deity a son and a daughter why brother it surpasses all angels archangels do you understand if an angel of God will share in this place today an angel of God could not come here and take my iPad and preach what the Lord has given me to say to you today if rather not one of these other brothers the center for preaching today that angel would be out of his place to walk up there and take that iPad because God never committed the preaching of the word to Angels God never sent Angels down here to lay their hands on the sick and anoint you with oil God called his men his servants to do the same not only men but sometimes a mother might sit there and have compassion on a crying baby in another mother's arms and light her hands on that baby and God hear that Mother's Prayer but of course if we can get our eyes off of us and just put it on this special man that one this special pastor this special man here then what do we all do we fall right back in the same so my the same slump that we were in before the message that it was all about the Great Men the great man this and the Great Men die let me tell you something there'd be no need for Great Men if there wasn't some great people for him to preach to yeah I could dismiss you all right now okay stop my sermon for the pause dismiss all of you and try to resume it we'll see how well it goes over in these nice chairs whenever we were shut down for coven I can tell you it was one of the hardest times I've ever preached in my life wasn't brother Daryl it was so difficult the words are the same the scriptures were the same the quotes were the same what was missing you all you see it's not the preacher that makes it work it's not the musicians alone that makes it work it's the body it's the body oh I want you to come up for prayer I want you to come when we have evangelism I didn't brother Timothy do an awesome job here Wednesday night and God moved for many of you but the point I want you to get here you don't want to just be touched when a special man prays for you but you want something that whenever that man's gone home and he's a thousand miles away from you that you know where you stand because you've got that same God living inside of you oh my it surpasses all Angels archangels everything else it comes right into the presence of the Potter himself and how are we brought through the blood then you come into deity and you become a part you're welded in ah you're welded in you see there's a lot of difference of being welded in and stuck in some folks get stuck in from one meeting to the other they get stuck in here and then they pull out and then they're stuck in there but once you're welded in you're good to go I'll tell you one thing when the Holy Ghost wears you into the body a life for the devil to try to come and bring his cutting torch and cut me out I ended up devils in hell to cut me out of the body well praise the Lord I ain't just talking about me I'm talking about you young men I'm talking about you sisters that have got the Holy Ghost the Lord God himself well did you into the body of Christ there's not enough sickness there's not enough demons there's not enough power there's not enough of anything that Satan can do to pull you out of the body of Christ [Applause] let's think of God folding around him now we're going to enlarge it billions of times from this blood cell and their God in this blood cell folded himself up so God just folds himself and just shrinks down to something so small you'd have to have a microscope to see it you see man cannot humble himself to that place man all the time is one to be bigger and greater and greater and more and more and more and God folded himself and folded don't you understand why the prophet called it a slowly unfolded mystery why because it was folded God folded and wrapped himself in the blood cell notice what he says wrapped himself in this blood cell and come to redeem Man's Alive Hallelujah there when the blood shall spread out spread out and brought the body Christ Jesus Jehovah himself was tabernacled in him that through the bursting of the blood cell at Calvary now look it's not enough for us to look at the chemistry and think we're in because we believe on the chemistry you've got to tap into the unfolding of the life notice he says again that God might bring sons and to himself in the blood so the cell of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ unto himself and we become a part of God that's what makes Satan mad oh praise the Lord I don't know about you but it is part of my reason on the earth is to make Satan mad I absolutely love tying that dude up I absolutely love making him mad oh I tell you he'll make you pay later but it's always fun while you're in the middle of it I love making him mad I love stirring him up I love stirring hell up and you know what I've ran I've danced I've shouted I've jumped and all that is good but right here is what makes the devil mad brother when we become a part of God it's easy when I've stood under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and command demons to come out of people and watch them come out of there and that thing head towards you oh Lord have mercy and that thing come back and try to haunt you remember brother man I'm talking about them demons he would cast them out at night and they would come in the hotel room where he was and he would hear chains rattling all night long and they would come and rub their flesh up against his oh my you better know where he stand whenever you're good or doing that sort of thing now notice but what do we want we want deity that indwells in us that when we feel absolutely nothing when the anointing is not around and the song leader ain't around and the preacher ain't around we can stand right there and say I ain't backing up devil phew that's what makes Satan mad that's what shapes him oh Lord have mercy wouldn't you love to see the devil just sitting around shaking I think I wouldn't see me shake and the demon said what's the matter devil what's the matter you're the king what's the matter oh that little woman got down on her knees to pray again oh Lord no not her oh what what in the world was going on it's that little boy he ain't about 14 years old but that little boy's got deity on the inside of him every time he goes to friend I get All Shook Up what a testimony to have what a testimony of the house that the devil gets all torn up and you go to praying oh you say I know there is nothing impossible with God he said there is nothing impossible to you I need help and he'd help now we are sons of God deity itself lives every every man that's born of the spirit of God is a part of God no wonder he believes in the Supernatural no wonder he can believe in anything why is it in him as a portion of God wrapped up in that mortal body oh here's that same word a portion of God now is wrapped up in your body now once you listen this I know some of the message folks Senator he choked to death and saw their tongue on the rest of this quote but I'm going to read it anyway oh Lord in him is a portion of God wrapped up in that mortal body with their sin everything else down in there some work of God Alone in regeneration this is my right brother Steve it's your right my brother it's your right my brothers and sisters for deity to embody itself and for you to become its shrine it's Temple don't just say kind words to Saints don't just try to be nice to Saints say a kind word to the woman at the Walmart that says my got the temperament of a porcupine foreign all day long because the rest of the world is out here about the same way they are you know I'm talking about people ain't got time to be kind no more and some of the Christians it's a sad thing to think well I can only be kind to them but my own kind I try to be kind to every Mortal life and be kind to because it might be the only kindness they get the entire rest of the week I want to let my light shine I want to let them know I don't want them to know I'm a preacher I don't go around packing a Bible an iPad and dressed up in a suit you know I hate a suit and you think God ain't got a sense of humor I got her death step in a suit and I hate it soon but I don't go around packing a Bible to you know and Dr so-and-so and this and that and the other but I packed Jesus everywhere I go why I am his Temple I'm his Temple when I got my blue jeans on I'm as simple when I got on my comfortable shoes I'm as simple when I've got on a t-shirt I am his Temple when I'm in Walmart I'm his Temple when I'm in Lowe's I'm his Temple everywhere I go and I want to let the deity inside at the temple shine out [Applause] if you're alive tile is up to the life of Jesus Christ that is he said in his word there if you'll say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe it's coming to pass you can have what you say can't you see why Satan wants to take this off and put it on just preachers then you don't have to produce this that's why I've got brother Tony I said I've got brother Timothy brother George Brown that's why we've got these other brothers around you know well my goodness I can't do that I'm just an ordinary I'm just an ordinary human and what do you figure I am lays wings no no there ain't no wings under I can tell you more like horns sometimes but don't sit there and look at me you a bunch of you all got the same thing that I have oh y'all might want to come and act like you're so holy and soul pastures rotten stinking low down no good as every other Mortal on the earth just archives it would for the grace of God entertain water in the world would be this morning may be out there hanging or some type of Hangover the night before or laying dead because we overdosed on some sort of drug but here we are sitting in the presence of Jesus Christ at hearing his word and saying amen why are we different because deity itself Tabernacles in our body that must act like it let's act like we are the Temple of the lord we are the shrine of God we are the edifice of the last days [Applause] I mean he's got some mountains in front of you today me too if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that it's coming to pass you can have what you say and he repeats it what you say and the only way you could move that mountain would have to be deity speak I've got to be honest with you I've quoted the word many a time and nothing happened absolutely not one thing I might as well have quoted Hamlet I might as well quoted Shakespeare how about as well quoted you know some great poet as far as material physical evidence happening whenever I said it how much ever been there and done that well you need this and there's a glory to God I'm going to be bold hallelujah look out devil here I come he'll abide me and my words by you ask what you are I'm asking right now in the name of Jesus this certain certain thing happens here [Music] we have to keep believing he didn't say what happened right then maybe a little grain of sand on the other side of that mountain when you spoke when tumbling right now nobody ever saw it it was so little even the devil didn't pay no attention that's to his demise too and if God did it out of your sight and then tomorrow another rock fell and another rock fell and I know well there comes a song and another rock fell and another rock fell as I spoke his word another rock fell and another rock fell as I believed his word hallelujah hallelujah it may be a week it may be a month it might be a year and on the other side of the mountain it's done half gone but where you're looking at it oh no come on [Applause] the only way you could move that mountain would have to be dear to speak when you're a Son of God you receive God which is Zoe God's own life and you become a part of God okay I'm not very smart don't y'all say Amen to that inner so dogs begat cats beget s horses beget and if God ever gave birth are you Brazen and bold enough to say so if God ever came first what would God give birth you got the cab Parts you got the dog parts you got the horse part why is it so hard it's this it wants to keep us back from acknowledging what's inside of us but brother Donnie if you only lived with me you might not say that well that's true but I do live with me I do live with me and I know how I am as a mortal I get afraid I get fearful when things are said or this or that or the other I get fearful as a man say you yes let me go a little further and tell you according to the book of Hebrews the Lord Jesus feared deity in a human Temple does not eliminate all fear but it gives you a peace to help calm it down it's a human reaction whenever you hear a bad news or a bad doctors report or whatever more and immediately an immediate response takes place in your flesh you know what I'm talking about you care about bad news you get a phone call oh my your husband's been in a wreck oh Lord Oh Lord oh no no no God no no don't take him don't take him of course I guess it depends on what kind of husband he said oh Lord thank you thank you thank you God and you start texting me brother Donnie prepare the funeral service but after that him what happens for my sin deity did not I tell you I would never leave you I would never forsake you haven't I been with you this far why not I'll take you the rest of the way through children aren't you glad for that I see why people I hear drink I see why they dope I see why they do what they do there ain't no telling what we would be if it wasn't for him and our triple but now what would we be woman we wind up being in this crazy world but we have deity enthroned in our bodies notice this to be a Christian you must be christ-like tabernacling deity in you with the Holy Ghost notice light fell on the day of Pentecost you mean the message Holy Ghost it's the same one that Peter and them had I may believe that same power do the same things same works well they acted like drunk people can they do the same thing to us heal the sent raise the Dead cast out devils oh why is there so many messages people don't believe that and they'll try to make you 1906 Pentecost If You Preach them when their own Prophet that they say they believed said this oh my what's a holy ghost I fell on the day of Pentecost not some emotion but I mean a real Pentecostal that's right I've never believed that the Holy Ghost was shaking I've never believed that the Holy Ghost evidence of speaking in tongues or crying or shouting them's emotional Sensations I believe the Holy Ghost can do that that's when you're supposed to say Amen I believe the Holy Ghost can do that but the Holy Ghost is tabernacling some of you ain't never shout in your life and some of you probably ain't going to shout some of you seen shouters some of these criers I don't think I ever seen brother Jim Babb Shout I was waiting for many many years but I'd watch him as he said over here to my right and whenever the word some of y'all were shouting and jumping he said they're just tears is born out and maybe I'll talk to him the next day or the next step brother Donnie I just had to tell you that that there was sober and he was ecstatic wilder than a Timbuktu Indian and wasn't he moving out of his seat but you see we begin to sing well in order to be spiritual you've got to be this way that way I would start making a mold of what we think everybody ought to feel you understand what you're doing you're making an organization I don't care if you don't run like brother Daryl me and Kevin was talking about the other day she said Donnie do you really believe that Jesus preached like you I said I don't I say I don't believe Jesus preached out brother Daryl I don't think Jesus preached out brother Ron and I name some different emotional preachers I don't believe Jesus preached like that the Bible says that in one place that Jesus set down and opened his mouth and those words that flowed out of his mouth so when we think he was anointed why because we tend to think the anointing is movement and emotion no the anointing will move on our emotions and make us emotional but that don't mean it's the Holy Ghost doing he looks and I've seen folks do all kinds of coins on and live with somebody else's wife that don't mean it's a Holy Ghost Brother Don don't you believe thy with all of my heart and I don't want you just to be emotional I want you to Tabernacle deity so when the emotion cannot be found and you feel like you're about to lose your mind you can speak from your soul and say Satan you will not defeat me Hallelujah people get worked up and excited emotion it's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is tabernacling deity got a few more minutes when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it on his lips I want you to notice your part in this you have to take this word Or Glory place it in your heart notice a man's Spirit-filled man takes the word into his heart and places it on his lips God ain't doing this part this is your part in my part so I take the word into my heart a sink a study on it I think about it oh yes then when the time is right I place it on my lips I don't mind telling you that's the scary part for me I don't get scared whether I read these quotes I'm not sitting there reading them this morning I thought Lord have mercy I about how to spell just sitting there studying looking at I don't get scared on that but now for me facing a need I think something that's pressing against me to be able to take it from my heart that I've committed to move it from here to up here and say in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I I uh I'm gonna get my phone I'm gonna call Brother Daryl and I'm gonna ask brother Daryl if he will uh pray for me uh I'm gonna I'm gonna call uh I'm gonna I'm gonna send brother to my brother on text because we're on a three-way chat I'm going to send them a text and tell them that I need a word from the Lord and I've got something in my way this morning and I didn't need to move the out of my way and asked them if they would feel led to say it for me boy it's hot in here this morning or is it just me but when a man can take the word into his heart and place it place it when he says why that is the same deity speaking but you see we've all seen people do that that was wrong maybe asked a few times we've tried to take that word here and speak and I said glory to God I feel not only in the name of Jesus and we messed up so then the next time it makes a little bit harder because I think I might mess up again I don't want to bring reproach on the Lord I don't want to bring her approach on the word I guess I'll just hold my face exactly what Satan wants you to do today to where you store it in your heart and sometimes your heart feels like it's about to explode but you just keep it right there how many knows what I'm talking about maybe some of you are sitting here today and you have never been where you are you need a word from God so desperately you need something from him so desperate and he may use a preacher yeah I believe the Lord sent brother Timothy your life Wednesday to speak to us don't you you remember that scripture that he read there said the lord gave him that scripture for us how fitting it was I believe the Lord did that don't you it didn't take hard in no courage at all for me to sit right there beside my wife and say Amen whenever he said it I just said amen praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus for sending that word but now what if God anoints me to say a word to you this morning and I have to speak it before hundreds that are here and thousands that are streaming ah would I get nervous I mean sweating bullets I'm talking about missiles I go to sweating missiles so what if God anoints you to come and give me a word brother Donnie I don't know what you're going through but the Lord told me when I was sitting there it's going to be all right brother don't fear God's going to move for you well Hallelujah the longer I go the quieter you all get friends don't you see why we need help I better would admit it Lord I need help I need help moving this word from my heart to my mouse why it's the same as deity speaking listen what what this type of an individual what is equipped with Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man by the way I'm at a sister with long hair and long dresses and the brother cut through his hair and the brothers thank God don't wear dresses to our church a mini skirts and thank the Lord I'm glad they don't do that because I'd hate to throw them out on their head that's all well and good but what about this don't nobody don't nobody what this part too or you're gonna go around every day doing this no some of you may do it once in your life some of you may do it a half a dozen times but that one time you speak it it might be to a backslider and you may be packing life that'll bring them back to complete restoration it may be that God but use a little a little personal laymember and anoint them to write a card to to one of these ministers here that's gone this such a terrible time and God but to use you as brother Timothy mentioned the other night about the card and the thing that he had received and it was already in the mailbox he's waiting for him to go down and get it and God may use you to encourage a man of God that was feeling like he was wasting his time and you're saying well I ain't nobody I ain't nobody the spirit of God moves on your heart to send me a card send it spirited God moves on your heart to send me an email of encouragement a text of encouragement send it because God Alone knows what I'm going through he said Nate's on your heart to send on these other ministers you send it because God may use your very handwriting or your texting to bring a little bit of joy to help me through that difficult time that I'm going through but if everybody says well I'm nothing and I ain't nobody so I don't know brother Don even knows my name I don't know if it mean anything to him or not if he got a card for me let me tell you something friend if God told you to do it it wouldn't mean everything to me why God LED you to speak something to me let me close every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man understand [Applause] praise the Lord I wonder how many people are standing here today with deity inside their bodies the same one who wrapped himself up in that blood cell that's out wrapped himself up in yours in your body in your temple and he's wanting to get out not to leave you but so that he can express himself to others you won't have to worry about preaching most of you ain't going to you don't have to worry about signing up prophesying oh but I'm afraid God will embarrass me no no don't worry about God will never ask you to do something that he's not called you and gifted you to do if God's called you he's gifted you to be able to do it but it will take that pulsation of Faith but I said aren't you go around speaking all the time I don't why same reason you don't I don't want to be wrong I've seen enough in my life where people said the Lord told me this and thus saith the Lord and the Lord said that and the Lord said that and you you see by the fruit of it that is not God and God Don't Lie and God don't never tell us nothing to break his word so what does that tend to do brother Jackie tends to make us more afraid don't it because we don't want to bring no reproach on Christ or his word but if this quote is never going to be fulfilled I don't understand why it was ever allowed to be placed in the church age book and what Jesus said in John is never going to come to pass in our generation and we're or the continuation of that Apostolic age I don't say why Jesus did not put a time limit on that and say this will only be good for the first three or four Church ages after that they will see so much flesh and so much error that they'll become so nervous I will invalidate this scripture from say 606 A.D onto the end of the rapture I just can't believe that it's either true or it's not true how many believes it's all true how many beliefs you know where the problem is I don't put your finger at me now because I'm not your problem but don't point it over at her but Rob you came porn it's yours because she ain't here today she's streaming hard he spawned her on the camera where's the problem the 10 where is it right here this is prayer oh Jesus I'm so sorry I'm so sorry our old flesh our own Humanity I mentioned it to you for decades of my life I don't know why you ever even call me in the first place I'm a poor excuse of a Preacher I'm a poor excuse of a leader I don't know why you'd even fool with me we look at ourselves today and we thank Lord why in the world would you even want us some of these men could stand here today said Lord why would you even give me Grace even after you saved me I've messed up so bad I've done so much stupid stuff Lord in life they might say but yet you chose to wrap yourself in our flesh oh God what a gift love divide from the heart of the Lord Jesus straight into man deity Untold through the Mysteries unfold the great power of God and this Earth as we tried the almighty himself will become one of us to give us his life Hallelujah an end well in US not another God but the same same power the same works and the very same name that immortality might Embrace a creature of time and take us Beyond natural substance into the sublime that the Eternal one condensed sinned and wrapping a blood cell that he would deliver my soul from the power of hell Hallelujah and here we are today with that same deity power living in US and reigning in this hour making us to be what his word has said and declared to be and manifested and read what others will scoff at and truly make fun yet with this in our souls this race we must run for it is not ourself it is not our ability but deity himself living in US oh Hallelujah who are we that love divine would so strike our souls in a moment of time that the Eternal would embody himself and our flesh and give us of his deity that we be embraced and soon he will come and take us away to that blessed place that he said there that day I go to prepare a place there for you and if I go and do it children I will come after you for I will take you to my place so far away all of your troubles and Sorrows will vanish away Arise My Love and look up to the sky for soon and very soon this is the direction you will fly in a moment your body shall be changed your cells and your bones shall be rearranged by the indwelling of my presence that lives inside of you you will know it's either the Lord God I have kept you true be not afraid shut or not look not at the darkness but look to me for it is he that walk of among you Hallelujah Hallelujah I am your Lily I am your bright and Morning Star it is me who formed myself that I could come into your heart you are my temple my Tabernacle this
