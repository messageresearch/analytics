[27:04] fault I won't blame
[27:09] you even though you didn't make the
[27:14] mountain
[27:16] move you must have
[27:20] known that in
[27:23] time I'd get so much closer to you as I
[27:31] climb because you gave me strength when
[27:36] I was
[27:39] weak because you never lost your faith
[27:44] in
[27:45] me I love you

[27:52] before cuz when I needed
[27:56] you you were there D to pull me through

[28:20] [Music]
[28:21] more without some
[28:25] rain nothing would
[28:29] grow without some pain how would we ever

[28:44] most I'm finding every time you hold me

[29:47] Lord oh because you've been so faithful
[29:52] to me Lord
[29:58] I love you
[30:02] [Music]
[30:15] more and many's been through those
[30:19] times the analogy that brother BR used
[30:22] is quite
[30:23] amazing about the Shepherd that
[30:26] sometimes he when you get a little a
[30:28] little bit of rebellious or stubborn or
[30:29] something that he has to take up that
[30:31] sheep and break that
[30:34] leg so he can give you a little bit more
[30:37] affection and tender
[30:40] care I woke up early this morning before
[30:42] daylight
[30:44] and that quote I didn't thought about it
[30:46] in quite a while but he was talking
[30:49] about the Holocaust and all the
[30:53] Jews and he's said talking about people
[30:55] misunderstanding it and so on
[30:58] and he uses these terms to describe it
[31:02] the tender hand of
[31:05] Jehovah the tender hand of
[31:09] Jehovah it sure wouldn't look tender
[31:11] would
[31:13] it because we look at everything from
[31:15] this side in time try to understand it
[31:18] all that way but when if he out there in
[31:21] eternity and you look back this way
[31:24] everything would look so much different
[31:28] our loved ones that pass and go on to
[31:30] the other
[31:31] realm and we try to figure what are they
[31:34] thinking what are they
[31:36] doing um do they feel sadness do they
[31:39] feel what do they
[31:42] feel and it's perfectly normal for us of
[31:45] course looking at it from that
[31:47] perspective because that's all we
[31:49] know but can you imagine if he was a
[31:53] hog and one day he was
[31:56] changed from a
[31:58] hog to a human being all you never done
[32:02] was eat slop your whole life rooted with
[32:05] your nose and just stunk like a hog eat
[32:10] like a hog acted like a
[32:13] hog and then one day you stepped out of
[32:17] that pig pin and all of a sudden you
[32:19] were a human
[32:22] being and you thought thoughts that
[32:24] you'd never knew a being could even
[32:28] think you could talk you could laugh you
[32:33] could express such
[32:35] emotions but a hog just don't
[32:38] express if you can multiply that now by
[32:41] millions of
[32:42] times you can imagine one of our
[32:44] brothers and sisters and when they leave
[32:46] this realm and it's actually a birth to
[32:49] them really they born into that
[32:53] body and they have eyes ears
[32:58] they have things similar to
[33:01] us but it's like being born into a brand
[33:04] new
[33:07] world can't you see why you'll never be
[33:10] satisfied
[33:11] here cuz you know it's
[33:16] there I'm so thankful to God that he
[33:19] allowed our church AE messenger the
[33:22] first one and the seventh one to be able
[33:26] to get a glimpse
[33:28] and actually a
[33:30] visitation into a Heavenly
[33:32] realm go there and come back and tell us
[33:36] what it was
[33:40] like praise the Lord and to think in
[33:44] that Dimension it's not 20 ft from where
[33:48] we
[33:48] are about the heights of this ceiling
[33:51] here something like
[33:56] that and if you've been born
[33:59] again you've got a body waiting there
[34:01] for you I can't talk about it too much
[34:04] cuz I don't want to live in this one no
[34:08] longer why would
[34:10] we is it a privilege to be together
[34:13] tonight to be able to serve the Lord
[34:15] Jesus let us read tonight if you would
[34:18] in the Book of
[34:19] Genesis chapter
[34:25] 1 verse 11
[34:32] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[34:35] grass the herb yielding
[34:38] seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[34:41] after his
[34:43] kind whose
[34:46] seed is in
[34:49] itself listen to program of
[34:52] God whose seed is in itself
[34:58] upon the Earth and it was so and the
[35:01] Earth brought forth grass herb yielding
[35:04] seed after his kind the tree yielding
[35:06] fruit whose seed was in
[35:10] itself after his
[35:12] kind and God
[35:15] saw that it was
[35:17] good how many he has a request before
[35:21] the Lord
[35:22] tonight sister Janny lemman also wanted
[35:25] a a prayer call for a need that she has
[35:28] so let's just take these to the
[35:31] Lord heavenly father I want to thank you
[35:34] first of all that we didn't get snowed
[35:37] out where we could have
[35:40] church some maybe on their roads wasn't
[35:43] able to make it or uh just out of
[35:46] precaution they didn't want to be here
[35:48] tonight and we just thank you Lord that
[35:52] we were able to have it so hopefully
[35:54] even though they couldn't be here
[35:55] physically they can be able to stream
[35:58] we'll go back and archive the service
[36:01] but for those of us that are here we're
[36:03] here to have
[36:05] church we've sung we've prayed now we're
[36:10] praying over the word we're expecting to
[36:13] hear from Heaven
[36:15] tonight dear God if that will happen
[36:19] there will have to be a phenomenal
[36:21] miracle that will take
[36:23] place you will have to take a human

[36:30] placed in that human

[37:49] seated now with the help of the Lord
[37:51] tonight will change a little bit in the
[37:53] direction that we've been going on the
[37:57] law
[37:58] of sewing and reaping dealing mainly
[38:02] with
[38:03] us and we'll change it tonight by the
[38:06] help of the Lord into the original
[38:11] s and the Original Seed Creator which we
[38:16] know of course is not us and it's not
[38:19] the devil and it's not Angels but it's
[38:23] God now I realize that for the age that
[38:26] we're living
[38:28] that many people have taken it upon
[38:30] thems to attack the message and attack
[38:35] the messenger and they feel like of
[38:37] course they're called to do all of that
[38:40] and they would like to portray to us
[38:42] that brother brandom was a man that was
[38:44] a deceiver and a liar and he was a man
[38:48] that was trying to lead people to hell
[38:52] and I guess as I hear some of these
[38:55] things and read some of them in the in
[38:57] the the past few years that has surfaced
[39:00] that I realize that those people that
[39:03] want to make that charge and that
[39:05] accusation apparently even those that
[39:08] was around the message for a long time
[39:10] and then turned away as a dog does to
[39:12] its vomit and a hog dust or watering in
[39:14] the M that apparently they never
[39:17] listened to very many tapes when they
[39:19] were supposedly in the message and they
[39:23] never caught something that the bride C
[39:27] is whenever they listen to those texts
[39:30] because if they did they would realize
[39:34] I've been around deceivers before I've
[39:37] been around Hypocrites before most of
[39:39] you all have I've been around people
[39:42] before that were Liars that were
[39:45] deceivers they were intentionally trying
[39:48] to deceive people it's not that they
[39:51] were deceived and then deceiving but
[39:54] they were actually knowingly trying to
[39:57] deceive people and there's certain
[39:59] things that you watch and that you learn
[40:02] about deceivers and that's what lets me
[40:05] know that most of these people that are
[40:07] making the charges against God's Prophet
[40:10] they don't have a clue about what
[40:11] deceivers really are because dece
[40:14] deceivers put on a front of course they
[40:17] never let you see the real them they
[40:21] never let you know their true motives
[40:23] and their true objectives so they put on
[40:26] a front because they are under satanic
[40:30] inspiration so Satan can cause his
[40:32] ministers to appear as Ministers of
[40:36] righteousness Jesus says in the gospels
[40:39] that they will come in the last days and
[40:41] they will actually be wolves but they
[40:45] will wear sheep's clothing but if you're
[40:49] around an individual like that long
[40:52] enough eventually you'll hear the wolf
[40:56] growl and the wolf always has a
[40:58] different smell than a sheep and
[41:01] eventually the wolf smell will project
[41:06] out of the sheep clothing but whenever I
[41:10] listen to the tapes of of brother
[41:12] brandham and I read this message what I
[41:16] see is not a man that is trying to
[41:19] deceive people and first of all himself
[41:23] be lost and wind up standing before God
[41:28] and answering for deceiving hundreds of
[41:31] thousands of people what I see and what
[41:35] I hear is a man that loved God so much
[41:39] and loved the people of God so much and
[41:42] a man that would confess his wrongs give
[41:45] to us his
[41:47] shortcomings tell us regrets in his life
[41:51] tell us that the Holy Spirit called him
[41:55] a liar tell tell us that he listened to
[41:59] his
[42:00] mother-in-law instead of listening to
[42:02] God which was the worst mistake he'd
[42:05] ever made in his life he said and that
[42:08] that day he would stand before God and
[42:12] answer for many many
[42:15] Souls now that's not like the language
[42:19] of the deceivers and the tricksters that
[42:22] I have personally
[42:24] known praise the Lord so whenever I
[42:27] listen to this I myself I don't have to
[42:31] have a guard up that I've got to be so
[42:35] careful because brother randam is trying
[42:37] to deceive me and he's trying to pull
[42:40] the wool over my eyes tricksters don't
[42:42] pull the wool over your eyes they pull
[42:45] the wool over their wolf
[42:48] hide so that you will think that they
[42:51] are a sheep you know whenever I hear him
[42:55] make statements I I'm fixing to read to
[42:58] you tonight I believe it's from the
[43:01] heart of a sincere man that loved God as
[43:07] I said and loved his people and knew
[43:10] what his responsibility was in this age
[43:14] so he didn't look at his position as one
[43:18] lightly that he could lead people astray
[43:21] lie to people make up lies you know all
[43:24] these sort of things that he's being
[43:26] accused of in this this day and I find
[43:28] it so amazing that all of these people
[43:30] that are doing that they can do it very
[43:32] easily since he's gone but I wonder how
[43:36] many of them would have done it to his
[43:39] face that would be a different story
[43:41] wouldn't so now I laid that foundation
[43:44] so you'd be able to um understand this
[43:47] quote that I'm going to read to you see
[43:49] now why I have been so
[43:52] zealous of the kind of seed that I have
[43:56] planted
[43:57] for the body see now why I have been so
[44:02] zealous for the kind of seed that I have
[44:06] planted for the body so now what what do
[44:09] you hear when you hear a man making
[44:14] these statements what I hear is a man
[44:17] that knows he has a great awesome
[44:22] responsibility and that he's been called
[44:25] to a spot
[44:27] unlike hardly anyone else that's ever
[44:30] lived especially no one in this age now
[44:33] I realize every God call man is
[44:37] responsible for the seed that he's going
[44:40] to seow but there is no way me any other
[44:43] brother in this message will answer for
[44:47] what brother brandham will have to
[44:49] answer for now listen as I read it to
[44:51] you again see now why I have been so
[44:55] zealous of the kind of seed that I have
[45:00] planted for the body now notice his
[45:03] motive his objected his
[45:07] sensitivity to the call so he realizes
[45:11] that he is responsible for
[45:15] millions of
[45:17] people he's going to answer to almighty
[45:20] God from millions of people now the
[45:24] setting is of course March something
[45:27] like that I think March uh let me look
[45:29] here uh yes March the 18th
[45:34] 1962 so this is approximately two years
[45:39] after he's went beyond the curtain of
[45:41] time and come
[45:43] back he heard all those voices of those
[45:48] people telling him that they were
[45:52] resting on his teaching yeah and he said
[45:55] if Paul's group goes in mine will
[45:59] because what Paul taught I taught the
[46:02] same
[46:03] thing and those millions of voices
[46:08] screamed out we are resting on that I
[46:13] believe I was identified there then and
[46:16] I can say the same thing tonight I am
[46:20] resting it's not my call to stand
[46:25] brother ROM's teachings
[46:28] a scripture hit me today right as I was
[46:31] setting studying before I come to church
[46:34] and I I I wasn't even looking in that
[46:36] direction but I I could hear it it may
[46:40] seem strange to you but I could hear it
[46:43] and it was reverberating I was sitting
[46:45] there my laptop in my lap and I could
[46:48] hear it reverberating like like the
[46:50] Reverb was turned up really really loud
[46:54] and it was I could hear it in the
[46:56] distance
[46:58] and it said as Jen's and
[47:01] jambre with stood
[47:05] Moses so were these men in the last days
[47:08] and I saw oh my
[47:11] goodness so janies and
[47:14] jambre with stood
[47:16] Moses now it's amazing that Paul wrote
[47:21] that and would call their names
[47:27] since the Bible doesn't say what their
[47:28] names
[47:32] were now for those that want to check
[47:35] God's prophit of this day by the
[47:38] scripture if you don't do Paul the same
[47:40] way you're a hypocrite on Genesis Exodus
[47:46] numbers Leviticus Deuteronomy Kings
[47:49] Samuels Chronicles none of the Old
[47:51] Testament books mention their names
[47:55] where did did Paul get
[47:59] that as janies and
[48:02] jamre and the meaning of his name is
[48:06] foaming
[48:08] healing
[48:11] foaming healing and the other one was a
[48:16] soothsayer but they with stod Moses and
[48:20] I I thought oh my goodness and it just
[48:23] becomes so real to me I I actually pull
[48:27] my laptop another window open I have
[48:28] about 3 6 9 12 I have about 12 Windows
[48:31] something like that going at one time
[48:34] now you know why I'm so weird that I can
[48:36] be able to
[48:37] multitask my processor is a
[48:40] multitasker so I pull that scripture up
[48:43] and and in Timothy to look at it and
[48:45] click on the meanings of the words and
[48:48] that word har
[48:50] withstood with stod which was to rebel
[48:54] against and question
[48:57] his
[48:58] authority and I thought oh my here we
[49:01] are that it's not just Pentecostal
[49:05] preachers the denominational preachers
[49:09] but we actually have message
[49:12] preachers that are withstanding the
[49:14] authority of God's
[49:17] Prophet questioning what he preached on
[49:20] this what he preached on that
[49:23] withstanding his authority
[49:27] now listen as he he knows that he's
[49:30] going to answer to God so what is
[49:34] brother renom doing you see now why I've
[49:37] been so zealous of the kind of seed not
[49:41] just to seow anything but the kind of
[49:46] seed that I have planted for the body
[49:50] now this is a man that knows his
[49:54] responsibility so he's sewing this seed
[49:58] and has been for years Caroline I were
[50:01] talking last night and I told her I said
[50:03] you know it's really phenomenal when you
[50:06] think about what God did because God
[50:09] took a man that was uneducated as far as
[50:13] the world would would say and a man that
[50:17] whenever you look at some of his notes
[50:20] and we have some of them back there in a
[50:22] case in the library and you'll read his
[50:27] handwriting and his spelling and his use
[50:31] of nouns and pronouns and adverbs and
[50:35] adjectives and so on and you you read it
[50:38] there and and you say Lord I mean it it
[50:41] breaks my heart I've seen these notes
[50:44] for years and years brother George
[50:46] sister Rebecca made me copies of some of
[50:49] them years ago just to let me have them
[50:51] and and read them and I I look at them
[50:54] and I read them and it breaks my heart
[50:58] because he couldn't
[51:03] spell he didn't know good
[51:05] [Music]
[51:08] grammar and God said that's my
[51:14] choice aren't you glad the Common People
[51:18] heard him
[51:20] gladly now when you think that God as I
[51:23] was telling her last night would choose
[51:26] such a man but I told us to think about
[51:29] it that God from the time the message
[51:32] started being recorded in
[51:34] 1947 into
[51:36] 1965 a span of 18 years being recorded
[51:41] on magnetic tape then books started
[51:44] being printed and so on and things that
[51:47] was uttered and
[51:50] preached was part of the mystery of God
[51:55] which had not been uttered since the
[51:57] foundation of the
[51:59] world and not from some Harvard
[52:02] Professor not from some Theologian who
[52:06] graduated from Bob Jones University you
[52:10] imagine some of the preachers that sat
[52:12] behind him whenever they'd hear him use
[52:15] his grammar and his Linguistics and all
[52:18] of his ability and this and that and the
[52:21] other and they would probably laugh and
[52:24] snigger but I wonder how they snickered
[52:27] when the angel of God come down and told
[52:29] them their secrets of their
[52:32] hearts oh I hope that we never get so
[52:36] smart in all our intellect now you
[52:39] realize where we are in the
[52:42] message we have been around so long we
[52:46] actually are
[52:48] producing
[52:50] message
[52:52] theologians we've got several of
[52:55] them several message
[53:00] theologians and theology is not always
[53:04] bad but whenever they become so
[53:09] theological that they want to start
[53:12] correcting the very man that the message
[53:15] come through this old boy has a
[53:20] problem I hope you
[53:23] do now think God gave that respon
[53:26] responsibility to one man and this our
[53:30] age at the ending of the Omega stage of
[53:34] the Bride will be one of the greater
[53:38] challenges that preachers will have
[53:41] because they will have studied and
[53:44] studied and accumulated the message and
[53:47] accumulated the quotes and accumulated
[53:49] Greek and Hebrew and the linear
[53:51] dictionary and on and on and on and on
[53:54] and on we can go and if they're not
[53:57] careful they will become so confident in
[54:00] their own
[54:02] studies even some I know writing their
[54:05] own commentaries on different
[54:08] books writing their own commentaries of
[54:12] this and that and the
[54:14] other why because they feel like they
[54:17] have an opinion they feel like they have
[54:20] something that should be given to the
[54:22] bride you think the preacher is just
[54:24] writing it for his wife
[54:28] oh my notice but whenever a man realizes
[54:33] his position and can operate in that
[54:37] category and this is where the Prophet
[54:39] was that I planted for the body the
[54:43] rains going to fall pretty soon now
[54:47] listen to these words I
[54:50] mean the real
[54:53] rain now during this time frame
[54:57] is when the lighter rain is still
[55:01] ongoing and remember part of this came
[55:05] from up in
[55:07] Canada I've been there to where and
[55:10] actually preached in a church
[55:13] there to where the latter rain in the
[55:16] early days
[55:19] started so they started laying hands on
[55:23] preachers and sending them out and said
[55:25] you're in a Apostle you're a missionary
[55:28] you're this that the other and they
[55:31] tried to Rally around brother brandham
[55:34] now listen this that move was not just
[55:38] on the theological side but it was
[55:40] actually a supernatural move with
[55:45] tongues
[55:47] interpretation prophecy it was not on
[55:50] the side of theology but it appeared to
[55:55] be a great
[55:58] Supernatural move but it didn't go very
[56:02] long until they started having men that
[56:06] were heads and this and that and the
[56:08] other and they even tried to get brother
[56:10] brandom to be a part of it and they were
[56:13] going to Rally around him now look what
[56:16] Satan was
[56:18] doing Satan had done known the prophet
[56:21] of God would never go that way and make
[56:24] an organization himself
[56:27] so he tried to put men around him that
[56:31] would make an organization and I don't
[56:34] mind telling you that's still ongoing to
[56:37] this very day that's right now the light
[56:40] of rain the prophet mentions about it
[56:42] several times and he said out of this
[56:44] message will not come a denomination
[56:47] they said you Brethren from Canada you
[56:50] remember he refers to it for many many
[56:51] years and he said they tried to form a
[56:54] denomination there years ago and he said
[56:56] it just basically fell apart but they
[56:59] still tried now watch what he's so
[57:03] zealous over I mean the real rain
[57:07] because the lot of rain is still being
[57:09] talked about now in
[57:11] 1962 I mean the rear ring and it's got
[57:15] to have seed to fall on I hope I live to
[57:20] see it do you understand now it will be
[57:24] the Living Word as it was in the
[57:28] beginning the spoken word of God have
[57:33] his power for it is him in his own body
[57:39] working his own way amen all right now
[57:43] if that quote will ever come to pass
[57:48] there would have to be seed sown for the
[57:52] light of rain to fall upon it so
[57:55] remember God doesn't just tell us so
[57:58] kindness so generosity so forgiveness so
[58:02] this out of the other God himself abides
[58:06] by his own law this is why you never
[58:09] find almighty God ever sewing
[58:14] denominational or
[58:17] hybridized
[58:18] seed God will only sow Original Seed
[58:24] which is spoken word
[58:26] because it will multiply and reproduce
[58:29] itself so God could not in this last day
[58:33] be able to produce an Omega bride by
[58:38] taking leot of Pentecost and rewing that
[58:43] seed again under the ministry of Malachi
[58:48] 4 and said well I I'll just I'll just
[58:51] change it a bit I I'll just polish it up
[58:54] a little bit and I'll let the pro take
[58:56] that same seed and reso it and then
[59:00] it'll produce a bride no 1906 was
[59:05] hybridized Luther was hybridized Wesley
[59:11] was hybridized so God had to have a
[59:15] sewer on the earth that would be a
[59:18] Prelude to the
[59:21] Rapture there could be no rapture
[59:26] on the seeds that had been sown up
[59:30] through this pyramid by time it left the
[59:32] First
[59:34] Foundation they were
[59:37] trinitarians they believed in women
[59:39] preachers they believed in eternal hell
[59:41] you might on nod your head most of us
[59:44] believed a lot that same
[59:46] stuff so God could not let the light of
[59:49] rain or rapturing face fall on a heart
[59:54] that was baptized entitles in this and
[59:58] called it the Omega bride cuz the alpha
[1:00:02] bride was baptized in the
[1:00:04] name but after that then what did they
[1:00:06] do they lost the name and then they were
[1:00:10] baptized and titles so God could not
[1:00:12] take the title baptism and sews that and
[1:00:17] then the rapturing face fall on that and
[1:00:20] then the bride coming up and saying well
[1:00:23] where where's the other two where's the
[1:00:25] other two well well there ain't two more
[1:00:28] oh really oh oh I I I I I thought there
[1:00:31] was three there was three different ones
[1:00:33] the Omega bride don't believe in three
[1:00:37] she believes in
[1:00:38] one so you can see why then when the SE
[1:00:43] would come he would seem so
[1:00:48] controversial so he would start from the
[1:00:52] seed of The Serpent and go all the way
[1:00:56] way to the messenger now that's a quote
[1:00:59] so he would go from the seed of The
[1:01:02] Serpent and go all the way to the
[1:01:06] messenger he would deal with the blood
[1:01:09] The Mercy Seat justification
[1:01:12] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:15] he would deal with all of that because
[1:01:18] it must be
[1:01:20] rewn an original true
[1:01:24] format because because the godhead had
[1:01:27] become so
[1:01:29] hybridized which started way back in the
[1:01:32] first age you know some of those men
[1:01:34] there I've read some of their writings
[1:01:36] some of them that got off of the
[1:01:37] original past and they begin to question
[1:01:41] what Peter James John Paul and those
[1:01:44] Brothers begin to teach well by the time
[1:01:45] it comes in Isaiah and 3:25 ad they have
[1:01:48] done God that aryanism and then they've
[1:01:50] got the other school of Sal and they
[1:01:53] meet and go to hashing and out a bunch
[1:01:54] of theologians didn't bit more have the
[1:01:56] Holy Ghost than this desk has got it and
[1:01:59] they were led by the intellect of their
[1:02:01] mind and they started hybridizing the
[1:02:03] word of God and then they done away with
[1:02:06] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:02:09] Jesus they quit casting out Devils they
[1:02:12] quit Healing The Sick they quit
[1:02:14] ministering the power of
[1:02:17] God notice he says oh
[1:02:21] my as God is sending him on the earth it
[1:02:25] will be The Living Word as it was at the
[1:02:28] beginning the spoken word of God have
[1:02:31] his power for it is him in his own body
[1:02:37] working his own
[1:02:39] way now I mentioned it to you Sunday but
[1:02:42] let me go back through it again tonight
[1:02:44] that Christ was actually the seed that
[1:02:49] Eve should have given birth
[1:02:53] to Christ he was that son that should
[1:02:59] have come through Adam by the spoken
[1:03:02] word and Eve would have given birth to
[1:03:07] him now watch's this again the spoken
[1:03:10] words orinal City if you aren't listen
[1:03:11] to it again brother Donnie I've heard
[1:03:13] that three times yeah me too in the last
[1:03:16] two
[1:03:17] days so let me just tell you uh I I I've
[1:03:21] listened to it day before yesterday and
[1:03:23] finished it up started again yesterday
[1:03:25] and finished it up started it again
[1:03:27] today and I told care I said you know
[1:03:29] it's so amazing to me because I just
[1:03:32] heard it I've heard it twice this week
[1:03:35] and I'm on the third time and I said
[1:03:37] I've heard the exact same tapes the
[1:03:40] exact same words and I'm constantly
[1:03:43] copying and cutting and pasting and
[1:03:45] sending myself the email of the quotes
[1:03:48] and I'm thinking Donnie where were you
[1:03:50] where were you when this was being
[1:03:52] played that's the kind of message that
[1:03:55] we have friend
[1:03:56] it's constantly unfolding where we are
[1:03:59] you I've listened to it till three time
[1:04:01] well by the time you get 250 times you
[1:04:04] might understand a little bit about
[1:04:06] what's been said now listen this Jesus
[1:04:10] is the word made manifest he and his
[1:04:13] word is one the same now what was he
[1:04:16] look he was that seed now watch I'm
[1:04:21] going to I'm going to bring some some
[1:04:23] paragraphs together here so whenever you
[1:04:26] see these dots in front of that that
[1:04:28] means I took part of this out to put
[1:04:30] these paragraphs together he was that se
[1:04:35] that Eve should have
[1:04:39] produced so she had the
[1:04:43] opportunity to give birth to Christ the
[1:04:48] word but instead she
[1:04:51] chose to give
[1:04:53] birth to Cain
[1:04:56] the
[1:05:02] bastard Cain the
[1:05:05] mongrel
[1:05:07] Cain the
[1:05:09] hybrid can you imagine looking at those
[1:05:13] two
[1:05:15] sons and thinking that you would choose
[1:05:19] King over
[1:05:22] Christ we look at it well because every
[1:05:25] one of us are face with that same
[1:05:28] choice you see you yourself are a woman
[1:05:31] in Ty and you will e either give birth
[1:05:35] to Kain or to
[1:05:39] Christ what will be your son's
[1:05:43] name well praise the Lord if I got a
[1:05:45] choice I choose Jesus anybody in here
[1:05:49] with me I choose Jesus forget Cain I
[1:05:51] don't want no Cain no no no I didn't see
[1:05:53] what that produces so he was the seed's
[1:05:57] son the son of Life the son of Li now
[1:06:04] watch he was the seed that Eve should
[1:06:06] have produced do you get it Eve should
[1:06:10] have produced did you get it he was the
[1:06:12] seed that Eve was to produce but she
[1:06:16] hbrd it by
[1:06:19] disbelieving God's word so he was the
[1:06:24] seed
[1:06:26] do you understand Christ if Luther would
[1:06:28] have stayed with
[1:06:31] that he could have produced
[1:06:34] that Methodist could have produced it
[1:06:36] Pentecost could have produced it the
[1:06:39] early fathers of this
[1:06:41] message when many of them oh my that's
[1:06:44] why we've had so many different bride
[1:06:47] revivals and and moves and the Thunder
[1:06:49] move and the perusia move and this move
[1:06:51] and that move don't you see the same
[1:06:53] thing is going on that happened in the
[1:06:55] Garden of Eden if some of these men that
[1:06:58] were around brother brandham if they
[1:07:00] would have stayed true to the word but
[1:07:03] what did they do this and had to go off
[1:07:05] this way and build him a kingdom that
[1:07:07] had to go that way and build him one
[1:07:09] this and had to go another way and build
[1:07:11] him another they're doing exactly the
[1:07:13] same thing that Eve done in the Garden
[1:07:16] of Eden and look at their
[1:07:19] children look at the seven Thunder
[1:07:22] children I preached to some of them look
[1:07:25] at their
[1:07:27] Revival what do they have left a bunch
[1:07:30] of emotion screaming hollering shouting
[1:07:33] and many of them live lives like Devils
[1:07:36] absolutely unbelievable some of the
[1:07:39] stuff that I know about that move that's
[1:07:42] absolute
[1:07:44] filth a Baptist would not live the way
[1:07:48] some of these people around these moves
[1:07:50] live why because they are born dead they
[1:07:56] come from the womb of that
[1:07:59] move a dead
[1:08:03] child can't you see why we don't want to
[1:08:06] be raganit we don't want to be pites or
[1:08:10] Spencer ites or Ward ites or Brites we
[1:08:14] want to be holy ghost fill Sons and
[1:08:17] Daughters of
[1:08:20] God oh
[1:08:22] my Hallelujah
[1:08:24] [Applause]
[1:08:26] notice so here was oh it's it's hard for
[1:08:30] our minds to comprehend or at least mine
[1:08:33] why would anyone choose Cain over Christ
[1:08:38] so he was that that seed and the only
[1:08:42] way that life could be in the
[1:08:45] reproduction of life life had to come
[1:08:49] through that seed now remember whose
[1:08:53] seed is in itself self so God gives Adam
[1:08:58] the first seed son upon the Earth the
[1:09:02] ability not just was in his natural
[1:09:06] Anatomy but by giving him the book of
[1:09:11] redemption Adam did not contain our soul
[1:09:16] our theophany was in his body but it
[1:09:21] would have been that we would have been
[1:09:23] spoke into existence
[1:09:25] by that word
[1:09:27] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and yet
[1:09:31] instead of Adam and Eve going that way
[1:09:35] then Eve of course opted for the can
[1:09:39] route now notice life had to come
[1:09:42] through that seed and that seed had to
[1:09:46] die talking about Christ in order to
[1:09:50] spread
[1:09:51] out the life so where was that Christ
[1:09:57] Seed where was it in the Garden of
[1:10:02] Eden but brother Donnie where was it in
[1:10:05] the
[1:10:08] book and the Holy Spirit to germatize
[1:10:12] that seed word was there in the
[1:10:17] garden he's here
[1:10:19] tonight in our
[1:10:21] garden he's here to germatize the seed
[1:10:25] word
[1:10:26] inside of us if we'll let him but now
[1:10:29] remember we cannot make it live on our
[1:10:32] own our intellect our knowledge our
[1:10:35] theology will never do it there's only
[1:10:37] one way for the word to live and the
[1:10:40] spirit of God must Quicken that word and
[1:10:42] give it
[1:10:43] life notice again the holy spirit that
[1:10:46] was in the Garden of Eden was to water
[1:10:51] the seed man wasn't made to die he's
[1:10:55] made to live but hybriding brought life
[1:10:58] or he said death rather she hybrid now
[1:11:02] you now you deny the serpent seed then
[1:11:05] I'll ask
[1:11:07] you what's these funeral services
[1:11:13] about why are we having another funeral
[1:11:16] tomorrow
[1:11:20] night why are the saints of God fighting
[1:11:24] s sickness
[1:11:26] disease and some will go by the way of
[1:11:29] the
[1:11:30] Grave because even though you have the
[1:11:33] Holy Ghost in your soul your flesh is
[1:11:37] harbored oh I know you love it and some
[1:11:40] of you almost worship it and make an
[1:11:41] idol out of it it's the greatest enemy
[1:11:44] you'll ever have don't never think cuz
[1:11:47] you look in the mirror and boy you're
[1:11:49] every every woman's dream of what a
[1:11:51] woman should look like and some of you
[1:11:53] Brothers think you're you're just every
[1:11:55] a woman's greatest desire of a man look
[1:11:57] beyond that old outside thing and
[1:11:59] realize that what's looking back at you
[1:12:01] is a sorry low down rasal and ain't
[1:12:04] nothing but a hybrid and the greatest
[1:12:06] enemy you'll ever have in your life and
[1:12:09] Word of Life
[1:12:10] said amen now watch he said every one of
[1:12:14] us are hybrid from the original that's
[1:12:18] the reason we're constantly dying I love
[1:12:22] it when he says it y'all to hear him on
[1:12:24] tell but oh God God screams out
[1:12:27] something like that oh God there's a
[1:12:30] germ of life come from the real seed
[1:12:35] that God proved it was his
[1:12:38] seed he rose him up
[1:12:43] again you see it proved Oh Glory to God
[1:12:46] hallelujah that all the Old Testament
[1:12:49] prophets that lived and died but yet
[1:12:52] their bodies went to the dust of the
[1:12:55] Earth why because their body was not the
[1:12:58] seed but the Lord God raised up his son
[1:13:02] because he was the seed he proved he was
[1:13:06] the seed by resurrecting him he'll prove
[1:13:09] his sons and daughters are the seed by
[1:13:12] raising them from the dead for those of
[1:13:15] us that are alive and remaining we still
[1:13:18] living and a death bound body but he
[1:13:21] will prove who we are too by raising us
[1:13:25] from the dead on Rapture
[1:13:29] morning oh thank you Lord
[1:13:33] Jesus that through that life that's
[1:13:36] going over the Original Seed like was
[1:13:40] given to Eve over his real
[1:13:43] church it's bringing forth life again
[1:13:48] through the
[1:13:49] birst through the
[1:13:52] womb of his bride
[1:14:00] so listen to me
[1:14:05] Eve the first one was in the Garden of
[1:14:09] Eden and the serpent met her quoting the
[1:14:13] message of that
[1:14:15] day he didn't quote her Luther's gospel
[1:14:18] he didn't quoted the law of Moses but he
[1:14:21] was quoting the message pertaining to
[1:14:23] that day in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:26] so listen Eve that same old devil is
[1:14:30] still around come on somebody it ain't
[1:14:33] going to be some Church of Christ or
[1:14:35] some Nazarene that's going to try to
[1:14:37] lead away many of the message people but
[1:14:40] it has been preachers that have in part
[1:14:44] quoted the word of this day but they're
[1:14:48] very selective they pick out the parts
[1:14:50] they like well I don't think I don't
[1:14:52] think we need this I don't think what
[1:14:53] are they doing withstanding Moses again
[1:14:57] oh my well praise the
[1:14:59] Lord now notice how is it going to come
[1:15:04] it cannot be produced through the womb
[1:15:08] of denominations why listen to me
[1:15:12] they're
[1:15:15] defiled oh my that's the reason God
[1:15:19] manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus
[1:15:23] because he was the seed word The Germ
[1:15:28] word itself the seed word The Germ word
[1:15:32] itself The Germ that's inside the seed
[1:15:36] that's the life in the seed you get it
[1:15:39] he was The Germ word of God the germ is
[1:15:42] the spirit The Germ is the water and
[1:15:46] Jesus had to be broken
[1:15:49] open there in order for the seed to let
[1:15:53] force in life to water other seed which
[1:15:58] is you and I that was
[1:16:01] coming now remember the prophet in
[1:16:04] laying this out I'm still spoke a words
[1:16:06] Original Seed he's trying to convey to
[1:16:08] the people of the Brandon Tabernacle
[1:16:11] there and also to the world he said I
[1:16:15] want my brothers to know why I've
[1:16:18] preached what I preached why I've stood
[1:16:21] Where I Stood and maybe they will
[1:16:24] understand it a a little bit better now
[1:16:26] this is where he's coming from that he's
[1:16:29] sowing a seed and has SED a
[1:16:33] seed so the rain would fall on it and
[1:16:37] not produce a church not produce another
[1:16:42] isusa stre not produce another priest
[1:16:47] going up and putting the 95 thesis on
[1:16:50] the Catholic Church door but Sons and
[1:16:53] Daughters of God filled with the Holy
[1:16:54] Ghost
[1:16:56] now listen to me great words had been
[1:17:01] uttered prior to these
[1:17:03] years but when the spirit of God told
[1:17:06] him to pick up his pen and
[1:17:11] write and he said I thought God what am
[1:17:13] I going to tell him oh Lord what am I
[1:17:15] going to tell him help me to know what
[1:17:17] and he said when the spirit of God told
[1:17:19] me to pick up the pen and after I wrote
[1:17:21] it and laid the pen down and I read it
[1:17:23] he said right there it was
[1:17:25] there was the
[1:17:29] answer now the spirit of God wrote this
[1:17:33] and pick up your pen and write Malachi
[1:17:37] 4 is a gerti word of
[1:17:40] God but Malachi 4 at this
[1:17:45] time has not yet been fulfilled he
[1:17:49] said now this is
[1:17:51] March of 62 yet he had been ref
[1:17:54] referring to Malachi for for
[1:17:57] years but it was like a manifestation
[1:18:00] prophetically he was talking about it
[1:18:03] but it was awaiting a manifestation but
[1:18:06] oh it's so awesome when you go to the
[1:18:07] seals and he goes to talking about
[1:18:10] Malachi 4 and the anointing of the
[1:18:11] Elijah and all that coming back on the
[1:18:13] earth and he said I can't say too much
[1:18:15] about it cuz it's just
[1:18:19] happened so Malachi 4 behold I sent unto
[1:18:24] you Elijah the prophet oh I realize
[1:18:27] there's all types of theologians that
[1:18:28] want to explain that away from us
[1:18:31] they've done come way too late to try to
[1:18:34] take Malachi 4 away from me come on
[1:18:37] somebody amen Jesus talked about a
[1:18:39] prophet coming on the last day Malachi
[1:18:42] talked about one coming in the last day
[1:18:44] I've studied it I've looked at it for
[1:18:46] years and years I ain't found no other
[1:18:49] Ministry on the face of the earth that
[1:18:51] could ever halfway Third Way 10% way
[1:18:55] ever even match up to be able to fulfill
[1:18:59] those Prophecies of God's word come on
[1:19:02] somebody say amen and when you look not
[1:19:06] only at the signs the Wonders the
[1:19:08] supernatural but you look at the seed
[1:19:11] that he was so burdened to bring it was
[1:19:15] not to produce a following it was not to
[1:19:19] produce an organization it was not to
[1:19:21] produce and he knew he said when I'm
[1:19:24] gone these tapes will be played for
[1:19:26] Years After I'm Gone 1965 he said I see
[1:19:29] my end out there 56 so he knew he was
[1:19:32] not going to live on so what was so
[1:19:34] important to him have word that the
[1:19:38] bride coming down through the time even
[1:19:41] after he left would be able to feed on
[1:19:43] that word and the preachers would be
[1:19:45] able to preach that word waiting for the
[1:19:49] lighter
[1:19:50] rain
[1:19:53] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus now
[1:19:57] watch it's the germ that come from the
[1:20:01] sea he is the word of God made perfectly
[1:20:06] manifest he is
[1:20:09] correctly the
[1:20:11] son from the first
[1:20:13] Adam was the son that was promised
[1:20:17] through
[1:20:18] Adam to continue
[1:20:21] on the human race
[1:20:25] so Jesus was to be Adam's
[1:20:31] son I figured this had wake some of you
[1:20:33] all up even though you're deep
[1:20:37] sleepers can you
[1:20:39] imagine he was to be Adam's
[1:20:46] son
[1:20:47] Amen brother Donnie how in the
[1:20:50] world because God wanted son
[1:20:55] friendship I love the analogy that the
[1:20:58] prophet uses in future
[1:21:00] home he said he loved
[1:21:03] fatherhood so in order to become a
[1:21:06] father he had to become a
[1:21:09] [Laughter]
[1:21:11] son in order to become a father notice
[1:21:15] the title of that sermon the future home
[1:21:18] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:21:22] Earthly bride God wanted to become a
[1:21:27] human
[1:21:28] being and if Adam would have stayed in
[1:21:30] his place he would have allowed
[1:21:35] himself to be brought through the God of
[1:21:39] this
[1:21:41] Earth Lord
[1:21:43] children can't you see why that Christ
[1:21:48] seed must come through his
[1:21:51] body in the day and hour that we're
[1:21:53] living in yeah it must come through his
[1:22:00] body glory be to God
[1:22:04] hallelujah he is correctly let me read
[1:22:07] that again some looks on some of y'all's
[1:22:08] face I might not I might need to rad it
[1:22:10] and reread it the son from the first
[1:22:13] Adam was the son that was promised
[1:22:17] through Adam continue on the human race
[1:22:21] and Eve hbed to the serpent
[1:22:25] and brought forth a generation of
[1:22:28] bastard
[1:22:29] children born to
[1:22:32] death without
[1:22:36] life and Jesus come and was that seed he
[1:22:41] proved it everything Adam lost Jesus was
[1:22:45] see it he is the correct Eve would have
[1:22:49] finally brought that child forth
[1:22:55] this is why a real child of God Can Face
[1:22:59] man's greatest
[1:23:02] fear
[1:23:05] yes a son or daughter of God Can Face
[1:23:08] man's greatest fear and life at
[1:23:13] it and say to death you are not my
[1:23:18] master but I am
[1:23:21] yours come and get me and take take me
[1:23:24] across the
[1:23:26] river hallelujah hallelujah come and get
[1:23:30] me and take me across the river Glory
[1:23:34] why because they passed already from
[1:23:38] Death unto
[1:23:40] life my thank God Eve would have finally
[1:23:45] brought that child
[1:23:49] forth oh message
[1:23:53] people message
[1:23:56] people you will finally bring forth the
[1:24:00] Christ if you
[1:24:03] wait
[1:24:06] right you'll give birth to the
[1:24:10] child of your
[1:24:13] dreams if you're only
[1:24:21] wait you imagine as a woman in the
[1:24:23] garden of egyp
[1:24:25] and Eve would look and see the male the
[1:24:28] female donkey the male the female horse
[1:24:31] the male the female and no doubt the
[1:24:33] reproduction was already happening there
[1:24:35] amongst
[1:24:36] them and her looking out and seeing cuz
[1:24:38] God spoke
[1:24:40] it that everyone bring forth of its own
[1:24:42] kind so it was happening all around her
[1:24:45] except it wasn't happening to
[1:24:47] her and being a woman you see your
[1:24:50] little girls and never those little
[1:24:51] bitty tiny things playing around with
[1:24:53] baby dolls
[1:24:55] nurturing that little old thing and you
[1:24:56] know playing with that doll and talking
[1:24:58] to it and naming it and changing his
[1:24:59] diaper and feeding it and this and that
[1:25:01] and the other what is it it's that
[1:25:02] nature in that little girl of yours and
[1:25:05] there Eve was waiting waiting waiting
[1:25:08] when
[1:25:10] when oh my but she got in a
[1:25:14] hurry and Satan played upon her
[1:25:19] anxiety to bring to pass God's word
[1:25:24] she was not anxious to sin she was not
[1:25:28] anxious to defile herself she was not
[1:25:30] anxious to Forfeit her rights and
[1:25:33] hours she was anxious to fulfill her
[1:25:37] purpose what was it the prophet said God
[1:25:41] gave her to her
[1:25:43] husband to
[1:25:45] reproduce
[1:25:48] himself so she would look at
[1:25:51] him and she knew within herself was this
[1:25:54] desire to be a
[1:25:56] mother she didn't quite understand
[1:25:59] it but it was all about
[1:26:06] timing listen to me second
[1:26:09] Eve your faithfulness your Purity to the
[1:26:13] anointed word or your
[1:26:17] straying from the anointed word will be
[1:26:21] based upon one simple thing
[1:26:25] timing
[1:26:27] timing will you wait for God to fulfill
[1:26:32] his promised
[1:26:33] word or will you allow men around the
[1:26:36] message to hybridize and make a
[1:26:38] conglomeration of a little bit of
[1:26:40] Baptist and a little bit of Pentecost a
[1:26:42] little bit of this and a little bit of
[1:26:43] the message and mix it all together and
[1:26:45] what have you got a big pot full of mess
[1:26:47] I'll tell you what you got or will we
[1:26:50] wait it's one of the hardest things for
[1:26:52] human beings to do ain't it we got
[1:26:55] instant mashed potatoes we got push
[1:26:57] button microwaves we got push button
[1:26:59] cell phone we got Siri everywhere we got
[1:27:02] Alexa everywhere I mean my we want
[1:27:04] something from Amazon within order it
[1:27:06] within three hours you'll be get it
[1:27:07] tomorrow and that's the way we want the
[1:27:09] rapturing faith that's why we want our
[1:27:11] walk with God we want all seven virtues
[1:27:13] and we want to by least Sunday morning
[1:27:15] please if you don't mind Lord put me at
[1:27:17] the head of the list and God knows that
[1:27:19] and Satan knows
[1:27:20] it Sarah wanted to be a mother so bad
[1:27:25] and by her desire she bypassed God's
[1:27:28] program God never said Abraham oh my
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:35] Hagar but she got ahead of the program
[1:27:38] of
[1:27:40] God oh
[1:27:43] my Eve would have finally brought forth
[1:27:46] that child notice this now on page 32
[1:27:50] now what happened here's the word God
[1:27:52] that spoke the word to multiply and
[1:27:54] replenish the Earth it couldn't find a
[1:27:58] place to
[1:28:01] land finally this word caught into the
[1:28:05] womb of a
[1:28:08] virgin so Satan tricked
[1:28:12] Eve with the
[1:28:15] timing and what felt like her great
[1:28:18] desire that was motivating her friends
[1:28:22] look at what a demon that we are dealing
[1:28:25] with that will play on our very
[1:28:29] desire to have a move of
[1:28:32] God to have a
[1:28:34] Revival we saw it didn't we brother
[1:28:36] Larry oh we saw it so much in Pentecost
[1:28:39] people hungered and CRA if you've got in
[1:28:41] your mind a lot them Pentecostal people
[1:28:43] was a bunch of idiots and a bunch of
[1:28:45] ignoramuses and they didn't want no move
[1:28:47] of God that shows you never was around
[1:28:49] some of the ones that we was around cuz
[1:28:51] some of them people wanted to move a God
[1:28:53] I'm talking about they would say 7 Days
[1:28:55] 10 days 14 days I've done it myself it's
[1:28:58] a week he can't even hardly walk go put
[1:29:00] up tents and and and preach and fast and
[1:29:03] pray till you're so weak you think
[1:29:04] you're about to die why because I
[1:29:07] looking for Devils because I was looking
[1:29:09] to be something I wanted God I wanted
[1:29:12] God to come on the scene that's why I
[1:29:14] was doing it that's why I did it that's
[1:29:17] why I spent years and oh my running on
[1:29:19] the road and preach 30 something nights
[1:29:21] in a row one time down in Louisiana
[1:29:22] close out down there go Indiana the next
[1:29:24] night be up there and then record an
[1:29:26] album after that meting was over 30 some
[1:29:28] days in a row why was I doing that
[1:29:31] because I was hungry for
[1:29:34] God but what did I settle for bunch of
[1:29:38] jumping running screaming holling
[1:29:41] walking the backs of pews come on don't
[1:29:44] tell me that wasn't
[1:29:48] Supernatural don't tell me I didn't see
[1:29:50] things that weren't Supernatural didn't
[1:29:52] we hey some of you that was in p because
[1:29:54] you saw some real genuine things and it
[1:29:57] wasn't that they was looking for demons
[1:30:00] they was not saying oh Satan come Satan
[1:30:03] come and bewitch us all know they was
[1:30:05] praying and calling on the name of the
[1:30:10] Lord but Satan slipped in a
[1:30:14] mongrel a
[1:30:16] hybridized
[1:30:19] something now watch this and the spoken
[1:30:21] word Again original see that's why
[1:30:24] what's the matter with the Pentecostals
[1:30:26] today they're manufacturing
[1:30:29] something they can't
[1:30:33] wait oh God they just can't
[1:30:37] wait so they commit
[1:30:41] adultery amen
[1:30:43] tears to manufacture something what does
[1:30:47] it bring Force like it did the first
[1:30:50] time the first bride they couldn't wait
[1:30:54] she brought death through a bastard born
[1:30:59] child which we
[1:31:03] all are children
[1:31:06] of so when you look in the morning sis
[1:31:09] and think I pretty you are in the mirror

[1:31:14] yours and flex your
[1:31:17] bustles call yourself what you are don't
[1:31:20] cuss but here's a quote you know
[1:31:25] [Laughter]

[1:31:34] a whole lot different come on we baby it
[1:31:38] we Pat
[1:31:42] it some of you men PRM in front of a
[1:31:45] mirror for 45 minutes what in the
[1:31:48] world you apparently see something about
[1:31:51] yourself that I sure don't see about me
[1:31:54] my nose is crooked cuz I broke it when I
[1:31:56] was in PE and jumped on a trampoline and
[1:31:58] broke my nose my ears is big and floppy
[1:32:01] and my hair is ugly I don't know why in
[1:32:04] the world Carol even married
[1:32:07] me you want me start on you now brother
[1:32:15] Timothy
[1:32:17] Hallelujah Y'all Scared death think you
[1:32:19] want me to dismiss right
[1:32:21] now now watch
[1:32:24] oh thank you Lord but God Came In the
[1:32:29] Flesh to give us another
[1:32:32] birth to bring us back to original Sons
[1:32:37] and Daughters of
[1:32:39] God see there you are the life sperm of
[1:32:44] Eve never happened it never did why she
[1:32:48] mingled it and kept it away you see what
[1:32:52] happens friends when we h
[1:32:54] abiz and it don't take that much all we
[1:32:57] have to do is add just a little
[1:33:00] bit of Le to see into this
[1:33:03] message we just got to add a little bit
[1:33:06] of modernism just a little bit to make
[1:33:10] it go over a little bit better let's
[1:33:12] just leave out some of these quotes like
[1:33:14] I've read here tonight with all this
[1:33:15] plain flat talk and brother Donnie but
[1:33:18] oh my goodness you know that that that
[1:33:20] that could really be offensive I know it
[1:33:21] can be offensive it's intended to be
[1:33:24] sometimes you got to get us a little bit
[1:33:26] angry at the Devil angry at herself
[1:33:29] angry at the world that we're in to
[1:33:31] realize there's only one way out of here
[1:33:34] that's a new birst
[1:33:36] amen oh
[1:33:41] my instead of Adam coming to her for a
[1:33:46] bride when the time appointed would
[1:33:50] be just like Christ would have come to
[1:33:52] the group Christ would have come to his
[1:33:54] church he promised to do
[1:33:58] it God promised to
[1:34:01] multiply but they had to wait until
[1:34:03] God's
[1:34:05] time that's what's a matter
[1:34:08] today they don't want to
[1:34:11] wait God's
[1:34:13] time so the sperm of Eve never happened
[1:34:17] hybrid to Satan's
[1:34:19] lie his lovely bride became polluted
[1:34:25] and so has
[1:34:28] Christ's
[1:34:31] bre the bride what made her become
[1:34:34] polluted Adam's bride now because she
[1:34:36] never stayed with God's
[1:34:38] word listen this quote is absolutely
[1:34:40] astounding to me the reason that Adam's
[1:34:44] bride never did Bear
[1:34:46] right the life
[1:34:50] child the life child
[1:34:55] is because she
[1:34:58] disbelieved God's
[1:35:02] word is that right say amen amen
[1:35:07] congregation
[1:35:08] replies amen congregation replies amen
[1:35:14] congregation replies
[1:35:17] amen congregation
[1:35:22] replies the reason and Jehovah's wife
[1:35:24] was put away or his
[1:35:28] bride was because she rejected God's
[1:35:32] word the
[1:35:43] prophet it's a serious thing
[1:35:47] friends it's a serious thing when we go
[1:35:49] to rejecting the teaching of God's
[1:35:52] Vindicated servant
[1:35:54] amen that's one of his laws remember you
[1:35:57] can only serve God on Earth as those who
[1:36:01] are ordained and Vindicated and sent by
[1:36:04] God come down on the earth and interpret
[1:36:07] God's word to
[1:36:14] you she rejected God's word the prophet
[1:36:18] is that right the reason that Christ
[1:36:22] bride oh my goodness you mean there's
[1:36:25] people that are actually called
[1:36:30] bride don't you'all remember me praying
[1:36:33] that preaching that to you years and
[1:36:34] years ago the rejected
[1:36:37] bride oh it's been my goodness I don't
[1:36:39] even know how many years ago it's been I
[1:36:41] preached it over North Carolina at a
[1:36:42] meeting over there I thought some of
[1:36:44] them preachers was going to die of
[1:36:45] Suffocation I mean they whenever I took
[1:36:47] the message and took the scripture and
[1:36:49] showed them that there is a category of
[1:36:50] people called the rejected
[1:36:54] bride just because you're called bride
[1:36:57] don't mean you'll ever be called
[1:37:01] wife in Revelation his bride his wife
[1:37:06] has made herself ready I don't want to
[1:37:09] just be bride I want to be
[1:37:13] wife come on children yes there's been
[1:37:16] all kinds of Ages that bride could be
[1:37:19] attached to them by association but
[1:37:21] before he could ever get to knew them
[1:37:24] Eve was Adam's bride but he never knew
[1:37:27] her as his wife until after she was with
[1:37:35] child
[1:37:39] mom Christ's bride is put
[1:37:43] away in divorcement because she has
[1:37:46] rejected the word of God like Eve did
[1:37:49] like the rest of them did exactly all
[1:37:53] all
[1:37:55] all polluted their husband
[1:37:59] couldn't get to them it was already
[1:38:02] pregnated before their husband got to
[1:38:05] them oh God I don't think I've ever
[1:38:08] heard a tape of all the ones that I've
[1:38:10] listened to to where he coins this term
[1:38:13] and uses it so many times in one sermon
[1:38:16] this is a six-hour sermon he preaches it
[1:38:18] on Sunday morning divides their break
[1:38:19] for lunch and come back Sunday evening
[1:38:21] and preaches it again but where just
[1:38:24] there's just something here about it's
[1:38:26] hit him in a way to realize where he's
[1:38:29] at to realize where the church is at to
[1:38:30] realize where the bride is the
[1:38:32] responsibility that he's got it must
[1:38:33] have been a tremendous thing to be able
[1:38:35] to deliver but also knowing there'd be
[1:38:37] people around the world that would turn
[1:38:39] him down like never before after he
[1:38:41] preach this and that sounds like a
[1:38:43] deceiver to
[1:38:45] you if he's want deceive more people
[1:38:48] compromise leave this out don't say that
[1:38:50] don't say them things that'll get you
[1:38:52] hated don't say them things that people
[1:38:54] will turn away from
[1:38:58] you oh God if that ain't a pitiful sight
[1:39:02] think of a young man coming to a woman
[1:39:06] and find her with seed of some other man
[1:39:09] in her what a saying that's what God
[1:39:12] done that's what Adam done that's what
[1:39:15] Christ has
[1:39:17] done do you understand that same thing
[1:39:20] has happened in our own
[1:39:22] ranks some of the people that were
[1:39:24] called out by the message of Malachi 4
[1:39:25] and Paul said I have jealousy over you
[1:39:28] as a Godly jealousy but I fear less as
[1:39:31] the serpent who beguiled Eve you know
[1:39:32] would corrupt you from the Simplicity
[1:39:34] which is in Christ why in the world
[1:39:36] would he fear why would he fear he said
[1:39:38] I have begotten you because them people
[1:39:41] he was writing to was a begotten
[1:39:43] bride but they were not wife right
[1:39:47] that's the most dangerous time after the
[1:39:49] begettal
[1:39:51] will she stay faithful during the time
[1:39:54] of the betral generally lasted about a
[1:40:00] year so Paul had betroll them to Christ
[1:40:04] but he said I
[1:40:06] fear but he said I desire to presentent
[1:40:11] you so the betral is a separate Deed
[1:40:16] from the
[1:40:19] presentation all the people in this age
[1:40:21] that hate God's prophet boy are they
[1:40:23] going to be awful awful sad and weeping
[1:40:26] and crying on that day when they walk up
[1:40:27] before the Judgment seat and standing
[1:40:30] there by the judge will be the message
[1:40:33] preacher and message people and God's
[1:40:35] Prophet sending there to judge them so
[1:40:37] all their YouTube posts all their videos
[1:40:40] all their books that they've written all
[1:40:42] this and that and the other will be
[1:40:43] flashed right across the screen and
[1:40:45] there they'll be with their lies and
[1:40:47] their false charges and accusations come
[1:40:49] on
[1:40:50] somebody and it'll be there to meet them
[1:40:53] oh oh my think of it Paul said I fear
[1:40:58] I'm afraid for you all why because you
[1:41:01] could be in a spouse bride and become
[1:41:06] pregnant that's what every one of these
[1:41:08] man-made moves whether it come from New
[1:41:10] York or from Trinidad or from Ohio or
[1:41:15] all the different places that it's come
[1:41:17] from South Africa here and there and
[1:41:19] there wherever it's come from including
[1:41:22] Jeffersonville and every one of these
[1:41:24] things watch it after it's to pull a
[1:41:26] bride a people that have been espoused

[1:42:42] predestinated she don't have to worry
