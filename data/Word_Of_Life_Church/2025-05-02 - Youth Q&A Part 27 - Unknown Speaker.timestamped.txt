[9:38] praise tonight? You happy to
[9:42] be Amen. There's no prayer request, but
[9:45] Brother Jonathan, if you would invite
[9:47] the Lord here tonight.
[9:48] [Music]
[9:56] Let's pray. Lord Jesus, thank you for uh
[10:00] this day, Lord, and just the honor of
[10:02] being able to live for you another day
[10:04] and to come together and spend this time
[10:06] with you. And we could be young people
[10:09] anywhere else, but Father, you've
[10:10] allowed us, Lord, you've ordained us to
[10:12] be here, Lord. And we're just so
[10:14] grateful for that. We pray that you
[10:16] would bless our pastor as he comes and
[10:18] brings these answers that you've led him
[10:21] to find in your word and that it would
[10:23] just be the answer in our hearts, Lord,
[10:25] to draw us closer to you, Lord. And
[10:27] that's what we want, not not to just
[10:30] show what we know, Lord, but truly just
[10:32] to know you better. We just pray that
[10:33] you bless this evening in Jesus Christ's
[10:35] name.
[10:38] Amen. Amen. Amen. He's my champion of
[10:42] love. Amen. as we sing that
[10:47] tonight. Now,
[10:49] ladies and
[10:51] gentlemen, may I have your
[10:57] attention? I would like to
[11:01] introduce to you.
[11:06] Oh, in this
[11:09] corner of the good and the
[11:13] [Music]
[11:15] right. Oh, stands a champion rolled in
[11:23] wide. His height exceeds the
[11:27] heavens. His weight outweighs the
[11:32] world. His
[11:34] reach reach is
[11:37] everywhere and his
[11:40] age is ever
[11:45] more. He is higher than the
[11:50] highest. He's greater than the
[11:54] great. No one will ever take his crown
[12:00] away.
[12:04] He's more mighty than the
[12:08] mightiest and he reigns from
[12:14] above. He's the
[12:18] alltime
[12:20] undisputed,
[12:22] undefeated
[12:24] champion of love.
[12:29] Now he left his
[12:33] hometown
[12:34] to this
[12:37] [Music]
[12:38] arena to raise his hands in
[12:43] victory for you and
[12:46] me. As an angry crowd cried,
[12:51] "Crucify this king who wore their
[12:55] crown."
[12:56] [Music]
[12:58] And they gladly watch my
[13:01] champion going
[13:04] down. Oh, but I will never count him
[13:10] out. For I'm a witness
[13:14] of that day he rose to reclaim the title
[13:20] chair.
[13:24] of
[13:27] love. He is higher than the
[13:32] highest. He's greater than the
[13:37] grave. No one will ever take his crown
[13:45] away. And he's more mighty than the
[13:51] mightiest. for he reigns from
[13:57] above. He's the
[14:00] alltime
[14:03] undisputed,
[14:05] undefeated
[14:07] champion of
[14:10] love. Oh, he's the
[14:14] alltime
[14:16] undisputed,
[14:18] undefeated
[14:21] champion of
[14:28] love. Amen. He knows my name. As brother
[14:31] Donnie would uh take the platform
[14:34] [Music]
[14:37] tonight. We count the stars. one and
[14:41] all. He knows how much sand is on the
[14:46] shores. He sees every sparrow that
[14:53] [Music]
[14:54] falls. He made the mountains and the
[14:59] seas. He's in control of
[15:04] everything, of all creatures, great and
[15:08] small.
[15:10] And he knows my
[15:13] name. Every step that I
[15:17] take, every move that I
[15:22] make, every tear that I'll
[15:27] cry. He knows my name.
[15:31] When I'm overwhelmed by the
[15:34] pain and can't see the light of
[15:39] day, I know I'll be just
[15:44] fine. Cuz he knows my
[15:52] name. I don't know what tomorrow may
[15:56] bring.
[15:58] I can't tell you what's in
[16:01] store. I don't know a lot of
[16:09] things. I don't have all the answers to
[16:14] the questions of life.
[16:19] But I know in whom I have
[16:24] believed that he knows my
[16:28] name. Every step that I take. Aren't you
[16:32] glad of that? Every move that I
[16:37] make, every tear that I'll
[16:41] cry. And he knows my name.
[16:46] When I'm overwhelmed by the
[16:50] pain and I can't see the light of
[16:54] day, I know I'll be just
[16:59] fine. Cuz he knows my name.
[17:04] Every step that I
[17:08] take, every move that I
[17:12] make, every tear that I
[17:17] cry, he knows my name. When I'm
[17:22] overwhelmed by the
[17:25] pain, can't see the light of
[17:30] day, I know I'll be
[17:35] [Music]
[17:40] just. Aren't you glad he
[17:43] does? And he knows what you have need of
[17:45] here
[17:46] tonight. You have a sickness.
[17:50] You have a depression in your spirit, a
[17:53] sadness, a question maybe that you don't
[17:57] have the answer
[17:58] to. He's so big and so awesome that he
[18:02] holds all this
[18:03] universe by the power of his words. And
[18:07] yet us little small minute creatures on
[18:10] the earth. And he knows every one of us.
[18:14] He knows our faults, our flaws, our
[18:17] shortcomings.
[18:19] That's wonderful. That makes him great.
[18:21] But to me, what makes him great, even
[18:24] greater than that, is he can love us
[18:27] with all of those faults and those
[18:29] flaws. And he doesn't just see us as we
[18:32] currently are in our crippled up state
[18:36] spiritually, but he knows what we will
[18:39] be when time is over. It's a privilege
[18:42] for us to be gathered together tonight,
[18:44] isn't it? Anybody got a request on your
[18:46] heart before we pray? just like to raise
[18:48] your hand there before the
[18:50] Lord. Heavenly Father, we believe these
[18:53] words that we have sung tonight are not
[18:55] just a nice melody and put together by
[19:00] someone who wrote the song and made it
[19:03] sound very pretty, but we believe it's a
[19:06] great fundamental truth that we as your
[19:09] people hold dear to our hearts.
[19:13] before the foundation of the world, you
[19:16] knew what man would
[19:17] choose. And as we looked at it last
[19:20] night that Paul said, "You who were rich
[19:24] became poor that we through your poverty
[19:28] might be made rich."
[19:31] And of course, we know he wasn't just
[19:33] talking about you didn't have houses or
[19:36] lands or cattle or gold or
[19:40] silver, but you were made
[19:43] poor and that you come to the earth and
[19:46] you were born a human being like
[19:49] us without
[19:51] God in your
[19:54] soul. Hallelujah.
[19:58] And you become that because that's the
[20:00] way we all would be
[20:02] born. We were poor. We were lost as we
[20:06] would say
[20:07] and
[20:09] seemingly beyond
[20:11] redemption. But you become poor in that
[20:14] you walked on this earth for 30 years.
[20:18] For 30 years.
[20:20] and until your baptism that day when the
[20:23] father came inside you and you become a
[20:28] rich
[20:29] man. So we Lord, some of us were 12,
[20:32] some maybe 25, some
[20:35] 30. We were in this world and we had
[20:38] nothing but you called us to yourself,
[20:42] filled us with your life, your goodness,
[20:44] and your mercy. And since that moment,
[20:48] we have been some of the wealthiest
[20:50] people on the earth. And for that, we
[20:53] are grateful. We might not have $20 in
[20:56] our wallet tonight or these sisters in
[20:59] their purse, but if we have you, we are
[21:03] the richest people on the face of the
[21:06] earth. We've come again tonight, Lord,
[21:09] that we could be enriched again by your
[21:13] presence and by your word. For we know
[21:16] that we understand you greater as you
[21:19] quicken our hearts to your word. So
[21:22] speak to us tonight. Would you Lord help
[21:23] me to get out of the way? Speak through
[21:26] me the words of life. I pray in the name
[21:29] of
[21:30] Jesus.
[21:32] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[21:35] We're calling this questions and
[21:38] answers, but for several services, it's
[21:42] been one question and many answers. And
[21:46] tonight, it's going to be the same
[21:47] question with more answers. So maybe
[21:51] we'll eventually get off this one
[21:52] question, but I'm not ready in any hurry
[21:55] because the more I study this, the more
[21:58] it has been such a blessing to me. You
[22:02] can remain uh standing there and I'll
[22:04] read the question and then we'll go
[22:06] straight into the scripture. Can you
[22:09] explain why brother Brandham is a
[22:11] vindicated prophet and why the message
[22:15] is correct? I have a difficult time
[22:20] speaking to why I believe what I
[22:24] believe. I have a difficult time
[22:27] speaking to why I believe what I
[22:30] believe. God bless you. You may be
[22:34] seated. No doubt we're probably more
[22:37] misunderstood because of this general
[22:39] concept of what the consensus of this
[22:42] question is over this over a lot of the
[22:46] things that we do believe. because it
[22:48] seems so strange to many Christians in
[22:52] this day when you would talk about a
[22:54] prophet. But yet, as I've looked back
[22:57] through the Bible and uh looking at this
[23:00] question and seeing all the scriptures
[23:03] and the verses that refer to prophet,
[23:08] prophets, prophecy, prophetic, and all
[23:11] of these different words, it really
[23:14] makes me wonder um why more people
[23:17] actually don't believe in a prophet
[23:19] because it's all through the scripture.
[23:22] So I'd like to begin tonight with 1st
[23:24] Samuel chapter 3 verse 1. Now this is a
[23:27] special dispensation here where we will
[23:30] begin reading because it had come from
[23:33] the time of Abraham and had come from
[23:35] the time of Moses and it was kind of a
[23:38] different time for the children of
[23:40] Israel and they were crying and seeking
[23:44] God and reaching out to the Lord. And
[23:46] you remember the life of course of
[23:48] Samuel how that his mother was desiring
[23:51] a child and God answered that prayer and
[23:55] 1st Samuel 3:1 and the child Samuel
[23:59] ministered unto the Lord before Eli and
[24:02] the word of the Lord was precious in
[24:06] those days. Now listen why the word of
[24:09] the Lord was precious in those days and
[24:13] this is the reason why it was. There was
[24:16] no open vision. No open vision. Now
[24:22] remember they already had writings of of
[24:26] the Torah. So they done had the Ten
[24:30] Commandments. They had various things
[24:32] that they could read. So why was the
[24:35] word of the Lord precious in those days?
[24:38] Well, actually it's for the same reason
[24:40] that it was in our day because God had
[24:43] given them the law. And what did the law
[24:46] contain? Thou shalt not. Thou shalt not.
[24:49] Thou shalt not. If you do this, I'll do
[24:52] this. But if you don't obey my word,
[24:54] I'll cast you out of the land. I'll
[24:56] curse you. I'll turn all your enemies
[24:59] against you. So on and so on and so on.
[25:01] So, they needed something that would
[25:04] help them in the hour that they were
[25:07] currently living. Now, they did not do
[25:09] away with the Torah, which is the first
[25:11] five books of Moses. They didn't now
[25:13] once Samuel's going to become the
[25:15] prophet of God, they didn't say, "We
[25:17] don't we don't any longer even need
[25:19] that." But it was like there was a cry
[25:22] in their hearts that God had something
[25:25] more for them. Not to do away with what
[25:28] they already had. But it seemed that
[25:31] there was something that God wanted to
[25:33] refresh the truth of the hour of where
[25:37] they were. I love the meanings of this
[25:39] words that the author of the book of
[25:41] Samuel wrote. And the child Samuel
[25:44] ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And
[25:47] the word of the Lord was precious in
[25:49] those days. There was no open vision.
[25:53] Now look at the word open. What it means
[25:56] to break
[25:57] through. Burst out to break
[26:03] open. So something had to come open. So
[26:07] the word of the Lord was precious in
[26:09] those days because there was no
[26:13] breakthrough of a vision from God. And
[26:17] look at the word vision. It means in a
[26:21] static state,
[26:24] oracle,
[26:25] prophecy, divine
[26:29] communication. But now wait a minute.
[26:30] They done had Genesis, Exodus,
[26:33] Leviticus, Numbers, rather, Leviticus,
[26:36] Deuteronomy, five great books. My, it
[26:38] was wonderful the things that they had
[26:41] historically. They already had some
[26:42] different things of what God had done by
[26:45] their forefathers. Why in the world are
[26:47] they needing more? Why would they be
[26:49] hungering and thirsting and we know that
[26:51] the deep calls to the deep? So, there
[26:53] must have been something more for them
[26:55] or they would have never hungered for
[26:57] it. You agree with that? I'm sure if
[26:59] they had everything they needed, then
[27:01] they could have just reread the same
[27:03] books that their forefathers had read
[27:05] before and it would have given them
[27:08] everything that they needed. But somehow
[27:11] it's as if though they sensed in their
[27:13] spirits that God had something more that
[27:17] he wanted to make known to them. And
[27:19] truly, it was a change of dispensation.
[27:22] Now, remember, Eli was a priest and he
[27:25] had some sons. And I'm telling you right
[27:27] now, them boys was bad boys. They was
[27:29] not following in the line of their
[27:31] father. They was not following in the
[27:33] line of the Torah. And they were just
[27:35] totally rebellious. They was taking
[27:37] bribes. It was awful the way these guys
[27:40] were living. And Hannah brought her
[27:42] little her little boy. I mean, like 2
[27:44] years old. You imagine this woman takes
[27:47] her little boy two years old when he's
[27:49] weaned and and brings him there to the
[27:52] house of God and said I told God if he'd
[27:54] give me a son I'd give him back to him.
[27:57] So here she brings her little boy into
[28:00] the presence of God. God had a reason
[28:02] for that. So Samuel was reared under the
[28:05] oposes of the presence of God. Not but
[28:09] not with a prophetic understanding only
[28:12] priest priestly mentality. So it was
[28:16] worship it was sacrifice it was
[28:19] methodical over and over and over again
[28:22] you do the same thing you pray the same
[28:24] way you say the same prayers you offer
[28:26] the same sacrifice but there was no open
[28:29] vision. So there was no estasy there was
[28:33] no astatic move of God. It was totally
[28:38] methodical. So if you missed three
[28:40] weeks, you hadn't really missed anything
[28:42] cuz they're going to do the same thing
[28:44] over and over again. But yet here Samuel
[28:47] had a call that was beyond a priesthood.
[28:51] He probably didn't even know what it was
[28:52] for many years. So there was a hunger.
[28:55] There was a thirst. And what was
[28:57] precious was the ability for someone to
[29:01] receive the open word of God to have a
[29:05] breakthrough or a burst out or a break
[29:09] open. Now let's read again Proverbs 29
[29:14] verse
[29:15] 18. Where there is no vision, the people
[29:21] perish. Now listen again to the meanings
[29:23] of this words. I mentioned this to you
[29:25] the last time that we had this uh
[29:27] question answer is that so many people
[29:29] this is a very common scripture that is
[29:31] used especially among the charismatics
[29:34] and those of this modern day and you'll
[29:36] see this all the time on a lot of
[29:37] websites as well and they quote this
[29:40] really without even knowing what it even
[29:42] means and they'll they'll they'll use
[29:44] this as their vision where there is no
[29:46] vision the people perish but let's
[29:49] actually read it in the way that it's
[29:52] written again It's the very same word
[29:56] that we read in the book of Samuel. So
[29:58] the word vision there is vision in a
[30:01] static state oracle or prophecy divine
[30:07] communication. So what are we talking
[30:09] about then? When there is no ability for
[30:14] divine communication from the earth to
[30:18] heaven and from heaven back to the
[30:21] earth, the people perish. And then they
[30:25] make fun of us and laugh at us because
[30:27] we say we need a prophet. Well, here the
[30:31] children of Israel were in that same
[30:33] state and they needed a divine channel
[30:37] of communication. Now I know you know
[30:40] this but let me say it to you again. I
[30:42] cannot be this type of a position.
[30:46] Neither can any other evangelist in the
[30:48] message, any other teacher in the
[30:50] message, any other great great ministry.
[30:54] This is only through one fold of God's
[30:57] chosen ministry and that is a prophet.
[31:01] Now this is where it stumbles people.
[31:03] And the prophet tells us in the church
[31:05] age book that the power of
[31:08] infallibility would be restored in the
[31:11] last day. Now remember, no individual
[31:15] has that power of infallibility on their
[31:19] own. It's given to people when God will
[31:22] give it to them. And it only comes to
[31:25] one office and that is a prophet. And
[31:28] this is the reason why where there is no
[31:31] vision the people perish. Listen what
[31:35] they will do. Let
[31:37] loose,
[31:39] avoid,
[31:41] neglect, be
[31:43] loosened of
[31:45] restraint. Boy, if that don't describe
[31:47] the Leodysian church age. So what have
[31:51] they done? They have let loose of all
[31:54] standards. They don't know what a woman
[31:57] is anymore. They don't know what a man
[32:00] is. They don't know what's right, what's
[32:03] wrong, what's truth, what's error, what
[32:06] church is why right, what preacher is
[32:08] right. Why? You see, we would be exactly
[32:12] the same way if God had not sent us one
[32:16] that had the ability to catch vision.
[32:20] Now you see when God chose to go this
[32:23] way, he knew that it would only be just
[32:27] in certain seasons that he would do it.
[32:29] There would be many, many more priests
[32:32] than the wood prophets. In this modern
[32:35] day, there will be multiplied thousands
[32:38] of pastors. A lot of them true, a lot of
[32:40] them not. A lot of them that would be
[32:42] claimed to be apostles or teachers or so
[32:45] on. But God knew he don't need thousands
[32:48] of prophets. Actually, all he needs is
[32:51] one for a church age messenger. That one
[32:54] can catch the divine communication from
[32:58] God for what God has for that church
[33:02] age. And then all the others that are
[33:04] God called will go out from under that
[33:07] man's ministry and they will preach what
[33:10] he got directly from God. To me, it's as
[33:13] beautiful and as simple as it can be.
[33:16] But without a vision, the people perish
[33:21] again. They perish. They let loose. They
[33:24] become a void. They neglect to be
[33:28] loosened of restraint. Now, we're going
[33:31] to stick mainly tonight with the
[33:33] scripture. I want to do this so you'll
[33:35] know and anybody else that will stream
[33:38] this that we are a Biblebased church.
[33:42] And this message is a
[33:45] Biblebased message. That is not
[33:47] someone's opinion. We can prove what we
[33:51] believe by the Bible. And the youth said
[33:55] 1st Samuel
[33:57] 28:6. When Saul inquired of the Lord,
[34:01] the Lord answered him not. Now notice
[34:04] the dispensation where they are in the
[34:08] way that divine communication could come
[34:11] to an individual like a king. So when
[34:14] Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord
[34:16] answered him not, neither by
[34:19] dreams nor by
[34:22] urum nor by prophets. Now the dreams of
[34:26] course is in the subconscious to where
[34:28] God would be able to project. It would
[34:30] be what they would call a dream or a
[34:32] night vision. And it would be not in
[34:35] symbolism where it would need to be
[34:37] interpreted, but it would be a dream
[34:40] that would be plain and simple and would
[34:43] not need someone else to interpret it.
[34:45] Or urum. Y'all remember what the urum
[34:49] thumbum is? Well, it was the breastplate
[34:51] that God gave Moses the direction to
[34:54] make. It was to be worn upon the high
[34:57] priest. So he would take so many stones
[35:00] up on what? Up the left side and up the
[35:03] right side. It was actually the
[35:05] birthstones of the tribes of the
[35:07] children of Israel. Now whenever they
[35:10] would question about a certain thing,
[35:12] they're going to fight a fight against
[35:13] the Philistines and they would ask the
[35:16] Lord. So the breastplate would be there
[35:18] upon the priest and they would say to
[35:20] the Lord, "Lord, shall we go up against
[35:23] the Philistines?" And God chose a way
[35:27] without a prophet being there. And by
[35:30] answering this, so a supernatural light
[35:32] would come and strike those stones on
[35:36] the high priest. So it would start
[35:38] flashing up and down and those lights
[35:41] would merge together and make a pattern
[35:44] of a rainbow. And they would know that
[35:47] was an answer from God. You know why?
[35:50] They didn't have no electricity in them
[35:52] days. They didn't have no LED lights. So
[35:55] God
[35:56] supernaturally lit the birthstones and
[36:00] it would go up and down, up and down.
[36:01] Then they'd say, "Okay, so shall Judah
[36:04] go forth first? Shall Issachar?" So
[36:07] they'd call one name after another after
[36:09] another. Whichever tribe God wanted to
[36:12] go first, and they would call a tribal
[36:14] name, and they'd give a pause, and they
[36:17] would say, "Ruben, nothing." They would
[36:20] say it's a car, nothing. And then they'd
[36:23] say Judah. And if Judah was God's choice
[36:26] after the name, the light supernatural
[36:29] would
[36:30] come like that again. And they knew
[36:32] Judah was to lead the charge. So Saul
[36:36] had sought God and he'd asked about a
[36:39] dream. Nothing. So it went before the
[36:42] UM.
[36:46] And also God's other way of
[36:49] communication was prophets. No dream, no
[36:53] answer by flashing lights, no
[36:56] prophets. Notice again verse 15. And
[37:00] Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast thou
[37:03] disqued me?" Now you remember the
[37:05] setting that the witch of
[37:07] Endor actually was able to go down into
[37:12] paradise.
[37:14] And I don't want to go over your head
[37:15] with this, but the blood of Jesus had
[37:17] not been shed yet. So the souls of the
[37:21] righteous did not go up, they went down.
[37:25] So it was next door to the regions of
[37:28] the lost, a place called paradise.
[37:33] So this witch was abled by her spirit to
[37:37] go down and pull up and summons the
[37:41] spirit of
[37:43] Samuel and actually calls Samuel out.
[37:47] And he appeared in a visible form in so
[37:50] much that Saul looked right at him and
[37:53] he knew who he was. And this witch
[37:57] screamed and she said, "You are King
[38:01] Saul." because Saul had ordered that all
[38:03] witches be
[38:05] killed. So this woman by demonic power
[38:09] was able to call the prophet and Saul
[38:13] looked at him and Samuel still was a
[38:16] prophet because he prophesied and said
[38:20] by this time tomorrow you and your sons
[38:24] will be with me.
[38:27] Now sing. God chose this way. And Saul
[38:31] answered and said, "I am sore
[38:33] distressed. For the Philistines make war
[38:36] against me, and God is departed from me,
[38:39] and answerest me no more, neither by
[38:43] prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore have
[38:46] I called thee, that thou mayest make
[38:49] known unto me what I shall do." Now this
[38:54] is the way Israel was founded upon this
[38:58] basis that they believe God used
[39:02] prophets and Christianity is supposed to
[39:05] be on what we classify
[39:09] Judeo-Christian. But how many Christians
[39:11] today don't even believe in prophets?
[39:14] You know why? They're not on the
[39:16] Judeo-Christian foundation. So they look
[39:19] at us and think, "Why in the world would
[39:21] you believe in prophets?" And we look
[39:22] back at them and say, "Why in the world
[39:24] wouldn't you not believe in prophets?"
[39:26] What I don't understand is they all
[39:29] believe according to Matthew
[39:31] 24:24 that there will be false
[39:35] prophets. But we're some of the own the
[39:37] very few that believe in order to be
[39:40] false. There's got to be a real one
[39:42] somewhere. Amen. If not, the false ones
[39:46] would be the real ones. Is that right?
[39:50] Now watch. 2 Kings
[39:52] 17:13. Yet the Lord testified against
[39:56] Israel and against Judah, notice his
[40:00] channel, by all the prophets, and by all
[40:05] the
[40:06] seers, saying, "Turn ye from your evil
[40:09] ways, and keep my commandments and my
[40:12] statutes according to the law, which I
[40:14] commanded your fathers, and which I sent
[40:16] to you by my servants, the prophets."
[40:21] One of the true signs of a prophet of
[40:24] God, he will always point to people back
[40:29] to God's word, never to
[40:33] himself. A true prophet will never form
[40:38] an anti-word movement. He will never
[40:41] lead people to follow him. He will point
[40:45] the people right back to the word.
[40:49] Notice again in verse 23, until the Lord
[40:52] removed Israel out of his sight, as he
[40:56] had said, notice how God
[41:00] talked as he had
[41:03] said by all his servants, the prophets.
[41:08] So if God was going to say
[41:12] anything, he said it by prophets.
[41:18] Why is this so hard for people to grasp?
[41:20] It's right in their
[41:22] Bible. As he said by all his servants,
[41:26] the prophets, "So was Israel carried
[41:30] away out of their own
[41:33] land to
[41:35] Assyria unto this day."
[41:38] You see, true prophets not only spoke
[41:41] blessings, but they also spoke
[41:44] cursings, which lets you know a lot of
[41:46] these modernday so-called prophets are
[41:50] not prophets from
[41:51] God. Because our time handing out
[41:54] blessings, send us $100 and you'll be
[41:57] blessed. Zero from zero leaves nothing.
[42:00] Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.
[42:03] Seow a seed. Sow $500 and God will bless
[42:07] you. You know right there it's a false
[42:09] prophet. Notice again 2 Kings
[42:13] 21:10. And the Lord spake by his
[42:17] servants the prophets saying because
[42:21] Manasseh king of Judah hath done these
[42:24] abominations and have done wickedly
[42:26] above all the Amorites did which are
[42:28] before him and has made Judah also to
[42:31] sin with his idols. Therefore, thus
[42:34] saith the
[42:36] Lord, God of Israel, behold, I am
[42:40] bringing such evil upon Jerusalem.
[42:45] Now listen young people. The same God
[42:48] that said they would get the land is now
[42:51] the same God that's using prophets to
[42:54] tell
[42:55] them because of your sin and rebellion.
[42:58] Thus sayaeth the Lord this land will be
[43:02] taken from
[43:03] you. It's a mystery that the Jews still
[43:06] to this day do not understand. Even
[43:10] though they have these prophets, but
[43:12] they still don't understand the
[43:14] diaspora. Anybody know what that means?
[43:16] The diaspora is is a Greek for
[43:19] dispersing. So, it was the dispersing of
[43:22] the Jews. Of course, it happened in in
[43:25] Nebuchadnezzar's time. It also happened
[43:27] again and several times down through the
[43:29] ages and happened again the last major
[43:31] time whenever the Romans come in and
[43:33] took over. And they look at it and are
[43:35] trying to still understand it today. But
[43:37] it was because of their own sin. And who
[43:41] did God use to tell them? Not television
[43:44] evangelist, but
[43:46] prophets. Prophets. Therefore, thus
[43:49] saith the Lord God of Israel, I am
[43:51] bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and
[43:54] Judah that whosoever heareth of it, both
[43:57] his ears shall tingle. First Kings 24:2.
[44:03] And the Lord sent against him bands of
[44:06] the Chaldes and bands of the Syrians and
[44:09] bands of the Moabites. You mean to tell
[44:12] me
[44:14] God sent these evil,
[44:19] wicked, sinful
[44:22] people? his
[44:25] people. My
[44:27] goodness, you realize how blessed we are
[44:30] to sit under this revealed word of the
[44:33] hour. But you see, if we turn away from
[44:35] that
[44:36] word, oh my goodness, can't you see why
[44:39] those who walk away from this message,
[44:43] many of them become more decrepit. It's
[44:46] amazing how fast they erode and
[44:52] rotten. Brother Brandham one time he was
[44:54] down in
[44:55] Kentucky down hunting with a friend of
[44:57] mine, Brother Charlie Cox, and there was
[45:00] a lot of hills and hollers there and
[45:04] Brother Brandham had went over to a
[45:06] certain place to hunt and there was a
[45:09] big gigantic beach tree. Anybody know
[45:11] what a beach tree is? A beach tree is a
[45:13] very, very hard tree, but the grain of a
[45:16] beach is not very pretty. So, it's not
[45:20] used very much as far as for decorative
[45:22] type of tree, but they will use it and
[45:25] then they'll overlay it with a real nice
[45:28] veneer like walnut, mahogany, a crotched
[45:32] veneer or something like that. But it's
[45:34] a very very hard tree. So, Brother
[45:38] Random was going hunting and he jumped
[45:40] up on the side of a log and when he did
[45:44] a big chunk of that tree broke off. Now
[45:48] this tree was laying in a branch what he
[45:52] called a branch which was a stream of
[45:54] water. Now we said how how this tree
[45:58] become to this spot. So for years this
[46:02] beach had stood there by this stream of
[46:05] water and his great taproots had went
[46:07] down into the ground and stabilized him
[46:10] himself through all the winds as they
[46:13] would howl up and down those hollers.
[46:15] And boy, they can get some strong winds
[46:16] there in Kentucky. And those great roots
[46:19] would branch out and the tap roots, they
[46:22] grow straight down and sometimes with an
[46:24] angle to to make a stability around that
[46:27] tree because they can become massive in
[46:30] size and in height and girth as well.
[46:33] But something had happened to that tree.
[46:36] The life had won out of it. Now the very
[46:40] same water that nourished that tree and
[46:44] give it strength and vitality and growth
[46:47] as long as life was in it once the life
[46:50] left the tree and then the tree fell
[46:53] over and
[46:55] crashed and laid right there in the same
[46:59] water. And now that same water was
[47:03] rottening that tree.
[47:07] And the prophet took that and he said,
[47:09] "Preach the message. How can I
[47:12] overcome?" And he said, "Christians that
[47:15] are set out beside the water and they're
[47:18] not alive and they're not growing and
[47:20] being what God wants them to be, they
[47:23] will rot twice as quick." So, a message
[47:28] young person or a message adult that
[47:31] becomes cold and lifeless and dead and
[47:35] they start going toward the world and
[47:37] the things of the world. I've seen it
[47:39] with my own eyes many times and they
[47:41] will rotten, brother Jonathan, twice as
[47:44] quick as a Baptist young person that
[47:48] just turns away from their Baptist
[47:50] theology. Why? because them
[47:52] denominations don't have the stream of
[47:54] life that we do. Oh, and he said
[47:59] struggle,
[48:00] struggle to keep life in you. So, the
[48:05] blessings and the benefits that comes
[48:08] with again a prophet's message that
[48:11] comes to us as the people of God, but
[48:14] only if we keep life in us. Oh my,
[48:19] aren't you glad we can notice again now
[48:22] the Lord sent the
[48:24] Chaldans, the bands of the Syrians,
[48:27] bands of the Moabites, bands of the
[48:30] children of Ammon, and sent them against
[48:35] Judah.
[48:37] Judah, Judah, the one that
[48:41] Shiloh was promised to come from Judah.
[48:45] The Messiah would come through
[48:48] Judah. Oh
[48:50] my. According to the word of the Lord
[48:54] which he spake, which he spake, God
[48:59] using the mouth of humans. Notice the
[49:03] way these authors wrote this.
[49:06] It was as if these men were so submitted
[49:09] to God that God could use their
[49:12] mouths and they couldn't say anything
[49:16] else. You see, that's the power of
[49:19] infallibility that will strike a
[49:22] prophet. Now, it's amazing the way that
[49:24] it works because the spirit of God could
[49:27] move upon Elijah and he could prophesy
[49:30] true things that would come to pass. And
[49:34] the spirit of God would move off of
[49:36] Elijah. And then Elijah would run scared
[49:40] because of
[49:42] Jezebel. And Elijah would tell the Lord,
[49:46] "They've killed everybody. They've
[49:48] killed all your prophets and they ain't
[49:50] nobody left but me."
[49:54] But that was not the truth, was it? Yes,
[49:56] sir. As a matter of fact, he said it
[49:58] several times and finally God told him,
[50:00] "I've got 7,000 that never never even
[50:03] bowed the knee to Baal." How could he
[50:06] say that? Because the power of
[50:08] infallibility never anointed him to say
[50:10] that part. He was a human being running
[50:13] for his life, scared to death. Isn't it
[50:15] amazing how the power of infallibility
[50:18] would grab a hold of the mouths of these
[50:21] men? And they were made when it was
[50:24] there so they could not say anything
[50:27] else. But thus saith the
[50:31] Lord. Now look at me good tonight, young
[50:34] people. I don't have that. Nor does any
[50:38] other pastor in this message. nor does
[50:40] any other evangelist or any other
[50:44] teacher. Many of you, I've been your
[50:46] pastor since you were born. You've heard
[50:49] me preach a lot of sermons. You ain't
[50:52] never heard me preach a perfect one. And
[50:54] you never will. I'll misquote quotes. I
[50:57] misquote scriptures. Not intentionally.
[51:00] It's that human element that's there.
[51:04] And think of it that God so committed
[51:06] his word to men, people like
[51:11] us. So God used the prophets, notice in
[51:15] 2 Chronicles
[51:18] 29:25, and he set the
[51:20] Levites in the house of the Lord with
[51:23] symbols. I want you to notice how that
[51:25] God even committed the order of divine
[51:30] worship through the leadership of his
[51:34] prophets. Now listen to this carefully.
[51:37] You can see why
[51:39] Leodysia has no direction on how they
[51:43] should worship. So they will merge rock
[51:46] and roll. They will merge all kinds of
[51:49] things into their worship and bring it
[51:52] right into the so-called house of God.
[51:56] They have no profit to give them
[52:00] direction. Oh, thank God for the truth.
[52:04] And he set the Levites in the house of
[52:07] the
[52:08] Lord with
[52:10] symbols, with
[52:13] sultreies, and with
[52:15] harps, according to the commandment of
[52:19] David, and of
[52:22] Gad the king's
[52:26] seer, and Nathan the prophet. For so was
[52:32] the
[52:33] commandment of the
[52:35] Lord by his
[52:39] prophets. So God ordered. So they
[52:41] couldn't just say, "Well, you know what?
[52:43] The Chaldans do it this way and the
[52:45] Syrians do it this way and the Moabites
[52:48] do it this way, so let's just let's just
[52:50] merge it all together. We we'll pull out
[52:51] what we like." God said, "No, you don't.
[52:55] I will speak through my
[52:58] prophets and they will tell you what's
[53:02] acceptable in my
[53:04] sight. I will accept
[53:08] symbols,
[53:09] sultry,
[53:11] harps. Oh, praise God. Can you imagine?
[53:15] Divine worship is allocated to us
[53:20] through what? the divine
[53:22] communication of a gift in this last
[53:26] day. You know, one one of the things
[53:27] that makes our church different than a
[53:29] lot of others, oh my goodness, if if you
[53:31] you get on YouTube and you look at some
[53:34] of the modernday singing and stuff that
[53:37] goes on in churches, it's
[53:39] filthy. It's absolutely
[53:43] ungodly. Some of the singing. Well, what
[53:45] makes us that we wouldn't go the same
[53:48] way? Do you understand? We would go the
[53:50] same way was it not for the spirit of
[53:53] God giving us a divine
[53:59] communication. Oh my. Notice again in 2
[54:02] Chronicles 36:16.
[54:06] But they
[54:08] mocked the messengers of
[54:11] God and despised his
[54:15] words and
[54:18] misused his
[54:20] prophets until the wrath of the
[54:24] Lord arose against his
[54:29] people till there was no
[54:32] remedy. Now not against the Babylonians.
[54:35] the Hittites, the
[54:38] Jebusites, but against God's
[54:41] people. What turned
[54:44] God against his
[54:47] people when his people
[54:50] rejected his prophet's
[54:54] teaching? This is what makes me shudder
[54:57] as a message
[54:59] preacher. Cuz then you see this message
[55:02] church veering off this way and this one
[55:04] veering off that way. Well, we don't
[55:07] need this anymore. We know brother B
[55:09] said that, but we don't need that. We
[55:10] don't need this and we don't need
[55:13] that. This is exactly what brought the
[55:15] children of Israel to a spot that God,
[55:19] the same God that delivered them,
[55:22] turned them right back into bondage. And
[55:25] the very wrath of God himself, not the
[55:28] devil, not the anger of
[55:31] Satan, but the anger of
[55:34] God turned against his own
[55:38] people. Oh my
[55:40] goodness. Help us,
[55:43] Jesus. Nehemiah 9:30.
[55:47] Yet many
[55:48] years did thou forebear
[55:52] them, and testifiest against them by the
[55:56] spirit in thy
[55:59] prophets, yet would they not give ear.
[56:02] Therefore gavest thou them into the hand
[56:06] of the people of the
[56:09] lands. On what
[56:11] basis? One simple
[56:14] concept. They refused to hear God's
[56:19] prophets because God's
[56:22] prophets was his
[56:25] voice. Can the use of word of life
[56:28] church say amen? Amen.
[56:31] Notice in Isaiah
[56:33] 30:9 that this is a rebellious
[56:38] people, lying
[56:40] children, children that will not hear
[56:43] the law of the Lord, which say to the
[56:47] seers, "See
[56:49] not," and to prophets, prophesy not unto
[56:54] us right things.
[56:58] Speak unto us
[57:02] smooth
[57:04] things,
[57:06] prophesy
[57:08] deceits. Are you kidding
[57:11] me? You mean people would
[57:14] actually tell
[57:16] prophets, don't tell us straight things
[57:19] and difficult things. Tell us what we
[57:22] want to hear.
[57:24] Tell us smooth things, easy things.
[57:28] You realize that spirit is not dead,
[57:31] right? The Bible says that heap to
[57:33] themselves teachers in the last days
[57:35] having itching ears and they'd turn away
[57:37] from the
[57:39] truth. So they would say, "Prophesy unto
[57:42] us." Not don't give us the right things.
[57:45] Speak unto us smooth
[57:49] things. Yeah. The Lord say, "I'm going
[57:52] to bless you." Oh yeah. The Lord say, "I
[57:55] understand you don't know if you're a
[57:57] woman or not." Yeah. The Lord say, "It
[58:00] don't matter. It don't matter. Love
[58:02] everybody." Oh, yeah. Just come on as
[58:05] you are. Yeah. The Lord say, "Heaven's
[58:08] for
[58:11] everybody." Well, there may be a Lord
[58:13] saying that, but it is not the Lord
[58:16] God because the Lord God cannot lie.
[58:22] Notice in Jeremiah
[58:25] 29:19, "Because they have not hearkened
[58:28] to my words, saeth the
[58:31] Lord, which I sent unto them by my
[58:37] servants, the
[58:39] prophets, rising up early, and sending
[58:42] them, but ye would not hear, saith the
[58:46] Lord." Jeremiah
[58:48] 35:15, I have sent also unto you all my
[58:51] servants, the
[58:53] prophets. Listen, young people, this is
[58:56] the
[58:57] foundation of our
[58:59] Judeo-Christian
[59:01] belief. Why is it so weird
[59:05] then that prophets are something of a of
[59:08] a day that's gone
[59:10] by? This is God's way. Return you now.
[59:16] every man from his evil way and amends
[59:19] your doings. This is what the prophets
[59:22] told them. A true prophet of God will
[59:26] always restore you to that original
[59:29] word. And go not after other gods to
[59:32] serve them. You shall dwell in the land
[59:34] which I have given unto you and to your
[59:36] fathers, but you have not inclined your
[59:38] ear, nor hearkened unto me. Ezekiel
[59:42] 13:1. And the word of the Lord came unto
[59:46] me, saying, Son of
[59:49] man,
[59:52] prophesy against the prophets of
[59:57] Israel that
[1:00:00] prophesy.
[1:00:02] Wow. So, let's revert back in
[1:00:06] time. So, we don't live in
[1:00:09] 2025, but we're in the time of
[1:00:13] Ezekiel. There's prophets all over the
[1:00:15] land prophesying all kinds of things.
[1:00:18] Thus sayaith the Lord, this and this and
[1:00:20] this, that's going to happen. Thus
[1:00:22] sayaith the Lord, don't worry about your
[1:00:24] sins. God understands you can't live
[1:00:26] right. Oh, thus sayaith the Lord, I'll
[1:00:28] never leave you. That's okay. That's
[1:00:30] okay. That's fine.
[1:00:33] And then we have one man that God tells
[1:00:35] him, I want you to get out there and I
[1:00:37] want you to tear the hide off of them
[1:00:40] false prophets. I want you to call them
[1:00:43] liars to their
[1:00:46] face. Wow. Now remember, you all are
[1:00:49] Israel. So you're hearing them nice guys
[1:00:52] down there. Praise God. A moves on the
[1:00:55] way. I hear the latter rain coming. Oh,
[1:00:58] I tell you one thing. We're fixing to
[1:00:59] have a revival. Boy, that get the music
[1:01:01] going. Woo! Glory to God. Amen. Here it
[1:01:04] comes. And here comes Ezekiel. Thus
[1:01:06] saith the Lord. You're a lying bunch of
[1:01:11] dogs. You imagine that? Just what I
[1:01:15] figured. He ain't got the love of God.
[1:01:18] How can any man stand up there and blast
[1:01:20] our prophets? They're so sweet and
[1:01:23] they're so humble and they're so kind.
[1:01:25] They're just like a bowl of jello. I
[1:01:27] mean, they're just so ooey gooey and my
[1:01:29] everybody loves them and everybody look
[1:01:32] at this man. He's rough. Oh my
[1:01:37] goodness. Which side what do we take?
[1:01:42] Your stand today would identify what
[1:01:46] stand you would have took in Ezekiel.
[1:01:49] Son of man, prophesy against the
[1:01:52] prophets of Israel that
[1:01:55] prophesy and say thou unto
[1:01:58] them that
[1:02:01] prophesy out of their own
[1:02:07] hearts. So they are standing there and
[1:02:12] telling people thus says the Lord this
[1:02:16] and this and this. But the Lord didn't
[1:02:19] say it at all. Where's it coming from?
[1:02:22] Their own
[1:02:23] hearts. Now, the difference between them
[1:02:26] and Ezekiel was Ezekiel was saying what
[1:02:28] God put in his mouth. This was not in
[1:02:31] Ezekiel's heart. It didn't come from
[1:02:33] him. It come from
[1:02:34] God. Hear ye the word of the Lord. Thus
[1:02:38] saith the Lord God. Woe unto the foolish
[1:02:42] prophets that follow their own spirit.
[1:02:48] and have seen
[1:02:53] nothing. Oh, I seen this and I seen that
[1:02:56] and I seen something else and I seen
[1:02:58] something else. But God said they are
[1:03:02] liars. They have seen
[1:03:07] nothing. And remember, you all are the
[1:03:10] youth in Judah. You're the youth of
[1:03:13] Reuben. You're the use of Issachar.
[1:03:17] Napali
[1:03:20] Dan. Which one you all going to take
[1:03:22] sides
[1:03:24] with? My
[1:03:26] my Oh, Israel, thy
[1:03:30] prophets are like the
[1:03:33] foxes in the
[1:03:36] deserts. Wow, that's a good way to
[1:03:38] describe a prophet, ain't it? They're
[1:03:41] like foxes in the deserts. Now listen,
[1:03:48] parabolic. Ye have not gone up into the
[1:03:54] gaps. Now to us westerners, this don't
[1:03:57] even make any
[1:04:00] sense. But let me paint it so you can
[1:04:03] have a clear
[1:04:06] understanding. Their safety was behind a
[1:04:09] wall
[1:04:10] city. So when walls would become aged
[1:04:15] and they would decay, mortar would fall
[1:04:18] out, stones would begin to become
[1:04:22] dislodged and there would be openings in
[1:04:25] the
[1:04:27] wall. So like any smart devil, why kill
[1:04:31] yourself trying to go through a solid
[1:04:33] wall when you got a
[1:04:34] door? Now notice how God likened true
[1:04:38] men of God and true
[1:04:40] prophets. God said, "Oh Israel, thy
[1:04:43] prophets are like foxes in the desert.
[1:04:46] Ye have not gone up into the
[1:04:50] gaps." So there were gaps in the wall.
[1:04:54] You see what a true man of God does? He
[1:04:57] goes into the gaps and starts
[1:05:02] rebuilding and stopping the gaps for
[1:05:06] what? Your safety.
[1:05:09] Your safety. Because the enemy is going
[1:05:12] to go straight for the gaps in the wall.
[1:05:16] Let me make it where you can understand
[1:05:17] it. All right. So, I want to get from
[1:05:19] here back to there. Now, I could go the
[1:05:23] hard way. I could step here and step
[1:05:26] there and step there and step over the
[1:05:28] top of Ellie's head, step over the top
[1:05:30] of Carol's head and keep on stepping,
[1:05:32] stepping, stepping. Or I could go
[1:05:36] through
[1:05:37] the gaps. Amen.
[1:05:41] Now, God said if they were true
[1:05:43] prophets, this is what they would do.
[1:05:45] They would stand side by side by side.
[1:05:47] Come here, Brother Joe. Come here,
[1:05:49] brother Jonathan.
[1:05:51] If they are true men of God, they will
[1:05:54] fill the
[1:05:55] gap in order to protect you. But these
[1:06:00] false prophets are like foxes in the
[1:06:03] desert. So what have we done? We have
[1:06:05] filled this gap. So you want to come
[1:06:07] this way, you're coming through
[1:06:10] us, devil, you want to come this way,
[1:06:13] you got to come through us, right,
[1:06:15] brothers? Amen. Cuz we're filling the
[1:06:17] gap. There's real men of God. Now notice
[1:06:21] God likened these false prophets to
[1:06:25] foxes in the desert. So foxes in the
[1:06:29] desert would have to be
[1:06:30] opportunist because in the desert
[1:06:33] there's not a whole lot for them to eat.
[1:06:36] So they're going to do for every
[1:06:38] opportunity that they can. And God was
[1:06:41] showing them this is what these false
[1:06:43] prophets are doing to you. They're
[1:06:45] opportunist and they're taking advantage
[1:06:48] for you. They have to have you to
[1:06:51] survive. But if they were true men of
[1:06:54] God, they would be standing in the gap,
[1:06:57] not thinking of their own survival, but
[1:06:59] they would give their life for you. So
[1:07:03] you could survive instead of being like
[1:07:05] a fox
[1:07:06] hiding and using you as only to get his
[1:07:10] own means
[1:07:12] satisfied. You have not gone up into the
[1:07:15] gaps. Neither have you made up the hedge
[1:07:17] for the house of Israel to stand in the
[1:07:20] battle in the day of the Lord. Oh my.
[1:07:25] Notice in chapter 13 verse 6, they have
[1:07:29] seen
[1:07:30] vanity and lying
[1:07:35] divination, saying, "The Lord
[1:07:39] says, and the Lord hath not sent
[1:07:43] them, and they have made others to
[1:07:49] hope that they would confirm the word."
[1:07:54] You see what these false prophets are?
[1:07:56] They was telling the people and giving
[1:07:58] them supposedly words from the Lord. And
[1:08:01] the people was
[1:08:02] hoping that these were the words from
[1:08:05] the
[1:08:07] Lord. Oh
[1:08:09] God, have you not seen a vain
[1:08:13] vision? Have you not spoken a lying
[1:08:17] divination?
[1:08:19] Where as you say, the Lord saith,
[1:08:23] albeit I have
[1:08:27] not spoken. You realize this going all
[1:08:31] over around the world today. Any of
[1:08:33] these TV evangelists, boy, if they want
[1:08:35] a big following, oh, the Lord shows me
[1:08:37] there's somebody out there that's got
[1:08:39] clothes on, they got hair on their head,
[1:08:41] and they got shoes on their feet, they
[1:08:43] got a back pain. Let's see. It's It's in
[1:08:45] their back. I can't tell if it's in the
[1:08:46] right back or the middle back. Oh, it's
[1:08:48] spread from the back to both sides.
[1:08:50] Yeah. About 385,000 of them sitting out
[1:08:53] there meet that description. Well, the
[1:08:55] Lord said this and the Lord said that
[1:08:56] and the Lord said something else. False
[1:08:59] prophets and liars.
[1:09:02] Praise the
[1:09:04] Lord. Don't give me some kind of
[1:09:06] prophecy that there ain't no way to
[1:09:08] check it. Come on, somebody.
[1:09:12] God's prophet was able to stand there
[1:09:14] and say, "I see you going to see a
[1:09:16] doctor." heaven said, "Man, had on
[1:09:18] glasses, three steps going up to your
[1:09:20] house. You live on 123 such and such and
[1:09:22] so and so." There's a real prophet of
[1:09:25] God. But I I feel there's somebody here
[1:09:27] tonight There's somebody in the
[1:09:29] building. I I can feel it. I can feel
[1:09:30] it. Somebody here in the building
[1:09:32] tonight has got a need. Yeah. Which one
[1:09:33] of us ain't? Which one of us ain't got a
[1:09:36] need? Starting with me. I got a need
[1:09:38] tonight. Don't tell me a bunch of lying
[1:09:41] vanity. Well, this is your day. My day
[1:09:43] for what? Uh, this is your time. My time
[1:09:48] for what?
[1:09:52] Well,
[1:09:54] glory. They have seen vanity and lying
[1:09:57] divination. They say, "The Lord says,
[1:09:59] and the Lord hath not sent it." They've
[1:10:02] made others to hope that they would
[1:10:04] confirm the word. Have you not seen a
[1:10:07] vain vision? Have you not spoken a lying
[1:10:10] divination? For as you say, the Lord,
[1:10:13] saith it, how be it, I have not
[1:10:17] spoken. Therefore, thus saith the Lord
[1:10:21] God, because you have spoken vanity and
[1:10:26] seen
[1:10:30] lies. So you mean
[1:10:32] people could actually see
[1:10:35] visions and them visions be lies?
[1:10:43] Y'all even quieter than you was before
[1:10:45] we
[1:10:47] started. You imagine how frightening
[1:10:50] this is. Therefore, thus sayith the
[1:10:52] Lord, because you have spoken vanity and
[1:10:55] seen lies, therefore, behold, I am
[1:10:58] against
[1:11:01] you, saith the Lord God, and my hand
[1:11:05] shall be upon the prophets that see
[1:11:08] vanity and that divine lies.
[1:11:13] They shall not be in the assembly of my
[1:11:16] people, neither shall they be written in
[1:11:18] the writing of the house of Israel,
[1:11:22] neither shall they enter into the land
[1:11:24] of Israel. And ye shall know that I am
[1:11:29] the Lord
[1:11:31] God.
[1:11:33] Wow. And God used who to do this? kings,
[1:11:38] potentates, politicians, magistrates,
[1:11:41] singers,
[1:11:43] songwriters, pastors, evangelists,
[1:11:46] teachers,
[1:11:48] prophets. Prophets. Do you understand?
[1:11:51] If God had not sent Malachi 4, the earth
[1:11:56] would have already met a major
[1:11:59] destruction. Lest I come and smite the
[1:12:03] earth with a curse.
[1:12:06] Malachi 4 held it off. Why the bride had
[1:12:11] to be gathered.
[1:12:13] Praise be to God. Can I have you a few
[1:12:16] more
[1:12:16] minutes? Look in Daniel chapter 9 verse
[1:12:21] 10. Neither have we obeyed the
[1:12:26] voice of the Lord our God to walk in his
[1:12:29] laws which he set before us by his
[1:12:34] servants. the prophets. Hosea 6:5,
[1:12:38] therefore have I
[1:12:42] heeded
[1:12:44] heed
[1:12:46] them by the
[1:12:48] prophets. This is the way God chops
[1:12:53] out his
[1:12:55] people. He chops them
[1:12:58] out by his
[1:13:00] prophets. I have slain
[1:13:03] them by the words of my mouths, and thy
[1:13:06] judgments are as the light that goeth
[1:13:09] forth. What a peculiar way and an an
[1:13:14] unusual
[1:13:16] observance of judgments that they
[1:13:19] actually bring light. Now, to the
[1:13:23] unbelieving, the unconverted that, well,
[1:13:25] it's too hard. It's too difficult. Ain't
[1:13:27] nobody can live it. Of course, we can't
[1:13:28] live it on our own. That's why he sets
[1:13:30] it up that way. He makes it where it
[1:13:33] must be him and us living it. But we
[1:13:35] look at it while the others say, "Oh,
[1:13:37] that's such bondage. That's absolutely
[1:13:39] terrible." We look at it not as walls of
[1:13:42] bondage, but as castle walls that keeps
[1:13:44] us separated from the things of the
[1:13:46] world. Notice Hosea
[1:13:49] 12:10. I have also
[1:13:53] spoken
[1:13:54] by the prophets.
[1:13:58] So young people, think with me
[1:14:02] now. If almighty God has sent us a
[1:14:05] prophet in the last
[1:14:07] days and the majority of the world has
[1:14:11] turned him down and God has done as he's
[1:14:14] always
[1:14:15] done spoken by the mouth of his
[1:14:20] prophets, what will God
[1:14:25] do? For our nation
[1:14:27] itself, its days are already numbered.
[1:14:32] There is no national
[1:14:35] repentance. Oh, I know. I understand. I
[1:14:39] heard a little bit today on Fox News.
[1:14:41] Today was a national day of prayer. I
[1:14:46] heard our president admonishing the
[1:14:49] people, different religious leaders
[1:14:51] there. One of them a woman pastor. That
[1:14:54] tells you how spiritual they are,
[1:14:56] right? Admonishing the Americans to pray
[1:14:59] and get back to God.
[1:15:03] There is no
[1:15:05] national repentance.
[1:15:08] America has sent
[1:15:10] away her day of
[1:15:14] grace. In 1956, God's prophet said,
[1:15:17] "This year, America will accept or
[1:15:21] reject God." And I predict she will
[1:15:26] reject
[1:15:28] him. So in the seventh of his visions
[1:15:32] which were given in 1933, anybody
[1:15:35] remember what the seventh one was? It
[1:15:38] was the United States of
[1:15:42] America. Your home, my
[1:15:46] home, not a land of the free and the
[1:15:49] home of the brave and great great
[1:15:53] beautiful castles and houses and
[1:15:55] beautiful pastures of
[1:15:57] green. but smoldering
[1:16:01] craters on the
[1:16:03] earth.
[1:16:06] Ashes, Lord
[1:16:09] God. Now, as an American, it hurts my
[1:16:12] heart to have to say
[1:16:14] that. But why would God do
[1:16:18] such? Because God from this
[1:16:21] nation started a revival. And from this
[1:16:24] nation, God sent his
[1:16:26] prophet. If they would have
[1:16:28] listened, if they would have heard, we
[1:16:32] could have led the world. Not only just
[1:16:34] in a Pentecostal move, but in a
[1:16:37] restoration ushered in the
[1:16:39] millennium. But instead, what did they
[1:16:42] usher
[1:16:43] in?
[1:16:45] Hollywood. All the illegitimate unbelief
[1:16:49] that there is in our
[1:16:51] nation. Oh, God have mercy.
[1:16:54] But I'm glad God's made a way. What will
[1:16:57] be our place of
[1:17:00] protection under the wings of God's
[1:17:03] eagle? Remember, God prophesied by the
[1:17:06] wings of an eagle that he brought the
[1:17:09] children of Israel out of the land of
[1:17:10] Egypt. And what were those
[1:17:13] wings? God's
[1:17:16] prophet.
[1:17:18] Hallelujah. Let me read one more and
[1:17:20] we'll close.
[1:17:22] Amos chapter 3 verse
[1:17:26] 7.
[1:17:28] Surely the Lord
[1:17:31] God will do nothing, but he
[1:17:36] revealth his secrets, his
[1:17:39] secret, his
[1:17:42] secret unto his
[1:17:45] servants, the prophets.
[1:17:51] Can I read two more scriptures? Thank
[1:17:53] you. Matthew
[1:17:57] 2:23. And he came and dwelt in a city
[1:18:00] called
[1:18:01] Nazareth, that it might be
[1:18:05] fulfilled, which was spoken by the
[1:18:09] prophets he shall be
[1:18:11] called a Nazarene. Now, here we moved
[1:18:15] over to the New
[1:18:16] Testament. And the New Testament's
[1:18:19] foundation is based upon the prophets.
[1:18:24] Amen. And the young people said,
[1:18:28] "Now listen to the words of the Lord
[1:18:29] Jesus." And we will close with this.
[1:18:31] Matthew
[1:18:33] 23:34,
[1:18:35] "Wherefore,
[1:18:37] behold, I send unto
[1:18:41] you TV
[1:18:45] evangelists,
[1:18:47] bookwriters, song
[1:18:50] readers. Now, what about you Bible
[1:18:53] scholars?
[1:18:55] What about you denominationals, you
[1:18:57] Baptists, you Methodists, you church of
[1:18:59] Christ that condemn us because we
[1:19:02] believe in prophets and your Lord Jesus
[1:19:06] which you claim is your
[1:19:09] savior said, "I send unto you prophets
[1:19:20] and wise men and scribes, and some of
[1:19:23] them you shall killed and crucified and
[1:19:26] some of them you shall scourge. Notice
[1:19:29] he's not talking about Old
[1:19:31] Testament, but New Testament. Do we
[1:19:34] believe this prophecy? As one believer,
[1:19:37] I believe it. And some of them you shall
[1:19:40] scourge in your synagogues and persecute
[1:19:44] them from city to city. May the Lord
[1:19:49] bless his word. Let's stand together.
[1:19:53] Praise be to
[1:19:56] God. Praise the
[1:19:59] Lord. So you see, it's
[1:20:02] scriptural for us to believe the
[1:20:06] prophets. Our
[1:20:08] Judeo-Christian
[1:20:10] faith is not based upon some Kuckian
[1:20:14] that come up with an idea that he wanted
[1:20:17] to be a prophet one day. Decided, I want
[1:20:19] to be a prophet. Well, that's what I
[1:20:22] want to be. I want to be a prophet and I
[1:20:23] I want to get a a follow on the people
[1:20:25] and I want people to come and follow me
[1:20:28] and I I I'm going to lead them into this
[1:20:30] that and the other. Of course not. He
[1:20:32] didn't even want it. As a matter of
[1:20:35] fact, he said, "I wish this
[1:20:37] message wasn't mine to bring."
[1:20:41] Can you imagine?
[1:20:43] He did not want to be the
[1:20:45] messenger of all the pain and all the
[1:20:49] anxiety and all the stress that it
[1:20:51] brought him. But aren't you glad he did?
[1:20:55] Amen. Can you imagine when he was
[1:20:56] carried beyond the curtain of
[1:20:58] time and he saw all of those millions
[1:21:02] that was in that great dimension of
[1:21:05] God and they told him, "If you had not
[1:21:08] have come to the
[1:21:10] earth, we would not be
[1:21:15] here." Well, brother Donnie, what about
[1:21:17] the cross? What about the cross? Amen.
[1:21:20] After Jesus died on the cross and raised
[1:21:23] from the dead, they still had to be
[1:21:25] baptized in water in the name of Jesus
[1:21:27] or they were not identified as
[1:21:29] believers. They had to receive the Holy
[1:21:32] Ghost or they were not even identified
[1:21:34] as being born again. The cross was the
[1:21:37] beginning of the initial stages of the
[1:21:40] bridge to span the gap back to man's
[1:21:44] redemption.
[1:21:46] But stopping at the cross, nobody,
[1:21:49] nobody should have wrote more about the
[1:21:52] cross than John the
[1:21:54] Divine. He was the only
[1:21:57] apostle that was at the foot of the
[1:22:00] cross. You ever counted how many times
[1:22:03] he wrote about
[1:22:05] it? Read St. John, the fourth gospel of
[1:22:09] the New Testament. when you get when you
[1:22:11] get time. First John, 2 John, Third
[1:22:15] John. See how many times the word cross
[1:22:19] is mentioned. Now, this man was there
[1:22:22] and saw the
[1:22:23] cross. But this man wrote more about
[1:22:26] love than he did about the cross. This
[1:22:29] man wrote more about
[1:22:31] Antichrist than he mentioned the word
[1:22:34] cross. He wrote more about that city and
[1:22:37] about the inheritance of the bride than
[1:22:39] he did the cross. And that man stood
[1:22:41] right there and looked at Jesus on the
[1:22:44] cross and no doubt touched
[1:22:47] it. But he realized pointing backwards
[1:22:50] to the cross wouldn't do you no good if
[1:22:54] you didn't point from the cross forward.
[1:22:57] Don't you see what denominational
[1:22:59] preachers do to their people? That's as
[1:23:02] far as they point them to. The cross.
[1:23:05] The cross. That's all they sing about.
[1:23:07] That's all they preach about. That's all
[1:23:09] they know. Why? Cuz most of their
[1:23:11] preachers standing in their pullpit are
[1:23:14] not born again, sir. And they don't have
[1:23:16] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:18] themselves. So, how can they tell their
[1:23:20] people about the Holy Ghost?
[1:23:24] Don't you love him tonight with all your
[1:23:25] heart?
[1:23:27] Young people of the Lord Daries, in a
[1:23:30] few months, Carol and I will be 69 years
[1:23:34] old. Just by natural occurrence of life,
[1:23:38] who knows how much long I've got on the
[1:23:40] earth. Before long, you all will be the
[1:23:43] preachers and the preachers wives and
[1:23:44] the deacons and the deacons
[1:23:46] wives. What will you all do with this
[1:23:50] message? What will you do with
[1:23:52] it? Will you hold the same standard?
[1:23:56] Don't be like Israel was. You see, these
[1:23:58] were their children and their
[1:24:00] grandchildren and their greatg
[1:24:02] grandandchildren that God said, "I am
[1:24:04] against you, and I'll bring the Moabites
[1:24:07] against you and the Ammonites and the
[1:24:10] Hittites, cuz you've got away from my
[1:24:12] word." Let God burn this so real in your
[1:24:16] heart that you'll say, "I will not let
[1:24:19] it
[1:24:20] go." Let's pray together.
[1:24:25] Praise the
[1:24:27] Lord. Lord
[1:24:30] Jesus, as I've sat Lord for the last
[1:24:32] couple of days and looking at these
[1:24:35] great scriptures and thinking in my
[1:24:38] mind, how can people read these and not
[1:24:42] see why we still believe you use
[1:24:46] prophets?
[1:24:49] Lord God, thank you for your
[1:24:51] word. To
[1:24:53] me, if any age needed one, it was this
[1:25:00] age. We had Father
[1:25:02] Divine. We had the blue flame
[1:25:05] worshippers.
[1:25:07] We have John Alexander
[1:25:09] Dowi buried in an Elijah's
[1:25:13] robe that went outside of the city of
[1:25:16] Chicago and started a city called
[1:25:19] Zion and was going to make it the new
[1:25:22] heaven on earth.
[1:25:25] And the original Zion, Illinois, which
[1:25:27] is still there, all the streets and the
[1:25:29] avenues were named Elijah and Enoch and
[1:25:32] Mary and John because they thought
[1:25:35] they'd start heaven on
[1:25:39] earth. But in the midst of all that
[1:25:43] chaos, you raised up a
[1:25:45] man with a true word from
[1:25:48] God. He wasn't the only one seeing
[1:25:51] visions. He wasn't the only one saying
[1:25:53] thus sayeth the Lord. But we could take
[1:25:56] him back to the
[1:25:58] scripture and we knew that he had the
[1:26:00] true identification of a prophet because
[1:26:02] true prophets always point people back
[1:26:06] to the original
[1:26:08] word. Lord Jesus, thank you for sending
[1:26:11] it for us.
[1:26:13] Lord, I can't wait that day until we all
[1:26:16] stand before you and we'll walk up under
[1:26:20] the
[1:26:21] oposes under the messenger of this age.
[1:26:25] I will stand there and give an account
[1:26:27] for what I've preached. I will stand
[1:26:30] there with a few little people Lord that
[1:26:32] I've been able to lead to you and we'll
[1:26:35] all in this age stand there under the
[1:26:37] oposes of that prophet messenger and he
[1:26:41] will present
[1:26:42] us as the bride for this
[1:26:45] age. Lord God may there not be a young
[1:26:48] person missing at that
[1:26:50] day. Lord Jesus, may our hearts be in
[1:26:53] tuned to the true vision of God for the
[1:26:57] last
[1:26:59] day. We worship you tonight,
[1:27:02] Lord. Hallelujah. You promised it in the
[1:27:06] book of Joel. I will
[1:27:09] restore, sayeth the
[1:27:12] Lord. Now, we got baptism right. We got
[1:27:15] the name of Jesus restored back to the
[1:27:17] church. power of God back in the church
[1:27:20] like as in the day of
[1:27:23] Pentecost. We got not a denomination,
[1:27:26] not a system, but individuals all over
[1:27:29] the world filled with the Holy Ghost led
[1:27:31] by the spirit of
[1:27:33] God. Signs, wonders, miracles,
[1:27:36] supernatural happening among us like it
[1:27:39] was in the early church.
[1:27:41] another book of Acts being written. If
[1:27:45] these people could only realize around
[1:27:47] the world, testimonies being turned in
[1:27:50] every week. I had cancer and I was
[1:27:52] healed. I was blind in one eye, now I
[1:27:56] see. I couldn't hear out of this ear,
[1:27:59] but now I hear. I couldn't hardly walk,
[1:28:02] but God gave me my legs
[1:28:04] back. Hallelujah. The same God that did
[1:28:08] it 2,000 years ago is doing it
[1:28:12] again. Following
[1:28:15] what? Elijah's
[1:28:18] ministry. And Elijah's ministry always
[1:28:21] pointed back to the
[1:28:24] restoration. Oh Jesus, thank you,
[1:28:28] Father. And we want to be ready for that
[1:28:30] great catching away.
[1:28:32] Lord, search every heart here tonight. I
[1:28:35] pray.
[1:28:36] Father, do a work in each life and each
[1:28:38] heart. We
[1:28:40] pray in the name of
[1:28:43] Jesus. Thank you,
[1:28:46] Lord. Thank you,
[1:28:52] Lord. Amen. You so thankful for that
[1:28:55] tonight.
[1:28:56] I was thinking when when brother Donnie
[1:28:58] was reading the scripture there in
[1:29:01] Samuel when he said there was no open
[1:29:02] vision. You know after after the
[1:29:06] cross there was open vision every age.
[1:29:10] God sent an open vision through Paul all
[1:29:13] the way down every church age because
[1:29:14] when you read in Revelations when he
[1:29:16] mentions every church age he said thus
[1:29:18] sayith the the spirit is saying to the
[1:29:20] church bringing the vision and in the
[1:29:23] laya church age you have the full
[1:29:27] vision you know what what if we didn't
[1:29:29] have it what if we didn't have a
[1:29:32] messenger come in this day I was brother
[1:29:35] Donnie was preaching last night and the
[1:29:37] scripture tells us how he was tempted
[1:29:39] Paul said he was tempted in all ways.
[1:29:42] What if we didn't have a prophet to come
[1:29:43] explain that to
[1:29:46] us? Brought out the hum humanity of
[1:29:49] Christ. We we would without that
[1:29:51] understanding, without the understanding
[1:29:52] of the Holy Ghost, without a prophet to
[1:29:55] bring that to you. How would you face
[1:29:56] your trials every day? How would you
[1:29:59] face your choices that you're going to
[1:30:00] make? You're going to walk out of here
[1:30:01] in a little bit later and tomorrow, this
[1:30:03] week, next month, you're going to you're
[1:30:05] going to have be attempted to make a
[1:30:08] choice one way or the other. That's
[1:30:09] every day in our
[1:30:12] life. But when he was tempted in all
[1:30:14] things and overcome all things, it
[1:30:16] wasn't that you could overcome it
[1:30:18] because he said, "I already did it." And
[1:30:20] he told him, he said, "When I go away,
[1:30:21] I'll come back and I'll I'll live in you
[1:30:24] and you let me overcome it again through
[1:30:27] you." You had a without the prophet
[1:30:30] coming and telling us that. Malachi 4:5
[1:30:33] was God saying, "I'm bringing the open
[1:30:35] vision to the Leodysian church age." and
[1:30:38] he gave it to you. What if you didn't
[1:30:40] have it? What the understanding of the
[1:30:42] scriptures when you read when I read
[1:30:44] still to this day, I've read the Bible
[1:30:47] through I don't know how many times and
[1:30:48] I would say I could probably fully
[1:30:50] understand probably 15 20% of what I'm
[1:30:53] reading without having heard a
[1:30:56] message. That's why we have to have a
[1:30:59] prophet. And I'm so thankful that's what
[1:31:01] about from these series. I I've never
[1:31:05] I've got so many ways now to explain to
[1:31:07] somebody this this is how I know there
[1:31:10] has to be a
[1:31:11] prophet. You know, we me and my
[1:31:13] brother-in-law was with a a Baptist guy
[1:31:15] one day and he said, "Y'all think
[1:31:17] Brother Brandham's a
[1:31:19] prophet?" And I was like, "Yeah,
[1:31:23] why?" And Joel mentioned Amos
[1:31:28] 3:7 until he reveals it first to his
[1:31:31] prophet. reveals a secret first to the
[1:31:35] prophets. Like I the gentleman's like, I
[1:31:38] can see
[1:31:39] that, you know, it's to me it's just
[1:31:42] it's just God's grace. If we had to
[1:31:46] still just live by own understanding. I
[1:31:48] feel sorry for people out here that have
[1:31:49] walked away to turn it away. They turned
[1:31:52] away from God's understanding. They
[1:31:53] didn't turn away from brother
[1:31:54] Brandham's. They turned away from God's
[1:31:57] interpreting to the word to where you
[1:31:58] can understand it, to where you can live
[1:32:00] it. I'm so thankful for that. We're
[1:32:03] going to sing a few song here. But no,
[1:32:06] if you come up and and dismiss for us
[1:32:08] and and um make sure you tell sister
[1:32:12] Angel and Sister Heidi and everybody
[1:32:14] that helps in there whenever you come in
[1:32:16] to eat over there, make sure you thank
[1:32:18] them for that, okay? Um to do that. They
[1:32:20] do that out of the kindness of their
[1:32:21] heart. And we're so glad for that. We're
[1:32:24] so glad for brother Donnie taking his
[1:32:27] time, sister Carol to come here and and
[1:32:30] share their time with us. It it means
[1:32:32] the world and you know it just these
[1:32:35] these Thursdays one day we're going to
[1:32:36] we might not get a chance to and I'm so
[1:32:39] thankful and I I try not to take them
[1:32:41] for granted. So, God bless you all and
[1:32:44] uh brother no, if you come up here and
[1:32:46] dismiss us in
[1:32:52] prayer. Let's all
[1:32:54] pray. Lord Jesus, we just want to thank
[1:32:57] you for tonight's service, Lord. It was
[1:32:59] such a blessing to to me personally,
[1:33:01] Lord. And I just we're so thankful for
[1:33:04] that open vision, Lord. Lord, because we
[1:33:06] can not only look into the word and see
[1:33:08] where we're going, see what lies before
[1:33:10] us, but we can see ourselves because of
[1:33:13] what you've given to us. Lord Jesus, we
[1:33:16] thank you so much and we love you with
[1:33:18] all of our hearts. I pray you just bless
[1:33:21] brother Donnie. May you just encourage
[1:33:22] him, give him strength, and lift up his
[1:33:24] spirit. Lord, I pray. May you go with us
[1:33:26] now, keep us all safe, bring us all back
[1:33:29] together again at the appointed time.
[1:33:30] Lord, I pray. For we ask all these
[1:33:32] things in your precious name, the Lord
[1:33:34] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:56] Amen. Oh, now open the eyes of my heart,
[1:34:01] Lord.
[1:34:04] Oh, open the eyes of my
[1:34:08] heart. I want to see
[1:34:13] you. Oh, I want to see
[1:34:17] [Music]
[1:34:19] you. Oh, see you high and lifted
[1:34:26] up. Oh, shining in the light of your
[1:34:30] glory.

[1:34:59] Lord. Y'all are dismissed. Open the eyes
[1:35:03] of my
[1:35:04] heart. I want to see
[1:35:10] you. Oh, I want to see
[1:35:17] you. Oh, open the eyes of my heart,
[1:35:22] Lord. Oh, open the eyes of my heart.
[1:35:27] For I want to see
[1:35:32] you. Oh, I want to see
[1:35:38] you. Oh, see you high and lifted
[1:35:45] up. Oh, shining in the light of your
[1:35:48] glory.
[1:35:51] Pour out your power in love as we sing.

[1:36:06] holy. I want to see
[1:36:11] you. Oh, I want to see you.
[1:36:18] Oh, now open the eyes of my heart,
[1:36:23] Lord. Oh, open the eyes of my
[1:36:28] heart. I want to see
[1:36:33] you. Oh, I want to see
[1:36:40] you. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:36:47] Open the eyes of my
[1:36:50] heart. I want to see
[1:36:55] you. Oh, I want to see
[1:37:01] you. Oh, see you high and lifted
[1:37:07] up. Oh, shining in the light of your
[1:37:11] glory.

[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:29] Oh Lord God
[1:38:34] Almighty, you are clothed with majesty.
[1:38:43] The heavens declare your
[1:38:48] wonderers. For you are great and do
