our strength I'm probably looking tonight at some of the weakest human beings that have ever lived through time approximately eight billion people in the face of the Earth at least several hundred of the weakest ones that's ever lived is right here tonight okay and I'm number one I said I would never say that well you won't say you're strong and stubborn and bullheaded no I'd rather say I'm weak because Paul said whenever I'm weak then I'm strong amen I'm so grateful for his grace and mercy to us tonight aren't you I heard y'all had an awesome time here this weekend are you so Lord [Music] but I figured we might as well have another one tonight we're already here no doubt we have needs don't we desires things we need from the Lord so we believe that he certainly mindful of us to come and and help us and be able to speak to us and I'm sure most of you know it already but the Lord did a wonderful thing right here last Wednesday night Mr Ruth Garland deaths come knocking and life said no way amen I'll tell you one thing if death ever comes prematurely knocking on my door and I'm going to church I'd sure like to make sure they believe he's a resurrection in life at that church I'd sure like to make sure that some men of God there that can call death's hand and say Hey you get back where you belong I believe it's the same don't you Genesis 13 14. Genesis Chapter 13 Verse 14. our setting tonight and in this chapter in the book of Genesis it's after quite a difficult time for Abram he has experienced a great traumatic thing his nephew lot is left with him and been out with him now for quite some time but all along there was little things that was there and they had come to a spot to where the herdsmen were arguing fussing debating and so on and finally Abraham tells a lot you look this way you looked at which whichever way you want I'll go the opposite direction you go north I'll go south you go east Talca West now when you know the setting of The protocol of that day Abraham Abram his name is still yet now he was the Elder so he would have been the patriarch of the family he had the right to tell lot which way to go a lot you go there and don't you cross some boundaries or you go there or you go there wherever Abram said for him to go he would have been obligated by the law to go there but I want you to notice the difference between a foolish virgin and a bride type Abram looks in a total different way you see eternal life is living for others and even though Abraham didn't have it in his soul yet he had the deposit and there was something that was there so the Bible tells us that lot lifted up his eyes I keep that in mind as we read this first verse and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes okay so in chapter 12 the Bible tells us that lot lifted up his eyes not direction from God but Abraham waited to lift his eyes until God told him to you see when you see selfishness man woman boy or girl a person's life is all about themself everything is about them that's a terrible sign of a foolish virgin or to say the least a seed of God that's not yet been born again God hates selfishness it's the very epitome of the heart of Satan is selfishness so lot lifted up his eyes Abraham doesn't now this is more than just raising your head but lifting up their eyes was a sign of a claim a possession so when lot lifted his eyes it was more than just his head been down and raising it up but it was a claim on something now notice the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now now not when you want to Lord not when you want to Abram but when I tell you to now lot may have come back and said well I felt led to do this or that or the other it's incredible to me how many people feel led in the crazy stuff they feel led to do but you don't want a real child of God always checks what they feel led to do but what the word says first and the word will never the spirit of God will never lead you or I outside the confines of the word never don't never blame that on God lift up now thine eyes and look wow this is quite simple in it but look at the commands now now what's what's going to follow his obedience lift up your eyes now is the season now is the dispensation that Lots pulled away from you now you've time for you to go on so he lifted up his eyes no doubt over and over again but not like this lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward now remember he's near Bethel so where he's at on this high place he'd be able to look for miles and miles and be able to see what is going to be his from the place where thou art northward Southward Eastward and Westward now Abraham has lost the presence of lot but not the presence of the Lord now after a lot left the Lord come to give Abraham a visit amen lot had the best pastor land in all the country but he didn't have the presence of the Lord I guess which one will Breathe by then if you can have the best pastor land and the presence of the Lord go for it but if I have to make my my choice between the best pastor and the presence of the Lord I'll take the presence of the Lord anyway now notice what God tells him for all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the Earth so that if a man can number the dust of the Earth then shall thy seed also be numbered now when did this happen at a great separating time in Abram's life now all of us know that God demands separation sometimes it's your mother it's your father sometimes it might be a friend but the greatest separation well then when we separate from ourself that's the thing now watch in verse 17. arise and walk through the land in the lengths of it now the original boundary from border to border from the north notice the length which would have been north to south and the wit would have been east to west so from the North Boundary to the South about a hundred and eighty miles is the length of the Promised Land now the width would have been from the East to the West so from the Mediterranean over toward the Great River about 145 miles wide the land of Israel is about the size of New Jersey wow it has been sought after and more wars fought for that piece of real estate than any other place on the Earth and a place about 170 miles long and 145 miles wide why in the world does the devil want that place so bad because God wants it you think you're so handsome you think you're so pretty sisters while the devil wants you he don't care nothing about your looks it's because God wants you arise walk to the land and the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee I mean let to be rumored tonight as we pray and let's just hold our requests in our hearts before the Lord Heavenly fathers we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth we call Upon Your Great Name tonight father we ask that you take your word and speak to us may this reverberate in our souls tonight what you spoke to Our Father Abraham in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated from those verses of scripture I like to speak to you for just a little bit tonight on footprints means possession Footprints means possession so Abram was told by God to lift up his eyes lot lifted up his eyes on his own now you know to me it's not just a great reflection of two men a silver dollar and a penny but it also speaks of the last days when self will be so dominant in the lives of the majority of the people on the Earth so lot would have been a ambitious sort of a person a man that was always looking out for himself so whatever he would think whatever he would do whatever achievements that he would make it would be always with number one in mind so the Bible then tells us setting was a very epitome of law it's amazing how the scripture can take three or four words and epitomize two different men and revealed the very secrets of their hearts just with three or four words so lot lifted up his eyes so that tells to us the nature of Lord's soul and then Abraham Waits until God tells him to lift his eyes now we know that Abraham didn't go around like this all the time and never looking up God had already told him about the stars and the sand on the seashore of course so he was going around with his head lifted up but yet this speaks of inheritance this speaks of possession and both of them are epitomized by the exact same words but yet they go in a different avenue because their souls were from a different place so Abraham Desiring to please God and Abraham to be honest Abraham was willing to put lot first now boy I'll tell you if you can find a man like that you found yourself a real man now Abraham as a said had the choice by protocol If Abraham would have said you go back down that country we left six months ago our sheep ate it to the ground our camels grazed it to the ground there's hardly one sprig of grass left but you go there and don't you come out of there until I send word for you to come now by the law he would have been obligated to have done that because Abraham was the patriarch and he led the clan so this would have been the abrahamic plan but Abraham forfeited his right of selfishness and his own choice to be the main one now remember he didn't even have eternal life yet but he's already displaying the attribute of God and shows us of course the choice of God in his life so Abraham was waiting now it might have seemed foolish to lot that why in the world what are you waiting for God has already made his Covenant with you God's chosen you what are you waiting for do this do that take it it's yours but Abraham somehow it just feels like he's got to wait on that nod from God he's got to wait until he's sure and he's totally sink recognize with what God I mean it was what I'm talking about was what God wants for his life he felt like there was a time of possession he had the promise of possession but he felt like that his life must be synchronized with the time now I hope you understand I believe with all of my heart that we as the people of God are experiencing a great move are we not I'm so glad to be a part of it I don't know I'm telling you I've been around the message for a while now and I've seen revivals come and go you know and then it was said years and years ago by deal Moody people laughed at it and said well you know revivals don't stay and it lasts and he said well no they don't but baths don't either but it's nice to get one every now and then so it's the same way with revivals people don't understand Revival Revival comes but Revival will go but when Revival is gone to the real seed of God it leaves them with a greater determination or greater desire and they have been quickened when the Revival struck their church or struck to remove or struck their family and the others will be moved for That season and then they just wallow right back in the mess they were before the Revival came so you see we do need Revival do we not and we are by the grace of God God has allowed us this is the bride's Revival but we know in between the moves that have struck the message all types of men have tried to raise up and say well this is the bride's Revival and of course every one of them wants to claim my they're the one that got it you know they've got the superior Revelation and all them that follow them that's all the bride that's a bunch of nonsense whenever God wants to choose to send a Revival God will do it there ain't none of us going to start it and there ain't none of us going to stop it and God will do it in such a way if he wants to pick up some not head that don't hardly know nothing and we look at him that's why God won't use that fellow God will use whoever he wants to he don't need our approval he don't need for us all to vote on it and see if it's okay God will do what he wants to do is that right so you see Abraham had this about him that lot didn't have and that was that he was going to wait on God and God was going to give him the land but notice the difference now again in this between Abraham and lot lot took the land was out direct leadership from the spirit of God you see lot looked at the land with his eyes and he saw the opportunity because a lot was a true opportunist so he saw the opportunity and Abraham put it before him and he looked at the land and Lord said wow I could have this I could be that I could do that I could do that now notice he does some even consult the prophet and say but now wait a minute Prophet Uncle what what should I do Leave Me Help Me Guide Me you are the messenger of the age help me to know what I should do I'm afraid I'll make the wrong choice but instead of doing that he saw the opportunity and he sees it well I hope you understand we've had a lot of lots around this message that's right and we will until the end until the final separation comes but yet lot reflected many many types down to the ages so where Abraham waited and waited and waited on God then whenever a lot saw it lot took it now I realized there's quite a contrast there but there's also the balance of us on the other side of us seeing our inheritance and walking into what God wants us to be how many wants out as a child of God I believe God gives every one of us as it were a title D and the title unlocks and it starts in the revealing from the soul when you're truly born again then God releases your soul from every claim that was held against you at the courthouse of God so whenever you're truly born again then your deed is absolutely cleared in the presence of God then God God starts releasing little by little your inheritance of the fullness of your adoption now your adoption is not just going to be over in the Millennium but it's when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then we start growing and God look at the apostles how long did the Lord Jesus let them grow before they started manifesting their adoption well what about three days whenever they got the Holy Ghost somebody started healing the scent they didn't have to wait five years 10 years 15 years 20 years well come on somebody when they got the Holy Ghost they started Healing The Sick they started doing exactly what the Lord Jesus done they started walking in their inheritance now notice God restated that he would give God had already made this statement but now God is reverifying to his son what he's going to do and he's going to give it to him as a possession but notice God tells him to walk so signify now Abraham has got to track this entire Journey now remember he never owned any of it yet and the only place he actually ever did only had a title to was the land of shakim where that he had able to bury his wife which was in the field and the cave of Matt Pila where job was buried but all the rest of it Abraham was a Sojourner but if Abraham would have only went 20 miles this way 20 miles that way 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way from the land of their cell his children would have never went any farther than that 20 miles do you understand parents that you are not not only acting out for your own inheritance but the way you relate to church you are sowing a concept in the minds of your children the way you value the ministry the way you value Church the way you value listening to tapes and reading your Bible you are set in a boundary for your children and then what they do will set a boundary for their children so if Abraham would have won 20 miles in every direction can you imagine how hard if not impossible it would have been to ever had one Seed of Abraham to go 20 miles Beyond Basel but what did Abraham do he tracked from there as far north as God told him to go and then he went all the way down to the South and then at the widest part of Palestine which juts out a little bit near over a right where it goes the widest part around 100 45 miles the average is around 125 to 130 but he had to go over that because that little jut out went out just a little bit more what if God's got a little Judd out in my life I want to Jet over there to the Judd owl I don't want to miss an acre well come on somebody if God's got a jut out to your life why would you not want it why would you not want everything that God has given to you why would you only want 20 miles from Calvary that way 20 miles from Calvary this way 20 miles from Calvary that way and that way when God has got thousands times thousands of Acres Calvary is only to be kidding the cross is just where we get started we don't stop at Calvary that's where we start we don't stop at the cross and say well I've got the cross I've got everything the cross is the bridge that takes just across the Council on the other side it takes us to Healing it takes us to the Holy Ghost it takes us to the fullness of our inheritance does anybody want it tonight Hallelujah so Abraham's Footprints are going to be used as the survey now would anybody here tonight buy a parcel of land I am the person told you oh Farmer John mcgillicay and he stands over and he said I'll tell what boy I own 175 miles that way I own 313 miles that way and that way I'll take a half a million for it you are an absolute nut if you pay that man that kind of money without having a survey somebody to come and say he don't own no 313 miles while the man only owns 175 feet on the other side of that popper he lied to you while you own him all three and a half acres and you pay them a half a million for it while we're all too tight when it comes to giving up our daughters we're all too tight and too stingy when it comes to that oh my goodness but what about your spiritual inheritance in Christ Jesus the devil will try to get you to say now you can't go beyond that chair right there that's as far as you can go and you definitely can't go toward them drums you've only got about a 14 by 14 foot square says who devil says who devil you're the one going to give me my title devil ain't no way I

God by your feet you're voting for God and healing and his great word by your feet you say what do you mean I'm saying whatever ground is yours you're voting by your feet if you go get it that means you believe it if you set 20 feet from the cross and you never go any farther you are also voting by your feet and saying I don't believe it's all mine I don't believe I can live a happy life I don't believe I can live a delivering life well I believe I can I believe you can but it don't make no difference how much I believe you can if you don't believe you can and you cannot just stand there and say yeah I believe it well don't wear your seat mail sure off your land by your sea March from the north to the south from the East to the West let the devil know I've ever inch of ground is mine yeah oh my goodness you know Abraham believed God of course we know that he did the Bible doesn't say that of course about lot lot was a troublemaker but Abraham was a peacemaker lot's heart was centered on wealth Abraham's heart was centered on the will of God I trusted we've got some Seed of Abraham in your tonight and you see then it actually turned lot they were the best of buddies you thought and of course he was his nephew but eventually lot it set lot at war with Abraham against it so lot then entered into this trivial saying and what happened then the Shepherds began to beat around on Abraham's Shepherds and a war broke out among them what whose fault was it it was watt's fault you realize friends that that he could not walk with Abraham any farther because Abraham walked was gone now listen you're the reason that many people pull away from you and pull away from the bride of Christ it's because who we keep company with we keep company with God we keep company with the angels of God and some folks just don't like hanging around angels well I don't mind telling you I do I love hanging around Angels help me in your desk notice that you see his his the heart the heart problem of light was actually his heart the heart of every problem it's the problem of the heart the heart of every problem is the problem of the heart so God's heart was not where it needed to be with God but Abraham was and Abraham's best friend was God but lot's best friend was the world so there's no way they're going to be able to hang together or they said totally impossible so you see God told Abraham I want you to walk it so here's what's Abraham doing by his feet he's surveying the promised land now God said I want you to go all the way first you know the North and God gave him a perimeter you remember reading about that and God told him exactly where to go so he had to cover every boundary from the north to the South East to the west and claimed it for his sins our lord Jesus not only come on the earth and God a great victory for himself but he did it for us so he went as far as he could go to redeem us he brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he set the boundaries there and he said all things are possible if you only believe I'm going to tell you how far the Lord Jesus surveyed this property and he went on to say if you shall believe when you say to this mountain and don't doubt on your heart it shall be moved and nothing shall be impossible to you now remember here is the surveyor himself so he won as far north as a person could go right into the presence of God and brought back the delivery to you and I on the title deal and said all things are not just possible with God but all things are possible with you if you'll believe him how many needs help us there tonight oh yeah I guarantee we all do so you see God was telling Abraham Footprints means possession now that's all well and good if God gives it to Abraham but what about his see now does God carry on that same command to the seed or the genealogy of Abraham or does it stop just with Abraham or does God continue at all let's read Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 21 that your days may be about supplied in the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of Heaven upon the Earth for you shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him then the Lord will drive out all these nations from before you and you shall Perse yes greater Nations and mightier than yourselves I mean he's got an enemy tonight that seems greater than you you need to possess it here's your promise now notice they're not equal to or your enemy is less than God's telling them right up front I'm gonna let y'all know right now your enemy is bigger than you your enemy is greater than you but not me and you together it's bigger than you but it's not bigger than me and you because we are a team well praise the Lord notice in every place watch God now in every place well for the soul oh The Souls of your The Souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours found the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea which is the Mediterranean shall be your code so from the Euphrates now the number we're going East-West from the Euphrates over to the Mediterranean Sea and then from the Lebanon which is north of course on down to the South what's God doing God has the title D do you understand they never did possess this they never not even dated or Solomon under the great reign of Solomon none of them ever went all the way over to the river Euphrates which is in Iraq oh my goodness the Palestinians are all been out of shape because Israel's got their Land wait till they take over a rat too [Applause] oh that's where the devil is I'll just stay a little bit of spot yeah I'd say you know don't don't venture out very far oh we believe the message we believe God sent a prophet and we ain't got enough picture to even come to the house of God we ain't got enough venture to fight the devils and to be able to let Satan know where we stand oh yeah we believe the message Satan ain't scared of you just saying that along what he's scared of the Prophet said what we need in Jeffersonville is hundreds of lived voices the Thunder that'll shake the devil there you go brother that thundering life of a child of God that not only quotes the quotes that live so close and manifest the quote and let the power of God live out of your life [Applause] a listen to this there shall no man no man be able to stand before you for the Lord shall God shall lay the fear of God oh my goodness for the Lord notice the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall oh my goodness here's this verb again so they got to be walking so you mean they can't set it home and just stream it they can just conquer for just sitting at home and that's that's what I love the message folks oh you know they don't need to go to church so they just sit at home I tell my folks are sick I'm telling my folks that are well Bodied and that well I just don't need to go to church I just don't need it well goats I guess don't but real sheep need to go to the house of God because the word tells them to go so you've got a Treads you've got to move you can't sit still you ain't just sit there and look at somebody well what are we going to do today trading brother tread tread why are we going to tread on serpents and scorpions well tread over evil we'll try to over cancer well tried over high blood low blood no blood we will tread on ours until we take every inch of our ground I wonder what you all think of how it is when you pray of how Satan reacts what is the imagery in your mind of you pray Lord God I need this Lord I need that father my kids is Grouchy my wife ain't doing right Lord I think I'm the only one left really God I pray you'd help all of them but me I'm just so glad you put me on the earth Lord we need to get rid of our self-righteousness cast herself at the mercy of God and say God I need help God I I need help and then when we do that then what do you think the devil does you all think the devil's down in Hell life and it's your prayer if you're living where you need to be living and you know your position in Christ Jesus Devils Tremble When you pray it's not you that ought to be afraid of the devil it ought to be the devil afraid of you the Bible tells you if you'll resist the devil he will not towards you he's going to go the other way God will put the dread of you on demons God will put the dread of you on cancer on sickness on depression on anxiety and when anxiety gets near you anxiety will say oh no you better not get around him you better not get around her but of course oh I'm so pray for me I can hang on to Wednesday night what time is it Wednesday evening pray for me I'll make it well down there I don't feel it word the Bible say you had to feel anything when are you ever gonna learn you ain't gonna overcome a Hell by feeling anything you're going to overcome hell whenever you feel nothing understanding your positions the word of God my friends I saw a little bit of the excerpt of the service here Sunday my goodness a hypocrite could be able to shout and run and shout and carry on under the anointing though that was your son if it didn't hit you that way I wonder about you but that is when you overcome it's when you walk outside them doors and you don't feel nothing when you walk outside them doors and all hell breaks against and you say back off devil back off devil I'm the same child of God was running around that building I'm the same child of God with the same Holy Ghost with the same promise and you're on my land and I don't allow any trespassing on my land foreign there's a little varmint that's been trespassing mine and Carol's Home it's about that tall not that long got rings around its tail and he's wearing a mask like a bandit and he truly is abandoned but apparently this Bandit went to school because he found out a way to open up our refrigerator door on the back porch so he's been helping himself to my goods oh man he's been helping himself to my goods which you won't help me by and as far as I know none of you help me buy that for no raccoon you did not give it to me and say well brother don't you buy the of sandwiches buy the this and buy the that no I didn't buy it for no and I don't want no eating it and my wife sure don't want no either she was out there today and she was madder than a hornet there was tracks all over everywhere her unless and then out there cleaning the back porch and they was tracks on the counter they was Paul Prince on the refrigerator they was punched here and there and the other there was flames of fire dancing in her eyes and it wasn't a pillar of fire neither [Applause] so I told her don't get mad at me get mad as I come we've got to do something down I said all right so I went to Tractor Supply and I'm hoping that I've got a hairy garment or a varmint in that Triumph when I get home I put him some sweet little marshmallows I put him some orange old man alive when he comes in that back porch I even took on the screams off and made him an easy entrance I'm hoping when I get home so if any of you in the neighborhood hear somebody let out a big Squall you know man the how to fight I'll tell you one thing I don't like it whenever he trespasses and he tears up my screen how much more do I not like it when the devil trespasses my peace and the devil devil trespasses your home and your health and your family and your husband and your wife we ought to say devil out of here Jesus Christ purchases for me and don't belong to you now the difference between me and that is my footprints on that back porch means it's mine he ain't got no title deep and he shows up after Dark well praise the Lord that sounds like the devil don't it I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge him if I don't catch him I'm

leave this world but you gotta start brother Footprints is possession ministering brethren don't be afraid to put Footprints what God has told you to go it's possession he told Joshua everyone The Souls of your feet set that's yours amen we don't back up we take what God Said that's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems if God said so it's yours would he give it to Joshua he never said I'll take all the havites and the Philistines I give it to you Joshua had to fight for every inch of God oh my goodness every inch that's about your inches right so you mean I've got to fight for every inch that I get in God not only to take it but to keep it many times friends that's where we fail we take three steps forward and four backwards and then we say oh God when's the next news early when's the next year's convention yeah yeah oh Lord have mercy it's July I'll never make I'll never make it oh no what am I gonna do come on you're pitiful don't make strides in these used conventions and then come here and sell like a bunch of them I don't know what pump them Footprints into action oh my notice this God was with him in every inch of the ground you'll cover brother to make Footprints you'll fight way through how do we get it Exodus 23 30. by little and little oh man who measured this out well I was hoping his furlongs by furlongs when you were kilometers by kilometers or continent by continent you mean that's the way God told him right up front this is the way y'all gonna get this land by little and little not little and lot I'd have been even a little more comforted but little by little you mean I fight foreign how much did I gain three inches three inches yeah oh wow I'm gonna have to rest oh somebody fight for me please you fight for me brother up what what kind of friend are you I can help you but don't you understand it's not me it's not these preachers that are your favorite ones and you say oh I get so much well what do you do with what you get look friends remember I think I'll forget sometimes opposite Pentecostal before I come to this message and I got to a place I was so dependent on gifts so dependent boy the Lord had to teach me some lessons [Music] there was two little brothers in this Cherokee Indians Carl and Willie was their names but the car was really gifted whenever I needed something from the Lord I'd go over there to Russell Springs near where they lived at my other Lord would just show him stuff and show him this and show him that we're going to sit down in the living room sitting there just go to talking about the Lord and the goodness of the Lord and they had a lamp right at the end of the sofa that lamp would start going off and on off and on off and on by itself and he said that brother Donnie you've got a need say yes I do well let's just pray so they go to pray and praying oh but brother Donnie was building up a great big pacifier I mean that dude was about that big around and about that long so every time I got in trouble I would call him brother Carl Brother Willie some other brothers that I knew in Pentecost that was gifted all one particular time and Coast I met the other day I was going through such a storm in my life and it was on a Sunday a Nitro Carol said I just got to go seek all the women I just got to have got to I believe the Lord is leading me well I missed church on Sunday morning and drove over to Carl and Willy's house but guess what man I got where Carl and where he lives Carlton really wasn't there so we sat out in the car and sat out in the car and burned up and sat out in the car went to a little store and got something to drink we sat out in the car and we sat out in the car and after a while I went home I was so defeated huh yeah oh I know a lot of preachers ain't going to tell you stuff like this about them but you know what I figured this will help somebody it's worth me being humiliated a lot of preachers want to tell you how God always answers their prayers and everything like that don't you never believe that don't you never believe God answers every prayer though I ever preacher praised it now that's a bunch of Lies there ain't no such a truth to no such thing absolutely not that'll only tell you why I pray for someone's on this happen they won't tell you when they fall flight on their face but they do just like all the rest of us oh my I was so low and I was so low and so low and I oh God what am I going to do God what am I going to do but you see what Donnie had done God God eat Donnie had got to the place he was so dependent on A Gifted Man that I couldn't have Victory Without A Gifted Man oh Hallelujah my aren't you glad I've changed since then at least some anyway I wouldn't be much of a leader would I but you see God knew what he had in his mind for me so he had to take me through that school that's the reason it really bothers me friends when I see a lot of our message people getting behind certain gifted ones and they can only get revived and really fired up around certain preachers yeah you're heading the same path oh Donnie does it may not be Carl and really they may have different names but the result is going to be the same thing you see God wants us to stand on his word listen to the sermon listen to the sermon in Shreveport in 1965 I listened to it going down to brother David's and coming back from Brother David's works his faith Express and you'll find the prophet of God saying that gifts are only minors I find this so strange that we're all of a sudden but you're going to hear according from here the prophet said that gifts are minors and you can never make a major out of a minor come on children we do not take the Rapture by gifts God's Prophet said we take the Rapture by the word you will not take your inheritance my gifts you will not take your possession by emotion you will take it by a god-given face and you stand right there and say Satan in the name of Jesus give me my property I need my healing I need my Deliverance I need peace don't you believe in gifts sure do in the right place gifts are minors not majors only someone writing re-writing the symphony makes gifts majors don't get quiet on me now the Divine Symphony of this age so the message of Malachi 4 says they are minors and if we're not careful about going to get just off the Pentecostals we won't believe unless we've got a gift [Music] y'all done a little studying on it while I was gone and a film where the Prophet said many people the evangelists come soon praise for all the sick and he said then people leave the vanishes to leave and they'll thank their Pastor ain't nobody but he said your pastor's got just as much right as I do to pray for the sick y'all don't like that quote oh no we don't hear quot you don't have much power does it well it does to me same prophet of God that said the other said that as a matter of fact I also heard him say the other day that he was praying for a bunch of people in a prayer life and for this reason for whatever time reason I'm not sure but he stood real close to the end of the prayer line instead of up front and he said he let the pastors be up front and he said a big portion of the people were already healed by the time they got to him wow who would have ever thought such a thing was even possible almighty God almighty God but you see what we do we link our possession to a certain man we link our possession to a certain type of service oh my this Oh Glory to God hallelujah tell you what I got so much I got so much show me what you got left after three days [Applause] testing one two one two tests Footprints means possession not screaming not holler not jumping marching around the building thank God thank God that if he got enough entry to March around it tonight good oh notification in the wheelchairs and on this church God promised you healing and you'll have to fight for every inch of it the devil will make you fight with the sword of God notice not running no jumping not in motion the devil will make you fight not you and your posture not you and your favorite evangelist you you but remember footsteps it's possession whatsoever your foot Transat have I given to you every step you can make you know that gets me feeling religious wow so here's what brother Branham feeling religious hearing about people getting their inheritance you know that gets me feeling religious footsteps is possession all the land that your feet will tread upon him this promised land it's yours it's the same to every believer tonight anything that you can take any Divine promise of God and claim it and hold it it's yours amen I'm gonna need some more of your land tonight and you're going to pray for him I'm going to get it no they'll not I will pray for that God will give you strength and if I pray for every one of you here tonight I'll pray with all in my heart but that's not the way you're going to get it you're gonna get it by you setting your feet not me setting mine on your inheritance and me concrete they do the praying me do the studying media all of that and then I turn I said here you go oh Glory got a few more minutes notice this this I love this speak to the wrong we'll just save a little time let's jump down the very bottom of it that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch well you know God just didn't go over there and take a broom and sweep out Canaan now wouldn't that be something man alive I mean God just takes pornography and he just takes a big old Holy Ghost friend go let's just go God sweeps out temper God just sleeps out everything that gets in our way God just gets that big old wide brim and say you get on out of here you're leaving this alone you hear me don't you bother him no more don't you bother Jackie he's my boy and he said come on Jackie just sit down in here honey I mean get you a big moon pie and a big glass of tea and sit back in this Morris chair don't order more cherries you have no idea it was the Forerunner of the Lazy Boy I'm afraid a lot of us have got lazy boys and lazy girls were reclined back at the quotes glory to God we got thumbitis we click ah oh Jesus I guess I better call brother and see if king of Daniel fix all this all the amorites and the Hittites sweep them out and say come on in Israel this is yours they've even planted the crops for you now buddy that right there is that our idea of a Promised Land glory to God I mean God just said hey y'all hear me get me get plant their favorite fruits you plant her favorite vegetables you set up grocery stores you set up everything just the way they wanted and don't you touch one bite of it and when you get it all done you just gently walk out of here and I mean it now yes sir yes sir yes sir and they walked in boy there there was just big nanners hanging everywhere that was onions and cantaloupes and everything and that's such a praise God I'm talking about a victory victory is mine victory is mine know it Arc you just walked in and took it was that hot in yours it's just me they had to fight for every inch of the way that's right they had the promise of Victory but God told Joshua we're the soldier of your foot tread that have I given to you so Footprints meant possession remember that sister in the wheelchair Footprints means possession every time the soles of your feet touch it that's it you say I couldn't wiggle my finger yesterday but I can wiggle it today now you see God will perform Miracles and maybe bring somebody out of the wheelchair instantly but he don't do everybody that way Divine Healing in a miracle it's not the same thing so how do some people get healed by the miraculous power of God well they lose one pain and then another pain and then another pain and then they go for a week and they realize you know what I'm getting my strength back praise the Lord hallelujah I I'm feeling a little bit better I said brother can you leap over a troop and jump through a wall no I can't do that or vice versa I'm still so we can't I can't hardly go and somebody'll go to God it didn't happen to me that way I'll tell you one thing I've got prayed for I'll come out of like a boat a lot and hit me but that might have been a bolt for them it don't mean it's a boat for you God may want to prove your face and let others look at you and say I want you to look at that I want you to look at that brother I want you to look at that sister she barely barely just moves that little finger but you see her she said glory to God glory to God now some of you all y'all to be ashamed of yourself you've got both hands both arms and you can do this some people all they can

people say Lord have mercy just leave them alone little by little if that's the way they come praise God then let's just go ahead and take the victory let's encourage one another or we don't know if you're gonna say I'd be ashamed of myself if I should if they drop off a pill a day it may take them six years to get to it they ain't taking none but praise God they're on the way notice so today
