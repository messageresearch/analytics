it's already [Music] done presence to speak to Hearts to reveal himself to you personal way because he's a personal God we're here to Worship the Lord together with the Parker and reer Reagan family today and just to celebrate this life and the great victory that we have in Jesus Erica Le Reagan Parker was born September 2nd 1979 to Carol and Donnie Reagan Erica went home to be with the Lord October 17th 20 20 23 serving the lord Jesus Christ was her greatest achievement and Erica put her Christian walk and love of God above all else and her husband and family were the next dearest things to her heart she loved and lived fearlessly Erica battled cancer like the warrior she was he did not take her home but Jes Jesus rescued her and it brought her to her Eternal home left to grieve her passing as her loving husband Lance the precious daughters Emma Eliana Leah and Maria parents Donnie and Carol Reagan Greg and Cynthia Parker sister Alicia bab and husband Scott Sister Crystal hit and husband Larry five nieces Ashley and Courtney bab Caroline Bella and Amilia Kate hit and special Uncle Harry Reagan and wife Karen cousin Justin Reagan and wife Sydney and baby Jude and grandmother Louise Oliver and grandmother Ula Smith a host of aunts and uncles and cousins and I also want to say that a host of friends and Believers from around the world has stood by wept many tears and today on their behalf I want to convey to you alone all bears are Justin ra the Bible said of saints like Erica in Hebrews 11:13 that these all promises but Haven seen them a far off and were pers of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and P pilgrims on the earth and as a member of the bride of Christ she's identified also in this statement I take this from God of this evil age but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride this person here there here somewhere else off some other Church some other denomination whatever it is believes the word of God obedient waiting in love for the promise of the AIDS to be con confirmed she is watching for it she is part of the word and she is watching for her life to manifest that word you see Erica waited and believed for the promise here and now she waits for his fulfillment with the Saints there it's it's difficult very difficult when we come to moments like these or sincere and Earnest prayers were made and yet the results were were not what we believed and hoped for not having received the promise but yet Believers see them and even though they seem a far off as something there that they just can't grasp or take they embrace them and their confession with their confession they show that there are strangers upon this Earth and that they're not of this world no matter what comes their faith never wavers did we believe well with all our hearts we believed did we embrace the truth that God heals and heals even cancer yes we Embrace that truth we held it close to our hearts we clung to it believing did God even hear our hearts cries Psalms 58 says you keep track of all my sorrows you have collected all my tears in your bottle you have recorded each one in your book you've kept track of my every toss and turn through the sleepless nights each tear entered into your Ledger each ache written in your book well if God heard then what was wrong with our faith well then we have to ask the question really what is faith faith faith is a revelation of the will of God and we embraced and we took hold of the promise of Divine Healing that our God heals and our God delivers we along with Erica clung to every promise and we wouldn't let it go right to the very end of life and like her we were adamant and unshakable we testified we confessed and yes we believed this is Faith and there was nothing wrong with it it was unwavering it was righteousness it was pure and holy and it pleased God we have done what God wanted us to do it is his will for us to believe and to confess and to stand firm with faith believing and this makes God proud and his heart glad to see a people Sons and Daughters who will stand firm believing and then when God delivers in a way that we didn't want or we didn't expect we love and we believe him anyway today even when we look death in the face we continue to do it with great faith we will continue to fight the good fight of faith we will war against sin we will war against evil of every kind we will continue to war against demons of sickness we will war against cancer and against every kind of sickness and disease that comes against us we have not lost Erica did not die faithless but a woman full of Faith she entered into the Arms of Jesus she declared victory in the face of death and some of our last words were Satan you have messed up up her faith never wavered her confidence in the Lord never ceased she fought and she won the cancer she warded with is dead but she is still living she is a warrior and a hero of Faith Hallelujah we prayed and we prayed for the cancer to die well today the cancer is dead every Cancer cell in her body perished but not Erica she is more alive than ever she is not less alive she is more alive she didn't get less of Jesus she got more of Jesus she stepped into the realm of perfect love into the presence of the Lord into a perfect body amen DL Moody said soon you will read in the newspaper that I'm dead but don't you believe it for a moment I will be more alive than ever before on his deathbed he said Earth recedes and Heaven opens for me you see Erica looked to God with a Resolute faith for healing she believed God heals all diseases amen even cancer Deuteronomy 7:15 says and the Lord will take away from you all sickness and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known I want you to take notice this no sickness is from God he said he takes away sickness not that he brings it he promised that he would not afflict us with any of the terrible diseases of Egypt all sickness is from the de God did not bring it but he will take it away it is a foreign life a demonic life and as Believers we have the right and authority to cast it out faith is a super sense that you use because of the Life of Christ within you it comes from your new birth when FF Bosworth was sent by the spirit to pray for the sick he asked Lord but suppose I preach healing and the people come and they don't get healed and the Lord responded if people didn't get saved would you wouldn't stop preaching the gospel of Salvation would you amen you see as as we think of this we realize we have a responsibility to to believe in the hour of Crisis no matter the outcome because he heals all diseases amen and and I want you just to consider the four living creatures Before the Throne which the anointing comes for deliverance in the Book of Revelation the four living creatures of the lion the calf the man and the eagle are all the Holy Spirit of anointings and each face is a different aspect of the Holy Spirit and and of his power of Deliverance and as we pray God responds to our faith by looking our way with the facet of his Deliverance when the lion anointing of um empowers a person's faith it is a boldness and a great courage with tentious tenacious fight for healing the faith that are never backed down the eagle anointing is is the miracle it is like the Rapture that oh you know once you're deathly eel and the next moment there's no symptom or sign of it the man anointing it is still God healing but he uses the intelligence of a man yeah God will use surgeons and medicines with knowledge that came from him for his healing work and if there are any of you nurses and doctors here today that was that was an aid and blessed us in this moment of Crisis we want to thank you for being here and being a part of God's healing work but if the ox anointing looks your way it's death but God heals even in death whatever way God responds it's all healing because he will heal you even if it's taking you into another dimension there is not a disease that God does not heal healing is yours by the atonement the question that we often Ponder is why why would God take a little life that was so precious and so sweet why would Jesus why would he jerk her suddenly out of her loved one's arms well that's not the God that I know and it's not the god of the Bible but this is something though that many misunderstand about God they think of him as some heartless God that would rip a family apart but rather when Erica's little house could no longer sustain her because it was broken down by illness Jesus was there to receive her and to give her complete health and a new house not made with hands one that this Earthly body at best only reflected a poor image of when God made this Earth he made it a paradise everything he made was good God is not the author of death God is the author of life but when man Sinn to the Earth and defiled his Purity it was God who went immediately to work to bring reconciliation to man and all this time since man's fall God has been working to bring Heaven back to man again and almost in the same instance of the Fall God released a plan that he would come as a seed the seed of a woman who would bruise the head of the serpent and deliver man from the fear and the bondage of death that's why Jesus came when man couldn't keep bring couldn't bring Heaven upon the Earth nor could go to heaven God came to Earth and brought Heaven down and while upon the Earth Jesus showed his plan of reconciliation every and everything he did when he attended funerals he raised the dead he opened the eyes of the blind to show he restores the sights he healed the leper to show he is Lord over the most dreaded diseases and this brings us to the shortest verse of the Bible in John 1133 when Jesus came along with Lazarus when Lazarus was dead and he saw Mary and Martha weeping he also came and groaned in the spirit and was troubled and he asked where have they laid him and they said Lord come and see and the Bible said Jesus wept now Jesus knew he was dead he had told his disciples he sleeps and this well if he sleeps he's doing good he said no he's dead and I go to waking he already knew he would resurrect him but there's no record that he went crying and weeping along the way so as he goes to the tomb of Lazarus he already knows he's going to have this great Victory and Lazarus is going to raise from the dead so why weep now perhaps he groan with humanity and Mourns with them at their loss and their deep sorrow truly I want you to know this God is a compassionate God who Sorrows when we sorrow who hurts when we hurt who feels our pains and I tell you he Comforts us in our time of Sorrow he Comforts those that mourn perhaps he groaned within himself because he knew that death didn't have to happen to man that funerals and graveyards were never in his plan and won't be in the new world to come he had made Adam and placed him in paradise and man didn't have to know evil and Sorrows of pain and suffering and death perhaps he wept perhaps the reason that he wept that Jesus knew the joys of Heaven's Paradise that Lazarus was now experiencing and he had to call him back to this Shadow land that we live in this place that is so inferior to that one perhaps he wept because he had to bring Lazarus back to a body that would get sick and die again to a world full of evil and trouble maybe perhaps that's why he wept I think I think he truly wept realizing he would have to bring him back here that he would have to live upon this life a little longer you see he made a for us and Paul would tell us you know of his visitation there it's so wonderful words I don't have words or vocabulary to describe it and Jesus said I know what heaven is like in my father's house or many mansions in the past four days Lazarus body a body so sick it would no longer hold life had been wept over and lovingly in tuned but Lazarus was not dead dead he was still alive all this time and after his final difficult breath here he was living on a body that could no longer be touched by death or pain a body that is a mansion compared to this one this body at best is described as a pest house full of rats Vermin and diseases a body of humiliation no wonder Jesus wept there that place he had to call Lazarus from in that place there is no more Struggle No More Sorrow no more old age no more infant of days no young mothers dying no more hunger no more worry no sickness No More Death no wonder Jesus wept for 4 days Lazarus had experienced love and joy beyond measure a body so Superior to this mortal flesh he was there meeting and being with Saints and Friends of the present and ages past no wonder Jesus wept to have to bring him back no doubt as we have had friends and relatives come by and shake hands and greet and we give our well wishes and our words to our loved ones here no doubt there was a land in that Land There was a huge procession each one waiting to grasp her hand to hug her neck to welcome her in let me tell you those who have went over on the other side and come back don't want to come back here they said no don't let me have to return today arica would not want to come back she is there in the presence of the Lord where there is perfect love where and and it's clear to us that Jesus made a path to to life and from Death he said I go to prepare place and it will be heaven for you so that when your mortal frame can no longer sustain life I will receive you that where I am you may be also Erica a woman of faith it was her faith that took her home [Applause] hallu [Music] Rock of Ages clear for me let me me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood

brother Tim for your message of comfort that you brought to us today it was a blessing I want to offer my sincere condolences to to brother Donnie sister Carol brother Lance and the girls sister Lish and brother Scotty to the families and the church family and the friends of sister Erica I know her passing from this life has left an empty place in our hearts my prayer is that God will fill that empty place with his presence and that in the coming days that God would comfort the hearts of all those that mourn on behalf of the family we would like to offer a sincere thank you for all your prayers and for all you've done to help the family through this difficult time may God bless you richly for the food that you prepared for the hugs the handshakes the tears the the labor the flowers the cards and for your kindness and for all those around the world that took the time to stream this service may God bless you we are gathered here to pay our respects to sister Erica Lee Reagan Parker to each of us here sister Erica's life meant something she was a friend a daughter a wife a mother a niece a sister a sister-in-law a sister in Christ and her life has somehow touched our lives and her graduation from this life has brought us here together this afternoon and though our hearts are heavy we do not mourn as those who have no hope we have been given a revelation that death is only a carriage that takes a Believer into the presence of their God David said in the Book of Psalms precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints for death is only another way that God has to bring his children home in the world we live in today we have all kinds of Heroes there's Sports Heroes there's military Heroes there's even what they call in comic strips in movies superheroes a Batman and a Superman a Wonder Woman woman super girl even the Bible speaks of Heroes in Hebrews chap 11 as brother Tim referred it's known as The Heroes of Faith who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness was made strong waxed vient and fight turned to flight the army of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings a moreover bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy Heroes of the faith so just for a few minutes of your time this afternoon I like to speak about another hero this hero never wore a ball Jersey or played on the great iron they never wore a military uniform F on a foreign Battleground they never wore a hero's costume and never flew through the air or leaped over tall buildings but this hero I wish to speak about was a petite little woman named Erica Lee Reagan Parker a warrior of Faith who from the time she was a little girl she fought a battle for her health but I remember when Erica was little she was a lively one feisty if you will determined and courageous I heard someone say Fearless brother Jeremy Asher was telling us the other night that he used to sing when brother Jeremy was a little boy he'd sing about with his mouth about that wide open and he said sister ER used to S to church while he was singing she would mock him just do her mouth like that sister car said if I'd have seen her do that I'd have wore her out amen I can still see her in my mind coming into church as a little girl she was a fasty one for sure and as she grew into a young teenager she gave her heart to God at about the age of 11 or 12 received the Holy Ghost became a devout Christian she married Lance Parker and even though she battled with health problems that plagued her from her childhood sister Erica became a mother and had not one but two sets of twin girls and like all Hero Stories there is a villain and this villain in this story was cancer and as the battle begin to rage we begin to see that she was just not a little petite woman named Erica but we begin to see that we had a hero a warrior of the faith and brother Lance not knowing that what was in my heart to speak on told me Erica was my hero brother Lance said you take someone who is in a burning building and the fire is all around you and he said all of a sudden someone comes busting in and pulls you out of the fire he said that person would always be a hero to you brother Lance said that's what Erica was to me she was and always will be my hero a real Christian Solomon one of the wisest men in the Bible understood the value of a virtuous woman for he said in Proverbs 31 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies Solomon said who could find such a woman is this the price of such a person far exceeds the price of rubies she is a rarity a gem more valuable than rubies one to be sought out one to be found one to be cherished like a precious Jewel for a woman of this caliber would without a doubt be a devoted Christian one committed to her belief and her faith in God a virtuous woman would be an example to the community that she lived in she would be an inspiration to those who are around her Solomon said who could find such a one as this and I like to say this afternoon that we found one and sister Erica to me sister Erica was an inspiration such a mighty warrior of Faith she loved to hear the word preached I remember the times in Ministry to see her just drink up the word and and the smile that it brought to her face she enjoyed church and many times I'm sure she came came even though she didn't feel like it she came in fact I've seen her laying on the couch in the study with brother Lance by her side watching the service on the monitor because she wasn't able to sit in church yet she came because sister Erica was a virtuous woman she just didn't say she was a Christian with her words she said it with her life she was a warrior a hero of faith we read in Timothy Paul knew that his time of departing was at hand and Paul was confessing to Timothy I have been faithful I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith Paul said I was beaten but I kept the faith I was in prison but I kept the faith I was forsaken but I kept the faith I was cast down but I kept the faith Paul championed over his hardships and he finished the course and like Paul sister Erica saw hardship ship but she kept the faith she saw disappointments but she kept the faith she saw sickness but she kept the faith she endured trials but she kept the faith every doctor's report every scan every negative report every treatment every transfusion every pain episode every time she battled the weakness the fatigue the low blood counts she kept the faith she testified of the goodness of God she encouraged her children to serve God she told one of her daughters never forget we serve a mighty God in fact some of the last comments as brother Tim said that she made she told brother Donnie she said Dad Satan has messed up this time a hero of faith and no matter how many times that Satan tried to knock her down her faithfulness to God and his promises caus to get up and to run again she never gave up the fight she never stopped claiming her healing she never stopped praying for others and you can even see on the Facebook of people had posted that she text them and reached out to them and said she was praying for them in their times of difficulty and in their times of hurting she never stopped smiling she never stopped letting her light shine and she finished the course that was set before her sister Erica was fi faithful a real Warrior of Faith a hero the mayor of the city never knew her name the governor of Tennessee he never met her president of the United States he don't know who she is she was never on the cover of Life magazine never made woman of the year and yet because of her faith and her stand for God's word and his promises her name is known around the world her faith in the God who created her has inspired all of us to believe for the impossible they have even wrote songs about her condolences have come in from around the world the last few days Facebook has been flooded with her picture with those who loved her who wanted to be identified with her and yet she felt like a nobody the humbleness of a real hero of Faith her name has been brought Before the Throne of God hundreds if not thousands of times and just a few days ago the call came for everyone to pray earnestly thousands around the world begin to pray bringing her name Before the Throne of God and no doubt the Lord looked in his book of remembrance for the Bible said then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him and for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and no doubt he saw her name was in the book he saw she was tired he saw she was suffering and in great pain he saw that she had kept the faith that had not wavered from her testimony he saw that it was time and he commanded death for God God is death's master and God commanded death and said death go get my daughter and bring her home and as she crossed that great Chasm death carrying her she begin to change her long hair that had been lost to chemo begin to flow in The Winds of Glory as she be to walk through that tall blue grass her body that was weak became strong again young again she began to see the Saints who had gone before her come running towards her to welcome her another great hero of Faith Erica Lee Reagan Parker had made it home you young sisters looking for a hero model you won't find one in Hollywood youon won't find one on a Mion a fashion magazine but look right here God placed one right before you you say brother darl but she lost oh no no she never lost God creates win-win situations for his people the cancer that held Erica's body did not defeat her she may have had cancer but cancer never had her you see Christians don't die they just changed Dwelling Places the prophet said you see a little flower how it standing pretty and sometimes it's young and sometimes it's middle-aged and sometimes it's old but when the frost hits it it dies it bows its little head sheds off its petals out of there drops a little black seed and did you know they have a funeral possession for a flower sure well as October winds come by and the fall rains Just Cry tears down out of the sky and they bury that little seed down under the ground but just let the warm spring Sun begin to shine on that dirt just a little bit it'll bring forth another flower because there's a germ of life in there that no science can find and if God made a way for a flower to live again how much more has he made a way from man who's in his own image when the son of righteousness Rises those who sleep in the dust of the Earth shall rise again for death is but a servant to carry a child of God into the presence of their God that's why precious is the death of saints in the sight of God listen Emma Ellie Leah Maria your mama didn't lose she won she's in a new body no pain no suffering she just changed Dwelling Places you said brother Daryl did we not have good faith to believe that that God was going to heal her I say we had great faith Faith because we sit here this day accepting her passing as the will of God you see to Believers his no to our prayers are just as good as his yeses I was telling the local church here the other night in the military we had 11 General Orders that we carried out as soldiers how to conduct ourselves for an example a general order was to never leave our post of Duty until properly relieved even in the case of an emergency but a direct order would be move out now our general orders in God's Army is to pray for the sick and lay our hands upon them and stand and believe the promises of God our general orders things that we do as Christians but there comes a direct order from God so death bring my daughter home and that supersedes all orders we never failed God God never failed us he just had a different plan go rest high upon on that mountain your battle here sister Erica is all done go to heaven just a shout your battle's over you never lost you won a hero a warrior of Faith but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so then also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with with them until that time let us labor I want to be there that day when he passes out crowns to see sister Erica get hers I want to have my hands up praising God for a Victorious life and I trust if you're not ready make preparations that you can stand there with us that day may the Lord bless you may he Comfort the family is my prayer God [Music] [Music] bless

God s his pure sweet love aside from above on the [Music] wings in 2 Samuel chapter 22 verse 31 I sent these words to sister Erica a few months ago as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried and he is a buckler to all of them that trust in him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like H's feet and he Seth at me upon a high places he teacheth My Hands to War so that a bow of Steel is broken in my arms thou Hast given me the shield of thy salvation and gentleness hath made me great thou H has enlarge my steps under me so that my feet did not slip I dedicate this next verse to her life I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them and turn not again until I have consumed them today incredible words have been said about sister Esther there have been books written The Book of Ruth the Book of Esther but today another chapter chapter has came and it's called The Book of Erica she's a modern hero as it's already been said looks like when the weakest of Christians they look so weak but really the weakest of Christians shake the kingdom of hell when they bow on their knees they Shake all of hell today in hell they know know that they can't torment her no more they didn't have enough to take her her frail little body her frail little lady tormented the kingdom of hell and every morning that she awoke much to the demise of the enemy whether it was in a whisper or a testimony to her children she knew I'm not going to die and she had a confidence I'm not going to die and I want to tell you she didn't I stand here as one that fights the same disease a terrible disease called cancer cancer whether it's stage one or stage four whether it's no matter whether it's in your organs or in your brain or your lung lungs are running throughout your body cancer can't win God knew when she was released into the Earth and who she would be born the tree of lineage that she would come from she would be born the daughter of and I'm not ashamed to say it one of the most powerful preachers that's ever lived on the face of the entire globe he has shook hell and she said as each child and amen and worshiped we watched her life we stood at her wedding what an incredible wedding that she had watched her and her husband fight fight the Battle of cancer together watched her beautiful children as they begin to grow up cancer couldn't destroy her relationship with her husband with her beautiful daughters with her daddy and mama her families uncles [Music] cousins cancer is limited fearful but it's limited because we serve a supernatural God and we realize that every moment of our life is so precious because we're not we're not promised tomorrow maybe the doctors haven't told you that you're fighting cancer and you could die at any night but every one of us our time is limited Erica preached as powerful sermons as her daddy did there was no amens or screams Hallelujah a lot of times her sermons came from a quiet bed nobody was around but her life and her breath and her thoughts on God and what what it's all about she never gave up she never gave in cancer can take your a lot of things of your abilities of life but it can't take your mind and it can't take your soul it can't take your love for God you can stare it right in the face knowing that the Holy Ghost is planted inside of your life and you got a promise it's been said before if you hear that I have died don't you believe it for a second because I will be much more alive there than here Erica stands today in her beauty her pictures of her beautifulness she was beautiful without hair she was beautiful in every way that beauty will last it will live you will see it and every time that you look at her daughters she lives every time you see into their eyes she lives their flowing hair their mild nature she lives doctors did their best and nurses did their best they gave her the best medicine that they knew but there was one with an inoculation he's not having to test his product she's enjoying the Cure she had bucket Lites to do she enjoyed a vacation the other day with her family I prayed every night and every day knowing what it means to me to spend time with my family when I heard she got to go into town and enjoy your company to go to the beach and hear the sounds you took pictures you enjoyed that in a few days she'll she'll want to be your host cuz she's enjoying a place her book continues her hero moments live on for those of us that fight cancer today she is a hero I think about another spot if you could just give me a minute or two you know there was a man that had difficult days in his life and his name was job when God came to him he never talked to him about the sores he never talked to him about all the difficulties of feeling so alone where was you Erica when I laid the foundations of the Earth where was you at when the sons and the daughters sang for Glory I did it all for you you're just getting ready to begin it I sent this note to her on on a few different occasions on the roughest of days the lowest hours of our despair it is even in those times that we're still chosen we're still blessed we're still favored amen we're still forgiven we're still loved we're still LED of God Victorious amen we are inheritors of all of Heaven's glory amen privileged to walk with our own Creator married to the king of kings and he calls us his beloved we're strong in faith we're armed to fight Devils we're entrusted with God's word the most powerful weapon protected by the arm of the almighty he has placed as a head edge around us and we have an assurance that every time that we call he hears and he answers for he is our God we're very much aware we can have the best doctors and we can have the best medicine we can have the best preachers but he has the final say Amen our god is perfect we may not understand everything
