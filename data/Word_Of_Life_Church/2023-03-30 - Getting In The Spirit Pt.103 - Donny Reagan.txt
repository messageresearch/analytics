really do it now [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord maybe I should go out and come back again we'll just start over again oh where was that isn't it a privilege to be a Christian serving the lord I don't believe there's anything the devil finds any harder than God's people do you going to church loving him serving him not ought to let us know though what a threat we are to the kingdom of hell if men the devil was the best of buddies y'all are in a mess I'll tell you that right now so would I be but if he hates you then you ought to say praise the lord the devil hates me when I get up he hates me when I go to bed he hates me he hates me and brother Jack the feelings are totally Mutual aren't they praise the Lord let's turn tonight if you would First Corinthians chapter 3 we'll read verse verse 7. we'll just leave them we'll take them or you take them all right okay First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 7. let's listen at the great master builder now I believe the Lord truly had a church in the book of Acts the way he wanted a church that he himself founded and he gave the plans to his god-called men in that day Paul calls himself the master builder that word is octuron which is an architect an architect so Peter never claimed that he was nor did James nor John so there must have been something special that God gave to Paul First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 7. so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but God that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that wadereth are one and every man shall receive of his own reward according to his own labor now remember our reward is not based upon just grace alone what God gives us but reward is based on labor what we do is what God gives us and listen to astounding verse for we are laborers together with God now here he's speaking about the ministry we are laborers together with God and the word labor is helper fellow worker companion in labor we are laborers together with God and ye are God's husband God's husbandry ye are God's Building and the word husbandry is land that has been tilled land that has been warped to be able to receive the seed second Corinthians chapter six verse 1. weeds in as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain workers together with him I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray before the Lord Heavenly Father we're so grateful that we can be gathered together here tonight Lord we counted an honor a privilege near Jesus that we could assemble and sing and worship and pray and raise our hands and lift our voices and just be a witness just to let hell know we've come here tonight to praise God as your word tells us for forsake not the assignment of yourselves together as a manner of some is that's not our manner our manner is to be able to come together with the people of God not on a gift but to give we're here to give back to you praise and love so we're asking that should help us tonight as we look into the word help me Jesus I can get out of the way speak through me I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated there is absolutely no higher honor that could be bestowed upon any man in this life then to be reckoned as being a labor with God in the same field doing the same things having the same plan the same designer the same architect for one goal one motive one purpose not a private Personal Agenda on your own but to be identified as a laborer with him every one of us not just preachers of course in the ministry but every one of us have something that we can do and the thing for us to do is go to him who brought us here and ask him Lord what can I do what should I do what can I be able to benefit the body and being able to minister to the body so as God's husbandry your part is going to be more as the cultivated field than the seed no matter how wonderful precious powerful that it is with life it cannot grow without being in the right type of soil and we all aware that there are many people that will hear the gospel they will hear the truth present date truth and because their soul is not the right type of ground it'll never bring forth and for fruition it'll never multiply never grow they'll go for a while then they go right back out into the world they'll go for a while get cold backslide or just accept a little occasion or something was God a little bit of religion that makes them feel pretty good but for the bride she's actually called the husbandry so she is the cultivated field by which God sows it now according to what Paul says you're in First Corinthians 3 10. according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder now some people might consider this to be bragging and that Paul was sure was speaking pretty highly of himself but I think myself this was necessary for Paul be able to lay out to the Corinthian Church what God had revealed to him now remember the Lord tells him about the city of Corinth that I have much people in this city and the Corinthian Church was a very carnal Church the first letter is filled with one rebuke after another because they're living all kinds of lives and it was a major port city basically a Greek it was a Melting Pot so like we'd say of New York so they had all types of classes and cultures of people who live there one of the big main worshipers places for astarti also Zeus a lot of the different gods and goddesses so there was anything and everything that you can imagine and the Christians that were there the church that was there was made up predominantly of Gentile Believers and when they came to the Lord they still was not quite washed now don't be too hard on them because remember they did not have the New Testament put together the way you and I do many of them did not even have the Old Testament well they could go back and read psalms and Proverbs and song with Solomon they certainly had had no types and no books so it's not like that they had all these volumes and libraries to know what to do so much of especially First Corinthians is Paul dealing with a bunch of issues that was in the Corinthian Church but Paul also knows that his ministry is going to go on for the ages that is to come so it's not just writing to them there so much of what we see in especially First Corinthians is issues that was in the church so there was sin of the church there was sexual sins it had all kinds of problems with the gifts had all kinds of problems with people who wanted to magnify the spiritual aspect of speaking in tongues prophecy things like that and yet for many of them they didn't even understand love so Paul had to go through the basic understanding of love now he's having to lay out to them about the order of the ministry in the body now as the wise master builder he's going to have an understanding about the ministry that probably some other ministers won't even have themselves now listen how he addresses this as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build us thereon but let every man take heed how he build us thereon now listen to this carefully every man that is a Christian Builder now this will include denominations this will include every man who claims he's a preacher and claims he's building on the foundation of Jesus Christ now many men are actually on the the substrate or the foundation of Christianity and they will let you know right up front they are not building on the gods of Islam they're not building on the gods of Hinduism or taoism or communism something they'll let you know right up front that they believe Jesus Christ died for the ungodly they believed that God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and they will say that's my Foundation now listen to me carefully so you don't misunderstand and Paul actually knew that there would be thousands times thousands of these types of Builders and they would profess that they were building on Jesus Christ so here Paul warns them all right now you men every one of you preachers you get this in your mind and take heed wow so if they were not actually building on part of the foundation that Paul laid Paul would just say I I ain't worried about you no way hey I'm you're false you're in the error you ain't going to bring no no detriment at all to the gospel but Paul knew they named The Name of Jesus and he knew that many of them because they would build on the foundation stone of Christianity so they're not building on an Old Testament principle alone they're not building on just a denominational Doctrine because even them say they believe in the cross and the power of the blood so here Paul is now warning then every preacher so listen what he says that every man to take heed now notice his warning let every man take heed how he build us thereupama so Paul never separated them the so-called gospel preachers that would build wood hay or stubble on the foundation of Christianity so what is the foundation then of all Christian churches they will say of course it's Christ Jesus it's God so loved the world it said he came to the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief and they'll say oh yes we believe in the blood we believe in the cross we believe in the transforming power to change the light so Paul did not recount that or deny that but Paul said all right I'll give you that credit so you say you are building on the foundation of Christ so let me go a little farther he said and give you a warning that you need to take heed what you are going to build on this Foundation of Christianity so now to settle this before any go any farther is it possible then that a preacher can build wood hay stubble on the foundation of Christianity and what he builds is totally error he will spend years of his life he will labor he will study he will pray he will do all sorts of things but yet the materials that he is using is incorrect but the foundation itself is true so what is the foundation brother the foundation is Christianity now we know the Old Testament they've done exactly the same thing so they took the law that God gave Moses and then they begin to add things to it so by the time Jesus got there a man could divorce his wife for burning his supper man Carol wouldn't have lasted about three or four months after we got married because bless her little darling heart she was cooking black and cajun before it was ever known about but I put up with them I'm gonna tell you one thing she's turned into an awesome cook so you can imagine how the law never said a man could put away his wife for that reason a man could put away his wife by the time Jesus got there if his wife raised her voice to his mother or even if he looked at a younger woman and wanted her then he could put away his wife for any cause or just about that bad in the message anymore so Moses never taught that but they took the foundation of the law and began to add their own ideas to it and build on that by the time Jesus got there it had eroded to the spot that we read on Sunday morning where the disciples themselves and most of them if you don't know it they were of the Pharisee group so the Pharisees taught that sin before you were ever born which is absolutely absurd that the blind man in John 9 and they asked Jesus the question who sinned him or his parents that he was born blind anybody in their right mind should know the answer to that how in the world could you sin before you were born but you see they had eroded so far from the truth by the time Jesus got here that's where it was but yet they would go back and say but we are Moses disciples so you see Christianity then after 2 000 years Christianity has eroded to the the spot even worse now than it was in the days of the Lord Jesus so Paul feels the necessity to warn every man that claims to be a god-called pastor a god-called teacher a god-called evangelist that he would build erroneous teaching ideology all kinds of things that are not gold they are not silver and they are not precious gems but they are wood hay and stubble now Paul preaches something about this that of course I had a really hard time with whenever I was a Pentecostal because I read the book of Corinthians a lot and whenever I would run across this being a Pentecostal I couldn't understand him so I never preached it one time when I was a Pentecostal preacher and that was that Paul said that if a man will build on this Foundation of Christianity would hay or stubble that the fire one day will try every preacher's work and if his work does not stand the fire then his work will be burned up but he himself will be saved now you understand that there's a difference in being saved and being called to be a preacher I mean he knows that so being called to be a preacher has nothing to do with being saved a matter of fact it's two separate things so a person can be saved and yet lose every one of their works well you said where's Bible for that uh man in the name and the Bible by the name of Mr Lott he lost everything that he had lost everything by fire yet he himself was saved is that right so Paul feels the need to warn them not just the preachers in this day but every other preacher that would come notice again in first Timothy 4 15 he said meditate upon these things and give thyself holy to them that thou profiting may appear to all notice verse 16 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear them now here Paul is writing to his son in the gospel but yet he felt the need to warn Timothy to take heed to be Careful What doctrine that he preaches what he stands for and what he promotes now Paul knows he's not going to live much longer by the time this is written he's very close now to being offered so he wants to give Timothy Titus and these other Brethren a good sound Doctrine and good understanding and also a warning because he believed that God would take him and these men would carry on with that same word so he wants to instill in them not just correct water baptism but he wants to instill in them the structure of the church and the structure of how the church would continue on because they'd come to the spot now to where they realized Jesus was not going to come in their generation he they realized that Jesus was going to tarry for many many years I'm glad they realized that I'm glad they moved beyond the basic understanding of what most of them had when the apostolic church first started because if they hadn't we'll only have the basic principles of how to know how to get saved but I'm glad they had an understanding you got to have a church with substantial Foundation doctrines I know a lot of folks don't like Doctrine but you got to have Doctrine to be a church so he wanted to encourage them to be able to understand this now notice he said take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine now not just salvation but the doctrine so Doctrine is important and continue in them the doctrine and in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee notice First Corinthians 4 13. he says being defamed we Intrigue we are made as the filth of the world and are the off scouring of all things unto this day I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you now here Paul again is writing to those in the city of Corinth but also those that are ministering because he has begotten them to Christ through the gospel he was a father not Peter in the sense of a pope but a father which had begotten them by the word now they know every preacher does not have the ability to beget children to God somebody's going to look at me funny every preacher does not have the ability to produce new births you see a man who's not born again himself cannot lead you to eternal life so many preachers are not actually bringing people to birth they're bringing them to a confession I accept Jesus as my savior and they will present many people at that day that were saved people but not truly born again oh you're saying no wait a minute brother Donnie I've got to have scripture for that well I knew you would that's why I have one prepared for you all right not these things to shame you but it's my beloved Sons I warn you for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ so ten thousand rabbis ten thousand teachers ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers so you might have ten thousand preachers that could preach Doctrine and they could go through and boy quote you Greek words and Aramaic Enlighten and Hebrew and all that sort of thing and yet not be able to produce one birth in a six-week Revival now you see this is why it's so important friends that men that are called of God not only to preach but they are also called to produce new births you see this is why some preachers do not have the ability to make their Ministry grow on its own so what did they do proselyte others at the end of the service here Wednesday night one of the sisters come up for prayer and she told me brother Donnie What You Preach here tonight just happened in my father's Church her father's church is in another country I know the brother well great Labor in the gospel great brother stood for the Lord for years and years but a younger man going around in that particular country and and prosely lighting people from this church and that church and that church and pulling on people to follow him now you see a true man that is born of the spirit of God does not have to depend on other preachers to beget sheep for him he has the ability to reproduce his own but some preachers don't have that ability now this is the Bible which just to believe the Bible right right oh okay I just want to make sure you all right I was thinking y'all did so we could have ten thousand instructors but how many out of that ten thousand would actually have the power of begettable or they could preach the word to the soul because you see them Men actually have the ministry of reconciliation some men only have a Ministry of Salvation they have a Ministry of some sort of Doctrine or you know they're just like the kind old priest always so loving is so gentle he's so nice or he talks so sweet to you oh it's just such a sweet sweet brother well that's well in good I like sweetness on certain things but you know what I'd rather have a man that could be my father in the word and produce a new birth than of God that's just about like a cinnamon roll I mean he just oozing with goodness and sweetness and I mean just you know everybody gets around just ooey gooey whenever he gets done and cannot produce one son or daughter of God what good is sweetness with just a bunch of words now you know y'all do believe what Paul said right I know you did now know this so he said for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers for in Christ Jesus notice now Paul said for in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel so Paul was in Christ and Christ was using Paul's gift to pass his seed word to quickened germs of life now a man who's not in Christ a man that just studies to be a preacher and he might be a good talker there's no question about some of these guys at podcasts and some of these guys that will write books and you pick them up in the Bible bookstore many good thoughts and many good ideas they're not all crazy and all weird and all that many of them have some good Bible principles but can they produce births can they produce births oh you might get a good something from them every now and then and they may have a good point here and a good point there but for myself if I was a person looking to set under a minister I would want to see if the man was produced first and had through the years if he ain't I ain't gonna sit there alone myself now notice for in Christ Jesus I have begotten through the gospel so then apparently every preacher does not have the ability to beget children to God by Spoken Word birth now there might be men that can set up and quote the Bible and quote the message oh my they quote that Prophet they just lay it down there and yet you follow them and you watch them and you wonder what are they doing what what is their agenda what are they doing for the body what are they doing to the body is the body coming to that place of fruition what's really happening with him now Paul wanted to warn because he knew there was an intellectual side to the gospel that was going to come there after it was already there really wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me I mean she wants to do that today so Paul now himself now keep this in mind Paul himself could be led and instructed now you don't want to follow any man I don't care who he is any man who can not be led and be instructed to by those that are his Elders he's not a god-called leader a leader that cannot be led is not a real leader from God's presence he's more like a dictator Amen brother Donnie Amen brother amen amen I'm gonna have to make that tape after church tonight Brothers maybe I'm doing four-part Harmony on it now notice that notice there is three years after Paul's conversion whenever the Lord met him on the road to Damascus and we know the story about Paul so Paul is now he wants to visit the brothers and the churches in Jerusalem now I said in your last swings and I don't want to say it again that most of us message folks are so scared to death of organization we are terrified of organism now once you listen how the early church operated in the body now you see the problem that we have is actually coming through thousands of years of organization some of you coming out of it maybe some of your families coming out of it then whenever you see anything that looks like an order to a certain move of God it scares people to death but the reason of that is because we're standing here trying to read the Bible back through what we've experienced ourselves now keep in mind whenever we read these places tonight in the scripture that these people had never had an organization before like as far as an organization of the Gospel now they come out of Pharisees Sadducees have seen herodians and all of that but it was nothing quite like this so whenever they would see this they had no problem with it because they were not pulling it through the fear of organized religion so Paul is going up to Jerusalem now he is not known hardly at all you know Paul felt like now I know this may seem really strange To You Paul knew that God had a special word for him because he had told ananias to tell him and by now the Lord had already been dealing with Paul three years since he's been converted now what was he doing during that time of three years well he was preaching in Damascus but it was quite a way from Jerusalem so they didn't have phone texts email things like that so it might have been quite slow for news to come from Damascus over but we also know according to what Paul told us later that he had went down to Arabia during this same time frame so three years have passed since Paul got converted he still identified actually under the old name of Saul but he was not like a lot of us in the message he was not like a lot of people that have been down Through the Ages and that Paul did not feel like he did not need the rest of the brothers now you see it's never the spirit of God that will separate us away from the rest of the body it's never the spirit of God that will convince you you can set home and be just as good a Christian as you can by coming to church well praise the Lord God's Prophet tells you better than that and so does your Bible so Paul brother Jack he wanted to go up to Jerusalem now remember by this time he had never met Peter he had never met James he had never met any of the rest of the brothers yet he's in the ministry he's preaching he's doing what God's called him to do but he felt like that he needed to be recognized with the rest of the body now this is Apostolic teaching this is the master builder himself before he comes into the architect position of the body now how could a man be used as an architect for God if he only knows about the church in Damascus how can this man do this then unless he has favor with the rest of the body all mine so he wants to associate himself with the disciples he wants to be able to know Peter and to be able to meet some of the other brothers and he also wants to be able to meet the rest of the body you see communion with the Saints is as healthy as it is right for the individuals that understand him so here was Paul and he hadn't hardly had any communion at all with anybody only just a few people and he preached there in Damascus and no doubt brought some to the Lord but yet Paul wanted to reach out he was not of the mindset I don't need no Mighty blessed God I'll take my own Ministry I don't need a home Church to work out other I don't need no preacher friends I don't need nobody no that's not the way the apostolic Doctrine was established now you see this is also established from the mind of the great designer himself notice this in Luke chapter 22 verse 32 the Lord Jesus said I have prayed for thee speaking to Peter that thy faith failed thee not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren so the Lord Jesus is showing that in this body that he will establish upon the Earth that no man is going to be an island so Peter is going to backslide Peter is going to deny the denies the Lord but Jesus said I prayed for you that your faithful and fail and when you get reconciled back yourself I want you to strengthen the brother so don't stay home and don't stay away from everybody sure you're going to be ashamed you imagine how shame Peter was when he had to come back to the brothers and ask him where was you where was you well well I I cussed and I I denied I even him can you imagine some of you are ashamed of the things you've done can you imagine what this man had to tell his brothers and said Brothers I'm sorry please forgive me for what I've done but yet the Lord Jesus knew this would happen but he wanted people Peter to understand like us that with the body this is what God makes it for also this is with the teaching of the Apostles and Colossians 3 16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord now this is again of course the great master builder emphasizing the importance of us getting together not only in church but when we can have times of fellowship and whatever more that we would admonish one another and we would talk Psalms and we would sing songs and we would be able to be a benefit and the church said Hebrews 10 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is and brother Ram quotes this in the seals and says as the manner of unbelievers is but exhorting one another so you see you don't just come to church for the preacher to do all the talking but you're to have fellowship with one another and mingle among the saints and and talk how you doing brother well I've been going through a Bernal brother I'm going to be praying for you pray for me and I'll pray for you that's the way God intended for the body to be just like your body does now notice he said but exhort in one another so much more as you see the day approaching which don't do it less and less the farther you get into the tapes and then you realize you don't need to go to church that's anti-scripture and anti-message James 5 16 confess your faults one to another you're going to have a hard time doing if you don't go to church ain't you because you don't see nobody and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail us much now notice him Paul gets the longing and hungering as it was to meet the brothers and sin now listen to this scenario very carefully Acts chapter 9 verse 26 and when Saul was come to Jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples now here's a desire and this is a prophet of God now nobody in Jerusalem will ever compare to his Revelation nobody in Jerusalem will ever bring as many to the cause of Christ as he would he is the very first missionary in the New Testament no one ever outdid what he did oh I had the facts of it several years ago how many miles that he walked how many miles they calculated that he spent in the ship it was absolutely incredible to read what the man went through and yet this man as I would say had the premier position in the first church age yet he himself did not feel like that his position alone would qualify him to stay by himself and say I don't need nobody else I hope you're going to hear me tonight so he is saved to join himself to the disciples and they were so glad and they all they just opened their doors to Saul and said dear brother we heard that you are the master builder and praise God come in our homes no that wasn't a reception he got at all so I wonder what some of us would have done and we would have got this reception but they were all afraid of him and believe not that he was a disciple so what would you do Shake the Dust off your shoes bless God let the judge the judge fall on this place no you see Paul knew the necessity of being with the body even though it's going to hurt him now watch in Galatians 1 18 after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him for 15 days now can you imagine what a time that must have been Peter and Paul together just hanging out as we'd say talking fellowshipping well brother Peter how do you see this how you preach election how do you preach the new birth what what tell me tell me about Jesus tell me tell me all these stories tell me I want to know now here is the greatest man in the New Testament next to the Lord Jesus but he was still teachable you see when we get to a spot that we can't no longer receive teaching we're actually backslid I don't care what you're doing notice this man chapter 9 again of Acts verse 27. but Barnabas took him I brought him to the apostles now you see the Lord Jesus had already told us that would be an act of the paracletos an advocate that would come and stand between us and our father Barnabas had been so baptized by the Holy Ghost that he's acting out the advocacy of the spirit of God now Barnabas had already heard about Paul remember his place of where he lived was closer than than Jerusalem so he had heard about Paul now here is the church age messenger that needs to be introduced to average church people of Word of Life will say and he's going to be introduced to the church to a man who has a much lesser inferior call understanding Revelation and so on than he does now can you imagine men of Pride and Prestige they would have never humbled their self to be introduced to Peter or James or the rest of the church in Jerusalem by a man which was their inferior I'm sorry y'all didn't know this is in your Bible now watch what Barnabas does so Barnabas is acting the part of the paracletus or The Advocate so nobody you just read it nobody believed that Saul was a Believer much less a preacher much less a prophet a master builder are you kidding me so barnaba steps in with his brother now keep this in mind precious friends sometimes we might have to be a paracletus for someone who's fell someone who's backslid someone has stepped out of God's care and mercy so will you be there for them if they need somebody to stand between them oh y'all ain't going to okay I'm making an older car right now we'll start right here everybody from here over come up here and repent you see it was very risky for Barnabas but he feels this man it's true don't notice and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way now it's not Paul telling it but it's Barnabas had either talked to Paul or Barnabas had heard it as he come back from where he lived coming back through Damascus to Jerusalem so here he is telling Paul's testimony second-handed well you can imagine some of the preachers in the message can't you that say you bunch of rebels you bunch of infidels and unbelievers if you don't believe in me suit yourself I don't need you anyway I've got my Ministry I've got my church I've got this and go on do whatever you want to do that's a man that doesn't understand very much in the scripture does he Paul to just walk out and say okay Lord I tried but you know you know witness every one of them thought I was a phony every one of them thought that I never even believed you and more than likely by this time three years on had already done more than any of them had so here Barnabas stands in as the media so through Barnabas Saul is received as a brother his past his past no doubt that heard of him and that heard that he went to Damascus and he had papers and he had had some of the saints of God thrown in jail so his past didn't speak very good of him but through Barnabas oh praise the Lord I hope you get it through Barnabas Barnabas was able to convince the people Paul was a believer praise be to God notice what one man's testimony about another bearing Truth Now can just be able to dissolve that distrust and it's not when Barnabas began to tell this notice in verse 28 and he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem so here the paracletos Barnabas just stood there and they said well praise God we know brother Barnes he's a good brother he loves the Lord and if Barnabas has got confidence in him praise God my what a thing that would be as Believers would it not to be able to intercede in such a way and all the Believers there probably Peter James all the rest of them included and yet when Barnabas stands up for him it's just like it rolls the distrust away notice in verse 29 and he spoke In The Name Of The Lord of the Lord Jesus but they weren't about to slay him bless his heart he was a troublemaking guy wasn't he notice in verse 30. which when the Brethren knew now you're the brothers they meet him they talk to him he spends two weeks in a day with Peter and then he still kind of hangs her out Jerusalem boy he's out and about and then he's out there preaching goes to debate with the Christian and her out to kill this guy so the brothers now the rest of the Apostles and the disciples in Jerusalem when the Brethren knew they notice now they they brought him down to caesarea they who the brothers now if we would read this if we're now careful reading it coming through all the denominational nonsense we would go back and say Lord have mercy wow that ain't right ain't right for them to try to work with the local Church of Christ Lord have mercy where'd they get that book of Acts but you see what Satan done he wants to take God's truth and so pollute it that we're scared to death of the Bible this is your Bible this is the way they operated this is the way they functioned in the apostolic age and I ask you are we restored to this oh you think it's just acts 2 38. um notice so when the Brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus you mean the preachers spoke to Paul and said Paul you don't need to stay here you need to leave oh well your brothers think I need to go you need to go to Tarsus testing what I thought this microphone was working maybe it ain't this is your Bible don't you see why Satan wanted to make a denominational system and make it appear like the truth so it would be such a scarecrow before people that even bribe people hear this and they look at you like you're from Mars or you can imagine some of our message preachers get you now brother I'll tell you one thing I don't think I'll do that glory to God I'll tell you one thing I'm going to do it I don't care what happened I'll tell you one but if I have to do that there you go why so scared of organization we're scared of organism right with it all my Acts chapter 11 verse 28. well I hope you do time I get done with you tonight and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be a great dirse which was a famine throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief under the Brethren which dwelt and Judea which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and salt now notice the order that they had so they didn't just say here you take it and you take it in they believe that God had an order in his church and they also knew there was false prophets out there and they knew that those folks that would be following what the Bible term was filthy Luther which is the love for money generally filthy Lucas associated with filthy Lucifer aha now notice that they set up then in the church Elders deacons Bishops overseers which is exact same word when you look at it in the Greek one defines his age the other defines his office and this is the way the original Church set up to eliminate a lot of the error notice now in Chapter 14 verse 21 and when they had preached the gospel to that sin it had taught many they returned again to lystra and to Iconium unto Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the face that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God and when they had ordained them elders in every Church pastors so who did this the apostles now I'm looking for these words as I'm going through the book of Acts and I'm looking at every scripture where it used the word church and I'm looking up every scripture where it uses the word churches and I'm looking at every scripture where it uses the word Elder and elders and overseers and all these words and I'm looking for those magic words that we use so much in the message I felt led now apparently my software don't work very good because in all my looking I ain't found where Paul told any of these guys to do this if you feel led I'm telling you Jesus you're going to get me killed one of these days you know what they consider this as being the word of God you don't have to feel led to obey the word you obey it because it's God's word praise the Lord some of you that wait to worship when you feel it you're missing a great time with God you're commissioned by God to worship him whether you feel it or not you're commanded by God to raise your hands it has nothing to do with fear clap your hands all you people that's a command in God's Bible just like water baptism any other command I'm on a sing I'm gonna clap my hands I'm going to raise my hands brother Jack whether I feed it or whether I don't why because the word tells me to do it now I want you to notice the apostolic order that it's not preachers now that are going out and establishing their own things and doing their own thing themselves well I don't need what James said I don't need what Peter said I don't care what they say glory to God the Lord called me to do this I'm doing it I don't need nobody's approval oh and there you're wrong you see if the elders didn't approve of a preacher in the New Testament he didn't get in their churches hmm and what they had ordained them elders and every church I want you to notice now the sequence of God the preacher didn't come first so a New Testament Church was never established just so a preacher could have a place to preach the church was established and then the pastor the Elder come into the church read your Bible all right when they had ordained them Elders in every church I said doesn't say that they ordained the church or then they ordained well the the preacher went out first and then he now remember what's going on in this is the missionary stage of the Apostolic Church so Paul is going out Peter is going out other brothers are going out so these men are starters they are Apostles so they would go out and they might stay there a year two three like Paul did in some places but he's not a pastor so he's not going to stay so Paul wouldn't just go there and establish the church and then just let whoever come here well I feel that I feel that as I said you won't find that but they would be very careful of who that they placed in that church so it wasn't like well I feel led to go here and I feel led to go there that's not the scripture I stand to be corrected if I'm wrong notice them what they did and they had ordained them Elders in every church and prayed with fasting and they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed acts 15 1. and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved now you see this is one of the reasons they set this Apostolic order up because there's always going to be these guys right here I found it amazing for years the work in China was hidden hardly nobody knew any contact information and that was done for a reason Satan is never the original missionary but ever were Gods ever sent a missionary the Devils come in right behind them and I've seen it happen in China and seen it in other that was one of the first works that we was ever involved in as far as one of the early foundation groundworks and you try your best to keep it out of there as long as possible so you can get them rooted and grounded and settled in the truth because you know it's inevitable these guys will come in and sure enough here they come right into China somebody got a phone number let's listen to every testimony I'd give or every testimony about the physical together whoever would make a trip there until finally they call somebody and got a phone number and here they go they go and make a trip to China One missionary of this and another missionary of that and to go in there what do they do try to pull the people off to follow in their ideology which they were successful and Paul knew that this would happen so Paul said this is the way God now is there anybody here in the right mind that would want to dispute and say that's not right Paul did it wrong oh my goodness well I'll tell you one thing you're braver than I am or Dumber I believe we're talking about the master builder here I don't care what you feel I don't care what I feel it has to come back to this or it's the devil well judge All Things by the word now notice when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension I mean they scorched these guys out had no small dissension at disputation and with them they disputed with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem under the apostles and the elders about this question you've got to be kidding me so here is a dispute in the church and they want to go back up to Jerusalem to talk to Peter and the apostles you can imagine some of ours wanting to do that well brother let's sit down with this Brethren no no I tell what well different Spirit on us I'm afraid than what was in the book of Acts oh my goodness and being brought on their leg by the church they pastor finisi and Samaria declaring the conversion of the Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto all the brethren notice in verse 4 when they were come to Jerusalem they were received of the church and of the Apostles and elders Oh you mean that's Apostolic um you see any man that's preaching anything that cannot be received by the elders in this message men that are true there's something wrong with that dude well praise the Lord I got healed I don't care if you walked on the benches I don't care if you walk on water if they're off the word you better leave them alone so they declared all things that God had done with him but the rose up certain sect to the Pharisees which believed here's our problem we've got a certain set of the Badness Among Us that it believes a message and we've got a certain sect of Pentecostals that believe and believe it or not we've got a certain sect to church Christ that believe and they've got a certain sect of nazares that believe and yes we even have some Catholics that are a certain sects of Catholicism and they believe and they are our worst troublemakers you see it for real believer believes he will no longer be a believer Pharisee he will be a believer ex Pharisee amen you might have been a Church of Christ but if you ever become a Believer praise God you'll know you made a Church of Christ no more you clap your hands you shout you love music and you say glory to God I used to win like music in the church but I sure do like it now Hallelujah it makes me feel like dancing a little bit why because you are no longer a Church of Christ which believes you are an ax Church of Christ now I want you to notice how they handle these disputes verse 6 on the apostles and elders apostles and pastors come together to consider this matter well women ain't that lack of denomination no the denomination was like the original friend don't be scared don't be scared of the rich I'm reading to you the original tonight but you see what's trying to hinder you is that old scarecrow I thought scare scare scarecrows well y'all been scared right I don't know what scare coach Karen Eagle but I guess the Scarecrow can scare an eagle if an eagle's so scared that he's scared to scarecrow because he's getting his eyes off of what he's fearful of instead of getting his eyes on the woods and wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute this is God's Bible God's Bible cannot lie this is the way the original Church operate and this is the way the master builder told that preachers as I follow the word you all follow me and this is what brother Graham said that he followed Paul verse 22 then pleased it pleased the apostles and the elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch but Paul and Barnabas surnamed Judah surname barcibus and Silas Chief men among the brethren enters by them to this manner the apostles and elders and Brethren send greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and Sicily for as much as we have heard now this is the way they resolve these makes you know Doctrine or republican you can't hardly get a preacher to even sit down with you that differs with you in this message and if you differ with them they'll turn treat you like I don't know what and some of them will never speak to you again I was check out her chest because we know the Seven Seals and what good has that done us if it hasn't brought back the original Apostolic Faith I thought this is what brother Rams said God called him to do to bring us back to the original Apostolic face oh my goodness for as much as we have heard the certain one out from us went out from us John wrote about him later and said they went out from us because there wasn't of us and here's what they're saying these guys was never filled with the Holy Ghost these guys could not preach you'd have to have circumcision if they were really born again these were the type of teachers that could teach you all about the law and could not produce the First new birth in one soul oh praise the Lord now notice what they've done they troubled you with words so subverting your souls saying You must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such what commandment wow you mean these Apostles had that Authority with God it seemed good unto us being a symbol with one Accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul and then they thought it'd be a good time to just throw this next verse in men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and remember it wasn't that long ago that some of these same guys right here was afraid of Saul but her brother stood in between him and brought them to an understanding of his position we have sinned we have sinned therefore Judas inside us who shall also tell you the same things by mouth boy they wanted this to be resolved didn't they acts 15 40. and Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God you mean Paul chose a man to travel with him I should be him try his traveling partner by recommendation of the church oh don't you see why Satan wants to divide us don't you see why Satan wants to message churches this one won't speak to that one that one won't speak to that and I reckon we figure when the Rapture takes place we're all just going to be changed we're all going to be lovey-dovey everybody's just going to have so much love and y'all figured that that's going to be a street Down Heaven for the seven Thunder people and there's going to be another Avenue this and you'll be called Perugia Avenue and this and over here will be called tape only Avenue and listen over here will be called two souls and this one may call someone else there won't be no such things there and there won't be nobody there but them kind of attitudes either if we ever get there we got to get rid of them attitudes right here oh my God so you Paul took a man with him now wait a minute this is the messenger the age this is the master builder but he was still in tune with the body you see anything that pulls you that pulls me that pulls any other minister any other Church seclusively away from the body remember call it what you will it is the devil it breaks God's word oh my and he went through Syria and Sicilia confirming the churches acts 16 4. and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees oh decrees for to keep that word ordained of the Apostles and the elders which are at Jerusalem now look what Satan has done he's tried to mimic this with organization and scare the liver out of people for all these years so it produces that Independence something I don't need nobody I don't care if anybody approves of what I do or not and look at the spirit that goes with that sort of thing I don't need nobody blessed God I've gotten my Ministry my church and my family and my gift and you ain't going nowhere without all the rest of us either if you're going that is notice Paul traveling again Acts 2017. and from melitus he sent to Ephesus oh my goodness and call the Elders of the church so you mean Paul wouldn't even pass through an area just on his way through without paying the courtesy to the pastors wow there'll be a bride around the world that'll be restored to this just as soon as there's a God in heaven now you see verse 28 which I'm fixing to read to you proves that these were ministers and not just older brothers Paul now speaks to these Elders pastors take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flaws over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God who he has purchased with his own blood acts 21 18. and the day following Paul went with us unto James and all the elders were present and when he had saluted them oh my goodness you mean Paul the prophet the master builder goes into men that are inferior to him and treats them as if they are the Great Men of the hour that's a real Holy Ghost Field preacher right there when he had saluted them he declared particularly what God think among the Gentiles by his ministry wow First Timothy 5 17 let the elders that rule again same Greek word age his Elder position is overseer Bishop prick or Bishop let the at rule so we're not talking about old man in the church now over to superintend preside over to be a protector or a guardian let the elders that rule well be counted Worthy oh my goodness of double honor but who gets double honor in this message a lot of times gifted men get more honorable than the man who labors and Doctrine in the word preachers that will step down out of their pulpit and start playing tapes and never preach another sermon they get more honor than the men of God who labor in the word which is a crying shame I'll tell you one thing a preacher that listened to some headquarters somewhere named talking out of preaching he ought to sat down boy I figured if God calls you how can any man shut you up labor in the word and Doctrine look at this word labor told be wearied tired exhausted was toil or burdens or grief to labor with worrisome effort to labor was worrisome effort now the Bible your Bible says men who do this are supposed to be worthy of double honor and the church said now this is Apostolic Doctrine notice and then Paul gives the parallel or the example Verse 18 for the scripture says Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadth out the corn so I'll let you know what I am just to know Ox with a thing over the top mind X and I'm plowing you all out and you're the core the ma the ox have tried us out the corn and the labor is worthy of his reward against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses and yet people in this message receive lives and gossip against all kinds of preachers they don't require two witnesses or three self will be put on Facebook on Tick Tock and rock rock and Brock block and whatever more and they'll spread it around us lies against men of God and it ain't even the truth and we feel like we're flying away into the Rapture somewhere not if we break this word we ain't sins God demands obedience to his word oh my God now if you would come to a little different change can I have a few more minutes Titus Chapter 1 Verse five now the Titus was one of Paul's sons in the gospel but here in this particular occasion Paul and Titus have been to the island called Crete now Crete is part of the Mediterranean area but it's it's in the Aegean Sea a little island about 40 miles wide 120 130 miles long had approximately a hundred cities on that little island very great vacation spot even to this day so Paul goes in there now he's a ship whenever his Shipwrecked there and he had to go in but apparently Paul went back again and him and Titus had made another trip because the other time he's on his way to Rome so he didn't have time to study but Paul apparently preached from one end of that Island to the other and there was converts from City to City now here Paul and Titus are back again but something comes up and Paul doesn't tell us what it was so apparently we didn't need to know what it was so something pulls Paul away from the island of Crete and Paul leaves Titus there on the island now listen what he leaves him for this cause left eye thee in Crete that thou should have set in order the things that are wanting now we know no doubt that he told him this verbally but there must have been a question that someone would question whether or not Titus had this type of authority he was not an apostle but he was a preacher and apparently a man of Great Character that Paul would trust him with this so Paul is delegating to him an Apostolic authority to stand in this position under the circumstance now listen what Paul tells him to do so he says he reminds him I left you there that you might set the things in order that are wanting so Paul just went and preached and maybe Titus and we don't know who else and they had established churches people got saved say this heard from the south and we're to the North or vice versa and people was getting saved getting healed get delivered and they had churches but they didn't have no pastors yet so as I said look in the apostolic order and it's not that a church is built because a preacher wants a place to preach uh it's not because an associate in a church thinks he ain't being used enough so he wants to go start his own church that's not the Bible come on now read your Bible and show me and I apologize study your Bible close and you'll find out the way churches were established in the apostolic order men went in and preached and gave birth and then what God would have to send in pastor but it was not started around the preacher first it was started with the church and then they had to come in and ordain elders this is your Bible now now what's the word that Paul used said in order this is actually a medical term which means to set a broken bone or straighten a crooked limb now the church has heard the truth they've got saved no doubt a lot of them got the Holy Ghost and they're loving God and in many Greeks uh also this is just absolutely overwhelming to them but Paul told Titus because of this urgent situation I had to leave and things are not in order oh I didn't Paul tell him well just let him do whatever the thing it was just that some man that feels led to do it just just let it let it happen I mean we believe in the Providence of God so let God take care of it Paul felt it his responsibility to let there be Elders placed in them Church why they'd be like India was if you listen to taking signs of Jesus 1962 and the prophet said most of those converts that he led to the Lord all went back to the Sikhs and the chains and the Buddhists why said because there was no Minister that I could send them to oh he said I wish that I had young men that would be able to go there notice brother Branham ringing the apostolic Doctrine oh I wish I had young men that I could send to South Africa young men I could sin here and there and there that's the way the church growed not by being divided and split the church growed out of itself under the administration of the present Ministry that God put it in not somebody trying to establish themselves that's not the way it was in the Bible so there was a broken bone or a crooked lamb well what was the broken bone no pastors what was the Crooked Liam they couldn't hardly walk right no pastors so Paul tells Titus look Titus I've left she was there that you can set the things in order I want you to get in there and set that bone boy I'll tell you one thing that hurts don't it it ain't no wonder that a preacher has to break people sometimes and boy people get mad at him man you ever go to a doctor and you're in pain that doctor has to gouge on you a little bit and poke on you and do you say come on man I'm hurting already don't hurt my words well I look at if he's got to hurt me worse to make me better lay it on me Doc that's why I look at her preacher if you got to burn me up one side and down the other let me have it don't let me go to hell oh my God so the church is a body and sometimes the preacher has to be like a spiritual physician so Titus was not to select the Bishops himself I only want you to notice the word that Paul uses here so he is not a pope he is not an Archbishop oh and I'll pick him I pick him I picked that one I picked that one but you see the body themselves the word that Paul uses is not the Titus is going to pick them but Titus is going to ordain them hahaha the church is already voting the church is already looking and young men raising up or whatever more from among them but Paul wants to give Titus the requirements of a pastor and he wants to send him there just to make sure their choice is scriptural praise God now let's read this verse again for this concept of the increte that thou should have said in order the things that are wanting and ordained elders in every city as I had appointed thee so he's not there picking him any meaning but he's ordaining ordaining my brother I ordain you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ chosen by this flock chosen by them I stand Here representing Paul wow I stand here with an Apostolic Authority I hope you understand this it was only temporary allotted to Titus to do this under the circumstances so Paul now instructing him now he's going to give verse 6 and he's going to him now look Thomas when you get there just in case the church may have voted for a man that does not meet the standard of God I want to remind you what you told Timothy some of these same words if any man be blameless look at the meaning of the word unreprovable that cannot be called into account unaccused this is the kind of man you want to be your pastors he said a man that's blameless now blame us isn't just necessarily that he don't run around with women all right don't drink or he's not you know he loves money he's not a gambler it could be all kinds of things this man must be now he doesn't say perfect but he's saying blameless which means that they cannot say this man is a backstabber and have proof of it this man is two-faced and have proof of it this man is this or that or the other Paul said nope don't put that kind of man in as your pastor a lot of preachers would be about to be plumbers wouldn't he not converter guys because there's enough rotten stuff in there who wouldn't want to send them in that direction anyway if anybody he blameless the husband of one wife not been married two times three times four times five times oh I know I'm old-fashioned but I still believe this is God's word my God is not so hard up and he can have double-minded double married preacher double-minded too double married preachers in the pulpit oh I'll catch you for that but that's still God's Bible that's okay I'm willing to Bear reproach for the word the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of Riot or unruly so you see the character is twofold both positive and negative he must have this he must have this he must have this but he can't have this and he can't have that and he can't have that for a bishop must be blameless again he uses the word again blameless as the steward of God not self-willed self-pleasing self-willed arrogant let's stand [Music] now this is not a suggestion notice the word a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God not self-willed not soon angry not given to wine no Striker this ain't walking in front of a picket line now and carrying you know those Union signs but it's a man who loses his temper real quick and raises his voice you see a man might have a great family he might even have a great call in his life but a short-tempered man God will never put one to be his pastor Apostolic times are coming oh yes they are Apostolic times are coming the bride's going up in the fire we've been restored by Malachi 4 he is coming knocking on the door oh Apostolic times are coming Lord bring them down again that was an ox Lord notice this word Striker Bruiser ready for a blow whoa pugnacious a pugnacious contentious quarrelsome person verse 8 but a lover of hospitality a lover of Good Men you are not only known by your friends but you're known by your enemies but I'll tell you one thing if the saints of God don't want to be around you or me the saints of God don't want to be Fellowship I'd question myself if I should I worry I don't need nobody oh you just now forfeited your right to preach you see it was you first then me it wasn't me who come here years and years ago and this church is built around me I came to you all the Lord sent me here to you all praise the Lord it may not easier for me if the Lord would have sent you all to me in Kentucky that's where I'm from and the Lord but it sent you all but he didn't do that did he he sent me to you he tore up my family he busted up my family my friends my girls had to leave their their friends they had to leave their family for who for you so you see this is not built around me a church that is built around the man is built on the wrong Foundation do you understand a church that is built that way is just as anti-scriptural as a denomination because a denomination is a man-made system and you'll agree with Bill I'd never joined that but some of you will go to a man-made Church because it don't meet the requirements of God's scriptures and what is it just as much man-made is any denomination ever breathed we don't want a church man-made if if if his church was started by men we're in a herd of trouble friends if this message was founded by a man we're in a mess of trouble but if it was founded by God using a man which we believe it is we've got the right way to heaven oh praise the Lord we'll give the Lord a hand would you let me just read this for you for the next time Lord willing First Corinthians 3 11 4. other Foundation can no man lay that is laid which is Christ Jesus now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hey stubble you see the fire only purifies the gold and the silver and the stones but it destroys the wood they the stubble Paul uses six different types of material three are durable lasting three are temporal they are substance that can be destroyed by fire now let's move it beyond the preachers tonight let's bring it to you laity when your life is finished and spent you want what you've done to count don't you oh you'll never be maybe a preacher you may travel the world and be a missionary and this and that but what God's give you to do don't you want to be faithful whether it's a housewife a father a mother whatever it is you want your Works to be able to stand but your Paul is basically looking at the preachers and he sets forth two types of preachers some that are sound and solid on the apostolic Foundation others that are unsound and what they're going to do and what they're going to build upon will seem great in the eyes of some until the fire tested and the fire will annihilate it you imagine God said except the Lord build the house they that labor labor in vain Oma that's about it Hallelujah how many wants your works for the Lord Jesus be lasting you don't want it to be temporary passing ordinary not substantial that'll last oh my two friends it's going to be awful much sin some preachers stand before him that hey Lord I prayed I labored I sweated I set up past midnight many a night and I'd done this and that and the other and Jesus will look around and say where's your works well Lord I I was an evangelist I I was a I was a theologian I was a pastor i i pastored a church for 40 years and where is that I see you standing there empty-handed well Lord what happened you built it upon stubble on word on Hay Oma heavenly father is we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth from once our bodies were taken and one day they will return again may we look tonight in this sober solemn atmosphere that we feel in this place whether we're preachers or laity or singers or whatever our vocation is in life Lord may we purpose tonight greater than ever before we want to be found standing on your word the fire is going to come Lord the fire is going to come and it's going to try my work when I stand there mama won't be there with me Daddy won't my brother Harry stood with me stood together with me for years and years but he won't be able to stand there with me my wife stood with me and Stood Beside Me my family my friends Minister Brothers here in the church church members but Lord will not stand that day and the fire comes it'll be me and my works if I built on the foundation and I took wood hay stubble I left out a little word here a little Apostolic teaching there a little Apostolic Doctrine there and I didn't think it really mattered that much because I felt led to do this or that or the other Lord God I pray that you should help me help us to realize we cannot go by what we feel we must go by your word feelings will lie to us they will deceive us but your word will forever stand begin with me tonight would you Lord Jesus see if I've got any wood in my building accessories see if I've got any stubble any hay any combustible substance that I would be laying upon the apostolic Foundation May every man woman boy and girl look at their own Hearts tonight the works well I've done this for the Lord I've done that for the Lord but is it gold silver precious stones now we know wood hay and stubble us we can pick it up land on the side of the road hardly no value to it at all fleeting passing gold most of us probably don't even own a piece of it silver it's played it it's not even probably real precious stones so Lord that's the way it is with the gospel and Paul chose these to show how hard they are to get and how precious they are when you get them Lord God I pray you'll help us although we know many times you use these even in the parables you talked about a pearl about the pearl of great price and you talked about the gates of that City are made out of pearls and then we look at a pearl and we know that a pearl is made when this little animal down in the water gets a little irritant inside of its body a grain of sand a little tiny piece of stone and it begins to rub that little old tiny animal the wrong way and it starts secreting this stuff in its body to surround that little Thorn that little Stone whatever it was so a pearl is formed out of much labor and pain and anguish and ain't no wonder you didn't make the gates out of gold and you didn't make the gates out of silver but you wanted to make the gates out of a gigantic Pearl every child of God that walks through those Gates will look up at them and be able to know their life matches the entryway to heaven because they themselves are a pearl as well oh Jesus help us tonight father forgive us of our mistakes forgive us of our wrongs Lord God if our building has any wood Lord God may we by the grace of God tonight temporarily pull that thing out and replace it with something substantial something permanent it don't necessarily mean we have to start all over again but let us just go to that one spot and pull it out maybe an attitude arrogance whatever more Lord God may we be first honest enough to admit it and then pull it out of our Lives Lord God we love you tonight Jesus how many loves him with all your heart you want him just to search you tonight friends will you say it with me Lord just search me just search me Lord Jesus you find any wood any hay any stubble anything Lord that will not endure help me Lord Lord I'm getting up in years if I live a couple more months I'll be 67 years old I'm only one breath away from going into eternity I don't want to play I've never wanted to play I sure don't want to now Lord oh Jesus I want to be true I want to be genuine I want to be sincere Lord Hallelujah help me Lord help me my word be fire testing fire proven may my gold be able to match the Touchstone may my silver not be brittle but may it withstand the fire granted Lord God thank you Heavenly Father we worship you tonight Jesus come and just raise our hands now in the presence of the king Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord God we worship you tonight Jesus we worship you father let our church truly be an Apostolic Church based on the principles of the Bible May every preacher that goes out of this church may his ministry be based like that in the book of Acts May every believer witness that they are a bible-believing Christian oh Jesus bring your people back to the original word Hallelujah father we worship you tonight Lord God we can just worship him a little and we just trust your poor and a little bit of oil tonight in our wounds rub us down a little bit before we go help us well I want to line up to his word I believe you do too I don't think we're here tonight to play I don't think you've come to see this one or that one I believe you've come to hear the truth and by hearing it we will walk out of no bed remember I told you last week really you only believe how much of the word that you obey and put into action it's easy to say I believe every word well let's just say how much of it that you obey that's what really reflects Who We Are going to sing something together every singer every musician every brother that slides a button up there on the top the brothers that's up there in the internet room every Deek can ever trustee those in the library every Sunday school teacher every one of us we want what we do for the Lord and what we do for his people to be able to withstand the fire that's coming because every one of your works will be traged us on that so we

will not be able to stand the fire but you and your mercy how merciful you are that many of those people will be saved they will be saved but Lord God we don't want to just be saved but we want to bring to you things I don't want to do things for reward I want to do things because I'm called to work with you I'm called to labor with you Lord God I pray that should help me Jesus as I get older I may not be as strong and I may not be able to go like I could when I was a younger man but as long as you count me fit I want to labor as long as you want me to labor not from my own Glory but for you for your people Lord God help me help me Jesus if there's any wood any stubble any hay in me show me Jesus I beg you show me so I can get rid of it Lord the fire is coming it's coming Lord we want to
