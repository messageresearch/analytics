[47:02] thank the
[47:04] Lord thank the Lord amen well I just
[47:08] want to say how proud I am of all of you
[47:12] Carol and
[47:13] I'm all that you've been doing this week
[47:16] each one in their
[47:18] own way and their own ability to be able
[47:21] to do
[47:22] something
[47:24] um it's such a terrible
[47:27] terrible time for so many of these
[47:30] people and if we can help them a little
[47:33] bit get through it and as you saw from
[47:37] the videos some of the people weren't
[47:39] dressed the way we believe in
[47:42] dressing no doubt they believe all kinds
[47:44] of different things than what we
[47:47] believe but what I look at is a human
[47:51] being in a great desperate need
[47:55] yeah so we're not there to pass out
[47:59] tracks and teach him about
[48:03] serpy but if they can see
[48:09] Jesus none of us can
[48:11] do even what Dolly pardon done she took
[48:16] $2 million from her personal account not
[48:19] her corporations plural $2 million to
[48:24] somebody like that ain't nothing all
[48:27] kinds of different people are helping
[48:29] but we want to help with the touch of
[48:34] Jesus right yeah
[48:38] amen let's um read today from The Book
[48:42] of Matthew chapter
[48:47] 14 Matthew chapter 14
[48:52] verse4 and Jesus went forth
[48:57] and saw a great
[49:00] multitude and was moved with
[49:04] compassion toward
[49:07] them and
[49:09] healed their
[49:11] sick I wonder how many of them people
[49:13] were actually what we would call message
[49:17] Believers in that
[49:20] day sometimes looking at the disciples
[49:22] you wonder how many of them they
[49:24] were they didn't understand what the
[49:26] message was about did they they didn't
[49:28] have the Holy
[49:29] Ghost but what I love about him is that
[49:32] he didn't look out and sort him out now
[49:34] he could look and know this one is this
[49:38] one ain't this one is this one ain't all
[49:40] of you that are stand on this side all
[49:42] of you that ain't stand over on this
[49:45] side will help you but we won't help you
[49:49] he causes the sun to shine upon the just
[49:52] and the unjust and the rain as
[49:55] well I love the way Matthew writes this
[49:58] and he says that he saw a great
[49:59] multitude and was moved with compassion
[50:04] toward them now remember the prophet
[50:06] tells us that compassion is not human
[50:10] sympathy compassion is doing the will of
[50:14] God a lot of these people that's doing a
[50:17] lot of things they're doing they're
[50:18] doing it out of human compassion I'm
[50:20] glad we still got some humans that have
[50:22] a little bit of compassion aren't you
[50:25] but we want to do it with some mix
[50:26] mixture of human sympathy but compassion
[50:31] finding the will of
[50:33] God and he healed their sick and when it
[50:36] was
[50:37] evening his disciples came to him
[50:40] saying this is a desert place and the
[50:45] time is now passed send the
[50:49] multitude
[50:51] away now in one way you think I
[50:55] understand where they were coming from
[50:56] to a
[50:58] degree but we're in a desert okay that
[51:01] we're not Walmarts down the road targets
[51:04] we're in the desert but the disciples
[51:07] said just get rid of
[51:09] them send them
[51:15] away I pray we're not like
[51:18] that not only just in flood time but
[51:23] anytime this is a desert place in the
[51:26] time has now passed send the multitude
[51:28] away that they may go into the villages
[51:30] and buy themselves
[51:35] victuals but Jesus said unto
[51:39] them they need not
[51:42] depart give you
[51:45] them to eat now you imagine them looking
[51:49] at one another and thinking he is so
[51:53] weird he is so strange are you kid
[51:56] kiding
[51:57] me
[51:59] multitudes now remember there were 5,000
[52:02] men but historians and theologian say
[52:05] that was on the masculine number that
[52:07] they gave that the crowd would have been
[52:10] between
[52:11] 15 to
[52:15] 20,000 time you add the
[52:17] women and the
[52:20] children 15 to 20,000 starving people
[52:26] and Jesus tells them give ye them to eat
[52:32] Esther chapter 4 verse
[52:35] 14 and from here's what I'd like to
[52:38] speak to you today
[52:40] on for if thou alt together holdest thy
[52:43] peace at this time then shall there be
[52:48] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[52:51] Jews from another place but thou in thy
[52:55] father's house
[52:57] shall be destroyed now remember Mori is
[53:00] speaking to
[53:02] Esther and who
[53:05] knoweth whether Thou Art come to the
[53:10] kingdom for such a
[53:13] time as
[53:17] this that's what I want to speak to you
[53:19] about this morning such a time as this
[53:23] how many has a request on your heart
[53:25] today something you'd like to the Lord
[53:28] to be mindful
[53:30] of I like for us also to
[53:33] remember
[53:34] Sister Susanna Wade Holmes and her
[53:38] children have had a very traumatic thing
[53:42] to happen in their family yesterday and
[53:45] they certainly need our prayers and help
[53:49] and uh just hold them in your heart if
[53:51] you
[53:52] would Lord Jesus we bow our heads before
[53:55] you today
[53:57] with Thanksgiving once again that we can
[54:00] come to this place that you've given
[54:03] us and Lord as
[54:06] I walked
[54:08] around here yesterday
[54:11] and so all the things that was going on
[54:14] and all the food and water lined up our
[54:20] entryways on both sides
[54:24] and all the things that are here to
[54:26] reach out to the needy during this
[54:31] time and I thought once again our new
[54:36] facility is being a blessing to so many
[54:41] people and again I want to thank you for
[54:44] giving it to us had we been over it at
[54:47] our other church we couldn't have done
[54:49] any of this
[54:52] hardly but if we follow you and we
[54:55] please you
[54:57] then you'll prove that you're with us
[54:59] Lord so we want to use these things
[55:05] wisely Lord God I I pray that you'd help
[55:08] each of
[55:09] us that we can be
[55:13] Jesus speak to us today from your word
[55:15] father we pray in Jesus name and the
[55:19] saint said amen amen God bless you you
[55:23] may be seated
[55:29] I realize I'm speaking
[55:31] to an international audience today maybe
[55:34] some of you are wondering um what we
[55:38] have been doing and a terrible hurricane
[55:41] came through our way last week brought
[55:44] torrential rains delude in some places
[55:47] and as um devastated many of the
[55:52] surrounding communities and and our
[55:55] region
[55:57] I was talking to brother Fred Mullins
[55:58] last night and he was asking me how many
[56:02] people in our church had their homes
[56:07] destroyed and I told him
[56:10] none how many people in your church lost
[56:12] their life said
[56:15] none so he
[56:16] said why are you all doing this he said
[56:20] I I'd heard that it started because of
[56:23] the needs of your own people I said no
[56:26] it actually didn't have anything to do
[56:28] with the needs of our
[56:30] people it started a week ago Sunday when
[56:33] one of the brothers of our church had a
[56:36] man that he works with and knew that
[56:38] there was a a real dire need and it went
[56:41] from a couple of different Brothers
[56:43] trying to reach out to help somebody get
[56:46] out from where that they were separated
[56:48] from everybody else so it started from
[56:51] there and then it's exploded into what
[56:55] it is today
[56:57] and as I begin to hear about some of
[57:00] these things and been contacted by
[57:04] people from different states and
[57:05] different parts of the world about
[57:07] what's going on and people wanting to
[57:10] help and as I said it several times in
[57:14] the last few days times like this bring
[57:17] out the best in people but it can also
[57:20] bring out the worst in
[57:22] others because some people look at this
[57:24] as an opportunity to Rob to steal some
[57:28] people look at it as a photo op so their
[57:31] picture can go on here or there there
[57:34] social media or YouTube or whatever um
[57:38] we're not interested in any of that as a
[57:41] matter of fact I I wouldn't care if
[57:43] nobody ever knew that our church existed
[57:46] during this time frame because we're not
[57:49] here so that we could draw attention
[57:52] somehow to ourself for those of you that
[57:56] have given up your time I know some of
[57:58] you taken off work some of you have
[58:00] spent only God knows how much the
[58:03] brothers have spent of their own money
[58:05] buying fuel buying diesel fuel gasoline
[58:09] taking off of work all that you've done
[58:11] all that you've contributed I want to
[58:14] say from all of my heart thank you so
[58:17] much for what you've done and then
[58:19] somehow it exploded to where other
[58:23] people heard about it we've been getting
[58:25] uh cont contributions from California
[58:28] from Ohio from Indiana from all over
[58:32] Tennessee all over everywhere you know
[58:35] how in the world has it come you think
[58:37] I'm not really sure but as I've been
[58:39] thinking about it and praying about it
[58:41] this week I I begin to realize that God
[58:46] has allowed us to be in this particular
[58:51] moment amen now had we tried to
[58:55] orchestrate this so that somehow we
[58:58] could get something out of it uh none of
[59:00] us here are politicians or I hope or not
[59:03] anyway so none of us are running for an
[59:07] office uh we're certainly not want to be
[59:09] Governor mayor president vice president
[59:13] nothing like that so we're just Desiring
[59:17] to help human beings in this time of of
[59:20] great need and hopefully the Lord will
[59:24] help me this morning
[59:26] that maybe I can bring something from
[59:29] the scripture and something also from
[59:32] the message that'll help us to see a
[59:36] portion of the third pool that maybe
[59:40] you've never looked at
[59:44] before since most of the time we think
[59:47] about the third pool being great
[59:50] phenomenal and great Supernatural and
[59:54] you know this particular man speaking
[59:57] the word and this and this but brother
[1:00:01] Andrew Glover sent me a quote the other
[1:00:02] day and I I just thought it was
[1:00:05] absolutely astounding let us go back to
[1:00:09] the account that Matthew gives in
[1:00:11] Matthew chap 14: 16 we'll read it again
[1:00:16] but Jesus said unto them they need not
[1:00:19] depart give ye them to eat and they say
[1:00:24] unto him we have here but Five
[1:00:29] Loaves and two
[1:00:31] fishes now the
[1:00:34] critics of this miracle say that the
[1:00:38] loaves were bigger in that
[1:00:45] day so to feed 15 to 20,000 I mean them
[1:00:50] loaves that have to be from here to
[1:00:51] Johnson City long wouldn't
[1:00:54] they and I mean a beluga whale wouldn't
[1:00:58] be big
[1:01:01] enough but remember John tells us in his
[1:01:05] account of
[1:01:08] this a little
[1:01:11] boy took it for
[1:01:14] lunch I mean I know little boys have got
[1:01:17] a bottomless pit sometimes but I ain't
[1:01:19] never seen a little boy with a lunch
[1:01:21] basket that big
[1:01:26] but there's a few groups that we want to
[1:01:29] look at
[1:01:32] today I want to look at that little boy
[1:01:36] first of
[1:01:39] all we don't know his
[1:01:42] name we don't know what
[1:01:45] class that he came out
[1:01:47] of being a
[1:01:49] Jew was he a Pharisee a sadducee a
[1:01:54] herodian
[1:01:56] John mentions nothing
[1:01:58] about any of that but he just calls him
[1:02:02] a
[1:02:05] lad so here's this little
[1:02:08] lad he's just going on his everyday
[1:02:11] thinging the prophet kind of dramatizes
[1:02:13] it a little bit so the little boy was
[1:02:15] actually skipping
[1:02:18] school playing trins out of school so
[1:02:21] here's a big crowd he thinks he can get
[1:02:23] lost in the school and maybe mama will
[1:02:26] never find
[1:02:28] out but I personally
[1:02:32] think God had it orchestrate oh
[1:02:38] yeah you see as long as that little
[1:02:41] boy had them Loaves and
[1:02:44] Fishes it would be a boy's lunch and
[1:02:47] maybe a you know a little bit of a
[1:02:50] snack later in the
[1:02:53] day but in Jesus hands
[1:02:56] oh
[1:03:00] amen and they say unto him we have here
[1:03:03] but Five Loaves and two fishes and he
[1:03:06] said bring them thither to
[1:03:10] me now we get another person in
[1:03:14] view we have the little
[1:03:17] boy we have the
[1:03:20] disciples and now we have the miracle
[1:03:23] worker
[1:03:26] the little boy nor the disciples could
[1:03:29] work miracles with this
[1:03:34] bread and this is what we want to keep
[1:03:36] before us in all that we're
[1:03:39] doing how long would this last I don't
[1:03:42] know another week two three I don't have
[1:03:46] a
[1:03:47] clue but I know the Lord Jesus wants us
[1:03:52] in all that we do to keep him first yeah
[1:03:56] amen and remember with all the good that
[1:03:59] is being
[1:04:00] done as your pastor let me warn
[1:04:04] you Satan will love to come in and
[1:04:10] divide or separate or difference of
[1:04:13] opinion on administrative Avenues or
[1:04:15] this or that or the other don't let him
[1:04:18] do
[1:04:19] that don't let the devil do that let God
[1:04:23] continue to use us well brother Don what
[1:04:26] about when it's over when it's over we
[1:04:28] will just say thank God it's done praise
[1:04:33] the Lord these people have been helped
[1:04:35] and then we'll continue to go
[1:04:38] on and hopefully there won't be no more
[1:04:40] tragedies we've got to
[1:04:42] do now I don't mind telling you that as
[1:04:45] I've been thinking about this thing this
[1:04:48] week and my mind has fast forwarded in
[1:04:53] time to the Great Tribulation
[1:04:57] period what has happened in Western
[1:05:00] North Carolina in Tennessee in Florida
[1:05:03] in Virginia and different places that
[1:05:05] have been hit by this terrible thing I'm
[1:05:08] telling you friends are nothing compared
[1:05:11] to what's fixing to be turned loose
[1:05:13] that's right in this earth am and as a
[1:05:16] servant of God I'm telling you you don't
[1:05:19] want to be left
[1:05:20] here because there won't be one Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost filled child of God
[1:05:26] to be here to bring you comfort right we
[1:05:29] want to be ready to leave this
[1:05:33] world so the little lad must hear it
[1:05:37] rumored that Jesus has told the
[1:05:39] disciples we got to help these people so
[1:05:43] he
[1:05:44] brings his lunch to
[1:05:47] them and Jesus said he said bring them
[1:05:51] thither to me and he commanded the
[1:05:54] multitude to set down on the grass and
[1:05:57] took the Five Loaves and the two
[1:06:02] fishes looking up to
[1:06:06] heaven that it
[1:06:09] amazing before things can be multiplied
[1:06:12] properly for the dispersion of the
[1:06:16] saints of
[1:06:18] God we must not look to
[1:06:21] FEMA we must not look to Washington
[1:06:25] here you
[1:06:27] go here you
[1:06:36] go and looking up to
[1:06:39] heaven he
[1:06:42] blessed and
[1:06:45] break for those of you that wasn't here
[1:06:49] yesterday and the rest of the week
[1:06:52] that's what's been going on out here
[1:06:55] as I walked in and I
[1:06:58] saw a well oiled
[1:07:02] machine I saw people running around with
[1:07:05] pads and iPads and ink pens and pencils
[1:07:07] and you do this and you do that and you
[1:07:09] do that you know what I come to the
[1:07:11] conclusion whenever I saw this you all
[1:07:15] don't need me any
[1:07:18] longer so I think I'm about ready to
[1:07:23] retire but I saw water an all awesome
[1:07:26] thing you know you got this one that can
[1:07:29] do that and this one that can do that
[1:07:31] and another one that can do this
[1:07:32] brothers that can drive trucks and
[1:07:34] deliver and go up and do all of this it
[1:07:37] was just absolutely awesome to see it
[1:07:40] was just as if though we had been
[1:07:45] trained for
[1:07:51] years
[1:07:53] listen that was as if the though we had
[1:07:56] been
[1:07:57] trained disciplined
[1:08:00] taught for years oh
[1:08:03] yeah I hope you're not blind
[1:08:06] today we have been I said we have been
[1:08:11] how could this be well first of all we
[1:08:14] look up to
[1:08:16] heaven and he blessed and Brak now watch
[1:08:21] and gave the loaves to his
[1:08:27] disciples so the little boy renders to
[1:08:30] the disciples in the unmultiplied
[1:08:34] form they get it all together they keep
[1:08:37] records of
[1:08:38] it okay so they had a record they know
[1:08:42] how many they had we got Five Loaves and
[1:08:44] two
[1:08:45] fishes now I told brother Michael in
[1:08:47] their discourse in the last few days
[1:08:49] brother Michael I want pictures taken of
[1:08:51] this stuff we want to be accountable
[1:08:55] for what people are trusting us
[1:08:59] with
[1:09:00] right we want to be accountable so we
[1:09:03] want to keep a record we want to have
[1:09:06] pictures so people can can be able to
[1:09:07] say hey what are these people doing with
[1:09:10] the water we're giving them what are
[1:09:12] they doing with the food what are they
[1:09:13] doing with the money that we're giving
[1:09:15] them okay I want that so we can be able
[1:09:19] if anybody ever wants to come back and
[1:09:21] say hey what did you all do with this
[1:09:23] money or with these contributions we can
[1:09:25] show them can we not so here the
[1:09:29] disciples had an accurate count of how
[1:09:32] many cases of water that they' received
[1:09:34] oh yeah and how many fish they had and
[1:09:36] how many loaves and all of that and then
[1:09:39] they're going to disperse it so who is
[1:09:42] going to disperse it the disciples
[1:09:47] not
[1:09:51] Jesus we got any disciples here today
[1:09:57] and gave the loaves to the disciples and
[1:10:00] the
[1:10:01] disciples
[1:10:02] to the multitude don't you love the way
[1:10:06] God works now they couldn't do the
[1:10:08] miracle the apostles couldn't do the
[1:10:11] fish nor the breath that was the little
[1:10:13] boy's part isn't it amazing how God
[1:10:17] incorporates so many people now wonder
[1:10:20] if this little boy ever wrote a book
[1:10:23] about this about his life and it was a
[1:10:27] first century
[1:10:29] bestseller and he went around with photo
[1:10:32] ops and I'm the little boy I'm the
[1:10:36] little boy look at what I
[1:10:41] done neither are we interested in
[1:10:48] such but if God can use
[1:10:52] us to help somebody amen
[1:10:56] but brother Donnie what if they never
[1:10:57] come to the word that'll be just fine if
[1:11:01] they can't come to this word when you
[1:11:03] and I stand before the Lord Jesus at
[1:11:05] that day and he looks at us and says
[1:11:10] you were my
[1:11:13] hands you were my
[1:11:17] feet to show the
[1:11:20] multitude in North Carolina and
[1:11:23] Tennessee and here and there and there
[1:11:26] there is still a loving merciful god and
[1:11:28] let me just resolve this for you today
[1:11:30] in case you're wondering the Lord Jesus
[1:11:33] never calls this hurricane no he does
[1:11:36] not do such it was the prince of the
[1:11:40] power of the
[1:11:42] air but the Lord Jesus knew it was
[1:11:44] coming and he said but this is what I'm
[1:11:46] fixing to do I'm fixing to put my mercy
[1:11:49] and my love on display oh I love talking
[1:11:53] to an invisible God I love praying to an
[1:11:56] invisible God but I don't mind tell you
[1:11:59] there are times in my life I need a god
[1:12:04] with skin on
[1:12:06] him
[1:12:08] hallelujah
[1:12:13] hallelujah and they did all eat and were
[1:12:18] filled and they took up of the fragments
[1:12:22] that remained 12 basketful now here
[1:12:26] they've taken care of the the hunger and
[1:12:29] all that they're going through and you
[1:12:31] think and the Lord Jesus actually made
[1:12:35] more than what they needed so reckon
[1:12:38] what they done put it in the
[1:12:41] dumpster wonder what they done brother
[1:12:44] Daryl with what was left over I don't
[1:12:47] believe Jesus will put more in our hands
[1:12:50] on what there will be a need
[1:12:53] for but you see this is for man if man
[1:12:56] isn't careful then he goes to looking at
[1:12:58] what's left over and then you'll say oh
[1:13:01] wait wait wait a what What About Us then
[1:13:04] maybe we'll get a little something out
[1:13:06] of this no it's nothing about us getting
[1:13:09] anything out of this I want no glory
[1:13:11] anybody here want Glory shame on you if
[1:13:13] you do we want no glory we want no
[1:13:16] recognition we want him to get all the
[1:13:19] glory amen thank God for the little boys
[1:13:22] on the internet the little girls on the
[1:13:24] internet in California wherever they are
[1:13:27] they're putting loaves in our hands
[1:13:29] they're putting fishes in our hands
[1:13:32] thank God for every one of you my
[1:13:34] brother Michael been keeping me updated
[1:13:36] on the numbers of this and that over 600
[1:13:39] meals prepared out of our kitchen to be
[1:13:43] able to go feed these people sisters as
[1:13:47] the pastor I want to thank you cuz I
[1:13:51] know you had to take time from your
[1:13:53] families
[1:14:00] oh my notice in verse 21 and they that
[1:14:03] had eaten were about
[1:14:06] 5,000
[1:14:09] men beside
[1:14:12] women and
[1:14:14] children so 15 to
[1:14:17] 20,000 people fed with a little boy's
[1:14:22] lunch
[1:14:26] praise the
[1:14:30] Lord read with me in Matthew chapter 20
[1:14:33] verse
[1:14:34] 25 James and John's
[1:14:38] mother had come to Jesus and I remember
[1:14:40] their father was Zebedee we don't
[1:14:42] scripturally know what her name was but
[1:14:45] she had come to Jesus asking for a
[1:14:50] favor and Jesus said what would
[1:14:53] you and she he said I
[1:14:56] want my two
[1:14:59] boys to have a favored position in your
[1:15:03] kingdom I want one of them on the left
[1:15:06] and I want the other one on the
[1:15:11] right now can you imagine how the Lord
[1:15:14] Jesus must have
[1:15:16] felt when she asked
[1:15:21] this this is his response Jesus now
[1:15:25] confronts James and John you can read it
[1:15:27] verse 22 23 24 but to save time but
[1:15:31] Jesus called them unto him and said ye
[1:15:35] know that the princes of the
[1:15:38] Gentiles exercise
[1:15:41] dominion over them look at what the word
[1:15:45] dominion means to be Lord over exercise
[1:15:49] lordship over to bring under one's power
[1:15:55] to subdue or
[1:15:59] Master now watch Jesus chooses his words
[1:16:02] wisely listen to these next few words
[1:16:06] you know the princes of the Gentiles
[1:16:08] exercise dominion over them that they
[1:16:12] that they that are
[1:16:14] great exercise Authority upon them but
[1:16:19] it shall not be
[1:16:22] so among you
[1:16:26] but whosoever will be
[1:16:28] great among
[1:16:31] you let him be your
[1:16:37] minister now this is the word the Greek
[1:16:40] word that we get the word Deacon from
[1:16:44] deonas look at the meaning of this one
[1:16:47] one who executes the
[1:16:50] commands of
[1:16:53] others now can't you see why God was so
[1:16:56] against that nickan thing in the first
[1:16:59] age at the end of that age when it goes
[1:17:02] into that and they go to electing
[1:17:04] Bishops and all types of overseers and
[1:17:07] archbishops and all this and that and
[1:17:09] the other and they're the big men and
[1:17:11] they tell everybody else what to do and
[1:17:13] they don't do
[1:17:14] nothing Jesus said that's not the way
[1:17:17] it's going to be in my
[1:17:19] kingdom now some people have that
[1:17:21] mentality we
[1:17:23] know notice
[1:17:25] this word it says one who by the virtue
[1:17:29] of the office assigned to him by the
[1:17:34] church cares for the
[1:17:37] poor and has charge of and
[1:17:41] distributes the
[1:17:44] money collected for their
[1:17:48] use
[1:17:49] wow another phrase of the meaning of
[1:17:52] this word is a waiter
[1:17:57] one who serves
[1:18:00] food and
[1:18:03] drink do you understand part of the
[1:18:05] ministry of the son of man sir was not
[1:18:11] to be ministered
[1:18:12] to but to minister to others
[1:18:19] right I wonder how close we are to the
[1:18:23] coming of the
[1:18:27] Lord if God can subject our ideas of
[1:18:32] where the great Queen and where the this
[1:18:34] and that and the
[1:18:36] other to humility and
[1:18:39] [Music]
[1:18:42] servitude even to those that no doubt
[1:18:45] some of them will research our church
[1:18:48] after this is all said and done and
[1:18:50] they'll think oh my goodness I didn't
[1:18:52] know them people's a bunch of rits oh my
[1:18:55] goodness I didn't know they believe this
[1:18:56] and that and the other we're not handing
[1:18:58] out bromite
[1:18:59] water the Cheerios are not boxed by
[1:19:02] brandom mites it's General meals and
[1:19:05] we're not brandom mites in no way we're
[1:19:08] Christians but we do follow the
[1:19:11] message of that
[1:19:16] Prophet well praise the Lord we're done
[1:19:19] opening the boxes of all this stuff and
[1:19:21] putting in Brandon my pills and then
[1:19:23] once they get a bite of cereal
[1:19:25] they become an instant brandom out we're
[1:19:27] trying to feed them we're trying to
[1:19:29] shelter them we'll get them blankets
[1:19:31] we'll buy coats for them we'll do
[1:19:32] whatever we can do to help them why cuz
[1:19:35] that's who we
[1:19:44] are our name
[1:19:47] is
[1:19:51] eser come on now
[1:19:54] yes amen Lord
[1:19:57] Jesus and whosoever will be Chief among
[1:20:01] you let him be your servant even as the
[1:20:06] son of
[1:20:07] man came not to be ministered
[1:20:12] unto but to
[1:20:14] minister and to give his
[1:20:18] life a
[1:20:20] ransom for
[1:20:22] many brothers those of you that's in
[1:20:25] these delivery
[1:20:28] routes you see the looks that comes upon
[1:20:31] some of these people's
[1:20:34] faces they may think in their mind
[1:20:36] they'll never see you
[1:20:38] again but they
[1:20:40] will you sisters that are cooking you
[1:20:43] that are dividing all this stuff as it
[1:20:45] comes in here there and there as how
[1:20:48] sure yesterday I said Brothers tell me
[1:20:50] what what can I do so well there's a
[1:20:52] truck here you can help unload that so
[1:20:53] I'm not there to unload it
[1:20:55] and you hear we were unloading myself
[1:20:58] and brother Daniel Willis unloading
[1:21:01] Garden
[1:21:03] sprayers and I'm
[1:21:06] thinking killing
[1:21:08] weeds isn't that going to be the
[1:21:10] farthest thing from these people Minds I
[1:21:12] said brother
[1:21:13] Daniel why why would they donate
[1:21:16] this he said brother Donnie they're
[1:21:18] filling them up with water some of them
[1:21:20] that have black paint or spraying paint
[1:21:21] on them setting it out in the sun in the
[1:21:23] black will draw the Heat and they're
[1:21:27] taking
[1:21:28] showers with a garden
[1:21:35] sprayer and those of us that were
[1:21:37] without electricity for a couple days we
[1:21:39] thought the world was coming to an
[1:21:42] end we couldn't drink ice make ice out
[1:21:45] of our ice maker and we thought we was
[1:21:48] not going to be able to make it did
[1:21:50] we we're a spoil rotten bunch of people
[1:21:53] sometimes
[1:22:01] so an aspect of the son of man's
[1:22:05] Ministry was not that everybody would be
[1:22:07] running to him and serving him but
[1:22:11] rather that he would serve
[1:22:14] them I wonder my
[1:22:17] friends could this be part of the
[1:22:20] crowning of the Bride around the world
[1:22:24] not just this particular incident but
[1:22:26] that we will come into that phase
[1:22:29] remember it's not too long after this
[1:22:32] that our Lord goes to
[1:22:35] Calvary and remember one of the last
[1:22:37] great things that he did was bow before
[1:22:40] the feet of his
[1:22:43] disciples
[1:22:45] God
[1:22:46] washing his disciples
[1:22:50] feet and their idea of greatness
[1:22:54] must be
[1:22:59] destroyed help us
[1:23:03] Jesus Galatians chapter 6 verse
[1:23:08] 10 as we have
[1:23:12] therefore
[1:23:15] opportunity let us do
[1:23:18] good unto all that come to our
[1:23:22] church and then we might be able to
[1:23:25] reach out beyond our church and maybe a
[1:23:27] couple of more message churches in the
[1:23:32] area what's the Bible
[1:23:37] say
[1:23:40] Sinners
[1:23:43] wow let us do good unto all men now but
[1:23:46] I love the way Paul phrases this
[1:23:52] especially especially
[1:23:56] unto them who are of the
[1:23:59] household of
[1:24:01] faith but I was
[1:24:04] overwhelmed
[1:24:05] yesterday when I looked at this word
[1:24:09] opportunity I don't ever remember
[1:24:11] looking it up before maybe I
[1:24:13] have but the word is opportunity is
[1:24:18] season or Due
[1:24:21] Time a measure of time
[1:24:25] the time listen this
[1:24:29] word the time when things are
[1:24:34] brought to
[1:24:38] crisis
[1:24:39] wow I mean it's like I just got this
[1:24:42] letter in the mail yesterday you know
[1:24:44] and it's just right here you say God how
[1:24:46] perfect you
[1:24:49] are praise God the time when things are
[1:24:53] brought to crisis the
[1:24:58] decisive so when the opportunity arises
[1:25:01] Brother D does that mean we've not been
[1:25:03] helping people before oh no we've helped
[1:25:05] people around the world for decades
[1:25:08] absolutely decades but you know what it
[1:25:11] was like the Lord wanted to get us an
[1:25:14] opportunity what we wouldn't just send
[1:25:16] money overseas and money to Africa money
[1:25:19] to India you see you don't know it but
[1:25:22] you've helped drill water wells
[1:25:25] in
[1:25:26] Africa in
[1:25:28] India in different parts of the world
[1:25:31] and the brothers will ask me brother
[1:25:33] Donnie can we open this up to the entire
[1:25:36] Village and I say by all
[1:25:41] means you've helped with medicine in
[1:25:44] Vietnam you've helped with all kinds of
[1:25:47] things oh I'm just giving you a little
[1:25:49] bit of clue of what you're going to be
[1:25:51] rewarded for at the day of judgment
[1:25:54] we've helped but God wanted to let us I
[1:25:59] believe be a part of our own
[1:26:04] region thank the Lord I said thank the
[1:26:09] Lord
[1:26:12] amen
[1:26:14] hallelujah and no I don't want my
[1:26:17] picture on the front page of the Johnson
[1:26:19] City Press I've done been there and done
[1:26:21] that I didn't like the last results
[1:26:25] I my sermons have already been all over
[1:26:27] the Tri Cities I'm not interested in
[1:26:29] that happening again I don't care if
[1:26:31] nobody knows we ever exist as long as
[1:26:36] Jesus is pleased with the way we conduct
[1:26:39] ourself during this time and if he has
[1:26:42] dropped this opportunity in our lap I
[1:26:46] say we sees it and we do
[1:26:51] everything he wants us to
[1:26:57] do oh
[1:27:00] my
[1:27:01] now I know that
[1:27:05] people are posting all kinds of
[1:27:07] different things and I I want people to
[1:27:11] know where their money's going things
[1:27:13] like that but we we never want to focus
[1:27:17] on
[1:27:19] us when you post things you include
[1:27:24] those people who's made it
[1:27:26] possible so far we haven't had to take
[1:27:28] any money from the
[1:27:31] church it's all been funded so far from
[1:27:35] people
[1:27:38] everywhere I believe when God starts a
[1:27:40] work and establishes a work God will
[1:27:42] help him we've never had to raise one
[1:27:44] dime of money or ask any other churches
[1:27:46] to help pay for our church pay for our
[1:27:49] building praise the Lord there's people
[1:27:51] that sent money but I don't I just don't
[1:27:53] I I'm going to go that way I don't think
[1:27:55] I have to but I don't care one bit and
[1:27:58] standing up and asking an offering for
[1:27:59] somebody else I guarantee you that and
[1:28:02] we've not even had to we've not even had
[1:28:06] to pull for money and we know how
[1:28:08] churches have that recck you know the
[1:28:10] people looking that oh yeah they're
[1:28:11] always out for money well that ain't us
[1:28:14] well a lot of preachers I've known but
[1:28:16] that ain't this
[1:28:17] preacher and whenever you post things
[1:28:21] don't just mention our church has done
[1:28:23] this and our church has done that and
[1:28:25] our church be sure and
[1:28:27] include but people from here and there
[1:28:30] and there and there are working with us
[1:28:34] and you know what they've done many of
[1:28:35] these people they don't know us from
[1:28:37] Adam they do not know us at
[1:28:40] all right they don't know us so we do
[1:28:44] not want to let the Lord Jesus down in
[1:28:47] the way we represent him amen so just be
[1:28:52] careful when you're posting things and
[1:28:54] you know just don't make it sound like
[1:28:56] that we're tooting our own horn let the
[1:28:59] Lord toot our horn if he wants it
[1:29:01] tooted somebody said
[1:29:04] Amen Let Me Close Your momentarily
[1:29:07] brother Brandon and dealing with
[1:29:09] Ruth and he talks about the four stages
[1:29:12] of Ruth and he says Ruth's deciding
[1:29:15] making her decision Ruth
[1:29:19] serving Ruth resting Ruth
[1:29:24] rewarded as we come back Ruth making the
[1:29:27] decision Ruth after made her decision
[1:29:31] then Ruth is serving then roseth is
[1:29:35] resting then roseth is
[1:29:39] rewarded you know I think friends that
[1:29:41] if we after this and we say you know
[1:29:44] what this is a great thing maybe we
[1:29:46] should start making this a part of our
[1:29:48] church that we do this all the time and
[1:29:52] you see that's when we get in trouble
[1:29:54] yeah that's right because we think boy
[1:29:56] we were so successful we were just no no
[1:29:59] we we will be here and if the Lord
[1:30:00] whatever the Lord wants us to do praise
[1:30:02] the Lord for that but we want
[1:30:06] opportunity Divine opportunity and if
[1:30:10] the Lord allows it to happen again we'll
[1:30:12] do it again so what lessons are we going
[1:30:15] to learn out of what we're dealing with
[1:30:18] right
[1:30:18] now the Lord Jesus cares for all these
[1:30:22] people out here and I know I know I know
[1:30:25] there's some of you and you're looking
[1:30:27] say oh Lord have mercy you know we're
[1:30:29] breaking protocol oh this ain't going on
[1:30:32] this is a time of
[1:30:34] crisis in protocol everything probably
[1:30:37] ain't going to go by our rules that we
[1:30:40] made up but don't worry if time goes on
[1:30:44] we'll get back to the
[1:30:46] rules amen for some of you worry warts
[1:30:49] that are worried to death about the
[1:30:50] rules we still have the rules on the
[1:30:52] sign over there and we'll get back to
[1:30:55] him but in the time of emergency you
[1:30:57] have to kind of just do what you got to
[1:30:59] do to get it all leveled
[1:31:07] out I don't imagine any of those hungry
[1:31:10] people want to send a state inspector
[1:31:13] over to look our kitchen
[1:31:16] over you reckon you reckon they want to
[1:31:20] send anybody in to inspect our sisters
[1:31:22] and say I want to go to your house and
[1:31:24] see how clean your house is now Sister
[1:31:26] sure be clean do everything you can do
[1:31:29] to be respectful and prepare the meals
[1:31:31] and all that sort of thing but I dare
[1:31:33] say if I was hungry I could just about
[1:31:35] eat a Pome or a I mean I ain't
[1:31:37] never done it before but I figure if you
[1:31:40] get hungry enough you could do it so we
[1:31:42] want to keep it all in perspective but
[1:31:45] the main thing is this that it don't
[1:31:47] have to be run your way or your way or
[1:31:50] your way or your way cuz all of us have
[1:31:53] our own way but what we want to do is
[1:31:55] focus on the main need of the hour let's
[1:31:58] do what we can do help these poor people
[1:32:01] get settled back again praise the lord
[1:32:05] it's evident from our FEMA deal and all
[1:32:08] that they've done give a bunch of our
[1:32:09] money away from people that didn't even
[1:32:12] deserve it in the first place and now
[1:32:15] our citizens which have paid taxes for
[1:32:17] all these years they're leaving them
[1:32:19] high and
[1:32:21] dry come on well come on now I ain't
[1:32:24] running for
[1:32:26] president I don't have a dog in this
[1:32:29] race but I do think it's a crying shame
[1:32:31] whenever our own people are in need but
[1:32:35] the Lord Jesus is mindful of
[1:32:37] them thank God there's still some
[1:32:39] citizens in this nation that are willing
[1:32:42] to do what they need to do to help
[1:32:46] people listen this I'll close with
[1:32:50] this the prophet said God by a vision
[1:32:53] has told told me that my Ministry is
[1:32:56] making its Third
[1:32:58] change and I'm longing for it to begin
[1:33:01] here at the Tabernacle I don't know
[1:33:03] whether it will or not but I'm longing
[1:33:06] for it to do that and I trust it'll be
[1:33:10] some
[1:33:13] way that I'll be able to preach the
[1:33:15] gospel in such a way or do
[1:33:20] something that will help some suffering
[1:33:26] Humanity to be a
[1:33:28] happier way of
[1:33:31] life and a more
[1:33:35] healthier way of
[1:33:38] life it's my
[1:33:41] sincere
[1:33:46] desire
[1:33:48] wow so you mean the third phase of his
[1:33:51] ministry was not just about
[1:33:54] deep Min Min Mysteries and preachers
[1:33:58] being Lords over God's Heritage and
[1:34:01] arguing and debating over this point of
[1:34:04] Doctrine it was to help
[1:34:08] suffering
[1:34:11] Humanity Word of Life
[1:34:13] Church God is giving
[1:34:15] us an
[1:34:22] opportunity do we want to fulfill this
[1:34:25] quote and our portion we will never
[1:34:28] do we it's not our part remember much of
[1:34:32] this is the prophet's third pull it
[1:34:33] ain't mine no way it don't belong to no
[1:34:36] other preachers it's his but we're
[1:34:39] coming under the influence of that this
[1:34:42] was the desire of our messenger it was
[1:34:46] not to make a cult it was not to make a
[1:34:49] clan and make us weird and different and
[1:34:52] for us to walk around with a know stuck
[1:34:54] up in the air that we're better than
[1:34:55] these people and all of that sort of
[1:34:58] stff no wonder he said he prayed that
[1:35:01] God would help the doctors to find a
[1:35:04] cure for cancer why he loved
[1:35:11] Humanity Brother Don you afraid you'll
[1:35:13] love him too
[1:35:16] much well I'll tell you what if you want
[1:35:18] to find me guilty of something I pray
[1:35:21] all the evidence acts against me in that
[1:35:27] way that I was guilty of loving too much
[1:35:31] I was guilty of giving people a second
[1:35:35] chance I'm so glad we serve a God today
[1:35:39] who is a god of Second
[1:35:42] Chances not only second but sometimes
[1:35:45] third and fourth and
[1:35:48] fifth and
[1:35:52] sixth let's B our heads
[1:35:55] together for who knoweth whether Thou
[1:35:58] Art come to the kingdom for such a time
[1:36:01] as
[1:36:02] this those of you in India those of you
[1:36:05] in Africa those of you in Europe Iceland
[1:36:08] Greenland Finland Norway wherever you
[1:36:11] are around the world may the Lord God
[1:36:14] help each of
[1:36:16] you as the Bride Comes To Her Last Days
[1:36:19] upon the
[1:36:21] Earth May the ministry of the son of man
[1:36:25] Christ
[1:36:27] Jesus be so repeated in our
[1:36:30] lives that the last witness left to the
[1:36:35] Earth will not be necessarily joining
[1:36:38] this church and joining another message
[1:36:40] church but Jesus being
[1:36:44] alive Jesus in
[1:36:48] flesh upon the
[1:36:50] Earth no doubt some of these people
[1:36:52] that'll be helped by us they'll they'll
[1:36:55] find out about who we are and what we
[1:36:56] believe and some of them may make a
[1:36:58] YouTube video against us and all this
[1:37:00] and that and the other that don't make
[1:37:02] no
[1:37:03] difference we would go right back and
[1:37:05] help them
[1:37:07] again cuz that's who we
[1:37:10] are that's why Jesus could look from the
[1:37:14] cross remember where he was at when he
[1:37:18] said these words father forgive them for
[1:37:23] they know not what they
[1:37:25] do from what view from what angle from
[1:37:29] The
[1:37:30] Cross by now that crown of Victor's
[1:37:33] Thorns had been pressed down upon his
[1:37:35] head his head would have been swollen
[1:37:38] about the size of a wash
[1:37:41] bucket his lips would have been so
[1:37:44] swollen he was so thirsty at the loss of
[1:37:48] blood his heart rate going up and down
[1:37:51] his blood pressure
[1:37:53] oh to hear I read it not long ago of a
[1:37:57] medical doctor that took the crucifixion
[1:37:59] and went through it from a medical
[1:38:01] standpoint it was just
[1:38:04] horrifying but still he is the god of
[1:38:08] mercy so he
[1:38:10] looks not from a throne as it were a
[1:38:13] diadem in his hand a great purple robe
[1:38:18] but naked blood streaming down his
[1:38:22] body bar able to
[1:38:24] talk his mind rushed with pain and Agony
[1:38:28] and
[1:38:29] sorrow but he looked upon those who
[1:38:31] crucified Him Father forgive them for
[1:38:36] they don't know what they're
[1:38:39] doing oh we've typified the bride
[1:38:42] leaving in the world in a great
[1:38:44] Crescendo of Glory the bride doing this
[1:38:47] or that I wonder
[1:38:49] sometimes wonder if it won't be a
[1:38:52] mixture of many different aspects of
[1:38:55] Christ Jesus our
[1:38:58] lord that we forgive those who spoke
[1:39:01] against us pray for those who'
[1:39:03] despitefully used
[1:39:04] us your last deed before the
[1:39:08] Rapture may not be helping a message
[1:39:11] person it might be a poor wretched
[1:39:15] sinner in the very next day hail stones
[1:39:18] will be falling out of Heaven weighing a
[1:39:21] 100 lbs a piece and not violating the
[1:39:24] inhabitants upon the
[1:39:26] Earth but your last human work was
[1:39:30] something for the cause of the Lord
[1:39:33] Jesus
[1:39:37] hallelujah how many he wants to be more
[1:39:39] like him today just raise your hand to
[1:39:43] him I'm sure my friends that I have
[1:39:46] missed many
[1:39:48] opportunities and I hope you don't think
[1:39:50] I'm presuming by saying probably every
[1:39:53] everybody here has missed
[1:39:57] opportunities to let people
[1:39:59] see there is a God who's alive and
[1:40:04] well we know how politics works if it's
[1:40:07] a photo op that'll help you if it's not
[1:40:09] they don't
[1:40:11] care but we want to be Jesus not during
[1:40:14] this time of chaos but every day of our
[1:40:20] life Lord Jesus as we bow our heads to
[1:40:23] the dust of the
[1:40:26] earth father and our hearts certainly
[1:40:30] break for what has hit our
[1:40:34] region Lord and we certainly here today
[1:40:37] are not here to look down upon any of
[1:40:41] the other churches and the Tri Cities I
[1:40:44] I don't know what any of them are doing
[1:40:46] no doubt they're helping in different
[1:40:48] ways but we're not here to compare with
[1:40:50] this one that one the other one that's
[1:40:53] not the way we focus Lord we just want
[1:40:57] to do what you've placed in our
[1:40:59] hands we pray that you would help us to
[1:41:03] serve you Faithfully during this
[1:41:06] time I pray God that you would help each
[1:41:10] of those that have been working here
[1:41:13] tirelessly Lord I know that brother
[1:41:15] Michael told me the other day uh 14 16
[1:41:19] hours some of them been putting in Lord
[1:41:21] and I just pray
[1:41:23] father that you'd strengthen them I pray
[1:41:26] for the brothers Lord that are making
[1:41:29] these deliveries out in these
[1:41:32] communities help them lord they're
[1:41:35] seeing things experiencing
[1:41:38] things Lord that I'm sure is
[1:41:42] overwhelming dear God would you help
[1:41:44] them to know if they reach a spot that
[1:41:47] they need to take a little break from it
[1:41:49] because they're just getting
[1:41:52] overwhelmed a human being is only made
[1:41:55] to take so much
[1:41:57] trauma so much pain so much
[1:42:01] heartache so much
[1:42:04] suffering help my brothers Lord the
[1:42:07] sisters working all of them our youths I
[1:42:11] saw little children here yesterday and
[1:42:14] just trying to pack stuff and move stuff
[1:42:17] and just do what they can do I thought
[1:42:20] what a great thing that's what we want
[1:42:22] to instill in our children not to live a
[1:42:25] selfish life not to live a life that's
[1:42:28] just all about us no doubt they'd rather
[1:42:31] had their Saturday going somewhere and
[1:42:33] spending time together doing this or
[1:42:35] that but instead of doing that they
[1:42:38] wanted to be here doing something they
[1:42:40] could to help these people that they'll
[1:42:43] never even meet more than likely in this
[1:42:46] life help us
[1:42:48] Jesus whenever we send our last bottle
[1:42:52] water
[1:42:53] our last box of cereal has left our
[1:42:57] fellowship hall the last
[1:43:00] generator the last
[1:43:02] battery we go to sweeping it all up we
[1:43:06] look around and everything is
[1:43:09] gone and we breathe the sigh of relief
[1:43:11] and say praise the
[1:43:15] lord we want you to be
[1:43:19] pleased with what we've
[1:43:22] done we want you to be pleased with the
[1:43:25] way the sisters have behaved the way
[1:43:29] they've conducted
[1:43:31] themselves I know events like this can
[1:43:35] actually cause people to come together
[1:43:37] that haven't even been on speaking
[1:43:40] terms and yet all of a sudden that don't
[1:43:43] seem to matter no more but I pray when
[1:43:46] things like this past that we don't
[1:43:49] revert back to our non-speaking terms
[1:43:52] but we let it be something that'll be a
[1:43:54] remedy for us we're not asking for a
[1:43:58] blessing Lord but we know it's your
[1:44:02] law you'll bless us for our effort but
[1:44:05] right now we're not concerned about
[1:44:07] blessing we're concerned for strength
[1:44:11] wisdom Lord help my brothers as they go
[1:44:14] out to be Alik May these people
[1:44:19] feel the presence of Jesus
[1:44:24] I've seen many different videos of
[1:44:26] people from Spring Hill Tennessee and
[1:44:29] people from Samaritans Pur and people
[1:44:31] from here and there and there and we're
[1:44:33] so grateful for every one of them Carol
[1:44:35] and I saw about 10 or 12 pickup trucks
[1:44:39] yesterday coming out on South Rome we
[1:44:43] saw it before we come to the church it
[1:44:46] was wled there was gas cans there was
[1:44:48] all kinds of things and I told her I
[1:44:49] said oh no I hope they ain't going to
[1:44:52] the church
[1:44:54] church but sure enough we got behind
[1:44:56] them and they they passed and I said
[1:44:58] praise the Lord little did I realize
[1:45:01] there only truckloads more to come
[1:45:04] later but Lord it made me feel good
[1:45:06] people want to help one
[1:45:08] another I pray You' bless every one of
[1:45:11] them for that effort so we don't want to
[1:45:13] just be another pickup with a bottle of
[1:45:17] water but when my brother's feet hit the
[1:45:21] ground made the presence of the Lord yes
[1:45:25] be able to witness Lord and if there's
[1:45:28] any of that needs prayer and they sense
[1:45:30] it they're so down and so despondent
[1:45:33] these types of things make people want
[1:45:35] to take their
[1:45:37] life may my brothers be able to be
[1:45:40] sensitive and if they need to pray for
[1:45:43] them offer a word of
[1:45:46] prayer we believe we've been called for
[1:45:49] a
[1:45:50] mission the last call
[1:45:54] for the table to be
[1:45:56] filled with the sick the
[1:45:59] halt the
[1:46:01] lame the
[1:46:04] crippled help us Jesus to fulfill our
[1:46:07] part in this and may we not stop
[1:46:11] here oh Jesus may we be closer together

[1:46:16] body all the preachers that have
[1:46:18] contacted me Lord all the brothers from
