[27:49] in 2012 I think coming up here is a
[27:52] royal test if it was successful
[27:56] makes a guy kind of nervous when you
[27:58] have to stand in a

[28:59] open-air service I don't know
[29:01] but uh

[47:47] [Music]
[48:08] [Applause]
[48:28] [Applause]
[48:40] it's just a good thing I didn't know he
[48:42] was coming
[48:44] or he'd be standing up here tonight
[48:46] preaching
[48:48] met brother mental years and years ago
[48:50] and we've always had such a wonderful
[48:53] friendship I don't get seen that often
[48:55] but you know it is with some friends you
[48:57] have you
[48:59] don't get to see him very very often but
[49:01] every time you see him it's just like
[49:02] you just reconnect and there it is
[49:05] that's the way it's been my brother
[49:07] mental I want a pair of years ago and he
[49:10] took me around to preach in some of the
[49:12] different places and I just always have
[49:14] sort of admired our brother
[49:17] well Linda good to be here tonight
[49:19] praise the Lord
[49:21] thank you for being patient with us on
[49:23] the sound and the lights and all this
[49:26] new stuff we're getting used to so
[49:28] hopefully hopefully we'll get it all set
[49:30] here before long
[49:32] thank you for your patience
[49:34] Daniel chapter 2 verse 31.
[49:40] this whole world of ours is full of so
[49:43] much sorrow
[49:44] and difficulty and trouble and
[49:48] sadness and death and
[49:52] over 11
[49:54] 000 people lost their lives and as you
[49:57] know and the earthquake there in turkey
[49:59] and Syria and
[50:01] so much disease and heartache and just
[50:06] life itself
[50:07] so maybe for a little while
[50:09] again tonight we can be able to leave
[50:13] some of that aside
[50:15] and move into our future
[50:18] as Angel of the Lord till brother
[50:20] Branham years ago whenever he went to
[50:21] Africa and missed the will of God
[50:23] and picked up the amoeba thought he was
[50:26] going to die
[50:27] he was sitting in a tub of water praying
[50:29] asking God to help him
[50:32] and he saw these white pieces of paper
[50:34] and a hand tooken through them like that
[50:37] and like they made a a pathway up into
[50:40] heaven
[50:41] and the angel told him your way is clear
[50:46] and your future
[50:49] so if we can for a little bit tonight
[50:50] maybe we can lay aside our anxiety our
[50:54] trouble our worries of life and let's
[50:57] look at a little bit of our future
[50:59] because I'm telling you tonight your
[51:01] future is looking wonderful
[51:05] now I'm not a fortune teller but I am a
[51:08] future teller
[51:10] and if you're living for the Lord you're
[51:11] looking good if you ain't you're in big
[51:13] trouble so I can tell everybody's future
[51:16] depending on the way they're going to
[51:18] live
[51:19] let's read together
[51:21] Daniel chapter 2 verse 31.
[51:25] now this is the interpretation of the
[51:27] King Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[51:30] this is the beginning of the great
[51:34] Gentile kingdoms of the world and what
[51:37] God is showing this Heathen King the
[51:41] Heathen King has the dream but he
[51:44] doesn't have a clue what it means
[51:46] so God sends the prophet and the prophet
[51:50] doesn't re-dream it but he has a vision
[51:54] and then the prophet interprets the
[51:57] vision and this is where we pick up here
[51:59] in Daniel 2 31.
[52:02] thou O King saulst and behold a great
[52:06] image
[52:07] this great image whose brightness was
[52:11] excellent
[52:13] stood before thee and the form thereof
[52:16] was terrible
[52:18] this image's head
[52:21] was a fine gold now this was the king
[52:24] himself of course and the Babylonian
[52:26] Kingdom
[52:27] his breasts and his arms were of silver
[52:31] and his belly and his thighs of brass so
[52:34] he starts at the head and he starts
[52:36] defining it the way Daniel goes down as
[52:39] he does each one of these symbols which
[52:43] are symbolized by metal they're getting
[52:45] weaker and weaker and of less value but
[52:49] it's going to show the Babylonian the
[52:51] means of Persian come on down of course
[52:53] to the Roman at the bottom
[52:56] his legs of iron
[52:58] his feet were part iron and part of clay
[53:03] thou saw us till that a stone
[53:06] was cut out without hands
[53:10] which smoked the image upon his feet
[53:13] so notice where it hits him doesn't hit
[53:16] the image in the head it doesn't hit the
[53:18] image in the chest or the thighs but it
[53:21] hits the image in the feet
[53:24] and he said defeat that were of iron and
[53:27] Clay now iron and Clay is a mixture
[53:29] they're not there's no way that they can
[53:31] ever mix strong metallurgical mixed with
[53:34] dirt that's basically wet and moist so
[53:38] there's no way that it can go together
[53:40] so it shows a divided Kingdom there's
[53:43] where the weakness will be and break
[53:45] them to Pieces then was the iron the
[53:49] clay the brass the silver and the gold
[53:51] broken to pieces together and became
[53:55] like the chaff of the summer threshing
[53:58] floors and the wind carried them away
[54:03] that no place was found for them
[54:06] and the stone that smote the image
[54:09] became
[54:11] now notice the stone came out of a
[54:14] mountain
[54:16] and it come in a condescended form and
[54:20] then it became
[54:22] a great Mountain
[54:25] you're talking about the condensation of
[54:27] God in the form of his son which was
[54:30] himself in humanity so he comes from
[54:33] himself as a stone a rock just a small
[54:37] rock
[54:39] and then once that rock destroys these
[54:42] kingdoms then that rock becomes grows
[54:46] unfolds into a great mountain and filled
[54:51] the whole Earth
[54:54] I made a lot to be remembered tonight as
[54:55] we pray
[54:57] it's just our heads together if you
[54:59] would
[55:00] Heavenly Father we're
[55:02] truly blessed tonight to be able to once
[55:04] again stand in your presence
[55:07] we thank you Lord for everything that
[55:10] you mean to us you've done so many
[55:12] wonderful things for all of us
[55:15] we stand here tonight Lord with breath
[55:17] with life we have a provision of clothes
[55:20] and food and so many things that you've
[55:23] given to us and we want you to know that
[55:25] we are happy to be your people
[55:28] the psalmist David said it so many years
[55:30] ago happy are the people whose God is
[55:35] the Lord
[55:36] we ask you tonight father that you would
[55:39] catch us up
[55:40] you see the hour that we're living and
[55:43] there's trouble and despair and Sadness
[55:45] and Sorrow and death and politically and
[55:48] religiously every way we look we can see
[55:52] the world is at its end it's at the
[55:55] terminating point of all these kingdoms
[55:58] and it's because soon and very soon the
[56:02] stone will come and destroy and
[56:05] annihilate everything that is of this
[56:07] present world
[56:09] we pray father that you would fall upon
[56:12] us while we're in this Gentile
[56:15] dispensation may we by the grace of God
[56:18] be able to not be destroyed by this
[56:22] Stone but our nature will be annihilated
[56:24] we will be born again in the image of
[56:27] God so we can be part of that great
[56:30] Kingdom speak to us to not father from
[56:32] your word we pray in the name of the
[56:34] Lord Jesus
[56:36] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[56:39] you may be seated
[56:42] truly when God spoke to His prophets
[56:46] and these symbols
[56:48] it must have been very unusual to them
[56:51] and to the people that would hear them
[56:54] can you imagine being in the days of
[56:55] Daniel whenever this was written
[56:57] sometime after Daniel would have seen it
[56:59] and the people picking it up and trying
[57:02] to read and understand a stone silver
[57:06] gold brass iron clay what in the world
[57:09] does all that mean and what's amazing
[57:12] about it is that even though this was
[57:14] written over 2 700 years ago and yet to
[57:18] many people it's still just as much a
[57:20] mystery as it was when Daniel spoke at
[57:23] thin but yet God doesn't want it to
[57:25] remain a mystery we know that God
[57:28] desires for certain things in his word
[57:30] to be understood and truly this is one
[57:33] of them the stone does not represent
[57:35] Christianity it does not represent
[57:38] denominational systems it does not
[57:41] represent our church doesn't represent
[57:43] me or it doesn't represent you but it
[57:46] does represent our Lord Lord Jesus for
[57:50] he took on this form which was an
[57:53] Earthly image of course I find it so
[57:57] amazing that he humbled himself when he
[58:00] come to the Earth that he took on the
[58:02] form of the lamb and he was identified
[58:05] in the form of a servant according to
[58:08] the book of Isaiah he was identified as
[58:11] a sheep he was identified as a rock he
[58:15] was identified as a sacrifice he was
[58:18] identified at all these symbols that we
[58:21] could look around on the earth and think
[58:23] why in the world would he do that he did
[58:26] that for us you know it's a shame that
[58:28] man absolutely is totally lost without
[58:31] God and man has such a hard time trying
[58:33] to Humble himself and the great almighty
[58:36] God humbled himself so low that man can
[58:39] never get down that far it's just not
[58:41] any and you can see why that the kingdom
[58:44] of God is so misunderstood to the
[58:46] haughty to the high-minded to those who
[58:48] look look at themselves as being some
[58:50] great something to the world but we know
[58:53] that he reveals himself to those that
[58:55] will humble himself before his plan he's
[58:58] spoken of as the stone of course and the
[59:00] scripture to the Jews he was a stone of
[59:04] stumbling and a rock of offense now
[59:07] notice this is the exact same symbolism
[59:10] that Daniel sees him and they look at
[59:12] him the Jews identify him and they said
[59:15] oh my there's no way this man will not
[59:17] have him to rule over us are you kidding
[59:19] our Messiah is not going to be coming
[59:21] from the Nazareth and down in Jerusalem
[59:24] born down there in that little place
[59:26] called Bethlehem the house of God's
[59:28] bread his mother was a spouse of Joseph
[59:31] and and she conceived him out of holy
[59:34] wedlock and for him to be king over us
[59:37] no way we'll not take that man to be our
[59:40] ruler but we will will we not but yet to
[59:43] them he was a stone of stumbling and a
[59:47] rock of offense but to the New Testament
[59:50] Church he was the foundation stone that
[59:54] the building whole building of God is
[59:56] laid upon so it all depends on who you
[59:59] are and how you relate to the rock of
[1:00:03] God now he will fall on some people and
[1:00:06] crush them to powder but if we fall on
[1:00:10] him then we become broken and our nature
[1:00:13] becomes annihilated and we become part
[1:00:16] of the building so it all depends upon
[1:00:18] how we relate to this great Stone of
[1:00:22] almighty God the question is how do you
[1:00:24] and I relate tonight so here Daniel sees
[1:00:27] this image now before the cross and he
[1:00:29] sees it coming out of the mountain not
[1:00:32] youn out with hands must have been so
[1:00:35] perplexing to try to understand what
[1:00:39] does that even mean how could it be what
[1:00:42] is it and it comes out comes out of the
[1:00:46] mountain comes rolling down through hits
[1:00:48] the the image and the feet strikes it in
[1:00:51] the feet the feet combusting all two
[1:00:54] pieces the iron goes one way the clay
[1:00:57] goes another and when it does the
[1:00:59] entirety of the image falls down into
[1:01:03] shreds of gold and silver and iron and
[1:01:06] clay and there it lays smashed by what
[1:01:10] would seem to be an impossible Rock now
[1:01:14] it was not a mountain that hit it it was
[1:01:17] not a gigantic Boulder that was so big
[1:01:20] it would have took tractors and trailers
[1:01:23] and great big yuke trucks and a crane
[1:01:26] but simply a boulder that come rolling
[1:01:29] out of the heavens and hit it in the
[1:01:31] feet but John then rather Daniel sees
[1:01:34] the same thing John does and he watches
[1:01:36] as this Stone begins to grow
[1:01:40] what a what a strange thing it would
[1:01:43] have been for a prophet as he's looking
[1:01:45] there and he sees a rock and this rock
[1:01:49] starts growing growing and growing what
[1:01:54] in the world well why didn't God just
[1:01:56] come right out and tell him what he was
[1:01:58] because God runs his business the way he
[1:02:01] wants to
[1:02:03] now when he come the first time he did
[1:02:06] not destroy the Roman Empire as a matter
[1:02:09] of fact it looked like that the Roman
[1:02:11] Empire had the upper hand on him because
[1:02:14] he died under capital punishment and the
[1:02:18] death that he died was a Roman death it
[1:02:20] was not a Jewish death the Jews did not
[1:02:24] crucify their people the cappadocians
[1:02:27] did not crucify their people many of the
[1:02:30] Gentile heathens did not crucify even
[1:02:33] the worst of criminals but it was a
[1:02:36] Roman death so it looked like that Rome
[1:02:40] had the higher upper hand as we would
[1:02:42] say and even the Roman seal not the
[1:02:46] Jewish seal not the Syrian seal the
[1:02:50] Roman seal was what was on his tomb and
[1:02:53] it looked like Rome absolutely had the
[1:02:56] upper hand but we could go back to that
[1:02:58] tomb and see that he raised from the
[1:03:01] dead and broke the Roman seal and he
[1:03:03] showed right there one day he would
[1:03:06] annihilate the Roman Kingdom now since
[1:03:09] that time he and his servants had been
[1:03:12] hit in the Roman Kingdom up one side and
[1:03:14] down the other now they have had
[1:03:16] certainly a Dominion in the earth and
[1:03:19] they will get a mixture in the last days
[1:03:22] and they will mixed with the seed of man
[1:03:25] which is the representation of the clay
[1:03:28] in the feet so it's in the feet and it
[1:03:31] runs down to the ten toes which will be
[1:03:34] the the resurrection of the old Roman
[1:03:36] Empire in the ottoman Powers so they
[1:03:40] will rule as kings but they won't be
[1:03:42] Crown Kings which is a dictator so there
[1:03:46] was five toes on each foot which will be
[1:03:48] the ten kingdoms that that John saw in
[1:03:51] the Book of Revelation thank God a lot
[1:03:54] of this won't happen to the bride is
[1:03:56] already gone but we need to lay this out
[1:03:58] so you can see what's coming in your
[1:03:59] future so he comes first and he does
[1:04:03] certainly take a lick upon the Roman
[1:04:06] Empire and then the Roman Empire
[1:04:08] smites him and makes him to die and they
[1:04:12] think of course that they've got him so
[1:04:14] the first coming of Christ was not this
[1:04:17] falling of the stone that Daniel saw in
[1:04:20] this Vision but it was the coming of the
[1:04:23] Messianic prophecy of Psalm 22. now
[1:04:27] remember how we love Psalm 23 The Lord
[1:04:30] is my shepherd I shall not want we all
[1:04:32] learned it when we went to Sunday school
[1:04:34] but I know that you're aware of it the
[1:04:36] psalm 22 precedes Psalm 23 and Psalm 22
[1:04:41] which is the Messianic Psalm my God my
[1:04:44] God why hast Thou forsaken me all my
[1:04:46] bones they stare at me so the Messianic
[1:04:50] Psalm 22 is what leads him to the
[1:04:53] Victorious place to become the answer to
[1:04:57] be your Shepherd of Psalm 23. you see
[1:05:00] the Lord Jesus would never have been
[1:05:02] able to been your Shepherd of Psalm 23
[1:05:05] had he not fulfilled Psalm 22 understand
[1:05:08] your life and my life comes the same way
[1:05:11] sometimes we want to be a great
[1:05:13] Victorious church we want to be an
[1:05:15] overcoming church we want to be a great
[1:05:18] conquering church but before we can ever
[1:05:20] be that comes trials tests tribulation
[1:05:23] is that right hardship difficulty do we
[1:05:27] like it nope I don't like it a bit more
[1:05:29] now than I did when I first got saved I
[1:05:32] don't like tests I don't like trouble do
[1:05:34] you all like it any better I don't like
[1:05:36] it but if you do pray for me I don't
[1:05:38] like it one bit better but I know it's
[1:05:40] part of being a Christian I have to have
[1:05:42] trials but I'm always glad when they're
[1:05:44] over I have to have valleys but I'm
[1:05:47] always happy when I'm going out the
[1:05:48] other side anybody else feel the same
[1:05:50] way I know I know the prophet said
[1:05:53] you've got to have sickness on in order
[1:05:55] to appreciate Health but I've got to say
[1:05:57] I do appreciate Health better than I do
[1:06:00] sickness and I think I would be fine if
[1:06:02] I never had another dose of sickness the
[1:06:04] rest of my life if I never had another
[1:06:06] headache if I never had another heart
[1:06:08] day if I was never betrayed by another
[1:06:10] friend I think I'd be fine but yet we
[1:06:13] know it's part of the way this life
[1:06:15] works is that right so what are we
[1:06:18] longing for we're longing for that state
[1:06:20] of perfection when we will never have
[1:06:23] another trial we know it's coming and we
[1:06:26] know it's closer than it's ever been
[1:06:28] before but we know until we arrive at
[1:06:31] that hour we're going to have to fight
[1:06:33] hell but let us just say it this way
[1:06:35] we're going to fight hell and we're not
[1:06:37] going to let hell get by with it because
[1:06:39] hell we'll pay as long as we are here
[1:06:43] We believe We were born by the grace of
[1:06:46] God to torment tormenting Devils we're
[1:06:50] not just meant to go through life and
[1:06:52] hang our head and just barely survive
[1:06:54] pray for me I'll make it till Sunday oh
[1:06:56] no that's not the way I look at it I
[1:06:58] believe I was born to be such a Son of
[1:07:01] God that when I get up in the morning
[1:07:02] the devil says Dear God here he comes he
[1:07:06] didn't die during the night a heart
[1:07:07] attack didn't take him oh no another day
[1:07:10] was him on the Earth Yep devil here I
[1:07:12] come brother donius every day seemed
[1:07:14] Victorious no it doesn't there's days I
[1:07:17] feel like I've totally lost but you know
[1:07:19] what I'll still hold my head up because
[1:07:21] greater is he that is in me that he that
[1:07:24] is in the world I have disappointments I
[1:07:27] have days I don't feel Victorious I have
[1:07:30] days I feel like man I don't think I
[1:07:32] made no dent in hell at all but when
[1:07:34] it's all said and done I didn't bow to
[1:07:37] the devil I didn't bow to Leia to see it
[1:07:39] I'm still in love with Jesus so whether
[1:07:42] I feel anything or not that don't matter
[1:07:44] whether it feels like overcome hell or
[1:07:47] not that don't matter because at the end
[1:07:50] of the day I'm still saved I'm still
[1:07:52] Sanctified I've still got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:55] and hail trembles when I pray well I
[1:07:57] wish somebody would preach with me
[1:07:59] tonight I'm just talking about a
[1:08:01] Christian a preacher being that way but
[1:08:04] when the weakest Christian gets down on
[1:08:06] their knees to pray Devils begin to
[1:08:09] shake and tremble because you have got
[1:08:12] power with god oh yes I don't feel it
[1:08:16] you don't have to feel it it's because
[1:08:18] of what he's done in You by the new
[1:08:21] birth you've already got this rock
[1:08:24] inside of your soul
[1:08:28] Hallelujah
[1:08:29] [Applause]
[1:08:35] so the first coming
[1:08:37] was not the
[1:08:39] Stone Kingdom
[1:08:41] so it awaits in the future
[1:08:43] at the second Advent of Our Lord notice
[1:08:46] now in verse 44 of Daniel chapter 2. in
[1:08:50] the days of these Kings now Daniel was
[1:08:54] like some of the other prophets that God
[1:08:55] would show him a condensed form
[1:08:58] sometimes of a vision like chapter 2
[1:09:01] here and then he would send him over to
[1:09:03] chapter 7 and he would expound a little
[1:09:05] bit more on it then he'd go to chapter
[1:09:06] 10. and he was going to bring it into he
[1:09:09] goes and he'd bring in the two horns and
[1:09:11] he would prophesy about Antiochus
[1:09:13] epiphanies and he would go to all these
[1:09:16] symbols of a goat and a he-ram and all
[1:09:18] that sort of thing and he bounced kind
[1:09:20] of back and forth and Prophets could
[1:09:22] only say of course as God gave it to him
[1:09:23] but notice this in in Chapter 2 in the
[1:09:27] days of these Kings so again we come
[1:09:29] back to a certain time frame so the Lord
[1:09:32] Jesus could not come as the mighty
[1:09:36] Messianic King that the Jews are looking
[1:09:38] for they were looking for the son of
[1:09:41] David so it was a dispensational time
[1:09:43] Idol and they had it in the wrong
[1:09:46] dispensation they did not understand
[1:09:48] that he must come first as son of man
[1:09:51] then come back on the day of Pentecost
[1:09:54] as the Son of God and then in the
[1:09:56] Millennium he would come as son of David
[1:09:59] is that right but what they're looking
[1:10:01] for and you know you can't really blame
[1:10:04] them because they would take the
[1:10:06] prophet's quotes of the Old Testament
[1:10:07] they would take Genesis 3 15 they would
[1:10:10] take haggai 2 7 Zechariah 14 7 they
[1:10:13] would take Zephaniah they would take you
[1:10:15] know so many of those things and they
[1:10:17] would put them together and you can see
[1:10:19] why they were looking for a mighty king
[1:10:21] So when he was born a poor baby born
[1:10:24] wrapped in Swan and clothed and laid in
[1:10:26] a Manger there's no way that fit with
[1:10:28] their idea there's no way that fit was
[1:10:30] what they had always been taught they're
[1:10:32] looking for a son of David to come
[1:10:34] riding on a big white horse and he's
[1:10:36] going to knock down all Rome and he's
[1:10:38] going to give Israel back their Homeland
[1:10:41] and the Romans are going to die and here
[1:10:43] he comes pushed from Pillar To Post a
[1:10:46] weak looking sword of a guy this is what
[1:10:48] caused John the Baptist to doubt John
[1:10:50] introduced him he said he's coming and
[1:10:52] he's going to have a my big flame in his
[1:10:55] hand a fan and he's going to Fan down
[1:10:57] through there and the chaff is going to
[1:10:59] come blowing away where's John where's
[1:11:01] John quoting from the scripture we just
[1:11:03] read in the Book of Daniel so John said
[1:11:05] boy when he comes I'm telling you what
[1:11:07] everybody better get out of his way and
[1:11:09] when he comes they push him over this
[1:11:11] way and they push him over that way and
[1:11:14] he stands up there my was humble and
[1:11:17] poor and didn't have no Kingdom didn't
[1:11:19] have no horses didn't have no soldiers
[1:11:22] and his army was fishermen ignorant and
[1:11:25] unlearned couldn't even sign their own
[1:11:26] name and John the Baptist sent some of
[1:11:29] his followers and said ask him if he's
[1:11:32] the one
[1:11:33] or have I messed up
[1:11:35] should we look for another you imagine
[1:11:37] the man who introduced him now Lord
[1:11:40] willing we'll get to that Lord will
[1:11:41] maybe on Sunday morning but John
[1:11:43] actually had a breakdown inside the
[1:11:45] prison and John is looking at what looks
[1:11:48] like reality to him and it does not look
[1:11:50] like the Lord Jesus is this Messianic
[1:11:53] prophecy he just can't believe that
[1:11:55] that's him so Jesus said hang around for
[1:11:58] a while and go back and tell John what
[1:12:00] you saw once you notice he didn't say
[1:12:02] we're polishing our swords we're getting
[1:12:04] our helmets ready we're getting all of
[1:12:06] our Shields ready but he said tell him
[1:12:08] what you saw the blind see and the lame
[1:12:11] are walking and the poor have the gospel
[1:12:14] preached to them so you imagine whenever
[1:12:16] he comes back then it hits John oh I see
[1:12:20] I had the dispensation Place wrong I was
[1:12:23] taking the scriptures of Daniel 2 and
[1:12:25] Daniel 7 and I was supplying the stone
[1:12:28] Kingdom when it was not the stone
[1:12:30] Kingdom it's the spirit indwelling
[1:12:33] kingdom That's Where It's At oh okay I
[1:12:35] see it now so John could go right on and
[1:12:38] let them chop his head off and knew that
[1:12:40] he had introduced the Messiah at the
[1:12:43] right time you see God's dispensations
[1:12:45] aren't always visible to the unlearning
[1:12:48] they're not always visible to the carnal
[1:12:51] mind of man and this is why it takes
[1:12:53] Revelation and the church said
[1:12:56] now watch in the days of those kings the
[1:13:00] god of heaven will set up a kingdom in
[1:13:04] the days of those kings the particular
[1:13:06] Prophecy of the kings of Daniel chapter
[1:13:09] 2. now this of course was not in the
[1:13:12] Advent of Our Lord at his first coming
[1:13:14] which shall never be destroyed and the
[1:13:17] kingdom shall not be left to other
[1:13:20] people now what Daniel is unfolding into
[1:13:23] King Nebuchadnezzar coming on to the
[1:13:25] Book of Daniel here is that it came from
[1:13:27] the Babylonians and it's going to go to
[1:13:29] the means of Persians then it'll go to
[1:13:31] the Greeks and then it'll go to the
[1:13:33] Romans so what's it doing it's going
[1:13:34] from one people to another people to
[1:13:37] another people but Daniel sees him this
[1:13:40] Vision when this kingdom comes it will
[1:13:43] not be turned over from the people of
[1:13:45] Christ to somebody else and then
[1:13:48] somebody else and then somebody else but
[1:13:50] once Christ ever gets this Stone Kingdom
[1:13:53] it will never be turned over to anybody
[1:13:56] else
[1:13:57] it'll be his and his only from that time
[1:14:00] so that's who you're serving tonight
[1:14:03] notice in the Kingdom shall not be left
[1:14:05] to other people but it shall break in
[1:14:08] pieces and consume all those kingdoms
[1:14:12] and it shall stand forever so other
[1:14:15] kingdoms were raised by what human
[1:14:18] Ambitions human Ambitions so one king
[1:14:21] would get this ideology about himself he
[1:14:24] was the greatest king of kings and all
[1:14:27] my he was the great this and that and
[1:14:29] the other and it would go from one man
[1:14:31] to another man a man with an ambition a
[1:14:34] man with an ideology that he was
[1:14:36] supposed to do this and that and the
[1:14:38] other but the kingdom of God is Not
[1:14:40] established any such way now what's
[1:14:42] really sad is is when you see preachers
[1:14:44] that get inside and in and around this
[1:14:47] kingdom of God and they go to bring in
[1:14:49] the mannerisms of the old Gentile World
[1:14:51] Order kingdoms and they think God is
[1:14:54] looking for men who have ambition no God
[1:14:57] is looking for men who will lose their
[1:14:59] own ambition and tie in with the
[1:15:02] ambition of God what I've always wanted
[1:15:04] to be this and I've always wanted to be
[1:15:06] that well more than likely God will
[1:15:08] never use nothing you always wanted to
[1:15:10] be God will get rid of that and make you
[1:15:13] what he wants you to be well praise the
[1:15:15] Lord but you see what many people do
[1:15:18] they fall right in the way of the
[1:15:20] Gentile Kings before them and they
[1:15:22] fulfilled the repeat of what Daniel saw
[1:15:25] and they bring it into every move of God
[1:15:27] that's been down through the church ages
[1:15:29] I hate to say it but it's right around
[1:15:31] our message as well you take a man with
[1:15:33] an ego a man that wants to be a big this
[1:15:36] and that and the other and you watch
[1:15:37] trouble will find him he'll split he'll
[1:15:40] Splinter he'll divide he's got this ego
[1:15:43] he's got this thing although don't get
[1:15:45] quiet on me gone ain't looking for for
[1:15:48] song leaders and for musicians and
[1:15:50] singers that's got this great ego about
[1:15:52] themselves God wants people to say Lord
[1:15:55] I can't do it Lord I don't know what to
[1:15:57] say I ain't no speaker Lord I ain't no
[1:16:00] great singer Lord I'm not a great
[1:16:01] Mission musician if you can use me use
[1:16:04] me Lord but I can't do nothing on my own
[1:16:08] oh but be afraid to then hang glory to
[1:16:10] God let me edit here hey yeah we're not
[1:16:13] voting on something we're not auctioning
[1:16:15] something all we're looking for people
[1:16:17] who want to die to their own ideas their
[1:16:20] own agendas their own motives and become
[1:16:22] part of the greatest Kingdom that ever
[1:16:25] will be on the face of the Earth
[1:16:28] now notice so it will not be left to
[1:16:31] other people so we are the finale of all
[1:16:34] the kingdoms of the world notice in
[1:16:35] verse 45 for as much as thou sawest that
[1:16:38] the stone was cut out of the mountain
[1:16:41] without hand so there was no hands that
[1:16:44] was in here so it wasn't like that the
[1:16:46] people cut it out and the denominations
[1:16:48] cut it out and the systems cut it out
[1:16:51] and with these overseers and this bishop
[1:16:53] and this and that and the other no it
[1:16:55] was not cut out by men let me tell you
[1:16:57] some friend if our church is made by man
[1:17:00] it'll only be a matter of time it will
[1:17:03] collapse any church that is started
[1:17:06] because a man has an ambition it may go
[1:17:09] five years it may go ten but it will run
[1:17:12] its course because God's true church is
[1:17:15] not started by any man the way I look at
[1:17:18] it years and years and years ago before
[1:17:20] you all ever knew me and before I ever
[1:17:22] knew you whenever this church had its
[1:17:24] original Roots over on Roan Hill some of
[1:17:27] you all were there I wasn't and that was
[1:17:29] not them people that wanted to start
[1:17:31] that church I believe it was God that
[1:17:33] led them to start that church then when
[1:17:35] it moved over to Happy Valley changed
[1:17:37] the name and took on a different look in
[1:17:39] a different building and the ministry
[1:17:40] changed down through the years I don't
[1:17:42] think it was them people that wanted to
[1:17:44] do that I believe it was the Lord that
[1:17:46] did it so you see when Satan attacks a
[1:17:49] church that God himself set up then the
[1:17:52] people ain't really attacking you
[1:17:53] they're not attacking me they're
[1:17:55] attacking God himself now there's a
[1:17:58] difference in God starting a church in
[1:18:00] men starting a church and there ain't no
[1:18:02] question about it a lot of men down
[1:18:04] Through the Ages and started churches
[1:18:06] but the Bible tells me except the Lord
[1:18:09] built the house those who build it labor
[1:18:12] in vain so myself I ain't looking for a
[1:18:15] man-made church I ain't looking for a
[1:18:17] man-made system I want a God made church
[1:18:20] I want a God made Mountain that I can
[1:18:23] run to and oh I wish somebody would
[1:18:25] preach with me tonight I want to be able
[1:18:27] to confide and something that is
[1:18:29] stronger than that the strongest
[1:18:31] preacher in this message the man with
[1:18:33] the greatest gifts the man who has the
[1:18:36] greatest ability to speak I still don't
[1:18:38] want to tie my soul to any human being
[1:18:41] all men will let you down all men will
[1:18:45] disappoint you there's only one place
[1:18:47] that you can put your ultimate
[1:18:49] confidence and that's in the rock of our
[1:18:52] Salvation the Lord Jesus not done here
[1:18:55] Reagan not some other man
[1:18:59] the stone was cut out of the mountain
[1:19:01] without hands and that it breaking
[1:19:04] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[1:19:06] silver and the gold the great God has
[1:19:10] made known to the king what shall come
[1:19:12] to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[1:19:15] certain and the interpretation sure now
[1:19:18] notice again Daniel 7 13. and I saw in
[1:19:21] the night visions and behold one like
[1:19:25] the son of man now watch this the son of
[1:19:29] man you can imagine what the Jews when
[1:19:32] they hear the Lord Jesus use this term
[1:19:35] when he comes to the Earth
[1:19:38] it ain't no wonder they got so mad
[1:19:41] now this is a common term to us son of
[1:19:44] man we've heard it for years but can you
[1:19:47] imagine being a Jew
[1:19:49] you only knew that reference was used in
[1:19:52] Daniel and in Ezekiel and a few of the
[1:19:56] prophets and here stands this man with
[1:19:59] an illegitimate birth supposedly
[1:20:01] a poor
[1:20:04] no schooling no education
[1:20:07] and he stands up and calls himself
[1:20:11] the son of man
[1:20:14] you imagine them looking at him with
[1:20:17] anger and Furious son of man
[1:20:21] who does he think he is
[1:20:24] that was referred to Daniel and Ezekiel
[1:20:27] the son of man the son of man was the
[1:20:31] one that stood by the most high God
[1:20:34] who does this man think he is
[1:20:37] it wasn't who he was thinking he was
[1:20:39] it's who he knew he was
[1:20:43] now watch Daniel sees the merging
[1:20:46] together
[1:20:47] of his Humanity
[1:20:49] and his divinity
[1:20:52] what's the terms that he uses one like
[1:20:55] the son of man now here's his Humanity
[1:20:59] the word son in the Hebrew is been
[1:21:03] so b-e-n so it would be so and so the
[1:21:07] bin of Donnie or so and so the bin of
[1:21:11] John which was son of
[1:21:14] so this name identified the Tabernacle
[1:21:18] of God
[1:21:20] as the son of man isn't it amazing the
[1:21:23] son of man
[1:21:25] so he takes upon himself this title the
[1:21:29] son of man
[1:21:31] oh God help us
[1:21:33] but notice word Daniel sees him
[1:21:37] the son of man came with clouds of
[1:21:40] heaven and came
[1:21:42] to the Ancient of Days
[1:21:46] so he sees the visible appearance of
[1:21:50] what it looks like a human being
[1:21:53] surrounded in clouds
[1:21:56] and then this human being surrounded in
[1:21:59] clouds goes and walks into the presence
[1:22:02] of the mighty Elohim
[1:22:05] the Eternal himself
[1:22:08] and Daniel says how can that be a man
[1:22:12] ever to walk into the presence of the
[1:22:15] Mighty God
[1:22:17] so Daniel's looking and he sees the
[1:22:19] merging together of his humanity and his
[1:22:22] deity
[1:22:23] and he came to the Ancient of Days and
[1:22:27] they brought him near so here comes the
[1:22:29] cherubims and the seraphims
[1:22:32] and who are they they are the ones who
[1:22:34] stopped the approach remember God
[1:22:37] telling Lucifer that thou art the
[1:22:40] anointed cherub and I have set thee soul
[1:22:44] the anointed cherub was the one who
[1:22:47] stopped the approach
[1:22:49] Lucifer in heaven was God's right-hand
[1:22:52] man
[1:22:53] any other angels of lower degree that
[1:22:57] approached the Throne of Elohim Lucifer
[1:23:00] would have walked up before them before
[1:23:03] he fell
[1:23:04] and he would have stopped them because
[1:23:06] he stopped the approach
[1:23:10] and if Elohim allowed the angels to come
[1:23:13] they came through the gate or the
[1:23:16] entrance
[1:23:17] of Lucifer
[1:23:19] he had a great position
[1:23:22] but in his pride he got lifted up
[1:23:25] because he felt like he could do a whole
[1:23:27] lot more than what God was letting him
[1:23:29] do oh boy
[1:23:32] and here Daniel sees this son of man
[1:23:35] doesn't know him by name now he never
[1:23:37] was allowed to mention the name of Jesus
[1:23:39] but he sees him as a son of man and he
[1:23:43] sees as he approaches and then someone
[1:23:46] Angelic beings come and get this what
[1:23:49] looks like a human just a mere human and
[1:23:52] Daniel Sanders said how can this be a
[1:23:55] mortal and he's surrounded by clowns
[1:23:58] Heavenly Witnesses and he comes up to
[1:24:00] the approach of the Ancient of Days and
[1:24:03] the cherubims and the seraphims and the
[1:24:05] zooms and they come and they meet him at
[1:24:08] the gate
[1:24:10] and they take him into the presence
[1:24:13] of the Ancient of Days and they brought
[1:24:15] him near
[1:24:16] before him so his Humanity being the son
[1:24:20] of man his deity being declared by the
[1:24:24] way he traveled
[1:24:26] Hallelujah
[1:24:27] his Humanity was the title of son of man
[1:24:31] but his divinity was revealed by the way
[1:24:35] he traveled
[1:24:37] so will yours be after a while
[1:24:41] they see millions of people have died
[1:24:44] billions of them down through time and
[1:24:46] they've left the Earth by the channel of
[1:24:48] deaths but one thing that separates the
[1:24:51] seed of God from the rest of other human
[1:24:53] beings is the means that they travel you
[1:24:57] see they don't go to paradise they do
[1:25:01] not go to Shield they go into that sixth
[1:25:04] Dimension and there they wait they go
[1:25:06] into a theophany body so it identifies
[1:25:10] they also are from deity hope you
[1:25:13] understand it tonight there's a part of
[1:25:15] you that's just as human as it can be we
[1:25:16] all can say Amen to that can't we but if
[1:25:19] you're born again tonight of the Holy
[1:25:21] Ghost there is a part of deity that
[1:25:24] lives inside of you and I
[1:25:27] it ain't the deity that causes our
[1:25:29] problems it ain't the deity that causes
[1:25:31] our difficulties somebody say Amen it is
[1:25:34] our Humanity it is our old flesh it is
[1:25:37] our old human Spirit oh my but one of
[1:25:40] these days I will be identified who I
[1:25:43] truly am it'll be by the way I travel by
[1:25:47] the way I travel amen hallelujah for
[1:25:51] what did Paul say that by by the grace
[1:25:53] of God we shall not all sleep but we
[1:25:56] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[1:25:59] twinkling of an eye for the dead and
[1:26:01] cross shall rise first and we which are
[1:26:03] alive and remain shall be changed and we
[1:26:06] are going to be caught up you'll be
[1:26:08] known by the way you travel you won't
[1:26:11] have to have a plane ticket you won't
[1:26:13] have to have a space shuttle ticket
[1:26:15] you'll be known by your true identity
[1:26:18] that you are part of deity you are going
[1:26:22] to travel the way he travels
[1:26:25] you are sons of men and Daughters of men
[1:26:28] but one day you're going to be
[1:26:31] identified in the clouds hallelujah
[1:26:34] hallelujah will be identified by our
[1:26:37] theophany body
[1:26:43] you see John seeing the same thing
[1:26:48] whenever he sees him in Revelation 1 8.
[1:26:51] but here Daniel sees him veiled not in
[1:26:55] Thunder heads
[1:26:57] not in wispy white clouds
[1:27:01] but in Shekinah or the Hebrew word
[1:27:04] shakanai
[1:27:05] he sees him surrounded
[1:27:08] by the Shekinah of God
[1:27:12] and he thinks How can any man
[1:27:15] ever be surrounded by the Shekinah Glory
[1:27:19] of God
[1:27:23] if we can look beyond our Veil tonight
[1:27:26] if a person that's in this building
[1:27:27] filled with the Holy Ghost you've
[1:27:30] already got a part of that Shekinah
[1:27:31] yourself
[1:27:34] is that right
[1:27:36] oh my
[1:27:37] God you see our lord Jesus used this
[1:27:40] term when he came to the Earth
[1:27:43] 82
[1:27:45] times
[1:27:47] in the four Gospels
[1:27:51] 82 times
[1:27:53] apparently he wanted somebody to know
[1:27:57] who he was
[1:27:59] well I'm glad I'm one of them somebodies
[1:28:04] now he could have called himself so many
[1:28:06] things and yet he chose knows to prevent
[1:28:09] himself a son of man of course we
[1:28:10] realize that the the appearance of him
[1:28:12] and the last States Luke 17 30 is what
[1:28:15] causes such confusion again because
[1:28:17] people take the same title and they
[1:28:20] think it applies to the Lord Jesus in
[1:28:22] the reappearing of his own Corporal body
[1:28:24] but the revealing of the son of man of
[1:28:27] Luke 17 30 is not the second coming in
[1:28:30] his Corporal body it's his second coming
[1:28:33] and the revealing of the son of man
[1:28:36] not his Corporal body when that comes
[1:28:38] that will be the Rapture praise the Lord
[1:28:41] but truly as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:28:44] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[1:28:46] of man is being revealed is that right
[1:28:49] and then of course in verse 30 tells us
[1:28:51] all of that and then he reminds us down
[1:28:53] below there remember Lot's wife it was
[1:28:56] in the revealing of the son of man when
[1:28:58] he made himself known to Abraham and lot
[1:29:01] and his wife left the message they left
[1:29:04] the message and went to Sodom isn't it
[1:29:07] amazing Jesus never did save remember
[1:29:09] Abraham's wife remember Jacob's wife
[1:29:12] remember Isaac's wife remember Joseph's
[1:29:15] wife but why did he say remember Lot's
[1:29:18] wife it was a sign in the last days look
[1:29:22] around we are saying mister and miss a
[1:29:24] lot pulling away from the message of the
[1:29:26] hour and what's he saying to us remember
[1:29:29] lot's why why he don't want you to be
[1:29:32] identified with that he don't want me to
[1:29:34] be identified with that but what what
[1:29:36] are we doing we're staying right there
[1:29:38] Hallelujah what's the original message
[1:29:40] of the hour we are not leaving our Oak
[1:29:44] Tree in the plains of memory we are
[1:29:46] there waiting on God oh it may get hot
[1:29:49] it may get dry there may be tests and
[1:29:52] there may be trials but I'd rather have
[1:29:54] a hot day in the plains of sheikim than
[1:29:57] I would living down there in the
[1:29:58] well-watered plains of Jericho are
[1:30:01] living down there near the cities of
[1:30:03] Sodom and Gomorrah you can have Sodom
[1:30:05] you can have gamara Give Me Jesus you
[1:30:08] can have the world you can have Leia to
[1:30:11] see her give me Jesus if I've got to
[1:30:14] live up here under this oak tree I'll do
[1:30:16] it I'll do it let it get dry let it get
[1:30:19] hot let it get difficult but give me
[1:30:22] Jesus Give Me Jesus he's all I need
[1:30:33] watch the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24.
[1:30:36] 27.
[1:30:38] for as a lightning cometh out of the
[1:30:41] East
[1:30:44] and shine us even into the West
[1:30:51] come us out of the East
[1:30:55] and shine us
[1:30:57] even unto the West
[1:31:00] so shall also the coming
[1:31:03] of the son of man be
[1:31:07] so it will come from the East
[1:31:10] to the West
[1:31:12] and of course people have quoted this
[1:31:14] for years and years
[1:31:16] since he said it two thousand years ago
[1:31:19] and they're looking for this to be
[1:31:21] applied at his second bodily coming
[1:31:25] that's no son of man
[1:31:27] that's Crown King Son of God
[1:31:35] so the son of man coming can't you see
[1:31:37] why Satan wants to take you away from
[1:31:39] your inheritance
[1:31:40] he's trying to get you out of your
[1:31:42] inheritance what is our inheritance our
[1:31:45] promised land is the message of the hour
[1:31:48] feeding on Heavenly Manna baptized in
[1:31:51] the Holy Ghost by the spirit of God and
[1:31:54] how will he be identified by the way we
[1:31:56] travel so you see in the days of Luther
[1:31:59] this horse and buggy as it moved on up
[1:32:01] it moved beyond that and come on up to
[1:32:03] the airplane age but we're beyond the
[1:32:06] airplane now well you know the other day
[1:32:08] whenever the FAA one of our brothers
[1:32:10] told me here last night that he took him
[1:32:12] about 30 hours to travel from out in
[1:32:14] Tucson because the FAA had a glitch in
[1:32:16] their software well that's kind of the
[1:32:18] way it is whether all these churches
[1:32:19] around native they've got a glitch on
[1:32:22] their software well headquarters say we
[1:32:24] can't preach this no more and not no
[1:32:25] more I'm so glad I ain't got no software
[1:32:28] to get glitches because if you got it
[1:32:30] you no doubt we'll get glitches come on
[1:32:33] say Amen but I'm so glad that we are
[1:32:35] hooked up straight into heaven and we
[1:32:38] don't have to go through no Heavenly all
[1:32:40] glory no earthly headquarters but we've
[1:32:42] got a Heavenly tie and we ain't got some
[1:32:45] scientist sitting back somewhere to say
[1:32:47] you know well you can't say man or women
[1:32:49] no more we can
[1:32:51] I know a lot of them don't know what a
[1:32:53] man is and what a woman is they call it
[1:32:56] a it or a Shem or a Herm or whatever
[1:32:59] they call them but my Bible still
[1:33:01] identifies male and female well come on
[1:33:05] preach brother Donny I'm going to my
[1:33:08] Bible still identifies there is a church
[1:33:10] and there is a pride there is a first
[1:33:13] resurrection and there is a second
[1:33:15] Resurrection
[1:33:16] and you are going to be identified by
[1:33:19] which one you live in and which one you
[1:33:22] get up in
[1:33:25] okay
[1:33:30] notice Daniel 7 13.
[1:33:33] I saw in the night visions
[1:33:36] and behold one like the son of man came
[1:33:39] with the clouds of heaven and came to
[1:33:41] the Ancient of Days and they brought him
[1:33:46] they brought him
[1:33:52] near before him
[1:33:54] and there was given
[1:34:03] you see the trinitarians were wrong
[1:34:05] and the Jesus only were wrong too
[1:34:08] but the truth always lays in the middle
[1:34:10] of the road
[1:34:13] now I was trinitarian years ago
[1:34:15] and I came from that side of the ditch
[1:34:17] and I became a Jesus only
[1:34:21] now the sad thing about it is we have a
[1:34:23] lot of message folks that are Jesus only
[1:34:24] but because there never was in Pentecost
[1:34:27] they don't know what Jesus only is
[1:34:29] so when they hear you preach the
[1:34:31] Divinity of the Lord Jesus they're with
[1:34:33] you but it stumbles them when you
[1:34:34] preaches Humanity they cannot take him
[1:34:37] when you say sit down with a headache
[1:34:39] why they're Jesus only so I used to
[1:34:42] preach I used to believe Jesus was his
[1:34:44] own father I believe that Jesus was at
[1:34:46] all don't you come and tell me now then
[1:34:48] I remember it years and years ago Harry
[1:34:50] remembers the meeting where we was at
[1:34:51] and there's one of the brothers that we
[1:34:53] fellowship with and he began to see a
[1:34:55] little bit of light in this truth may be
[1:34:56] known he may have stumbled on it in the
[1:34:58] message because I found out a lot of the
[1:35:00] people I was preaching for they secretly
[1:35:02] was reading the message of the hour I'd
[1:35:04] hear him preach kinsman redeemer I'm
[1:35:06] hearing my my brother King a man down in
[1:35:08] Yeager West Virginia and I hear that man
[1:35:10] he'd preached about Ruth and he'd preach
[1:35:12] about Boaz and he'd preach about I'll
[1:35:14] say where in the world is that man
[1:35:16] getting that well I found out where he
[1:35:18] was getting it I found out with some of
[1:35:20] them guys that I was fellowshipping with
[1:35:22] God but you know what once they found
[1:35:24] out that I found out they didn't want
[1:35:26] nobody else to found out what I found
[1:35:28] out so they sure didn't want me telling
[1:35:30] where they got their resource well I'm
[1:35:33] the kind of man I want to let you know
[1:35:34] where I found this out I didn't find it
[1:35:37] out in any organized religion I didn't
[1:35:39] find it out for my daddy God bless him I
[1:35:41] didn't find it out for my uncle for my
[1:35:43] grandpa I found it out from the prophet
[1:35:46] that spoke of the Malachi 4 and I want
[1:35:49] to point you to that same way and you
[1:35:51] need to be feeding right there on that
[1:35:53] same message
[1:35:55] hmm
[1:35:59] so they bring the son of man
[1:36:02] to the Ancient of Days and then there's
[1:36:05] given him who the son of man
[1:36:10] now the millennium
[1:36:13] is the continuing
[1:36:15] of what God Said in the seventh day in
[1:36:18] the Garden of Eden
[1:36:21] Adam called God
[1:36:23] out of his Shabbat
[1:36:26] in the Garden of Eden
[1:36:28] and God put his millennium
[1:36:31] on hold
[1:36:34] so no individual has ever lived to be a
[1:36:37] thousand years old
[1:36:38] but they will in the millennium
[1:36:41] so the millennium is the old
[1:36:45] Sabbath
[1:36:47] the seventh day
[1:36:49] of the Old Testament
[1:36:51] now watch this and there was given him
[1:36:54] Dominion so who given who the son of man
[1:36:58] who is who the Lord Jesus
[1:37:02] um
[1:37:03] remember when Jesus stands and says
[1:37:05] after his resurrection
[1:37:08] all power
[1:37:10] has been given unto me
[1:37:14] show me where he says that before he
[1:37:16] dies
[1:37:21] you'd be better off to spend more time
[1:37:23] into the holy book instead of Facebook
[1:37:26] praise the lord well I just throw that
[1:37:28] in for good measure no charge
[1:37:31] you see he could not stand and say that
[1:37:34] until he had completed the atonement
[1:37:38] then all power in Heaven and Earth is
[1:37:42] given unto me
[1:37:44] now watch there was given him dominion
[1:37:47] and glory and a kingdom given to him how
[1:37:52] could you give something to someone who
[1:37:54] already has it
[1:37:56] what is this it's the sonship of God not
[1:38:00] another God not another person
[1:38:03] the same God in human form
[1:38:06] I said brother Dory that confuses me why
[1:38:08] why should it
[1:38:10] you've got a soul
[1:38:12] you've got a spirit you've got a body
[1:38:16] have you ever seen yourself
[1:38:19] anybody here ever seen your soul
[1:38:21] what about anybody else's soul
[1:38:23] have you ever seen your spirit
[1:38:26] have you ever seen anybody else's spirit
[1:38:28] what do you know most of your body
[1:38:32] right
[1:38:33] why is that confusing and yet you take
[1:38:36] my spirit out of my body my gray matter
[1:38:39] all that matter will still be in my
[1:38:41] brain I will not be able to reason I
[1:38:43] will not be able to think I will not be
[1:38:45] able to have a conscience why because my
[1:38:47] spirit contains those five inlets and it
[1:38:50] runs in on my brain matter runs in the
[1:38:52] cerebral the stem down through the back
[1:38:53] and all that it tells me what's to do so
[1:38:56] when a person goes out of their mind
[1:38:57] what do they lose part of that spirit I
[1:38:59] just want somebody this crazy age that
[1:39:01] we're living in they've gone out of
[1:39:02] their mind their spirit's all messed up
[1:39:05] well praise the Lord and yet whenever
[1:39:08] the Lord Jesus come to the Earth what
[1:39:10] was he he come from the heart of God I
[1:39:13] came forth from God and I go back to God
[1:39:17] so what was he he was that invisible
[1:39:20] part who is the father God the invisible
[1:39:22] God's not an old man sitting in heaven
[1:39:24] you don't find that in your Bible when
[1:39:26] John looked in the Book of Revelation he
[1:39:28] said I saw one and one Throne that
[1:39:31] wasn't a big throne and a big old man on
[1:39:33] it another little guy said over here and
[1:39:34] another little guy called the Holy Ghost
[1:39:36] over there if there's another God in
[1:39:37] Heaven Beside the Lord Jesus he's
[1:39:39] sitting on the floor because John only
[1:39:41] saw one Throne there ain't no big throne
[1:39:43] and no little Throne there's only one
[1:39:45] throne and he's the one sitting on it
[1:39:47] don't you understand in the Millennium
[1:39:49] he's given this Dominion don't shut us
[1:39:51] down also in Corinthians where he said
[1:39:53] when it's all said and done he will turn
[1:39:55] it all back over into that great
[1:39:57] invisible life that God may be all in
[1:40:00] all and there to be the Lord Jesus
[1:40:03] setting on the throne in the seventh day
[1:40:04] and and in the eighth day as well
[1:40:06] surrounded by what father God
[1:40:10] which has never been seen and never will
[1:40:13] be
[1:40:14] will be that's a direct quote
[1:40:19] and there was given him Dominion and
[1:40:22] Glory
[1:40:23] and their Kingdom
[1:40:27] that all people
[1:40:30] Nations
[1:40:32] and languages
[1:40:34] Shall Serve him
[1:40:37] his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[1:40:41] which shall not pass away and his
[1:40:44] kingdom that which shall not be
[1:40:47] destroyed
[1:40:49] so in the Millennium will be Nations
[1:40:52] and peoples
[1:40:54] Ethiopians
[1:40:56] Sioux Indians Cheyenne
[1:40:59] blackfeet Europeans
[1:41:03] black white red Chinese Japanese all
[1:41:07] kinds of nationalities
[1:41:09] in the millennium
[1:41:11] praise the Lord
[1:41:13] notice verse 25 and he shall speak great
[1:41:16] words now here we come back into the
[1:41:18] move of the Antichrist against the most
[1:41:20] high
[1:41:21] and shall wear out
[1:41:24] boy I can sure identify with this
[1:41:27] and shall wear out the Saints
[1:41:32] of the most high
[1:41:35] how many ever just gets wore out with
[1:41:37] life just things you deal with from day
[1:41:40] to day and it ain't like you're quick
[1:41:42] I'm I'm fixing the backslide oh I'm
[1:41:44] going back to the world oh a real child
[1:41:46] of God filled with the holy ghost thing
[1:41:48] going back to no world there ain't no
[1:41:50] world in them but they do get wore out
[1:41:52] they get worn out with struggling and
[1:41:55] they get wore out with sickness and
[1:41:56] disease and battles and one
[1:41:58] disappointment out of another but I want
[1:42:00] you to notice that Daniel never said
[1:42:02] that he ever got a one of them saints he
[1:42:04] just said he wears them out what I think
[1:42:06] of it ought to be the other day that we
[1:42:08] ought to wear him out too I'll tell one
[1:42:10] thing as long as I'm here on the earth I
[1:42:12] don't want the devil sitting down there

[1:43:16] hmm
[1:43:20] and shall wear out the Saints of the
[1:43:23] most high
[1:43:24] and think to change the times
[1:43:28] and laws
[1:43:30] and they shall be given unto his hand

[1:43:40] half years time singular times double oh
[1:43:43] my and then we come down to three and a
[1:43:46] half years
[1:43:48] but the Judgment shall sit
[1:43:52] oh
[1:43:55] and they
[1:43:57] shall take away
[1:43:59] his Dominion
[1:44:01] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[1:44:08] and they shall take away his Dominion to
[1:44:12] consume and to destroy it unto the end
[1:44:16] and the kingdom and dominion and the
[1:44:18] greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole
[1:44:21] heaven
[1:44:23] shall be given
[1:44:25] to the people

[1:45:07] the ones he's telling why you're
[1:45:09] worthless you're no good you've messed

[1:45:21] give you the very Kingdom you're married
[1:45:22] to me already an invisible Union but
[1:45:24] before long you're going to set with me
[1:45:26] on my Throne you and I was going to rule
[1:45:28] together oh
[1:45:31] Zechariah 6 12.
[1:45:33] speak unto them unto him rather saying
[1:45:37] thus Speak Us
[1:45:39] the Lord will hosts
[1:45:41] saying behold the man
[1:45:44] whose name
[1:45:46] is the branch
[1:45:50] he shall grow up out of his place
[1:45:53] and he shall build the temple
[1:45:56] of the Lord
[1:46:00] that's amazing to me when you look at
[1:46:01] the time frame how that God
[1:46:03] would sometimes have these prophecies
[1:46:06] it's Prophet sacchariah is one of them
[1:46:08] haggai too
[1:46:10] but God would hide
[1:46:12] things that they would say and they
[1:46:14] would prophesy about things that was
[1:46:16] going on right then current events
[1:46:19] and God would slip in a verse or a hifa
[1:46:23] verse right in with the current events
[1:46:25] that was going to be 4 000 years down
[1:46:28] the road
[1:46:29] and the devil Read it just like a
[1:46:31] newspaper went right over the top of it
[1:46:32] like a bunch of theologians did and this
[1:46:35] is one of them settings now remember
[1:46:36] this is in the days when they are
[1:46:38] rebuilding the temple this is one of the
[1:46:40] days whenever they're out there the
[1:46:41] temple so they're going to say well the
[1:46:43] man whose name is a branch of and who in
[1:46:44] the world was that who's he talking
[1:46:46] about Joshua who's he talking about and
[1:46:48] God slid another Messianic prophecy
[1:46:50] right in the middle of it that's the way
[1:46:52] he likes to do you sometimes he likes to
[1:46:54] set you right down in the middle of NAPA
[1:46:56] Auto Parts and give you a job right
[1:46:58] there in the middle of it and you turn
[1:46:59] that whole part store upside down God
[1:47:01] likes to put you in the or God likes to
[1:47:04] put you in an office somewhere and every
[1:47:05] time you come in and sit down on that
[1:47:07] long skirt and that long hair and then
[1:47:09] Bob heard painted face Jezebel sitting
[1:47:11] around they can't stand it they don't
[1:47:13] realize there's a walk and a pistol walk
[1:47:15] right in among them and you're sitting
[1:47:17] there just as happy as of being a bunch
[1:47:18] of honey and you're typing away glory to
[1:47:20] God he set me free yes he set me free
[1:47:23] you know they kind of Snicker at you
[1:47:25] when you get up and walk out but you
[1:47:26] know you're bearing the reproach for the
[1:47:28] word and you know Lord Jesus is on your
[1:47:31] side Why Should I Worry why should I
[1:47:34] fear the lord Jesus as God is out on you
[1:47:37] children you are the apple of his eye
[1:47:43] and God just slides it right in there
[1:47:46] so your Zechariah says the man whose
[1:47:50] name
[1:47:51] is the branch
[1:47:55] the people probably thought
[1:47:58] oh boy
[1:48:00] who ever heard of calling a man
[1:48:03] after a true branch
[1:48:06] these prophets are so weird they are so
[1:48:10] strange
[1:48:14] we are so blessed
[1:48:17] to be able to understand such strange
[1:48:19] things
[1:48:20] which must mean that we are strange also
[1:48:24] but the way we look at it we're looking
[1:48:26] back out from where we are and we're
[1:48:28] looking at others and saying what in the
[1:48:29] world is wrong with everybody else
[1:48:31] they're out of their mind and they're
[1:48:32] looking at us and say them people are
[1:48:35] crazy they are totally Looney Tunes they
[1:48:38] don't have a clue what in the world is
[1:48:39] going on you might be surprised we not
[1:48:42] only know what's going on we know what's
[1:48:44] going on before the foundation of the
[1:48:46] world we actually know a lot of things
[1:48:47] that's went on down through time and now
[1:48:49] further more than that we know what's
[1:48:51] fixing to take place and it might be
[1:48:54] right here tonight it might be in the
[1:48:55] morning but one of these days we may be
[1:48:57] sitting together on the house of God and
[1:48:58] it hits us and all of a sudden a 66 year
[1:49:01] old Pastor standing here and about like
[1:49:03] a boat to lightning strikes out of
[1:49:05] heaven and I turn to be an 18 year old
[1:49:07] man right in front of your eyes and you
[1:49:09] turn to be 18 years old right in front
[1:49:11] of my eyes and we know it ain't gonna be
[1:49:14] long we're fixing to be called up by the
[1:49:17] power of God why let them say what they
[1:49:19] want call us what they want to but one
[1:49:22] day call us gone come all is gone
[1:49:25] because you're going to be leaving this
[1:49:27] place
[1:49:32] so the man whose name is the branch
[1:49:36] so I guess it shouldn't seem unusual to
[1:49:38] us
[1:49:39] that when the man whose name was the
[1:49:40] branch
[1:49:41] come on the earth and he started saying
[1:49:44] I am the Vine
[1:49:47] and ye are the branches
[1:49:51] you imagine the polished theologians of
[1:49:53] that every other thing
[1:49:54] the poor guy
[1:49:56] I mean you can tell he's from Happy
[1:49:58] Valley
[1:50:00] you can tell the poor guys a Kentuckian
[1:50:02] I mean you know they're just kind of
[1:50:03] backwashed and ignorant and stuff like
[1:50:05] that he's from down in Nazareth and I
[1:50:08] mean who would call himself a Vine and
[1:50:12] and call his followers branches
[1:50:15] the Branchwood
[1:50:18] we consider the great honor to be called
[1:50:21] branches don't we I mean because after
[1:50:23] all the man whose name is the branch is
[1:50:26] calling me an offshoot of him
[1:50:29] oh maybe you don't want to be called
[1:50:31] that I couldn't be calling nothing
[1:50:32] better I'll tell you one thing my name
[1:50:35] will not be in lights well I guess this
[1:50:37] is about as bright as I'll ever get
[1:50:38] right here my name won't be on the
[1:50:40] Hollywood's Walk of Fame my name may not
[1:50:42] be here and there and I really don't
[1:50:44] care and I really don't want it to be
[1:50:46] but the man whose name is the branch
[1:50:48] calls me a branch so that means I'm an
[1:50:51] offshoot of the man himself I am the
[1:50:55] vine and ye are the branches and now he
[1:50:57] said I don't no longer bring forth the
[1:50:59] fruit but you all will so you'll go in
[1:51:02] my name and you'll cast out devils and
[1:51:04] you'll heal the sick and you'll lay your
[1:51:06] hands on them and demons will come out
[1:51:08] of them because it'll be me in you
[1:51:10] continuing my same work
[1:51:15] foreign
[1:51:18] notice this title of condescension
[1:51:22] the man whose name is the branch
[1:51:26] he shall grow
[1:51:30] wow
[1:51:32] as I said I keep repeating it but you
[1:51:34] can say by God has such a hard time
[1:51:36] dealing with human beings
[1:51:38] because they feel like they can't go no
[1:51:40] farther
[1:51:41] they've reached the Utopia
[1:51:45] they're the ultimate
[1:51:46] if they're Society creatures I mean they
[1:51:49] are the society Elite you know if
[1:51:51] they're this oh I can go no farther I
[1:51:53] can
[1:51:54] but even he himself grew Luke 2 52 Jesus
[1:52:00] grew in wisdom and understanding before
[1:52:03] God Amen
[1:52:06] how many wants to be like Jesus
[1:52:09] now notice the attribute that Zechariah
[1:52:12] attributes to it now remember the
[1:52:14] parallel of the time what's going on
[1:52:16] here temple building time Temple
[1:52:19] dedication time
[1:52:21] and your Zechariah just speaks the word
[1:52:24] of the Lord and said now there's come in
[1:52:25] a man whose name is going to be the
[1:52:27] branch
[1:52:28] and he shall build
[1:52:31] the temple
[1:52:32] of the Lord
[1:52:36] so the thing was that Joshua and
[1:52:38] remember there was a Joshua doing this
[1:52:39] time for him not to Joshua and the days
[1:52:41] of Moses but this Joshua and that was
[1:52:43] also the high priest he was the one that
[1:52:44] had on the dirty garments and the angel
[1:52:45] of the Lord come and told him to to make
[1:52:47] him claim so God slid this prophecy
[1:52:50] right inside of there you can see why
[1:52:52] this sometimes people try to study the
[1:52:54] message of them and they totally Miss
[1:52:56] prophetic words and they say oh he left
[1:52:59] out a man here and he said this over
[1:53:00] there they don't even understand
[1:53:03] fall now you ever read the prophecy
[1:53:06] there in Isaiah whenever he talks about
[1:53:08] the mountain of the Lord and then you
[1:53:09] turn over to Micah chapter 4 verse 1 and
[1:53:12] read verses one two and three a lot of
[1:53:15] these people in the day we're living it
[1:53:16] would have considered them to be
[1:53:18] pleasuring one another's words
[1:53:21] because they were almost identical
[1:53:23] except when you come down to verse three
[1:53:24] so I guess they'd say that either Micah
[1:53:27] plagiarize Isaiah or Isaiah plagiarize
[1:53:29] Micah because they said the same thing
[1:53:31] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:36] you see cerebral
[1:53:38] is now the builder of the temple and the
[1:53:41] temple building is going on and God just
[1:53:43] slides this prophetic word right in the
[1:53:45] middle of and they said the man's name
[1:53:47] he said branch is that zeruble is he the
[1:53:49] one he's talking about
[1:53:52] he's not going to build a house
[1:53:56] Made of Stone
[1:53:58] sheetrock
[1:54:00] but he's going to build a body
[1:54:04] he will build a temple
[1:54:06] of the Lord
[1:54:09] praise God aren't you glad we're part of
[1:54:11] it
[1:54:14] as we started building this structure
[1:54:17] several years ago two years ago I guess
[1:54:18] it was
[1:54:20] planned on it for two years before that
[1:54:23] and especially when we got into the
[1:54:25] sanctuary part and we needed people that
[1:54:27] could do this and do that and lay carpet
[1:54:29] and stain and build and you know build
[1:54:31] this beautiful piece of furniture
[1:54:33] brother John did that and brother Dave
[1:54:34] laid Stone you know and my brother
[1:54:36] Scotty and brother Dave Hunt run miles
[1:54:38] hundreds and hundreds of feet of wire
[1:54:40] all above your heads and everywhere
[1:54:42] seemed like every person every job you
[1:54:44] needed there was somebody there to be
[1:54:46] able to do it
[1:54:48] and that's the way it is in the body of
[1:54:50] God when we find our place and we'll all
[1:54:53] be synchronized together now cervable
[1:54:55] could not build a temple like this
[1:54:56] Solomon could not build a temple like
[1:54:58] this hold tight brother Branham could
[1:55:00] not build a temple like this Paul could
[1:55:02] not build it only the man whose name was
[1:55:05] the branch
[1:55:06] could build this house of God
[1:55:09] oh don't you love him you see the Divine
[1:55:12] architect who made such a beautiful
[1:55:15] world also had in his mind another
[1:55:18] Temple which would be the house of God
[1:55:21] and he planned this Divine structure
[1:55:24] himself so everything is specified and
[1:55:28] pre-ordained and remember as it was in
[1:55:31] the days of Solomon that they took and
[1:55:33] they used The Cedars of Lebanon and they
[1:55:36] would get Craftsman from Tyree and they
[1:55:39] would get Craftsmen from different parts
[1:55:40] of the world and they hewed these stones
[1:55:42] out of the queries they're in different
[1:55:45] parts of the world and they brought them
[1:55:47] there to the Mount Moriah where Abraham
[1:55:49] was going to offer his son and there
[1:55:51] wasn't even the sound of a hammer
[1:55:55] in that building
[1:55:59] some of you come over here whenever this
[1:56:01] place was in the construction stage
[1:56:04] some days we couldn't even talk to one
[1:56:06] another yeah I want to use I would have
[1:56:09] to holler so much noise going on nail
[1:56:12] guns you know the Hammers I'm air
[1:56:15] compressors this going on that going on
[1:56:17] but can you imagine the house that
[1:56:19] Solomon built every stone was pre-cut
[1:56:26] some of this trim and some of this stuff
[1:56:27] here these brothers would go to the saw
[1:56:29] and cut it cut it long of course a good
[1:56:31] Trend man does and then he'd come back
[1:56:33] take a sixteenth off take another 16th
[1:56:35] off take an eight thought why because
[1:56:37] you want it too short you got a big long
[1:56:38] piece you'll ruin that thing if you take
[1:56:39] too much off at one time don't you know
[1:56:41] that's what God's doing to us we're
[1:56:43] saying well why don't he get that great
[1:56:44] big Sledgehammer just knock everything
[1:56:46] off if he did that to us it'd scare us
[1:56:48] to death
[1:56:49] some of us spiritually is about the size
[1:56:51] of that piano and when God gets done
[1:56:53] whether it's going to be about like this
[1:56:54] right here you can imagine if God took a
[1:56:56] sledgehammer and knocked you down that
[1:56:58] big of the Lord have mercy oh God don't
[1:57:00] don't fill all that of me away you're
[1:57:01] showing away my best Forest he said that
[1:57:03] ain't nothing but junk son That Ain't
[1:57:05] Nothing But Trash ain't never gonna
[1:57:06] weigh you down I'm Gonna Get You Down
[1:57:08] Under the right side you say you mean
[1:57:10] mother don't need the Lord may make me
[1:57:12] that small that's a great blessing if if
[1:57:15] you're made that small that means you're
[1:57:17] the only one that can fit that certain
[1:57:19] pot nobody else can take your place I I
[1:57:22] don't want to be jealous of preachers
[1:57:24] I've never been gentle so preacher I'm
[1:57:26] not a great preacher I know that I'll
[1:57:27] never will be too old for that but
[1:57:29] now but you know what there ain't a man
[1:57:31] in this message that can take my place
[1:57:33] they're in a singer in this message that
[1:57:35] can take your place and don't you come
[1:57:37] here and say well nobody knows me I'm
[1:57:39] not media if God placed you in our
[1:57:41] assembly you are needed and nobody can
[1:57:44] take your place you need to assume that
[1:57:46] responsibility say Lord I'm gonna be
[1:57:48] there every time I can
[1:57:51] [Applause]
[1:57:53] oh
[1:57:55] you see what he does
[1:57:57] he collects the material
[1:57:59] he'll take a Rahab
[1:58:02] or tomorrow
[1:58:04] he'll take a Bathsheba
[1:58:06] he'll take a ruse
[1:58:08] he'll take an eve a Mary a Sarah a
[1:58:12] Rebecca
[1:58:13] Hallelujah he'll put him together you
[1:58:16] make one an evangelist fiery evangelist
[1:58:18] not brother Daryl he'll make another
[1:58:20] evangelist like brother John and brother
[1:58:22] Johnson coming up here and brother Joel
[1:58:24] Brown different ministers around the
[1:58:25] world that he's made called them in
[1:58:27] different ways give them diversities of
[1:58:29] give set them inside the body they just
[1:58:31] find that spot and be what God wants
[1:58:33] them to be don't be jealous of one
[1:58:34] another well I don't get to appreciable
[1:58:37] once every now and then well maybe he'll
[1:58:38] once every now and then pressure
[1:58:40] that ain't everybody in our brother that
[1:58:42] can preach three times a week let me
[1:58:43] tell you that right now and then
[1:58:45] everybody just called to be a convention
[1:58:46] speaker and some that Don't Preach
[1:58:48] convincing so jealous of those who are
[1:58:50] you ought to walk in that man's shoes
[1:58:51] and feel the burden that he feels and
[1:58:53] not change your desire to want to preach
[1:58:54] a convention but we can only be what God
[1:58:57] has made us
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:01] you see these Stones right here these
[1:59:03] Stones right here
[1:59:05] a great Craftsman laid to him a man
[1:59:08] right there
[1:59:10] every Mason has his own style
[1:59:13] I started laying this one over here I
[1:59:15] said well Dave I'm not sure I'm gonna be
[1:59:17] able to finish it he said brother it'll
[1:59:19] be right there waiting on you I ain't
[1:59:21] finishing it
[1:59:22] you know why every Craftsman ever Mason
[1:59:24] has his own style and if you had an eye
[1:59:27] for masonry you would see where brother
[1:59:29] Dave stopped and where I started unless
[1:59:32] he mimics my style or I mimic his
[1:59:35] so brother Dave started this he finished
[1:59:38] it brother Dave started that he finished
[1:59:40] it I started that I finished it
[1:59:43] the Lord Jesus started you
[1:59:46] he's going to finish him the Lord Jesus
[1:59:49] started his church he's going to finish
[1:59:52] it it ain't going to him started me
[1:59:54] finishing this man no sir and the devil
[1:59:57] is not going to destroy it my machine
[2:00:00] set right there for days on end full of
[2:00:03] stone full of maul of my two but I
[2:00:06] couldn't come back because I had to do
[2:00:07] pastoral Duty really I am passed on
[2:00:10] because I'm laying Stones too and that
[2:00:12] they would not touch I said Cornell no I
[2:00:14] ain't doing that that's yours well
[2:00:16] that's the way it is with our working
[2:00:17] god brother Daryl can't take my place I
[2:00:20] can't take his you can't take somebody
[2:00:22] else's and nobody else can take yours
[2:00:25] that there's people better than me oh
[2:00:27] yeah I understand I'll say the same
[2:00:28] thing even if they are better the Lord
[2:00:30] God ordained me to fit that certain spot
[2:00:33] there ain't another Stone out there in
[2:00:35] the world that can take my place or
[2:00:37] yours
[2:00:42] foreign
[2:00:46] so the Lord God collects his material
[2:00:51] he won't buy some Honky Tonks
[2:00:55] you walk by some cold denominational
[2:00:58] churches
[2:01:01] you walk by some pig pens
[2:01:03] he won't buy all kinds of things
[2:01:06] collecting material
[2:01:08] praise God
[2:01:11] what by one damn found a little boy
[2:01:15] packing water
[2:01:16] to a moonshine still
[2:01:21] and the Lord said it's time to wake him
[2:01:23] up of a deposit
[2:01:25] I've got to work for him
[2:01:27] so he appears on the top of that tree
[2:01:29] and that little boy drops that bucket of
[2:01:32] water and heads out they're scared to
[2:01:33] death what's God doing getting ready to
[2:01:36] collect the material
[2:01:37] you see God may take a Mighty Man a
[2:01:40] great prophet of God and use him to
[2:01:42] reach the entire world and him influence
[2:01:44] millions of people's lives and God may
[2:01:48] take one of you
[2:01:49] and you'll lead one to the Lord it may
[2:01:52] be your son or your daughter and you
[2:01:55] think I've never done anything for God
[2:01:56] what
[2:01:57] that one's soul is worth millions of
[2:02:00] Worlds don't you never say you've never
[2:02:02] done nothing for God you household
[2:02:04] saying well I ain't no preacher I ain't
[2:02:06] never prophesied I ain't never done
[2:02:07] nothing like that but you've been a good
[2:02:09] wife haven't you you've been a good
[2:02:11] mother you've well brother Donnie I made
[2:02:13] mistakes sure like all the rest of us
[2:02:15] half that you serve God with all of your
[2:02:17] heart you'd be a good housewife you'll
[2:02:20] be a good mother you'll be a good
[2:02:21] preacher's wife whatever it is and I'll
[2:02:23] tell you one thing when that preacher
[2:02:25] stands before the Lord God that day
[2:02:27] you'll stand right there with him and
[2:02:29] all the world the saints of God will
[2:02:31] bear witness that you've stood with that
[2:02:34] servant of God
[2:02:36] oh
[2:02:38] oh children notice this and God's
[2:02:41] provided place of worship for prophet
[2:02:43] speaking about this living stones
[2:02:47] a new creation
[2:02:48] not to a denomination but to the word
[2:02:51] your creation of the word because the
[2:02:54] foundation stone
[2:02:57] was laid in you
[2:02:59] before the foundation of the world
[2:03:03] predestinated to be Sons and Daughters
[2:03:06] of God and upon this comes Stone upon
[2:03:09] Stone
[2:03:11] any change
[2:03:13] I've stood there at the Pyramids of Giza
[2:03:17] I've stood at the step pyramid
[2:03:19] I've stood at those pyramids of Egypt
[2:03:22] and they stand there and you look at
[2:03:24] those massive stones and think how did
[2:03:26] they do it
[2:03:28] how did they do it and of course what we
[2:03:30] see now is a far cry from what it was
[2:03:32] because they said it was actually
[2:03:33] covered in a white limestone
[2:03:36] so the whole outside was slick and
[2:03:39] Polished white limestone
[2:03:42] and that that sun shining down on that
[2:03:45] it must have been absolutely incredible
[2:03:48] it still is to this day when you walk up
[2:03:51] and see such a thing
[2:03:53] but I'll tell you one thing I'm looking
[2:03:55] tonight it's something that's even more
[2:03:57] incredible
[2:03:58] oh it's amazing to stand there as I told
[2:04:00] you a few years ago whenever Carol and I
[2:04:02] stood there in Jerusalem and see some of
[2:04:04] those stones and I just saw a video the
[2:04:05] other day of another one where they'd
[2:04:07] found and that dug that thing down one
[2:04:09] stone 40 feet long brother Jerry one
[2:04:13] stone hewn out around Jerusalem there
[2:04:15] somewhere and they took some type of
[2:04:17] chisels or something and cut like a
[2:04:20] Roman OG sign in that stone all the way
[2:04:22] around four inch perimeter on the top
[2:04:25] and the sides and the bottom and you've
[2:04:28] got that thing about seven feet tall and
[2:04:30] about seven feet wide and 40 feet long
[2:04:32] one stone
[2:04:34] not poured concrete one stone
[2:04:39] then you've got others it's about like
[2:04:41] this
[2:04:43] then you've got people like me that's
[2:04:45] Splinter Stone I guess
[2:04:47] but as long as I'm a stone I'm going to
[2:04:49] come out punching look out devil here I
[2:04:52] come I ain't worried about my size I
[2:04:54] just want to make sure I come from the
[2:04:56] man whose name is the branch
[2:04:58] I'm one part of the rock Kingdom so
[2:05:01] guess what I'm going to do I'm on a beat
[2:05:03] I'm on a thrash I'm gonna whip up on the
[2:05:06] devil as long as I've got a chance and
[2:05:07] an opportunity anybody with me tonight I
[2:05:10] don't have to be as big as brother Ron
[2:05:12] Spencer I don't have to do what brother
[2:05:14] Tim does that's not who I am my name is
[2:05:16] Donnie in case you all forgot it my last
[2:05:18] name is Reagan in case you forgot it and
[2:05:20] I'm going to chew on that devil I'm
[2:05:22] going to kick him I'm going to stomp him
[2:05:24] I'm going to do whatever I can do to
[2:05:26] make hell pay well praise the Lord you
[2:05:29] young people quit comparing yourself to
[2:05:31] this man or that man or that young man
[2:05:33] he's my idol don't make any person your
[2:05:36] idol make the Lord Jesus the one you
[2:05:39] look to
[2:05:42] understand
[2:05:44] Hallelujah
[2:05:46] Hallelujah
[2:05:49] oh don't you love him tonight
[2:05:53] thank God for his grace to us
[2:05:57] praise the Lord Jesus
[2:06:01] thank you Lord
[2:06:03] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:06:06] we worship you tonight mighty God
[2:06:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:06:11] you understand friends we're in that
[2:06:13] transition
[2:06:15] between the coming of the son of man
[2:06:18] and that advent when he will take away
[2:06:21] his bride what's been going on now for
[2:06:24] two thousand years it was under the
[2:06:26] dispensation of the Son of God the
[2:06:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost why Son of God
[2:06:30] God is a spirit what does son of man
[2:06:33] mean son or been of a man what is holy
[2:06:37] ghost son of God
[2:06:40] God himself condescending in a form of
[2:06:43] sonship for two thousand years seven
[2:06:45] Church ages under that reign of Son of
[2:06:48] God building an invisible Kingdom in the
[2:06:50] hearts of his people
[2:06:52] and then right down on the end time
[2:06:54] before the opening of the seals he slips
[2:06:57] down as a revealing of the son of man
[2:07:00] praise God now remember that prophetic
[2:07:03] Ministry ended the man
[2:07:06] but the son of man Christ Jesus is still
[2:07:09] here
[2:07:10] I hope you don't get mad at me if you do
[2:07:12] I don't really care because it's the
[2:07:13] truth anyhow that Pillar of Fire is
[2:07:16] still here
[2:07:17] that Lord Jesus is still here he's out
[2:07:20] here with us tonight he's with his
[2:07:22] people all over the whole world he is
[2:07:25] here when he leaves we leave with him
[2:07:31] praise God
[2:07:32] so what's he doing polishing the stones
[2:07:35] getting everything ready
[2:07:38] for this great body you see John saw it
[2:07:41] coming down but he's looking at the end
[2:07:43] of the of the Feast of Tabernacles
[2:07:46] the Millennium and odd John saw the holy
[2:07:49] city in the New Jerusalem descending
[2:07:50] from God out of Heaven as a bride
[2:07:52] adorned for her husband but Paul says
[2:07:55] this one is going up what is it it's the
[2:07:58] Pyramid of God faith virtue knowledge
[2:08:01] Temperance all that down through the
[2:08:03] church ages God building a building and
[2:08:06] what's he going to do in the
[2:08:07] resurrection he's going to resurrect
[2:08:09] this entire pyramid and take it up
[2:08:13] in the first resurrection and then
[2:08:15] whenever he comes back and we set upon
[2:08:18] the Earth in the Millennium Reign and
[2:08:20] the temple will be rebuilt in Jerusalem
[2:08:23] and the law will go forth the Torah will
[2:08:25] go forth from Jerusalem Micah 4 1-3 and
[2:08:29] War will it set upon the Mount of God
[2:08:32] Mount Zion
[2:08:34] oh praise the Lord then the spiritual
[2:08:37] pyramid of the body the bride will come
[2:08:39] right back down and set down where on
[2:08:42] Jerusalem
[2:08:44] thank you Lord Jesus don't you
[2:08:46] understand there's no way for you to
[2:08:48] lose
[2:08:49] your winners
[2:08:51] praise be to God
[2:08:54] that's about our head shall we
[2:08:58] anyone not to be remembered tonight as
[2:09:00] we pray
[2:09:01] anything that just hindering in your
[2:09:04] life you walk you just don't have the
[2:09:06] victory that you want to have or
[2:09:08] something besetting you or something
[2:09:10] bothering you maybe a sickness in your
[2:09:12] body or whatever it is you just need
[2:09:14] strength you just think brother Donnie
[2:09:17] that rung true to me tonight that's
[2:09:19] scripture
[2:09:21] about the devil wearing out the Saints
[2:09:24] I got to be honest friends
[2:09:26] I feel wore out sometimes
[2:09:28] just dealing with life
[2:09:30] you just feel so worn out
[2:09:34] what's that mean you're going to quit
[2:09:35] goodness no
[2:09:37] you ever work real hard in the day
[2:09:39] especially when it's hot and the heat
[2:09:41] just takes it out of him you've sweated
[2:09:42] and you've sweated and you've drank and
[2:09:45] tried to intake your fluid level and all
[2:09:46] of that and you just feel so worn out at
[2:09:50] the end of the day and what are you
[2:09:52] looking for you're looking to go home
[2:09:55] that don't mean you ain't never coming
[2:09:57] back again
[2:09:58] you're just longing for the end of the
[2:09:59] day this is what we feel is the bride
[2:10:03] it ain't that we're quitting that ain't
[2:10:05] we're going back to the world my
[2:10:06] goodness why in the world but I want to
[2:10:07] go back to that hog slop that old mess
[2:10:10] of the world
[2:10:11] I'm just getting tired at the end of the
[2:10:13] day
[2:10:14] I'm weary I'm hot I'm sweaty as it was
[2:10:17] Brother Louie just tiring your hands are
[2:10:20] feeble as the Bible says lift up the
[2:10:23] hands that are feeble that hang down
[2:10:25] your spirit gets Weir your mind gets
[2:10:28] weary
[2:10:29] sometimes you can develop a weary
[2:10:30] attitude
[2:10:32] but that don't mean we're ready to quit
[2:10:35] just means we're ready to go home
[2:10:37] but maybe we might need a little bit of
[2:10:39] recharge it tonight
[2:10:41] home might be tomorrow for some of you
[2:10:43] it might be tomorrow for me
[2:10:45] but if it ain't till next week or next
[2:10:47] month I don't know when it'll be but I
[2:10:50] want to be ready
[2:10:51] and I want to stay energized
[2:10:53] you think that little Energizer battery
[2:10:55] is something my goodness you and I ought
[2:10:58] to be way more in that little energized
[2:10:59] bunny
[2:11:00] you've seen it you know what I'm talking
[2:11:02] about they put them little batteries in
[2:11:03] that little guy and he goes down there
[2:11:04] beating that drum we ought to be even
[2:11:06] way more than that is because we've got
[2:11:09] the original Energizer the baptism of
[2:11:11] the Holy Ghost
[2:11:13] let's just pray can we
[2:11:15] not only those in the visible audience
[2:11:17] but those that are streaming Wherever
[2:11:18] You Are Tonight
[2:11:21] Heavenly Father
[2:11:24] we're just praying tonight for your
[2:11:25] strength and your grace
[2:11:28] Lord is Zechariah prophesied in those
[2:11:31] days and we know from the story of Ezra
[2:11:35] and the stories thereof during that time
[2:11:37] frame that they were dealing with such
[2:11:39] opposition and such difficulty
[2:11:42] to build the wall and to build the
[2:11:45] foundations of the house and and to
[2:11:47] bring it all up it was one battle after
[2:11:49] another after another
[2:11:51] and Lord we should not be confounded
[2:11:54] when we look around and say why is it
[2:11:56] such a struggle why is there such a
[2:11:58] battle Satan is always hated the
[2:12:00] construction of the house of God
[2:12:04] we know what a time we've had just
[2:12:06] building this natural building trying to
[2:12:08] meet this requirement and that
[2:12:10] requirement and this stipulation and
[2:12:12] that stipulation just to be able to get
[2:12:14] in here just the natural side how much
[2:12:18] more that spiritual dwelling of the
[2:12:20] house of God
[2:12:22] then Satan will try to discourage he'll
[2:12:24] try to wear us out as it were
[2:12:26] oh but Jesus we pray tonight you'd come
[2:12:29] this way Lord
[2:12:30] visit us in a special way with your
[2:12:33] presence father
[2:12:34] may you bring encouragement tonight Lord
[2:12:38] maybe to every preacher Lord every
[2:12:41] deacon
[2:12:43] Lord some of these brothers and sisters
[2:12:45] have contributed so much of their
[2:12:46] strength and their time
[2:12:48] father many of these brothers have come
[2:12:50] and worked in the Midnight Hour donated
[2:12:53] their time took time away from their
[2:12:55] wives and their children themselves to
[2:12:58] be able to make this all work together
[2:13:00] some come early but the crack of dawn oh
[2:13:04] I pray you'd bless every one of them
[2:13:05] Father bless every one of them some Lord
[2:13:08] maybe they don't have any ability like
[2:13:10] that but they've donated and donated
[2:13:12] Lord people that streamed the services
[2:13:14] even though many of them know they'll
[2:13:16] never be able to set a foot in this
[2:13:18] service but they have sent thousands and
[2:13:21] thousands of dollars
[2:13:22] because they believe this is the work of
[2:13:25] God and they want to be identified and
[2:13:28] supporting where they get their food
[2:13:31] I pray you bless every one of them Lord
[2:13:33] God
[2:13:34] oh Jesus would you come father and just
[2:13:37] strengthen your people I don't devil
[2:13:40] would like to wear us out he'd like to
[2:13:42] wear me out Lord he'd like to wear
[2:13:44] brother Daryl out he'd like to wear out
[2:13:46] Brother Louie he'd like to wear us out
[2:13:48] as far as it's getting weary no wonder
[2:13:50] the Bible tells us be not weary and will
[2:13:53] do it father I don't care what you want
[2:13:56] me to be I don't want to be big I don't
[2:13:59] want to be important I'm not gifted like
[2:14:01] a lot of men are but whatever you can
[2:14:04] use me for Jesus maybe I've got a tiny
[2:14:07] little spot in the Kingdom some of them
[2:14:09] Stones I put in that column over there I
[2:14:12] can still remember the size of them an
[2:14:14] inch and a quarter by two and a half and
[2:14:16] some of the brothers cutting them for me
[2:14:18] so I wouldn't have to get down and they
[2:14:20] would cut them and throw them up to me
[2:14:22] and I'd stick them in and I'd call out
[2:14:24] the measurement make me a three and a
[2:14:26] half by an eight and a half or make me
[2:14:28] this and that brother Dave did the same
[2:14:29] thing because we had something in her
[2:14:32] mind
[2:14:33] and them little stones are important
[2:14:35] they fill a spot Lord God May ever Stone
[2:14:38] in this building tonight realize we
[2:14:42] don't need to compare ourselves to
[2:14:43] somebody else what we need to do is
[2:14:46] compare ourselves to your vision of our
[2:14:48] life if you want me to be a little
[2:14:50] stoned I'm perfectly fine with that but
[2:14:53] Lord God help my life to match your
[2:14:55] vision of me I don't want to be one inch
[2:14:58] bigger or one inch smaller I want to be
[2:15:01] exacted to declared Dimensions that you
[2:15:03] thought of me before the foundation of
[2:15:06] the world because there's one thing I
[2:15:08] want to hear when Carol and I walk
[2:15:09] before you that day and I grab her by
[2:15:12] the arm and we walk down and we stand
[2:15:13] before you Lord Jesus we're not going to
[2:15:16] stand there at the white Throne judgment
[2:15:18] but rather we will stand there at the
[2:15:21] rewards when we stand there that day arm
[2:15:24] and arm Lord God I want to hear these
[2:15:26] words well done my good and faithful
[2:15:31] servant
[2:15:33] I'm not looking for accolades of Praise
[2:15:35] I'm not looking for greatness and that
[2:15:37] and the other just let me hear those
[2:15:39] words then father it will be worse at
[2:15:42] all everything we've ever won went
[2:15:45] through to hear those great precious
[2:15:47] words
[2:15:49] anyone else feel that way tonight would
[2:15:51] you just raise your hand Lord God say
[2:15:53] that about me
[2:15:54] Hallelujah
[2:15:56] oh Jesus don't let us miss it Lord
[2:15:59] let us be faithful to the very end
[2:16:01] whatever you've contributed to us we
[2:16:04] might be the little boy that has the
[2:16:06] lunch
[2:16:07] with a few Fish and Loaves in his hands
[2:16:10] it was good for a lunch a little boy
[2:16:12] that skipped school but in the hands of
[2:16:15] Jesus it could feed five thousand
[2:16:18] maybe my little ambition my little gift
[2:16:20] my this set the other if I keep it and
[2:16:22] do what I want to with it not never
[2:16:24] amount to Nothing in life but if I can
[2:16:27] surrender to you Lord God it can affect
[2:16:30] people around the world brother Daryl

[2:16:34] with him while he'll never amount to
[2:16:35] nothing oh Ward boy you know them Awards
[2:16:38] come from over North Carolina and
[2:16:40] probably just you know hang around and
[2:16:41] become this and that and the other and
