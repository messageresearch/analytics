[23:45] worship You Lord God hallelujah praise
[23:53] the Lord not subject for tonight is love
[24:01] the evidence of life love the evidence
[24:10] of life let's turn to first John chapter
[24:15] 3 verse 11
[24:18] I've not just read about this love I've
[24:21] experienced it amen first john chapter 3
[24:26] verse 11 for this is the message that ye
[24:33] heard from the beginning that we should
[24:37] love one another not as Cain who was of
[24:42] that wicked one and slew his brother
[24:47] wherefore slew he him because his own
[24:52] works were evil which is of a bad nature
[24:56] is what the word evil means of a bad
[24:59] nature and his brothers righteous Marvel
[25:06] not my brethren if the world hates you
[25:11] okay now what in the world has that got
[25:13] to do with Cain and Abel Cain killed
[25:16] Abel because his works were Ivonne's
[25:18] brother sriracha's then the very next
[25:21] verse Marvel not my brothers if the
[25:25] world hates you
[25:29] this verse here is the very epitome of
[25:31] the verse we just read prior to
[25:34] worldliness my friends it's not just
[25:37] long hair on the man short hair on a
[25:39] woman
[25:40] hatred is worldliness Marvel not my
[25:45] brethren if the world hate you
[25:47] I listen this is the assurance that the
[25:50] first century Christians who were born
[25:52] of the Holy Ghost this is the assurance
[25:55] they had we know that we had passed from
[26:02] death unto life because we're in the
[26:06] message because I believe God sent a
[26:08] prophet Paul it's no Marvel to make
[26:14] friends as I said to this one so many
[26:15] message people are so uncertain as to
[26:17] have the Holy Ghost
[26:18] they're not basing it on scriptural
[26:21] basis well I believe this and I believe
[26:26] that and I believe this and I believe
[26:28] that it's not what you believe
[26:29] it's what's happened to you and who you
[26:33] are you understand you can believe
[26:36] believe believe and believe and still
[26:37] not be born again but if this happens to
[26:40] you it is a sign that you are a new
[26:42] creature in Christ Jesus now listen how
[26:47] sure well I hope I got the Holy Ghost I
[26:49] believe I'm hoping that up we know that
[26:55] we had passed from death unto life
[26:57] because we love the Brethren he that
[27:04] loveth not his brother abideth and death
[27:08] and whosoever hate us his brother is a
[27:13] murderer and you know that no murderer
[27:19] has eternal life abiding in him
[27:26] praise the Lord I'm glad I've passed
[27:30] from death unto life I bet you were
[27:33] gonna pray a text brother Jason yawns
[27:35] just a little while before service and
[27:38] ask him he'll but the bill was done and
[27:40] he said that but the bill had got to
[27:42] actually come home for a few hours today
[27:46] and tomorrow they're gonna give him a
[27:49] pass to be able to come home tomorrow
[27:50] and Lord willin if everything's going
[27:53] well he'll be able to go to to his
[27:55] church tomorrow for the first time since
[27:58] all these events happened so we're just
[28:01] thankful to the Lord he certainly still
[28:03] needs need some more things to be done
[28:06] and we're just believing God for that
[28:08] and I just wanted to share that with you
[28:09] I so appreciate what the Lord is doing
[28:11] for our brother let's bow our heads
[28:13] together Lord Jesus how we thank you
[28:17] tonight for this great great love lord I
[28:22] pray that you would so engulf our hearts
[28:26] we know Lord Jesus because people in
[28:31] this day are so wrapped up in the term
[28:33] of love and what they think is love at
[28:38] first glance when we look at these
[28:39] things we think Paul that's the same
[28:41] stuff the world is preaching the Lord
[28:43] with a second glance we realize it and
[28:46] even know we're in the same ballpark as
[28:48] what they're saying this is you for God
[28:52] is love
[28:54] father I pray that you would take us to
[28:57] not Lord pull us into a sphere of love
[29:01] Lord that we've never been in before
[29:04] help us that we can lay aside everything
[29:07] that would hinder our lives Lord Jesus
[29:11] made this so imprint upon our souls and
[29:16] our beings that we will never be the
[29:19] same by one visitation
[29:22] you carried brother Branham allowed him
[29:24] to move into that realm of the sixth
[29:26] dimension it was not the bluegrass that
[29:30] was bawling in the wind it was not the
[29:34] white robes that he saw on those
[29:37] it was not the throne because he didn't
[29:40] see the throne but he said he would
[29:42] never be the same again but what was it
[29:47] that affected him was that sense of
[29:50] perfect love and he said they told him
[29:54] this is what you preached was the Holy
[29:58] Ghost
[30:00] Lord I pray that you would help us
[30:02] message preachers to preach the Holy
[30:05] Ghost in the same way speak to us
[30:08] tonight from your word father in Jesus
[30:10] name and the Saints said god bless you
[30:14] you may be seated
[30:16] let's turn to st. John chapter 13 verse
[30:18] 34 if you would and this let me remind
[30:21] you of the new commandment on the basis
[30:23] that this new covenant is going to be
[30:25] established between Jesus and his
[30:28] spiritual mystical bride remember love
[30:31] is not now being introduced in the New
[30:33] Testament but it's love to a degree that
[30:36] is being introduced in the New Testament
[30:37] which has never been quite known before
[30:40] we know that Adam and Eve must have
[30:41] walked in a realm of perfect love in a
[30:44] realm of just great harmony with God in
[30:47] a realm of fellowship and understanding
[30:49] with each other but what they had they
[30:52] could fall away from the image that Adam
[30:55] had he could loose the image of God the
[30:58] walk that he had was God he was able to
[31:01] lose by forfeiture of losing that
[31:03] position was God so we know then that
[31:06] the thing that God wants us to be
[31:08] restored to is even beyond what Adam had
[31:11] now listen Jesus being the head of the
[31:14] new race and keep in mind now that that
[31:17] came being the head of the first one of
[31:21] Satan's productivity in the human race
[31:24] and look at his reaction Cain slew his
[31:28] brother so instead of giving his life
[31:31] for his brother he took his brother's
[31:34] life which would be the worst that you
[31:37] and I could do to anyone now if I rob
[31:40] something from you if you worked long
[31:42] enough you could probably get it back if
[31:43] I hurt your feelings if time went on
[31:46] long enough you would get over it if I
[31:48] took something from you that was
[31:50] precious to you no doubt you'd be able
[31:52] to get over but if I took your life
[31:54] there's nothing that could ever be done
[31:56] to restore that back to you if I took
[31:59] your life your existence your
[32:01] representation upon the earth that is
[32:04] the very worst thing that I could do for
[32:06] you
[32:07] but if I would be able to save your life
[32:10] or restore your life or give your life
[32:13] back that would be the greatest thing I
[32:15] could ever do that would be greater than
[32:17] even making you a millionaire which you
[32:19] might lose in the stock market or you
[32:21] would lose you know because of the
[32:23] economy but if I would be able to give
[32:25] your life so giving of life and taking a
[32:28] life then is one of the greatest things
[32:30] that we could do to one another now
[32:32] noticing Kane takes his brother's life
[32:34] but Jesus says a new commandment I give
[32:37] unto you that you love one another as I
[32:41] have loved you that you also love one
[32:44] another now this new commandment tests
[32:47] man as nothing else good
[32:49] there is nothing now remember this is
[32:52] not a preacher saying this this is not
[32:55] someone's opinion but this is the author
[32:57] of the New Covenant himself so surely he
[33:01] should know what the contents of the
[33:04] will says and the impossibility of mere
[33:07] human beings been able to fulfill the
[33:09] contents of that will without a divine
[33:12] intervention in their soul this is going
[33:16] to be the ultimate test on down through
[33:19] the ages now truly they will have a
[33:20] portion of the Holy Ghost through Luther
[33:22] West and Pentecost but at the end time
[33:24] the full restoration of the baptism of
[33:26] the Holy Ghost will be restored again
[33:28] and it won't just be a baptism but it
[33:30] will be the token which will be the
[33:32] literal life of the sacrifice himself so
[33:34] you see God is demanding more of us even
[33:37] now than when we go first got saved 5
[33:39] years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago
[33:41] whatever it is so the only ones who has
[33:44] received eternal life according to st.
[33:47] John 5:24 will be the ones that will be
[33:49] able to meet this criteria of God it is
[33:51] so high the demands are set so high
[33:54] there is no other person outside of the
[33:58] regenerated that will ever be able to do
[34:01] this now they will
[34:02] think they love their brother they will
[34:05] go because Satanists so whitewash the
[34:08] real understanding of what love is and
[34:10] it's not everybody putting their arms
[34:12] around everybody whole we just love
[34:14] everybody and we let it people come to
[34:15] our church and they live how they want
[34:17] to and our preacher don't ever preach
[34:19] against sin and he loves everybody he
[34:21] don't love nobody female preach against
[34:22] sin because real sin remember this same
[34:25] man right here who talked about love the
[34:28] book of John that talked about love also
[34:30] called a man's name from the pulpit in
[34:32] the book and called a man's name by the
[34:34] name of dioptre fees and exposed him
[34:37] publicly your message folks who don't
[34:41] think it's right to call a man's name
[34:43] publicly you need to reread your Bible
[34:45] and you need to reread the message
[34:48] praise the Lord
[34:49] but yet what he done it from the appear
[34:52] to me of love he's warning those people
[34:54] who can be affected by this man and dr.
[34:57] fees was a businessman if your study
[34:59] history who had a big sway among those
[35:02] message people so John saw it fit to
[35:05] call this man's name and make a public
[35:08] example out of this man don't get scared
[35:13] now I'm gonna do that to nobody it's
[35:15] just the word just say a mentor now
[35:18] what's this Jesus gives us this new
[35:21] commandment as it is identified now once
[35:24] let's look back again in verse 14 of
[35:26] first John we know that we have passed
[35:28] from death unto life
[35:29] so death and life are represented as two
[35:33] distinct territories and kingdoms or
[35:36] States they are in other words they are
[35:40] dominions or kingdoms that are separated
[35:43] and each of them have their boundaries
[35:45] each of them have their guidelines each
[35:47] of them have their king or the one who
[35:50] is the rule of them now notice the way
[35:52] words is we know that we have passed
[35:54] from death unto life now passed from is
[35:57] a word that means passing from one form
[36:00] of government to another it was used of
[36:04] a transition from one place to another
[36:07] and it's the same root word that is used
[36:09] to migrate so you have migrated from one
[36:13] Dominion
[36:14] to another now this is not something
[36:16] that you can do on your own not
[36:19] something that you can be trained into
[36:21] or school into come on you cannot grow
[36:24] into being born again you will grow
[36:27] after you're born again but we cannot
[36:29] teach people how to grow into the new
[36:32] birth at this church it is a
[36:34] supernatural act by God and it can only
[36:37] be given by God himself
[36:40] there is no preacher no pastor nobody
[36:42] else they can give you the new verse
[36:44] because we are born by the will of God
[36:47] at the time of God by the breath of God
[36:50] for the purpose of God glory to God
[36:54] hallelujah
[36:56] now notice John is making this so sure
[36:59] for the first century Christians and we
[37:01] believe not only them but for those of
[37:03] us as well on this day we know that we
[37:05] have passed from one Dominion or from
[37:08] one Kingdom or we are migrated from from
[37:12] a kingdom that was of darkness and of
[37:14] the world and we have migrated and been
[37:16] moved over into a kingdom of life now
[37:19] this is the way we know that this has
[37:22] happened we know we have passed from
[37:24] death unto life because we believe
[37:30] cerfancy we believe women can preach we
[37:34] don't believe that there's an eternal
[37:35] hell we believe women all have long hair
[37:36] long dresses we believe all of that
[37:38] that's not the test but here the
[37:41] evidence that was set forth by this
[37:43] disciple of love was that we loved one
[37:46] you said that's one of these things
[37:47] there is I beg your pardon this is
[37:50] absolutely impossible without a new
[37:52] birth
[37:56] Laurey
[37:57] payment I believe better BAM I believe
[37:59] brother BAM oh yeah sure we've had
[38:00] thousands of bleep other bands how to
[38:02] call him a devil well glory
[38:05] now what's we know that we have passed
[38:07] from death unto libel of the brother so
[38:11] here is the mark of discipleship or the
[38:15] mark of distinction or the reality of
[38:17] the token in life form now people can
[38:21] say by words by logos I love you brother
[38:24] I love you brother I love you sister oh
[38:26] I love I love I love but for those words
[38:29] have become Rhema words in their life
[38:31] displayed in an action it's a total
[38:34] different saying now the first part of
[38:36] course of John 3:16 is God so loved the
[38:38] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[38:40] so God loved that's word then God gave
[38:44] now that's that word in action so you
[38:46] for us to be able to love continuously
[38:49] especially people that will trespass
[38:51] against us over and over again or
[38:54] somebody that clashes with your makeup
[38:56] and for you to still love them as if
[38:59] though you love the Lord Jesus because
[39:01] it is him in them if they're born again
[39:04] that takes the Spirit of God to help us
[39:07] to do it we can't do it preachers
[39:09] included no one since so we are changed
[39:14] from a Kanis corrupt nature
[39:21] to a born-again nature so instead of
[39:25] desiring to take our brother's life we
[39:28] would give my life for our brother's
[39:30] life what's this in Ephesians 1:13 and
[39:33] whom ye also trusted after that ye heard
[39:36] the word of the truth the gospel of your
[39:38] salvation in whom after that you
[39:40] believed you were sealed with that holy
[39:42] spirit of promise which is the earnest
[39:45] of our inheritance until the redemption
[39:46] of the purchased possession a notice is
[39:50] now unto the praise of his glory
[39:51] wherefore I also add to that a heard of
[39:55] your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[39:58] unto all the saints now notice here
[40:02] appalled is time one true
[40:04] identification of the Holy Ghost in the
[40:07] lives of these Saints that have moved
[40:09] into a world of inheritance of light is
[40:12] that they love all the saints they don't
[40:15] just love Saints that agree with them
[40:17] they don't just love Saints they go on
[40:20] with their doctrine or they get their
[40:22] tapes or stream their services but they
[40:24] love all the saints
[40:26] now notice hair is not mentioned dress
[40:29] is not mentioned hold and say because
[40:31] you believe I'm a prophet of God that's
[40:33] not it because remember the Galatians
[40:35] believe that and then they had turned
[40:36] against Paul but Paul said if you've got
[40:41] this if you love All Saints even those
[40:44] that read you the wrong way you've got
[40:46] to be born again my what an
[40:51] identification
[40:52] notice again it cautions one for since
[40:54] we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus
[40:56] and of the love which he have to all the
[41:01] saints now this is what the Apostolic
[41:02] Church believed that Holy Ghost fell
[41:05] people loved All Saints can you imagine
[41:09] now the Ephesians Saints loving the
[41:12] Corinthian Saints when the Ephesians
[41:15] Saints were one of the deeper churches
[41:17] in the message and the Corinthian church
[41:19] was a very Pentecostal church but if the
[41:25] Ephesians really had the Holy Ghost they
[41:27] loved the Corinthians
[41:29] I remember the Corinthians come to the
[41:31] communion table and got drunk on excess
[41:35] wine well glory the Corinthians was the
[41:41] one who allowed this man to live with
[41:43] his father's wife his stepmother and
[41:45] commit fornication with her true this is
[41:48] the Bible the Corinthians is the one who
[41:50] emphasized so much on the gift the
[41:52] Galatian Church had no problem let's get
[41:54] the Church of Thessalonica the Church of
[41:56] Laodicea all these other churches but if
[41:58] they had the Holy Ghost they would love
[42:00] the faults of the Laodicean people they
[42:03] look beyond their faults and they said
[42:05] you know what I hate sin but I love the
[42:07] sinners I hate their wrongdoings but I
[42:10] love them with all of my heart and they
[42:12] are my brothers and my sisters unlike us
[42:17] message folks of course which pick and
[42:19] choose which ones we love
[42:21] I tell my fellowship now I'm telling my
[42:23] which ones we love
[42:29] well Gloria I want another witness
[42:32] brother Donny good I got one Philemon
[42:36] chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy love
[42:38] and take what's ours toward the Lord
[42:41] Jesus and toward All Saints notice how
[42:47] Paul merges this now that the new burst
[42:51] whenever he writes about their faith in
[42:53] the Lord Jesus Ephesians one fifteenth
[42:55] and larger the Saints cautions one for
[42:57] since we're heard of your faith in
[42:59] Christ Jesus and love which head toward
[43:01] the saints Philemon 1:5 hearing the died
[43:03] 11 faithful Southwest toward the Lord
[43:06] Jesus and toward All Saints you cannot
[43:08] separate it you cannot love God with all
[43:11] of your heart and hate anyone especially
[43:15] the body of Christ why because God has
[43:19] so made this love in the New Testament
[43:22] it is inseparable to hate me is to hate
[43:27] God
[43:29] can you see how people are in the
[43:31] message are so bad and so pitiful that
[43:33] they hate one another they hate people
[43:36] around the message and say they love God
[43:38] with all their heart they're liars
[43:41] murderers well praise the Lord
[43:46] oh man the Brethren must be loved
[43:53] because the likeness of God is in their
[43:58] souls by the new birth
[44:03] you don't love the thought you don't
[44:05] other shortcomings you don't love their
[44:07] failures you don't love their human
[44:10] crisis and you have but you love the
[44:12] image the image of God if God himself
[44:16] would choose to endure all that brothers
[44:18] sister loved them for that sake you
[44:22] might not care for all they shout him
[44:24] that's a screen tonight tell us nothing
[44:25] to do with it you're looking at the
[44:27] outside you can see us that person loved
[44:30] God and they're truly born again then in
[44:32] them it's the same image of God that's
[44:34] in you Oh hallelujah
[44:40] you see this is one reason why one of
[44:43] the many reasons why the Lord
[44:45] established a local body a church that
[44:49] people should attend because in there we
[44:52] come to feed and rejoicing by all those
[44:55] sort of things but it's not just for
[44:57] that reason only we come to church to be
[45:00] crossed
[45:06] for folks who stay home all the time now
[45:09] realize there's folks in certain
[45:10] conditions you know they live in the
[45:12] middle of nowhere
[45:12] ain't got no church to go to and they
[45:14] stream these services and I feel sorry
[45:16] for most of the ones I hear from don't
[45:17] want to be there they won't have your
[45:18] pew as a matter of fact they don't
[45:21] understand why you don't come to church
[45:22] when you can they're envious of your
[45:27] opportunity to come here well I'm just
[45:30] telling you the truth and being honest
[45:32] but yet God will somehow supplement
[45:36] those people and take care of them
[45:38] but you realize that we need we need as
[45:42] human beings not only to be rubbed in
[45:45] the right way but sometimes rubbed the
[45:48] wrong way because it's when we rub the
[45:52] wrong way that shows us our shortcomings
[45:54] it's noble and three people are giving
[45:56] us great Caprice of accolades oh you're
[45:59] so good by the gym you're just the next
[46:00] thing to an angel as it'll end if you
[46:02] think that all the tributes just the
[46:06] sweetest first I've ever seen in my life
[46:07] and all - hey it's just getting bigger
[46:09] and bigger and bigger and bigger and
[46:10] bigger so God will send somebody now
[46:12] brother Jim I don't know why do you and
[46:20] he feels like taking that finger and
[46:21] that thumb and pinch in their head - a
[46:24] head shrinker size number don't tell me
[46:28] I made that up he just said that's true
[46:32] [Applause]
[46:33] [Laughter]
[46:34] but you see the people who praise
[46:37] OpenSim you doing such a great job such
[46:39] a wonderful job it's not them people
[46:41] that would check by the Jim's oil and
[46:43] but it's those that would clash with you
[46:47] mom they're preachers and the message
[46:50] and all they love praise they love to be
[46:53] bragged on but they can't stand it if
[46:56] anybody questions one principle of
[46:59] something they preach well go around
[47:06] it's part of our development to being
[47:10] Christians and you lived in the first
[47:13] century which one of the churches that I
[47:15] just mentioned will you'd went to I'll
[47:19] tell you let me look at your makeup and
[47:22] I'll tell you if you'd had the choice
[47:24] some you don't want to Corinth no
[47:26] question about it some of you are alert
[47:29] to the Ephesian Church because you deem
[47:31] yourself theologians you considered
[47:38] yourself so deep you never went to that
[47:41] collation sir why they questioned the
[47:42] prophet of God I wouldn't sell believers
[47:49] but all of them and if you had the Holy
[47:52] Ghost you get all of them you might not
[47:54] have understood how they listen to some
[47:56] liar to try to tell you the poleward a
[47:58] prophet of God but you love them anyhow
[48:01] right so which church would you went to
[48:05] and yet Paul said these with the Holy
[48:07] Ghost
[48:08] loved all the Saints you imagine if they
[48:11] ever had fellowship means and you got a
[48:12] Christian believer sent my son and
[48:14] Ephesian believer that Corinthian
[48:17] believers just bouncing off the peace Oh
[48:20] glory to cut that deep Ephesian
[48:23] theologians
[48:24] Oh God
[48:28] I see the devil got on me to set by you
[48:32] I definitely wouldn't letter the Lord to
[48:36] sit on the same hue you said on I must
[48:38] have been strictly in the flesh and then
[48:42] a Galatian believer over here and I
[48:44] thought that's all I could believe her
[48:45] over there but all of those that have
[48:47] the Holy Ghost and Ephesian believer
[48:50] we've been able to go up and grab the
[48:52] hand of a Quentin believer if it is
[48:54] Stood Still OH&S huh hit him on over and
[48:56] grab the hold of his head and put his
[48:58] arm around his brother
[49:09] god bless him see you some other time
[49:11] not us we ignore them stay away from
[49:23] them because we don't like them now
[49:29] remember hatred friends you can't go by
[49:31] your definition of hatred hatred is just
[49:35] several degrees farther than dislike
[49:39] it's a detestable dislike that you have
[49:43] for an individual if God were to weigh
[49:46] us out in this building tonight or in
[49:47] this message I wonder how much hatred
[49:49] would be all inside the ranks of this
[49:50] message or inside this church well the
[49:57] longer I go the quarter you get and the
[50:00] quarter you get the longer I'm going
[50:03] [Applause]
[50:06] now notice Jonah again says we know that
[50:10] we have passed from death unto life now
[50:14] because we love the Brethren now this is
[50:17] not the cause of passing from death unto
[50:20] life but this is the effect when I deal
[50:25] with people and I counsel people I try
[50:27] to point them I look at three points of
[50:29] issues in their life calls effect and
[50:32] cure
[50:33] I found out their many years of
[50:36] experience and when they've got issues
[50:38] and problems if you can come to those
[50:40] three things and many of the things that
[50:41] will be resolved of cause and effect and
[50:44] a cure we know the cure most of the time
[50:48] is God's Word and what contains in the
[50:50] volumes of God's Word but what gets
[50:53] tricky is that you go to take the killer
[50:55] and Satan will try to make people apply
[50:58] the cure to the effect and not apply it
[51:02] to the cause
[51:03] so you apply the cure to the effect and
[51:06] it brings almost instantaneous but
[51:09] temporary reprieve and they feel better
[51:13] oh not everything's gonna be fine praise
[51:15] God all I know it is I know it is and
[51:18] Satan knows as well that applying the
[51:21] cure to the effect will only bring
[51:23] temporary relief but the cause is still
[51:26] there now the reason we love our
[51:29] brothers is the effect of a new life
[51:33] which is divine life we could not love
[51:37] our brothers in order to get the new
[51:39] verse we had to happen their birth in
[51:42] order to love them all because we love
[51:54] the Brethren you see those who think
[51:58] it's separable or still under the
[52:00] anointing of Cain Cain loved
[52:08] and remember his hatred was formed in
[52:13] church as him and Abel bowls are in the
[52:18] house of God building an altar murder is
[52:22] burst under the auspices of hatred oh
[52:29] man we know that we have passed from
[52:31] death unto life because we love the
[52:33] Brethren he that loveth not his brother
[52:37] abideth in death so no matter how much
[52:40] he thinks he's passed over from the
[52:42] Dominion of Satan into the Dominion of
[52:46] God if he loves not a half a dozen and
[52:50] then hates only one if he loves
[52:53] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[52:56] God's children but there's one that he
[52:59] absolutely hates he's no truly boolean
[53:05] there's no high fiber new verse
[53:07] there's no 3/4 they're both either you
[53:09] are or you aren't praise the Lord
[53:15] Oh Lord Jesus now let's look at this
[53:19] together if you wouldn't let's see how
[53:22] many just look at a few places in the
[53:24] scripture how that it refers to this
[53:28] idea of one another in this new
[53:32] formation of the mystical body you see
[53:35] Christian love is to be a practical
[53:36] thing something that God won't supply
[53:37] every day of our life in st. John 13 14
[53:41] we are to wash one another's feet Romans
[53:46] 12:10 were to prefer one another Romans
[53:51] 12:16 be of the same man one to another
[53:56] Romans 14 13 do not judge one another
[54:00] Romans 15 7 receive one another Romans
[54:05] 15 14 admonish one another
[54:09] first Thessalonians 5:11 either 5 which
[54:12] is build up build up one another
[54:16] I trust we're all guilty of these place
[54:21] a lot I trust we're all guilty of these
[54:23] so far Galatians 5:13 by love serve one
[54:31] another Galatians 6:2 bear one another's
[54:35] burdens
[54:37] Ephesians 14 forbearing one another in
[54:40] love if he sins for 32 forgiving one
[54:45] another for sicilus 14 comfort one
[54:48] another so shillings 5:11 edify one
[54:51] another Hebrews 10:24 let us consider
[54:54] which is understand one another James
[55:00] 5:16 confess your faults one to another
[55:04] first Peter 4 not use hospitality one to
[55:09] another in short summing these brief
[55:18] things together can't you see how this
[55:20] body is going to be unlike any let's
[55:24] have a bit on the earth the channel of
[55:26] this who could never produce this
[55:27] Jeremiah a godly holy man could not
[55:31] produce David a man after God's own
[55:34] heart but David couldn't love this way
[55:37] David hated people that was his
[55:42] disposition right he hated them well
[55:46] glory
[55:48] David couldn't laugh this way Solomon
[55:51] couldn't love this one
[55:52] ICQ couldn't love this what Moses
[55:54] couldn't love this one he got so mad
[55:58] really this could only be introduced in
[56:04] the New Covenant one another one another
[56:09] one another one another one another
[56:11] oh Jesus oh ma look at Jesus words again
[56:18] in the Saints on 59 as the father hath
[56:21] loved me so have I loved you continue ye
[56:27] in my love
[56:30] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[56:34] abide in my love even as I've kept my
[56:37] father's Commandments and abide in his
[56:41] own now what's this this is not like an
[56:43] option this is a command this is my
[56:48] commandment that you love one another as
[56:51] I have loved you as even when they don't
[56:56] deserve it with the same affection how
[57:06] many times shall I forgive my brother
[57:07] Lord in a day seven times Peter went
[57:11] beyond their all realms of eternity did
[57:12] he he stretched himself plumb out past
[57:15] the horizontal rainbow and thinking men
[57:17] a lot if I force a seven Jesus will
[57:19] think I'm the greatest apostle there is
[57:21] in the world Jesus boat him plumb out of
[57:26] the water you imagine when Jesus got
[57:29] down with seventy times seven pole Peter
[57:31] writes they woke him up you know I
[57:32] actually passed out over there and said
[57:34] are you kidding me this must be I'm in a
[57:36] coma there's no way she said 490 times
[57:39] in the same day by the same man there
[57:41] ain't no way don't he know I've got a
[57:42] bad temper I'll rip his head off there
[57:45] ain't no way in a world I can do that in
[57:46] Jesus knew that at that time Peter could
[57:49] not do it but I guarantee you one thing
[57:51] Peter got to a place he could do it why
[57:57] because the divine life any man moved
[58:00] into Peter Peter at this time had not
[58:02] moved from the kingdom of darkness he
[58:04] was on his way but he had not been
[58:06] translated into the kingdom of his dear
[58:09] son yet look at the epitome of greater
[58:19] love verse 13 greater love hath no man
[58:24] than this that a man lay down his life
[58:28] for his friends
[58:32] no higher expression of love could ever
[58:36] be attained
[58:38] that a person would lay down their life
[58:40] for his friends
[58:43] notice in Romans 5:6 for when we were
[58:45] yet but that strength in due time Christ
[58:47] died for scarcely will a righteous man
[58:56] died yet peradventure for a good man
[58:58] some would even dare to die but God
[59:02] commendeth his love toward us and then
[59:04] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[59:07] for us
[59:10] nay don't raise your head but many of us
[59:12] would have a struggle really a struggle
[59:14] to die for a brother could any of us die
[59:17] for a sinner the things going to kill
[59:22] somebody in this building tonight a
[59:23] sinner or Saint and then it would raise
[59:27] your hand as Christians I'm ready to go
[59:28] but that sinner live he might get saved
[59:31] in the morning would find that real
[59:35] quick how selfishness pervades our lives
[59:36] and then we wonder why this don't need
[59:39] to be preached oh my but God commendeth
[59:43] his love toward us in that while we were
[59:46] yet sinners Christ died for us st. John
[59:51] 15:14 again you are my friends if you do
[59:54] whatsoever I commend you so then he
[59:55] tells them he would reckon them as
[59:58] intimate close friends as long as they
[1:00:01] obeyed his word now we know there are
[1:00:03] degrees of kinship and friendship by
[1:00:06] which the church and the bride is
[1:00:08] greatly divided 144,000 those who live
[1:00:11] on the outside of the city and we know
[1:00:12] only those that are obedient to the
[1:00:14] command of God and Jesus knew and he was
[1:00:17] send this this is only allocated to a
[1:00:18] certain category of people everybody
[1:00:20] cannot eat us can God demand this of the
[1:00:22] foolish virgin absolutely impossible
[1:00:24] they cannot do it why they're not truly
[1:00:26] born again are they on the way to
[1:00:28] salvation yes have they accepted Christ
[1:00:30] as their Savior yes but not as their
[1:00:33] King and Lord he does not set upon the
[1:00:36] throne of the heart and dominate their
[1:00:37] passions her motives their objectives
[1:00:39] but in they let's art he sets their love
[1:00:42] and God demands this of us this is not
[1:00:45] something an option as I say apparel
[1:00:47] windows but this is some
[1:00:48] we are they like to go God will not
[1:00:51] settle until dis is manifested in the
[1:00:55] heart of every let believer around the
[1:00:57] world this is the capstone we've
[1:01:04] screamed about it we've heard about it
[1:01:06] was shouted about it for years
[1:01:08] we knew Michelle DiNozzo Harvey Oh
[1:01:15] notice this in first young 215 love not
[1:01:20] the world neither the things that are in
[1:01:25] the world now remember this is not
[1:01:28] contrary to John 3:16 for God so loved
[1:01:32] the world that He gave His only begotten
[1:01:33] Son so it's used in a different sense so
[1:01:37] we look at the word world
[1:01:40] God loved the world but he tells us love
[1:01:44] not the world which is the world order
[1:01:46] or the cosmos he says neither the things
[1:01:49] that are in the world if any man love
[1:01:51] the world the love of the father is not
[1:01:54] in him
[1:01:55] God doesn't say that it's not accepted
[1:01:58] Christ as Savior but if he loves the
[1:02:00] world the love of God cannot be water
[1:02:03] under two head ships light is under one
[1:02:06] darkness is under other love is on one
[1:02:08] side hate is on the other the love for
[1:02:10] the world is on this side and the love
[1:02:12] for God is on this side you can hear
[1:02:13] both you can't love God and the world
[1:02:16] and say Oh hallelujah I'm a consecrated
[1:02:18] Christian totally impossible you cannot
[1:02:20] love God and hates your brother
[1:02:22] totally impossible you cannot be walking
[1:02:23] in light and walking in darkness at the
[1:02:25] same time totally impossible James says
[1:02:31] it this way chapter 1 verse 27 period
[1:02:33] religion and undefiled before God and
[1:02:35] the father is this to visit the
[1:02:38] fatherless and widows in their
[1:02:40] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:02:42] from the world James 4:4 yield alters
[1:02:47] and adulteresses know ye not that
[1:02:49] friendship of the world is enmity with
[1:02:52] God whosoever therefore will be a friend
[1:02:55] of the world is the enemy
[1:03:01] God well praise the Lord
[1:03:05] notice the wordfriends filos which is
[1:03:08] what we get to record figlio to be
[1:03:11] friendly to one wish him well an
[1:03:13] associate one who associates familiar
[1:03:15] with one a companion so that a person
[1:03:19] cannot love the world all the things
[1:03:21] that don't get in your mind cigarettes
[1:03:22] now don't get in your mind pornography
[1:03:25] don't get in your mind I'm talking about
[1:03:27] the world everything in the world which
[1:03:30] is hate and gossip and lie just as much
[1:03:34] as smoking first John 5:19 we know that
[1:03:39] we are of God and the whole world lieth
[1:03:42] and wickedness the whole world lies and
[1:03:44] wickedness
[1:03:45] so worldliness is not just so much a
[1:03:47] matter of activity as it is of attitude
[1:03:51] you know said a woman can have long hair
[1:03:56] in a long dress and my never have one
[1:03:58] better eyeshadow or makeup or none esta
[1:04:01] and be as a world in her heart as she
[1:04:03] can be because she's nothing but a
[1:04:05] gossiper said the whole church she just
[1:04:07] carries trash from one to another to
[1:04:08] another keeps one big mass going and
[1:04:10] well glory to God preach it brother
[1:04:12] Donna some preachers are the same one
[1:04:16] some preachers of the worst Gospels you
[1:04:17] ever didn't listen your life preach
[1:04:20] Valley Donnie oh you see well in this
[1:04:27] not only affects your your response to
[1:04:30] the love but it affects your attitude
[1:04:33] and how you love that while in this is
[1:04:36] what keeps us from loving those who hate
[1:04:39] us you look at it as a weakness it's not
[1:04:44] a weakness at all its worldliness
[1:04:51] oh it burns us message folks know why
[1:04:57] cuz we got worldliness in a little box
[1:05:02] so tell me what - cigar was it that Eve
[1:05:07] smoked in the gardening huh what what
[1:05:14] brand of television denieth have was a
[1:05:17] dizziness or Magnavox or a sharper which
[1:05:21] part was it that she did sit we should
[1:05:23] fail this she cut her hair he's held on
[1:05:31] short - she didn't have on her - okay
[1:05:36] well you own them down the street
[1:05:38] gossiping there were nobody to gossip -
[1:05:41] do you believe she fell in wildness huh
[1:05:45] decaying falling - yes don't you see
[1:05:48] what Satan's done to us we think we are
[1:05:51] free from worldliness because all of our
[1:05:53] sisters and our brothers don't go you
[1:05:57] know until the year that will give you
[1:05:58] pornography and we fake weddings zoom
[1:06:00] from worldliness and in our heart we
[1:06:02] hate you see when a believer really
[1:06:10] loses his enjoyment of Father's love he
[1:06:13] finds it very difficult to keep God's
[1:06:14] word he finds it very hard to forgive
[1:06:18] those who trespass against him well not
[1:06:21] the world neither the things of the
[1:06:23] world if a man love the world the love
[1:06:24] of the father is not in him that doesn't
[1:06:27] say that God doesn't love him but the
[1:06:29] personal baptism of the love of the
[1:06:31] father is not in him notice this in
[1:06:34] first John chapter 3 verse 11 for this
[1:06:36] is the message that you have heard from
[1:06:38] the beginning that we should love one
[1:06:40] another now he assures him upon this
[1:06:42] precept is the divine seal of the new
[1:06:45] light now he's going to go into this a
[1:06:47] little bit more for he says this is the
[1:06:49] message that you've heard from the
[1:06:50] beginning that we should love one
[1:06:52] another so the word of God is a message
[1:06:54] from God sent to us to tell us what we
[1:06:57] need to do to leave this world right to
[1:06:59] sin as to what we need to do how to
[1:07:00] behave ourselves why we're here and the
[1:07:02] preparation necessary in order to leave
[1:07:04] this well as we looked at it Wednesday
[1:07:06] night that the bridegroom would always
[1:07:07] send the bride the wedding dress that
[1:07:09] she needed the bride didn't go downtown
[1:07:10] on the Jewish marriage and pick out
[1:07:12] which one she wanted but actually the
[1:07:14] bridegroom sent to her the dress now the
[1:07:16] very sign that she needed a dress was
[1:07:19] reflected in that he sent it to her if
[1:07:21] she already had one he didn't need to
[1:07:23] send her one so when you hear things
[1:07:25] like this they cut you and really all my
[1:07:27] really make us feel bad remember it's
[1:07:29] the bridegroom looking at your needs
[1:07:32] looking at my need and saying I need
[1:07:34] this so he has a messenger that
[1:07:36] messenger knocks on your door and
[1:07:38] delivers this package to you and it's a
[1:07:41] perfect fit oh don't look at that that
[1:07:48] God don't love you don't look at that
[1:07:49] the gods have to get you or the
[1:07:51] preachers out to get you it's the love
[1:07:53] of God to you it shows that you needed
[1:07:56] that so the bridegroom would send the
[1:07:58] friend of the bridegroom down to the
[1:07:59] house and he was having his arms are in
[1:08:01] a package and what was that it was the
[1:08:03] ornaments for the bride it was the dress
[1:08:05] for the bride that she did not take that
[1:08:07] oh he don't love it oh he hates me she
[1:08:09] said all he loves me he loves me yes he
[1:08:12] loves me he sent me the wedding garment
[1:08:15] oh I hear brother them say I hope that
[1:08:17] God will crown my ministry with this
[1:08:19] that he will let me take the calls of
[1:08:21] the world and dress his bride here real
[1:08:25] women around this message from the your
[1:08:27] brother Ben blast about things of
[1:08:28] ungodliness they don't take as an insult
[1:08:30] they take it as more clothes hallelujah
[1:08:33] that God sent them a love message
[1:08:35] wrapped up in a box praise on the horn
[1:08:40] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus look
[1:08:49] what the word message means an
[1:08:52] announcement something good not a mere
[1:08:58] command as the law but an announcement
[1:09:03] so God sent brother Branham with several
[1:09:06] announcements
[1:09:07] and the announcements are still going on
[1:09:10] now watch in verse 12 not as Cain who
[1:09:20] was of that wicked one let me read you
[1:09:26] this from Jean Gil who was of the wicked
[1:09:29] one Satan he was a child of his an
[1:09:33] imitator of him one that appeared to be
[1:09:37] under his influence to belong to him so
[1:09:40] that you say of Cain that he was on the
[1:09:42] side of the serpent now I thought we
[1:09:47] were the only strange ones that believed
[1:09:49] serpents II but John Gill and some of
[1:09:53] these other men were going to read you
[1:09:54] about tonight that wrote back in the
[1:09:55] 1500s and the 1600s and the 1700s
[1:09:59] believe the strange thing and John who
[1:10:02] lived back 2,000 years ago said the cane
[1:10:04] was of the devil
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:09] praise the Lord
[1:10:10] all night so that you say have came that
[1:10:13] he was of the side of the serpent had
[1:10:15] all serpent the devil that old serpent
[1:10:19] the devil as the way of the serpent is
[1:10:21] destroy him to kill so Cain immediately
[1:10:23] became a murderer and again because Cain
[1:10:26] came from the side of the Angel of Death
[1:10:28] he slew his brother listen to this from
[1:10:33] the Bible exposition commentary Cain is
[1:10:35] an example of a life of hatred Cain is
[1:10:38] not presented as an atheist he is
[1:10:41] presented as a worshipper and this is
[1:10:46] the point children of the devil
[1:10:47] masquerade as true believers they attend
[1:10:50] religious gatherings as Cain did they
[1:10:52] may even bring offerings but these
[1:10:54] actions in themselves are not valid
[1:10:56] proof that a man is born of God the real
[1:10:59] test in his love is for the Brethren
[1:11:02] where Cain failed
[1:11:05] every man has a spiritual lineage as
[1:11:08] well as a physical cane spiritual father
[1:11:11] wilds the devil Kane's attitudes and
[1:11:17] actions originated with Satan Cain was a
[1:11:21] murderer and a liar like Satan was st.
[1:11:23] John 8:44 he murdered his brother and
[1:11:26] then he lied about it now lie didn't
[1:11:32] leave commentaries but left us quotes
[1:11:34] ever remember Cain wasn't an infidel
[1:11:37] Cain was a believer this is going to
[1:11:41] shake the gizzard out of you so if you
[1:11:45] got a gizzard in you to nod I guess this
[1:11:47] posts gonna shake it out to hope it does
[1:11:51] because only chickens got gizzards you
[1:11:53] know evening Eagles don't have gizzards
[1:11:56] I guess I hope that does some of you
[1:11:58] found a mentalist and put a heart in you
[1:12:00] that's right a hard to believe
[1:12:02] Cain was religious and a believer he
[1:12:06] came up and built an altar to the Lord
[1:12:08] with just as much face that's what Abel
[1:12:12] did I want to watch want you to watch
[1:12:18] something god it's just so you believe
[1:12:20] that audience
[1:12:20] he is absolutely just enough God on a
[1:12:22] requires of religion Cain was just as
[1:12:25] just as Abel was both those boys came
[1:12:27] before God Cain wasn't a communist he
[1:12:29] wasn't an infidel an unbeliever he was a
[1:12:33] believer if God only requires a believer
[1:12:37] people son jessa condemned came I wonder
[1:12:41] how many around the message and what
[1:12:42] have we call him the same thing Cain was
[1:12:43] called believers
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:47] why we substitute believers from being
[1:12:50] born again if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:51] if you got the Holy Ghost why because
[1:12:52] people can say more positive yes I'm a
[1:12:54] believer yes I'm a believer but pinpoint
[1:12:56] him are you born again you go on I don't
[1:12:58] know our whole part you know why don't
[1:12:59] you see what it is it's easier to say
[1:13:01] well I'm a believer I follow the message
[1:13:03] ah brother darling should good man I'm a
[1:13:04] believer I'm a believer all the train
[1:13:06] could say exactly the same thing I want
[1:13:08] to say more than came to say came to say
[1:13:12] I'm a believer he could say I'm sincere
[1:13:14] I'm a worshiper I love God I want to say
[1:13:17] more than that I want to say that too I
[1:13:19] want to say I'm a believer I'm a
[1:13:21] worshiper I'm sincere but I want to say
[1:13:23] I'm born of God I passed from death unto
[1:13:27] life and one way I know is I don't want
[1:13:30] to murder anybody
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:45] the sermon entitled why I'm a Holy
[1:13:48] Roller now this is gonna make you
[1:13:52] tighten up your ecclesiastical vest a
[1:13:55] little bit
[1:13:55] I love brother benhams Bob Jones
[1:13:59] terminology don't you know a professor
[1:14:02] of theology that went through all these
[1:14:04] great things and God oh man notice God
[1:14:08] cannot be just if you say I'm a believer
[1:14:11] so was Cain and so is the devil that's
[1:14:18] right he came as a believer and you said
[1:14:20] well I go to church I go to the altar so
[1:14:22] he came came built an altar or a church
[1:14:27] unto the Lord yes I'm a member of the
[1:14:29] church so is Cain and King made a
[1:14:31] sacrifice you say I pay so much every
[1:14:33] year and I'm not sure Saudi came I
[1:14:36] worship the Lord from the bottom of my
[1:14:38] heart Saudi Cain Cain was a believer a
[1:14:45] worshipper just as fundamentally right
[1:14:48] as Abel was Amen all I love this I pray
[1:14:55] God steam our hearts I mean what's your
[1:14:59] heart steamed to that
[1:15:02] now you realize steam has to come from a
[1:15:05] high intensity of heat and water so if
[1:15:10] the word is here washing us by the water
[1:15:12] of the word we got enough water here if
[1:15:14] we can get enough heat generating it up
[1:15:16] then it will produce steam then our
[1:15:18] hearts are be steamed
[1:15:20] what disdain dude gets wrinkles out Holy
[1:15:29] Ghost come again at night and steam the
[1:15:31] wrinkles out of our lives
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:40] now it says don't get excited I know
[1:15:44] where I am I feel kind of religious
[1:15:47] right now ain't that strange that here
[1:15:52] feel religious talking about the
[1:15:53] Serpent's ooh and now to make you feel
[1:15:59] religious if you talk about and it hits
[1:16:01] your heart that you ain't that that
[1:16:04] ought to make you feel pretty religious
[1:16:08] gotta go there father Cain was a
[1:16:10] believer
[1:16:11] get on your shot proof vest now Cain was
[1:16:16] a believer in a worshiper of God and if
[1:16:18] God owned a record a believer came as
[1:16:19] just as just as Abel was and God would
[1:16:22] be unjust if he condemned came for his
[1:16:24] faith in him and accepted Abel if faith
[1:16:27] was wholly required all right but Cain
[1:16:29] came and offered a sacrifice no no it
[1:16:31] came built an altar a church he made a
[1:16:34] sacrifice it's the same as Abel did Cain
[1:16:37] worshipped he never come as an
[1:16:39] unbeliever he come as a believer raised
[1:16:41] up his hands and worship God just the
[1:16:45] same as Abel death what a church
[1:16:49] membership an altar a worship sacrifices
[1:16:51] all God requires then Cain was as just
[1:16:54] as Abel was
[1:16:58] so he's fundamentally since series of
[1:17:00] worship Rize believer all of those
[1:17:02] things what's the problem what's the
[1:17:07] problem
[1:17:08] question answers on Hebrews now let's
[1:17:12] take back to Cain could you tell me
[1:17:15] where that spirit and that meanness come
[1:17:19] from now what's this I realize many
[1:17:25] folks in the message purchase with some
[1:17:27] still don't understand this it amazes me
[1:17:31] absolutely amazes me because they think
[1:17:34] after the fall that Adam became a murder
[1:17:38] and after the fall that Adam was full of
[1:17:41] meanness that is not true Adam lost the
[1:17:47] holy image of God but Adam did not
[1:17:49] become these things are here there was
[1:17:52] still a holy strain on the earth two
[1:17:55] separate seed lives
[1:17:58] that's why Genesis six was a necessity
[1:18:00] for Satan to accomplish what he needed
[1:18:04] to accomplish what's better bail now and
[1:18:06] asking this question where did this
[1:18:08] meanness come from look at King if if
[1:18:11] Cain was the son of Adam which was the
[1:18:13] son of God Lord that evil come from give
[1:18:15] me to tell me that he is still
[1:18:17] attributing the lineage of Adam as being
[1:18:19] a son of God after the fall he was a
[1:18:22] fallen son of God but he was still the
[1:18:24] son of God nonetheless and whether or
[1:18:30] not you understand he was a following
[1:18:31] the son of garbage had been restored
[1:18:33] why do you say God put clothes on Adam
[1:18:35] and Eve where did God get that anomie
[1:18:38] went over on a hill what was that animal
[1:18:40] used for to fold that animal was offered
[1:18:43] as a sacrifice as a Natoma and his skin
[1:18:46] was used as a redemptive act to cover
[1:18:48] their nakedness
[1:18:49] crying a god so Adam was restored not to
[1:18:54] the garden of either but to his position
[1:18:56] to where he's able to still talk to God
[1:18:58] you don't find him a tree was close
[1:19:00] again going hiding in the bushes anymore
[1:19:02] do you
[1:19:03] sighing run said I was afraid why God
[1:19:05] night away for Adam to come back no us
[1:19:18] brother Ben said the first thing when he
[1:19:20] was born he hated it was a murderer he
[1:19:29] was jealous
[1:19:32] now what's he showing us the contrast
[1:19:34] between Abel so Abel was born out to the
[1:19:38] fall and yet Abel did not hate nor was
[1:19:42] able jealous nor was able to murder now
[1:19:46] well to the store send him we know this
[1:19:49] service now gun into my desk so the
[1:19:51] Spirit of God spoke these words to me
[1:19:53] Abel could have never kills Cain for he
[1:20:01] was born in the nature can't you see
[1:20:12] what people can kill you but what do you
[1:20:14] do pray for them why it's not in you to
[1:20:17] murder it's not in you to run them down
[1:20:20] and try to learn their character
[1:20:27] now notice take the nature of his daddy
[1:20:30] diverse start at the beginning Lucifer
[1:20:32] in the beginning he was jealous of
[1:20:36] Michael that's what started the whole
[1:20:41] trouble how many knows that and Cain was
[1:20:44] the nature of his father Satan
[1:20:53] physically physically was not his father
[1:20:56] I told you before Cain had two daddies
[1:21:00] one that was a daddy of his body and one
[1:21:02] was a daddy of his nature
[1:21:04] hold on so did you your essay father was
[1:21:10] the father of your body
[1:21:13] tell me now what makes you hate tell me
[1:21:18] what to kept some of you from being a
[1:21:19] murderer well where did you get that
[1:21:23] where did you get this to be like a look
[1:21:28] at Moses a prophet of God of Mara Dyer
[1:21:31] or do you get that nature because the
[1:21:34] nature become mixed after Genesis 6
[1:21:37] don't you understand our children coming
[1:21:39] to message church the center tonight
[1:21:40] with that same thing in them unless they
[1:21:43] get to Holy Ghost we can't just leave
[1:21:46] them to the message we just can't make
[1:21:47] them believers they got to be born again
[1:21:50] got eyes on your nature now what's this
[1:22:02] came was the nature of his father which
[1:22:05] he was jealous of his brother and slew
[1:22:07] him now listen carefully you are you a
[1:22:09] better man if you won't do that
[1:22:10] that nature could not have come out of
[1:22:15] that pure seed after the fall that seed
[1:22:22] was still pure after the fall
[1:22:28] do you understand if Genesis 6 had never
[1:22:31] accomplished there would still be two
[1:22:32] seeds on the earth today there would be
[1:22:34] a pure seed and a polluted Seif but
[1:22:39] Satan wanted to try them the sons of God
[1:22:40] must marry into the daughters of men and
[1:22:42] cross the Sigma and by the way everyone
[1:22:44] born after that time they would have the
[1:22:47] same nature this is why we had to be
[1:22:49] born at our body st. serpent see my skin
[1:22:52] a serpent see but look at you you were a
[1:22:55] nature of the devil just not the rest of
[1:22:57] the world was oh but God put a deposit
[1:23:03] down in your soul that representation of
[1:23:07] eternal life
[1:23:08] Paul said we work by nature children of
[1:23:12] Wrath even as others
[1:23:16] while the folks found that so hard to
[1:23:19] believe that nature could not come out
[1:23:27] of that pierc'd it had to come out of
[1:23:30] this perverted stream and notice cane as
[1:23:33] soon as he was born and the neighbor was
[1:23:35] born after that she can see by Adam knew
[1:23:39] her and she brought forth her son Abel
[1:23:40] Abel was a type of Christ and when Abel
[1:23:44] was killed Seth took his place death
[1:23:46] burial resurrection of Christ and the
[1:23:49] time but now Cain worshipped all of his
[1:23:55] carnivores just help the church today
[1:23:57] they go to church they worship Cain
[1:23:59] worship he wasn't an infidel he wasn't a
[1:24:02] communist Cain was a believer he went to
[1:24:06] God he built an altar he done every
[1:24:07] religious thing they labeled up but he
[1:24:10] didn't have the spiritual revelation of
[1:24:12] the will of God now what's God
[1:24:18] foreshadowing the eighth day even though
[1:24:22] Cain did not have the revelation God was
[1:24:24] not obligated to give it to him he's
[1:24:26] obligated to his own and this one was
[1:24:30] not his own but God said if you would at
[1:24:34] least do like your brother I'll accept
[1:24:37] you what is it a type of those that will
[1:24:39] come out on the outside of the city
[1:24:40] they'll never have the revelation the
[1:24:42] broad scoff they'll never have that
[1:24:43] understand that the bride Scott but some
[1:24:45] of them will go to church and they'll do
[1:24:46] everything they know to do and then
[1:24:48] accept Christ as our Savior and they
[1:24:50] will be golden allowed to go into
[1:24:52] eternal life and Cain God would have
[1:24:55] accepted him but he was so stubborn hold
[1:25:00] on to your seats now God still loved him
[1:25:04] even though he was seed of the serpent
[1:25:10] well the lemon said don't you see it he
[1:25:13] didn't have the spiritual revelation
[1:25:14] that's awesome at the church today Jesus
[1:25:16] said he's built his church on that
[1:25:17] spiritual revelation you get it all now
[1:25:19] your eyes come open and see the
[1:25:20] spiritual revelation cane combi built an
[1:25:22] altar II worshiped about sacrifice
[1:25:24] nailed down praise God worship God then
[1:25:26] everything religious enabled and God
[1:25:28] flatly refused him because it didn't
[1:25:30] have the spiritual revelation Cain
[1:25:32] wanted to be religious so in women made
[1:25:35] his own religion and when he did he
[1:25:37] brought it before God was something like
[1:25:39] this here's the best of God this is all
[1:25:41] I can do about it take it or leave it
[1:25:45] that's about the way man there's today's
[1:25:48] and I'll help build the church I sent my
[1:25:50] children to church I'll put money in it
[1:25:52] every year that's the best I can do take
[1:25:53] it or leave it
[1:25:54] Oh see he wants his way that's the way
[1:25:56] Cain dad but look at grace but God still
[1:26:02] loved him and he still went after him
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:14] but is that the attitude we have God
[1:26:23] loves the sinner but hates the sin so to
[1:26:27] keep from getting our hands dirty we
[1:26:29] hate the sinner and the sand so we throw
[1:26:32] the baby out with the bathwater by the
[1:26:38] way there's no risk of us being
[1:26:39] contaminated you Pharisee you mean to
[1:26:49] tell me here is a hybrid a man that is
[1:26:53] half serpent and half human not even
[1:26:59] gone the book God's not obligated by any
[1:27:02] means to even reach out time but God
[1:27:06] looked at him with a Jim and he loved
[1:27:08] him Amazing Grace how sweet the sound so
[1:27:16] what do you see when you look upon
[1:27:18] humanity you see them dressing like who
[1:27:21] knows what you see them you know live in
[1:27:22] the way they are and do you look at them
[1:27:24] with love or do you like I'm blessed God
[1:27:26] they deserve to burn up they deserve yep
[1:27:28] sound like you're in the message all
[1:27:29] right that's the same attitude the
[1:27:31] prophet hadn't that little restaurant
[1:27:32] know hi God why don't you destroy this
[1:27:35] place
[1:27:36] God why don't you mean man my kids have
[1:27:38] got a he said I will tell you something
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:45] sir cause of that you remember the
[1:27:47] vision it's in the world spinning around
[1:27:49] the scenes coming up hitting Jesus in
[1:27:52] the face Lord is that the sins of the
[1:27:56] world
[1:27:57] it's the sin of the world then he seen
[1:27:59] Jesus taking right his finger on his
[1:28:01] book pardon said I forgive you that's
[1:28:05] the sins of the world Lord no limbs
[1:28:08] yours but I forgive you but you want to
[1:28:14] condemn her
[1:28:18] come on children how much easier is it
[1:28:20] and we're like John Lord do you want us
[1:28:23] to call fire down that heaven this time
[1:28:26] that was an evil spirit on John and yet
[1:28:29] that evil spirit went to the word Locke
[1:28:31] Elijah done but God looked at this
[1:28:39] mongrel this mongrel - a serpent and God
[1:28:50] looked at him with pity and maybe in the
[1:28:54] way we'd would think it poor sang look
[1:28:57] at his daddy okay poor guy and got a
[1:29:03] fight his hands so God want to have to
[1:29:06] rinse in look I didn't reveal it to you
[1:29:10] the way I did to him but if you will
[1:29:13] just do as he does except you just still
[1:29:22] what he does but there he was in church
[1:29:26] and he got hatred is the birthing canal
[1:29:37] notice whosoever looketh upon a woman to
[1:29:42] lust after her has committed adultery
[1:29:45] with her in his heart
[1:29:48] okay so adultery can be committed with a
[1:29:50] woman and never touch her physically you
[1:29:54] agree with it you can be a murderer in
[1:29:57] your heart because you pull this hatred
[1:30:05] you just never carried out you just
[1:30:08] never actually pull the trigger stab
[1:30:09] somebody beat him with a club or the
[1:30:11] rock or whatever but he know what the
[1:30:14] potential is there this is my
[1:30:19] information I will hate no makes no
[1:30:29] difference what color they are makes no
[1:30:31] difference how big they are how little
[1:30:32] they are their ethnic background
[1:30:34] the racial whatever more what they
[1:30:37] believe even if they hate me
[1:30:39] I refuse to be brought down to that
[1:30:42] level
[1:30:42] I will hate
[1:31:02] let us come back to our title love the
[1:31:06] evidence of life love the evidence of
[1:31:13] life how can you love as a human because
[1:31:17] you have life right can this pulpit love
[1:31:22] they can't love I'll bet this microphone
[1:31:25] handkerchief Bible Gatorade tree organ
[1:31:28] it's no life can you love without life
[1:31:32] neither can we love divinely will cut
[1:31:36] the new life but brother Donnie if I'm
[1:31:40] born again I've got the Holy Ghost does
[1:31:41] that mean I'll never feel that oh no no
[1:31:43] no no according to your makeup and your
[1:31:47] nature if you hated real bad in the
[1:31:49] world you may have more potential than
[1:31:51] others to hate and this ain't born again
[1:31:54] yet and Satan may attack you and he may
[1:31:58] bother you but the King Basilio the king
[1:32:02] and sound of your heart says out of here
[1:32:04] devil ain't no room for hatred in his
[1:32:07] heart
[1:32:08] your old flesh may try to ditch a second
[1:32:10] any other temptation but you fight it
[1:32:12] off and keep before you it is beneath me
[1:32:15] to act like King I am NOT King I am able
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:27] spout hits again if you win Lord Jesus
[1:32:36] righteous God
[1:32:38] I'll pray that should help each of us
[1:32:41] present those that are hearing this
[1:32:45] service or hear it later Lord God we
[1:32:49] desire this Avenue of love I've not
[1:32:56] always had it Lord for sure all of these
[1:33:00] would be honest they'll say the same way
[1:33:02] I was born in San and by nature I was a
[1:33:06] child of Wrath even as Heather's that's
[1:33:12] why we would get out and drink for those
[1:33:14] of us who did that and run around and
[1:33:16] commit adultery and think was having a
[1:33:17] big old time because our nature our
[1:33:21] nature oh but I'm so glad that you
[1:33:26] already had a plan laid before the
[1:33:29] foundation of the world if it was not
[1:33:32] for your plan there'd be no hope for any
[1:33:35] mortals to ever be saved after that
[1:33:38] mixture of Genesis 6 because what we see
[1:33:44] in that separate seed line before
[1:33:46] Genesis 6 murders polygamist bigamist
[1:33:50] liars city builders all that sort of
[1:33:54] thing after Genesis 6 we see it merging
[1:33:58] even over into the righteous so then
[1:34:02] there's no longer a pure stream David a
[1:34:05] man after your own heart yet David had
[1:34:08] your eye murdered commit adultery sheep
[1:34:14] the different things that he does the
[1:34:17] different ones we could mention how
[1:34:19] could they do that how could they act
[1:34:20] like Cain because the nature became
[1:34:24] crossed
[1:34:26] that's wife to the flood it was not
[1:34:28] necessary for Satan to find another
[1:34:30] woman and to find another serpent and to
[1:34:33] try to pregnant another woman to start
[1:34:34] another seed line
[1:34:35] the nature had now been crossed he
[1:34:39] didn't need a separate seed line in the
[1:34:41] flesh he had accomplished what he wanted
[1:34:44] the nature was now polluted so every
[1:34:49] mortal born thereafter would come to the
[1:34:52] earth with this nature so I'd see a
[1:34:56] Jacob and an e saw the one that would be
[1:35:00] natured one way one natured another come
[1:35:03] from the same mother and same father we
[1:35:07] see it too den our own families kids
[1:35:10] that we raised in the message and teach
[1:35:11] them the Word of God and they set there
[1:35:13] for years and years and heaven
[1:35:14] experience and go right on with God Lord
[1:35:16] some of these know they're experiencing
[1:35:18] with their children right now professed
[1:35:20] agnostics / deaf professed infidels
[1:35:23] don't even believe in God
[1:35:25] kids around this message to cut their
[1:35:27] teeth and message pews as we say not
[1:35:29] even sure there is a God much less that
[1:35:32] there's a prophet so we see Lord the
[1:35:36] nature is still here there's not a
[1:35:38] literal serpent seed in that sense but
[1:35:41] the nature is here and to think when I
[1:35:44] was born as a little baby boy I had that
[1:35:48] nature in me nature to lie the potential
[1:35:53] to murder to hate to destroy to be an
[1:35:57] adulterer all that laid in me but I'm so
[1:36:02] glad early that morning Lord God that
[1:36:05] little shack I was born on beside that
[1:36:07] gravel road of course I don't remember
[1:36:10] it but mom and daddy telling me that
[1:36:11] there was holes in the walls cats and
[1:36:15] dogs going out of the house didn't have
[1:36:17] to use the door because the board's just
[1:36:19] run off the house but it wasn't a dog
[1:36:23] could come in that day and when the cat
[1:36:26] but somehow neither my mama must have
[1:36:29] started getting real sweet and she's a
[1:36:30] sweet woman anyway but she must have
[1:36:33] started getting sweeter before I was
[1:36:35] born cause it's a little angel
[1:36:37] hallelujah my representation when I took
[1:36:42] the breath of life that day glory to God
[1:36:46] a representation when in thank you no
[1:36:49] God nor at the age of 12 or started
[1:36:54] something pulling on me
[1:36:55] pulling on me I'm grateful Lord I'm so
[1:36:58] grateful now went and got saved as we
[1:37:02] call it then Lord they started teaching
[1:37:05] about the Holy Ghost so I went and
[1:37:07] prayed for that I prayed and I prayed
[1:37:09] you remember that Sunday my Lord and I
[1:37:13] started speaking in tongues and I spoke
[1:37:14] in tongues through the rest of the
[1:37:15] service spoke in tongues after church
[1:37:18] daddy picked me up packed me out in the
[1:37:21] car and laid him in the seat I spoke in
[1:37:24] tongues all the way home laid me on the
[1:37:26] couch I'm still speaking in tongues
[1:37:27] Philip in the morning I thought I got
[1:37:30] the new birth but come to find out there
[1:37:34] was a Malachi 4 word burst that was
[1:37:37] waiting for me on down the road
[1:37:40] journeys been long it's been hazardous
[1:37:43] and dangerous but Lord God I thank you
[1:37:46] for where you brought me there not Lord
[1:37:47] I was born with the nature of children
[1:37:53] of Wrath oh but I'm so glad I got reborn
[1:37:57] again Lord Alleluia keep me from
[1:38:01] anything Lord this is not like you help
[1:38:05] me to love my brothers you know I've got
[1:38:08] many enemies around the world not that I
[1:38:10] want any but many people hate me they'd
[1:38:13] kill me if they could the Lord keep me
[1:38:17] above that keep me where I have no
[1:38:19] animosity in my heart toward anyone
[1:38:21] please Jesus help us to see this is the
[1:38:26] way we know we have passed from death
[1:38:28] unto life the brothers help me Lord
[1:38:35] Jesus as I mentioned a couple weeks ago
[1:38:37] I could lay down my life I could lay
[1:38:41] down my life if need be not for those
[1:38:45] that agree with me but for the man in
[1:38:47] this message that wouldn't even speak to
[1:38:49] me or wouldn't even shake my hand
[1:38:52] because it feel contaminated

[1:38:57] down my life Ram I see through these
[1:39:00] things Lord I've got some growing some

[1:39:22] you Lord maybe not take these things in
[1:39:25] a negative way and just be discouraged
[1:39:27] and down but may we take this personal
