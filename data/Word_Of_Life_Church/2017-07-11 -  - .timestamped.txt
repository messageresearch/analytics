[26:36] upright shall be blessed wealth and
[26:39] riches shall be in his house and his
[26:42] righteousness endureth forever unto the
[26:46] upright there arise if light in the

[27:10] good surely he will not be moved for
[27:14] ever let the devil say whatever he wants
[27:16] to say I don't really care this is what
[27:19] God's promises to us the righteous shall
[27:24] be in everlasting remembrance he shall
[27:28] not be afraid of evil tidings his heart
[27:32] is fixed trusting in the Lord a godly
[27:38] man let's pray together
[27:39] Heavenly Father we love you tonight
[27:41] we're so grateful Lord Jesus that these
[27:42] things we have just read they are not
[27:45] words that were just put in together
[27:46] until book fabricated by man's idea but
[27:50] we believe Lord God
[27:51] you were the one who gave these words
[27:52] and we believed that their promises not
[27:55] only to sons not only to men but to
[27:58] women as well for every child of God
[28:00] that desires for the word to be a living
[28:03] principle in their life may we take
[28:06] these things too now father may we be
[28:07] blessed by gathering together we think
[28:10] it's an honor a privilege that we can
[28:12] once again be in the house of God speak
[28:14] to us than that father from your word in
[28:16] Jesus name Amen god bless you Saints
[28:18] nice to see you again appreciates
[28:20] privilege to be in the presence of the
[28:21] Lord and your Brethren's want to be a
[28:24] fruitful man fruitful in the aspect not
[28:28] summits of just the sexual reproduction
[28:30] of your body having children having your
[28:33] bills paid and all of that but a
[28:35] spiritual fruition is to me even a more
[28:38] value than just the natural part God has
[28:41] always had poor people and there will
[28:43] always be poor people in the economy of
[28:45] God it does not mean that they're not
[28:47] fruitful people now if a person can be
[28:50] trusted with wealth and riches and all
[28:52] that sort of thing well I think that's
[28:53] about the discretion of the Almighty God
[28:55] instead of just our own choice if I want
[28:57] to be rich or I want to be wealthy but
[29:00] whenever God looks at riches it's by far
[29:03] more the riches of God are more than
[29:05] just money houses and lands and material
[29:08] things and God wants us as his children
[29:10] to be fruitful as men of God as servants
[29:14] of God whenever I say that I'm not just
[29:15] on that preachers but as sons of God God
[29:18] wants each of us to walk in the
[29:19] perspective call that God Himself
[29:22] ordained to speak we know that our
[29:24] experiences with God or even ordained by
[29:26] God himself
[29:27] you might hear of a man that prays a lot
[29:29] and I hear of another man that does this
[29:31] and walks in this certain spot you that
[29:33] blob wish I could be that way I wish I
[29:35] could have that well you know some of
[29:37] those things we can have and some of
[29:39] them we cannot the thing that we need to
[29:41] do is go to him who provides even those
[29:44] spiritual experiences and say Lord what
[29:45] can I handle maybe something like that
[29:48] maybe that man walked that close to you
[29:49] but maybe he fights so many Devils in
[29:52] order to get that I'd never be able to
[29:54] deal with the repercussion to get the
[29:56] blessing
[29:57] now if you think a person is able to
[29:59] walk in the spheres with God and walk in
[30:01] their heavenly places of God and not
[30:03] fight battles you've got another thought
[30:05] coming so whenever we're asking for
[30:07] something many times we're only asking
[30:09] for the side we see and there's another
[30:12] side that comes with that that you may
[30:14] not be able to bear and if God gave you
[30:16] that it would totally blow you away it
[30:19] would so burden you down and so worried
[30:22] you down so you know what God will keep
[30:24] that blessing from you because he knows
[30:26] the company and with that blessing will
[30:28] come a great trial that you will never
[30:31] be able to handle so sometimes when we
[30:33] ask God for things and God says no we
[30:35] ask God for things that we think would
[30:37] be our benefit and God doesn't give them
[30:40] he's actually saying no because it's for
[30:42] our good but yet in no matter whether we
[30:45] walk in the deep deep places were gone
[30:48] or whether you have to walk in a place
[30:50] that's not as deep they get in every
[30:52] position that we walk truly every one of
[30:54] asserted desire to be fruitful in that
[30:57] God called position now being in that
[30:59] the Lord Jesus desire his desire it
[31:02] brings glory to God for each of us to
[31:04] bring fruit out of our lives
[31:06] let's read if you will now Matthew
[31:08] chapter 13 verse 23 now godly man is
[31:11] going to be a fruitful man keep in mind
[31:13] also sisters as well he that received
[31:16] seed into the good ground is he that
[31:19] here is the word and now it's not enough
[31:24] just to listen to tapes it's not enough
[31:26] just to listen to your pastor preach
[31:28] you'll never be a fruit Bearer
[31:30] if you don't understand now notice is he
[31:35] that received seed into the good ground
[31:37] is he that hears the word and
[31:40] understandeth it which also beareth
[31:43] fruit now he that receives the seed into
[31:47] the good ground the difference is always
[31:50] the ground now a man can sow seed on
[31:53] this ground on that ground stony ground
[31:55] hard ground among the thorns but Jesus
[31:58] himself was the one who made the
[32:00] differentiation between the ground and
[32:01] saying that there was a certain type of
[32:03] ground that was good rent so if a man
[32:06] has good ground which is progestin ated
[32:08] earth to receive the seed in
[32:11] then the predestination of God also
[32:13] allocates to him or a certain element of
[32:16] understanding with the understanding
[32:18] coupled with the ability to receive see
[32:21] they're going to bring forth fruit there
[32:23] is no question about it bringing forth
[32:26] fruit some a hundredfold some sixty and
[32:29] some thirty now this is not thirty
[32:31] percent or 60 percent and some hundred
[32:34] percent but it's a hundredfold sixty
[32:36] fold and thirty for the man bringing
[32:38] forth thirty fold is a hundred percent
[32:40] in his capability the woman bringing for
[32:43] thirty fold is a hundred percent and her
[32:46] capability but given to her and she will
[32:49] reproduce thirty fold that don't mean
[32:51] that she's a thirty percent Christian
[32:53] she's an absolute sold out daughter of
[32:55] God now God wants us then to be fruitful
[32:59] in that of course to know that fruit
[33:00] ties in with fruit of the Spirit it also
[33:02] ties in with the manifestation of the
[33:04] Living Word for the hour that you live
[33:06] in
[33:06] now watch Jesus in Luke 8:15 but on the
[33:09] good ground again the same parable or
[33:11] they which in an honest and good heart
[33:14] having heard the word keep it and bring
[33:18] forth fruit now wants fruit with
[33:21] patience
[33:22] so fruit with patience so here the fruit
[33:25] now is coupled not only with the
[33:28] predestinated life that will force it
[33:30] out but here in this part of the way
[33:32] Luke writes it it is also coupled with
[33:34] patience which tells you and I that
[33:37] sometimes that fruit might be a long
[33:38] time coming
[33:40] it might take a lot longer than what we
[33:42] even want it to be but if we have
[33:44] patience it will bring forth the fruit
[33:46] of God what Justin st. John 15:2 every
[33:50] branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he
[33:53] taketh away speaking of the father the
[33:56] husband at every branch that beareth
[33:58] fruit he purchase it that it may bring
[34:02] forth more fruit now watch this this is
[34:05] Jesus giving the principle of bringing
[34:08] forth through every child of God this
[34:10] should be our desire to bring forth
[34:13] fruit unto the Lord is this what you
[34:15] want
[34:16] we want through to the spirit we want to
[34:18] through the message of the hour we want
[34:20] all the manifestation of God that God
[34:22] will allow us to have in our lives is
[34:24] all right now watch then if we bring
[34:26] forth through with the bringing of the
[34:29] fruit will come purging why because you
[34:32] found a fruitful branch and in order for
[34:35] that branch to remain to its full
[34:37] capacity that branch will have to be
[34:39] purged cut that this caught off of it
[34:42] that's how you mean you don't leave it
[34:44] alone and just let it go and go and
[34:46] don't know if you're bringing forth
[34:48] fruit and you'll find yourself going
[34:49] through terrible times
[34:51] y'all rejoice and thank God because if
[34:53] you look and realize there's no sin in
[34:55] your life there's no punishment for
[34:57] something you've done wrong it means
[34:59] you're going through the purging cycle
[35:01] add to the bearing forth and apparently
[35:03] the Lord looked at you and saw an
[35:05] abundance of fruit out of your life and
[35:07] he said now it's a purging time but
[35:10] don't get all down in the mouth now and
[35:12] don't kind around singing the blues
[35:13] songs that keep your heart on the
[35:16] promise and know after the purging will
[35:18] come forth more fruit just tell the
[35:21] gardener drag out more bushels because
[35:23] I'm fixing to bring forth more joy I'm
[35:26] fixing to bring forth more peace more
[35:28] long-suffering Morgan goodness - god
[35:30] this person ain't gonna wipe me out it's
[35:33] going to take away from me anything this
[35:35] contrary to the nature of God notice in
[35:41] verse 3 you are cling to the word which
[35:43] I have spoken unto you abide in me and I
[35:46] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[35:49] of itself except it abide in the vine no
[35:54] more can ye except ye abide in me now
[35:58] remember when we're talking about fruit
[36:00] fruit and the godliness has such a
[36:02] diversity because as the fruit of the
[36:04] Spirit is love joy meekness temperance
[36:05] all that but there is a fruit which
[36:08] comes forth in the manifestation of the
[36:10] word for the day that you're living with
[36:12] that will be bought couple of or Paul
[36:14] call rather fruit unto holiness so
[36:17] there's many different aspects of fruit
[36:19] but will a godly man a godly woman a
[36:22] godly boy god the girl will they bring
[36:24] forth the fruit of the Spirit
[36:26] lutely they will without without contest
[36:30] now if God gives a German man the Holy
[36:33] Ghost does God give him a German version
[36:36] of the Holy Ghost which will allow him
[36:39] to keep his German temperament his
[36:41] German nature his German whatever so as
[36:47] God gives an Iraqi the Holy Ghost says
[36:49] God give him an Iraqi version the Holy
[36:51] Ghost so when God gives us Tennesseans
[36:54] or kentuckians or Indiana's or
[36:56] Michigan's or whatever we are when God
[36:58] gives us only Ghost does he give us a
[37:00] state version the Holy Ghost does he
[37:02] given us an American version of the Holy
[37:04] Ghost or does God have one Holy Ghost
[37:06] and he gives the one to the to the
[37:08] Germans of the Swiss to the fans to the
[37:11] Indians sort of by Pakistanis whatever
[37:13] they are does all of this shooting at
[37:15] the same Holy Ghost how come we're still
[37:20] want to keep our American spirit after
[37:21] we get to Holy Ghost
[37:22] how come the Germans still want to keep
[37:25] their German ways and the fans and the
[37:27] Norwegians and make excuse why they're
[37:33] so ill-tempered and so mean if you're
[37:37] still grouchy I feel you claim you got
[37:39] to hold a ghost I hate to disappoint you
[37:41] but you never got to hold against if
[37:45] you're still me I love to ride your
[37:47] tongue you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[37:53] brother Don is back in town well the
[37:57] sheeples falling down now remember
[38:03] friends Jesus is the one who gives this
[38:05] principle we know of course it cannot be
[38:06] broken abide in me and you as the branch
[38:10] cannot bear fruit of itself this is why
[38:14] it's totally impossible for kfs and us
[38:18] any of the scribes and the Pharisees to
[38:22] a brought forth the true fruit of the
[38:25] Spirit
[38:29] they impersonated it and they had nature
[38:32] given fruit but not the genuine through
[38:35] the sphere impossible there is no way a
[38:39] devil an absolute devil could bring
[38:43] forth more fruit of the Holy Ghost than
[38:46] a son or daughter of God
[38:47] dony making sense now watch in verse 5
[38:52] I'm divining you're the branches he that
[38:54] abideth in me and I in him the same
[38:57] bringeth forth much I want to be a much
[39:04] Christian OMA for without me you can do
[39:09] nothing and the church said verse 8
[39:12] herein is my father glorified that ye
[39:16] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[39:23] disciple now we want to bring glory to
[39:25] God this is the way be good it's not by
[39:27] quoting the word it's not the hell where
[39:30] we memorize the dates and the events and
[39:32] the cities that brother Branham preached
[39:33] in order the places where Jesus preached
[39:35] that's not what glorifies God I long
[39:38] hand all that that's wonderful but
[39:40] bringing forth root out of our lives
[39:42] which only God can do the devil can tell
[39:45] you the places over there and preach is
[39:47] this the sign at the end time it was not
[39:48] so from the beginning I hear you him and
[39:51] all the devil knows exactly all of those
[39:53] dates the devil knows what day true day
[39:55] Jesus is born he knew it wasn't December
[39:57] the 25th the devil knows Christmas tree
[40:00] lights ain't got none though Jesus the
[40:02] devil knows away in a manger ain't
[40:04] nothing like people projected today he
[40:06] knows all of that he can quote all the
[40:09] facts he can call all those sort of
[40:11] things but yet that is not fruit notice
[40:17] in verse 16 you have not chosen me but
[40:19] I've chosen you I'll say glory to God
[40:23] you've not chosen me but I have chosen
[40:26] you and ordained you that you should go
[40:30] and bring forth fruit and that your
[40:33] fruit should remain so you many don't
[40:36] come and go well I got the Holy Ghost
[40:38] today and then men I lost my temper day
[40:40] before us and I cuss like a sailor
[40:41] Oh Lord I got drunk on the Holy Ghost
[40:43] Sunday night little drunk a little bit
[40:44] of Jack Daniels on wings that are that
[40:46] ain't the Holy Ghost oh no I'm not
[40:50] saying no you don't get drunk you do but
[40:51] you still drinking the same brand all
[40:53] the time it's st. John 15:16 Bay in the
[40:56] name Jack Daniels it ain't old crow it's
[40:58] the old Eagle too flew back from
[41:00] eternity to kick you act abuse up into
[41:02] the mind of God hallelujah praise the
[41:09] Lord
[41:09] now watch Paul is he twisted or shake
[41:13] a little bit different way to miss
[41:14] it that way in Causton chapter 1 verse 9
[41:16] for this cause way also since the day we
[41:18] heard it do not cease to pray for you to
[41:21] desire that you might be filled with the
[41:23] knowledge of his will and all wisdom and
[41:26] spiritual understanding that you might
[41:29] want worthy of the Lord unto all
[41:32] pleasing being fruitful in every good
[41:37] work
[41:38] Oh what kind of church would we be if we
[41:41] was this type of people been fruitful in
[41:44] every good work and increasing in the
[41:47] knowledge of God and the Saint said now
[41:52] what let's look again at Galatians
[41:54] chapter 5 verse 22 and let's watch Paul
[41:56] as he gives now the the fruit not fruits
[41:59] but fruit of the Spirit the fruit of the
[42:03] Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering
[42:07] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[42:09] temperance against such there is no law
[42:13] now there is now a nature given of every
[42:16] one of these things there is an
[42:19] impersonation for every one of those
[42:21] things that we believe in genuine
[42:23] speaking in tongues that we not we
[42:24] believe in the gifts prophesying all
[42:26] that but Satan can impersonate every one
[42:29] of those gifts as a matter of fact
[42:31] hardest time brother then tells us Satan
[42:33] can hand out then supernatural gifts by
[42:36] the
[42:36] and for not God Satan people who want to
[42:42] base their evidence of the holy ghost on
[42:44] the gifts are deceived people who want
[42:47] to base their evidence of the Holy Ghost
[42:49] on the impersonation of fruit of the
[42:51] Spirit are deceived the evidence of the
[42:54] Holy Ghost is a genuine face in the
[42:57] predestinated word for the isle that you
[42:59] live in which you cannot get on your own
[43:03] now let's look at this now Jim from the
[43:06] perspective will be looked at the last
[43:07] time we resume with this on I went out a
[43:09] couple weeks ago that brother might have
[43:11] been defending now and trying to pull
[43:13] away from those who believed that the
[43:15] mere impersonation for this fit was
[43:17] evidence of the Holy Ghost and then it's
[43:19] been taken and preached almost as if
[43:21] better men did not believe in the fruit
[43:23] of spirit at all as if though you didn't
[43:25] even need to further the spirit that
[43:27] actually was more spiritual if he was
[43:30] more mean now watch let's let's see word
[43:35] that people can get this idea you can't
[43:38] judge my speaking in tongues neither can
[43:40] you judge by the fruit of the Spirit
[43:41] it's a manifestation of the Word of God
[43:43] brought to light it's the light that
[43:46] doesn't the man that walks in the light
[43:48] Jesus Christ was not founded upon
[43:51] speaking in tongues though he did it he
[43:54] was not on through the spirit though he
[43:57] did you couldn't judge it that he
[44:00] believed and punctuated and God lived
[44:02] every one of the promise of that day
[44:04] through him that's the lie of the hour
[44:06] that's the evidence that Jesus truly was
[44:09] not a mean hateful contrary person y'all
[44:13] believe that Jesus watch this again
[44:17] Bakersfield what is the fruit of the
[44:18] Spirit love joy peace long-suffering
[44:20] gentleness goodness that right through
[44:24] the spirit many people rely on that now
[44:27] this is the fallacy this is the error
[44:29] when people try to rely on what seems
[44:34] like through the spirit he can
[44:37] impersonate that to the letter so there
[44:42] is true love and there is an
[44:44] impersonation there is true joy and
[44:48] there is an impersonation
[44:50] is true peace and there is an
[44:52] impersonation there is true
[44:54] long-suffering and there is an
[44:55] impersonation right I don't want the
[45:00] impersonation I want the real there is
[45:04] an impersonation speaking in tongues but
[45:07] I've got the rule and he's got the real
[45:10] there is an impersonation to a new verse
[45:13] but I got the real one there is an
[45:15] impersonation to being a Christian but
[45:17] I'm not an impersonator I'm a real one
[45:19] so if I'm a real Christian I've got real
[45:21] spigot and tongue I've got real honor
[45:23] that why can't I have real fruit of the
[45:26] Spirit I do and I will if I'm a
[45:30] Christian now what's this then Jesus
[45:33] came to call so they said well through
[45:35] the spirit that's what it is
[45:36] oh no not further the spirit Christian
[45:41] science has that well said brother Danny
[45:49] uh-oh Christian science has that that
[45:55] what you mean they had the true further
[46:00] spirit of Galatians 5 which can only be
[46:02] brought forth by someone that's come
[46:05] forth from the tree what's this now
[46:15] Kirsten sighs has that what I love is
[46:17] the fruit of the Spirit they have more
[46:20] love than anybody and deny the deity of
[46:26] Jesus Christ
[46:28] well it can't be perfect love because if
[46:31] it was perfectly they couldn't deny
[46:33] Jesus and it's deity but they do have
[46:37] love but it's that smothering honey
[46:39] Dewey Dewey coppiced oh it's at
[46:41] whoo-whee gooey Malaysia stuff where we
[46:44] just embrace all the gays and the
[46:46] homosexuals and you can do whatever you
[46:49] want to do and that's love I don't want
[46:50] all that hooey gooey the license is all
[46:53] right on a biscuit but it ain't good on
[46:55] a preacher
[46:57] molasses and honey's all right oh you're
[46:59] going to eat you're my brother don't
[47:00] give me no honey-coated sarin in you
[47:03] imagine trying to put honey on a
[47:05] two-edged sword
[47:09] all these preachers I go to sword
[47:11] together better not come on be honest
[47:16] it's good for spreading that soul
[47:19] denominational marjorine making
[47:21] everybody fat and sassy but brother God
[47:24] don't give me no butter knife
[47:26] God don't call his God Kolya and give
[47:28] him better knives and jam roll he gives
[47:31] on a sword he gives him the gospel
[47:33] that'll lay out and separate soul and
[47:36] spirit mama so what did his Christian
[47:46] Science people have and y'all know what
[47:49] Christian Science people believe y'all
[47:51] study at some time they believe Holy
[47:55] anything apostolic now and not they got
[48:00] more love than us as message people more
[48:04] or less than Jesus not y'all this clock
[48:10] now I can't imagine about quarter tail
[48:12] or a quarter after what it's going to be
[48:14] now watch him how he goes back now to
[48:16] the Pharisees them Pharisees some of
[48:18] them said well it's fruit of the Spirit
[48:20] I saw them Pharisees had more fruit of
[48:23] the Spirit what we call fruit of the
[48:28] Spirit oh oh
[48:31] then we could ever produce so now we've
[48:35] got a differentiation made to worry it's
[48:38] not calling by the further Spirit in
[48:40] Galatians 5:22 but by what we call
[48:43] through to the spirit so man that
[48:47] preaches horse amended preaches sharp a
[48:50] man the preachers right now where you
[48:51] live by this standard he has no love
[48:55] right but this is not the standard God's
[48:59] Word is the standard
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:02] my MA
[49:04] notice this again when their eyes are
[49:06] open then what did this guy do when he
[49:07] got attacked he turned over the many
[49:09] tables reference to Jesus of course beat
[49:12] the Mallo they're trying to keep a man
[49:13] from getting so wrought with God
[49:15] now River this is not actually facts
[49:19] brother branham is putting out a
[49:21] scenario of the way they would have
[49:24] viewed it Jesus was not trying to keep
[49:27] anybody from getting right with God but
[49:29] that's the way they did remember for his
[49:31] fruit of the Spirit was not an Old
[49:34] Testament teaching brother Bannon is
[49:37] painting a scenario in Reverse that
[49:40] furthest phil is not even told unto
[49:43] galatians 5:22 which is years I say the
[49:46] Lord Jesus come to their so the scribes
[49:48] knew nothing about it but he's setting
[49:50] up a scenario in Reverse he's going
[49:53] backwards to a teaching or for the
[49:55] spirit and said this is what the people
[49:57] would have thought about him in that day
[50:01] which is pretty much what to think about
[50:04] us today the same thing oh my what do
[50:08] you say about that God the old priest of
[50:11] yours they were a bunch of snakes
[50:14] another devil talked about through the
[50:17] spirit they had him big by long ways so
[50:24] you mean Devils has gotten more love
[50:27] than God has that Jesus was the very
[50:31] heart of God well this is getting sticky
[50:36] in it hmm what's this that's no evidence
[50:41] of the Holy Ghost you can't rely on that
[50:43] you came along the fruit of the Spirit
[50:44] because the further spirit is love and
[50:47] the Christian Science exercise more love
[50:51] than anybody I know of and it's strange
[50:57] though that he would use the word
[50:58] exercise we're not supposed to exercise
[51:03] love that's what you do the arms ain't
[51:06] it and your honor
[51:07] exercise we're not more fruit this we're
[51:10] not talking about excess or what is
[51:12] exercise manufacturing producing it
[51:16] psychologically they are exercising or
[51:19] manufacturing which leads to hypocrisy
[51:24] anybody seemed a like the rest of you
[51:28] hang on we'll get you through this
[51:29] tunnel no much he said they even denied
[51:32] Jesus Christ being divine I guess they
[51:36] would exercise more love than anybody
[51:37] knew and now listen close don't miss it
[51:39] when it comes to being fruits of the
[51:41] spirit time and gentle I guess there
[51:44] wasn't a war of those priests that would
[51:47] outshine Jesus Christ
[51:53] well maybe kissa should have been the
[51:55] gentle Lamb of God then he went to the
[52:05] temple padded ropes looked upon him with
[52:07] anger hand over the tables and run them
[52:10] out of the place my and the church said
[52:16] but how could what they have the true
[52:20] divine love and then just look at him
[52:22] and say he was nothing more than a man
[52:27] but we have so much love I'm not doing
[52:31] I'm not denied they don't have love I'm
[52:33] just a nine that they don't have the
[52:35] branch love because you can't have the
[52:37] brain love unless you're in the tree
[52:41] remember brother branham is not giving
[52:43] scriptural definitions of the Firdous
[52:47] fear he's giving a definition in the way
[52:49] people view it and this is the way they
[52:52] do it so in their eyes if Jesus would
[52:55] come in today if the Lord Jesus would
[52:57] come in today and visit the churches in
[52:59] Johnson City Kingsport and Bristol ours
[53:02] included and Jesus would preach what
[53:06] they needed they had had him out of
[53:08] there in ten minutes I hope we wouldn't
[53:11] a lot of Jesus start with the preachers
[53:15] and I mean shall come down imagine
[53:17] something Prichard run shorts to church
[53:19] and doing this and
[53:20] and some of the women dress like I don't
[53:21] know what and you think Jesus winter and
[53:23] surrounds his holy speech my he'd rip
[53:25] and tear like I don't know what what
[53:27] they weren't inviting back don't be no
[53:29] invitation coming back
[53:30] and they would think the same thing now
[53:32] look at them it's just crazy got him in
[53:35] our pulpit he blasted the pastor he
[53:37] blasted the trustee board we're not
[53:39] having him back that's exactly the same
[53:41] scenario that the Prophet is saying oh
[53:46] ma notice this in church order Jesus was
[53:49] good-natured too but when it come down
[53:51] to say things it's written he said in my
[53:53] father's house is the house of prayer
[53:55] and you're making her dinner thieves he
[53:56] knowed when to speak and when not to
[53:58] that's right now he says he's answering
[54:01] a question about the Deacons having
[54:03] people to behave in the house of God now
[54:06] this is what the advancer is to this
[54:08] question how far should we as deacons go
[54:10] to make people behave in the house of
[54:12] God this is his answer now listen this
[54:19] talk about being a deacon in the church
[54:20] he took over he planted some ropes
[54:23] together did wait to gently walk to now
[54:26] he beat them out at the house of God he
[54:31] was playing the part of the deacon the
[54:35] listen Deacon brothers don't none y'all
[54:37] bring no chords to church anybody go
[54:44] hoof on my sheeps gonna be me
[54:48] notice this was fitting for that hour
[54:50] but this is this whatever deacons
[54:52] supposed to do no there is no command
[54:55] from their own down where any apostle no
[54:58] profit no new testament prophet ever
[55:01] beat anybody else out but that was the
[55:06] word for that hour if it was needed
[55:08] today I'd be right in the middle of it
[55:10] I'd be a plant Roper buddy
[55:11] I mean I'd know how to plant them and
[55:13] I'd know how to learn cuz I want to be
[55:15] illuminated by the light of this hour
[55:16] but you know what now we do it by the
[55:19] word instead of picking up a rock Harry
[55:21] you got tell you one thing man Bam Bam
[55:24] my if I don't have to some of you they
[55:26] wouldn't be enough to bury sorry it's
[55:28] some of you all the wars you pray or you
[55:30] read your Bible that one
[55:32] me enough to put a shoebox oh my god but
[55:34] today we take the Word of God did when
[55:36] we get done with it we pour the oil in
[55:39] the wild back in the wounds to bring me
[55:41] back to fellowship with God my watch
[55:48] brother enemy says he was playing the
[55:49] part of the Deacon for an example to you
[55:51] deacons he was your example now written
[55:54] my father's house is a house of prayer
[55:56] never remember Jesus was a deacon there
[55:58] you know that Jesus was taken the part
[56:00] of the Deacon when he come to the part
[56:02] of the pastor what he said you blind
[56:04] Pharisees look lamotte's
[56:08] leaders of the blind see was taking the
[56:10] part of a pastor now watch the question
[56:13] answers see those priests were gentle
[56:16] and meek and understanding men but is
[56:22] that the only side of those priests are
[56:26] we talking about the same ones that lied
[56:29] about Jesus are we talking about the
[56:32] same ones who lied about Stephen are we
[56:34] talking about the same ones who broke
[56:36] the order of even meeting of the
[56:38] Sanhedrin on the nighttime and without
[56:41] all the Sanhedrin being there and they
[56:43] put judgment on Jesus and they brought
[56:45] one law after another after another they
[56:48] would not even go into pilots house
[56:49] being a Gentile because they did not
[56:52] want to be defiled and they lied like
[56:54] dogs they lied they absolutely all kinds
[56:58] of things against Jesus where they truly
[56:59] gentle they were not they were perceived
[57:03] gentle they were perceived to meek they
[57:06] were perceived humble but they were
[57:14] serpents
[57:18] that's right MA notice instance he says
[57:23] when he come to further the spirit they
[57:25] could show more fruits of the spirit
[57:28] than Jesus ever could
[57:34] truths true fruited nature given your
[57:42] personai shion's praise God y'all seemed
[57:47] a lot good sketch of a perfect man I
[57:50] want to say this there are some people
[57:52] have a portion of this virtue knowledge
[57:54] wisdom patience and so forth that don't
[57:59] even profess to be Christians haven't
[58:05] you missed some people that were just so
[58:06] nice and you found out that when he was
[58:08] saved and they were nicer than some
[58:10] people got a chance me my time in the
[58:13] NASA on your wife I mean your husband or
[58:15] son your kids what nature gave them that
[58:20] temperament
[58:21] that's are so nice so easy to get along
[58:24] with and then some questions were given
[58:27] a horrible human temperament Babur's
[58:31] natural verse and they deal with any
[58:34] deal and you're some sinners and the son
[58:36] is born under the genetic code they
[58:38] receive become the nature of one behind
[58:40] and they're just inferred so good until
[58:46] you cross them of course now watch I
[58:51] explains this on the set of a program
[58:52] every member is to bill in the virtues
[58:54] now what you're going to do is build the
[58:55] virtues which will be inborn by the
[58:58] Spirit of God and then he's going to put
[59:00] another pyramid on the other side and
[59:02] show that there can be one right over
[59:03] here bite they can be nature given you
[59:06] talking about a deceiver and a deceived
[59:09] person you imagine if a person had all
[59:11] of these virtues by Nature
[59:17] they can have faith and love virtue
[59:20] knowledge temperance nature by nature
[59:24] and then maybe have some person want to
[59:26] look as a man what our Christian Wow
[59:28] what a Christian there no more Christian
[59:30] than the man who's got the office temper
[59:32] that ever was unless his spirit given
[59:35] that's what God recognizes now what I
[59:40] license is he said that don't even
[59:43] professor be Christian now we're just
[59:44] teaching center school that's true
[59:46] there's some people who have a portion
[59:48] of this that don't even pretend to be
[59:50] Christians but that don't like a black
[59:53] bird trying to put peacock feathers in
[59:55] his wings to make him a peacock he only
[1:00:00] disgraces himself I've got a couple of
[1:00:06] black birds mounted in my house and I've
[1:00:09] got a beautiful blue India peacock he
[1:00:15] has all kinds of iridescent colors blues
[1:00:19] greens oculus and a craning on how the
[1:00:23] light hits him when you stand and you
[1:00:25] stay and look at him this way you see
[1:00:27] certain colors that stand over here and
[1:00:29] see certain colors in his manner Dory's
[1:00:30] stands up on a pedestal thing that I
[1:00:32] made and his tail hangs way way down his
[1:00:35] big old tales about this long now the
[1:00:38] end of his tail has all these beautiful
[1:00:40] iridescent blues and greens and blacks
[1:00:43] now what makes human and give him the
[1:00:46] ability to make is that he will stand
[1:00:48] and take those feathers and spread
[1:00:50] himself out and shake and it produces an
[1:00:53] illumination that the females will look
[1:00:56] at him and it's like it mesmerizes them
[1:00:58] in his attention and according to the
[1:01:00] colors and the spraying or all of that
[1:01:03] that's what very basically gives him the
[1:01:05] ability to reproduce himself and you
[1:01:08] imagine if I go home tonight and that
[1:01:10] that tail actually comes off it hooks a
[1:01:12] taxidermist made a word would come off
[1:01:13] so if I would go home and unhook that
[1:01:15] and I would take him over and put him on
[1:01:17] that old crow the brother Tim Pruitt
[1:01:20] sent me about Old Crow there's two of
[1:01:24] them there's one kind of mounted apart
[1:01:26] this and there's another set
[1:01:28] and they're mounted over a dead
[1:01:30] armadillo and they're picking at that
[1:01:35] dead arm Adela now you imagine how
[1:01:38] fitting it would be to put that
[1:01:40] beautiful aqua blue and green and all
[1:01:43] that oma on top of that Old Crow oh it's
[1:01:52] going to weighed him down it's going to
[1:01:54] slow him down he will be never able to
[1:01:57] eat near as much a carrot as he did
[1:01:59] before he's going to look firmer ugly
[1:02:02] he ain't going to look naturally able to
[1:02:04] be a crow Nora peacock he's a big ho I
[1:02:08] saw a lot of message folks are though
[1:02:11] they don't really belong in the world
[1:02:12] and they don't really belong here and
[1:02:16] she glad you fail where you belong Oh
[1:02:19] hallelujah I don't feel at home in this
[1:02:21] world I wouldn't make a good badness
[1:02:23] I'll make a terrible Methodist I'm
[1:02:25] making an awful Catholic I'm like a
[1:02:27] horrible presbyterian I would not
[1:02:30] measure you to tell you I would not make
[1:02:32] a good crease in science colorful but
[1:02:34] I'll make a wonderful message believer
[1:02:36] oh I would be all full of the Catholic
[1:02:40] priests I would be awful absolutist
[1:02:42] apparently but I'll make a wonderful
[1:02:45] fire that time
[1:02:46] holy ghost still a northern man a God to
[1:02:49] preach the message of the life's time
[1:02:51] [Applause]
[1:02:57] and all my feathers are groomed they're
[1:03:02] not stuck in so you see I can shout and
[1:03:06] dance and not wear the whole didn't my
[1:03:13] feathers are grown
[1:03:16] first of all but could you imagine an
[1:03:22] Old Crow Center said and a female
[1:03:33] peacock get him but she goes answered
[1:03:37] him here she comes and she walks over
[1:03:41] there she don't believe her ass here is
[1:03:51] this jet black crow but he's a cool crow
[1:03:55] because he found this peacock feather
[1:03:58] and he staggered up behind his ear like
[1:03:59] this he's a cool dude man I mean that
[1:04:03] aqua green and that blue and my he
[1:04:06] thinks he is something you imagine her
[1:04:08] going on say what in the world's a
[1:04:09] matter with you you ain't my mate let me
[1:04:12] just tell the devil you ain't my mate
[1:04:14] you trick me into that first marriage
[1:04:16] but my soul mate was aware of Jesus
[1:04:19] Christ anybody just God go on aside
[1:04:25] nature given love nature given Satan
[1:04:27] nature give and meekness he wants it to
[1:04:29] be virtue born my love em said is that a
[1:04:37] black bird trying to put peacock
[1:04:38] feathers in his wings - making a peacock
[1:04:41] he only disgraces himself you better to
[1:04:44] stay a black bird when he tries to
[1:04:46] exercise these things without being a
[1:04:47] Christian you just simply don't have a
[1:04:50] place like a sycamore tree kind of
[1:04:54] manufacturer apples couldn't do it
[1:04:57] although it's a tree with a cave
[1:04:59] manufacturer evel's what you mean by
[1:05:02] steaming same she cares over the same
[1:05:04] thought patience and so forth now
[1:05:06] there's a mockery of our pretending to
[1:05:08] be a nature given face by nature yet uh
[1:05:15] said some people have the natural
[1:05:17] ability to believe in God and yet
[1:05:19] they're not a part of God and they can
[1:05:21] receive and print many of the
[1:05:23] denominational people they're able to
[1:05:24] tap into the blessings into the
[1:05:27] financial thing and they'll break into
[1:05:29] certain
[1:05:29] suppose in there and they'll remember
[1:05:31] they'll run that thing dry and some of
[1:05:33] you said around in psyche can understand
[1:05:36] it and they get all the gravy and use it
[1:05:38] the blue John what they have a nature
[1:05:44] given faith thank your principal priests
[1:05:46] they turn the TV on us a message
[1:05:48] preacher on their ISM nothing from
[1:05:50] nothing leaves nothing so if you want to
[1:05:53] receive you got to sow a seed wonder
[1:05:56] well that's always one-sided when why
[1:05:59] they always already saw it their way
[1:06:01] but some people are doing this a man
[1:06:03] that's like that's what the word death
[1:06:04] and that natural given cytosol $20 and
[1:06:08] then they'll get that more that it's all
[1:06:09] praise God it works and they live like a
[1:06:12] devil Wow
[1:06:13] nature given face Lord Jesus a nature
[1:06:19] given faith a nature given virtue a
[1:06:22] nature given temperance this is a
[1:06:26] absolute paradox to me there's some
[1:06:29] people that even Christians got better
[1:06:32] control over their temper than some
[1:06:35] children of God but you know what these
[1:06:46] nature given people still need to be
[1:06:48] born again because they're still awesome
[1:06:51] you may look at them some Meno sucker be
[1:06:54] like that I don't know if I don't want
[1:06:55] to be or not
[1:06:55] I think I'd almost rather be the other
[1:06:58] guy at least I'll be able to acknowledge
[1:06:59] I've got a need because that nature
[1:07:01] given God he's got so much of this and
[1:07:03] so much so that he's a pretty good fella
[1:07:05] all children let me take some parents
[1:07:07] emphasize this to your kids many of our
[1:07:09] kids have got a nature given faith
[1:07:11] they've got a nature given conception
[1:07:13] the message they've got many of these
[1:07:14] nature given things and then when they
[1:07:16] run up and then they go into school and
[1:07:17] high school and college and then all
[1:07:19] this nature given sub gives way to the
[1:07:21] peer pressure lead on the Christ lead
[1:07:23] them to a new birth or see my kids a
[1:07:26] good kid that ain't enough
[1:07:27] they gotta be born again they gotta have
[1:07:30] the Holy Ghost that nature given thing
[1:07:32] will buckle under peer pressure
[1:07:35] oh ma I want to listen to this they say
[1:07:43] absolutely amazing and here do you say
[1:07:46] this is evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:47] believing his word always been in every
[1:07:49] age you can receive the word those
[1:07:51] priests had Jesus beat a million Mouse
[1:07:57] when it come to fruits of the spirit
[1:08:01] gentle peaceful meek lowly he tore up
[1:08:07] churches kicked him over told the people
[1:08:10] out called them snakes in the grass and
[1:08:12] everything that those men have more
[1:08:16] genuine furs a million miles than Jesus
[1:08:19] no this is from the perception of where
[1:08:22] he's projecting this you know Sandra's
[1:08:25] this is you got to be in the view where
[1:08:28] he's at or if you take this out you're
[1:08:30] missing apply what he said there's no
[1:08:32] way Devils can have more of the fruit of
[1:08:35] the Holy Ghost
[1:08:36] then the Holy Ghost himself but to wait
[1:08:39] people look at it oh praise be to God
[1:08:48] but you know what I find amazing when I
[1:08:53] go to study on something what I want to
[1:08:56] do is to be able to study that thing as
[1:08:57] thorough as I can in my limited ability
[1:09:00] so that I don't take 3 or 4 quotes or
[1:09:02] even four or five or five or six pages
[1:09:04] and make them quotes honor to a
[1:09:06] preconceived thought that I have or an
[1:09:09] agenda that I have I want to make sure
[1:09:11] the one I'm looking at balances itself
[1:09:14] for a false balance is an abomination
[1:09:17] the eyes of the Lord but a just weight
[1:09:19] is his delight so said Solomon The Book
[1:09:21] of Proverbs so when you go to study and
[1:09:23] anything you want to make sure that
[1:09:26] you're balancing yourself out praise the
[1:09:28] Lord now is anybody ask you about water
[1:09:30] baptism and you gave them the scripture
[1:09:32] Matthew 28:19 are you giving them a fair
[1:09:35] and balanced answer you are not you're
[1:09:38] giving them one scripture even without
[1:09:40] the understanding if they ask you about
[1:09:43] what a baptism and you say well ask you
[1:09:45] sir don't pay no tension that Matthew
[1:09:46] 28:19 you
[1:09:48] still don't understand it either a man
[1:09:50] when I first was being charged someone
[1:09:52] trying to talk to me years and years ago
[1:09:53] about then baptized the name of the Lord
[1:09:55] Jesus and this person might they knew us
[1:09:57] baptize in titles and this person kept
[1:09:59] trying though I'd rather I'd love to ask
[1:10:01] y'all do what you're going to be what
[1:10:02] Peter said and you know whether Jesus
[1:10:04] well don't know where that tell you know
[1:10:06] what I realized I'll tell you that
[1:10:07] individual that man did not have an
[1:10:09] understanding himself but you know how
[1:10:11] was led to what about his own the name
[1:10:13] of the Lord Jesus when a man was able to
[1:10:15] take Matthew 28:19 and preach acts 2:38
[1:10:19] out of that then out so this man knows
[1:10:22] what he's talking about
[1:10:23] then he wasn't and I missed no don't
[1:10:25] read that no you can't believe that but
[1:10:27] out of that very defense come the
[1:10:29] offense revealed oh God out of that very
[1:10:33] same unfolded actions are you listen now
[1:10:41] let's look at some other things that the
[1:10:44] same Prophet said about fruit of the
[1:10:45] Spirit the Lamb of the death it takes a
[1:10:48] genuine pure born-again Holy Ghost led
[1:10:51] life to prove what you are now that's
[1:10:54] right my dear brother sister unless
[1:10:56] there's a fruit the fruit of spirit is
[1:10:58] not outward demonstration watch now now
[1:11:01] one of those scribes and Pharisees
[1:11:03] showing an outward demonstration Jesus
[1:11:05] unveiled them he said you make long
[1:11:07] pretence of prayers and you devour
[1:11:11] widows houses you're like dead men's
[1:11:15] tombs you're like a silver girl that's
[1:11:17] painted on the outside but the inside of
[1:11:19] you you're full of dead men's bones now
[1:11:21] what were they saying they were seeing
[1:11:23] what was on the outside they didn't see
[1:11:25] the politics that went on behind the
[1:11:26] pool Curtis praise the Lord
[1:11:31] oh my what's this it's an inward work of
[1:11:35] grace love joy peace longsuffering
[1:11:38] goodness faith meekness gentleness
[1:11:40] patience there you are now let's watch
[1:11:44] this thought and continuity now father
[1:11:47] if they haven't got the fruit of the
[1:11:49] Spirit that keeps them day by day
[1:11:52] inconstant love forgiving their enemies
[1:11:57] making right their wrongs
[1:12:00] living peaceful and loving and sweet and
[1:12:04] kind to one another and a zeal for the
[1:12:08] church I love for Christ and for his
[1:12:12] children Oh eternal God forgive them
[1:12:23] praise the Lord
[1:12:25] notice again in Hebrews what is the
[1:12:28] fruit of the Spirit love joy peace
[1:12:29] longsuffering that's a part of God
[1:12:33] that's eat you and can forbearance
[1:12:37] forgiving one another's burdens
[1:12:38] forgiving one another as God for
[1:12:40] Christ's sake forgive you the Spirit of
[1:12:44] God in you makes you that way
[1:12:47] what brother Donny I can do that but it
[1:12:50] takes me about five years well I hope
[1:12:52] God don't accumulate your sins for five
[1:12:54] years well people hurt me and it takes
[1:12:58] me a while to get over yeah you're
[1:12:59] telling the truth it takes you a while
[1:13:01] to get over they don't take the spirit
[1:13:03] of God well go over to God by the
[1:13:05] dawning preach it amen hallelujah glory
[1:13:07] to God thank you Jesus amen come on our
[1:13:13] children let's just say the truth and be
[1:13:15] honest it's not the Spirit of God that
[1:13:18] it takes three weeks or four weeks or a
[1:13:20] month or six month to get over our
[1:13:22] patent spells
[1:13:23] it's our stinking flesh I'm glad God
[1:13:30] don't pout on us because I'd be having
[1:13:33] more patent than I would love and I'm
[1:13:35] afraid if you would - I'll go ahead and
[1:13:37] say it for you aren't you glad that when
[1:13:40] you go to him it's able to forgive you
[1:13:42] Roger
[1:13:42] can you imagine oh oh my I mean I just
[1:13:45] tell you that I'll tell you one reason
[1:13:47] why tinkle because you will not allow
[1:13:48] him to do it through you you're holding
[1:13:50] on to your daddy's way so your mama's
[1:13:52] ways or uncle Freya's ways or uncle
[1:13:54] Jack's way you better let go of uncle
[1:13:56] Jack's ways if his ways is contrary to
[1:13:58] the word let go of Uncle Fred made Suzy
[1:14:01] Dale and ain't Lulabelle and whoever the
[1:14:02] bales are and get a hold of that
[1:14:04] forgiving spirit of Christ
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:10] notice is now I'm a jumper 57 to 60 if a
[1:14:16] man's born of the Spirit of God or a
[1:14:17] woman they have the furthest sphere that
[1:14:20] won't godly remember we're talking about
[1:14:22] our godly fruitful life they want godly
[1:14:26] they live they keep away from the things
[1:14:31] of the world God listen this God moves
[1:14:34] at me and makes himself manifest and
[1:14:37] proves that he's God working in there
[1:14:39] the other is impersonating notice again
[1:14:48] are you constantly abiding in his
[1:14:49] presence with the fruit of the Spirit in
[1:14:52] your life long-suffering goodness
[1:14:55] meekness gentleness can you bear for
[1:14:59] someone to talk about you and you love
[1:15:03] them so much to your heart you pray for
[1:15:08] them or is it a selfish little prayer Oh
[1:15:12] Lord I know how to pray for him oh
[1:15:16] brother
[1:15:17] does that sweetness and the love of God
[1:15:20] O God sweep over my soul Holy Spirit
[1:15:23] sweep over myself can't you see why
[1:15:26] people want to eradicate the need of the
[1:15:29] further spirit why so we can justify
[1:15:33] them not praying for their enemies being
[1:15:37] bitter and hateful and holding grudges
[1:15:40] and being resentful and just remember
[1:15:45] when you're that way it hurts you worse
[1:15:47] than the person you're resenting because
[1:15:51] it'll grieve the Holy Ghost away from
[1:15:52] you exactly right notice this again in
[1:15:55] Galatians 5 you said the further the
[1:15:57] spirit love joy peace long-suffering
[1:15:58] meekness gentleness patience these are
[1:16:01] not to be manufactured there to be
[1:16:04] products that comes from the inside out
[1:16:09] notices now the outside life that we
[1:16:12] live proves what's on the inside so the
[1:16:16] reason that old crone on has my feathers
[1:16:19] is because he has a crow life the reason
[1:16:23] that indigo peacock has beautiful blue
[1:16:25] feathers is because my seed is an indigo
[1:16:30] blue peacock the reason you are a child
[1:16:34] of God and you can forgive other folks
[1:16:36] and other people look at you so how in
[1:16:38] the world can you do that because you're
[1:16:40] a thought of God you like your father
[1:16:42] how can they hold grudges cuz they don't
[1:16:45] have what you have
[1:16:46] oh my notice this we have tried to
[1:16:56] manufacture this to manufacture the
[1:17:01] fruits of the spirit now what you listen
[1:17:04] to the results and we always turn out
[1:17:08] hypocrisy because you cannot manufacture
[1:17:16] Christianity praise the Lord it's an
[1:17:22] experience by spirit that lives in you
[1:17:24] and bears fruit of itself so how could
[1:17:27] calluses then have all fruit of the
[1:17:30] Spirit genuine further spirit and him be
[1:17:32] a devil he could he had what people
[1:17:35] perceived was such now we would bow
[1:17:41] radio spot here in Johnson City and some
[1:17:43] of these local stations and we would put
[1:17:45] my wins in our sermons say let's pick
[1:17:48] the ones on let me say I think a good
[1:17:50] one to start with Obi one I've preached
[1:17:52] several years ago Christmas in Sodom
[1:17:58] and then what we'll do we will air it in
[1:18:00] between some of the Baptist preachers
[1:18:02] and some of the masses and next to the
[1:18:03] Catholic and I wonder what the people
[1:18:05] now the world would say who had the most
[1:18:07] love it wouldn't be me of course can you
[1:18:12] imagine just a series that I just did on
[1:18:14] modesty and apparel and all that and I
[1:18:16] would put that on television or radio as
[1:18:18] my photos a brother message it has a
[1:18:20] television station in a nation away from
[1:18:23] here and it written about our videos and
[1:18:25] said well why don't you let us put them
[1:18:26] on as a brother I don't I don't think so
[1:18:29] I don't think I'm a type of Persia I
[1:18:31] don't think I mean you imagine John the
[1:18:33] Baptist been on video okay I won't tell
[1:18:36] you that
[1:18:38] I just got me I'm not the TV guy I don't
[1:18:46] belong in Houston I'm over here
[1:18:48] we got 90 thousand or how many ever
[1:18:51] they've got that's not me that's on me
[1:18:55] could you turn I just have me and that
[1:18:57] guy got no love yet you adherent said
[1:18:59] that man I never have said under passion
[1:19:01] my life that shows me so much others
[1:19:03] that you're writing you don't know what
[1:19:05] love is no you don't know what love is
[1:19:07] because real hobby is corrected after
[1:19:10] the house we have none look at our young
[1:19:18] girl sitting around here
[1:19:22] how could you mothers not yours and not
[1:19:26] allowed to warn miniskirts to church
[1:19:28] how could you mother's love your girls
[1:19:30] I'm not allowed to wear makeup and paint
[1:19:33] up like a
[1:19:35] you don't love them compared to the
[1:19:38] world but compared to God you do
[1:19:42] why do we do our girls that way because
[1:19:45] that's the way he does his girls now the
[1:19:48] devil that's his girls dress up like
[1:19:50] Jezebel he left some men do anything and
[1:19:53] everything they wanted her because
[1:19:54] that's the way the devil does the devil
[1:19:56] is not love the devil Kate love but God
[1:19:58] is love and God corrects and God whips
[1:20:02] and God tells the truth in an amazing by
[1:20:11] the rim says whenever we get to that day
[1:20:12] and we'll all set across the table we'll
[1:20:14] look at one another there we'll set them
[1:20:16] battle-scarred veterans and we'll reach
[1:20:19] across the table take hold one of the
[1:20:21] sins will set on crime you can wipe the
[1:20:24] tears that ever has in an amazing that
[1:20:26] will not sit there with any whip marks
[1:20:33] but I wonder in reality then I get more
[1:20:37] battle scars in life or did I get more
[1:20:39] weapons from him I'm talking about more
[1:20:42] than likely I got more weapons than that
[1:20:45] did battle scars but since it's a
[1:20:47] coronation and a crowning of the king
[1:20:49] and a beginning of a new empire my whip
[1:20:54] marks would be under coming to an
[1:20:56] overcomer so somehow I lose my whip
[1:21:01] marks from him I lose my spank marks but
[1:21:05] he lets me sit down there to table with
[1:21:08] my battle scars as if though I was a
[1:21:11] battle-scarred veteran a whole time with
[1:21:15] in reality I was a poor feeble child
[1:21:18] that had to be corrected week by week
[1:21:21] spanked week by week but he don't want
[1:21:25] me to be empire see though we're here to
[1:21:26] be a better so instead of setting our
[1:21:28] Whitmarsh where'd you get that one that
[1:21:30] i disobeyed the Lord he bruised me would
[1:21:32] you get back out of disobeyed the Lord
[1:21:34] Oh sister the only word you get down
[1:21:36] that was here outstanding where'd you go
[1:21:37] then was this and that was it all my now
[1:21:40] we said battle scar as if though my we
[1:21:43] were hardened soldiers from the burst
[1:21:45] hardened soldiers from the beginning and
[1:21:47] there were several scars
[1:21:52] you told my grace oh Jesus
[1:21:59] Lord Jesus notices question-answer 61
[1:22:04] what kind of life is in you the life
[1:22:07] it's in it bear stickers always fussing
[1:22:12] cutting up real mean and ill you see
[1:22:18] what I mean arrogant that's not the
[1:22:20] fruit of the Spirit but some of God's
[1:22:28] children got this by nature
[1:22:31] smart-mouthed arrogant ill they can't
[1:22:36] even say good weren't hurting nobody
[1:22:39] what's amazing is when he dispersed set
[1:22:42] predestinated seed will be predestinate
[1:22:45] seeds fell down a nettle mineral water
[1:22:52] in God lettuce seed fall down in there
[1:22:56] it lives like a devil from how many
[1:22:59] years God burst it and a watering thing
[1:23:04] is still there that'll cocklebur on the
[1:23:05] outside but that new life for me so
[1:23:07] don't do this to me quit don't beat me

[1:27:01] this is sycamore you'll see some more
[1:27:03] around my soul seeking more he's gonna

[1:28:01] red lights about two two quotes below
[1:28:03] where you are there paragraph 166 I know
[1:28:07] that someday I've got to die and I hope
[1:28:09] that God never lets Satan crown me as an
[1:28:16] old kravid indifferent man and my wife

[1:28:28] crown for many people he didn't say she

[1:30:19] coming three months after the seals have
[1:30:23] been opened I like to do some sometime
[1:30:28] those we like to say to the message
[1:30:30] setting say many times brother man

[1:31:18] few peacock feathers out of the message
[1:31:20] apparently and been able to stick a few
[1:31:22] in there and they could wear their long
[1:31:24] robes and their phylacteries
[1:31:26] that made long prayers which when you
[1:31:29] look at that instead yeah we'll get to
[1:31:30] sometime later but it meant they prayed
[1:31:32] three times a day in sessions of three
[1:31:35] hours nine hours a day they began with
[1:31:45] 45 minutes of meditation than an hour of
[1:31:47] prayer then another 45 minutes of
[1:31:49] meditation and finishing with prayer
[1:31:51] three times a day but Jesus said you
[1:31:57] blind guides you stand in the way and

[1:36:12] factory running time to produce love
[1:36:16] trying to produce joy trying to produce
[1:36:18] this and that but failure after failure
[1:36:22] it led me to realize I could not
[1:36:25] manufacture any of them I have to let go
[1:36:28] and let God Lord Jesus help us help us
[1:36:35] that it'll be so easy from the soul to
[1:36:40] live this kind of life
[1:36:42] it's just as easy for a child of God to
[1:36:45] live this life is it is a sinner to live
[1:36:49] yourself Thank You Laurel father we come
[1:36:55] to the time of the year that many years
