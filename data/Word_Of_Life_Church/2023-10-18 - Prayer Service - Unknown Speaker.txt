situation that tug of war at [Music] me all day long I struggle for the answers that I need but then I come into His presence and all my questions become clear and in that sacred [Music] moment no

[Music] provide a place for us to [Music] rest a place to you find the aners in our hour of distress now there's never any reason for us to give up in despair just slip away and breathe his name he will surely meet you there in the presence of jeh God Alm Mighty Prince of Peace my Tres Manish hearts are me [Music] in the pr of the king in the [Music] Pres oh oh God all [Music] Mighty prin TR oh heart [Music] areed in [Music] the of the king in the presence of the [Music] [Applause] king praise the lord we greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus and we're gathered here people with mixed emotions in our heart and one part of it we Rejoice because our sister has made it safely home no more suffering no more pain no more battling a demon called cancer safely In the Arms of Jesus this evening and yet another part of our hearts is sad because it Le an empty place and so we gather here as a people and you can just you can sense it in in the building you can sense and you think did did did we fail we prayed we we we believed and was our faith not good enough no friend that's not the case at all you see when I was in the Army we had a general order and we had a direct order and general order would be like if you pass an officer you salute him that's a general order that you just done that if you didn't do that they'd write you up they'd find you but then there would come a direct order that is like in combat you wouldn't salute an officer because the enemy would see that that was an officer and they would try to take him out that was a direct order and so our general orders was you pray for the sick you believe you lay hands on them they shout that's our general orders and we done those we carried out those orders that God left for us but there come a direct order from God that said it's time for my daughter to come home and that supersedes all general orders so you say well did we no we didn't fail and we're not sad tonight because we feel like God failed us we're just sad because of the empty place that's left in our hearts and you know death is not something that's new new to this church there's people sitting here who's lost mothers myself we've buried my father my mother my brother my father-in-law my sister-in-law many of you brother Joel's mother pass others here brother Lily different ones so death is not something that's new to this church and all the Death that we've dealt with here we've had a pastor and a family who's Comfort us they've come to our homes and they've prayed for us and they've encouraged us and now it's time for us to comfort them it's time for us to repay and so tonight you know we could have took a sermon and preached but I talked to Brother JD and I said you know I think it would be good if we would just get together come together as a family of God and just have a little time of prayer and so I feel like tonight that that's Brother JD said you know I was thinking the same thing and so tonight I think it would be good for us just to take this service to pray together and to pray for the brother rean and his family brother Parker and his family brother Scotty and sister Alicia the Babs and pray for one another for in the days ahead we're going to need each other more and more and more you see what's happening to Israel where it looks like there's enemy on every side of them they parallel us friends we Paul said there's trouble on every side not just one side but every side and we've never needed each other like we need each other now and so tonight I just want to take this time for prayer and you want to brother Larry's going to play some soft music you want to pray here at the altar you're welcome you want to kneel right there in your chair where you're at you're welcome to do that too and if you want to pray 5 minutes 10 minutes 20 minutes or an hour it's totally up to you there's nobody here it's not a measuring Rod to see who can pray the longest that's not what it's about but but it's just a time that we can come together as a family and pray for one another and pray for brother rean and him because how many prayers has he prayed for us would that be all right tonight amen so that's what we want to do and when you're finished praying and you feel like you've prayed what's on your heart there there'll be no formal dismissing so you don't have to get up and wait you can just get up and slip out and remember the uh services this weekend I think the viewing will be at 11: the funeral will be at 1: and then the graveside service will follow that over at the Happy Valley Cemetery I think that's I think that's right but do you love him tonight isn't it wonderful to to be a where would we be friends when we deal with things like this if we didn't have the Lord and you know one thing that always comforted me when we dealt the loss of of brother Homer and Rachel you know 8 8-year-old and and brother bam talks about that a girl that he dated when they were young and I think she had married some maybe a minister or something like that say she's a Godly girl and brother Brenham was away at a meeting and she had took sick and passed and brother Brenham says I believe it's in the adoption series my memory serves me right but brother Brenham said that he said I slipped down to the funeral home before the crowd just to pay my respects to her and he said when I went beyond the curtain of time he said I saw her over there there's a land beyond the river FR and we are a people who have a hope that we plant our loved ones he will raise them up again and we will all Gather in at Daddy's house and sit around Daddy's table and he'll wipe the tears from her eyes you you see he's a man the Bible said he's a man acquainted with sorrow grief he knew what it was he wept at the grave of Lazarus so he understands tonight what we feel so let's just let's just sing a little Little Chorus and then if you want to come to the altar you're welcome to come and pray here at the altar if you just want to kneel there in your seat and like I said just pray as long as you want to pray and when you feel like you've prayed enough you you're welcome just to slip out and may the Lord richly bless you do you love him tonight amen amen let's just sing that song a course of that again in his presence in The Presence of Jehovah amen in the [Music] presence of Je God almightyy Prince of [Music] Peace Tres vanish our hearts are mening in the [Music] presence of the [Music] king hallelujah amen brother if you want this place something softly brother folks are just welcome like I said you want to come around the altar or just right there where you're at just if you want to pray out loud you want to pray silently however you feel comfortable may the Lord bless you richly
