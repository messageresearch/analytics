[2:17:18] Believers from around the world has
[2:17:21] stood by wept many tears and today on
[2:17:24] their behalf I want to convey to you
[2:17:27] alone all bears are Justin ra the Bible
[2:17:30] said of saints like Erica in Hebrews
[2:17:33] 11:13 that these
[2:17:37] all promises but Haven seen them a far
[2:17:41] off and were pers of them and embraced
[2:17:44] them and confessed that they were
[2:17:46] strangers and P pilgrims on the earth
[2:17:49] and as a member of the bride of Christ
[2:17:51] she's identified also in this statement
[2:17:54] I take this from God of this evil age
[2:17:57] but in obedience this little faith woman
[2:18:01] that lives by faith the bride this
[2:18:03] person here there here somewhere else
[2:18:07] off some other Church some other
[2:18:09] denomination whatever it is believes the
[2:18:11] word of God obedient waiting in love for
[2:18:15] the promise of the AIDS to be con
[2:18:17] confirmed she is watching for it she is
[2:18:20] part of the word and she is watching for
[2:18:23] her life to manifest that word you see
[2:18:27] Erica waited and believed for the
[2:18:29] promise here and now she waits for his
[2:18:33] fulfillment with the Saints there it's
[2:18:36] it's difficult very difficult when we
[2:18:39] come to moments like these or sincere
[2:18:42] and Earnest prayers were made and yet
[2:18:45] the results were were not what we
[2:18:48] believed and hoped for not having
[2:18:52] received the promise but yet Believers
[2:18:55] see them and even though they seem a far
[2:18:58] off as something there that they just
[2:19:01] can't grasp or take they embrace them
[2:19:04] and their confession with their
[2:19:07] confession they show that there are
[2:19:08] strangers upon this Earth and that
[2:19:11] they're not of this world no matter what
[2:19:14] comes their faith never wavers
[2:19:18] did we
[2:19:20] believe well with all our hearts we
[2:19:22] believed did we embrace the truth that
[2:19:25] God heals and heals even cancer yes we
[2:19:30] Embrace that truth we held it close to
[2:19:33] our hearts we clung to it believing did
[2:19:37] God even hear our hearts cries Psalms 58
[2:19:42] says you keep track of all my sorrows
[2:19:46] you have collected all my tears in your
[2:19:49] bottle you have recorded each one in
[2:19:52] your book you've kept track of my every
[2:19:56] toss and turn through the sleepless
[2:19:59] nights each tear entered into your
[2:20:02] Ledger each ache written in your book
[2:20:07] well if God heard then what was wrong
[2:20:10] with our faith well then we have to ask
[2:20:13] the question really what is faith faith
[2:20:17] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[2:20:21] and we embraced and we took hold of the
[2:20:24] promise of Divine Healing that our God
[2:20:27] heals and our God delivers we along with
[2:20:31] Erica clung to every promise and we
[2:20:34] wouldn't let it go right to the very end
[2:20:37] of life and like her we were adamant and
[2:20:40] unshakable we testified we confessed and
[2:20:44] yes we believed this is Faith and there
[2:20:49] was nothing wrong with it it was
[2:20:53] unwavering it was righteousness it was
[2:20:57] pure and holy and it pleased God we have
[2:21:01] done what God wanted us to do it is his
[2:21:06] will for us to believe and to confess
[2:21:09] and to stand firm with faith believing
[2:21:12] and this makes God proud and his heart
[2:21:15] glad to see a people Sons and Daughters
[2:21:18] who will stand firm believing and then
[2:21:21] when God delivers in a way that we
[2:21:24] didn't want or we didn't expect we love
[2:21:28] and we believe him
[2:21:30] anyway today even when we look death in
[2:21:33] the face we continue to do it with great
[2:21:37] faith we will continue to fight the good
[2:21:41] fight of faith we will war against sin
[2:21:45] we will war against evil of every kind
[2:21:48] we will continue to war against demons
[2:21:50] of sickness we will war against cancer
[2:21:55] and against every kind of sickness and
[2:21:57] disease that comes against us we have
[2:22:01] not lost Erica did not die faithless but
[2:22:05] a woman full of Faith she entered into
[2:22:08] the Arms of Jesus she declared victory
[2:22:12] in the face of death and some of our
[2:22:15] last words were Satan you have messed up
[2:22:19] up her faith never wavered her
[2:22:22] confidence in the Lord never ceased she
[2:22:25] fought and she won the cancer she warded
[2:22:29] with is dead but she is still living she
[2:22:34] is a warrior and a hero of
[2:22:39] Faith
[2:22:44] Hallelujah we prayed and we prayed for
[2:22:47] the cancer to die well today the cancer
[2:22:51] is dead every Cancer cell in her body
[2:22:55] perished but not Erica she is more alive
[2:23:00] than ever she is not less alive she is
[2:23:04] more alive she didn't get less of Jesus
[2:23:08] she got more of Jesus she stepped into
[2:23:11] the realm of perfect love into the
[2:23:13] presence of the Lord into a perfect body
[2:23:17] amen DL Moody said soon you will read in
[2:23:21] the newspaper that I'm dead but don't
[2:23:24] you believe it for a moment I will be
[2:23:27] more alive than ever before on his
[2:23:30] deathbed he said Earth recedes and
[2:23:33] Heaven opens for me you see Erica looked
[2:23:36] to God with a Resolute faith for healing
[2:23:39] she believed God heals all
[2:23:43] diseases amen even cancer Deuteronomy
[2:23:47] 7:15 says and the Lord will take away
[2:23:50] from you all sickness and will afflict
[2:23:53] you with none of the terrible diseases
[2:23:55] of Egypt which you have known I want you
[2:23:58] to take notice this no sickness is from
[2:24:02] God he said he takes away sickness not
[2:24:07] that he brings it he promised that he
[2:24:09] would not afflict us with any of the
[2:24:12] terrible diseases of Egypt all sickness
[2:24:16] is from the de
[2:24:17] God did not bring it but he will take it
[2:24:20] away it is a foreign life a demonic life
[2:24:24] and as Believers we have the right and
[2:24:27] authority to cast it out faith is a
[2:24:30] super sense that you use because of the
[2:24:33] Life of Christ within you it comes from
[2:24:36] your new birth when FF Bosworth was sent
[2:24:40] by the spirit to pray for the sick he
[2:24:43] asked Lord but suppose I preach healing
[2:24:46] and the people come and they don't get
[2:24:48] healed and the Lord responded if people
[2:24:51] didn't get saved would you wouldn't stop
[2:24:53] preaching the gospel of Salvation would
[2:24:55] you amen you see as as we think of this
[2:24:59] we realize we have a responsibility to
[2:25:03] to believe in the hour of Crisis no
[2:25:06] matter the outcome because he heals all
[2:25:10] diseases amen and and I want you just to
[2:25:14] consider the four living creatures
[2:25:15] Before the Throne which the anointing
[2:25:17] comes for deliverance in the Book of
[2:25:20] Revelation the four living creatures of
[2:25:22] the lion the calf the man and the eagle
[2:25:25] are all the Holy Spirit of anointings
[2:25:29] and each face is a different aspect of
[2:25:32] the Holy Spirit and and of his power of
[2:25:35] Deliverance and as we pray God responds
[2:25:38] to our faith by looking our way with the
[2:25:42] facet of his Deliverance when the lion
[2:25:45] anointing of um empowers a person's
[2:25:49] faith it is a boldness and a great
[2:25:52] courage with tentious tenacious fight
[2:25:56] for healing the faith that are never
[2:25:59] backed down the eagle anointing is is
[2:26:03] the miracle it is like the Rapture that
[2:26:07] oh you know once you're deathly eel and
[2:26:10] the next moment there's no symptom or
[2:26:12] sign of it the man
[2:26:15] anointing
[2:26:17] it is still God healing but he uses the
[2:26:20] intelligence of a man yeah God will use
[2:26:23] surgeons and medicines with knowledge
[2:26:26] that came from him for his healing work
[2:26:28] and if there are any of you nurses and
[2:26:31] doctors here today that was that was an
[2:26:34] aid and blessed us in this moment of
[2:26:37] Crisis we want to thank you for being
[2:26:39] here and being a part of God's healing
[2:26:42] work but if the ox anointing looks your
[2:26:46] way it's death but God heals even in
[2:26:51] death whatever way God responds it's all
[2:26:56] healing because he will heal you even if
[2:26:58] it's taking you into another dimension
[2:27:01] there is not a disease that God does not
[2:27:05] heal healing is yours by the
[2:27:08] atonement the question that we often
[2:27:12] Ponder is why why would God take
[2:27:17] a little life that was so precious and
[2:27:20] so sweet why would
[2:27:23] Jesus why would he jerk her suddenly out
[2:27:27] of her loved one's
[2:27:28] arms well that's not the God that I know
[2:27:31] and it's not the god of the Bible but
[2:27:34] this is something though that many
[2:27:36] misunderstand about God they think of
[2:27:38] him as some heartless God that would rip
[2:27:41] a family apart but rather when Erica's
[2:27:46] little house could no longer sustain her
[2:27:50] because it was broken down by illness
[2:27:53] Jesus was there to receive her and to
[2:27:56] give her complete health and a new house
[2:27:59] not made with hands one that this
[2:28:02] Earthly body at best only reflected a
[2:28:07] poor image
[2:28:08] of when God made this Earth he made it a
[2:28:13] paradise everything he made was good God
[2:28:17] is not the author of death God is the
[2:28:20] author of life but when man Sinn to the
[2:28:23] Earth and defiled his Purity it was God
[2:28:26] who went immediately to work to bring
[2:28:30] reconciliation to man and all this time
[2:28:34] since man's fall God has been working to
[2:28:37] bring Heaven back to man again and
[2:28:40] almost in the same instance of the Fall
[2:28:43] God released a plan that he would come
[2:28:45] as a seed the seed of a woman who would
[2:28:48] bruise the head of the serpent and
[2:28:52] deliver man from the fear and the
[2:28:54] bondage of death that's why Jesus came
[2:28:57] when man couldn't keep bring couldn't
[2:28:59] bring Heaven upon the Earth nor could go
[2:29:02] to heaven God came to Earth and brought
[2:29:05] Heaven down and while upon the Earth
[2:29:07] Jesus showed his plan of reconciliation
[2:29:10] every and everything he did when he
[2:29:12] attended funerals he raised the dead he
[2:29:16] opened the eyes of the blind to show he
[2:29:18] restores the sights he healed the leper
[2:29:21] to show he is Lord over the most dreaded
[2:29:25] diseases and this brings us to the
[2:29:28] shortest verse of the
[2:29:30] Bible in John
[2:29:33] 1133 when Jesus came along with Lazarus
[2:29:37] when Lazarus was dead and he saw Mary
[2:29:41] and Martha
[2:29:42] weeping he also came and groaned in the
[2:29:45] spirit and was troubled
[2:29:47] and he asked where have they laid him
[2:29:49] and they said Lord come and see and the
[2:29:51] Bible said Jesus
[2:29:54] wept now Jesus knew he was dead he had
[2:29:57] told his disciples he
[2:30:00] sleeps and this well if he sleeps he's
[2:30:03] doing good he said no he's dead and I go
[2:30:06] to waking he already knew he would
[2:30:08] resurrect him but there's no record that
[2:30:11] he went crying and weeping along the way
[2:30:14] so as he goes to the tomb of Lazarus he
[2:30:18] already knows he's going to have this
[2:30:21] great Victory and Lazarus is going to
[2:30:24] raise from the dead so why weep
[2:30:30] now perhaps he groan with humanity and
[2:30:34] Mourns with them at their loss and their
[2:30:37] deep sorrow truly I want you to know
[2:30:41] this God is a compassionate God who
[2:30:44] Sorrows when we sorrow
[2:30:46] who hurts when we hurt who feels our
[2:30:50] pains and I tell you he Comforts us in
[2:30:54] our time of
[2:30:55] Sorrow he Comforts those that mourn
[2:30:59] perhaps he groaned within himself
[2:31:03] because he knew that death didn't have
[2:31:06] to happen to man that funerals and
[2:31:09] graveyards were never in his plan and
[2:31:13] won't be in the new world to come he had
[2:31:16] made Adam and placed him in paradise and
[2:31:18] man didn't have to know evil and Sorrows
[2:31:21] of pain and suffering and
[2:31:23] death perhaps he
[2:31:25] wept perhaps the reason that he
[2:31:28] wept that Jesus knew the joys of
[2:31:32] Heaven's
[2:31:33] Paradise that Lazarus was now
[2:31:36] experiencing and he had to call him back
[2:31:39] to this Shadow land that we live in this
[2:31:43] place that is so inferior to that one
[2:31:46] perhaps he wept because he had to bring
[2:31:49] Lazarus back to a body that would get
[2:31:51] sick and die again to a world full of
[2:31:55] evil and
[2:31:56] trouble maybe perhaps that's why he
[2:32:00] wept I
[2:32:02] think I think he truly wept realizing he
[2:32:07] would have to bring him back here that
[2:32:10] he would have to live upon this life a
[2:32:13] little longer you see he made a for us
[2:32:17] and Paul would tell us you know of his
[2:32:20] visitation there it's so wonderful words
[2:32:22] I don't have words or vocabulary to
[2:32:24] describe it and Jesus said I know what
[2:32:28] heaven is like in my father's house or
[2:32:32] many
[2:32:33] mansions in the past four days Lazarus
[2:32:36] body a body so sick it would no longer
[2:32:38] hold life had been wept over and
[2:32:42] lovingly in
[2:32:43] tuned but Lazarus was not dead dead he
[2:32:47] was still alive all this time and after
[2:32:50] his final difficult breath here he was
[2:32:53] living on a body that could no longer be
[2:32:56] touched by death or pain a body that is
[2:33:01] a mansion compared to this one this body
[2:33:04] at best is described as a pest house
[2:33:08] full of rats Vermin and diseases a body
[2:33:12] of
[2:33:13] humiliation no wonder Jesus
[2:33:17] wept there that place he had to call
[2:33:20] Lazarus from in that place there is no
[2:33:23] more Struggle No More Sorrow no more old
[2:33:27] age no more infant of days no young
[2:33:30] mothers dying no more hunger no more
[2:33:34] worry no sickness No More Death no
[2:33:38] wonder Jesus
[2:33:40] wept for 4 days Lazarus had experienced
[2:33:44] love and joy beyond measure
[2:33:46] a body so
[2:33:48] Superior to this mortal flesh he was
[2:33:52] there meeting and being with Saints and
[2:33:54] Friends of the present and ages past no
[2:33:58] wonder Jesus wept to have to bring him
[2:34:02] back no
[2:34:04] doubt as we have had friends and
[2:34:07] relatives come by and shake hands and
[2:34:10] greet and we give our well wishes and
[2:34:14] our words to our loved ones here
[2:34:16] no doubt there was a land in that Land
[2:34:20] There was a huge procession each one
[2:34:23] waiting to grasp her hand to hug her
[2:34:26] neck to welcome her in let me tell you
[2:34:30] those who have went over on the other
[2:34:32] side and come back don't want to come
[2:34:35] back here they said no don't let me have
[2:34:38] to return today arica would not want to
[2:34:41] come back she is there in the presence
[2:34:44] of the Lord where there is perfect
[2:34:47] love where and and it's clear to us that
[2:34:51] Jesus made a path to to life and from
[2:34:55] Death he said I go to prepare place and
[2:34:59] it will be heaven for you so that when
[2:35:02] your mortal frame can no longer sustain
[2:35:04] life I will receive you that where I am
[2:35:09] you may be also Erica a woman of faith

[2:47:56] service may God bless
[2:48:00] you we are gathered here to pay our
[2:48:03] respects to sister Erica Lee Reagan
[2:48:07] Parker to each of us here sister Erica's
[2:48:10] life meant something she was a friend a
[2:48:14] daughter a wife a mother a niece a
[2:48:18] sister a sister-in-law a sister in
[2:48:22] Christ and her life has somehow touched
[2:48:24] our lives and her graduation from this
[2:48:27] life has brought us here together this
[2:48:30] afternoon and though our hearts are
[2:48:32] heavy we do not mourn as those who have
[2:48:35] no
[2:48:37] hope we have been given a
[2:48:39] revelation that death is only a carriage
[2:48:42] that takes a Believer into the presence
[2:48:44] of their God
[2:48:46] David said in the Book of Psalms
[2:48:47] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[2:48:49] death of his Saints for death is only
[2:48:52] another way that God has to bring his
[2:48:54] children
[2:48:57] home in the world we live in
[2:49:00] today we have all kinds of Heroes
[2:49:03] there's Sports Heroes there's military
[2:49:06] Heroes there's even what they call in
[2:49:08] comic strips in movies superheroes a
[2:49:11] Batman and a Superman a Wonder Woman
[2:49:14] woman super
[2:49:16] girl even the Bible speaks of Heroes in
[2:49:19] Hebrews chap 11 as brother Tim referred
[2:49:22] it's known as The Heroes of Faith who
[2:49:25] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[2:49:27] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[2:49:29] the mouths of lions quenched the
[2:49:32] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[2:49:33] sword out of weakness was made strong
[2:49:36] waxed vient and fight turned to flight
[2:49:38] the army of the aliens women received
[2:49:41] their dead raised to life again others
[2:49:43] were tortured not accepting Deliverance
[2:49:46] that they might obtain a better
[2:49:48] Resurrection others had trial of cruel
[2:49:50] mockings and scourgings a moreover bonds
[2:49:53] of imprisonment they were stoned they
[2:49:55] were saw aunder were tempted were slain
[2:49:58] with a sword they wandered about in
[2:50:00] sheep skins and goat skins being
[2:50:02] destitute Afflicted tormented of whom
[2:50:05] the world was not worthy Heroes of the
[2:50:11] faith so just for a few minutes of your
[2:50:13] time this afternoon
[2:50:16] I like to speak about another
[2:50:21] hero this hero never wore a ball Jersey
[2:50:24] or played on the great
[2:50:26] iron they never wore a military uniform
[2:50:29] F on a foreign
[2:50:30] Battleground they never wore a hero's
[2:50:33] costume and never flew through the air
[2:50:35] or leaped over tall
[2:50:37] buildings but this hero I wish to speak
[2:50:39] about was a petite little
[2:50:43] woman named Erica Lee Reagan
[2:50:46] Parker a warrior of Faith who from the
[2:50:50] time she was a little girl she fought a
[2:50:52] battle for her
[2:50:54] health but I remember when Erica was
[2:50:57] little she was a lively
[2:50:59] one feisty if you will determined and
[2:51:03] courageous I heard someone say
[2:51:06] Fearless brother Jeremy Asher was
[2:51:08] telling us the other night that he used
[2:51:10] to sing when brother Jeremy was a little
[2:51:11] boy he'd sing about with his mouth about
[2:51:13] that wide open and he said sister ER
[2:51:16] used to S to church while he was singing
[2:51:19] she would mock him just do her mouth
[2:51:20] like that sister car said if I'd have
[2:51:23] seen her do that I'd have wore her
[2:51:27] out amen I can still see her in my mind
[2:51:30] coming into church as a little girl she
[2:51:33] was a fasty one for
[2:51:35] sure and as she grew into a young
[2:51:37] teenager she gave her heart to God at
[2:51:40] about the age of 11 or 12 received the
[2:51:42] Holy Ghost became a devout Christian she
[2:51:46] married Lance
[2:51:48] Parker and even though she battled with
[2:51:50] health problems that plagued her from
[2:51:52] her childhood sister Erica became a
[2:51:55] mother and had not one but two sets of
[2:51:58] twin
[2:51:59] girls and like all Hero
[2:52:02] Stories there is a
[2:52:04] villain and this villain in this
[2:52:07] story was
[2:52:13] cancer and as the battle begin to rage
[2:52:16] we begin to see that she was just not a
[2:52:18] little petite woman named Erica but we
[2:52:22] begin to see that we had a hero a
[2:52:25] warrior of the faith and brother Lance
[2:52:28] not knowing that what was in my heart to
[2:52:30] speak on told me Erica was my hero
[2:52:34] brother Lance said you take someone who
[2:52:35] is in a burning building and the fire is
[2:52:37] all around you and he said all of a
[2:52:39] sudden someone comes busting in and
[2:52:41] pulls you out of the fire he said that
[2:52:44] person would always be a hero to you
[2:52:47] brother Lance said that's what Erica was
[2:52:49] to me she was and always will be my
[2:52:55] hero a real
[2:52:59] Christian Solomon one of the wisest men
[2:53:01] in the Bible understood the value of a
[2:53:04] virtuous woman for he said in Proverbs
[2:53:07] 31 who can find a virtuous woman for her
[2:53:10] price is far above rubies Solomon said
[2:53:13] who could find such a woman is this the
[2:53:15] price of such a person far exceeds the
[2:53:17] price of rubies she is a rarity a gem
[2:53:21] more valuable than rubies one to be
[2:53:23] sought out one to be found one to be
[2:53:27] cherished like a precious
[2:53:29] Jewel for a woman of this caliber would
[2:53:32] without a doubt be a devoted Christian
[2:53:35] one committed to her belief and her
[2:53:36] faith in God a virtuous woman would be
[2:53:39] an example to the community that she
[2:53:41] lived in she would be an inspiration to
[2:53:43] those who are around
[2:53:45] her Solomon said who could find such a
[2:53:48] one as
[2:53:49] this and I like to say this
[2:53:52] afternoon that we found one and sister
[2:53:56] Erica to me sister Erica was an
[2:53:59] inspiration such a mighty warrior of
[2:54:02] Faith she loved to hear the word
[2:54:04] preached I remember the times in
[2:54:05] Ministry to see her just drink up the
[2:54:08] word and and the smile that it brought
[2:54:10] to her face she enjoyed church and many
[2:54:13] times I'm sure she came came even though
[2:54:15] she didn't feel like it she came in fact
[2:54:18] I've seen her laying on the couch in the
[2:54:20] study with brother Lance by her side
[2:54:22] watching the service on the monitor
[2:54:24] because she wasn't able to sit in
[2:54:26] church yet she came because sister Erica
[2:54:30] was a virtuous woman she just didn't say
[2:54:34] she was a Christian with her
[2:54:36] words she said it with her life she was
[2:54:40] a warrior a hero of faith we read in
[2:54:44] Timothy Paul knew that his time of
[2:54:46] departing was at hand and Paul was
[2:54:49] confessing to Timothy I have been
[2:54:50] faithful I have fought a good fight I
[2:54:53] have finished my course I have kept the
[2:54:56] faith Paul said I was beaten but I kept
[2:54:59] the faith I was in prison but I kept the
[2:55:01] faith I was forsaken but I kept the
[2:55:03] faith I was cast down but I kept the
[2:55:06] faith Paul championed over his hardships
[2:55:09] and he finished the course and like Paul
[2:55:12] sister Erica saw hardship
[2:55:14] ship but she kept the faith she saw
[2:55:18] disappointments but she kept the faith
[2:55:21] she saw sickness but she kept the faith
[2:55:23] she endured trials but she kept the
[2:55:26] faith every doctor's report every scan
[2:55:29] every negative report every treatment
[2:55:32] every transfusion every pain
[2:55:35] episode every time she battled the
[2:55:37] weakness the fatigue the low blood
[2:55:40] counts she kept the
[2:55:43] faith she testified of the goodness of
[2:55:46] God she encouraged her children to serve
[2:55:48] God she told one of her daughters never
[2:55:50] forget we serve a mighty God in fact
[2:55:55] some of the last comments as brother Tim
[2:55:57] said that she made she told brother
[2:56:00] Donnie she said Dad Satan has messed up
[2:56:03] this
[2:56:04] time a hero of faith and no matter how
[2:56:07] many times that Satan tried to knock her
[2:56:10] down her faithfulness to God and his
[2:56:13] promises caus to get up and to run again
[2:56:17] she never gave up the fight she never
[2:56:19] stopped claiming her healing she never
[2:56:21] stopped praying for others and you can
[2:56:23] even see on the Facebook of people had
[2:56:25] posted that she text them and reached
[2:56:27] out to them and said she was praying for
[2:56:29] them in their times of difficulty and in
[2:56:31] their times of hurting she never stopped
[2:56:35] smiling she never stopped letting her
[2:56:37] light shine and she finished the course
[2:56:40] that was set before her sister Erica was
[2:56:43] fi faithful a real Warrior of Faith a
[2:56:50] hero the mayor of the city never knew
[2:56:54] her name the governor of
[2:56:57] Tennessee he never met her president of
[2:57:00] the United
[2:57:01] States he don't know who she is she was
[2:57:05] never on the cover of Life magazine
[2:57:08] never made woman of the
[2:57:09] year and yet because of her faith and
[2:57:13] her stand for God's word and his
[2:57:14] promises her name is known around the
[2:57:17] world her faith in the God who created
[2:57:20] her has inspired all of us to believe
[2:57:23] for the
[2:57:25] impossible they have even wrote songs
[2:57:27] about her condolences have come in from
[2:57:30] around the
[2:57:31] world the last few days Facebook has
[2:57:34] been flooded with her picture with those
[2:57:37] who loved her who wanted to be
[2:57:39] identified with her and yet she felt
[2:57:41] like a
[2:57:43] nobody the
[2:57:44] humbleness of a real hero of
[2:57:48] Faith her name has been brought Before
[2:57:50] the Throne of God hundreds if not
[2:57:52] thousands of times and just a few days
[2:57:54] ago the call came for everyone to pray
[2:57:57] earnestly thousands around the world
[2:57:59] begin to pray bringing her name Before
[2:58:02] the Throne of
[2:58:04] God and no doubt the Lord looked in his
[2:58:06] book of remembrance for the Bible said
[2:58:08] then they that fear the lord spake often
[2:58:10] one to another and the Lord hearkened
[2:58:11] and heard it and a book of remembrance
[2:58:13] was written before him and for them that
[2:58:16] feared the Lord and that thought upon
[2:58:18] his
[2:58:19] name and no doubt he saw her name was in
[2:58:21] the
[2:58:23] book he saw she was
[2:58:27] tired he saw she was suffering and in
[2:58:31] great
[2:58:32] pain he saw that she had kept the faith
[2:58:35] that had not wavered from her
[2:58:37] testimony he saw that it was time and he
[2:58:42] commanded death for God God is death's
[2:58:48] master and God commanded death and said
[2:58:52] death go get my daughter and bring her
[2:58:58] home and as she crossed that great Chasm
[2:59:01] death carrying her she begin to
[2:59:04] change her long hair that had been lost
[2:59:07] to
[2:59:08] chemo begin to flow in The Winds of
[2:59:12] Glory as she be to walk through that
[2:59:15] tall blue
[2:59:17] grass her body that was weak became
[2:59:19] strong again young again she began to
[2:59:24] see the Saints who had gone before her
[2:59:25] come running towards her to welcome her
[2:59:29] another great hero of Faith Erica Lee
[2:59:32] Reagan
[2:59:33] Parker had made it
[2:59:35] home you young sisters looking for a
[2:59:38] hero model you won't find one in
[2:59:42] Hollywood youon won't find one on a Mion
[2:59:45] a fashion magazine but look right here
[2:59:49] God placed one right before you you say
[2:59:52] brother darl but she lost oh no no she
[2:59:55] never lost God creates win-win
[2:59:58] situations for his
[3:00:00] people the cancer that held Erica's body
[3:00:03] did not defeat
[3:00:05] her she may have had cancer but cancer
[3:00:09] never had
[3:00:12] her you see Christians don't die they
[3:00:17] just changed Dwelling Places the prophet
[3:00:20] said you see a little flower how it
[3:00:21] standing pretty and sometimes it's young
[3:00:23] and sometimes it's middle-aged and
[3:00:25] sometimes it's old but when the frost
[3:00:26] hits it it dies it bows its little head
[3:00:29] sheds off its petals out of there drops
[3:00:31] a little black seed and did you know
[3:00:33] they have a funeral possession for a
[3:00:35] flower sure well as October winds come
[3:00:38] by and the fall rains Just Cry tears
[3:00:41] down out of the sky and they bury that
[3:00:43] little seed down under the ground but
[3:00:46] just let the warm spring Sun begin to
[3:00:48] shine on that dirt just a little bit
[3:00:50] it'll bring forth another flower because
[3:00:53] there's a germ of life in there that no
[3:00:54] science can find and if God made a way
[3:00:56] for a flower to live again how much more
[3:00:59] has he made a way from man who's in his
[3:01:02] own image when the son of righteousness
[3:01:04] Rises those who sleep in the dust of the
[3:01:07] Earth shall rise
[3:01:10] again for death is but a servant to
[3:01:12] carry a child of God into the presence
[3:01:14] of their God that's why precious is the
[3:01:18] death of saints in the sight of
[3:01:20] God listen
[3:01:23] Emma Ellie Leah
[3:01:26] Maria your mama didn't lose she won
[3:01:30] she's in a new body no pain no suffering
[3:01:34] she just changed Dwelling
[3:01:36] Places you said brother Daryl did we not
[3:01:39] have good faith to believe that that God
[3:01:41] was going to heal her I say we had great
[3:01:43] faith
[3:01:44] Faith because we sit here this day
[3:01:46] accepting her passing as the will of God
[3:01:50] you see to Believers his no to our
[3:01:52] prayers are just as good as his
[3:01:56] yeses I was telling the local church
[3:01:58] here the other night in the military we
[3:02:00] had 11 General Orders that we carried
[3:02:02] out as soldiers how to conduct ourselves
[3:02:05] for an example a general order was to
[3:02:07] never leave our post of Duty until
[3:02:08] properly relieved even in the case of an
[3:02:10] emergency but a direct order would be
[3:02:13] move out now our general orders in God's
[3:02:16] Army is to pray for the sick and lay our
[3:02:18] hands upon them and stand and believe
[3:02:20] the promises of God our general orders
[3:02:22] things that we do as Christians but
[3:02:26] there comes a direct order from God so
[3:02:29] death bring my daughter home and that
[3:02:33] supersedes all orders we never failed
[3:02:36] God God never failed us he just had a
[3:02:40] different
[3:02:41] plan go rest high upon on that mountain
[3:02:45] your battle here sister Erica is all
[3:02:48] done go to heaven just a

[3:03:05] others which have no hope for if we
[3:03:07] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[3:03:09] even so then also which sleep in Jesus
[3:03:12] will God bring with with
[3:03:14] them until that time let us

[3:10:41] few months ago
[3:10:44] as for God his way is
[3:10:47] perfect the word of the Lord is tried
[3:10:50] and he is a buckler to all of them that

[3:11:13] places he teacheth My Hands to War so
[3:11:17] that a bow of Steel is broken in my arms

[3:11:24] salvation and gentleness hath made me
[3:11:27] great thou H has enlarge my steps under
[3:11:30] me so that my feet did not
[3:11:35] slip I dedicate this next verse to her
[3:11:39] life I have pursued my enemies
[3:11:43] and destroyed
[3:11:46] them and turn not again until I have
[3:11:52] consumed
[3:11:55] them today incredible words have been
[3:11:57] said about sister
[3:12:01] Esther there have been books written The
[3:12:04] Book of
[3:12:06] Ruth the Book of
[3:12:09] Esther but today another chapter chapter
[3:12:13] has came and it's called The Book of
[3:12:18] Erica she's a modern hero as it's
[3:12:21] already been
[3:12:23] said looks like when the weakest of
[3:12:25] Christians they look so
[3:12:27] weak but really the weakest of
[3:12:30] Christians shake the kingdom of
[3:12:33] hell when they bow on their knees they
[3:12:36] Shake all of
[3:12:38] hell today in hell they know know that
[3:12:43] they can't torment her no
[3:12:46] more they didn't have enough to take
[3:12:50] her her frail little
[3:12:54] body her frail little
[3:12:57] lady tormented the kingdom of
[3:13:00] hell and every morning that she awoke
[3:13:04] much to the demise of the
[3:13:06] enemy whether it was in a whisper or a
[3:13:10] testimony to her children
[3:13:13] she knew I'm not going to
[3:13:16] die and she had a
[3:13:19] confidence I'm not going to
[3:13:21] die and I want to tell you she
[3:13:25] didn't I stand here as one that fights
[3:13:28] the same
[3:13:29] disease a terrible disease called
[3:13:33] cancer cancer whether it's stage one or
[3:13:36] stage four whether it's no matter
[3:13:40] whether it's in your organs or in your
[3:13:41] brain or your lung lungs are running
[3:13:43] throughout your
[3:13:46] body cancer can't
[3:13:52] win God knew when she was released into
[3:13:55] the Earth and who she would be
[3:13:57] born the tree of lineage that she would
[3:14:00] come
[3:14:02] from she would be born the daughter of
[3:14:05] and I'm not ashamed to say it one of the
[3:14:07] most powerful preachers that's ever
[3:14:09] lived on the face of the entire globe
[3:14:13] he has shook
[3:14:15] hell and she said as each child and amen
[3:14:18] and
[3:14:21] worshiped we watched her life we stood
[3:14:25] at her
[3:14:26] wedding what an incredible wedding that
[3:14:29] she
[3:14:30] had watched her and her husband fight
[3:14:34] fight the Battle of cancer together
[3:14:37] watched her beautiful children as they
[3:14:39] begin to grow
[3:14:41] up
[3:14:45] cancer couldn't destroy her relationship
[3:14:48] with her
[3:14:49] husband with her beautiful
[3:14:53] daughters with her daddy and mama her
[3:14:56] families uncles
[3:14:58] [Music]
[3:14:59] cousins cancer is
[3:15:02] limited fearful but it's
[3:15:06] limited because we serve a supernatural
[3:15:10] God and we realize that every moment of
[3:15:12] our life is so precious because we're
[3:15:15] not we're not promised
[3:15:19] tomorrow maybe the doctors haven't told
[3:15:23] you that you're fighting cancer and you
[3:15:25] could die at any night but every one of
[3:15:28] us our time is
[3:15:32] limited Erica preached as powerful
[3:15:35] sermons as her daddy
[3:15:41] did
[3:15:53] there was no amens or screams Hallelujah
[3:15:56] a lot of times her sermons came from a
[3:15:58] quiet bed nobody was
[3:16:02] around but her life and her breath and
[3:16:06] her thoughts on God and what what it's
[3:16:08] all
[3:16:09] about she never gave up she never gave
[3:16:14] in cancer can take your a lot of things
[3:16:17] of your abilities of life but it can't
[3:16:20] take your mind and it can't take your
[3:16:22] soul it can't take your love for God you
[3:16:26] can stare it right in the face knowing
[3:16:28] that the Holy Ghost is planted inside of
[3:16:31] your life and you got a
[3:16:34] promise it's been said
[3:16:36] before if you hear that I have died
[3:16:39] don't you believe it for a
[3:16:41] second
[3:16:42] because I will be much more alive there

[3:20:03] to him about the
[3:20:06] sores he never talked to him about all
