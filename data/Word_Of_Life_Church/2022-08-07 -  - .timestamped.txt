[31:30] since i'm the only guy wearing it it
[31:32] must be me
[31:35] and it's so wonderful to be be together
[31:38] today house of the lord
[31:41] certainly appreciate the opportunity
[31:43] let's turn to the book of ruth if you
[31:45] would ruth chapter 3
[31:49] verse 1.
[31:54] the rob is still on for tomorrow night
[31:56] 6 o'clock okay
[31:58] question answers for the youth tomorrow
[32:00] night
[32:03] supper provided at six okay
[32:06] i think we might
[32:08] have the service part maybe over here
[32:10] tomorrow night so we can stream it and
[32:13] be able to record it
[32:15] um
[32:16] our youth has asked a bunch of good
[32:18] questions and i think that it wouldn't
[32:20] would be a benefit for more than just
[32:22] the youth actually so if you can't
[32:24] stream it tomorrow not they'll be able
[32:26] to record it so you can you can hear it
[32:28] i like question answers well some of
[32:30] them anyway
[32:33] of course an interest is tricky
[32:35] but
[32:36] it's it kind of tells you where people
[32:38] are and
[32:39] what they're dealing with what they're
[32:41] thinking about
[32:42] where they are in their life and
[32:44] had some really good
[32:46] question answers so well questions would
[32:48] be good i guess it's yet debatable to
[32:50] see what the answers will be right
[32:52] i've been studying on them now for for a
[32:55] couple of weeks
[32:58] so we just come expecting the lord to to
[33:00] meet with us once again
[33:02] ruth chapter 3 verse verse 1.
[33:06] then naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[33:08] her
[33:10] my daughter
[33:12] shall i not seek rest for thee
[33:15] that it may be well with thee
[33:20] and now is not boaz our kindred
[33:23] with whoms maidens thou was behold
[33:26] he went with barley tonight
[33:29] in the threshing floor
[33:32] wash thyself therefore
[33:34] and anoint thee
[33:36] and put
[33:37] thy raiment upon thee
[33:39] and get thee down to the floor
[33:43] but make not thyself known
[33:45] unto the man
[33:47] until he shall have done eating
[33:49] and drinking
[33:51] let's pray together
[33:55] lord jesus how we love your word
[33:57] how we thank you father for
[34:00] making a way that it could be written
[34:02] down for us
[34:03] that we would be able to read it it's
[34:06] easy for us to see how that
[34:09] story is told from one generation to the
[34:11] next
[34:12] if your words would have been simply
[34:15] handed down from one
[34:17] generation to another generation to
[34:18] another generation to another generation
[34:21] verbally only what would we have wound
[34:24] up with
[34:26] in this age
[34:27] but you wanted your word to be written
[34:30] down
[34:31] and we thank you lord that we're living
[34:33] in an age when
[34:34] also you sent us a prophet with a
[34:36] message
[34:37] and you didn't just want people that
[34:39] were around him telling their children
[34:41] them telling their children but you made
[34:43] a way
[34:45] so that it could be recorded that we
[34:47] would be able to hear the voice of our
[34:50] messenger
[34:52] we're the only
[34:54] church age
[34:55] that has been able to hear the voice of
[34:58] their messenger
[34:59] even though he's been gone from the
[35:01] earth for decades
[35:03] and we're so grateful
[35:05] that we live in that age
[35:07] that we can hear the voice
[35:09] of the seventh angel
[35:11] so we're here today father because we
[35:13] believe that you're still the same god
[35:15] and you're desiring to speak to us today
[35:19] so we've got ready and we come to church
[35:23] we've just decided that today's a day
[35:26] that we're going to hear from god
[35:29] we've decided that we're going to open
[35:30] our hearts because we're here
[35:33] we're going to just present our needs
[35:35] before the almighty god
[35:38] that you'll take a minister and move him
[35:40] aside and help him to be able to speak
[35:43] to us
[35:44] father we love you we worship you with
[35:46] all of our hearts
[35:48] bless us as we sit together in jesus
[35:51] name
[35:51] amen god bless you you may be seated
[36:02] protocol
[36:04] can be a strange thing
[36:08] the way to
[36:10] approach something or the way to
[36:14] come to something
[36:15] or someone
[36:17] it could vary from
[36:19] one to the other
[36:21] it can vary in
[36:24] diplomats
[36:25] i've been in different parts of the
[36:27] world and flew on flights with
[36:30] diplomats i was on a flight one time
[36:33] in
[36:34] africa
[36:35] and there was there was a pretty high
[36:37] ranking official that was
[36:39] on the flight
[36:40] and it wasn't really hard to tell
[36:43] that he was high ranking because he
[36:45] wanted everybody else on the plane to
[36:47] know he was
[36:49] so he had a position and he had an
[36:51] attitude with that position
[36:54] he wanted to be
[36:56] treated different he wanted to sit in a
[36:59] certain spot and he demanded coffee and
[37:03] he demanded what they call biscuits
[37:05] which is cookies to us
[37:07] but he demanded this special treatment
[37:11] one of the brothers that i was with
[37:13] just so happened that they had assigned
[37:15] him
[37:16] this famous important man's seat
[37:19] and this guy got all been out of shape
[37:22] he was so angry and so mad
[37:25] so he demanded a certain protocol he
[37:30] demanded to be treated a certain way
[37:33] which was above everybody else on the
[37:35] plane well myself i thought the pilot
[37:37] was much more important than he was
[37:41] i mean that's just me okay
[37:43] that was just my view about it because i
[37:45] figured we could make it without that
[37:47] guy i didn't figure we could make it
[37:49] without the pipe
[37:50] but this attitude of this individual was
[37:53] that pretty much he he was the top dog
[37:57] well i guess if you're talking about
[37:58] dogs you are but since i ain't no dog
[38:01] i don't have a dog in this race but that
[38:04] doesn't do away with there is an
[38:08] approach and there is a protocol
[38:11] and god has one
[38:13] and naomi
[38:15] now she of course knew the law she knew
[38:18] the leverage law
[38:20] that she was going to teach
[38:23] ruth about
[38:25] ruth being a muabidest we don't know if
[38:28] she understood exactly what she was
[38:30] being told to do
[38:32] but what was really important wasn't so
[38:35] much that she understood it but that she
[38:38] obeyed it with the right type of
[38:41] attitude
[38:42] you know god has many ways by which he
[38:46] differentiates his elect just between
[38:50] people that don't want to be lost and
[38:53] the elect the elect are not people that
[38:56] just don't they want to skip out on hell
[38:59] but the elect they love god so much
[39:03] they want to do whatever he wants them
[39:05] to do
[39:06] it might seem foolish to the eyes of the
[39:08] world it might seem very very simple to
[39:12] the eyes of others but to the elect it's
[39:15] not that way at all if god wants them to
[39:17] do something they will do it whether or
[39:19] not they even understand it
[39:22] now she's giving her a fivefold manner
[39:26] by which she must approach
[39:28] boaz now remember the jews tell us that
[39:32] boaz was about 80
[39:35] and ruth was about 40 or younger
[39:39] so this within itself is kind of odd now
[39:43] especially for our western civilization
[39:45] for them it was not so much
[39:48] but she
[39:50] must know and learn
[39:52] what is the right approach
[39:55] naomi wants to give her rest as she
[39:58] calls it in other words she wants her to
[40:02] be married
[40:03] she wants her to have a husband
[40:06] that will give her a name a protection a
[40:10] place provided to where she will be able
[40:13] to live
[40:15] and naomi knows the law of god well
[40:19] enough to know that by the leverage law
[40:22] that if you had a husband that died
[40:25] and there was a near kinsmen then that
[40:28] near kinsman was obligated by the
[40:31] leverage law
[40:33] to take that woman to be his wife
[40:36] whether it was a brother it could be a
[40:38] stepfather an uncle a cousin and then
[40:41] whenever they would have a child
[40:44] that child would actually bear the name
[40:48] of that dead husband
[40:50] it would also receive a portion of his
[40:53] inheritance so naomi doesn't just leave
[40:57] ruth to a spot well honey just do
[41:00] whatever you think
[41:02] i'll tell you what you just
[41:04] whatever you think uh whatever you want
[41:07] to do and let's say it this way however
[41:11] you feel led
[41:13] now being a pastor for about 40 years
[41:16] now
[41:17] i found out that when people
[41:20] say those words
[41:22] it's like those words
[41:25] override
[41:27] every scripture
[41:29] they override every quote
[41:32] when people say
[41:34] they feel led to do something
[41:37] well this is the way i look at it again
[41:40] i'm a simple sort of a fellow
[41:42] i don't figure the holy ghost is going
[41:44] to lead me
[41:45] or you
[41:46] or anyone else
[41:48] to go contrary to his word
[41:52] so when we feel led to do something we
[41:56] need to check and make sure
[41:58] that what we feel led to do is not
[42:01] contrary to the word
[42:04] so ruth now she's a moabitess no doubt
[42:07] they did not approach it this way back
[42:10] in the land of moab whether it made
[42:14] sense or not she's going to do it and
[42:17] god is going to honor her and we will
[42:21] pick it up with boaz as well that boaz
[42:25] even as much as he wanted her to be his
[42:29] wife
[42:30] and as much as he believed no doubt it
[42:34] was the sovereignty of god
[42:37] but boaz would not commit himself to her
[42:42] until the closest of kin
[42:46] resolved his rights
[42:50] i wish a lot of preachers could
[42:51] understand that
[42:52] i wish a lot of our folks in the message
[42:54] could understand that
[42:56] so the first thing that she does is
[43:00] bathes her cell
[43:02] now she washes
[43:04] as we said before there was no showers
[43:07] there was no bathrooms in their houses
[43:10] so you know a bass was something of of a
[43:13] rarity of sorts that was one thing that
[43:16] the romans did in every conquest that
[43:20] they would make the romans brought
[43:23] highways they brought aqueducts they
[43:26] brought water they brought so many
[43:29] things along in their civilization as i
[43:32] stood a few years ago and saw
[43:35] the roman aqueduct which had been buried
[43:39] by years of accumulation of sand
[43:42] and standing there in the land of israel
[43:45] and looking at that massive massive
[43:48] aqueduct which they had built in order
[43:51] to bring water you know the city of
[43:54] laodicea was quite unique in that the
[43:58] romans had built two separate aqueducts
[44:02] for laodicea because there was a hot
[44:05] spring
[44:07] in one direction and there was cold
[44:09] water in another direction so they built
[44:13] an aqueduct for the warm water now
[44:16] whenever john wrote what the lord said
[44:20] about being lukewarm they knew exactly
[44:22] what he was talking about
[44:24] because they had received that hot water
[44:28] when it left its origination
[44:31] by the time it reached laodicea
[44:34] it was lukewarm
[44:36] so they knew exactly what john was
[44:40] meaning
[44:41] so god is the same way in the sense that
[44:44] he wants us to be able to obey his word
[44:48] whether we understand it whether we
[44:50] don't that's not the thing
[44:52] it's he checks us by our obedience
[44:56] and our love to him is not just by words
[45:01] but more so by obedience
[45:04] now james said be therefore not a
[45:08] forgetful hearer that is one that hears
[45:11] the word they may rejoice in it shout in
[45:14] it talk about how good it is but then
[45:17] they forget to obey it
[45:19] but ruth is truly a genuine type of a
[45:23] gentile an elect gentile
[45:26] we have no place here written in here or
[45:30] in josephus or any of the rest of the
[45:33] histories that i could find
[45:35] that ruth questioned one thing that
[45:39] naomi said
[45:41] now we don't know if she understood it
[45:43] if it made sense as a matter of fact
[45:46] what she's going to ask her to do
[45:49] is very embarrassing
[45:52] and very humiliating
[45:54] it could be interpreted
[45:57] as if the ruth is a foul woman
[46:03] that's right
[46:04] but ruth does not question
[46:07] she simply has confidence in the one
[46:10] giving her the instruction
[46:13] so she doesn't say i'll tell what i'm
[46:15] going to pray about this do you mind if
[46:18] i go on a three-day fast well you can if
[46:20] you want to but the festival will be
[46:23] over time you get down with your fast
[46:26] and you'll miss your window of obedience
[46:30] so now it is now or wait until next year
[46:35] you know that's the time for us to move
[46:38] when the spirit of god is moving on our
[46:41] hearts
[46:42] so notice what the writer said wash
[46:45] thyself therefore and anoint thee and
[46:49] put thy raiment upon thee now this is a
[46:53] accumulative type of saying that was
[46:56] very common among not only the jews but
[46:59] the middle eastern people and for some
[47:01] of them is still there today having been
[47:04] there in some of the markets and i stood
[47:06] in durban south africa several years ago
[47:10] and there's quite a a population of east
[47:13] indians in durban i was there brother
[47:15] naomi and i do and several indian
[47:18] believers that are there and he wanted
[47:20] to take me to their market and i i went
[47:24] there to their market and all for those
[47:26] of you that like indian food and you
[47:28] smell all those different spices and
[47:31] those leaves and nuts and things that's
[47:34] in there it's just overwhelming so they
[47:37] have big old things that look safe
[47:38] similar to us a 55-gallon drum and that
[47:42] size and they would have this spice and
[47:44] it was yellow and this one was red this
[47:47] one was orange and this one was green
[47:49] and it was just unbelievable the the
[47:52] fragrances that were there then in
[47:55] another part of that market they would
[47:57] have sandalwood and they would have
[48:00] pieces of balsam and pieces of fur and
[48:04] they would have myrrh and they would
[48:06] have frankincense so you would come from
[48:09] one set of aromas and fragrances and
[48:13] move from there to another well brother
[48:15] naomi wanted to do me a favor
[48:18] so
[48:18] he bought me up a bunch of spices
[48:25] i'm a tennessee boy okay
[48:28] now i do like indian food yeah i do like
[48:31] it i don't like it quite as strong as
[48:33] they like it
[48:34] but he bought me this and he bought me
[48:36] that and he bought me something else and
[48:39] you know i'm going from there to
[48:41] johannesburg to the meetings and i've
[48:43] got my suitcase so i don't know anything
[48:45] else to do other than put it in the
[48:47] suitcase well by the time i got to the
[48:50] meetings
[48:53] you can guess what i smell like
[48:56] so i thought i i've got another week or
[48:59] ten days you know this what in the world
[49:03] am i going to do
[49:04] with all of this stuff herein lies the
[49:07] mystery of which i will not reveal
[49:13] but needless to say i didn't smell that
[49:14] way after that meeting that's all that
[49:17] will be said
[49:18] but whenever god now you know the
[49:21] natural types to spiritual
[49:23] so god has a way for us to approach him
[49:28] now sinners can come to god as they are
[49:32] even a backside look at the prodigal son
[49:34] he come to his father which was in tight
[49:37] uh smelling without a ring without shoes
[49:40] without proper garments a sinner can
[49:42] come to god you know with cigarette on
[49:45] their breasts and alcohol and whatever
[49:47] more but for a son or daughter of god to
[49:50] approach god that way you're going to
[49:52] get in trouble big time
[49:55] because god has a protocol and i find it
[49:59] amazing myself how that people will
[50:02] approach gifted men of god and they they
[50:05] think that they can come however they
[50:09] wish
[50:10] and i i'm reminded of the story that i
[50:13] heard brother billy paul tell and it was
[50:16] of a minister that come to have a
[50:18] private interview with brother branham
[50:21] and brother billy brings the man in and
[50:24] gives him so much time and the man gets
[50:27] up and he comes out walks out the door
[50:30] brother billy paul goes back to brother
[50:32] branham and getting ready to bring the
[50:34] next person in and these were brother
[50:37] branham's comments when billy walks in
[50:40] he said that man is fixing to make
[50:43] the most terrible mistake horrible
[50:46] mistake of his entire life
[50:50] and brother billy said daddy
[50:52] did you tell him
[50:55] he said no
[50:57] he didn't ask me
[51:00] he told me
[51:02] now the man had come in and told brother
[51:05] branham he was going to go here and
[51:07] there and there and travel overseas and
[51:09] be a missionary going to india going
[51:12] here there there so instead of
[51:15] approaching god's gift
[51:18] in the right way
[51:19] he come telling
[51:22] the man of god what he was going to do
[51:25] instead of saying look brother branham
[51:27] this is what i'm feeling led to do
[51:31] what would be your advice now that would
[51:33] have been a total different approach
[51:36] that would have been an approach that
[51:38] would have been acceptable to god then
[51:41] the man would have left a way for the
[51:44] spirit of god to be able to corrected
[51:47] him through that prophetic gift you
[51:49] understand
[51:50] so you see something even like that can
[51:54] change you say why why would god do that
[51:57] because god demands respect
[52:01] now i'm certainly not no prophet
[52:03] certainly not no great spiritual person
[52:05] but over the years i've had so many
[52:08] people come and tell me i feel led to do
[52:11] this and i feel led to do that and i
[52:13] feel led to do that and most of the time
[52:16] when they tell me that unless i feel
[52:19] that urge of the spirit of god
[52:22] i very rarely say anything
[52:25] you know why they have already offended
[52:27] the spirit of god by the way they
[52:29] approached him
[52:30] they have offended the presence of god
[52:33] by overstepping the boundaries of his
[52:36] word
[52:37] and i don't want to offend him by
[52:39] catering to them
[52:43] now if he nudges me then i will say
[52:47] something and i have
[52:49] but there's been so many times that i've
[52:51] sat right there in my office and people
[52:54] would come in i feel led to do this or
[52:56] i'm going to do that and i'm going to do
[52:57] something else and most of the time in
[53:00] my heart i know they're missing god a
[53:02] million miles
[53:04] but unless god nudges me i'll say well
[53:07] god bless you i love you i'll be praying
[53:09] for you hope god will go you say brother
[53:11] donny why would you do that because me
[53:13] offending god's going to get me in
[53:15] trouble
[53:16] you see god has a protocol
[53:20] and that is that we must approach him in
[53:24] the right way
[53:25] now naomi knows that about god and even
[53:30] does so does boaz know that about god
[53:33] but ruth is kind of just learning this
[53:36] new way oh i wish we could be taught i
[53:39] wish god would help us my we we in the
[53:42] message think we know so much we know
[53:45] the thunders and we know the seals and
[53:47] there's all kinds of people that do and
[53:49] they still don't know the divine
[53:51] approach to almighty god
[53:53] god you don't approach god for healing
[53:56] because you've got long hair because
[53:58] you've got a nice long dress and it's
[54:01] decent you approach god by faith
[54:05] you don't approach god well god look at
[54:07] me i look holiness you owe it to me you
[54:10] don't know how to approach god you don't
[54:11] approach god because god owes you
[54:14] anything
[54:15] god owes us nothing
[54:19] it is his mercy that we get anything
[54:22] from god this is why the prophet said
[54:25] that he had seen saints of god walk
[54:27] across the platform and not get healed
[54:30] and watch sinners come across the
[54:33] platform and walk off well why the
[54:36] center knew they was nothing the sinner
[54:39] knew they deserved nothing they were
[54:41] worth nothing but they had enough faith
[54:44] to touch god and that church member
[54:47] walking across with an attitude well god
[54:49] you owe me this and you owe me that and
[54:52] totally miss their healing
[54:55] i want to know god's approach myself
[54:59] now ruth is simply following in a great
[55:03] line of the way this has gone before and
[55:07] many that will follow here after let's
[55:09] look at her her grandson or
[55:12] great-grandson rather in second samuel
[55:14] 12 20 then david arose from the earth
[55:18] and washed
[55:20] and anointed himself and changed his
[55:24] apparel now this setting is of course
[55:27] after david's child has died with
[55:29] bathsheba and the lord told him that he
[55:32] was going to take the child and david
[55:35] fasted and prayed and cried and lamented
[55:38] and now of course the servants come in
[55:40] the doors and they're kind of whispering
[55:42] to one another and they've not yet told
[55:44] david what's happened but david
[55:46] perceives that god has taken the child
[55:49] they asked david to eat when the child
[55:51] was alive he would not do it and no
[55:53] doubt david looked you know totally
[55:55] exhausted and worn out because he'd been
[55:58] petitioning god but now the baby is dead
[56:02] and now what does david do david changes
[56:06] his apparel david changes his look
[56:10] because the look that he had matched one
[56:14] that was in sorrow and mourning and he
[56:17] wanted to appear in the presence of god
[56:20] as one that was afflicted so this is why
[56:23] they would tear their garments so they
[56:25] would come up to the top like this and
[56:27] they would tear their garment and rip
[56:29] their garment as job did and many others
[56:32] and they would reach down and the ashes
[56:34] where a fire had been and they did that
[56:36] as a symbolism of wood which had been in
[56:39] one form now it was changed by fire and
[56:42] they looked at themselves as being the
[56:44] same way that they were one form and
[56:47] then god let trials and tests come and
[56:50] they saw themselves as that piece of
[56:52] wood which had been changed from a
[56:54] carbon form and a live tree now unto a
[56:58] carbon form which had been burnt which
[57:00] had been tested which had been tried so
[57:03] they would take that ashes and put it
[57:05] upon themselves and they would look so
[57:08] different they would look afflicted but
[57:10] that look was fitting for someone
[57:13] needing a touch from god but now david
[57:17] says i need to change my appearance i
[57:20] need to change the way i look because i
[57:24] bore that image and god has not heard me
[57:28] god decided to take me take my son
[57:31] rather now david says that he rise the
[57:33] bible says he rose up from the earth and
[57:36] washed and anointed himself and changed
[57:40] his apparel notice now the sequence the
[57:43] way that it comes so he washes himself
[57:46] then he is anointed why not anoint
[57:49] yourself before you get washed that's
[57:52] why a sinner cannot receive the baptism
[57:54] of the holy ghost
[57:56] you see god is not going to indwell a
[58:00] temple that is filthy and full of a vile
[58:03] rotten nature
[58:05] so god has a divine way of approach so
[58:09] he washed and he anointed himself and he
[58:11] changed his apparel and came into the
[58:14] house of the lord and worshiped now
[58:16] notice it is bringing a complete change
[58:20] did the sorrow of his child been taken
[58:23] was it gone probably not it may have
[58:25] took him years if he ever got over it
[58:28] but yet he saw you know what i cannot
[58:30] bring the child back to me but i can go
[58:34] to the child so i'm gonna go not was
[58:37] being angry at god i'm not gonna go
[58:40] being mad at god but the only way i will
[58:43] be accepted is to approach him notice
[58:46] david is approaching god he's not
[58:48] approaching people well brother what do
[58:50] you think i should do and sister what do
[58:52] you think i should do but he knew this
[58:54] was the right approach to god
[58:58] so he washes and then he anoints himself
[59:01] in order to be pleasant to be around now
[59:05] the anointing of course in the old
[59:06] testament was oil but it was symbolic in
[59:10] the new testament of the spirit of god
[59:12] anointing us so notice he came into the
[59:15] house of the lord and worshiped then
[59:17] came into his own house and when he
[59:20] required they set bread before him and
[59:23] he did it so he was fasting he was
[59:25] mournful he no doubt had ashes all over
[59:28] him tears he must have looked like an
[59:30] absolute mess he was clothed with
[59:33] sackcloth but they noticed a change why
[59:36] because his attitude is changed god is
[59:39] not going to raise a child up god is not
[59:41] going to heal the child now i must go on
[59:45] with this portion of my life well he'd
[59:47] realize that the approach to god was not
[59:51] go to the house of god to worship
[59:53] looking like a mourner don't you
[59:56] understand what naomi is instructing
[59:59] ruth what to do
[1:00:00] ruth was still in her closing of
[1:00:04] widowhood
[1:00:05] she was wearing the clothes of a widow
[1:00:09] now we know our nation used to do that
[1:00:11] of course whenever a woman would lose
[1:00:13] her husband then she would put on black
[1:00:15] and she would wear it for however long
[1:00:17] however long society deemed it you know
[1:00:20] necessary to wear it so people would
[1:00:22] look at her and their children as well
[1:00:24] and they would see them with black they
[1:00:26] would see them with an armband on and
[1:00:28] they would knew that they were a widower
[1:00:31] well ruth had been wearing these with
[1:00:33] hood clothes but naomi said look girl if
[1:00:37] you're going to become a bride you got
[1:00:39] to change your clothes
[1:00:41] you got to get them black garments on
[1:00:43] that old black dreadful thing that's
[1:00:45] hanging around you you can't worship you
[1:00:48] can't sing you can't praise god you go
[1:00:50] to church and you sit there like a bump
[1:00:52] on a pickle you don't ever raise your
[1:00:54] hands in the presence of the lord look
[1:00:56] girl if you're one to get marriage you
[1:00:58] got to act like a bride not a widow
[1:01:02] well praise the lord
[1:01:07] amen notice again in exodus chapter 30
[1:01:10] verse 35 that god had a divine protocol
[1:01:14] for the priests coming into his presence
[1:01:18] now the priests were called out of the
[1:01:20] tribe of levi and they were the ones
[1:01:22] that god had chose they were the tents
[1:01:24] or the tithing of the tribes they were
[1:01:27] to be the firstborn in symbol that god
[1:01:30] would allow to come into his presence
[1:01:33] but even if that they could not come
[1:01:35] just however they wished so they could
[1:01:38] not just say well i'll just pick this
[1:01:40] out and i picked out and i'll put this
[1:01:41] on i'll put that and god said nope
[1:01:43] that's not the way it's going to work
[1:01:45] i'm going to tell you what to wear i'm
[1:01:47] going to tell you when to wear it i'm
[1:01:50] going to tell you what you're going to
[1:01:51] smell like and i'm going to tell you
[1:01:53] nobody else in the camp better smell
[1:01:56] like that because they're going to get
[1:01:57] in trouble if they do so you see a lot
[1:02:00] of folks think in the new testament that
[1:02:02] god threw away all the protocol so
[1:02:05] that's why they come to god many of them
[1:02:08] have went to church today around the
[1:02:09] world and women have worn many skirts
[1:02:12] into church if they wore any skirt at
[1:02:14] all many of them have wore shorts to
[1:02:16] church they come to church looking like
[1:02:18] sailors are tattooed from the top of
[1:02:20] their head to the bottom of the little
[1:02:22] t9c toe and they feel like oh i'm a
[1:02:25] christian that drinks i'm a christian
[1:02:27] that smokes marijuana how in the world
[1:02:29] could you mix him two terms together
[1:02:32] that's not a child of god
[1:02:34] oh yes sir brother donny the lord jesus
[1:02:37] hung around sinners that's right he did
[1:02:40] his reputation was made among sinners
[1:02:42] but go ahead and finish the reality of
[1:02:44] that truth sinners didn't change him he
[1:02:48] changed the sinners
[1:02:53] so god today still has a protocol and
[1:02:56] this is one of the major things of
[1:02:57] course that separates the bride from the
[1:02:59] church because the church feels like god
[1:03:02] will accept just anything they give him
[1:03:04] you know whatever if they want to come
[1:03:06] to church looking like who knows what
[1:03:08] then god will accept that and you know
[1:03:10] they'll be that way the rest of their
[1:03:12] life don't don't get in my closet don't
[1:03:14] get in my music don't get in my movies
[1:03:17] don't get in my computer i'm a christian
[1:03:19] but i'm going to do what i'm going to do
[1:03:21] no you're not a christian because if you
[1:03:24] are a christian your life belongs to the
[1:03:26] lord jesus you are not your own you are
[1:03:30] bought with a price
[1:03:34] is that right
[1:03:36] now what if i start to pick up this
[1:03:38] handkerchief and whenever i do this
[1:03:40] handkerchief knows exactly where it's
[1:03:42] hidden it's heading straight from my
[1:03:44] forehead it's heading straight for the
[1:03:46] sweat running down beside my sideburns
[1:03:49] it's heading straight for the sweat
[1:03:51] popped out on my upper lip and the
[1:03:54] handkerchief will say no no
[1:03:56] don't do it don't do it don't do it i
[1:03:59] can't stand sweat i hate sweat i don't
[1:04:02] like having your old dirty nasty sweat
[1:04:04] all over
[1:04:09] like it or lump it you're my
[1:04:11] handkerchief
[1:04:16] like it or lumpy you're my shirt you're
[1:04:19] going to be wet you're going to be
[1:04:21] stinking when i get done but you're my
[1:04:24] shirt
[1:04:25] well praise the lord
[1:04:27] lord if the lord jesus wanted to use me
[1:04:29] for a doormat i'd be wanna be one of the
[1:04:32] happiest doormats that was ever laid in
[1:04:34] front of the house of god
[1:04:36] oh i know some of you feel like you've
[1:04:38] got the uppity up and you're this and
[1:04:40] that and the other come on down on the
[1:04:42] earth with the rest of us dirtbags
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:51] notice what god says in exodus 30 35
[1:04:55] thou shall make it
[1:04:57] a perfume
[1:04:59] a confection after the art
[1:05:02] of the apocalyphere
[1:05:05] tempered together pure
[1:05:07] and holy
[1:05:09] and thou shalt beat
[1:05:12] some of it very small
[1:05:14] and put it before the testimony and the
[1:05:17] tabernacle of the congregation so here
[1:05:20] is a certain perfume
[1:05:22] and it's going to be in the presence of
[1:05:24] god
[1:05:25] and somebody else is going to have a
[1:05:27] matching fragrance
[1:05:30] so they're going to have this in the
[1:05:32] house of god and then the priests are
[1:05:36] going to be anointed with the same smell
[1:05:39] now can you imagine the average
[1:05:42] israelite they never got to wear this
[1:05:45] smell
[1:05:46] but they knew who priests were even if
[1:05:50] they didn't have the robes on
[1:05:53] you know why they could smell them
[1:05:57] your imagine when they would get around
[1:06:00] them and then
[1:06:05] is that what it smells like
[1:06:07] in his presence
[1:06:10] i know who you are
[1:06:13] he didn't have the bonnet on he didn't
[1:06:15] have the ephod on he didn't have all the
[1:06:17] priests garments on but he still had
[1:06:19] that aroma on him
[1:06:21] oh it's the kind of child of god
[1:06:30] thou shalt put it before the tavern the
[1:06:32] testimony of the tabernacle of the
[1:06:33] congregation
[1:06:35] for i will meet with thee and it shall
[1:06:37] be unto you
[1:06:38] most holy
[1:06:40] and as for the perfume which thou shalt
[1:06:43] make
[1:06:44] you shall not make it
[1:06:46] to yourselves
[1:06:49] now this is not to be
[1:06:51] commercialized
[1:06:54] well let me say the same way today the
[1:06:55] gospel is not to be commercialized
[1:06:57] either
[1:06:58] oh it's been commercialized and it'll be
[1:07:00] commercialized further we go on in time
[1:07:02] we know that but the real truth of the
[1:07:04] gospel is not to have money made with it
[1:07:06] come on saints say amen it is the truth
[1:07:10] whenever we have to start charging for
[1:07:12] this and selling coffee and buying
[1:07:14] donuts and i passed the thing the other
[1:07:16] day going to the the meetings over and
[1:07:18] reusing and uh i saw one here in johnson
[1:07:20] city too well they was going to have the
[1:07:22] animal shows on a certain certain day i
[1:07:25] thought i would have pretty much thought
[1:07:26] that been common every service you know
[1:07:28] animal shows
[1:07:30] but yet having animal shows and petting
[1:07:32] zoos and all kinds of stuff to draw a
[1:07:35] crowd when we do that it's time to shut
[1:07:38] up the house of god and go home
[1:07:42] come on children
[1:07:48] and as for the perfume which thou shalt
[1:07:50] make it shall not make to yourselves
[1:07:53] according to the composition thereof now
[1:07:56] the composition was actually a mystery
[1:08:01] everybody did not know what the
[1:08:03] composition was but it was given to the
[1:08:06] prophet from god
[1:08:08] and then given to the apocaly
[1:08:11] and the apocalypse was the one that took
[1:08:14] this composition and molded it together
[1:08:17] so was it this way that he had will say
[1:08:20] so much sandalwood and so much myrrh and
[1:08:24] so much aloes and so much cassia so he
[1:08:28] take a little bit of church ages and
[1:08:30] then mix a little bit of the seals and
[1:08:33] then mix a little bit of justification
[1:08:36] oh hallelujah you know if i was a lay
[1:08:38] member and i was looking for a church to
[1:08:40] go to i wouldn't want to find one that
[1:08:42] all they preached about was just the
[1:08:45] seals all the time
[1:08:47] you might find somebody there the sauce
[1:08:48] needs to be saved they might need to
[1:08:50] hear about salvation i wouldn't want to
[1:08:52] just go to church at all they preach the
[1:08:54] bible salvation neither because there
[1:08:56] might be somebody there that needs a
[1:08:58] holy ghost
[1:08:59] what i would look for is an apocary
[1:09:02] which is like what we call today a
[1:09:04] modern walgreen or cvs now i understand
[1:09:08] they're experiencing a lot of shortages
[1:09:10] in our drug stores and that's because a
[1:09:13] big portion of our drugs come from china
[1:09:17] well you didn't know that well that's
[1:09:19] the truth of it so you have to wait for
[1:09:21] certain certain things but god has an
[1:09:24] apocary his message of the hour and it
[1:09:28] has so much healing it's got so much
[1:09:30] deliverance it's got so much baptism of
[1:09:33] the holy ghost it's got mysteries it's
[1:09:36] got deep thought oh somebody i don't
[1:09:38] want deep down i don't want to be well
[1:09:40] you complain to god he's the one that
[1:09:43] had it wrote in his bible
[1:09:45] apparently mysteries are important to
[1:09:48] god
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:52] so watch what they do now
[1:09:54] so they make this perfume
[1:09:57] praise the lord
[1:09:59] whosoever shall make like unto that to
[1:10:02] smell thereto
[1:10:05] shall even be cut off
[1:10:13] so if you die to even smell like a
[1:10:15] preacher
[1:10:16] i wonder what you're going to be when
[1:10:17] you try to impersonate getting in the
[1:10:19] pulpit and you're not called to do it
[1:10:23] i'm convinced friends we've got men in
[1:10:26] this message that say they're called to
[1:10:27] preach and been more called to preach
[1:10:28] than a donkey
[1:10:30] look how they divide the word
[1:10:33] look at the doctrines look at the messes
[1:10:35] a lot of them been made don't tell me
[1:10:36] god calls somebody like that make him an
[1:10:38] ignoramus
[1:10:40] well priest mother
[1:10:42] dawning amen god calls his men
[1:10:47] and god anoints his men
[1:10:50] with the composition that he himself
[1:10:53] chooses for their gift oh man there's
[1:10:56] things about brother tim pruitt i wish i
[1:10:59] could make a preacher you know just make
[1:11:00] a certain preacher so i'd pull so much
[1:11:02] of brother tim and that i'd pull so much
[1:11:04] of brother ron and then i'd pull so much
[1:11:06] of this brother and i would take none of
[1:11:08] me believe that i'd take none of me but
[1:11:10] i'd take so much mother daryl and i take
[1:11:12] so much of this together and i've added
[1:11:14] all together man what in the world would
[1:11:16] i get a big square mess
[1:11:19] you know why because god don't do it the
[1:11:22] way we want it done
[1:11:23] god does it the way he wants it done and
[1:11:26] he sends men and calls them and makes
[1:11:30] the composition even of their gift and
[1:11:34] sends them out but to everyone anointed
[1:11:36] to smell the same way
[1:11:39] hallelujah
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:11:43] now notice exodus 40 and verse 9 thou
[1:11:46] shalt take
[1:11:48] the anointing oil
[1:11:51] and anoint the tabernacle
[1:11:55] so here goes moses now
[1:12:09] let's get that monitor too
[1:12:14] man that guitar player needs it
[1:12:19] it's really annoying these drums
[1:12:26] so when you come in
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:38] every priest
[1:12:40] was not anointed
[1:12:43] just those that were called into his
[1:12:45] divine presence
[1:12:47] some were disqualified
[1:12:49] they had certain birth defects and this
[1:12:51] and that they were qualified
[1:12:52] disqualified they could not receive the
[1:12:54] anointing oil
[1:12:58] so here this priest walked in the
[1:13:00] presence of god
[1:13:03] and he begins to smell
[1:13:10] is that me
[1:13:12] or the house of god
[1:13:16] both
[1:13:19] and why in the world people don't don't
[1:13:22] want to go to church
[1:13:23] it's beyond me
[1:13:27] i want you to notice this oil was not
[1:13:29] used to anoint her kitchen table
[1:13:33] this oil was not used to anoint their
[1:13:36] monitor
[1:13:39] it wasn't used to an onto a computer
[1:13:42] it was used to anoint the house of god
[1:13:46] and the worshipers in the house of god
[1:13:51] so here was something else that pulled
[1:13:54] them together that identified them as
[1:13:57] worshipers
[1:13:59] you're not a worshiper just because you
[1:14:00] come here this morning you're not a
[1:14:02] worshiper just because you're sitting in
[1:14:04] the pew you're a worshiper because you
[1:14:06] raise your hands and you raise your
[1:14:08] voice oh some of you will cry some of
[1:14:11] you may shout god don't want us to be
[1:14:13] necessarily like individuals god wants
[1:14:15] us to reflect the composition of the
[1:14:17] spirit of god in us some of us the holy
[1:14:19] ghost moves on us we may dance a little
[1:14:22] bit back and forth while some of you
[1:14:23] would pass out a few ever dance my you
[1:14:25] wouldn't know what to even do some of
[1:14:27] your wife and your kids but you know
[1:14:29] what we're not wanting you to be like me
[1:14:31] we don't want you to act like brother
[1:14:33] daryl or act like somebody else but you
[1:14:35] want to give the composition of the way
[1:14:38] that god made you
[1:14:48] pardon me for saying so
[1:14:50] but i can see brother jim babb sitting
[1:14:52] right over on the end of that pew right
[1:14:54] now
[1:14:55] with his eyes like this with his hand
[1:14:57] and his face over his face like this
[1:15:02] never seen him run
[1:15:04] never seen him around the backs of the
[1:15:06] pews
[1:15:08] but he was a worshiper
[1:15:10] let me tell you something him and
[1:15:12] brother gene and all the rest of our
[1:15:14] loved ones that have crossed over you
[1:15:16] think they worshipped here you ought to
[1:15:18] see them now
[1:15:20] praise be to god
[1:15:23] why because what they were anointed with
[1:15:27] that same fragrance is in the sixth
[1:15:30] dimension
[1:15:31] you see the holy ghost that he gives you
[1:15:34] in this life is yours for eternity
[1:15:38] it will be yours forever a lot of people
[1:15:41] don't want that i just don't understand
[1:15:43] friends
[1:15:46] thou shalt anoint the altar
[1:15:49] of the burnt offering and all his
[1:15:51] vessels notice his
[1:15:54] his vessels and sanctify the altar and
[1:15:58] shall be on the altar shall be most holy
[1:16:01] and thou shalt anoint the laver
[1:16:04] and his foot
[1:16:06] and sanctify it
[1:16:08] and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons
[1:16:12] unto the door the tabernacle of congo
[1:16:14] congregation
[1:16:16] and wash them
[1:16:18] with water
[1:16:22] and thou shalt put upon aaron
[1:16:25] the holy garments
[1:16:27] and anoint
[1:16:29] him
[1:16:31] notice the order the protocol
[1:16:33] wash him first
[1:16:38] and sanctify him
[1:16:40] that he may minister
[1:16:44] unto who
[1:16:45] the priest is not ministering to the
[1:16:48] people
[1:16:49] but ministering
[1:16:51] unto god
[1:16:55] lord general we could ever get this
[1:16:56] right we when we come to the house of
[1:16:58] god i believe it changed us forever
[1:17:01] we're not here worshipping one another
[1:17:03] we're not here so that people will think
[1:17:05] you're spiritual or whatever more we're
[1:17:07] here ministering to the king of kings
[1:17:10] we're ministering to the lord so we're
[1:17:13] worshiping him and we're anointed by the
[1:17:16] spirit of god and we are ministering
[1:17:19] lord jesus
[1:17:20] we worship you
[1:17:22] we praise you
[1:17:28] notice proverbs 27 and 9
[1:17:32] ointment
[1:17:34] and perfume
[1:17:37] rejoice
[1:17:39] the heart
[1:17:45] y'all know what aromatherapy is right
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:50] it is amazing that smell
[1:17:53] can be attached to the heart
[1:17:55] now of course the greek word heart the
[1:17:57] new testament is cardia which is where
[1:17:59] we get cardiac and all that from but it
[1:18:01] was considered by the jews hebrews of
[1:18:03] the old testament jews of the new that
[1:18:05] it was the seat of your emotions
[1:18:10] so fragrance
[1:18:13] amen
[1:18:14] could be so moving that the seat of the
[1:18:18] emotions
[1:18:19] was moved upon
[1:18:21] by fragrance
[1:18:24] if you think that ain't true let
[1:18:26] somebody in front of you run over a
[1:18:28] skunk
[1:18:31] and you follow right in behind that
[1:18:33] smell
[1:18:35] how many has ever done it
[1:18:37] what do you have to do you didn't even
[1:18:38] run over the dude i mean you wouldn't
[1:18:40] even you know nowhere clear near of it
[1:18:42] rather and yet you'll have to roll down
[1:18:44] your windows many times because your car
[1:18:47] why is it my car loves that smell why is
[1:18:50] it that your truck will hold that smell
[1:18:52] you have to roll down your windows and
[1:18:53] let that out well i'm going to tell you
[1:18:55] one thing we and i were stinkers
[1:18:58] we were stinkers we smell like the devil
[1:19:02] well praise the lord
[1:19:04] and remember by the way i'm talking
[1:19:05] about his old dog and he said boy he'd
[1:19:07] kill him out there and he said he hated
[1:19:09] the skunk and he said he'd say get him
[1:19:12] boy get him get him you'll imagine it
[1:19:14] brother branham would have nodded
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:21] no fritz would have looked back to me
[1:19:22] and that's all you got billy
[1:19:25] you want me to go get that skunk and
[1:19:26] you're nodding well that's the way some
[1:19:28] of y'all do the preacher
[1:19:33] look if you want me to get that skunk
[1:19:35] say so
[1:19:38] don't just nod at me with a grin say so
[1:19:41] get him mother daughter get him preacher
[1:19:45] amen go astray
[1:19:54] brother brown said he hated a skunk but
[1:19:57] he said he'd just rattle that bush a
[1:19:59] little bit get him boy get him
[1:20:01] and he said the biggest stinker i know
[1:20:03] of is the devil
[1:20:05] well i hope you understand that the next
[1:20:07] one that had the closest claim on us was
[1:20:10] the devil
[1:20:11] so what does that make you he's a big
[1:20:13] skunk you're a litan
[1:20:15] that's why we acting like the devil we
[1:20:17] live like the devil we lived in the
[1:20:19] world and i'll tell you what we stunk
[1:20:22] and we were nowhere acceptable in the
[1:20:24] presence of god it was only the mercy of
[1:20:27] god that would even let us come to an
[1:20:29] altar and get saved how did he do it
[1:20:33] through the fragrance of the gospel of
[1:20:36] jesus christ
[1:20:40] but after you're called into the body
[1:20:46] don't think you can come to church with
[1:20:47] your besetting sins and you're lying and
[1:20:50] your adulteries and this and that
[1:20:53] and think he will accept you
[1:20:57] now you're a priest
[1:21:01] the protocol
[1:21:02] is applied differently
[1:21:05] go to solomon says ointment and perfume
[1:21:09] rejoice the heart
[1:21:11] so doth the sweetness
[1:21:14] of a man's friend
[1:21:17] by hearty
[1:21:19] counsel
[1:21:21] wow
[1:21:22] you know a real friend will tell you the
[1:21:24] truth
[1:21:24] even if it hurts your
[1:21:26] feelings oh not my friends they don't
[1:21:29] ever tell me the truth then they're not
[1:21:30] really your friends
[1:21:32] because they know you're a baby and they
[1:21:34] know you'll pout on them
[1:21:40] acts chapter 10 verse 37 that word i say
[1:21:43] you know which was published throughout
[1:21:45] all judea and began from galilee after
[1:21:48] the baptism which john preached
[1:21:50] how god
[1:21:54] anointed jesus
[1:22:01] god
[1:22:02] anointed
[1:22:04] jesus
[1:22:05] of nazareth
[1:22:08] isn't it amazing he doesn't call him
[1:22:10] jesus from eternity
[1:22:12] jesus from heaven
[1:22:14] jesus from the seventh dimension
[1:22:20] jesus of nazareth
[1:22:23] isn't it amazing how many times you ever
[1:22:25] noticed in the new testament how many
[1:22:26] times they kept referring to him as
[1:22:28] jesus of nazareth
[1:22:31] that's right you see they had a true
[1:22:33] revelation they had the epoch of their
[1:22:35] mix upright they could preach jesus of
[1:22:38] nazareth they could also preach him
[1:22:40] being the logos they could preach him
[1:22:42] being the son of god son of man son of
[1:22:45] david they had the right mixture from
[1:22:47] the father's apocalypse
[1:22:49] [Applause]
[1:22:52] notice now the lord jesus though he was
[1:22:55] born the word
[1:22:58] he was not the messiah
[1:23:01] until god
[1:23:02] anointed him
[1:23:06] when
[1:23:07] after john
[1:23:10] washed him
[1:23:14] john washed him
[1:23:16] the anointing came on him
[1:23:18] and the father changed his clothes
[1:23:21] on mount transfiguration
[1:23:25] glory be to god
[1:23:27] the lord jesus following the same
[1:23:30] pattern that he gives us
[1:23:33] notice god anointed jesus what was god
[1:23:36] doing god was saying this is my beloved
[1:23:40] son
[1:23:41] this is my
[1:23:43] messiah
[1:23:45] my christians
[1:23:50] i love the hebrew words of this
[1:23:53] god
[1:23:54] anointed
[1:23:55] yeshua
[1:23:57] with ruach
[1:23:59] hey kadosha
[1:24:03] god anointed yeshua
[1:24:06] with rock
[1:24:08] you see this is the word in the book of
[1:24:10] genesis and the spirit of god moved upon
[1:24:13] the face of the deep and that word
[1:24:15] spirit
[1:24:16] is ruach
[1:24:18] elohim
[1:24:20] ruach
[1:24:22] elohim but here is ruach heyday kodesh
[1:24:27] another attribute of god
[1:24:30] now the fullness had come down and god
[1:24:33] is anointing
[1:24:34] jesus
[1:24:38] but some of y'all been okay with jesus
[1:24:40] teaching
[1:24:41] and him sitting down in a chair
[1:24:45] which all thought he was anointed
[1:24:47] the bible says that he sacked
[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:55] so imagine he was saying come unto me
[1:25:00] all you that labor
[1:25:01] and are heavy lane
[1:25:04] i'll give you rest
[1:25:05] but my yoke is easy
[1:25:08] and my burdens are light and you're
[1:25:09] sitting and say
[1:25:10] i've never seen no preacher set
[1:25:13] well he's our own priesthood brother
[1:25:14] donald i'll tell you that right now he
[1:25:16] showed on priests like brother daryl
[1:25:18] brother ron
[1:25:20] so we measure people whether they're
[1:25:22] anointed by whether they preach like
[1:25:24] brother donahue brother ron or brother
[1:25:25] darren
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:28] then neither should you judge people
[1:25:30] because they don't shout the way you
[1:25:31] shout
[1:25:32] and say they're not anointed what's
[1:25:34] that's causing them tears to come out of
[1:25:36] their eyes
[1:25:37] what's causing that something to jump
[1:25:39] inside of their soul and say lord god i
[1:25:42] love you with all of my heart maybe
[1:25:44] you're anointed to jump maybe you're
[1:25:46] anointed to shout they're anointed to
[1:25:48] cry
[1:25:50] or as long as i'm anointed brain god as
[1:25:54] long as i'm anointed to do his service
[1:25:57] that's what i want
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:03] notice ii corinthians 2 15 now paul's
[1:26:05] speaking about the ministry and he said
[1:26:08] for we
[1:26:10] are unto god
[1:26:12] a sweet
[1:26:14] saver
[1:26:16] look at this word
[1:26:18] yehudia
[1:26:20] sweet smelling incense
[1:26:23] an odor or something sweet smelling
[1:26:27] an odor of acquiescence
[1:26:30] satisfaction
[1:26:32] this is the title given to true gospel
[1:26:35] preachers
[1:26:37] and no wonder if satan hates them
[1:26:41] you see it's an illusion to what we just
[1:26:44] read about of the priest
[1:26:46] anointed by the spirit of god
[1:26:50] and they can come with that anointed
[1:26:53] word
[1:26:54] maybe you got a no sire attitude
[1:26:57] you had pickles for breakfast
[1:27:00] and snack
[1:27:02] as a matter of fact you've been on a
[1:27:03] diet of pickles for 14 days and 40
[1:27:05] nights
[1:27:09] but if you can get under his presence
[1:27:13] it'll change you from an old dill pickle
[1:27:15] to a cinnamon roll
[1:27:18] like fluffy and so sweet
[1:27:24] takes away that old bad attitude
[1:27:27] sometimes we need help come on
[1:27:30] what from what the ministers of god are
[1:27:33] anointed it's amazing to me how a
[1:27:35] preacher can tear us one side and down
[1:27:37] the other rip us up one side and down
[1:27:40] the other and we barely make it to the
[1:27:41] car we barely can make it through the
[1:27:43] drive through but after wobbly go to
[1:27:45] feeling better and somebody say where
[1:27:46] you been church
[1:27:50] you mean that's the way you look every
[1:27:51] time though sometimes i look worse
[1:27:54] are you going back you better believe
[1:27:56] i'm going back
[1:28:02] attitude off of me it got rid of my
[1:28:05] temper it got rid of that old rotten
[1:28:07] thing that i needed off of me yes i'm
[1:28:10] going back
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:27] so now ruth's third act
[1:28:30] of preparation
[1:28:34] is to change clothes
[1:28:38] she's to put off the garments
[1:28:41] of a sorrowing widow
[1:28:45] and put on the garments
[1:28:48] of a young lady
[1:28:50] looking for a man
[1:28:56] she's no doubt a poor woman
[1:28:58] but nearly every jew
[1:29:00] would have had at least one
[1:29:03] one
[1:29:04] festive
[1:29:05] garment
[1:29:07] you may have a lot of sad days in your
[1:29:09] life
[1:29:10] a lot of trials you're facing right now
[1:29:13] but if you look in your holy ghost
[1:29:14] closet
[1:29:16] i dare say you'll find at least one
[1:29:18] garment of praise
[1:29:26] you see naomi somehow believed
[1:29:30] that ruth was to be a bride
[1:29:35] clothing in the scripture has a
[1:29:37] spiritual identification we know that
[1:29:40] that's why we believe we have to dress a
[1:29:42] certain way in this day
[1:29:44] you see our parents
[1:29:47] tried to cover themselves
[1:29:52] genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that
[1:29:54] the tree was good for food and it was
[1:29:56] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:29:59] desired to make one wise she took the
[1:30:01] fruit there evan did he and gave also
[1:30:03] unto her husband with her
[1:30:06] and he did it and the eyes of them both
[1:30:09] were open and they knew that they were
[1:30:11] naked
[1:30:14] so after they ate disciple
[1:30:17] they decided to cover the sinful part
[1:30:20] so they made fig leaves and tied around
[1:30:22] their mouths
[1:30:24] so they never eat apples again
[1:30:32] notice the eyes of them both are open
[1:30:35] and they knew that they were naked
[1:30:38] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[1:30:41] made themselves
[1:30:43] loin cloths
[1:30:48] now the english says
[1:30:50] aprons but look at the word here it's
[1:30:53] chogori which is a girdle or a loin
[1:30:56] covering a long cloth
[1:31:01] why would you eat an apple
[1:31:05] and cover with a loin cloth
[1:31:11] well glory
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:16] and they made themselves aprons out of
[1:31:20] what fig leaves
[1:31:22] so they sewed fig leaves together
[1:31:26] and made themselves
[1:31:28] a loin cloth
[1:31:31] now notice and they heard the voice of
[1:31:33] the lord god walking in the garden of
[1:31:35] the cool of the day and adam and his
[1:31:37] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[1:31:39] the lord god amongst the trees of the
[1:31:42] garden and the lord god called unto adam
[1:31:45] and said her name where art i and he
[1:31:47] said i heard thy voice in the garden
[1:31:50] and i was afraid
[1:31:53] because i was naked
[1:31:56] now they're closed with aprons
[1:32:00] but still feel naked
[1:32:05] that's what churchianity will do for you
[1:32:08] that's what just being religious
[1:32:10] i'll do for you
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:15] now it had covered that certain part of
[1:32:17] the body of which they were guilty of
[1:32:19] course
[1:32:20] but ended amazing brother dale that the
[1:32:22] apron could not go to the conscious
[1:32:26] apron could not go to the conscience all
[1:32:28] it could do would cover a certain part
[1:32:29] of the flesh but it could not go to the
[1:32:32] conscience and be able to redeem the
[1:32:34] conscience from the guilt
[1:32:36] of disobedience to his word
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:42] genesis 3 21 and unto adam also and to
[1:32:45] his wife
[1:32:47] did the lord god
[1:32:50] make
[1:32:52] coats huh
[1:32:55] well they got to sew in and made aprons
[1:32:59] god made coats
[1:33:01] this word castle ness
[1:33:04] is a tunic
[1:33:06] or an undergarment
[1:33:08] a long shirt
[1:33:11] like garment
[1:33:13] huh
[1:33:15] so the lord god made them a long tunic
[1:33:20] and no doubt hers has made one way
[1:33:22] and his has made the other
[1:33:26] god don't ever break his principles
[1:33:31] you wouldn't have looked at both of them
[1:33:32] and said which is a woman well they said
[1:33:34] well we can't define what a woman is
[1:33:40] they are birthing people
[1:33:42] they're administrating people
[1:33:45] a bunch of idiots
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:53] heathens
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:55] worthy of hell
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] we wonder why our nation gone where it's
[1:34:01] at they've turned down god and now god
[1:34:04] is turning them down and turning them
[1:34:06] over to reprobates that they don't even
[1:34:09] know what a woman is or what a man is
[1:34:11] and the politicians are afraid to say it
[1:34:14] well here's one preacher that ain't
[1:34:16] in the beginning he made them male and
[1:34:20] female
[1:34:24] hallelujah that's the bible
[1:34:32] go ahead and put me on youtube i'm
[1:34:34] already on there anyhow
[1:34:41] don't you gonna get us in trouble so
[1:34:42] what else is new
[1:34:49] and then to adam also until his husband
[1:34:51] oh no whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:34:53] whoa
[1:34:54] that's the letter c inversion
[1:34:58] yes wife
[1:35:01] show me where god ever joined two men
[1:35:04] together in all mary gays
[1:35:06] show me where god ever joined two women
[1:35:08] together now male lesbians
[1:35:18] it won't be enough for their wings
[1:35:19] tonight to put out a fire will they
[1:35:21] i'll be here you'll be all right
[1:35:24] you will
[1:35:26] well
[1:35:27] you we might be able to put that far
[1:35:33] the skin
[1:35:35] you imagine every time we looked at it
[1:35:39] it was god's
[1:35:40] provision of mercy
[1:35:50] god went out there and got an innocent
[1:35:52] animal
[1:35:53] i had to die now you imagine we're
[1:35:54] talking about a tunic
[1:35:57] had to be a pretty good sized sheep
[1:35:59] where god put them together we don't
[1:36:00] know exactly what it was
[1:36:02] how god went about doing it but god the
[1:36:04] prophet said god throwed it over into
[1:36:06] them behind the bush because they was
[1:36:08] over there afraid god i can't look at
[1:36:11] you god i can't come to church
[1:36:14] lord have mercy friends if people get
[1:36:16] nervous being around a preacher
[1:36:19] if people get nervous and don't want to
[1:36:21] look at a preacher don't want to be
[1:36:22] around a preacher can you imagine what
[1:36:24] it's going to be on the day of judgment
[1:36:25] when you stand before almighty god
[1:36:34] an innocent animal had to die
[1:36:39] that man and woman
[1:36:41] might have
[1:36:43] a new beginning
[1:36:46] and be reminded every day of their life
[1:36:50] this is my nerve
[1:36:55] how can we sit here today and say we are
[1:36:57] the redeemed of the lord we are the
[1:36:59] church of the living god we are a
[1:37:01] habitation of the spirit
[1:37:03] because our garment that we grab ahold
[1:37:06] of by mercy and we say lord
[1:37:09] you gave us this new beginning
[1:37:13] i'm so glad his mercies are renewed
[1:37:16] every morning myself
[1:37:18] [Applause]
[1:37:25] let me find a place to cause them
[1:37:28] genesis 41 14 then pharaoh sin and call
[1:37:31] joseph
[1:37:32] and they brought him hastily out of the
[1:37:34] dungeon
[1:37:35] and he shaved himself
[1:37:37] and changed his garment
[1:37:39] and came in
[1:37:42] unto pharaoh
[1:37:45] his prison garments would have not met
[1:37:48] the protocol
[1:37:50] to walk in before the king
[1:37:54] of kings
[1:37:58] so either the prison guards
[1:38:00] or someone in pharaoh's court
[1:38:04] brought joseph some clothes
[1:38:06] imagine he bathed himself
[1:38:09] shaved
[1:38:10] combed his hair
[1:38:12] put on these garments
[1:38:14] walked right out of prison
[1:38:17] into the court of the camp
[1:38:21] praise be to god
[1:38:24] you're gonna walk right out of this hill
[1:38:26] you're gonna walk right out of this
[1:38:28] laodicea and in a moment be changed in
[1:38:32] the twinkin of an eye and walk right
[1:38:34] into the presence of almighty god
[1:38:44] you see gifts of clothing
[1:38:47] was the most common gift
[1:38:51] in the bible that was given to people
[1:38:54] pharaoh took off his ring from his hand
[1:38:56] and put it on joseph's hand
[1:38:59] and raid him
[1:39:00] investors
[1:39:02] of fine linen
[1:39:05] now watch what happens is that after
[1:39:07] joseph gets
[1:39:09] into his position will say joseph got
[1:39:11] saved
[1:39:12] out of the prison
[1:39:14] then joseph moves into the land
[1:39:17] of adoption
[1:39:22] what he had on was fitting
[1:39:25] to meet pharaoh
[1:39:27] but not fitting to be adopted
[1:39:31] so those of you that are just saying
[1:39:32] well i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved but
[1:39:34] you got to move into the land of
[1:39:36] adoption
[1:39:38] there's more to this great plan than
[1:39:39] just preaching the cross
[1:39:41] 365 days a year
[1:39:43] there's more than just saying well god
[1:39:45] sent a prophet there's more to it than
[1:39:47] that i want to know what he said
[1:39:49] i know god sent a prophet tell me what
[1:39:51] he said tell me what to do
[1:39:56] so noticing joseph
[1:39:58] now stands there just just shortly out
[1:40:01] of prison
[1:40:02] and pharaoh takes his own ring
[1:40:05] off his finger and slide it over on
[1:40:09] joseph's hand
[1:40:11] and he raided him investors are fine now
[1:40:14] this is a linen that i've told you
[1:40:15] before
[1:40:16] in times gone by this linen was worth
[1:40:19] more than gold
[1:40:21] it was made from the flax
[1:40:23] that was grown by the river now
[1:40:26] that's washed down where the blue and
[1:40:28] the white nile both come together the
[1:40:30] top soil as it travels those hundreds of
[1:40:32] miles
[1:40:33] and it makes us this beautiful linen and
[1:40:35] whenever they would wire and the sun
[1:40:37] would shine on it history records have
[1:40:39] herodotus and different historians that
[1:40:41] talk about them when the people would
[1:40:43] stand on that white linen and the
[1:40:45] egyptian sun would shine on them you
[1:40:47] could hardly look at them
[1:40:51] standing there in glistening white
[1:40:53] garments
[1:40:56] praise be to god
[1:40:59] so from a prison
[1:41:01] to standing there in white garments
[1:41:05] let me close
[1:41:06] i'm reminded of the sardisian church age
[1:41:08] when the lord jesus promised
[1:41:10] the rewarding overcomers
[1:41:13] you shall walk with me in white
[1:41:16] for you are worthy
[1:41:21] you imagine brother paul the worthy one
[1:41:23] speaking to mortals and saying you are
[1:41:26] worthy
[1:41:30] why were they dressed in white they were
[1:41:33] dressed in it here
[1:41:35] hallelujah
[1:41:37] fine linen clean and white
[1:41:40] was granted to her
[1:41:42] she's been washed
[1:41:43] in the blood
[1:41:45] of god's own son
[1:41:49] let's marry it
[1:42:02] hallelujah
[1:42:08] praise the lord
[1:42:11] maybe there's some under the sound of my
[1:42:12] voice today and you love the lord jesus
[1:42:15] with all of your heart
[1:42:17] but you've never received the holy ghost
[1:42:19] maybe there's some here today that's
[1:42:21] maybe never even made the commitment or
[1:42:23] maybe you have years ago and you've got
[1:42:24] cold
[1:42:25] you'd like to be renewed in his presence
[1:42:28] whatever your need is
[1:42:31] remember you're not approaching a man
[1:42:34] we're not approaching happy valley
[1:42:36] church
[1:42:37] but we're approaching the king
[1:42:40] what is the protocol
[1:42:42] come into his presence
[1:42:44] with thanksgiving and praise into his
[1:42:47] courts with praise
[1:42:49] how'd the prophet tell us to even pray
[1:42:53] he said don't go to the lord and just
[1:42:55] start making your requests no not sure
[1:42:57] if it's an emergency that's one thing
[1:42:59] but when we come to fellowship with the
[1:43:01] lord
[1:43:03] we should start with praise
[1:43:06] adoration
[1:43:08] love
[1:43:09] thanksgiving
[1:43:11] then start making our needs known
[1:43:14] don't come with me lord i need this i
[1:43:16] need that johnny needs that susie needs
[1:43:17] this billy needs that and fred needs
[1:43:19] that and donny needs that
[1:43:22] god is not a sears and roebuck house
[1:43:24] we're replacing our order
[1:43:27] but he has a protocol
[1:43:30] praise the lord
[1:43:33] praise the lord
[1:43:36] thank you lord jesus
[1:43:40] praise the lord
[1:43:42] i mean it wants to come god's
[1:43:45] way of protocol
[1:43:48] raise your heads and look at me
[1:43:52] there's a suit store about north
[1:43:54] carolina that i bought some suits from
[1:43:57] in the past
[1:43:58] brother joe green told me they was going
[1:44:00] out of business so the other day i
[1:44:01] wanted to go over and
[1:44:03] look and see if they had it
[1:44:06] so the man that that was there i've
[1:44:08] talked to him before is an indian man
[1:44:10] and
[1:44:11] he's going out of business and long
[1:44:12] story short he oh yeah i'll make you a
[1:44:14] good deal make you a good deal
[1:44:17] so i found some suits there and he said
[1:44:22] i don't know if you know or not
[1:44:24] but i have a bridal store
[1:44:26] right back here
[1:44:29] he said has some dresses for the lady
[1:44:33] my lady was standing there by me
[1:44:38] so i said okay we will we'll go you know
[1:44:40] we'll look at it
[1:44:43] so the name of the story was beautiful
[1:44:45] bride something like that
[1:44:47] beautiful bride
[1:44:49] well they had wedding dresses they had
[1:44:51] veils they had all kinds of things
[1:44:53] so his wife from that store
[1:44:57] and so we walked in she said well what
[1:44:59] can i help you with and carol said well
[1:45:00] i'm just just looking a little bit just
[1:45:02] looking
[1:45:04] they had all kinds of dresses with bling
[1:45:07] i mean bling a ling a linga lingalin
[1:45:11] all kinds of stuff and girls i'm not
[1:45:13] sure i'm gonna find anything in this
[1:45:15] place but she got to looking and she
[1:45:17] found a pretty blue dress it was
[1:45:20] bling-less and just a dressy type of
[1:45:22] thing to wear to a wedding you know
[1:45:24] she's not looking for another man i mean
[1:45:25] y'all's weddings is what i'm talking
[1:45:27] about
[1:45:31] so she says
[1:45:34] can i get this one
[1:45:40] now
[1:45:41] if she would have got that dress by
[1:45:43] and got down in the floor
[1:45:46] and screamed and pounded
[1:45:49] it
[1:45:56] i love her but i would have walked out
[1:45:59] of there and left her on the floor
[1:46:08] i wonder how jesus feels when we come to
[1:46:10] him like beggars
[1:46:13] not beggars
[1:46:20] so she found a dress
[1:46:23] that was befitted for the occasion
[1:46:26] and she knew
[1:46:28] the protocol
[1:46:30] she didn't get mad she didn't throw a
[1:46:32] fit
[1:46:34] but she just simply asked
[1:46:37] so you don't have to come today and as a
[1:46:40] sinner oh god oh god i'm so wretched i'm
[1:46:43] so what if you're a sinner come that way
[1:46:45] but if you're children of god don't come
[1:46:47] that way
[1:46:49] come calling him papa
[1:46:51] oh
[1:46:52] father i'm your needy child
[1:46:56] father i've got i've got weaknesses you
[1:46:58] know i do i've got issues
[1:47:00] i've got problems i've got worries
[1:47:04] but i believe you love
[1:47:06] me and i believe you'll reach out your
[1:47:09] scepter to me today
[1:47:12] come on esther
[1:47:14] can you move past your fear
[1:47:17] move past your anxiety
[1:47:19] but what if you want what if he won't
[1:47:22] guarantee he will
[1:47:25] esther didn't even have a promise
[1:47:27] that a hazardous would even reach out
[1:47:30] his scepter to and if he didn't she's
[1:47:31] dead
[1:47:32] but somehow she believed the love she
[1:47:34] had for him and the love he had for her
[1:47:36] he would extend his mercy
[1:47:41] let's not approach him as sinners
[1:47:44] let's not come to church
[1:47:45] as people that are ignorant
[1:47:48] no doubt when we relocate
[1:47:51] we're going to have visitors galore
[1:47:55] we will have some that will visit for
[1:47:57] one time
[1:47:58] and one time only
[1:48:01] so brother donnie what are we going to
[1:48:02] change
[1:48:03] absolutely nothing
[1:48:07] we're still singing we're still
[1:48:09] worshiping we're still preaching the
[1:48:10] same thing don't look for me to change
[1:48:13] what i've preached for all these years
[1:48:16] i'm going to preach the same thing
[1:48:19] and if there's a seed praise god
[1:48:27] we're too close to home
[1:48:29] we're too close to home
[1:48:31] to change now
[1:48:33] we'll have some that will come and visit
[1:48:35] in our midst and we'll come and say lord
[1:48:37] have mercy on goodness gracious but
[1:48:40] remember you you still look like that
[1:48:44] god have pity on you
[1:48:47] stand again
[1:48:56] what about it ruth
[1:48:58] will you listen to instruction
[1:49:01] i won't get over to it in the very next
[1:49:03] verse here maybe next week
[1:49:06] but ruth affirmed to her and said
[1:49:08] all
[1:49:10] that you have said
[1:49:12] i will do
[1:49:15] no questions no reasoning i don't
[1:49:17] understand it
[1:49:20] i just take your word for it amen
[1:49:23] this bower hits again if you would
[1:49:26] whatever you have need of today sickness
[1:49:32] maybe it's an evil spirit that's
[1:49:33] tormenting you
[1:49:36] glory to god
[1:49:39] let's approach him today
[1:49:41] with this protocol
[1:49:48] lord jesus
[1:49:51] is your children father
[1:49:55] we're coming now into your presence
[1:49:57] because we have been
[1:50:00] invited to do so
[1:50:04] lord god we don't want to be as the shoe
[1:50:06] am i too
[1:50:10] just a few days after her wedding
[1:50:14] she began to feel different
[1:50:17] and one night when you come knocking on
[1:50:19] the door you've been out
[1:50:22] walking
[1:50:25] and she was awakened by the sound of
[1:50:27] your voice and you're rapping on the
[1:50:28] door
[1:50:31] but yet she was so sleepy
[1:50:34] she just couldn't get up
[1:50:37] so she laid there and laid there
[1:50:40] and slumber
[1:50:43] finally she got to thinking about it and
[1:50:45] she got up
[1:50:47] she went to the door and she said when i
[1:50:49] took a hold of the handle
[1:50:52] my hands dripped with myrrh
[1:50:55] where you had been there
[1:50:58] wanting to come in
[1:51:00] she's not approaching you as a sinner
[1:51:02] but she is now your
[1:51:04] wife this is a very sad
[1:51:07] portion of the song of solomon but i'm
[1:51:09] glad it's there
[1:51:11] because it helps us to see there'll be
[1:51:13] times in our life
[1:51:15] that will get indifferent
[1:51:17] we'll just layer to see a pressing
[1:51:20] against us
[1:51:21] we'll get sleepy as it were and tired
[1:51:24] which are there still knocking
[1:51:28] or she went through the night
[1:51:30] went out and the watchman found her and
[1:51:32] they beat her
[1:51:33] she couldn't blame you for that that was
[1:51:35] her own negligence
[1:51:38] and she kept saying
[1:51:40] have you saw him
[1:51:42] whom my soul loveth
[1:51:45] i missed him
[1:51:47] i missed him i was lazy i quit reading
[1:51:49] my bible i quit praying
[1:51:51] i couldn't listen to tapes
[1:51:54] i've got indifferent i've got cold
[1:51:57] but i'm looking for him
[1:52:00] she went looking for a church it wasn't
[1:52:02] looking for a preacher
[1:52:04] she was looking for you
[1:52:06] because she had experienced you
[1:52:10] and after experiencing you
[1:52:12] what preacher could ever take your place
[1:52:16] what thing of the world could ever take
[1:52:17] your place
[1:52:20] or jesus
[1:52:21] maybe they're similar today that that's
[1:52:24] kind of where they feel they are
[1:52:26] they've just gotten a little bit cold a
[1:52:28] little bit indifferent
[1:52:31] but lord
[1:52:33] they want to be
[1:52:34] back in fellowship with you again

[1:52:42] lord oh gentle dove of god

[1:53:02] all with a different octave in your
[1:53:04] voice
[1:53:05] and make the pull in one call
[1:53:09] oh jesus

[1:53:33] you need a renewal of your walk
[1:53:36] he's got it for you
[1:53:38] you need a refreshing from the presence
[1:53:40] of the lord

[1:53:45] anymore you've been hanging around leia
[1:53:47] to see you
[1:53:48] you smell like the wrong kind of music
[1:53:51] you smell like the world

[1:54:58] that script

[1:55:11] if he sends another that needs
[1:55:12] forgiveness on and on and on
[1:55:15] i want to be that kind of pharmacist if
[1:55:17] you understand what i'm saying

[2:04:46] sister had a fall this week and
[2:04:48] fell on a piece of rebar and
[2:04:51] come right there to ride just within
[2:04:52] inches of
[2:04:54] of taking our eye out
[2:04:56] but the mercy of god was whether
[2:04:58] we're just just going to ask the lord to
[2:05:00] be western there'll be no
[2:05:02] no negative things that'll come with
[2:05:04] this heavenly father
[2:05:08] lord as i looked at that picture
[2:05:11] that my brother said it was just
[2:05:14] heartbreaking
[2:05:16] but then i looked at it in another way
[2:05:17] and i thought
[2:05:19] it's mercy
[2:05:21] it was mercy given
[2:05:23] thank you so much lord that you spared
[2:05:25] our sister
[2:05:27] we don't always understand why these
[2:05:28] things happen to us in our life but
[2:05:31] lord we know
[2:05:32] that you're with us and you watch over
[2:05:34] us and you help us even when bad things
[2:05:36] happen oh lord god we're praying for our
[2:05:38] sister today
[2:05:40] father you see this need in her body may
[2:05:42] there be no evil that will come of this
[2:05:45] may there be no lasting effects that
[2:05:48] will be in her sight lord lord god may
[2:05:51] she be able to testify for the rest of
[2:05:53] her life

[2:06:12] prayer for her this morning 35 year old
[2:06:14] sister
[2:06:15] gave birth to her four child her fourth
[2:06:17] child
[2:06:18] and
[2:06:19] somehow started having
[2:06:21] things going on in her body and they
[2:06:22] finally determined that it's a gross
[2:06:26] prohibiting the blood from flowing up
[2:06:28] into her brain now she's at this
[2:06:30] swelling i heard from brother mike this
[2:06:32] morning before coming to church
[2:06:34] and
[2:06:34] the brothers has been there of course
[2:06:36] day and night saints have been praying
[2:06:38] from around the world
[2:06:40] we want to just pray for
[2:06:43] not only her but her husband
[2:06:45] the children
[2:06:47] and the church family
[2:06:49] can we take her before the throne of god
[2:06:54] lord jesus you don't always promise us
[2:06:56] that
[2:06:57] the bad things will happen to the bad
[2:06:59] people
[2:07:01] and only good things will happen to your
[2:07:03] children
[2:07:04] but what your promises is
[2:07:06] you'll make all things work together for
[2:07:08] good
[2:07:10] to them that love the lord
[2:07:13] as i sent brother mike that quote this
[2:07:15] morning that i've shared with so many
[2:07:16] down through the years
[2:07:18] and the prophet talked about
[2:07:22] a man that was a captain flying a plane
[2:07:24] his brothers did several of them
[2:07:28] jim mosley
[2:07:30] and the man was out flying a plane
[2:07:33] and the crop dusted and done different
[2:07:35] things but
[2:07:36] something happened and he he crashed
[2:07:40] and he laid in the fire for 10 hours
[2:07:43] before they could get to him
[2:07:46] and they couldn't even
[2:07:48] have a viewing of course at his funeral
[2:07:51] and the prophet talks about it he said
[2:07:54] sometimes we just don't understand these
[2:07:56] things
[2:07:58] and then he quotes romans 8 28.
[2:08:01] i'm not glad that situation happened to
[2:08:03] that brother he had a wife 28 years old
[2:08:06] had a couple of children that was left
[2:08:08] behind
[2:08:09] i'm not glad for the situation that
[2:08:11] happened but i'm so glad that brother
[2:08:13] random said
[2:08:14] even he didn't understand when such
[2:08:16] things happened
[2:08:18] and he could still quote romans 8 28.
[2:08:21] so lord you see this situation with our
[2:08:24] sister
[2:08:25] 35 years old young mother
[2:08:27] of four children now
[2:08:30] that husband i'm sure
[2:08:33] must be
[2:08:34] crying with everything he knows to cry
[2:08:36] out with
[2:08:37] believing asking petitioning
[2:08:41] brother mike lord i know he's a
[2:08:43] pastor that loves the sheep of god
[2:08:46] no doubt that church family today
[2:08:48] they're so broken this is their song
[2:08:50] leader
[2:08:51] and his wife
[2:08:53] we pray for him today father
[2:08:56] we know enough about you to know that we
[2:08:59] don't want to ask against your will
[2:09:02] so if it's your will that this our
[2:09:04] sister come home then we certainly
[2:09:06] will accept that and we will know it's
[2:09:09] the right choice
[2:09:11] but lord until that happens we're asking
[2:09:13] you for healing
[2:09:15] we're asking you for mercy
[2:09:17] by this stage the doctors have no hope
[2:09:21] no answers
[2:09:23] but we know if it be your will
[2:09:27] even now lord jesus you are the jehovah
[2:09:31] of miracles
[2:09:34] so father we ask in the name of jesus
[2:09:37] your will would be done concerning this
[2:09:40] situation father
[2:09:42] and whatever the outcome is whatever the
[2:09:44] answer is when it comes
[2:09:47] we will give you thanksgiving and praise
[2:09:50] knowing that you know best
[2:09:53] we may not understand all these things
[2:09:55] on this side but if we still want to
[2:09:57] know them i'm sure they'll be made clear
[2:10:00] on the other side we committed to you
[2:10:02] today father
[2:10:03] we ask you now that you'd go with us as
[2:10:05] we depart from this place we say it's
[2:10:07] been good to be in your house lord

[2:10:16] day message
[2:10:17] to anoint us father that we can be
[2:10:20] prepared for our bridegroom
[2:10:23] go with us now bring us back at the
[2:10:25] appointed time we pray
[2:10:27] in the name of jesus
