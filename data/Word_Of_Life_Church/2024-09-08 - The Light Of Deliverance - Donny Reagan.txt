========================================

light is there pulsating making it visible for you and you don't have to say no wait a minute ma'am let me flip my switch here let me turn this on turn this off you know you don't do that it's cosmic rays that God put in you so a part of the heavens is in your natural makeup glory be to God that's Cosmic light that's in you that you're made up of full of light cells now that's mic light but God is different light but yet he's light so God is Not Cosmic light but eternal light of course now think of the picture there's a great proof of what I'm fixing to say that God is light and when we're walking in light of God as sons of God God's not Cosmic light but God's life operated through the cosmic light of our bodies our cells so you've got light meters sitting in you this morning your cells have light coming through them glory to God and when we're absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God now can you imagine what it's going to be whenever we get past this Mortal body Lord Jesus them saints of God this morning that are in that sixth Dimension everything is so bright so brilliant everybody that I've heard from as far as around the message of they are whether they had a a vision or dream or whatever it was and they went beyond the curtain of time none of them talked about Shadows none of them talked about Darkness none of them talked about weary sadness but it was so bright the yellows are so yellow the blues are so blue the greens were so green and it was like the light was so brilliant far beyond anything that' ever seen in this life if we could have a glimpse this morning into the sixth dimension where our loved ones are and they are running and praising God and worshiping God and the light is shining all around them no more sickness no more heartache no more trouble and that Dimension is just 20 feet from where we are this morning and what's the message of the hour going to do it's going to take us to that world now watch what analogy that he uses here like a seaweed that you get in the bottom of the sea and a lot of times divers they'll get under these seaweeds and before they know it they're wrapped in such a way they can't get out of it well that's the way sin has done the human being that's the way coldness has done the church that's the way communist has done the nation it's so treacherous then in the human body it wrapped us and is pushing out this light of God by denominations and denying faith and so forth It's pushed out all the Rays of God's great power of Faith now we're not talking about the four light rays that you've got in your natural body that's in yourself that's in there whether you believe it or not but here we're talking about raise of God's Supernatural power that can be hindered if you don't believe it now people say I don't believe in no lot in my body I don't believe it I'm going to the X-ray but it won't show up on me yes it will show up them whether they believe it or don't believe it but when we're talking about the power of God our faith must be aligned with his promise Oh Glory to God it's all pushed out those rays and such a place till we've got to a lodge and now below the lodge the church is cuz it's just pushed all the darkness out even just saying it doesn't happen denying that it could happen see the miracles of god how can I not believe in miracles I am one how can you not believe in Miracles you're born again today you are one we got many people sitting right here in this building today would not be alive where not for a miracle of God sparing their life it'd be a sin for us to disbelieve his promises now Saints now once God knew no we know four is the number of Earthly Deliverance I know four is not one of our favorite numbers I know that we're like threes fives sevens 40s and 50s but four is a very important number when it comes to Deliverance because four is the number of Earthly Deliverance the force man in the fire and the force light and the force for Life Messengers that God was going to use to restore this body listen this in the restoration of the Bride tree I I'll have an Easter of Resurrection for the bride the same as I had for the bridegroom even in lights come to shine the same as in the morning same signs same thing that same light will produce the same fruit they had there it's shining on the same tree amen proves his word now fulfilled I will restore says the Lord I don't believe it don't matter whether you believe it or not he'll still do it that was four four deaths Messengers that kill that tree is that right what was it palmerworm Locust cankerworm caterpillar four messengers of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree one took its fruit one took its bark or took its leaves one took the bark and the other one took its life and he takes all these if you haven't listened to this in a while he takes all these and describes what they are the leaves was them clapping their hands you see it takes a real consecrated child of God in the age that we're living to be able to still worship God when things are going against you but if Satan can steal your praise he's done got you whipped I don't care how much you intellectually believe in the word of God of the how much you come to church you can be as faithful as you can be and sit there like a bump on a pickle God wants you to praise him when you're up he wants you to praise him and you're down he wants you to raise your hands he wants you to clap your hands he wants you to say amen that's what we do as children of God my goodness people go to a soccer game or a ball game or a baseball game or a football game they'll sat out there before long it'll be cold of winter they'll sit out there with them football games my goodness and they'll nearly freeze to death and they'll sit right there and jump up and down and Hunter and scream and we go to the house of God and hardly even bat our eye we ought to be ashamed of ourselves we ought to have such a Jubilation of joy down inside of us if people can Rejoice over a home run if they can Rejoice over a ball game my how ought we to rejoice in the presence of almighty God glory glory now watch four messengers of dogmas kill the tree all but the roots and the four messengers of Death kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree notice he don't say five or I mean that's about how many we've had ain't we in the message we just keep having them no they're not messengers of Life they're Liars no God sent Noble preacher out to the prophet of God to tell us what he meant that's right God sent no Apostle soall to bring Clarity to the message that's a lie straight from the pits of hell you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and set under A God Called man you're going to get the clarity you need as a matter of fact you're going to get enough that it's going to change your body one of these days we don't need another Prophet we don't need somebody else to replace Malachi for we need Christians that are filled with the Holy Ghost who love this word and they're feeding on that word and they won't put up with it notice four messengers of Life restores the tree do you get it amen for God said I will restore he's going to restore it how four death Messengers killed it four life Messengers will restore it what was the first mark Mar Luther justification we still believe in justification what was the second John Wesley by we still believe in sanctification sanctification what was the third Pentecost with a restoration of gifts the Holy Ghost we still believe in that baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fce the word what the word am can't you see why those who just want to stick then with Lutheranism or westernism or even Pentecost they're missing light rays so the Lutheran oh we're going in the Rapture praise God God used Martin Luther yes he did but God sent three more light rays after Luther God sent two more after W Oh Glory to God I'm a Pentecostal Hallelujah we jump and run shout I believe in all of that too but that's only the third light Ray that's only the third messenger we need four because four is the number of Earthly deliverance and this is what we're waiting for Earthly Deliverance oh my notice there were four great prophets one of them Martin Luther began to shine a light it was a little light just very small string of justification Along came wesle a stronger sanctification after Wesley come a stronger than him Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost and another great prophecy but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come of the very word the word of the Lord come to the prophet in the evening lights is to come forc to restore and bring back what Glory turn the heart hearts of the children back to the face of the father's Force light Force light Oh Glory to God Force light aren't you glad we in the force light first light wonderful second light glory to God third light praise the Lord first fourth light Rapture time Rapture time amen the light of Deliverance the light of Resurrection Deliverance is not in the first way second Ray Third Way the resurrection is in the fourth the forth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of Holiness some of our message sisters need some more bark on their trees what brought back the leaf Pentecost glory to God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus it ain't the bark that does that you don't see the bark on the side of a tree and the bark just beating the time out of the old tree just say glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus it's the leaves they're out there they're free glory glory and the wind comes to you know how it is the wind come to praise the Lord praise the Lord but brother Donnie we're in the fourth light we don't need the three now you're adding to what he said you have to have all four if you're going in a rapure you got to be justified you got to be Sanctified you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost you've got to have the token the end time word we need all four sir justification brought back the pul sanctification brought back the bar doctrine of Holiness what brought back the Le Pentecostals what is it Pentecostal leaves what clap their hands Joy rejoicing oh I see that's the problem with some of you folks here at this church a y'all lost your Pentecost a ray of light y'all acting like lutherans or Methodist or Presbyterians come on now add one more light you ain't going to go out of you was just a real I I believe in justification now and I believe in the sanctification I'll tell you one thing I'm jumping from there I'm skipping Pentecost then you skip the leaves on your tree so you're standing there out there in the middle of it and you've got a tree and you've got pulp and you've got bark but you ain't got no leaves on that tree and that's why it is sometimes you go to church and people sit there they just it ain't going to be long it's already happening am leaves are falling off of our trees aren't they and it won't be long we'll take a look at these mountains around here and they going to be ugly as all get out you know what I'm going to be waiting for Lord lets me live next spring why more leaves we go through those Cycles as Believers we go through those Cycles as a church but we don't have to stay in that cycle the earth goes through that cycle but it don't have to stay in that cycle you need to get your leaves back Church you need to get your worship back you need to be that kind of tree oh glory to God I'm holy I'm Justified but you need leaves on them so when the breeze of the Holy Ghost comes through you say yes Lord yes hallelujah hallelujah the joy of the Lord is your strength I don't blame the devil for trying to steal your joy cuz you might be a theologian and how to know have a bit more strength than the man on the moon you know where your joy comes from the Lord Jesus my Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecost that friend don't get in your mind we're talking about denomination on now we're talking about the life that moved in every one of these s these moves these lights the life moved through justification the life moved through sanctification the life moves through the the Pentecost but people w't take the real Pentecost and say trash the whole thing you're not taking my le leaves I said you're not taking my leaves I may go through hard times sometime I may go through time boy I've got to struggle and I just put my hands up and I can't even wave I just oh brother going through a low spot but it's only a low spot I Won't Say I'm a leafy fell I said I'm a leafy fell God called me when he called me to worship him I hope you don't get mad at me if you do it's all right God called me to dance God called me to praise God called me to well Hallelujah to God God called me to worship him God called me to grow Lea I'm talking about big old [Applause] leaves glory to God sh have gness some man that could eat gunpowder instead of black pepper said have a little bit of leaves on his tree notice the force was the word itself the [Applause] word do you believe this made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification being planted sanctification being planted baptism of the oran ations died out and Christ again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid the Lord Jesus ain't just going to set himself on the top of the church ages he wants to cap you off first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away Lord so those the Capstone will sit down upon will have the same type of ministry that he had when he went away and he left them tapes to play right he left them books to read I surely there wouldn't be no man's Tes brother random included that would be be more profound than the Lord Jesus so God could have used him and and recorded every word he ever wanted to say from that time on for 2,000 years and said don't need no more preachers at all this is my voice literally on tape so we just push that glory to God but he's coming back after the same type of ministry he had that when he comes it'll catch the whole thing don't you understand the pulp the bark the leaves those that the life pass through that makes this mystical brid tree oh my brother D poor old rer he he won't be there he will be there Wesley will be there and the real genuine westons they'll be right there in the resurrection them real genuine Pentecostals that have the spirit of God they'll be right there amen but it takes the fourth light from the Capstone shining down and permeates down through the re the whole sides of the whole body of the pyramid to reach down under the pyramid and pull them out of the ground and say come on let's go to heaven come on oh Hallelujah the spirit of God will come from the top down and go down in the heart of the earth my some of them have been eat eaten by the Lions their bodies were thrown in the sea there's not even one Speck of dust left but the power that God will restore by the force light will take the whole body and engulf it and reach down and pull them up and say come on children come up higher there will go the pulp and there will go the bark and there will go the leaves and there will go the light the whole resurrected body of Jesus Christ oh so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing and the Rapture whe they Justified Sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again in the house of God prise lord the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again Jesus said it'll be the same thing at the coming oh then the evening light of Malachi 4 come shining through the darkness to bring the evening light on the predestinated word hallelujah hallelujah I mean what's the fourth message to be what's the fourth Messenger to shine the light on the word the light of Deliverance the words predestinated in has to come forth something has to do it for God said I will restore sayth the Lord I will restore that's right the evening lights come shining through on that predestinated word can I have a few more minutes Matthew 5:14 listen to what you are once you're born again ye are the light of the word a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it under a bushel put it on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify who you the preacher the church glorify your father which is in heaven St John 12:36 we read it or just read it again while you have light believe in the light that you may be the children of light these are not our words we're not trying to separate people ourself and say well if they don't believe that this is the words of the Lord Jesus if you're going in the Rapture you've got to be a children of the evening light cannot wear the brand of a denomination and be a virgin born bride at the same time and the church said Ephesians 5:8 listen it's you for ye were sometimes Darkness but now but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light we were like the Earth and it was Darkness all around us but we ain't darkness no more we may have our trials we may have our test we may have difficulties that we go through but because you're going through a dark time don't mean you're a child of Darkness you are a child of light but it's night time around your life but joy is coming in the morning the sun will come up thank you Lord first Thessalonians 5:5 you are all the children of light and the children Children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness Colossians 1:12 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light this is my inheritance light the spirit the prophet said that was on our lord Jesus is coming to unite himself with this church and it's so close he's spreading forth his great Holy Light to redeem and to bring into Fellowship a Church of the Living God for the Rapture that's near at hand men can turn on the light let me tell you don't refuse the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which brings the warming rays of the Holy Ghost upon you makes a new creature in Christ Jesus it proves so in the days of our Lord Jesus he was the scriptural light of the day he was the light listen to this he wasn't the light until he come on the earth to vindicate the promised word neither was you neither was I but I am now this pull pit don't vindicate the message of Truth this building don't vindicate to messages truth children of God that have received this truth you walking in the world and letting your light so shine you're the proof that Calvary was a success you're the proof God did not send Malachi for in vain Oh Glory to God hallelujah let's go over to the last quote here Brothers there's a man you can turn on the light he is present today right here in now don't get scared when the persecution comes don't get scared there is a light said he would catch his people away
