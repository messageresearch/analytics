[28:57] I hear there's so much going on
[28:58] everywhere around the world there ain't
[29:01] no question we're going through more
[29:03] than well people that's ever been in our
[29:05] life and the waves to get so rough but

[30:04] with all my heart or speak to you
[30:08] tonight on thou aren't beautiful I don't
[30:19] some of y'all go to smile and place on
[30:22] that they actually I wasn't talking
[30:24] about that they yet
[30:28] it's a beauty that's so far beyond the
[30:31] outside Song of Solomon chapter six
[30:35] verse three
[30:44] I am My Beloved's and my beloved is mine
[30:50] he feedeth among the lilies and then if
[30:56] this is him speaking back to her thou
[31:00] art beautiful all my love as tearsa
[31:11] comely as jerusalem terrible as an army
[31:18] with banners turn away thine eyes from
[31:25] me for they have overcome me death can
[31:35] de hell curd and demons couldn't do it
[31:40] nothing could overcome but the eyes of
[31:45] the redeemed simply overwhelming
[31:50] [Music]
[31:52] turn away that eyes from me for they
[31:56] have overcome me the hair is as a flock
[32:02] of goats so apparently it must have been
[32:07] long I mean their hair looked like a
[32:12] flock I mean it's a shame when the men
[32:17] in this day it's a shame when my hair is
[32:20] longer than a lot of women's you can
[32:23] never identify them as looking like a
[32:24] flock of goats praise the Lord
[32:28] so sisters don't you let the world make
[32:30] fun of you you wear your crown you wear
[32:34] your crown and bring glory to God by
[32:37] doing so the hair is as a flock of goats
[32:43] that appear from gilead this prayer
[32:48] together Heavenly Father thank you for
[32:52] this day not only the natural day it's
[32:56] been a beautiful day the Lord we thank
[33:00] you for the hour that we're living as
[33:03] the darkness presses against us it
[33:07] testifies that the seventh morning is
[33:11] about ready to dawn time is running out
[33:15] and the darkness of the world and the
[33:17] darkness of sin is so and groping the
[33:21] world that we're in and the saints of
[33:23] God we feel the pressure of it being
[33:25] around us even though we don't live in
[33:28] that as far as our soul is concerned
[33:31] yeah Lord God we have to deal with it as
[33:36] we ask for your mercy and your help to
[33:40] not in this service would you come once
[33:44] again Lord and just anoint the word and
[33:47] anoint our hearts that we can be able to
[33:50] receive from the Father in Jesus name
[33:53] Amen god bless you may be seated
[34:01] it's not a scriptural point but it is a
[34:05] point that most of us are probably
[34:09] common with and probably would agree
[34:12] with to a degree and the point is that
[34:16] beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
[34:22] when we would think about beauty and we
[34:26] would think well a beautiful house or a
[34:30] beautiful car a beautiful tree we look
[34:34] at the flowers are starting to bloom and
[34:37] we look at the different trees thus far
[34:39] that have come into their stage of
[34:42] blooms and many of them even without any
[34:44] leaves on them and yet they've put forth
[34:48] what God gave them and we look at it oh
[34:51] how beautiful that is so beautiful
[34:54] probably many of you have already said
[34:55] that since spring is right upon us and
[34:58] you pass by you know uh I'd say a
[35:01] beautiful farm it's got green rolling
[35:04] hills or whatever type of landscape that
[35:06] you like and you say look at that place
[35:09] look how beautiful that is that is so
[35:11] beautiful and then maybe you drop down
[35:14] you see a certain car a truck or
[35:16] whatever more that's the color you like
[35:19] or the kind of vehicle that you like and
[35:20] say that is so beautiful I'd love to
[35:24] have one like that or maybe it's a lake
[35:25] maybe you go to the lake or maybe you're
[35:27] an ocean person and you stand on the
[35:30] bank of the Atlantic or the Pacific or
[35:32] the Mediterranean or the Aegean or the
[35:34] black or whatever seer ocean that it is
[35:37] you look at that isn't that beautiful
[35:39] maybe yours is a taste of the white
[35:41] sands and the and the blue waters or
[35:44] maybe yours is more like the rockbound
[35:46] coast of Maine or the coast of England
[35:49] or parts of Australia where I've been to
[35:51] where that it's not necessarily the sand
[35:53] but it is the rock and the crevices and
[35:56] how that it splashes against the rocks
[35:58] and you look at anything that is
[36:00] absolutely beautiful well you know you
[36:03] don't have somebody else to come bound
[36:04] they look at so I don't say anything
[36:06] pretty about it I was born here all my
[36:08] life
[36:09] all my life don't stand out to me so to
[36:12] people looking at exactly the same thing
[36:15] one would think that it was beautiful
[36:18] and the other one would would think it's
[36:19] very common there's nothing really
[36:21] outstanding about it at all so we know
[36:24] then that people can look at the very
[36:27] same object or look at individuals and
[36:31] one declare how homely
[36:33] how humiliating how ugly and another one
[36:37] would see absolutely nothing but beauty
[36:41] now beauty can be defined in many ways
[36:44] you know it's it's amazing when you
[36:46] study the cultures of people not only of
[36:49] cultures that have been but cultures
[36:51] that are now and in some of the tribal
[36:53] Africans they still have the the idea
[36:57] the conception of beauty that it is the
[37:00] tribal scars
[37:01] so whenever they are young they will
[37:03] start scarring up their faces men and
[37:06] women alike specially the women and
[37:07] they'll start scarring up their faces
[37:10] and to them that is beauty so many of
[37:13] them will take even serpent chains and
[37:16] they'll start cutting and scarring up
[37:18] and the more scars you have the more
[37:21] beautiful that you are of course that
[37:23] doesn't go over in our culture and the
[37:24] Western thinking we hate scars for the
[37:26] most part we do everything in the world
[37:28] we can to try to cover them up because
[37:30] of our mindset it takes away from our
[37:33] beauty and yet beauty is a wonderful
[37:36] sound and it certainly has been
[37:38] commercialized by the devil especially
[37:41] in the way that we think about it some
[37:42] of you want to right now where is he
[37:44] going don't worry it'll be right in the
[37:46] word all the way but remember that God
[37:49] now in this parallel of course this runs
[37:52] from the Song of Solomon Solomon himself
[37:54] speaking to the Shulamite but it is a
[37:57] parallel of the Lord Jesus and how he is
[38:00] looking at his bride now the world looks
[38:03] at her even from the outside her
[38:06] appearance her dress her mannerisms the
[38:08] way she does places she goes doesn't
[38:10] know they identify that as an occult or
[38:14] a strange and weird people because they
[38:17] do not understand the
[38:19] set of the beauty of holiness now there
[38:23] is a beauty of holiness and probably
[38:26] many of you don't even know the meaning
[38:28] of the word holiness the Hebrew word it
[38:31] is not a long hair and a long dress that
[38:35] is not what the word holiness means the
[38:37] word holiness means separation coming
[38:40] apart
[38:41] now it's dressed part of it it is but
[38:43] that's not the only thing is part of you
[38:45] see you could wear a long dress but if
[38:47] your nature said with a word you still
[38:49] ain't holiness you can be in can cut
[38:51] your hair and not dress like women and
[38:54] all that sort of thing but if in your
[38:55] spirit you're still part of the world
[38:57] you still aren't holding this yet but
[39:00] real true holiness is also
[39:01] sanctification of your spirit and of
[39:04] your mind as well so then when we would
[39:07] worship God in the beauty of holiness it
[39:10] is the divine honour of God beauty is
[39:13] actually an attribute of God now if it
[39:16] was not than every flower every tree
[39:19] every star every planet everything that
[39:22] God made that would be absolutely
[39:24] nothing beautiful about it now if
[39:27] holiness and ugliness and all of that if
[39:30] that was the only thing that would be
[39:32] humility and God's eyes then every
[39:35] flower would have to be ugly
[39:37] there could be no pretty flowers there
[39:39] could be no beautiful trees there could
[39:41] be no beautiful landscape if all beauty
[39:44] is of the world while some of you all
[39:46] are really looking at me strange but
[39:49] remember what Satan has done now as
[39:51] tried to take the outside beauty and to
[39:55] make that more than the inward beauty
[39:57] which can go along with it as well but
[40:00] God looks at beauty in a total different
[40:02] way than the world now the world would
[40:05] be able to look at something that would
[40:06] be beautiful and God would be able to
[40:09] look at some of that and he would say I
[40:11] agree that is divine beauty but what the
[40:14] majority of the world would identify as
[40:18] beautiful and they would say my look at
[40:20] that beautiful woman and then to them as
[40:22] your to the world she's gonna have her
[40:24] face painted of course her haircut she's
[40:27] gonna have on an ungodly dress this
[40:29] that and the other and for the most part
[40:31] that's what they would identify beauty
[40:33] and that's really a shame already I can
[40:34] tell already right here tonight that you
[40:36] all are thinking beauty is only in the
[40:39] appearance of a woman that's very sad
[40:41] you need to read your Bible more beauty
[40:44] has much more to do with the way that a
[40:46] woman looks it has much more to do then
[40:49] would you say that that's a handsome men
[40:51] you're totally missing so much of the
[40:53] declared beauty of God in the creation
[40:55] of the world now everything in the
[40:58] Earth's and in the world that God has
[41:00] made it has its own place and it has its
[41:03] own designation of whether it is plain
[41:06] or simple whether it is beautiful or
[41:09] whether it is designated it is something
[41:10] that is simply necessary but really
[41:13] isn't as beautiful as something else but
[41:15] yet the Lord speaks to his bride and
[41:18] says to her here in verse 4 thou art
[41:21] beautiful all my love as tearsa which
[41:24] was the capital of one of the kingdoms
[41:26] when the kingdom was divided also calmly
[41:29] as Jerusalem terrible as an army with
[41:32] banners so here now the Lord Jesus is
[41:35] looking at the bride and giving to her
[41:37] on an attribute that she is beautiful
[41:41] now there again keep in mind that beauty
[41:43] can be defied by different things now
[41:46] let me give you an example so you know
[41:47] which way I'm going to go now one day a
[41:49] mother had sent her daughter off to
[41:52] college and the girl had been gone for
[41:54] quite some time and she decided to bring
[41:57] her girlfriend homeless earnest she was
[42:00] the closest girl and schoolís her and
[42:02] she was going to meet her mother at the
[42:05] train station now whenever she comes up
[42:08] to the train station and her mother the
[42:10] daughter sitting on the outside of the
[42:12] train and she sees her daughter and her
[42:14] daughter is sitting there was she's
[42:16] visible and the mother runs up to the
[42:18] train and she begins to wave and wave
[42:20] and wave and the girl which has come
[42:22] home as a daughter she looks out the
[42:25] window at the mother and she sees her
[42:27] there and she says oh my goodness look
[42:29] at that horrible woman Oh wouldn't you
[42:33] hate to sit down and have to eat dinner
[42:36] with that woman
[42:38] look at her she is so ugly she is so
[42:42] horrible looking well whenever the
[42:46] girl's girlfriend said that then
[42:48] automatically that did something to the
[42:51] girl so the girl then she began to all
[42:54] yes that is awful can you imagine
[42:56] looking at that woman every day well
[42:59] whenever the train come to a stop and
[43:01] then the girls both got up and walked
[43:03] out this ugly woman come up to the young
[43:06] girl and she grabbed her and kissed her
[43:08] in the heart during and she said oh
[43:10] darling I've missed you so much and I've
[43:13] missed you and the girls girlfriend it's
[43:15] looking at her as you know she just has
[43:17] this puzzled look on her face so the
[43:19] daughter says I don't know who you are
[43:21] get away from me I don't know who you
[43:24] are keep your hands off of me don't
[43:26] touch me get away from me well the local
[43:30] train conductor which knew this woman I
[43:33] knew this girl he comes up to the young
[43:37] girl and it was more than it was more
[43:42] than what he could take so he put his
[43:46] hands on the shoulders of this young
[43:49] girl and he says to her aren't you
[43:53] ashamed of yourself
[43:57] the reason you are so pretty and so
[44:02] beautiful it's because when you was a
[44:05] baby your house caught on fire and this
[44:09] woman was you're ashamed of was outside
[44:13] Hagin clothes and the fire people came
[44:17] but nobody would go in the house because
[44:19] it was so bad but this woman that you're
[44:22] ashamed of your mother took the clothes
[44:25] off of her back run in the house right
[44:29] upstairs and grabbed you out of the baby
[44:32] bed and took her very own clothes and
[44:35] wrap cheering her clothes so you would
[44:39] not be burned and he said you are the
[44:43] reason she is okay
[44:47] the train conductor turned around to the
[44:50] woman and said even though she was ugly
[44:52] even though she was so scarred but the
[44:55] train conductor said those scars are
[44:59] beautiful now you think of us when we
[45:06] were lost in the world lost without God
[45:10] and the Lord Jesus come to this earth
[45:14] hallelujah and he took our sin our shame
[45:18] our degradation every sin that we were
[45:21] upon him he went to that whipping post
[45:25] so you could be healed of your back
[45:27] trouble he went to the whipping post so
[45:30] you could be healed if your kidney
[45:31] trouble or your reflux or your blood
[45:34] pressure your sugar whatever this you're
[45:37] dealing with and the world might look at
[45:38] and say oh he was a coward it's a shame
[45:41] that he's that way but it's all depends
[45:44] on how you look at it in the eyes of a
[45:47] child of God that needs healing and they
[45:50] look at those scars on the back of the
[45:52] Lord Jesus in the eyes of the beholder
[45:55] those scars are beautiful the world may
[46:00] look at him so that is so pitiful I
[46:03] could never look at that but in the eyes
[46:05] of the beholder it is something friend
[46:08] oh my he did not sand and they wrap him
[46:12] in gold and silver and tapestry that
[46:14] would be deserving of a great king but
[46:17] he went there with the love in his heart
[46:19] the house was on fire and you were dying
[46:22] you were burning up as it were on the
[46:24] inside Gabriel could not go in one word
[46:28] could not go him the priests could not
[46:31] go here the spirit God the Father God
[46:33] invisible immortal as he was could not
[46:37] go in but the Lord Jesus said I will go
[46:42] we'll go here I will become their
[46:44] recruits I will become their sin I will
[46:48] allow their scars to be placed on me
[46:51] that I asked you tonight how do you view
[46:54] those scars are you setting the Lord
[46:57] Jesus are you a shape as it a dress a
[47:01] certain way or look a certain way or do
[47:04] you say I am proud to bear the scars of
[47:09] the gospel of Jesus Christ so I see what
[47:26] is beauty
[47:28] what makes beauty so when you need
[47:33] healing do you want a beautiful doctor I
[47:36] have some someone where are you willing
[47:41] to go to a wooden post on there's blood
[47:43] and sinew in tissue in parts of his
[47:47] muscles from the cat of nine tails Aslan
[47:51] at his feet and his blood Souls spilled
[47:54] out it look like an animal have been
[47:56] massacred or will you hang your head and
[48:00] so well so and so sure than that I don't
[48:02] want them to know I believe in Shelton I
[48:05] don't care who's here I want them to
[48:07] know I believe in the power of God I am
[48:10] not ashamed of the scars of my Lord
[48:14] Jesus and I'll tell you one thing if
[48:15] you're a child of God you will also bear
[48:17] in your walk scars for him you will not
[48:21] go in this world without being scarred
[48:24] and be trampled on by the world but
[48:26] you're gonna bear scars one way or
[48:28] another why why shouldn't you BAM for
[48:30] the king of light instead of the king of
[48:32] darkness how then will the divine beauty
[48:38] burst and created in him by the Almighty
[48:43] how will a beautiful life ever become
[48:49] divided and shared among those which are
[48:53] not lovely at all
[48:56] how would you ever take a beautiful life
[48:59] and get that beautiful life out of the
[49:05] not so beautiful
[49:07] bottle you see the Lord Jesus was not a
[49:12] handsome fella on the outside as a
[49:17] matter of fact the way the scripture and
[49:19] the Prophet projects the Lord Jesus
[49:25] imagine if we would have looked at him
[49:27] it had been the kind of appearance that
[49:30] you'd felt sorry for it he would have
[49:35] not had the look that you'd have looked
[49:37] at him and said he's a handsome guy
[49:40] no his appearance would have been almost
[49:43] something that would have turns you away
[49:46] or God you see as gospel is the same way
[49:56] and it makes me sick when you see people
[50:01] that do not want to hear or preach or
[50:04] live the gospel as it is straight
[50:07] sometimes hard sometimes difficult but
[50:11] they want to put it up in the worldly
[50:13] beauty and wash it all down and take all
[50:16] this out of it not out of it you
[50:18] compromise her but yet he calls us
[50:25] beautiful and yet we know in reality
[50:29] there was absolutely nothing about us
[50:32] that was beautiful at all our nature was
[50:37] awful our attitudes who are terrible
[50:41] many of you your language was as filthy
[50:44] as a sailor your habits and life are
[50:49] ungodly and unclean and you were
[50:52] wretched and vile
[50:54] how are you ever gonna bring our people
[50:58] like that
[50:59] into a state to where he can look at her
[51:03] and say I'm not beautiful I am NOT
[51:09] company but you are
[51:12] I will crown you with that which I chose
[51:19] not to resemble only inwardly but I will
[51:26] give you of my own attributes in so much
[51:29] that the world will take notice of you I
[51:35] will actually allow you to accede and
[51:39] glory over what I did when I was a human
[51:45] I will allow them to acknowledge you
[51:50] they ridicule me they make fun of me but
[51:54] I will be with you in such a way they
[51:58] will ask you for prayer when they're in
[52:01] diary and it is my glory upon you they
[52:06] ridicule me they call me Beelzebub somes
[52:19] 4510 hearken o daughter and consider and
[52:25] incline a near forget also thine own
[52:30] people and that father's house you see
[52:35] Psalms 45 is the parallel to the Song of
[52:40] Solomon it's the king and his love for
[52:46] his wife so shall the King greatly
[52:51] desire thy beauty
[52:56] for he is the Lord and worship valium so
[53:05] here he likens this he cons descends to
[53:09] the language of a natural man and woman
[53:14] that are a man that would be made to an
[53:16] attractive woman and he but related to
[53:19] her I desire you and I desire to be with
[53:22] you and I want to spend time with you
[53:25] and God condon sense to that level and
[53:28] says the king will desire thy beauty so
[53:37] this is my question to you where did you
[53:41] get that beauty you were born ugly
[53:49] because she was born in sin no matter
[53:55] how much you want to think here's
[53:56] something in your flesh is this and that
[53:58] and the other it is sin it is rotten
[54:01] it's no good but yet the Lord has so
[54:06] transformed the elect that he attributes
[54:11] to them a beauty
[54:13] which deity desires so it cannot be the
[54:17] perfection of humans are trying this and
[54:20] the human trying that and a human
[54:23] learning how to refrain from this and a
[54:25] human disciplined himself to do this and
[54:27] that in there that that's works does God
[54:30] want that from us he does but he could
[54:32] never look at that and attributed to
[54:35] something that deity itself could latch
[54:38] onto an order for deity to desire a
[54:41] beauty it must be a deity that can be
[54:44] able to correlate to the beauty inside
[54:47] the individual so it has to be from the
[54:50] attributes of God the very works of God
[54:53] himself in the lives of the chains
[54:56] individuals that God can say you
[55:00] beautiful and I desire thy beauty think
[55:11] other children
[55:12] God don't want our church we've got a
[55:17] nice place how thank the Lord for it
[55:18] don't you God don't want our church
[55:20] building when the rapture comes brother
[55:22] Phil he'll leave it right here our
[55:26] clothes are clean and nice thank God for
[55:28] that
[55:28] these clothes ain't going in the rapture
[55:30] hey there's yours you got a nice face to
[55:32] live thank God for that you grab a nice
[55:34] automobile that's nice that raptures not
[55:37] for automobiles and people who clothes
[55:39] it's for beautiful people you see this
[55:49] is actually the divine beauty contest
[55:54] except we don't strip off make it and
[55:56] get on television we'll learn how to
[55:59] sing and dance but it is the search for
[56:02] the most beautiful woman in the world
[56:06] now remember the most beautiful woman
[56:09] that was ever made was Eve in the Garden
[56:14] of Eden the conquest for the most
[56:17] beautiful woman in the world is still
[56:20] ongoing
[56:21] now the churches of course all claim
[56:24] that they're her so they got miss
[56:27] Baptist she entered in the contestants
[56:29] yes as Miss Baptist and then you got
[56:31] Miss Church of God and then you got miss
[56:33] Church of Christ and you got on and on
[56:34] and on and they all they're all of
[56:36] course saying they're the one well
[56:38] you're going to win this contest
[56:40] but the elect of God are the ones that
[56:43] are saying we're not worthy
[56:44] we can't even enter this contest I mean
[56:47] the world
[56:48] nothing about us that's any good she'll
[56:51] be the winner
[56:52] [Applause]
[56:54] but cozy others will present works of
[56:57] their hands or Psalms they can sing our
[56:59] buildings they have dine or programs if
[57:02] they've been able to accomplish but yet
[57:04] the length of God they come knowing that
[57:06] they were born in Laodicea naked and
[57:10] they would still be naked worried not
[57:12] for a road to cover their nakedness
[57:15] [Applause]
[57:20] Psalms 48 one a song and Psalm for the
[57:24] sons of korah great is the Lord and
[57:27] greatly to be praised in the city of our
[57:31] God and the mountain of his holiness
[57:36] beautiful for situation the joy of the
[57:42] whole earth is Mount Zion on the sides
[57:45] of the North the city of the Great King
[57:50] now remember Zion is always the bride
[57:54] you know we have a double parallel in
[57:57] the meaning of the scripture of course
[57:58] it wasn't actually Zion David remember
[58:01] when in and took this city
[58:03] Jebus before it was named Jerusalem he
[58:07] took it from the Jebusites it was by
[58:09] divine command of God of course because
[58:11] it was near here that job was buried it
[58:14] was near here that Abraham was very and
[58:17] the Cave of Machpelah it was here that
[58:20] David common bought the threshing floor
[58:23] of Araunah and and he was able to
[58:25] purchase it and he was also not just
[58:27] about the threshing for the sympathy you
[58:29] look at the amount of property when
[58:30] David was given the title deed the list
[58:33] written in the scripture and the amount
[58:35] of - shekels that was paid it was also a
[58:37] large encroachment of land and that
[58:40] would not only be a place for the altar
[58:42] to be but it would also be enhanced
[58:44] until what would be called the city of
[58:46] David notice which direction that it is
[58:49] it's on the sides of the north remember
[58:53] it was the sides of
[58:55] NORs that satan decide well glory
[59:00] it was the north side of the heaven that
[59:03] he started his revolt it was the size of
[59:06] the Norse that he said he would insult
[59:09] himself above the throne of God I will
[59:12] exalt myself and go up to the sides of
[59:14] the north but God said you're not
[59:16] getting the sides of the north you're
[59:18] getting the sides of the pit well praise
[59:21] the Lord God said the sides of the north
[59:25] belong to me
[59:28] amen so beautiful for situations so
[59:32] beauty them is also identified in a
[59:35] predestinated position by which we hold
[59:39] now I believe David was inspired as I'm
[59:41] sure you do when he went in and he
[59:43] conquers this city of Jamis because it
[59:45] was a city that had great walls and menu
[59:48] that had been there seen pictures of it
[59:49] and it was a very strategic type of
[59:51] place made it very difficult to be able
[59:53] to try to conquer it but there was a
[59:55] waterway on the inside unlike many of
[59:58] the cities around and they would have to
[59:59] go outside or they build in a stream so
[1:00:02] when they would come to conquer them
[1:00:03] they would be able to conquer it because
[1:00:04] they held off the water supply but on
[1:00:07] the inside of this city was a whale on
[1:00:10] the inside so that was water that run
[1:00:13] underneath the city souland they would
[1:00:16] try to capture the city and cut off
[1:00:19] their water supply that couldn't cut it
[1:00:21] all because they had a well of living
[1:00:22] water on the inside
[1:00:25] [Applause]
[1:00:28] there you go all the whales doing this
[1:00:31] and I know revival here and there and
[1:00:33] there that don't affect us we have a
[1:00:36] while of living water on the inside
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:44] there but remember it was through this
[1:00:46] hidden water canal or channel about
[1:00:49] what's David and his men were able to
[1:00:52] sneak through and by that they took the
[1:00:55] city by conquest and he could make it
[1:00:57] his capital but yet David was not
[1:00:59] remained I'll be happy with it being
[1:01:02] just like it was before so expands it to
[1:01:05] the sides of the north and then David
[1:01:07] enhances this and calls it the City of
[1:01:10] David so here this is the part now that
[1:01:13] God special of Jerusalem but God loved
[1:01:16] the City of David over his love for the
[1:01:20] main body or the original allotment of
[1:01:22] the city of Jerusalem can't you see the
[1:01:24] broad the church that God will
[1:01:25] understand he cares for the church and
[1:01:28] he will save the church but the City of
[1:01:31] David is where the Thrones are going to
[1:01:34] be now here then beautiful for situation
[1:01:38] the joy the whole earth is Mount Zion on
[1:01:41] the sides of the north the city of the
[1:01:44] Great King no one not Jerusalem itself
[1:01:46] because sign itself is separated away
[1:01:49] from Jerusalem notice again Psalms 94 17
[1:01:53] let the beauty of the Lord our God be
[1:01:59] upon us oh my goodness
[1:02:05] so God must have something about his
[1:02:09] character nature attributes or something
[1:02:15] that is beautiful
[1:02:18] let the beauty of the Lord our God be
[1:02:23] upon us and establish how the work of
[1:02:26] our hands upon us yeah the work of our
[1:02:28] hands established thou it now notice
[1:02:31] this is a prayer David may not have even
[1:02:34] understood what he was praying but he
[1:02:36] had been into the presence of God and
[1:02:38] now to know that there was such Majesty
[1:02:41] and such magnificence about the presence
[1:02:44] of God and apparently been able to see a
[1:02:45] little bit of the brilliance of the
[1:02:47] light of God and David knew that there
[1:02:49] was a beauty about the Lord which mortal
[1:02:52] people had never really broke into just
[1:02:55] a few here and there and he was able to
[1:02:57] read in the law the tour of the mission
[1:02:59] and knew what Moses had been able to see
[1:03:00] and certain selected ones down through
[1:03:03] the age and he knew there was something
[1:03:05] about God that God wanted to share with
[1:03:08] these people that this man is not going
[1:03:09] to ask this unless it could be granted
[1:03:11] you believe that so it was like there
[1:03:14] was a thirst in David and there was
[1:03:17] something outside of that thirst to be
[1:03:19] able to come and meet this search so he
[1:03:20] didn't ask for gold or silver or you
[1:03:23] know something like that but he asked
[1:03:25] for the beauty of the Lord to be upon
[1:03:28] the people again Psalms 1 49 verse 4 for
[1:03:32] the Lord take us pleasure listen to this
[1:03:35] I love the scripture the Lord take us
[1:03:37] pleasure the Lord take us pleasure in oh
[1:03:46] you mean not all people now if you folks
[1:03:52] ain't careful you're going to be respect
[1:03:53] to persons then this is what the Bible
[1:03:58] says the Lord take us pleasure in his
[1:04:02] people he loves them above and beyond
[1:04:06] other people you say that ain't fair
[1:04:11] don't you set over that hypocritical
[1:04:13] attitude you hypocrite you set there and
[1:04:16] love your family more than you love
[1:04:18] anybody else in the world and you're
[1:04:19] gonna Q Scarlett doing some but you do
[1:04:21] every day of your life
[1:04:27] is it Apocrypha for you all to love your
[1:04:31] daughters and sons more than you love my
[1:04:33] daughters don't accuse God doing the
[1:04:36] same thing you do and he does it in a
[1:04:39] divine way you do it in a human right a
[1:04:42] man but the Lord now notice how they a
[1:04:46] hapa to tell you how could he see this
[1:04:48] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:04:50] break into an understanding of God that
[1:04:52] the Lord take his pleasure
[1:04:54] Almighty God friends think ooh they're
[1:04:56] talking about we're not talking about a
[1:04:58] mortal man we're talking about Almighty
[1:05:00] God takes pleasure in his people his
[1:05:04] people actually do something to him that
[1:05:08] is able to bring him pleasure
[1:05:10] what could we give what could we do what
[1:05:14] in the world could we as mortals ever do
[1:05:16] that would give an eternal Almighty
[1:05:19] hello him puts had a need of nothing yet
[1:05:23] somehow we render him pleasure for the
[1:05:32] lord taketh pleasure and his people he
[1:05:39] will you see Jacob had 12 sons but there
[1:05:53] was only one of those 12 that he
[1:05:56] beautified with the coat of many colors
[1:06:07] he didn't make all the rough summer call
[1:06:10] but he made Joseph a beautiful goat a
[1:06:15] coat of many colors naturally I said
[1:06:18] doesn't mean anything really today but
[1:06:20] to no to the expense of how expensive
[1:06:22] that dyes were specially the Reds and
[1:06:25] the Maroons and the balloons the Blues
[1:06:27] come from a mollusk out of the sea and
[1:06:30] the Reds come from a little lady tiny
[1:06:32] brewery
[1:06:33] very rather they come off with an oak
[1:06:35] tree that was just so sparse she'd find
[1:06:38] one here and find another 100 miles away
[1:06:40] and find another 100 miles away and to
[1:06:43] see the cost that was involved and being
[1:06:45] able to make this coat of many colors
[1:06:48] why he wanted him to have such a diverse
[1:06:51] walk before him and that love and what
[1:06:54] did this coat signify it signified he
[1:06:57] was chosen above his brothers this is
[1:07:02] why they got jealous why because they
[1:07:06] was not brought I mean because they
[1:07:08] didn't have a coat of many colors and
[1:07:10] they looked at that coat of many colors
[1:07:12] and when they saw that they knew what it
[1:07:15] represented it represented a special law
[1:07:18] it represent I was so my preacher with a
[1:07:21] knight it represented the special love
[1:07:23] that their daddy had for Joseph it
[1:07:26] represented a special position that
[1:07:28] Joseph had which was above their
[1:07:30] position it signified all of the collars
[1:07:34] all of the majesty it also signified he
[1:07:37] was next in line to be the chief of the
[1:07:40] tribe and one one one out of 12
[1:07:55] was beautified will salvation I'll tell
[1:08:03] your friends I feel so sorry for folks
[1:08:04] that don't say election it is all
[1:08:06] through the Bible everywhere we look
[1:08:09] now David said that the Lord taketh
[1:08:12] pleasure in his people that he will
[1:08:13] beautify notice he's and he will not
[1:08:16] beautify the proud it's not the rich
[1:08:20] it's not the poor
[1:08:21] that's not your identification the
[1:08:24] identification is the meek those that
[1:08:28] can humble themselves now we're told my
[1:08:30] bride material he loves them above all
[1:08:35] people that's on the earth well I'm
[1:08:37] gonna go ahead and perch it he loves his
[1:08:42] people not all mankind know not all
[1:08:47] mankind on the same level well some of
[1:08:48] you still struggle with that it you know
[1:08:50] you're under the care of this divine
[1:08:52] providence it gives them water gives
[1:08:53] them sunshine he gives them many many
[1:08:56] things and all of them will share many
[1:08:58] things when it comes to that but when it
[1:09:00] comes to being beautiful with salvation
[1:09:03] the elect of God moved into that sphere
[1:09:06] that others can only dream can I go on
[1:09:15] so it is Byron making this it is a
[1:09:19] reflection of the nature of an ornament
[1:09:23] a declaration if you will an ornament by
[1:09:28] which God puts upon the life of these
[1:09:31] individuals and it's not themselves it's
[1:09:34] not that certainly different than
[1:09:36] anybody else on the earth even any
[1:09:38] different than the rest of their
[1:09:39] brothers I mean look at Joseph what's it
[1:09:41] because his mama was matter well
[1:09:43] Benjamin come along and yet Benjamin
[1:09:45] that being of the same mother another
[1:09:46] same father yet Benjamin never received
[1:09:49] a coat
[1:09:51] Benjamin never received the position
[1:09:53] Joseph is going to have why he was
[1:09:55] chosen of God and Jacob was able to
[1:09:59] identify their choosing
[1:10:01] and then by changing his clothes or
[1:10:04] glory by changing his clothes
[1:10:07] so his clothes signified his position I
[1:10:10] cannot say it don't let the world and
[1:10:12] these bunch of stripped all the way of
[1:10:14] the sins make fun of your sisters you
[1:10:16] hang your head high as the daughter of
[1:10:18] God and realize they're blind they don't
[1:10:20] know what you're talking about those
[1:10:22] don't have nothing to do with it it sure
[1:10:24] did with Joseph it sure did but the
[1:10:27] shuttle of azure come on ships oh now
[1:10:34] the same of us in all as far as words it
[1:10:37] we're not worthy but why why are we able
[1:10:40] to walk into the fullness of the
[1:10:42] atonement on a different level than just
[1:10:44] salvation people all might there be
[1:10:46] millions and that we say well what I've
[1:10:48] done Tom that just being saved we're
[1:10:50] talking about being clothed with the
[1:10:52] garment the garment of what the
[1:10:55] representation of the mixed colors and
[1:10:57] the diversities of the attributes of God
[1:11:00] that are pulled in one corner don't you
[1:11:02] see what the Lord Jesus done for you the
[1:11:04] garment of salvation the road that's
[1:11:06] going to be placed surrounds you it is
[1:11:08] not just for healing it's not just for
[1:11:11] more money to pay your bills that's part
[1:11:13] of it sure but it contains so many of
[1:11:16] the attributes of God you've got the
[1:11:18] blue you've got the indigo you've got
[1:11:20] the red you've got the purple
[1:11:21] you've got the yellow you got the amber
[1:11:24] you've got the amethyst you've got all
[1:11:25] of these yellow Jasper that's in this it
[1:11:28] consummates the entirety of God's love
[1:11:31] in a row placed upon those of you that
[1:11:34] he has chosen to dress you up I'm
[1:11:42] telling you one thing here ain't no way

[1:13:04] asked for this you think it's these
[1:13:09] brothers that want these tuxes or
[1:13:10] someone will dress up in tuxes and
[1:13:12] they'll do all that but who is it that

[1:13:32] come on Saints why who made it well of
[1:13:37] course the designer made them that's why
[1:13:39] they look the way they did but yet

[1:13:44] about sisters & Manges young sisters oh

[1:14:07] glittery things and all a little bit of
[1:14:10] sequins or what if you call that stuff

[1:14:17] you're thinking no way you're not going
[1:14:23] to Walmart looking like that Lindsay so
[1:14:31] listen friends what's been preached
[1:14:34] listen to what the servants of God are
[1:14:36] saying and you're worried about where
[1:14:40] you going listen to what the man of God
[1:14:43] addressing your hair oh my god don't
[1:14:47] tell you where you're going you hear me
[1:14:50] preaching about stole love food and

[1:14:57] tribulation period I getting you ready
[1:15:00] with no bunch of conspiracy theories I'm
[1:15:02] not trying to preach a bunch of black
[1:15:04] helicopters and this and that and the
[1:15:05] other I'm looking for a helicopter I'm
[1:15:08] looking for a theophany I'm not looking
[1:15:14] to dig a hole in the ground I'm looking
[1:15:17] for a hole in the sky so I can fly out
[1:15:20] of this world I'm getting dressed up
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:38] my clothes say where I'm going now y'all
[1:15:44] may not see it but I'm dressed up real
[1:15:47] fit and proper I told Matt this suit
[1:15:51] it's time this white shirt I'm talking
[1:15:54] about my soul the cost of this word
[1:15:58] that's been produced from the spun mills
[1:16:01] of the divine word given down through a
[1:16:03] prophet of God to be able to handle down
[1:16:05] and lay down on these tapes for years
[1:16:08] and years and years and the servants of
[1:16:10] God still going back and gleaning
[1:16:12] sometimes I wonder how long a word
[1:16:14] brother Branham ever kept all this stuff
[1:16:16] sometimes but Amos I look out them my
[1:16:18] goodness and wonder that man didn't blow
[1:16:20] to smithereens with all these
[1:16:22] revelations and all this word that God
[1:16:24] gave him and you've got preachers around
[1:16:27] the world still feeding on what he
[1:16:29] preached the Millennium there but if
[1:16:31] it's a thousand years from now preachers
[1:16:33] will still be preaching this message
[1:16:34] they'll still be digging things out of
[1:16:36] there and it'll be absolutely astounding
[1:16:39] why because God has provided such a
[1:16:43] wardrobe of the world and the weaving of
[1:16:46] the pattern the call is so divine by his
[1:16:49] own attributes that he can look at her
[1:16:51] and she's done and said I've said right
[1:17:06] here many a time and you've been here
[1:17:07] with me and I walk out that door was
[1:17:11] that nervous groom and the best man he's
[1:17:17] heard about the dress he knows a little
[1:17:20] bit about it I'd always look at the
[1:17:23] groom whenever I say all arrives or keep
[1:17:26] seated whichever I look at him because I
[1:17:30] know this is his first time and seeing
[1:17:33] her like this
[1:17:35] I see the fear the anxiety the
[1:17:41] excitement I said the tears and her
[1:17:44] daddy's eyes as he's walking her down
[1:17:45] the aisle
[1:17:49] and I never see that
[1:17:51] but the Greg that I don't think of the
[1:17:54] Lord Jesus that morning of the rapture
[1:18:02] what it all starts happening you changed
[1:18:07] his his garments it goes in behind those
[1:18:08] curtains as it was laid aside his bloody
[1:18:12] garments as high priest he walks out
[1:18:15] dressed as a rafter and the angels know
[1:18:24] this rapture time about that time those
[1:18:30] it's in the sixth dimension glory to God
[1:18:33] their release from the sixth dimension
[1:18:35] hang with me
[1:18:37] about the same time your theophany which
[1:18:41] you've never seen yet but you heard from
[1:18:43] and at least once
[1:18:47] it's release from beyond the curtain of
[1:18:50] time as well and here you are down on
[1:18:53] the earth you got up Monday morning it's

[1:21:10] about us that makes us not like other
[1:21:12] people that will go to church with all
[1:21:14] of us want to be changed from that now
[1:21:16] we'll go ahead and preach with or
[1:21:17] without trait man say I appreciate it
[1:21:20] but let's just be honest and face facts
[1:21:22] there's folks in this message that human
[1:21:24] it we just don't like being around them
[1:21:25] because they cost not that we're not
[1:21:28] brothers and sisters now but there's
[1:21:30] Christ in our human make up in our human
[1:21:32] nature there why does he say that I
[1:21:34] don't understand what he means
[1:21:35] you know why'd she say that why should
[1:21:37] she come across out there look friend
[1:21:38] that has to be changed about us
[1:21:40] if not we'll find ourselves off a little
[1:21:44] corners over in heaven and you'll find
[1:21:46] three or four over here and three or
[1:21:47] four nine four or five over that note
[1:21:49] that won't be none of that because all
[1:21:51] of the things in our humanity that make
[1:21:54] us Christ will all be gone and listen
[1:21:57] every one of us need to be changed from
[1:22:00] the preacher on down that's right
[1:22:02] because there is no perfect human makeup
[1:22:05] and yet God took all of this ma the mess
[1:22:09] that we were here and we were in the
[1:22:11] rags of sin and we were in the rags of
[1:22:14] Satan we look like a prostitute or we
[1:22:17] look like an ill-fame warmer but God
[1:22:19] said I know what I can do for her
[1:22:22] I know what I can do I can change her I
[1:22:24] can call her by her name by her real
[1:22:27] name and she'll respond from the soul I
[1:22:30] will bear sir by my word I will close
[1:22:33] her in my beauty and when I do she will
[1:22:36] take my breath away can I have a few
[1:22:47] more minutes how's their chapter 4 verse
[1:22:53] 2 in that day shall the branch of the
[1:23:01] Lord be beautiful and glorious and the
[1:23:07] fruit of the earth shall be excellent
[1:23:09] and comely for them that are escaped of
[1:23:13] Israel I said 50 to 1 awake awake
[1:23:17] put on thy strength old Sian put on thy
[1:23:25] old Jerusalem the holy city from his
[1:23:28] father shall be no more coming to thee
[1:23:30] the uncircumcised and the unclean
[1:23:32] I said 61 3 to appoint unto them that
[1:23:36] mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty I
[1:23:46] see in our Western thinking this makes
[1:23:49] no sense
[1:23:50] beauty for ashes ashes what but this was
[1:23:54] a custom for many thousands of years and
[1:23:56] still is among many of the Easterners
[1:23:58] that when a tragedy would come or the
[1:24:01] death of a loved one they would cast
[1:24:04] ashes on their heads our ashes on their
[1:24:09] face they would throw the ashes up and
[1:24:11] cover themselves in ashes so this is the
[1:24:16] way he found us in our calamity in our
[1:24:19] fears ashes was all over our face ashes
[1:24:24] all over our soul licks with our human
[1:24:27] sorrow as we had cried
[1:24:29] lamented and cry and the tears in the
[1:24:32] action I'll mix together yet ah nice
[1:24:35] mascara you look like a mess but God
[1:24:43] said this is what I want today I'm going
[1:24:45] to give you the washing of the water but
[1:24:48] the words now want you to take the water
[1:24:51] of the word and I want you to start
[1:24:53] washing your face let's start appear
[1:24:57] with your eyes first and let's go to get
[1:25:00] all this stuff off of your eyes and all
[1:25:02] for your face because you're gonna see
[1:25:04] me I don't want you to now if you look
[1:25:06] out there you still got ash water and
[1:25:08] stuff in there you may look and think
[1:25:09] there's three of me but if you keep on
[1:25:11] washing long enough you realize there's
[1:25:13] only one that's why a lot of folks still
[1:25:18] think there's two or three they still
[1:25:20] got ash water in the lives but better if
[1:25:23] you'll watch good enough you'll find out
[1:25:26] he ends the everlasting father so he
[1:25:35] said let me have your ashes let me have

[1:34:31] somebody you go to college with somebody
[1:34:34] goes school is a mother or father
[1:34:36] whoever and you're Jesus comes with the
[1:34:39] reproach of the word I understand the
[1:34:42] way they modernized Jesus Jesus wouldn't
[1:34:46] even know himself
[1:34:49] could say you preach her saying tell
[1:34:51] Matt me you preach it a Jesus of your
[1:34:54] own making you understand what the
[1:34:57] majority of later sins would do for
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ to appear himself to them
[1:35:00] in his form of his word they would be
[1:35:03] ashamed of him that's why they're
[1:35:05] ashamed of us they would be so ashamed
[1:35:09] of him hey they would not want him in
[1:35:11] their church
[1:35:12] if Jesus made anybody shout or healed
[1:35:14] anybody or cast out of devil out of
[1:35:16] somebody that would so embarrass them
[1:35:22] may God help me my name is broadcast on
[1:35:29] public television or radio or newspapers
[1:35:32] I'm misunderstood the message people or
[1:35:35] whatever more when the train pulls in
[1:35:38] and Jesus the word is standing there man
[1:35:42] god help me
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:53] you see he knows how that feels
[1:35:57] brother branham quotes the consequence
[1:35:59] from the Lord Jesus and he spoke there
[1:36:02] his word about the woman about the girl
[1:36:03] rather said that she's sleeping and they
[1:36:06] laughed him to scorn and he said that
[1:36:09] word meant embarrassed so Jesus felt
[1:36:13] embarrassing imagine he says you my me a
[1:36:16] little bit darker skin than us but still
[1:36:18] by the Jimmy's his cheeks flushed and he
[1:36:22] felt embarrassed if he didn't he
[1:36:26] couldn't understand you when you feel
[1:36:28] embarrassed many of y'all ever been
[1:36:31] embarrassed about certain things of the
[1:36:32] word I'll raise my hand or a threat to

[1:36:42] what does that the human part yeah we've
[1:36:47] all got that little girl in the
[1:36:50] here yes the reproach for the word the
[1:36:54] scars for the word the pain for the word

[1:43:16] Heavenly Father for taking away our
[1:43:18] ashen face Lord I never was in the
[1:43:25] depths of sin as many as these folks
[1:43:27] were they could express more about the
[1:43:31] loneliness than years and years of that
[1:43:35] than I could but I've talked to enough
[1:43:37] to know getting up every day looking for
[1:43:42] some peace some satisfaction if suicide
[1:43:48] was only among the poor then we could
[1:43:51] say well it's social it's because they
[1:43:55] don't have money to pay their bills and
[1:43:57] money to indulge but yet we know movie
[1:44:00] stars the famous the rich the important
[1:44:05] people that supposedly have everything
[1:44:08] they take their lives Lord Jesus because
[1:44:14] they're longing for peace they go to bed
[1:44:18] with some medicine they get up at meds
[1:44:20] they have to take all kinds of things
[1:44:24] they've still got ashes all over them
[1:44:27] but thank you Lord Jesus when we pulled
[1:44:32] up on your lot that day wherever it was
[1:44:35] you offer this this unbelievable deal

[2:01:50] Thank You Lord Jesus ah I got a text
[2:01:54] here just a few weeks ago after I was
[2:01:56] preaching on value and money and I dealt
[2:02:01] a little bit if you'll remember on car
[2:02:02] salesman and all that there's a brother
[2:02:05] in the message which is that car
[2:02:06] salesman and he'd strained that service
[2:02:08] last night he was several states away
[2:02:09] from that nor that not rather he said I
[2:02:12] always knew there'd be a pretty sure
[2:02:13] that would help us support car salesman
[2:02:18] because car salesmen can tend to have
[2:02:21] kind of a bad reputation you know they
[2:02:27] want to sell you theirs at retail and
[2:02:29] get yours at wholesale so that make
[2:02:33] money both ways my family was in car
[2:02:36] business so I understand a little bit
[2:02:37] about how it works but Jesus wants to
[2:02:42] trade with you and he'll give you above
[2:02:46] and beyond retail value for yours
[2:02:48] and Mark done what he's going to trade
[2:02:51] for you way below will hotel and this is
[2:02:55] not one of them five dollar over the
[2:02:57] invoice things that you see around here
[2:02:59] ten dollars over invoice we promise we
[2:03:01] promise $10 over invoicing if they come
[2:03:04] on I'm not born in the morning but not
[2:03:06] yesterday morning but jesus said honest
[2:03:12] I'll give you what I want to give you
