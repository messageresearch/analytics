fought through miles and miles of Philistines to get get him a drink of water you realize they fought to get what they were going to bring him it wasn't that they fought to get to him they fought to get to the praise that they were bringing back to him you might have to fight to get praise tonight but I promise if you break through and you give God praise God has to it's his duty to give back to

from this church amen we love you amen we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you and we appreciate admire the ministry here so our only agenda tonight is to be a help if the Lord will make a way amen we just want to help the young people so we got a couple scripture reading here I don't want to keep you standing all night we'll just go to Romans chapter 10 amen and the word says but what saith it the word is n the even in th excuse me Romans 10 chapter uh chapter 10: 8 we'll read down to verse 11 what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou th shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen if you turn with me to James chapter 3 we'll just take our text here as well and we'll have you seated after prayer James 3: 2 down to 10 and this is James sermon on the power of the tongue he would say here for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man isn't that amazing and able also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horse's mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body now watch the analogies of the scripture here now also behold the ships which though they be so great and they are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small Helm amen withs soever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of Hell James is real he's one of those kind of pastors for every kind of beasts and birds and serpents and things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind amen but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil it's full of deadly poison therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing and my brethren these things ought not to be amen these things ought not to be you believe in the Law of Confession amen let's have a word of prayer before we're seated heavenly father I just thank you Lord uh for this opportunity to speak to your young people father I'm so excited Lord to see what's happening in our midst Lord in this new generation father we have we have High Hopes Lord we have great aspirations even great Ambitions Lord to to see Victory and Revival Lord and maturity and overcoming power Lord manifested in this Young Generation I pray tonight Lord that you would just see fit to take over lord uh this vessel Lord as we've sung the song I Give Myself Away these young people Lord give themselves to you tonight and we commit this service to you and we ask that You' come on the scene Quicken The Word of Life Lord to every need and every situation in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you as you're seated now I know how it is as young people when we come to gather together you know and maybe you're sitting beside somebody that you don't know or uh not now thanks but uh and so you know maybe you got a little bit little that tightness or you know uh we got to break through some things to just get into the swing of the ministry this weekend why don't you do this turn to somebody next to you give them a big smile shake them by the hand amen we're here to have a we're have we're here to have a youth weekend amen and and uh I think we should just uh we should just enjoy it amen I I'm looking out at so many familiar faces I just feel that I'm among friends is that right I feel that I'm among friends and I know that you love me and I I certainly love you and I I hope that you know that and so and so uh I just want to be myself and let's just settle into this thought and and ask the Lord to come on the scene will you help me preach tonight amen will you will you will you pull amen amen if you'll pull I'll preach amen we'll just believe the Lord will come on the scene so I'd like to preach a sermon tonight I'd like to title it changing the narrative changing the narrative amen and of course it's just a sermon on the Law of Confession amen which is a law of God's word amen it's a law that's in effect for every Christian amen is that you you find that everything that we receive from God is going to come to us in our Christian Journey Through The Law of Confession and the way that that works it works in several steps the first thing that happens is uh is faith comes by hearing amen and so uh the way that the way that we receive things from God is uh we can't receive anything unless a preacher comes amen or a messenger and and brings a revelation and then God's word is spoken to you and you hear it now when you hear it uh it's not just good enough just to sit in a church and and hear the word preach but then that faith when it comes into you amen has got to be mixed with fa that word has got to be mixed with faith amen amen that's the next step is when you hear the word amen and then it's mixed it with faith in your heart and and you believe in your heart now if you believe it in your heart you're going to confess it with your mouth because whatever the mouth is speaking amen it's revealing what's going on in the heart amen and so the process isn't complete until you've heard the word and it's been Mi mixed with faith amen and then when you speak it brother brandom said God comes on the scene and he'll be the high priest of your confession amen the high priest of your confession you say well uh why is it that I seem that I I'm am not receiving the blessings of the Lord amen it's cuz you're missing your part amen you have got to make a confession amen then your high priest will come on the scene and he'll intercede and and he'll Quicken the faith that's in you to bring something to pass amen but that's God's law that's that's the way that God made it and uh you know in a in a certain way of looking at it uh uh as brother Braham is teaching on this Law of Confession we find that we have an all powerful God but he even limits himself to your confession he limits his power to what you will confess what you will believe what you will profess with your mouth are you with me tonight amen you see where I'm going here so we read in the Book of James amen how important this little guy this little guy called the tongue how important that tongue is Amen to you and to your future and to your journey and to your success as a Christian it's all important amen uh what is coming out of your mouth amen is all important to you as Christian there's power especially as a Christian there's power in the words that you say amen and more than just the words that you say but your your confession amen your expression of Faith your expression of what you believe in your heart amen amen and so James will tell us that the tongue he'll use two analogies for the tongue and both of them are a seat of control amen one of them it's just a little bit just a little piece of metal or leather amen that they put into the horse of a mouth uh into the mouth of a horse amen and so and the horse is he might be a great big strong animal amen with great power and great force amen but but with a little bit you can control that horse you can control his Direction amen you you you see it's a seat of control you take a great big ship and that ship it it's carrying a great cargo amen it's heavy it's massive amen it's tossed by the winds and it's tossed by the waves and amen and so there's a lot of great forces involved in the sailing of a ship amen but all of those amen have to come subject Amen to a little thing called a Helm amen which turns the rudder of that ship and it determines the direction of the voyage amen amen see your tongue is the seat of control in your life whatever is coming out of this tongue whatever it's speaking whatever the confession is your life is going to follow it no matter how much power is involved how much strength or how much ability or or or how much religious efforts that you put in amen it's your confession is the law that God works by amen and so it's got a power to it and that power can either be harnessed by God or it can be harnessed by the devil amen the power of the tongue is either going to be harnessed by the Lord or it's going to be harnessed by the devil because it's a seat of control so your Christian life is going to be controlled by whatever power rules your tongue Amen brother brandom said that he cannot do one thing for you until you first believe in your heart that he's done it and then say that he's done it and the minute that you believe it and say it he's there to make intercession upon your confession now watch this now he said now you could come to the altar here and you could scream and cry and walk up and down the floor and scream God saved me a sinner it wouldn't do one Speck of good amen you could do it tonight all night all day tomorrow and the next night and beat on the floor anything that you want to do you're just giving vent to your feeling amen now you you know you've been to Our Youth Camp you know how we feel about altars and emotions and all those things not that guy amen but it's true amen that you can do all those things but you'll never be saved brother brandom said until you first believe it and then confess it amen it's a very simple thing it's very simple it's not complicated but it's a law of God a law of God Amen not just a most of the time it's a law of God Amen that and so you you you got to forgive me I I'm an engineer by trade and so I've got I've got that kind of a brain and I love laws amen I I I love I I love I love uh uh uh things that operate by a law because once you understand the law then you can put it to work amen or or if it fails amen when you understand the law then you understand why it failed isn't that right amen and so amen and this is the law this is the system that God created it's God's way for you to receive the blessings amen now now how many know the devil is not a Creator the devil has never innovated anything in his life all that the devil can do is take what God already created and he and he can twist it and he can pervert it and he can put it to work for Satan's kingdom amen he can't create a new system he can't go outside God God's law all that the devil can do is use the same Law of Confession to get the power that's in your tongue amen and that's where you go wrong that's where the failure comes that's where the Battle Is Lost right there Amen brother B talked about the reason people don't believe in Divine Healing he said because the devil found a weak spot in you and he perverted it but God is the Healer amen God is the Healer and that's why we battle amen that's why we're fighting the prophet would say the greatest battle ever fought and it's not it's not on a battlefield amen it's not out on a plane it's right here in the mind amen because all the time the devil is bombarding you with his lies we're living in a world where there's so many voices so many influences amen there's so much uh amen there's so much preaching in hardly any of his Bible amen but it's but the devil is preaching you a sermon every day amen and he comes to you amen and he's and he's trying to pitch you something he's trying to sell you something he's trying to convince you of something and and cause you in your heart to believe it and if it can just get you to doubt amen the word of God and take what he's got to say Amen then all he needs to do is get you to confess amen the devil's message and that's how he gets the control over the church amen that's how he gets young people into trouble that's how he keeps them from the good things of God Amen is that he harnesses the law of the tongue amen see that's why Satan has the power to bring oppressive Spirits into your life why cuz he's operating by the law that God put into place amen you look at Eve Eve fell how did she fall she fell amen when she doubted one word when she doubted one word amen when when she would take well 99% of the word of God Amen but then Satan comes with a proposition amen and she begins to give ground say well maybe surely not may there's got to be a little wiggle room we got to have a balance oh may you know uh uh maybe maybe he didn't really mean that or maybe you know maybe maybe that's not really what the scripture is saying amen one word amen amen and it gives the devil a foothold Amen to seize power amen the power to control your life was never meant for the devil amen but that power is reserved for your heavenly father amen he put a law in effect amen so that you could receive blessings from him amen but if you surrender that to the devil amen that's where you go wrong that's where it fails amen and see there's nothing wrong with amen and you make you make the decision Amen to to believe Satan's lie and you begin to profess doubt and you make that decision freely freely really you do but you're a free moral agent brother Brown said the inside of your spirit is a soul and that is controlled by one thing your free will now he said you can accept what the devil says or or come on now you can accept what the devil says or you can't accept What God Says and that will determine what spirit is in you if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God it won't feed on anything of the world now now see so there's nothing wrong with God's system it's the way that we're using it or misusing it is that right amen when you understand the system you understand why it failed amen it failed when you chose to leave the word of God and believe Satan's lifee amen and give and give enough credit give enough Faith give enough agreement to what the devil's whispering in your ear that you begin to confess it amen and right there he gains the power now now how many have ever failed yeah it's all of us don't worry amen we fail we we make mistakes we fail as Christians we go through through seasons of failure amen and so so all of us are no we've all had experience of failure we're no stranger to failure but let me tell you something you did not fail for a lack of power it was not a lack of power that caused you to fail and amen there's enough power in you as a child of God brother Bram said you could create another world right now and go live on it amen that's the kind of power that's in you amen but it's controlled by law so it's not a lack of power it's not a lack of teaching amen your message believing children amen you're young people you've been raised in it you've been taught in it you heard preachers like the world has never seen preach this message and teach this message you're you're taught you have the understanding and I want to I want to tell you something just a just to shock you a little bit you didn't fail because of a lack of faith how could you say that brother Nathan it wasn't even a lack of faith it's where in your mind you decide to place your faith watch how the devil works now because he can't create his own system so he has to use what God did amen so what the devil does Amen is he'll come Waring on your mind he's bombarding you all the time with his thoughts and what he's trying to do amen is is he's trying to convince you that your faith is too small you don't have enough power you don't have enough understanding you're not old enough you're not big enough you're not strong enough you're not spiritual enough you're not enough amen and then as soon as you begin to believe that it g it gives him power to control the destiny of your life amen now listen it's not that you don't have faith amen because when the devil preaches his sermon you believe him amen take the same faith that you put in the devil's lies that's all the faith that you need when you put it in the word of God The Law of Confession will make it work in your life he what the devil's trying to do is hijack the faith that you got he's trying to tell you that you're not enough amen and then when you believe him he's jumping right on that power of faith and he's hijacking it and he's using it to mess up your life amen now it's a strange thing brother brandom said that's so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian anybody ever felt that way brother BR said that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you must never say that it's the devil's language when we begin to confess well you know I think I think I think I'm not going to make it I think this trial is too much I think the Temptation is too strong I think God should choose somebody else I just don't think I could do it I just I I I I'm not enough I don't have enough faith I don't have enough strength I I I I can't I can't I can't I can't it's the devil's language amen it's it's not it's not unfamiliar to us we've all heard that sermon and it's the devil that preaches it amen you don't don't put your faith Amen in that false teaching amen put your faith in the word of God it says in Christ all things are possible to you you're more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus amen don't give the devil control oh Oh my he said don't ever say that don't let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved hey let's put it into action amen say it I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all of my heart amen never permit a negative thought to come in your mind and I'm so glad he put this in if you can help it oh come on young people amen am I the only mortal man in the church tonight if you can help it don't even let the thought come in your mind in the first place amen but what if you can't help it what if it just finds you in a weak moment what if it's a discouraging day amen and you're in a bad environment amen then what then brother brandom takes you to an old story about a farmer that you've heard a thousand times amen he said that farmer has got a crop to protect amen he can't stop crows from flying over the farm but he can stop them from building a nest and whether you believe it right now in this moment or not you have the power inside of you to prevent the thoughts of the devil from taking hold in your life you've got the power to do it oh my you can choose God's word hallelujah when it starts brother BR said don't entertain it I can't help the thoughts from coming he said but but you but you can stop him from roosting and God can only bless you he said he can only only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see amen it's so it's whoever you give the power it's whoever you give the Reigns amen that's why Time After Time young people they'll get a an experience with God they have a breakthrough you have a victory amen then and then within a week you're back in a ditch why amen because you went a couple days all of a sudden you slipped up all of a sudden you made a mistake you got in a bad atmosphere whatever it was and right there the devil took the reins and it yanked you back down into the ditch don't give the RSS to the devil don't turn over the power to the tong of the tongue amen it's the power of the tongue amen which not only gives you the victory but it helps you keep the victory it's a confession of Faith amen don't let them yank the rains I I say I say take it back take the rains back take the helm back say Lord you drive this ship amen you the pilot you be the captain Lord whatever happens I will conf I will have a confession of faith I will not have a negative confession it'll be positive all the time on My Darkest Day I'm saved I'm Sanctified amen I I I'm purchased by the blood by a calvary's Grace amen I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God Amen he he carried me in his mind before the foundation of the world and there's no one that can pluck me out of his hand mistake after mistake stumble after stumble amen but nothing can stop me amen cuz I'm a Child of God Amen and the power of God's law is in my mouth the word is NY even in thy mouth see see God has given you a way to take the governance back over your life amen rip the rins away from that devil amen you realize I some of you may not realize this as young people that when the Devil comes and Whispers in your ear right you don't you don't have to argue with the devil you don't have to convince the devil you don't have to waste time going back and forth amen don't waste your time with the devil as soon as you realize it's a devil you resist him how do you resist him shoot that's not that's not a thought of God that's a devil amen that's a lie amen and it can't Roost here amen and you know what we get in a we get in a we get in an arguing match with de with the with the Devil we're always trying to reason everything out and prove you're trying to prove to the devil that you're a Christian amen you're trying to prove to that voice in your ear amen that you finally beond condemnation but that's the voice of the accuser and it is his job to accuse you it is his job to condemn you amen that's what he does Amen but you don't have to listen to him and you've got nothing to prove Christ proved it on Calvary amen he proved it on Resurrection morning amen all you got to do is make the profession of faith amen with the heart man believes with the mouth he's saved amen it's quite simple you know amen just stop trying to convince the devil amen that you're a Christian he already knows but he'll never admit it here's what it is brother Bram said you're a Christian because you believe that you're a Christian that's deeper than you think you're a Christian because you believe that you're a Christian and it's all settled cuz he's a high priest Prest what kind of high priest the high priest of your confession amen now notice he said he's the high priest of your confession what you confess you are that's what you are and any man will never live any farther or any higher than what he believes he's living Amen in other words the only way you'll reach that next step the only way to get to your Victory the only way who wants to come higher in Christ amen how many would like his sword a little higher amen the only way up there is by the law of Faith amen any man will never live any higher he'll never live any further than what he believes he's living and brother Ram said a man if he's a drunk all that he talks about is alcohol that's that you can't get him to shut up you can't get him to talk about anything else amen if he likes smoking if he likes drugs or whatever the man whatever he is amen that's what he talks about that's what's coming out of his mouth all the time that's his confession that's his identity amen amen but the same law for a Christian you're a Christian amen not CU you live a sinless Perfection amen not cuz you never made a mistake you're a Christian cuz you believe you're a Christian and you make a confession of faith and God gives the Holy Ghost to vindicate your profession he's your high priest amen it's Grace it's Amen it's it's Faith it's the Law of Confession you'll never get any higher in Christ than you are right now without a change to your confession hey amen and that's why I want to preach on change in the narrative amen because you find it you find that the narrative is all important in your life because everyone's sitting here if the Lord carries and we go on through time you're going to have good days and you're going to have bad gu bad days if you're a sinner or you're a saint you're going to have good days you're going to have bad days you're going to have victories you're going to have defeats you're going to have trials you're going to have tribulations there will be sicknesses there'll be struggles amen there will be all those kind of things amen and so what's really important amen is not all the things that happen to you but how you choose to interpret them and what filter you draw it through amen see it's the narrative that you put to the things of your life amen I try to figure out how to explain this now I talk about marriage I realize it's a youth meaning amen but we're all married to Christ and amen and and and I'm a married man and there's one thing that helps me in my marriage and that's a revelation by this message that my wife is an eternal mate to me in glory is it not some temporary setup amen this is something Eternal manifested in time amen and so so we came from somewhere and we're going to somewhere and there's a lot of stuff going to happen in the middle but it can't change the overarching truth amen because the narrative is we belong to one another the narrative is amen we're going to Glory together the narrative is amen we're spending etern together you see what I mean amen now in a marriage the worst thing that could happen to you is you stop believing that and you start getting in your mind well I married the wrong one and you know or or maybe she's not for me or maybe maybe we'll never work this out and when that begins to get into you amen because see you're supposed to be married happily ever after amen but see then the problem is you get a never in your ever amen well we're never GNA sort this out we're never GNA come to agree we're never gonna we're never going to learn how to get over we're never gonna we're never going to we're never going to we're never going to amen and when that becomes the narrative over a marriage over a life whatever it is now listen every fight that you have and you're going to have them amen then then then it becomes part of a of a narrative amen that you see the ship sinking it's falling apart we're headed for divorce right and then you could have a real good day and have a real romantic outing you know in a nice day and take a walk in the park or down on the beach amen and it's a it's a great day but the narrative is well that was just a good day but now we're back amen you see you see the narrative how you understand what I'm saying and it's the same in your marriage to Christ amen because you start going along and then the devil whatever he's doing everything he can to convince you you're not a child of God it's not meant to be you were never in his mind amen you don't deserve Grace you send away your day your grace and he's trying to get you to believe that amen cuz if he can get you to swallow that amen then he can put a Nar ative over your life and the truth becomes hey on the days that you do good that's just a good day amen but but see every mistake is saying aha you see you made another mistake amen you stumbled again you fell again amen and so it plays into the narrative that he's trying to put on you and say you're never going to make it amen but if you would accept the word of God as your narrative as your truth Oh Glory then you can have a bad day it's just a bad day but the story of your life is you're an overcomer you're an eternal seed amen you're a predestinated child of God you're going through you're going over you're going to make it it's the narrative amen but all the time you know all the time the devil can put one over on God's children on the road to EMAs there was a couple Believers walking they weren't they weren't Sinners they weren't unbelievers they were message Believers and they're walking and they're just miserable sad just down cast amen and so so caught up in in all the bad things going on they didn't even realize they were in the presence of Jesus Amen and Jesus begins to speak to them amen and he begins to explain them through the scriptures brother Bram said even the preaching of the word wasn't enough Amen to make them wake up because they had already accepted the devil's narrative that it was the worst day ever but it was the best day ever because Jesus wasn't dead and he wasn't in a tomb but there was an empty grave just down down the road and Jesus himself was walking in their presence oh oh friends if you could just if it when it's when we commune with him it's when he comes inside and he breaks the bread to you and reveals to you who you are amen it's not a bad day it's the greatest day that's ever been to be a b message believer these are Happy Days these are Glory Days it's Victory Day I know it's dark out there but we're Children of the light amen we got a different we got a different story we have a different narrative are you following me tonight amen see but s but Christians amen we we'll just accept Satan's truth and they get that's what keeps you in Cycles cycles of condemnation you know one of the greatest things that young people are battling today is condemnation condemnation see how how how the condemnation you know uh uh uh the the problem the the cruel thing about condemnation is you we struggle with a lot as young people amen but you'll struggle with something and it'll trip you up for a time but it's condemnation that keeps you down see it's condemnation plus the problem that's what's so cruel about it amen is that it's condemnation plus now a brother or a sister will have a struggle with lust or you struggle with Temper Temper or you struggle with h with with with some of these things amen then that'll trip you up but then it's condemnation that comes along and puts his foot on your neck he says now why don't you stay there a while and why don't you just grubble in the dirt for a week or a month or a year till you're ready to give up amen and he begins to try to tell you hey hey this ain't going to work out you're never going to have Victory you're just going to be in this cycle forever oh friends amen it but but see it's Satan's narrative and he wants you to accept that but you don't have to accept it amen you see and confess and and condemnation is such a religious devil those are the worst kind actually condemnation knows all all the scriptures condemnation knows the quotes he knows that one quote which just gets you right between the eyes amen and shreds your and and and and and it just tears your life apart and it's sending you to hell and he'll use that he'll just Hammer you with that day in and day out because it's a religious devil amen it's a religious devil it's a preaching Devil he's preaching you a sermon he's saying because of this amen because of this law amen because of this commandment because of this mistake because of this failure amen you have haven't got the goods you're never going to make it you're not going through amen but friends it's not the truth it's just religious but it's not the truth amen now see the thing about a narrative is you can base different narratives on the same facts that's the kind of world that we're living in is that you know uh something will happen and you go you go ask 10 different people around you get 10 different stories and 10 different takeaways or 11 or 12 amen because because you could take the it's not just the the facts of the matter of what happened but it's the a spin amen and everybody's got a spin everybody's got an angle everybody's got something they're trying to twist it and put over on you and get you to believe it amen and the devil is the is the he's the Spin Master of all time that's why I say you don't argue with the devil you realize he you you're trying to reason with him and the Devil comes and he begins to explain to you how lost that you are he explains to you what a mess that you are he explains to you amen uh uhh uh just just how how condemned and how unworthy and how filthy that you are and he could do it in great detail amen and he's got evidence for it amen he can point at what you did this morning he can point at what you did yesterday he points at what you did last week amen and he can explain it and it's reasonable that's why it's called reason if you listen to a little message called wisdom versus Faith Amen brother Brandon will tell you that the devil is the father of reason he's a he he's he's a master of the debate amen he's he better at arguing than you are but you're not put here on Earth to argue with him you're put here to resist him you're put here to reject his lie you're predestinated to accept what he' turned down Hallelujah see the devil he doesn't come to you with fiction does he he comes to you with scripture he comes with you with quotes amen and he'll attack you with those things and he comes with a big long list of your sins he's trying to sell you a a narrative a story this is the story of your life and it's a story of failure it's a story of sin it's a story of unworthiness Amen but friends that's not your story that's not your story it's not the story of your life amen see see condemnation loves the scripture brother brandom Amen brother brandom got in trouble more than anything else for preaching Grace did you know that he was always in trouble for preaching predestination I know why he had to do it amen cuz I had to receive it the revelation of it amen but he was always getting in trouble and one time even his own church got on to him cuz brother Brandman made a statement while preaching that a man could live on this Earth Beyond sin wow and that really shook the legalists and if you go listen to questions and answers at that time there's like three different questions amen where they ask where where people come to brother brand with the same question they said brother brandom you said we got you now cuz you said that a man could live on earth and and a man could live so far into God as to without sin on Earth that was the exact quote amen and and they said but look at the Bible see how the devil works but what about the Bible cuz the Bible says amen if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves that's from the book of First John amen if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us so what are you going to do now brother brandom and they really got on to his case brother Bram said well let's turn there and he says now look across the page look across the page he said in my Bible it's the same page amen and he said look over here he said in 1 John chapter 3 whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin for he is born of God friends if you let the devil run with this scripture he'll give you a thousand reasons why you can't be saved a thousand reasons why you'll never get the Holy Ghost amen but change the narrative oh if you just look across the page that's how you resist the devil the same way Jesus did cuz the devil will come with the scripture and he's trying to use the scripture to send you to Hell amen but Jesus said yes but it's also written it's also written yeah amen the Bible says I was born in sin I was shaped in in iniquity I came into the world speaking lies amen but it's also written you must be born again amen and whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen it's also written it's also written and when you read the word of God through through God's narrative amen then you begin to see grace everywhere that you look amen and the scriptures they used to condemn you amen now they are your Victory amen now they're your Liberty amen they don't scare you anymore oh friends why amen because you got to let God be be The Interpreter of his word and not your adversary amen amen oh friends you look back brother BR said you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that you're defeated you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and then you realize that you've overcome amen why cuz you're not not walking by this by by by this flesh and its weaknesses and its failures but the spirit of God is in you amen amen and it's projecting grace to you it's get there's leadership for you there's overcoming power for you amen there's forgiveness for you amen there's Mercy for you there's love there's care for you amen all these things not by the flesh but by the spirit amen but but how should we believe it except one preach amen don't let the devil be your pre preacher amen you said and as I said it's all reasonable cuz it's reason amen but brother BR said don't reason believe so there's a choice so there is a choice he said no matter what the circumstances don't pay no attention to circumstances believe whose report will you believe amen see there's so many young people and old people and people then you realize there's people amen that that have been in the message been in the church maybe 50 years and walked every step of the journey with a burden of condemnation yeah amen now wouldn't isn't it exhausting come on somebody isn't it exhausting fatiguing overwhelming every day to carry that weight carry that fear carry that guilt of that burden but friends here's the here's the tragic thing about it you don't have to carry it say well how long brother Nathan if I make a mistake if I have a failure if I if I get caught in a trap amen how long do I have to drag my face in the dirt how long do I have to carry the burden how long do I have to atone how long do I have to uh to pay Penance amen for my mistake how long do I have to be depressed how long do I have to be discouraged until I'm paid for it not one moment not one moment past repentance amen do you have to carry sorrow amen Christ carried it to Calvary and he paid the ultimate price that you and I could walk this journey upright without the weight on your shoulder oh friends amen don't carry it one moment further don't carry that condemnation out of this meeting change the narrative look across the page amen accept the grace of God Amen believe the report believe it I can preach it but you got to believe it and say Lord I accept Grace I accept Mercy I accept Freedom Lord I'll lay it down no wonder you can't you can't Carry On The Journey no wonder you're always down in a ditch throwing a pity party you can't stay on the path of Duty because of all that weight amen amen now we believe in conviction for Christians but not condemnation amen conviction amen Paul said I don't have time to teach on it tonight but it's there's sorrow after a Godly sort amen and godly sorrow will make you repent and then repentance amen takes you into a forgiveness not to be repented in other words stop apologizing stop dragging your face in the dirt amen lift up your head and walk forward amen Justified forgiven what a merciful god amen oh my that fatigue of carrying a burden amen see we overcome not just by the blood of the Lamb how many believe the blood of Christ paid the price for everything that we have need of amen amen now you believe that you go to a church that preaches that but many times we fail to overcome why because we overcome not just by the blood of the lamb but by the word amen of brother Donnie's testimony no that's not what it said amen and we thank God for your testimony brother Donnie amen but it's the word of your testimony amen when it comes into contact with the blood of God Amen when those two omnipotence meet amen when an omnipotent God meets omnipotent faith that he planted in the heart of his children amen then great explosive things are going to happen amen and the devil can't resist it anymore cuz all the power the devil has over you is based on a lie and when you reject his lie and give the Reigns back to God Amen then you can't fail to overcome Hallelujah resist the devil it's not what's going into your mouth that's defiling you it's Jesus said it's what's coming out amen it's that rotten confession it's that old tradition it's the narrative amen that you accept don't just say Amen it's not what you're taking in that's killing your Victory it's what you're putting out amen but don't just take what the devil tells you oh amen you've got a right to choose the word you say brother Nathan but my mistakes brother bam said this is one of my favorite quotes amen and truly amen what I'm preaching you tonight the reason that I'm preaching you is because I personally have sat in your shoes as a young person amen and these were the keys to overcoming in my life was to recognize the Law of Confession and every time amen I came into trouble amen I didn't throw in the towel and start over at Square One amen but I would go forth in the grace of God Amen The Law of Confession amen is what will give you power to continue on the journey I'm a witness tonight and here's the key to it brother Bram said in the message Oneness we know we make mistakes that's right but you mustn't look at that you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes cuz you're always going to have them news flash ring the bell you're always going to have mistakes as long as you're in this sinful body amen but stumbling and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again amen oh if he's off the path of Duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of Duty God's obligated to him and then he says these beautiful words knowing he's just a man or a woman you say brother Nathan I'm just a boy I'm just a girl amen I I'm only so much I have so little he knows that he knows that amen so don't look at that don't look at mistakes don't look at stumbling if you ever fall down amen just don't quit get back up amen lay aside every weight of condemnation and stay in the path of Duty and keep pressing on and the power of God is obligated to take you where you're going amen when you begin to take you begin to operate that confession say Amen that was a that was a that was a big hill that was a deep valley that was a hard climb amen that was a difficult struggle that was a battle I fell in a pit amen I I I I was in snared in a trap but I'm not going to quit I'm not going to stop amen the devil will never convince me that I can't make it amen because God said I would make it God gave me the Road mapap God gave me the key he gave me the power he predestinated me to make it and as long as you can carry that positive confession you can overcome you can overcome oh friends God understands your Humanity but thank God he made you a path so get out of your ditch tonight get out of your ditch oh brother brand would talk about brother Wayne's been preaching at home at water from the at that water from the Rock and brother brand speaks about it how God he says oh how God wants to bless his church amen he he said uh but we're so carnal-minded how quick they forgot the Miracles amen when a when a new thing arose can you relate to that oh he said we have a meeting and the power of God will fail will fall and great signs and wonders will take place sounds like a youth camp amen and then Satan comes along and he can smack something over on you and you forget that that's the god of Heaven that was making you shout amen the god of Heaven making you praise the Lord you forget the god of Heaven that snatched you out like a fire brand you forget the god of Heaven who dug you from the pits from the rock where you were dug from he said it's easy to forget him but let me tell you brother what we need tonight is a man with an iron conscience that'll stand there in the power of the Holy Ghost no matter what comes or goes he'll be waving the flag of Victory going on to the the promised land that's what we need in the in the in the church amen is men and women and boys and girls with an iron conscience that no matter how it looks no matter how strong the adversary amen you don't give you don't budge you don't bend amen you say no I'm going through that's what we need we need another Caleb amen Caleb I kind of think that Caleb the way he was he was kind of a man a few words more of a man of action didn't do a lot of talking when he did do the talking basically what he was saying was Moses is Right Joshua's right we can do it that was his message amen that that's what that's where that's where his life was anchored that's what that's the the role that he played Joshua was the great leader Caleb which is your type amen all that he had to do was I agree with Joshua now it was 10 to one amen Joshua's message was very much in the minority but there was one with an iron conscience somebody say no matter how it looks no matter how big the Giants are no matter how hard the fight is going to be amen the prophet said amen we could take the land so I'm with Joshua amen and I'm going in and I'm going to defeat every devil I'm going to possess Every Mountain I'm going to make it through every Valley and I'm going to drink amen the the milk and eat the honey of the land and iron conscience see now see now all these other spies are talking amen I wish I had time to preach on desiners tonight but all these other spies are talking and you know what they were making a lot of sense oh yeah because there was Giants in the land and there were and there were great strong strongholds and fortresses and it was going to be a difficult task and they were making a lot of sense but see God had already sent a prophet Amen to set the narrative for the children of Israel from that time forward amen that no matter who's in your way no matter what you go through amen no no matter now no matter if an achen comes along and a besetting sin and amen and you get into a season of defeat no matter what comes no matter what goes it belongs to you it is your destiny it is your inheritance it belongs to you oh friends amen see Joshua they were making a lot of sense because they're talking about circumstances but Caleb and Joshua weren't looking at circumstances they were looking at a promise and if I could convince you tonight amen to stop looking at your circumstances to stop looking at the evidences to stop letting the devil preach to you amen but look at the promises of God for your life amen and then it would change you like it changed me amen and victory come for you like it did for me but the church is always looking back brother Braham said but let's look up he said because their powers are limited and we have unlimited power amen a few I need a few more minutes stay with me now amen uh for All Things Are possible to them that believe in God brother bam said real genuine faith will punctuate every word of God with an amen amen that's what real genuine Faith does it's just waiting for you to quote the word of God and when you do there's going to be an amen there's going to be an amen I need your amens tonight for a few more minutes amen because amen now now not take the word and say well that was for another generation no he's the same yesterday today and forever amen you see the more that you can employ the power of the tongue amen and invest it in the word of God the more it yields benefits for you that's why I believe in Amen in the word you preach a lot of places and everybody say oh just if you just quiet down stop shouting so much and stop it reminds me of uh brother Daryl and I were were fellowshipping the other day about brother brother Brandon would use the word pen knifing the word pen knifing you know what a pen knife is it's a little pocket knife like a whittling knife and and remember when brother brandom healed the blind girl remember it was a great crowded meeting and he runs into this girl amen and she ends up being healed of her blindness just before he met that girl amen he met a man and a man it was a big strong bird looking guy with his arms crossed and he was sitting there with a with a pen knife whittling on a stick brother brandom's trying to get somewhere amen and the messenger the prophet runs into him amen he bounces off and he looks at the guy and the guy says stop pushing and he sits there pen knifing pen knifing pen knife and that's how a lot of people treat the preaching of the word it's how a lot of people treat the message they treat the word when it comes amen it comes and say well quit quit quit pushing we're having pizza in 15 minutes amen quit pushing yeah yeah that's that's we don't believe in all that emotional stuff quit pre just quit pushing amen and you're always talking about power you're always talking about miracles you're always talking about the baptism the Holy Ghost and all those things I don't I think that's just for the Pentecostalism start pen knifing the word start whittling out the parts that you don't like amen and start amen but friends amen that's not how a child of God responds to the word they came in cuz there was a little girl there and she had a very different response cuz she's crying daddy daddy amen amen and see there's one place where the word the met the Propet he couldn't push through amen the word couldn't get anywhere but to a little girl amen Amen to a a little girl from a house of Oppression with an Affliction of blindness amen amen she said look she said you get me to brother random amen and I'll find my own daddy oh friends amen You Preach me the message I'll find Daddy I'll find well I I I'll recognize where I came from this is my Eagle food amen this is my theophany speaking to me this is my truth this is my narrative amen the message said there would be a great Invincible Army on the face of the Earth at this time and she would have the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and she would do the Greater Works now how could you identify her how do you identify her brother BR said here's how you identify this bride he said in this time the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing you mean I have a voice you mean I have a min history you mean I've got something to say I've got something to do you do and here's your job Caleb amen whatever God saw fit to reveal in this age through the ministry of a prophet you put that in your mouth amen and you give voice Amen to the revelation of the day let it be your narrative Let It Be Your Truth let it be your message let it be your calling amen cuz there's enough power in it to take you home there's enough power in it to get you back to where you came from oh friends that's I'm preaching this from from my reality this message it's my narrative it's my truth amen I I tell you put the message in your mouth it'll work brother Nathan you willing to stake your reputation on that I've Stak my life on it amen my world is built on the message my Ministry is built on the message my marriage is built on the message my home amen my family amen my everything amen amen has come to me down the channel of this word and it's a fire shut up in my bones and I want the world to hear the message oh friends you don't know who you are you're the bride and the bride has the word how many know that the bride has the word amen she's she doesn't have any other narrative she doesn't have any other agenda that's her identity amen uh uh uh uh so so what I would tell you amen what I would prach you with all of my heart amen what my cause my passion amen is that you would reject amen every influence every voice every pundit every philosopher every thought leader every politician every denominational Creed every preacher amen every voice amen every every every voice amen because the bride has the word she has only the word and that's why she knows what to do with the word amen she's not under any other influence Amen Let the message be your narrative this message now young people if I could just say this boldly what this message needs is not another Prophet the message doesn't need another Prophet what this message needs is lived voices that's a direct quote what we need in Johnson City what we need in bluon Ohio what we need all over this world is voices amen somebody not to come up with their own Theory amen but to take the revelation of the day and put it in their mouth and give voice to the message that has come oh friends amen cut off every other voice God didn't send a message just to put it on books and put it on tapes amen but put it in your heart and then put it in your mouth and put it to work and put it into action hallelujah amen amen I wonder if you'd make a commitment with me tonight as a young person Amen to say Amen this voice belongs to the message this voice belongs to the message Amen brother man said why isn't the church on fire why isn't the place packed out with people why aren't there great signs and wonders done don't lay it on the pastor he said it's you because we've got a mixed multitude one's pulling this way one's pulling that way why cuz everybody's listening to different voices amen and so somebody's got this idea somebody wants to put that spin on it sure it's 99% message it's 99% word but it's the 1% that gets us into trouble amen because this one's pulling that way and that one's pulling that way and before you know it it's just a you end up with splintered up churches and broken families and broken hearts and broken pieces amen because everybody's pulling different ways amen but don't lay that just on the ministry young people brother bam said it's you what you got to come to a time of decision and find out what are you going to do God has put the responsibility upon you he said God's word said we can have a Revival God's word said that he would raise up in the last days and send signs and wonders and he's done it the thing that we've got to do is get together and start the Revival amen this mess has been going on 60 years and it's still a mixed multitude and there's still people pulling every which direction young people amen but if I amen if I could start with a new generation and I could just get you not to take my idea not to take my thought about it not to accept my spin but take the word of God take the message of the hour and give voice to it then we would see Revival we would see Power we would see a church on fire we would see signs and one ERS amen yeah everything everybody's got something to say but what are you going to say what's going to be your truth what's going to be your narrative amen but if you'll give voice to this de to this message you might be you might be small you might feel weak but if you just give voice Just Surrender and dedicate your voice to the word of God for this day friends and you know what that voice will become it might be the weakest little squeaky voice like mine tonight amen but but see when the word of of God Amen takes the reign of that voice it becomes a thunder it becomes a thunder brother Ram said those lived voices are the Thunder that shakes the devil amen amen and we're seeing it friends amen cuz God wouldn't let this message fall into a bunch of denominational death amen but he's raised up a Young Generation a Young Generation who have it in their heart to start again with the message amen and keep it pure and give it voice amen and when I when I hear amen when I when I when we have youth camps and youth meetings and we have a mighty move of God amongst this Young Generation like my generation never saw amen Then I then it it gets so something begins to burn in my heart amen I begin to hear something amen the world might not hear it but I hear it it's the Thunder that shakes the devil it's a thunder that Stakes shakes the devil amen friends if you'll just if you'll just give voice to the word of God then whenever you come into a storm amen whenever the Lightning's flashing and The Thunder Rolls you know what you do put the word in your mouth and thunder back amen Thunder back how many will do it amen say now God I'm going to take your word and when the devil when the voice of condemnation is thundering over the Satan's Pulpit at me I'll Thunder back with the promises of God with the grace of God Amen I hear Harold tremble I hear Harold tremble amen when live voices begin to thunder out it shakes the devil scares him it causes hell to tremble because the only Power hell has over you is the power you give it friends why is it why is it we see message churches amen so formal all over the place lukewarm powerless listen to the message it doesn't look anything like what we see on many of the people many of the Ministries many of the places amen have cooled off and accepted a more comfortable modern legalistic whatever kind of narrative friends formal why why is there arguing why is there disagreement why why are people looking for Revival if if the the message I I'll tell you the message is promising Revival so why are so many people failing to see it formalism but formal is not what you think it is you know most time when brother br's preaching on formalism he's preaching on Pentecostals and there's a lot of churches where they whoop and holler and shout and and and that's but look formal is nor normal formal is normal you say brother Nathan do you believe in in shouting and Liberty and all those kind of things yeah that's normal at my church that's normal here amen I believe amen but see normal is formal amen because you can go to some church where they shout you can go to a church where they don't shout you can go to a church where they teach this you can go to a church where they teach that but when that's just normal amen when that's just normal when that's just coasting along under nice Church identity you got a good pastor I got a good pastor amen you're raised in the message I'm raised in the message normal normal normal amen that's formal amen I'm not looking for normal and my greatest prayer is that this generation amen would not be guilty of normal Christianity I'm not looking for normal church I'm not looking for normal worship I'm not looking for normal singing I'm Not Looking for normal preaching cuz I've heard a narrative I've heard a message and it promised me greater things I'm not going to fall into some formal Spirit friends amen forget normal it's time to change the narrative there's people saying all over the place amen that the world's too dark or young people will never make it we'll never have overcoming Christians the message will just fizzle out amen you could try to preach youth meetings but they're always so tight nobody can break through there's no poll I'll tell you what we're doing we're changing the narrative how many want to change the narrative well I can't do it by myself amen but how many amen will say wherever I am whatever I'm doing wherever I go I'm going to take the message and that's going to be my normal and I'm not going to settle I'm not going to stop I'm not going to slow down or get comfortable until I see the blessings which are promise for me in this day reject normal reject formal I got a vision in my heart young people amen generation after generation have taken this message and picked it apart and Whitted out the parts they didn't like amen and and try to get everybody get under my teaching everybody get under that teaching everybody believe this Doctrine whatever it is amen but we're a new generation friends amen it's been tried it didn't work legalism was tried it didn't work formalism was tried it didn't work amen all every spin we've just about tapped out there's just about amen there's a million ways you can go with it and they've tried a million in one amen but what would happen if somebody would just believe the message of the hour what would happen if somebody would take the word of God and quit cutting it to Pieces I'll tell you what you'll see you'll see generation you'll see a generational Revival I've had mine and my generation had it with me yeah those that were elect it's your turn Amen to reject normal to reject formal yeah and change the narrative friends ah don't let me ever be guilty of normal Christianity let me let me friends do you just want to be a normal Sunday go a meeting Christian or do you want to see the realities of Christ if you want something more I got a message for you I got a message for you amen it's not normal but we're not looking for normal right it's not popular you let this message start producing Revival in your life watch the firefighters come running throw a wet blanket on you they did it to me but it was the real thing yeah so they could never snuff it out couldn't pour enough water on it amen you couldn't you couldn't the devil see couldn't throw enough doubt and Theology and history and T and old stories and old fights the Devil Couldn't pile up high enough to to stop me from believing that the message is true and it applies to my life and I can be the kind of Christian amen that the prophet said I would be in this day and that's what he said about you you believe it amen will you accept it let's stand to our feet tonight let's stand to our feet the church won't go any higher without a change in confession as soon as you stop and say well this is normal this is good this is about far enough amen then you die right there oh friends but there's unlimited power in this word for your day that's unlimited brother BR said unlimited Revival is available to you amen this is not a theory to me this is my reality amen I received my Revival I wasn't in a church it didn't happen to me in 10,000 other people in angelist Temple or some mega church or some great meeting I was in a living room at a house party the day after a youth camp and I was just talking to my friends about the message and we were fellowshipping with one another about how something down in my heart is saying that if all these great things are promised and spoken about the Bride of Jesus Christ then I want to be that I don't want to settle for less I don't want to be a normal message believer I don't want normality formality I want reality and that desire brought a sweep of God down into a living room amen and and and and everybody was there had a story amen we saw miraculous instant healings we saw deliverances we saw all those things that's where God really set me on a path to be a preacher me and six other brothers amen and so I know that this word this message can produce Revival it can it can I know that that acts 238 sir Pentecostal experience is available because I've received it amen and now what I want to preach to you amen is that it's available to you sir that's right that available to you don't settle amen don't settle for less God bless you tonight let's bow our heads Lord we don't want to be formal we don't want to be normal normal is the enemy of progress normal's the enemy of Deliverance normal's been the enemy of many a victory God you sent us a message in this day what a message it was what great signs and wonders Lord were performed by The Prophet's hand but God that message spoke of a bride Lord who would be here and she would be alive and she would remain to the coming of the Lord and Lord we've seen Generations rise Generations fall Lord we've seen many an old fighter end up in the ditch Lord murmuring and complaining there's been a lot of water under the bridge there's been a lot of old history but I'm standing here tonight before a new generation Lord and with all the passion of my heart I'm asking Lord that the Holy Ghost would come amongst us now and Quicken a revelation in every heart Lord Lord those Lord that are full of the Holy Ghost under the sound of my voice Lord let them realize the potential that's in them Father that they would strive Lord to rise up higher than the place that they're in Lord those that are not yet quickened Lord I pray Lord that you would awaken a thirst in those hearts Lord that they would they would just recognize Lord what could be father the devil has sold them a normality sold them a narrative Lord that religion Lord can only ever be so much that that believe in the message can only ever produce so much but Lord if we could just see it right Lord there's unlimited power unlimited potential unlimited Revival Lord the skies are full of it father if we could just tap into it I pray Lord that you Lord would see these young people Lord Lord and maybe as they would lift hands tonight in a commitment to you Lord come what may whatever happens Lord whatever takes place Lord I will not give the Reigns over to the devil but Lord I will put you in control of this tongue Lord I will make this word my daily meditation Lord it will it will it will announce my comings and my goings Lord it will go before me because I'll put it in my mouth and I will accept The Narrative of the word and reject The Narrative of the devil bless each one I pray Lord and father give them let this let this simple law this simple teaching bring victory in every life I pray take these mixed up words Lord and put the pieces together in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah brother if you have a song Amen God bless you BL you thank you for your

remember a quote where brother Bram is talking about God creating the universe and he's talking about how how many hundreds of millions of light years to the end of the solar system and then he said so many million light years on the other side of that further on how God created that with one breath one word and he said that same power yes when God said let there be is in you so when you come in here with that power and you sit down beside somebody with that same power and somebody walks in with the same power and sits beside you and so on and you feel this place with that power it does the exact same thing that it did when God said let there be it creates and so often we we can't push through you know brother brandham I always love to hear brother brandham said that I died with him I was buried with him and I rose with him the same power that brought Christ out of the Grave lives in you and I always like to think that whenever he kicked the doors of Halen I was with him so you don't no longer have to go try to kick the doors of Halen that's already done you just have to remind him the power you know if you realize when he was talking about the law of the power and it's a revelation when you get a revelation of that things in your life will change the power that you have over the enemy will change you don't have to go home and and sit down on your bed and write in your diary how depressed you were that day you don't you you don't have to no longer that day you can not never again pick up that besetting sin that has bothered you for years when you get a revelation of the power that's in you it's God living in us it's God I I love that so much that's you know hey let God change the narrative in your life let God change your let the the author that wrote The Narrative for your life that's right let the narrator read it back to you I'm so thankful for that so we're going to we appreciate that so much I I don't know I wish he'd have kept on going but we're
