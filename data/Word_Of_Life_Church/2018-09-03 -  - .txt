TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can be seated for a couple minutes before we read the scripture sometimes laughing listen to for just just a few minutes before we fully read the scripture a few weeks ago I was in a vision and I was standing up on a high place and I was to see the preview of the church and I notice coming from a standing more like this way facing the West and coming this way was the lovely bunch of women real nice risk long hair six nights in the back please Birchtown neatly and they were all in a marching tune like onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before and as they passed by a student there was something there huh some spirit with God it said there is the bride and I look like my heart was happy and she went around this way and passed around behind me after a while when she come back this way and said now the modern church will come into preview and here come the Asian church up honors thesis a filthy Bunch here come the other churches up all the different they look horrible and I'll say this because I'm duty bound to tell the truth before God and when he said here comes the Church of America now to be previews if I ever seen a bunch of Devils it was that then women were stripped naked with an old great-looking thing like a color of an elephant time and there's whole in front of us with the whole upper part on it and they were doing this kind of stuff that these these dances these kids do out here that the twist and stuff and that kind of music going on I want our scene miss us a thumb up I almost fainted now this is Duff saith the Lord you believe me to be his servant you believe me now I would say that for nothing in the world there's not enough money in all the world to get me to say that if it wasn't true and when she come by that was a filthy looking thing I ever seen I thought God is artists preachers and we've brother have labor to get you a bride and that's the best we could do she was twisting holding this in front of her like only truelist skirts on the thing holding it in front of her parts or part like this facing and twisting like these kids do out here on the on these vulgar shows that they have twisting that was miss Christianity I love America so help me by the help of God that's what it looks like in his face I just I saw I could've faded I go to all the trying and the preaching ended for sweet and firm one of us bought there and they were twisting and carrying on holding this in front they come around work I was standing there with this supernatural being I couldn't see my hearing talking to these right around me but when they threw this we did a whole dismiss twisting and laughing and going on hearing all I got holding this in front of them not me standing in his presence there and it is Sherman sort of all on Charlie that's the best I could do I love God what good did it do me I'm gonna to do all the crying and begging and persuading it the great signs and wonders and miracles that she showed I stood there go home and cry after preaching to him and thanks and what good did it do me and then I have to present something like that for you for a bride and I was just stood there looking she passed on by and you can imagine the back part of her was nothing on holiness in front of her as she went shimming by like that for this twist throwing her leaves not like that in her or it was bunker how she was hanging on her body shaking around like that I you say what does it mean brethren I don't know I'm just telling you what I see and when she passed by like that I looked at her oh I just got real clean I just turned around I thought God I'm condemned there's there's no need to be trying anything I just might as well quit miss Cara Williams if you're sitting on that dream that she told me about a while ago that you had the other night that's been bothering you there it is the starting when he was taken from the hand then I just thought I just might as well forget it I was gone and all of them one I heard it coming again and coming up on this side come the same bride they went around this way here come them little ladies again and each one of us best in their National Guard from where they come from like Switzerland Germany and so forth each one wearing that kind of guard all along hair just exactly like the one of the first in Germany was coming walking you home marching as to war and when they found the previous that where we were standing just all at once ever I went that way and then they turn back home they went marching and just as they started to going right up into the sky this other one went up to a brief of a hill and went like that Lee started marching right up into the sky and when they went to marching I noticed a couple of little girls in the back look like they might be of some farm girl like sweeping their switch leather somewhere they started to look around I got I said don't don't get out of step it is a scream I guess I come to in the vision center of my hand out like that I thought well that's the reason I said what I have I'm not sure what that means to you I'm not sure what that'll mean to the people who strain the service I hear it but to me it means so much the title of that sermon is choosing of a bride preachers April the 29th 1965 if you listen just a few more minutes from 7:00 to 9:00 then it's on over to about 89 or 90 then you'll feel it move into another channel if your church is not lined up with the word and you said you'd better get out of that church and get into Christ before you don't know at what hour this city will be laid in the bottom of that ocean out there she's honeycombed under right now how long it'll hold the wrath of God over that sandbar only God knows although Capernaum our city called by the Angels and this is word that the judgment of God pronounces on Los Angeles how fitting let's read together first Timothy chapter 2 verse 9 and like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearl sir costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works and one call your attention again to the first part of this quote that we began with a while ago a few weeks ago I was in Division I was standing up on a high place I was to see the preview of the church now notice coming of a sending more like this facing the West and coming this way was this lovely bunch of women real nice dress long hair fix nice in the back sleeves and skirts down neatly they were all in a marching tune like onward Christian soldiers marching as to war what what nation what empire what ruler would dress their soldiers like this neat skirts long hair sleeves decent who in the right mind would ever send anybody out dress up this unless of course they were combating Jezebel spirits [Music] praise the Lord let's bow our heads together father we love you tonight we ask your blessings on the service Lord now you speak to us dear God from your word how we appreciate your truth father help us I pray Lord that we can be the kind of people that will match this vision currently dear God in Jesus name the Saint said god bless you may be seated I want to use for a thought tonight marching as to war now you might wonder what in the world would modesty and sobriety and shamefacedness and all of that have anything to do with the war but it truly it would depend upon the setting of the war this would not be something that the United States Army would certainly send out our soldiers in it's not only saying that Russia would choose it's not anything that most of the nations of the world would choose but this is something that heaven chose and we realized that this day that we're living that most people think that there are no religious ceremonial symbols as Christians that we are to keep basically Christianity is based upon one simple thing - the way that the majority of Christendom would look at it and that is on the basis of what you accept it's not what you do it's not the way you live it's not the way you talk it's not the way you dress but it's what you accept so you accept Christ and Christ does everything else for you he does you're living right for you he does everything for you so it's not really based upon you and how do and your faithfulness or your desire to live for God but it's what you accept and then if you accept Christ then basically you don't have to do anything else but of course that's a lie [Music] the New Testament is filled with all kinds of things that we as Christians have to do and if we love and we will do it now let's read if you would in Matthew chapter 26 verse 26 notice the Lord Jesus now ceremonial symbols can reflect great stories great things that contain in them it may look like a natural observance it may look like something that a person is doing and then you try to interconnect what it would mean spiritually and the untrained carnal mind would look at it and never quite make the link but yet it's the way that God chooses to do things now they're setting at the table now the the supper table and as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body now is this literal answer me is this literal is this bread literally his body how come he didn't explain it now what's this Jesus giving them a ceremonial symbol which we keep to this day but when we walk up here and take that little piece of bread and that little bit of wine are we literally eating the body of Jesus no I stood several years ago killing our brother George Smith down in Mexico City and a massive massive Catholic Church and watch that priest stand up there by his prayer and supposedly through the power of James situation however they say that bigger word change that bread and wine into what then poor people thought was the literal body of Jesus Christ but yet we know that it is not the literal body but we take it with reverence as if though it were right so it is a ceremonial symbol which to us is more than just a symbol so let me and say holy is it holy we reverence it we look forward to it only to the time and we can take it but yet are we literally taking the body of Jesus no we're not are we literally drinking his blood when we drink the wine we are not but yet the Lord Jesus set it forth as a ceremonial symbol which is carried out naturally but has a spiritual significance that keep this in mind now with what we just heard about the vision now remember a preview is something that is going to be shown so by the man was standing here there is a supernatural being standing by him and he's going to see sings in the form of a symbol so when he turns what does he see sees a bride coming through it is a multiracial bride multicultural bride so he sees them and they're looking different and dressed a little bit different but they all were dressed modestly even though they might have been from different parts of the world but they all had one air about them and that was modesty shamefacedness and sobriety there was not one of them with cut hair not one of them with pants or a miniskirt or whatever voice I don't believe that i don't really care nothing about talking to you then i'm talking to believers tonight now i realize we've had some lot i'ts that have been streaming these services on winds then they took a real interest in it I'm glad maybe someone would get saved you keep hoping there will anyway so I realize they probably won't enjoy this tonight but I figure the Abraham i'ts will LA tights and sodomites now they won't care for too well now whenever brother branham sees this sin he actually sees several symbols in the vision so the army of God is represented not as preachers in this vision the symbol is represented he don't see apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers he doesn't see men deacons he doesn't see men trustees he doesn't see man passes men advances but God chooses to represent the bride in the feminist form so here's the whole army of God represented in the form of women God and what are they doing they are marching they are marching they are so antenna what you notice they are so in tune in this vision now the first group if you notice when he sees them they go marching out not marching up but the last group of the bride was so in tune the music never even changed when they changed they were so in harmony was the word that they was walking living a godly life a holy life and all of a sudden the step so two getting higher and higher and higher and higher the music never changed to a heavenly chord but they was walking there every day godly holy lives and they walked right out of this world oh man that's the kind of person I'm gonna be by God's grace now once it's so in this you'll find that that this vision is very very scriptural it follows exactly the types of God now what's in verse 27 Jesus he took the cup and gave thanks gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood is it you arguing with it it is but in ain't and remember it is but it a it is symbolically so in a ceremonial symbol it is the blood all about you every time I press that little cup to my lips brother it's a sacred time to me when I take that little piece of bread it's a sacred time I watch kill make it sometimes I smell it but the JD gets the wine I know all of that but somehow when we come into his presence and what it represents and you know it's so sad for him that people do not understand that hair and clothes and the way you do in the way you live it's also in the same way Oh God looks on the heart I know he does but there are things that God wants the heart to be obedient to so God looks on the heart says that Mima don't get taken in Ian now watch how Paul picks this set for first Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you now but like for you to show me where Jesus said that this do in remembrance of me I would also like for you to show me where Jesus said that testing one two three so you mean to tell me that Paul rephrased added to reshaped what Jesus had to say well I guess I'm out so close now y'all didn't notice in verse 25 I feel the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it jesus never says that Jesus never says this oft as you drink it well sure you can go home and check now unless you're not brother David he's got his right there you can check me around now sure check it out sure you Luddites check me out and when you're done done check and you'll find its soul why is this man not saying word for word what the Lord Jesus said so I guess we should trash the Bible right should we put it up on our websites well praise the Lord now what's it for salty eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's yes they come so you need to tell me whenever I take that bread and I take that wine I am actually showing the Lord's death power by eating a piece of bread and by drinking that much wine in the bottom of the cup that big I am showing Lord just how in a ceremonial symbol so it means more than what you see you see one thing but it contains volumes every time you woke up here and do that you are showing the Lord's death you may not even say it I'm showing the Lord's that don't you understand when we dress a certain way when we live a certain way it's more than just the outside it's more than what people look at is objecting something else well for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord so if a person comes up in the living hypocritical life they actually enter into a condemnation by eating that bread and drinking that wine it's only a simple but it's a holy symbol now arts let's look at another ceremonial symbol that we keep before true believers that has so much more of a significance and what it would appear acts 22:16 now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord I thought it was the blood that washed our sins away what are you folks is quiet tonight can't you say friends folks without understanding its pitiful really it's pitiful so here Paul is instructing and that they're giving instruction in the New Testament to arise and wash away thy sin so there is a symbol then in keeping water baptism now if a person has not been washed by the blood of the Lord Jesus no water can wash your sins away but what does the water do the water answers to a clear conscience that your sins have been eliminated by the blood but symbolically you are keeping a ceremonial symbol which signifies more than just your body getting wet well will not swim and do the same thing Oh what if you just go jump in the lake and say well I'm gonna jump in the lake I'm gonna wash my sins well it's not the same thing if somebody don't stand there and side baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not the same thing what difference is I'm not sure I know well how could that day I'm not sure I can explain it to you but it's just true that's just the way it is so you mean I'm supposed to do that even though I can't explain it right I'm supposed to believe that I'm supposed to be baptized even I don't feel different right why it is a ceremonial symbol given to us to believe down through the ages and we do it but yet when were baptized it's more than what we're seeing clothes are more than what you see clothes project attitudes they project spirits motives objectives [Applause] what's in Romans chapter 6 verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death we are buried with him by baptism what is this a ceremonial symbol that actually takes the real believer now there's many people that get baptized in water that never this never becomes real to them because all it is is a tradition but when a real believer goes in this water and they have an understanding they know they're entering into the grave with the Lord Jesus amen when they come up out of that watery grave they're coming out of the tone with the Lord Jesus so they're doing one thing and look you're looking at it in with comprehends all my praise a lot but there is something far deeper than what we are seeing with the eyes therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death and as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also notice them the likeness of his resurrection so whenever the brothers or myself bring somebody up out of that water you don't seem the natural side they went down John come up well but there's more to it than that if I really believe they have rise to a new life so it is a ceremonial symbol which case a diverse meaning other than what you see now this is something that folks missed when it comes to women having long hair men having short hair women dressing a certain way men dressing a certain way oh my God looks on the heart and it don't make any difference that God what you were that's a lot and if you listen this Jews number right here brother been talking about them pastors that don't tell them women it's wrong for them to wear pants and all that he said he'll suffer in the regions of the lost I don't believe it argued with God then what's this in Colossians 2:12 berry was him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised him from the dead so a ceremonial symbol can only be ceremonial to some but to others who kid that it is so much more than what you see in the water it is something that they've experienced a change they've experienced in their life and they are carrying out the natural part which answers to a deeper counterpart so the bride looking at appearing in this vision seeing her with long hair and long dresses and holy and identified with the Word of God as far as what God calls as modest it means more than just a bunch of women run around Russ's it is a symbolism out symbolism of her chastity and her purity and her virginity to cross the word James v tells us that if there's any sick call the elders of the church let ulm anoint them with oil what for they got a valve stuck they've got a screw that's rested they got a bolt that needs to be loosened up I remember my brother and told us that a man who's not gifted to pray for the sick that all stands between him and that demon but he was gifted to pray for the sick he nor necessarily we have to use it Jesus never used it notice James didn't say call the preachers he said call the elders so some of y'all wonder why don't use all all the time I got a gift that stands between the mana devil they got your Norrington with all wah so do we have healing wall in this pulpit do I need to start bothering and selling it what is a symbol it is a ceremony assemble so an elder that does not have a gift to cast out Devils mother anoint the sick was a tall and it will stand between him and that disease much finer how can I know more than you can but if he prays for them or they pray the oldest pray the other and if they've even committed in his sin God will go ahead and take care of the sin while he's praying for their sickness talking about a double package now it's the same whenever we look deeper and deeper into the Word of God other the symbols of ceremonial symbols and things that God commands for us to do now you know even with the appearance and looks of something that's so difficult for so many people always has been they yet it seems to be getting worse and worse says Laodicea gets a death grip on the church and people will look I said what difference does it make if a man has long hair or a woman has short hair lipstick and makeup repair what difference does that make they totally miss the whole concept of homes well praise the Lord what's this in first Corinthians 11:3 but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God and every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head and the church said every woman that prayers or prophesy was her head uncovered dishonours her head which is her husband this is why as a rock to put away in divorce praise the Lord what difference does it make you're missing the symbol the symbol that lays beneath the power of the hair for a man to come in and have a long hair looking like a woman he is rebelling against his head which is Christ for a woman that cut hers off she's rebelling against God's original work although her husband wants me to I can believe that for some men I can believe that it's still wrong even if your husband wants you to do [Applause] praise the Lord first a woman be not covered and it also be shorn if it is shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and God what difference does that make so if I come here tonight with a cowboy hat on I've done wrong if I come out here tonight and preach with a cowboy I've done wrong yes I've done wrong why I dishonored my head not this my head wha my hair being cut shows my submission to my head my wife's being long shows her submission to me what is it a symbolic but what don't understand symbols love understands cake walks blood understands supper before church on Wednesday night cold black coffee down in the basement or whatever more that's what lot understand I would advise some of you folks to start putting on your websites how to survive in the tribulation because if you go in the rapture you will go through this message no other way oh thank you Jesus Louis from then I'll not to cover his head for as much as he is in the image and glory God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man that can remember keep the ceremonial symbol in your mind in order to make it all run in continuity is the bread the body no is the blood the line we trace the literal blood no but it symbolizes what's our talking about it symbolizes position and authority and Submission or it also symbolizes rebellion notice now neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power power power on her head so on the woman has long hair she's got some kind of power that if you run your fingers it's the same word as actually you shall receive exclusive Authority so when the woman is lining up to the image of God that he wants for her she has authority in her position can't you see the bride in the vision she was standing there in a place of authority under her headship Christ our head shall paint brother Branham our headship paint on Eurasia our head chef paint another preacher our headship as Christ iron exclusio will challenge our bodies verse 14 does not nature itself even teach you that if a man have long heads to Shaymin to him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hairs given to her for a covering all of those of you that are called and brother Bentham a false prophet and a liar God is obligated to prove what you're saying if you're telling the truth God always vindicates his word signs will follow you to prove what you're saying I'll challenge any of your all of you get all of you together let's find two of the meanest demon-possessed people in the United States or Canada I'll go in one room with one of them and all of y'all can go in the room with the other and let's see who comes out alive don't show me your mouse don't show me your words show me your power show me your power easy to sit down and type this and Tata you yellow-bellied coward you don't just say it prove it who that your God is right know that your God is supernatural prove that your Jesus is the rival for what you're saying or shut up oh you say but I named fair you're a preacher it don't make no difference when you go to heaven the word you ain't no preacher you're handling the world life pressures come on cast out devils our preachers heal the sick raise the dead you're out of your place on that so come on let's walk on water together [Applause] some of your poor ignorant message people let a bunch of these people bleed you away from the truth they ain't got one sign they ain't got one miracle Bank got one we you know why you're powerless to Isis where's the supernatural to prove what they're say define God's prophet and say was going to hell he's in Hell tonight there say it and lost with that God then God's obligated to stand behind them and back up what they're saying but of course God wouldn't do that cuz that would make him like them know what let's look at symbols now of clothing symbols of clothing I said 47:2 says take the millstone and grind meal uncover thy locks make bear the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea the shame shall be seen now listen how nakedness is uncovered take the millstone grime ill uncover thy locks make bear the leg uncover the thigh does everybody here know what your thighs you know where it starts and where it ends from here down to here mid knee someone when a woman wears a dress above that she's showing her nakedness and if it's so short but she sets down it don't go over her knees and she pulls Paul Ephraim Esther she's still naked i [Applause] nakedness she'll be uncovered yeah that shame she'll be seen I will take vengeance I will not meet thee as a man I will not meet thee as a man now watch this let me read this to you from from Kaufman's Bible commentary there was a woman who wanted to cross the river God wanted to disgrace the woman if you read the text in Isaiah chapter 47 you'll see why he commanded her to walk across the river then to lift up her skirt so high that her thigh would show now what God is disgracing this nation he's going to make them cross the river into tribulation and what they're going to do they're going to be shamed as they cross they're going into shame and they're going to be shamed as they cross so here's Israel or these nations that are dressed as a clean and they're going to have to take because the water's going to come up on the legs so they'll have to take their dress their princess gown whatever it is and raise it up now what's this and God said that when her thigh was exposed she would be naked and her shame would be revealed we read that she was told to uncover the locks and make the let bear the leg uncover the thigh and I'm nakedness shall be uncovered where she would have to wait them exposing her legs or in cases even deeper water lifting her skirt to reveal her nakedness of course now they don't do to cross rivers they did to go to Walmart now remember ceremonial symbol but I don't think it's naked but you're not God so what you think doesn't really matter this is what God said are you gonna be so foolish you would argue with God there's only one being I know that do that and that's the devil I guess that makes you a gentleman the uncovering of the thigh and the lifting of skirts were considered to be revealing ones nakedness behold I am against essential hope of the host I will uncover the skirts upon thy face I will show the nation's on nakedness and the kingdoms of that shame Nahum chapter 3 verse 5 hmm so showing the fire his nakedness dear Lord is in anyone who went below them saw the ancient church and the American church that they were naked had grave stuff in front of them about elephant skin and they were going along lasting what is it simple but the thing that is they didn't think there's naked but that's the way God saw notice bare the leg uncovered the thigh Passover the rivers the idea here is that of lifting up the long training of the Royal robe in order to pass through the rivers going into slavery in captivity she would be ashamed to bear her legs to cross the streams for she would be exposed to public view as a common person dake so what does that make women of this day then Adam and Eve had on fig leaves but still felt naked so it's not just the clothes you have on but its what those clothes cover and the answer them both are hoping and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together made themselves aprons and the heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called him to Adam and selling him were our town and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked how could you be naked with fig leaves on glory ouch Oh me what's this in 1st Samuel chapter 19 verse 24 when Saul had put off his Karim upper garment he has said to have been naked David went girded only with a linen ephod is said to have been uncovered 2nd Samuel 6:14 now you and I get in our mind start raving naked but not one stitch of clothes on that's not the Bible terms John 21 7 therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter it is the Lord now I'm Simon Peter heard it was the Lord he got his Fisher's code unto him for he was naked but not naked like you think once this born says he was naked he was undressed with nothing on but the undergarment our tunic so he had on his under clothes but that was considered naked without the Fisher's coat on quite a shape for a preacher to be anything now you're going to argue with the Bible well glory the word does not require us to suppose a greater degree of nakedness and this but yet people that think of the layout of sutures when God said your wretched your nakedness in God's eyes you're naked so if Peter had been on his under clothes made him naked now I wonder what that makes folks in this day who basically were under clothes out in public we realized that we could revert it back in time to what the law the cops the police women were taught years ago what they would have arrested people for 50 years ago we wouldn't have enough jails in prison to house all of them because the majority population especially in America would be in prison for nakedness they would wrote them tickets years ago for the way people go to church and today then wrote tickets and throw them in jail they would have arrested them for indecent exposure I'm not sure that even know how to describe that today companion book notes says that this way nope naked the Greek word goon knows this means he had only on his tunic or his undergarment so the man brother BAM said who are shorts that's a woman's undergarment Lord shall have mercy golems he said the Son of God trucking down the street a pair of shorts on he said not know some of God he said mom so denomination I'll give you the initials of it bsas big sister society big society you made with him now I know you disagree million there but that's exactly the first [Applause] now watch Jesus carried the same biblical thought of nakedness Matthew 25:35 I was in hunger then you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me naked and you clothed me let's look at this Greek word goodness ill-clad clad and undergarments only the outer garments are quote being laid aside to be lightly or poorly clad not start naked you understand but to be poorly clad too low and too high come on church don't get quiet my lord if I didn't know about other things some of your sister said some of the stuff at home in the closet there was this so big jesus said that whenever I was ill Claire you come not that they were sitting there totally naked and everything have nothing but they were ill Claire the outer garment was gone the outer garment was gone and they had on their undergarments praise the Lord same word revelation 16:15 behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk heel out and they see his shame can't you see the way God is going to look on the layer to see in church can't you see all these folks that have left the message and stripped their clothes off and found this new freedom can't you see the way God looks at him he looks at him as being naked and shaking their body and being vulgar and filthy and dancing to rock and roll but rather than intially sees the bride he sees the bride marching alone Christian soldier marching as to war what are we fighting with her long hair and modest clothing our attitude right lord before God being dressed the way he wants us to be [Applause] why because it is a warfare our world in it so we're fighting revelation 17 16 and the ten horns the south souls upon the beasts they shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked same word ill-clad now what's clothing can also reflect the spiritual symbol as they're 61 3 to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness so you then were talking about a person's attitude but it is symbolized by closing so then that they would be down and they would be heaven all burdened down but God would give them a garment of praise well I need that garment every now and then don't you I need to change clothes sometimes I get that old spirit of heaviness omnia you know all the things you deal with in the world God say here go slip this on sign what is it it symbolizes something that we put on and we take that other one off he don't put that garment of praise over the top of that other one but he wants us to get rid of that thing so I can put this one on that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified as their 6110 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he has covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom himself with all of us has abroad of Dawn herself with her Jo I performed a lot of weddings in my years first when I performed I was about 18 19 years old I'm not saying that it couldn't happen but all the ones I've ever seen the only one who ever come to the wedding with a wedding dress on what's the bride now some of the guests have come in and they'll have their black gothic garb on and the others will be dressed up like Country and Western you know whatever others will come in with their orange on because they're a UT fan and people wants to wear what they are it's race week so you know if you got a wedding this weekend they're probably gonna come in with NASCAR and you know all them other types of folks because they're wearing what they love come on now but who comes in with the wedding dress on the bride and many times the bride will be in white and the others are being pink or blue or mint or chiffon or whatever more they dress a different color you guests come here your dress different can't you see why the bride must dress and act and look different from the world we are not the guests of this wedding haha oh my god we are not the visitors at this wedding we are the waters getting cry so we've got a dress different than the rest of us we've got a restaurant [Applause] it's not fitting for the bride to have them scarlet or purple [Applause] but fine linen clean and avoid Lord God Lord Jesus he has clothed them of the garments of salvation he have cover me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deckard himself with his ornaments as a bride adorned as herself their jewels isaiah 64:6 but we are all as an unclean thing all our righteousness are filthy rags you agree with this so then your clothes can reflect where you are spiritually all right don't matter what you wear really so how many people have you seen women on the latest people's magazine or cosmopolitan or where are those magazines are open every checkout and they look like you long hair long dresses big long skirts what if clothes don't matter I mean you know that there are who they are without the clothes I don't think they're not they are who they are coupled with the clothes [Applause] some of them Jensen as you will name recognize them if they dress like you what's-her-face probably scare the liver out of you [Music] you understand that me the movie stars actually didn't like the idea with television and movies going high-definition because it would show their bumps and blemishes and scars and they want you to think they're perfect they want you to model after them all my lord can you imagine all the modelling clay and all the paintings taking this you know this ender they have to do to make them look perfect so they make everything high-definition listen brother this word is multi high-definition you got to get your own layer to see a makeup up cuz it's gonna show all your falls it's gonna show all your acne bumps it's gonna show all your worldly ways everything at it my let me come before that line right now and show up all of my spots and all my blemishes so I can get them all to Carol so and I'll still know that day he'll look at me and say you're perfect you're perfect [Applause] what's this second Corinthians five 114 or Ferris a House of this Tabernacle where does L we have a building of God in house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which was from heaven if so be notice being cold we shall not be found naked do you understand those who go into the sixth dimension or the fifth dimension of the lost they have no theophany body spiritually their naked their soul their souls into a rim on their their held but they have no body like the saints who go into the sixth image kept in the presence of God your new clothes is waiting for you but the sinners when they died their soul goes in there and is put into a holding place and in the eyes of God when they raise they stand before the white throne with no theophany the lack of us theophany proves but that's why when he steps off of that mercy seat you can come right out from under the throne of God raring and ready you can come out of that you're not shamed you're not backward you're not bashful ha your clouds proves you're part of the resurrection you have already raised with him you've done what he asked you to do your own baby's word you're not naked my fall either in this tabernacle do groan and being bird enough of that we would be unclothed but clothed upon mortality that it might be swallowed up of life first Peter 5:5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elderly a all of you be subject one to another and be closed with humility for God resisteth the proud and give us grace to the humble revelation 10:1 I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven claw what's the cloud the dyed garments from Bo's are all had been laid aside now this clothing is required while opening of the seven seals so are the common Southwest the same thing the Angels were veiled in Lord of mercy he calls himself a humanity to become a high priest and die for now he's probing himself with a supernatural cloud as the angels come down to break open the seals to call your name he takes on water climbing up a cloud revelation 17:3 so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations of filthiness of her fornication and the power void was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother the mother well if she's a mother she's had the memo some man and it wasn't God so there's only one other source she's been with the devil and her union with the devil has produced one harlots and prostitutes like herself [Music] can have a few more minutes what is the biblical purpose of clothing or apparel there are definitely things that are set forth in the scripture to identify what clothing in God's eyes are for the first purpose for clothing is to cover your nakedness of course now what's this in Genesis 3:21 and unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them now God it would not have been necessary had God accepted what Adam and Eve had done now you see I to the very foul of the very first man it shows his difference of understanding decency versus God's because in his idea decency wants to cover the middle I guess that's why you see folks going around the way they are today they're unregenerate foul a man they had received the Holy Ghost remember them heathens in Africa when both of em said they received Christ they said right there didn't have tops on didn't have the clothes on and all there and they would fold their arms right in the presence of those men he said because Christ structure heart right there and what about some of these heathens in America that take more off each year and we call them heathens praise the Lord now when man fell he knew that he was naked he knew there was something wrong but his definition of acceptance in the eyes of God of what was modest and acceptable as totally different than God's view friends don't you see where people are don't you see where they are that's how what God don't care this is fine this is fine Adam and Eve again but when he come in the presence of God he realized that what he had made wasn't enough so what he thought was modest before God's presence now made him naked in the presence of God can you imagine when people come up in the white throne judgment and they stand are spiritually naked Lord Jesus now once you notice on the Adam and his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins so it took more than one skin so it must not have been a micro or a mini or a rabbit living on that well the Lord God needs several skins because when the Lord God clothes his children he calls them in modesty and those who's trying to pull you away from the word let me repeat God's prophet to you don't you believe that old painted up liar all the forms will be gone tomorrow I'll take now notice on the animals on his wife the Lord God didn't make coats of skins and what's this according to Strong's dictionary the Hebrew word means a garment that went from the shoulders undoubted their chests and bats after doing this they were clothed and no longer naked now an Adam had sewed together the fig leaves for him and Eve together however was it it when he did not cover Eve's chest nor his own nor thighs I don't have to get too much plainer hopefully you'll understand but when God closes them God calls him from here down you argue with God about it lady and some of you saw tonight man I sent an adopter selfish yesterday waiting for an appointment and it's a set there they had country music going I thought Lord hammer you came go to a doctor that been that old rotten stuff and his one country music song after another I was probably there 20-30 minutes waiting for the doctor to come in check out nothing wrong with mr. don't worry some of them out there there's bet to have a spell they thought has died someone about broke out in tongues is your God he's got cancer no no so all of us sitting there this song came on and it was about a honky-tonk type of setting and it was saving about a woman coming into this honky-tonk dressed all sexy the tight clothes all all that on and the words that they kept repeating in this song over and over again was this lord have mercy how did she get to Umbridge his own and I stepped out brother Jim and I listened to that song and I thought how can people who claim to be Christians be so blind when singers and all this knows that for a woman to put on those tight britches it's nothing but a sexy symbol and Christian women will put them on and say they're modest they're deceived and I thought God the words of them songs will condemn them at the day of judgement when the very thing is that listen to it how many men go when you see a woman dressed sideways the first thing in your mind is how modest incredible the women that started wine I'm thus left this word you tell me how many at times that your husband told you how modest you look now that you're doing it or has he told you how sexy you look and how good you look what if he's looking at you and seeing that other men are saying the same thing [Applause] bless God out to you Danya reg and I can't wait to huh I can't wait to meet you insane asylum don't give me your words show me your power this line at ten people here with cancer you pray for one I'll pray for nine I'll give you the heart you say you shouldn't say that oh but I should he gave me permission yesterday how will meet with you sign me and Silas come on Silas me and Silas will join together [Applause] [Laughter] mr. friend my religion ain't just words it ain't just a bunch of rhetoric I've seen what my God can do I just read about it I've seen what my God can do I've seen the power he's displayed I've seen what this word can produce now watch how far below the waist did it need to be covered to the ankle the di4 down the thigh exodus 28:42 God was given instruction regarding the clothing for the priests you shall make for them linen breeches to cover their bare flesh nakedness in the King James Version they shall reach for my loins even to the thighs what was considered nakedness exposing the loin or the thigh John Gill says from the loins even to the thigh shall they reach they were to reach above the navel near the heart to the end of the thigh which is the knee and that was there under close now you imagine under the heart now this is what's under the roads Oh puppet commentary says under the fat to the bottom of the thigh were they a join on the Neath now this is our underpants so you say men and women out you know what they got on under clothes you Big Sisters around this message as I said the other day some of you men without pot-bellied years old like a pumpkin the two sticks suck on it think you're so sexy apparently something y'all must have got a hold up prettier legs and what I got the Lord must have been running out when he made mine I must have been round the very end of the assembly line but the Donna you don't know how cool it is to them shorts on you're right you don't know how hard it's gonna be out to wild cause you wore on so I'll take my heat right now thank you because they'll say ass I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing no it's not that won't wretched and miserable and blinded poor and naked now this is who brother Branham saw in this vision now make this challenge to you those of you that are against it those you made they're saying a line whenever you have oh I'll limit you to 1,500 visions and whenever you pray for pass the Kings he prayed for it and when you pray for at least two or three congressmen that got up and walk and when you prove you're vain words I might Matt listen I won't believe you but I'm not listen to rich and Christians Goods and God gave us a little preview of how he looks at it so he gets his profit and projects through his eyes did you hear I tore up by the venom was when he saw this he thought he was at fault he thought it was his fault that this was the bride he said all I've done I've been listening this choosin of a bride for the last seven eight days listen to it three four or five times a day and when you listen to it and you hear how he gets into this vision and he actually thinks it's his fault be shut up there's no need for me to even try I'm finished I'm finished out of all that I've done all that the preachers have done and this is what we present for a bride but then you heard the music in the background [Music] onward Christian soldiers marching as to war a lot oh it's her again what was it the second coming not just waiting for the second coming of the bride girl do you honestly think brother branham introduced this is a brother venom introduced long hair he wouldn't whether it is appropriate it God acted down the Garden of Eden [Applause] Marcin asked our sisters young ladies don't you let these old painted faces Jezebel's make you feel bad now let's look at it on the basis of reasoning only what if what if God doesn't want didn't very careful women wear dresses or pants or shorts or bikinis to church or whatever don't really matter to God you wear whatever you want where then tell me what if your sisters lost by addressing visa but what if God looks at his nakedness in his ass then what have these women who do it lost everything I [Applause] told someone not long ago I said so what if there isn't a god this person was telling me that wasn't I said so what if there isn't a god whatever this is that I pray to here's my prayers he answers them [Applause] he encourages me when I'm down lifts me it helps me he loves me Oh sister what if there isn't what you're saying what if there isn't no God what if I lost in living for you tell me what have I lost but let me turn it around to you what if there is what have you asked he just kind of grand and smirked somebody you know so tell me what if I lost 11 for I've got such peace I don't serve a historical God but I serve a God that we see him right here week after week heal the sick how many miracles have we read Ronald with his pulpit of things that our God is done you tell me that's our imagination how can my imagination raise somebody the sick and afflicted in our day no way Lord Jesus pray together Lord I pray that should make it more real to his father I don't know when I have received so many texts and so many emails about anything that I've preached preachers streaming the services on Wednesday night at Lourdes the last several winds announced before I even get back to my office texts from ministers got one from brother Tim this week they hit listen to the surface different men of God streaming or listen going back and listening Lord we know it's the time it's the time for your word to be preached oh it doesn't come without cost doesn't come without people really cool and making fun but that's to be expected lord I just pray for if there is forgiveness I pray for forgiveness all these things that are being posted in videos that are being made and you know it's nothing that outright lies I pray for your forgiveness form Lord may your mercy reach out to him I won't even call me a brother won't even refer to me as being a Christian which is pretty sad my Lord Jesus I think it's not a mistake what you're having me to deal with on Wednesday and which I made their worth on the weekend they don't understand I know they don't understand how the things that's said and go on but you do it where is me Lord you know my makeup most people that ain't around me they don't I think I enjoy preaching hard you know how that kills me Lord on Thursday I just drag around and Friday I drag around vice couple of weeks Lord I just felt so low preaching what I've been preaching the Lord I know it's the truth I know it's the truth and as a human sometimes I see things in your word and I think oh no I wish hadn't showed me that Lord it's just the human part but yet lore don't want to stand for what's right what's true you don't know how you know how many times they don't but how many times I've wished and prayed I could just be a pastor out in the sticks of Kentucky somewhere somewhere back in the backwoods and nobody know me not have no website not have nothing where people to ever hear me I just preached these same things to my little church and just the local people would hear it but for whatever reason Lord you called us to be in a different position I pray for strength for courage Lord I'm so glad you gave brother Branham this vision that we would be encouraged in the end time to be able to know that bride will come in order they know even they can make their mistakes because the last two stepped out a line he come to himself and in the room they're screaming get back in line so we know the bride can get out of line but she won't stay out of line so Lord how many other they are left maybe there's some out tonight your God may you be merciful to me and help us Lord Jesus help us that we can march this great army of God Lord Jesus name praise the Lord you love him with all
