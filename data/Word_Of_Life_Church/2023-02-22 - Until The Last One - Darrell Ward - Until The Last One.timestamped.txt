[41:02] has fallen upon us and that all the
[41:04] inhabitants of the land faint because of
[41:06] you
[41:07] if we have heard how the Lord dried up
[41:09] the Waters of the Red Sea for you when
[41:10] you came out of Egypt and what you did
[41:12] into the two kings and the amorites that
[41:14] were on the other side of Jordan Xi'an
[41:17] and OG whom you utterly destroyed and as
[41:20] soon as we had heard these things our
[41:21] hearts did melt neither did they remain
[41:23] any more courage in any man because of
[41:26] you
[41:27] for the Lord your God he is God in
[41:30] heaven above and in the earth beneath
[41:33] now therefore I pray you swear unto me
[41:35] by the Lord so to have showed you
[41:37] kindness that you will also show
[41:39] kindness unto my father's house and give
[41:41] me a true token
[41:44] and that ye will save alive my father
[41:46] and my mother and my brother and my
[41:48] sisters and all that they have and
[41:51] deliver our lives from death
[41:55] and the men answered her our life for
[41:57] yours if you utter not this our business
[41:59] and it shall be when the Lord hath given
[42:01] us the land that we will do kindly and
[42:05] truly with thee
[42:06] then she let them down by Court through
[42:08] the window for her house was upon the
[42:10] town wall and she dwelt upon the wall
[42:13] and she said unto them get you to the
[42:15] mountain at least the pursuers meet you
[42:17] and hide yourself there three days until
[42:18] the Pursuits be returned and afterwards
[42:21] you may go your way and the men said
[42:23] unto her we will be blameless of thine
[42:25] oath which thou has made us swear behold
[42:28] when we come into the land Thou shalt
[42:29] bind this line of scarlet threat in the
[42:31] window which thou didst let us down by
[42:33] and thou shalt bring thy father and thy
[42:35] mother and thy Brethren and all thy
[42:37] father's household home unto thee
[42:40] and it shall be the whosoever shall go
[42:42] out of the doors of thy house and to the
[42:43] street
[42:44] his blood shall be upon his head and we
[42:47] will be Guiltless
[42:49] that whosoever shall be with thee in the
[42:51] house his blood shall be on our hand our
[42:54] head if any hand be upon him
[42:57] and if thou utter this our business then
[42:59] we will be quit of thine oath which thou
[43:01] has made us to swear
[43:03] and she said according unto your words
[43:05] so be it that's that needs to be our
[43:09] attitude according to Thy word O Lord so
[43:11] be it and she sent them away and they
[43:14] departed and she bound the Scarlet
[43:17] thread amen
[43:19] may the Lord have the blessing to the
[43:20] reading of his word
[43:22] now we find that Israel was on the move
[43:25] they had with them a pillar of fire they
[43:28] had the great General Joshua and they
[43:31] were moving towards their Promised Land
[43:34] sounds exactly like us and they passed
[43:37] over the borderline of Jordan River into
[43:39] the Palestine then Joshua sent two spies
[43:41] into Jericho and one place the prophet
[43:44] said there were two preachers in another
[43:45] place he said there were two tape boys
[43:49] and these men had the message of Joshua
[43:51] where they had the word of Joshua and
[43:54] they were loyal to Joshua amen they had
[43:57] the same vision they had the same goal
[43:59] they had the same purpose they had the
[44:01] same objective they had the same
[44:04] anointing
[44:05] and they go into Jericho and they come
[44:08] up to the home of Rahab and now let's
[44:10] just picture her for a few minutes the
[44:12] prophet said Rahab was young and she was
[44:14] beautiful and she had been trapped into
[44:17] a life of prosecution of a prostitution
[44:20] as she was a gentile and the prophet
[44:24] said that she was rotten to the Core
[44:27] sounds like a lot of our lives at one
[44:29] time
[44:30] and there was nothing that she had to
[44:33] offer
[44:35] The Messengers that came to her house
[44:37] had come there not by her Merit but
[44:41] solely by the grace of God
[44:45] and the spies these preachers
[44:48] the prophet said another place there
[44:50] must have been some tape Boys in there
[44:51] somewhere that slipped in somewhere for
[44:53] the predestinated sea
[44:56] you see the Bible said that the sons of
[44:58] God they are led by the spirit of God
[45:01] now why of all the houses in Jericho did
[45:05] they go to her house
[45:06] in all the houses that was up on the
[45:09] wall why did they go to her house
[45:11] because she was predestinated to receive
[45:14] the message
[45:17] but I said anyone who knows anything
[45:18] about the Bible knows that that Harlot
[45:20] was predestinated she sure was she did
[45:22] the Bible said she perished not with
[45:24] them who believed not that's right but
[45:26] she believed the message of the hour and
[45:29] I say to you tonight my brother my
[45:30] sister why has the message came to your
[45:33] house
[45:34] think about it tonight why has the
[45:37] message came to you it's not my own
[45:39] marriage but it's by the grace of
[45:41] almighty God Amen but why has the
[45:43] message be come to your house because we
[45:45] were predestinated to receive this
[45:48] message amen
[45:50] hallelujah we're not Baptists we're not
[45:52] Luther we're not Catholic we're Sons and
[45:55] Daughters of God Birth by the word of
[45:57] God Amen and placed in this hour to
[46:00] overcome this age
[46:02] that the world may know he's the same
[46:04] yesterday and forever not just in the
[46:07] life of brother Branham but in the life
[46:08] of every True Believer
[46:11] hallelujah what saints of God I take
[46:14] tonight we should be the happiest people
[46:16] on the Earth in spite of our trials in
[46:18] spite of our troubles in spite of our
[46:20] sickness we should be the happiest
[46:22] people on the Earth tonight because God
[46:24] has sought us out by the message of the
[46:27] hour
[46:28] Oh Glory to God
[46:31] Hallelujah oh it makes me feel good
[46:35] I wasn't looking for God
[46:37] you weren't looking for God he came
[46:40] looking for us amen
[46:43] the first time I ever heard of this
[46:44] message was in 1966 I was just a little
[46:48] boy three or four year old and a man
[46:50] come to our house with a big old tape
[46:52] player and prayed The Prophet's message
[46:54] but even then as a little boy what was
[46:56] it God was seeking us out amen
[47:01] Hallelujah
[47:03] amen God has sought us out by the
[47:06] message of the hour and when Rahab got
[47:09] her first hearing of Israel and of a God
[47:12] that answered prayer
[47:14] not only a God to pray to
[47:17] but a God that answers back
[47:20] I'm so glad saints of God that we serve
[47:23] a God not a dead God of stone
[47:26] not a God that we pray to and cry out to
[47:28] and lay before him but yet he cannot
[47:31] answer us back
[47:33] that's not the god that we serve tonight
[47:36] that we cry out to him and tell him our
[47:38] troubles but he has no ability to answer
[47:40] back or a thought of someone's
[47:42] imagination as I heard Brother David
[47:44] Tyler say one time when he was in India
[47:46] and he saw a man packing around an idol
[47:48] and Brother David said he watched that
[47:50] man set the idol down and he worshiped
[47:52] it and Brother David said as I was
[47:54] watching that I thought I'm so glad I
[47:55] don't serve the God that I made with my
[47:57] hands but I serve a God who made me with
[48:00] his hands amen that's the God we serve
[48:03] tonight not a dead God not a dumb God
[48:05] but a God who hears our cry he sees our
[48:08] tears he said I'll never leave you
[48:10] knowing what I forsake you that's the
[48:12] God we serve tonight the god that's able
[48:14] to answer back for he's setting up
[48:16] Jeremiah 33 3 call unto me saith the
[48:19] Lord and I will answer thee
[48:23] oh Hallelujah
[48:25] amen
[48:27] when she heard there was a god of
[48:29] Miracles a God who could perform
[48:31] Miracles who could dry up the sea Ray
[48:34] bread out of heaven
[48:37] her heart began to tremble and when she
[48:40] got her first message
[48:42] from those two preachers you see the
[48:44] first two pulls got her attention
[48:48] but it was the third pull the revealing
[48:51] of the word that brought her life
[48:55] and quickly she heard she believed and
[48:58] she acted and when that word flashed
[49:00] across her path not a message of just
[49:02] healing but a message of life God didn't
[49:05] sinned by the bread of just to restore
[49:07] heal it to the church but to bring the
[49:09] life back into the church to restore the
[49:12] name of Jesus
[49:13] for there's power in the name of Jesus
[49:16] that's why Satan fought so hard to take
[49:19] the name out of the church and have the
[49:20] baptizing father sudden Holy Ghost
[49:22] because he knew the power of that name
[49:25] in the hand of the believer but what did
[49:27] God do well he was buried down in the
[49:29] Dark Ages but God began to restore that
[49:31] church and what has he done in the last
[49:33] days he has placed the name of Jesus
[49:35] back in the church again
[49:37] he said I no longer call you at church I
[49:40] call you Brad mistress Jesus Christ
[49:43] [Applause]
[49:44] oh brother Ben said you got a kid named
[49:47] Ricky change his name
[49:49] you got a kid named Elvis change his
[49:51] name because you take on the
[49:52] characteristics of that name and Ricky
[49:54] means rat and Elvis means cat I believe
[49:56] it was he said or something like that
[49:58] well if that's true for Ricky and that's
[50:00] true for Elvis is that not true for
[50:02] Jesus that would we take on the name of
[50:04] Jesus we take on the characteristics of
[50:07] that name amen
[50:10] Abram could never have be a father of
[50:12] Nations under the name of Abram but he
[50:15] met God and what did God do he changed
[50:17] his name from Abram to Abraham and under
[50:19] the name of Abraham he could manifest
[50:22] the father of Nations because that's
[50:24] what his name meant
[50:27] oh I'll make a Baptist out of him
[50:30] Hallelujah
[50:32] amen
[50:34] amen quickly
[50:36] quickly she accepted it with all of her
[50:40] heart
[50:41] amen and she said give me a true token
[50:46] one that Joshua recognizes
[50:49] that's what I want
[50:51] don't give me just a religious covering
[50:54] don't give me just a bunch of do's and
[50:55] don'ts
[50:59] I'm not even interested in what I could
[51:01] say about myself but give me something
[51:03] that God recognizes
[51:07] but remember said there is a token over
[51:09] there the holy spirit that belongs to
[51:11] God it's his and when I see that token I
[51:13] will pass over you a positive token the
[51:16] holy spirit is our token therefore when
[51:19] you receive the Holy Ghost you've passed
[51:22] from Death to life that's all there is
[51:24] to it because life is in you and you can
[51:29] no more perish
[51:30] then God can perish
[51:35] he said give me a true token the Spy
[51:37] said you know we come through something
[51:38] like that ourself
[51:40] and God gave us a true token he took the
[51:42] red blood of a lamb and applied that
[51:45] blood and it brought us life and it
[51:48] brought us deliverance and it brought us
[51:49] safety and it brought us assurance
[51:53] and God spared us they said now take
[51:56] this Scarlet thread and let that you let
[51:58] us down by and hang it in the window and
[52:00] it shall be to you not just a sign not
[52:03] just the token but a true token
[52:06] and that truth token because she
[52:09] believed the report of the messages it
[52:11] was her protection it was her witness it
[52:14] was her Assurance it was her seal it was
[52:17] her sign the token was the
[52:19] identification that she belonged to God
[52:25] hallelujah hallelujah she believed and
[52:30] received the message listen to me it's
[52:33] not enough to say I believe it
[52:36] the devil believes it
[52:38] imagine
[52:40] here not long ago was in the backfield
[52:42] praying for the young people and while I
[52:45] was praying back there it just just
[52:46] something prayed out of me
[52:48] and said are we just getting them to
[52:50] shout or are we getting them to Christ
[52:56] and while I was praying I felt like the
[52:58] Lord spoke to me and said go ask them
[53:01] are you in the message or is the message
[53:04] in you you see if you're just in the
[53:06] message somebody can talk you out of it
[53:08] but if the message is in you all hell
[53:11] can't get it out of you because it's
[53:13] life it's the token it's the word of the
[53:16] hour amen
[53:19] it's not enough to say I go to word the
[53:21] life I believe
[53:22] it's just being able to read
[53:25] you can't just say I believe it you must
[53:28] receive it
[53:30] and apply the token
[53:33] the evidence that Noah believed and
[53:36] received the message from God think
[53:38] about this
[53:39] no I just didn't say I believe it but
[53:41] the evidence that Noah believed and
[53:43] received the message from God was
[53:45] manifested in the ark that he built
[53:51] the ark he built was the evidence he
[53:55] believed the report
[53:57] because he acted on it
[54:01] well I believe God's A Healer but you
[54:03] got to act on it well I believe God
[54:05] gives a holy ghost you've got to act on
[54:06] it the prophet said God gives the Holy
[54:08] Ghost to them who will ask him are we
[54:10] willing to ask him
[54:12] remember that crippled man with the foot
[54:14] when brother said in Jonesboro Arkansas
[54:15] and he come around there you know him
[54:17] that the black girl was blinded you know
[54:19] the story and the lord gave her back her
[54:20] eyesight and there's a man standing
[54:22] there with a little twisted up foot and
[54:23] he said I know who you are brother
[54:25] Branham
[54:26] I've been standing here three days in
[54:28] the ring
[54:30] just to be prayed for
[54:32] but I believe now whatever you ask God
[54:34] God will do it
[54:37] but oh God we can't set 45 minutes in a
[54:40] beautiful building but this man was
[54:42] willing to stand not one hour not one
[54:44] day but three days in the rain just to
[54:47] be prayed for what will God do in a
[54:49] situation like that when you're hungry
[54:51] for it when you want it when it's more
[54:53] than your very life it's more than your
[54:56] popularity it's to know somebody when
[54:59] you want it and you're willing to die
[55:01] out for it
[55:04] to say I believe it
[55:07] we must receive it
[55:09] Amen brother Ben said you don't come
[55:11] together yet so we're not just yet to
[55:14] come together and talk about the message
[55:16] they come together to apply the blood to
[55:19] apply the token verbum said don't come
[55:21] together and say I believe it don't just
[55:23] come together and say I believe it
[55:25] but get beneath it get into it
[55:31] think of this
[55:33] judgment
[55:35] could not strike Jericho
[55:39] until Rahab had come under the
[55:42] protection
[55:43] of the token
[55:45] she had to come out of Jericho before
[55:48] God destroyed it
[55:50] because seed cannot perish
[55:52] with Nancy
[55:56] you thought wait a minute now preacher
[55:57] you said she came out before destruction
[55:59] failed but if my Bible tells me she was
[56:02] up there on the wall yeah but you see
[56:05] when she come out of the token as far as
[56:07] God was concerned she was already out of
[56:09] it oh Hallelujah we may be here and lay
[56:12] ought to see him but let me tell you we
[56:14] are out of laodicea
[56:17] we may be here in this Dark Age but we
[56:20] are not in the darkness amen we may be
[56:22] in a time of blindness but we are not
[56:24] blinded people amen we are the children
[56:26] of the most high God Children of the
[56:29] light light bearers in the end time
[56:32] Hallelujah that's who we are
[56:38] the Bible says she perished not with
[56:40] them who believe not she believed the
[56:43] message of the hour
[56:47] God could not destroy the Jericho
[56:50] until she had come out of the protection
[56:51] of the token and I heard putting you
[56:54] Putin or putting or whatever his name is
[56:56] over in Russia
[56:59] warned of a World War III global
[57:02] conflict
[57:03] that's the issues nuclear threats
[57:07] but I just want that old boy to know
[57:09] it ain't the U.S that's going to stop
[57:11] him it ain't the U.N that stops him it's
[57:13] you
[57:15] he cannot push a button to release a
[57:18] nuclear warhead until this bride
[57:20] Hallelujah is out of the way man
[57:24] and the prophet said if they push that
[57:26] button before one ever stuck this nation
[57:28] we would be golden amen
[57:31] [Applause]
[57:32] I ain't worried about Putin a Putin or
[57:35] whatever I ain't worried about him I
[57:37] ain't worried about Biden come on
[57:38] somebody that's not my headship my
[57:41] headship is Christ the word
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:45] and from another kingdom
[57:48] I got another leadership
[57:50] I got another revelation

[58:42] stands on the mountain she could be
[58:45] powder before morning
[58:48] and never it wouldn't be anything
[58:50] alarming about it no more than it's

[1:01:13] as the shepherd seeks out his flock in
[1:01:15] the day that he's among his sheep that
[1:01:17] are scattered so will I seek out my
[1:01:19] sheep I will seek out my sheep and will
[1:01:23] deliver them out of all the places where
[1:01:26] they have been scattered in a Cloudy and
[1:01:29] a dark day I will seek them out and I
[1:01:32] will deliver them from all the places
[1:01:34] that I find them ahead where did he find

[1:01:49] in the day of cloudiness
[1:01:53] God said
[1:01:55] I will seek out my sheep
[1:01:57] I will search for them in a dark day
[1:02:01] in a cloudy day
[1:02:03] just before judgment there will still be
[1:02:06] seed

[1:02:14] ain't no time to fold our hands ain't
[1:02:17] nowhere we're in a good church we
[1:02:18] beautiful church we can rest a while
[1:02:20] ain't no time to sit back
[1:02:24] just before judgment there will still be
[1:02:26] seed that must be sought out
[1:02:28] God is a spirit how will he accomplish
[1:02:31] this he said I will search out my sheep
[1:02:34] who have scattered in a dark and cloudy
[1:02:36] day I will search out my sheep
[1:02:40] not somebody else's sheep not the
[1:02:43] devil's but my sheep
[1:02:47] how will he accomplish this
[1:02:49] God is the spirit
[1:02:51] you remember Jesus when he stood there
[1:02:53] looking out upon the Harvest
[1:02:55] he was the lord of the Harvest he said
[1:02:57] the Harvest is ripe and the labors are
[1:02:59] few
[1:03:00] praying you the lord of the Harvest that
[1:03:02] he will send laborers into this harvest
[1:03:05] in other words pray to me that I will
[1:03:07] send laborers into my Harvest which I'm
[1:03:09] just telling you it's such a needy thing
[1:03:15] laborers God's a spirit how will he
[1:03:18] accomplish there
[1:03:19] laborers
[1:03:21] you see God made himself a co-partner
[1:03:25] to accomplish this work
[1:03:29] let me say that again God is a spirit he
[1:03:32] has no hands he has no eyes
[1:03:36] how will he accomplish that
[1:03:38] he has made himself a co-partner
[1:03:42] the prophet said make it himself with
[1:03:44] man so bound together that he only walks
[1:03:47] through the agency of man he chose man
[1:03:50] to work for him he could have chose the
[1:03:52] son to preach the gospel he could have
[1:03:53] chose the wind or the trees or the stars
[1:03:55] or a tape player
[1:03:59] but he chose man
[1:04:01] he chose man
[1:04:04] and he veils himself inside and hides
[1:04:07] himself from the unbeliever and reveals
[1:04:09] himself to whom he will
[1:04:11] he could have chose the Sun the moon the
[1:04:13] stars the wind but what did he do he
[1:04:16] chose you he chose me he chose us
[1:04:21] he co-foundered himself with us
[1:04:24] all saints of God let your light shine
[1:04:27] let your light shine bring your light to
[1:04:31] the darkness
[1:04:33] is that not what he done for us
[1:04:35] When We Were Young he called her names
[1:04:37] we tried to run from him but still he
[1:04:40] came he stepped into the darkness
[1:04:43] and called us to his light because
[1:04:45] that's the kind of God that he is
[1:04:49] and he has co-partner himself with you
[1:04:53] with you
[1:04:56] and get too many gay men's out of that
[1:05:00] but the part of it lays in human beings
[1:05:02] do you believe that
[1:05:05] thank you the kingdom of God lays within
[1:05:07] the human being Jesus said in one place
[1:05:09] I'm the vine you're the branches
[1:05:12] the vine can't bear the fruit the
[1:05:14] branches and the vine Bears the fruit
[1:05:16] God cannot bear fruit of himself it's
[1:05:18] got to take the church is that right
[1:05:20] he's got to take you you bridge us to
[1:05:24] bear fruit and when you branches are
[1:05:26] yielded to the vine then fruit comes
[1:05:28] forth you see what I mean God wants your
[1:05:32] hands God wants your eyes God wants your
[1:05:34] tongue he wants your lips he wants your
[1:05:36] ears he wants your hands your feet so
[1:05:38] that he can bring forth fruit through
[1:05:40] you
[1:05:42] God's seeking out his sheep using his
[1:05:45] body on the earth to do it who is that
[1:05:48] body it's you
[1:05:51] God seeking out his sheep who have been
[1:05:53] scattered in a dark and cloudy day what
[1:05:56] is he using
[1:05:57] it's Bonnie that's on the earth now
[1:06:03] what good does it talk about a
[1:06:04] historical God we need a present tense
[1:06:06] God let the little boy when the storm
[1:06:09] coming his mama said well honey God's
[1:06:11] with you he said but mama I want a god
[1:06:13] with skin on him

[1:06:20] a present tense God who's an
[1:06:22] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[1:06:27] Hallelujah
[1:06:29] God seeking out his sheep using his body
[1:06:32] on the Earth
[1:06:34] to do it
[1:06:35] you see brother Burnham said we are bone
[1:06:37] and flesh
[1:06:39] of Jesus Christ we are his bones and his
[1:06:42] flesh
[1:06:43] Spirit of his Spirit life of his life

[1:07:03] done before he veiled himself God the
[1:07:06] invisible God became visible when he
[1:07:08] veiled himself in a body called Jesus
[1:07:10] now that same God has veiled himself in
[1:07:13] another body it's called The Bride
[1:07:17] but she is the evening life the evening
[1:07:19] light is more than just the name of the
[1:07:21] Tabernacle it's more than just a quote
[1:07:23] book it's more than just a tape come on
[1:07:25] somebody but you are the evening light
[1:07:27] Jesus said I'm the light of the world
[1:07:29] then he said you're the light of the
[1:07:31] world
[1:07:36] he said oh that my father hath given me
[1:07:39] shall come
[1:07:41] shall come that don't mean could be hope
[1:07:43] so maybe it means they coming
[1:07:49] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:07:52] me I will in no wise cast out and I give
[1:07:55] unto them
[1:07:57] eternal life and they shall never
[1:08:00] perish
[1:08:03] they shall never
[1:08:05] perish neither shall any man
[1:08:09] pluck them out of my hands
[1:08:16] God's today in the devil in hell
[1:08:19] they ain't an organization they ain't a
[1:08:21] government they ain't a stipulation
[1:08:23] there's not a mandate there is nothing
[1:08:25] that could take my people out of my head
[1:08:29] I paid the price for them they belong to
[1:08:32] me
[1:08:34] the evidence it's the stars is in his
[1:08:36] hands amen these are my sheep and my
[1:08:40] pastor
[1:08:42] Hallelujah Hallelujah My Father which
[1:08:46] gave them me his greater than all
[1:08:51] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[1:08:56] my father's
[1:08:57] hands
[1:09:04] you know I've said this before but it
[1:09:07] just come to my mind I'm at the age that
[1:09:09] I lose things
[1:09:12] now don't you laugh at me you will too
[1:09:14] if time stands long enough
[1:09:16] I lose my keys find them in my pocket
[1:09:21] lose my glasses find them on my head
[1:09:24] I don't know none of you do that so
[1:09:26] y'all pray for me
[1:09:31] but you don't
[1:09:32] we're not in his pocket
[1:09:36] we're not on himself
[1:09:39] we're not locked up in a safe but where
[1:09:42] are we we are in his hand he knows
[1:09:45] exactly where you're at and every mother
[1:09:47] Hallelujah
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:53] he's sitting at the right hand of God
[1:09:54] tonight doing his mediator work and when
[1:09:56] that last soul is saved
[1:09:59] that was redeemed and seen and known by
[1:10:02] God before the foundation of the world
[1:10:04] when that last soul is saved that closes
[1:10:07] the book and the lamb comes and takes
[1:10:09] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:10:11] that sets upon the throne then he's
[1:10:13] coming
[1:10:14] then he's coming to the Earth
[1:10:18] when that last one comes in
[1:10:20] closes the book
[1:10:22] and cause
[1:10:24] for his bride
[1:10:28] oh God
[1:10:34] will put his whole program on hold
[1:10:37] until the last seed
[1:10:40] comes in
[1:10:42] think about that the love of God he will
[1:10:44] put his whole program on hold
[1:10:48] because he'll not lose one
[1:10:51] seed and whenever name that's on that
[1:10:54] book that was placed there before the
[1:10:56] foundation of the world
[1:10:58] comes forth
[1:11:00] he closes the book
[1:11:02] he closes the book
[1:11:07] as it goes
[1:11:08] for his breath
[1:11:10] but he'll put the whole program on hold
[1:11:13] until the last one
[1:11:15] comes
[1:11:17] the love of God
[1:11:19] the love of God
[1:11:21] I don't know about you tonight but that
[1:11:24] humbles me to think brother Joy
[1:11:26] brother Tony that humbles me to think
[1:11:29] that he would do that for me
[1:11:38] so we wonder why the Revival is not
[1:11:39] going on right now why we don't see
[1:11:41] enthusiasm with the people I I don't
[1:11:43] know why but let's just think what if
[1:11:44] it's like this maybe there's a little
[1:11:46] boy in here tonight or a little girl
[1:11:47] born over Seattle Washington and that
[1:11:49] book holds her name and he come to
[1:11:51] redeem whose names is on the book redeem
[1:11:53] needs to bring back from where it fell
[1:11:55] from
[1:11:57] and in the human race she was fell and
[1:12:00] she can't accept it now she's too young
[1:12:03] so the church WIll slug right along just
[1:12:06] play along we'll have meetings and so
[1:12:07] forth till that last person is brought
[1:12:10] in then that book is closed there's no
[1:12:12] more added then it's all over
[1:12:15] when that time will be none of us knows
[1:12:16] but let's just keep doing all that we
[1:12:19] can do
[1:12:20] to his glory until the time
[1:12:23] is over
[1:12:25] let's just keep doing all that we can do
[1:12:29] we don't know who that person is they
[1:12:31] may already be in we're just waiting
[1:12:32] he's coming we do not know it'll never
[1:12:34] be revealed to man the time of his
[1:12:36] coming because not even the angels of
[1:12:37] heaven knows when it's going to be but
[1:12:39] we're just looking for it at any time
[1:12:40] and waiting and watching for his coming
[1:12:44] the wrath of God never fell on Jericho
[1:12:47] until Rahab and her family were under
[1:12:50] the token when she came under that
[1:12:52] protection then the Wrath came down
[1:12:55] and the prophet said we're looking for
[1:12:57] the coming of the Lord and as that song
[1:12:58] said we're seeking out that little lost
[1:13:00] sheep and he won't come until the
[1:13:02] Sheep's sin everyone has to be in the
[1:13:04] foe he won't close the door
[1:13:07] until the last one
[1:13:09] comes in
[1:13:14] despise despise Rahab
[1:13:19] everyone that is under the protection of
[1:13:22] this token will be spared
[1:13:24] and what did it do to her it thrown her
[1:13:28] into action

[1:17:09] and Jesus will come how do we know who
[1:17:11] they are

[1:17:24] God knows which one a rainbow trout
[1:17:30] you say brother Daryl this nation's
[1:17:31] burned over
[1:17:32] with the gospel it's just burn over
[1:17:34] territory
[1:17:35] I know that
[1:17:38] I know that
[1:17:40] I remember as I first started out
[1:17:41] preaching you could preach this message
[1:17:43] and I remember the altar would fill up
[1:17:44] with people
[1:17:46] and they can preach yourself to death
[1:17:47] and people hardly move seems like
[1:17:53] I know it's burned over
[1:17:56] yet there has to be Gleaners
[1:17:58] there has to be someone who can go
[1:17:59] backwards and forth preaching search and
[1:18:01] calling looking seeking until that last
[1:18:04] one has come
[1:18:05] somebody that'll clean the field
[1:18:07] somebody will go back and find that one
[1:18:09] weed that's been bruised that's been
[1:18:11] trampled on that's been neglected that's
[1:18:13] been overlooked and said brother you can
[1:18:15] make it you're a part of this God loves
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:21] well brother Darryl I failed I've messed
[1:18:23] up we've all failed we've all messed up
[1:18:26] that's what makes his grace so amazing
[1:18:37] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] I'm so glad father's got a hold of her
[1:18:41] head
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] do you love him
[1:18:48] when the last one comes in
[1:18:50] than the word
[1:18:52] will not be effective
[1:18:54] anymore
[1:18:57] when that last one comes in the word
[1:18:59] will lose its effectability
[1:19:02] it'll be like casting Pearls Before the
[1:19:05] swans
[1:19:06] over the whole
[1:19:08] Earth
[1:19:10] but while the word is still effective
[1:19:13] let's take that sword
[1:19:15] and go to the heart of our enemy
[1:19:17] and let's cut loose those he's Chained
[1:19:19] and those he's bound and the those he's
[1:19:21] put into the cage we have been given the
[1:19:23] key Hallelujah you have the authority to
[1:19:26] unlock to loosen to bind by the word of
[1:19:29] reconciliation through the ministry of
[1:19:31] reconciliation
[1:19:32] every prison door that Satan tries to
[1:19:34] lock somebody in you can unlock that
[1:19:36] door Hallelujah by the key that's been
[1:19:39] given into the hand of the believer
[1:19:41] I give you the keys to the kingdom or
[1:19:43] whatever you loose on Earth all loose in
[1:19:44] heaven whatever you bind on the earth I
[1:19:46] will bind it in heaven
[1:19:48] Hallelujah
[1:19:51] do you love him tonight friends
[1:19:57] several years ago
[1:19:59] sister Sylvia
[1:20:01] Bailey wrote a little poem and they put
[1:20:03] it on a plaque
[1:20:04] gave it to me when I was working with
[1:20:06] the young people I've still got it in my
[1:20:08] in my study
[1:20:10] and it says these words
[1:20:13] no greater gift can Grace the hand
[1:20:16] than precious Seeds of Life you hold
[1:20:19] servants chosen of the master
[1:20:22] workers in the fields
[1:20:25] of Souls
[1:20:30] receive to possess
[1:20:32] precious words of life
[1:20:35] you say brother dial I'm not a preacher
[1:20:37] I'm not a missionary I'm not an
[1:20:39] evangelist maybe that's true
[1:20:42] but you see
[1:20:44] that may not be your field
[1:20:47] neither was Rahab Rahab wasn't a
[1:20:49] preacher she wasn't a prophet she wasn't
[1:20:50] an evangelist
[1:20:53] she was just a woman
[1:20:56] but you see her life was her sermon
[1:21:00] let me say that again her life was her
[1:21:03] sermon and I'd rather live the sermon
[1:21:06] then preach one
[1:21:07] any day
[1:21:09] any man can put some quotes together and
[1:21:11] preach it but it takes a real believer
[1:21:13] to live it
[1:21:16] you see sister you'll never stand behind
[1:21:18] a Pulpit and take a Bible and preach a
[1:21:20] message
[1:21:22] but your congregation may be your
[1:21:24] children
[1:21:25] it may be your neighbor
[1:21:27] it may be that lady at Walmart
[1:21:30] that just the way you dress and the way
[1:21:32] you conduct yourself and let me tell you
[1:21:34] sisters appreciate
[1:21:36] I appreciate your sacrifice the way you
[1:21:39] live the way you carry yourself
[1:21:41] and God bless you I want you to know the
[1:21:43] prophet of God said in the eyes of the
[1:21:45] Lord You're Beautiful
[1:21:48] I don't care what the world thinks about
[1:21:50] us
[1:21:51] as long as he's okay with us
[1:21:57] if you see your field maybe your
[1:21:59] community
[1:22:01] remember Isaiah
[1:22:02] what would he say after his confession
[1:22:05] and the cause of fire touched his lips
[1:22:07] he said then I Here I Am Lord
[1:22:10] see me
[1:22:12] Sydney
[1:22:13] and how many of you feel that way this
[1:22:15] evening
[1:22:16] would I I I ain't no preacher Lord I I
[1:22:19] can't take a text and preach I'm not a
[1:22:21] brother Donnie
[1:22:23] but Lord
[1:22:25] here I am
[1:22:29] send me Lord
[1:22:31] let me testify
[1:22:34] you'll be testified to the lady at
[1:22:36] Walmart
[1:22:38] let me testify to anyone that I can let
[1:22:40] me do something let me do something for
[1:22:41] the Lord
[1:22:43] I'm not asking to be a preacher I'm not
[1:22:46] asking for that Lord
[1:22:48] but if I'm a farmer
[1:22:50] let me witness to other farmers
[1:22:53] let me witness to the man I sell my
[1:22:55] grain to if I'm a carpenter let me
[1:22:56] witness to other Carpenters other
[1:22:58] contractors let them see you
[1:23:02] in me
[1:23:04] because sometimes
[1:23:06] sometimes it's not even what you say
[1:23:09] it's just how you conduct yourself
[1:23:15] I remember one night I was coming out of
[1:23:16] Virginia
[1:23:18] and I'd preached hard and my stomach was
[1:23:19] hurting really bad I had chills in my
[1:23:21] arms it was just hurting
[1:23:23] and I was coming in it was late at night
[1:23:24] I was driving home
[1:23:27] and I stopped at a convenience store to
[1:23:29] get some milk I thought it might settle
[1:23:30] my stomach a little bit it was just
[1:23:31] hurting so bad
[1:23:34] and I walk up and get the milk and I
[1:23:36] walk up to the counter and there's a
[1:23:37] girl standing there with a dog collar on
[1:23:39] with spikes she had purple hair and
[1:23:41] different colored green and all
[1:23:45] and I set the milk down on the counter
[1:23:48] and you know what she said to me
[1:23:50] she said you're a Holiness preacher
[1:23:54] I don't t-shirt in the blue jeans she
[1:23:56] said you're a Holiness preacher I said
[1:23:58] that's right I said how did you know
[1:23:59] that
[1:24:00] she said I don't know how I knew that
[1:24:03] and I said you have a real good evening
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:14] Hallelujah you see Jesus didn't wear
[1:24:16] something to make himself different he
[1:24:19] was just a man of men that's right
[1:24:21] we'll have to turn our collar backwards
[1:24:23] in a big cross owner
[1:24:25] so just let love of God
[1:24:28] flow from our lives
[1:24:30] there's plenty of empty chairs here
[1:24:33] let's go find someone
[1:24:36] it might be that person you go to school
[1:24:38] with
[1:24:46] let me do something
[1:24:47] let me testify to the insurance man let
[1:24:49] me testify to the paper boy let me do
[1:24:52] something Lord let me go into the
[1:24:53] neighborhood and find favor with with my
[1:24:55] sister here next door who's evil in Rome
[1:24:57] let me give her a testimony with
[1:25:00] sweetness
[1:25:02] the prophet said listen we're at the end
[1:25:04] time
[1:25:06] what I say it was reverence and respect
[1:25:08] as these last couple of minutes is
[1:25:10] floating by look what God to my opinion
[1:25:13] will do must do and will do in this last
[1:25:17] day is to find a tool for the Harvest
[1:25:21] he's got to find a tool
[1:25:26] for the Harvest
[1:25:27] he's got to find a tool to thrash the
[1:25:29] floor any farmer when he goes to the
[1:25:31] Harvest he has to have a two to do it
[1:25:33] with certainly he's got to have a sharp
[1:25:34] sickle or something some instrument to
[1:25:36] thrash out the Grain and the Harvest is
[1:25:39] ripe
[1:25:40] God take us in your hand
[1:25:42] make us Bond Servants of Your Love use
[1:25:45] this for tools to bring the realization
[1:25:47] to the sinful cursed Earth that we're
[1:25:49] living in today
[1:25:51] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:25:53] today and forever
[1:25:57] in this day of gross Darkness
[1:26:00] don't be afraid
[1:26:02] to let your light shine
[1:26:09] don't be afraid
[1:26:12] to let your life shot
[1:26:15] take your light
[1:26:16] to the darkness
[1:26:19] and if you find that one Soul it might
[1:26:22] be the last one
[1:26:24] but if you find that one Soul the
[1:26:27] prophet said your name would be
[1:26:28] associated with them
[1:26:30] throughout
[1:26:32] eternity
[1:26:38] do you love him today
[1:26:42] how many I maybe it's different I just
[1:26:44] failed to go this way but
[1:26:46] how many tonight we say Lord
[1:26:49] hear my Lord
[1:26:52] you speak
[1:26:54] let me be so full of you
[1:26:57] let me be so full my saucer is
[1:26:59] overflowing
[1:27:02] it's your life that you love let your
[1:27:05] kindness let your long suffer
[1:27:08] not just out there in the world Lord
[1:27:11] and to my wife and to my husband to my
[1:27:14] children
[1:27:16] to my wayward family
[1:27:20] to her brothers who are not here
[1:27:22] to our sisters who are not here
[1:27:25] Rahab went out
[1:27:28] search them out she got her father she
[1:27:30] got her mother and all that they had
[1:27:32] better brothers and her sisters brought
[1:27:34] them all in under the token
[1:27:37] and when the rat failed the prophet of
[1:27:39] God said she never even got excited she
[1:27:42] just sat there and read a few good
[1:27:43] scriptures
[1:27:44] and when it was all done Joshua told
[1:27:46] them two spies they'll go get her
[1:27:49] and bring her out
[1:27:51] oh for it let's claim our families let's
[1:27:54] claim our children
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:27:58] you don't have to shove it down the
[1:28:00] throat just be sweet and kind just be
[1:28:03] salty because there's something about
[1:28:04] salt
[1:28:05] that makes you thirsty
[1:28:10] a man told me one time was we close
[1:28:14] said the greatest compliment that I ever
[1:28:16] had
[1:28:17] when I was at work
[1:28:19] and someone come up to me and said you
[1:28:21] know I know we don't believe alike
[1:28:23] but I want you to know
[1:28:25] every time I get around you
[1:28:28] I feel the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:28:34] that we could ever be given
[1:28:37] it's not that we can quote the Bible
[1:28:38] from Genesis to Revelation if you can
[1:28:40] God bless you
[1:28:42] but they're the greatest thing it's ever
[1:28:44] said about us was it someone
[1:28:49] so Jesus
[1:28:52] in me
[1:28:55] all right that my girls could say I saw
[1:28:58] Jesus in my daddy
[1:29:02] I saw Jesus and my brother
[1:29:07] it's all said and done what are we
[1:29:10] really here for
[1:29:13] to be a nightmare
[1:29:16] that the world may know that he lives
[1:29:20] and I say to you tonight let's make this
[1:29:22] commitment
[1:29:24] a new building
[1:29:26] a new era in our church history
[1:29:30] they let it be a new time of renewing
[1:29:31] and commitment
[1:29:33] Henry Consecration and rededication
[1:29:37] hey man do you love him tonight
[1:29:40] so let us work
[1:29:43] Brother's come let us work
[1:29:46] till Jesus comes
[1:29:48] let us work
[1:29:50] until that last one
[1:29:52] comes in
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:56] he may be here tonight friend it may be
[1:29:58] you you may be sitting right here
[1:30:01] it may be over in Africa it may be over
[1:30:03] in France
[1:30:04] it may be down
[1:30:05] under the underpass
[1:30:09] I don't know you don't know
[1:30:11] but God does know
[1:30:13] and all he needs is someone
[1:30:16] I remember a few years ago I was in a
[1:30:18] meeting in Nicaragua
[1:30:23] who's going to have a prayer line but
[1:30:24] there was just so many people to pray
[1:30:26] for
[1:30:28] foreign
[1:30:32] Mass prayer for everybody we'll just lay
[1:30:35] hands on one another I said just lay
[1:30:36] your hands on one another we'll just
[1:30:38] have one prayer because the Bible said
[1:30:40] these signs shall follow them they
[1:30:41] believe they shall lay their hands on
[1:30:42] the sick I said let's just lay hands on
[1:30:44] one another and just as I got ready to
[1:30:46] pray I looked about halfway back in
[1:30:49] about a crowd of 600 people I suppose
[1:30:51] and I look about halfway back and there
[1:30:52] was a sister had her hand up
[1:30:57] something spoke to my heart and said go
[1:30:59] lay your hand on her
[1:31:00] and I jumped off the platform and went
[1:31:03] back there and by that time I hadn't
[1:31:04] started praying so people were looking
[1:31:06] to see well I hadn't started praying and
[1:31:08] so I went back to where she was and I
[1:31:10] just she had her hand up and I just
[1:31:11] reached up and touched her hand like
[1:31:13] this and we started praying and the
[1:31:15] people started praying
[1:31:17] and when the service is over I was
[1:31:18] outside and the sister came up and
[1:31:19] wanted to talk to me she said tonight
[1:31:21] when you told the people to lay hands on
[1:31:23] one another
[1:31:25] she said nobody laid their hand on me
[1:31:29] and she said I thought Lord what's wrong
[1:31:31] with me
[1:31:32] yeah that nobody would want to lay their
[1:31:34] hand on me and she said I started crying
[1:31:37] because she said I just wanted someone
[1:31:39] to care
[1:31:41] I just wanted someone to pray for me
[1:31:45] and she said I said Lord why won't
[1:31:47] nobody lay their hand on me and she said
[1:31:50] a voice spoke and said I'll lay my hand
[1:31:52] on you
[1:31:53] this is that voice no sooner spoke
[1:31:56] then you put your hand in my hand
[1:32:01] am I jesus of course not
[1:32:04] but he used me to touch her
[1:32:07] like he'll use you to touch someone else
[1:32:14] do you love him tonight
[1:32:16] that's just about our heads
[1:32:23] Heavenly Father
[1:32:30] Lord
[1:32:32] I'm not a great speaker Lord
[1:32:37] but in my heart
[1:32:42] I have a desire
[1:32:47] to help someone
[1:32:51] find that troubled sword
[1:32:54] that young person that's struggling
[1:32:59] and oh God I pray tonight
[1:33:03] may we realize Lord
[1:33:06] you don't need a great education
[1:33:09] you don't need someone with a lot of
[1:33:10] money
[1:33:12] you just need a housewife a farmer a
[1:33:14] painter a policeman
[1:33:16] a college student high school student a
[1:33:18] young person
[1:33:20] a father a mother
[1:33:24] there's someone Lord that you can get
[1:33:26] into your hand
[1:33:29] that you can live through them
[1:33:31] express yourself through them
[1:33:34] for all you was you poured into Christ
[1:33:36] that all Christ is
[1:33:37] he was born into his church
[1:33:40] that oh God may we go forth Lord
[1:33:44] father not everybody has been called to
[1:33:46] stand on the street corner
[1:33:48] not everybody's been called to stand In
[1:33:50] a Pulpit Lord to travel in other
[1:33:51] countries
[1:33:54] but Lord our field could be in our own
[1:33:55] backyard
[1:33:57] in our own School
[1:33:59] in our own home
[1:34:02] but North wherever it would be
[1:34:05] may we be faithful Lord
[1:34:09] granted tonight father

[1:34:21] to be an instrument
