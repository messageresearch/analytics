[52:11] that no matter how impossible things can
[52:14] be sometimes yet Our God's power and his
[52:18] word is so great

[57:04] words of life
[57:06] granted Lord God
[57:09] amen amen God bless you you may be
[57:12] seated
[57:16] I'd like to speak to you again today if
[57:18] you don't mind on
[57:20] the bride's Bill of Rights
[57:23] I know I've read this to you but I want
[57:26] to read it again the Bill of Rights
[57:28] guarantees the liberty of the individual
[57:30] and Limits The Power of government
[57:32] in judicial and other proceedings the
[57:35] U.S Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791
[57:39] and guarantees among many other things
[57:42] the rights of free speech freedom of
[57:45] religion and trial
[57:47] by jury
[57:49] our founding fathers must have deemed it
[57:52] very very needy
[57:55] that after they developed the
[57:58] constitution of our great nation
[58:00] that they felt something was left out
[58:04] and they needed to clarify and make it
[58:08] clear that people would know themselves
[58:11] and the government would know
[58:14] that we needed these rights there's many
[58:17] rights of course it's been added since
[58:19] then many of you have heard about the
[58:22] Miranda Rights you all know what the
[58:24] Miranda rights are it was given of
[58:27] course a decision made by the Supreme
[58:29] Court I think it was
[58:30] 1966 and it is whenever you are arrested
[58:34] that a police officer will tell you you
[58:36] have the right to remain silent if you
[58:39] say anything it can and will begin used
[58:41] against you you have a right to an
[58:43] attorney if you cannot afford an
[58:45] attorney the court will appoint for your
[58:47] attorney named after a man of course
[58:49] whose last name was Miranda
[58:51] and it's something that has been
[58:53] instituted and our nation to protect so
[58:57] if God wanted to give his people rights
[59:01] you know what that speaks to me that
[59:03] speaks to me that he knew we was going
[59:06] to need them
[59:07] he ain't going to get them to us just to
[59:09] so it'd sound pretty and nice if I need
[59:12] rights I'm going to need them and if I'm
[59:15] going to need them I guess I need to
[59:17] understand what I'm going to need them
[59:19] for
[59:19] and I need to know what they are and I
[59:22] need to know how to apply whenever I'm
[59:26] in real need
[59:27] so the majority of us more than likable
[59:29] never even need to understand our Bill
[59:32] of Rights as American citizens of course
[59:34] the way our country's going in the
[59:36] direction it's gone you never know
[59:38] anymore do you we never thought we'd be
[59:40] where we are right now and who knows if
[59:43] the Lord tarries for a couple of more
[59:44] years where it will be that they will
[59:46] start and we know that the prophet tells
[59:49] us that there will come a press and they
[59:50] will try to shut us down and all that
[59:52] sort of thing but then he also tells us
[59:54] in Christ the minister of God revealed
[59:56] they'll never shudder up shall be taken
[59:59] up so how that's going to work I don't
[1:00:01] know but if need be then I think we need
[1:00:04] to know our Bill of Rights but one thing
[1:00:07] I do know for sure as Christians as
[1:00:10] children of God I think the Lord wants
[1:00:13] us to know what is rightfully ours as
[1:00:16] Believers can anybody say Amen to that
[1:00:18] so as the people of God there are things
[1:00:21] that are given to us some of them come
[1:00:24] automatically some of them do not now
[1:00:27] now the attribute of righteousness which
[1:00:30] is right standing with God it's
[1:00:32] something that comes by faith of
[1:00:34] accepting the atonement of what he did
[1:00:37] for us the Perfection I heard brother
[1:00:40] Joe talking about the other night to the
[1:00:41] youth and he was talking about
[1:00:43] perfection it just struck me again about
[1:00:45] the two aspects of perfection and one of
[1:00:49] them is the tiskanu which is the
[1:00:52] Perfection which is given to us by
[1:00:55] accepting the appropriation of the
[1:00:57] sacrifice of the Lord Jesus but then
[1:01:00] there is another word that is used in
[1:01:02] the New Testament perfect Perfection
[1:01:04] which is to Leos which means to grow up
[1:01:07] and mature that's not speaking about
[1:01:09] sinlessness but it's speaking about
[1:01:12] becoming mature perfect sounds like the
[1:01:15] same thing to us but it's not so there's
[1:01:17] a difference between the two and some of
[1:01:20] those things actually grow and they
[1:01:23] mature and they become more fluent in
[1:01:26] our lives as we become more are
[1:01:28] submitted to him and then there are
[1:01:30] certain things that we must do ourselves
[1:01:32] to have on our own I've been looking at
[1:01:35] it in the last couple of days where
[1:01:36] brother Branham would tell people that
[1:01:39] we're sick and there was various things
[1:01:40] going on with them and he would tell
[1:01:42] them be a man stand up take your healing
[1:01:46] from the devil don't let the devil rob
[1:01:48] you of your healing I thought isn't that
[1:01:51] amazing there was times that God
[1:01:53] supernaturally would come through and
[1:01:55] just drive that evil away from people
[1:01:58] and then it had to do anything basically
[1:02:00] except just believe and then there'll be
[1:02:02] other times that they would have to
[1:02:04] fight and they would have to push beyond
[1:02:07] that in order to get what was rightfully
[1:02:10] theirs I mean he's had to do it in your
[1:02:11] life sure if you've been saved long you
[1:02:13] have and yet it takes the spirit of God
[1:02:16] to help us to know which one of those
[1:02:18] times is it going to be sovereignly
[1:02:21] given or is Sovereign Grace going to
[1:02:24] come and anoint me anoint you to be able
[1:02:28] to stand and take what is rightfully
[1:02:30] ours I believe myself it takes the
[1:02:33] spirit of God to help us with that so if
[1:02:35] we got a little bit of time today I'd
[1:02:37] like to go through a few more of our
[1:02:39] riots is that all right the rights as
[1:02:41] the people of God and I'm going to start
[1:02:44] out heavy from the get-go okay so we're
[1:02:47] not playing I'm not laying no Foundation
[1:02:49] no buttering up here comes the big guns
[1:02:52] right off one of our rights as the
[1:02:56] people of God is to have deity inside of
[1:03:00] us
[1:03:01] now this is not one of those things that
[1:03:04] we learn this is not one of those things
[1:03:07] that we will eventually grow into it's
[1:03:10] not one of those things that we can be
[1:03:12] taught into educated into you'll never
[1:03:15] have enough emotion to work yourself up
[1:03:18] into it God is the only one that can
[1:03:21] give us deity because God himself is the
[1:03:25] only source of deity but God is so great
[1:03:29] that he wants to share deity with his
[1:03:33] wife now everybody in the realm of
[1:03:37] Christendom does not have deity embodied
[1:03:41] in their flesh every person that is
[1:03:44] saved does not have the indwelling
[1:03:47] presence of deity they are Justified and
[1:03:51] they're coming up to the second stage of
[1:03:53] Grace hopefully sanctification but deity
[1:03:55] can only come when the deified one
[1:03:59] imparts this portion of his own being
[1:04:02] inside of us now if we have that today I
[1:04:06] figure we ought to be just some of the
[1:04:07] happiest Mortals that are alive on the
[1:04:09] earth because you realize a lot of
[1:04:12] people will never have that but yet God
[1:04:15] has made it available if we are the
[1:04:18] right category and we believe what he
[1:04:20] said notice in Saint John 14 20 at that
[1:04:23] day you shall know that I am in my
[1:04:26] father and ye in me and I in you now
[1:04:30] Jesus didn't say they knew it then but
[1:04:33] he sat at that day so he was speaking
[1:04:36] prophetically to a timeline that people
[1:04:40] on the Earth would start recognizing
[1:04:42] notice how he said it that you shall
[1:04:45] know that I am in my father and ye and
[1:04:49] me and I in you notice this one is
[1:04:52] different than any other of the
[1:04:54] arrangements of the threefold of this
[1:04:56] mystery that Jesus says this generally
[1:04:58] he would say the father and me and then
[1:05:01] you you but in this one he sandwiched us
[1:05:04] right in between him and the father now
[1:05:08] remember him and the Father the father
[1:05:10] is not an old man and Jesus is a young
[1:05:12] man but the father is the spirit and
[1:05:15] Jesus is the embodiment of the word so
[1:05:18] you and I become sandwiched in between
[1:05:21] the spirit and the word so the father is
[1:05:24] going to be the one that will pull us to
[1:05:27] himself notice he said it that day you
[1:05:30] shall know that I am in my father and ye
[1:05:32] and me and I in you verse 23 Jesus
[1:05:36] answered and said unto him if a man
[1:05:39] loved me he will keep my words and the
[1:05:42] church said he won't just say he
[1:05:45] believes them he will keep them amen
[1:05:49] notice so he will keep my words and my
[1:05:52] father will love him and we spirit and
[1:05:56] word will come unto him and make our
[1:06:01] Abode with him oh he said no brother
[1:06:03] Donnie he's talking plural that's right
[1:06:06] he is talking plural not two Gods Not an
[1:06:08] old man and a young man but he's talking
[1:06:10] of this this Divine thing that God
[1:06:13] divided himself into which is spirit and
[1:06:16] word so we will come and make our Abode
[1:06:20] in him now for those of you that read
[1:06:22] your Bible and you listen to tapes and
[1:06:24] you listen to Ministry and you try your
[1:06:27] best to be able to fill your minds and
[1:06:29] your spirit with the word of God if you
[1:06:31] don't do that I'd advise you to do so
[1:06:33] because what that does is that gives you
[1:06:36] the building up of much mechanics in
[1:06:40] your human spirit that will build up the
[1:06:42] mechanics in your mind and in your
[1:06:45] memory you see one reason that I study
[1:06:47] so much I don't have to study as much as
[1:06:50] I do but I choose to do it this way
[1:06:53] because I found it out years and years
[1:06:55] ago when I was a Pentecostal preacher
[1:06:57] that the more that I laid in my spirit
[1:07:00] once I got anointed by the Holy Ghost it
[1:07:04] was like I was just given the Holy Ghost
[1:07:06] more wood and more coal and more
[1:07:09] combustible substance for him to anoint
[1:07:11] well I found that to be true when I say
[1:07:14] the message of the hour so whenever I go
[1:07:16] to preaching and a lot of times it
[1:07:18] happens and I'm counseling people and me
[1:07:20] and Carol whenever we get done with that
[1:07:22] we did here just like Sunday and
[1:07:24] whenever we both left she said I was
[1:07:26] absolutely amazed I said I was too I
[1:07:29] ain't even looked at them scriptures and
[1:07:30] I don't even know how long I haven't
[1:07:32] even remember those quotes and all how
[1:07:34] long but what you have stored in you
[1:07:36] then the Holy Ghost can come and use
[1:07:39] what you've got there now if all you've
[1:07:42] got is money and fishing and hunting and
[1:07:45] going here and Disney and this and that
[1:07:48] and the other the Holy Ghost don't use
[1:07:50] Disney quotes the Holy Ghost don't use
[1:07:53] the price of gold and the price of
[1:07:55] aluminum and this and that and the other
[1:07:57] the Holy Ghost uses his word
[1:08:01] and you've got to realize as a soldier
[1:08:04] you've got to have the word stored up
[1:08:06] inside of you for the Holy Ghost to use
[1:08:08] it
[1:08:09] now notice what Jesus says we will love
[1:08:12] him and we will come unto him and make
[1:08:16] our Abode with him so unlike the Old
[1:08:19] Testament Prophet when the spirit of God
[1:08:21] would come on the man and then leave him
[1:08:24] come on the man and leave him unlike
[1:08:26] that the spirit of God in the New
[1:08:29] Testament does not want to come on us he
[1:08:32] does not want to make us emotional we
[1:08:34] believe in Emotion we believe in shout
[1:08:36] and run and praising God but I want more
[1:08:39] than that myself I don't want just that
[1:08:41] whenever I'm here and then when I walk
[1:08:43] out of here I ain't got enough Victory
[1:08:44] to even blowing the peach fuzz off of
[1:08:46] the peach I want an eviction whether I
[1:08:49] feel God or not that I can stand and
[1:08:51] look the devil rights Square in the face
[1:08:53] and say back off this is my territory
[1:08:56] this is my property oh yes scream let's
[1:08:59] holler with the best of them let's clap
[1:09:01] our hands but let's have enough Victory
[1:09:04] on Monday morning that when the devil
[1:09:06] says boo you boo back you don't just
[1:09:09] count down oh devil oh devil oh no we
[1:09:12] want more than an emotional worker we
[1:09:15] want a stirring of the pillar of fire
[1:09:17] down inside of our hearts
[1:09:21] notice First Corinthians chapter 3 verse
[1:09:23] 16. know ye not that ye are the temple
[1:09:27] of God can you imagine how astounding
[1:09:29] that this must have been in the first
[1:09:31] century for people who are still
[1:09:33] transitioning from the Jewish temple and
[1:09:35] the Jewish temple was still built by
[1:09:37] this time this is written around 66 A.D
[1:09:40] so almost some 30 years before it's
[1:09:42] going to be destroyed and you was Jews
[1:09:45] there were some Jews mixed amongst the
[1:09:47] people there because Apollos Aquila
[1:09:49] rather than them they were there living
[1:09:51] in the city of caress so the Jews would
[1:09:53] have got this written epistle by Paul
[1:09:55] and you imagine when they opened this up
[1:09:58] and Paul said you are on the temple of
[1:10:00] God you talking about hard to swallow
[1:10:03] because some of them have been raised
[1:10:05] going to the temple can you believe in
[1:10:07] your mind that they would have had a
[1:10:09] hard time sure transitioning from that
[1:10:12] Holy Holy place and looking at themself
[1:10:15] and saying you've got to be kidding me
[1:10:17] well I can see God living in that with
[1:10:20] all the gold and the silver and the blue
[1:10:21] and the purple and all them magnificent
[1:10:24] building and all the great orchestration
[1:10:26] and all the cherubs and this and that
[1:10:28] and that same God would now live inside
[1:10:31] of me and I would be the Temple of the
[1:10:35] Holy Ghost but I guarantee you they send
[1:10:37] a lot there in Koreans and when they
[1:10:39] read this they said praise be to God
[1:10:42] no ye not that ye are the temple of God
[1:10:45] and that the spirit of God dwells in you
[1:10:48] now remember this is your right as a
[1:10:51] real son or daughter of God to have
[1:10:53] deity living inside of you and the
[1:10:56] church said First Corinthians 6 19 what
[1:10:59] know ye not that your body is the Temple
[1:11:02] of the Holy Ghost which is in you which
[1:11:05] ye have of God and ye are not your own
[1:11:11] Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 to whom
[1:11:14] God would make known what is the riches
[1:11:17] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:11:20] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:11:25] of glory so you believe Jesus Christ is
[1:11:28] deity
[1:11:30] you believe he is deity then you have a
[1:11:34] right as a child of God to embody deity
[1:11:38] I'm not talking about something that is
[1:11:41] less than Christ himself I'm not talking
[1:11:44] about a lesser dose of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:47] I'm talking about the very same thing
[1:11:50] that fell on the day of Pentecost and
[1:11:53] what I'm hearing let me say it this way
[1:11:54] this is not just for preachers and it's
[1:11:57] not just for a few special men in the
[1:12:00] message let me tell you this so you
[1:12:02] understand it right from the very
[1:12:03] beginning I do not believe that
[1:12:06] preachers have the only option on
[1:12:08] receiving the holy ghost or being led by
[1:12:11] the spirit of God I do not believe that
[1:12:14] God intends for his bride to Rally in
[1:12:18] this last day around a few special
[1:12:20] gifted men and everybody else just kind
[1:12:23] of sets down and well nobody's gotten us
[1:12:26] I saw that in Pentecost it made me so
[1:12:29] sick to see it I don't mind telling you
[1:12:31] I see the same thing reoccurring again
[1:12:33] and our message and you know what it
[1:12:35] always does it will always pull pull the
[1:12:39] emphasis away from God in the body and
[1:12:42] put it on God and a few hand-picked men
[1:12:44] that's contrary to the Bible That's
[1:12:48] contrary to the message God wants every
[1:12:51] young boy every young girl ever sister
[1:12:54] ever man ever woman ever boy every girl
[1:12:58] to have deity living on the inside of
[1:13:01] them he wants you to be able to speak to
[1:13:04] your enemy and say take your hands off
[1:13:07] of my body take your hands off of my
[1:13:10] child take your hands off of my husband
[1:13:16] oh praise the Lord
[1:13:21] it ain't right friends
[1:13:23] it ain't right
[1:13:25] it ain't pleasing to God that we start
[1:13:28] another thing that's been down Through
[1:13:30] the Ages that we would rally around a
[1:13:33] few special men and so well they're the
[1:13:35] only ones that's got it and everybody
[1:13:36] else just follows them you show me that
[1:13:39] in God's word
[1:13:40] there is no such a thing oh sure God's
[1:13:43] got me that are anointed by the Holy
[1:13:45] Ghost but I'll take one thing if we're
[1:13:47] not careful we're going to get that old
[1:13:48] Nickelodeon thing and everybody's got to
[1:13:51] move here and move that let me tell you
[1:13:52] right now God don't want everybody
[1:13:53] moving to this church God don't want
[1:13:56] everybody moving to brother Tim approach
[1:13:57] church or brother Ron Spencer's shirt or
[1:14:00] brother Ron Peterson's church God wants
[1:14:02] them saying where he put them
[1:14:04] well come on brother Donnie and preach
[1:14:07] amen how we all going to spread our
[1:14:09] light around the world if everybody
[1:14:11] comes here or everybody moves to
[1:14:14] Virginia or everybody moves to Minden
[1:14:16] Louisiana you are supposed to bloom
[1:14:19] where God puts you you're supposed to
[1:14:21] bloom or God sets you out oh I wish
[1:14:24] somebody would preach with me this
[1:14:26] morning God wants you and I to be
[1:14:28] exactly what he's ordained us to be I
[1:14:31] realize a lot of the mega church idea is
[1:14:34] sweeping the message of the last
[1:14:35] statement let me tell you something
[1:14:37] God's going to have preachers at Pastor
[1:14:39] 20 or 30 or 40 and third shifts as
[1:14:42] important in the kingdom of God as the
[1:14:45] biggest church inside the message and we
[1:14:47] don't need to run them down we don't
[1:14:49] need to look down on them but we need to
[1:14:52] recognize God may have some in the inner
[1:14:54] city of Chicago he may have some in
[1:14:57] Houston he may have a little storefront
[1:14:59] here and there and there he don't want
[1:15:01] them all to move over this place or that
[1:15:03] place he wants them to move all right he
[1:15:06] wants them to move deeper in Christ
[1:15:08] Jesus and more follow the Holy Ghost
[1:15:10] more full of the power of God brother
[1:15:13] Donnie do you want a mega church no I
[1:15:15] want a church full of the Holy Ghost I
[1:15:18] want a church full of the power of God I
[1:15:20] don't want to be a mega Pastor I serve a
[1:15:23] mega God we've got a mega message we've
[1:15:26] got a message of the end time that's
[1:15:28] what I want to be a part of I'm not
[1:15:31] interested in having the biggest church
[1:15:33] in the message or the biggest church in
[1:15:36] Johnson City I've got the biggest God in
[1:15:38] the message I've got the biggest God
[1:15:41] hallelujah why would I want a man to be
[1:15:44] my idol
[1:15:54] well Glory
[1:15:56] whoever that was for there you go
[1:15:59] [Applause]
[1:16:07] I want you to listen to this
[1:16:10] said in 1950.
[1:16:14] by the blood of Christ who cleanses us
[1:16:16] from sin we become Sons and Daughters of
[1:16:19] God
[1:16:20] who is God
[1:16:23] the one that stood there and rolled the
[1:16:25] Stars off his hands
[1:16:26] and Rose worlds out of his hands
[1:16:30] made the things which do not appear
[1:16:33] deity
[1:16:35] and deity himself
[1:16:38] lives
[1:16:39] in man
[1:16:41] the Creator that made heavens and earth
[1:16:44] lives in mankind
[1:16:47] notice this 1951 if we become in spirit
[1:16:51] sons of God deity dwells
[1:16:55] and the man
[1:16:57] Hallelujah then you're talking about
[1:17:00] blind eyes being opened they said
[1:17:02] nothing impossible to God
[1:17:04] but God said nothing is impossible with
[1:17:07] you
[1:17:09] now we all believe the first part
[1:17:12] and I wonder how many of us believe the
[1:17:14] second part that he just quoted nothing
[1:17:16] shall be impossible with you
[1:17:20] praise the Lord now you see what we need
[1:17:23] to move up
[1:17:24] now you say why Satan don't want you to
[1:17:26] see this he you know the prophet never
[1:17:28] said oh if the message preachers will
[1:17:30] come to their place and the Rapture will
[1:17:32] go he said if the bride recognizes who
[1:17:35] she is then the Rapture will go it's not
[1:17:38] just me recognizing who I am it's not
[1:17:41] brother down these other ministers
[1:17:43] recognizing who they are you've got to
[1:17:45] recognize Who You Are
[1:17:48] in Christ Jesus notice the very God that
[1:17:51] stood back there on the mystical
[1:17:53] platform of the eternities and rolled
[1:17:56] worlds off of his hands and created
[1:17:58] these things give you the privilege to
[1:18:01] be his son and you're a part of him and
[1:18:04] God dwells in mankind and man himself is
[1:18:09] deity
[1:18:10] Hallelujah there you are it might choke
[1:18:13] you but study over that a little while
[1:18:16] it might choke to you but study over
[1:18:19] that a little while y'all ain't getting
[1:18:20] shout to you all right I ain't got the
[1:18:22] one bottle of Gatorade I got a few more
[1:18:24] in the fridge just raise your hand if
[1:18:25] you need it and I'll help you
[1:18:26] now watch this again in 1954 can you
[1:18:30] imagine 1950
[1:18:32] 1951
[1:18:33] 1954 these statements are being preached
[1:18:37] while a lot of the other men are saying
[1:18:38] now who's got a hundred dollars here
[1:18:40] tonight I need 20 people that'll stand
[1:18:42] with 20. I need this and that and the
[1:18:44] other you need my holy oil you need my
[1:18:46] holy water you need my holy this and
[1:18:49] what was this man standing there saying
[1:18:50] that God himself had come down in the
[1:18:53] form of a human being you see mother
[1:18:55] Branham never left us a college we don't
[1:18:58] have a super highway named after him we
[1:19:01] don't have an interstate or a bridge you
[1:19:03] know you go different places and there's
[1:19:05] bridge is named after Billy Graham and
[1:19:07] there's roads named after Oral Roberts
[1:19:09] and this named after this man and that
[1:19:11] man he didn't leave us a college he
[1:19:13] didn't leave us a road he left us a word
[1:19:15] to get to heaven oh Robert's bridge will
[1:19:18] never help you across eternity Billy
[1:19:21] Graham's bridge over in Nashville will
[1:19:23] never help you get into eternity but the
[1:19:25] message of God given to us by the
[1:19:28] prophet of Malachi 4 will help us span
[1:19:31] the place of time and bring us into
[1:19:34] eternity but not only when we're dying
[1:19:36] but right now it will help us to
[1:19:39] recognize we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:42] Christ
[1:19:44] [Applause]
[1:19:47] oh my deity itself lays in the man
[1:19:51] that's received the Holy Spirit now let
[1:19:54] me go back up here and read this again
[1:19:55] just to give you a little preview of
[1:19:56] where we're going God 's self came down
[1:19:59] into a blood cell
[1:20:02] and rap the blood around him
[1:20:07] so here comes the eternal
[1:20:09] and he grabs a hold of a blood cell that
[1:20:12] he created
[1:20:14] and wrapped himself you're talking about
[1:20:16] humility and big becoming little
[1:20:21] how could the Eternal one grab one blood
[1:20:26] cell that he created
[1:20:28] and wrap himself so small and so small
[1:20:33] and so small and so small and so small
[1:20:43] and he wrapped that blood cell around
[1:20:46] himself
[1:20:48] and got inside the womb
[1:20:50] of Mary
[1:20:56] Mary
[1:20:58] Lord of God that makes me feel like
[1:20:59] running
[1:21:01] the blood cell The Germ of life God
[1:21:04] himself wrapped
[1:21:07] wrapped in this blood cell that brought
[1:21:12] forth the son Christ Jesus how does he
[1:21:14] do by that to make you
[1:21:17] perfect don't you understand white did
[1:21:20] this he wrapped himself in that blood
[1:21:23] cell
[1:21:24] so the sword would pierce the blood cell
[1:21:31] and release
[1:21:33] God
[1:21:39] thank you Lord God
[1:21:42] now what does he do he brings you
[1:21:44] through that blood cell
[1:21:46] into himself
[1:21:48] you get it through the blood cell of the
[1:21:51] Lord Jesus that invales the life of
[1:21:54] Jehovah and we coming through that blood
[1:21:56] cell become a part of that life so deity
[1:22:00] itself
[1:22:02] lays in the man
[1:22:04] that received the Holy Spirit
[1:22:11] don't stop but just coming to church
[1:22:13] don't stop using I believe God said a
[1:22:16] prophet that's good but don't suffer you
[1:22:19] don't get the blood cell by saying I
[1:22:20] believe brother Adam was a prophet of
[1:22:22] God I believe Donald brother Donny's a
[1:22:24] good man I believe this in my home
[1:22:25] Church oh that's good but don't stop
[1:22:27] there there's only one way you get deity
[1:22:30] you got to get inside the blood cell why
[1:22:32] the blood cell held deity the blood cell
[1:22:36] held deity and then thy sword all thy
[1:22:39] spirit that Roman soldier whenever he
[1:22:41] pierced him it broke open the blood cell
[1:22:43] God could wrap himself but God couldn't
[1:22:45] release himself
[1:22:47] God could release himself it had to be
[1:22:50] through that breaking of the blood cell
[1:22:52] through anger through Wrath
[1:22:55] then when he broke it open
[1:23:01] then a little woman comes up a little
[1:23:02] man a drunk a liar heart at a prostitute
[1:23:05] comes through the process of the new
[1:23:07] birth
[1:23:09] oh they know is wretchedness and sin and
[1:23:11] vow their whole life
[1:23:13] and they come through the process of God
[1:23:15] and God changes them
[1:23:16] and God gives them deity
[1:23:23] so deity lays in the man that's received
[1:23:26] the Holy Spirit
[1:23:27] you are a son
[1:23:29] I'm a Branham by birth and a part of Mr
[1:23:33] and Miss Branham is in me and if you
[1:23:37] become a son or daughter of God part of
[1:23:40] deity
[1:23:43] Lays
[1:23:45] and the pastor
[1:23:47] and the great evangelist
[1:23:49] what is it like you tell me
[1:23:57] Hallelujah
[1:23:59] not Christ and the preacher not Christ
[1:24:02] just in the special anointing man of God
[1:24:04] but Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:24:08] brother down why you say this because
[1:24:09] you've got to recognize who you are
[1:24:12] Saints you're not going to overcome but
[1:24:14] we're glory to God Brother Don he's a
[1:24:16] good brother I believe he really loves
[1:24:17] the Lord I appreciate that with all of
[1:24:19] my heart but the devil won't hit you as
[1:24:21] long as you're around me maybe he'll hit
[1:24:23] you when you're by yourself we don't
[1:24:25] want our young people going to ever
[1:24:26] Youth Camp there is and every use
[1:24:28] banquet that there is and shouting and
[1:24:31] running and jumping around and coming
[1:24:32] back was not an ounce of Victory we want
[1:24:35] them to go and get something and bring
[1:24:37] it back home to us we want them to hide
[1:24:40] Victory when they get back when they can
[1:24:43] say glory to God the Lord touched me at
[1:24:45] camp but the touch was lasting it didn't
[1:24:48] last until I just got home and it was
[1:24:50] gone but I got a touch praise the Lord
[1:24:53] and I want to share it with others
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:25:03] notices you see how the devil robs you
[1:25:08] so you can't do this
[1:25:10] all things are possible to them that
[1:25:12] believe
[1:25:14] you are a part of deity
[1:25:20] a son and a daughter why brother
[1:25:24] it surpasses all angels
[1:25:29] archangels
[1:25:31] do you understand if an angel of God
[1:25:33] will share in this place today an angel
[1:25:35] of God could not come here and take my
[1:25:37] iPad and preach what the Lord has given
[1:25:40] me to say to you today
[1:25:42] if rather not one of these other
[1:25:44] brothers the center for preaching today
[1:25:45] that angel would be out of his place to
[1:25:48] walk up there and take that iPad because
[1:25:51] God never committed the preaching of the
[1:25:53] word to Angels God never sent Angels
[1:25:56] down here to lay their hands on the sick
[1:25:59] and anoint you with oil God called his
[1:26:01] men his servants to do the same not only
[1:26:04] men but sometimes a mother might sit
[1:26:06] there and have compassion on a crying
[1:26:09] baby in another mother's arms and light
[1:26:11] her hands on that baby and God hear that
[1:26:14] Mother's Prayer
[1:26:17] but of course
[1:26:19] if we can get our eyes off of us
[1:26:22] and just put it on this special man that
[1:26:24] one this special pastor this special man
[1:26:27] here then what do we all do we fall
[1:26:30] right back in the same so my the same
[1:26:33] slump that we were in before the message
[1:26:36] that it was all about the Great Men the
[1:26:39] great man this and the Great Men die let
[1:26:41] me tell you something there'd be no need
[1:26:42] for Great Men if there wasn't some great
[1:26:44] people for him to preach to
[1:26:51] yeah
[1:26:52] I could dismiss you all right now okay
[1:26:56] stop my sermon for the pause dismiss all
[1:26:59] of you
[1:27:00] and try to resume it
[1:27:03] we'll see how well it goes over in these
[1:27:05] nice chairs
[1:27:06] whenever we were shut down for coven I
[1:27:10] can tell you it was one of the hardest
[1:27:11] times I've ever preached in my life
[1:27:14] wasn't brother Daryl it was so difficult
[1:27:17] the words are the same the scriptures
[1:27:21] were the same the quotes were the same
[1:27:23] what was missing you all
[1:27:27] you see it's not the preacher that makes
[1:27:30] it work it's not the musicians alone
[1:27:32] that makes it work it's the body
[1:27:36] it's the body
[1:27:38] oh I want you to come up for prayer I
[1:27:41] want you to come when we have evangelism
[1:27:43] I didn't brother Timothy do an awesome
[1:27:44] job here Wednesday night and God moved
[1:27:47] for many of you but the point I want you
[1:27:49] to get here you don't want to just be
[1:27:51] touched when a special man prays for you
[1:27:54] but you want something that whenever
[1:27:56] that man's gone home and he's a thousand
[1:27:59] miles away from you that you know where
[1:28:01] you stand because you've got that same
[1:28:03] God living inside of you
[1:28:10] oh my
[1:28:12] it surpasses all Angels archangels
[1:28:16] everything else it comes right into the
[1:28:19] presence of the Potter himself
[1:28:22] and how are we brought through the blood
[1:28:24] then you come into deity
[1:28:28] and you become a part
[1:28:31] you're welded in
[1:28:35] ah you're welded in
[1:28:38] you see there's a lot of difference of
[1:28:40] being welded in and stuck in
[1:28:43] some folks get stuck in from one meeting
[1:28:45] to the other they get stuck in here and
[1:28:47] then they pull out and then they're
[1:28:48] stuck in there but once you're welded in
[1:28:51] you're good to go I'll tell you one
[1:28:53] thing when the Holy Ghost wears you into
[1:28:55] the body a life for the devil to try to
[1:28:58] come and bring his cutting torch and cut
[1:28:59] me out I ended up devils in hell to cut
[1:29:03] me out of the body well praise the Lord
[1:29:04] I ain't just talking about me I'm
[1:29:06] talking about you young men I'm talking
[1:29:08] about you sisters that have got the Holy
[1:29:10] Ghost the Lord God himself well did you
[1:29:13] into the body of Christ there's not
[1:29:15] enough sickness there's not enough
[1:29:17] demons there's not enough power there's
[1:29:20] not enough of anything that Satan can do
[1:29:23] to pull you out of the body of Christ
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:33] let's think of God
[1:29:35] folding around him now
[1:29:38] we're going to enlarge it billions of
[1:29:41] times from this blood cell
[1:29:43] and their God in this blood cell folded
[1:29:46] himself up
[1:29:50] so God just folds himself and just
[1:29:53] shrinks down
[1:29:55] to something so small
[1:29:58] you'd have to have a microscope
[1:30:00] to see it
[1:30:02] you see man cannot humble himself to
[1:30:05] that place
[1:30:06] man all the time is one to be bigger and
[1:30:09] greater and greater and more and more
[1:30:11] and more
[1:30:12] and God folded himself and folded don't
[1:30:15] you understand why the prophet called it
[1:30:17] a slowly unfolded mystery
[1:30:21] why because it was folded
[1:30:24] God folded and wrapped himself in the
[1:30:28] blood cell notice what he says wrapped
[1:30:31] himself in this blood cell and come to
[1:30:33] redeem Man's Alive Hallelujah there when
[1:30:35] the blood shall spread out
[1:30:37] spread out and brought the body Christ
[1:30:41] Jesus Jehovah himself was tabernacled in
[1:30:45] him that through the bursting of the
[1:30:49] blood cell
[1:30:51] at Calvary
[1:30:53] now look it's not enough for us to look
[1:30:56] at the chemistry
[1:30:58] and think we're in because we believe on
[1:31:01] the chemistry
[1:31:02] you've got to tap into the unfolding of
[1:31:06] the life
[1:31:09] notice he says again that God might
[1:31:13] bring sons and
[1:31:16] to himself in the blood so the cell of
[1:31:20] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ unto
[1:31:22] himself and we become a part of God
[1:31:24] that's what makes Satan mad
[1:31:28] oh praise the Lord I don't know about
[1:31:31] you but it is part of my reason on the
[1:31:34] earth is to make Satan mad I absolutely
[1:31:38] love tying that dude up I absolutely
[1:31:40] love making him mad oh I tell you he'll
[1:31:43] make you pay later but it's always fun
[1:31:44] while you're in the middle of it I love
[1:31:46] making him mad I love stirring him up I
[1:31:49] love stirring hell up and you know what
[1:31:52] I've ran I've danced I've shouted I've
[1:31:54] jumped and all that is good but right
[1:31:56] here is what makes the devil mad brother
[1:31:58] when we become a part of God it's easy
[1:32:02] when I've stood under the anointing of
[1:32:03] the Holy Ghost and command demons to
[1:32:06] come out of people and watch them come
[1:32:07] out of there and that thing head towards
[1:32:09] you oh Lord have mercy and that thing
[1:32:11] come back and try to haunt you remember
[1:32:12] brother man I'm talking about them
[1:32:14] demons he would cast them out at night
[1:32:16] and they would come in the hotel room
[1:32:18] where he was and he would hear chains
[1:32:20] rattling all night long and they would
[1:32:22] come and rub their flesh up against his
[1:32:25] oh my you better know where he stand
[1:32:28] whenever you're good or doing that sort
[1:32:29] of thing now notice but what do we want
[1:32:32] we want deity that indwells in us that
[1:32:35] when we feel absolutely nothing when the
[1:32:39] anointing is not around and the song
[1:32:41] leader ain't around and the preacher
[1:32:43] ain't around we can stand right there
[1:32:45] and say I ain't backing up devil
[1:32:50] phew
[1:32:52] that's what makes Satan mad that's what
[1:32:55] shapes him oh Lord have mercy wouldn't
[1:32:58] you love to see the devil just sitting
[1:32:59] around shaking
[1:33:04] I think I wouldn't see me shake
[1:33:09] and the demon said what's the matter
[1:33:11] devil what's the matter you're the king
[1:33:13] what's the matter oh that little woman
[1:33:15] got down on her knees to pray again oh
[1:33:17] Lord no not her oh what what in the
[1:33:21] world was going on it's that little boy
[1:33:22] he ain't about 14 years old but that
[1:33:24] little boy's got deity on the inside of
[1:33:26] him every time he goes to friend I get
[1:33:28] All Shook Up
[1:33:29] what a testimony to have what a
[1:33:32] testimony of the house that the devil
[1:33:34] gets all torn up and you go to praying
[1:33:42] oh you say
[1:33:44] I know there is nothing impossible with
[1:33:46] God
[1:33:49] he said
[1:33:52] there is nothing impossible
[1:33:54] to you
[1:33:57] I need help
[1:34:00] and he'd help
[1:34:07] now we are sons of God
[1:34:09] deity itself
[1:34:12] lives
[1:34:14] every
[1:34:19] every man that's born of the spirit of
[1:34:21] God is a part of God no wonder he
[1:34:23] believes in the Supernatural
[1:34:25] no wonder he can believe in anything why
[1:34:28] is it in him as a portion of God wrapped
[1:34:32] up in that mortal body oh
[1:34:35] here's that same word
[1:34:38] a portion of God now is wrapped up
[1:34:42] in your body
[1:34:46] now once you listen this I know some of
[1:34:48] the message folks Senator he choked to
[1:34:50] death and saw their tongue on the rest
[1:34:51] of this quote but I'm going to read it
[1:34:52] anyway
[1:34:54] oh Lord in him is a portion of God
[1:34:57] wrapped up in that mortal body
[1:35:00] with their sin
[1:35:02] everything else
[1:35:07] down in there some work of God Alone
[1:35:12] in regeneration
[1:35:15] this is my right brother Steve it's your
[1:35:18] right my brother
[1:35:20] it's your right my brothers and sisters
[1:35:22] for deity
[1:35:24] to embody itself and for you to become
[1:35:27] its shrine
[1:35:29] it's Temple
[1:35:34] don't just say kind words to Saints
[1:35:38] don't just try to be nice to Saints
[1:35:41] say a kind word to the woman at the
[1:35:43] Walmart that says my got the temperament
[1:35:45] of a porcupine
[1:35:49] foreign
[1:35:52] all day long because the rest of the
[1:35:54] world is out here about the same way
[1:35:55] they are you know I'm talking about
[1:35:57] people ain't got time to be kind no more
[1:35:59] and some of the Christians it's a sad
[1:36:01] thing to think well I can only be kind
[1:36:03] to them but my own kind I try to be kind
[1:36:05] to every Mortal life and be kind to
[1:36:06] because it might be the only kindness
[1:36:08] they get the entire rest of the week I
[1:36:11] want to let my light shine I want to let
[1:36:13] them know I don't want them to know I'm
[1:36:14] a preacher I don't go around packing a
[1:36:16] Bible an iPad and dressed up in a suit
[1:36:18] you know I hate a suit and you think God
[1:36:20] ain't got a sense of humor I got her
[1:36:21] death step in a suit and I hate it soon
[1:36:23] but I don't go around packing a Bible to
[1:36:25] you know and Dr so-and-so and this and
[1:36:28] that and the other but I packed Jesus
[1:36:30] everywhere I go why I am his Temple I'm
[1:36:34] his Temple when I got my blue jeans on
[1:36:36] I'm as simple when I got on my
[1:36:38] comfortable shoes I'm as simple when
[1:36:40] I've got on a t-shirt I am his Temple
[1:36:43] when I'm in Walmart I'm his Temple when
[1:36:45] I'm in Lowe's I'm his Temple everywhere
[1:36:47] I go and I want to let the deity inside
[1:36:51] at the temple shine out
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:37:01] if you're alive tile is up to the life
[1:37:04] of Jesus Christ that is
[1:37:07] he said in his word there if you'll say
[1:37:10] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:37:12] doubt but believe it's coming to pass
[1:37:15] you can have
[1:37:18] what you say
[1:37:25] can't you see why Satan wants to take
[1:37:27] this off and put it on just preachers
[1:37:30] then you don't have to produce this
[1:37:33] that's why I've got brother Tony I said
[1:37:35] I've got brother Timothy brother George
[1:37:37] Brown that's why we've got these other
[1:37:38] brothers around you know well my
[1:37:39] goodness I can't do that I'm just an
[1:37:41] ordinary I'm just an ordinary human and
[1:37:43] what do you figure I am
[1:37:49] lays wings no
[1:37:51] no there ain't no wings under I can tell
[1:37:53] you
[1:37:54] more like horns sometimes
[1:37:57] but don't sit there and look at me you a
[1:37:58] bunch of you all got the same
[1:37:59] thing that I have oh y'all might want to
[1:38:02] come and act like you're so holy and
[1:38:03] soul pastures rotten stinking low down
[1:38:05] no good as every other Mortal on the
[1:38:07] earth just archives it would for the
[1:38:09] grace of God entertain water in the
[1:38:10] world would be this morning may be out
[1:38:12] there hanging or some type of Hangover
[1:38:14] the night before or laying dead because
[1:38:16] we overdosed on some sort of drug but
[1:38:19] here we are sitting in the presence of
[1:38:21] Jesus Christ at hearing his word and
[1:38:24] saying amen why are we different because
[1:38:26] deity itself Tabernacles in our body
[1:38:30] that must act like it let's act like we
[1:38:33] are the Temple of the lord we are the
[1:38:36] shrine of God we are the edifice of the
[1:38:41] last days
[1:38:42] [Applause]
[1:38:46] I mean he's got some mountains in front
[1:38:48] of you today
[1:38:51] me too
[1:38:53] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:38:55] don't doubt
[1:38:57] but believe that it's coming to pass
[1:39:02] you can have what you say and he repeats
[1:39:04] it what you say and the only way you
[1:39:07] could move that mountain
[1:39:10] would have to be
[1:39:12] deity
[1:39:14] speak
[1:39:16] I've got to be honest with you I've
[1:39:17] quoted the word many a time and nothing
[1:39:19] happened absolutely not one thing
[1:39:23] I might as well have quoted Hamlet
[1:39:25] I might as well quoted Shakespeare how
[1:39:27] about as well quoted you know some great
[1:39:29] poet as far as material physical
[1:39:31] evidence happening whenever I said it
[1:39:34] how much ever been there and done that
[1:39:35] well you need this and there's a glory
[1:39:37] to God I'm going to be bold hallelujah
[1:39:39] look out devil here I come he'll abide
[1:39:41] me and my words by you ask what you are
[1:39:43] I'm asking right now in the name of
[1:39:44] Jesus this certain certain thing happens
[1:39:56] here
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:01] we have to keep believing
[1:40:04] he didn't say what happened right then
[1:40:07] maybe a little grain of sand on the
[1:40:09] other side of that mountain when you
[1:40:11] spoke when tumbling right now nobody
[1:40:13] ever saw it it was so little even the
[1:40:16] devil didn't pay no attention that's to
[1:40:17] his demise too and if God did it out of
[1:40:20] your sight and then tomorrow another
[1:40:22] rock fell and another rock fell and I
[1:40:25] know well there comes a song and another
[1:40:27] rock fell and another rock fell as I
[1:40:30] spoke his word another rock fell and
[1:40:34] another rock fell as I believed his word
[1:40:39] hallelujah hallelujah it may be a week
[1:40:42] it may be a month it might be a year and
[1:40:45] on the other side of the mountain it's
[1:40:47] done half gone but where you're looking
[1:40:49] at it oh no come on
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:58] the only way you could move that
[1:41:00] mountain
[1:41:02] would have to be dear to speak
[1:41:04] when you're a Son of God you receive God
[1:41:08] which is Zoe
[1:41:10] God's own life
[1:41:13] and you become
[1:41:15] a part of God
[1:41:18] okay I'm not very smart don't y'all say
[1:41:20] Amen to that inner
[1:41:22] so dogs begat
[1:41:26] cats beget
[1:41:28] s horses beget
[1:41:32] and if God ever gave birth
[1:41:36] are you Brazen and bold enough to say so
[1:41:39] if God ever came first what would God
[1:41:42] give birth
[1:41:46] you got the cab Parts you got the dog
[1:41:48] parts you got the horse part
[1:41:50] why is it so hard it's this it wants to
[1:41:54] keep us back from acknowledging what's
[1:41:57] inside of us
[1:42:01] but brother Donnie if you only lived
[1:42:03] with me
[1:42:04] you might not say that well that's true
[1:42:07] but I do live with me
[1:42:12] I do live with me and I know how I am as
[1:42:15] a mortal I get afraid
[1:42:18] I get fearful
[1:42:19] when things are said or this or that or
[1:42:22] the other I get fearful as a man
[1:42:25] say you yes let me go a little further
[1:42:28] and tell you according to the book of
[1:42:29] Hebrews the Lord Jesus feared
[1:42:32] deity in a human Temple does not
[1:42:36] eliminate all fear but it gives you a
[1:42:38] peace to help calm it down
[1:42:41] it's a human reaction whenever you hear
[1:42:43] a bad news or a bad doctors report or
[1:42:45] whatever more and immediately an
[1:42:48] immediate response takes place in your
[1:42:50] flesh you know what I'm talking about
[1:42:52] you care about bad news you get a phone
[1:42:53] call oh my your husband's been in a
[1:42:55] wreck oh Lord Oh Lord oh no no no God no
[1:42:58] no don't take him don't take him of
[1:42:59] course I guess it depends on what kind
[1:43:01] of husband he said oh Lord thank you
[1:43:02] thank you thank you God
[1:43:08] and you start texting me brother Donnie
[1:43:09] prepare the funeral service
[1:43:14] but after that him
[1:43:17] what happens
[1:43:18] for my sin
[1:43:20] deity
[1:43:25] did not I tell you I would never leave
[1:43:27] you
[1:43:33] I would never forsake you
[1:43:35] haven't I been with you this far
[1:43:39] why not I'll take you the rest of the
[1:43:41] way through
[1:43:42] children aren't you glad for that
[1:43:45] I see why people I hear drink I see why
[1:43:48] they dope I see why they do what they do
[1:43:51] there ain't no telling what we would be
[1:43:53] if it wasn't for him and our triple but
[1:43:57] now what would we be woman we wind up
[1:43:59] being in this crazy world but we have
[1:44:02] deity enthroned in our bodies
[1:44:09] notice this
[1:44:10] to be a Christian you must be
[1:44:12] christ-like
[1:44:15] tabernacling
[1:44:17] deity in you
[1:44:19] with the Holy Ghost notice
[1:44:22] light fell
[1:44:25] on the day of Pentecost
[1:44:27] you mean the message Holy Ghost
[1:44:30] it's the same one that Peter and them
[1:44:32] had
[1:44:33] I may believe that
[1:44:38] same power
[1:44:41] do the same things
[1:44:42] same works
[1:44:44] well they acted like drunk people can
[1:44:47] they do the same thing to us
[1:44:50] heal the sent raise the Dead cast out
[1:44:53] devils
[1:44:55] oh why is there so many messages people
[1:44:57] don't believe that
[1:44:58] and they'll try to make you 1906
[1:45:01] Pentecost If You Preach them when their
[1:45:03] own Prophet that they say they believed
[1:45:06] said this
[1:45:11] oh my
[1:45:12] what's a holy ghost I fell on the day of
[1:45:15] Pentecost not some emotion but I mean a
[1:45:19] real Pentecostal
[1:45:22] that's right
[1:45:23] I've never believed that the Holy Ghost
[1:45:26] was shaking
[1:45:29] I've never believed that the Holy Ghost
[1:45:31] evidence of speaking in tongues or
[1:45:34] crying or shouting
[1:45:36] them's emotional Sensations
[1:45:39] I believe the Holy Ghost can do that
[1:45:47] that's when you're supposed to say Amen
[1:45:51] I believe the Holy Ghost can do that
[1:45:55] but the Holy Ghost
[1:45:58] is tabernacling
[1:46:02] some of you ain't never shout in your
[1:46:04] life and some of you probably ain't
[1:46:06] going to shout some of you seen shouters
[1:46:10] some of these criers
[1:46:11] I don't think I ever seen brother Jim
[1:46:13] Babb Shout I was waiting for many many
[1:46:15] years
[1:46:16] but I'd watch him as he said over here
[1:46:18] to my right
[1:46:19] and whenever the word some of y'all were
[1:46:21] shouting and jumping he said they're
[1:46:23] just
[1:46:25] tears is born out and maybe I'll talk to
[1:46:28] him the next day or the next step
[1:46:29] brother Donnie I just had to tell you
[1:46:30] that that there was sober and he was
[1:46:32] ecstatic wilder than a Timbuktu Indian
[1:46:35] and wasn't he moving out of his seat
[1:46:40] but you see we begin to sing well in
[1:46:42] order to be spiritual you've got to be
[1:46:44] this way that way I would start making a
[1:46:46] mold of what we think everybody ought to
[1:46:48] feel you understand what you're doing
[1:46:49] you're making an organization
[1:46:52] I don't care if you don't run like
[1:46:54] brother Daryl me and Kevin was talking
[1:46:55] about the other day she said Donnie do
[1:46:57] you really believe that Jesus preached
[1:46:59] like you I said I don't
[1:47:02] I say I don't believe Jesus preached out
[1:47:04] brother Daryl
[1:47:06] I don't think Jesus preached out brother
[1:47:07] Ron and I name some different emotional
[1:47:09] preachers I don't believe Jesus preached
[1:47:11] like that the Bible says that in one
[1:47:12] place that Jesus set down and opened his
[1:47:15] mouth and those words that flowed out of
[1:47:17] his mouth
[1:47:18] so when we think he was anointed
[1:47:21] why because we tend to think the
[1:47:23] anointing is movement and emotion no the
[1:47:26] anointing will move on our emotions and
[1:47:28] make us emotional but that don't mean
[1:47:31] it's the Holy Ghost doing he looks and
[1:47:32] I've seen folks do all kinds of coins on
[1:47:34] and live with somebody else's wife that
[1:47:36] don't mean it's a Holy Ghost
[1:47:40] Brother Don don't you believe thy with
[1:47:42] all of my heart
[1:47:44] and I don't want you just to be
[1:47:46] emotional I want you to Tabernacle
[1:47:50] deity
[1:47:53] so when the emotion cannot be found and
[1:47:56] you feel like you're about to lose your
[1:47:59] mind
[1:48:01] you can speak from your soul and say
[1:48:04] Satan
[1:48:06] you will not defeat me
[1:48:12] Hallelujah
[1:48:19] people get worked up and excited emotion
[1:48:23] it's not the Holy Ghost
[1:48:26] the Holy Ghost is tabernacling
[1:48:28] deity
[1:48:30] got a few more minutes
[1:48:32] when a spirit born
[1:48:35] Spirit-filled man
[1:48:37] in faith
[1:48:39] takes
[1:48:41] that word into his heart
[1:48:43] and places it on his lips I want you to
[1:48:46] notice your part in this
[1:48:49] you have to take this word
[1:48:52] Or Glory
[1:48:54] place it in your heart
[1:48:57] notice a man's Spirit-filled man takes
[1:49:00] the word into his heart
[1:49:04] and places it on his lips
[1:49:07] God ain't doing this part
[1:49:09] this is your part in my part
[1:49:12] so I take the word into my heart a sink
[1:49:14] a study on it I think about it oh yes
[1:49:18] then when the time is right I place it
[1:49:22] on my lips
[1:49:23] I don't mind telling you that's the
[1:49:25] scary part for me
[1:49:27] I don't get scared whether I read these
[1:49:29] quotes I'm not sitting there reading
[1:49:30] them this morning I thought Lord have
[1:49:31] mercy I about how to spell just sitting
[1:49:33] there studying looking at I don't get
[1:49:35] scared on that but now for me facing a
[1:49:38] need I think something that's pressing
[1:49:40] against me to be able to take it from my
[1:49:42] heart that I've committed to
[1:49:44] move it from here
[1:49:46] to up here and say
[1:49:48] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:49:52] amen I
[1:49:57] I uh
[1:50:00] I'm gonna get my phone I'm gonna call
[1:50:02] Brother Daryl and I'm gonna ask brother
[1:50:03] Daryl
[1:50:04] if he will uh pray for me
[1:50:07] uh I'm gonna I'm gonna call uh I'm gonna
[1:50:10] I'm gonna send brother to my brother on
[1:50:13] text because we're on a three-way chat
[1:50:15] I'm going to send them a text
[1:50:17] and tell them that I need a word from
[1:50:18] the Lord
[1:50:19] and I've got something in my way this
[1:50:22] morning and I didn't need to move the
[1:50:23] out of my way and asked them if they
[1:50:25] would feel led to
[1:50:26] say it for me
[1:50:32] boy it's hot in here this morning
[1:50:36] or is it just me
[1:50:40] but when a man can take the word into
[1:50:42] his heart
[1:50:43] and place it
[1:50:47] place it when he says
[1:50:51] why that is the same
[1:50:55] deity
[1:50:57] speaking
[1:51:02] but you see we've all seen people do
[1:51:04] that that was wrong
[1:51:07] maybe asked a few times
[1:51:09] we've tried to take that word here and
[1:51:11] speak and I said glory to God I feel not
[1:51:13] only in the name of Jesus
[1:51:18] and we messed up
[1:51:21] so then the next time it makes a little
[1:51:23] bit harder because I think
[1:51:24] I might mess up again I don't want to
[1:51:26] bring reproach on the Lord I don't want
[1:51:28] to bring her approach on the word
[1:51:30] I guess I'll just hold my face exactly
[1:51:32] what Satan wants you to do
[1:51:34] today to where you store it in your
[1:51:36] heart and sometimes your heart feels
[1:51:38] like it's about to explode
[1:51:42] but you just keep it right there
[1:51:48] how many knows what I'm talking about
[1:51:51] maybe some of you are sitting here today
[1:51:52] and you have never been where you are
[1:51:55] you need a word from God so desperately
[1:52:00] you need something from him so desperate
[1:52:06] and he may use a preacher yeah I believe
[1:52:08] the Lord sent brother Timothy your life
[1:52:10] Wednesday to speak to us don't you you
[1:52:12] remember that scripture that he read
[1:52:13] there said the lord gave him that
[1:52:14] scripture for us how fitting it was
[1:52:17] I believe the Lord did that don't you
[1:52:20] it didn't take hard in no courage at all
[1:52:22] for me to sit right there beside my wife
[1:52:23] and say Amen whenever he said it I just
[1:52:26] said amen praise the Lord thank you Lord
[1:52:28] Jesus for sending that word but now what
[1:52:30] if God anoints me to say a word to you
[1:52:33] this morning
[1:52:35] and I have to speak it before hundreds
[1:52:37] that are here and thousands that are
[1:52:39] streaming
[1:52:42] ah would I get nervous I mean sweating
[1:52:45] bullets
[1:52:47] I'm talking about missiles I go to
[1:52:49] sweating missiles
[1:52:50] so what if God anoints you to come and
[1:52:52] give me a word
[1:52:54] brother Donnie I don't know what you're
[1:52:56] going through but the Lord told me when
[1:52:57] I was sitting there it's going to be all
[1:52:59] right brother don't fear God's going to
[1:53:02] move for you
[1:53:06] well Hallelujah the longer I go the
[1:53:09] quieter you all get
[1:53:12] friends don't you see why we need help
[1:53:15] I better would admit it Lord I need help
[1:53:17] I need help moving this word from my
[1:53:20] heart
[1:53:21] to my mouse
[1:53:25] why it's the same as deity speaking
[1:53:28] listen what what this type of an
[1:53:30] individual what is equipped with
[1:53:33] Every Mountain has to go
[1:53:37] Satan
[1:53:39] cannot stand
[1:53:42] before that man by the way
[1:53:47] I'm at a sister with long hair and long
[1:53:50] dresses and the brother cut through his
[1:53:51] hair and the brothers thank God don't
[1:53:52] wear dresses to our church a mini skirts
[1:53:54] and thank the Lord I'm glad they don't
[1:53:55] do that because I'd hate to throw them
[1:53:56] out on their head
[1:54:00] that's all well and good but what about
[1:54:02] this
[1:54:04] don't nobody
[1:54:06] don't nobody
[1:54:07] what this part too
[1:54:11] or you're gonna go around every day
[1:54:12] doing this no
[1:54:14] some of you may do it once in your life
[1:54:18] some of you may do it a half a dozen
[1:54:19] times
[1:54:20] but that one time you speak it it might
[1:54:23] be to a backslider
[1:54:25] and you may be packing life that'll
[1:54:27] bring them back to complete restoration
[1:54:32] it may be that God but use a little a
[1:54:34] little personal laymember and anoint
[1:54:36] them to write a card to to one of these
[1:54:39] ministers here that's gone this such a
[1:54:40] terrible time
[1:54:41] and God but to use you as brother
[1:54:44] Timothy mentioned the other night about
[1:54:45] the card and the thing that he had
[1:54:47] received and it was already in the
[1:54:48] mailbox he's waiting for him to go down
[1:54:49] and get it
[1:54:51] and God may use you to encourage a man
[1:54:53] of God that was feeling like he was
[1:54:55] wasting his time and you're saying well
[1:54:57] I ain't nobody I ain't nobody the spirit
[1:54:59] of God moves on your heart to send me a
[1:55:00] card send it spirited God moves on your
[1:55:03] heart to send me an email of
[1:55:04] encouragement a text of encouragement
[1:55:06] send it because God Alone knows what I'm
[1:55:08] going through he said Nate's on your
[1:55:10] heart to send on these other ministers
[1:55:12] you send it because God may use your
[1:55:15] very handwriting or your texting to
[1:55:17] bring a little bit of joy to help me
[1:55:20] through that difficult time that I'm
[1:55:21] going through but if everybody says well
[1:55:24] I'm nothing
[1:55:26] and I ain't nobody so
[1:55:29] I don't know brother Don even knows my
[1:55:31] name
[1:55:32] I don't know if it mean anything to him
[1:55:34] or not if he got a card for me let me
[1:55:36] tell you something friend if God told
[1:55:37] you to do it it wouldn't mean everything
[1:55:39] to me
[1:55:40] why God LED you to speak something to me
[1:55:49] let me close every Mountain has to go
[1:55:53] Satan cannot stand before
[1:55:57] that man
[1:56:00] understand
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:16] praise the Lord
[1:56:19] I wonder how many people are standing
[1:56:21] here today
[1:56:23] with deity
[1:56:25] inside their bodies
[1:56:28] the same one who wrapped himself up in
[1:56:30] that blood cell
[1:56:32] that's out wrapped himself up in yours
[1:56:35] in your body in your temple
[1:56:39] and he's wanting to get out not to leave
[1:56:42] you but so that he can express himself
[1:56:45] to others
[1:56:48] you won't have to worry about preaching
[1:56:49] most of you ain't going to you don't
[1:56:51] have to worry about signing up
[1:56:52] prophesying oh but I'm afraid God will
[1:56:54] embarrass me no no don't worry about God
[1:56:56] will never ask you to do something that
[1:56:58] he's not called you and gifted you to do
[1:56:59] if God's called you he's gifted you to
[1:57:02] be able to do it
[1:57:04] but it will take that pulsation of Faith
[1:57:06] but I said aren't you go around speaking
[1:57:08] all the time I don't why same reason you
[1:57:11] don't I don't want to be wrong
[1:57:14] I've seen enough in my life where people
[1:57:17] said the Lord told me this and thus
[1:57:18] saith the Lord and the Lord said that
[1:57:19] and the Lord said that
[1:57:21] and you you see by the fruit of it that
[1:57:23] is not God and God Don't Lie and God
[1:57:27] don't never tell us nothing to break his
[1:57:28] word so what does that tend to do
[1:57:30] brother Jackie tends to make us more
[1:57:33] afraid
[1:57:34] don't it because we don't want to bring
[1:57:36] no reproach on Christ or his word
[1:57:41] but if this quote is never going to be
[1:57:44] fulfilled
[1:57:45] I don't understand why
[1:57:47] it was ever allowed to be placed
[1:57:50] in the church age book
[1:57:53] and what Jesus said in John is never
[1:57:55] going to come to pass in our generation
[1:57:57] and we're or the continuation of that
[1:57:58] Apostolic age I don't say why Jesus did
[1:58:01] not put a time limit on that and say
[1:58:04] this will only be good for the first
[1:58:06] three or four Church ages after that
[1:58:09] they will see so much flesh and so much
[1:58:11] error that they'll become so nervous I
[1:58:14] will invalidate this scripture from say
[1:58:16] 606 A.D onto the end of the rapture
[1:58:20] I just can't believe that
[1:58:24] it's either true or it's not true
[1:58:30] how many believes it's all true
[1:58:33] how many beliefs you know where the
[1:58:34] problem is
[1:58:38] I don't put your finger at me now
[1:58:39] because I'm not your problem
[1:58:44] but don't point it over at her
[1:58:47] but Rob you came porn it's yours because
[1:58:49] she ain't here today
[1:58:50] she's streaming hard he spawned her on
[1:58:52] the camera
[1:58:54] where's the problem
[1:58:56] the 10 where is it right here
[1:59:07] this is prayer
[1:59:12] oh Jesus
[1:59:16] I'm so sorry
[1:59:20] I'm so sorry
[1:59:24] our old flesh
[1:59:26] our own Humanity
[1:59:31] I mentioned it to you for decades of my
[1:59:33] life I don't know why
[1:59:35] you ever even call me in the first place
[1:59:39] I'm a poor excuse of a Preacher
[1:59:43] I'm a poor excuse of a leader
[1:59:46] I don't know why you'd even fool with me
[1:59:51] we look at ourselves today and we thank
[1:59:53] Lord why in the world
[1:59:55] would you even want us
[1:59:58] some of these men could stand here today
[2:00:00] said Lord why would you even give me
[2:00:02] Grace
[2:00:03] even after you saved me I've messed up
[2:00:05] so bad
[2:00:07] I've done so much stupid stuff Lord in
[2:00:09] life they might say
[2:00:12] but yet you chose
[2:00:15] to wrap yourself
[2:00:18] in our flesh
[2:00:21] oh God
[2:00:23] what a gift
[2:00:26] love divide
[2:00:29] from the heart of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:32] straight into man
[2:00:36] deity Untold
[2:00:38] through the Mysteries unfold
[2:00:42] the great power of God
[2:00:45] and this Earth as we tried
[2:00:48] the almighty himself
[2:00:51] will become one of us
[2:00:54] to give us his life
[2:00:58] Hallelujah
[2:00:59] an end well in US
[2:01:03] not another God
[2:01:06] but the same
[2:01:08] same power the same works
[2:01:11] and the very same name
[2:01:14] that immortality might Embrace a
[2:01:17] creature of time
[2:01:19] and take us Beyond natural substance
[2:01:23] into the sublime
[2:01:26] that the Eternal one
[2:01:28] condensed sinned and wrapping a blood
[2:01:31] cell
[2:01:33] that he would deliver my soul
[2:01:36] from the power of hell
[2:01:39] Hallelujah
[2:01:42] and here we are today with that same
[2:01:46] deity power
[2:01:48] living in US
[2:01:50] and reigning in this hour
[2:01:54] making us to be what his word has said
[2:01:58] and declared to be and manifested and
[2:02:03] read
[2:02:04] what others will scoff at and truly make
[2:02:08] fun
[2:02:09] yet with this in our souls this race
[2:02:13] we must run
[2:02:15] for it is not ourself
[2:02:18] it is not our ability
[2:02:21] but deity himself
[2:02:24] living in US
[2:02:27] oh Hallelujah
[2:02:30] who are we that love divine
[2:02:33] would so strike our souls in a moment of
[2:02:38] time
[2:02:39] that the Eternal would embody
[2:02:42] himself and our flesh
[2:02:45] and give us of his deity
[2:02:48] that we be embraced
[2:02:52] and soon he will come
[2:02:55] and take us away
[2:02:57] to that blessed place
[2:03:00] that he said there that day
[2:03:02] I go to prepare a place there for you
[2:03:07] and if I go and do it children
[2:03:10] I will come after you
[2:03:13] for I will take you to my place so far
[2:03:17] away

[2:03:21] vanish away

[2:03:27] and look up to the sky
[2:03:29] for soon and very soon

[2:09:42] come through this building today and
[2:09:43] Lord some of the greatest needs are not
[2:09:46] even of people that are here but those
[2:09:48] that don't even feel like being here
[2:09:49] today but in the name of Jesus may you
[2:09:52] walk into their bedroom right now father
[2:09:54] May the angel of God visit their
[2:09:57] neighborhood they're called a sack you

[2:10:01] know where they live in the name of
[2:10:03] Jesus May the spirit of God go to them
[2:10:06] right now father as your children we
[2:10:09] declare it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:10:12] we're not speaking anything out of term
[2:10:14] because the Bible tells us by your
[2:10:17] stripes they have already been healed in
[2:10:21] the name of Jesus May their faith rise
[2:10:23] to that level and may our faith rise to
[2:10:26] the level that we can say you are a
[2:10:30] Healer and he believes he's a miracle
[2:10:33] worker
[2:10:34] Hallelujah I woke up early this morning
[2:10:37] before daylight
[2:10:39] hearing the words to this song
[2:10:42] he's still doing
[2:10:44] miracles
[2:10:46] today
[2:10:48] I heard it over and over again
[2:10:51] I went back to sleep
[2:10:53] woke up a couple hours later
[2:10:56] still before they left
[2:10:58] and I heard the words again
[2:11:00] he's still doing Miracles today
[2:11:05] he's still doing Miracles today
[2:11:09] anybody can say it with me he's still
[2:11:12] doing Miracles today well he said
[2:11:15] brother Donnie I don't need one today
[2:11:16] well hang on to it because you might
[2:11:18] need one tomorrow
[2:11:19] and if you don't need one tomorrow you
[2:11:21] might need a Tuesday or Wednesday I
[2:11:23] guarantee you one day before we leave
[2:11:24] this place I figure we're going to need
[2:11:26] more than we've ever needed in our life
[2:11:28] I don't know what you're expecting for
[2:11:30] the end time I'm expecting to see our
[2:11:32] God move among us our Prophet told us
[2:11:35] that there was coming a time when
[2:11:37] missing limbs would be restored oh you
[2:11:40] said that can't be I believe it was all
[2:11:43] of my heart I believe our God why so he
[2:11:46] can prove that I'm something these
[2:11:47] preachers are something no I'll tell you
[2:11:49] right up front we are nothing we are
[2:11:52] nothing we are absolutely human vessels
[2:11:55] if God wants to use it for that that's
[2:11:57] fine he's the only one that deserves the
[2:12:00] praise he's the one that deserves the
[2:12:02] credit I think we ought to enter in
[2:12:04] these doors under such anticipation that
[2:12:07] we think what is God going to do today
[2:12:09] what is God going to do here Wednesday
[2:12:11] night all my the only thing that hinders
[2:12:14] him is our expectation and our faith
[2:12:17] from believing it
[2:12:20] oh praise the Lord
[2:12:23] would you turn and lay your hand on one
[2:12:25] another we got our sister that's going
[2:12:27] to be baptized this morning Sister Mary
[2:12:29] Beth she'll come prepare for that
