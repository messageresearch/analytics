need him every moment of our life and I'm so grateful that he promised he would be with us and help us and we can testify that he's done that for you amen we greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus such an honor for us to be together again in the presence of the Lord trust you've come to receive something from the Lord and he believes he's mindful of all of our needs and all of our desires and um we certainly can bring them to him we believe that turn with me if you would to the Book of Luke chap 21 this morning verse 9 um I'd like to give you a little bit of an update on Erica today I'm sure that some of you probably already heard we had the ambulance come to get her yesterday and take her to the hospital and she has pneumonia and both lungs um pancreatitis colitis High ammonia and other things that are that she's dealing with and brother Donnie what did you say about about all that none of this moves me until he says otherwise we're believing for her Miracle amen amen we want to pray want to remember that of course but I'm sure that many of you are aware that Israel has been under bombardment the last couple of days and the last number I had over 400 Israelis have been killed and of course hundreds of Palestinians as well and um estimated over 2500 missiles have been fired on Israel Hamas says ,000 so who knows what it really is but when I look at Israel I can see Israel as as really a type of the Bride because where Israel sits they're totally surrounded by by enemies not just people that dislike them but people that want to destroy them and that's why really there will never be a solution to the Israeli Palestinian um situation because the Palestinians pretty much want them dead annihilated gone finished how can you ever negotiate with people like that and it's the same with the Devil the devil don't want you to back off he wants you gone he wants to kill you and if he can't kill you he wants to make you so crippled up and compromised that your faith can't do anything against him as a matter of fact as I was sitting studying for today he come in the room where I was at and said these words to me if you will compromise I will leave your daughter I said I make no deals with the Devil and he feels that way today we make no deals with the devil so we certainly want to remember Israel and that whole area we know that it's nothing but a time bomb and we know that all the world has to eventually turned against him um we just pray that God will have his way and get his people there we know all Jews are not elect there an element of Jews that are as anti-god as any communist you ever met in your life that's right because some of them say there could be no God to allow their people to go through a holocaust they don't believe in God many Jews do not believe in God but there might be a few of them that's elect and they just ain't come to it yet so we just pray that God's will will be done I mean he has a request on your heart today and your need oh you say but mine seems so small compared to the one ones that you just mentioned but no matter how big it is or how little it is can you imagine God moving on a dumb possum and send that psum to Elijah's house and that dumb posum waited for Elijah to finally catch up that she needed prayer a little fish about that long thrown down in the lake at Dale Holland not too far from where Harry and I were raised and God raised that little tiny fish you know why the prophet said he did that to show that he's concerned about the small things so no matter how we categorize our needs today let's take them to the Lord thank you Lord Heavenly Father we count it such a privilege to be called your children were it not for your Grace today we could be out here on Sunday morning trying to recuperate from a hangover from last night trying to reminisce what we did through the night we were so high that we didn't know where we were lost trying to get enough money together for another hit to make us through the another day but here we stand in the presence of almighty God saved going to heaven loving you more than anything in this world we are so blessed father and we want you to know that we love you with all of our hearts first of all we want to ask you to forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings forgive us for our trespasses against you and and against anyone else we bring our needs before you and we lay them on the altar of God we want to C cast all of our cares upon you today for the Bible tells us you care for us you saw the hands of these people that were uplifted hundreds of them signifying little needs big needs mediumsized needs but whatever they are we bring them before you today I pray father you would go there to that room where Erica is Sycamore schs you see the doctors are trying to give her this med and that Med and this this test and that test and we're thankful for what they can do but father we're ultimately looking to you I rebuke this pneumonia in both of her lungs in the name of Jesus may it clear up father you see this pancreatitis Lord she was dealing with it even though we was gone and tried to get away for a few days and Lord she wasn't good one day we were there and had miserable nights but she didn't want to cut it short and come home because of the rest of us there so she stayed and stayed as long as she could stay but we thank you that we made it home and she didn't have to be put in the hospital there we're grateful we can look all around if we'll open our eyes and see your blessings no matter what we're going through so we made it back home and we're grateful for that and we're just believing that these things are going to be changed I've already sent out a text this morning to many of my preacher friends around the world her name has already been called before your throne the devil's going to regret this he's going to regret every time he stood against the people of God for it only gives you an opportunity to manifest yourself Lord we pray for Israel today dear God it's a difficult situation we know cuz we have many people there that don't even believe in you yet we have some small message groups there and from the words that I've heard so far they're all doing okay and we pray that you'd watch over them Lord God may you deal with your elect I pray in the name of Jesus every child of God here today that ain't homesick may they become that way so we can get so sick of this world that we cry and pray the way John did come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus but until that hour comes Lord I am your servant I am reporting for Duty these are your servants we have come here today reporting for Duty and we say to hell you will regret this as the army of God as the people people of God we stand on the side of our King speak to us today father from your word we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus the Saints said God bless you amen Luke 21 verse 9 but when you shall hear of wars and commotions wars and commotions be not terrified wow so when you hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things say it with me must must not possibly perhaps must first come to pass but the end is not by and by and we know verse n has been ongoing for many many many years hundreds of years then said he unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes I know that it's you know been pretty small but just just two days ago before yesterday another earthquake hit part of the Middle East there killed around 2,000 people earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and Great Signs shall there be from Heaven Romans chapter 8 verse1 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of what adoption whereby we cry ABA father may the Lord bless his words you may be seated there's a lot to be afraid of if we look around I read just yesterday where disease X will be many hundreds of times more deadly than Co ever was pestilence is breaking out around the world chalera many different things that we thought were defeated by science and education and Men of great minds are reappearing again fearful sights in the heavens how is it that Israel one of the most advanced nations in the world in their shinb bet in their ability to gather intelligence informations and their main Ally the United States of America were so taken to where that a group of Islamic militants by the name of Hamas would be able to slip in on the southern border and Israel didn't know it America didn't know it none of the rest of the world knew it how was that even possible one day after the yam Kapur war in 1973 which was Israel's darkest time since they had been a nation and yet Israel of course they said the fall then was because they had such pride in thems eles that they believed they had the ability to watch everything around them I wonder if it hasn't repeat it again Israel leads the nation in many medical Technologies and many AI Technologies and many things that other nations of the world are way behind them I wonder sometimes if pride and arrogance does not get not only the nation but individuals to where we think we've got this we've got this we're good our borders are strong you know Israel has one of the greatest anti-missile defense systems in the world Germany just bought some of their systems Israel helped develop the stealth F35 Fighter the F22 Fighter the most advanced fighters in the known world how is is it then that these militants could come through on motorcycles they could cut the wire fence and had paratroopers on paragliders no more than a balloon and yet attacked from the sky hundreds and hundreds of them over 600 the count that I got this morning been killed 2,000 injured hundreds that are prisoners how could this happen because Israel like every other Nation when they leave God the Bible says they will be turned into hell you know and the same thing applies to churches does it not as it applies to individuals so as I was looking early this morning before daylight as they were interviewing different people there and they said what's the feel in Israel and I kept hearing this same word over and over again fear fear we thought we were safe we thought this would never happen to us again how is this possible of course the Americans are wanting to know how could this ever be I saw some of our congressmen some of our Senators and they W to have a hearing you now politicians think hearings hearings this hearings that we've got to get to the bottom of this we've got to get to the bottom I saw some of you same politicians one day will be asking the same question how could we have ever ever let this happen to us that Russia annihilated us how will it ever be the same principle in view they didn't think they needed God they said it in the days of the Prophet we don't need oh Jehovah as long as we've got the Army the Navy the Air Force and the Marines we need Jehovah I don't care how good our army is I don't care how big our church is how wealthy we are how much we think we know we need him every hour of our life it is a great fearful time is it not I guarantee you this morning people all over Israel are terrified earlier in the day this morning Hezbollah on the Northern end of Israel which is already been setting up their headquarters already Gathering their militia already Gathering great intelligence sources they fired over some missiles so now they're pondering will Israel deal with a battle in the South and already won brewing in the north well you see that's why I think that they're a reflection of the Bride because no matter which way way the bride turns whether it's north south east or west it seem like we are bombarded with sickness and disease and trouble and turmoil on our job in our home and the church is not free from it but I would just like to say we are unlike Israel in that we depend upon our Great Mighty Men with great intelligence we don't depend upon the Marines and the Air Corp we don't depend upon scientists but we depend upon the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we believe God has got men in the earth that are LED of the Holy Ghost and they will preach the word and they will blow the trumpet before the devil ever makes a move they will sound the alarm get ready get ready because the enemy is coming but we will not be overtaken we will not be blindsided by hell because we have men of God that have an unction of the Holy Ghost they don't depend upon wi tapping they don't depend upon listening to the internet but they listen to the father as he says warn the congregation warn the congregation evil is near warn them that darkness is near tell them to get filled ever fiber with the Holy Ghost because he is time is upon [Applause] [Music] us and from that I would like to speak to you again this morning on a life above ungodly fear no friends we do not have to live every moment of our life under the devil's fear look with me in second Timothy if you would again this morning where Paul writing about this and he said 1 2 Timothy 1:7 God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind I me know there's a Godly fear a righteous fear we all know that we all know we need it when a nation loses their fear of God well look at what they turn into when a people lose their fear of God you watch our young people when they lose that reverential fear of their parents you watch how they erode in their individuality they will begin to have this Rebellion inside of them and it won't just stop with Mom and Daddy it will it will go to every aspect of authority you lose respect for your father and your mother it won't be long you lose respect respect for the deacons of the church and they tell you don't do this or oh I don't have to listen to nobody or you say but I've still got respect for you brother Donnie but you won't have it long because Satan wants to take down every element of that respect come on somebody let's have church today because Satan wants to tear every bit of it down and before long you have no respect for anyone or no respect in the aspect as far as those that are above you which is exactly where our world is where our nation is international law doesn't mean anything American law doesn't mean anything it don't mean anything to them that's in the White House the only reason they've got laws to put you in jail when you break the law but they can break the law they can lie they can cheat they can steal come on somebody they can do whatever they want to do you think the Congress lives by the law well a lot of them ain't nothing but a bunch of Hypocrites the Senators ain't nothing come on Amen the our Governors our Mayors there ain't nothing but a bunch of Hypocrites there's only one thing that's going to bring peace to the Earth it ain't the Republicans winning in 2024 it ain't the Democrats winning in 2024 there's only one thing that's going to bring peace back to the Earth and that's when King Jesus comes back to the Earth again well if the Russians take over we'll have peace no we won't if the Norwegians take over we'll have peace no we won't we'll only have peace when Jesus comes back and Hallelujah he eradicates sin and he binds the devil and throws him down there in that pit for a thousand years and then the Earth will enter into the Blessed Millennium and we will have peace there will be no peace until the Prince of Peace comes back but while we are waiting in from that we can have peace in here we can have peace in the middle of hell we can have peace in the middle of storms in the middle of Trials we can look hell in the face and say you won't take my joy you won't take my peace because Jesus the prince of peace has already set up his kingdom and my [Applause] soul thank you I want you to notice that Paul and Dena was this he said God has not given us the spirit of fear but you ever notice this he doesn't say God hadn't given us the emotion of fear fear is an emotion just like joy happiness all other kinds of emotions but sometimes people tend to think because they EXP experience the emotion of fear that they're not trusting God that's not true at all that means simply you're a human being how many still gets afraid of things somebody come up behind you and poke in the side you say you jump out of your skin somebody stop in front of you and you say oh God oh God oh God help me what is that happiness somebody turns off in front of you somebody nearly runs you off the road or whatever you know how road rage is in the days we're living in so which emotion does that trigger Happiness joy satisfaction peace fear cuz you never know what people's going to do they'll run you off the road they'll do you know you know that is for a parking spot in Walmart and people get out and walk two miles of an evening to get exercise and they want the closest parking spot to Walmart to the front door and if you pull in their place oh my goodness so what emotion does that Stir It stirs the emotion of fear that is not sinful that is human but Paul said God has not given us the spirit of fear so you see a spirit has to have a host right a spirit has to have a host to be able to attach itself to I know it's hard for us to to to relate to this really but whenever Jesus got ready to cast them Devils out of the man at Gat and them demons could not stand to go out into the abyss so they asked if they could be cast into a herd of pigs I say why in the world would a spirit want to live in a bunch of hogs because they need a host even if it's an animal they would rather live in animals than to be disembodied and live in the realm of the Abyss on so they ask can we go there and Jesus says go well them Hogs had a whole lot more sense than people's got because once them Devils went in there they thought I can't live this life I can't live this life I'm killing myself so here goes the whole herd of hogs and the went into the place there of water and choked himself now the devil's the devil's kind of ass that's kind of stupid in one sense of the word was it because the Devils didn't realize this is going to be a short-lived experience for me I'm still going to the to the be because them Hogs could not stand demonic oppression and possession so something moved upon these pigs now we call pigs dumb and I agree I I I've had a lot of pigs and they can be pretty dumb but they had enough sense to know they didn't want to live a demon possessed life so they run in one Accord so the main boore s whichever it was took off and she said I can't stand it I can't stand it I can't stand and all the rest and they go and drown themselves you see not only does Nations have spirits but churches do a friend of mine several years ago was at a certain message meeting I'll say it that way and it was a move in the message that had been around for a long time but they had a certain agenda that they were trying to promote and this friend of mine goes to this meeting hundreds and hundreds of people there from all over everywhere and he was curious brother Joel just to know you know what's it all about I I don't want to miss anything am am I missing something that God's doing and he sat a good ways back in the auditorium where the meeting was and the people are going and M they're shouting and running the music and the singing and what felt like the spirit of God what seemed like the spirit of God and then all of the sudden as he looked upon on the platform he saw a spirit raise up but it was a woman and this was a very beautiful woman dressed in a real seductive Tempest type of closing so the preachers are on the platform the musicians the singers and hundreds and hundreds of people are screaming and hollering and oh my and he watches as this Spirit comes up above the congregation and she starts walking out over the top of the people and motioning for him like this you realize that demons love certain church services that's why you need to be careful well you get on to that and and they'll go to talking to you now you see that man went there to find out is this right is it wrong what's what's going on with it and go God allowed him to break into another realm now there was all these hundreds of people there that no doubt left that and thought Oh Glory to God this is oh my this is something but that man left with a total different view what was it demons mhm demons I know every time I go to talking this way some of yall get scared now you know what that is you're feeling it's not just the emotion of fear it's the spirit of fear because you're scared to death one of these things is going to get on you well I'll tell you the only way that'll happen is if you allow it don't sit there and be terrified oh God oh God I don't I don't want that to happen to me well if you don't want it to you ain't got nothing to worry about but Brother Don every time I hear a preacher talk about that it just makes me so nervous and so upset you sat right there and cl the blood of Jesus and say Satan you are a liar my body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost not demons but you see there's a difference then in the emotion of fear and a spirit of fear now when this man saw this he told me this himself whenever he saw this it left him and he left that place of course immediately and he walked out of there so you can imagine every time this certain mve is mentioned to this man he does not think of all the screaming shouting hollering healings or whatever more but he thinks about the seductive temptress spirit that was in this certain thing around the message don't you understand all these moves around the message that are absolutely contrary to the teaching of the word of God don't you understand what that is it's demons and people will get under it and they feel so pulled and they feel so pull say well maybe it's the Lord maybe it's the Lord or maybe it's a demon well how can I tell judge it by the word the Holy Ghost will never lead his word that's right is that right now do those things do they do they make me worrisome of course they do I don't like been around demons I've had to deal with some the majority of my life I don't like having to cast out Devils I don't like seeing them I don't like feeling them I don't like knowing and I know they're right here and now but that's all right I also know who else is here so that's why I ain't afraid come on there Saints but you see a spirit is in need of a host now that host is you you I people out here in the world and we are the ones that will give them a habitable portion in humanity so they will come try to get in our bodies try to affect us and our spirits and our walk with God or by the grace of God we can realize you know what I've developed a critical spirit I've got a spirit of fear on me and I'm sick of it I want to be set free come on somebody or you can be a host for that spirit and then instead of it just being the emotion of fear you actually have given that Spirit a body and emotions and all the anxiety and all the trouble and all that that it goes through and it never will just stay on you alone it wants to get on you then get on your husband or get on your children or get on your wife whichever it is and then you get around other people and they sense it and then they pick it up and it gets on them and then it gets around their family and they get around their friends that's exactly what fear wants to do I don't know about you I'm sick of it I said I'm sick of it I am sick of God's people being bound under a spirit of fear I believe we can live above it you see when you allow fear to control your thoughts to control your emotions ions to control even the way you worship and the way you pray oh I'm afraid oh if I was to really ever turn loose and really worship God what will people say what will the say what are you more concerned about what they say or what he says well come on now somebody and when we allow a spirit of fear to monopolize Our Lives it will control the way you work it will control the way you worship it will control you or you won't trust nobody oh I'm afraid oh I've been hurt before I've been so hurt before you can't trust nobody oh my you can't trust people you just have to stay away from them that's exactly what he wants you to do he wants you to isolate yourself and cut yourself off from everybody else come on somebody but you need to realize that ain't nothing but a ly devil sure people will hurt you sure people will let you down but there are people in this Earth and in this church that will stand beside you with their very last breaths but it depends upon which one you're going to believe are you going to believe the spirit of fear or are you going to believe God's word that God is amen producing a people that believes what he [Applause] said so the spirit of fear begins to manipulate your thoughts your speech let me show you an acronym today anybody know what an acronym is okay good so let's look at a acronym of fear rather show it to them f a r false evidence appearing real ladies and gentlemen an acronym false evidence I wonder how many people are in prison today naturally because someone planted evidence in their car or their home or their business office or whatever more someone was able to sneak in and plant false evidence and then it was presented to the judge and the jury whenever they had their trial and say your honor this was found in the trunk of his car now jury this was found in his bedroom this was found here and there and there and the people say well it was there the man's guilty they're Shores the world the jury all gets together yep we found this man guilty we hear about it monthly sometimes every week you'll hear of somebody that spent 20 years in prison I saw the picture of a man just this past week 40 something years of his life was spent in prison and then by DNA testing they proved this man was innocent as I looked at that man Brother David I thought how much that man has has lost in those 42 years being put up in prison sitting there Harry every day knowing he was innocent knowing he was innocent but by our laws and by the way that we do it they judge this man guilty and confined him to a prison years away from his family years away from society years away from everything as I looked at that and then I looked at this as I studied when I was gone this past week and I realize that's not just so for people going to the penitentiary but Satan will try to do the same thing in our everyday lives he will try to plant false evidence in your mind false evidence in your home and get you even question the Loyalty of your husband or your wife come on somebody he will try to give you symptoms and the prophet said symptoms is the worst enemy of Divine Healing because somebody will get prayed for and their hand is worse tomorrow than it was today and they will say well I guess I didn't get healed do you understand what that was false evidence appearing real come on Hallelujah well I got prayed for it for this certain besetting sin don't you know it hit me worse on Tuesday I must not been delivered false evidence appearing real can pain be real oh yes can headaches be real yes and Satan will plant false evidence in your body trying to get you to believe that you did not receive what God did for you you can go to a youth camp and be delivered of an evil spirit and Satan will come right back and plant false evidence and you'll say well I guess I didn't get nothing no you're letting the devil use his acronym of fear against you false evidence while I lost my temper false evidence I done this false evidence I done that but you need to recognize the devil Hallelujah and say to him false evidence appearing real and go to the judge and say father I failed I'm sorry forgive me the devil planted this evidence on me but I Repent I'm sorry Lord listen this in the water of Separation The Prophet said I used to often time wonder what's the matter with the Christian Church they're so scared of things why you've got nothing to be scared about but how Satan has taken his acronym of fear and almost let make it appear like we have nothing to be happy about he holds that acronym before you I know it's the first time maybe some of you all have ever seen this but believe it or not you've been living a lot of your life by it false evidence appearing real in your life friends do you think do you think it's easy when you see your baby in such pain she can hardly take a breath taking as much pain med as they can give it her legs and feet swollen horrendous size you think that don't play on me do you think I'm a superhuman do you think I have no emotions and no fears I do but I ain't going to let them control me Hallelujah hallelujah oh I know you I know you as human beings and I want you to understand just because I'm a preacher don't mean I'm not a human I have to cast fear down I have to cast anxiety down I have to meet him face to face and say you are a liar and in the name of Jesus Christ you have no hold on us as the people of God [Applause] notice a prophet said the first word nearly Jesus said after the resurrection was fear not see don't fear don't get scared there ain't nothing going to happen well nothing can happen nothing can bother a Christian not even death itself can touch the Christian he that hears my words and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death under life jump on down a little bit in this in this paragraph here I want you to listen to this carefully you'll never get nothing by being a little jellyfish Christan no sir did you ever see a jellyfish you just hit him he splatters all over everything so that's why a lot of Christians are unstable as they can be they go over here and then they go over there and then they're up and then they're down they're in they're out well I don't know I don't know if I can make it or not you just hit them just bump into them a blob and a blob on you and a blob on you and a blob on you well what a Blobby Blobby blob you are and you'll never get nothing from God about being a jellyfish the crabs and things along the side of the seashore comes up with his pincher and cuts him in two and takes him down CA the jellyfish just lays there brother we need some Christians not jellyfish but with a backbone that don't stand oh I don't mean to fuss with people but stand oh Hallelujah listen this stand for your god-given rights that Christ died for certainly not pushed around we don't have to be no sir we got an inheritance and our inheritance belongs to us it's your privilege to have anything that you inherited through accepting Jesus Christ and dying to yourself accepting Jesus Christ and dying to yourself how marvelous yes sir Satan said well I'll tell you what I'm going to do listen now no you ain't going to do nothing but little jellyfish just oh devil no devil please please devil don't don't touch me devil I'll squirt all over you I'll blob I'll blob and your a face devil I'll blob that deacons don't touch me I'm a touchman on Christian but Donnie Don't Preach on me don't preach on me now I'll tell you Sons and Daughters of God want to be preached on they want whing this out of their life they want fear out of their life they don't want to be controlled by ungodly fear [Music] [Applause] now listen here the prophet's going to tell us how to talk back to the devil no you ain't going to do nothing that's the way to talk back to him say I know my position in Christ and you might just as well get away I ain't listening to you no more I got an inherit now friends try to put yourself in my shoes my daughter's in the hospital my wife's down there with her her family tore all to pieces and I'm sitting alone Home Alone studying for you today now when you think if any woman have a justifiable excuse to miss church today it would be the pastor but I have a post of Duty and when I stand before God I will stand there and answer he'll look at me and say I see you showed up when you didn't feel like it I see you showed up whenever really you could have been at home lot the other people would have been they would have been here they would have been there but I see you showed up uhhuh and you know what I want hell to know I showed up today come on somebody I showed up today and you showed up today and what did we show up for to have church we showed up to high Church to worship the Living God and say we are not jellyfish Christians hallelujah hallelujah you think them three little Parker girls sitting no buring heartbroken [Music] hallu the only reason Emma ain't here is cuz she's sick and couldn't come in the bed but they showed up Hallelujah I think it's time we start showing up and don't just bring your body but bring your mind bring your spirit bring your dancing shoes too cuz we might want to dance a little bit bring your worshiping God bring that voice to say hallelujah hallelujah I'm not leaving my worship voice at home I'm bringing it to church with [Applause] me look at what God Said to Joshua Joshua 1:9 have not I commanded thee be strong and be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest or we can be like brother job now let me be the first to put a disclaimer on this statement I'm fixing to make I don't know how the sovereignty of God works okay I don't know how test sent from God versus things we say and our part plays into the bigger picture I don't understand all that but job says in chapter 3: 25 for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me now the prophet picks this up in a sermon of all titles to mention this perfect face and he said in the Book of Job it says job feared and what he feared actually happened what brought it his fear his fear I wonder if a lot of what we go through is brought Upon Us ourselves because we're so afraid it's going to happen happen you know what you're doing you're actually believing that it will this is the flip side of faith in God's promise that we so expect why my grandmother died with cancer and my mother and my aunt and my so and so and my son's oh no oh no it must be in my jeans it must be in My DNA my daddy had all type of sexual problems or it just runs in my family but I'd tell that devil The Bu stops here it might have been in my grandpa it might have been in my great great great great great great great grandpa but it ain't going no farther it ain't getting a hold to me because I'm a Son of God they didn't maybe set in the church that I set in that preaches deliverance and practices casting out Devils amen they might not have known what I want but it ain't controlling me lust is not dominating my life hallelujah it's not controlling me [Applause] or you can be fearful and anxious and beside yourself and then your fear will bring it upon you wow notice this how the prophet said his fear brought it to him job's fear brother da delivered wow he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now if he would have know it wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen help us Lord if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe I just haven't got faith sufficient it'll never happen don't worry but if you know it's going to happen Hallelujah it'll happen see it's a substance of something job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear your disease won't leave you it won't if you have a faith that it will well you know the results you ask any medical doctor the first thing that that he will try to do is get you to have confidence in his medicine that he's going to give you if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone sure see what is it then it's faith that does the healing so if you go to the doctor and they say drink three cups of watermelon juice mixed with one head of broccoli and two head of cauliflower and three fat grapes and 14 raisins don't add 15 but add 14 don't sit your look at me like that some of you all probably tried that recipe you know is when we get sick we'll do just about anything well rub your head and cross your eyes and you know twitch at the same time glory to God brother only I've tried that well did it help you I did what was it your faith well I believe if I take this it'll help my antihistamine it'll shut down the XYZ and the lobia the phosphates and the this and that and the other and you say man alive that medicine is so good it wasn't probably even the medicine after all it was your face that it would help you don't you understand God loves Humanity he don't want them to be sick oh my goodness Isaiah 354 can we go a little while longer y'all ain't no hurry are you Isaiah 35:4 say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you thank you Lord Isaiah 41:10 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness verse 13 for I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not I will help thee it's amazing how many times Old and New Testament these words are coupled either fear not or don't fear or don't be afraid why we inherited that after the fall when Adam running head the first time behind the bush and he got afraid he planted something in his seed and the generations of billions of people that would live for thousands of years after him man never felt fear until that time I want you to listen to this quote so a brother Minister brother shared this with me a few weeks ago I've been sending it around the world because it's such a blessing to me and I think of Moses how that Moses standing up there on the mount by the side of this Burning Bush had lost all hopes of Freedom now here's Moses the mighty man of God God's deliverer but Moses himself had lost all hopes of Freedom didn't seem like that the freedom that the people he so gallantly stood for at one time was ever going to happen but in the light of God standing by that burning bush everything in him changed don't you understand from that's what I'm trying to help you see today if this can change in you you'll walk out them same doors different people everything in him changed I think it's the same today that many of us lose the sight of Freedom so what about that besetting s brothers what about those of you that deal with pornography what about those of you that deal with temper anger whatever it is to deal with and that thing seem like it will not let go you've been in prayer line after prayer line you've been prayed for by every man of God you got confidence in and you go good for a while and fall right back in the same thing again and it can seem as if though you lose the very sight of freedom and you find yourself back down at the pyramid pids of Egypt you find yourself at suckles working on the Statue of ramesis you find yourself over at the Nile pedaling with your feet irrigating Egyptian crops and freedom seems like it's a million miles from you but if the pillar of fire can come by this way today yes sir hallelujah hallelujah if the pillar of fire can come by our way and you can get near that fire it can get near to you and change something within you then you can look at Freedom is no longer an attainable something that's for everybody else but not for you but you will regain sight of your freedom I think here here's a little boy sitting before me probably an infantile paralysis little arms all twisted up I look at a lady with a white king probably a blind woman lovely young lady laying on the little cart maybe many out there with cancer heart trouble and diseases that's going to kill you but you lose lose all thought of Freedom as soon as the doctor says it's incurable isn't it amazing of all the diseases that was existing in the 40s and when the angel of God appeared to the prophet he mentioned one by name cancer why somebody have pneumonia oh yeah oh yeah I ain't had that you'll get over you'll be fine somebody has this oh yeah but what is it about cancer you realize many people won't even say that word they call it the c word well I am not scared myself to say that word cuz it ain't nothing but the another word for a devil out of hell and I don't mind telling you I hate that cancer devil I said I hate that cancer devil come on children oh brother Donnie i' be afraid to say anything I'm afraid not to because I believe we are called as the army of God to stand against Satan and every demon Out of Hell in the day that we live in I've told you before and I'll tell you again as a reminder there is not one person in medical history that has ever been cured and healed of neuroendocrine tumor what Erica's fighting but the way I look at it there won't be one devil that'll ever walk Before the Throne of God and said you got that one and you got that one and you got that one and you got that one but there was never never any of your children that ever conquered me that ain't my father well the way I look at it why not for her to be the first one well you say ain't nobody ever been where I'm at well why don't you be the first one Hallelujah why not let you there had never been a virgin that ever conceived but Mary said be it unto me be it un me according to Thy word Lord let it be me let it happen to me Lord God hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah but you lose all thought of Freedom as soon as the doctor says it's in curable Prophet goes on in this same sermon to say why brother if we'd ever come in the presence of God like Moses did it was a revolutionary to him it was a revolutionary to him why it would revolutionize in the light of that angel of God standing there on the Mountain that day everything that he once had or thought never would happen come to be a reality hallelujah sister Judy Archer they've diagnosed her with a very rare form of cancer only a few thousand people a year ever diagnosed with it much nope good prognosis nope not from the doctors but whose report will we believe hallelujah oh that's nice whenever they say yeah we've got this pill and we've got this and that and we're having 87% success rate but you and I know enough about that medication to know if one of themselves hides it'll come back again in four years or five years or whatever but if the Lord God can send the laser light of the revealed word and it goes down inside that's the way I pray not only for Erica but for sister Judy and whoever else is dealing with that I know of Lord made the pillar of fire go inside their body and annihilate every one of those cancer cells May everything be restored like it [Applause] was or I can come out this morning and say Saints I've come to grips with reality the doctor told Eric last night she I would just sign up for hospice and just go ahead and get ready and we're planning the funeral now and um I'm just seeing would you want to sing a song and would you sing a song who' like to give a testimony at Erica's funeral that uh she was a great encouragement to you I feel sorry for it's that's the kind of Pastor you got but I want to be the kind of man in the middle of the battle I can put down the standard of the Lord and said here is where we stand on God's promise of his word hallelujah I will not bring upon you the plagues that was on the Egyptian but I am the Lord thy God that he seee of all thy diseases Delight thyself also in the Lord and He will give Thee the desires of thine [Applause] heart but brother Donnie what if what if sister Erica what if she passes well this is what I believe I believe what brother Greg Robbins believes is he come up to me on the platform here a few Services ago and said brother Donnie we're praying for her every day you know them folks in North Carolina tell brother I tell you one thing we are believing God we're praying for her I believe this brother Tony if that the Lord was to let her die I believe God will allow you to raise her from the dead uhhuh that's the kind of people I want behind me that's the kind of people I want when I raise the banner and I look back there that's the kind of people I want to see where with you brother we will meet the challenge of this hour not only my daughter but your daughter and your daughter and your son Hallelujah and your husband this is not just for me and my needs it's for [Applause] you hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you this and share this with you before I close I told Lance this the other day I said Lance if the Lord God would speak to me and say I give you Authority today to speak to that devil and make him leave but it would bring me more honor and glory for it to go on another six months I hope you folks know whatever would do I would do what our lord Jesus done when he said don't you know I could pray to my father right now and he would send 12 Legions of angels to deliver me when he goes into the garden down and praying weeping crying father if it be th will let this cup pass from me never thess not my will but th be done can you imagine if God gave you the authority to change the situation today and it was so horrendous but he let you know it'll bring him more Glory there's another doctor that needs to testify it's hopeless there's another scan that needs to be made I can't wait till we can put all these scans up here hallelujah what about it Church you see we're talking about the third pole and preaching about the third pole preaching about great things is going to happen and great things is going to happen well if you'll follow what the prophet said and God called man 1958 you'll find that the prophet said God was training and teaching and schooling men to get ready for the Revival that's going to hit the church but he's got to have man that he can take to the back out of the desert and crush them crush them sir till they become instruments so in his hands that they will not speak until they know it's his will you see Moses had Authority and he could strike that rock the second time and totally broke every type of the scripture is that right testified against the work of the cross in order to magnify himself Christ only has to be Shar once but Moses got in his anger and his temper In the Flesh and smoked the rock twice God said speak to it don't Smite Christ again but brother R using that typ and said he spoke of every denomination that would ever come God wants people who have character to match power anybody here want to be that type of person let Stand Together the prophet in Israel and the church he said this has been the greatest thing that I found among Christian people throughout the entire world has been a fear they're always afraid and when a little sickness strikes they're afraid and many I wonder sometimes and now I'm along with you now I'm along with you but now what I'm trying to do tonight and then this week to come is to try to drive that fear Away by God's word again he says un Parable sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus think of it no fear that's the greatest plague that there is in the Christian church today wow you mean greater than cancer greater than migraine headaches and greater than all these other things the greatest plague on the Christian church today fear and the reason they're afraid is because they're not taught right and settled right on the gospel may God help us how many wants to live a life above ungodly fear [Music] amen hallelujah thank you Lord let's sing that song that you sary let just B hits if you would today we're going to pray how many would be honest before the Lord today and say Lord I believe these things I've heard but I need help with them Jesus I need help my hands is up too friends oh sure the devil you better believe the devil tries to bring all kinds of fears my way I'm just like you don't look at me as some type of Superman I'm not no Superman just another or ordinary human being trying to make Heaven my home heavenly father as we have our heads bowed to the dust of the earth we call upon your name today Lord Jesus from preaching on fear Sunday before last it was evident to see by the phone calls texts emails WhatsApp all the different lines of communication that I received from different parts of the world it was something that was so needful Lord we'll be honest today and say we need help Father we're humans you let us still have the emotion of fear that's not a sin but far be it from us to live under the spirit of fear many of them I saw it on their face and I was describing that demon and that meeting and they didn't want nothing to do with that I could see it all over their face they wanted nothing to do with that but what about the spirit of fear they look at it the same way that was a doctrine that was a move some of them years ago here were identified around that move but it's pretty much a dead anymore so there's not much we have to fear about it but fear is Alive and Well we do not want to be a host we know there's many hosts even in nature ticks all kinds of little fish Barnacles all types of things in the ocean we can see the mightiest whale in the oceans and look at them and they have been attacked by all types of little things and their body becomes a host to these creatures Lord may we pass through your great scan today Jesus may you begin with me may I pass through your great scan of the word if you find that I'm a host to anything father that's displeasing to you help me Lord God I don't want to host evil I don't want to be a host of wrong I don't want to be a host of Pride or arrogance neither do I want to be a host to the spirit of fear because if Satan can get preachers to be a host then everywhere they go and preach they have the ability of sharing that same spirit so they drop a little thing here and a little thing there it didn't seem like much but it was the spirit of fear on that preacher and he Dro it in this congregation then he went to Indiana and preached and then he went to Georgia and preached and then he went to Florida and preached and then the pastor of that assembly finds himself dealing with these things you wonder what in the world it was because he had a host preacher in the pulpit that was a host of Fear oh Lord God I want my body my soul my gift my mind my strength to be a host to the Holy Ghost hallelujah how many of you Saints say the same thing can you just raise your hands up as a sign of surrender we're going to host something let us host the Holy Ghost oh Jesus instead of being a host of Fear may I be a host of Deliverance instead of being a host of anxiety may I be a host of peace and deliverance Lord God instead of being a host of a gossiping Spirit may I be a host of the spirit of truth hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus we worship you today Father Hallelujah in the name of Jesus Lord I I know it hit that a bit ago father I felt it surg there from the quote of losing the side of freedom I saw the looks on some of their faces for some of his anxiety for some it was the solid truth that hit them Square in the face they realized they had been arrested by the presence of God and even though they were praying for Freedom they had lost all sight of it it only took a few hours for every Israelite to finally leave Egypt that day two million Jews would have been able to walk out pretty good speed no doubt in a matter of hours every Israelite was gone out of Egypt but it's evident it took years to get Egypt out of the Israelites oh Father Deliver Us from the spirit of fear hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm sorry Father I'm sure those that was here Wednesday night week ago they saw me laying on this Altar and they wondered what was wrong with me as I went back into the office Lord and your presence was still there and I had to ask you to forgive me for something it wasn't drinking smoking lying running around with somebody else's wife but it was the fear of me totally giving everything that I am into your presence afraid afraid I dare say I'm not the only one Lord help us to lay aside our pride her arrogance I've seen so many preachers mess

brothers here at the church and I won't call his name because I don't want embarrass him but he said Brother Don he said I'd kind of like to be like them men that day that brought that man to Jesus and he said then man brought the man to Jesus they couldn't get in so they begin to tear the roof off of the house and let the man down and he said that's what I I want to do for sister Erica so it been a while since I read that scripture so I pulled it up and looked at it and the Bible says when Jesus saw their face he turned to the sick of the Pauli and said Son thy sins be forgiven thee didn't mention nothing about that man's Faith but their faith can you imagine the Lord Jesus saw the faith of these men and tore the roof off of Peter's house his history says tore the roof off of Peter's house and Jesus looked at their face and said I'm going to forgive your sins because they believed praise be to God don't never underestimate the power of prayer and the power of your faith in God's word to even move for other people I heard brother Ron Spencer say it last night I listened to a little bit of the service down at brother Tims as I was studying and he mentioned along this line and he said don't ever underestimate the power of prayer maybe some of you heard it and he said Moses stood there at the Red Sea and prayed and was faithful to God and God turned the Egyptians into fish food leave it to brother Ron to come up with such a statement the power of prayer for one man don't you love him today Saints praise the Lord how many can say we've got victory in the camp
