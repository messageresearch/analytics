TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you see doubt loves doubt depression loves depression spirits love other like-minded spirits that's why let me say this to the young people and to the old be careful who you call friend be careful who you associate with because weakness breeds weakness and you take one spirit that you're affected with it never ceases to amaze me you watch one person with one spirit and they'll friend up with another person they've never met before and they really have nothing in common except that one spirit is so familiar with the other that they almost tag-team with each other you take suicide or depression you take drugs you take lust and those spirits are tractus is brother random here this isn't me and he's saying right here in church there's two spirits a critical spirit loves a critical spirit and you take one person with the critical spirit and it'll find that other family in the church is critical and criticizing the pastor and criticizing the song leader and criticizing the music and they'll get together after church and they'll just go up one side and down the other of that pastor in that church and and what they're doing oh you think you can hide but Jesus found you here tonight that spirit loves that critical spirit feeds one with the other and those people don't even realize it I think they're you know they're really exposing sin little do they know they're giving heed to it seducing spirit to tear down the ministry and reputation at the church spirits love spirits brother Alan says these two spirits connected let me say this young people you'll never live higher spiritually than the influences and friends who use subject self - you want to go higher go around higher - kids you want to be more spiritual find a more spiritual friend than you you'll never live higher than the influences you subject yourself to you want more victory don't go around people without victory you want to get rid of that weakness don't befriend that person with that same weakness find others who have strength and say God give me energy give me strength for my brother and my sister we should be there should be a spirit within us to encourage those that are around us not to discourage anybody but to be an encouragement to your brother and encouragement to your sister be an encouragement to the pastor not a discouragement well it's the truth anyway
